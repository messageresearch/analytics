[31:45] face. As long as I'm live, I'll praise
[31:49] his name. There ain't no bird going to
[31:53] sing in my face. As long as

[34:32] Hallelujah.
[34:38] Jesus.
[34:49] Jesus.
[34:53] It's all going to be worth it.
[35:17] Jeez.
[35:34] Jesus. Jesus.
[35:37] Jesus. As our brother Brooks
[35:56] comes. Let's sing this song.
[36:06] I can
[36:08] see your
[36:11] holy
[36:13] face. Oh, your
[36:16] throne in heaven
[36:19] above. It seems so far away.
[36:25] Though I can
[36:28] touch your
[36:29] [Music]
[36:31] nails
[36:33] hands, I have a
[36:36] deep unspeakable
[36:39] joy that makes my faith
[36:45] stand. Lord, I believe in you.
[36:53] [Music]
[36:56] I'll he wants
[37:01] I can't
[37:03] see you with my
[37:06] heart. Deep in my heart, your presence
[37:12] I'll
[37:13] find. Lord, I
[37:16] believe in
[37:20] you. I'll always put my trust in
[37:27] you. Let this whole
[37:31] world say what they
[37:35] may. No one can take this joy
[37:42] away. Lord, I
[37:46] believe. Let's just do that again.
[37:49] Lord, I
[37:51] believe in
[37:55] you.
[37:57] I'll believe in
[38:02] you. Though I can
[38:06] see you with my
[38:09] eyes, deep in my heart, your presence
[38:15] I'll find.
[38:17] Lord, I
[38:19] believe in you.
[38:29] I'll
[38:35] [Music]
[38:40] let this joy
[39:03] No one can take this joy
[39:05] away. You love the Lord.
[39:18] God is good to
[39:20] us.
[39:23] Hallelujah. So love the Lord.
[39:26] Amen. I was telling the brother this
[39:29] morning, I
[39:32] really the Lord touched me, I just felt
[39:35] like I didn't want to preach no more. I
[39:38] just wanted to worship.
[39:40] And uh it was really uh difficult for me
[39:45] to get back to the worship the preaching
[39:48] part because all I wanted to do was
[39:51] worship
[39:53] God. You know, it's
[39:56] amazing because really we're in a season
[39:59] of
[40:01] worshiping. Think about it. when the
[40:02] lamb opened the book,
[40:05] uh, they they went into
[40:08] worship. And that's what Satan, if he
[40:11] can keep you from
[40:13] worshiping, he really he got
[40:17] you. Amen. And we're not going to
[40:19] prolong the time. I do want to sing one
[40:20] song. I didn't tell brother Randy this,
[40:22] but at the time I didn't have a song.
[40:25] So, if you want to be seated, that's
[40:27] fine. the grace of
[40:30] God. God sent his
[40:35] son. They call him
[40:41] Jesus. He came to
[40:48] love, heal,
[40:50] and forive.
[40:56] He lived and
[40:59] [Music]
[41:01] died and he bought my
[41:05] [Music]
[41:08] pardon. An empty grave is there to
[41:15] prove my Savior lives.
[41:22] Because he
[41:26] lives, I can face
[41:33] tomorrow
[41:35] because he
[41:39] lives. All my fear is
[41:46] gone because I know
[41:52] Oh, he holds
[41:55] the
[41:58] future and life is worth the
[42:05] living because he
[42:10] lives. How sweet to
[42:17] hold a
[42:20] newborn
[42:23] baby and feel the
[42:30] pride and joy he gave.
[42:37] But
[42:38] greater
[42:39] [Music]
[42:42] still the
[42:48] commun child can face
[42:53] uncertain days
[42:56] because he
[42:58] [Applause]
[43:00] lives. Because he lives.
[43:06] I can face
[43:10] tomorrow. Help me say it. Because he
[43:16] lives. Yes, sir. Our fear is
[43:23] God because Hey, yes, Lord. Hallelujah.
[43:30] He the
[43:34] future and life is worth the living just
[43:42] because he
[43:46] lives. And in one
[43:50] day, thank you Lord. I'll cross that
[43:55] [Music]
[43:57] river. I'll fight
[44:03] like no war and
[44:09] pain and then in
[44:12] death as death gives way to victory.
[44:18] [Music]
[44:20] I'll see the light of glory and I know
[44:28] he
[44:31] lives because he
[44:34] lives. Help me say it. Lord, I give face
[44:39] to
[44:42] tomorrow
[44:43] because you
[44:46] live. I thank you Lord. All fear
[44:52] Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[44:55] Because I know. Yes, I know. He holds
[45:01] the
[45:04] future and life is worth the living just
[45:11] because he
[45:15] lives. And life is the word. the living
[45:22] just because he lives.
[45:26] [Music]
[45:30] Hallelujah. Oh, glory to
[45:35] God.
[45:38] Hallelujah. Oh, thank you, Father. As we
[45:42] stand, let us get right into the word of
[45:45] God.
[45:48] We're going to start with Colossians,
[45:50] please. 2. Colossians 2. We kind of
[45:54] touched on that a little bit this
[45:55] morning. Colossians
[45:58] 2, beginning at the ninth
[46:10] verse. For in him dwelleth all the
[46:14] fullness of the Godhead bodily.
[46:17] And ye are complete in him which is the
[46:20] head of all principality and power. In
[46:24] whom also ye are
[46:25] circumcised with the circumcision made
[46:28] without
[46:29] hands in putting off the body of sins of
[46:34] the flesh. Circumcised now by God by
[46:38] putting away Amen. the body of sins of
[46:42] the flesh. By the circumcision of
[46:46] Christ, God circumcised you so well,
[46:50] Amen. He cut your flesh off,
[46:53] buried with
[46:55] him in baptism, wherein also you are
[46:58] risen with him through the faith and of
[47:02] the operation of God, who have raised
[47:06] him from the dead.
[47:08] And you being dead in your sins, and the
[47:12] uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he
[47:15] quickened together with him, having
[47:18] forgiven
[47:19] all. All
[47:24] trespasses.
[47:26] He's forgiven them all. Not some. Not
[47:30] 99% all.
[47:33] You believe that this this evening?
[47:37] Hallelujah. He's four principalities.
[47:40] Amen. Hallelujah. Let's continue to
[47:42] read. Blotting out the handwriting of
[47:43] ordinances that was given against us,
[47:46] which was contrary to us, and took it
[47:48] out of the way, nailing it to his cross,
[47:52] and having spore principalities and
[47:54] powers, he made a show of them openly,
[47:57] triumphant o triumphing over them in
[48:03] it. Let us pray. Father God, we thank
[48:05] you for your grace and your mercy. Lord,
[48:08] we're here this evening because of you.
[48:10] We thank you for your presence, Lord.
[48:13] You've been better to us than we've been
[48:14] to ourselves, Father. And God, we thank
[48:17] you right now. Hallelujah. For being so
[48:20] good to us, Lord. Lord, we thank you,
[48:23] Father, because we realize this evening
[48:25] we're not by ourselves. Lord, there is a
[48:28] host of angels encamped about us,
[48:30] Father. There's a wall of fire round
[48:32] about us, Father, in us, through us, and
[48:35] above us, Lord. God, we thank you,
[48:37] Father, for your protection. And we pray
[48:40] right now, Lord God, that you keep us
[48:41] and guide us in Jesus Christ's name. Let
[48:44] your perfect will be done here this
[48:45] evening. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[48:48] You may be seated. We preach this
[48:50] morning because of the blood. We want to
[48:53] by the grace of God uh continue that by
[48:56] the grace of God. There's a lot of
[48:57] things I kind of I felt like I I left
[48:59] out, but God said what he wanted to say.
[49:02] One thing about the blood of Jesus
[49:03] Christ is not only atonement, but it's
[49:06] also a protection. The word of God said,
[49:09] Amen. He he gave Moses a token and he
[49:11] said, "When I see the token, when I see
[49:14] the blood, I'll pass over you." Amen.
[49:17] So, not only is just a protection, but
[49:18] it's a protection against the death
[49:20] angel. You see, we don't mind. And when
[49:22] I put it this way, sickness and and and
[49:25] a lot of little things affect us, but
[49:27] none of it none of those things affect
[49:29] us like death. Is that right? That was
[49:31] one thing that men feared because they
[49:34] didn't know what was on the other side
[49:35] of the chasm. They didn't know what it
[49:37] was. Job said, "I saw him go down, but I
[49:39] never saw him come up." And he had a
[49:41] question within his heart. If a man
[49:43] dies, shall he live again? And God was
[49:46] so rich in mercy. Amen. God put Job on
[49:48] the ash sheep and Job on his ash sheep.
[49:50] While he was on his ash sheep, by by the
[49:53] grace of God, the Bible said Job caught
[49:55] a hold of the revelation. He said, "Go
[49:57] to the skin worms, eat up my flesh, yet
[49:59] in my flesh I shall see God." Did he see
[50:02] him? Oh my, you better believe it. Job
[50:06] was one of those ones that saw him when
[50:08] he got up on the first resurrection
[50:09] morning. Is that right? Amen. The
[50:12] prophet of God said Job came to the door
[50:14] and said, "Hey, come on over here.
[50:16] That's the same one I saw on the ash
[50:18] heap.
[50:20] Amen. So we realize by the grace of God
[50:23] when Jesus said it is finished, he meant
[50:26] exactly what he said. It was finished.
[50:29] So let me say it like this. It's
[50:30] finished. God can't do no more than what
[50:33] he's done already. Amen. And everything
[50:36] that you receive from God, it is up to
[50:38] you to receive it.
[50:40] You got to first believe it, then you
[50:44] must receive it.
[50:46] Hallelujah. Amen. If I was to give you
[50:48] this handkerchief and let's say here it
[50:50] come. It's yours. You might know it's
[50:52] yours because I said it was yours. Amen.
[50:55] And you might believe that it's yours,
[50:57] but it'll never be in your possession
[50:59] until you come and get it. That's how it
[51:02] is with the word of God. God have said
[51:04] it. You believe it, but you got to go
[51:06] get it. I told you I was going to talk
[51:08] about possession. Amen. We are
[51:11] possessors of heaven and earth. And when
[51:14] God gave you the token, it was just, as
[51:17] I say, a part of the whole to show you
[51:20] and to prove to you that not only is
[51:22] earth yours, but heaven is too.
[51:26] Finished. But we're so busy worried and
[51:30] concerned. Oh, I'm going to be lost. Am
[51:32] I going to miss the rapture? I'm going
[51:33] to Listen, let me tell you something.
[51:35] Are you an eagle?
[51:38] You just answered your question then.
[51:40] God came for eagles. Amen. And if you've
[51:44] heard the eagle cry, if God has
[51:46] quickened his life into you, you do not
[51:49] have to worry about it. Listen, because
[51:51] your worry won't change nothing. This
[51:54] have been decided. God has decided and
[51:57] determined who all would make the
[51:58] rapture before the foundation of the
[52:00] world. Now, I want you to understand,
[52:03] Amen. Every age comes with an
[52:07] anointing. Hello. And it is the
[52:11] anointing that makes the individuals do
[52:14] what they're supposed to do of the age.
[52:17] I'm going to say it again. Every age
[52:20] comes with an
[52:22] anointing. And in that
[52:24] anointing is the ability to do what God
[52:28] wants you to do for that age. Every age
[52:30] came up to their part. You say, "Well,
[52:33] brothers, I I can't get to this enough
[52:36] divine love." Well, the divine love is
[52:38] your anointing.
[52:40] And the Bible tells us that love
[52:42] conquers everything.
[52:45] So God had to give you his greatest
[52:47] weapon. And that was the word of God
[52:50] mixed with love. Come on, somebody. And
[52:52] love, amen, conquers all.
[52:57] Oh, come on, somebody. You say, "Well,
[52:59] Lord, I don't have it yet." It don't
[53:01] mean it ain't there. He's given it to
[53:03] you. Come on, somebody. If I was a
[53:06] millionaire and I said, "I've you've
[53:08] inherited."
[53:10] Amen. My estate. You're not going to
[53:13] stay up there in the in in the hills
[53:14] somewhere. Amen. In your little shanty
[53:17] when you know, Amen. By the grace of
[53:19] God, that you've inherited all I've
[53:20] gotten. I got millions. Millions. And
[53:23] all you've got to do is come and and
[53:25] show your identification and prove to
[53:27] the people that you are who you are.
[53:30] That's all you got to do. Amen. When God
[53:33] has given you everything, you all you
[53:36] got to do is show your ID. What is your
[53:38] ID? The Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. And when
[53:41] you show that ID, heaven must recognize
[53:44] who you are. Hell is
[53:49] well. Causes us to triumph. Amen. The
[53:53] Bible said he causes I love that
[53:54] scripture. Causes us to triumph. In
[53:57] other words, when we would fail, God
[54:00] pushes you. God drives you. Come on,
[54:03] somebody. God makes you do it.
[54:06] Hallelujah. Is that the truth? Amen. I
[54:09] was thinking about all of us this
[54:10] morning uh uh and this evening. I said,
[54:13] Lord, I said, if we're not like Gideon,
[54:15] I don't know who Gideon is. Is that
[54:18] right? When God calls us mighty man
[54:20] avail, we always looking around at
[54:21] somebody else and say, maybe he's
[54:23] talking to that person.
[54:25] No, but God is talking to you.
[54:28] Hallelujah. Prove me, he says. Try me,
[54:31] he says. And a lot of time we afraid to
[54:34] prove and trying. Gideon say, if you be
[54:36] God, let this happen. If this is going
[54:38] to be Lord, let this happen. And Lord, I
[54:40] know I done asked you several times, but
[54:42] let this
[54:45] happen. And did God do it? Cuz God
[54:49] wanted Gideon to know who he was. Not
[54:52] the outward man. not this this coward
[54:54] that Satan had convinced him in his mind
[54:57] that he was. He wanted to Gideon to see
[55:00] that he was a mighty man of veiler. And
[55:03] you know that message was not preached
[55:05] amen to denomination. That message was
[55:08] preached to the bride. You must
[55:10] recognize who you
[55:13] are. And God has planted you to destroy
[55:16] the works of the enemy. Come on,
[55:19] somebody. You got to realize that you
[55:21] are the feet of God. Right? You say,
[55:23] "Well, brother, I'm up in the head, but
[55:25] you the feet, too." Right, Joshua?
[55:27] Wherever you plant your feet is yours.
[55:29] Is that right? And man, God has raised
[55:32] you up to prove that you are what he
[55:35] said you are by putting the devil under
[55:38] your feet. I went to the enemy's camp.
[55:41] Well, it's more than that. It is a
[55:45] reality that you and I must come to.
[55:48] Now, the Bible said he did it in secret.
[55:51] No, he didn't. The Bible said he openly
[55:54] triumphed. So, every believer must
[55:57] openly triumph over the devil. There
[55:59] must be a witnesser, a witness
[56:01] somewhere.
[56:05] Come on. Remember I told you when it
[56:07] comes to light, light forces the issue.
[56:11] Light does not ask the darkness to move.
[56:14] It pushes it. It pushes it. It demands
[56:18] that light to move. So much so when the
[56:21] sun gets finished, there's no more
[56:23] darkness. Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[56:26] Now, we look at this thing. You say,
[56:28] "Well, brothers, listen. I was thinking
[56:30] the Bible talk about the lion roar." You
[56:32] know, the lion roars. Amen. When he's
[56:34] got a kill. Is that right? I was
[56:37] thinking about all of the things that I
[56:38] had seen in Africa, you know. going out.
[56:41] We I've seen several times we've come up
[56:43] on uh lion uh clans where they done
[56:45] killed the the the the theuh analopee or
[56:48] whatever the animal was and and they
[56:50] they feeding all of their little cubs.
[56:52] Don't you think when there's ever a
[56:53] kill, the hyenas is not around to steal
[56:56] your your kill, right? The hyenas are
[57:00] there to steal your evidence that you
[57:02] whoop the devil,
[57:04] right? Amen. The hyenas are always
[57:07] there. They're nothing but demonformed
[57:09] animals.
[57:11] As far as I don't think they'll be in
[57:12] heaven. I think I don't know. But my
[57:14] point is, Amen. When it comes to those
[57:17] kind of a things, you look and you say,
[57:18] "Well, brother was what are you saying?"
[57:20] I'm saying the devil like like like I
[57:22] think it was uh with our brother Keith
[57:24] and and the woman, the sister, Amen.
[57:26] that got healed. You know how many times
[57:28] the devil has healed you? I mean, God
[57:30] has healed you and then the devil come
[57:32] back.
[57:34] Huh? He's always coming back to see
[57:36] whether the faith's still there.
[57:38] Hallelujah. Amen. All you got to do is
[57:40] not answer the
[57:43] door. Why answer the door when he start
[57:46] knocking? Don't answer the door. You got
[57:49] what you want.
[57:51] Hallelujah. Amen. So, I said all of that
[57:53] to say this. I think about how Jesus
[57:56] Christ, our lion, killed
[57:59] Satan, destroyed the devil's work, and
[58:02] now he is saying to his cves, "Come
[58:04] feast on the carcass."
[58:07] The devil's dead.
[58:10] You might not think he is, but he is.
[58:12] He's as dead as your faith will put him.
[58:18] A dead man can't do nothing, and Satan
[58:21] can't do nothing unless you allow him to
[58:25] do
[58:26] it. Come on,
[58:30] somebody. Even when it comes test and
[58:33] trials, look what he did. He stripped
[58:35] Job from everything, but he couldn't
[58:37] take his
[58:38] integrity. Huh? God said, "Whatever you
[58:41] do, don't touch the oil and the wine."
[58:44] Hallelujah. Don't touch his life.
[58:47] And you and I are here. We're going to
[58:49] be tried. We're going to be tested.
[58:51] That's why we come. Hello. Is that not
[58:53] what Brother Brandham said? We come the
[58:56] bride to be tested. She must be proven
[58:59] she's bride.
[59:02] And it's okay because you packed the
[59:05] goods. As I said this morning, the blood
[59:08] was a token. Is that right? Now, the
[59:12] life of the blood is a token. Y'all hear
[59:15] what I'm saying? And that life, we
[59:17] wouldn't have known that. That's why
[59:18] denominations, organizations, they think
[59:19] they're under the blood. But you cannot
[59:22] be under the blood without the Holy
[59:24] Ghost.
[59:25] You, up until that point, you are
[59:27] potentially under it.
[59:30] Amen.
[59:31] Y'all hear what I'm saying? If that same
[59:34] spirit be in you that was in Christ
[59:35] Jesus, as it quicken his body, it shall
[59:37] also quicken what? Your mortal body.
[59:40] That's the blood I'm talking about. We
[59:42] were talking by the grace of God. We
[59:44] were talking about a blood
[59:47] transfusion. Now, let me say it like
[59:49] this. Only the true seed of God that has
[59:51] been called to be bride will go into
[59:55] desperation.
[59:56] She's going to get it no matter what the
[1:00:00] cost. She's been ordained to do it. Just
[1:00:03] like Jesus was ordained to go to
[1:00:05] Calvary, she's ordained to get the oil.
[1:00:10] Add extra oil. Hallelujah. She doesn't
[1:00:14] care what it takes. She's like Tamara.
[1:00:17] If she's got to pose like a prostitute
[1:00:19] to get it, she'll get it. Hallelujah.
[1:00:23] Oh, come on, somebody. She's like
[1:00:24] Hannah. If she got to pray and fast for
[1:00:27] days to get it, she's going to get it.
[1:00:31] Y'all hear what I'm saying? Hallelujah.
[1:00:34] She's like the prostitute that went to
[1:00:35] Simon's house. Amen. She's She's
[1:00:38] willing, Amen. to suffer
[1:00:40] ridicule. She's willing, amen, to suffer
[1:00:43] scone. Amen. As long as she can get to
[1:00:46] Jesus, that's all that matters to her.
[1:00:49] See, you ordained for it. Something in
[1:00:51] you will not let you rest. Hallelujah.
[1:00:54] Until you achieve that thing, God seal
[1:00:58] you away.
[1:00:59] Hallelujah. Bring you into a complete
[1:01:03] maturity. I want you to understand by
[1:01:05] the grace of God, there's nothing in you
[1:01:07] that can do it. There's no natural
[1:01:10] element that that can make you do this.
[1:01:13] This is an uncction. This is the Holy
[1:01:14] Spirit. This is the anointing of the
[1:01:16] Lord Jesus. You say, "Well, brother, you
[1:01:18] know, do I have to be in church and feel
[1:01:20] it like you do?" Like, you got to shout
[1:01:22] and cry. No, sir. Jesus stood at the
[1:01:24] pool pit and said, "This day, this
[1:01:26] scripture is fulfilled in your ears."
[1:01:28] There was no shouting. There was no
[1:01:29] dancing. But he was fully anointed by
[1:01:33] the Holy Spirit. Hallelujah. He knew his
[1:01:36] place. He knew where he was headed. And
[1:01:38] he knew what he wanted. Oh, people of
[1:01:40] God, we're not roaming in darkness
[1:01:42] anymore. We are in the light. We're
[1:01:44] children of the light. We're the
[1:01:46] children of the day. We can see the
[1:01:47] enemy. Hallelujah. Like the brother
[1:01:50] said, we know who we are and we know who
[1:01:52] the devil is. Why? Because of the
[1:01:54] message. There are people right now who
[1:01:57] are serving Satan and don't even know
[1:01:59] it.
[1:02:01] How can you How can you listen? The
[1:02:03] Bible said there are churches that are
[1:02:05] literally Amen. have doctrines of
[1:02:07] devils. How can you have doctrines of
[1:02:08] devil and not be worshiping the
[1:02:12] devil? Y'all hear what I'm saying? Amen.
[1:02:15] But it's all grace. Ephesians 2:4 and
[1:02:18] 10. Now, when I say this, you know, a
[1:02:20] lot of time it's hard to bring this
[1:02:22] thing to a balance because a lot of time
[1:02:24] people take grace and make it disgrace.
[1:02:26] I'm not talking about that. I'm talking
[1:02:28] about when a, as you've heard me say
[1:02:30] many times, grace is the time and the
[1:02:34] ability that God gives you to make it
[1:02:36] right. When one day, one time he used to
[1:02:39] kill
[1:02:40] you. You made a mistake, you were dead,
[1:02:43] right? Amen. Somebody, I know y'all
[1:02:45] didn't eat all that kind of food that
[1:02:47] y'all going to not say nothing. Not
[1:02:48] even. Amen. But I'mma preach it anyhow.
[1:02:51] Cuz if I was on there, I'll be
[1:02:53] staggering, too. Amen. But I'm the
[1:02:55] preacher, so I got to stay
[1:02:57] awake. Amen. Ephesians 2, it says, Amen.
[1:03:01] But God who is rich in mercy, for his
[1:03:04] grace love, his grace uh for his grace
[1:03:08] love with with wherewith he loved us,
[1:03:11] right? even when we were dead in sins
[1:03:15] have quickened us together with Christ.
[1:03:17] By grace ye are
[1:03:20] saved. And brother Bradom breaks it down
[1:03:22] like this. He said the blood keeps you
[1:03:28] saved, but grace saves
[1:03:31] you and grace saves you because of
[1:03:35] election. You were chosen in him before
[1:03:38] the foundation of the world. My God.
[1:03:41] Hallelujah. Oh, God pick me. Pick me.
[1:03:44] Pick me. No, he chose me before the
[1:03:47] foundation of the world. I don't have to
[1:03:49] be pleading with God at this point to
[1:03:51] pick me. He He's already chosen those
[1:03:54] who's going who's He's going to
[1:03:56] choose. It's already done. Now, that's
[1:04:00] the point God is trying to get over to
[1:04:01] us. If it's done, you might as well
[1:04:03] enjoy it. Huh? Why worry about something
[1:04:07] that you can't fix? You couldn't fix it
[1:04:09] before you got saved. You can't fix it
[1:04:11] since you got saved. God fix
[1:04:14] it. He's a repairer. He's the builder.
[1:04:17] He's the one. Amen. That have set you
[1:04:26] free. Remember, God is in the house.
[1:04:29] Even when we were dead in sin, have
[1:04:31] quickened us together with Christ. by
[1:04:33] grace you are saved and have raised us
[1:04:36] up together and made us sit together in
[1:04:38] heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in
[1:04:41] the ages to come he might show the
[1:04:44] exceeding riches of his grace in his
[1:04:47] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
[1:04:50] Now I'm going show you that you can't be
[1:04:52] perfect in your flesh because your flesh
[1:04:55] get tired. Your flesh get weak. The word
[1:04:59] is never tired and the word is never
[1:05:01] weak. Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. So,
[1:05:05] you're trying to perfect something that
[1:05:07] can't be perfected. No, you don't
[1:05:09] perfect your flesh. You shut him down.
[1:05:13] Huh? You don't perfect him. You shut him
[1:05:16] down. You stop him from living.
[1:05:20] Paul said, "It's not I that live, but
[1:05:22] Christ that lives in me."
[1:05:25] This flesh, as long as it lives, it will
[1:05:28] be contrary to the word of God. And you
[1:05:31] the only one that can let him have his
[1:05:33] way. It ain't the devil, it's you. All
[1:05:37] of us, your greatest enemy is yourself.
[1:05:40] It ain't the devil, it's you. I'm sorry.
[1:05:42] We got to stop blaming the
[1:05:45] devil. I used to do it. You know the
[1:05:48] devil. The devil ain't made me nothing.
[1:05:49] It was me.
[1:05:54] We give him more credit than he he
[1:05:56] deserve. He probably got his shoulders
[1:05:58] rolled back. said, "My goodness, I'm
[1:06:00] getting getting better all the
[1:06:02] time." Hallelujah. But you must realize,
[1:06:05] amen, when God gives us
[1:06:09] grace by for by grace you are saved
[1:06:12] through faith. Hello. In other words,
[1:06:16] you can't even be saved if your faith
[1:06:18] can't believe
[1:06:20] it. Your faith must believe that you're
[1:06:24] saved. You cannot be saved if your faith
[1:06:28] won't believe it.
[1:06:31] Am I making sense to you? You must first
[1:06:34] Oh, brother, can you prove it? I cannot
[1:06:36] prove it. You're working with the
[1:06:38] supernatural thing here.
[1:06:41] But my faith says I'm saved. My faith
[1:06:44] says I'm healed. My faith says I'm
[1:06:46] delivered. My faith says I'm bride.
[1:06:49] Hallelujah. Glory to God. And nothing
[1:06:52] can take that from me. It is a
[1:06:54] revelation that God gave.
[1:06:58] It is my token to heaven.
[1:07:03] He made a blood covenant with Abraham
[1:07:06] and his seed. Is that right? Oh, listen
[1:07:09] what he said. Amen. In the message,
[1:07:11] Israel and the church, he said, we come
[1:07:14] on down to the eighth verse and God
[1:07:16] promises Abraham here how he's going to
[1:07:18] save him and his seed after him. Now, he
[1:07:20] made it just because that it was
[1:07:22] Abraham. He didn't say, "Now, Abraham,
[1:07:25] if you would do this, if you would do
[1:07:26] that," he said, "Abraham, I've done it
[1:07:29] already. I ain't It ain't nothing you
[1:07:32] got to do. I've done it myself." Amen.
[1:07:36] Oh my. Unconditional. God's covenant is
[1:07:40] unconditional. But most of us treat it
[1:07:43] like it's conditional.
[1:07:45] is almost like a slap in God's face
[1:07:48] because he's telling you what you
[1:07:49] worried about. What you so upset about.
[1:07:53] Amen. I knew you was flesh before you
[1:07:55] got
[1:07:57] here. Huh? It's true. The devil take
[1:08:00] those little things and he he makes you
[1:08:02] strain at it. Listen, let me put it this
[1:08:04] way. Oh, I'm building. I'm building. I'm
[1:08:06] building. But I want you to understand.
[1:08:08] Except the Lord build the house, the
[1:08:10] labors labor in vain. Hallelujah. You
[1:08:13] can't add a cubit to your stature. Not
[1:08:15] one.
[1:08:18] Hallelujah. Glory to God. I guarantee
[1:08:21] you every ant on that ark was
[1:08:24] appreciative. He didn't care about the
[1:08:26] elephant being much bigger than because
[1:08:29] he was glad he was on there. Hallelujah.
[1:08:31] Amen. And why you be somebody else that
[1:08:35] may be more spiritual. They might have
[1:08:37] more faith. They might have more. So
[1:08:39] what?
[1:08:44] Come on. Grace is with you and you must
[1:08:48] accept it. You've got to accept it.
[1:08:52] Y'all hear what I'm saying? Because
[1:08:54] grace is what sets you free. Can I ask
[1:08:57] you a question? How many of y'all woke
[1:09:00] up this morning and as of this point,
[1:09:01] you've done nothing
[1:09:05] wrong? Can I get a witness?
[1:09:11] Y'all hear what I'm saying? It is the
[1:09:13] blood. Y'all hear what I'm saying? It is
[1:09:16] the blood of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:09:19] That keeps us, that protects us, that
[1:09:21] saves us. Oh my God.
[1:09:26] Though your sin be as scarlet,
[1:09:28] though they be red as crimson, he said,
[1:09:31] "I'll make them white as snow."
[1:09:33] Hallelujah.
[1:09:35] God needed that red stuff on you in
[1:09:38] order to put his red stuff together with
[1:09:40] your red stuff to make it white.
[1:09:42] Hallelujah.
[1:09:44] Oh, come on,
[1:09:45] somebody. Oh, Lord. I'm trying my best
[1:09:49] not to shout it. It was so good
[1:09:51] earlier. It
[1:09:54] was It was so good earlier. I'm like,
[1:09:57] Lord, you know, I don't want to work
[1:09:58] with this tamarine beat, but it sure
[1:10:00] work me.
[1:10:04] Glory to his name.
[1:10:07] Amen. Ain't God good to us? Amen. God's
[1:10:12] I'mma tell you, I can beat that tamarine
[1:10:13] sometime and it's just a beating. But
[1:10:16] there are times that bam that tamarine
[1:10:18] takes a dimension to it. It takes me
[1:10:20] somewhere else. Today was one of those
[1:10:22] days. It took me somewhere else and I
[1:10:25] was glad to be there. I was cut short
[1:10:28] for some reason, but I thank God for
[1:10:30] what I got. Hallelujah. It takes I can't
[1:10:33] explain it. I just can't explain it. But
[1:10:36] it takes me I feel myself being
[1:10:41] lifted. Glory to
[1:10:44] God. Now we realize, Amen. We wouldn't
[1:10:47] have known. Brother Brandon brought out
[1:10:49] the uh God's chosen place of worship. We
[1:10:50] wouldn't have known. People, we are so
[1:10:52] blessed to know that there's only one
[1:10:54] place to worship God. Hallelujah.
[1:10:56] Remember, Amen. There were tribes of
[1:10:58] Israel who failed to worship God in
[1:11:00] Jerusalem.
[1:11:02] Where's Where's Jerusalem?
[1:11:04] The new Jerusalem.
[1:11:06] That's your heart, people. That's where
[1:11:08] you worship God now. Hallelujah.
[1:11:11] Trusting that the blood is there. Uh the
[1:11:14] blood must be there. If the blood ain't
[1:11:16] there, you working with judgment.
[1:11:19] Hallelujah. But when the blood has been
[1:11:21] placed on the altar of your heart,
[1:11:23] hallelujah, that's where the worship
[1:11:25] comes in.
[1:11:28] Hallelujah. Listen what he
[1:11:31] says. There was also two covenants.
[1:11:33] Actually, when you think about it,
[1:11:35] Brother Benham also said there was
[1:11:36] three. There was one with uh uh Adam.
[1:11:38] There was one with Noah and also one
[1:11:40] with Moses. There was also two covenants
[1:11:43] given to the people. We're going to
[1:11:44] speak to them in this morning. One of
[1:11:46] them was given to Adam on condition. If
[1:11:48] you do this and don't do that, but that
[1:11:51] was was broken. Adam and Eve broke that
[1:11:54] in the garden. Amen. Is that right? Then
[1:11:57] God made a se second covenant and give
[1:11:59] that to Abraham and that was uh is that
[1:12:02] right?
[1:12:04] That was he well Moses and that was the
[1:12:07] law that Abraham and that was the law of
[1:12:09] unconditional. It isn't what you've done
[1:12:12] or what you will
[1:12:16] do. See you know we should ring our
[1:12:19] hands Lord please save me L. Oh please
[1:12:22] save me. But what you fail to see you
[1:12:24] can plead with God all you want.
[1:12:28] If you ain't in the book, you ain't in
[1:12:30] the book.
[1:12:32] Now, I don't want to scare you because
[1:12:34] see, the devil will take the wrong side
[1:12:36] of that. I'm trying to tell you because
[1:12:38] you have a love for the word of God, you
[1:12:40] may not be measuring up to the scripture
[1:12:43] as yet
[1:12:45] because the life in you is a babe or
[1:12:49] maybe an adolescent or maybe a
[1:12:52] teenager. Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:12:54] But what as you grow and mature in what
[1:12:58] grace? You get stronger. You begin to
[1:13:01] see your features forming and shaping
[1:13:04] into the very image of Christ.
[1:13:08] The more you lay in the presence of the
[1:13:09] sun, the more you begin to see your
[1:13:16] identity. Now, I'm g ask you a question.
[1:13:20] If brother Brandon walks as perfectly as
[1:13:23] as a man as so many people believe, why
[1:13:26] did God tell him he need to be more
[1:13:31] sincere? Huh? Anybody got an answer for
[1:13:34] that? Huh? Brother Brandham always plead
[1:13:36] for mercy and
[1:13:38] grace. Come on, somebody. My point is,
[1:13:41] and as long as he had to do it, and so
[1:13:43] will you. Every man that was born of a
[1:13:47] woman still has to plead for mercy and
[1:13:49] grace. The only one that didn't have to
[1:13:51] do that was Jesus himself.
[1:13:55] I'm not trying to cut you down, but my
[1:13:57] point is I'm trying to see, let you see
[1:14:00] how free you are.
[1:14:03] You've been set free. And your
[1:14:06] imprisonment is in your mind.
[1:14:10] You can do whatever. You're a possessor
[1:14:12] of heaven and earth. That means you own
[1:14:15] it.
[1:14:18] You own us.
[1:14:23] I was told and I've tried it. I've tried
[1:14:25] it. You can try it, too. I was told that
[1:14:27] if you talk to water and tell the water
[1:14:29] how blessed it is and how good it is, it
[1:14:30] gets sweeter. Have you ever tried that?
[1:14:33] It works. It's not a psychological
[1:14:36] thing. It really works.
[1:14:41] Think about it. You got to drink some
[1:14:42] nasty water. Talk to it a little bit.
[1:14:46] It will get
[1:14:48] sweeter. Your words are creative
[1:14:52] and you write in the word when God say
[1:14:54] bless and curse not.
[1:14:58] You're a possessor of heaven and earth.
[1:15:01] Oh, come on, somebody. It's true. It's
[1:15:04] true. It's true. Listen. He promised the
[1:15:08] promise of triumph has always been
[1:15:10] throughout the scriptures hidden within
[1:15:12] the pages of the word. He left it on
[1:15:15] record for the blind, right? When when
[1:15:18] when when when when Abel uh triumphed
[1:15:22] there in the garden, that was left for
[1:15:24] you to show you. And this is what I
[1:15:26] love. Abel had nothing to give God but
[1:15:29] the
[1:15:30] lamb. None of his works, none of that.
[1:15:33] Not he could say nothing else other than
[1:15:36] Lord, the lamb that you the revelation
[1:15:38] that you gave me of this animal, I'm
[1:15:39] giving it back to
[1:15:41] you. That was it. God didn't require
[1:15:44] nothing else. And if that was in the
[1:15:47] beginning, that's in the end. And that's
[1:15:50] what's wrong with a lot of message
[1:15:51] believers. They have worked and worked
[1:15:53] and worked and they tired of working and
[1:15:55] they tired of working. Why don't you
[1:15:57] work and labor to get the Holy Ghost so
[1:16:00] you can enter into his rest?
[1:16:04] When you enter into his rest, Amen.
[1:16:06] Something happens.
[1:16:09] Something happens and you m and you know
[1:16:12] no matter what I go through, I'm in
[1:16:14] safety zone.
[1:16:16] I'm in a safety zone. He's designed it
[1:16:18] that way. I'm in a safety zone. And
[1:16:20] ain't nothing can stop it, can t can
[1:16:22] take that away from me.
[1:16:25] Hallelujah. Do you make mistakes after
[1:16:27] you get the Holy Ghost? Anybody know
[1:16:28] that answer? Amen.
[1:16:33] Hallelujah. I tell you what, I wish
[1:16:35] once, you know, was the Holy Ghost was
[1:16:37] like once you get it, you going to
[1:16:38] heaven. Wouldn't that be wonderful?
[1:16:41] Everybody would have it by
[1:16:43] now. Hallelujah. But that's not it. You
[1:16:46] just get the Holy Ghost. Now you're
[1:16:48] learning how to be a real son, a
[1:16:50] daughter of God. Come on, somebody. Now,
[1:16:53] I'm saying all of these things because
[1:16:55] this was not
[1:16:57] possible one time under Moses there.
[1:17:00] This wasn't possible for all of us to
[1:17:02] enjoy this. The Gentiles had their own
[1:17:04] place to sit or to stand or whatever.
[1:17:06] They were not even allowed in the the
[1:17:08] same congregation with the Jews. They
[1:17:12] were
[1:17:12] procelites. Hallelujah. Women, you
[1:17:15] couldn't even do
[1:17:16] this. You could there was no such thing
[1:17:18] as men and women coming together and
[1:17:20] worshiping God. Huh? That that was under
[1:17:23] the law. Come on, somebody. But because
[1:17:25] of Calvary, you here.
[1:17:28] Oh my God. Because of Calvary, you can
[1:17:30] shout hallelujah.
[1:17:32] Amen. Because of clarity, you can you
[1:17:35] can worship God. You can thank him for
[1:17:37] your deliverance. You say, "Well,
[1:17:38] Brother Brooks, I I I still I I know God
[1:17:41] going to deliver." God has delivered me,
[1:17:43] right? Amen. You say, "Well, it ain't
[1:17:45] made manifest. What that got to do with
[1:17:47] it?"
[1:17:49] Huh? If God said it, it is. So, it don't
[1:17:53] We don't know how long it took the sun
[1:17:54] to manifest when he said, "Let there be
[1:17:57] light."
[1:17:59] We don't know. It had to happen.
[1:18:02] So you just hold on to that. I'm healed.
[1:18:04] I'm delivered. Come on, somebody. Oh my.
[1:18:08] Listen. Not only did Jesus Christ's
[1:18:10] blood bring redemption. And what is
[1:18:12] redemption? We look at when Adam and Eve
[1:18:14] fell, God provided them a lamb for
[1:18:16] salvation. And the sheep skin was
[1:18:19] protection. Hallelujah. He gave them a
[1:18:22] token when he wrapped them in sheep
[1:18:24] skin. And he gave you a token when he
[1:18:27] wrapped you up in sheep skin.
[1:18:29] Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. Amen. You
[1:18:32] say, "Oh, God." I mean, you know, it is
[1:18:34] the atonement. We We didn't, you know, I
[1:18:36] so thank God, anybody like me, sometimes
[1:18:40] you procrastinate. You don't mean to,
[1:18:42] but you just
[1:18:43] do, you know, and and you know, we would
[1:18:46] be in bad shape, you know, having to
[1:18:49] sacrifice these
[1:18:51] animals. We have them all stacked up in
[1:18:53] the barn somewhere. Amen. Well, I'm
[1:18:55] going to get to it at some point in
[1:18:57] time. You see what I'm saying? But you
[1:19:00] don't even have to do that no more
[1:19:01] because of the blood of Jesus.
[1:19:03] Hallelujah. He's been our bull. He's
[1:19:05] been our lamb. He's our dove. He's our
[1:19:07] goat. He's our everything. He's our red
[1:19:10] heer. He's all of that.
[1:19:14] And all we got to do is say, "Lord,
[1:19:16] forgive me." Oh, you can't get it no
[1:19:18] easier than that. That's why brother
[1:19:20] Brando say for in order for a man to go
[1:19:21] to hell, he got to fight his way there.
[1:19:23] You don't easily go to hell. Nobody
[1:19:25] easily go. You got to fight. You got to
[1:19:27] fight God all the way down to the bottom
[1:19:29] of that
[1:19:30] thing. Listen. Healing. Come on,
[1:19:34] somebody. He showed through the blood of
[1:19:35] Jesus. It was go. I love this. Cuz you
[1:19:37] had those lepers. He the blood had not
[1:19:39] even been shed.
[1:19:42] And Jesus healed the lepers. How? By his
[1:19:45] word. See, because it was always the
[1:19:49] life. It was always the life. Amen. That
[1:19:53] gave life.
[1:19:55] Hallelujah. Silver and gold have act
[1:19:57] number. Such as I have give I thee. What
[1:19:59] was he doing? Showing Amen. That the
[1:20:01] bride of Jesus Christ is triumphant over
[1:20:04] the devil under whatever
[1:20:09] circumstances. Anybody know what I'm
[1:20:10] talking about? You know there are some
[1:20:12] of us. Amen. And you know it's true. You
[1:20:15] fight for what's
[1:20:19] yours. Oh, I didn't get enough amens in
[1:20:22] it. Amen. Amen. Amen. I'll say it
[1:20:24] myself. Amen. Because it's true. When
[1:20:27] something is yours, you just don't
[1:20:29] easily let it go.
[1:20:32] Like I was telling somebody, if God gave
[1:20:34] you a job, and the man said, "Well, you
[1:20:35] know, I got to let you go." You need to
[1:20:36] say, "Hold up. You can't let me go."
[1:20:38] Shock him a little bit. You can't let me
[1:20:41] go cuz God gave me this job. Did he tell
[1:20:43] you
[1:20:45] that? He might think you crazy, but I
[1:20:47] guarantee you, he'll think about it
[1:20:49] before he do it.
[1:20:52] I'm telling you, I don't care how rich a
[1:20:55] sinner might be. When you start bringing
[1:20:57] God in the equation, those demons get
[1:20:59] scared.
[1:21:04] Yes, they do. They think you have crazy
[1:21:06] anyhow, but you going to approach me
[1:21:07] like
[1:21:08] that. I'm telling you, learn to put God
[1:21:11] in the equation. When you put God in,
[1:21:14] did God tell you to see? I know God gave
[1:21:16] me this job. I prayed for this job. my
[1:21:18] fasting and God gave me this job. Did
[1:21:21] God tell you to fire
[1:21:25] me? If God told me to told you to fire
[1:21:28] me, you safe. But if he didn't, you in
[1:21:33] trouble. They going to think you crazy
[1:21:35] anyhow. You might as well leave your
[1:21:37] reputation pure,
[1:21:39] right? It's the truth. Amen. So, we look
[1:21:42] at this thing and say, "Well, Lord,
[1:21:44] that's what they did. The children of
[1:21:45] Israel and the the saints of God weren't
[1:21:47] afraid of Satan. They knew who owned.
[1:21:50] And when you know who owned, you know
[1:21:53] you're the owner.
[1:21:56] Oh, did not did not was it Herod said,
[1:21:58] "Don't you know I have the ability to
[1:22:00] pilot?" He said, "Don't you know I have
[1:22:01] the ability to take your life?" Jesus
[1:22:02] said, "Hold up now. You ain't got
[1:22:04] nothing. You don't have no power. What
[1:22:07] all you got is what my father gave you."
[1:22:11] Right? He straightened them right out.
[1:22:13] The word straighten them right out. I'm
[1:22:16] telling you, these demons have come and
[1:22:18] tried to take your possession when God
[1:22:21] have already told you whatsoever you ask
[1:22:24] for, it's yours. It's yours. And when
[1:22:27] God give it, he'll let you know when to
[1:22:30] move on.
[1:22:31] I believe
[1:22:32] that. Now, I don't know who I'm talking
[1:22:34] to, but may God bless you. The lamb of
[1:22:38] God, the lamb, the blood was a covering
[1:22:39] for Adam and Eve. Is that right? And we
[1:22:41] spoke on that this morning a little bit
[1:22:43] on the token because you got to realize
[1:22:45] when God gives you something, amen, is
[1:22:47] as is as powerful as God
[1:22:52] himself. Let's put it this way. Like we
[1:22:55] said last last
[1:22:58] week, we have God who is our father. And
[1:23:02] the Bible said every good and perfect
[1:23:04] gift come from God. Now I don't know
[1:23:07] about you, but I am a good and perfect
[1:23:09] gift.
[1:23:13] Hello. I ain't talking about this old
[1:23:15] flesh. I'm talking about the inner man.
[1:23:17] I am a good and perfect gift. How you
[1:23:19] know? Because the prophet God told us
[1:23:22] that God gave me to Jesus Christ as a
[1:23:25] love gift.
[1:23:27] And you got to be a good and perfect
[1:23:29] gift before God can give you to Jesus.
[1:23:31] If that makes sense. Y'all hear what I'm
[1:23:34] saying? I don't care what I look
[1:23:37] like. Amen. So when you know that you
[1:23:40] are a good and perfect gift that comes
[1:23:43] from where? The father of lights. That
[1:23:47] means you are a light.
[1:23:49] Did you know that when the Holy Ghost
[1:23:52] comes into you, he blasts out all the
[1:23:54] darkness and he fills you with his own
[1:23:57] light? That's what brother say. God even
[1:24:00] gets rid of the cosmic light and
[1:24:03] replaces the cosmic light with his
[1:24:05] light. Find it. It's there.
[1:24:08] removes the cosmic light and put his
[1:24:12] light in you.
[1:24:17] And if God puts his light in me, guess
[1:24:20] what? I'm more I'm brighter than the
[1:24:22] sun.
[1:24:25] Oh my God.
[1:24:28] Possessors.
[1:24:30] Possessors. Are you a possessor this
[1:24:33] evening? Possessors. You know, he he
[1:24:36] even taught the children. He said,
[1:24:37] "Don't go go to school and cheat on your
[1:24:39] test." He said, "Pray over
[1:24:42] it. You study and pray and God will give
[1:24:45] it to you because it's
[1:24:53] yours." He's just trying to say
[1:24:56] amen. Amen. So, when you and I realize,
[1:25:00] Amen. that God has made us triumphant.
[1:25:02] Now, listen. The Bible says according to
[1:25:05] Romans 8, the spirit itself bear witness
[1:25:08] with our spirit that we are the children
[1:25:12] of God. And there be anybody that don't
[1:25:15] like the Holy Ghost, something's wrong
[1:25:17] with their
[1:25:18] spirit. Hallelujah. I don't care if the
[1:25:20] Holy Ghost fall on a child, I'm going to
[1:25:21] get out there with them.
[1:25:24] Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. Yeah. I I
[1:25:26] I tell you what, I I I I see these
[1:25:29] children. Amen. and they be shouting and
[1:25:30] praising God and ain't no music, ain't
[1:25:32] no church service. And I think that's
[1:25:34] exactly what we ought to be doing. Why
[1:25:36] is it it on their minds and it's not on
[1:25:39] ours? Huh? Come on, somebody. And we,
[1:25:42] oh, don't do that. No, let them play
[1:25:44] like that or whatever they doing. Leave
[1:25:46] them
[1:25:47] alone cuz you know the devil ain't got
[1:25:49] them worshiping God.
[1:25:53] Oh my, I know I'm off my track
[1:25:55] now, but that's okay. Brother Benham
[1:25:59] says, "Amen." In the message Patton's
[1:26:01] vision, he said, "What happens when two
[1:26:02] omnipotence meet?" When God and man
[1:26:05] comes together, two omnipotence come,
[1:26:07] omnipotence, something's got to shake.
[1:26:09] Whatever you say with that creative
[1:26:11] power of omnipotence of God, knowing
[1:26:14] that he's promised it, and he said it in
[1:26:17] his word, it creates a power that goes
[1:26:20] out yonder and bring things to pass. I
[1:26:23] believe
[1:26:24] that. You say, "Well, brothers, are you
[1:26:27] crazy?" Maybe I am. But I was telling
[1:26:29] somebody the other day, I said, "All of
[1:26:31] my children, they, you know, they don't
[1:26:32] realize it, but they locked
[1:26:34] in. Faith unlocked them
[1:26:39] in." Faith unlocked them in. It's almost
[1:26:41] like a spaceship. They don't know where
[1:26:43] they going, but I know where it's taking
[1:26:45] them. Y'all hear what I'm saying? Faith.
[1:26:48] And when you speak that thing, it's got
[1:26:50] to go. I don't care how long it takes,
[1:26:53] but it's got to It's like a boomerang.
[1:26:55] It got to come back to you. Amen. Amen.
[1:26:57] And you say, "Well, brother, it look
[1:26:59] like it's chaotic. It can't be changed."
[1:27:01] I don't care what the devil says. I
[1:27:03] don't believe my eyes. I don't believe
[1:27:05] my ears. I don't believe my smell. I
[1:27:08] don't believe my taste. I don't believe
[1:27:10] nothing. Amen. When it's contrary to the
[1:27:13] word, I don't believe it.
[1:27:15] I don't care what my senses can
[1:27:18] produce. Y'all hear what I'm saying? I
[1:27:22] look at this thing and I said, "Oh, Lord
[1:27:24] God." I said if if Job can pray and hold
[1:27:26] his children intact, I can too. Y'all
[1:27:30] y'all getting quiet. Y'all getting
[1:27:31] quiet. How else I'm going to
[1:27:33] preach. Hallelujah. Amen. You know, it's
[1:27:37] the truth. Sometime it's the sometime I
[1:27:39] I put it this way. You know, it's it's
[1:27:40] it's really Let me move on. Let me move
[1:27:43] on. If children then hes of God, joint
[1:27:46] hes with Christ, or so be that we suffer
[1:27:49] with him that we may also be glorified
[1:27:53] together. The thing is it's hard to
[1:27:55] suffer with
[1:27:56] him. Huh? You know, you want people, you
[1:27:59] know, it's hard. Amen. People listen, I
[1:28:02] don't care if they don't accept me. I'm
[1:28:03] too old to be looking for people
[1:28:07] acceptance. Honestly, I'm might as well
[1:28:10] be a Christian. That's what I want to
[1:28:12] be. That's what I'm going to be. That's
[1:28:14] what I am. Right? But y'all know how it
[1:28:16] is. Even in my own walk there in my
[1:28:19] early stage, you know, you almost
[1:28:20] compromise a little bit just to be
[1:28:22] accepted.
[1:28:24] Anybody know what I'm talking about? I'm
[1:28:27] too old for that. You get what you you
[1:28:29] know what you see is what you get. Y'all
[1:28:31] hear what I'm saying? And that's what
[1:28:32] I'm saying. Somewhere along the line, we
[1:28:35] must come to that
[1:28:37] maturity where no matter it m it doesn't
[1:28:39] matter what people think of you. Oh,
[1:28:41] come on, somebody. You're free.
[1:28:44] I can't say it enough.
[1:28:47] Listen, it it would look strange for a
[1:28:50] cow to try to act like a sheep or a
[1:28:52] sheep to try to act like a cow. You and
[1:28:54] I must be who we are. If we're sheep, be
[1:28:57] sheep. If we're cows, be cows. Am I
[1:29:00] making
[1:29:06] sense? I wish I could truly say that
[1:29:08] I've walked this Christian walk and
[1:29:10] never stumbled or
[1:29:11] fell. Did I say that right? Stumbled or
[1:29:14] fall. Amen, fellas. Right. Amen.
[1:29:17] Sometime I get mixed up in my old ways.
[1:29:19] But my I'm not old. I'm just talking.
[1:29:22] But point is this
[1:29:24] people, when it comes to us
[1:29:26] understanding, and that's the hardest
[1:29:28] thing. This is what I'm trying to get us
[1:29:30] to see. God has paid the price for our
[1:29:34] identity. Right? Sin made us think we
[1:29:38] were sinners. You know, sin made us
[1:29:41] think and believe we were of no good.
[1:29:44] Sin was unfair to us, not God. Sin. You
[1:29:48] were born in sin, right? And and and and
[1:29:52] you know, sin, you know, we can look at
[1:29:53] it and say, "Oh, but life has not been
[1:29:55] fair only because of sin." And now God
[1:29:58] is saying, "I'm offering you true life
[1:30:01] where this thing can change from being
[1:30:04] unfair to fair.
[1:30:06] I'm trying to give you a new
[1:30:09] beginning." Right? This is what God is
[1:30:11] saying. I can't do it except you believe
[1:30:14] me, except you trust me, except you
[1:30:17] receive me. It cannot work. See, it it's
[1:30:21] just that simple. But I know who you
[1:30:23] are. And my whole point I'm trying to
[1:30:26] get over to you that you're not just men
[1:30:29] and women, but you're sons and daughters
[1:30:32] of God, made created in my image. Amen.
[1:30:35] You have been made. You have been built
[1:30:38] to be triumphant and not not not not
[1:30:41] defeated. You are those who I have
[1:30:44] chosen. Amen. To triumph over death
[1:30:47] himself.
[1:30:49] That's what God is trying to get over to
[1:30:52] us.
[1:30:53] Amen. That these little trials that we
[1:30:55] go through is child's play is nothing.
[1:30:58] We fail to see the spoken word that's
[1:31:00] within us. How many times we have
[1:31:03] stopped the cars? Let me ask you a
[1:31:05] question. How many times you've ever
[1:31:07] been in a wreck accident and before you
[1:31:10] know it you say Jesus and it stops or
[1:31:14] you say Jesus and the accident is not as
[1:31:16] bad as it could have
[1:31:18] been because you put the element Jesus
[1:31:20] in there. H how many times you prayed
[1:31:25] and the fever was so high and all of a
[1:31:26] sudden it's gone. Huh? Who did that?
[1:31:30] Jesus. That same faith that you take or
[1:31:34] you think you don't have
[1:31:36] operates when you least expect it. My
[1:31:39] wife was in pain last night in her back
[1:31:42] and she woke up and said, "Pray for me."
[1:31:43] And she said her testimony was that when
[1:31:45] I laid my hand and prayed for her, he
[1:31:48] she said, "I had it somewhere on her
[1:31:49] head." She says, "No, put it where the
[1:31:50] pain is." She said the pain left her
[1:31:52] immediately. Now listen people, that was
[1:31:54] not Brother Brooks. Brother Brooks's
[1:31:57] man's side was half sleepy.
[1:32:01] You see what I'm saying? But I said,
[1:32:03] "Lord Jesus, help me pray." And I prayed
[1:32:06] and God respected the prayer and healed
[1:32:09] her.
[1:32:11] See, but those things are in you. Not
[1:32:14] just in me, they in you. And we got to
[1:32:17] put it to test. Put it into a place
[1:32:19] where you say, "Well, what do you mean?"
[1:32:20] Whenever there's a controversy, whenever
[1:32:22] there's a trial, whether there Satan
[1:32:24] comes, he is God's ordained.
[1:32:29] God ordained? What do you mean? It's
[1:32:31] like It's like David and
[1:32:33] Goliath, right? It was God ordained. God
[1:32:38] knew that he was going to send David out
[1:32:39] there to whoop Goliath. David was the
[1:32:42] last one to know
[1:32:45] that. You see what I'm saying? What do
[1:32:48] you mean? I'm saying this and I'm gonna
[1:32:49] say this in a way that you can all
[1:32:51] understand it. Every one of us have been
[1:32:54] tested and tried with
[1:32:58] some
[1:33:01] habit, some bad habit, something that
[1:33:04] has encased
[1:33:06] us. Now, I'm going I'm going to shock
[1:33:08] you now because I want you to know that
[1:33:10] God did that. God allowed that to be
[1:33:14] knowing the seed of God was in you.
[1:33:17] He allowed that to be there.
[1:33:21] Hello. Like the woman, Amen, that was
[1:33:24] put out of the house who was a
[1:33:25] prostitute.
[1:33:26] Come on. The woman at the well. Come on,
[1:33:28] somebody. God allowed that to happen
[1:33:31] because down the road he was going to
[1:33:32] meet her at Samaria.
[1:33:35] Y'all hear what I'm saying? And those
[1:33:37] bad habits, you think, "Oh my God, I'm
[1:33:39] just such a wicked man." God allowed it.
[1:33:43] Hello. Now, you say, "Oh, that can't be
[1:33:45] the true." Let me put it this way. God
[1:33:47] chose Peter and he knew he had a hot
[1:33:49] temper.
[1:33:52] God needed that hot temper. Amen. To
[1:33:54] show Peter, man live by the word and not
[1:33:57] by the sword.
[1:34:00] God knew he was going to get that hot
[1:34:02] temper out of Peter. Come on, somebody.
[1:34:04] But he needed that hot temper. Amen.
[1:34:06] Because in God's mind, there was a
[1:34:09] soldier who had to need he needed his
[1:34:11] ear cut off. And Peter was ordained to
[1:34:14] do it.
[1:34:16] I know it sound I'm trying to tell y'all
[1:34:19] why he allowed it to be so. Cuz he has
[1:34:22] confidence that once you get the Holy
[1:34:24] Spirit, you will overcome it.
[1:34:30] That's your jail house. That's my jail
[1:34:32] house. Amen. Anybody know what I'm
[1:34:34] talking about? But God ordained it and
[1:34:36] allowed it to happen. Why could God do
[1:34:38] that? because he wanted to show the
[1:34:40] devil, no matter what you put on my
[1:34:42] seed, they're
[1:34:44] overcomers. If I can conquer death,
[1:34:46] hell, and the grave, they can conquer
[1:34:48] this, they can conquer that, they can
[1:34:49] conquer this, they can conquer that.
[1:34:51] Because I got the chief demon. Huh? God
[1:34:54] got the chief demon.
[1:34:58] And once God put his Holy Ghost in you,
[1:35:01] you can conquer everything. Let me let
[1:35:03] me ask you a question. And if you don't
[1:35:05] believe that, how you going to be
[1:35:06] raptured? Right? If you don't believe
[1:35:08] that, how you going to want if you die,
[1:35:10] how you going to get up? If that Holy
[1:35:12] Ghost on earth while you living can't
[1:35:15] conquer the devil, how he's going to
[1:35:17] conquer death, right?
[1:35:19] Can I ask you that? How is he going to
[1:35:22] conquer death? Come on. If you can't
[1:35:24] have faith that God can overcome cancer
[1:35:26] or overcome high blood pressure or
[1:35:28] overcome these diseases, amen, that
[1:35:30] Satan put on
[1:35:33] us. Now, I believe
[1:35:35] it and I've been faced with all kinds of
[1:35:38] stuff, but God has given me grace. Now,
[1:35:40] I'm not tired. Listen, I'm gonna tell
[1:35:42] you something. So, we before I go on
[1:35:44] you, he causes you to triumph.
[1:35:49] The problem is we don't know how to say,
[1:35:51] "Lord, I'm
[1:35:53] weak. I can't do it. Lord, I I can't. I
[1:35:57] done tried
[1:35:58] it." Come on, somebody. But let me tell
[1:36:02] you something. I say it like this. But
[1:36:04] when that revelation drops in your
[1:36:05] heart, now it is the time. No devil in
[1:36:09] hell can take it from you.
[1:36:12] And you won't have to fear. There won't
[1:36:13] be no fear. There won't be any fear.
[1:36:16] When God drops that revelation on you,
[1:36:19] you like David going after the after
[1:36:22] that giant. Amen. That's the way it is.
[1:36:25] But you when you try to do it yourself,
[1:36:27] you're going to always be shaking and
[1:36:28] trembling cuz you're uncertain. But when
[1:36:31] God does it, you become a warrior.
[1:36:36] [Music]
[1:36:38] Now, that was sweet to me. Y'all didn't
[1:36:40] taste that.
[1:36:42] I'm trying to tell you. I'm trying to
[1:36:44] tell you that. So, so you can you can't
[1:36:46] think that you've been a mistake. You're
[1:36:47] not a mistake. You're beautiful in the
[1:36:50] eyes of God. And God ain't worried. Oh
[1:36:52] my God, I'm just wondering whether she
[1:36:54] going to be able to do it. God ain't
[1:36:55] worried about that because he knows that
[1:36:56] everything has an appointed time.
[1:37:00] Everything has a season. Everything has
[1:37:02] an appointed time.
[1:37:04] Am I making sense? You're a possessor.
[1:37:07] And God is grooming every one of us in
[1:37:10] here. He's building us and making us.
[1:37:12] Well, you say, "Well, brother, you know,
[1:37:14] I I've tried and you know, listen, every
[1:37:16] one of us have gone through that."
[1:37:17] Anybody know what I'm talking
[1:37:19] about? I remember when I first heard the
[1:37:22] statue of a perfect man. I tried and I
[1:37:24] tried and I tried and I tried and I
[1:37:26] tried.
[1:37:29] And the more I tried, the more
[1:37:31] discouraged I
[1:37:32] got. Many times I thought my I might as
[1:37:35] well just hang it up. It ain't going to
[1:37:37] happen. But then when I heard and
[1:37:39] understood it wasn't me trying, it was
[1:37:41] God
[1:37:44] adding. Come on, somebody. Amen. And
[1:37:47] when I when I realized, Amen. You know
[1:37:49] what I'm saying? is like going to Burger
[1:37:50] King or or going to some one of those
[1:37:53] restaurant and and you know they they
[1:37:55] making your
[1:37:56] burger. You say that you either say, "I
[1:37:58] want pickles, lettuce, tomatoes. I don't
[1:38:00] want to make no matter hungry, but I
[1:38:01] want pickles, lettuce, tomatoes. This is
[1:38:03] the way I want it." Right. And they're
[1:38:05] going to make it the way you want it.
[1:38:07] Right. Right. Amen. So that's how it is
[1:38:09] with
[1:38:11] God. God got all you need. All you got
[1:38:14] to go there and says, "Lord, this is the
[1:38:16] way I want it." Right. And he knows
[1:38:18] you're going to ask according to his
[1:38:20] will. Fix it this way, Lord. Put a
[1:38:22] little bit of this on that quick.
[1:38:25] Come on. It's the truth. These natural
[1:38:28] things are typing something. They're not
[1:38:30] just here to be there. But God is
[1:38:32] showing he's the storehouse. He's the
[1:38:34] one you need to come to. And you need to
[1:38:37] be the one that come to God and said,
[1:38:38] "Lord, here's my
[1:38:40] order." Oh,
[1:38:44] you know that's what he wants.
[1:38:48] You know, I put it that way. Gideon
[1:38:50] wasn't shy about telling God how
[1:38:51] cowardly he
[1:38:54] was. Y'all got quiet. He really wasn't.
[1:38:57] He I can't do it. He said, "Lord, they
[1:38:59] come up and they eat and it's more than
[1:39:00] me and this and that and this and that."
[1:39:02] You know what I mean? Every time I try
[1:39:03] to get it every harvest time, they come
[1:39:05] and steal my
[1:39:06] stuff. How many times you felt like you
[1:39:10] was f to go to another level and the
[1:39:11] devil come and snatch it? Who was that?
[1:39:15] The same spirits Gideon was fighting
[1:39:17] coming during your harvest time when you
[1:39:20] should be collecting and bringing more
[1:39:22] God in. He comes and steal it from you.
[1:39:26] Huh? And God says, "Uh-uh. You going to
[1:39:28] have to learn how to fight back." Who
[1:39:31] me? Yes, you. But Lord, I've been a
[1:39:33] weakling all this time. Every time it
[1:39:35] just something happened. God said, "But
[1:39:37] you're a mighty man available. You can
[1:39:39] do this thing." Hallelujah.
[1:39:42] Oh, come on, somebody. Amen. We've been
[1:39:45] letting the devil whoop us up so much
[1:39:47] we, you know, we're like Gideon, hiding
[1:39:48] from him. Amen. And while we hiding, our
[1:39:51] loved ones are suffering. Come on,
[1:39:53] somebody. Because that's what was
[1:39:55] happening to Gideon. He was allowing the
[1:39:57] enemy to steal all his crop. And his
[1:39:59] loved ones was the ones that were going
[1:40:01] hungry. He got tired of it. And maybe
[1:40:04] this is what God is trying to get us to
[1:40:05] do. Get tired of this devil. Amen. That
[1:40:08] torments us and beat us around at times.
[1:40:11] Oh, you say, "Not me, huh?
[1:40:14] all of
[1:40:15] us. Satan comes in. If it wasn't for the
[1:40:17] grace of God, that's why you got to
[1:40:19] realize I'm never alone.
[1:40:21] I've got a host of angels with me. And
[1:40:23] the problem is, what's wrong with you?
[1:40:25] Amen. And I I put it this way. If you
[1:40:27] have been in a gang, come on. And and
[1:40:29] and and somebody going to come and jump
[1:40:31] you. What's going to happen? They just
[1:40:33] going to look around and say, "Oh, I
[1:40:34] think you can handle this." No. They may
[1:40:37] know you can handle it, but everybody
[1:40:39] want a piece of the action.
[1:40:41] That's the way it is. And that's how it
[1:40:44] is with the angels of the Lord. Come on,
[1:40:45] somebody. All you got to do is say,
[1:40:47] "Lord, help me." That's all you need.
[1:40:51] Remember I told you, amen, that when you
[1:40:53] say Jesus, that means angels and all.
[1:40:56] The Bible said the whole heaven and
[1:40:57] earth is named after him. So when you
[1:40:59] call Jesus, all your hosts come and say,
[1:41:01] "What? What? What's next? Just tell me
[1:41:04] what to do." Because remember, Amen. The
[1:41:07] prophet God said all Jesus had to do was
[1:41:09] move one finger and said destroy. He
[1:41:11] said and the angels would have destroyed
[1:41:13] everything. He said they were all in the
[1:41:15] trees. Nobody could see them but that's
[1:41:17] where they were. So many of them they
[1:41:18] were hanging out in the
[1:41:20] trees. Hallelujah. And that's what you
[1:41:23] got to realize. You are encompassed. The
[1:41:25] Bible said the angel not angels but the
[1:41:29] angel who is the
[1:41:31] host. He is the Lord of hosts. The
[1:41:34] angel.
[1:41:37] of the Lord in
[1:41:40] camp that the the top
[1:41:45] angel about them that fear. Can I can I
[1:41:48] just give one more couple more quotes
[1:41:49] and then I I'll be done because I want
[1:41:52] you to understand you didn't have this
[1:41:53] ability before. You didn't have this
[1:41:55] opportunity to whip the devil. The devil
[1:41:57] whipped mankind for 4,000 years and some
[1:42:00] if I want to put it that way. But since
[1:42:02] Calvary, God has given us the armor of
[1:42:05] the word to put on the whole armor. He
[1:42:08] placed us in the battle and say you can
[1:42:10] do it. Paul said you're more than a
[1:42:13] conqueror. I have confidence in you that
[1:42:15] you are a
[1:42:19] victor through Christ Jesus. Oh Lord,
[1:42:22] the devil scared of him like he was
[1:42:24] yesterday.
[1:42:27] today.
[1:42:28] He said, "Then God the Father in his
[1:42:30] universe, God in his son, God in his
[1:42:32] word, and now God in his people."
[1:42:34] Hallelujah. That quickening immortal
[1:42:36] life that pull you out of that and
[1:42:39] drinking and carrying on through your
[1:42:41] life. That's God and his people. That
[1:42:44] thing that when the Holy Ghost take the
[1:42:46] word of God and sprays it over the
[1:42:48] people like that with his power, that
[1:42:50] heart of yours grabs it with it and it's
[1:42:54] God in his people. He said, "And God
[1:42:57] purposed to prove his word, the truth."
[1:43:00] There was only one man that could do
[1:43:02] that, and that was Jesus. And he come
[1:43:04] and prove that to be the truth. It
[1:43:07] sealed it. And that broke all the seals
[1:43:10] of gloom and gathered all the
[1:43:12] superstitions of other religions and so
[1:43:15] forth. Where great men has raised up and
[1:43:18] said great, marvelous things, but
[1:43:20] they're everyone in the grave. But our
[1:43:23] Christian religion is the only one who
[1:43:25] has an empty tomb. And that proves to me
[1:43:28] that he is the God of the dead and the
[1:43:31] living. That he could raise up the dead
[1:43:34] back to life again. And this quickening
[1:43:37] power, quickening spirit of his has
[1:43:40] proved through the years that he's
[1:43:42] the my he is the one who can quicken the
[1:43:46] dead back to life. Now, if he can
[1:43:50] quicken it, what can he do for me that
[1:43:52] I'm living
[1:43:55] now? The Holy Spirit is here on earth
[1:43:58] looking out those individuals that God
[1:44:01] has ordained to life in this age. How
[1:44:03] many of y'all believe that God ordained
[1:44:04] you to life? I believe that with all my
[1:44:07] heart, people of God, sometime the devil
[1:44:09] get on my back and listen, he calls me a
[1:44:12] hypocrite, too. Anybody in here get that
[1:44:14] call?
[1:44:16] All you got to do is make one
[1:44:18] mistake. You ain't nothing but ever
[1:44:20] create. Oh, you don't even have to. It
[1:44:22] don't have to be an outward mistake. You
[1:44:24] could just allow a thought to come and
[1:44:26] linger too long and he said, "You ain't
[1:44:28] nothing but old
[1:44:32] devil. I know him cuz he talked to me
[1:44:35] too." Same devil, same language.
[1:44:39] Hallelujah. But the Bible said, "If you
[1:44:41] resist the devil, he'll fe from you."
[1:44:43] I want to get so crazy and fanatical
[1:44:45] about God. And I I know that word
[1:44:47] fanatical don't go well with some
[1:44:48] people, but you know what I'm saying? I
[1:44:50] really want to go I just I'm saying,
[1:44:52] "Lord, get me out of this old prideful
[1:44:54] flesh, this old flesh of mine that
[1:44:56] hinders me." Amen. Because I don't I
[1:44:59] listen, I want the devil to know who
[1:45:01] side I'm on. I don't want no guess work
[1:45:03] with him. I want him to know for a
[1:45:05] certain whose side I'm on. Y'all hear
[1:45:08] what I'm saying? And you you you see the
[1:45:10] devil, he coming and you know he almost
[1:45:12] kind of sometime how many have
[1:45:14] experienced you know he he he almost
[1:45:16] shut your mouth when you get ready to
[1:45:18] praise God. You going to give a praise
[1:45:20] and he you can almost feel like you got
[1:45:22] to fight through
[1:45:25] it. Now I've had that experience more
[1:45:28] than once. Amen. But I tell you what,
[1:45:30] when you open your mouth, Amen. the
[1:45:33] power of God comes down. That's right.
[1:45:36] Now the Holy Spirit is here on earth
[1:45:38] looking out those individuals that God
[1:45:40] has ordained to life in this age. As
[1:45:42] soon as it finds it, it does just like
[1:45:45] it did on Jesus Christ, the great super
[1:45:47] son of God who redeemed us all. It comes
[1:45:50] down and it takes place of a bold into
[1:45:53] the human life. Now notice brought uh
[1:45:57] bold uh brought the quickening power.
[1:45:59] Now that quickening uh power that comes
[1:46:02] upon Jesus quicken him to manifest every
[1:46:06] promise of the word of that day. So does
[1:46:09] the Holy Spirit that comes upon us in
[1:46:12] this day. If it is not a mockery Holy
[1:46:15] Spirit. So you got mockery Holy Spirit.
[1:46:19] But is but if the real true Holy Spirit
[1:46:22] is manifest the promise of your hour.
[1:46:25] That's right. It will manifest the
[1:46:27] promise of your hour. Right. He said,
[1:46:29] "Now, now that that's what we must
[1:46:31] understand." Amen. This that we're we're
[1:46:34] looking to see and to make sure that the
[1:46:37] Holy Ghost that we got is not a mockery
[1:46:38] Holy
[1:46:39] Spirit. It's got to be the real one.
[1:46:42] Amen. That's going to produce, Amen. the
[1:46:46] word for this day in this hour.
[1:46:50] Hallelujah. Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:46:52] That is what make you who you are,
[1:46:55] right? The real Holy Ghost make you his
[1:46:58] own.
[1:46:59] Right? And if you are his own, you are
[1:47:03] omnipotent. You're victorious. You're
[1:47:06] triumphant. Come on, somebody. You're
[1:47:08] perfect.
[1:47:14] You don't have to call me perfect. He
[1:47:15] called me perfect. When he gave me his
[1:47:18] Holy Ghost, he said, "You
[1:47:19] perfect." But brother, I saw you do
[1:47:22] something. What you saw, you ain't see
[1:47:25] nothing. Is that the word? The Bible
[1:47:28] said, "Ain't nobody going to be able to
[1:47:29] stand in judgment against me, who going
[1:47:31] to lay in a charge to God's elect?"
[1:47:33] Hallelujah. What accusation you going to
[1:47:35] say you saw me do? Huh? Come on,
[1:47:37] somebody. When God has justified me so
[1:47:40] as though I've never sinned in the first
[1:47:41] place. Now, that's a that's a that's a
[1:47:44] that's a deeper ram that I'm working
[1:47:46] with now because I'm going to tell you
[1:47:48] something. Your eyes will be able to
[1:47:50] declare something that you thought you
[1:47:51] saw.
[1:47:54] But when God put it up on the screen if
[1:47:58] it's
[1:47:59] confessed, there won't be no evidence
[1:48:01] that it ever
[1:48:02] existed. So where will your proof be?
[1:48:08] Y'all hear what I'm saying? There will
[1:48:09] be no proof. There will be no
[1:48:13] proof. Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:48:14] because God won't even remember it once
[1:48:17] it's put in the sea of
[1:48:21] forgetfulness. You know what brother
[1:48:23] Brandham said and I'm closing. He said
[1:48:26] those people that worship the devil
[1:48:28] don't know what they
[1:48:30] doing. And he just wasn't talking about
[1:48:32] outright devil worshippers. He was
[1:48:34] talking about church
[1:48:35] people. Church
[1:48:38] people. Hello. And you've heard me say
[1:48:42] this, and it's so true. Before Satan
[1:48:46] thought, God thought. God's thoughts was
[1:48:50] the only thought there ever
[1:48:51] was until Satan
[1:48:54] thought. And when Satan thought, he
[1:48:57] thought differently away from God.
[1:49:00] Hello. And when he thought different
[1:49:03] from
[1:49:04] God, it was the thing that caused all
[1:49:07] this ruckus.
[1:49:09] It caused the fall of angels and it
[1:49:11] caused the fall of
[1:49:13] man. Understand? That's why the Bible
[1:49:16] said man does not live by word bread
[1:49:18] alone but by every word which is every
[1:49:21] thought of God. That's how man live. Oh
[1:49:25] come on somebody. And so you and I must
[1:49:28] align our thoughts to his
[1:49:30] thoughts. But really if the Holy Ghost
[1:49:32] is in you his thoughts will become your
[1:49:34] thoughts. Let's
[1:49:36] stand. I don't know. Oh, I just said it
[1:49:38] like this. People of God, I I felt like
[1:49:41] God was prophesying here tonight. But
[1:49:44] I'm going to tell you something. We are
[1:49:45] in a position right now. You going to
[1:49:47] have to know who you are.
[1:49:50] With the world going falling apart like
[1:49:52] it is and uh Mexico just had another
[1:49:55] earthquake the other day. Uh we are now
[1:49:58] in a position, Amen. this world is
[1:50:00] falling apart. You see how the how how
[1:50:02] over in Yellowstone the buffaloos and
[1:50:04] everything running trying to find
[1:50:06] safety. I mean, people, come on. You
[1:50:08] know, Brother Brandham said he turned
[1:50:10] and he saw a smolder and ash. He never
[1:50:12] said that smoldering ash came from the
[1:50:13] bomb Russia sent. Never said it. It
[1:50:16] could actually come from the
[1:50:20] volcano. But nevertheless, Putin has
[1:50:23] already said they're the only nation
[1:50:25] that could bring us to a smaturing
[1:50:27] ash. Hello, somebody. Using the same
[1:50:30] terms brother Brandham used. Now my
[1:50:33] point is even that I mean look how our
[1:50:35] world is going. Our children are safe.
[1:50:37] We're being imposed upon. We're making
[1:50:40] our children go to making them our
[1:50:42] country is making them go to school with
[1:50:44] perverts and everything else. Come on.
[1:50:46] We cannot Amen. Uh uh we cannot govern
[1:50:50] them. You know, the best thing you can
[1:50:51] do is train them, teach them, give them
[1:50:54] the word, but most of all give them love
[1:50:55] so they'll know where to come when they
[1:50:57] need it. Y'all hear what I'm saying? My
[1:51:00] point is this. This world is falling
[1:51:02] apart. It's later than what you think it
[1:51:05] is. I'm telling you, the devil, Amen,
[1:51:07] will make you believe, Amen. You got a
[1:51:10] lot of time. Think about it. Those
[1:51:11] people in California, oh well, it's just
[1:51:13] another earthquake. They're
[1:51:17] blinded. And think about it. Now, I'm
[1:51:19] going to tell you something. How
[1:51:20] merciful God is. I want you to realize
[1:51:22] how merciful God is. God can't get the
[1:51:24] people to church. So, he produces a a
[1:51:26] film called Noah. He produces a film uh
[1:51:30] something about Jesus Christ. He goes
[1:51:32] out into Hollywood even though he know
[1:51:35] amen that a lot of the revelation ain't
[1:51:37] right. He he God knows how to take a
[1:51:39] little something something and catch
[1:51:42] that bride or catch that seed with it.
[1:51:44] So God goes all the way out of his is
[1:51:47] that right? That's the scripture. He
[1:51:49] said you wicked servant. Did you know I
[1:51:51] reap where I haven't
[1:51:54] planted? See, so God goes all out of his
[1:51:57] way with all of these. And they got
[1:51:59] another movie coming out like the Pompei
[1:52:01] or something. Pompei is real. It
[1:52:05] happened. It was like a
[1:52:08] Yellowstone. And the people saw and they
[1:52:10] knew things were happening. But oh, our
[1:52:12] beautiful lush, our beautiful country,
[1:52:14] our beautiful this, our beautiful that.
[1:52:16] Let me tell you something. Animals got
[1:52:18] more smart than most people.
[1:52:21] when I saw those buffaloos running out
[1:52:23] one way and cars driving the other.
[1:52:29] Oh, I could almost see them them
[1:52:31] buffaloos on their back laughing,
[1:52:32] kicking their legs up, say them stupid
[1:52:37] people. They so smart. They done they've
[1:52:40] done all this and they don't know that
[1:52:41] volcano volcano going to go
[1:52:43] off. People, it's just like the world. I
[1:52:47] mean, how worse can it
[1:52:50] get? I told y'all the other day, I was
[1:52:52] up in Barnes & Noble. Amen. I had to go
[1:52:55] get me a book on on it's a dietary book
[1:52:57] and and and and and right there in the
[1:52:59] place, and I won't go, but the the women
[1:53:01] had on just like Brother Brandham said,
[1:53:03] fig
[1:53:04] leaves, Sports Illustrated, and they
[1:53:07] were shaped like fig leaves. I didn't
[1:53:09] lust after it. You know what I'm saying?
[1:53:12] Because God has brought me beyond that.
[1:53:14] But my point is, Amen. It was right
[1:53:17] there in my face. And let me say it like
[1:53:21] this. It's later than what you think.
[1:53:25] Oh my God.
[1:53:27] Have mercy upon us. And with these blood
[1:53:30] moons, come on. We ain't seen it yet.
[1:53:32] It's already been declared. Something's
[1:53:35] coming, people. Something's coming. Was
[1:53:37] it last year when that uh meteor
[1:53:40] asteroid hit Russia? Don't you
[1:53:42] understand that wasn't nothing but God's
[1:53:43] stoning? The last stoning I know when
[1:53:46] brother Brandham threw up the stones and
[1:53:48] it and the blast come down and God's
[1:53:49] whirlwind come down and blast out those
[1:53:51] rocks but God sent the stone himself.
[1:53:54] Hallelujah. Bypass all those
[1:53:57] meteorologist or whatever they call you
[1:53:59] call them science people. Amen.
[1:54:01] Astronomers didn't even see it.
[1:54:05] Hallelujah. And I'm going to tell you
[1:54:06] something we better recognize because
[1:54:08] God said you'll see fearful signs in the
[1:54:11] sky. Amen. And they calling all of these
[1:54:13] uh UFOs. We know who they are.
[1:54:17] Yes, they are unidentified to the
[1:54:20] world. But did you know, brother
[1:54:22] Brandham said, "One of these days those
[1:54:24] lights will pick you up."
[1:54:28] Hallelujah. And we sold by the grace of
[1:54:30] God when that angel came down to brother
[1:54:32] Brandham. Brother Brandham said, "I saw
[1:54:34] a light. I thought it was a car light,
[1:54:35] but it and the car it did did it kept
[1:54:38] coming. All of a sudden, the angel
[1:54:39] stepped out of the light." Hallelujah.
[1:54:41] And let me say it like this. One of
[1:54:43] these old days, Amen. We'll have
[1:54:48] angels. Somebody's coming for us.
[1:54:51] Hallelujah. Amen. We're the aliens.
[1:54:54] Hallelujah. We're in a place we're not
[1:54:56] supposed to be. And one day, old mama
[1:54:58] going to come get us, and I'm looking
[1:55:00] forward to it. Hallelujah. You say, "Oh,
[1:55:03] Brother Brooks, you sound like a cult
[1:55:04] now. You done had all these strange
[1:55:06] things people be bringing." But I'm
[1:55:07] going to tell you something. Every cult
[1:55:09] is built around truth.
[1:55:14] Every cult is built around
[1:55:16] truth. And if you're going to call
[1:55:18] somebody a cult, Jesus had one, too. He
[1:55:20] had 12 men following him.
[1:55:24] Hallelujah. He had 12 of them following
[1:55:26] him. And listen, he was he had such a
[1:55:28] tight cult. He didn't have no place to
[1:55:30] put
[1:55:32] him. Amen. I'm telling you, if he was
[1:55:34] walking the earth and those 12 disciples
[1:55:36] was walking right now, you'd think they
[1:55:38] were bums.
[1:55:42] Why? Cuz God like to hide himself in the
[1:55:45] unusual.
[1:55:49] Lord, that's why you've been so strange
[1:55:51] all your life. You unusual.
[1:55:55] Amen. But God got you that way.
[1:55:59] Wouldn't have you no other way. But he's
[1:56:01] transforming us into the image and
[1:56:04] likeness of his dear son from glory to
[1:56:07] glory. Little by little. Don't you love
[1:56:09] it? Amen. Amen.
[1:56:12] Amen. Amen. Ain't God good to
[1:56:14] us? Oh, people, this is I I just got
[1:56:17] excited. This I tell you what, I love
[1:56:20] Easter. You know, I know it is that the
[1:56:22] word Easter is a pagan name, but every
[1:56:25] time I think about the
[1:56:27] celebration. Oh, I tell you what, I it
[1:56:29] would have been it would have been
[1:56:31] lovely to just be there when when them
[1:56:33] angels came down. Amen. And those
[1:56:36] soldiers
[1:56:39] went out of their minds.
[1:56:42] Oh, I would have loved to see. Yeah,
[1:56:43] y'all were tough. Amen. When he was up
[1:56:45] on the cross, but he ain't on the cross
[1:56:47] no more. Hallelujah. Let's see how good
[1:56:49] bad you are now. Huh? Come on. The angel
[1:56:52] come down. Amen. The light shine and
[1:56:53] they were
[1:56:55] running. But I thought you was
[1:56:57] dispatched there to keep him in the
[1:56:58] tomb. And that's what you must
[1:57:00] understand. As long as Satan can keep
[1:57:03] Jesus Christ in the tomb in your life,
[1:57:06] he's got the
[1:57:10] victory. As long as he can keep him in
[1:57:12] the tomb in your life, he's got the
[1:57:15] victory. He's no longer in the tomb, the
[1:57:18] stone must be rolled away. Hallelujah.
[1:57:21] And I'm going to say it like that.
[1:57:23] That's what denominations and
[1:57:24] organizations have all done. Kept him in
[1:57:26] the
[1:57:28] tomb. But there's a bride who says he's
[1:57:30] risen.
[1:57:33] There's a people of God that said he's
[1:57:34] risen. He's alive. He's well. And he's
[1:57:37] living in me to tell. Amen. I'm going to
[1:57:39] sing one song and I'm gonna let you go.
[1:57:41] Y'all going to help me sing it.
[1:57:44] I'm kind of
[1:57:49] home
[1:57:51] sick for a
[1:57:57] country to which I've
[1:58:04] never
[1:58:06] been
[1:58:10] before. No s
[1:58:16] Goodbye.
[1:58:18] There will be
[1:58:21] spoken.
[1:58:22] [Music]
[1:58:24] Hallelujah. For time won't
[1:58:31] matter
[1:58:34] anymore. I'm looking now. I'm
[1:58:39] looking now.
[1:58:41] [Music]
[1:58:44] across that old
[1:58:49] river. That's where my
[1:58:55] faith shall end inside.
[1:59:00] Hey Lord, there's just a
[1:59:06] few
[1:59:07] more days to
[1:59:11] labor. Oh,
[1:59:13] hallelujah. And soon we'll
[1:59:19] take that
[1:59:21] heavenly
[1:59:25] fly. Do the
[1:59:28] land.
[1:59:31] Hallelujah. I'm longing
[1:59:34] for you, oh my. And
[1:59:43] someday on thee I'll
[1:59:46] [Applause]
[1:59:49] stay there. My
[1:59:54] home shall be
[1:59:58] eternal.
[2:00:00] No
[2:00:04] build ever
[2:00:06] [Music]
[2:00:08] sweet
[2:00:10] land. Sing that chorus again.
[2:00:14] [Music]
[2:00:17] Bu I'm longing for you. Oh my. And
[2:00:25] [Music]
[2:00:28] someday on thee I'll
[2:00:34] stay there my
[2:00:39] home shall be
[2:00:45] eternal. Build the land.
[2:00:50] Oh, sweet
[2:00:54] Bland. Ber land.
[2:00:58] Build
[2:01:01] land,
[2:01:04] sweet land.
