changes we'll keep changing until we get into perfection limit you love the Lord we want to welcome everybody tonight we appreciate your coming don't mind you know the the many seats they're occupied even Bobby says the Angels our Lord in camp about us we have a host of angels they look into our services they don't understand salvation so they look and see the response of Christ and him crucified and we realize by God's grace there's only one way to be saved and that is in the name of Jesus Christ we have our brother Isaac he's a young brother he'll be ministering tonight this is his third time ministry I believe in gifts I believe in opening the door for those who say they're called by God the Bible said make your calling and election sure that's the only way that you can know you got to try it and see so I told my brother Isaac I said I told him a lot of things but I'd go back and say you know what get out there and enjoy yourself if you enjoy it you're on the right track sometimes I feel so good I just feel like preaching to myself God is good y'all have joy amen I have a great joy that God has given and I'm not gonna prolong the time because I know they're still in the middle of the week and some of us are tired and some of us may not be tired but those of us who still got to go to work now if God take us all the way through the night you won't be tired tomorrow because it's all God you love the Lord I believe the old-fashioned way folks I can remember the time we used to have church there was no time on it then after you got out of church you talked about the word all day all night and then you foul on yourself and you know we go out to the restaurants at night and then end up three o'clock four o'clock in the morning yeah at Denny's you love the Lord we're gonna ask our brother Isaac to come forth put on the word it's a difficult thing to be a preacher a lot of times people think that you just get up here and just start talking but it means nothing went until God comes on the scene so we asked our brother to come and like I said enjoy yourself let God go and let God have his way let him be the spokesman and we'll be okay god bless you good to be in the house of the Lord one more time you may and we sent God for this opportunity and we thank brother Brooks for this opportunity so we believe that God will be here in God will answer our prayers and God will meet our needs and reign would you please stand and open the Bible in the book of Genesis chapter 6 let's pray first your Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your grace we thank you for the word this opportunity of the word so we ask you a cheese's cause to speak O Lord Lord bless Lord they hear the years old God bless me Lord Jesus club put me Lord out of the way and you speak although Jesus Lord you know the needs of your people Lord meet their need or father we thank you Jesus cross in Jesus Christ's name Amen so we open our Bible in the book of Genesis chapter 6 verse 11 to verse 14 the Bible says the earth also was corrupt before God and the earth was filled with violence and God looked up on the earth and behold it was Cara and behold he was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth and God said unto Noah the end of all flesh has come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold I will destroy them with the with the earth make the an ark of gopher wood rooms shalt thou make in the Ark and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch Amen let's go again and Luke chapter 16 verse 16 Luke 16:16 the Bible says the law and the prophets were until John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses into it amen you may be sitting so in this verse right here the word that I wanna underline is the word crisis and my subject tonight is run into the ark because I believe that we are at the end time and it's time that we need to run into the ark as our safety it's not time to walk it's a time to run because we don't have time so and tonight we'll use the York as the York tonight we usually will represent the Holy Ghost and we need to run so we need to press to receive the Holy Ghost cause the time is at hand and it is so important and for us to be saved and for us to be raptured and for us to meet God we need to have the Holy Ghost and if you and if you notice that in the Bible when God talks about our destruction with no one he first sent the sign you first gave no other sign you know you first gave the people the sign you know we don't know what you know go tell the people go preach the word that I would destroy that the word we thought and now the way the people took the the way the people are took what Noah was saying so that was imparting their salvation because when the word is preached or God is telling your message the way that you are the way that you take the Word of God the way you respond to it that impacts your salvation that impacts your future because you'll notice that when Noah was preaching the word people at the first time I believe that the first time when you preach the word many people believed it but as long as you know no I was with the day was passing years was passing and people now got used to the word and mainly of them know now started to quit no I first when he started to preach he had a big church and make a church because everybody was afraid of the judgement everybody was afraid of the flood but after it no people now thought that God was slack and God promises judgment so he will not fulfill it so now they began not to quit they say well maybe tomorrow we all have a time tomorrow so let's just forget about it tonight so we have to go do our own business we have to go drink we have to go party we have to go do this and that you know we'll have another chance tomorrow but I forget that one day the Noah's sermon was the last sermon for them so in 2 so they had to go into the ark for them to be saved and you all know the story that they didn't go there and God wanted to save people what God wanted to save the entire you mind you mind it so for that you just stood you just don't know I said you know just bring the animals instead of man because men I gave them the warning but any God did they didn't get the warning so if we open our Bible in Hebrews chapter 11 verse 7 Hebrews 11 verse 7 the Bible said by faith by faith Noah being warned of God being warned of God of things that seen I'm sorry by faith being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house but by by the which he commanded the world and became her of the rod it became him and became heir of the righteousness with which is by faith so here you'll understand you see that God when Noah was warned by God he took God warning with fear if we consider God warning and he didn't neglect God's Word because he know that as the Bible says if you open your Bible the second Peter 2nd Peter chapter I think chapter 3 verse 9 you will see the Bible say that God is not slack according to everything he says God is not said to cause many people now nowadays you know they think that when God says something and if the they does think many people think that when God says something nothing has to happen right there at the same time yet sometimes he has to do but sometimes God is taking you slowly but slowly you know it's now trying to see if you really hold the faith you know trying to see if you really believe the word because you're afraid of the destruction or if you really believe what God said so that's why when people first heard the voice the person first heard the sermon of Noah they was afraid and that's what you know many people believed it but after they saw that you know this message you know Noah was maybe just drank too much and he dreamed about bethought about something that would never happen and then they still not quitting because I when I was when we were coming I'm driving down here and I thought that maybe in that days when Noah was preaching the sky was clear then he never was before you know that for those men who thought maybe the cloud the clouds will be dark and we'll see some signs of the day of the rain and that will help them believe I said maybe the clear that the sky was clear and people couldn't even not have an idea that a flood would come or he will grant and people also was weren't warned by the first coming of Jesus because the Bible says in Isaiah when you read Isaiah he says that Jesus will come and he said about John the Baptist's how you know the highway will be made in the desert and all those stuff and when you read somewhere in the New Testament you will see that people I think the Pharisees came to Jesus they say they asked Jesus to show them the sign not because that here is the fact because people went we are warned because tonight I just want to speak about warning to warn the people because we are really at the end time and people when they were warned and notice something that they were China they have their own conception of the destruction and their own conception of the of the sons that goddess to God has to bring I give an example those people the Pharisees they thought that you know we will have the mountain you know the mountain will be will be cut off we have a highway in the desert and they I don't know what what else they were thinking about but they'll yes the Bible said it but the way God was saying it was another thing that what they were believing so the fact is that you know we we just have to be ready you know when God said we just have to be ready I'm sorry in the Ezekiel when you open it when we open it up when you've Ezekiel we see that music you talked about the the the the judgment also and people with did God told them that when you will seek out to the disciple when you will see these things coming to happen you know leave Jerusalem leave the room and then we noticed that that the people who escaped was there those people who had the Holy Spirit who received God and who received the warning of God and they took it into consideration and we did we know through the history we learned that 1.1 million people was dead why because they didn't take what God is what God promised or they didn't take what God warned them you know in in in practice and today we have so many small scriptures and we have so many things that telling us that we are at the end time that with this time for us to get the whole to receive the Holy Spirit it's time for us you know to put our lives in order it is time for us you know to to forsake every bad thing that we were doing it is time for us to cry unto God you know if you say that you don't have the whole spirit or if you see that your soul is empty it is time for us to come because the Bible said that that promise the Holy Spirit and this the one who's going to give you and the only thing that he has to do that you without you and I have to do is just to go to him and run to him and ask for him because the holy the Holy Spirit is the only thing that will rupture and then that's the only thing that we need to run Tammy that's the only thing that we take us into it and I was reading the people today need to need to see God's judgment as the people of Israel saw it the first time when God talked about when God told Moses that you know this night applied the black because I will pass over and I was the reading and I was doing a Bible study on there and I understand that that time the first time that the death there the Death Angel passed over was d4 then the other time because that was real they knew that if they didn't apply the blood there was going to be dead there was going to be killed that the differential will kill the firstborn and they had to make sure that the blood was applied and listen the bag was applied the blood was applied in three place from the top and then the tube the two lentils and I was just trying and I said you know this time they're holy spirits who needs to be able fly in our lives in three places in our body soul and spirit you know in order for us to escape this death danger because God promised we are and in the third Exodus we did those things has to happen again and he said that you know they did the most important thing that he was saying he said that you know during these days keep the living out of the door of the house and when you read the Bible you will under you will understand that the delivered is sin his sin essence here is something that is not sincere and that's why when Jesus Christ was talking and did there the word if you read Jesus Christ they're the only times he used the word living in the in the speech was when he was talking to the Pharisees it's all the people don't be like them why because they thought that you know going to church it's fine going to church you know we're going to church or knowing the Bible knowing all the scriptures is fine but their lives inside of him was not reflecting what what they were reading their life inside was not reflecting the Bible and all the knowledge the head and Jesus told them to be aware of that living because it's not what you know that will make you rupture it's not watching it's not where you go to church that will make it right but it's the life of Christ inside of you it's the Holy Spirit and I believe that the Holy Spirit if somebody has the Holy Spirit you know he has to prove the life of Jesus he has to be like Jesus he has to do everything like Jesus he has to walk like Jesus has to talk like Jesus he has to pray like Jesus yes to read like Jesus and his life has really have to reflect the life of Jesus Christ and that's the time we're living in and today and if we see that we see that many things happen last month I think we heard about the earthquake and all the stuff and I was thinking I said you know the Bible talks about the earthquake at the end time that the earthquake will come and then after that will come death and the judgment the final thing and I said well people decides then every people say that you know this one was different than the other one so why people are still sleeping when they were when they are hearing and seeing all those kind of stuff so it is time for us to get out of sleep you know - it is time for us to run into God - run into the Ark and notice something in the Bible where we read Genesis chapter 6 Genesis chapter 16 verse 14 the Bible says make thee an ark of gopher wood rooms shalt thou make the the making the Ark and shalt pitch it within and without with with pitch and notice if you see the the gaffer world the gaffer world if you see the knot the nature of it it's a wood that is pliable it's a wood that you can easily maneuver it's a wood that you can easily you know shape and do things and it is also a wood that has many holes inside and then jesus said and then god don't know and they say pitch it within and without with the pitch and the pitch if you see the pitch represent the Holy Spirit and you know every Christian you for you to have the Holy Spirit you have to be pliable to God you have to be shaped by God you have to be shape when the Bible tells you you know you have to do this and the Holy Spirit tells you you know someone who has the Holy Spirit has to be like this and like this you know you have to be you know is like a lamp like a lamp you know obedia to the Holy Spirit we have to be obedient to the Holy Spirit and that that was that the gaffer would they did I was think they did nature of the gaff wood and that was the only thing that was required to be saved at that time and because I believe that the time of Noah was also a scientific age and people also maybe thought about bidding being big art but mere bigger than what Noah was building with with steel and all those kind of things but that wasn't the thing that was going to save them from the fly God told them to get on Noah the only thing for you to be safe nor the only thing that will save you is to have this gopher wood to use it and to pitch it within and without and this timely that at the end time the only thing that will save you is to have the holy spirit within and without but when the Holy Spirit is within you and without any the outside will reflect everything that is within you because remember Jesus Christ said in the Bible that you know it's when the heart is full then the mouths because you know it's not what what it's not what you eat there they they were not defile you but it's what is inside of you and I believe that someone who has the Holy Spirit inside of him you know outside his life will show that he has the Holy Spirit people will have no doubt that this one ISM is God sent by a person who is God filled he is God filled shock and that's that's what the Holy Spirit does you know with that in the side of you and if you did you see or Stephen Stephen when he was there when was in front of those chief priests and he told them that you are uncircumcised were uncircumcised what because when you see circumcision takes away the the the extra part the surplus it takes away the everything and the Holy Spirit also takes away everything that is outside of the Word of God the holy spirit takes away everything your bad nature everything that you do that is wrong the Holy Spirit would take nothing away and and that's why I told them and I believe that today people needs to be circumcised with the Holy Spirit people needs to be circumcised in their hearts with the Holy Spirit of God and that's why you see that many people are doing things wrong thinking that they're worshipping God by doing those kind of thing I was listening I was reading the news and I found out that last year people went and their worship beyond see I don't know if you guys know them she is she's a singer and they made a church they went to church to worship Him I just want to read whether what I found on internet he said it's become that the title is people are going to church to worship Beyonce in Sainsbury San Francisco you say it's become a well-established fact that beyonce is a higher being worthy of our worship especially after her groundbreaking performance at Coachella earlier in April now San Francisco's Grace Cathedral is using the inspiration that is that is Queen Bee to take the masses to church Devine a contemporary worship service that combines progressive theology and pop music has announced that it will be holding a special much devoted to Beyonce's music and accomplishment on Wednesday April 25th 2018 worshippers will be able to sing along with Beyonce's heat and explore her or her inspirational history particularly how she opens a window into the lives of the marginal marginalized and forgotten a particularly black females as the church describes on its website the mass also includes reading from Scripture by a woman of color and sermon by Reverend Yolanda Norton who also teaches a course called a course called Beyonce and the Hebrew Bible as San Francisco TR Theological Seminary in this year where there's been so much conversation about the role of women of women and communities of color we felt a need to lift up the voices that the church has traditionally suppressed Reverend Jude Harmon founding pastor of divine divine is that the name of the church and director of an innovative ministry for Grace Cathedral talk the 3rd SFGate Herman addressed critics of of the mass adding that Jesus used very provocative images in the stories he would tell to incite people to us hard questions about their own religion or religious assumption those were all those open at 6:00 p.m. and the event begins at 6:30 p.m. Devine encourages all attendant to use the hashtag Beyonce mass on social media more information about the Beyonce mass can be found in the vines Facebook event so we see all those things shows that we are at the end time that we don't have time to run or we don't have time to play to play Church no more it is the things that shows that you know we our God is coming soon so it is soon that's why I pray you that you may take this mission my message though broken Eddie as it is but you may take it into consideration as if God will come tonight because we don't know maybe God is coming tonight and if you're not ready brother I'm sorry to tell you that you will not go and this is thing and the thing is that when you see this I look some videos about this message and I saw that people went to church to that tree to worship Beyonce early and many people went there many people when they and I find and I said well now people are getting so called to God and then they are turning their hearts to things that is not real as the same thing as the Bible said that at the end time people will be pleased to listen to things that would satisfy their ears you know instead of going to where God is instead of going to where the Bible is preached instead of going to where the truth is preached and those things shows that we are at the endtime those things shows that it is time for us to run into the ark to ask God because God needs somebody who really need something it's like he's like someone is asking for something and if for example someone is asking for water and if the person is not thirst to drink the water you may give him water will not drink it would drink just a couple a couple couples a couple of times and then lift the water so God now needs someone who's thirsty you really you are really thirsty of the Holy Spirit really hungry of the Holy Spirit and God really sees their hunger inside of you and then it will give you the true food it will give you the Holy Spirit because that's the promise and we are at the end time and as I said that God told Moses he taught it on if you know apply the blood into the day apply the blood because when deandre when the death angel will come he will not see nothing else but the blood and he told him to apply the blood and he told him also you know when you apply the blood just don't stop by applying the blood but you have to be inside of the house you have to be in there don't go out cause the blood will only save people who will be inside and then when you are inside take the lamp eat the lamb and eat the lamb kill the lamb it and and then do everything that the Bible says in Exodus chapter 12 and the Bible and God and when you have the Holy Spirit you have to stay inside of God's kingdom don't go out cause because the blade defends you and I believe that a deferential way is also passing and this time and now this time not only killing the firstborn by this killing everybody would don't have the blood in their own knife the time now the time the you got the Death Angel is passing you know to kill everybody and the differential in this last time he's also seeing the blood of Jesus Christ because Jesus God shed his blood and when he went ape the blood of God was shed you know the blood of God that is the the Holy Spirit for us and the blood of and Jesus square represent the Lamb that that if the chin of Israel was hidden and the Jesus Christ is the Lamb he died it was the lamb and then he we went as the Bible said that the land could not have anything in it that if things in his body and Jesus God would check and he didn't have nothing and also but one thing that I love is that when they when Jesus was crucified normally in the Romans culture what they have if somebody's dead that you crucifying that they take the done the hammer they tried to break the bones and the when they broke the bonds of the two other our prisoner all the two hundred teeth arriving at Jesus Christ instead of breaking his born you know they noticed that this man was already he's already that and then what they did that you they tried their arm what the world yeah their peers him and when they pierced him water and blood came out of him you know one thing is that Jesus Christ bones could not be broken why because the Bible said that the lamb could not have any broken bones and and when they pierced him blood and water came out of him why to make you clean and to save you you know to clean your to clean you from unbelief to clean you from all dirty things that you have to clean you for everything and then to save you and then to feel you're with the Holy Spirit and then Jesus Christ and then Jesus caught when you went out you went to preach he went to preach if you want to preach there the soul that was in prison and when he came out with them he went he was with the disciple and he taught he spent fifth he spent forty sample and then it's all there and he told them to go wait in the upper room and there then then the tenth day the test day that was the day of Pentecost that is 1550 uni there will be filled with the Holy Spirit he told them to wait until they are filled with the Holy Spirit and then leave the room for going to - - to pray and photographer going to serve Him and do other stuff and then and then they were filled with the Holy Spirit and we see that when they were filled with the Holy Spirit they naturally have you know they were changed we see Peter who was who was afraid and who was scared of call preaching about Jesus who even denied Jesus called three times but we see Peter after being filled with the Holy Spirit came out in front of many people and preached they pray the Word of God and if you see acts 2 you see that when he opened he first opened that he first used the key that got Gavin he said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit and people repented and they were baptized in the name of Jesus squad and 3,000 people were saved at the same moment and this is the same key that people if they need to receive the Holy Spirit and in their words meet their needs to repent and be baptized and then they will receive the Holy Spirit and here is the thing that God says jesus said there's three steps to receive the Holy Spirit this first justification sanctification and the baptism on the wood and then you'll be fitted with with the Holy Spirit and justification what it does is just when someone hear the word of God and you feel that you know I have to make my life I have to may be empty to fix my life with God and you goes to God a review he repents and when you repent God takes away or God erases all his scene that it did before his passing and now the balance now is at zero that don't mean that the thing that made him cause the scene or them down it up if the thing the order life dime kodada made him sin is dead is still there it's like you have let me give an example it's like I have two pens I have two up this is a pen and this is a pencil it's two different things let's say that this one is a sinner and this one is someone when he when he has the Holy Spirit how it will be so this person if you write the day written with the things will be will come will be another color will be blue and then this one will be black and the blue let's say you represent sin because when you write it sin because when someone is not saved the exaction is nature is sin everyday thing that he do is see so for him if this guy chooses to go before God and repent from his sin that will not take they will not take the nature the inside nature of him out already would not take will not kill this name he will just erase God just will just erase everything that was written in the paper on the paper and then if then after if it passes the first step of justification he now arrives a sanctification now God is now killing the nature that will make this pen right blue and then after killing it after killing the predator this person now it will be empty and then after being empty God now we'll put the up the coast I can take it out I'm sorry God now I will take this one and it will put it inside so that you may write blood things and the blood thing represents me let's say you represent the Holy Spirit and that's the same thing with man if you have for example let's say someone he has a spirit of lust and molest and angry and all the stuff and all those kind of scene of drinking and partying and all those things so if it goes before God and you pray God Lord I need you to forgive me Lord I need your grace Lord and I really I really want to change and I need your grace the first step of justification God would take everything that it did before because when we're better it's for the remission of sin for your past sin now we take everything that it did before it will forget it so it will clean it and then the balance is zero that don't mean that then the same nature that made you say damaged you or drink or damaged you smoked or damaged you the other thing is that it's not that just the thing that you did before is now at zero pair the balance now it's easier and then you go to God and you you still pray God now will start out to change your nature but clearly the serpent that is inside of you and then after that after you clean because one thing is that God can never feel a dirty person or a dirty or a dirty vessel so he has first to clean you to make you empty you have first to be empty for God to fill you and then and then after going to God and then you will realize that the nature that you were you you know some you were your past life was that if you smell like a do like a beer or if you smell like a a smoke you know you will have that nature to go drink you will have that nature to go to go smoke but now you will notice that something has changed inside of you that even though you smell that you smell it but you don't have the nature of going again of smoking of of drinking and then after that God is now killing that nature inside of you and then after you are empty God is not will feel you're not with the holy spirit and it fills you with the holy spirit now you become a new person a born again person and that they they dester the three steps that that's the three steps that brings to them that that brings to the holy spirit and notice that Peter say that repent and be baptized and Bill you will be filled with the Holy Spirit that's the key you need the Holy Spirit repent be baptized there be repent be baptized and God will fill you and when we repent he has to be with sincerity you have to be sincere inside of you that God you know I you know I rather if you don't feel me with the Holy Spirit today or tonight you know I rather died I filled me with the Holy Spirit and don't leave the poopit or don't leave the church or don't leave the place that where you will ask until you will be filled with the Holy Spirit needs to see if you really need it or if you really you know you're really thirsty or you really hungry of it because notice that in the time of Noah as I said that many people believe that the first time by God knew God - it took a hundred and twenty and twenty years for the flood to come off or the rent where - to rent God was saying if those person who believed at the same time if they believed because they really wanted to be saved or they believed because they were just scared of and that's what God is looking for God needs you you see the inside of you it really needs you to see that you know here you know if I'm not saved I would they God kill me or save me it's just two things and that's the kind of heart that God is needed not the kind of heart that God is looking for because the Holy Spirit's I said the Holy Spirit it is really important as we say that jesus promised that the Jesus told you know the end time will come and he talked about is it Ezekiel say that you know the death angel will pass and it will kill everybody every person who will always not see and he passed and he cured it and we say that 1.1 million people came and if we open the Bible in Revelation chapter 7 Revelation chapter 7 verse 1 into verse 3 and after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners the corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree and I saw another angel ascending from from the east having the seal of the Living God and you cried with the loud voice the four and to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our God in their forehead amen this scripture right here talks about when you see that you read you see that the the wind and there are four angels was on the on the four four corners of the earth and the wind represents wars so wars and then hear that they were decided you know the decision was made that they weren't going to kill every person who was not who didn't have the seal of God but listen another angel told them to stop not to kill but to wait until I had to wait until there are some other people who would need to be sealed who needs to have the seal of God who needs to be sealed in their forehead who needs to be sealed in their foreheads you know for you two to start again or to kill everybody cuz the time was not that it wasn't the time for them to kill and when we see through the history we see that the First World War World War one day the World War one that the end of the World War one till now nobody knows how it stuff it was miraculous and I believe that this the other thing that that this scripture should normally happen in the First World War one because nobody knew how to how how how we stopped it was God God hands who stopped it God so that is so that I have my children who are not sealed yet who don't have the Holy Spirit yet so I need first to fill them with the Holy Spirit you know in order for their in order for the word to be I mean for so that the word be destroyed because God cared about you God cared about God cared about you wanted to see you with him you wanted to help you you know to sup with you he wanted to you didn't want to lose you so that's why he had to stop everything yeah that's why he had to stop the world that's why he has to stop you know the destruction so that you may be saved so that you may be filled and then God gave you now God now he's giving you the opportunity to be fit to be feel please don't reject this opportunity please don't take God as if he's like no God is not like everything that God said no matter how long that thing took that thing came to happen came to pass God is not stuck to his judgment God is not like you say that you know ask for the Holy Spirit and I would give you it you know people ask for the Holy Spirit and they gave the guy gave them the horsemen I ask for the Holy Spirit and God gave me the Holy Spirit many people in this church ask for the Holy Spirit and God gave them the Holy Spirit that means that this promise didn't lie because I experienced their promise and that promise word didn't lie to me was real and then this promise is the same thing if you tonight make a decision now I want to serve I want to serve God Lord Jesus I heard you up I heard I heard your voice and I heard the warning that the earth is now it way that the earth will be now destroyed and the only person who needs who will be saved is the only is the one who will have the Holy Spirit and I found out that myself I don't have the words because now it's the time to be sincere whether you're happy or you don't have it don't assume that you have the thing while you don't have the thing the time is there the door is still open God can see I can see you tonight assuming that you have the thing and then be surprised at the end time when God will call up those who have it now the time is open if you don't have the Holy Spirit if you hear the word of God God is present right now and God can fill you with the Holy Spirit you say that he's going to feel he's going to fill those who will ask for it he said knock and it shall be opened to you us and it shall be given to you seek and you will find and seeking knocking and asking that it doesn't mean that you knock one time and then you go no keep knocking keep seeking if God didn't feel you tonight keep asking keep seeking that's what God needs God needs you the God needs you to keep you know keep thirsting of God every day every day though you have the Holy Spirit keep asking God to refill you with the Holy Spirit to refill you because I want to be more God as long as you know the time is going and you know the end is coming I want to be more God I want to be just like God I want my life to express or to reflect God I want everything that I do to be christ-like that's the other thing I want you know everything school work everywhere I go that when you're here they ask you about Isaac who is Isaac Oh guys like this person who is like Jesus that's the kind of testimony I want to be that's the kind of thing I want you know to be my life to be like Christ to love like Russ you know to walk like Russ to be to speak like Russ and to pray like Ross everything like run God is now present tonight if somebody needs the Holy Spirit or if somebody needs whatever it whatever need you need God is real and God needs to save you your ever sickness you have something you seek or you have any problem God is real God needs to with you God can answer to any need just come believing have faith on him every don't think that you know this small guy or I Isaac you know baby is not if it doesn't have any experience in preaching and all the stuff know it's about God this God don't have faith on me but have faith in God it's God who will fill you it's God who will save you is God who will hear amen Lester [Applause] [Applause] we appreciate the Lord Jesus I'm a witness well I'm one of those people that I'll never step foot in Beyonce's Church absurd but when we think about all that he said tonight well God said through him it is time to run I believe it's Zachariah says when you see and the vision has been made plain let him that read it let him run it it's time to run earthquakes in divers places Wars rumors of wars everybody knows something's happening even if they're not even you know in church and they know people are going insane totally insane calling right wrong and wrong right I could remember the time when I used to work at a club and I was alcoholic and God delivered me but I had to cry out okay you know III couldn't just say Jesus I cried out like a madman but there I was in that room and that wind came and when it passed through me I didn't go through no DTS or anything like that it was gone every time I cried out for something God always gave would give it to me he talked about the scripture there in Genesis y'all know this is a woman's world I have nothing against women I really don't but the serpent told Eve your eyes will be open and he promised her that she one day would become as God now we understand that the world is worshipping women that's a prophecy everywhere you go there's the boss not no harm no how feeling sisters I'm just letting you know that that is that inspiration he talks about the third Exodus there is an exodus Hollywood no the world has spin the fall they all kinds of earthquake movies if it ain't no earthquake it's an asteroid something striking the earth and destroying us and bringing us to it distinction when all you got to do is read the black book he said what are you saying brothers I'm trying to tell you no I want to scream sometime because I realized Amen that people are just not getting it my mother was a Christian now used to just feel so sorry for because I didn't understand how could she live how you lived this way I thought it was human effort I thought it was something I had to do it was like our brother Isaac said when you get the Holy Ghost it changes you it take away the darkness and brings you into light wonderful message brother I was blessed today because you know a lot of times you think am I the only one really seeing it the way I'm seeing it look at our United States it's falling apart not just our country all the countries nation against nation go read Matthew 24 it's right in the book sincerity about I love this and I'm not gonna prolong the time but one thing I will say I really enjoyed the message brother and it's people like you and myself people who maybe not be so polished I don't think John the Baptist was polish was it was he one of those intellectuals that had the collar and everything else everything in place my fact John was like a wild man hallelujah amen eating locusts like peanuts and popcorn right while here smelly but those are the kinds of people that God uses he purposely uses people like that because of our mind I was thinking Jesus was purposely born in a manger over a manure pile y'all hear what I'm saying God always takes the scum of the earth the little people and he hides himself in it he took a murder by the name of Moses y'all know what I'm saying all I'm saying is I know I heard from God through a little brother by the name of Isaac because it is time to run I come to this church almost every day praying and crying out not just for this this church but for the Christians everywhere that God will take the veil off of their eyes because many will be left behind because they don't see the time we're living in the warning has been given like our brother saved and at what point in time will this thing come I got me a message one day that's what that's all yeah one day it's going to happen one day you love the Lord thank you brother appreciate it anybody these our prayer I have a prayer request for my brother my oldest brother they found out he has cancer and my the only sister that I have left she has cancer as well I've got three siblings left and two of them have cancer and neither them know Jesus so I told the Lord I says God I'm gonna do my best to get to them I'm not gonna let Satan just take their souls and drag it into hell so I need your prayers that God would open those doors for me that I might be able to witness to my brother and my mother has been an atheist for years but he's met the message he's met me I put it this way and in California he's the only want only preacher he had going here when I come to church even his son say how on earth did you get him to do that go to church that's how I don't know I don't but he sees something because he told me one time he said there's God he admitted there's got to be a higher order higher God somebody's looking out for you only because I was being led by God several times when he was in need I was in prayer in God's they sent him there sent him there and he said to me how did you know my brother is 72 73 years old you're never too old for God to touch your heart I love him and I love my sister so pray that God will give me that opportunity I have witness to them before but I still desire to have that one more chance if God would permit you love the Lord yes ma'am okay okay that's pray for brother Keith can we bow here it's just now father God we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace and your mercy we pray father God that you would remember Keith and his travels God keep him safe and sound let no hurt harm or danger come upon him Lord I pray right now that you would bless bless sister Katherine and my brother Tommy I pray that you would touch their hearts Lord open their door their hearts door that they may receive Christ Lord we realize Lord Jesus it's not the beginning that counts but the ending and father God we have all comes all of sinned and come short of the glory of God we pray father God tonight that you would bless each and every one of us have requests there are unspoken requests those that you know Lord God we pray father that you were touched just now made this word echo in every heart here tonight that when we leave this place when we go home we'll remember the things that we've been told Lord that you're in the business of warning but father you always warn the people before you judge them granted father grant us grace in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen yes yes but okay I have attached a short testimony so um this summer I had some financial struggle and I did I never finished to pay my tuition at school and he always bothered me because I got his new job that I had and it wasn't meeting meeting the expectation the financial expectation of the job and so it was just a hard summer for me and just for all of us in the house just praying praying and we knew the consequences that if we don't finish the tuition on time then that means you'll add one more one more semester or one more year old school school year me and John and um it was very difficult because I transferred from a university in North Dakota to to Kirkwood in Iowa and being that at the community college you go to Community College for only two years but we'll be ending we would have been there for four years which was not according to our plans so I was just praying praying and one day oh I had a dream that I had this dream that God showed me the first of all even about this dream I have a lot of dreams but the only concern is that my dreams never come to pass so I had that really bothered me though because I know I heard brother branham said that if you have a dream any gift that you have give it to God yo usee and so one day I just went to prayer and that's all God that I dream alive but why do none of my dreams never come to pass I'll believe rather Brennan said that if you have a dream if you dream a lot before you sleep make sure you you read the word you think about Christ and then you'll use that gift and I'm like God I'm giving you this gift that you putting me use it and the very next day as I slept and I night I had this dream that I saw somebody that came and gave me $2,000 for my tuition and but I was afraid to talk to tell people because my dreams never come to pass and but I kept it in my heart and in the morning I just see our mom she's like the there is a person that's gonna give me $2,000 for the tuition I'm like well I had this dream and I saw this person coming to give you $2,000 and so that's when I taught her this testimony and I was able to finish my tuition and John was able to finish this trician now we had this one more latitude to climb over it was registering for classes it was very late just like a few days before classes start and we knew the consequences so brother Jesse Smith came and after the service the service in Des Moines outside of I told him about it I'm like let me just break and he prayed for me I told him that according to our plans we want to graduate in May but we know that if we don't like there is a probably 90% that the classes are already full because we checked in the classes were full and but we still pray we trusted God and the next day I told him that I'm going to go to school on Monday which was then the following day so I went to school that day I met with my advisor and still he seemed like he even seemed like the prayer wasn't even answer because the classes were still full there was one class that only had one person left to be in the class but not to brag up on that but I gave that class to my brother John so that I can I could have missed that class but I gave it to him and now I was missing two classes but he was only missing one class but um I was like we prayed about this so I kept on sure I think even the adviser said that at this point you know it'll be up to the professor so just admit you into the class but one class was most likely now going to admit us because I was behind in the weight these three people before me and I'm like hi in the world are going to happen but still kept on trusting God the following day on Tuesday because she told me that the professor doesn't even see our emails she is only going to answer when school is back but the following day I was driving to work and I had something in my life that I need to make right with God and in the car I just felt that so hard in my life in my heart and I just stopped the car and I just asked God to forgive me and as soon as I just asked God to forgive me something kind of told me to check to check in the in the could you check my classes and I went through the website and I checked my classes I so we got the permission to register I'm like maybe just maybe they always say that so let me try to register if they'll let me in and I tried to register for all my two classes and I got in the world and I texted my brother I'm like John try to get into those classes maybe they'll let you in don't try [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] I love to sing it it sounds like the sweetest [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Seibert love me tells me Oh it tells me over saviours love who died you set me free Oh ain't God good to give us so many blessings on discerning that's what we are [Music] Oh [Music] that's what [Music] [Music] in the darkest night is like this oh it's good [Music] he put a song every in this heart of mine god is good [Music] [Music] that's what God bless you
