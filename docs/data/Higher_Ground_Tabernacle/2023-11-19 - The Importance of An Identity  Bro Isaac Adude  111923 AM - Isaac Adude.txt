will pass over amen man we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus we're so happy to be here God's presence amen we're happy to see you this morning amen Let's uh go straight to the word we'll open our Bibles in the Book of Genesis Man chapter 27 we'll read the verse 18 to verse 19 Genesis 27: 18 the Bible says and he came to his father and said my father and he said here I who are thou my son and Jacob said unto his father I am Esau the firstborn and I have done according as thou B me arise I pray thee sit and eat of my my ven that my uh that thy soul may bless amen let's turn again to Genesis CH 32 uh verse 27 amen it's still talking about Jacob amen the Bible says in verse 27 of and he said unto him what is that name and he said Jacob let's bow ahead father God thank you for your grace and mercy thank you for this opportunity that you have given us to share your word with your people Lord we just pray father God you take us out of the way speak to your people Lord pray father Lord you make us sensitive to the Holy [Music] Spirit Lord so that we can say what you want us to say Lord pray father Lord that you be with us oh God Lord that you continue to be with us Lord we pray that you bless every hearts that we hear this morning and give us Faith to believe we thank you for everything in Jesus Christ name we pray amen this morning we have a little subject that we wanted to share amen that we entitled the importance of an identity amen the importance of an identity in prayer don't amen we we we read uh Genesis 27 verse Verse 18 to verse 19 amen here's you see the a story of Jacob amen the bible say that and he came unto his father and said my father and the father said who are thou my son amen here's Jacob they ask him a question to introduce amen by in verse 19 instead of saying that I am Jacob it says that I am is th first amen because the identity amen I looked on Google what's the true meaning of an identity amen Google says that identity refers to our sense of who we are as as individual as members of a social of of of social groups it also refers to our sense of how Others May perceive or label [Music] us amen so our names are idty our names is a part of our identity amen the way we smell is a part of our identity am the way we talk is a part of our identity amen The Way We Walk is a part of our identity amen the way we behave ourselves is a part of our identity amen identity is who you are amen so it is very important for us to know who we are when we go to God Amen it is very important to us to know who we are when we asking God for something amen so here in Genesis chapter 27 amen Jacob amen Isaac promise is a blessing amen because it was a custom in the Old Testament the first born was supposed to receive a blessing from his father amen so in order in order for them to have that in order for is Isaac was blind Amen in order for the son son to receive a blessing amen that son had to identify himself Amen to help his father recognize who he is amen so blind people amen when they're blind God increas some some some some senses of their lives amen some will know when they touch God will increase their touch amen some God will increase their smell amen some some God will increase their sense of hearing amen because that will help them guide that will be their guide amen so here in the Bible amen we see that Isaac was trusting his hands and his nose amen and his ear to identify who was was in front of him amen so now here Jacob comes and Isaac ask him a question who are thou my son amen he said that I am Esau that first amen if we continue in verse 20 of the same chapter amen and the Bible says that and Isaac said unto his son how is it that thou has found it so quickly and he said because the Lord thy God brought brought it to me and Isaac said unto Jacob come near I pray thee that I may feel thee whether thou be very th thou be my very son Esau or not and Jacob went near unto Isaac and he felt him and he said the voice is Jacob but the hands are the hands of Amen Jacob tried to fool his [Music] father going to his father with the false identity amen his name was Jacob he talked like Jacob amen but he tried to fake his smell to fake his his smell amen and then the the how his body was feeling amen but he was Jacob my mom used to tell us stories when we were growing up amen cuz my grandfather was blind and the way he was recognizing his children it was by the smell and he had 10 kids and he knew every the smell of every one of them amen even if they're outside of the room amen he would know exactly who was coming amen sometimes you know one of them will come and they'll say you'll say that oh this uh uh you know so and so is coming man his kids will be like but Dad you you're blind how can you even tell a few seconds after they see him walking there's a story that one that's one story that intrigued me my mom said that uh their you know her oldest brother I believe went to Europe for a long time for years and he came to he came back to con and no nobody knew that he came he wasn't like surprised so when he was when he was down in the street coming my grandfather looked at his his wife was next next to next to her and he said the name of that son his name is poor he's coming said but Dad he's in France right now so but how is he going to call he said you guys just wait he's coming he's about walk why because because he knew how he was smell amen he had an identity amen so when we come to God we have to have an identity am we have to know who we are amen so you see now here after verse 27 amen Jacob came to God with the false identity amen Isaac bless you amen but that did not stop troubles from coming to even though Jacob was blessed by his father but Jacob did not feel as if he was changed or something happened in his life amen that blessing did not really help him amen he was blessed because technically he became the first son amen but that blessing did not change his life because he came with a false identity so now let's go to uh Genesis chapter 32 verse 24- 28 amen the Bible says here and Jacob was left alone and there wrestle a man with him until the breaking of the day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of of his Ty and the hollow of Jacob's Ty was out joined as he wrestled with him and he said let me and he said let me go for the for the day breaket and he said I will not let thee go except thou bless amen amen so now notice to verse 27 amen and he said unto him that angel said unto him what is thy name and he said Jacob and he said thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel for as a prince has D power with God and with man and has prevailed amen look at here you'll see that the same questions were asked to Jacob who are you but different answers had different effect amen the first time when Isaac asked him who are you he said my name is Esau amen he was blessed but that did not change his life that blessing did not bring a change in his life as a matter of fact that brought more trouble amen Esau his brother wanted to kill him amen everywhere he was going he had troubles and trou amen but now he came when he when he was wrestling with the angel amen the angel ask him again who who are you amen he gave him another Second Chance am to claim his identity he says that my name is Jacob and after that Jacob's life was changed amen he was he became Israel amen the identity amen it's who you are amen it shows that you being honest when you're talking to God amen amen it's like the the uh the th on the cross amen one knew who he was amen he showed his identity to Christ it says Christ I am worthy of this death amen but you're not amen I am a sinner amen I know what I have done amen I know that my way wasn't the right way amen I know that I did some some Very Bad Things amen I know that I am supposed to be crucified amen he recognized his identity amen he was sincere with God and after that a promise was given to that you will be with me amen because he knew who he was amen he knew the importance of his ID amen so when we come to God Amen we don't have to fake who we are amen if you are a sinner you tell him that I'm a sinner amen if you don't have faith you tell him God I don't have fa man if you're struggling with something you tell him that God I'm struggling with something because you're going to a God who knows who you are amen you knowing to you're going to someone who knows who knows who you are amen he knows who you are better than yourself amen he even knows what your your deepest desires are the Bible says that he knows what we before we ask something to God God has already heard it amen so what's the purpose of hiding who we are amen what's the purpose of of hiding our identities amen we have to know who we are amen and tell it as amen the prophet says in the message identification amen paragraph 58 it says that you cannot no way ever produce a character like that only accepting that character in you a church cannot do that a Creed cannot do that a denomination cannot do that an education cannot do that amen it must be a birth amen it's got to be a dying out and let God in by the grace of Christ mold this type of character in you amen that you become him in your life and and your life and he in the same and his is the same and your life and his life is the same then you are sons and daughters amen that character comes from a birth amen a dying out amen you have to die and let him in amen it's what Jacob said amen I am Jacob I am a liar amen I'm not an honest person amen he said who he was amen he died to himself amen so that he can birth into a new person amen so that he can become Israel amen so we have to die in ourselves and let God in die in yourself amen the prophet again say it says that now the only thing that we have to do is to have faith in what we are in what you are have faith in what the word says you are and Jesus had faith in the word of God that said what he was it is written of me did David say in the Psalms and the prophets and all of them that speak of him I am the bread of life that came from God out of out the amen I am that tree of life from the Garden of Eden I'm all these things I am that I am and he knew with that perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon him he said now in myself do nothing but it's my faith in God and God was in him the word was manifest was made manif and when the word of God comes in you it's made manifest for you are a Believer see an un believer is the Fai the faith of God that moves in you amen Jesus knew who walk amen I believe I preached on this earlier if not here amen who are you that was my child amen I this vers I read the scripture the prophet says that the thing that we have to do is to have faith in what you are amen have faith in what the word says have faith in what you are and have faith in what the word says you have to know what the word says you amen because sometimes you know the devil when things are not working right the devil will come to your mind and show you how a bad Christian you are the devil will come to your mind and show you how you did wrong amen he will tell you said that you should have waited on God but you did not wait amen he tell you that you should have done this and you didn't do it you should have respected the entire Ten Commandments but yesterday you li to your neighbor yesterday you were watching something that you not you went with the wrong crowd those are the tricks of the devil he will try to take take that confidence you have in try to take that faith that you have in but the prophet say that you have to know what the word says that's the way to to fight the devil it's not when he came to Jesus he came to Jesus with the word he came with him with a twisted word trying to showes Jus you know trying to said I will give you all those but remember Jesus did not just speak the word to speak any kind of word Jesus was speaking a word of what the Bible said he was amen he says that you will not tempt the Lord thy God Amen that was what the Bible said of him amen so that's why we need to have faith faith in what the Bible says amen we need to have faith in what the Bible says we are amen so now the question is what is the Bible say say about us amen what is the Bible saying about us let's turn in John 15 ver the Bible says that if you abide in me and my words you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you if you abide me and my word AB the prophet said in the message witness it say that if you know positionally who you was and what you are tonight who you was and what you are there wouldn't be a feble person in here in the next 5 minutes that's right the thing of it is you're looking off into a millennium for something to happen when it's already here now we are sons of God now we will be but we are right now the prophet when and he said this night amen so if I ask the question when this morning we are Sons and Daughters of it's not something we have to wait until it's not something that we have to wait until the service amen but right now we are Sons and Daughters of Amen right now this minute we're seated together in Heavenly am if you only recognize that and the supreme authority that Jesus Christ has amen anything you have desire of am anything that you need of only thing you have to do is ask and receive it whatsoever things you desire amen When you pray believe you receive it it'll be given unto you amen that's why the Bible says in Mark amen and that's true whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive it and you shall have it amen the prophet said that you are Sons and Daughters of God right now amen he's talking about the the present amen he's not talking about the past amen he's not talking about the future man he's not talking about what you did 10 years but he's talking about what you are right right now you are a son of God right now you are a daughter of God so if you are a daughter of God you have the supreme authority that because Jesus was the son of Goden and in him had the supreme authority that was had the supreme authority of God am so whatever he was saying God was saying to It Whatever the son was saying the father was looking said amen to it when he said Peace the father looked and he said amen to amen when he multipli the bread amen the father looked and he said amen to when he created money in the belly of amen the father looked and he said amen to amen why because he was the supreme authority because he was a Son of God because he was the son of God am because he was the word made he was the manifestation of the word so you are also the Manifest you are the word made Paul called you the living you a living because you are the word of God the manifestation of the word of God whatever you say the father will look and say amen amen whatever you say the father will look and say amen amen so in you amen you have the power to change your you have the power to change your situation you have the power to change your circumstance just speak the word just have faith in what you are just have faith in what the word says you are the word call you the Son of God God is calling you the son so act like the son of a prince in the Kingdom amen he knows who he is amen he knows that he's different from the his way of dressing the way he'll be talking he will be talking with full Authority it's like the story that the prophet told us about who was a prin back amen even though he wasn't in his country amen but he had a certain kind of identity amen he had a certain type of living he had a certain type of talking so when he was talking amen people were seeing the difference between him and other it's the same thing with us we're living in this world Amen this is not our world amen this is not our world this is not our home we're just this but this hasn't have to change the way we are it hasn't to change the way we talk this cannot influence who we are we are Sons and Daughters of Christ amen we are Prince of his kingdom even though we're living in this world behave like to beh like because that's amen that's who you are you are and Fa I like the the that one of the ministers the visiting ministers the power of transformation 57 the prophet says that's the way God did about the world Amen he worked he was in his mind and if you notice it come like by Evolution like it was learning more all the time making something greater and greater see he was above it all and just let it up to that you see everything he begin to bring upon the Earth from Buton and life and fish and so forth it come onto into he come into bird and the animals and then something in his own image amen amen and stop there because it was up to his [Music] Perfection of what he made God Prophet say that wasu man he first created The Birds created the animals he was a learning process he knew what he wanted he wanted to have a masterpiece it's like what the prophet talked about the Masterpiece amen he he had a masterp that he wanted amen he wanted something very special am he wanted something that was different [Music] Prophet said that he created Adam and then after that ad fall amen Adam decided to you know to follow to redeem his but God that did not God for looking for that Masterpiece after that he started to create the prophets where the prophets came up Abraham amen he was called a friend of God but still that wasn't exactly what God was amen then then amen then came Isaac and Jacob wasn't what God was looking then after that he came up Isaiah and all the David God even called him a man according to but still that wasn't what God was still looking for something was missing even though they were prophets even though they followed God in every all the words even though they gave God their hearts but still something will God wanted to create something in his own God wanted to create something to be the [Music] manifestation amen and then after that after all the prophets God created the master Jesus Christ amen he was God walking he looked like God he talked like God Amen he lived like God he was God the Bible says that amen the bible say that that word that was from the beginning amen that word that we heard we touched it with our own amen we saw it with our own it was that Masterpiece Jesus Christ amen then God looked at that Masterpiece he was so pleased with that still wasn't satisfi have only one he wanted to do amen he wanted to create many more out of that amen so he broke that Masterpiece he broke that Masterpiece so that he can take the life that was give it to every one of so that we can become God he took the life that was in him gave it to every one of us amen so now you have the life of God so now when God looks at you he said that this is what I wanted this is what I wanted this is exactly who I want call my son is my master this is what I wanted because in you dwells God himself he said that if he abide in me and my words what is the word of God it's God himself in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the word was manifest and dwelt Among Us that word was broken down into small pieces amen but that did not change the nature that was still the word in different quantities with the same quality am so that word now is living in then the verse continues and say then ask what you and it shall be done why because the word that Masterpiece that God want amen he created Adam Amen in his own image amen who named all the animals who shaped the Earth the mountain where they were supposed to be told the trees where they were supposed to but still God was not satis something was missing and that thing he found it in Christ it was God himself amen God looked at it he said I want more so the only way to have more is to break that Master in different pieces and give it give it to one and to everyone amen so that we can go to him amen identifying ourselves as God's children identifying ourselves as sons of and Daughters of God ask ever we want and it'll be given to us amen so if you have faith in what the word says you are amen the word is calling you the Perfection of this area Amen in you you have something that Abraham did not have amen you have something that David amen you have something that Daniel did God gave go God gave Daniel the opportunity to see our our time God gave Daniel to see the dispensation of the Gentiles but still Danel did not have what we have now amen amen they were they had faith in something that was supposed to come they they had faith of that land they were had faith of something that was supposed to they had faith of a Perfection that was amen but still they did not have it amen they did not have the Holy Spirit that's amen because back then God was with them am God was with them amen God was setting himself in in the ark amen God was sitting in the mountain God was sitting in the holies of holies where only one person was allowed all of them they knew they serve God still they did not have the Holy Spirit but God gave you that opportunity Amen to have him not only with you Amen to have him inside of that's what we call Grace amen it's not about what we did amen none of us can amen none of our faith can be compared to Abraham's Faith none of our troubles can be compared to none of our circumstances can be compared to what the prophet but still God gave us that Grace to dwell to him to have him dwelling inside because you are his friend amen because you are his friend in John 15 verse 14 and 16 say the Bible says you are my friends if you do what I command amen this is Jesus talking he said I no longer call you servant because the servant does not know his master but instead I called you friend for everything that I learned from my father I have made n you did not choose me but I chose you and I appointed you so that you may go and bear fruit fruit that will last amen and so that whatever you ask in my name the father will give you why why will the father give you because you are my friend amen because I'm calling you my friends amen so when I call you my friends amen you have the same opportunity amen you have the same clear level of clearance with [Music] God amen when you look at you know in a country amen the way the government works people have some certain level of clearance amen you and me will not know what what Deputy what a policemen will know man a policeman will not know what the mayor knows the mayor might not know what the Minister what the minister knows amen and then the minister might not the minister might not know what the president knows because there are certain level of clearance amen there are no other stuff you have to reach some certain leveled and the highest level amen is to be God's friend amen because when you are a friend of God Amen his word becomes the word is open look at Abraham God called him his friend when he was about to uh destroy Sodom God was on his way to go then he remembered he said that but this is my friend amen and I'm about to do something so I have to let him know he said Li hi to Abraham what I'm why because Abraham was God's friend so now he's calling us our his friends putting us in the same level as Christ amen being a friend go friend of God he said that I no longer call you a servant the servant does not know what his master instead I have called you friends for everything that I have learned from my father I have made known to amen I call you friend because to you now I'm an open book amen so what is a true friendship amen a true friendship is someone who you can trust a true friend is someone that you can trust a man who stays by your side during good times and bad times amen someone who is afraid who isn't afraid to tell you the truth and who you feel safe and comfortable around amen whether you sharing the the world's best love or an epic that person will always be with you that's a friend a person you can trust who stays by your side during good and bad amen and Jesus is Calling You his friend so meaning that Jesus can trust you amen Jesus can trust you amen Jesus can trust you that you will overcome all the trials amen Jesus is trusting you that you will have victory over amen Jesus is trusting you that even if amen all the ODS are against you you will still stand with the word Jesus is putting his trust in you who him who created everything amen him who created the world Amen he created the birds everything amen he's trusting you Amen to continue his work that he did not finish he's trusting you amen that's the biggest that's the greatest level of trust calling you his friend amen that he will be with you amen the prophet says theet men in the beginning when he was made says that a man is a god he's absolutely a God Amen for he was made in the image of God being a Son of God and then he is an hair of all that God is a man was given a Dominion I'm sorry A man was given a domain the domain was the earth you have power over the fishes over the fs of the air over everything he could just speak and everything obeyed him because he was a god with him himself not Universal God amen but I mean the god of heavens and the Earth but he was a ruler in his domain amen he was a king a king ruler that was man amen and even now in his Fallen State he still has the appearance amen you were be you were made the ruler a ruler a king of the do of your doain amen so when you are in your domain amen there is nothing that has high Authority amen the Earth is your domain so nothing has higher author amen he said that who shall lay anything to change uh who who shall lay anything to the charge of God God's [Music] El it is God that justifies who is who is he that condemn it is Christ that died yet rather that is reason again who is given at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us n in all these things we are more than conquerors through for I am persuaded that neither death nor life No Angels no principalities no powers nor things present nor things to come nor Heights nor dep nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus amen who shall lay anything any charge in God Amen no one because you've been justified by amen justification amen it's like it's putting everything back original amen justification amen means that somebody else paid the debt for you amen so you like a new person so who can lay any charge of God's elect it's God that justifies amen the Bible said that and he maketh intercession so in other words God Christ is our prayer Warrior is our prayer Warrior amen so he prays for us amen he intercedes amen there are some times amen you can't express watching sometimes in your life things happens that you don't know amen that you can't tell how and why things happen amen but know one thing you have a God who constantly prays for you amen constantly he interes for you amen he constantly prays for you so rest assured amen he knows what you're feeling amen he knows what you're going through amen he knows what your problem is he knows what your desire is amen because he knows your heart he knows your thoughts amen he knows everything amen and he intercedes for you he prays for you amen he prays every day for you amen the same way Jesus prayed for the disciples he said God Amen protect them amen protect them I know the world will be against amen but I pray that you keep them United amen then later on in that chapter I believe it's in John he said that I'm not only praying for them that are here amen but I'm praying for even for those who amen meaning that in that prayer of Jesus Amen you are included amen you are included amen he knew that times a rough time will come he knew that everything will not always be on your favor he knew that sometimes you will feel like you about to forsake he knew that sometimes in your life it'll feel like you at the End Amen everywhere you want to go there's a wall standing there every solution that you want to take there's something always not working he knew all and he prayed God to keep you so that you can have faith prayed God the father he said father I pray for those that you have given amen the same way you were in me I was one with you so I want to be one with them amen I want to dwell in them amen he prayed for you amen and he's keep on praying for amen Revelation chapter 1 verse 6en he says that and he has made us Kings and priest unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion amen he has made us Kings amen the highest those are the highest order in the kingdom and in a church amen a king has a supreme authority so above above a king there is no one else amen his word is like the Lord amen and a priest amen he's the one that goes amen with this with the prayers amen of the entire city of the entire the entire of the people of church he goes he goes with us prayer to amen and the bible say that he has made you Kings and Prien notice the Bible did not say that he will make amen but he said so right now amen you are King amen so right now you are priest amen he has made you Kings and PR of your domain amen so you have the authority Amen to cast The Devil out amen because it is your domain because it is your kingdom amen and the Devil he's supposed to obey you amen he's supposed to respect am because you are a king am when a king speaks amen that's it that's it that's amen and a kingdom am it's not a democracy amen there's dictatorship in the Kingdom the kingdom wants what he wants amen whatever the king wants amen that's what is going to have amen if you have a baby and the King said that this will be my child there is nothing that you will have to do you will have to obey because the king say and he called you a king so whatever you say has to happen amen so whatever you say amen God will back it up because you are a king amen what you want is what you will do that's why when he gave his promise he did not say ask whatever God said he did not say that ask whatever God want you to ask no but he said ask whatever you will ask whatever you want amen because you are a king amen and you and you are as you are a king your desire is to be granted to you ask whatever you want amen the Bible never gave us a list of things ask whatever you want and it shall be given to you amen going to the end the prophet says see people try to think well I'm a Christian I guess I have to be dugged around no you don't you are Christian that's you're Son of God our Father is King and our father being King and we are his sons we are prince and princess amen a king see the highest there is highest can be the very Spirit of our God is in us that's it amen he say that the highest there is the very spirit of God of our is in us if that same spirit that Quicken chist from the dead and that same Spirit dwells in you amen he will change your mortal body amen it will Quicken that mortal body amen he will give you the new life amen it will bring you back to life amen if that same spirit that same spirit that was Jesus amen that was Jesus that was with Jesus amen when Jesus died on the cross amen the Bible says that water and blood came out Amen to make to wash you and to make you clean amen then after that there was a division amen God divided Jesus in two amen he took the body and he gave his send the spirit on Earth amen amen because amen when the resurrection will happen amen it's the spirit that has to go into a body amen and the resurrection will happen in Christ amen it's the one who will be resurrected so that's the reason why you have the holy spirit amen because as the resurrection will be in Christ meaning that that spirit that is in you amen that's the thing that will bring you up go that body to give you that perfect body amen if that spirit that was in Christ that raised him up from the dead it's only God's spirit it's only Christ's spirit that is's able to raise you up from the dead amen if that Spirit dwells in you it will Quicken your morning it will bring a change am like Jacob amen he said to his father I'm es amen but when death was was coming amen his brother was coming to kill himen Jacob said himself this is not a time to be joking amen this is a time where I have to be honest with myself amen I told my father that I was es nothing worked amen nothing worked but now I have a second chance amen that same question is been asked so now I have to tell amen I have to tell him exactly amen I have to be honest amen because honesty is something that God Valu amen God values the sinc your heart amen that's why he told Brother Bren he said that if you are sincere amen nothing will stand against amen he told him that if you are sincere amen if you are honest amen nothing will stand against you amen when he told that line amen he tried to go pray for him for that King amen he knew that at that time he wasn't who he was supposed to amen so if you pray for that that kid would would die amen he had to go fix it first amen he had to go repent first amen being honest to go amen changing Mask doesn't change who you are amen changing mask amen doesn't change who you are God throughout the time amen he changed his mask amen from Jehovah amen to all the seven compound name of je amen but even though his name was being changed his nature never changed he was still the same God that's why the brother bam said that that a Jehovah from the Old Testament is a Jesus of the newest even though he was changing mask his name his nature still the same still the same so even though Jacob changed his name he changed his clothes his nature is still the same Amen in closing I just want to you show explain show up something please so this is exactly what Jacob did hopefully so he took the he took the clothes of his [Music] brother he came if people who know you know they care too much about the smell they care too much about the smell the people who care too much and they remember people smell amen they will know how is smells because I've been using that same col for years now so I have a certain type of smell so wearing my brother's suit even though I smell like him right now you're smelling good by the way even though I smell like him right now amen I have I wear the suit this amen it doesn't change who I am amen I am still Isaac amen I have a new clothes if you saw me coming chch amen I had a burgund suit amen but now I'm wearing a blue suit amen but still that doesn't change who I am inside amen I am still the same Isaac so if I go to God I'm not going to say that Lord I am John even if I'm wearing John's clothes I'm not going to say that Lord this is John because I smell like John because I'm wearing like amen I can't even try to speak English as the as he do that does that will not change me amen neither it will change him he's wearing my suit amen this is even though it's Isaac suit amen but inside of him is amen so when we come to God Amen we have to come to him amen knowing what we are inside don't let this body amen dictate who you are amen you have to come to God Amen knowing what is inside of you amen knowing that you are a son of God even though you make mistakes am even though you make mes that will never take you out of the picture even though you lied yesterday that will never take you out of the be you are still the Son of God because there is his seed inside of Amen you all still the daughter of God because of what is inside of you God looks at what is inside this cover amen this will never dictate our Liv we make mistakes we fall every day amen we tell lies every day but still within us we have that that desire am of becoming true God of becoming sons of God Amen we have that desire amen of serving God Amen we have desire of becoming perfect and that's what God looks at that's what God looks at because there is a quote that the prophet he said that the mistake that the The Devil Makes is to let you come into this room to let you come into this church because he knows exactly what you did before he knows exactly what the kind of sins that you have made amen but God looks beyond amen he looks beond the ve he looks what's inside of this is my son amen he has in him the desire of serving still is not strong enough so I'm going to give him a word I will strengthen him I'm going to give him something that will help him out it's like Peter when said when he said bid me to B me come Peter started walking on the water amen God knew the desire of Peter God knew what Peter wanted but even if Peter started to sink that did not change what God was seeing when amen God just to reach out and pulled him out even if you were a sinner you've done some bad stuff amen that people cannot even cannot even imagine amen that does not change who you are Amen in God you are his son before the foundation you are his son so you that will not change that will not change the thought Just Keep On Believing if it's not today Just Keep On Believing amen if it doesn't come today just keep on believ because you are his son amen you are his daughter he called you his son he called you his friend he's the one who called you you did not called yourself God's friend he's the one who chose you he you did not choose him chose you he chose to love you he knew exactly who you were before amen so that will not change amen Just Keep On Believing keep on beli Amen that suit that you wearing amen doesn't change who you are amen God is looking inside of Jacob tried to change his clothes amen Jacob tried to change his smell amen Jacob tried to change the way he was talking amen but still that that did not change who he was amen he was still Jacob and God knew him of who he was amen so that's the reason why God sent that angel Amen to give him that opportunity again recognize who he was amen so you are sons of God you are a daughter of God Amen that's who you are amen that's what God is seeing when he he's seeing your soul he's seeing his seed inside have faith in what you are amen have faith in what you are amen that's that's you know that's something very important that's the importance of an identity When you pray you have to have faith in what you want amen so you ask God accordingly amen you ask God according to what you are amen you are his friend you go to him you say God I am your friend and you say because I am your friend I can go and ask whatever I want so God I am coming as your amen you are his son or his daughter Lord I am coming as your son as so I'm asking you as my father amen he may not give it to you now amen but that doesn't mean that he declined you amen he may not give it to you now doesn't mean that your request has been declared so Just Keep On Believing amen have faith in what you are amen and you will see everything coming to amen God bless you have Fai in what you amen and whatever you ask God God will give it to you give us a song right so we have our sister here she's having pains Mir with her ears so we just say that we go to godall knowing what we are so we are Sons and Daughters of Christ
