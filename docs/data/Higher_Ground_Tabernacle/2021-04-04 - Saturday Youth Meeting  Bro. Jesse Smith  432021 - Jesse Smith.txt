leave that up to brother jesse and for those of us who can fellowship and meet with him that would be really nice um also brother there's a brother tony that will be calling you he's one of the brothers that i know from lime ohio he he's the one that gave me the bold system and all of that so he's going to come up in may this april may yeah and help us out as much as possible he doesn't know what kind of system we have so he's going to be calling me to find out how old it is or how young it is because i have no idea but um i i think if we could get him to come up he's the one that basically helped set up lima's uh sound system you know so he knows what he's doing so we appreciate that and we appreciate him coming in and so god has been good to us amen i appreciate every one of us of you who like i said have come out to worship with the lord and worship with us my wife is running late it just seemed like the enemy's been really trying to make everybody a little late or whatever but nevertheless when she gets here she'll be here so we thank god for that in jesus name and also um uh let's just remember tomorrow uh hopefully everybody come we're gonna also do a uh love offering as well um by god's grace and so if you give him a dollar that's how much you love him let's hope he love him more than a dollar i'm not at that you know i'm not big and i'm just kind of kidding around but i trusted my brother jesse's about ready to come he [Music] you know i hate being stuck in chicago so he had to pray when he got here because i can understand what he had to go

to be in house of lord let's go right to the word of god i'm going to try to watch my strength and zeal because i got to preach two more times i preached last night at our church had a really wonderful service just thankful for a good friday you know brother branham said it settled everything you know he said he said both he said good friday was the greatest day and then he said easter was the greatest day so i just say it's the greatest weekend praise god and uh all i know is that jesus christ is real uh he has changed my life supernaturally and i'm so glad he's alive brother braham said the greatest message you can share with somebody today is that jesus christ is alive are you glad he's alive today let's give lord roman clause amen thank you lord [Applause] hallelujah let's have a word of prayer here before we get into the word of god and of course we have our bibles in our hands but let's have a word of prayer heavenly father lord we just humble ourselves and lord we just come reverently before you thank you for the worship lord how i enjoyed that lord god and i just pray you'll bless these musicians lord god is as they went before the ark lord god in the days of joshua and lord the word and the music has gone forth now lord god the word in a music form and father our hearts are happy lord god we're glad we're joyful we're thankful for all that you've done lord god because only you can do it lord god only you can do these things in our lives oh you're the only living god i remember the song brother brooks saying that you're the only living god and we're assured of that today we realize that and we're grateful lord that if you're for us who can be against us lord so thank you lord for saving us and being for us and guiding us i pray you speak to your people tonight help me to get out of your way bless the hearers lord god and bless each and every one of these young people and adults that press their way out to the house of god it's a holy sacred weekend lord god it's the greatest weekend of the year lord and we're just uh we're just privileged people to be in your house tonight lord god so just let the holy ghost lord anoint each and every person give them their portion whether it's salvation justification sanctification portion or the baptism of the holy ghost lord god or a fresh refilling of the huma the human spirit to transform their minds to do the perfect will of god so whatever the portion is we know it's from you and lord you are our portion so we thank you for that dear god thank you lord that you're our portion you're our great rich reward lord god that's all we want lord god one day is to see your face and we'll keep pressing on enduring the battles and overcoming lord until that day we see your face lord god so we thank you for your mercy bless this reading of thy word and bless your people in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen i'd like to read a couple portions of scripture go to deuteronomy 28 let's start there deuteronomy 28 verse 1. if i had a little title tonight i'd just like to preach on all spiritual blessings are by revelation and obedience i just like to speak on that i was just you know praying meditating and uh asking the lord over the last few weeks you know what would the lord have me to minister so i hope this will be a blessing to you and i trust the holy spirit will speak to you hallelujah deuteronomy 28 verses 1 and 2. you know at home i always like to hear the people read it i like to hear their voices too i don't want to be the only one talking during the sermon i like to hear the people's voices i tell you it helps you too to confess god's word praise god so let's read verses one and two together ready one two three and it shall come to pass if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe and to do all his commandments which i command thee this day that the lord thy god will set thee on high above all nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god many people fail to remember that this actually applies to us today because if you go to the scripture we'll read one more portion of scripture we might as well just do ephesians 1 3 we might as well read that ephesians one three brother brooks had even mentioned in the car he didn't even know he was kind of preaching my sermon in the car on the way over he said we're just like israel and we are praise god we are because we're a chosen people except we're a spiritual priesthood but all these blessing saints apply to us as well in the natural right god will bless us in our land and our our our jobs right our families if we keep the same commands that god gave israel if we keep the same ones god will bless us the same way i see a lot of young men in here tonight i like that there's olivia god bless you lydia how you doing sister praise god amen well my lydia is 16. so she's used to me calling out her name so god bless you that's our connection we both have a lydia brother joe and i by god's grace so ephesians 1 3. a lot of young men in here and you are the leaders of your future homes praise god your wife your children they're going to look to you for leadership right thank god you got a spiritual leader too brother folks that's what when i came in i looked at him for leadership and he gave it by god's grace very thankful for that and so we got a lot of young men here and if the lord tarries you're responsible for the blessing or cursing upon your life you can't force anybody to be saved i wish we could don't you i wish we could force not forget about i wish we could see more people filled with the holy ghost but you can't it's whosoever will let him come and drink of the waters of life freely but what we can do is we can create an atmosphere and we can control who's ruling in our life right and as husbands and and fathers we can control our atmosphere praise god and so that's what our desire is to do ephesians 1 verse 3 let's read that together too i got that good scripture in the back praise god let's read that one two three blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ may god has blessings to read his word you may be seated praise god i trust everybody's feeling good by god's grace good to see the bell brothers god bless you brothers hallelujah boy they grow fast brother brooks my goodness good to see all the brothers i wish i could know all your names and know all where you came from a little bit on my background uh i was raised in a pentecostal church i didn't know about the message until i turned uh 21 and i met that wonderful brother in the back brother brooks back there and uh he became my pastor he baptized me in water he married me to my wife right he dedicated my first child i got filled by the holy ghost by his ministry praise god sitting under his ministry he ordained me to be a preacher praise god and i can i can attribute a lot of the a lot of the blessings in my life through god placing me under brother brooks's ministry i tell people that all the time all the time there was numerous churches in that area but god directed us to brother brooks's church and time has proven because he had the real baptism of the holy ghost glory because some of those preachers have fallen away they prove they don't have the holy ghost you can't have the holy ghost and do some of those things they do and so i've always counted it a privilege that the lord chose brother brooks to send me there as a little lamb he sent me there to the shepherd brother brooks and so now by god's grace i learn i try to do many things like him by the grace of the lord because i see it scriptural and so uh we're very grateful for all that god has done and i trust that the lord will speak to you today how many blessings in their lives you know church uh many times we just fail to forget that there are such a thing as permanent curses like cain had like the serpent had but there's also temporary curses that can come upon believers you cannot curse what god has blessed that's a true statement and that's an overall that's an overall promise in other words you can't permanently curse a real child of god but as you see in the scripture god's children can make faults and sins and come under temporary curses amen praise god now we call it oh i was feeding the black dog too much we don't come to church and say brother brooks i'm cursed today we say brother brooks uh i haven't been creating the atmosphere at my house or i've kind of i'm backslid a little bit right you know you you get the code words but really in the bible there's only one or the other you're either walking the blessing of god or the curse the chastisement of god amen and scripture makes it plain church that we're either going to see one or the other overtake our lives hallelujah we're in deuteronomy 28 let's go back there let me just prove it to you verse 2 and all these blessings shall come on thee and over take thee that means god's goodness is going to be running after me there's a little song they got like that it's called the goodness of god i like that little they put a little i don't like the church that came out of but they really got inspired to write a song and if you don't have inspira if you shouldn't complain if you're not writing songs but if you got if you got the gift to write songs you better be writing songs if not you're burying that talent and shame on you you're under the curse temporary temporary curse if you got the gift you better invest i think that's what i preached on last time the diligence if you are not diligently investing you're going to find yourself that the chastisement the spankings of god are coming after you amen instead of coming to church and wow i'm blessed all the time you're saying wow i'm spanked all the time that's your fault because god said either one or the other is going to overtake your life and i'm so glad jesus christ is overtaking my life with his blessings not because of me so much but because of his mercy praise god we have a part in it right we have a part in it but the bible says the goodness of god leads us to repentance amen and the bible says those that love or i'm sorry those that are forgiven much loveth much so we must always remember how good god has been to us and how much he's forgiven us of and if we serve god with that kind of love the blessings of god will chase us down we won't want to run after sin or temptation or immorality because we know what it leads to it leads to death and destruction and curse but when we constantly remember god's blessing and his mercy that he could save a wretch like me we can join paul in saying i'm the chief of sinners but he's called me by his grace amen and then he said i labored more than peter than james john thomas i labored more than them he said yet not i but the grace of god that was with me so he constantly depended on god's grace i used to arrest christians and he always had that memory i used to do evil i used to do evil but i'm not going to forget that i've got to lean on god's grace i'm not going to remember that past life as far as be a slave to it i'm going to use that as motivation to never to never disobey the word of god to never do despite the spirit of grace but instead to obey the spirit of grace we need some men in here that are going to serve god in the spirit of grace hallelujah our brother's going to have to remember that god has been good to you hallelujah he's been very good to you and he's forgiven you of very much so you ought to love him with all your heart for that is the greatest command of god to love the lord your god with all your heart soul mind and strength that means all your effort how many athletes we got in here any athletes football basketball i was a college athlete i played against ben rossberger michael vick i played against those guys in college i never made the pros because i got hurt i don't thought i would have made it anyway but the point was i had to give all my diligence if i wanted big muscles if i wanted to run the 40 and 4-3 like i did i had to be diligent and work really hard and the jesus says you must give all your might and strength to him as well in other words you've got to bring your body under subjection and you've got to treat it like you're a spiritual athlete praise god you're running a more important race than the 100 meter dash or maybe we got some distance runners in here the 3200 god bless your hearts brother brooks he's a distance runner best is hard but you got to remember it's more important to uh to to train your body to serve jesus christ i exercise too we both exercise we got to keep our bodies under under control if you don't you let the house of god become a pest house it already is in one sense but we got to keep it under subjection we got to keep it healthy we got to keep the spirits out keep the demons out did you know brother ram said diabetes was a chemical reaction it wasn't a demon it's a chemical in other words people do it to themselves because they want their eat they're not they're not diligent enough that uh they eat too much sugar they don't take care of their bodies but man said that's a chemical reaction and they're like cast the devil off me why don't you cast the devil of lust off you stop eating all that trash but then i can't cast it off unless you you confess it and then you're really sincere about it it's not just words flowing out it's not vain words but it's a real repentance like i'm done with it like i'm done with cigarettes i'm done with alcohol i'm done with this i'm done with that a real sincerity the bible said you've got to come to the place of repentance repentance is a place you've got to come to amen it's a state you've got to come to praise god where it's a it's a dividing line i'm crossing over and i'm not going back anymore praise god i've crossed over praise god i am in re i've come to repentance i'm quoting peter where peter said uh god would not that any man perish but that they come to repentance it's so hard to get a young man to repent in these days it's so hard to get an old lady to repent right it's so hard to get a young person to repent these days because the spirit of this age is rebellion it is the spirit of witchcraft you look up witchcraft there young men if you look you look up witchcraft in the greek it means drug use look at all these people on drugs they're getting into demon demonic powers they take the high there and they see things they are totally demon possessed don't you ever take those drugs you take jesus amen there's one time the word addiction is used in the bible it's at the end of i believe romans or corinthians paul said be like the house of stephanus because they've addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints amen we need some brothers in here that are addicted to serving the house of god amen addicted to serving your pastor and the saints here and helping people out that's the kind of addictions we need amongst you brothers praise god hallelujah that's what we need to be taught in this day don't we uh become addicted to service because the greatest among you are not the preachers necessarily they could be we know the the greatest ones will be preachers because jesus had a throne right and all there was 24 elders all males right twelve old twelve new we know we know the greatest servants will be brothers but brother baby said in choosing abroad he said many of you sisters will get a greater reward than some of these men because they bore the reproach of the gospel choosing of a bride you can look it up look up greater reward because the greatest among you is the servant of all amen like i hear brother brooks he's on the phone with that one that one that one he's serving all of them right really probably get lots of phone calls a lot of texts and all of you can be that way in a way not to take the pastor's role but you can listen and say oh i overheard this brother struggling i can help him out with some money there oh i heard they need a sunday school teacher i could teach it praise god hallelujah i hear uh uh you know they need a song leader or they need a musician or they need something like that some some man ought to stand up and do something about it a real man will stand up and do something about it when i went to brother brooks church i got the holy ghost the first thing he said he said can you be a deacon i said absolutely i knew i knew about this much about being a deacon but i just learned from those deacons and i just whatever he asked me to do i'll do it we drove three hours one way for a year and a half because i love that man right there and i love the saints there too but i trusted his leadership i knew he was born again praise god i knew the holy ghost spoke through him one time my daughter acacia she had what do they call it when they just can't stop crying crook yes something like that she couldn't stop crying i was talking to brother brooks on the phone i said brother brooks can you pray for her he prayed and condemned that spirit and within a matter of minutes my baby that would always cry all night stop crying amen praise god i like that god answers prayers three hours away praise god he didn't have to lay hands on it he just had to speak the word only like that's roman center and said just speak the word only and we'll have our healing praise god amen hallelujah thank god i'm probably preaching too loud for my voice but here i'll try to be careful that's what we need today we need some saints who are under the blessing of the holy ghost it's all about that now go to uh verses go to verse 15. in deuteronomy 28 15. it shall come to pass if thou will not hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe to do all his commands some people stumble at that they say oh that's old testament legalism that's not jesus christ before he left his apostles after the resurrection he said teach them to observe all that i commanded and lo i am with you always even to 2021 hallelujah i'm glad he's here today amen we got the greatest news there ever was jesus christ is alive amen he's alive saints praise god they think that's legalism that's not legalism legalism is adding to the word lecheviousness is taken away from the word you've got two l's there right one's legalist and one's laschiviousness legalism is adding to the word well if your sleeves aren't this this long you're going to hell that's legalism right but lasciviousness is the you have a license for immorality the bible says they turn the grace of god into lasciviousness you got one or the other or you got right down the middle you got love amen just just struck me praise god the three elves praise god you either serving god by love legalism or lasciviousness we're the children of god we love god i don't serve god because i'm scared to go into hell i serve god because i love him amen and i know i'm going to heaven hallelujah that's why i serve and praise god thank you jesus but the bible said every blessing now i didn't finish i didn't even finish the scripture let's finish 15 to observe to do all his commandments and the statutes which i command you this day that all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee so either the blessings are going to be chasing you down all your life or the curses will be chasing you down take your choice brothers right take your choice sisters right if you will diligently hearken unto the voice of god obey him keep his commands the blessings you won't even be able to uh uh contain them i got eight children how many who's got more than me brother brooks yeah you had a 10 buddy nine eight you got eight i thought you had nine i thought you had nine i got eight children i'm a school teacher teachers don't make a lot of money but i have seen jesus christ fulfill this scripture every year every time i get another baby i get more and more blessings and this year was the greatest of all of them 2020 was the greatest year of blessings for the books i've ever seen everybody's in fear fear fear i'm like in faith hallelujah thank you jesus not because of me but because god's word it'll overtake you it'll be chasing you down brothers amen if you can love god and serve god with all of your heart you'll see the blessings of god they won't come all at once joshua didn't take it all at once but he took one at a time amen he took one at a time and that's all you got to do is just take one at a time hallelujah and the blessings of god will come and chase you down i hallelujah that with all my heart my dad left me when i was in seventh grade he left my parents had six my parents had six kids my dad left six kids when i was in seventh grade so i grew up i've grown up and i still battle this day i always like i always want to know am i doing okay like i always want to ask older men my dad wasn't there like when i became a man and i'm always like nervous like am i doing okay and i finally got these last few years i finally got like god is my father now i do like to hear you know good things from other brooks but the books am i doing okay i would like to hear that i like that but i've learned that jesus christ is my father and even though my dad left and all six children were left there all six of us are married and no divorces because the blessing hallelujah you cannot stop the blessing if you diligently hearken in the voice of god the blessing of god it rests upon you my mom lit sometimes physically dragged us all six to church all by herself all those years sometimes you have to squirt me with vinegar she had vinegar in a bottle she'd lift up the blanket mom come on i didn't want to go to church i was the last one there i sat with my head down all the time all the way up until i was 19 when i was 19 i got convicted by the holy spirit my mom dropped me off at college and said see you i was all alone but i wasn't all alone god was with me i started realizing i need a savior i sat in church but i was a dead church member and i gave my heart to the lord and i've been on fire ever since praise god i didn't get the holy ghost until this man preached it and prayed for me praise god but i experienced the blessings of god since then what i'm saying is that the blessings will overtake and reverse the curses that's what i'm saying to all you young men here the if you obey diligently the voice of god the blessings will reverse the effects of the curse and you won't even and god can take some of those things away you'll never even think about them again and you'll be walking in the blessing the anointing of god will be resting on you amen like when i walked into my first interview for to be a teacher i had a suit and tie on you know i sat down and they started asking me questions and i just felt the holy spirit give me all the answers like they said what if a child says do you believe in santa claus the holy spirit gave me wisdom said i'd say ask your parents right because i can't i can't change their beliefs i got to respect the parents i wasn't even ready for that when the holy spirit just gave me the answer i got to that interview and then people there were you know denominational believers in there and they said when you walked in it's like a light walked in with you and afterwards just a short 10-minute 15-minute interview the principal comes out and says we've been looking for people like you and what can we do you know i had two offers what can we do i said well i really like this offer it's closer to home i think i'll take it people begging me to take the job and there was over 800 applicants and there's two positions and i got one of them i had no experience i wasn't anything i'm still nothing but it's god's blessing amen because he promised amen if you diligently hearken to the voice of god and love god he'll bless your life now that's not why we do it you know necessarily we just don't serve god for blessings but we want we want to to express the nature of god we want to be a city on a hill that cannot be hidden we want to shine with his light because we have no light amen i'm looking at the lord terrorists i'm looking at future husbands here and fathers your children one day are going to come up and say daddy can you pray for me to get the holy ghost like my daughter did last night oh hallelujah that's the greatest privilege the greatest honor we could have is that we'd be so salty praise god that our children will get thirsty amen we have to live in such a way that the people will get thirsty saying i want to be like that i want the i want an anointing like that so the holy spirit can flow through my life like that listen this is a battle you're going to serve one or two masters praise god jesus said you can't serve both so you better decide tonight if you haven't decided praise god either serve god or ma'am and riches you're going to serve one or the other i just made up in my mind at the beginning i ain't going to be rich i'm i was dead poor you know we we got food stamps growing up we had to get government cheese and government milk and all that i was living off the government i thank god for food stamps praise god i thank god i was fed because of that hallelujah i just made up i'm just not even interested in money and so i can just that's not even there i want to serve jesus i want to do what he wants me to do because i know he'll bless me amen that's right hallelujah i stand here as a 40 year old man can you believe that brother brooks i stand here as a 40 year old man with eight children i've been married coming up on 18 years or 19 yeah i get myself in trouble i think it's 18 years aaron don't text my wife about that i'm coming up here on this anniversary here and 15 years as a pastor as brother brooks has ordained me to be a pastor and church i'm looking back and i can see blessings multiply year after year after year they are just chasing me down i struggle though don't get wrong i struggle i fall short of god's glory but the overall picture he gives here is if you love him and serve him he blesses your life now let me read this real quick here uh i kind of want to say this here uh brother branham says first corinthians 11 uh verse 30 for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep brother graham says now watch what it is what the curse of it is the curse of communion we don't say like like you know we're nice we don't say it like that like you're gonna be cursed if you don't come to communion but that's what brother branham said and that was december 12 1965 communion the curse the curse of it so many people were dying in that can i say like this book of acts church see i've been encouraged by the troll over the years i know where the book of acts church i might not see the dead rays all the time naturally but i see that this dead man was raised to life as well praise god spiritually amen we've had great testimonies you know little testimonies over the years but when i looked at these book of acts churches they had some real problems they had a man sleeping with his stepmom they had many people dying because they didn't take communion the right way in a book of acts church i told the church i said we're small at home i tell you we're blessed we're doing pretty good by god's grace amen nobody's sleeping around nobody's dying right hallelujah god's providing for our children children our children are coming up for the holy ghost by i mean what better blessings could i ask for that they want jesus christ to be living in their souls what greater blessing could i ask for give me five million dollars or give me my children coming up for the holy ghost i'll take this i won't even bat an eye brother i won't even bat an eye i'd rather have that in fact one time we had two families you know our family another family my brother was very influential in our church and i started seeing him he first he started uh he stopped studying the scripture and he started studying business and then he stopped coming to sunday night services and as soon as i saw that i said that's not right the children are going to be out from the word of god pretty soon they're wearing high heels shorter skirts next thing i know they're watching the super bowl now since they've left our church but when i saw that brother troy i got on my face brother brooks and i said jesus christ dear god please let my children be filled with the holy ghost first as a vindication that i'm leading my family the right way and when brother brooks came to preach last june praise god two of my girls came up brother brooks and they got the holy ghost when you and brother cam prayed for them hallelujah that's eternal praise god i'm not talking about natural blessings now i'm talking about eternal praise god and that can never be taken away from them hallelujah because there's a little secret in the church age book i think it was the thyroid or church age jesus said the last works were greater than the first and brother said that's the secret to christianity when the devil wants to try to get you to slow down and stop doing your service he said you increase more and more hallelujah he says shut her down shut her down now we all have to retire right i mean eventually we're going to either lose our minds right at some point we got to lay our bibles down right us preachers i got a lot we got a lot of years left i know you do buddy you're so healthy man brother trey troy you look good too buddy if the lord carries we got a lot of years left but the point i'm making is that we've got to just dedicate ourselves to that and give more of ourselves to the things of god fulfilling that loving god with all your heart and then loving your neighbor as yourself you know the more your church grows as i've seen it grow i came back i came here when you guys first started in 2009 i think it was or ted you're really small and now you're growing but all that means is you have more chances to serve one another amen and then the blessing of god will be running after you all the days of your life i love this because jesus christ keeps his word it's not my reputation on the line tonight it's not brother brooks and brother troy's reputation on the line it's jesus's reputation let me encourage you young brothers take him at his word take him at his word i'm not even close to where i thought i'd be going but god knows every place joshua would place his foot it was given to him but it was all by conditions brother brahm said the nation of israel taking the promised land is a type of the holy ghost he said you can see right now very few will ever believe all the way to receiving the spirit of god very few people are going to cross over he calls it the fullness of the blessings oh my he said very few people and then he says it again he said it'll be the grace of god that shadow brought in our hearts by the baptism of the holy ghost that'll take us to the promised land into the fullness of god's blessings so you and i as men men young men and young ladies we come out of egypt through the baptismal waters but most of them most of israel and most of us among the message die in the wilderness haven't we seen it brother and they and they just go around the same doctrine right two souls over and over again right perusia oh and they die they die oh every word brother brahm says thus saith the lord every word that's a lie and they just go around and around and around and they never get into really the promises of god where they're fully dedicated fully immersed in the blessings of god and they see the gifts in their life multiply and they actually know what gifts they have praise god that'd be a great thing for the message churches what gifts do you have everybody knows when god's voice says stop having children but they don't have they can't even hear the voice of god to say what gifts do i have something's wrong there brother brooks they can hear the natural but they can't hear the spiritual shame on that that's a lying spirit that's right amen and they don't even know why on earth am i here to come pack a pew we've had people come to our church that have been the message brother brooks 40 years and have left the message brother troy some of them never even came up for prayer one time some of them never even said amen went to a very famous church in phoenix people that knew brother branham but never they saw a man fall off the balcony died they prayed raised him up they didn't do it but they saw it they saw life come out of death they saw the dead raised they carried some of them saw their teenage friends carried out after long services speaking in tongues their parents had to carry the teenagers out and now here in 2020 and 2021 they can turn away from the word of god and say i just can't live it anymore that's because you never did live it because once his life gets in you if the same spirit that was in him it'll quicken your mortal body as well amen hallelujah you can and they've seen way greater miracles maybe than me but jesus told it plain it's not how many miracles you can keep he told that story of abraham lazarus and the rich man and the rich man said send lazarus so they'll know the resurrection power and jesus said if they or abraham said if they don't believe moses the law and the prophets they won't believe a miracle amen he was saying we've got to just have a love for the word of god and then if you've got a love for the word of god these signs will overtake you these signs will follow them that believe amen is that right i don't care where people come from i don't care who where they the question is do they know christ that's the question and if you love christ he said if you love me keep my commands and that's exactly what the promises of god say in deuteronomy 28. let's go over real quick how long have i been okay i've been 30 minutes good wow that's going fast deuteronomy 28 i'm just going to just let's actually go to 27. deuteronomy 27 verse 15. and verse 15 he starts laying out curses first is idolatry and notice can you uh let's read verse 15. cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molt image an abomination unto lord the work of the hands of the craftsman and putteth it in a secret place and all the people shall answer and say amen the very first curse he lays out is secret sins oh my goodness secret idols where in your house keeping things hidden we had numerous people and this is for the young people we had numerous young people at our church they would cry at the altar they'd scream they'd praise god i loved them i tried to be a pastor them they ended up leaving the message wearing pants and they said i i some of the girls said we never got rid of our pants they just kept them in their closet there church don't we know that when elisha followed elijah all the way he had to kill the bullocks he had he had to cut every bridge right he had to totally cut himself all off praise god he had to say there's no way i'm going back i have nothing to go back to praise god i wonder what secret things we got sometimes hiding on in the back parts of our phone or our closets you better get it cleaned out because it will catch up with you it will catch up with you the first curse comes upon us or comes upon people because they have secret idols that they really they really worship that more than they do the word for most people it's a it's a relationship for most people they just want to be loved naturally oh if only they could fall in love with jesus and feel his spiritual love there's nothing greater than the spiritual love of jesus christ to know that he loved you so much he died for you he took every scourging that belonged to you brother he took every slap on the face that belonged to me he took every rip of hair of beard and hair you could rip out he took every one of that but the bible said for the joy that was set before that he might share the spoils with the strong amen the strong ones the ones that really love the lord the ones that really want to declare that he's alive he took every one of those and the first one god tells moses tell those brothers now of course it was everybody but for me tell those brothers in iowa get all the secret idols out of your life verse 16 honor your parents right verse 17 don't steal land don't steal property sounds a lot like the ten commandments don't it the next one is judge treat the fatherless the widow and the stranger the right way don't mistreat those that don't have a dad or don't have a husband or wife you take care of them and the next many in verses 20 down to 23 are sexual sins keep your body speared you know paul said that he said is the will of god that you be sanctified and abstain from fornication there's his brother he's been emailing me overseas for a month for years and he said brother jesse he said is the message right i just can't overcome pornography and the holy spirit just come on me brother brooks and i said the holy spirit actually i was preaching came on me and gave me the answer peter said resist the devil and he'll flee so i wrote him back in capital letters when was the last time you resisted like you would resist someone breaking in your door most you would get out your gun or hopefully you wouldn't run away like a scaredy cat or something like that i said when was the last time you resisted him and fought him off he said well i have to do that i haven't done that he emailed me yesterday a couple days ago he said brother jesse he said i haven't gone to pornography for a whole month it's never happened before hallelujah that's the word amen the power of the word it's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart i don't even know the man how could i have the answer because it's not my answer it's god's answer amen you've got to resist it remember hebrews says we haven't even resisted on the blood jesus resisted unto bleeding right he took the beatings he resisted fighting back he even resisted cursing them because he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing even resisted cursing them what a loving love what a loving god we serve what a loving savior fighting in verse 24 smiting your neighbors secretly right killing their influence verse 25 slaying an innocent person and then verse 26 if you don't keep all of it your curse thank god jesus kept all the word of god he's the only one that can keep that one praise god amen hallelujah born of a virgin right not born of a sinner in iniquity my mother did conceive me in iniquity but he wasn't conceived of mary and joseph he was conceived of god the father and god the mother amen god created the blood cell hallelujah and then he come and dwelt in that life amen hallelujah the blood of god and then he could keep all the word because it's a new creation he's the beginning of the creation of god the bible said brother joel he was the firstborn but i was one of the ones born after him praise god if he's the first there's got to be a second or else why would you use the first hallelujah there's got to be a second or third i don't know where i've fallen there but i was one of them i was one of those born by the word amen i came forth and was a child of god i wasn't before spiritually but i come forth as a screaming kick and crying acts 2 38 youngin and that's the only kind the word can produce oh my hallelujah the only kind the word can produce then in verse 28 he said if you do i'm sorry chapter 28 all of these will bless you verse 3 and whether you live in the city or field i just kind of highlight some of these the fruit of your body your children will be blessed your cattle your sheep in verse five when you come in and go out we're having some awful turbulence and this scripture came to you brother brooks i just had to close my eyes because i got real scared on planes i don't know about you but i just get scared on planes and i just i just in my heart the spirit of the scripture came i just closed my eyes closed my bible and said lord you're blessing my way in and you're blessing my way out that's how it's only way i can deal with it i'm either blessed or cursed i'm blessed amen hallelujah his favor his grace is upon me and we've got to claim it in everything amen i don't want some areas where i'm cursed and then others where i'm blessed i want to obey all of it praise god because the bible says if you blessed or if you honor god in all you're blessed in all oh thank you jesus verse 8 the lord shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses and in all that thou satisfying hands to do some of your brothers well we're all going to grow up god's either going to bless all of it some of it or none of it what i mean by that is either gonna be a wise virgin he's gonna bless all of it or a foolish virgin bless some of it or the make believer or unbeliever bless none of it now we know satan does a lot of the blessing for the unbeliever right they sell their souls for the devil he rewards them for a while but that's all temporary saints we're not storing up treasures on this earth we're storing up treasures in heaven amen we've got to have heavenly bank accounts praise god we should be more interested in a heavenly bank account than our although we got to have some he'll bless it but we got to be more interested in sowing up treasures in heaven that's a real man of god blessed is all that you do in verse 10 the bible said they even be afraid of you if you keep god's word sinners will be afraid of you they'll fear you they'll know they're around somebody who's got an anointing on them praise god hallelujah now verse 12 he says again the lord shall open unto his good treasure the heaven to give the rain unto thy land in his season and to bless all ever say already all the work of thine hands and thou shalt lend unto many nations and thou shalt not borrow now prosperity preachers they are major on this one right but there's a balance to it because the bible says the lord make us some poor you make us some rich and what i've seen in my life is just seasons seasons where i got a very little extra and then seasons where i got a lot extra but then it seems like that then back to the regular one and that's okay because i don't want to serve that i don't want to fall i never want to trust in that paul said don't trust in uncertain riches here today the bible said they got eagle wings you know you're we talk about egos all the time but your money's got eagle wings too the bible says your money flies away like eagles see i see the i see the experienced men laughing in the back there finally feel like wow thank the lord well here comes this the dishwasher you know the washer died and ah see ya just as fast as it came as fast as it goes but there's always another season of god's reign there's always another season jesus will make you the head in verse 13 not the tail that means you're in you're in control the head's in control the head tells the rest of the body what to do trouble is some of us are good just getting dragged around like a tail the devil's dragging you around and taking you here taking you there why don't you stand up and be the head praise god that means preeminence right the thinking the decision-making when the holy ghost is anointing you you're in control praise god by the holy spirit amen hallelujah the devil doesn't push you around you tell him where to go praise god amen you rebuke him like jesus said get behind me satan hallelujah he said it is so it is written get behind me he'll leave you for a season praise god that's right now he goes through all the curses next you're familiar the curses will overtake you now look at verse 20. now this proves look at verse 20. it proves lot was blessed partially but partially cursed look at verse 20 the lord shall send upon thee cursing vexation didn't that ring a bell and rebuke in all that i set aside hand unto for to do until thou be destroyed until thou perish quickly do you remember ii peter 2 verse 8 the bible said lot was vexed by all the things he heard and saw daily in sodom abraham lived under the full blessing hallelujah but lot compromised and he had partial blessings partial curses oh may god help us to never accept that right you're a king and priest under god are you not well king can either accept a rebellion against it or you can squash it brother joy glory he can either deal with it or he can avoid it or ignore it brothers let's not ignore it let's face it and let's be more than a conqueror quit you like men praise god i love joshua brother brooks and in deuteronomy god told moses he said you go tell joshua to only be strong and courageous moses goes to joshua said you're the next one to come i'm going to anoint you he said only be strong and very courageous and now joshua's heard it twice moses dies they're going to promise land god comes specifically to joshua hears the third time only be strong and very courageous if you read the chapter of chapter 1 and joshua at the end the chief priests are saying we're going to overcome as long as we're only strong and very courageous joshua's hearing it from moses he's hearing it from god he's hearing it from the chief priest but it didn't get into his mouth until chapter 10 when he had those five kings on their heads he put his foot on their heads just like the bible said god will bruise satan under your feet shortly praise god amen and then finally when joshua had those five under his foot he said israel look and see what god has done he said only be strong and very courageous he heard that promise so much that he eventually became it fulfilled it and started speaking it himself praise god that's what we need we need to keep hearing the brightest blameless the bride can do the greater works amen keep hearing that hearing that hearing that until you become it praise god until you manifest those things that's the blessing of god that the word you've been hearing for so long you become it you hear it from the prophet you hear from god hear from the pastor you hear from the chief priest you hear from everybody but it's got to come out of your mouth praise god that's part of the blessing there's life and death in the power of the tongue let me tell a little testimony here at the beginning of the pandemic a brother in our church vang brother brooks knows him he's two years younger than me he's 38. his dad had a heart attack died at their house they called the ambulance they shocked him and brought him back to life that was on a tuesday wednesday they took in the hospital wednesday morning now this is april i think it's coronavirus last year right in the height of it the brother called me up i was just studying at my desk probably eight o'clock in the morning now that night i had trouble sleeping which is strange because i like to sleep but i woke up i had three scriptures on my mind the first one was proverbs 18. there's power of life and death in the tongue and i woke up early i couldn't go to sleep some strange reason well now i know what it was for the brother called and said now this is the son-in-law the son-in-law called bang's brother-in-law said our father died but he brought back he's in the hospital with a coma i said brother i said let's speak the word of god i said i couldn't sleep last night and the scripture that came to my mind was there's life and death in the power of the tongue i took that cell phone out there just as anybody would and i said i speak to that mountain of heart attack and that coma i speak to that mountain i rebuke that mountain in the name of jesus christ you're going to move he's going to come out of there well now i had faith when i said it but he remained in a coma for three weeks brother troy then we started really praying well did i speak the word or not we had a sermon i was preaching on acts the beginning of the philippian church where they took the prayer clause and while i'm preaching that he fasted that day and i said brother jose i said don't you have a prayer call from william branham he said yes i said go get it after service we prayed and i said brother van gaal lay this prayer call from brother branham go lay it on your dad now they only could get in there they hardly could get in there at all but they let him in and before they when they let him in brother brooks they said you got to unplug him let him die let him die the brother bank said no i can't do that they let him in there they laid the prayer cloth on him and brother vang said for two days brother brother brother brooks brother vang quiet brother fang he's just a little guy he sat there and whispered in the room these are lying vanities three-week coma no act no brain activity nothing he said lying vanities i thought i never thought i'd see that kind of faith in that little guy there that's how god does it right he hides himself in simplicity two days later brother brooks he opened his eyes and started talking three weeks in a coma a couple days after that he started walking around a couple days after that they let him go home he's completely well just like the word of god said by speaking the word of god we have the ability to bless with our words or curse and if we're led of the holy spirit we'll say the right thing at the right time hallelujah lying vanities so when i had coronavirus in october when i had it i don't have any more but i hadn't i had fever for a day and a half and guess what i was saying lying vanities lying vanities i didn't feel a thing other than pain lying vanities lying vanities within two days i was up sweeping the house cleaning taking out the trash a little trouble breathing but the lord brought me through it and i learned from the brother of angst testimony i learned from a saint the congregation how to speak against sickness in fact all 10 people my family had it even the baby had coronavirus but god has cleaned that test that pestilence out of our house just like he promised in the bible he said if you diligently hearken unto me he said these pestilences will not stay on you praise god i'll be your healer aren't you glad we have a healer today amen the great physician praise god and so we we learn through these trials to stay in the blessing of god to speak the word of god now we i want to just say this we got to make sure first and this is the point i was going to get to it has to be a revelation of god's word first now we can speak anything we want like we've seen people speak i don't know if brother brooks remembers but some of our friends would speak well i claim i'm going to marry that girl and they didn't end up marrying that girl because that wasn't the word of god now this is years ago brother so there's nobody in here i've seen i've seen girls do the same thing young people like you like you sisters say oh i know the lord showed me that and it turned out not to be so the thing to do church is have a revelation first make sure it's the word of god and you speak god's word you know it's revealed to you and then you diligently obey the word of god and the bible says you obey and then you have patience before you inherit the promise of god so let's go through the order revelation right obey patience inherit we don't like that third one too much that patience but it's part of the order the hebrews writer said it he said you need to be followers of those who inherit the promises of god amen you need patience to wait to inherit the blessings of god praise the lord may god grant patience to us today right we're in need of patience that after we've done the will of god we might inherit the promises now the question is what promises do you wanna inherit i'm not gonna ask you to raise your hands but how many of you how many you brothers would like a godly wife you have to raise your hands how many brothers would like children that love the lord who would serve the lord this is how much i wanted to be married i don't know if i'd ever told brother brooks this but i said lord could you hold off the rapture a few years so i could get married that's what i prayed i'm glad he has brother branham said preach like the rapture is going to be 10 years he said live like it right now so i've taken that as some good advice preach like you've got a little time before the rapture he said but live like you're ready right now like you're ready right now are we a reflection of christ are we a reflection of all the blessings of god upon our lives like we should be let me close with something here by god's grace i preach about an hour yeah it's almost been an hour i had all these notes and i didn't even really stay on all this study and all this praying try to feel led by the holy spirit brother brahm says we've got to meet the conditions of the word first how many want to see blessings meet the conditions of the word first and then god pours out the blessings i heard a preacher say it like this if i can find it it was a really good quote can i find that yeah the preacher passed on now but he said really you don't need to chase the blessings that's where our brothers get so caught up in our sisters they're trying to chase a blessing the preacher said you don't need to chase the blessing what you need to do is meet the conditions god will take care of the blessings just just say lord let me just fall in love with serving you every day like just let me just fall in love with reading my bible every day and testifying and singing and having a prayer life right and being a real pillar at the church for brother brooks right be a real pillar in the house of god you know that's one of the rewards for the overcomer but how are they going to be a pillar there if they're not a pillar here brother right god help you brothers to be pillars amen so stable you're there all the time david said i got one desire to dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life a man after god's own heart i know some of you are by god's grace somebody got that look on your face you love the house of god i love the house of god it is the highlight to my week it's the highlight to my weekend i love coming here because i see jesus christ making himself real the same yesterday today and forever i can't i can't bring all the promises of the past but i sure won't get in the way of anybody else that can bring it to pass we had a brother a couple years ago he had he's a veteran i don't know if i told you this testimony two years ago the doctor the veteran's doctor said you need a hip replacement he's 43 years old we were at a youth meeting i heard him say that and brother or something brother brooks something just rose up at me i'm like i said brother i said do you do you accept that he said no i said there's life and death in the power of the tongue i said you don't need a hip replacement you're 43 years old i said have you conf have you done any sins i said confess it now he said no i said then let's pray that god will heal your hips so we did we prayed right i said pastor jim so let's pray we prayed three days later i'm working out in the yard i'm just you know weeding or something like that i'm sweating it's june you know it's hot i get a call and said brother they got my results from the mri back the doctor said we don't know what happened but your hips healed themselves and you don't need hip he needed a double hip transplant and he preached at our church a few weeks ago and he said he just walks on me he's completely made whole church there is power of life and death in your tongue but you first got to make sure the blessings in your life praise god if you want to speak life let's get the life giver in our souls first praise god amen hallelujah let me close i gotta save a little bit for tomorrow i've actually been pretty good i feel pretty calm tonight like i've contained myself pretty good brother said you he said if you don't have a revelation you speak the word until you do get a revelation in other words always stay positive like the three hebrew children right they didn't have a thus saith the lord they didn't have a revelation all they knew is i will not worship idols amen in other words honor the word that you know to be right until god gives you the next revelation of what's right i'm not a prophet i know i heart but i hardly ever walk into any situation knowing things in advance brother books i'm i'm no prophet that's for sure but i know if i can smell that devil and sense that sin smell on him ah i know i got a gift of discernment sometimes right i seem to operate just call it out and i know if i can just humble myself and just get under the anointing of the holy spirit pretty soon he'll show me exactly what to do and i've just got to obey i can't compromise and god will show up he'll come on the scene praise god raise your hand if you're married in here any brothers married oh my goodness praise god the future leaders the future leaders i'm speaking to future leaders here today this this afternoon if there is another generation now remember brother branham said there wouldn't be another generation yet there is because it wasn't thus saith the lord it was his own opinion but brothers you don't know there may be another generation after you right there may be we don't know how long the lord will tarry but you know what we're gonna need mighty men of god we're going to need soldiers warriors who have the revelation what's what's the revelation the shield of faith faith is a revelation of what the will of god so when you get the will of god brothers and you know the will of god you can extinguish every fiery dart just by obeying the will of god that you know that's all you've got to do i know god's will for this i can extinguish that i can stop that i'm not going to let that hit me and burn my life and destroy my life and destroy my future i'm going to stop it with the shield of faith praise god i'm going to stop the temptation with the shield of faith the shield of revelation of god's will on my life amen praise god that's my hour praise god have you been blessed today i trust something was said that blessed your heart you don't have to chase any blessings brothers they'll come chasing you let's stand i'm going to tell a couple more testimony is that okay i come from a dirt poor family we were so poor brothers sisters we had five gallon buckets we had about ten of them and they would catch the rain water the rain just flowed right into our house so when god blessed me with a garage and a house that didn't leak i started crying i cried because we had a garage i had a house that didn't leak it makes me weep it makes me thank god because i know what it's like to be under a curse of a divorce but because i've honored the word of god we enjoy simple blessings like that in our lives that's just a small natural and he said if you will diligently hearken to my voice these blessings are going to chase you down this year was the greatest of all the blessings somebody passed away and gave us an inheritance check the biggest check i've ever got brother brooks well i'm sorry i wasn't to
