Amen. For Amen. Just a little testimony before I Amen. Pray. Amen. Just want to thank the Lord for was a couple weeks ago I uh um one of our vehicles, my daughter's vehicle, uh all of a sudden went into drive and it would just smack it. It hit something. So almost right away I knew it was a transmission and uh so an old car when you have to change a transmission it can get pretty expensive and sometimes worth more than the car. So I you know just I just asked the Lord and just uh you know something that we can afford or whatnot. And of course you look on Google and those places and they tell you it's three to $5,000 easy you know to replace a transmission. Yeah, that was a lot, you know. So, you know, I just, you know, I I don't typically worry about things too too much. So, I just kind of put it in the hands of the Lord and called the uh brought it to the the the station. Um, and he called me the next day. He says, "I can't believe it. I got a transmission for $850. We can put it in for total of $1,800." I said, "Do it." Amen. And so I thank the Lord for for those, you know, just little things. God blesses you. Amen. I could go on. I mean, every day at my work, I'm over my head and in things to do and and responsibilities, but the Lord just sets the path straight and I end up the day I'm like, I got it all done somehow. So, I just thank the Lord for those kind of things. Amen. Praise God. Amen. He's a Hallelujah. He said in the revelations, I think it's revelation, he says, will I find faith at the end. Amen. And he also says he loves the angel of the Lord's loves that song only believe. Amen. So, Amen. That's what we ought to do. Amen. Let's just bow our heads.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's give God a round of applause. &gt;&gt; Brother Diego did a good job. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. When the brother texts me and asked could he do it, I'm like wonderful. The more the marrier. &gt;&gt; So I I appreciate him. And so whenever you do it and you want to break out with a song, &gt;&gt; you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; By God's grace, uh, you know, I love the African songs even though I don't understand. So that's what I'm saying. whenever God want use you in that way. So we appreciate the Lord Jesus. I have a testimony as well similar to what our brother you know I I spent a lot of money like you said from my 2017 car and and I had already said I'm done putting money down this thing and something was leaking. I don't know what it was. It looked clear. So, I went down in the in the garage and I kind of swiped my finger. It was kind of sticky. I thought it was some kind of oil. I don't know what it really was. And uh I just turned it up a little bit. Um because uh I wanted to know what it was so that if I had to sell it, I would tell the person to whom I would sell it to the problems that existed. But then I I I even went yesterday looking around for a car and I thought I don't see nothing I like. But I said to the Lord, I I prayed. I said, "Now, God," I said, "Uh, you've done so many things for me, and I know you can fix this leak, whatever it is." So, I took it to the shop today, and they told me it was going to do cost me $80 to do a diagnostic. And uh they did the diagnostic and couldn't find no leak. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, somebody. There was a leak, &gt;&gt; but they couldn't find no leak. &gt;&gt; And then when I got to the place, they've got a new guy there. He saw me come in. He said, uh, either he said, "Praise the Lord," or "God bless you." I looked at him and he just grinning. He said, "I want you to know we didn't charge you anything." &gt;&gt; Not only did God bless me because they told me they were going to charge me $80. And I said, "Well, that's fine. That's fine." But God says, "No." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I was walking. While I was walking after um he told me there was no leak, God reminded me that I prayed that he would heal the car &gt;&gt; and God did just. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I believe this is the hour and the day. I'm sorry we don't have an interpreter, but this is the time that I believe God wants to do something with the bride of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the adoption time. This is a time that we are to be made manifest. But the only way that we can do this is that we must believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've gone with this message for years now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But somehow we got to ask God to give us the grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To hold fast to the word and really believe it like we ought to. &gt;&gt; Uh as we stand, pray for my wife. She's not feeling well today. She's just overwhelmed. tired and um had to do school today. So otherwise she would have been here. But I saw it over and I said, "Honey, if you don't feel like it, you know, you don't you don't have to come." She has some things a particular item on the stove that overcooked, right? You know what that means, right? But by the grace of God, I knew that was a sign she was well tired. So, Acts 4 and 12, I do my best. I'm going to go as slow as I possibly can so that those of you who don't understand English as well, you may be able to get something tonight. It was a surprise to me. um that there was going to not not anyone going to be here. So, but by the grace of God, God works all things according to his will. Acts 4:12, neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved. Amen. Acts 8 and it reads, "But ye shall receive power, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, in all Judea, in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth." &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us pray. Dear heavenly father God, we thank you for your grace and your mercy. We thank you for being so good to us. Lord, you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves. And Father, we thank you, Father, for your presence. Most of all, we thank you for your saving grace. We thank you, Father, for being our atonement. We thank you for the blood of your dear son, Jesus Christ. It is in his blood that we trust, in his word that we trust. And we thank you, Father God, for all that you do for us, giving praise, glory, and honor to your name. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. You may be seated. I want to say on last Wednesday when we preached uh here, no I didn't preach. I'm sorry. Thank brother Miss Paul preached. It was such a blessing to me. I was I was extremely tired and I didn't realize that I was fighting something. It was uh some kind of bug something because my wife was fighting too. Um Amen. So, uh this new suit that I have on, it was given to me. Okay. So, that you know, but I I just want I felt a need to say that. But anyhow, in all that we do, we must understand by the grace of God. Amen. That God is always in control. I was uh really had to preach down there on Thursday night. And honestly, I've traveled from the United States to South Africa from af out of the out of the plane into the pool pit preaching three to four hours. And I never was as tired as I was on Thursday in South Carolina. Didn't know what I was going to do. I knew I had to minister. I felt the uncction to do so. But physically everybody saw how fatigued or tired I was. Nevertheless, I went forth and God did bless. On Friday night, uh they had a different minister, Jimmy. Uh he is from uh Zambia and he ministered a great service by the grace of God. And um after service they had a friend of mine, her name is Hannah Ojar. I have known her uh when she was a little or young girl just getting married maybe a year or two. Um I knew her father who was uh a precious pastor there in Trinidad who was also a friend of mine. Let me jump. She is very gifted. You know dreams, visions, you name it. The Lord uses her in a mighty way. her husband is the pastor uh where she where they reside and they work together going on missionary trips and sponsoring uh missionaries whether they be from Africa, whether they be from South America. God has blessed her to do so. So anyway, I was inspired after all of her testimonies. Her testimonies were uh phenomenal. I, you know, hopefully she'll come here one day with with uh with those testimonies. At least I invited her. Um um so I went after service and I asked her to lay hands on me for those of you who may have a problem with that. She laid hands and I said, "Pray for me." And um I said, "I'm not going to even tell you what to pray for." But anyway, she prayed for me and the next morning my throat was healed. I was so swollen back there. I could barely, you know, see anything back there. It was just swollen and everything. But God healed me. &gt;&gt; And so I was able to testify because I wanted to, you know, with with the healing, I wanted to make all the skeptics know &gt;&gt; that what God was doing to this, this lady is a very wonderful sister clothed in humility. She's not trying to be a pastor or preacher. she just let him go and let God. &gt;&gt; And so anyway, we had the greatest meeting and I mean, we've had many uhh tent meetings down there, and I can't remember when I first started, but I feel and believe that the one we just had was the greatest of all. uh because we had people delivered, we had people receiving the Holy Ghost and most of all we had people who were saved, got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Uh it was and every message were were geared toward the sinner, the visitor. So anyway, we was really grateful uh for that in in the name of Jesus. Liy of the belly, let your sweet aroma feel my life. Rose of Sharon, show me how to grow in beauty in thy sight. Fest of 10,000. Make me a reflection of your life. Oh day star, shine down on me. Let your love shine through me in the night. Oh, lead me, Lord. I follow anywhere you up the door. Oh, [Music] let your word speak to me. Show me things I'd never seen before. Oh Lord, I want to be a witness. You can take what's wrong and make it right. Oh, day star shine down on me. Let your love shine through me in the night. Lord, I want to see a witness. I'm sorry. Master of deceit. Groping in the darkness. Haunted by the years of past. [Music] But when I see you standing near me, shining with compassion in your eyes. Oh day shall shine down on me. Let your love shine through me in the night. Hallelujah. Oh, lead me Lord. I'll follow anywhere you open up the door. Oh, let your words be to me. Show me things I never seen before. [Music] Oh, and Lord, I want to be a witness. You can take what's wrong and make it right. Oh day stars shine down on me. Let your love shine through me in the night. Oh, lead me, Lord. I follow. Anywhere you open up the door. [Music] Let your word speak to me. Show me things I never seen before. Oh. Oh. And Lord, I want to be a witness. You can take what's wrong and make it right. Oh, take the dying down on me. Let your love shine through me in the night. Oh Jesus, shine down on me. Let your love shine through me in the night. Oh Jesus, shine down on me. Let your love shine through me in the night. Amen. God is good to us. Amen. Appreciate the Lord. like to entitle this message given authority to the bride. I'm learning something. And I'm learning that we have been saying for years that we trust God. We believe God. But when it comes to problems, we seem to have a hard time trusting him. We know that the trials come to test us to see whether we believe or not. &gt;&gt; And to say that you believe and then the trials come and you falter and fail is just evident that you don't believe. Revelations 10:7-8 it says, "But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound the mystery," not mysteries, and I've heard that uh quoted wrong so many times, but there is one mystery of God should be finished as He had declared unto his servants the prophets. So even though there are multiple mysteries in this message, there is one major mystery that God wanted to reveal to us. &gt;&gt; And and that mystery is himself. &gt;&gt; And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again. Now listen to this. and said, "Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth." Now, the mystery of God and then he tells him, "Go take the book." It's a continuation of what this mystery of God &gt;&gt; is about. And we find out according to the prophet of God that our names were placed in the lamb's book of life &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. So that lamb book is a part of the mystery &gt;&gt; of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Y'all understand what I'm saying? Ah, I like to say it here because when God created Adam, this is a mystery. He created him male and female. [Music] and a female with a feminine nature. &gt;&gt; Both Adam both Adams responded to the name when called. In other words, when God would call Adam both male and female would respond because &gt;&gt; according to Genesis 5 &gt;&gt; their name one name their name &gt;&gt; was called Adam understand this is a mystery &gt;&gt; brother Brandham brought it out so clearly throughout the message They shared the authority together. &gt;&gt; They were co-equal. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; They were both They were the God of Eden. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. They were the god &gt;&gt; and they were the ones to teal the ground, &gt;&gt; teal the soil. Just read. They were the one &gt;&gt; who were going to teal the soil. Uh cultivate. The cultivation &gt;&gt; was not by the sweat of their brow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Was not by physical labor. &gt;&gt; The cultivation was by the spoken word. Is that right? Not only did they govern the earth, &gt;&gt; but they had power over the atmosphere atmosphere. &gt;&gt; They regulated the temperature. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; They had control over nature. And they both were without sin during this time. &gt;&gt; And we don't know how long the reign was. [Music] But Adam was the God of this earth. &gt;&gt; Now understand what I'm saying. could not have been God on the earth had there not been a God above the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Had there not been a God above the earth. Um, Adam was the God of this earth &gt;&gt; and Elohim was the God of all &gt;&gt; until the female Adam was beguiled to believe Satan's lie. Her nature was changed and the wonders of Adam was separated, broken &gt;&gt; until Adam took her back. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He became the sacrifice of his wife. could not restore himself, nor could he resto restore his wife. Because of her uh fall, &gt;&gt; she became the mother of all living. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is why we needed a second Adam to restore what the first Adam could not do. [Music] needed a perfect blood. We needed someone without sin who would believe all of the word keep all of the word. It was the second Adam that was able to fix what the first Adam broke. &gt;&gt; Jesus was the perfect blood. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I want to say it like like I'm getting ready to say it. &gt;&gt; Because of the blood of Jesus, &gt;&gt; he is now restored. Eden, &gt;&gt; Eden, Eden &gt;&gt; is now restored. &gt;&gt; The earth is restored. &gt;&gt; Heaven is restored. &gt;&gt; Everything that was broken, the first Adam, the second Adam has restored. We have not yet come into that manifestation of all things. Calvary was enough &gt;&gt; because the second Adam when he was crucified &gt;&gt; before he died. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said it's finished. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This second Adam was the beginning of God's creation. He was to establish a new race, a people that would come on the earth and would be exactly the kind of man and the kind of woman that God had in his mind. from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, when we get to heaven, I'm jumping. It &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful thing. &gt;&gt; What God is doing now, the time of the fall, at the time of the restoration of all things, God is collecting his seed. is collecting his sons. God is collecting his daughters. God is collecting all of the family of God. Glory to God. Glory to God. If Adam had not sinned, &gt;&gt; all of his all of his offspring all of his offspring, all of his children &gt;&gt; would bear the name Adam. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the second Adam, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Because of his victory, &gt;&gt; all of his children bear his name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because in Ephesians 3 &gt;&gt; 14-1 17 the Bible said for this cause I draw my knee unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named. Hallelujah. That he would grant you according to the riches of his glory &gt;&gt; to be strengthened with might by the spirit in the inner man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That Christ may dwell in your heart by what? Faith. &gt;&gt; That we be rooted and grounded in love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you got to realize the second Adam was the king of love. &gt;&gt; I like to say it like that because he come for his queen. The queen must be the queen of love. Hallelujah. She must be bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. Hallelujah. the age that we're living in, &gt;&gt; God is bringing us into little by little conquering the enemy. Little by little, we're literally going back to where we had fallen from. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But right now, &gt;&gt; the Bible says according to St. H first John, &gt;&gt; now are we the sons of God, &gt;&gt; and it does not yet appear, and we shall be like, and we know that we'll be just like him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; An apple bring forth apples. An apple tree bring forth an apple tree. &gt;&gt; An orange tree bring forth oranges. Understand me. &gt;&gt; And God bring forth God. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; We the devil don't want us to know &gt;&gt; who we really are. He makes us look at this flesh. This flesh is condemned. Hallelujah. This is this has never been really &gt;&gt; truly the true image of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because you got to remember when mankind was first created, &gt;&gt; he was created spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Speak. &gt;&gt; And then God formed man. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Then God formed man &gt;&gt; out of the dust of the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Understand that by the grace of God. So what are we returning back to? &gt;&gt; We're returning back to a man and a woman &gt;&gt; that's going to truly every word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are created &gt;&gt; and ordained to believe the word for this day. &gt;&gt; And I mean all of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; We didn't come to be coward. &gt;&gt; We we the bride &gt;&gt; will not lose users. &gt;&gt; But the Bible tells us that we are more than conquerors &gt;&gt; through Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you what, we believe &gt;&gt; that we are God's chosen people. &gt;&gt; We believe that we stand before God as a changed virgin. We believe that the power and authority of the word given to us &gt;&gt; according to acts 1 and8 to acts 1 and8 &gt;&gt; where the bible says &gt;&gt; you shall receive power which the holy ghost has come. We believe Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If he heal the sick yesterday, heal the sick today. Do it yesterday. &gt;&gt; He delivers the people today. So he changes character. of a prostitute in her, &gt;&gt; a real daughter of God today. The eyes of a blind man today doing it today. Hallelujah. Y'all hear what I'm saying? We believe what the word says. And we believe it piece of message &gt;&gt; upon the things you've heard. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; St. John 17 &gt;&gt; 22- 26 26. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them that they may be one. even as we are one, &gt;&gt; I in them, thou in me, &gt;&gt; that they may be perfect in one, &gt;&gt; and that the world may know, &gt;&gt; that thou has sent me &gt;&gt; and has loved them as thou has loved me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, watch this. &gt;&gt; The world may know that you sent me. Hallelujah. Now, how will they know? &gt;&gt; Because you've been sent. &gt;&gt; And if you've been sent by God, &gt;&gt; they will see God in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Father, I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am." &gt;&gt; That they may behold my glory which thou has given me. For thou loveth me before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are you reading, Brother Brooks? &gt;&gt; Reading that were in the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Why would you say that? &gt;&gt; Because it is the lamb speaking these things. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; St. John 17. Jesus is speaking things that has one time been a mystery. You hear what I'm saying? Even his disciples didn't understand it, &gt;&gt; but he was laying it out for the bride of this day. She'll know she was with him before the foundation of she needs to know. All the love hear her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Like he loved him. Why? &gt;&gt; Because when Jesus the firstborn of God creation &gt;&gt; was male and female. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like in the beginning, first Adam created the first Adam male and female and in Jesus Christ. was male and female. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I open up the the womb or the side of Adam. &gt;&gt; The first Amen. &gt;&gt; But the second Adam hadn't fallen. &gt;&gt; Somebody help me here. &gt;&gt; God didn't bring out a Eve. &gt;&gt; Adam second Adam. Jesus Christ. He didn't bring out an Eve. He brought out another Jesus. &gt;&gt; He brought out another Christ. &gt;&gt; He was born of his bone, flesh of his flesh. &gt;&gt; He kept the word. She kept the word also. They thought it was just blood and water. They thought it was just blood and water flowing from his side. Hallelujah. But they did not understand what God was doing. He was building a bride. Hallelujah. Out of blood, water, and spirit. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. And these three agree in one. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what he was doing. &gt;&gt; And right now, light of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; is learning about his authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if she can see his authority, &gt;&gt; she'll be able to see her authority. &gt;&gt; Come on. There was not a demon in hell. Jesus. Hallelujah. God didn't care if they were blind. &gt;&gt; He didn't care if they were lame. Hallelujah. He didn't even care if they were dead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not even death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Could hold that body down &gt;&gt; when Jesus called for it. &gt;&gt; Somebody help me here. &gt;&gt; That's the authority of the bride. God revealed to you that you can pray for somebody. All you got to do is speak the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that right? &gt;&gt; When Jesus When Jesus walked down to the tomb of Lazarus, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He knew exactly what he went down there to do. He told those disciples of his that Lazarus was sleeping. &gt;&gt; He didn't understand them. &gt;&gt; Those who are in Christ Jesus We can never die. &gt;&gt; We might go to sleep. Body may lay in the grave for a long time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It may even rot into dust. Hallelujah. But the real you and the real me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When we leave this body, &gt;&gt; we're like Paul, we said we know Whatever that could be dissolved, we have a building. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This this this you you real you &gt;&gt; is covered by this oinful body. &gt;&gt; These old days, &gt;&gt; God is going to call for his children. Hallelujah. God will call for his children and they will have to get up on somebody. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. You say, "Well, what do you mean, brother Brooks?" If Jesus had not called Lazarus by name, Amen. But he calls you by your name. One of these old days, I believe he's going to call &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It doesn't matter where you are. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter if they put you in the fire and burn you up. &gt;&gt; Every element, &gt;&gt; every element &gt;&gt; that represents you &gt;&gt; don't have to come back together. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Even when Lazarus was raised from the deadlines got jealous of him. &gt;&gt; The Pharisees got jealous of him in order to put him to death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when God call us &gt;&gt; from the grave, &gt;&gt; death has lost his whole. &gt;&gt; This is why Paul, &gt;&gt; he understood who he was. &gt;&gt; He understood he was facing death. Brother Brandham said he laughed in the death face. &gt;&gt; Paul laughed. in the face of death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know why? &gt;&gt; Because Paul didn't have to conquer death. You don't have to conquer death. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we fall asleep, we don't have to worry about whether we going to get up. The Bible said the same spirit you that was also in Christ Jesus quickened his body quicken your body. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God Jesus prayed &gt;&gt; in St. John that God would give us the glory that he had with the father before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus gave us that glory. &gt;&gt; And I was just thinking, Lord, what was the glory &gt;&gt; that a man can live like God? Somebody help me here. The glory of Jesus Christ could not be something separate from God. &gt;&gt; It had to be God. &gt;&gt; And in Jesus, the Bible said, dwelt the fullness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Godhead body. So the glory of God in Jesus Christ was the very nature of God. the very of nature of God. God was in Christ. Y'all better hear me. &gt;&gt; God was in Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the fullness of the Godhead was in Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And listen what brother Brandham said. All that was in God into Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and all that was in Christ born into his church. Hallelujah. See the glory of God nature of God. &gt;&gt; No nature, no glory but glory as high as God's glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is God. Say Jeremy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to J. You love the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we allow &gt;&gt; Satan &gt;&gt; to really scare us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when fear is driven away, &gt;&gt; his faith will take control. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me? &gt;&gt; And I say it like this. &gt;&gt; They looked at Jesus and let me read it. Let me read it. Matthew the 8th chapter beginning at the 24th verse. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it says, "Behold, &gt;&gt; there arose a great tempest in the sea in so much that the ship was covered with the waves, but he was asleep." Speaking of Jesus, &gt;&gt; and his disciples came to him, &gt;&gt; "And awoke him, saying,"Lord, save us. we perish. &gt;&gt; And he said unto them, why are ye fearful? Oh ye of little faith. Anytime you're fearful, your faith is not where it should be. &gt;&gt; Then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the men marvel, saying, "What manner of man is this &gt;&gt; that even the wind and the sea obey?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "The disciples right here did not have the complete revelation of Jesus Christ." Hallelujah. No man can calm the sea. Hallelujah. No man can stop the war waves. &gt;&gt; No man can stop the wind. He said at that point in time, at that point in time, &gt;&gt; it was not a man who stopped the wind and the storm sea to a calm. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. See, that's the problem. Whenever you see Jesus as a man, you're going to have problems. Hallelujah. Even Paul said, "You don't know him no longer know him no longer after the flesh. Know him after the spirit." If those disciples had known him after the spirit, &gt;&gt; then it would have been known. &gt;&gt; Though the body rested, &gt;&gt; though the body rested, God never sleeps nor slumber. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And often time &gt;&gt; we allow our flesh to describe us. &gt;&gt; We allow our flesh to describe us. &gt;&gt; No need to fear. We can see now &gt;&gt; the Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brandham brought. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, the mighty angel came down &gt;&gt; and put one one foot on the land and one foot on the sea, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And all we see is a man." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I want you to understand that was more than a man. That was God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But God used an image. &gt;&gt; That we might be able to understand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It wasn't an angel. &gt;&gt; You understand me? That angel, he didn't have wings. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was a man and he was showing to us and the authority of the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Given to him conquered the land and the sea, conquered politics, our world that through Calvary. Hallelujah. You understand me? &gt;&gt; So what are you saying? You hear fearing &gt;&gt; Thaw simple faith &gt;&gt; just simple. &gt;&gt; It's not some great &gt;&gt; it's real simple. &gt;&gt; All we had to do is believe God. &gt;&gt; I didn't care whether people thought what they thought about me asking that sister to pray for me. I knew she had a gift of faith that heals &gt;&gt; and I used it for &gt;&gt; some people stumble when a sister is gifted. &gt;&gt; Oh, see how y'all get quiet? &gt;&gt; Y'all think the sisters are just gifted to wash dishes. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; Are you out of your mind? &gt;&gt; In the New Testament, &gt;&gt; prophetist Huh? It's the truth. &gt;&gt; And if we are the New Testament church, &gt;&gt; those gifts are supposed to be among us. &gt;&gt; Oh, y'all scared. &gt;&gt; I just want to see God's will be done. I want to drive all these fears away from people &gt;&gt; and all these traditional nonsense. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Traditional things &gt;&gt; that has nothing to do with God &gt;&gt; or this message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Now talking about the when you when you why fear when you have the seal of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And what is the seal of the Holy Ghost but Christ himself. Jesus Christ conquered it all for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Have faith in him. &gt;&gt; Rest in him and his promises. He said like this. The Old Testament had to naturally conquer everything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? &gt;&gt; They had to conquer Jericho. Hallelujah. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Joshua who had to conquer &gt;&gt; and God gave him the grace. &gt;&gt; Showed what a man could become. Amen. &gt;&gt; If he trust in God, &gt;&gt; you don't have to see a vision. When you know God is God, you speak the word and believe it. No literature. Joshua didn't have no literature. He didn't have a book. He didn't take was the God that he was. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he understood that God was in the battle. I want you to know tonight. Hallelujah. I don't have to fight. He's done it all for me. He's done it all for you. You know what God showed me? I believe it was the Lord. I learned how to rest in the cliff of the rock. Hallelujah. Let the storm come, &gt;&gt; but find your resting place. &gt;&gt; God is your battle. &gt;&gt; God is your warrior. &gt;&gt; God is your conqueror. &gt;&gt; You need to rest in him. &gt;&gt; Trust his word. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen. and possessing the gates of the enemy. [Music] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God is talking. &gt;&gt; He said, "Watch what he did when he was on earth. He conquered and possessed every gate the enemy had. The royal seed by the word conquered it. conquered the gate of of sickness for us. That's what he come to do. He remembered his sick people and the devil would tell you God is not mindful of your being sick. &gt;&gt; But he died on Calvary for your sickness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what he come to do. &gt;&gt; He remembers sick people. He conquered that gate. You don't have to conquer it. He conquered it. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; The other men had to conquer their own gate. &gt;&gt; But you don't have to conquer. He already conquered. He conquered the gate of sickness. And what And what did he do when he conquered the gate of sickness? saying that he would whatever you ask on earth whatever you bound on earth bind it in heaven give us the key to the gate understand me he gave us the key to the gate it's funny it's strange I had a dream just last And God just answered my dream. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, &gt;&gt; Jesus is the key. Jesus is the door. Jesus is the way. Everything. You want to lock the door. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have the key already. &gt;&gt; The name of Jesus. knee shall bow. &gt;&gt; He is Lord to the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He conquered the gate of temptation &gt;&gt; by the word. &gt;&gt; He was resist the enemy &gt;&gt; and he will flee from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So temptation is already conquered &gt;&gt; but your king is resisting. &gt;&gt; If you resist him know he has to flee. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right. Resist the enemy &gt;&gt; and he will flee from you. &gt;&gt; He conquered all conquered every sickness death. hell, death and hell. Conquer what the others couldn't conquer. Hallelujah. All that they couldn't conquer cuz with everything they conquered defeat death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus conquered death. How do you know, brother Brooks, through the third day he got up that he visited us? &gt;&gt; And he said, "This promise promise, &gt;&gt; promise, &gt;&gt; set promise, &gt;&gt; this promise, &gt;&gt; set promise &gt;&gt; is unto you for your children, all that are It's a promise. &gt;&gt; I don't have the Holy Ghost yet. You said if I don't have the Holy Ghost yet, it's yours. &gt;&gt; It's yours for the asking. The devil comes and tell you it's not for you. He's a liar. Resist that. He say you're not worthy. forgive not for tell you you're not worth a gift &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost I must merit &gt;&gt; I don't have to work for it is a gift God has given me the gift you say well wait a minute the Bible says if you repent baptize in the name of Jesus Christ He says, "You shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Put the word on the devil. Back him up in the don't let him steal your joy. Take your life from you. He will give you more than you wanted." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is a Listen, &gt;&gt; because they are of the natural sea. See, talking about Israel and all, they had to conquer their enemy. &gt;&gt; But God conquered the enemy for all of us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know what it was like, &gt;&gt; but when Jesus rose from the dead, And those graves were open. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know what it was like. &gt;&gt; But one of these old days, &gt;&gt; I'll see it for myself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whether I go to the grave or not, &gt;&gt; I know when he gather them &gt;&gt; and when he called them, I'll be one in the number. &gt;&gt; And now we are more than conquerors. That's what he said. &gt;&gt; Not, oh, I'm barely making it. We're more than conquerors. We'll just walk right up right into it as as an inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wants us to walk into it as an inheritance &gt;&gt; more than conquerors. &gt;&gt; Now we are dealing with defeated enemies. &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; You think the devil got something? He is a lying roaring lion. &gt;&gt; He's toothless. &gt;&gt; Toothless. No teeth. He has no authority. You give him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's already defeated. &gt;&gt; See, we forget. &gt;&gt; We forgot. &gt;&gt; He's already defeated. You have to defeat him. Jesus Christ defeated him. Hallelujah. Amen. Maybe you might have to remind him. &gt;&gt; You are defeated. Not by me. Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. If you want to get really personal, if you really want to get personal with him, let him know &gt;&gt; who Jesus is to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I said he's not only my redeemer, my husband. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I want you to know devil. We are one. &gt;&gt; Nothing you can do. Stop the move of God. Amen. And you must believe that. I don't care how grim it looks. You may have a red sea in front of you. &gt;&gt; You may have a red sea in front of you. &gt;&gt; But God done, &gt;&gt; God done conquered the sea already. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, absolutely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; A bad storm come up and you trapped in your car. [Music] &gt;&gt; Speak to the storm. You act like the storm is your God. &gt;&gt; You're God of the storm. &gt;&gt; You are the God of the storm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what Jesus was trying to tell him. &gt;&gt; Be of little faith. &gt;&gt; You are the God of this storm. &gt;&gt; Make this storm obey you. &gt;&gt; Speak to the storm. Come on, somebody. Amen. Remember the storm? &gt;&gt; Brother was in caught in the storm. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then the Holy Spirit was teaching him for his adoption. Y'all hear me? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Speak to the storm. &gt;&gt; Whatever you say, &gt;&gt; the storm will obey. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That ain't just chicken food. &gt;&gt; That's for the eagles. &gt;&gt; When when when the devil comes in like a flood, &gt;&gt; the spirit of the Lord will always lift up a standard. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we must get quiet. &gt;&gt; So God, we can hear the voice of God. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's going to work it out for you, &gt;&gt; but he wants you to work it out. He wants to work it out through you. That's the best way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything is defeated. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "I wish I was twice my size." &gt;&gt; Now maybe I'll feel twice as good. &gt;&gt; We are disputing with the conquered enemy. &gt;&gt; Disputing &gt;&gt; with the conquered enemy. &gt;&gt; Arguing with the conquered enemy. No wonder Paul could say when they was building a block to chop his head off, he said, "Oh death, &gt;&gt; where's your stain? &gt;&gt; Oh grave, &gt;&gt; show me where you can make me squirmer and scream. &gt;&gt; Grave, where is your victory? &gt;&gt; You think you'll mold me out there? I point you to the empty one who who won over there. I am in him and he'll raise me up at the last day. A defeated enemy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm almost done. Royal seed of Abraham. Now, the natural could not point to that. But the royal sea can conquer &gt;&gt; already conquered. &gt;&gt; For he had gone before us &gt;&gt; and conquered every great gate for us. &gt;&gt; Yes, he has. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me tell y'all something. Now, this is came to my mind. &gt;&gt; When I was a boy, &gt;&gt; I was in the seventh grade. &gt;&gt; And I had three guys jump me. They beat me. mistaken identity. &gt;&gt; They threw me on the ground. They kicked me. They stomped me. Whatever they could do to hurt me, they did it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But they didn't know I had a brother. Hallelujah. And my brother &gt;&gt; caught each and every one of them &gt;&gt; and conquered them. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then after he conquered them, &gt;&gt; he called me. &gt;&gt; He told one guy, "Don't you move till I come back." &gt;&gt; We about 15 minutes away from that place. 15 minutes away. When I got back down there, that guy was still there shaking in his shoes. &gt;&gt; And I wasn't a violent man. Even though I had blood streaming down from my face, I believe that was the time my brother got so angry with me cuz I was feeling sorry for the guy. You know, he's crying, his nose running, all of that. He said, "You better beat him." My brother &gt;&gt; told me I need to beat this guy. I swung at the guy deliberately not wanting to hit him. My brother was about ready to beat me after that. &gt;&gt; He was so mad with me. Instead of punching me, he punched the guy again. Boom. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. Y'all understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; See, the battle had already been fought. The victory had already been won. &gt;&gt; The guy had already been conquered. &gt;&gt; What was I supposed to do? &gt;&gt; He was already defeated. &gt;&gt; And I was satisfied. &gt;&gt; They never messed with me again. Never ever ever &gt;&gt; bothered me again. And it's sad to say all three of them died young. right after high school &gt;&gt; and often wonder sometime what that was all about. Let me hurry up. &gt;&gt; I'm almost done. &gt;&gt; The royal seed now the natural seed could not point to that. &gt;&gt; But the royal seed can conquer already conquered. &gt;&gt; For he has gone before us and conquered every gate for us. Are you hearing it? &gt;&gt; Are you hearing it? &gt;&gt; He conquered every gate. &gt;&gt; That means no matter what you're going through, &gt;&gt; it means no matter where Satan's strongholds are, he already conquered. Amen. Not only did he conquer sickness, he conquered sickness, he conquered temptation, he conquered every enemy, he conquered death, he conquered hell. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He conquered the grave and rose up again. and 2,000 years. Here he stands among us afternoon identifying himself, &gt;&gt; the mighty conqueror. &gt;&gt; Do y'all hear what I'm saying? Amen. &gt;&gt; When brother Brandon was here, &gt;&gt; I'm done. But when brother Brandon was here, &gt;&gt; it wasn't the man that was the conqueror. &gt;&gt; It was Christ Jesus who was the conqueror. His job, William Brandham's job was to be able to reflect the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; being alive as the mighty conqueror. How blessed we are and we know the devil is already conquered. That's right. I don't care what you're going through. The devil is defeated. &gt;&gt; And you have to remind that devil, he's defeated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like Joshua needed needed that grant. Needed that grant and he didn't worry about it. See, when you know the devil is defeated, you don't worry. &gt;&gt; You let go and let God have his way. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Let me read this last quote so you he said coming from who do you say this is? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said it like this. There's only one thing that you can put confidence in and that's the word and the word is God. Get that revelation. Amen. If that revelation could truly strike you in your soul, whenever you need God, we go back to the word. Hallelujah. And he says, "And the word anointed makes the Messiah. [Applause] The anointed word of the hour. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. They miss it. The word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me go on with this. This other one here &gt;&gt; is still the word. The word is God. God in every age has allotted much of his word. &gt;&gt; And in there, watch what he said. Did he sent a prophet &gt;&gt; and the word of the Lord comes to the prophet? &gt;&gt; The prophet reveals it to the audience &gt;&gt; and the audience believes it quite understand what he's saying. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you believe it, that puts you into the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then that is God in action. &gt;&gt; God moving by his spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going jump again. &gt;&gt; And I'm just going to read this. &gt;&gt; The word is inspired. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And you have to be inspired with the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is not some dead letter. No sir. &gt;&gt; This is not a dead ladder. &gt;&gt; It's inspired. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's inspired. &gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, brother Brooks. &gt;&gt; And Joshua then was getting ready to cross over. &gt;&gt; Joshua and those 10 spies came back with a bad report. &gt;&gt; Joshua, &gt;&gt; anointed by the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; said to the people, to those who didn't believe it. &gt;&gt; Say it in a short term. &gt;&gt; He said, "Shut up." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Shut up. &gt;&gt; I don't want to hear your unbelief. We're more than conquerors. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't care what kind of giants over there. Hallelujah. My God is the greatest of all giants. created the giants. &gt;&gt; Created the giants. I don't care what comes before you. Your God is God. Let this word inspire you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh. Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't read this word like it's &gt;&gt; just another book. &gt;&gt; But be inspired. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I'mma sing this song in closing. My precious brother uh Randy wrote this song. &gt;&gt; Who have known the mind of the Lord? Who would his count slurp be?

Amen. &gt;&gt; Not only that, if that be something hidden &gt;&gt; that God will reveal. &gt;&gt; We are the bride of Jesus Christ and we've got to start working like we are. &gt;&gt; And I just believe the word. &gt;&gt; God will be faithful to us if we be faithful to his word. &gt;&gt; So we thank God for you, brother. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Glory to your name, Jesus. The more that I surrender the light of my Lord, the more that I release my kiss. The more you take control, the more that I can humble myself, the more you lift me up. And every day I live. Lord, I love you more. The more that I surrender, the light of my Lord. The more that I release my guest, the more you take control. The more that I can humble myself, the more you lift me up. And every day I live. Lord, I love you more. know that I surrender then I am my Lord. &gt;&gt; The more that I release my case, the more you take control, the more that I can myself, the more you lift me up. Every day I Lord I love you more. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; We have a testimony from brother Rashid. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you church. Um it's a pretty quick testimony. um past couple of months of my life. Um we started a little Bible study just a couple of people here and uh we've been reading our Bibles like every Tuesday and Sunday and then sometimes on Friday uh you know just you know reading the word and having a good time and I was really thinking because I look at my life and I'm seeing all these tests and trials and all these different things come about my way. all these lies go in my head and I really think I thought to myself like God why is this happening to me? I feel very lost, you know. And um I realized that this these few months that I've been getting trials and tests is the months that I've actually grown the most in my faith. And I've learned literally more than I've ever learned in these few months. And I'm just realizing it now. And um now that I think about it, I just want to thank God for giving me those trials and allowing me to, you know, be where I am today. Because if I hadn't, you know, have had that Bible study, if I hadn't have had that lesson that I've learned and just in everyday life, I wouldn't be here where I am today. And so I just want to give God the glory for that. Yeah. Uh we have a special meeting this weekend with brother Ben um Saturday and Sunday. Saturday at 6:00 p.m. and Sunday our regular service. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So as we are getting this message, we're going to sing this song. &gt;&gt; Jesus is my savior. I shall not be moved in his love and favor. I shall not be moved. Just like a tree that planted by the waterers, I shall not be moved. Oh, I shall not be. I shall not be moved. I shall not be. I shall not be moved. Just like a tree that planted by the world, I shall not be moved. In Christ, I'm shall not be moved. In his love, I'm hiding. I shall not be moved. Just like a tree that planted by the world. I shall not be moved. Oh, I shall not be I shall not be moved. I shall not be I shall not be moved. Just like a tree not blinded by the word. I shall not be moved. If I trust him ever, I shall not be moved. He will fail me. Never. I shall not be. Just like a tree that planted by the water. I shall not be moved. I shall not be. I shall not be moved. I shall not be. I shall not be. Just like a tree that planted by the world. I shall not be moved. Glory. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I shall not be moved. &gt;&gt; I'm changing over. I shall not be moved. Just like the tree that planted by the word, I shall not be moved. Oh, I shall not be shall be. I shall not be I shall not be moved. Just like the tree that planted by the world. I shall not be God bless your man. Oh, I shall not be I shall not be moved. I shall not be. I shall not be moved. As like a tree that planted by the waterers, I shall not be moved. Glory. Hallelujah. I shall not be moved. And Jehovah shall not move. Just like a tree that planted by the water. I shall not be moved. Hallelujah. I shall not be I shall not be I shall not be moved. Just like a tree the planted by the world. I shall not be moved. [Music]
