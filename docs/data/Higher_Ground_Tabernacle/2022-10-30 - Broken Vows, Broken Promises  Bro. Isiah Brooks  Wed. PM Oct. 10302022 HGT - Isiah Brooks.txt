good and he is good we appreciate the Lord and we had a wonderful time with the Saints from Iowa City yesterday the whole church came up to join with me and my grievement greeting good evening uh it was to my surprise I thought a few brothers would come up here that the whole church would show up Full House and uh it really lightened my burdens real real blessing to me and I will never forget their labor of love to come up with it blessed me in my house and we thank God for all of you and what all you've done as well amen as we stand we're going to ask that you read with us Romans the first chapter excuse me Romans the 11th chapter we read there the fifth verse Ephesians foreign [Music] at this present time also there is a Remnant according to the election of Grace in this particular scripture particular Paul was concerned about the Jews and he was telling the Romans church that in spite of God shutting off the Jews that among them that God has a remnant all Israel is not Israel Israel but those who is same as it is with the bride of Jesus Christ everybody who claimed to be bride is not bright everybody but God has a remnants arrested amen Ephesians 3 Ephesians we started reading uh from the 14th verse foreign of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by the spirit in the Inner Man I thank you foreign that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love with may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breath and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that he might be filled with all the fullness of God is I really want you to take note at this particular passage now unto him that is able to do seedingly exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in US [Music] amen remember he said according to the power that worketh in us not with us the power must be in us and in him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages world without in amen is let us pray our heavenly father Celeste we thank you for your grace and your mercy thank you for being so good to us Lord you have been better to us we've been to ourselves and as we journey toward that wonderful place called Heaven Lord we've come to trust you have to foreign we will happen special amen my service or sermon this morning is a very serious one which all of the word is seriously serious this has a burden on me [Music] um yesterday uh Fellowship helped me in a mighty way yeah but I'd like to entitle this message broken vowels no doubt each and every one of us have made a vow or a promise to the Lord and we failed to keep it but one thing about God he never makes and in the world there are two major Spirits one is conservative and to be honest with you they're both wrong God do does give us Liberty Liberty but our Liberty is found in the word of God on the side of the conservatives is all about law and we know that the law will kill you it's not given to us to free us the law always places Us in bondage that's what's happened to us here in the message we know that it's not law but we've done what the Liberals have done Grace a disgrace Hallelujah man don't be afraid it's real assistant why we understand by the grace of God that the grace of God is not to be used a cloak for sin Paul said shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound he said a vow is column Sodom to solemnly promise to do a specific thing specific when you make a vow you have made a promise and a promise you promise is something that you assure someone right whatever the promise is right you would do everything you would give everything that you have within you to make it happen please but being human it don't judge me man we break our promises sometimes deliberately and sometimes unattentionally but nevertheless because we are fairies to begin with songs we can't keep the promises that we make to others even to ourselves how many times we vowed foreign I believe that we waiting some prayers Hallelujah that we ought to be about our father's business this is why I'm preaching the message this morning because we need to be realigned Hallelujah yeah somehow we've allowed ourselves to get out of alignment um we must get back in alignment in order to keep the path straight it's a very part of the material see in particular material that God cut the pattern pattern out of out from do do our uh it is the same material but it's used for different works and I trust that if we are the remnant we are the brown chosen to you and you can flip that backwards there's a portion of the word and God has ordained for his brother cannot because hallelujah amen you see the message came to free us not to place Us in bondage Hallelujah the message came to free usage to place Us in boundaries by his promises amen maybe everything he's promised to me come into fruition but one thing for sure because I know his promises are yay all of his promises for the bride is that scripture now unto him that is able to do it exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think some power that worketh in US according to the power that worketh in US you don't have the power in you cannot work it will not work I was thinking on yesterday the beauty of pregnancy and God would take a journey and in that germ he can next with the egg of a woman needed for that being to grow your life the liver is there the liver is there the Heart Is Dead the arms are there the eyes everything everything the bride needs one is in the The Germ seed yeah on the inside the only thing that's necessary yeah it does that make sense but if there is no life if there is no seeds there really is no pregnancy you understand what I'm saying so you can't expect Christ manifested in you if he's not there I'm not speaking religion [Music] I'm speaking about a systems [Music] I'm talking about what Jesus said Nicodemus who have been employed who only knew his church he told him you must be born Hallelujah being born again how can I say it does it it's not feeling good being born again doesn't mean oh I can dance being born again when God comes down your nature is God Is Not patching people up I'm not putting a patch on you either when God comes down change is your nature it becomes a new creature in Christ all things are passed away Hallelujah you see I know what you're thinking amen some of y'all think I'm preaching this is too simple for you what I'm pretty sure I don't have what I'm preaching zip it but listen to what God is trying to tell you this is the word and now I'm preaching and you're going to judge the word as I preaching my point is my my desire is to see changes in you we'll talk about making a Rapture and what we're seeing is not wrapped to materials I asked my Lord the other day but how many years do I have in this church because you come here doesn't mean you're a Christianity is alive I love you the only reward I ever get is from him man look like are you interested in your mind and you just being here I know he's watching me I know he knows my heart y'all hear what I'm saying and I don't want to see nobody in this church lost that's what I'm trying to tell you people I didn't want them to tickle your ears we're talking about this is a serious time a very serious ly you know and I know you're being battled every day [Music] and if you don't fortify yourself this is something we should know this is not a time to disbelieve the words Hallelujah let me let me let me I'm gonna say I'm gonna read this scripture because I want you to hear what I'm saying what's your word is saying um let me tell you something Jesus Christ without the holy spree you might have an intellectual understanding companies [Music] you might understand that he was born of a virginity you know what I'm saying the incubator you know what I'm saying who Joseph is foreign that's the Bible the Bible said you'll never know who Jesus Christ Saint John 1 3 and 5. the Bible says all things were made by him was not anything was made and the life was light of the men of men the light shineth in darkness understand what is being preached this morning the Bible says his life was the light of me it is foreign [Music] foreign oh amen and the son of man has revealed himself in the same power that he was not down through the church ages degree through justification sanctification all these things were here but the son of man the son of man [Music] and the word is quicker than than powerful than to Edge swords what did he have to do he has to prove that word let me tell y'all something no filth Hallelujah you know the only way you can be holy is to have the Holy ghosts if you should die right now where would your future be because Hallelujah you love the Lord amen what did he have to do he has to prove that word what will he do notice if it when we see it happening in the beginning that he's Hebrews 13 and 8. yeah what was it Jesus Christ the same yes that was Christ in the wilderness with Moses no the Bible said that that was Christ when Paul was speaking here today in the New Testament the son of man in this last day why is he bringing these things to us this is the end times with the flood we uh the the delusion of unbelief the way you ought to believe coming here with Joe jobs you were coming here with peace the Bible said enter his gates with things I'm sorry there's no way I'm convinced yes [Music] y'all hear what I'm saying yeah we all tired some of us just getting off from work it's worth a cup of coffee if it's gonna make you you know respond to the to the worship you're coming in Lord I'm tired no no you got the quickening power inside let him Quicken you inside you love the Lord the Bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood I haven't even got to my thoughts yet the Lord lives and what's happening we are caught in the floods yes sir because you see what's good for you we've got it bad company like that this is the worst experience we worse stand up and say I am the light of the world is that right is that right because see sin wasn't known like the prophet said like you know when we got knowledge now then we had then and when the enemy comes in like a flag the spirit of God raises a standard against it a lot of time we don't understand what the standard is that means is that right and the Bible said if we resist the devil he will flee from it foreign spiritual flood of Darkness somehow you got to break loose Hallelujah you know that's what David said David said I'll be like a tree coming down to um [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] prove that he's great Hallelujah he wants to show you that he is God in that day [Music] [Music] we got to wake up here we are the Bride of Jesus Christ I don't believe God gave me Duds y'all know what a dirt is a bomb that won't go off I don't believe God gave me drugs guts that's how you interpret it it's a bomb that won't go off it is yeah the bomb like a boom bomb oh okay okay amen an explosion it won't explode because really really it's good I think about what we've got in this church you hear what I'm saying we could do for for this Iowa's this Des Moines Iowa the only way this could happen families before the church Hallelujah you know I shouldn't have to tell y'all to teach your children because the Bible said April parallel that's the word you understand where I'm going company now we know by God's grace with all of the knowledge all of science there's one thing that holds us fast and that is because he predestined destiny Hallelujah things around us you got to prove that you didn't come from Satan's either you got to prove it is Malachi 4 prove it is that right making sure that the proof was there and the only way that God can prove himself I'm sorry I don't want to be just a church I have not been called to be a systematic way of religion systematically [Music] in my heart I literally because I know the potential of this church but one thing for sure I can't do and brother says that's something that you should already know Hallelujah you love the Lord and when we keep when we say our vowels unto the Lord we must keep them this message is not just science I say just science God has proved himself by science we know by God's grace Miracles have happened but that's not the ultimate the ultimate of what God is looking for who can keep one of the things that he did I don't know whether there was a ceremony but one thing for sure when Adam said you're bone in my bones ceremony we must believe the word every day we can't lay it down and said [Music] yeah what do you mean brother see I said believe it that's something you should know that God must be the leaders Hallelujah that God never breaks a promise can I get an amen God never breaks a promise if you truly believe never break a promise God cannot failures all the time but he cannot failure how many of you have heard the story of blind according to the prophet Brian Baltimore has had a little lamb like the professors why he promised God if you save my wife we take the treasures of our hearts what I will do in replay instead of Hallelujah But Here Come the enemy yeah when Blind by the Mayors went to sacrifice his Lambs the priest says you can't sacrifice Daniel I'll get you another one um [Music] can offer that to the Lord I didn't tell him I told God healed about it when God blesses us the things that you we we so desires promises to him I'd be faithful at church isn't that amazing and we fail to see that God brings the tests who comes first in your life Ecclesiastes five I'm not going to keep you alone no we started late enthusiastes five I didn't come to make a shout I came to make you think Ecclesiastes five it is for he has no pleasure in food paid that which thou has vowed I completely better is it the thou should not vowel and not and not pay because it's got to be love affair that we have people man the Lord you know what we'll do we'll raise our eyes why within your heart you know you don't love him like you should one thing about love you can't break it in peace love is the one it it stands the test of time I don't know I can go down a list all the good things he's done for me that's not the reason I love him I honestly love him because he put his love in me had he not put his love in me am I making sense Ephesians 5 23 everybody knows Ephesians for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church he is the savior of the body [Music] therefore as the church is subject unto Christ alone let the wife be to their own husbands in everything now not everything is you know you gotta you have a balance to that because I didn't balance if your husband tell you to do something wrong and you do it you just see it when it comes to the word of God your husband tell you something wrong foreign absolutely absolutely more I'm sorry Brothers I just bust your system up there if he tells you to do something that's evil see if the you tell him to do it himself the family man and if you don't like it tell your pastor is hello he has no right husbands they Marie love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it Hallelujah Brothers you know that's a powerful scripture and husbands this is why you why are you praying yeah give me that love for my wife amen oh y'all love that oh come on you get married for better for worse foreign you forgot your promises the devil that comes to break up the institution of marriage that's why he hate the church because he understands that the church is the Bride of Jesus Christ thank God Roger that's when Grace comes in oh Brothers ancestors hello do we give each other the kind of Grace we supposed to give each other like asking some supposedly according husband love your wives even as Christ also love the church himself foreign including mine I'm getting better amen y'all heard her say Amen right so my thing is we've got to work on it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word hallelujah you know you know what I'm saying in other words correct your wife according to the word it washes her love worry it brings us to a place amen she's Sanctified and cleansed and husbands Marie she has a right to tell you when you're wrong they made a correct Bill brother Bill yes especially when he told that lie right so why she she brought to know so much she had to tell him correct what are you doing you're not judging one another but you're helping one another your enemy is not your wife and when you got children by your actions you're in the house throw in the face all I gotta do is watch your kids I know you're fighting when your children fighting each other and fighting everybody else we don't we don't fight I don't believe that one this is I've seen it people in the message throwing faces right come on come on hey that's wrong absolutely wrong absolutely my mind and God is not pleased with that nonsense I don't know why people think they can whoop their wives into shape some brothers have found out that he don't work that way right is it going to see yourself yeah yeah but that's wrong let me see four hey I got I got a couple of pictures now I know what I'm talking about some things I keep yeah just for reference I'll never show them to nobody else but I don't want nobody said well I ain't never did that because so let's move on so we we realize what he's doing what we're doing we're working with one another to bring each other Amen to that Holy place is that right even when we see ourselves looking at things that we shouldn't look at remember we shouldn't let the wife let the husband know that it's okay um you know I you know I'm not crazy and I'm gonna tell you like this until y'all stop looking at them things and on your amen and you know you're never enough you'll never ever Holiness amen ities most men would never cheat on their wives and vice versa y'all got quiet on here though y'all know some stuff keep it to yourself and pray that God will deliver you Hallelujah this is okay okay sir II Peter three 13 14. I know I've got some of y'all in the hot seat but I don't care I'm preaching what I know God told me to preaching you see I've been happening that God was sanctify this church for those who don't want to repent ance that's what I want to see it's exclusive while I'm Not About Numbers if I'd have been about numbers I wouldn't have left my big church down here hallelujah Noah no way every week I don't care about numbers taken care of you're so um that I want to see God illuminate illuminate just bring you to a fire what's up that no man can put out you see where we failed I'm sorry we let the teachers make up to be decided about God Church um secretos I'ma finish this message nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new Heaven and a new Earth wearing dwelleth righteousness seeing that you look for such things that you may be found of him in peace amen not only that I must grow in the to the perfect statue of Christ are those my words did I just preach my preach my words I said how many of y'all still read your Bible what are we doing when we fail to uh adhere the blood of Jesus Christ you hear what I'm saying I'll say it again when we fail to take heed upon the word of God knowing what we know we are trying the blood of Jesus Christ as if [Music] Valor may God help us you love the Lord I'm coming to some of y'all I'm coming right now just where I'm needing I read there in just a moment but it tells us ually Simon's house and she took all of her money now she is that she was gained by and she is see God saw her heart do you have views he saw her sacrifice do you have used on sacrifice he saw what was really only the inside of her life and when she uh the oil was taken to feet did you know that there was a woman let me say it like this this morning just to see the problem with us is that we allow the critics but Mary could care less [Music] critics Hallelujah in her worship and she knew that Jesus Christ was the only one that could give her that is here but then there was another critic yeah we are not critical and his name was Judas and you know what you've been studying I never saw it like this [Music] was a thief I didn't see that somehow speaking to me there was more than one thief on the cross yeah Hallelujah Jesus Judas was a thief and when he complained about using such a great oil the faith of Jesus he had his own interests he didn't care about uh uh uh he was looking at the money what kind of money would bring in Hallelujah you know even Jesus Is Awesome never did Jesus called Judas a thief y'all hear what I'm saying and see what we think sometimes is that when we steal from God yes he does amen Judas don't worship you know Judas criticized during the worship amen you know uh you know criticizing the preacher he didn't preach it justice come on somebody because the same God that occupied William Brown Hallelujah and how he preached in his lips he preaches through mines my office is not that kind of a prophet but I'm still a prophet comes if you had known the word God said the New Testament that is the word I'm not trying to make a name I'm trying to exalt this Jesus Christ Hallelujah he wiped his feet with her hair hey she came into the house don't change the atmosphere inside person one person not a group of people personally change the atmosphere yes sir I might look like I'm crazy Dean said one of his disciples we should betray him why was not this all [Music] against the day of my burial for the poor always with you but me me ye have not always saying brother brothers God God one thing people in around this message you know I don't care if you believe it ain't nothing but a modern day prostitution right now amen it wasn't so in the beginning foreign [Music] um glory to God Elijah yeah yeah yeah yeah cause some of these preachers Hallelujah anyhow Hallelujah am I good too God didn't bring two women out of Adam be bad that's a strong spirit before that polygamy and God say I hate it did you hear him divorce women in bondages like that which I want them to do another one you need the holy ghosts um foreign [Music] it's real serious y'all think I'll tell you they said to Elijah he said to them Israel's got a prophet over there and he knows exactly Israel his own Prophet decisions now I don't claim to be that kind of a propheters Malachi 2. I'm almost done I'm almost done so when I'm done y'all can go into that conference treat back there and talk it all over then now y'all going to find somewhere else to go now because I don't call your tree out but y'all know what I'm saying yet you say wherefore because the Lord have seen witness between thee and the wife of thy youth thou has dealt treacherously it is she thy companion of thy Covenant people can marry folks they didn't treat them like dirt they jumped this got nothing to do with culture this is the word of God you made a covenant and you're breaking your vows I love it to death do your part oh my bad Monday um y'all don't like me preaching this is [Music] because you're wrong and did not he make one he didn't make two new news he made one that he might seek a Godly see why it's so important wives get along when you have children in your child making it foreign
