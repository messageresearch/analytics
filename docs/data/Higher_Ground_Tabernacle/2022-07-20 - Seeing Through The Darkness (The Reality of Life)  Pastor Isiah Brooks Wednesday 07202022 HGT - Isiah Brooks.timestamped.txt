[43:15] preeminence
[43:18] so we're just gonna
[43:20] go into the word of god are you glad
[43:22] tonight
[43:26] brother adam said he saw the bride
[43:28] marching to the tune of the word
[43:30] onward christian soldier marching as to
[43:33] war
[43:37] i think that key of c was the right one
[43:40] i changed it so i paid the price
[43:43] anything god is good to us anyway i'm
[43:46] glad we can do that
[43:48] and not worry about whatever anybody
[43:50] says right
[43:51] god is so good to us and
[43:54] i i appreciate him
[43:57] more than
[43:58] any
[43:59] anybody could ever know
[44:01] we had wonderful services there in iowa
[44:04] city
[44:05] the anointing was amazing
[44:08] and even then and even as it is now i
[44:10] feel so unworthy to be
[44:13] standing behind this podium preaching
[44:15] the word of god
[44:18] i'm a man that has to
[44:20] acknowledge my sins every day
[44:23] confess before god and
[44:25] make things right
[44:27] and just to know that god will still use
[44:29] me amazes me
[44:31] because his holiness is something that
[44:33] we can't comprehend
[44:35] we
[44:36] have an idea of things but
[44:38] we won't know what it really is like
[44:40] until we get there
[44:42] but i'm grateful that god
[44:45] made a statement i always use it he says
[44:47] i'll never leave you
[44:49] nor will i ever forsake you
[44:51] that means all the world to me
[44:55] i don't have to worry about being
[44:56] rejected
[44:58] um you know we we came up
[45:01] through christian i'm thinking that we
[45:04] could be lost at even even given to any
[45:06] given time
[45:08] but if you're in christ
[45:10] there is no way that you can be lost
[45:13] if you were in his mind before the
[45:15] foundation of the world to be bride
[45:17] there is nothing in time that can change
[45:20] that
[45:21] and i'm grateful let us turn by the
[45:23] grace of god to james the first chapter
[45:26] of james please
[45:30] hallelujah from james we'll we'll go to
[45:32] the
[45:33] gospel according to john john 6
[45:36] james
[45:39] james peter
[45:40] the first chapter
[45:43] beginning at the third verse
[45:47] knowing this that the trying of your
[45:49] faith
[45:50] worketh
[45:51] patience
[45:53] but let patience have her perfect work
[45:56] that ye may be perfect and entire
[45:59] wanting nothing
[46:02] if any of you like wisdom let him ask of
[46:05] god
[46:06] that give it to all men liberally and
[46:09] upbraideth not
[46:10] and it shall be given him
[46:13] but let a man ask in faith
[46:15] not wavering
[46:17] for he that wavereth is like a wave of
[46:19] the seed driven
[46:21] with the wind and tossed
[46:24] for let not
[46:25] that man think
[46:27] that he shall receive anything
[46:29] of the lord
[46:31] a double-minded man
[46:33] is unstable in all his ways
[46:40] saint john 6th chapter
[46:43] we'll begin reading at the
[46:45] 37th verse
[46:48] of that particular chapter saint john 6
[46:52] 37.
[46:59] and it reads
[47:01] all that the father giveth me shall come
[47:04] to me
[47:06] and him
[47:08] that cometh to me i will in no wise cast
[47:12] out
[47:13] i came down from heaven
[47:16] not to do my own will
[47:19] but the will of him that sent me
[47:22] and this is the father's will
[47:25] which
[47:26] have sent me
[47:28] that
[47:29] of all which ye have given me i should
[47:32] lose nothing
[47:34] but should raise it up again
[47:37] at the last day
[47:39] and this is the will of him that sent me
[47:42] that everyone which seeth the son
[47:46] and believeth on him
[47:48] may have everlasting life
[47:51] and i will raise him up
[47:53] at the last day
[47:55] let us pray
[47:58] our gracious father we thank you
[48:01] we appreciate you so much
[48:04] lord
[48:05] being in this
[48:07] faulty house this frayer body
[48:10] body made of clay
[48:12] fallen as it is
[48:15] you've given us the grace lord to live
[48:19] according to your word and
[48:21] father we come short sometimes we
[48:24] falter but
[48:25] we realize that we have a big brother
[48:28] we have a father we we know lord jesus
[48:31] that because of
[48:32] his acceptance
[48:34] we are accepted in him
[48:36] and lord we thank you for our lord jesus
[48:38] christ
[48:40] and all that he's done for us and will
[48:42] do
[48:43] from now throughout eternity
[48:45] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[48:51] you may be seated
[48:56] i'll try not to be long and i hate
[48:57] saying that because every time i do that
[48:59] i end up being
[49:00] long
[49:02] but you know i was thinking today even
[49:04] today how
[49:06] what what god would have me to speak
[49:08] tonight because i had some things that i
[49:10] could have continued but i felt like i
[49:13] needed to kind of like put a little
[49:15] pause or something
[49:16] in that area to bring you into a place
[49:19] where you can have confidence in the
[49:20] lord
[49:22] sometimes we waver in our thoughts
[49:24] because we lack faith in him
[49:26] and one thing i know about the lord
[49:28] jesus christ when the fullness of god
[49:30] comes in you understand the lord can
[49:33] never doubt his own word
[49:35] so the problem is never the word is
[49:37] never god himself it's us
[49:39] and we need to die and rot to our own
[49:41] thoughts and ideas the bible said we
[49:43] ought to cast down every evil
[49:45] imagination that exalt itself against
[49:47] the word of god
[49:49] that means that if god has said and has
[49:51] told you something amen that word must
[49:53] have preeminence over your thoughts
[49:56] and
[49:57] your desires
[49:59] but i
[50:00] thought about
[50:01] how dark it is we were some of us were
[50:04] talking there at the house yesterday
[50:06] evening and
[50:07] and it inspired me somewhat to know that
[50:11] we're living in such a dark age
[50:13] and to me it makes god even greater
[50:16] i mean you know
[50:18] to know that this is the as the prophet
[50:20] god said this is the most evilest age
[50:22] we've ever lived in and you and i have
[50:25] not even seen the climax of it uh and we
[50:28] know that evil seducers are whack work
[50:30] worse is worse they're getting worse all
[50:33] the time and even it's amazes me because
[50:36] the world is hoping
[50:38] and looking for messiah and the messiah
[50:40] that they were looking for has come and
[50:42] gone
[50:43] and uh in a sense in which they would be
[50:46] able to see him we find out that the
[50:48] church age locked him out of their age
[50:50] they knocked locked him out and put him
[50:52] on the outside and now they're crying
[50:55] for messiah and they're going to get one
[50:57] but it won't be jesus
[50:59] so we're living in a time that the
[51:01] darkest time that's ever been but we
[51:03] know that it's the darkest before dawn
[51:06] amen and we realize by god's grace that
[51:09] god has brought us such a message that
[51:11] gives us light
[51:13] remember brother branham talked about it
[51:15] after the seals and stains were open he
[51:17] talked about how the bride of jesus
[51:19] christ as far as knowledge we were far
[51:21] ahead of history
[51:23] and and time had to catch up with the
[51:25] word
[51:26] that's why when the prophet of god spoke
[51:28] so many things ah afterwards the seals
[51:31] were open we thought we understood when
[51:33] we did not
[51:35] because time and history events had to
[51:37] take place in order for the word of god
[51:40] to be made manifest so we can see it you
[51:42] know uh prophecy being made clear you
[51:45] know through modern events
[51:47] so we we understand by god's grace how
[51:50] god began to see uh we be we're
[51:52] beginning to see things in the scripture
[51:54] that we've never seen before
[51:56] even among ourselves we have seen you
[51:59] know the fall of men and men worship and
[52:02] all of these things that we start with
[52:05] over in babylon has crossed over you
[52:07] know into our realm
[52:10] and the thing that's so
[52:13] it
[52:15] if god doesn't show you the two spirits
[52:18] that works within the framework of the
[52:21] church you will never see
[52:23] what's going on
[52:25] because it they're they're like twins
[52:27] they're so close together and you know
[52:29] even brother brandon was talking i heard
[52:31] him today talking about twins that you
[52:33] know even their thumb prints are
[52:35] different they're not exactly alike even
[52:37] though they call them identical
[52:40] um
[52:40] you know when it comes down to to to
[52:43] really defining one from the other they
[52:45] have signatures
[52:48] that one or the other doesn't have
[52:51] now i say all of this by the grace of
[52:53] god is that because this is a time of
[52:55] trying and testing
[52:57] it is what we call the time and the age
[53:00] or the or the time period of adoption
[53:03] uh you know because we realize we come
[53:05] through you know the church ages and we
[53:08] come through the tutorials and you know
[53:10] we come through all of this teaching and
[53:12] all of these things but now amen that
[53:15] that we have come to a time where god is
[53:17] testing us to see whether we're worthy
[53:21] of sonship
[53:22] and you and i understand oh i got the
[53:24] holy ghost but the holy ghost is there
[53:26] to teach you the holy ghost is there a
[53:29] men to guide you and to lead you into
[53:31] all truth
[53:33] but it is our duty to be subject to the
[53:36] holy spirit
[53:37] amen this is where the trying comes in
[53:40] now we must always understand that
[53:43] everything we go through everything we
[53:45] go through god has already seen it
[53:48] because he's the alpha and the omega
[53:50] there is nothing in time or out of time
[53:54] that could ever catch god by surprise
[53:56] amen so we understand that we when we
[53:59] come through these tests and oftentimes
[54:02] we say test because most of the time
[54:04] they're like tribulations to us i mean
[54:07] these tests can be very extreme and and
[54:09] very hard
[54:11] but understand that every time god put
[54:13] us in a test is for his glory
[54:18] let me say it let me say it again
[54:21] the end result of every test
[54:24] is that god will be glorified
[54:27] amen
[54:28] right
[54:29] and he comes in the middle or in the
[54:33] time
[54:34] when you least expect him
[54:36] you can't put a time on him
[54:38] every time i think about shadrach
[54:40] meshach and abednego and how god allowed
[54:43] them to walk into the furnace
[54:46] a fire
[54:48] and never showed up until they got in
[54:51] there
[54:54] it amazes me because a lot of time we
[54:57] you know envision you know we're seeing
[54:59] these things with our own eyes and
[55:01] and i don't know how they felt
[55:03] i don't know
[55:04] you know uh but one thing i do know is
[55:07] that they faith hell
[55:09] and and they said you know it doesn't
[55:11] matter what you do to me
[55:14] throw me into the fire
[55:16] but i have a constitution
[55:18] right i will never bow
[55:22] you can kill me but i see the reality of
[55:26] it is that
[55:27] god was not
[55:29] words on a scroll
[55:32] god was life and it was reality so much
[55:36] to those those i call them the bible
[55:38] said boy so but in reality they were
[55:40] real men in character and they held fast
[55:45] the prophet god said it like this he
[55:47] said they even had a prayer meeting
[55:50] and god never answered or showed up
[55:54] it was a time of silence
[55:57] it was a time where god didn't pat him
[55:59] on the back and says hey boys i'm with
[56:00] you it wasn't like when he said to
[56:03] polycop don't fear polycarp
[56:06] no he was quiet
[56:08] how do you stand
[56:11] when god is quiet
[56:13] and you haven't heard from him but one
[56:16] thing for certain the bible tells us
[56:20] that god hears our prayer
[56:22] before we even speak them
[56:26] he knows the very intent of your heart
[56:30] but he try you
[56:32] to see what you're going to do
[56:35] when you can see god as being god
[56:40] you're all right
[56:42] you're going to be okay
[56:44] because you know and understand that
[56:46] nothing can be greater than your god
[56:49] it's been time tested
[56:52] all of the old testament stories our
[56:54] historical stories that we read in there
[56:57] these things are not fictional but
[56:59] they're truth amen
[57:01] amen truth
[57:03] daniel and the lion's den was not some
[57:06] fable
[57:07] like catholic church and other churches
[57:10] teach them
[57:11] they were real men
[57:13] it was a reality to them
[57:15] amen god was a reality
[57:19] hallelujah and they didn't treat god
[57:21] like he was a thing
[57:23] they knew he was god
[57:26] hallelujah
[57:28] you think about it and i don't know my
[57:30] wife and i we've seen real lions
[57:33] they were in a cage
[57:35] but let me tell you something lions are
[57:36] so fierce even when they're in the cage
[57:38] you scared of them
[57:41] yeah they're powerful be uh powerful
[57:44] creatures
[57:45] and you know you think about here these
[57:48] these uh daniel is facing lions
[57:52] and i don't i mean hungry lions
[57:56] and no doubt those lions were
[57:58] disappointed that night
[58:01] because for certain they thought it was
[58:04] meal time but you see it wasn't that
[58:06] time or that kind of time in the mind of
[58:10] god
[58:11] and i want to say it like this you
[58:13] cannot leave this earth until god is
[58:17] through with you
[58:19] that you have fulfilled better
[58:21] understand what i'm saying because when
[58:23] the squeeze come on and when they begin
[58:25] to persecute the church
[58:28] don't be afraid of death
[58:32] because that's how the devil
[58:35] breaks you down you get a little sick
[58:37] you're gonna die you get cancer you're
[58:39] gonna die who says you're gonna die
[58:44] because satan afflicts you with
[58:45] something doesn't mean you're going to
[58:48] die if you have the faith to believe
[58:52] you can say to this mountain mountain be
[58:56] thy move and it has to be moved
[58:59] god testes you
[59:01] sometimes we need things we want things
[59:03] and we feel almost like an urgency oh
[59:05] lord how long how long will it take you
[59:08] how long and just in a moment's time
[59:11] god swings the door open
[59:14] and usually when you have to wait on a
[59:15] blessing the blessing is bigger than
[59:17] what you asked for
[59:21] hallelujah
[59:22] listen you
[59:24] one of the things that we must learn
[59:26] even in the statue of a perfect man we
[59:28] must learn patience
[59:30] and patience is not
[59:33] something that just happens
[59:35] it is something is like building muscles
[59:37] you have to build muscles of faith
[59:40] because it's a time when you have to sit
[59:42] still
[59:44] sit quiet it says wait on god and wait
[59:49] for god
[59:51] and the devil during those times are
[59:53] always there to torment you to make you
[59:56] feel like what you have faith in is a
[59:58] lie but the truth of the matter is he's
[1:00:00] a liar
[1:00:02] he can't stop the will of god
[1:00:06] and when you know that you're in the
[1:00:08] will of god
[1:00:09] you can have faith
[1:00:11] and believe god
[1:00:13] now you can't have faith when you say oh
[1:00:15] he's going to do it today and tomorrow
[1:00:17] i'm not sure he's going to do it
[1:00:19] that's
[1:00:20] james said it so don't get mad at me he
[1:00:23] said a double-minded man is unstable in
[1:00:25] all of his ways
[1:00:26] oh today it's okay and tomorrow is not
[1:00:28] see no no no you can't get nothing you
[1:00:30] have to hold fast
[1:00:32] now i'm coming to something real now see
[1:00:34] because i what my my whole thought was
[1:00:36] seeing through the darkness
[1:00:42] he's a lamp
[1:00:46] he's a light to my pathways and i lamp
[1:00:49] to my feet he he's he's leading me
[1:00:52] through all of this darkness
[1:00:55] how you gonna make
[1:00:57] how in the world you're gonna make this
[1:00:59] journey without the word
[1:01:03] and the darkness
[1:01:05] is the worst we've ever seen it on the
[1:01:07] face of the earth but through this
[1:01:11] darkness
[1:01:12] we understand there's coming a darn
[1:01:15] a daybreak
[1:01:17] the light shines
[1:01:19] where brother books not just in the
[1:01:21] heavens
[1:01:22] but the light shines in you
[1:01:25] is that right
[1:01:27] i was just listening to what brother
[1:01:28] brandon was talking the other day he
[1:01:30] said he thought he was a guide
[1:01:33] remember on his uh honeymoon
[1:01:35] the vacation he took
[1:01:37] took his wife up there thought he'd go
[1:01:39] hunting you know
[1:01:41] and he got lost
[1:01:43] he said he thought he was such a guide
[1:01:45] but that's not that's not laying on the
[1:01:48] pages of the book on the tape for you to
[1:01:50] think to be amused by
[1:01:53] we all
[1:01:54] think and like to be in control
[1:01:57] we take our experiences sometimes and we
[1:02:00] feel like we're pros at what we're doing
[1:02:03] in reality we're still lambs
[1:02:07] and whenever we get to that place you
[1:02:09] think you know it and you can do it and
[1:02:12] then god will break you down in such a
[1:02:14] way you have to say lord jesus i'm lost
[1:02:17] i need a guide
[1:02:24] you know that's one thing i loved about
[1:02:26] brother branham he was just clothed with
[1:02:28] humility
[1:02:31] he didn't mind telling it
[1:02:33] and you and i must understand it's okay
[1:02:35] to tell it
[1:02:37] we're supposed to tell it
[1:02:39] it gives other people's faith
[1:02:41] it gives them strength to realize
[1:02:43] they're not the only one that's going
[1:02:45] through something
[1:02:47] we supposed to comfort one another
[1:02:49] in this darkest hour you say what do you
[1:02:52] mean prior to them leaving out of egypt
[1:02:55] they knew the blood had been applied
[1:02:58] but by the the drama that was
[1:03:00] illustrated to us there were still those
[1:03:03] who were saying father are you sure
[1:03:07] hallelujah
[1:03:08] and we had a messenger that came with
[1:03:11] the word to dissolve all doubts
[1:03:14] to make us sure
[1:03:16] right that's what the bible said make
[1:03:18] your calling and election sure
[1:03:21] we are sure
[1:03:23] why because we understand that the call
[1:03:26] we have heard
[1:03:27] was the voice and is the voice of god
[1:03:30] no man could bring you to this message
[1:03:33] no man can make you see it no man can
[1:03:36] give you understanding it is a holy
[1:03:38] ghost it is christ himself who is
[1:03:41] leading us through this dark dark hour
[1:03:45] amen
[1:03:46] huh
[1:03:48] is that right see this
[1:03:50] we come to
[1:03:52] at this point in our lives to understand
[1:03:54] the reality of this life
[1:03:59] the reality of this life
[1:04:01] did not come to make you lost
[1:04:05] you understand what i'm trying to say
[1:04:07] in other words no matter what you go
[1:04:10] through
[1:04:10] if you've been in the mind of god
[1:04:13] if you're a true seed of god
[1:04:15] there is no way this life
[1:04:18] can cause you to be lost
[1:04:21] amen i'ma say that again
[1:04:23] see if you have you was with god
[1:04:27] and you don't even know how come you
[1:04:29] know that you know that you know
[1:04:31] but you know in spite of all your faults
[1:04:33] and all of your shortcomings you know
[1:04:35] you were there something on the inside
[1:04:38] radiates that through you
[1:04:41] that's what causes us to repent
[1:04:43] that's what causes us to feel godly
[1:04:45] sorrow when we feel when we do wrong
[1:04:48] because we don't want to displease him
[1:04:52] something in us testifies of a holy life
[1:04:55] and a holy place a place of
[1:04:57] righteousness
[1:04:59] hallelujah didn't he say i'd not lose
[1:05:02] one that's exactly what he meant
[1:05:07] in the reality of this life satan uses
[1:05:10] the tactic of fear
[1:05:12] to discourage us
[1:05:14] and to make us believe that we can be
[1:05:16] lost
[1:05:18] jesus says i've gotten you written
[1:05:21] in the palm of my hand
[1:05:23] listen people we would not even need
[1:05:25] calvary
[1:05:27] if we could do it ourselves
[1:05:29] it was always grace
[1:05:32] even under the law it was grace
[1:05:35] they could never do the law
[1:05:38] it was always grace and now is grace
[1:05:42] grace
[1:05:44] because god understood
[1:05:47] the trials and tests we would go through
[1:05:51] i think that was brother ben that
[1:05:52] preached he's our father
[1:05:57] he's our father
[1:05:59] and father loves us
[1:06:01] as his
[1:06:02] children guess he would chasten us he
[1:06:05] will chastise us when we do wrong
[1:06:08] but i'm trying to get you to a place
[1:06:10] where if we could see
[1:06:11] nothing can cause us to be lost
[1:06:17] maybe we'll be able to move forward
[1:06:20] into our father's business
[1:06:23] because that's the only way you can be
[1:06:24] adopted
[1:06:26] you must go into the father's business
[1:06:28] and prove yourself
[1:06:32] it must be proven
[1:06:34] he's not going to give you know his
[1:06:36] business
[1:06:38] to some kid that is not mature enough to
[1:06:40] know how to handle it
[1:06:43] but he gives his business to a son that
[1:06:47] have proven his maturity
[1:06:50] you understand what i'm saying
[1:06:53] you know we talk about healings and
[1:06:54] deliverances and discernments and all of
[1:06:56] these gifts that that that should be
[1:06:58] flowing through the body but brother
[1:07:00] brown tells us in this last days there's
[1:07:02] going to be a few people that get it
[1:07:03] because
[1:07:04] there is not going to be that many that
[1:07:05] that would grow up to that maturity
[1:07:08] know how to handle it
[1:07:10] amen right
[1:07:12] we've seen it pentecost didn't know how
[1:07:14] to handle it they were real gifts
[1:07:17] every good and perfect gift come from
[1:07:19] god
[1:07:20] but what did they do they didn't glorify
[1:07:23] god
[1:07:24] they glorified themselves all of a
[1:07:26] sudden god's ministry became their
[1:07:29] ministry
[1:07:30] my ministry what ministry
[1:07:33] this is all about one kingdom
[1:07:36] and that is the kingdom of god that's it
[1:07:41] i like that for all the father giveth me
[1:07:43] shall come to me
[1:07:45] there's
[1:07:46] he didn't say might come
[1:07:48] he said come to me
[1:07:50] it doesn't matter if there's a
[1:07:51] prostitute whoremonger drug addict
[1:07:54] whatever you know what i mean i don't
[1:07:56] care if it's a man wearing a dress or a
[1:07:58] woman wearing pants
[1:08:02] god is able to clean and sanctify
[1:08:08] and you and i must realize that we must
[1:08:11] always open our minds to the fact that
[1:08:13] god's seed can be anywhere
[1:08:17] search the highways and the byways and
[1:08:20] the ditches and the scummy areas that's
[1:08:22] where they're laid in the last day
[1:08:24] that's where they were
[1:08:26] they weren't in the churches
[1:08:28] because the churches had rejected them
[1:08:30] it was the people on the corners it was
[1:08:32] the beggars the people that the society
[1:08:35] turned down that's where true seed is
[1:08:38] because one thing for certain if you can
[1:08:40] show those people that god is god
[1:08:43] oh my we'll have a revival
[1:08:48] by one man and by one sister
[1:08:53] i'm gonna read john and i'm not gonna be
[1:08:55] long john 9 1-38 i'm trying to get us to
[1:08:58] see
[1:09:00] because while we worried
[1:09:01] [Laughter]
[1:09:04] you know i you know i i i did i wanted
[1:09:07] to be about six three or something
[1:09:09] and and you know i thought i was gonna
[1:09:11] make it because i grew really tall
[1:09:13] you know at the first and all of a
[1:09:15] sudden it came to a halt
[1:09:20] all my other brothers taller than i am
[1:09:22] you know and i thought maybe i'll get
[1:09:23] there or a little above and no
[1:09:26] and it would not have mattered
[1:09:28] how much i would have gotten on my knees
[1:09:32] and prayed lord please
[1:09:34] you know because god knew my statue
[1:09:37] he understood the limit everywhere every
[1:09:39] little part of me could not not go
[1:09:41] beyond his boundaries on what he saw me
[1:09:43] as being
[1:09:47] right one of my closest friends you know
[1:09:49] he's a short fella and he says man when
[1:09:51] i get to heaven i'm gonna be this this
[1:09:52] this and i'll be tall i'm like oh no
[1:09:56] that's not the way it's gonna be brother
[1:09:58] god didn't make no mistake with your
[1:09:59] height
[1:10:02] if you short here you'll be short there
[1:10:05] but one thing that brother branham did
[1:10:07] say he said everything that sin put in
[1:10:09] you god will take it out
[1:10:14] hallelujah
[1:10:16] glory to god
[1:10:18] john 9 1 through 38 and i i won't i have
[1:10:21] to read this down because it's it's it's
[1:10:23] long but but it's wonderful we know the
[1:10:26] story
[1:10:27] but i want you to see how blind
[1:10:30] people becomes by way of traditions
[1:10:35] and we've been guilty
[1:10:38] brother branham tells us about how god
[1:10:40] hates starchy services
[1:10:44] he said it more than once
[1:10:47] he even spoke and said things about the
[1:10:48] canadians you know in in this their
[1:10:50] statute but that was not a compliment
[1:10:54] because he said everybody that received
[1:10:56] the holy ghost acts the same way
[1:11:00] that's what he says
[1:11:03] and so you and i we understand we
[1:11:04] allowed as i said not all teachers but
[1:11:07] there were those who literally took the
[1:11:08] holy spirit away from us
[1:11:10] and we allowed it
[1:11:13] the actions of it
[1:11:16] you know they didn't mind if you fell
[1:11:18] into the tradition of looking holy like
[1:11:20] the pharisees
[1:11:22] but they couldn't care less about the
[1:11:24] inside of the cup
[1:11:26] and that's what that's what jesus said
[1:11:28] he said listen outwardly you look like
[1:11:30] white as sepulchre he said but inside
[1:11:32] your dead men bones
[1:11:34] where is the life
[1:11:36] where is this holy ghost we're talking
[1:11:38] about and you and i being the bride most
[1:11:40] should be the most powerfulest church on
[1:11:42] the face of the earth
[1:11:44] it shouldn't be something like oh what
[1:11:47] are those people oh what those people
[1:11:49] believe no no no no it should be such a
[1:11:52] powerful life
[1:11:54] that people should see it is that right
[1:11:57] he said don't take your light and
[1:11:59] put it on the bushel he said now put it
[1:12:02] up on a pinnacle where some people can
[1:12:05] see it
[1:12:07] it's supposed to be seen this message is
[1:12:10] the life of the message is supposed to
[1:12:12] be seen
[1:12:18] hallelujah i'm pushing i'm pressing i
[1:12:22] fall i come short just like everybody
[1:12:24] else but i get up
[1:12:27] yes and as jesus passed by he saw a man
[1:12:31] which was blind from his birth
[1:12:35] and his disciples asked him saying
[1:12:37] master who did sin
[1:12:40] this man
[1:12:41] or his parents
[1:12:42] that he was born blind
[1:12:44] and jesus answered neither hath this man
[1:12:47] sin nor his parents but that the works
[1:12:51] of god should be made manifest in him so
[1:12:54] let me say it like this it doesn't
[1:12:56] matter
[1:12:57] what condition you were born into
[1:13:00] you're in the message you're in the word
[1:13:02] and you have been born for a purpose and
[1:13:05] that purpose amen is that god will be
[1:13:07] manifested in you
[1:13:10] that's what it's all about
[1:13:12] i keep crying out lord help us be about
[1:13:15] our father's business and we need to
[1:13:18] find what his business is you know what
[1:13:21] this business is go ye therefore right
[1:13:25] teach all nations
[1:13:27] is that right that's what he said we are
[1:13:30] soul winners
[1:13:32] but how we're going to win souls if we
[1:13:34] don't even believe that our souls
[1:13:37] have been won
[1:13:41] we're fighting as i said the devil has a
[1:13:43] fighting each other of fighting
[1:13:45] ourselves
[1:13:46] we're fighting oh lord am i saved and my
[1:13:48] bride that's nonsense he said my sheep
[1:13:52] heareth my voice and a stranger they
[1:13:54] will not follow have you heard his voice
[1:13:59] hallelujah there have been many people
[1:14:01] in this world looked at william branham
[1:14:03] saw him but never heard the voice that
[1:14:06] came out of him but you and i have heard
[1:14:09] the voice and we know that it is not the
[1:14:11] voice of a man but it's the voice of god
[1:14:14] through a man
[1:14:17] and we don't care
[1:14:19] what people think about us
[1:14:22] hallelujah those who follow jesus they
[1:14:25] didn't care
[1:14:27] what other people thought about them
[1:14:28] they knew they had met the messiah
[1:14:31] and if the people knew the scripture the
[1:14:33] bible said in the days of the son of man
[1:14:37] what was that day
[1:14:39] this day
[1:14:40] as it was in the days of sodom as it was
[1:14:42] in the days of noah god would reveal the
[1:14:44] son of man and the son of man is another
[1:14:47] term for profit
[1:14:49] that god would visit this generation in
[1:14:52] the form of a prophet
[1:14:54] and he did it and the world missed it
[1:15:00] and a lot of people in the mess is still
[1:15:02] missing it
[1:15:06] like i said if he didn't come how did he
[1:15:09] take a picture
[1:15:14] who was that
[1:15:16] brother branham identified that cloud
[1:15:19] just like john the baptist identified
[1:15:21] jesus
[1:15:23] he said that's my lord
[1:15:27] he had to that's why he kept saying
[1:15:30] listen even you listen to the tapes from
[1:15:31] 63 afterwards when the sears were open
[1:15:34] he kept trying to tell the people i'm
[1:15:36] going
[1:15:37] i'm leaving it won't be long
[1:15:39] and he kept saying well if i'll i'm not
[1:15:41] the one maybe someone would come after
[1:15:43] me
[1:15:44] and you know we got people trying to
[1:15:45] take that out
[1:15:46] and take that in such a way and the
[1:15:48] revelation is
[1:15:51] did not elisha
[1:15:53] come after elijah
[1:15:55] and did not elisha finish up elijah's
[1:15:58] work
[1:16:00] hello
[1:16:01] and elijah is not one man
[1:16:04] it's the body of jesus christ
[1:16:07] with the double anointing on her
[1:16:11] listen and that's the thing it is
[1:16:13] support we're supposed to do and we
[1:16:15] don't know on record how many miracles
[1:16:18] elijah did but we're supposed to do
[1:16:21] twice the amount
[1:16:24] oh where is it then
[1:16:26] can we stand in the pulpit and say this
[1:16:29] is that
[1:16:32] people to say this is that
[1:16:37] and until we get there
[1:16:39] we need to keep pressing
[1:16:41] until this become that
[1:16:43] everything william branham preached god
[1:16:46] preached through him amen it's supposed
[1:16:48] to manifest itself through the people of
[1:16:51] god
[1:16:52] that's the truth
[1:16:54] it never was supposed to be a social
[1:16:56] society
[1:16:58] and yet we've made it
[1:17:00] thus i must work the works of him oh
[1:17:03] lord have mercy
[1:17:06] oh look let me let me back up to the
[1:17:07] third verse he said jesus answered
[1:17:09] neither have this man sin nor his
[1:17:11] parents but that the works of god shall
[1:17:13] be made manifested in him
[1:17:16] i must work the works of him that sent
[1:17:20] me while it is day the night cometh when
[1:17:24] no man can work
[1:17:27] and where are we where are we
[1:17:31] and let me tell you something we we if
[1:17:33] we be in dalatory yes god help us help
[1:17:36] us help us help us because listen when
[1:17:39] when when when when the squeeze come on
[1:17:41] brother brother said there'll be many
[1:17:43] people that will die because they stand
[1:17:46] for this message
[1:17:48] but you don't hear that being preached
[1:17:50] i just heard him the other day on it
[1:17:55] and if he said it that's what's going to
[1:17:56] happen
[1:18:01] i know something's going to happen in
[1:18:02] america
[1:18:05] is that right
[1:18:07] brother brown said
[1:18:08] the last elijah's last stand was on the
[1:18:11] white house
[1:18:14] help us jesus
[1:18:16] as long as i am in the world
[1:18:20] i am the light of the world
[1:18:25] is he still the light
[1:18:27] he is still the light
[1:18:29] that's why we must live it
[1:18:32] because we are the light we must be
[1:18:34] different we must prove we did not come
[1:18:36] from satan's eden
[1:18:39] when he had thus spoken he spat on the
[1:18:41] ground and made clay of the spiral and
[1:18:44] he anointed the eyes of the blind man
[1:18:46] with clay
[1:18:47] and he said unto him go wash
[1:18:49] in the pool of sion which is interpreted
[1:18:52] sent he went his way therefore and
[1:18:55] washed and came seeing
[1:18:57] the neighbors therefore and they which
[1:19:00] before had seen him that he was blind
[1:19:02] and said is not this he that sat and
[1:19:05] begged now look at this never ever has
[1:19:10] this ever happened again happened before
[1:19:12] it was a miraculous thing and you'll
[1:19:15] never even find this that kind of thing
[1:19:18] happening in
[1:19:20] the old testament where a man was born
[1:19:23] blind
[1:19:25] and regained his sight
[1:19:27] never
[1:19:30] and you and i must understand it was so
[1:19:33] miraculous
[1:19:35] but instead of the people see what i'm
[1:19:36] saying they were so traditionally
[1:19:39] engaged
[1:19:40] they were blind
[1:19:43] and instead of seeing jesus as being the
[1:19:45] messiah
[1:19:47] they were so traditionally taught
[1:19:49] these things should not take place on
[1:19:52] the sabbath day and if it happens on the
[1:19:54] sabbath day this man must be a devil
[1:19:58] see how messed up in their minds
[1:20:03] and if we're not careful we'll think
[1:20:05] when nobody's got the holy ghost except
[1:20:07] those around our little clique
[1:20:12] like i said the other day amen
[1:20:14] elijah thought the same thing
[1:20:17] and the word of the lord came to him
[1:20:18] says no no no no no i have seven
[1:20:20] thousand
[1:20:23] you got people who can't even read and
[1:20:25] they know more about god than some
[1:20:27] people who can
[1:20:32] hallelujah
[1:20:34] you see how how messed up this can be
[1:20:40] what happens if god raised up a man
[1:20:43] who didn't grow up in the message but
[1:20:46] the message is in him
[1:20:51] christ
[1:20:52] is the message
[1:20:54] jesus christ is the message
[1:20:58] look with the pharisees they were so
[1:21:00] traditionally blind they could not see
[1:21:02] that god could use a prostitute
[1:21:05] and god took a prostitute something they
[1:21:08] wouldn't touch or even look at or even
[1:21:11] speak to
[1:21:13] and he took that woman and led her into
[1:21:15] the simon's house and openly
[1:21:19] embarrassed them
[1:21:21] openly put them to shame
[1:21:24] and openly rebuked them
[1:21:26] because they said to
[1:21:28] you know jesus caught their thoughts you
[1:21:30] know
[1:21:30] and he says listen
[1:21:32] i came here you didn't wash my feet you
[1:21:35] didn't worship me you didn't do nothing
[1:21:38] to show me favor
[1:21:40] but this woman came in she bowed herself
[1:21:43] down to me she started washing my feet
[1:21:46] she washed my her my feet were and dried
[1:21:49] up with her tears and dried with her
[1:21:51] hair simon tell
[1:21:54] me in other words
[1:21:57] he she didn't even say lord i want to be
[1:21:59] saved
[1:22:00] she didn't even open her mouth
[1:22:02] but knowing he was the word
[1:22:04] he was able to discern the thoughts and
[1:22:06] intents of the heart
[1:22:08] and he says woman your sins be forgiven
[1:22:12] and these people were so blind in their
[1:22:15] traditions
[1:22:17] this can't be
[1:22:19] how could this man let him you know
[1:22:22] touch and feel on his feet and oh you
[1:22:24] know what it had to really look bad
[1:22:29] hallelujah but just like jesus told them
[1:22:32] it's not what goes in
[1:22:34] it's what comes out
[1:22:38] washed his feet
[1:22:40] and these traditional pharisees and
[1:22:42] we've got many of them
[1:22:44] set right there and criticized
[1:22:47] you let somebody get wild in church
[1:22:49] before they think it's the holy ghost
[1:22:51] they think it's a demon
[1:22:53] because they're not used to the holy
[1:22:54] ghost
[1:22:56] y'all understand me that's the truth
[1:23:00] and i've seen it i've seen it i've seen
[1:23:04] great men of god in this message
[1:23:07] afraid of the holy ghost the holy ghost
[1:23:10] started move starts moving and they'll
[1:23:12] shut it down i've been to meetings like
[1:23:14] that personally i would not lie from the
[1:23:16] pulpit
[1:23:19] i told that brother i said if he would
[1:23:20] have come to shut me down he surely
[1:23:22] would have thought i had a demon
[1:23:25] i wouldn't have fought him i ought to
[1:23:27] worship god twice as much i would ought
[1:23:30] to transform myself into a david and he
[1:23:32] would have had something on his hand
[1:23:34] they would have put me out for
[1:23:36] disturbing church service
[1:23:38] oh i know it
[1:23:42] i know it i know it i know me but you
[1:23:45] know what maybe a little self might have
[1:23:46] been in it but anyway
[1:23:48] they would not have told me to sit down
[1:23:54] y'all don't fall asleep back there
[1:23:55] please
[1:23:58] you're so quiet ain't even saying amen
[1:24:02] but god is speaking anyhow
[1:24:05] some said this is he others he is like
[1:24:08] him
[1:24:09] but he said i am he didn't he want to
[1:24:12] believe the man's testimony therefore
[1:24:14] said they unto him how were thine eyes
[1:24:16] open
[1:24:18] he answered and said
[1:24:20] a man that is called jesus made clay and
[1:24:23] anointed my eyes
[1:24:24] and said unto me go to the pool of sin
[1:24:27] home and wash and i went and washed and
[1:24:30] i received sight
[1:24:32] then they said unto him where is he he
[1:24:35] said i not i know not
[1:24:37] they brought to the pharisees him that a
[1:24:40] four time was blind and it was the
[1:24:42] sabbath day when jesus made the clay and
[1:24:45] opened his eyes
[1:24:47] you think god made a mistake
[1:24:50] he understood their traditional errors
[1:24:53] he rebuked them from for their hypocrisy
[1:24:56] he said if you had had an ox that fall
[1:24:58] in the ditch on the sabbath day you
[1:25:01] would have gotten him out
[1:25:03] and here's a daughter of god
[1:25:05] that is being healed and you having a
[1:25:07] problem with that you hypocrite
[1:25:10] which one is worth more
[1:25:12] the ox
[1:25:13] or the one that is the daughter of god
[1:25:17] see we we we we just we don't understand
[1:25:20] it sounds like i'm being critical i'm
[1:25:21] just being honest
[1:25:23] i'm being straightforward because i want
[1:25:26] god to deal with all of us tonight and
[1:25:28] open our eyes so we can be free like
[1:25:31] we're supposed to be free
[1:25:36] it's true
[1:25:37] holy spirit comes in the service and
[1:25:39] you're worried about what other people
[1:25:40] think
[1:25:41] i don't care if you say run run
[1:25:45] jump whatever
[1:25:46] sometimes he might say go lay hand on
[1:25:48] that brother go lay hands on that sister
[1:25:50] as long as you're not disturbing the
[1:25:52] preacher do it
[1:25:54] we're just to we just to something we we
[1:25:57] lock him out
[1:25:59] because we're so concerned about what
[1:26:01] other people are going to think and oh i
[1:26:03] don't want to disturb the service
[1:26:05] isn't that funny
[1:26:07] god told a lady
[1:26:09] to go pray for a lady
[1:26:11] and her baby
[1:26:13] and she said oh no i can't do it brother
[1:26:15] branham is here
[1:26:17] y'all remember the story
[1:26:21] and what happened
[1:26:23] god said god through brother graham said
[1:26:25] the lady is healed when you pray for
[1:26:29] you see them you see what i'm saying we
[1:26:31] push it off on other people and we fail
[1:26:33] to see god trying to use you
[1:26:37] oh i got to wait to the pastor you don't
[1:26:39] have to wait for the pastor
[1:26:41] the power of healing is in you if you
[1:26:43] got god in you
[1:26:45] whatsoever you doing word or deed do it
[1:26:48] all in the name of jesus we don't have a
[1:26:50] hierarchy here
[1:26:53] god help us
[1:26:56] like i said the early church they didn't
[1:26:58] have a bible
[1:26:59] we don't know how long it took the
[1:27:01] scrolls to get to their churches but one
[1:27:03] thing they were totally led by the holy
[1:27:05] spirit every day
[1:27:08] god is the word
[1:27:10] god is the word didn't is that right he
[1:27:12] said i will write my word upon the
[1:27:14] tables of your heart
[1:27:19] therefore the there since the pharisees
[1:27:21] this man is not of god because he
[1:27:23] keepeth not the sabbath day others said
[1:27:25] how could a man that is a sinner do such
[1:27:28] miracles and where
[1:27:30] and there was a division among them
[1:27:32] they said unto the blind man again what
[1:27:34] saith thou of him that he have opened
[1:27:37] thine eyes he said he is a prophet
[1:27:40] but the jews did not believe concerning
[1:27:42] him that he had been blind and received
[1:27:44] insight until they called the parents of
[1:27:47] him isn't that something they're asking
[1:27:50] the man who was blind
[1:27:53] you see what i'm saying
[1:27:55] there is such denial
[1:27:57] because jesus didn't come from their
[1:28:00] denomination
[1:28:02] or organization
[1:28:05] right
[1:28:06] that that's what happened with jesus
[1:28:09] they asked him what authority did you
[1:28:11] have
[1:28:13] in other words what branch of religion
[1:28:15] did you come from i mean where did you
[1:28:17] get your doctrine degree
[1:28:18] you know
[1:28:19] did you graduate magnum laude
[1:28:24] see they didn't understand where he came
[1:28:26] from how can you have such an authority
[1:28:28] and know the word as well as you do i
[1:28:30] still i still wonder i still wonder how
[1:28:33] on earth jesus got in that pulpit
[1:28:37] and they knew about him
[1:28:40] and they
[1:28:41] he got in that position and opened the
[1:28:42] scriptures at this day the scripture is
[1:28:44] fulfilled
[1:28:46] and he sits in the chair of elijah
[1:28:51] but he just he did things to just
[1:28:54] disturb them he broke their traditions
[1:28:57] he he he he was a rebel to them
[1:29:01] they hated him because they knew they
[1:29:03] couldn't stop him
[1:29:05] the power of god was with him even
[1:29:07] nicodemus said we know
[1:29:10] that they are a teacher come from god
[1:29:11] because no man can do these things
[1:29:14] see so they understood
[1:29:17] and what i'm trying to tell us you know
[1:29:19] we we must you know we've seen how the
[1:29:22] organizations in the nomination did
[1:29:24] brother random
[1:29:26] and they didn't understand when they
[1:29:27] were putting him out they were
[1:29:28] fulfilling revelations the third chapter
[1:29:30] where jesus was standing outside the
[1:29:31] doorknob
[1:29:33] they had no idea what they were doing
[1:29:35] but the word of god said they were going
[1:29:36] to do it
[1:29:39] you understand me so you say well what
[1:29:40] do you mean brother brooks listen i'm
[1:29:42] going to tell you something brother
[1:29:44] branham if you heard me say this earlier
[1:29:46] brother branham has fulfilled his word
[1:29:48] the word of god
[1:29:50] but the bride of jesus christ was left
[1:29:51] on record message a message
[1:29:54] a message of of of maturing
[1:29:57] a message of coming because he talks
[1:29:58] about y'all better listen to those tapes
[1:30:01] he and i mean listen with a different
[1:30:03] ear
[1:30:03] not a traditional ear
[1:30:05] oh i'm going to learn to see how deep i
[1:30:07] can get no feed me lord
[1:30:10] this is bread from heaven this is bread
[1:30:13] from the shekinah glory it is the only
[1:30:16] thing that's going to transform you
[1:30:19] no man can do it
[1:30:23] i know how people think
[1:30:27] they're wrong
[1:30:29] in so many ways but you know i'm not
[1:30:30] going to get into doctrinal issues right
[1:30:32] now
[1:30:33] his parents and listen they were afraid
[1:30:36] right
[1:30:38] you go ask him he old enough
[1:30:42] see that's how you know instead of
[1:30:44] standing there what a miracle your child
[1:30:47] been born blind he's 30 years old and
[1:30:50] you're afraid of men
[1:30:54] but this man
[1:30:56] may have been born blind
[1:30:58] but he could see through the darkness
[1:31:01] that's where i'm going
[1:31:03] he may have been born blind
[1:31:05] but he could see through the darkness
[1:31:08] he understood
[1:31:10] what hypocrisy was
[1:31:12] he could see the pharisees and what they
[1:31:14] really were even when they
[1:31:17] they saw miracle the miracle listen he
[1:31:19] says listen nothing has been done like
[1:31:21] this ever before wearing the scripture
[1:31:23] wearing the scrolls
[1:31:25] and then you got the audacity to say
[1:31:27] this is of the devil he says show me in
[1:31:29] the word where a sinner was able to do
[1:31:31] such a thing
[1:31:34] he said judges any way you want to
[1:31:37] but i'll tell you like this i once was
[1:31:39] blind but now i see
[1:31:43] hallelujah it wasn't only that he saw
[1:31:45] jesus but he saw the system
[1:31:48] amen hallelujah and kicking them out of
[1:31:51] the system was the best thing that could
[1:31:54] happen the prophet god preached a
[1:31:56] message then jesus came
[1:31:58] sometimes you've got to go through those
[1:32:00] dark moments to before jesus come and
[1:32:03] rescue you
[1:32:06] hallelujah
[1:32:08] oh jesus help us lord
[1:32:11] we don't take a stand for this message
[1:32:13] like we do we want to make it a
[1:32:14] tradition you know we want to make it a
[1:32:16] yesterday and brother said that's the
[1:32:18] problem we always look backwards
[1:32:21] and see what god has done
[1:32:23] in the past and we always say what he's
[1:32:25] going to do in the future and we can't
[1:32:27] even see what he's doing now
[1:32:31] this is not a mind game
[1:32:33] god is not just feeding our mind with
[1:32:35] the word so we can intellectually know
[1:32:36] him
[1:32:38] what page is on and what book is out of
[1:32:41] god don't even care you're the living
[1:32:43] you are the living word
[1:32:45] what god wants that he wants that bible
[1:32:48] he wants those tapes he wants those
[1:32:50] books to transform move off the page
[1:32:53] into the vessel
[1:32:55] living epistles written and read of all
[1:32:58] men that's what he wants
[1:33:00] and everybody's looking at oh who's got
[1:33:03] the biggest church and we understand
[1:33:04] having big churches don't mean one thing
[1:33:07] to god
[1:33:09] you're preaching right you ain't gonna
[1:33:10] have one big church
[1:33:15] hello
[1:33:17] jesus had multitudes
[1:33:19] until he started preaching it right
[1:33:23] you ain't following me for my word
[1:33:25] you follow me for the fish and the laws
[1:33:33] it's true
[1:33:34] i'm telling you you you you have a
[1:33:36] meeting even in
[1:33:37] in the message church you have a meeting
[1:33:38] and tell people you don't have food
[1:33:40] people come from out of the world where
[1:33:42] you ain't no you've never seen them
[1:33:43] before
[1:33:44] but they're there
[1:33:47] god help us jesus same spirit
[1:33:51] then king
[1:33:52] then again called them
[1:33:54] they the man that was blind and said
[1:33:56] unto him give god the praise we know
[1:33:59] that this man is a sinner
[1:34:01] and he answered and said whether he be a
[1:34:03] sinner no i know not one thing i know
[1:34:06] that whereas i was blind now i see
[1:34:09] then they said to him again what did he
[1:34:12] do today how how open he thine eyes and
[1:34:16] he answered them i have told you already
[1:34:20] in other words why are you bugging me i
[1:34:21] didn't already told you this
[1:34:23] and you did not hear wherefore would you
[1:34:26] hear it again
[1:34:27] will you also listen he's being sassy
[1:34:31] he's annoyed
[1:34:32] yeah and he says listen
[1:34:34] you're going to hear together and told
[1:34:36] you one time wherefore would ye hear it
[1:34:38] again will you also be his disciples
[1:34:42] he shut him up being didn't he then they
[1:34:44] reviled him and said thou art his
[1:34:46] disciple
[1:34:48] but we are moses disciples there you go
[1:34:53] they were so blind
[1:34:55] they couldn't see the move of god
[1:34:58] they couldn't see their visitation
[1:35:00] they didn't it was right in the word
[1:35:03] i mean come on
[1:35:04] when when uh
[1:35:13] i said like this can any good thing come
[1:35:15] out of nazareth see that's all people
[1:35:17] look at
[1:35:19] but they don't see they don't see
[1:35:22] they don't see how god immorphy clothes
[1:35:26] himself in human flesh
[1:35:28] and i'm going to tell you now
[1:35:31] if you don't believe that god has come
[1:35:34] in the flesh
[1:35:35] john says you're antichrist
[1:35:38] and what let's bring it to your table
[1:35:40] if you don't believe that god comes into
[1:35:43] your flesh
[1:35:45] you are antichrist
[1:35:47] this building has nothing to do with
[1:35:49] holiness
[1:35:51] it's you
[1:35:52] you are the temple of god
[1:35:54] and that's where god wants to occupy you
[1:35:59] listen
[1:36:00] all of us need to be sanctified
[1:36:04] because he can't do it otherwise
[1:36:08] hello
[1:36:09] it's the truth
[1:36:10] you want more god you got to get rid of
[1:36:12] your stuff
[1:36:17] we want to see a revival get rid of the
[1:36:19] trash
[1:36:22] lord is me standing in the kneel of
[1:36:24] prayer
[1:36:25] me lord not my brother not my sister
[1:36:29] it's me
[1:36:34] but don't you worry he's working on me
[1:36:36] he's doing just what he promised he was
[1:36:38] going to do
[1:36:39] and i'm really excited about it we know
[1:36:42] that god here is not sinners but if any
[1:36:44] man be a worship of god and do this will
[1:36:46] him he hear it since the world began was
[1:36:48] it not
[1:36:49] preaching or he preaching to the
[1:36:51] preachers it was not her that any man
[1:36:53] opened the eyes of one that was born
[1:36:55] blind if this man were not of god he
[1:36:58] could not he could do nothing they
[1:37:00] answered and said to him thou was all
[1:37:02] altogether born in sin
[1:37:06] see what i'm saying
[1:37:07] you know they don't ask the question who
[1:37:08] did sin jesus said nobody but this is
[1:37:11] done to the glory to be the glory of god
[1:37:13] now they put the man back in sin
[1:37:16] and does thou teach us
[1:37:18] and they can't they cast him out jesus
[1:37:21] heard that they had cast him out and
[1:37:23] when he had found him he said unto him
[1:37:25] does thou believe
[1:37:27] on the son of god and he answered and
[1:37:29] said who is this lord who is he lord
[1:37:32] that i might believe on him and jesus
[1:37:34] said to him thou hast both seen him and
[1:37:37] is
[1:37:37] he it is he that talketh with thee and
[1:37:40] he said lord i believe and just what he
[1:37:43] did he worshipped him we don't know
[1:37:46] where he was he wasn't in a building he
[1:37:48] was wherever jesus was he broke out into
[1:37:51] worship
[1:37:53] what was it
[1:37:55] jesus freed him and he whom the son set
[1:37:58] free is free indeed
[1:38:00] freed him from his natural blindness
[1:38:03] freedom from his organizational
[1:38:05] blindness right and he came to jesus he
[1:38:08] saw the word
[1:38:11] he understood the word was god because
[1:38:13] no jew would have worshipped another man
[1:38:16] not a real one
[1:38:19] traditions of men blinds are so terribly
[1:38:22] bad and they creep up like serpents
[1:38:27] it always start out right
[1:38:29] and ends up wrong
[1:38:31] there are things that we are to do that
[1:38:33] are not traditions they're ordered by
[1:38:35] god
[1:38:36] things like dressing holy and living
[1:38:38] holy and you know baptism and communion
[1:38:41] and things of those natures those things
[1:38:44] are god-ordered
[1:38:46] they're not traditions of men
[1:38:48] traditions of men is when they add
[1:38:50] things to things
[1:38:52] you know they measure your dress and say
[1:38:54] it has to be so long
[1:38:57] you know different stupid stuff like
[1:38:58] that right
[1:39:01] but where
[1:39:02] lest any man spoil you through
[1:39:04] philosophies
[1:39:06] and vain deceit let me tell you
[1:39:07] something you will never have to worry
[1:39:10] about the way a woman dress or a man
[1:39:11] dress if their heart is right
[1:39:14] god will teach you
[1:39:17] don't tell me he won't he will
[1:39:20] beware lest any man spoil you through
[1:39:22] philosophies and vain deceit after
[1:39:24] tradition of men after the rudiments of
[1:39:27] the world and not after christ right we
[1:39:30] we you know we we can't allow ourselves
[1:39:33] to to focus on you know shouting and
[1:39:36] dancing and speaking in tongues and
[1:39:37] that's really good i love it all but
[1:39:40] we're in the time of change
[1:39:44] it's about changing from glory to glory
[1:39:48] it's about changing into his image it's
[1:39:50] about changing and pressing amen into
[1:39:53] from brotherly kindness into divine love
[1:39:56] yes and these things come by what
[1:40:00] prayer
[1:40:04] believing god's word and praying
[1:40:07] he said you have not because you what
[1:40:10] ask not
[1:40:12] for in him dwelleth all the fullness of
[1:40:14] the godhead bodily and ye are complete
[1:40:17] in him which is the head
[1:40:19] of all principalities and powers
[1:40:24] and we we fall into real worship of men
[1:40:28] we worship men because this man has a
[1:40:30] certain name and that man has a certain
[1:40:32] name this man got a big church and that
[1:40:35] man got a big church and let me tell you
[1:40:37] something that's just what the
[1:40:37] pentecostals do
[1:40:39] bishop so and so and bishop this and
[1:40:41] whatever bishop said
[1:40:43] whatever the board of bishop do that's
[1:40:45] what we do
[1:40:47] nonsense it's a trick of the devil
[1:40:51] god don't have cookie cutters
[1:40:54] every person is an individual
[1:40:56] but we come together like living stones
[1:40:59] to worship god
[1:41:08] brother bam says here a woman standing
[1:41:10] here i'm a young man waiting to get
[1:41:12] married she's she meets my
[1:41:14] specifications
[1:41:16] every way she's a lovely christian she
[1:41:18] looks like one she's dressed like one oh
[1:41:20] she got a dress oh yeah she acts like
[1:41:23] one she lives like one i i'll admit she
[1:41:26] make me a good wife but
[1:41:28] she isn't mine
[1:41:30] till i take her for mine
[1:41:34] you understand me
[1:41:35] because all of the traditions all of the
[1:41:37] things we do y'all can look bright
[1:41:40] but you're not bright
[1:41:42] till he take
[1:41:44] you that's the way the message is you
[1:41:48] can sympathize with it and say it's
[1:41:50] right but you've got to take it to
[1:41:52] yourself to become part of it
[1:41:56] then you and the message become one then
[1:42:00] the anointings
[1:42:02] with you as it is with the others
[1:42:06] like moses and elijah and all these
[1:42:08] things that the same anointing is now
[1:42:11] with you
[1:42:13] that's who do you say this is
[1:42:15] he preached such a powerful message
[1:42:17] trying to get the people to recognize
[1:42:19] their day and his message
[1:42:21] hallelujah can i go just a little bit
[1:42:23] further just like
[1:42:25] this comes amen from who is this
[1:42:27] melchizedek
[1:42:29] he says listen just like a great
[1:42:31] architect can sit down in his mind and
[1:42:34] draw out what the what he thinks it's
[1:42:36] he's going to do to build create now he
[1:42:40] cannot create he can take something
[1:42:42] that's been created and make it in
[1:42:46] in in a different form because god is
[1:42:48] the only way only one can create but he
[1:42:52] gets
[1:42:53] in his mind
[1:42:55] what he's going to do
[1:42:58] and that his thought
[1:43:00] that
[1:43:01] that's his desire
[1:43:03] now it's a thought and then he speaks it
[1:43:06] and it's a word then and a word is a
[1:43:09] thought and when it is expressed it's a
[1:43:11] word a thought expressed is a word but
[1:43:14] it has to be a thought first so it's god
[1:43:18] attributes
[1:43:19] it becomes a thought then a word
[1:43:22] notice those who have have tonight
[1:43:25] eternal life was with him and in him and
[1:43:28] in his thinking before there ever was an
[1:43:31] angel star cherubim or anything else
[1:43:34] so let me say it
[1:43:37] in in in our little way of terms
[1:43:40] brother venom says even when i was a
[1:43:42] child or he said how can i say it he
[1:43:44] says when you was a child you knew you
[1:43:46] were different
[1:43:47] something told you you were different
[1:43:49] you were odd and you couldn't even
[1:43:51] figure it out
[1:43:52] in in in reality that that was
[1:43:55] representation
[1:43:56] that was election pulling on you
[1:43:59] how many times you should have been dead
[1:44:01] and god didn't let it happen
[1:44:04] huh
[1:44:05] so many things have happened in your
[1:44:06] life and and you don't even know how you
[1:44:08] got out of it
[1:44:10] but god brought you
[1:44:12] and when everybody criticized you you
[1:44:13] were can i can i say you know you were
[1:44:16] the black sheep of the family
[1:44:18] he was the one that god they didn't want
[1:44:19] around
[1:44:21] right
[1:44:22] and when i say that i mean anybody can
[1:44:24] be a black sheep you could be chinese
[1:44:25] and still be a black sheep but my point
[1:44:27] is you're the one that they rejected and
[1:44:30] you know i looked that up because i
[1:44:32] didn't know what a black sheep was and a
[1:44:33] black sheep when they're born among the
[1:44:35] white sheep the black sheep don't they
[1:44:37] don't want nothing to do with it
[1:44:39] isn't that crazy
[1:44:41] but anyhow that's just the way it is see
[1:44:43] so those kind of things even go down to
[1:44:45] the animal
[1:44:47] yeah anything that's different people
[1:44:49] are afraid of it
[1:44:52] right he isn't god see see so what
[1:44:54] happens you know uh we can't even
[1:44:56] understand why we love god how many of
[1:44:58] y'all know why
[1:45:00] all we can say is because he first love
[1:45:02] us
[1:45:04] that's it
[1:45:07] you can't listen
[1:45:10] let's say it like this
[1:45:11] the holy ghost in you
[1:45:13] you can't even explain it
[1:45:16] it's unexplainable but yet you know you
[1:45:18] got it
[1:45:20] my god he is
[1:45:23] and if he's infinite he is if and if he
[1:45:26] isn't infinite
[1:45:31] let me go back
[1:45:34] in his thinking before there ever was an
[1:45:36] angel star cherubim or anything else
[1:45:39] that's eternal and if you have eternal
[1:45:41] life you always was not your being here
[1:45:45] but the shape and form that
[1:45:48] the infinite god
[1:45:49] and if he's
[1:45:51] is an infinite he is
[1:45:53] he isn't god
[1:45:54] god has to be infinite we are finite he
[1:45:58] is infinite
[1:45:59] and he was omnipotent omniscient
[1:46:03] omnipotent excuse me i'm the president
[1:46:05] omniscient omnipotent if he isn't then
[1:46:08] he can't be god
[1:46:10] knows all things all places because his
[1:46:13] omnipotence uh i'm the president
[1:46:15] omnipotential
[1:46:17] makes him omnipotent i'm the present he
[1:46:20] is a being he's not like the wind he is
[1:46:23] a being he dwells in the house but being
[1:46:26] omnis omniscient knowing all things make
[1:46:30] him omnipresent because he knows
[1:46:32] everything that's going on
[1:46:35] so i'm gonna break it down before i i'm
[1:46:37] almost done
[1:46:39] the reality of the believer
[1:46:48] is that god is not far
[1:46:51] the reality of a believer we understand
[1:46:54] that god is in this place right now
[1:47:01] we know that not only does god occupy
[1:47:04] this space but also
[1:47:06] angels do too
[1:47:10] and if we could open it up and see it it
[1:47:13] probably would terrify us
[1:47:15] because of the holiness
[1:47:18] and you can't ever think that god don't
[1:47:20] hear your thoughts
[1:47:23] because the bible tells us he he heard
[1:47:25] them before they got there
[1:47:28] now my thing is this is that you know if
[1:47:30] we could see god and this is what we do
[1:47:33] the reality is we put god so far away
[1:47:37] and we forget he's in here
[1:47:40] if we could remember he's here
[1:47:43] we would stress out
[1:47:46] we wouldn't worry
[1:47:48] we wouldn't fear because we know god is
[1:47:51] in his temple
[1:47:52] he's in there
[1:47:55] if we could remember that god is not
[1:47:57] just
[1:47:58] is in heaven but we are the ones that
[1:48:01] are in heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:48:04] right
[1:48:05] and he's just another dimensional way
[1:48:08] we can't see him
[1:48:10] but he can see us
[1:48:14] right
[1:48:15] that's why i try to tell people don't
[1:48:16] think you sneaking around and doing
[1:48:18] stuff and god don't see you he see you
[1:48:23] you know when i confess to the lord i
[1:48:25] don't only just confess to him i confess
[1:48:27] to
[1:48:28] his angels and everybody that was
[1:48:29] looking on
[1:48:31] y'all looking at me like crazy but it's
[1:48:33] true
[1:48:36] lord forgive me
[1:48:40] heaven watches you you know
[1:48:43] yes they do remember the story about
[1:48:45] babylon
[1:48:47] lord have you seen what's going on in
[1:48:50] babylon
[1:48:52] those were angels reporting to god
[1:48:58] you're never alone he said you wouldn't
[1:49:00] be and you never are
[1:49:03] television does not manufacture a
[1:49:05] picture a television only channels it
[1:49:08] into a circuit
[1:49:10] and then the television screen picks it
[1:49:12] up but the picture is there
[1:49:14] to begin with
[1:49:15] television wasn't here television was
[1:49:18] here when adam was here television was
[1:49:20] here when elijah said on mount carmel
[1:49:23] television was here when jesus of
[1:49:25] nazareth walked the shores of galilee
[1:49:27] but you're just now discovering it
[1:49:30] they would have have they wouldn't have
[1:49:32] believed it
[1:49:34] back there you have been crazy to have
[1:49:37] said something like it but now it's
[1:49:39] become a reality you understand so god
[1:49:43] even through science has shown us that
[1:49:45] these dimensions do exist
[1:49:50] and so is it
[1:49:52] christ
[1:49:57] and so is it that christ is here
[1:50:01] that's what he said
[1:50:03] if television he said christ is here the
[1:50:05] angels of god are here
[1:50:07] and someday in the great millennium to
[1:50:09] come it'll be just more real than
[1:50:12] television or anything else because they
[1:50:14] are here
[1:50:15] he reveals himself in his great form of
[1:50:18] what he claimed as he's a morphe himself
[1:50:22] into his servants and proves himself
[1:50:26] ah my i i need to need to close
[1:50:30] but but but let me tell you in my
[1:50:31] thought
[1:50:32] last thought i'll say this
[1:50:36] we got to recognize the power election
[1:50:39] because the power of election supersedes
[1:50:42] grace
[1:50:44] did you know that
[1:50:45] because if he wasn't elected you
[1:50:47] wouldn't have grace
[1:50:49] the election came first
[1:50:52] then grace
[1:50:54] and you know it works with grace
[1:50:57] right
[1:51:00] but god chose you
[1:51:03] to experience grace
[1:51:06] and
[1:51:07] when you realize that i came from god
[1:51:09] and i go back to god
[1:51:12] you understand like a dew drop you had
[1:51:14] to fall
[1:51:16] but the same dew drop
[1:51:18] sees a resurrection when the sun strikes
[1:51:20] it
[1:51:21] and pulls it back into its proper place
[1:51:25] and that's where we are the reality is i
[1:51:28] came from god and i go back to god
[1:51:30] nothing can stop me from going back
[1:51:33] because i'm a part of him and he's a
[1:51:36] part of me
[1:51:37] but then said but let your faith touch
[1:51:39] him
[1:51:40] and watch what happened
[1:51:42] now if i believe god's servant and have
[1:51:45] told you the truth
[1:51:47] god will vindicate that to be the truth
[1:51:50] and that would prove that jesus christ
[1:51:53] is living tonight
[1:51:55] see if you can believe what he said
[1:51:57] and you believe he's truly a prophet
[1:52:00] you believe what he says and god will
[1:52:02] vindicate it
[1:52:04] he will vindicate it to you
[1:52:06] that's the way it works the reality of
[1:52:09] we got to stop you know um
[1:52:12] we can stand we got to stop thinking
[1:52:16] if you truly seed
[1:52:19] you know
[1:52:23] you know that the whole thing about
[1:52:25] today is that everybody's trying to be
[1:52:27] something they're not
[1:52:29] you know you got all those trans this
[1:52:31] and trans that and
[1:52:33] i'm not going to speak much on that but
[1:52:34] no matter how much they trans they'll
[1:52:36] never be
[1:52:38] god knew what he did it was doing when
[1:52:40] he made
[1:52:41] man he knew what he did was doing when
[1:52:43] he made woman
[1:52:44] you know and
[1:52:46] the the evolution they're trying to find
[1:52:49] is not in science
[1:52:50] it's in god
[1:52:52] that god would take a sinner such as i
[1:52:56] such as you
[1:52:57] transform us
[1:52:59] into sons and daughters of god
[1:53:01] replants us
[1:53:03] in the new
[1:53:04] world
[1:53:06] we'll come again
[1:53:08] after we dust turn into dust we'll come
[1:53:11] again
[1:53:12] by the voice of god he'll call us from
[1:53:15] the earth
[1:53:17] and we'll find ourselves walking the new
[1:53:19] streets of jerusalem
[1:53:21] it won't be no babies there so when you
[1:53:24] hear people say oh i went to heaven and
[1:53:25] i saw babies and all day i don't know
[1:53:27] they might have went somewhere but it
[1:53:29] wasn't not the heaven i'm talking about
[1:53:32] babies came by the way of the fall
[1:53:35] it never was to be
[1:53:37] and so calvary brought us back
[1:53:40] to the reality of what we should be
[1:53:44] and there ain't a thing satan can do
[1:53:47] because jesus christ conquered death
[1:53:49] hell and the grave
[1:53:51] now we are in a place of restoration
[1:53:54] god is restoring us
[1:53:56] so you can come brother
[1:53:58] sing a song or two or so
[1:54:00] i don't know if there's anybody that
[1:54:02] needs prayer you're more than welcome to
[1:54:04] come up
[1:54:05] but i'll say one thing we should be the
[1:54:07] most happiest people in the world we
[1:54:10] don't need psychiatry
[1:54:13] we don't need that
[1:54:14] we just need the power of god
[1:54:17] reading books on how to do this and how
[1:54:19] to do that we need god
[1:54:23] you get god
[1:54:25] he'll show you how to do it
[1:54:29] i often wonder
[1:54:32] we all got all these cookbooks
[1:54:35] and i think who was the first cook
[1:54:39] and where did the inspiration come from
[1:54:42] [Music]
[1:54:45] the earliest i know is the bible
[1:54:47] god told israel how to bake cook the
[1:54:50] lamb
[1:54:51] how to roast the
[1:54:52] the
[1:54:53] herb how to do all of that and i guess
[1:54:55] it all came from there
[1:54:57] i don't know
[1:54:59] but one thing i know
[1:55:02] is that god is in control
[1:55:05] and i'm glad he is
[1:55:09] i just can't worry because i want and
[1:55:11] either you came from god or you didn't
[1:55:14] you got to believe that you did
[1:55:16] something tell you you came from god
[1:55:18] believe it
[1:55:20] [Music]
[1:55:24] just pray
