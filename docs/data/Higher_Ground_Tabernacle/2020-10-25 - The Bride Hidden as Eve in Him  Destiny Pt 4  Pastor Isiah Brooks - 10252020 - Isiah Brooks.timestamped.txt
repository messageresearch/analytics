[34:15] verse of psalm 27.
[34:33] then we'll go to psalms 32 and 7.
[34:41] psalm 27.
[34:48] we read the fourth and the fifth verse
[34:55] one thing have i desired of the lord
[34:59] and i will seek after that i may dwell
[35:03] in the house of the lord all the days of
[35:05] my life
[35:07] to behold the beauty of the lord and to
[35:10] inquire
[35:12] in his temple for in the time of trouble
[35:17] he shall hide me in his pavilion
[35:20] in the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[35:23] hide me
[35:25] he shall set me up upon
[35:28] a rock psalms 32
[35:35] we're going to read the seventh verse
[35:43] thou art my hiding place thou
[35:46] shall preserve me from trouble
[35:49] thou shall compass me about with
[35:52] songs of deliverance amen let us pray
[35:57] father god we thank you for your amazing
[36:00] grace
[36:01] we thank you for being so good to us
[36:03] lord you have been
[36:04] better to us than we've been to
[36:06] ourselves
[36:08] we pray this morning oh god that your
[36:10] perfect will be done we'll be careful to
[36:12] give you the praise glory and honor
[36:14] anoint your servants
[36:15] servant lord we can't do nothing without
[36:18] you lord and we're not here to be seen
[36:20] of ourselves
[36:21] we pray father god that the people will
[36:23] see you
[36:24] lord granted in your name jesus christ
[36:26] we pray
[36:27] amen you may be seated
[36:35] as many of you know that we've been
[36:36] working in the area of destiny
[36:40] last time we ministered we
[36:43] ministered a man for in a time of
[36:45] trouble
[36:47] i love that because i realize that my
[36:49] god always hears us
[36:52] when we uh in trouble we know by god's
[36:56] grace that we have
[36:58] talked about various things uh in the
[37:01] book of joshua
[37:02] in the book of judges and we kind of
[37:03] like been working along that line
[37:06] just trying to show everybody where we
[37:08] are and who we are
[37:10] because as jesus christ is through every
[37:13] page or throughout the bible so are we
[37:16] because we are one with him and
[37:19] therefore if we can see the very shadows
[37:22] and types
[37:23] that brother branham talked about
[37:24] because that's why he said that's how he
[37:26] learned
[37:27] that's how god taught him rather is by
[37:30] the shadows and types
[37:32] and knowing that jesus christ is the
[37:34] same yesterday today and forever
[37:36] and that he is a god that changes not i
[37:39] thank god for that because
[37:41] if he was a god that that would change i
[37:43] wouldn't know
[37:44] how to serve him i wouldn't know how to
[37:46] love him
[37:47] um you know even even james talks about
[37:50] it he said
[37:51] a double-minded man is unstable in all
[37:53] of his ways
[37:55] so we realize by god's grace we're
[37:57] living in a time of perplexity
[37:59] where things are so confusing you don't
[38:02] know who to trust um
[38:05] you see your country uh and not just in
[38:08] america it's everywhere falling apart
[38:10] and and uh you know the messenger of
[38:13] this
[38:13] hour actually preached a message this
[38:16] world is falling apart
[38:18] well if we couldn't see it then we can
[38:20] see it now
[38:21] amen but we realize amen that the gospel
[38:25] has always
[38:26] ran neck and neck with what we call
[38:28] science
[38:29] as science achieved things uh in the
[38:32] natural
[38:33] the bride of jesus christ or the church
[38:35] of jesus christ
[38:36] always would achieve things in the
[38:38] spiritual
[38:39] and you know it kind of confuses me
[38:41] sometime because
[38:43] you know i can see the progress uh from
[38:45] the horse to the horse and the buggy
[38:47] i can see the progress from the horse
[38:49] and the bugger to
[38:51] the airplane i could see uh different
[38:53] things of that nature but
[38:55] we are supposedly we are in what we call
[38:57] the uh
[38:59] the uh uh uh astro
[39:02] the astronaut age and um the astronaut
[39:06] age is the
[39:07] the top of the line you don't get any uh
[39:10] higher than that because
[39:11] in their achievements they are able to
[39:14] travel they're able to uh go beyond and
[39:17] break the sound barrier
[39:19] as well as time you know they actually
[39:24] gives us a a place where we can see
[39:27] where the church
[39:28] should be now whether the church is
[39:30] there or not
[39:32] uh that that's that's where that's where
[39:34] god come becomes the judge
[39:36] but my thing is we are a bride we are
[39:39] the bride of jesus christ
[39:41] and you and i must understand that this
[39:44] bible in itself
[39:45] should be our heartbeat it is where we
[39:49] live or should live it is where we come
[39:51] to understand
[39:52] not only god but comes to understand
[39:55] ourselves
[39:57] and the day that we're living in we're
[39:59] living in
[40:00] a horrible time as far as i'm concerned
[40:03] and
[40:04] it's just a horrific time but
[40:06] nonetheless
[40:08] in all of that it is the age in which
[40:10] god has ordained
[40:12] us to be in uh you know coming from the
[40:15] message countdown brother branham said
[40:17] uh a science when assad as science
[40:20] achieves some things
[40:22] and as we just did a moment ago we could
[40:24] look backwards and see their
[40:25] achievements and everything else
[40:27] and understand that all of their
[40:28] achievements even though it started with
[40:30] a horse
[40:31] uh yet and still you must understand it
[40:34] becomes more horses
[40:35] it doesn't become like a camel or
[40:38] something else
[40:39] the power increases from what it used to
[40:42] be
[40:42] into what it is now and and the
[40:45] achievements that
[40:47] that are going on you and i must
[40:48] understand that we supposed to be
[40:50] beyond what we call the church ages
[40:55] is that all right now coming from
[40:57] revelation 17
[40:58] 15 uh you know we we know
[41:01] the scripture uh uh talks about things
[41:04] but
[41:04] we're lit we're reading from the seven
[41:06] church ages and and i'm just building a
[41:08] a a a platform by god's graces
[41:11] brother baby says watch the church
[41:13] speaking to him now
[41:15] waters revelation 17 15 says
[41:19] waters means thickness and multitude of
[41:21] people
[41:22] now his voice or this being that was
[41:26] standing there
[41:27] looking like this christ in his church
[41:30] as bride and church being one like
[41:33] husband and wife is one
[41:35] the church and christ being molded
[41:37] together with one person
[41:40] the same holy ghost and and
[41:43] the things that christ did the church
[41:46] does also and see when i hear those
[41:49] things i'm like okay
[41:52] it's something that we're supposed to be
[41:54] doing and whatever he's doing is what
[41:57] we're supposed to be doing
[41:59] you know this bride of jesus christ is
[42:01] not
[42:02] just the assembling of people or just
[42:05] coming together on a sunday or wednesday
[42:08] the bride of jesus christ is some it's
[42:10] it's it's
[42:11] it's it's as a born-again believers
[42:15] who are working in the will of god every
[42:18] day
[42:21] hallelujah see the beautiful church
[42:23] there is
[42:24] holiness in power and majesty
[42:27] with seeing visions signs wonders
[42:31] everything just like he did here it is
[42:35] on earth
[42:35] giving all praise to god saying i
[42:39] can do nothing except the father show me
[42:42] but he shows me and here it is
[42:46] and we come to see these things go to
[42:49] taking place
[42:51] so the problem of god is saying listen
[42:53] these things are working god is working
[42:56] in a way that everybody's not going to
[42:59] see him but
[42:59] we realize by god's grace you know we
[43:02] can look back and we say
[43:03] you know we can see what william branham
[43:05] did we know what we we in branham
[43:07] but the focus is not on william branham
[43:09] anymore it's on the bride of jesus
[43:11] christ
[43:12] it's on you if you consider yourself the
[43:15] bride of jesus christ
[43:17] it's on you now we come to a place
[43:21] amen it is the capping off of the age
[43:24] it is what god is doing you know you can
[43:26] call it uh you know adoption whatever
[43:28] whatever you choose to to say it is but
[43:31] it is a time where the bride of jesus
[43:33] christ
[43:34] comes into a maturity not only just
[43:37] maturity but she comes to a place
[43:39] amen that she is so much like him
[43:43] right now we understand because even in
[43:46] the message of desperation
[43:48] the prophet says now what we're watching
[43:50] after the seven seals
[43:51] the uniting of the people uniting signs
[43:54] the red light flashing in the last day
[43:57] and you know i didn't realize amen that
[43:59] this particular phrase would be used in
[44:02] the quote
[44:03] that i'm reading right now because
[44:05] yesterday i was just thinking
[44:07] just thinking on the lord and you know
[44:09] god came and he spoke to my heart
[44:11] and this is what he said the red lights
[44:13] are flashing
[44:14] how many all know what that means that
[44:16] means it's a danger
[44:18] whenever the red light is flashing that
[44:21] means
[44:22] this is a warning it is a dangerous time
[44:25] and if you don't see the red light
[44:26] flashing and you cross the track you're
[44:29] in trouble
[44:31] if there's a train coming and you fail
[44:34] to see the warnings
[44:36] you're going to be hit by the train
[44:40] and that's not going to look so pretty
[44:43] red lights are flashing it is a warning
[44:48] right y'all know what i'm talking about
[44:50] you're going down the road you're
[44:51] bringing the speed limit
[44:53] all of a sudden you see the red light
[44:54] flashing
[44:56] and your heart starts beating right
[45:00] are you in trouble yes you are
[45:03] right because you have broken amen
[45:06] a speed law and it it's up to the police
[45:09] whether he gives you a ticket
[45:11] or a warning or just grace so you know
[45:15] either way you know when you see the red
[45:17] light flashing
[45:18] that means either stop be cautious
[45:22] don't go anywhere look both ways
[45:25] right so we understand it's a red light
[45:28] flashing
[45:29] he said the signs of women preaching
[45:31] pretty
[45:32] excuse me the signs of women getting
[45:34] prettier and man
[45:36] and what they would do and all these
[45:37] signs of the holy spirit leading up
[45:39] then come right here to the capping off
[45:43] of all those messages since the seventh
[45:46] seal now you say what do you mean
[45:48] brother books you've got to understand
[45:50] that when the prophet god was on the
[45:52] earth and we've gone through this before
[45:54] amen inside sir is this the time you
[45:56] know he didn't understand what god was
[45:58] doing he had this burden in his heart
[46:00] he knew god was going to do something
[46:01] with him he didn't know
[46:03] exactly how and what it was going to be
[46:05] like there was a time he thought he was
[46:07] going to die
[46:08] amen but it was not that it was the
[46:10] furthering of his ministry
[46:12] this is the purpose for which he was
[46:14] born
[46:16] and now is coming into play and
[46:19] it is the highlight of the word it is
[46:22] the greatest oh
[46:23] lord are you all weak this morning hello
[46:25] somebody
[46:27] it was the highlight of the word and
[46:29] here it comes into a place
[46:31] and then the god is getting ready to do
[46:33] something and
[46:34] think about it brother troy and i was
[46:37] talking about that
[46:38] this morning who else could it have been
[46:44] could you have done it i mean what he
[46:47] did
[46:48] will you matter what he did could you
[46:50] have done it the answer is
[46:52] no
[46:55] no you could not have because god when
[46:58] god chose him
[46:59] there was no option there was not
[47:03] two or three he could choose from
[47:06] there was only one there was only one
[47:08] moses
[47:09] there was only one joshua there was only
[47:12] one malachi
[47:12] 4. you could not have been that
[47:17] because god didn't choose you to be that
[47:20] hallelujah is that all right so i'm
[47:23] saying
[47:24] all of these things he did a perfect job
[47:27] because he was ordained to do a perfect
[47:29] job
[47:32] see it capped off in one thing and that
[47:35] was the token
[47:36] now we say oh brother books i i i want
[47:39] to be perfect i want to be just
[47:40] like him well in order for you to be
[47:42] just like him in the beatles
[47:44] it has to be the token how many all know
[47:46] what that is
[47:47] the token that's why he didn't say oh
[47:49] just the holy ghost he called it the
[47:51] token
[47:51] because that is god imperfection
[47:55] it is the sealing of god in you
[47:58] and you and i know that we consist of
[48:00] three part
[48:02] right the outer court the inner court
[48:04] and the holies of holies
[48:07] right the flesh the spirit
[48:10] and the soul and understand this
[48:13] your perfection is not perfection until
[48:16] the holy ghost is in your soul
[48:21] everything else is just potential
[48:24] you understand that you love the lord
[48:27] now brother adam talks about the pyramid
[48:30] and he doesn't go to a place
[48:31] where the pyramid we're not talking
[48:33] about a pyramid doctrine but we
[48:34] understand by god's grace what that is
[48:36] that is the statue of a perfect man
[48:39] and brother goes on he says you know the
[48:41] pyramid being those foundations into the
[48:43] king's chamber and this is what i like
[48:44] i'm trying to get you to see where we
[48:46] are
[48:46] okay if we have come up this ladder and
[48:49] we have come to brotherly kindness
[48:51] and we're we're looking in that place to
[48:54] be capped off with divine love
[48:56] where are you where are we and if this
[48:58] is a time
[48:59] to play this is a time to be sincere
[49:05] if you ever ever wanted to be sincere
[49:08] this is the time to be sincere this is
[49:11] not a time
[49:12] amen to play church hallelujah
[49:16] listen and we know we're talking about
[49:19] the king's chamber
[49:21] and you know in this particular quote
[49:22] come from god's only provided way
[49:24] he said there he says and you know uh
[49:27] and just before you hit the seventh wall
[49:31] there is a little introduction plank
[49:35] there where a messenger comes
[49:38] out to bring you to the king
[49:43] and i've been in that great pyramid in
[49:45] egypt
[49:47] what a blessing until i got
[49:50] claustrophobic
[49:53] but it was a blessing to know that i was
[49:56] able to climb those
[49:58] stairs and i was able to go into the
[50:00] king's chamber
[50:02] now i'm trusting that the natural types
[50:04] of spiritual
[50:08] amen but in that we realize amen the
[50:11] higher
[50:12] you went into the pyramid the smaller it
[50:15] became
[50:17] and it was such a a rush for me because
[50:20] i had never experienced claustrophobic
[50:23] uh but
[50:23] uh but you know it was just like more
[50:26] than enough people were coming in
[50:29] we were almost like this like you know
[50:31] in this little room there's only one way
[50:33] to go up and one way to come down which
[50:34] is the same way up and down
[50:37] and to be honest with you something
[50:38] struck me and i'm about climbed over the
[50:40] people getting out
[50:44] but you know i thought about it and i
[50:46] thought you know lord this is
[50:48] this is a place where
[50:51] many are called and few are chosen
[50:58] the room wasn't built for all of those
[51:01] people
[51:03] it was limited space and that's how it
[51:07] is in the king's chamber
[51:08] it is limited space
[51:13] but the messenger goes on and says the
[51:16] message of john the baptist
[51:18] that introduced the king and we know
[51:20] that he introduced jesus christ
[51:23] but they rejected him they call it
[51:28] the stone of scone whatever it is they
[51:32] don't
[51:32] know where it's at because it's a
[51:35] rejected stone
[51:37] but that's the stone that decaps the
[51:39] whole thing that
[51:40] makes the pyramid through complete seven
[51:43] church ages
[51:44] add grace to this and add this to this
[51:47] seventh and
[51:48] see the last one is christ now y'all get
[51:51] where i'm going
[51:52] i'm talking about now i'm not talking
[51:54] about the illustration
[51:56] i'm talking about a time and presence
[51:58] right now
[52:00] right now and like i said when you get
[52:03] to the place
[52:04] where this word becomes common and
[52:06] boring to you
[52:07] you are totally backslidden
[52:13] right so we realize by god's grace there
[52:16] is coming a final move
[52:20] and you're it i'm trusting that we are
[52:24] a move that god is bringing this bride
[52:27] into and it just scares me
[52:29] it really does something to me it makes
[52:32] me cry sometimes
[52:33] it makes me worry sometimes because i
[52:36] can see
[52:37] how the people are not spiritually in
[52:39] the condition they should be
[52:40] should be you say i don't
[52:44] brother book's god ain't yes he is if
[52:46] god made me the pastor i can see where
[52:49] you are
[52:52] and you and i must understand i'm trying
[52:54] my best to get you to see
[52:56] you don't have the time you think you
[52:58] have
[53:01] and think about it since you've been a
[53:02] christian how long it has taken you
[53:05] spiritually to get where you are now
[53:09] and you're still not where you want to
[53:11] be
[53:13] and you think that all of a sudden
[53:15] you're going to have a snap crackling
[53:17] pop
[53:18] no don't let him catch you with your
[53:21] work undone
[53:25] y'all understand me
[53:28] goes on he says listen the angel the one
[53:30] the voice who's talked to me
[53:32] has never ever told me anything wrong
[53:36] everything he's ever told me has come to
[53:38] pass
[53:41] that's right and he said because of that
[53:43] i can believe him
[53:46] hallelujah is that all right listen so
[53:50] you and i must understand
[53:52] amen that he he ever did say anything
[53:55] but was the truth hallelujah
[53:59] i believe him he said there will be
[54:02] after the baptism of the holy spirit
[54:05] and speaking in tongues and divine
[54:07] healing and so forth these things
[54:09] the capping of the pentecostal message
[54:12] is what we're speaking of today see
[54:15] that's what makes the message different
[54:17] we're not preaching a pentecostal
[54:19] message we're preaching a capstone
[54:21] message
[54:22] we're talking about amen rapturing faith
[54:25] rapturing gays
[54:26] amen and we're talking about getting the
[54:28] people in line
[54:29] amen to be translated but how can we be
[54:33] translated
[54:33] if our minds are still on the world how
[54:36] can we be translated when we're so
[54:38] rooted and grounded in the things and
[54:40] cares of the world and you know what the
[54:42] bible says
[54:42] when those things overtake you the love
[54:44] of god leaves you
[54:47] hallelujah you cannot love the world and
[54:49] love god at the same time
[54:53] we talk about a dangerous time you say
[54:56] that'll never happen to me let me tell
[54:57] you something
[54:58] israel thought there was something too
[55:00] the worst thing you can allow yourself
[55:02] is to develop pride
[55:04] in the message there's a lot of pride
[55:08] you know what i mean you don't even know
[55:09] what let me say it like this you know
[55:11] one of the worst things awakening things
[55:13] that i had
[55:13] have experienced is when i went to
[55:15] israel and i saw how prideful they were
[55:20] and they were prejudiced who were the
[55:22] jews yes
[55:24] the jews
[55:27] they were prejudiced and here and i'm
[55:30] not talking about
[55:31] against black people they were
[55:33] prejudiced against everybody that wasn't
[55:35] jewish
[55:38] and me and some of the sisters and
[55:39] brothers stood in line there at a shop
[55:43] and this jewish lady was waiting on us
[55:46] as soon as another jew came in she left
[55:48] us there
[55:49] didn't even say excuse me pardon me
[55:52] she left us there in line went and
[55:54] served that jewish lady
[55:56] then came back and served us
[55:59] it was obvious you understand what i'm
[56:03] saying
[56:04] but you got to understand that even so
[56:07] these jewish people can never get to
[56:09] heaven
[56:10] because they're jew the only way they
[56:13] can get to heaven is now
[56:14] you must be born again
[56:18] huh you and i must understand by the
[56:21] grace of god
[56:22] amen that this thing is turning their
[56:24] way
[56:26] and when god closes the gentile door he
[56:29] could care less on how vehemently you
[56:31] knock when the door is shut
[56:34] the door is shut the capping
[56:38] of this ministry where brother said this
[56:41] ministry is
[56:42] christ himself impersonated among his
[56:46] people y'all know what that means
[56:48] they're gonna act like him they're gonna
[56:50] talk like him they're gonna walk like
[56:52] him
[56:52] the miracles the signs the wonders and
[56:55] that's the thing
[56:56] it seems like the more uh we begin the
[56:59] world began to unfold to us
[57:01] either the more we want to become
[57:02] starchy
[57:04] this is not it it was fire that fell on
[57:08] the day of pentecost
[57:10] hallelujah and that same fire must be
[57:13] seen
[57:14] in the bride of jesus christ it cannot
[57:18] we cannot go as a dead church we cannot
[57:21] go
[57:22] as an intellectual church we must have
[57:25] the same fire of god that william
[57:28] branham had
[57:29] or we are not the we're not the product
[57:31] of william branham
[57:33] let me say that again we must have the
[57:35] same fire
[57:36] that william branham had or we're not a
[57:40] product of william branham
[57:43] hallelujah oh it don't matter how much
[57:46] you say i'm in the message
[57:48] millions were in the message of moses
[57:50] look how many
[57:51] amen that was in under joshua you see
[57:54] what i'm saying
[57:55] but my point is you must have a personal
[57:58] relationship with god
[58:00] and let me tell you something you don't
[58:01] have to tell me i know the devil don't
[58:03] like you praying
[58:06] he don't care if you come to church he
[58:08] don't care if you pay your tithe
[58:09] he'll let you read your bible but when
[58:11] it comes to prayer
[58:13] that's where he's going to fight you the
[58:15] most you know why because prayer changed
[58:17] things
[58:18] that's where god comes and anoints you
[58:20] that is your entrance into the holies of
[58:22] holies
[58:23] right there on your knees hallelujah
[58:27] hallelujah
[58:29] i'm trying to hold my peace
[58:33] right see when he was here on earth in
[58:36] his body the bride which is part of him
[58:39] doing the same things as husband and
[58:42] wife
[58:42] or king and queen just before the
[58:44] marriage ceremony
[58:46] i can remember the time when i proposed
[58:48] to my wife
[58:50] and there was about four or five sisters
[58:52] who claimed me as their husband
[58:57] i don't know where they got their vision
[58:58] from
[59:00] but it didn't come from god
[59:04] and they were mad with my wife because i
[59:07] chose her
[59:08] instead of them and you know what i'm
[59:11] going to be honest with you
[59:12] it never was in my mind to choose them
[59:15] but in their mind
[59:19] y'all understand me in their mind oh
[59:22] god to show me brother brooks is my
[59:24] husband
[59:27] yeah god didn't show me nothing of the
[59:30] sword
[59:34] i was looking for character and that's
[59:36] what i got
[59:43] you know we must understand that
[59:45] character is what's going to win for you
[59:48] it's not how much message you got or how
[59:52] you can remember the bible
[59:53] you understand me it's your character
[59:57] that's why you're being tried
[1:00:00] right now that's why people steps on
[1:00:04] your toes
[1:00:05] that's why they bump into you i'm
[1:00:08] speaking spiritually
[1:00:09] that's why you go through changes it is
[1:00:11] not from the sinners
[1:00:13] it's from people in the house
[1:00:18] brother adam said in the in the later
[1:00:20] church agent
[1:00:21] this is what i'm looking forward maybe
[1:00:23] i'm crazy but you know i'm looking
[1:00:24] forward to for this powerful
[1:00:26] demonstration i like whooping the devil
[1:00:29] i like it when i see satan defeated
[1:00:32] we pray for cancer we pray for different
[1:00:34] things and we've seen god heal
[1:00:37] we've seen god deliver i love it
[1:00:41] because i know it's jesus christ doing
[1:00:43] it
[1:00:45] i can't do anything but i do believe
[1:00:47] he's still the same yesterday today and
[1:00:49] forever
[1:00:51] he says after a short and powerful
[1:00:53] demonstration of the spirit
[1:00:55] this little haunted and persecuted group
[1:00:58] will go to be
[1:00:58] with jesus i don't know one woman
[1:01:03] i don't know one young lady that when
[1:01:05] her husband give her a rock
[1:01:08] she's to hide it
[1:01:12] you know what she does the first thing
[1:01:14] she called on
[1:01:15] is her girls i don't know if that what
[1:01:18] finger that is
[1:01:21] but she makes sure they can see the big
[1:01:24] rock
[1:01:25] you know what i'm saying she'll even act
[1:01:27] differently she'll be acting like oh
[1:01:31] just to show her rock just to show who
[1:01:34] she belongs to
[1:01:37] and that's how we're supposed to be
[1:01:39] we're supposed to shine
[1:01:41] the diamond of god that the world can
[1:01:44] see who we belong to
[1:01:46] we're not ashamed of our husband
[1:01:50] hallelujah brother brandon said
[1:01:53] we feel like we're going through a great
[1:01:54] time of distress and trials
[1:01:57] perplexity of this time and distress
[1:01:59] between the nations and all kinds of
[1:02:01] things happening and
[1:02:02] sometimes i get engulfed like where ever
[1:02:06] ever where i look is like in a ship
[1:02:09] out on the sea and i've been given
[1:02:13] charge of the boat and how we
[1:02:16] going to make it that's what he said and
[1:02:18] how we're going to make it
[1:02:20] and here comes me one with a white cap
[1:02:23] hundred times bigger than my ship but
[1:02:25] we'll crest them
[1:02:26] everyone we are more than victors
[1:02:29] through him
[1:02:30] the captain and the chief captain has
[1:02:33] caught a hold
[1:02:34] of the string on on on the end of the
[1:02:37] ship
[1:02:37] he's pulling us through he says we'll
[1:02:40] crest
[1:02:41] every one of them now he's talking about
[1:02:44] holy ghost feel people now
[1:02:48] right he's not talking about a peter
[1:02:50] who's not converted yet
[1:02:54] and that's the truth peter could not
[1:02:56] stand the test
[1:02:58] while he was unconverted but once he
[1:03:01] became converted
[1:03:02] he became a powerhouse
[1:03:06] just another word of encouragement he
[1:03:08] says now the stabilizers
[1:03:09] have been put on the ship now you got to
[1:03:12] understand
[1:03:13] the prophet of god is speaking something
[1:03:15] to him and he's not just
[1:03:17] wasting words god is not idle
[1:03:20] god don't use idol words and now he's
[1:03:22] speaking something so you can understand
[1:03:24] he said that that the way he saw was was
[1:03:27] was one of the greatest waves a hundred
[1:03:30] times
[1:03:31] bigger y'all understand what he's saying
[1:03:34] this test that's coming it's gonna be
[1:03:36] great
[1:03:38] but if you trust in the word you'll
[1:03:40] crest every one of them
[1:03:43] now the stabilizer has been put on the
[1:03:44] ship great fearful waves
[1:03:46] are out here before us but we know just
[1:03:50] beyond that wave yonder
[1:03:52] we're nearing the shore in other words
[1:03:55] if they're coming a great way but just
[1:03:57] after the wave
[1:03:59] oh my god see we're nearing the show
[1:04:01] just stay stable
[1:04:03] just stay in the word stay with god no
[1:04:06] matter how you feel
[1:04:07] what anything else stay right with the
[1:04:10] word
[1:04:11] let it stay stable when you are
[1:04:15] all these great big old clouds around us
[1:04:18] storms coming atomic bombs and
[1:04:21] everything else
[1:04:22] they're talking about it but our
[1:04:24] stabilizer is right
[1:04:26] straight in the word god said it would
[1:04:29] be there
[1:04:30] here we'll crush every one of them yeah
[1:04:32] we'll go
[1:04:33] right over the top of them yes indeed
[1:04:36] they they can't sink us
[1:04:41] that's what i like they can't sink us
[1:04:43] why you're predestinated to stay afloat
[1:04:47] it doesn't mean amen that you're not
[1:04:49] going to go through the battles but
[1:04:51] they're coming and this is what i'm
[1:04:52] trying to tell
[1:04:53] i told a brother the other day i said
[1:04:54] let me he i said brother i said i really
[1:04:57] think the next move
[1:04:58] for all the bride is is persecution i
[1:05:00] said because
[1:05:01] i could see everything moving in that
[1:05:03] direction he said well what about peace
[1:05:05] and safety i said well
[1:05:06] we have someone in the office now that
[1:05:08] can bring the jews and the gentiles
[1:05:09] together
[1:05:11] oh yeah in a matter of time
[1:05:15] he can bring them together and if that's
[1:05:17] what it means peace and safety
[1:05:19] let me ask you a question after this
[1:05:21] coronavirus after all of this
[1:05:23] what would be a more perfect time
[1:05:29] for the unit for the for the whole of
[1:05:30] the world
[1:05:32] gathering together and say now we've got
[1:05:34] the formula
[1:05:36] peace and safety y'all understand me
[1:05:40] you can you see the bill up because
[1:05:42] every right
[1:05:43] right now people are frustrated people
[1:05:45] are losing their minds
[1:05:47] the suicide rate has increased young
[1:05:50] people are losing their mind they can't
[1:05:51] hardly take the pressure
[1:05:53] uh social distance and all of that but
[1:05:55] there's only one group of people
[1:05:58] that has a peace at mind and that's the
[1:06:00] bride of jesus christ
[1:06:02] hallelujah it does not matter what satan
[1:06:05] throws at us
[1:06:08] i'm anchored in jesus
[1:06:12] the storms of life i wait y'all
[1:06:15] understand me i mean god
[1:06:16] and when you anchored in jesus it
[1:06:19] doesn't mean the boat is not going to
[1:06:20] toss
[1:06:21] to and fro but you know you're steadfast
[1:06:26] you can't be uprooted let me ask you
[1:06:29] something why do you think you're still
[1:06:30] here
[1:06:31] with all of the things that are
[1:06:33] happening in the message
[1:06:35] people are leaving speaking evil but yet
[1:06:39] there's something
[1:06:40] that's anchored something you know
[1:06:43] that you know that you know you can't
[1:06:45] even explain it but you know that you
[1:06:47] know that you know
[1:06:47] you can't give it up because you know
[1:06:50] right nobody could ever convince you
[1:06:53] that one plus one is equal
[1:06:55] three because you know that one plus one
[1:06:59] equals two
[1:07:03] right and no matter how you wish it to
[1:07:04] be three it'll never be three
[1:07:06] at least not in our mathematical system
[1:07:11] so what i'm trying to say is that a lot
[1:07:13] of us possess stuff
[1:07:14] possess things this is what the message
[1:07:16] did for you the message has given you
[1:07:18] hope and faith and a lot of time we
[1:07:20] don't even know we got it
[1:07:22] you don't even know what you possess by
[1:07:24] eating this word this word has placed
[1:07:26] you in a position
[1:07:27] that you cannot help somebody you could
[1:07:29] never be deceived
[1:07:33] huh how can you be deceived with a
[1:07:36] message like this
[1:07:39] you know the correct baptism you know
[1:07:40] there's only one god
[1:07:42] and when they force you or try to force
[1:07:44] you to believe anything else
[1:07:46] like shadrach meshach and abednego i
[1:07:49] cannot
[1:07:50] bow am i making sense okay let's move on
[1:07:55] so we realized by god's grace he said
[1:07:57] that's just all there
[1:07:58] is to it there ain't no way in the world
[1:08:01] to keep it down
[1:08:03] there we'll crest every one of them
[1:08:05] because our great captain
[1:08:07] is calling at the other side
[1:08:10] now i i you know how many y'all have
[1:08:12] ever seen those swarms of birds
[1:08:15] you ever seen birds that get together
[1:08:17] and and some going this way is like art
[1:08:19] like a painter
[1:08:20] paint you know he's painting something
[1:08:22] some go this way some go this way and
[1:08:24] all of a sudden they come like this and
[1:08:25] it's just
[1:08:26] absolutely beautiful and you'll never
[1:08:28] see one of them bumping to each other
[1:08:32] i've never seen any one of them drop out
[1:08:34] of the sky because he got out of the
[1:08:36] lane
[1:08:38] because all of those things are being
[1:08:39] orchestrated by god
[1:08:41] and whether we see it or not god is
[1:08:44] moving
[1:08:44] in the bride she's moving forward
[1:08:48] let me this is what i'm trying to tell
[1:08:49] you it doesn't well i ain't feeling
[1:08:51] nothing
[1:08:52] listen if you're not feeling nothing if
[1:08:53] there's not a pull in your life to get
[1:08:55] closer to god
[1:08:56] something's wrong i'm telling you
[1:09:00] something's wrong something's wrong
[1:09:04] and you need to pray i can't hardly
[1:09:06] sleep sometime
[1:09:07] thinking about jesus last night was one
[1:09:10] of those nights
[1:09:11] yeah i can't hardly sleep i'm thinking
[1:09:13] about the coming of the lord i'm
[1:09:14] thinking about the rapture
[1:09:15] i'm looking at myself and thinking oh my
[1:09:17] god do i have all the goods
[1:09:19] i'm preaching but i gotta have them all
[1:09:21] myself
[1:09:23] i gotta have it myself
[1:09:26] and i'm looking at all these things and
[1:09:27] i'm thinking to myself lord what is
[1:09:29] wrong with the people
[1:09:32] then brother branham preaches a message
[1:09:36] one in a million
[1:09:42] we'll look right at that and
[1:09:45] we'll think sometime that that could
[1:09:48] never be me
[1:09:52] the only way it could never be you is
[1:09:53] that you've made your call in an
[1:09:55] election
[1:09:55] sure amen
[1:09:59] so we come to a place by god's grace
[1:10:01] where there's wars and rumors of wars we
[1:10:03] see all of these things
[1:10:04] i'm coming to something just a moment
[1:10:06] see but we gotta understand
[1:10:08] you are in the scripture you just gotta
[1:10:11] find your identity in the word
[1:10:14] we know the shadows and the types amen
[1:10:17] but when god opened those seals
[1:10:19] another dimension was open it wasn't
[1:10:22] just now
[1:10:23] we're still in the same church there's
[1:10:24] no sign brother bannon said there must
[1:10:26] if it's a new message
[1:10:28] a messenger must bring a new message
[1:10:33] and every messenger comes at the end of
[1:10:35] the age so brother adam came at the end
[1:10:37] of the pentecostal age
[1:10:40] but at the end of that pentecostal age
[1:10:42] he also came in the beginning of a new
[1:10:44] one
[1:10:47] a age we call the bride age the age we
[1:10:49] call the capstone
[1:10:50] an age we call eternal and it is
[1:10:54] for those who are eternal
[1:10:57] and this bible has locked us in we would
[1:11:00] have
[1:11:00] never known about ruth
[1:11:04] naomi we would have never known
[1:11:08] hallelujah about boaz and all the rest
[1:11:11] of them
[1:11:12] we would have never known had not there
[1:11:14] been a prophet
[1:11:16] it was joseph's bread joseph's meal
[1:11:21] that's why the pentecostals in all can
[1:11:23] preach it
[1:11:24] because he left them a lot before they
[1:11:27] kicked him out
[1:11:30] huh yes what would you preach
[1:11:35] outside of this message if he was to
[1:11:36] leave it what is that nothing
[1:11:44] i'm just going to go where i left this
[1:11:47] part out last
[1:11:48] service
[1:11:52] one thing about the message right now
[1:11:54] and i know people
[1:11:56] are not seeing it but we're we are you
[1:11:59] know in a kind of like a age like judges
[1:12:01] because
[1:12:03] we don't have a prophet
[1:12:07] joseph is gone you understand what i
[1:12:09] mean
[1:12:10] moses is gone y'all understand what i'm
[1:12:13] saying
[1:12:14] now there's a word we have but
[1:12:16] understand israel had the same word
[1:12:19] joshua had and joshua had the same word
[1:12:22] moses had but when it comes to judges
[1:12:26] that you know if you read judges you
[1:12:28] find out there was a lot of
[1:12:29] crazy stuff going on and you know what
[1:12:32] it was
[1:12:33] that israel kept backsliding isn't that
[1:12:36] funny
[1:12:38] god will deliver you from something oh
[1:12:40] god deliver me and i promise you i'll go
[1:12:42] i walk
[1:12:43] right before you and he delivers you and
[1:12:45] there's just in a short period of time
[1:12:47] you return
[1:12:48] right back to the to the vomit that you
[1:12:50] threw up
[1:12:52] come on somebody it's the truth and
[1:12:56] israel was always returning back to that
[1:12:58] to her stuff
[1:13:01] how many times did god have to deliver
[1:13:03] them
[1:13:04] constantly delivered them constantly
[1:13:06] delivered them
[1:13:07] because there were times and i don't
[1:13:09] know where how god looked at it
[1:13:11] but every time they got into real
[1:13:13] trouble
[1:13:17] they called on god help me isn't that
[1:13:20] the way we do it
[1:13:22] we want god to help us because the devil
[1:13:24] is beating us up
[1:13:26] but at the same time we're not ready to
[1:13:28] repent
[1:13:30] we feel sorry because we're caught in a
[1:13:32] trap
[1:13:34] but once god releases from the trap amen
[1:13:37] we forget about who released us from the
[1:13:39] trap
[1:13:39] and how painful the trap was
[1:13:43] we do that why do we do that it just
[1:13:45] seemed to be human nature
[1:13:47] israel constantly constantly was was
[1:13:50] getting in trouble
[1:13:51] and y'all know it's the truth real
[1:13:54] judges
[1:13:56] little man by the name of sham god why
[1:13:57] do you think the philistines and all of
[1:13:59] these
[1:13:59] different countries were coming in and
[1:14:01] ravishing israel
[1:14:05] why do you think amen that every time
[1:14:06] they thought they had things going good
[1:14:08] here come these devils coming in amen
[1:14:11] and taking their stuff
[1:14:12] taking their wheat taking their children
[1:14:14] taking their goats kicking their sheep
[1:14:16] taking their cattle it meant everything
[1:14:18] that
[1:14:19] it seemed like they were going good like
[1:14:21] some of us
[1:14:24] look like you're going good financially
[1:14:25] here come the devil
[1:14:27] now sometimes it's just trials but
[1:14:29] sometimes it's sin
[1:14:34] hello but one thing and the thing that i
[1:14:38] love about this
[1:14:40] because i told you the last one of the
[1:14:41] last times i preached
[1:14:43] joshua when he came into the land it was
[1:14:45] no longer a one-man ministry
[1:14:49] the people were involved
[1:14:52] and in that involvement amen they not
[1:14:55] joshua
[1:14:56] they had to go and fight see that's how
[1:14:59] it is
[1:15:00] that's how it is in this church people
[1:15:03] think it is a
[1:15:03] it's a pastor's duty and you can't
[1:15:07] hardly get any kind of help
[1:15:10] because everybody comes like it's a
[1:15:12] one-man ministry it is not a one-man
[1:15:14] ministry
[1:15:15] the whole body here is supposed to
[1:15:18] function
[1:15:18] and work
[1:15:22] but we're coming here oh pastor gonna
[1:15:24] feed me pastor's gonna say something
[1:15:26] he's gonna either say something i like
[1:15:28] or he's gonna say something i don't like
[1:15:29] i don't know what it's gonna be but i'm
[1:15:31] gonna go up to
[1:15:31] church because i'm gonna be religious
[1:15:37] hallelujah now this is turning a
[1:15:39] different way than what i expected this
[1:15:40] morning but
[1:15:41] i'm a preacher just like he want me to
[1:15:43] because
[1:15:44] joshua he got the people together and
[1:15:46] and he and
[1:15:47] one of the things that he taught them
[1:15:49] was to learn
[1:15:51] how to listen to the voice and the
[1:15:52] commandment of god
[1:15:55] because remember in the wilderness their
[1:15:57] fathers amen didn't know how to listen
[1:16:00] and obey the commandment of god that's
[1:16:02] why they all died
[1:16:04] joshua gives them a test i want you to
[1:16:06] walk around jericho
[1:16:07] seven times and y'all know the story
[1:16:12] but everybody was involved all of the
[1:16:14] warriors like i said
[1:16:16] he never had one child or one woman or
[1:16:19] anybody that wasn't a warrior
[1:16:21] in that line because he needed somebody
[1:16:24] who was able to take commands
[1:16:27] whatever you do i don't want you to say
[1:16:29] one thing
[1:16:30] until that seventh day and on the
[1:16:32] seventh day we're gonna walk around
[1:16:34] jericho seven times and we're gonna
[1:16:35] shout
[1:16:38] we're gonna blow the horns and god will
[1:16:40] intervene this is what i'm talking about
[1:16:42] we must come back to a place with god
[1:16:45] until god
[1:16:46] intervenes you understand me we're not
[1:16:49] there yet
[1:16:51] we should be there the word is here but
[1:16:53] we got to have somebody who's going to
[1:16:55] believe the word
[1:16:56] somebody who's going to act upon the
[1:16:57] word somebody who's going to know
[1:16:59] this is right right because the old
[1:17:02] testament i get
[1:17:03] jealous of it because i see god come on
[1:17:06] the scene
[1:17:07] for people who did not even have amen
[1:17:10] the true sacrifice like we have
[1:17:15] is that right joshua comes in
[1:17:18] and god says listen i want you to walk
[1:17:20] around and did god do it yes
[1:17:23] the walls came falling down and they
[1:17:25] conquered jericho
[1:17:27] oh that was in as warriors went in and
[1:17:30] they slew all of the enemy
[1:17:32] i love that do you realize that the
[1:17:35] bible said if two or three are gathered
[1:17:37] in my name
[1:17:38] you could ask whatever you will just two
[1:17:41] or three
[1:17:42] he must have known the kind of condition
[1:17:44] that people were going to be in in this
[1:17:45] day
[1:17:47] if i could get two or three
[1:17:51] believing ask what you will and it shall
[1:17:54] be given
[1:17:58] think about it even in the old testament
[1:18:01] in the first chronicles when it came to
[1:18:02] david
[1:18:03] how how how saul david's people
[1:18:06] went to make saul uh went to
[1:18:09] witness to saw people to bring him over
[1:18:11] to make david king
[1:18:13] and basically that's the way we're
[1:18:14] supposed to be we're supposed to be out
[1:18:16] here witnessing and telling them listen
[1:18:19] saul is dead the denomination is dead
[1:18:22] god has departed from that
[1:18:23] but there is a message and there's a
[1:18:25] king that we're working with to be
[1:18:27] crowned
[1:18:29] first chroniclers 12 38 says all these
[1:18:31] men of war
[1:18:32] they could keep rank came with one
[1:18:35] perfect heart to hebron
[1:18:36] to make david king over all israel and
[1:18:39] all
[1:18:40] the rest also of israel were of one
[1:18:42] heart to make king
[1:18:44] and i thought oh god if we could just
[1:18:46] have one heart
[1:18:48] if we could just get people don't want
[1:18:49] to call it get them out of their selfish
[1:18:52] ways amen thinking that it's all about
[1:18:54] you it ain't all about you
[1:18:56] it's about us hallelujah god could not
[1:19:00] even outpour the holy ghost
[1:19:01] on that 120 until they got on one accord
[1:19:05] and you think he's going to do something
[1:19:06] differently no
[1:19:08] if the anointing isn't not in here you
[1:19:10] can't blame the preacher
[1:19:12] i think we need to look at each other
[1:19:14] look at ourselves
[1:19:15] what am i doing to make it great
[1:19:18] what am i doing to make the anointing
[1:19:21] come
[1:19:22] y'all understand me it's all of us will
[1:19:24] give an account before god
[1:19:27] amen what we have done with what he has
[1:19:29] given us
[1:19:30] you think you don't play a part you play
[1:19:32] a part and if you're not playing your
[1:19:34] part
[1:19:35] god will judge you for that
[1:19:39] hallelujah now i'm just going to talk
[1:19:41] about
[1:19:42] deborah for a little bit y'all know
[1:19:44] deborah
[1:19:46] some people call it deborah like i said
[1:19:50] i'm going through judges i talked about
[1:19:52] sham god
[1:19:52] how sham god was a judge as well maybe
[1:19:55] not a major but he was a hermione one
[1:19:57] and he looked at the land and he saw
[1:20:00] amen how the land was being devoured
[1:20:03] by the enemy and they were always coming
[1:20:06] to him
[1:20:07] you know destroying his stuff and sham
[1:20:10] god wasn't even a real warrior and this
[1:20:12] is the thing i love about judges
[1:20:13] because god takes nobody and makes them
[1:20:17] somebodies
[1:20:19] he takes the common people and he raised
[1:20:22] them up
[1:20:25] that's what i love about judges he he
[1:20:28] took
[1:20:28] failures failures like like samson
[1:20:31] people like samson
[1:20:32] he took people like that and
[1:20:36] made them something
[1:20:39] and if we could see that judge is
[1:20:42] exactly what god wants us to see
[1:20:44] we're living just like they did in the
[1:20:46] same kind of era
[1:20:48] amen because people are right
[1:20:50] everybody's right in their own eyes
[1:20:52] even though we got a message everybody's
[1:20:55] still right in their own eyes
[1:20:58] my revelation is greater than yours if
[1:21:00] you don't know this or you don't know
[1:21:02] that you're not in the message
[1:21:04] my what nonsense
[1:21:07] if you hear somebody say that i don't
[1:21:09] care how anointed he or she may be
[1:21:11] you know what you need to tell them you
[1:21:13] must be born again
[1:21:19] how are you going to say what you
[1:21:21] believe and let me tell you what
[1:21:23] we know by god's grace it ain't about
[1:21:26] you it's about him
[1:21:28] and i'm gonna tell you as a preacher you
[1:21:30] can study
[1:21:31] all you want to if god doesn't come and
[1:21:34] anoint those scriptures
[1:21:36] you'll just know nothing
[1:21:40] ain't no man this is not a man thing
[1:21:42] y'all understand what i'm trying to say
[1:21:44] it's about god and you
[1:21:48] i do not and this is the thing i'm
[1:21:50] talking about i do not want to get on my
[1:21:52] deathbed
[1:21:53] and realize that i'm not right
[1:21:59] what a horrifying experience i'd rather
[1:22:02] somebody take a gun and blow my brains
[1:22:03] out
[1:22:04] than to face god unrighteously
[1:22:09] you understand me i'd rather be lynched
[1:22:11] i'd rather be and feather whatever
[1:22:13] it takes
[1:22:15] i'd rather die like that and die holy
[1:22:20] than to die physically fit
[1:22:23] unholy you understand me let's move on
[1:22:26] because we need to see
[1:22:28] deborah and his deborah the word deborah
[1:22:30] means be
[1:22:34] i is you think what what does a b think
[1:22:37] about
[1:22:38] a b a b is a uh uh uh
[1:22:41] uh uh uh in animal whatever you want to
[1:22:44] call it
[1:22:45] uh uh but it it it organizes
[1:22:49] you know we see bees and we see bees
[1:22:51] they work together no bee work by
[1:22:53] themselves
[1:22:55] all bees work together and the bees work
[1:22:57] together to do what crown the queen
[1:23:04] and there are some things in that
[1:23:06] endeavor that you must understand that
[1:23:08] it's something about this book amen that
[1:23:10] a lot of people
[1:23:11] all of them all of the judges are
[1:23:13] speaking to us
[1:23:15] because we're now in a age william
[1:23:17] branham is gone
[1:23:18] the law the word is is here the holy
[1:23:21] ghost is here
[1:23:23] but it seems like people are now in it
[1:23:26] just like they're doing
[1:23:27] falling backwards and who are they
[1:23:30] worshiping
[1:23:32] baal and and moloch and you name it
[1:23:34] they're out there worshiping those
[1:23:36] devils
[1:23:38] under the umbrella of religion the very
[1:23:40] same thing israel did
[1:23:42] these people are doing a game
[1:23:45] somebody got to be raised up god gotta
[1:23:48] have somebody some voice
[1:23:50] because he said i never left my uh
[1:23:52] without a witness my people without a
[1:23:54] witness
[1:23:54] somebody but let me tell you something
[1:23:56] when a man begins to scream
[1:23:58] and holler at the people when when it
[1:24:00] comes to their wrongdoings they don't
[1:24:01] want to have nothing to do with it
[1:24:04] but that doesn't mean the man is not
[1:24:06] called
[1:24:07] we see people in this message all we
[1:24:09] have done is come to a place that we've
[1:24:11] learned a system and we don't even know
[1:24:12] nothing about god
[1:24:15] we can quote the scriptures but at the
[1:24:16] same time we don't know how to love one
[1:24:18] another
[1:24:21] you don't know nothing if you can't love
[1:24:23] one another you know
[1:24:25] nothing
[1:24:29] that is the very foundation
[1:24:33] of being a christian
[1:24:36] understand we are at a place why do you
[1:24:38] think we're called the bride of jesus
[1:24:39] christ it's called
[1:24:41] lady grace
[1:24:46] you can't even have grace if there is no
[1:24:48] love
[1:24:51] the feminine attributes of god is still
[1:24:54] god
[1:24:56] i told you that the last week we are the
[1:24:58] feminine attribute of god
[1:25:01] i showed you how he she she he
[1:25:05] walked through in the midst of the
[1:25:06] golden candlesticks which we already
[1:25:08] know
[1:25:09] but the question was asked by the family
[1:25:11] said is the bride of christ
[1:25:13] and the body of christ the same he said
[1:25:15] absolutely yes sir
[1:25:18] and this is what i'm saying i don't want
[1:25:20] theology
[1:25:22] theology won't get you anywhere
[1:25:26] knowing what he said won't do nothing
[1:25:29] for you
[1:25:29] until you do what he says
[1:25:33] to know the baptism in the name of jesus
[1:25:34] christ is right is not good for you if
[1:25:37] you don't obey it you got to put it in
[1:25:40] action
[1:25:43] you know that's what gideon says lord if
[1:25:46] you be with us where be all the miracles
[1:25:48] and you know what we have gotten so
[1:25:50] smart in the message
[1:25:51] till we don't even want miracles anymore
[1:25:55] we just want the word word word word
[1:25:58] and people don't understand the word
[1:26:00] word word word has never been dead it's
[1:26:02] a lie
[1:26:04] hallelujah it is a lie
[1:26:09] the true identification of the church
[1:26:14] those things must be y'all hear what i'm
[1:26:16] saying
[1:26:18] now you say oh brother brooks well we
[1:26:20] don't have none of that well don't you
[1:26:21] understand
[1:26:22] the bible we understand one thing amen
[1:26:24] that the word of god cannot come back
[1:26:26] forward at some point in time
[1:26:29] if you be god god will
[1:26:32] correct us
[1:26:36] he said also the bride of christ will
[1:26:38] have a ministry before the rapture
[1:26:41] and my question is if it's before the
[1:26:42] rapture when is that time
[1:26:45] and what is the ministry that's right
[1:26:47] that time is now
[1:26:49] the bible says the spirit and the bride
[1:26:51] says come
[1:26:53] right i'm talking about our destiny
[1:26:56] our destiny and i i don't know about you
[1:26:59] i believe i'm a king
[1:27:00] i believe i'm a priest i believe i'm the
[1:27:03] bride of christ
[1:27:04] hallelujah and i cannot settle for
[1:27:08] church entity
[1:27:11] it's dead been dead a long time ago
[1:27:15] and you're the only ones that can make
[1:27:16] the change i can't change it for you
[1:27:19] you have to change it there's got to be
[1:27:20] something in you that gets tired of this
[1:27:23] religious acting that we do
[1:27:27] that was pretty rough but deborah was
[1:27:30] hidden in the prophecies
[1:27:34] she was hidden in the book she's right
[1:27:35] in the book you know and i used to you
[1:27:37] know i know about deborah because
[1:27:39] all women preachers use is deborah
[1:27:45] they all use debra you know and so i've
[1:27:48] heard deborah for a long time
[1:27:49] but you know just to see where deborah
[1:27:51] is setting
[1:27:52] and you know because of time i'm not
[1:27:54] going to have uh uh
[1:27:55] uh be able to do all i want to do but
[1:27:58] brother bam goes on and says we need an
[1:28:00] old-fashioned revival that's what he
[1:28:03] said holy ghost revival amen
[1:28:06] trying to keep you to you to get excited
[1:28:09] i know you're not excited but brother
[1:28:11] that's the truth
[1:28:12] trying to get the point to you it's the
[1:28:15] truth
[1:28:16] it's what we need he said oh i'm looking
[1:28:19] at this thing he said he's preaching to
[1:28:20] somebody he can't even get excited
[1:28:22] and that's how i do sometimes i preach
[1:28:24] and can't get nobody excited about just
[1:28:26] looking at me like i'm a show
[1:28:30] not everybody
[1:28:34] but my point is we understand where
[1:28:38] everybody sits by their behavior
[1:28:42] you either in the outer court
[1:28:45] the inner court are the holies of holies
[1:28:50] and your actions will always tell
[1:28:56] where you are
[1:29:00] your behavior because you can't fake it
[1:29:05] it must it must be real
[1:29:08] is that right see the holiness of jesus
[1:29:10] christ comes to what
[1:29:12] cover you but i thought i think to
[1:29:14] myself i said lord have mercy upon us
[1:29:17] amen we understand that god dwells in
[1:29:19] fire and if we don't come to church with
[1:29:21] fire
[1:29:22] what are we going to get
[1:29:26] the preacher's not up here for amusement
[1:29:28] folks
[1:29:29] he comes to hear tell you what thus says
[1:29:31] the lord
[1:29:33] he's here to tell you what god is
[1:29:35] thinking of you
[1:29:39] and understand we are in that ministry
[1:29:42] of judgment as i explained
[1:29:44] what judgment began first where at the
[1:29:47] house of god
[1:29:51] and as you've heard me say many times
[1:29:53] america would be america the beautiful
[1:29:55] if the church had only stayed on course
[1:29:59] but god doesn't judge the world until he
[1:30:01] first judged the church
[1:30:03] when the church goes wrong god judges
[1:30:06] the church
[1:30:06] and the world hallelujah
[1:30:10] braz has always been that sign of
[1:30:12] judgment
[1:30:14] is that right you and i must understand
[1:30:16] that here it was
[1:30:18] in the book of of of uh when it came
[1:30:20] comes to
[1:30:21] uh deborah
[1:30:26] and i'm not going to be much longer but
[1:30:28] one of the things i love about deborah
[1:30:29] is because
[1:30:31] you can't do what she did without an
[1:30:33] anointing
[1:30:36] and god anointed her
[1:30:43] but there was another thing that that
[1:30:44] took place and i guess i'll have to cut
[1:30:46] it short because of time
[1:30:47] there's another thing that endeavor took
[1:30:48] place
[1:30:55] when she called for barack
[1:30:58] it seems as if barack didn't want to do
[1:31:00] he seemed like he was kind of
[1:31:02] a little hesitant to to go after
[1:31:11] but we find out that in the midst of all
[1:31:15] and i want you to understand this here
[1:31:16] was he was this man
[1:31:18] i'm trying to think of his name right
[1:31:19] now and i thought i had it written down
[1:31:21] here but
[1:31:21] you know any he he he he he
[1:31:25] he come the captain of this uh host
[1:31:28] comes to do what
[1:31:29] he comes to destroy israel and i think
[1:31:30] he had 900
[1:31:32] iron chariots
[1:31:36] and his with israel little farmers
[1:31:40] didn't have much
[1:31:43] i think they had to get go against jabin
[1:31:48] and you got to understand by god's grace
[1:31:49] amen that
[1:31:51] let me bring it to the spiritual
[1:31:55] because you got to realize we're talking
[1:31:56] about a bride and her ministry
[1:32:00] and we're here amen to do what jesus
[1:32:04] didn't when i could say we're here to
[1:32:07] further his ministry
[1:32:11] and deborah was a judge and so are you
[1:32:15] you say how can that be remember i spoke
[1:32:17] the other day amen when the woman was
[1:32:19] caught in adultery here she was this
[1:32:20] lady
[1:32:21] amen who caught an adulterer and here
[1:32:22] was jesus standing there and he
[1:32:24] judged the whole situation and then he
[1:32:26] turned to her and says hey
[1:32:27] what do you think about it where are
[1:32:30] your accusers
[1:32:31] she says i have none she was the amen to
[1:32:34] the judge
[1:32:37] right and when when the seals were
[1:32:40] open what happened he came down not
[1:32:43] floating like a butterfly
[1:32:44] he came down amen as a man
[1:32:48] a warrior amen with a white wig a
[1:32:51] judge wig on his head put one foot on a
[1:32:55] land one on the sea
[1:32:56] that's the inspiration
[1:33:00] that's why the prophet of god was able
[1:33:01] to say i indict this generation
[1:33:05] i'm putting you amen under an indictment
[1:33:08] you've been judged and you've been found
[1:33:10] wanting
[1:33:12] then god amen cut her off
[1:33:16] now who's next who's
[1:33:19] next absolutely
[1:33:23] israel amen thought they had a good
[1:33:26] even when they were in egypt under
[1:33:28] slavery
[1:33:31] you never seen god come down judging
[1:33:33] them
[1:33:34] but once they got under the voice of a
[1:33:36] prophet
[1:33:37] once they were out of egypt now
[1:33:41] god comes not only to bring them out of
[1:33:43] egypt but to judge them as well
[1:33:46] is that right the bible said he god put
[1:33:48] them in the wilderness so that he could
[1:33:50] try
[1:33:51] their hearts so they could see what was
[1:33:54] in them
[1:33:55] israel was so messed up amen that all
[1:33:58] all
[1:33:58] that debra could get out of that 12
[1:34:01] tribe was
[1:34:02] two to help her fight
[1:34:05] and everybody else looking around and
[1:34:07] standing it's there
[1:34:09] it's there and we find out that that's
[1:34:13] exactly where it is now
[1:34:16] people want everybody else to work and
[1:34:17] they sit back and want to enjoy
[1:34:21] that's not the way it's supposed to be
[1:34:24] we're in this battle together
[1:34:26] hallelujah and so we come to a place
[1:34:31] amen that we find out that here was
[1:34:34] let me find those exact words i want to
[1:34:36] say so i won't be fumbling over here
[1:34:39] you love the lord hallelujah
[1:34:45] yeah that's what jabin amen you know he
[1:34:47] was basically the
[1:34:48] the captain of the israel and in in
[1:34:50] sasira was the the the captain of the
[1:34:53] the army amen y'all know how that works
[1:34:56] but anyway we find out amen that here it
[1:34:59] was
[1:35:01] they were coming to overthrow israel
[1:35:03] again
[1:35:06] and god inspires deborah now it has to
[1:35:09] be
[1:35:10] something that that that uh
[1:35:13] uh uh uh uh david know
[1:35:16] that that god is dealing with this woman
[1:35:21] because amen he he he consults he
[1:35:23] actually
[1:35:24] surrenders to her will
[1:35:28] and they go and they fight the battle
[1:35:30] now i want you to understand because
[1:35:31] you've got a battle to fight you got
[1:35:34] body
[1:35:34] soul and spirit right and you got a veil
[1:35:39] that keeps you away from the holies of
[1:35:41] holies
[1:35:47] but there must come an anointing
[1:35:50] to destroy the veil it's like 900
[1:35:54] chariots of iron
[1:35:57] and you can't do it on your own
[1:36:03] you can't do it on your own why
[1:36:07] because this man has kept you in prison
[1:36:12] for 20 years that's the way it was
[1:36:19] because see after joshua and after the
[1:36:21] different uh battles they they won
[1:36:23] through the other judges
[1:36:24] amen they have freedom i think it was
[1:36:26] like for 80 years
[1:36:29] but then at that end of the 80 guess
[1:36:31] what happens they began to fall away
[1:36:33] from god again and
[1:36:34] every time you fall away from god god is
[1:36:37] going to judge you
[1:36:38] understand that if you're truly a seed
[1:36:40] of god god is going to
[1:36:42] gut you and bring you back
[1:36:45] and if you've got any sense and that's
[1:36:48] the thing
[1:36:48] how do you think that you're going to
[1:36:50] love the world more than
[1:36:52] love god and god gonna sit down back
[1:36:54] there he says no
[1:36:55] not only that i'm a jealous god and my
[1:36:57] name is jealous
[1:37:02] hallelujah they have been enslaved for
[1:37:06] 20 years the devil working them over for
[1:37:08] 20 years i hope you're not like that
[1:37:11] i hope you're not allowing the devil to
[1:37:13] work you over and over
[1:37:14] with the same thing for years and years
[1:37:16] and years and years and years
[1:37:17] and god want to deliver you you know
[1:37:19] what you need to do you need to cry
[1:37:21] help
[1:37:25] am i making sense so you understand
[1:37:28] you're in the bible and the man that got
[1:37:31] you
[1:37:31] captive amen is the same devil that
[1:37:34] captain
[1:37:35] have had israel in captivity many times
[1:37:40] may have come in a different name but
[1:37:41] it's the same devil
[1:37:44] and you and i must understand in order
[1:37:46] to overcome this thing we need a deborah
[1:37:49] we need somebody anointed
[1:37:59] let me let me let me let me let me read
[1:38:02] something to you
[1:38:06] coming from the fifth chapter
[1:38:09] after deborah in in barack
[1:38:14] and all of them had defeated
[1:38:18] their enemy deborah began to sing a song
[1:38:22] and y'all know the story right
[1:38:24] let me let me pronounce that word sierra
[1:38:27] sierra
[1:38:28] sisiera amen who was the captain of the
[1:38:30] lord host
[1:38:31] he had they had chariots
[1:38:34] and here was a what two thousand or what
[1:38:37] it was ten thousand versus
[1:38:38] whatever but the point is israel
[1:38:42] whip them but you don't get it
[1:38:45] you see that israel won but you don't
[1:38:47] understand how did they win
[1:38:50] chariots of iron 900 that's just the
[1:38:53] chariots
[1:38:54] that's not even talking about the
[1:38:55] footman
[1:38:57] you're talking about a wave like brother
[1:38:59] brown said a giant wave coming your way
[1:39:05] and how in the world you're going to
[1:39:06] crest it now this is just in the natural
[1:39:08] but
[1:39:09] understand by the grace of god amen you
[1:39:11] have been
[1:39:12] ordained to defeat sierra
[1:39:17] the bible says you are
[1:39:21] and when this devil and that's what
[1:39:23] that's one thing about a king
[1:39:24] you never allow the king to escape
[1:39:28] that's why i saw amen samuel killed the
[1:39:30] king of
[1:39:32] when when when samuel when saul wouldn't
[1:39:34] kill him because you know what a king is
[1:39:36] he's a leader and a leader
[1:39:40] will always find followers
[1:39:43] he kills the king
[1:39:47] and says era amen he he fled
[1:39:50] amen he ran and guess what it was
[1:39:53] nothing but a setup
[1:39:56] because deborah had already told barack
[1:39:58] says listen you're gonna you're gonna
[1:39:59] win the battle
[1:40:00] but you're not gonna get any glory you
[1:40:02] know who he's gonna go to
[1:40:06] a little woman
[1:40:09] hello and you said well who does this
[1:40:12] woman represent
[1:40:14] first of all she wasn't an israelite she
[1:40:16] was a gentile
[1:40:20] and this sierra amen knew and of course
[1:40:24] they were friends of the of of uh this
[1:40:26] man and he runs to her thinking he's
[1:40:28] going to
[1:40:30] gain favor but she
[1:40:33] he didn't know that in this lady's heart
[1:40:36] she loved israel
[1:40:41] i'm bringing something i'm trying to try
[1:40:43] to bring it but the point is because i'm
[1:40:45] just moving fast
[1:40:47] the point is i mean she runs to and
[1:40:49] think about it
[1:40:51] he asks her for water and she gives him
[1:40:53] milk
[1:40:55] and you know what it was an ice cold it
[1:40:56] was probably warm and just enough to put
[1:40:59] him good
[1:41:00] put him down and make him sleep real
[1:41:02] well
[1:41:03] i love milk but i can't drink it but
[1:41:06] anyway
[1:41:07] and then she gives us his milk and he
[1:41:10] dies
[1:41:11] how he dies not from the milk
[1:41:15] this lady goes and she's get in the tent
[1:41:18] she goes out while he's asleep she
[1:41:20] doesn't allow
[1:41:20] him to sleep and she goes out and she
[1:41:23] takes a peg do y'all know how big
[1:41:25] a peg that holds a tent together how big
[1:41:27] it is
[1:41:28] do you realize how big it is she gets
[1:41:30] one of those
[1:41:32] nails and she gets that nail
[1:41:36] and she's quietly see that's what i'm
[1:41:38] saying
[1:41:39] silence is something else so much can be
[1:41:41] done in silence
[1:41:45] and she silently went over and she put
[1:41:48] that nail to his head
[1:41:49] oh my god what a way to die
[1:41:53] and she drills that thing boom
[1:41:58] how many of you could have done that
[1:42:05] as long as i knew it was the devil
[1:42:08] i could do it
[1:42:11] and she takes that nail and she drives
[1:42:13] it into his head
[1:42:20] here devil the prophetess has already
[1:42:22] prophesied a lady was going to
[1:42:24] get the victory
[1:42:27] but let me read this before i close out
[1:42:29] here this morning
[1:42:30] so that you can understand by god's
[1:42:32] grace you're right in the word
[1:42:34] devil represents the spiritual part
[1:42:37] the attributes of god
[1:42:41] she's the one amen that god has ordained
[1:42:43] for the hour
[1:42:45] and understand here she comes along
[1:42:47] because there's a secret
[1:42:48] behind the tent
[1:42:52] there's a secret amen that god amen has
[1:42:55] in store
[1:42:56] because here it was now the word of god
[1:42:59] is going out and god has anointed this
[1:43:01] little
[1:43:02] girl
[1:43:05] ja l has anointed her
[1:43:11] and joelle amen is a plural word
[1:43:15] because amen is ja which represents amen
[1:43:18] jehovah
[1:43:20] and l that represent elohim
[1:43:24] and really it's called yael the j is the
[1:43:27] y
[1:43:30] and this word means you know because
[1:43:33] here she was a god she was a priest
[1:43:37] and here was god putting the masculine
[1:43:40] and the feminine together
[1:43:41] amen and what happens she kills him
[1:43:47] don't you see what i'm saying
[1:43:50] she takes a nail and she drives it
[1:43:53] into his head is that right the bible
[1:43:57] says amen
[1:43:58] that this serpent will bruise our heel
[1:44:00] well we'll bruise his head
[1:44:04] and the pride of jesus christ is to do
[1:44:07] what right
[1:44:08] in this day bring to open shame
[1:44:11] the devil and all his tricks
[1:44:15] by way of a world of prophecy we will
[1:44:18] put the devil to shame
[1:44:20] absolutely
[1:44:26] because you and i have been ordained
[1:44:28] amen to drive the
[1:44:30] nail into his head
[1:44:35] hallelujah it's old brother books ain't
[1:44:37] nothing to that it is
[1:44:38] if you can see yourself in the scripture
[1:44:41] you'll see what i'm trying to say even
[1:44:42] if you don't get what i'm saying
[1:44:45] trying to tell you that you have a part
[1:44:47] in the scripture
[1:44:49] you're a little church you don't mean
[1:44:50] like nothing nothing nothing go on but
[1:44:52] listen
[1:44:53] at the same time god has ordained you
[1:44:57] to kill the enemy that have kept you in
[1:45:00] prison
[1:45:01] let's go to the spiritual aspect
[1:45:04] god has ordained you to destroy
[1:45:10] the sierra that's blocking you
[1:45:16] who have kept you prison for all these
[1:45:19] years
[1:45:21] you are ordained to kill him
[1:45:26] and the only way you can kill him is by
[1:45:28] the anointing
[1:45:31] let me read this quickly i'm sorry i
[1:45:33] just got off for a moment
[1:45:36] the fifth chapter then saying deborah
[1:45:40] in barack the son of benedict
[1:45:44] the day saying praise the lord for the
[1:45:46] evening israel when the people willingly
[1:45:48] offered
[1:45:49] themselves and that's the thing they
[1:45:51] willingly offered no grudges
[1:45:53] no will don't go fight hear o ki ye king
[1:45:55] and give ear o ye princess
[1:45:57] i even i will sing unto the lord and i
[1:46:00] will sing your praise to the lord god of
[1:46:02] israel
[1:46:02] you know one of the saddest things
[1:46:04] that's going to really
[1:46:05] strike people is when they realize
[1:46:11] when they realize when the time strikes
[1:46:15] it'll be like a woman uh
[1:46:19] going into labor suddenly it comes
[1:46:25] oh here you came give ear o ye princes i
[1:46:28] even i will sing unto the lord and i
[1:46:30] will
[1:46:30] sing praise to the lord god of israel
[1:46:33] lord when thou wenteth out of see air
[1:46:36] when thou marches out of the field of
[1:46:38] edom
[1:46:38] the earth trembled and the heavens
[1:46:40] dropped the clouds
[1:46:42] also dropped water so what was happening
[1:46:44] when they went to fight
[1:46:46] god helped in the fight not only did it
[1:46:50] the earthquake but it began to rain
[1:46:55] this is what they're singing about in
[1:46:58] other words
[1:46:59] people of god what you what you
[1:47:01] understand we're talking about the third
[1:47:03] pool
[1:47:04] brother brown says hey he said in this
[1:47:06] third pool he said i didn't have nothing
[1:47:08] he said jesus had a few fish and loaves
[1:47:10] of bread he had water he turned into
[1:47:13] wine
[1:47:13] he said but in this third pool he said i
[1:47:15] had nothing but the spoken word
[1:47:18] and at that spoken word that's when
[1:47:20] things were created
[1:47:22] y'all understand me it's when god anoint
[1:47:26] you to say something because
[1:47:27] no doubt deborah didn't understand how
[1:47:29] god was going to do it
[1:47:31] but do you really think those little bit
[1:47:33] of people could have destroyed those
[1:47:34] people without the help of god
[1:47:36] the earth shook it rained
[1:47:39] then the river overflowed
[1:47:43] it was the help of god and let me say it
[1:47:45] like this here we go through little
[1:47:46] things in our lives right now
[1:47:48] and don't even realize we are under the
[1:47:50] third pool and god could do the same
[1:47:52] thing for us
[1:47:55] nobody should have you in prison or have
[1:47:57] you in a cage
[1:47:58] anywhere if you really believe this word
[1:48:03] amen the bible said god has already made
[1:48:05] a way of escape
[1:48:11] i'm just going to stop there my point is
[1:48:14] this
[1:48:15] you you know as the people of god we're
[1:48:18] going to either get on or we're going to
[1:48:19] either get off in somewhere
[1:48:21] and let me tell y'all something so you
[1:48:22] can understand that i don't mean like
[1:48:24] i'm fussing my
[1:48:25] my point is is that
[1:48:28] only god knows god knows
[1:48:34] because we have come to a place when the
[1:48:35] word of god has become so
[1:48:37] common we don't feel it anymore
[1:48:43] that's like a man kissing his wife and
[1:48:45] she doesn't feel it anymore
[1:48:47] or a woman kissing her husband she
[1:48:49] doesn't feel it anymore
[1:48:51] it doesn't incite her it doesn't enthuse
[1:48:53] her it doesn't do nothing
[1:48:56] danger red light flashing
[1:49:01] and i know right now we think oh my god
[1:49:04] i think about it sometimes when the
[1:49:06] bible says maybe i'm too pentecostal
[1:49:08] maybe
[1:49:08] that's what's wrong with me i'm just i
[1:49:10] love the joy i love to see the joy i
[1:49:12] love to see people smile i love to see
[1:49:14] people happy i love to see god
[1:49:17] you know in battle i love to see it
[1:49:21] you know i look at places and you know
[1:49:23] we read all of these great things and
[1:49:25] i can't stand for this book just to be
[1:49:27] history
[1:49:28] it's got to be a now god right now god
[1:49:33] i love to see when god do things just
[1:49:35] the other day we pray for people and god
[1:49:37] healed them just like that
[1:49:39] things that i don't say about pull put
[1:49:41] all the time because i ain't trying to
[1:49:42] be nobody
[1:49:43] but i know who i am and when i see god
[1:49:46] moving moving and moving and listen
[1:49:50] am i struggling am i having battles you
[1:49:52] better believe it
[1:49:53] everybody ought to be having battles now
[1:49:55] and if you're not having battle
[1:49:56] something's wrong with you
[1:49:57] but there is no time to give up this
[1:50:00] ain't no season to give up this is the
[1:50:01] time to fight back
[1:50:03] you know sometimes you get tired of the
[1:50:04] bully right when you get tired of the
[1:50:06] bully what do you do
[1:50:08] you find a way to whoop him good that's
[1:50:10] all the bully need to know is that
[1:50:11] you're not afraid of him
[1:50:14] right that's what a bully is he's not
[1:50:16] but a bully
[1:50:17] i've seen him they could come big big
[1:50:19] big big but you know what i always tell
[1:50:21] people i said you know one thing about
[1:50:22] this place right here everybody
[1:50:26] has a weakness and if they're tall
[1:50:30] you go for the knees and if they fat you
[1:50:33] go for the stomach
[1:50:35] you find the weakness of your opponent
[1:50:38] right
[1:50:42] that's all i'm saying i'm not trying to
[1:50:45] teach y'all how to fight
[1:50:48] don't go out there and say pastor say i
[1:50:49] can get you
[1:50:52] my point is in this picture you find the
[1:50:55] weakness you go after the weakness of
[1:50:57] the individual
[1:50:58] because isn't that what devil does for
[1:51:00] us he see your weakness and he comes
[1:51:02] after it
[1:51:06] so what i'm trying to tell you people of
[1:51:07] god we've got to come to a place where
[1:51:12] service has to keep going up
[1:51:16] and it's not the preacher
[1:51:19] it's not the preacher it got to keep
[1:51:23] going
[1:51:23] up when you see it this way
[1:51:26] it shows that we're not in the holies of
[1:51:28] holies
[1:51:30] all of us are not there when it keeps
[1:51:33] going up and down like this
[1:51:36] something's wrong you're allowing your
[1:51:38] trials and your
[1:51:39] your things to get the best of you
[1:51:41] you're letting your job get the best of
[1:51:43] you
[1:51:44] you're letting listen i don't know
[1:51:46] nobody
[1:51:47] that had to work like william branham
[1:51:49] did
[1:51:50] and he never came to church
[1:51:54] without joy in his spirit
[1:51:59] and he had to preach over and over and
[1:52:02] over
[1:52:02] i would not have been able to do that in
[1:52:05] closing i remember the time i went to
[1:52:08] trinidad for the first time and i
[1:52:10] preached i think in some places four or
[1:52:11] five times
[1:52:12] four different places on one day i was
[1:52:14] so angry with the people
[1:52:19] i was i'm like i'm human i'm a man
[1:52:24] right i promise i'll never go back to
[1:52:27] that place
[1:52:27] those people don't have no they don't
[1:52:29] have no compassion on preachers they
[1:52:31] don't understand
[1:52:35] i never understood it and some people
[1:52:38] can do that
[1:52:39] and they can just keep going keep going
[1:52:41] and keep going but
[1:52:42] all i know is i thought this was being
[1:52:44] overworked and then when i hear brother
[1:52:46] branham talk
[1:52:47] it just puts me down like this
[1:52:50] to know that he went from place to place
[1:52:52] to place three service here four
[1:52:54] services
[1:52:55] just back out the back and you think too
[1:52:57] much think to yourself oh my god
[1:53:00] only god's anointing could have kept a
[1:53:03] man going that way
[1:53:06] or people of god i don't know i know
[1:53:10] maybe how can i say it
[1:53:14] my heart goes out not just for this
[1:53:16] church for everywhere everywhere
[1:53:17] everywhere
[1:53:18] i know how i fight every day i know the
[1:53:21] struggles i go through every day
[1:53:23] and and i know why i do but i'm gonna
[1:53:25] tell you something i
[1:53:26] fight for you as well as for me
[1:53:31] and all i'm saying is that we're coming
[1:53:32] to the we're coming i can feel it
[1:53:35] i don't claim myself to be a prophet but
[1:53:36] i know something's coming
[1:53:38] and i know that a lot of people are not
[1:53:40] prepared
[1:53:41] and that's the kind of a thing that's
[1:53:43] troubling me right now because i could
[1:53:45] see
[1:53:45] that people are not prepared there are
[1:53:47] some people who are not even
[1:53:49] thinking about the coming of the lord
[1:53:52] they're not even thinking about it and
[1:53:53] that's our message and you got people in
[1:53:55] the message who's not even thinking
[1:53:57] about the coming of the lord and when i
[1:53:58] can't stop thinking
[1:54:02] and i just think to myself you know one
[1:54:04] in a million he says
[1:54:06] one in a million he says i'm not going
[1:54:08] to make this a doctrine
[1:54:10] but he says one in a million and he says
[1:54:13] you got to say that i'm
[1:54:14] and listen it can't come from your
[1:54:16] intellectual building the
[1:54:18] ability it must come from your heart you
[1:54:20] love the lord
[1:54:22] well i trust somehow something was said
[1:54:24] and i'm not finished with this subject
[1:54:26] uh maybe maybe we'll we'll be able to
[1:54:29] explain it better later but
[1:54:30] my point is trying to get us to see that
[1:54:33] we're in this book and once we come to
[1:54:36] see ourselves in the book
[1:54:38] then in itself it it it'll change you
[1:54:42] because you got to know when the trial
[1:54:44] comes
[1:54:46] that you're victorious and if you don't
[1:54:49] realize
[1:54:50] the grace of god in your life
[1:54:53] because i'm gonna tell you something you
[1:54:54] can't see full grace until you get into
[1:54:57] his full presence
[1:54:59] y'all understand me in the holy place
[1:55:02] you know the candle lights goes out it
[1:55:04] gets smalled over
[1:55:06] but in the holies of holies that's a
[1:55:09] presence that you'll never forget
[1:55:11] it is a present that dwells with you
[1:55:13] forever
[1:55:15] and i'm just trying to tell you being
[1:55:17] your christians all these years that i
[1:55:19] have been
[1:55:20] it's not enough to say i've been a
[1:55:22] christian for a long time
[1:55:24] the only resting place is behind that
[1:55:26] veil
[1:55:28] and guess what you got a labor to get in
[1:55:31] there
[1:55:33] you love the lord let's stand
[1:55:40] you gotta fight fight who
[1:55:44] you your biggest enemy is you
[1:55:48] you got to fight yourself the dot deny
[1:55:51] yourself remember i said on the other
[1:55:52] day
[1:55:53] that that big old curtain that old
[1:55:55] badger skin represented
[1:55:58] man's will
[1:56:02] and nothing stronger than your will
[1:56:06] and you have to deal with that because
[1:56:08] many times we know the word but our will
[1:56:10] says no
[1:56:11] do something different
[1:56:14] [Music]
[1:56:19] must die it must rot uh in this last day
[1:56:22] i can
[1:56:23] [Music]
[1:56:25] i i see i see i see the word i
[1:56:30] i see things maybe in a different way
[1:56:33] and i don't know whether it's coming out
[1:56:34] in the way that i see it
[1:56:36] i understand people i'm not trying to
[1:56:38] make anybody
[1:56:40] feel bad i'm trying to encourage in the
[1:56:42] best way i know how i'm trying to shout
[1:56:44] and scream in the way i know and the way
[1:56:45] i see things
[1:56:46] [Music]
[1:56:49] because the bible said that it is it's
[1:56:51] god's will that none should perish
[1:56:53] [Music]
[1:56:55] now what is what will happen to you to
[1:56:57] an individual if they know this message
[1:56:59] and they find themselves left behind
[1:57:02] where do you go from there
[1:57:04] [Music]
[1:57:06] you know what the devil is going to
[1:57:07] first say you're not even saved
[1:57:10] no matter what you do you can't be saved
[1:57:12] so you might as well give up
[1:57:14] i don't know what it's going to be like
[1:57:15] for the foolish virgins i have no idea
[1:57:17] and god knows i don't ever want to know
[1:57:20] but it's going to be a hard time because
[1:57:23] if they had a hard
[1:57:24] time in an era where the anointing was
[1:57:28] to believe the word
[1:57:29] what kind of time they're going to have
[1:57:31] when the anointing was lifted
[1:57:34] i don't understand and honestly that is
[1:57:37] such a puzzle
[1:57:38] uh a mystery to me how they overcome
[1:57:42] is a mystery to me
[1:57:46] the venom talks about world war ii he
[1:57:48] said it'll be like a picnic this
[1:57:50] compared to what we're getting ready to
[1:57:53] go through
[1:57:54] and i know one thing in the army
[1:57:58] when you're in basic training you can
[1:58:01] tell the sergeant i'm tired all you want
[1:58:03] to and now all you do is when you say
[1:58:05] i'm tired he said give me five more
[1:58:09] he pushes you beyond your limit
[1:58:15] yeah and you don't eat when you want to
[1:58:18] eat
[1:58:18] you can't rest when you want to rest and
[1:58:20] one thing for certain you learn
[1:58:22] how to take orders and you do whatever
[1:58:25] he says and if you don't do what he says
[1:58:27] you get in trouble and you get the whole
[1:58:31] company of people in trouble as well
[1:58:35] and that's how it is in the church of
[1:58:36] god when we fall
[1:58:38] short any of us fall in short all of us
