certainty if the blood is applied he will pass over us we're just going to get right into the word of god thank you i feel like singing but i don't have much voice maybe after the service by god's grace after the preaching uh we uh had a wonderful time up in in the uh michigan camp meeting and i did a lot of screaming and a lot of holiday a lot of dancing and a lot of shouting and uh so it was really wonderful it was far more than uh why what i expected even the people said that they had not seen the move of god like that in a while so god was refreshing everybody there was such a love that god gave many people were filled with the holy ghost young and old uh those of you who don't believe in being slain there were some slain in the spirit and it was a wonderful wonderful wonderful meeting and i just wished everybody here was there that's all i could think about this church being there i just wish it wasn't possible but uh who knows maybe next year if the lord terry because i know that the news will go out i i know uh sister mckayla has a testimony but i don't want to take it from her whenever she feel led to tell us she can so we love the lord and uh we're going to ask that you turn with us to the book of revelations the third chapter we appreciate uh our visitors and those of us who are here we want to make sure that you make yourself comfortable i was telling somebody the other day i said i'm i'm i'm of that noisy crew i like to make a lot of noise when it comes to god uh you know and i know that uh earth is probably the quietest place of the three of hell in heaven we are more quiet here than any other of the other two they're screaming and hollering in hell and they're screaming and hollering in heaven amen so i hope and trust that the message will be a blessing to you i preached this message um there at the camp so it's kind of like a conglomeration of kind of pulling together of some things i have already dealt with and i trust by god grace should be a real blessing to you uh revelations the third chapter and then we're going to go from there to first corinthians the eighth chapter revelations the third chapter and we're going to read the 21st verse of that particular chapter we love the lord oh my god i tell you i don't know about anybody else but uh seeing the coming of the lord the way things are happening it has put me in such a desperation a frenzy however you want to put it because i realized that that the only ones who are going to make a rapture are those who have prepared themselves amen and a lot of people don't know how to prepare themselves and of course we can't do the work uh he does it but we must be aware of what needs to be done you know you can't tell a man to come fix your house and not tell him what needs to be fixed so we trust that somehow the word of god will search us tonight search our very hearts and maybe we'll be able to see some things that god needs to help us he is the builder you know he's the potter and we are the clay we want him to mold us and make us revelations 3 21 to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcome and am set down with my father in his throne he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches always good to see brother josh he's not only a friend and a brother but i don't know anybody that can fish like this guy fish love him we love the lord for it you know it's amazing uh first corinthians 8 6. you know when god pulls on your heart that means he's not through with you yet as long as there is a pull on your heart uh no matter what condition you may find yourself in we must always remember that this is not a message of law but a message of grace and as long as we can understand that we can keep moving forward it's a beautiful thing because the the headstone came down shouting grace grace so let us always keep grace because once you lean into the law god will respond to you in that way and that's not a good thing amen uh first corinthians 8 and 6 but unto us there is but one god the father of whom are all things and we are in him one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him how be it there is not there is not in every man that knowledge and i'm going to hold it right there there is not in every man that knowledge and if you read on down it tells you about how people find themselves worshiping idols and things of that nature because they lack the understanding of who they are and what they were created for let us pray heavenly father we come before you we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and your love we thank you for being so good to us father you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves there are no words in the english language that can express our gratitude but whatever we have to offer by way of praise and thanksgiving we give it to you tonight father because you're worthy of every praise bless the service lord by your grace and your mercy bless us forgive us of our sins our shortcomings anything we may have said or done throughout the day that haven't been pleasing in our sight we pray that you would cleanse us by the washing by the water of the word and father we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated i i titled this message from the sixth dimension to the seventh uh reason being we we we must understand that uh god has gone to prepare a place for us according to saint john 14. he said i go to prepare a place for you that where i am there you may be also if you don't mind we'll just turn there quickly saint john 14 we'll begin reading at the first verse there so that we can see exactly where where my thoughts are coming from let not your heart be troubled he believe in god believe also in me and what people did not understand is that the jewish people understood god they knew god was one they understood the god of abraham isaac and jacob because he wasn't in a physical body but when god came down to dwell in christ this was christ's uh message to his followers if you believe in god believe also in me and what was he telling them at that point in time he was telling him that god dwells in me you you this is not anything theology that you've had before but this is a real realistical point of view now this is what has happened in your day god dwells in me and he goes on to say in my father's house are many mentions so even to call god his father in the way that the jewish thought jewish people thought would have sound like blasphemy you know because when he said that that he was the son of god they really tried to kill it because the orthodox jews could not comprehend god in a man that was the mystery of god god in christ but the mystery of god now is christ in us you see so in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also and whether i go ye know and yeah and the way you know and that's the thing that really caught my attention when i was studying and looking through the scriptures the lord really blessed me to see you know when god receives you now understand we're working with a bride and a bridegroom is that correct because remember that's what john said john said you know when he likened jesus christ as the bridegroom and he said when the bridegroom comes then i must depart and get out of the way so we understand that what we're talking about is something that can be compatible male and female have you ever want to look at it but here he says i receive you unto myself and remember when jesus in saint john 14 you find out that jesus the only thing jesus asked the father was that lord let them be with me those who follow me those who believe in me let them be with me so you understand where this thing is all about god is talking about reunion and fellowship see we've come through genesis all the way to the book of revelation and right now we're living in the book of revelation the world knows nothing about it but god is preparing a place for us just like a woman when she has a baby or getting ready to have a baby she prepares the things that she knows that would be suitable for the baby if it's a boy she has the room painted blue blue clothes blue this blood whatever you know but prepare before the baby ever comes and get here there's a place already prepared so you got to understand this is what jesus was saying once we're born out of this world into the world to come there's a place that's already prepared he knows exactly what you like he knows what you need and you and i must understand this body we're talking about entering in because paul said if you destroyed this earthly body he said i have another one he said i have what we call a theophany i have a body that was not created by the hands of man right and and he said he said if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved god has prepared one for me already so we understand that there will be houses and mansions and everything but the greatest of all mansions is the housing that god is preparing for you which is a body amen okay because this body is an eternal body this is a body that we can't even fathom a body that has no pain no sicknesses no aches no nothing a place where there's no sorrow no no nothing that in that world to come there will be nothing that will remind us of this one will be no automobiles no cars no trains no planes no nothing that that that uh how would i say it uh nothing that the science has produced because remember science didn't come into focus or to view in view until after the fall so all of these creative things that we've seen you know musical instruments and all of that kind of stuff started in genesis after the fall but in heaven they didn't need any music instruments but anyway let's move on by the grace of god i'm trying to tell you something here and i want to say it in a nutshell we look at you know uh peter where it says about the nature of god and and add to your faith virtue knowledge and temperance and you must understand there's a building here and there's a building there there's a there's a person and a personality that is god is building in you that will be suited for the for the building he's prepared for you there you understand what i'm saying and so you must understand there's two pulls and there are two things that are working in this world today that's evil and good that which is of the devil and that which is of god and remember amen what brought us into this state of being is what we call evil what yes because we know we came by way of sex which started in an evil way right okay and you know that we came in with the nature of this world which is evil you don't have to teach a baby how to lie you don't have to teach a baby how to be jealous right you don't have to teach a baby how to steal because they are born with that nature which we call a fallen nature and it took jesus christ to come to die right to resurrect and to send back his nature which we call the holy ghost right and this nature is to take you and transform you in other words let's say it like this first of all you can't live again until you die and i mean naturally i mean spiritually you must die and rot to the old nature in which you were born in right because the bible says that when you put on christ you put on what a new creature that means a new creation all things old things are passed away god uh dealt with the tree of knowledge of good and evil for 6 000 years since the fall but jesus says in this day you've got to make the tree good or make it evil salt water and bitter water can't come out of the same fountain so we we must understand the importance of why god has us working or why god is working to build himself in us right the bible says like this paul said we need to grow up into christ right so therefore the nature that we're baptized with you're baptized when you get the holy ghost you're just a baby right but that baby must be formed that baby must it may be nurtured and the only way that baby is going to grow up healthy is that you feed it the right nourishment which is the word of god right because you know how it is when a woman is pregnant she may not in her natural self she may not like pickles and ice cream but when she get pregnant the baby needs whatever nourishment vitamins or whatever and she might find herself eating some of the strangest stuff ever like pickles and ice cream together and so but that is what the baby calls for and and you want that baby to be healthy this is where mothers fail because listen they worry about being fat when they should be more concerned about feeding the baby right because that baby knows what it needs and if you don't feed the baby while it's in the womb something will go wrong with that child even in the mental the mental part this is why some of the kids are just coming out the way they are because you know a.d.d and whatever they call it it's because the parents weren't feeding in the proper foods folks it makes a difference and this junk food really makes wild child children and that's what happens kids come out and you can't even control them because they hype with in their genetics by the foods you gave to them i'm not preaching just want to preach on that but my point is you are what you eat you must understand why it's important to feed to to eat the very word for your day because we're here to express jesus christ in a different way from the age before us in a better way we are to express christ and we're coming to a time in the fullness of christ where christ is pouring out his spirit in individuals to the brim we're no longer children we've come through luther we've come through wesley we've come through the pentecostals and now this is the capping off of the pyramid this is the maturing of god's bride this is why the bible says the bride made herself ready hallelujah and so you and i must understand evil nothing evil will go up when you die it doesn't change your character it only changes your dwelling place if you lived evil here whatever darkness in you will pull you down but if you have light in you it will take you up see and that's why it's so important listen the church world don't know how to prepare themselves because they say oh i'm a christian but they think they're christians because that's because they say they are christian it is not some kind of cliche it is it is a a being a transformed person the bible said they called the christians called them christian first and eria why they walk like christ they talk like christ they did miracles like christ everything jesus did they were doing and this is why i'm against systems because systems amen engages you it entraps you it's like a fish in a bowl you feed him but he's got nowhere to go it's like a parrot in a cage right oh you give him all the nourishments you give him all the things he needs to survive but he'll never know how to fly because he's still in the cage see that's what a system do it can give you a but the bible says he whom the son is set free is free indeed and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty just coming by way of paradoxical 64. he says now the father now dwells in us by his death he sanctified a church that absolutely the church the clean the unclean filthy see we once was that that's what we were but god condescending from a pill of fire down to a man and then the holy spirit that's right in us see this holy ghost is not just a shout it's not just a dance it's not just to speak in tongues or run up and down the aisle or you know what i mean no it comes to change you listen christianity is a way of change and it's little by little but is god working in you till you come to a place that you are in his very image his very likeness where you come to that place where jesus said if you say to this mountain be thou move it has to move it's in that place that we're not moving into where the word of god said whatsoever you say see we're not just uh uh what we call it uh uh facsimiles of christians we we're the real deal we're the the reality of of crisis death burial and resurrection we are to reflect him and not creeds and dogmas we are supposed to reflect him right you know it's like a drunk man i mean you see a drunk man staggering you know he's full of something right he ain't staggering off water right but it's whatever he's drinking that makes him act the way he acts and look the way he looks hallelujah so is it with a christian when you eating the word it will transform you it'll take the worldly desires out of you it will quit it would make you quit now you quit it it will make you quit right because as long as you say oh i'm giving up this and i'm giving out that most of the time you're going to go back to it hallelujah but when god takes it away that's what james said when god when he said when j james said when god removes that he's because we're understood you're you're only tempted when you're drawn away with your own lust enticed and enticed because god does not tempt any man hallelujah this seems just like a deja vu but i like those see he come down what from a pill of fire down to make a man and see what people don't understand when god came down to make a man he said and then the holy spirit right in us you see it's not enough to say oh i got the holy ghost and nobody can tell it it's evidence that something has happened right and you don't even have to broadcast it people will begin to see the change in you just by observing you listen we have an obligation to jesus christ himself and i'm gonna get to the dimensions in just a moment he said listen brother sisters you and i he says and and and in this this world that we live he says let's conduct ourselves as sons and daughters of god and most people don't even know what that means do you know first of all you'll never know how to consult how you how to conduct yourself as a son and daughter of god until you know who god is and what god is right how can you conduct yourself like god if you don't know the way he behaves right you remember the little story about the man amen in the snow and he had just come uh um from the uh the bar and he was going like this and he's going like this and he's going like this and and his son was behind him so his son was following his trail daddy went this way he went this way and the daddy looked around and said well what are you doing he said i'm following your footsteps that statement converted the man because he at that moment he found he saw what was happening his lifestyle was now influencing his son and eventually his son was going to become like him hallelujah if we can see the power of god and see the holiness of god and just mock god as he is whoo yes sir you love the lord listen but our behavior ought to be according to the commandments of god that we are sons and daughters of god listen our behavior we should act and do any and everything according to what the laws of god or god has laid down amen in other words god says don't lie don't lie god say don't steal don't steal right you say but listen that's works no no no no if you've got god in you god will obey his word amen it is you say you see what i'm saying because you and i understand now we know and you've heard me say that this this dimension that we're in of course it's the third dimension right do you know what is air light and things like that and then you got the four fifth and sixth and i just used to wonder how oh what was going on you know paul says listen whether i'm kind of quoting he says i i don't know whether i was in the body or out the body he said but i know a man that was caught up into the third heavens mathematically i couldn't figure it out until the other day oh yeah that's the sixth because everything else is earthbound hallelujah but you go all the way up now it's it's heavens i was caught up in the third heaven he said i saw things that was not lawful for me to see hallelujah you understand me in other words amen when you die when you this earthly tabernacle when this fades away what's ever in you will make its journey home you understand me wherever home is it's going to make its way and connect to wherever home is if you came from god and you the life of christ in you is in you you go up but if you're feeding on the things of the world the darkness of the world because remember the prophet god and the word said it like this if you love the world and the things of the world the love of god is not even in you you understand that he's not saying you're not a christian but he's saying the holy ghost is not in you because the holy ghost is the love of god god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life right this is what paul was saying it's no longer i that live but christ that lives in me that's what takes you up right the gates are not going to open for you if the character is not at the gate you understand what i'm saying the character of christ is the only thing that opens up the gate it was during the first resurrection when the old testament saints rose right and they said who who is this king of glory he said the lord mighty in battle he is the king of glory and the gates swung open and the old testament saint marched in right oh people of god so now we're at the same place but you see what what's so wonderful is this that whatever sin put oh how can i say it heaven and earth will be recreated you understand me why because of the sin that adam and eve did it loosed the devil and gave him a right to a sin because remember he was cast out he was earthbound but when aaron eve forfeited their rights it gave the devil rights and you know everywhere he goes he pollutes it becomes contaminated and so therefore god is going to have to renovate the heavens and the earth everything is going to be changed this world is going to be changed the atmosphere is going to be changed why because satan is the prince and power of the air he is the ruler when i heard somebody say you know if he's a prison powder we must be breathing in that ain't what he's talking about he's talking about that dimension he rules it he calls us the storms he causes the tornadoes and things of that nature and people say well how would god do that they only say it because they don't know that's not god i can prove it when jesus was and was he in the boat sleep and then and then the winds and the waves began to boast itself that wasn't god causing that storm the bible said jesus stood up on the realm of that boat said peace be still he rebuked the devils that was causing the storm so it's the devils that's in all of this stuff right so we understand amen that this dimension it was messed up this is let me say it like this whatever took place in genesis 1 and after that genesis 2 it caused the earth to be void that means amen something shook up the dimensions and then god began to reset the dimensions put things back in order and when he put things back in order the devil was bound he was kicked out of heaven so that means he couldn't be in the sixth he couldn't be nowhere but he was bound so he's walking around in the garden of eden trying to get back in and ascend back up and avon e broke it gave him the rights to it is that right he's a god of this age is that right he's the god of politics how did he get this when adam was made god of the earth god gave him the authority hallelujah but when he forfeited his rights satan became the authority and that's why he's ruling everything right now you say these people are crazy but they're being ruled by the devil all of the countries every nation amen in this world is now being ruled by him but know you not that his days are numbered hallelujah god is getting ready to tear his kingdom down hallelujah glory to god and what is he doing he's creating an army he's creating a bride um oh yeah that message speak to the mountain brother adams talks about what god is getting ready to do and what he's going to do with this bride with this church see it's a mystery because people think it's all over it's not all over and one thing for certain we will leave out of here victoriously hallelujah is that right we try out in christ it's not us but the god in us that causes us to triumph thanks be to god paul said that gives us the victory hallelujah and causes us to triumph i love that try out that needs to celebrate that's when we come to church we're supposed to celebrate don't come in here like some losers and old woes me and all that kind of stuff listen let me tell you what god came to save those well that was saveable right he didn't come to sale he didn't come to save the well those that didn't need a physician that he didn't come to save those he needed though he came to save those that needed help and i don't know about you but i needed help still need help i'll need help till i leave this place see we are made partakers listen it is not you did not just come to christ it was christ who came to you you you was lost he wasn't lost you were lost hallelujah now how are we going to get back to where we used to be because remember everybody that dies now that's in christ they only go to the sixth dimension hallelujah that means they're not complete amen yet because seven is complete and so they go there and they're waiting to come back and we're waiting to go up they want their natural bodies because when they're in the theophany they can't they they don't sleep they don't breathe they don't get tired they're in a body that we can't even comprehend hallelujah have you ever heard of a choir from heaven they don't even take a breath because understand now the breath of life was only given to us as men that's why when we die we give it back up but there they didn't need it in that dimension the breath of life was here but understand when this is over we'll be just like jesus [Laughter] but we are made partakers of his holiness see we're in his image we are living images of the living god hallelujah then dead to self this is what we're fighting to to do what die to ourselves you know what that means to die to your will so much so that god's will be done at all times lord destroy my will don't let it be what i got to do this and i got to do that no i want to do what you want me to do see when we come to that place to recognize that we are the final you know how it is in the race they put the best in the la the last right they put a fast with it first now don't get me wrong but that last runner in that relay he has a history because they want to put that fast one there so that if there's somebody that's already overtaken their group this guy can surpass them so god did what he saved the best for last hallelujah so understand it's not what we think we can do we must understand what we can do and the bible says whatsoever if you believe it you can have it is that right that's the truth you can have it whatsoever you believe you can have it it's yours listen as christians we've got all of these blessings i mean so many the bible said you know uh god has blessed us with all spiritual blessing all and we just take these little things and we praise the lord i'm blessed do you realize amen the depth of that it goes beyond amen what you and i think that's why the bible says that god jesus christ is able to bless us and to give us what we ask for above above whatever we ask or think so he's unlimited think about it your father who created the heavens and the earth decided to live in you is that right the old testament says don't think god is in heaven don't think he's far off somewhere in a far-off country the bible said he's naughty even in your mouth but without faith it's impossible to please him you can say a lot of things you can speak it but if your faith is not backing it up and faith is solid faith is not afraid faith is don't scare and faith never says no huh it goes for it even when every all obstacles and all odds are against it it stands on the word of god because it knows the word of god is god and it cannot fail how do you think you're gonna make a rapture if you don't even believe you can be translated or resurrected this is what we're doing now this is what the holy ghost is doing now he's working this miracle in you and you're the greatest of all miracles right oh it's the truth it's good to see blind eyes open it's good to see the lame walk it's good to see cancer healed it's good to see all of those things happen but the greatest miracle is christ in you hallelujah when you know that you know that you know that you have passed from death in the life you can't even explain it but you know it happened because you see the results of it hallelujah hallelujah right he's oh no now listen listen now the word made flesh again in us do you know what that means when the word was made flesh in christ everybody was able to see what it was even the pharisees says nicodemus came to jesus by night says rabbi we know you are you are a teacher that comes from god because no man can do these kind of things except god center that's what the bride is the bride is that that these the people you know who are literally living the word of god god in flesh and whatever he says they do it they don't do anything on their own but when he said pray they pray when he says amen say to this mountain be moving move if god says speak to this and speak to that you do it you don't question him he's your husband you just obey and see that's the problem we're disconnected because we're not consecrated you must become god's not going to give you what i just preached just now that doesn't come to people who are not consecrated you have to be consecrated huh sold out to god right you must have a relationship with him right god is not going to let you use him as an errand boy there must be a connection you love the lord so what we're talking about running from the moving from dimensions to you heard me preach about elijah and elijah the bible says you know everybody says i'm just preaching so i'm off on those so elijah says oh oh uh uh elisha says lord you know give me a uh give me a double portion right you know how the story go and i said that's a hard thing but if you see me go up i'll give it to you now watch this because the bible talks about a fire and a whirlwind and a chariot and every painting in every drawing we see amen a world uh where our fire uh a chariot in a whirlwind with fire but if you pay attention to the scripture the bible said it was the whirlwind that separated the two and understand the chariot of fire and the fire represents god and god in the whirlwind is that right because that's what elijah said i've seen you in the thunder i've seen you in the whirlwind i've seen you in the earthquake i've seen you in different things but now you come to me in what a small still voice so god comes in the way that he chooses to come but understand it was the whirlwind that took him up and what did he see he saw a portal he saw the way out of here you understand me elisha saw elijah get out of here he saw dimensional change you hear me he didn't say well he just floated all the way up and he just disappeared no it's like enoch who had the key he walked with god and the bible said he pleased god how did he please god he must have been tried and tested just like we are because the prophet god said that enoch is a type of the bride and so he had to move from virtue of faith and knowledge and tempers and godliness all the way up the same character otherwise he wouldn't have been able to get in no unclean thing will go into this city it doesn't matter how long you've been a christian you might have to you know at the rapture we're talking about rapture now you might get in afterwards hallelujah but you're going to have to be purged you don't want to go to the white throne judgment or if i miss the rapture i'll take my chance oh no i don't want to take no chances hallelujah oh my you don't even know what how holy he is glory to god you know what i'm saying what we call holy that's just this perverted thing that we see but god is far more holier than you can imagine hallelujah he's so holy those angels who's never sinned before has to cover their faces where will you stand as a sinner amen may god help us and let the holy spirit work on us we need these these the dark every dark speck in us we need it out because jesus said amen there is no darkness in me hallelujah and so therefore we in this day we don't have much time that's the thing the time is far spent and the bible says you and i must redeem the time you know what i mean all that time we've been idle all that time we've misused god time for the crazy things of the world we need to be taking that time and says oh god make me desperate put me in a place amen that you mattered and only you that's where we are because the foolish virgins missed the rapture because she was dollatory she was lazy you can't be lazy christians right now and if you are you need to ask god to take that spirit off oh i know you think i'm a holy role and of course maybe i am but oh brother do you see it triumph over every denomination triumph over all paganism a living god made manifest in a living temple and the word of god which is god is made flesh in you let me tell you the greatest idol that you have to overcome is yourself because anytime you put yourself before god you becomes an idol anything make no difference whether it's your wife your husband your children no matter what it is if you put them before god they have become your idol but you got to understand that the least the least of his believers no matter how long and how long or who little or how little whatever you are the least of his believer in him has all evil under them so i'm helping you here because right now you might be thinking about how bad you are but understand you got to be you got to realize you're under the blood right we're saved by grace so let me say it like this even if you're the foot you're the feet of jesus you still above the devil if you just the skin of the feet the devil is still under you right and so you must understand amen your position is higher than the devil so you don't allow him to bring you down i understand we're condescending we're not descending we're going up you say well what do you mean remember the preview of the bride as she marched she was marching and began to go upward this is what's happening to us now we're going upward you say what what do you mean because the character of christ is taking us upward and the more we the closer we get to perfection the closer we get to that dimension oh wait a minute now the prophet god was laying on the bed around 50 or so he was and he said my i haven't done nothing for god if i don't get up and do something and i'm thinking to myself if he didn't do anything for the lord then where is going to put me and won millions of souls to jesus christ and man i have to think about it when it comes to counting and he said all of a sudden he felt this little funny feeling and he found himself in that sixth dimension because the angel that spoke to him said no this is under the altar which is the sixth dimension he saw all of these people he says ah all these branhams he says no no no no no these are your converts to jesus christ hallelujah y'all remember the story of the old woman and she comes when she was 97 years old when you led her to christ and she was one of the most beautiful women there y'all understand me so what are you saying brother brooks i'm saying if you can fully understand time and dimension he was able to go into the future because on the bed he says i must have died but he wasn't dead hallelujah but he saw god took you said that ain't possible yes it is god took ezekiel and the bible said god lifted ezekiel up by the hairs of his head he saw cherubims and seraphims he saw angels and all kinds of stuff and then that was in that dimension can you imagine the people that how they thought he was totally insane when he came back and tried to share his experience think about it you know you say well what do you mean let me say it like this that dimension is real you say ah brother brooks let me ask you something i'ma bring it down to you because this is the truth how many of y'all can see radio waves anybody can see those television uh pictures that coming through here through by way of ether no but it's real has always been we as scientists have learned how to tap into it and bring it into a box that we can see it our today is somebody else's yesterday hallelujah but we can get on that television and we can go eternal on them [Laughter] right we can see in a dimension and a day that's already passed over there and now it's just coming to us and then the people a man that's a father on the east coast can see our day our hour when their day is in the morning and hours in the evening see that's the dimension scientists know that that's why they built that collider trying to break into another dimension the same thing they did in noah's day that caused the flood the same thing it was scientists that destroyed the earth and then they go up there amen in in uh in the north pole and and everything up there and they said well you know we found some willie mammoth with grass in their mouth and how did it get here i'll tell you how it got there there was an explosion and that explosion literally knocked the world out of orbit and it was an instant freeze and the world came back upside down so who's to say the north is south and the south is north y'all understand me you say what do you mean because of the anteluvian flood this is why we have continents before the flood came it was one land one mass but everything began to drift because of the water separating some going this way and it broke up the earth but god knew it hallelujah you understand me that's science but even in that day when they were so educated amen and so scientific god pulled one on them what do you mean he took a man who never went to astronautical uh a university of any kind and translated him amen hallelujah he took an old farmer by the name of noah and built a boat that was more powerful than the titanic amen god did it the same god that turned water into wine hallelujah the same man that raised lazarus from the dead they say he ain't alive i said you are a liar he is alive how do you know brother brother because he's living in me and the same things he did yesterday he's doing them today hallelujah say what do you say i've seen the dead rays i have naturally and spiritually hallelujah yes sir he said what do you mean let me tell you something when i was in lima ohio normally people don't even come to the communion y'all know how it is so we had baked a little piece of bread and then the church filled up folks from everywhere we well we didn't worry about the wine because we had enough of that we didn't have enough bread but i got sister karen and others who still living who saw that bread multiply so you can't tell me he's not doing it he's still doing it if he did it yesterday he can do it today how many of y'all have ever driven off of air your gas tank is empty the needle says it's empty and you're still driving i can tell you things y'all might think i'm crazy but i'm gonna tell you to tell you this anyway one time i was trapped and i was so tired i really wanted to sleep and i know i could knew i couldn't and all of a sudden my my van lifted you don't have to believe it i literally looked down it lifted and took me all the way home and we got home faster that's all i'm saying you don't have to believe that but but god knows i'm telling you the way i saw it and and i'm telling you the truth the way i see it hallelujah glory to god oh my goodness i i wish i had a witness here because the one woman that i she's deceased already and i needed some money and it was an important not a whole lot of money you know i needed some money and all of a sudden i wasn't even in the message i was in an apostolic church all of a sudden i saw this light in the corner and this corner went that light came this way and began to roll and roll and roll and when it came to boom there it was the amount of money i needed i picked it up scooped it up and did what i needed to do with it see what people don't understand god is not a system huh oh you said well what do you mean what about that auntie she wasn't even a part of nobody's church that we know of hallelujah but she was praying because her son amen had a venereal disease and he was dying and she prayed is that right yes and god broke her into a vision what is a vision nothing but a dimensional thing took her into the future and she stood at that gate waiting for the elijah is that right didn't know who he was didn't know his name but she saw him she saw him even carrying a briefcase and then when he didn't have the briefcase she said where's your briefcase he said i left it back there walked by the lady and she had been standing out there all morning had you on her back when he walked up he says how she says howdy parson he said how do you know i'm a person because god doesn't show me that's all i'm saying see when you consecrate yourself and get in tune with god god don't care who you are where you are god answer prayer but you got to be in a consecrated state you can't be like a loose loose like we are we've been that but people i'm telling you it is an urgency you and i we must do what we can do to be more consecrated that comes by prayer that comes by reading your word listening to your text whatever it takes and separating yourself from all unbelief only those kind is going to go in the rapture i'm telling you that's it and i'm praying lord have mercy every day i pray lord have mercy direct me lord have mercy when i falter lord have mercy right because i want to see every dark spot everything that's not like god i want to see that temperance and that patience and that right i had a brother preach that a little bit the other day up there and then he preached on temperance and everybody we had to hear it down lord have mercy because that's where the devil get most of us right with that temper you know we fly off the handle we get all upset and blow up listen that ain't jesus that ain't god that's making you do that and you know what whether the devil is in your spirit or outside on you on your right or left hand side it don't matter it doesn't matter because you just allowed him to break whatever god was trying to seal up now you got to start it all over god help us i know i preached i broke my watch i shouted too much i did i really did my watches can't take i that's why when i lost my other watch my other watch was the better watch but anything that the electricity can kill i kill it hey ain't god good see christ is the head of the body is that right and wherever the head is the body is with it you understand me now how many y'all believe y'all the body of christ if you believe you're the body of christ that means jesus will always be with you the prophet god said the when that scripture says that the angel of the lord in camp about you know it means what do you know that he he put stakes down yeah he doubt he never leaves you he's that man or that he's that spirit that you can't see but he's always there and he said the angels he said they all are camp you know what i mean that that means they circle you they encamp they know what you're doing they know what you're thinking and all of that oh god amen and they're always there for you but we don't use it we don't use the power that god has given us is that right and that's the way it was with elijah amen when the syrians were all around them and and and and and the servants of them were saying lord they're more of them than us elijah's knowing god says no it is not it's more of us than them that ever got nothing he has nothing on us we should never leave live a defeated life it's our choosing to do it because we fail to believe god's word hallelujah they are encamped they put they stay listen and nothing can come through you if you're under the blood satan can't come through the blood he can't do it so they are encamped about you ready for battle for your battle and elijah says lord open get hazel's eyes and then what did he see those fiery chariots they went from this world he opened the portal he saw he let him see what was in the other dimension not far from him but there that's what we fail to see it's not millions of miles away it's right here it's just spinning at a faster speed i'm almost done because you and i got to realize hey man we're getting ready to change dimension we say that song one of these mornings it won't be long they'll look for me and i'll be gone that's true hallelujah right and understand if you're not consecrated more than likely even if you saw the dead rays you wouldn't comprehend it because the many of them saw the dead raised when jesus raised from the dead and the graves were open the bible says many saw 500 i believe it was but how many showed up to the upper room you understand me they saw it but couldn't comprehend what it really was y'all understand me and if you're not consecrated that's why the bible says you've got to be careful you could be entertaining angels on the west you got to be mindful in the spiritual things but if you're all upset all the time and frustrated and everything that is not an atmosphere from heaven you got to rebuke that i'm talking to all of us we love just whether yesterday or whatever forgive me i i got a little upset and what it was the devil poor one because i i've been trying my best to pray first right but i had taught i had eve texted brother about a haircut that i had gotten to my grandson today and that's what the devil used me check the phone to see what he right so i did that i listened i always listen to her messages i mean when i say brother branham's message i listen every day something every day but but here i just i was listening to that and anyway there's a girl in my neighborhood who brings her dog by my house just to use the restroom in my yard and i'm irritated because she see me on the porch and she's smiling i don't care if you got a bag in your hand pull him on the other side these are my thoughts i'm just letting you know i i had to confess make it right but then my wife told me she had to pick up some stuff and all i could do is see this girl because i'm mowing the dog lawn in the back and i'm like she must have left because we was out of town i'm thinking she must have left her dog loose because what this doing in the backyard so the devil's working on me i wish i had a tape recorder so you could hear what i said and how i said what i said and then my wife said what you gonna do i said i'm gonna report that's after i calmed down it didn't stop their brothers and sisters after god had given me victory i confessed my wife and said lord forgive me see but god allowed that to happen to let me see exactly where my temper was you see it's not in line yet because see that's stupid those things shouldn't even bother you you understand what i'm saying i mean it's not that you don't notice it but it shouldn't get you upset and i was upset and it's hard for me to get upset it really is but when i do y'all so i'm trying to get that to a place where i'm completely dead and rot right till nothing moves me that's what i want then i go to my chiropractor and i'm telling him about the story and he says well yeah my neighbor get irritated with me because i take my dog and i'm like i said sir if i wanted to do that kind of stuff what people are doing with bags i'll get me a dog i haven't had about five of them already and i said then you fall in love with them and then they die i'm i said five or six dollars i can't do it no more so anyway i know i'm off the message but y'all forgive me i want to confess that to you because i want you to understand that all these little things remember solomon says it is the little foxes that spoil the vine don't tell me that the bird of blood of jesus christ cannot perfect him that's what we're saying if we're saying oh god i can't overcome you're saying that the blood of jesus christ is not powerful enough to correct that error and that's definitely a lie from the devil that is a lie oh you mean to tell me my god your god can hold the moon in place bring the sun up every day makes the birds sing and whatever song they're singing and you know all of these things everything is moving by the power of god and all of a sudden he comes to you and can't do nothing that's nonsense you mean to tell me god can raise a man jesus can raise a man from the dead that has been rotted four days dead four days and rotted bring him back about the grave with brand new skin and he can't heal you he can't deliver you he healed the leopards young i mean nose and fell off and hands off and whatever limb that was off and restored them back to normal you mean to tell me my god can't do see what it is we've allowed science to blind our minds with reasoning and processing you can't have processing with the word it comes by faith you believe god only believe and when you only believe all things are possible hallelujah what's going to happen to you when you get into a state and the doctors say i can't do no more because oh well i'm dying no when they can't do it i know the man who can listen no matter how little if you're a little washed woman if if you're just a a brother that don't have don't know his abc's and don't make any difference who you are you are in christ trump over all things and you and your authority is over every demon and every power that the devil has you're in christ you need to triumph you love the lord now i i got a lot more but i'm not going to i'm not going to go on because i feel like i've done enough enough let me read this one scripture and then i'm going to close because i want you to understand that we're not talking about a time nobody knows how the rapture is going to take place but we know one thing that will be changed from this mortal to immortality and we know that by god's grace when we see those those loved ones that's going on right they'll be here to be between 30 to 40 days is that right come on somebody that's the truth you know i was i i meant to list look up something i have to look it up later but nevertheless when it comes to god you must understand that we'll be missing and they won't know it so it can't be something that's so monumental that the world can see it ain't gonna be thousands of people and everybody's looking at them you understand me it's a secret catching away it's a way that people will never know we're gone and so when the tribulation period strikes they're gonna say i thought just like they thought in john the baptist day here was john the baptist preaching and some of his own disciples didn't even know he had the spirit of elijah because they said to jesus jesus we thought that before the tribulation come elijah would show up and jesus said but elijah has already come and they've done to him exactly what they wanted to do right and what they did not understand is that you understand what i'm saying elijah didn't have to pray for john the baptist didn't have to pray for the holy ghost he was born with it you understand me when he came out of his mother's womb he had god in him and jesus at the age of 33 is when the holy ghost came and fielded this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased to dwell in he was the word but his anointing came at his baptism y'all understand me and that anointing led him into the desert 40 days and 40 nights to be tempted of the devil there in the devil in the desert he whipped the devil hallelujah he whipped him in the lust of the flesh he whipped the last the pride of life right every three all three of them thus to the eye listen to the flesh and the proud of life he whooped the devil he became lord and he told the devil he says listen you worship the lord your god what are you saying i'm your god you worship me i'm not going to bow down and worship you right the word do not bow we don't bow to no circumstance we do not bow we control hallelujah is that that's not wrong to say that word god told adam in the beginning so do bring everything under your control you're the head of all of this hallelujah and jesus christ has brought us as john is with christ we are the head of our situation what we need to do is begin to pray seek god and see what he wants us to say concerning our situations whatever he says say it say it and move in faith with it that's what this message has come to do put the bride of jesus christ in her position so when he comes we'll move out of this dimension with him people is closer than what we think it's praying time it really is praying time and you know i look at a lot of people who are in the message and they think because i i know the message god sent the prophet that ain't it when that became the message hallelujah you got to go beyond that the message has always been jesus christ is that right john said listen i'm not even worthy of losing the shoe lashes him that come after me he's greater than i john whole ministry was to point to him brother manner's ministry was to point to him 1963 he pointed to him and said that's my lord and the word that came with that is unfolding constantly unfolding and the whole point is it's about you it is about you so you can see who you are and to see that you've been redeemed and you have been predestinated not to fall people of god we got is so good we don't know how good we got it i'm serious because when you really understand election and predestination it'll have you almost out of your mind screaming i scream all the time in my mind i really do if i was to really let it lose people say you know he's crazy yeah because i am you know i i realize my perfection is not me it's of him i came through every faith there was baptism i went to the methodist catholic apostolic you name it searching for god and one day i says lord where are you he says i'm in my word and when he said that things began to change and the message found me lester in the morning when i ride in the morning when i rise in the morning when i rise give me jesus give me jesus [Music] do you drink a lot of water okay so i'm
