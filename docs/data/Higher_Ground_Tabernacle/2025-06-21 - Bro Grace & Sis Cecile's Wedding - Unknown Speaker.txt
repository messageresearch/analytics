And many of you have heard the Isaac story. How Abraham Abraham told Eliza to go find a bride for his son. In doing so, Rebecca was came on the scene. Rebecca came on the scene. Most of us know the story. When she first met Eliza, she was a servant to him. Even as brother Brandham said, God works on both ends. And God had anointed her to not only give Elea the drink, but also to water the camels. There are great love stories throughout the Bible, but this is one of my favorites because we know that God works on both ends. And this was in a divine appointment. for both Rebecca and Isaac. We know the story when Rebecca saw Isaac love at first sight. [Music] And let us not forget Jacob who loved Rachel so dearly that he was willing to work 14 years for her. Amen. What a mighty God we serve. And now we have our brother Grace and our sister Cecile who is anointed with the same kind of love. There's only one love and that's God's love.
