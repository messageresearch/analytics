[5:54] with each other amen surely surely let
[5:58] us stand by the grace of God
[6:00] amen we're going to come from Matthew
[6:02] the 16th
[6:04] chapter as we were uh uh ministering
[6:07] here this morning my Lord my God not
[6:11] something that is just said but
[6:13] something that we must know and
[6:16] understand by the grace of God
[6:19] Amen we we we we you know there's a lot
[6:22] of people who who are Christians and
[6:25] mainly in their heads and more than in
[6:27] their hearts amen they they know him
[6:32] intellectually but you must know him uh
[6:35] as a as a person as God as your savior
[6:39] as Lord he must become you all in all
[6:43] and uh we're living at a time amen where
[6:46] people are falling away and uh
[6:49] Christianity has become just a fad it's
[6:52] not something that's real anymore but
[6:56] you know the Bible tells us that God
[6:58] never left himself with without a
[7:00] witness amen God has never left himself
[7:04] without a witness we're going to be
[7:07] coming as I said from Matthew the 16th
[7:11] chapter you love the Lord amen amen
[7:14] we'll try our best not to uh uh Bel long
[7:17] uh by the grace of
[7:20] God Matthew 16 we're going to uh begin
[7:24] reading at the 16th
[7:27] verse and Simon Peter answered and said
[7:32] Thou Art the
[7:33] Christ the son of the Living God and
[7:38] Jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[7:41] art thou Simon Bo Jonah for bless Flesh
[7:45] and Blood have not revealed it unto thee
[7:50] but my Father which is in heaven and I
[7:54] say unto thee that thou art Peter and
[7:58] upon this Rock I will build my church
[8:02] and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[8:05] against
[8:07] it and I will give thee unto thee the
[8:11] Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and
[8:14] whatsoever thou shallal bind on Earth
[8:17] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[8:20] thou shall loose on Earth shall be
[8:23] loosed in heaven then charge his
[8:26] disciples that they should tell no man
[8:30] that he was Jesus the Christ you love
[8:34] the Lord let us pray Heavenly Father God
[8:37] we come before you Lord as humbly as we
[8:39] know how we thank you for your grace and
[8:41] your mercy Lord we pray father that you
[8:44] would break the bread of life to us give
[8:46] our hearts and mind understanding Lord
[8:49] and we'll be careful to give you the
[8:51] praise Glory and Honor in Jesus Christ's
[8:54] name we pray amen you may be seated
[9:02] so we realize by the grace of God that
[9:04] Jesus Christ is not what we would say an
[9:08] organization
[9:10] denomination he is truly amen the divine
[9:13] revelation of who God
[9:16] is and when we speak of divine we must
[9:19] realize amen it is something that God
[9:21] must uh reveal to you that he must give
[9:25] you an understanding of who he actually
[9:28] is
[9:30] there are those of us amen who have come
[9:32] a mighty long way but yet there is a
[9:35] distance that we must still travel and
[9:38] by the grace of God we realize amen that
[9:41] God who started the work in us will
[9:42] finish it we're looking at this thing
[9:45] and and and we want to say by the grace
[9:48] of God as we said this morning it is not
[9:51] enough to to say Jesus or to know him
[9:54] according to the written word but he
[9:57] must become personal to you he must be a
[10:00] savior to you he must be a deliverer to
[10:02] you he must be one amen that you know
[10:05] that you know that you know as we said
[10:08] this morning amen those uh Old Testament
[10:11] Saints amen were not trusting God by
[10:14] chance but they knew who God was and is
[10:18] and they understood him as being God
[10:21] understand there's only one God and the
[10:24] Bible said that he's Lord of all is that
[10:27] all right amen the question question was
[10:29] given unto Peter because and we've heard
[10:32] these things before the question was
[10:34] given to him because there was a rumor
[10:36] there were sayings going out amen among
[10:39] the Jews about who Jesus was and you
[10:43] know some uh Jesus finally answer ask
[10:46] his disciples who do men say that I am
[10:49] I've heard that they Peter said some say
[10:52] that thou art uh Elias some say that you
[10:54] are Jeremiah some say one of the
[10:57] prophets and then Jesus said but I say
[11:00] unto you see and that question comes to
[11:03] each and every one of us you're
[11:05] followers of Christ and he's asking you
[11:08] the question tonight who do you say I am
[11:12] now remember he said uh thou uh the son
[11:15] of man who do you say the son of man am
[11:19] and that term son of man goes all the
[11:21] way back to the time of Ezekiel all the
[11:23] way back time to the prophets of old the
[11:26] word of the term son of man meant
[11:29] Prophet yes sir we know you're a prophet
[11:32] but I want to know what more what what
[11:35] are you more tell me who the son of man
[11:38] am and he said Thou Art the
[11:41] Christ watch that because Christ is the
[11:45] anointed one Thou Art the Christ the son
[11:49] of the Living God that meant that you're
[11:51] not only a prophet but you're the
[11:53] prophets God Amen you are a son of God
[11:57] you are God manifested In the Flesh and
[12:01] Jesus said I want you to understand this
[12:04] Flesh and Blood did not reveal this to
[12:06] you in other words you didn't learn this
[12:09] in a Theological Seminary you know your
[12:11] mom or your daddy didn't teach you these
[12:14] things but my father who's in heaven has
[12:17] revealed this unto
[12:19] you and then Jesus go on to
[12:22] say Upon This
[12:25] Rock and some people say well it's the
[12:27] rock of Peter some says it's the rock of
[12:31] Jesus but I want to say it's neither are
[12:34] it is the
[12:36] Revelation upon this Revelation Peter
[12:39] you your answer to my question upon this
[12:42] I will build my church in other words I
[12:44] will divinely reveal to my true
[12:47] followers those who are who I really am
[12:50] who I really who I
[12:52] am upon this
[12:55] Revelation I will build my church
[12:58] because if it was Peter we're in trouble
[13:02] Peter denied Jesus three
[13:04] times come on somebody now isn't it
[13:07] something Paul comes along and said we
[13:09] don't know Jesus anymore after the flesh
[13:12] so it wasn't the man Jesus it was the
[13:15] man it was the god that was in the man
[13:19] why the Bible said in him dwelt the
[13:21] fullness of the godhead bodily so is God
[13:25] the spirit that revealed himself to
[13:27] Peter who Jesus was at that day and Upon
[13:31] This Rock in other words it was the
[13:34] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[13:37] me y'all understand what he's saying now
[13:40] a lot of time the gates of hell is the
[13:41] clubs no it's not everybody that goes to
[13:44] the clubs and things like that know if
[13:46] they're caught there they know where
[13:47] they're
[13:49] headed amen don't get shy on me tonight
[13:53] amen where but it it's it's where people
[13:55] go thinking they're going to be saved
[14:00] H because there is no salvation in the
[14:04] church there's salvation only in the
[14:07] name of Jesus
[14:09] Christ churches are places we come to
[14:12] congregate Amen to come together as a
[14:15] party Hallelujah come on somebody but
[14:18] you as individuals you are the church
[14:21] yes sir amen it is your body that God
[14:24] chose to make his Temple the Bible said
[14:26] know ye not that the your temple is the
[14:28] temple of of
[14:30] God woo come on
[14:33] somebody now we look at this thing and
[14:36] you know we realize amen that the whole
[14:38] program the whole church is built upon
[14:40] divine revelation is that right the
[14:43] whole church the Bible tells us that
[14:45] Abraham forsook his Kindred he was
[14:48] following a God that had no
[14:50] name hello somebody so how did he know
[14:53] that the God he was following was really
[14:55] the true God he comes out of the land of
[14:58] ch here and in that land amen there was
[15:01] just Idol worshippers
[15:05] everywhere come on somebody how do you
[15:07] know you following the real one you got
[15:10] Buddha you got Allah you got Muhammad
[15:12] you got all of those other gods out
[15:14] there how do you know you're serving the
[15:17] true and living God Amen he's revealed
[15:21] it to you it's not something on the
[15:24] inside in the inside of your head but
[15:26] it's something on the inside of your
[15:28] heart amen well you know that could be
[15:31] psychology you can make yourself believe
[15:33] whatever you want to believe come on
[15:36] somebody but we realize amen amen that
[15:39] it is a chang
[15:42] life that vindicates there something
[15:45] else living inside of you beside
[15:49] you Glory Hallelujah something that
[15:52] change your Darkness into light
[15:55] something that changed your night into
[15:57] day am something that made your wrong
[16:01] right amen something that lives in you
[16:05] walks in you talks in you amen and
[16:09] possesses all that he promised that you
[16:12] would
[16:15] possess as we've heard the
[16:17] term
[16:19] before if you say that Beethoven is
[16:22] living in
[16:24] you and you can't play a
[16:27] lick on the piano
[16:30] then your testimony is not
[16:33] true because if be toan is living on the
[16:36] inside of you you would do the works of
[16:41] Beethoven you would be not only a a
[16:44] piano player but you will be a a
[16:46] composer of Music hello why because it's
[16:50] no longer you living but Beethoven
[16:52] living in you hello somebody so if
[16:55] Christ is living in you amen that's why
[16:59] he said the works that I do you shall do
[17:02] also why because I'll be living in you
[17:06] he said at that day you'll know that I'm
[17:08] in the Father the father's in me and I
[17:10] am in you there's no greater Revelation
[17:14] that an individual could ever have than
[17:16] that Jesus Christ is living in them or
[17:20] in you is that all right amen built upon
[17:24] divine revelation that's right Jesus
[17:27] said in Matthew 16 chapter flesh and
[17:30] blood has not revealed this unto you but
[17:32] my Father which is in heaven he has
[17:34] revealed this to you right come on
[17:37] somebody amen what is it is a revelation
[17:40] of who he was and Upon This Rock I build
[17:44] my church and the gates of hell can't
[17:47] Prevail against it the revelation of
[17:50] Jesus Christ in this hour Hallelujah not
[17:54] God
[17:56] yesterday in other words amen the reel
[17:58] ation of who God was and Noah's day
[18:00] won't help you God is not building the
[18:03] ark
[18:04] today Hallelujah the god that revealed
[18:07] himself even though it be the same God
[18:10] did not will not help you like he did
[18:13] amen the days of Moses god ain't asking
[18:16] you to put the blood on the door Post in
[18:17] the little anymore you're not coming out
[18:19] of that kind of an Egypt amen hallelujah
[18:23] it's still the blood of Christ not the
[18:26] blood of some other lamb but the true
[18:28] lamb of
[18:29] garden putting the blood on your
[18:32] doorpost of your heart amen is where God
[18:36] is asking you so not of a different hour
[18:40] what he was now the Bible express it it
[18:43] grows in it grow is growing in in his
[18:47] bride is that right to to the full
[18:50] statue and see this is where a lot of
[18:53] people are missing it they think as so
[18:56] many of us say well I'm just a s Save By
[19:01] Grace you better be better than you got
[19:03] to come better than that Hallelujah when
[19:05] you was a sinner saved by grace when you
[19:07] were saved amen hallelujah now you're no
[19:10] longer sinner CU you can't be a sinner
[19:12] and a
[19:13] saint you can't be righteous and
[19:15] unrighteous at the same time you can't
[19:17] be holy and Unholy at the same time the
[19:20] Bible said that Jesus Christ became our
[19:21] sin that we might become the
[19:23] righteousness of God I can accept him
[19:25] becoming my sin so therefore I must
[19:27] accept his
[19:30] righteousness wo come on somebody so now
[19:33] amen I am the righteousness of God you
[19:36] don't have to believe it but the Bible
[19:38] said the just shall live by faith amen
[19:40] amen hallelujah come on somebody so we
[19:43] realize by the grace of God with the
[19:46] bride is growing in into that full
[19:48] statue amen the virtues of God must be
[19:52] found in her now we're not talking and I
[19:56] have to be I have to be fully under so
[19:58] we're not talking because I said this
[20:00] morning everybody's got a
[20:04] Jesus every denomination every
[20:07] organization has a has a
[20:09] Jesus and that Jesus is based upon their
[20:14] Doctrine some cut him to pieces and says
[20:17] well he don't do the things he used to
[20:20] do no
[20:21] more the days of Miracles are passed
[20:24] come on y'all know what I'm talking
[20:25] about but that's somebody's Jesus they
[20:29] call on that Jesus right Paul said
[20:32] listen there come a many
[20:34] jesuses there was good be a lot of
[20:38] jesuses but he says I'm afraid you're
[20:41] not preaching the same Jesus I preach
[20:44] see so there is a scripture of Jesus
[20:47] that you and I must follow amen and
[20:50] according to Hebrews 138 he's the same
[20:53] yesterday today and forever he's a God
[20:56] that changes not Hallelujah
[20:59] now that's the Jesus you want to
[21:01] follow where you can have confidence in
[21:04] his word that whatever he did yesterday
[21:06] he'll do it
[21:07] today however he acted yesterday he'll
[21:10] act today that's the kind of Jesus you
[21:13] want to
[21:14] see Hallelujah not some Jesus that's
[21:17] been cut up by some theologians because
[21:20] they don't want to believe the whole
[21:21] word and the Bible said if you take one
[21:23] word out of it amen or you add one word
[21:27] to it he said the will be added to you
[21:29] and your name will be taken out of the
[21:31] Lamb's Book of Life y'all hear what I'm
[21:33] saying so you and I must recognize that
[21:36] you and I must stay with the word in
[21:39] order to see the real Jesus Christ now
[21:43] let's move on by the grace of God Amen
[21:46] because we're coming into the full
[21:47] statue of Christ you and I know amen we
[21:50] have heard many times amen people in the
[21:53] history don't even know what what what
[21:55] really went on and they can't understand
[21:57] how come the new Church Testament Church
[22:00] had to die they couldn't understand the
[22:03] the Dark
[22:04] Ages they can't understand amen how come
[22:08] amen this powerful Church on the day of
[22:10] Pentecost now has been scattered abroad
[22:13] and down in caves and you know running
[22:16] from the authorities and all of these
[22:18] kind of things they don't understand why
[22:20] many of them had that's why I sang that
[22:22] song where where is that old rugged
[22:24] Soldier you realize the cost amen of uh
[22:28] that it it it took for men to bring this
[22:30] Bible to us there was a time where
[22:33] sitting in such an audience like this
[22:35] preaching would have been unlawful it
[22:38] would have been a death sentence for you
[22:39] and I amen but God's grace hallelujah
[22:43] amen throughout the church ages God
[22:46] brought it made it possible for you and
[22:48] I to Feast on the word why because it's
[22:52] time for the real Jes Jesus Christ to be
[22:55] manifested again
[22:59] hello it's time for the real Jesus to be
[23:02] made manifested
[23:06] again so we look at this thing and you
[23:09] say well I'll say it like this the bride
[23:13] therefore the bride Amen in the Rapture
[23:15] will come forth and all of this has been
[23:18] pre-planned
[23:19] nothing is out of cadence nothing is out
[23:22] of order everything has been pre-planned
[23:24] did y'all y'all know that God by his
[23:30] omniscience and omnipresence you know
[23:33] and you know because he know all things
[23:36] he's everywhere y'all understand what I
[23:38] mean he's a being he's not something
[23:40] that's a myth he's not a a piece of
[23:42] cloud or something like that he is a
[23:44] person is that right and so you and I
[23:47] must recognize his authority over his
[23:52] word is that right it's always plead PL
[23:54] you think God didn't know amen God
[23:57] wasn't on Calvary amen men s being
[23:59] sacrificed hoping that somebody was
[24:01] going to believe in him but I hope
[24:03] somebody will believe this no ring in
[24:05] his hand no sir God knew exactly who
[24:08] would believe and who wouldn't believe
[24:11] the Bible tells us amen that he actually
[24:13] called 12 to be his disciples and he
[24:16] knew Judas was a devil he didn't say oh
[24:19] my God I didn't realize Judas was a
[24:21] devil he knew he was a devil sometime
[24:24] God has to call him Amen to fulfill his
[24:27] plan amen hello somebody you said what
[24:31] that can't be true it is true amen
[24:34] remember amen when when they Peter
[24:36] denied Jesus and that woman said hey you
[24:39] one of them how did she know she was in
[24:43] the mix she was part of
[24:46] it right she followed Jesus up to the
[24:49] point where God wanted her to follow so
[24:52] that at that time she could identify
[24:56] Peter right so those listen people when
[24:59] the pressure come you know where it's
[25:00] coming
[25:02] from now we look at this thing you say

[26:47] and his likeness Hallelujah that purpose

[30:47] even able to lose but he shall baptize
[30:49] you with the Holy Ghost and Fire and see
[30:53] the whole world in itself must go
[30:55] through the same cleansing process
[30:57] before Jesus ever steep foot on the
[30:59] Earth again it went through the water of
[31:02] justification it went through the
[31:03] sanctification of the blood of Jesus
[31:05] Christ and it must go through the fire
[31:08] baptism and you know this world going to
[31:10] be destroyed by

[31:51] happened amen and then it's just a part
[31:53] of maturing and then you began to
[31:55] appreciate the life so is it with a true
[31:57] born again believer amen you're born a
[32:00] baby in Christ you don't remain a baby

[32:12] what I would look like a big old baby
[32:15] with a big old head right all my parts

[32:27] character
[32:29] Hallelujah is that what the face does it
[32:31] Divine it it it define

[36:56] Never overcome anything in your life

[39:47] brethren then who is his Brethren

[40:24] human and if you're going to be reborn
[40:27] again again you must be born again then
[40:29] what are you born of born of the spirit
[40:33] of
[40:34] God that's why the Bible said you are a
[40:36] new
[40:37] creation old things are pass away and
[40:41] behold all things are come new now I'm
[40:43] working with some meat here now this
[40:44] ain't this ain't no milk cuz the just
[40:47] shall live by faith you can't reason
[40:49] this out you got to believe
[40:53] it and that's the Bible
[40:57] that's the Bible That's why Christians
[40:59] are so weak cuz they don't know who they
[41:04] are Hallelujah but those old Sanctified
[41:07] Holy Ghost F Christians at the gate of
[41:09] beautiful says Silver and Gold Have I
[41:12] None but such as I have give I Thee what
[41:15] were they giving they were imparting God
[41:18] to that
[41:21] man Hallelujah that's all I'm
[41:25] saying you know denomination or they not
[41:27] going to bring you that why because
[41:29] everybody want to be over everybody else
[41:31] y'all hear what I'm saying amen but
[41:33] we're a body and I'm going tell you
[41:35] something if I stop my toe my head going
[41:37] to say
[41:39] ow my toe is important to me come on if
[41:42] you don't think your toes are important
[41:43] let somebody cut them
[41:49] off you love the Lord all I'm doing is
[41:52] listen read the book of Acts Paul says
[41:55] in the book of Acts he said if is it not
[41:58] written that we are The Offspring of God
[42:02] that's in your Bible look up Offspring
[42:05] and find it in Acts is it not written
[42:09] even in your poets who say We Are The
[42:12] Offspring of
[42:14] God well hello I got eight
[42:20] offsprings and they all look
[42:23] human my I'm bringing a point I'm trying
[42:26] to get you to see that a Christian is
[42:29] not just Christ
[42:31] like it's Christ in the man that makes
[42:35] him like
[42:37] Christ it's the life of Jesus Christ
[42:40] what do you think the Holy Ghost is the
[42:42] bible say that Holy Ghost Jesus said it
[42:45] is good that I go away he said because
[42:47] when I go away the comforter will come
[42:50] he said the comforter whom my father was
[42:52] send in my name now watch Jesus said I
[42:55] came in my father's name name that God
[42:58] going to send The Confidant in the name
[43:00] that I'm in and my my father's name is
[43:02] Jesus and so mine must be and so my Holy
[43:06] Ghost come in all right y'all got it
[43:09] y'all got it now
[43:12] Hallelujah it was the same life that was
[43:14] in
[43:16] Jesus is that the word amen all I'm
[43:18] saying the Bible said if that same
[43:21] Spirit be in you that was also in Christ
[43:24] Jesus huh as it quickened his body
[43:27] raised him from the dead come on if the
[43:29] Same Spirit as it quickened his body and
[43:32] raised him from the dead it was also
[43:34] Quicken and raised you from where the
[43:36] dead but you got to have the same
[43:38] Spirit the same life which is God
[43:41] himself Oh My My My God is a spirit and
[43:45] you can't see him so God had to be a God
[43:47] in Mor he had to put on a mask he come
[43:50] down as a son
[43:54] Hallelujah Lord don't get me wrong a lot
[43:56] of people well he came down and saw that
[43:58] means that heaven was bankrupt Heaven
[44:00] could never be
[44:02] bankrupt Hallelujah and when Jesus was
[44:05] praying he wasn't praying to
[44:09] himself he was praying to God the Father
[44:13] hello now figure that one out so let me
[44:17] move on I'm having a good time I hope
[44:20] y'all are why because you can see the
[44:22] reality this thing is a reality it's the
[44:24] Bible is a new book it's not something
[44:26] that's his hisorical and you know we
[44:28] don't need men to go in there and say
[44:30] well I think this is what it is it
[44:32] interprets itself God Said Amen to
[44:36] knowah it's going to rain did it rain
[44:38] God said he was going to destroy Egypt
[44:40] did he do it sir now I'm going tell you
[44:42] I've been to Egypt and egyp hadn't
[44:43] gotten over it yet they still in chaos
[44:47] Hallelujah come
[44:48] on and then they're going to try to tell
[44:51] us that they don't have no record of
[44:53] Moses ever being there I said well you
[44:55] don't have I said to myself you don't
[44:56] have to have record I can see he's been
[44:58] and
[44:59] gone Hallelujah come on somebody my
[45:02] point is it's just like so many Jews
[45:05] believe that Jesus body was
[45:08] stolen and there are people who still
[45:10] believe that today now we know better
[45:13] why because he's revealed himself to you
[45:15] and
[45:17] I right but you still can't stop those
[45:20] who want to believe a
[45:22] lie is that all right so when it comes
[45:25] to who he is to you this is what I'm
[45:27] working with every trial you go through
[45:30] and come through is to vindicate to you
[45:32] who God is to you you must come to know
[45:36] who he is cuz when the test and trial
[45:38] come you must realize that the steps of
[45:41] a righteous man are ordered by God ain't
[45:43] nothing coming my way amen by
[45:47] coincidence and whatever it is I don't
[45:49] care how bad it is if I am the cause of
[45:52] it God's still going to work it toward
[45:54] my good amen amen
[45:57] oh Hallelujah let me let me move on by
[46:00] the grace of God you love the Lord St
[46:02] John 17
[46:06] please St John
[46:08] 17 beginning at the n9th
[46:17] verse God liken himself as Jehovah Eagle
[46:20] did y'all know that and if God is an
[46:22] eagle what does that make you Hallelujah
[46:26] and Eagles are the are the the top bird
[46:28] in the
[46:29] world right strong Birds their leaders
[46:32] conquer us you'll never seen a a a eagle
[46:34] with a Seely face he's always serious
[46:38] amen hallelujah why because he's about
[46:41] his father's business is that all right
[46:43] amen you take those Eagles amen they're
[46:45] able to fly and they are the only bird
[46:48] that can actually look the sun in the
[46:50] eye without going
[46:53] blind every other bird will break up and
[46:57] bus up and they can't even fly as high
[47:00] as an eagle y'all hear what I'm saying
[47:02] and a true Son of God can literally look
[47:05] the sun in the
[47:07] eye without going blind Hallelujah y'all
[47:10] better realize this because the word of
[47:12] God will either give you sight or it
[47:13] bring you to a
[47:17] blindness Hallelujah St John
[47:20] 17 you love God I hope you're being
[47:24] blessed amen I'm working with the divine
[47:27] revelation of Jesus Christ that's the
[47:29] subject message tonight divine
[47:31] revelation of Jesus Christ where is he
[47:35] today
[47:37] ah amen either amen praise the Lord
[47:41] that's where he's at he's in you amen
[47:45] amen I didn't know whether to give Adam
[47:46] that credit or whatnot but you know I
[47:49] thank God for his grace amen amen to
[47:53] know that we can truly identify where
[47:55] he's at the Bible say you you don't have
[47:57] to go to the east or the west or say
[47:59] over here in the desert and this and
[48:00] that no sir wherever the carcass is
[48:03] there will the Eagles be gathered
[48:04] Hallelujah wherever the bloody word is
[48:07] that's where the Eagles will be gathered
[48:10] Hallelujah they like fresh kill amen
[48:13] hallelujah so St John 17 amen beginning
[48:18] at the ninth verse he said I pray for
[48:20] them who is this Jesus Christ I pray not
[48:23] for the world but for them which thou
[48:25] has given me for they are thine now he
[48:28] said I pray for them who you give not
[48:31] the world I Pray For Those whom you've
[48:33] given me and all of mine are thine and
[48:37] thine are mine and I am
[48:39] glorified woo all that the father's
[48:44] given me can I say this there could be
[48:47] somebody that'll come up in life it's
[48:50] possible because they say everybody got
[48:52] to look alike and they can come up and
[48:55] say well I'm I'm your brother
[48:57] or I'm your son I mean or whatever but
[49:00] how would I be able to tell whether they
[49:03] are or
[49:04] Not by testing the
[49:09] blood right to see what DNA is
[49:12] there give it the blood test and then I
[49:15] can tell you whether you're mine or not
[49:18] now really I should know
[49:20] better but my point is that's how God
[49:24] knows whether you are here or Not by the
[49:29] DNA by the blood oh Lord why because we
[49:34] don't put blood on us but it it was
[49:38] never the chemistry that saved you it
[49:41] was the life that was in the
[49:44] blood see that's why the Lamb's blood
[49:47] couldn't save you all it could do was
[49:49] cover you why because a lamb's blood is
[49:52] not compatible to human blood so we need
[49:56] a human lamb
[49:59] amen oh my God Amen we needed a human
[50:03] lamb like I said amen we needed somebody
[50:05] who could interpret the
[50:08] painting Isaiah gave the the a painting
[50:11] you know he' be uh you know LED from
[50:13] Slaughter from Hall to Hall and you know
[50:16] with his stripes we heal he and but then
[50:19] John comes along and said there he is
[50:22] Behold the Lamb of God hallelujah what
[50:24] was he was an interpreter of the
[50:26] painting and that's how that's how God
[50:29] knows who you are by the
[50:32] blood hall right when I see the blood I
[50:36] pass over you it's not the chemistry now
[50:38] it's the life that's in the blood it's
[50:40] the holy spirit that was in that blood
[50:43] that comes back into you and it makes is
[50:47] compatible uh now he said I'm is that
[50:50] right in other words if my daddy I'm
[50:52] born I I'm take I took my daddy's DNA
[50:57] H he could have said to my mama that
[50:59] child ain't mine my mom said come on
[51:02] let's get a blood
[51:03] test right she didn't have to go through
[51:05] that but the point is amen if my blood
[51:09] test if I had a blood test and it came
[51:11] up exactly like his the LA say you pay
[51:14] up or get locked
[51:19] up y'all getting quiet on me but my
[51:22] point is it is the blood test and every
[51:26] everybody as I said earlier will have to
[51:30] go through the blood
[51:32] exam to see whether you be of God or not
[51:37] the Bible said the Lord knoweth them
[51:39] that are his woo so if there are those
[51:43] in the world Amen whose seeds were sown
[51:46] by the bad guy they're not
[51:53] Gods let's move on Amen all right let's
[51:56] jump to the 16 17th verse they are not
[51:59] of the world even as I am not of the
[52:03] world now if I am not of the world where
[52:06] did I come
[52:08] from where did you come from you
[52:11] said God said you're not of the
[52:15] world but where did you come from
[52:18] then I can tell
[52:21] you did you know you was in your mom and
[52:24] your dad your daddy's loans how many of
[52:26] y'all remember
[52:29] that you were
[52:35] there you were
[52:37] there you were there in your long in the
[52:40] Longs of your father and God blessed him
[52:44] with a a wonderful wife Amen to as a bed
[52:47] in ground and he brought forth the seed
[52:51] planted in her and you
[52:53] became the tree
[52:56] from the tree is that right amen so you
[53:01] understand this you either were in God
[53:04] in the beginning or you'll not be in the
[53:07] end in other words come on there's only
[53:11] certain seeds can come out of me
[53:15] one y'all hear what I'm saying amen I I
[53:19] I it is I'm trying to show you something
[53:22] here let's put it like this if if and
[53:25] I'm not God but if was and I was to have
[53:28] children I would have to find a bedding
[53:31] ground to bring forth children right and
[53:34] all the children that would be brought
[53:36] forth would be mine unless my wife slip
[53:42] up hello y'all know what I'm saying and
[53:46] brought forth something else right well
[53:49] that's something else ain't going to
[53:50] look like
[53:51] me it won't act like me why because it's
[53:55] not mine
[53:57] am but listen it is nothing but the
[54:00] truth I've seen people come up and me
[54:02] and my wife has had all these children
[54:04] and all of them practically grown and
[54:06] I've had people say you know what I
[54:08] don't know where they get that
[54:11] from yes you do the apple don't fall too
[54:14] far from the tree what it is sometime we
[54:17] forget we we weren't always
[54:22] saved and them children I see my
[54:24] children some act like my brother some
[54:26] act like my sisters some act like
[54:29] me but it's still in the tree line y'all
[54:33] hear what I'm saying so is it with the
[54:36] true sons of God there's only way to act
[54:38] like him amen oh come on I'm going
[54:42] Beyond where I wanted to go but I have
[54:44] to say it like this people say
[54:47] well my daddy had high blood pressure so
[54:52] it came to me did you ask for it
[54:57] it was a
[54:58] gift through your natural birth your
[55:01] Gene was weak because somebody else Gene
[55:05] was weak come on it was given to you
[55:07] even though you didn't want
[55:10] it now if your natural birth gives you
[55:13] gifts what about your spiritual
[55:17] amen come on somebody you're going to
[55:20] have to have something that look like
[55:22] God
[55:23] Amen hallu am I making sense
[55:27] you're going to have something that
[55:28] looks like him acts like him in some way
[55:32] so somebody will be able to identify you
[55:34] come on they always talk about oh I know
[55:38] you a Brooks man look at your head see
[55:40] cuz all my children got the same
[55:44] kind yeah they can't get away with it
[55:47] the head the
[55:51] nose whether they like it or not I gave
[55:54] it to them y am I making sense why y'all
[55:57] getting quiet on me am I going too long
[55:59] here let me move on let me move on okay
[56:01] let me move on by the grace of God just
[56:02] give me a few more minutes I'll be
[56:04] done verses
[56:06] 2226 I get car away I get under this
[56:08] anointing and I get all happy but listen
[56:12] and the glory which thou gavest me I
[56:13] have given them that they may be one
[56:15] even as we are one i in them thou in me
[56:19] that they may be made perfect in one and
[56:22] that the world may know that thou has
[56:24] sent me and has love them as thou has
[56:28] loved me huh Jesus Christ is saying that
[56:32] God loves us even as he loved him that's
[56:36] your
[56:38] Bible father I will that they also whom
[56:41] thou has given me be with me where I am
[56:45] that's all Jesus ever asked for father I
[56:48] would that they be with me even where I
[56:51] am I go away to prepare a place for you
[56:54] that where I am there you may be also
[56:57] see so all of this if I did where yes uh
[57:02] my children would say I came from my
[57:04] daddy right now they can't come back to
[57:07] me but they came from me but in this
[57:09] instances we came from God and we go
[57:12] back to
[57:13] him you said that can't be possible then
[57:16] why do you call Heaven your home if
[57:18] you've never been
[57:24] there h listen I'm going close on this
[57:28] you know the book of Acts 5th chapter
[57:30] 28th and 29th saying did not we
[57:34] straightly command you that you should
[57:36] not teach in this name and you heard me
[57:39] say this the name of Jesus Christ is not
[57:43] named or enough amen oh God has been so
[57:47] good what which
[57:48] one in this day you ought to say which
[57:51] one which God has been so good
[57:54] Hallelujah you speaking of Jesus Christ
[57:58] Allah y'all hear what I'm saying come on
[58:01] Amen people don't mind you saying what
[58:03] God is being they don't never cringe
[58:04] when you say God but when you say Jesus
[58:07] Christ they cringe right it's something
[58:10] about that name that the world don't
[58:15] like Hallelujah something about it and
[58:18] that that power that name the Bible said
[58:21] every knee must bow every tongue confess
[58:24] people is that name
[58:26] the world don't want you to mention if
[58:29] you're going to be politically correct
[58:30] they don't mind you saying God but when
[58:32] you start saying Jesus that's you you
[58:35] you identifying a certain
[58:37] one ah come on somebody it's true but
[58:42] the Bible says Amen in the book of Acts
[58:45] amen they forbid them amen to teach or
[58:47] to preach in the name of Jesus and here
[58:49] they said well uh Peter said amen
[58:52] whether you like it or not he said i'
[58:54] rather be God than man huh come on
[58:57] somebody he said we ought to obey God
[59:00] rather than man and neither is there
[59:02] salvation in any other there's no other
[59:05] name given under Heaven whereby a man
[59:07] must be saved but the name of Jesus
[59:10] Christ Hallelujah I don't care what kind
[59:14] of school they ever gone through I don't
[59:16] care if they got ddds LD ddds amen
[59:19] there's only one name amen
[59:23] amenallah that God has given us
[59:27] every demon trembles that's why you
[59:29] don't see demons trembling no more cuz
[59:31] people say
[59:34] God hallelujah come on I'm not saying
[59:37] nothing wrong with wrong with saying God
[59:39] but we need to start say identifying who
[59:41] we talking about in this last name is
[59:44] that right that's what he said in the
[59:46] church AG he said I have a one good
[59:48] thing about you you kept my
[59:52] name huh huh come on and you better
[59:56] realize amen you can't call Jesus
[59:58] according to your own Revelation and get
[1:00:00] something from him you have to have a
[1:00:02] true revelation of who he is oh come on
[1:00:05] somebody remember the woman says lord
[1:00:07] said my my daughter is sick she called
[1:00:10] him what thy son of David he was the son
[1:00:13] of David to the Jews but not to this
[1:00:16] Gentile woman she said thou son of David
[1:00:19] he never answered her why because she
[1:00:22] was calling him according to the wrong
[1:00:24] Revelation Hallelujah
[1:00:26] that's why people don't get prayer
[1:00:28] answered they calling on him according
[1:00:30] to a denominational Revelation when he's
[1:00:33] revealed in his own
[1:00:35] word the same yesterday today and
[1:00:37] forever he's still God hallelujah and
[1:00:42] what happened is amen she We Come Along
[1:00:44] by the grace of God and and and then
[1:00:47] when she said Lord because he's
[1:00:50] everybody's
[1:00:51] Lord then he turned Hallelujah and then
[1:00:56] he rebuked her it is not lawful to give
[1:00:58] the children bread to dogs now let some
[1:01:02] preacher come up in here and call you a
[1:01:04] dog and you'll probably walk
[1:01:06] out Hallelujah but that woman humbled
[1:01:09] herself he said yes Lord but even the
[1:01:12] dog desired a Crumbs from the master
[1:01:15] table Hallelujah and Jesus said never
[1:01:19] have I seen such faith in Israel
[1:01:22] Hallelujah this time this hour your
[1:01:25] daughter is made whole amen amen because
[1:01:29] she called him Lord see you can't back
[1:01:31] up on God sometime God allows things to
[1:01:34] happen just to try to run you away but
[1:01:36] when you serious amen you stay like
[1:01:39] Peter I ain't going nowhere is that
[1:01:41] right except you eat my flesh and drink
[1:01:43] my blood you have no life the Bible says
[1:01:45] 70 turned away then Jesus turned to
[1:01:48] Peter said will you go said how can I go
[1:01:50] anywhere Lord you have you're the only
[1:01:52] one not one of the ones you're the only
[1:01:56] one amen that has words to eternal life
[1:01:58] where can I go Hallelujah that's the
[1:02:01] true bride of Jesus Christ we're suffer
[1:02:04] it we don't care what kind of trial
[1:02:06] we're going to go through
[1:02:08] amen hallelujah what kind of test Lord
[1:02:11] you can't run me away Hallelujah y'all
[1:02:13] know what I'm saying a real child you
[1:02:15] have a spanker child amen they get those
[1:02:18] little spankings come on where do they
[1:02:20] go they don't run out the door they come
[1:02:21] back to Mama and Dad and grab your leg
[1:02:24] why where else I'm going to go
[1:02:26] I'm going go I know you love me you
[1:02:28] sping me I know you love
[1:02:34] me huh I know you love me amen ain't
[1:02:38] nobody else going to treat me like you
[1:02:39] do so let me make it right with you
[1:02:43] that's what that child is saying let me
[1:02:44] make it right with
[1:02:51] you ain't nothing new on the sun and I
[1:02:53] ain't going to be able to finish this
[1:02:55] but but there's nothing new Under the
[1:02:57] Sun uh The Squeeze coming the test is
[1:03:00] coming we look at Shadrach Meshach and
[1:03:03] abedo right the fiery furnace we look at
[1:03:07] Daniel you know Daniel was conspired
[1:03:09] against in the Kingdom of Babylon they
[1:03:11] couldn't find no problem with Daniel
[1:03:13] except Daniel and his God the scripture
[1:03:16] said there was no fault in
[1:03:18] Daniel everything Daniel did was right
[1:03:20] the Bible said there was no error he was
[1:03:22] so into God he made sure everything was
[1:03:25] just is Right Hallelujah so when they
[1:03:28] conspired against Daniel they said
[1:03:29] listen we know that he bowed down his
[1:03:31] God we know he prayed three times a day
[1:03:33] so let's let the king Let's Help The
[1:03:35] King make a
[1:03:36] decree amen that there's an image that
[1:03:38] he must bow to and Daniel said not so
[1:03:42] and I'm going let you I'mma prove to you
[1:03:44] I'm not bowing to your image come on you
[1:03:46] and I must realize there's an image
[1:03:48] being res
[1:03:50] erected right
[1:03:52] now and listen you're going to be
[1:03:54] brought to a place you going to either
[1:03:56] bow to
[1:03:57] it or suffer the
[1:04:00] consequences H that temperature will be
[1:04:03] heated up seven times hotter y'all hear

[1:05:02] truth and we're living in a Time by the
[1:05:04] grace of God that this thing is God why
