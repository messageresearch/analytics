[21:21] [Music]
[21:23] was to be
[21:26] in the cross
[21:28] with you lord
[21:32] we thank you lord for
[21:37] the rest that you provide us
[21:40] that we rest in you
[21:43] and not forsake your voice
[21:48] to be drawn to where you want us to be
[21:53] cleansed of the inward parts of our
[21:55] heart
[21:59] we thank you lord for
[22:02] the faith the spirit of god mixed with
[22:06] your word
[22:08] and without it the word is
[22:11] the word killeth
[22:13] he said
[22:14] the grafted word killeth but the spirit
[22:17] gives life
[22:19] and we thank you for your spirit for
[22:21] being mindful
[22:23] of
[22:24] our need to be drawn to you to be

[22:29] with your holy ghost oil
[22:32] and extra oil we thank you lord for this
[22:35] place that you've prepared tonight
[22:38] this assembly
[22:40] we thank you lord for the words of life
[22:44] that you have in store for us
[22:47] as our brother
[22:48] lifted up to you the names
[22:51] we're not certain over the progress but
[22:53] he said
[22:55] that we just
[22:57] apply your word to their need
[23:00] and we know that your scripture shows
[23:02] that the prayer of faith
[23:04] shall heal a second
[23:06] lord we had that opportunity this
[23:08] morning
[23:09] before we
[23:11] went on our way that
[23:14] that your faith be deposited in our
[23:16] hearts
[23:18] that's your very
[23:19] nature your divine nature
[23:22] be deposited by you lord in our hearts
[23:26] and so we know that that faith
[23:29] the prayer of faith will heal
[23:32] those we think of sister angela who

[23:38] a need for her

[23:51] that you've put in her mortal body
[23:54] your scripture says that as our soul
[23:57] prospereth
[23:59] so are we in health
[24:02] and we just apply your word
[24:04] with your spirit
[24:06] we thank you lord
[24:08] for your love and we pray that
[24:11] all those that are in need that are not
[24:13] here and have not spoken that you just
[24:16] meet them there and they just meet them
[24:19] in the power of your holy spirit and

[47:25] times are hard
[47:28] things are changing
[47:30] amen jumping and shouting with my mind
[47:35] [Applause]
[47:37] [Music]
[47:48] i'm jumping and shouting with my
[47:52] [Music]
[47:57] hello
[48:03] [Music]
[48:09] amen thank you brother i forgot that
[48:11] portion
[48:13] nobody could sing it like our late
[48:15] sister
[48:16] johnson
[48:18] she's going on to be with the lord
[48:21] ah what a friend
[48:24] she was a true friend
[48:26] as we stand we're glad to have everybody
[48:28] here tonight
[48:30] amen everybody look like you're
[48:31] expecting something amen well i came
[48:34] expecting to
[48:35] [Laughter]
[48:37] by the grace of god
[48:39] as we stand we're going to ask that you
[48:41] turn with us
[48:42] by the grace of god to scripture here
[48:48] genesis the sixth chapter
[48:53] it's kind of like a series but it's kind
[48:55] of like a tie-in to what i've been
[48:56] preaching lately
[48:58] uh
[49:00] the the reason why i keep
[49:04] striking this
[49:06] uh
[49:07] i hope by god's grace he'll give it your
[49:09] understanding
[49:11] because um
[49:14] i believe that we're living in the last
[49:15] days
[49:17] and we keep saying that
[49:19] but it was
[49:20] a time when the prophet lived it was
[49:22] three minutes to midnight and so
[49:25] you can imagine where we are now
[49:28] uh having our
[49:30] second
[49:32] president
[49:33] who is now catholic
[49:35] uh visiting the pope
[49:37] and we know uh by god's grace to
[49:39] prophecy was that they would make a
[49:41] union
[49:43] and of course uh this one could make a
[49:45] union with our president he probably
[49:47] wouldn't even realize it but
[49:49] nevertheless
[49:50] he's there
[49:52] and we know that that is a true sign
[49:55] of
[49:56] where we are uh we know by god's grace
[49:59] that uh
[50:01] uh things gonna turn
[50:03] um
[50:04] in the negative for israel
[50:06] and uh
[50:07] we we can see the handwriting on the
[50:09] wall
[50:11] and that's another sign
[50:13] uh because when they turn that means
[50:16] uh those two prophets that they are to
[50:18] receive
[50:19] uh will be there by god's grace
[50:22] now i i saw in a quote where brother
[50:26] branham said that they were transported
[50:29] so
[50:30] that's amazing if that's what's going to
[50:32] happen
[50:33] and we know that's possible
[50:36] because we know that
[50:39] john was transported and
[50:42] enoch was translated and
[50:44] philip was transported
[50:49] ezekiel was translated and transported
[50:52] and whatever more he had happened to him
[50:53] we we know that uh science is not the
[50:56] author of this thing
[50:58] uh we've been doing this for hundreds of
[51:00] years now thousands if you want to say
[51:02] it
[51:03] but we do know by god's grace however it
[51:05] happened
[51:06] the world will know nothing about it
[51:10] uh when jesus came they really thought
[51:12] he was just a man
[51:14] they didn't see that he was more than a
[51:15] man
[51:17] and even to this day there are those who
[51:19] never who believed that he never rose
[51:20] again but we are witnesses that he he
[51:24] lives
[51:25] and uh so we want to read this uh
[51:28] scripture in genesis and
[51:31] trust by god's grace it'll be a blessing
[51:33] to you
[51:34] i remember when everything started
[51:35] happening
[51:36] uh the lord jesus took me to the
[51:38] scripture
[51:40] uh and uh and he said this is what he
[51:42] told me this is where we are
[51:46] so i believe with all my heart that we
[51:47] are at a time
[51:49] of destruction
[51:53] genesis the sixth chapter
[51:55] and it came to pass when men began to
[51:57] multiply
[52:00] on the face of the earth
[52:03] and daughters were born unto them
[52:06] that the sons of god saw the daughters
[52:08] of men that they were fair
[52:10] and they took them wives of all which
[52:13] they choose
[52:15] and the lord said my spirit
[52:20] and the lord said that my spirit
[52:23] i'm sorry
[52:25] shall not always strive with man
[52:29] excuse me for that he also is flesh yet
[52:32] his days shall be
[52:34] 120 years
[52:36] there were giants in the earth in those
[52:38] days
[52:40] and also
[52:42] after that
[52:43] when the sons of god came unto the
[52:45] daughters of men
[52:47] and they bear the children to them the
[52:49] same became mighty men which were of old
[52:53] men of renown
[52:55] and god saw that the wickedness of man
[52:58] was great in the earth
[53:00] and that every imagination of the
[53:02] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[53:05] continually
[53:06] and repented the lord that he had made
[53:09] man on the earth and it grieved him at
[53:12] his heart
[53:14] and the lord said i will destroy men
[53:17] whom i have created
[53:19] from the face of the earth both man and
[53:22] beast and the creeping things and the
[53:24] fowls of the air
[53:25] for it repented me that i have made man
[53:29] but noah found grace in the eyes of the
[53:32] lord
[53:33] let us pray heavenly father we thank you
[53:35] for your grace and your mercy we thank
[53:37] you for
[53:38] your goodness
[53:40] lord we appreciate you and we love you
[53:43] lord dearly uh when from our hearts is
[53:46] our desire to be one of those perfect
[53:50] ones that you
[53:51] chose before the foundation of the world
[53:54] father we believe that we are
[53:57] and that's why we're pressing
[53:59] and this is why we're
[54:01] in a position in our hearts and our
[54:03] minds
[54:04] uh to go on with you lord
[54:06] no matter what in jesus christ's name we
[54:09] pray amen you may be seated uh this is
[54:13] not a message that's going to
[54:15] try to provoke fear in you
[54:17] but it's something that i believe god
[54:19] wants us to understand
[54:21] and really the word of god blesses us in
[54:24] so many ways
[54:26] because the bible in itself tells our
[54:28] story
[54:30] sometimes it's things piece by piece by
[54:32] peace but once you put them all together
[54:35] you'll find that the people that lived
[54:37] in this bible are no different than you
[54:40] and some of the things that they had to
[54:42] encounter you and i encountered
[54:44] uh we realized we don't know i mean
[54:46] we've been talking about the coming of
[54:48] the lord for the longest we really don't
[54:50] know how much longer we do have
[54:52] but we do know that we don't have that
[54:55] much more time
[54:56] and one of the reasons why i'm bringing
[54:58] this is because
[55:00] when we're all saved every one of us who
[55:03] have made jesus christ our savior
[55:05] the bible says once we confess with our
[55:07] mouth and believe within our hearts
[55:09] that he's our savior he becomes our
[55:11] savior and the bible says that we pass
[55:14] from death unto life
[55:16] but we are a different group we're not
[55:19] just saved
[55:20] but we have been chosen
[55:22] we have been elected we are the true
[55:24] seed of god
[55:25] that god hid
[55:28] even from lucifer from the devil he had
[55:30] no idea what god was going to do
[55:33] i believe in in genesis 3 16 when he
[55:35] talked about uh the woman bruising the
[55:38] head of the serpent then the head of the
[55:40] serpent bruising the heel he still
[55:42] didn't have an understanding because
[55:44] he's a counter-minded creature and only
[55:47] those who have the holy ghost can
[55:48] understand what god is talking about so
[55:51] he he himself thought that he he was
[55:53] going to destroy god by killing the
[55:56] natural seed of god and he had no idea
[55:59] by killing the natural seed of god
[56:01] really made provisions for god to bring
[56:03] the spiritual seed amen and you know he
[56:06] killed cain and he thought came uh
[56:08] excuse me cain killed abel and thought
[56:10] he was killing god seed and and this is
[56:13] what i said the other night this is why
[56:15] satan still believed he can overthrow
[56:17] god because he overthrew adam but he
[56:20] didn't really overthrow adam he
[56:22] overthrew eve and adam willfully sin the
[56:26] bible says
[56:27] amen so but still through that act satan
[56:30] became god of this world
[56:32] amen and a lot of times people say well
[56:34] why god would do this and why god would
[56:36] do that but they don't understand what
[56:38] took place
[56:40] satan became god of this world when he
[56:43] took the throne if i could say right the
[56:45] power of the throne away
[56:48] from adam
[56:50] now
[56:52] we must understand that in this day and
[56:54] time there's a preparation time
[56:57] and you and i must know who we are
[57:00] see if you got to know who you are
[57:03] right it doesn't matter how poor and
[57:05] wretched you used to be
[57:07] but once you come into god you must come
[57:09] to the to the to the knowledge of who
[57:11] you are
[57:12] or what he has made you
[57:15] now my subject tonight is the the two
[57:18] natures
[57:19] in the church
[57:21] and if i was to have a sub-topic it
[57:23] would be
[57:24] preparing to meet him
[57:26] one thing for certain all of us will
[57:28] have to meet him
[57:30] one way or another
[57:31] it would make you think men who science
[57:34] who who
[57:36] who really people who really believe in
[57:38] science you know they they're always
[57:40] looking for a way of eternal life
[57:43] something to extend the life
[57:45] you know they they will go to the
[57:47] extreme
[57:48] uh ways of doing things to to prolong
[57:52] their lives and what they don't
[57:54] understand is their life can't really be
[57:56] prolonged
[57:57] uh god has a date and a time
[58:00] for you to die as he did for you to be
[58:03] born
[58:04] and so no matter how many creams and how
[58:06] many pills and how many
[58:09] scientific inventions they come up with
[58:11] you can lay yourself in a in a glass
[58:14] tube thinking that someday science is
[58:15] going to come up with
[58:17] a way to resurrect you but it's
[58:18] impossible
[58:20] because life is god
[58:23] and once you can define god amen you
[58:26] become equal with god
[58:28] now so we understand by god's grace you
[58:30] know uh let me let me say uh you use
[58:33] this one quote brother branham uh speaks
[58:35] of really really uh that really helped
[58:37] me he said may i stop right here just a
[58:40] minute and say
[58:42] i believe that the people are in the
[58:45] preparation
[58:47] of the last great destruction this world
[58:51] will ever know
[58:52] i believe we're at the end
[58:55] you may speak to people and you can put
[58:57] a billigram in every city in the united
[59:00] states
[59:01] they'll drink whiskey and smoke
[59:03] cigarettes
[59:04] and laugh at you and everything else
[59:07] just the same
[59:08] they are in the spirit of the last days
[59:12] and god
[59:14] uh
[59:15] cannot
[59:17] excuse me um
[59:18] sin destruction before the people are in
[59:21] the spirit of destruction
[59:24] god never did destroy anything
[59:27] man always destroys
[59:29] himself
[59:31] so we must say okay then what is the
[59:33] spirit of destruction it's what you see
[59:37] everything everything they're destroying
[59:39] your food
[59:41] by high breeding that's destruction
[59:44] uh they're destroying the air by way of
[59:46] pollution
[59:48] they're destroying you
[59:50] right and and a lot of times we we we
[59:53] look at the things i put away i'm not
[59:56] against vaccines but not all vaccines
[59:58] are good things to do
[1:00:00] uh uh uh uh
[1:00:02] uh penicillin still i'm not pronouncing
[1:00:05] that word right but
[1:00:06] you know what i'm saying
[1:00:08] you can work it so long till it
[1:00:11] literally becomes your enemy
[1:00:13] right in other words it won't work for
[1:00:14] you out the while so we look at these
[1:00:17] things and we see that science always
[1:00:19] backfire
[1:00:20] it never it'll never take you any higher
[1:00:23] and and you know let me say like this
[1:00:25] scientists believe in evolving and i
[1:00:28] think to myself you know if we are
[1:00:30] involved evolving into what i'm looking
[1:00:32] at now stop
[1:00:34] [Laughter]
[1:00:35] take me no further because i do not want
[1:00:38] to evolve into what i'm looking at now
[1:00:41] are these hideous creatures that are now
[1:00:43] calling themselves human
[1:00:45] now i'm saying these things because you
[1:00:47] got to realize that all of these things
[1:00:49] are influencing you in one way or
[1:00:52] another if you don't resist it
[1:00:56] hallelujah you will become it
[1:00:59] let me say it again if you don't resist
[1:01:02] it you will become it
[1:01:06] now we know brother branham said that
[1:01:09] when those demons that was loose uh from
[1:01:12] the river euphrates and those same
[1:01:15] demons that literally influenced hitler
[1:01:18] and and and and and in the world war two
[1:01:21] and all that he said when when when they
[1:01:24] left they actually went to hollywood
[1:01:27] now we know that
[1:01:28] we
[1:01:29] didn't we can look back now and we can
[1:01:32] see the influence of what hollywood had
[1:01:35] on the world hollywood
[1:01:39] my son is not
[1:01:41] he might be but anyway
[1:01:43] you know because everything that came
[1:01:45] out of that wasn't so evil but you can
[1:01:48] see the liberal
[1:01:51] spirit
[1:01:53] that came out of that
[1:01:55] and it destroyed
[1:01:57] the churches
[1:02:00] because they didn't resist it
[1:02:02] they took part they became partakers of
[1:02:05] it
[1:02:06] and now the church in itself has become
[1:02:10] the world
[1:02:12] you understand what i'm saying
[1:02:13] see there's no difference because when
[1:02:16] you see the characteristics of what the
[1:02:18] world is doing and you compare the
[1:02:20] characteristic to what the church is
[1:02:22] doing it is the same
[1:02:25] right
[1:02:26] so what i'm trying to say and that's
[1:02:28] what i was trying to say last week the
[1:02:30] mark of the beast begins with character
[1:02:34] the changing of your character
[1:02:37] right
[1:02:38] i mean the mark doesn't come till after
[1:02:40] your character has changed
[1:02:43] is that the truth it is because the
[1:02:46] bible said uh if a man looketh upon a
[1:02:49] woman
[1:02:50] to lust after her she's already
[1:02:52] committed adultery see so the adultery
[1:02:55] part comes into a man before he commits
[1:02:58] the
[1:03:00] and that's the way the mark of the beast
[1:03:02] is
[1:03:03] because what happens is you begin to
[1:03:05] reason with the word
[1:03:08] and you allow the word to be interpreted
[1:03:11] to you
[1:03:13] differently than what god said it would
[1:03:15] be is that what happened
[1:03:17] and and when eve did that allow the
[1:03:20] devil to interpret that word then the
[1:03:23] very inspiration that he interpret the
[1:03:26] word to her with gave birth and that
[1:03:30] birth that child was named cain
[1:03:33] and cain began to express the
[1:03:35] characteristics of what his father
[1:03:39] he became a murderer
[1:03:41] of the word
[1:03:43] he resisted the word
[1:03:45] is that right and and
[1:03:47] understand in resisting the word
[1:03:50] god put him out
[1:03:52] and marked him
[1:03:54] right now we're talking about seeds now
[1:03:57] that seed was marked
[1:04:00] and one thing that that seed bought the
[1:04:02] seed was it could never repent
[1:04:06] and humble itself to the word
[1:04:10] even though it may know what the word
[1:04:12] says
[1:04:13] it will never humble itself to the word
[1:04:18] and it will allow his father the serpent
[1:04:22] to always interpret the word to him
[1:04:25] to mean something different
[1:04:28] than what god intended
[1:04:32] is that the truth
[1:04:34] i mean we seen that amen even even when
[1:04:37] it came to judas
[1:04:39] judas was a disciple
[1:04:42] of christ
[1:04:43] chosen by christ
[1:04:45] but jesus said i i've chosen 12 and one
[1:04:48] is a devil
[1:04:49] what was it the characteristics
[1:04:52] he knew when pressure come how that seed
[1:04:56] would react
[1:04:58] now watch judas because if you look at
[1:05:00] judas judas had the right intent
[1:05:03] he thought he was pressuring god or
[1:05:05] pushing god in a position to to become
[1:05:08] that kind of messiah he thought he would
[1:05:10] be
[1:05:11] but when he saw that jesus himself
[1:05:14] didn't react in the way he wanted him to
[1:05:17] act because he didn't understand jesus
[1:05:20] didn't come as the conqueror
[1:05:22] that he thought
[1:05:24] he was going to come
[1:05:26] see most of them had their
[1:05:27] interpretation that jesus himself was
[1:05:30] going to ride in on a white horse he was
[1:05:32] going to overthrow rome and this is what
[1:05:34] was in the mind of judas
[1:05:37] he truly never listened
[1:05:39] to what jesus was trying to tell him
[1:05:42] because jesus told him that he would be
[1:05:45] crucified
[1:05:47] hallelujah but he wanted to alter the
[1:05:50] word he wanted to push the you can't
[1:05:52] alter the word you can't push the word
[1:05:54] in the corner hallelujah the word is the
[1:05:57] word
[1:05:58] and god is only going to do what his
[1:06:00] mind
[1:06:03] his mind thought
[1:06:05] produced that's right
[1:06:07] hallelujah right
[1:06:09] now think about it
[1:06:11] you you know i don't want to get off on
[1:06:13] this thought but just think about your
[1:06:15] thoughts how many times you think oh i
[1:06:16] just thought a thought
[1:06:18] no your thoughts come so quickly it
[1:06:20] makes your body move
[1:06:22] you couldn't you couldn't keep up with
[1:06:24] thoughts
[1:06:25] you don't even know where they come from
[1:06:27] they're so fast
[1:06:29] right i mean your thoughts blink your
[1:06:31] eye your thoughts make you speak
[1:06:33] hallelujah but god was so such a god he
[1:06:38] could catch every thought
[1:06:43] hallelujah speaking into existence and
[1:06:46] you the thought that he thought about
[1:06:49] lord
[1:06:50] never miss the beat
[1:06:53] but you see those thoughts in itself
[1:06:56] amen was what became genes of god
[1:07:00] amen hallelujah see because jesus
[1:07:03] declared there is no darkness in me i
[1:07:06] love that
[1:07:07] jesus says there is he told his
[1:07:09] disciples his devil and everybody there
[1:07:11] is no darkness in me
[1:07:14] hallelujah there is no unrighteousness
[1:07:17] there's not a filthy thing in me
[1:07:19] everything i do i do according to the
[1:07:21] word
[1:07:23] so do you know what that means to be in
[1:07:25] him
[1:07:27] it means that if you in him
[1:07:29] you can't be darkness
[1:07:32] hallelujah
[1:07:34] see now this is the thing
[1:07:37] we told you by god's grace think about
[1:07:39] it now in the days of noah
[1:07:41] it had gotten so bad and you know
[1:07:43] scientists you know they
[1:07:46] you know
[1:07:49] they're good for what they you know
[1:07:51] it's
[1:07:52] sometimes they're right
[1:07:54] and i don't mean to be so hard but i
[1:07:56] know we're living in a time where people
[1:07:58] worship science
[1:08:00] and science is not god something created
[1:08:03] that
[1:08:05] right it's like you go a scientist is a
[1:08:08] man that goes into a laboratory that's
[1:08:11] already been made
[1:08:14] and you go in there trying to figure out
[1:08:16] all the things that's in that laboratory
[1:08:18] and sometimes you'll catch it and then
[1:08:20] you say oh i got it now well you didn't
[1:08:23] do that you just figured it out
[1:08:26] right so you look at this thing it's the
[1:08:28] truth if scientists are so great tell
[1:08:31] them how to produce life
[1:08:34] without life
[1:08:36] right don't tell me he made you greater
[1:08:38] than god oh i can make a i can make this
[1:08:40] and i'll make it that like somebody said
[1:08:42] well if you can make a something great
[1:08:44] use your own saying
[1:08:48] right
[1:08:49] because you've got to use what's been
[1:08:51] already created in order to let me get
[1:08:53] back to where i'm supposed to i'm
[1:08:55] supposed to be so what i'm trying to say
[1:08:57] is this
[1:08:58] god in the time of noah we know it was
[1:09:01] violence
[1:09:03] gang violence
[1:09:05] is that right i mean everything was
[1:09:07] going on in noah's day like it is now
[1:09:11] otherwise we're living in a different
[1:09:12] day
[1:09:14] right but you got to understand as it
[1:09:16] was in the days of noah so shall it be
[1:09:18] in this day
[1:09:19] right so but you've got to understand
[1:09:21] when i say this is i'm coming back from
[1:09:24] cain and abel right
[1:09:26] and we know that cain killed abel trying
[1:09:28] to
[1:09:29] uh uproot the royal seed of god
[1:09:32] then god amen comes along and he
[1:09:34] produces seth
[1:09:36] right and then sept was a shadow and a
[1:09:39] type of the resurrection
[1:09:40] because the the bible said when sept was
[1:09:43] then brought forth then men began to
[1:09:46] worship their lord again so you gotta
[1:09:48] understand there was a period of time
[1:09:50] where there was no true worship
[1:09:52] amen but god restored the reworship by
[1:09:55] producing a new seed
[1:09:58] his seed which was called self this is
[1:10:01] why i can't figure out those of us who
[1:10:04] claim to be messaged we don't know how
[1:10:06] to worship
[1:10:08] hallelujah but you must understand that
[1:10:11] the worship is in the sea
[1:10:14] it's in the gene you don't have to put
[1:10:16] it on it's a come on it's something that
[1:10:19] happens
[1:10:20] even when you can't you can't even
[1:10:22] control it that's when the gene has been
[1:10:26] how can they say charge of the gene
[1:10:28] itself
[1:10:30] that's the word activated
[1:10:32] amen
[1:10:33] hallelujah is that right
[1:10:35] because you know when brother bob came
[1:10:37] he told about the pill of fire and how
[1:10:38] the pill of fire danced and that was god
[1:10:41] dancing and worshiping
[1:10:43] now that same light supposed to be in
[1:10:45] you
[1:10:46] right
[1:10:47] see that's the life of the seed
[1:10:50] every seed like i said like the other
[1:10:52] night every seed that is planted do not
[1:10:54] come up because it lacks the the seed or
[1:10:57] the life of the seed right but when that
[1:11:00] sun strikes that seed amen that has life
[1:11:04] in it
[1:11:05] that seed must give way to the life
[1:11:08] it must rot it must die amen in order
[1:11:11] for that life to come up
[1:11:13] hallelujah you see what i'm saying there
[1:11:15] are stages in which that seed has to go
[1:11:19] through in order to produce the life
[1:11:22] amen
[1:11:25] hallelujah
[1:11:27] we can see
[1:11:29] by god's grace that in that
[1:11:33] time of noah noah
[1:11:35] built an ark and
[1:11:38] when the ark had gone through the great
[1:11:40] tribulation y'all know how it is
[1:11:44] noah gave it a test
[1:11:46] the new world
[1:11:49] gave it a test and see let me tell you
[1:11:50] something everybody that claimed to be
[1:11:52] christians you're going to be tested
[1:11:55] hallelujah
[1:11:56] now that ark represented christ jesus
[1:11:59] christ one door you heard me say that
[1:12:01] the other day and noah was preaching in
[1:12:03] the door showing that the only way you
[1:12:05] can get in the doors you had to come by
[1:12:06] noah but that door represented jesus
[1:12:09] christ y'all understand me
[1:12:12] so there was one window
[1:12:15] and when it came to testing after the 40
[1:12:17] days and nights you know how it was the
[1:12:19] ship settled down on mount erak
[1:12:23] and noah
[1:12:24] tested
[1:12:26] the grounds
[1:12:29] i'm talking about nature's now
[1:12:31] and he took those two birds
[1:12:34] he sent that crow out
[1:12:37] and of course the first time the water
[1:12:39] was still not abated
[1:12:41] but that second time he the last time he
[1:12:43] took that that crew out he never
[1:12:45] did return
[1:12:48] but the dub did
[1:12:50] because the dove could not eat
[1:12:54] that dead caucus of destruction
[1:12:58] i love to word it that way
[1:13:00] the dove could not eat
[1:13:03] the dead carcass
[1:13:05] of destruction
[1:13:07] but the crow
[1:13:10] boy he had a jubilee
[1:13:12] he had a feast
[1:13:14] he probably died eating
[1:13:21] he has so much to feast off
[1:13:23] and you got to understand when you have
[1:13:26] when you're working with the dove that's
[1:13:28] i'm working with nature now
[1:13:30] as long as you can eat the dead caucus
[1:13:33] of destruction of this world you have
[1:13:35] not yet been born again
[1:13:39] amen
[1:13:40] that's what i'm working with
[1:13:42] and we find out that there are people in
[1:13:44] this church in this message because
[1:13:46] somebody has taught you because i
[1:13:48] believe the message i am bride that is a
[1:13:51] lie
[1:13:52] the devil believes the message
[1:13:56] you must be born again
[1:13:59] that is what it is
[1:14:00] you can't bypass it
[1:14:03] it is what is needed
[1:14:07] you love that
[1:14:09] we can't allow ourselves
[1:14:12] to uh allow the world to
[1:14:16] uh filter through us or come through us
[1:14:18] if i could say like that uh
[1:14:20] the words i'm looking for is not there
[1:14:22] but nevertheless we can't eat of the
[1:14:24] world
[1:14:26] and expect to go to heaven
[1:14:29] you can't do it
[1:14:30] i mean you can do it but you your trip
[1:14:34] will be canceled
[1:14:36] you won't be able to make it
[1:14:38] because no unclean thing understand this
[1:14:41] world we're going through
[1:14:43] there will never be a memory left
[1:14:47] of this
[1:14:49] thank god hallelujah
[1:14:51] when jesus said i will wipe the tears
[1:14:54] away from your eyes he's literally
[1:14:57] saying i'm gonna wipe your memory from
[1:14:59] everything that ever happened to you you
[1:15:02] will never understand it you'll never
[1:15:05] see it you won't miss the uncle the
[1:15:07] brother the daddy the father whoever
[1:15:09] didn't make it it will be wiped away
[1:15:13] thank god for his grace
[1:15:15] because heaven will never be heaven if
[1:15:17] you can remember your old loved ones
[1:15:21] think about it
[1:15:23] the conditions
[1:15:26] lawlessness that's why people don't
[1:15:28] understand well what you mean defunding
[1:15:30] the pray for the defunding the police it
[1:15:33] must be
[1:15:35] because in that day it was lawlessness
[1:15:40] it has to come to this it's not going to
[1:15:43] stop it's going to continue to progress
[1:15:47] in the way of destruction
[1:15:50] wars and rumors of wars
[1:15:53] pestilence and all of these things and
[1:15:55] we understand now that the pestilence
[1:15:57] just didn't happen
[1:15:59] they were developed
[1:16:01] as it was in the days of noah
[1:16:03] and those those scientists were far more
[1:16:06] smarter than what we are and now they're
[1:16:09] telling us that they have found germs
[1:16:11] and viruses underneath the ice
[1:16:14] that's now melting and they wouldn't
[1:16:16] even know what to do with them
[1:16:19] hallelujah you say oh brother don't you
[1:16:21] see it
[1:16:22] that great tribulation period
[1:16:25] where men will be walking with rotted
[1:16:27] flesh
[1:16:28] they make mockery and they put out these
[1:16:31] things about zombies and all that but
[1:16:33] what they don't understand is that
[1:16:35] they're projecting an image of a future
[1:16:40] they won't be dead
[1:16:42] but they will be in a place that they
[1:16:43] would wish they were dead
[1:16:48] that missed the rapture
[1:16:51] will have to face this kind of condition
[1:16:55] hallelujah
[1:16:57] it won't be the the arab countries in
[1:16:59] all of these other countries that's
[1:17:01] going to be bombing everything look
[1:17:02] what's happening now they're moving in
[1:17:05] on us why
[1:17:08] because as america we rejected the
[1:17:11] gospel
[1:17:13] and because we have rejected the gospel
[1:17:15] god has rejected us
[1:17:18] oh they might not want to hear it but
[1:17:19] it's the truth
[1:17:22] it's the truth not just america the
[1:17:24] whole world
[1:17:26] nobody wants to know the true jesus
[1:17:28] christ they don't mind religion
[1:17:31] but they don't want to see the real
[1:17:33] thing
[1:17:34] everybody wants to be free
[1:17:37] let me move on
[1:17:38] so that you know that but that god
[1:17:42] how can we say god didn't want us
[1:17:45] because even in the days of noah
[1:17:47] noah was the prophet
[1:17:49] noah warned the people and the more he
[1:17:53] warned the people
[1:17:54] the more evil they became
[1:17:57] see because when you reject truth you
[1:18:00] become evil
[1:18:02] you literally give satan rule over your
[1:18:05] body from that point on
[1:18:08] it's the truth look what judas did when
[1:18:11] he rejected jesus
[1:18:13] he became the murderer of god
[1:18:17] if i could say it like that
[1:18:19] he murdered jesus
[1:18:21] oh you say he didn't he did
[1:18:25] and he would be judged as a murderer
[1:18:28] you said all he did was betray him
[1:18:30] that's what he did
[1:18:32] but because of his betrayal
[1:18:34] they were able to identify him
[1:18:36] and because they could identify him they
[1:18:38] crucified him so you go back to the root
[1:18:42] of it and it has to tie back in with
[1:18:44] with uh with uh
[1:18:46] uh
[1:18:47] kane
[1:18:48] but kane because cain killed
[1:18:50] abel at the altar and judas killed
[1:18:54] jesus at the altar
[1:18:59] is god good to us
[1:19:01] no wonder when god reveals these things
[1:19:04] to you something takes place on the
[1:19:06] inside hallelujah this gospel seeing
[1:19:10] something it seems insane
[1:19:12] you mean to tell me y'all gonna be
[1:19:14] raptured absolutely
[1:19:16] these these aliens you're looking for
[1:19:19] they're here already
[1:19:22] hallelujah what this is the true
[1:19:24] christian who's the alien
[1:19:26] we came from god and we'll go back to
[1:19:28] god amen hallelujah and think about it
[1:19:32] we'll be changed in a moment in the
[1:19:33] twinkling of an eye hallelujah we won't
[1:19:37] have to say we're beaming up scotty it
[1:19:39] will happen before we think about it
[1:19:42] hallelujah and our prophet said we'll
[1:19:44] travel like a thought
[1:19:45] glory to god we won't need automobiles
[1:19:48] we won't need planes we won't need any
[1:19:51] of these man-made
[1:19:53] contraptions
[1:19:55] because everything they make is good and
[1:19:57] evil
[1:19:59] biting off of the tree of knowledge of
[1:20:01] good and evil
[1:20:03] hallelujah but god is good to us
[1:20:07] god is good to us
[1:20:09] when it comes to the truth
[1:20:11] we stagger not
[1:20:14] he said lord i i i
[1:20:16] listen let me say it like this
[1:20:18] none of us rule god
[1:20:20] god is god
[1:20:24] amen
[1:20:25] god determines what he's going to do
[1:20:28] and whether we understand it or not he
[1:20:31] does
[1:20:32] now explain to me
[1:20:34] why god told
[1:20:36] abraham sarah is right
[1:20:39] go into hagar
[1:20:41] and hagar
[1:20:42] gets pregnant
[1:20:44] and have a wild man
[1:20:47] what
[1:20:48] god wanted the two to keep moving
[1:20:52] side by side
[1:20:53] because he had a purpose
[1:20:55] for it happening is that right
[1:20:58] god needed can i say it like this god
[1:21:01] needed the devil
[1:21:03] [Laughter]
[1:21:05] hallelujah because if there was never no
[1:21:07] darkness you'll never know what light is
[1:21:11] he needed the devil to do ju he didn't
[1:21:13] make him do it
[1:21:15] but he knew he would do it
[1:21:18] hallelujah and he became the great enemy
[1:21:21] of god but you got to understand the
[1:21:23] devil still works for god
[1:21:29] is that right because the devil can't do
[1:21:31] nothing
[1:21:32] he said what do you mean
[1:21:34] when it came to job
[1:21:36] the devil was walking to and fro
[1:21:38] and the lord said what up what you doing
[1:21:42] he's at all i'm just walking to and fro
[1:21:44] basically saying i'm trying to find
[1:21:45] somebody i can devour
[1:21:48] and god said have you considered my
[1:21:50] servant job
[1:21:51] [Laughter]
[1:21:53] i think joe if he could have just saw
[1:21:55] that he was like hold up lord hold up
[1:21:57] but you see cause none of us want to go
[1:22:00] through trials none of us want to go
[1:22:02] through the hardships of things like
[1:22:04] that but we must understand that's the
[1:22:06] way god produces
[1:22:08] the good stuff
[1:22:12] amen right it takes lightning and
[1:22:14] thundering and rain to produce those
[1:22:16] beautiful flowers
[1:22:18] you understand me it take a rugged
[1:22:21] jagged sky amen to produce the beautiful
[1:22:24] things of the earth
[1:22:26] and so it takes those
[1:22:28] because of the fall now because of the
[1:22:30] fall
[1:22:31] god even uses the negative to produce
[1:22:33] the positives
[1:22:36] so anyway but when god has done
[1:22:38] something for you and i'm gonna be
[1:22:40] jumping back and forth because you got
[1:22:41] to understand these two seeds these two
[1:22:44] these two is like the dove
[1:22:46] and the crow
[1:22:48] now the dove he can't he has no gall
[1:22:51] so he can't eat the worldly things of
[1:22:53] god of the devil he can't he can't do it
[1:22:55] he'll get sick he'll die
[1:22:57] if you try to do it you're going to get
[1:22:58] sick and you're going to die unless you
[1:23:00] repent
[1:23:02] you see what i'm saying so what i'm
[1:23:03] trying to say is this so when you see
[1:23:06] those two natures you had cain and you
[1:23:08] had abel you had jacob and you had esau
[1:23:11] and sometimes it looked like the guy who
[1:23:14] is a god he looks like a devil
[1:23:18] right
[1:23:19] when we we before we got converted we
[1:23:22] all looked like devils
[1:23:24] we acted like devils we did devilish
[1:23:26] things and the prophet god said what it
[1:23:28] was and because of the hybriding you
[1:23:30] looked like a cockapoo but on the inside
[1:23:32] you had the wheat germ so when the holy
[1:23:35] spirit struck you it wasn't the the
[1:23:38] cockapoo that came alive it was the
[1:23:40] wheat germ inside of you
[1:23:44] that transforms us
[1:23:47] i love it
[1:23:49] but there's one man who who's
[1:23:52] uh uh literally grew up among pagans and
[1:23:55] heathens and you name it and you know
[1:23:58] they were just uh
[1:23:59] known for
[1:24:01] uh idol worshipping
[1:24:03] and y'all know who i'm talking i'm
[1:24:04] talking about abram
[1:24:06] whose name later was changing to abraham
[1:24:09] but when he met god think about it
[1:24:11] how did he know
[1:24:14] the voice of god how do you know it
[1:24:18] it's something in you
[1:24:20] that was put in you before the
[1:24:21] foundation of the world
[1:24:23] you didn't have to figure it out you say
[1:24:25] hey this sounds right
[1:24:28] right it draws you you can't even stop
[1:24:30] it amen because it keeps pulling on you
[1:24:33] because you know in your soul it's right
[1:24:37] you can't figure that out you maybe can
[1:24:38] you maybe maybe not can you can't
[1:24:40] explain it but it's just something that
[1:24:42] grabs you and that's the way it was with
[1:24:45] abram
[1:24:46] and evidently he lived up in in some
[1:24:49] kind of wealth because he packed it up
[1:24:51] trying to bring it with him
[1:24:54] lot and everybody else amen
[1:24:57] didn't even know where he was going now
[1:24:59] look how crazy that looks
[1:25:02] or seems amen you're going somewhere and
[1:25:05] you don't even have a destiny
[1:25:08] where are you going i don't know but i'm
[1:25:10] getting out of here
[1:25:12] but that's the way i felt about the
[1:25:14] domination that i was in i didn't know
[1:25:16] where i was going but i was getting out
[1:25:18] of that
[1:25:21] and so it pulls on you it draws you amen
[1:25:24] into a place amen you don't even know
[1:25:26] but then after a while
[1:25:28] that voice began to communicate with you
[1:25:30] in a way that you don't even you can't
[1:25:32] even understand it how well how i can
[1:25:34] hear him and nobody else can hear it
[1:25:37] see that's how it is
[1:25:38] you can hear his voice and somebody
[1:25:40] could be standing right next to you and
[1:25:42] won't hear a thing
[1:25:44] but because of who you are
[1:25:46] that's why you were able to hear it and
[1:25:48] that's why jesus says my sheep will hear
[1:25:51] he they hear my voice
[1:25:53] you might look like a goat right now but
[1:25:56] it's just that you need a name to change
[1:25:59] hallelujah he said my sheep hears my
[1:26:01] voice because in your soul you are sheep
[1:26:05] and the bible's uh brother i'm saying
[1:26:06] like this you're either serpent or you
[1:26:09] are dove
[1:26:10] hallelujah but let's move on the bible
[1:26:13] says he staggered not talking about
[1:26:15] abraham at the promise of god through
[1:26:18] unbelief but was strong in faith giving
[1:26:21] glory to god unbelief is sin
[1:26:24] that's the root of all sin
[1:26:27] now oh god of my bride what you mean am
[1:26:29] i bride
[1:26:31] where if comes in that
[1:26:34] when the word calls you
[1:26:37] it identifies you
[1:26:39] when you respond it re it identifies who
[1:26:43] you are
[1:26:44] hallelujah
[1:26:46] you never see a cow responding to a
[1:26:49] horse
[1:26:50] cows respond to cows horses or horses
[1:26:53] sheep the sheep and goat to go and when
[1:26:56] god called you he gave you a sheep call
[1:26:59] a shepherd's call and you responded to
[1:27:02] him that's who you are but the problem
[1:27:05] is we all need to clean up
[1:27:09] we all need to clean up
[1:27:10] it ain't even oh i'm right no we need to
[1:27:13] sanctify ourselves consecrate ourselves
[1:27:16] so we can see the move of god in this
[1:27:19] place
[1:27:20] the devil has no right coming in here
[1:27:24] no right
[1:27:26] amen
[1:27:27] like i said a few a week or so ago that
[1:27:30] spirit that was in here we could net
[1:27:32] we'll never let that happen again
[1:27:35] stagger not at the promise of god
[1:27:38] hallelujah but we're strong in faith
[1:27:41] giving glory to god
[1:27:44] and being fully persuaded
[1:27:47] that what he had promised he was able
[1:27:50] also to perform
[1:27:52] not halfway
[1:27:54] fully
[1:27:55] fully persuaded
[1:27:58] right
[1:27:59] fully persuaded that god was able amen
[1:28:03] to perform come on somebody see that's
[1:28:07] what makes things work for you you can't
[1:28:09] come to god with a make-believe faith
[1:28:13] some mental thing you got in your mind
[1:28:15] and as soon as something happened your
[1:28:17] mind breaks
[1:28:19] no this faith must come from the throne
[1:28:22] i don't know how i know but i know
[1:28:25] and that revelation can only be given to
[1:28:27] you by god don't let the devil take it
[1:28:30] from you
[1:28:31] you can't
[1:28:32] because once you fully persuade it
[1:28:34] there's no room for no room for unbelief
[1:28:37] that's like filling the cup
[1:28:39] there's no room for nothing else
[1:28:41] right
[1:28:43] and therefore it was imputed to him for
[1:28:45] righteousness
[1:28:47] wait a minute
[1:28:49] y'all understand me
[1:28:50] you understand the word when it was
[1:28:52] fully persuaded he was full so god
[1:28:55] imputed it
[1:28:56] you understand
[1:28:57] that means no matter how many times he
[1:28:59] fell and how many times he came short
[1:29:01] because he believed god was more than
[1:29:03] able to bring him to that place god gave
[1:29:05] it to him
[1:29:07] amen
[1:29:09] it takes the weight off of your shoulder
[1:29:12] and it puts it back on jesus
[1:29:14] is that right
[1:29:16] that's what the bible said he was a he
[1:29:18] he had the he was the counselor the
[1:29:20] almighty god the prince of peace he if
[1:29:23] the government was upon his shoulder
[1:29:25] hallelujah you understand me he he's
[1:29:28] he's the
[1:29:30] head of it all
[1:29:31] y'all keep it up and i'm gonna become
[1:29:32] shouting john up here
[1:29:35] but for us also to whom it shall be
[1:29:37] imputed if we believe on him that raised
[1:29:40] up jesus our lord from the dead uh you
[1:29:43] know what i'm gonna tell you something
[1:29:45] he raised him from the dead i'm gonna
[1:29:47] say it again he raised him from the dead
[1:29:49] so we've got no business being in here
[1:29:51] dead
[1:29:55] that's right he raised him from the dead
[1:29:57] we have no business being dead in here
[1:30:00] we should if anybody should be making
[1:30:02] noise it's supposed to be us
[1:30:04] the prophet god was just talking on one
[1:30:06] of those tapes today he said the
[1:30:08] pentecostal church has gotten so bad now
[1:30:10] you can't even see him on the streets
[1:30:12] witnessing no more
[1:30:13] and you don't
[1:30:15] sometimes you'll see people witness on
[1:30:17] the on on the corners and things and you
[1:30:20] think well he don't go to my church
[1:30:22] that's nonsense
[1:30:26] a brother is a brother
[1:30:28] and if he's preaching jesus you ought to
[1:30:30] say amen
[1:30:32] when we was out there to the park we had
[1:30:34] some people come join us and sing with
[1:30:35] us you know the thing and problem is we
[1:30:37] have a denominational mind even though
[1:30:39] we say we're not denominational
[1:30:42] hallelujah by one spirit are we baptized
[1:30:45] into christ
[1:30:47] and one day we'll come to know that
[1:30:49] because brother adam said when that
[1:30:50] squeeze comes your doctrine won't mean a
[1:30:53] thing
[1:30:54] you're going to see somebody standing
[1:30:56] for jesus and you're going to jump
[1:30:58] you're going to shout you're going to be
[1:31:00] glad you see oh my god god bless you
[1:31:03] brother
[1:31:04] you're not going to say what church you
[1:31:06] belong to
[1:31:08] no
[1:31:10] no no no
[1:31:11] it won't be like that at all
[1:31:14] see this is the kind of thing is once
[1:31:16] you denominate yourself you'll never be
[1:31:17] able to love others that's right it's a
[1:31:20] devil's trick
[1:31:22] to keep you from loving somebody who's
[1:31:24] different from you
[1:31:25] and you got to love all
[1:31:27] even your enemy
[1:31:28] hallelujah i'll never de-christianize a
[1:31:31] man because you know what i know where i
[1:31:33] used to be
[1:31:34] and you can't tell me when i was back
[1:31:36] there i wasn't a christian i may not
[1:31:38] have understood everything i know now
[1:31:40] but when jesus when jesus touched me he
[1:31:44] touched me then
[1:31:46] hallelujah that's one of those things
[1:31:48] nobody can take from me i don't care
[1:31:49] what oh you didn't get it until you came
[1:31:51] into the message well what was the
[1:31:53] message the message have always been
[1:31:55] jesus christ and you trying to tell me i
[1:31:58] think i couldn't get jesus christ until
[1:32:00] let me ask you a question when did
[1:32:02] brother branham get it
[1:32:06] huh
[1:32:07] did he get the holy ghost in 63 when did
[1:32:09] he get it
[1:32:12] he got it when he was a baptist
[1:32:14] [Music]
[1:32:16] not even the trinitarian doctrine
[1:32:18] stopped him from getting the holy ghost
[1:32:22] but because he got the holy ghost and
[1:32:24] led him into the truth
[1:32:27] somebody help me here see people you
[1:32:30] know we got to wash our mind from all
[1:32:32] this nonsense
[1:32:34] we've got to be an example of divine
[1:32:36] love and how can you win anybody amen
[1:32:40] thinking you're better than somebody
[1:32:41] some pharisee of some sort that's not
[1:32:44] god
[1:32:44] remember i told you that ferris that
[1:32:47] that that uh
[1:32:48] seed
[1:32:50] that that bad seed always look for
[1:32:53] preeminence
[1:32:55] going to be something greater mr truth
[1:32:58] that's what the pharisees they wanted to
[1:32:59] be preeminent and then john came and
[1:33:02] identified him said you generation of
[1:33:04] vipers
[1:33:05] right you're looking like you're all
[1:33:06] holy but inside you're dead men's bones
[1:33:10] and let me say it like this i don't care
[1:33:12] how long people have preached this
[1:33:14] message if the character of christ is
[1:33:16] not in them they're still dead
[1:33:19] they may have potential we all have
[1:33:21] potential but god is not resting on
[1:33:24] potential we've got to get there
[1:33:27] i'm finna i'm going to come it's the
[1:33:29] truth that's why you got people saying
[1:33:32] and doing all kinds of things and you
[1:33:34] know lord noble people and all kinds of
[1:33:36] stuff people are doing in the name of
[1:33:38] the message
[1:33:39] and people got the message and they let
[1:33:41] them do it
[1:33:42] uh-uh
[1:33:44] no
[1:33:47] hallelujah splitting churches and
[1:33:48] everything and the bible said when a man
[1:33:50] spent a church he seemed to have the
[1:33:52] holy ghost jews said he don't even have
[1:33:54] it
[1:33:55] amen
[1:34:00] lord help us
[1:34:01] second timothy through 20 says
[1:34:03] nevertheless
[1:34:04] i love this the foundation of god stands
[1:34:07] ashore
[1:34:08] having this seal the lord knoweth them
[1:34:11] that are his so you understand the
[1:34:15] rapture means a few
[1:34:18] yeah
[1:34:20] brother said to be a few
[1:34:22] a few
[1:34:25] that means that a lot of people in this
[1:34:26] message gonna miss it
[1:34:30] why because they the devil has duped
[1:34:32] them
[1:34:34] the devil has twisted
[1:34:36] the idea of what life is
[1:34:40] and life is not prosperity
[1:34:43] and that's what a lot of people say oh
[1:34:44] i'm prospering oh look how big my church
[1:34:46] is now i got thousands of people let me
[1:34:49] ask you how many of them are converted
[1:34:52] we get them to we get them to the
[1:34:54] message but how many truly are converted
[1:34:59] that's all i'm saying
[1:35:00] the emphasis is conversion you must be
[1:35:04] born again
[1:35:06] you've got to have the life of christ in
[1:35:09] you that all damnable nature must die it
[1:35:13] must rot from the pulpit all the way to
[1:35:15] the back of the door it cannot remain
[1:35:18] alive and ex and and and then you make a
[1:35:21] rapture
[1:35:23] jesus brother baby said however the tree
[1:35:25] fall that's how it laid how it laid
[1:35:27] you know however it falls that's how it
[1:35:29] lays excuse me
[1:35:31] nevertheless having this foundation of
[1:35:33] god standing ashore having this seal the
[1:35:35] lord knoweth them that are his and i'm
[1:35:37] gonna come to my real subject in a
[1:35:39] moment and let everyone that name the
[1:35:41] name of christ depart from iniquity flee
[1:35:44] also use for lust but follow
[1:35:46] righteousness faith charity peace with
[1:35:50] them that call on the lord out of what a
[1:35:53] pure heart and remember only the pure
[1:35:55] and hard shall see god
[1:35:58] hallelujah
[1:36:00] glory to god
[1:36:02] look what the prophet god says in
[1:36:04] the signs of his time
[1:36:06] 1963 he says under luther it was the
[1:36:09] same holy spirit justification then
[1:36:13] sanctification on the wesley the message
[1:36:16] then the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:36:19] making three
[1:36:20] three not three steps of grace but three
[1:36:24] stations
[1:36:27] there's a difference
[1:36:29] when you're at a station
[1:36:31] you're at a place of change
[1:36:34] you've got to change
[1:36:35] it's not enough to be justified but you
[1:36:38] got to be sanctified and you stay right
[1:36:40] there in that station until you are
[1:36:42] sanctified
[1:36:44] then when you're sanctified then god
[1:36:46] will come down and seal you like you
[1:36:47] ought to be
[1:36:53] but we'll scream god grace grace don't
[1:36:55] you understand god's word is your grace
[1:37:00] it is the thing that god gives you to
[1:37:02] keep you from the judgment
[1:37:04] he tells you his thoughts and what he
[1:37:06] desired for you to be and because he
[1:37:09] gives it to you that is your grace you
[1:37:12] say well what do you mean the grace of
[1:37:14] god to know what's to show know how to
[1:37:16] prepare an ark
[1:37:18] hallelujah the grace of god to us is
[1:37:21] show us how to enter into it
[1:37:25] who is christ jesus
[1:37:30] pray for me and i pray for you
[1:37:36] nor was the baptism baptism baptized
[1:37:39] eight souls
[1:37:41] out of the whole world
[1:37:43] think about it
[1:37:47] then god comes along
[1:37:49] and he sanctifies the world
[1:37:52] through the blood of jesus christ
[1:37:55] and when you're when the blood of jesus
[1:37:56] dropped on the earth it's sanctified
[1:38:00] see that's why i try to tell people
[1:38:02] every man that want to be saved you can
[1:38:03] be saved right you can because god saved
[1:38:06] you
[1:38:07] brother adam said people are not saved
[1:38:09] because they reject their atonement they
[1:38:11] reject it it's already done for you
[1:38:14] but when you reject it what god can do
[1:38:16] he can't do nothing because you rejected
[1:38:18] it
[1:38:21] is that right
[1:38:22] then john says listen i baptize you with
[1:38:25] water but then there's one coming after
[1:38:27] me
[1:38:27] he's going to baptize you with the holy
[1:38:29] ghost and fire amen god have mercy where
[1:38:32] is it in this message
[1:38:34] where is the holy ghost and fire
[1:38:36] huh amen oh that's two pentecostals but
[1:38:39] see brother branham said that's the only
[1:38:41] kind this message can produce
[1:38:44] are you going to argue with that
[1:38:46] we got too much control we control the
[1:38:48] holy ghost are you serious
[1:38:50] the problem is we don't know how to
[1:38:52] yield to him and we're too prideful
[1:38:55] pride is the key
[1:38:57] we're too prideful god want to dance in
[1:39:00] you and you don't want to dance one day
[1:39:02] he's going to stop asking you to dance
[1:39:05] and then you're going to wish you could
[1:39:08] you love the lord
[1:39:10] i'm not trying to be rough i'm just
[1:39:12] trying to be straight
[1:39:14] is that okay
[1:39:17] now
[1:39:21] brother brandon said it like this in
[1:39:23] preparation he says
[1:39:25] brother
[1:39:26] it's got to take the holy spirit a new
[1:39:29] a new birth
[1:39:30] a regeneration a new creature
[1:39:34] not a passed up job see as long as
[1:39:37] you're sanctified you're going to feel
[1:39:39] patched up
[1:39:41] but when god comes and change the full
[1:39:43] nature of you
[1:39:44] that's the whole thing
[1:39:46] you understand me
[1:39:47] we
[1:39:48] we you know we still deal with too much
[1:39:50] self
[1:39:51] traveling through this in this station
[1:39:54] but but but we didn't have no problem
[1:39:56] with justification i think i think not
[1:39:58] right but you know there's a lot of
[1:39:59] people who's never been to calvary they
[1:40:01] don't know what justification is they
[1:40:04] don't see the suffering of their lord
[1:40:05] for them
[1:40:06] they don't understand we quoted oh he
[1:40:08] became our sin that we might become his
[1:40:10] righteousness but there is more to that
[1:40:13] it's excruciating what he did for you it
[1:40:16] you've got to understand the shame he
[1:40:18] went through for you
[1:40:20] and you must enter into that like like
[1:40:22] the prophet god said when you want
[1:40:23] somebody to heal you got to enter into
[1:40:25] their suffering you need to enter into
[1:40:27] the suffering of christ to underst it
[1:40:29] will cause you to reverence him
[1:40:31] it will cause you to love him
[1:40:34] hallelujah you think about the most pain
[1:40:36] you have ever endured and you still
[1:40:39] haven't touched what he had to go
[1:40:41] through at calvary
[1:40:43] and he did it for you and me
[1:40:46] amen
[1:40:48] you know bring us to a shame
[1:40:50] because you got to understand he was
[1:40:52] naked so that we can be clothed
[1:40:55] now i know what they do on those
[1:40:56] pictures and they put a little wrap
[1:40:58] little thing around his garment he looks
[1:41:00] his way but listen he had nothing he was
[1:41:03] totally exposed
[1:41:07] for who
[1:41:08] god on earth
[1:41:10] god
[1:41:11] the holy
[1:41:14] holies of all holies
[1:41:16] was put to shame for you and me
[1:41:19] and that's what isaiah said we we looked
[1:41:21] on him like it was us
[1:41:24] huh
[1:41:27] we don't know what his grief and sorrows
[1:41:29] was
[1:41:30] but he did it just for you
[1:41:32] you said well what do you mean just
[1:41:34] think about it think about the time when
[1:41:36] god was getting ready to destroy sodom
[1:41:38] and gomorrah and then god at the same
[1:41:40] time was dealing with abraham and then
[1:41:41] abraham couldn't have a seed right
[1:41:44] and then god says i'm going to visit you
[1:41:47] according to the time of life
[1:41:49] who did he come to
[1:41:51] who did he come to
[1:41:53] he came to miss abraham
[1:41:57] amen he came to his wife
[1:42:02] he impregnated her
[1:42:04] oh god
[1:42:07] oh my god do you really think brother
[1:42:09] brandon was trying to tell you something
[1:42:11] when he said never have there been in
[1:42:13] the time of history a man named with the
[1:42:16] last name or last part of his name ham
[1:42:20] what was he trying to tell he was trying
[1:42:22] to tell you the same day abraham was
[1:42:24] living in now we're living in and god is
[1:42:26] now impregnating a woman
[1:42:29] with who his seed
[1:42:32] bringing her to a place where she can
[1:42:35] have his image and his likeness
[1:42:38] she failed but now she's being
[1:42:40] resurrected
[1:42:41] hallelujah she'll not fall like the eve
[1:42:44] before no sir she's been ordained to
[1:42:48] stand on the word and produce that word
[1:42:50] and though we be few in number
[1:42:53] it'll not come back forward
[1:42:57] this is not about a group
[1:43:00] or sect or cult or click or whatever you
[1:43:03] might want to call it this is an
[1:43:05] individual affair
[1:43:08] thank god for william branham
[1:43:13] amen
[1:43:15] you love the lord
[1:43:17] now you got to understand what i'm going
[1:43:18] where i'm going with this and i'm almost
[1:43:20] done i know it's a wednesday night so i
[1:43:21] tried my best not to be too long and i
[1:43:23] probably have been too long already but
[1:43:25] just give me a few more minutes okay
[1:43:30] the problem is we underestimate the
[1:43:32] devil
[1:43:35] we take him for granted we
[1:43:37] we don't even we try you know we almost
[1:43:39] don't pay him no attention the whole
[1:43:40] time he's working on you
[1:43:47] yeah you better watch out the bible said

[1:44:31] that's the only way you'll be able to
[1:44:32] stand against the wiles of the devil

[1:44:38] hallelujah you know what i'm going to
[1:44:40] tell you something
[1:44:41] i don't have all of my teeth
[1:44:46] because i took them for granted
[1:44:49] you don't wash them and keep them clean
[1:44:51] guess what
[1:44:52] they gonna rot
[1:44:54] there's always a penalty for it
[1:44:57] neglect you understand what i'm trying
[1:44:59] to say
[1:45:00] you neglect to stay
[1:45:02] you can't this is your salvation this is
[1:45:05] this is your hope this is your faith
[1:45:07] this is what you live for this is what
[1:45:10] we live for there's no you know what i'm
[1:45:12] trying to say we all have that period of
[1:45:15] time where we neglect
[1:45:18] but a wake up out of your sleep
[1:45:20] now it's hard time to wake
[1:45:23] out of the sleep amen
[1:45:25] let's go on i got a couple of quotes and
[1:45:27] then i'll be done
[1:45:29] here in the message israel in the church
[1:45:31] and he says watch it
[1:45:33] it's moving right out today in a
[1:45:36] terrible force
[1:45:38] y'all heard that terrible force oh it
[1:45:41] behooves you
[1:45:43] my brother sister to consider what
[1:45:46] you're listening at
[1:45:48] and don't you never
[1:45:50] underestimate satan's power for
[1:45:52] deceiving
[1:45:56] don't you never underestimate him
[1:45:59] he's smooth as can be
[1:46:02] and the antichrist spirit isn't
[1:46:04] communism no the antichrist spirit is so
[1:46:08] close like the real thing
[1:46:10] it'll deceive the very elect if possible
[1:46:14] jesus says so matthew 24 it's a
[1:46:17] religious spirit oh why cain and abel
[1:46:20] were brothers the crow and the doves
[1:46:23] said on the same roof
[1:46:25] esau and jacob were brothers judas and
[1:46:28] jesus was in the same church and that's
[1:46:31] what i'm talking about
[1:46:34] don't get discouraged when you see
[1:46:36] people acting unchristian like
[1:46:40] when they act unchristian like it is a
[1:46:42] spirit that makes them do that and i'm
[1:46:44] not trying to say that they're the crow
[1:46:47] but it is not when it's not the holy
[1:46:49] you'll know it
[1:46:51] hallelujah the holy ghost does not
[1:46:53] behave itself unseemly
[1:46:55] and on the preacher
[1:47:00] on the preacher and the other one the
[1:47:03] treasure one excuse me one was the
[1:47:05] preacher and the other one was the
[1:47:06] treasure see there's always just
[1:47:08] deceiving the lie that came see now
[1:47:12] y'all preachers and and and trustees
[1:47:14] don't get nervous
[1:47:15] you know who you are
[1:47:17] that satan told eve see was 90
[1:47:22] truth
[1:47:23] 90
[1:47:25] truth
[1:47:26] and the lie that you can tell
[1:47:30] he says how i've heard men bypass pieces
[1:47:35] in the scripture
[1:47:36] just to keep from see it'll hurt their
[1:47:39] theology see
[1:47:41] but if this part's right that part is
[1:47:44] right too
[1:47:45] let's put it together and make it fit
[1:47:47] through the whole bible
[1:47:50] see what i'm trying to say is that even
[1:47:53] in this message and this is the truth
[1:47:55] maybe i'm misunderstanding something but
[1:47:58] we cut pieces out of it to fit our
[1:48:00] theology
[1:48:02] you know people have gotten so lazy they
[1:48:04] don't want to pray people through the
[1:48:05] holy ghost
[1:48:07] now if you go to to the message brother
[1:48:09] branham speaks about praying with the
[1:48:12] people
[1:48:14] oh we're beyond that we got the holy
[1:48:16] ghost without sensation so that's okay
[1:48:19] if you got it without sensation where is
[1:48:20] the life of christ i want to see that
[1:48:23] don't give me part of the word and not
[1:48:25] give me the whole thing amen
[1:48:28] hallelujah i believe that when i see
[1:48:30] jesus working through you
[1:48:33] right
[1:48:34] and we know what the pentecostals did
[1:48:36] they did make it a a a sensation but
[1:48:39] folks we've got to go beyond that
[1:48:43] hallelujah into that holy places where
[1:48:45] god must come
[1:48:49] but people have gotten so much now i
[1:48:51] remember when i first came to the
[1:48:52] message folks people were shouting and
[1:48:54] dancing and speaking in tongues and
[1:48:55] running around and you know and living
[1:48:57] the life
[1:48:59] they were living it
[1:49:00] you know what i mean now you find people
[1:49:02] it's done got so quiet and still you
[1:49:04] think it's methodist in the message
[1:49:08] they ain't doing nothing
[1:49:11] nobody'll come in here and think you
[1:49:12] drunk enough wine
[1:49:15] but that was the original church
[1:49:20] it's originally supposed to be the same
[1:49:22] maybe i got it mixed up but what people
[1:49:24] have done they've cut that part out two
[1:49:28] two two so they can magnify their
[1:49:30] intellectual conception of the message
[1:49:33] and it doesn't paul said you can
[1:49:35] understand all mysteries and have not
[1:49:38] charity and you know they don't have
[1:49:40] charity because they fight among each
[1:49:42] other
[1:49:50] yet we follow that and we got a message
[1:49:54] because we hate to be different
[1:49:57] but brother brannon was different
[1:49:59] he didn't go with the flow
[1:50:01] and if it wasn't the word he didn't
[1:50:03] stand with it
[1:50:05] i'm not against anybody but i'm i'm i
[1:50:07] will give an account before god for you
[1:50:11] and what i preached to you amen and i
[1:50:13] can remember when brother brandon went
[1:50:14] behind the curtain of time i mean when
[1:50:16] he saw his wife up there right remember
[1:50:18] she said brother bill the very message
[1:50:20] you preach
[1:50:22] is the message of the holy ghost
[1:50:24] and he said what she said whatever you
[1:50:26] do don't stop preaching the holy ghost
[1:50:30] huh
[1:50:32] listen we know the prophet kept warning
[1:50:34] us he said those people out there in
[1:50:36] hollywood made this thing a social
[1:50:38] gospel and look what we got now that
[1:50:41] thing has so infiltrated the
[1:50:43] denominational churches now all they are
[1:50:45] is a social gospel you come to church
[1:50:47] we're gonna we're gonna entertain you
[1:50:49] we're gonna play you this music we're
[1:50:51] gonna have you feeling good
[1:50:53] and i know a church now amen there go
[1:50:55] and have bible study with a big cup of
[1:50:58] wine or cup of beer
[1:51:03] don't look crazy
[1:51:05] people in the message drink
[1:51:08] yeah they do
[1:51:11] they get they whine and they drink they
[1:51:13] whine
[1:51:14] oh don't tell that brother brooks yeah
[1:51:16] i'm telling it
[1:51:19] because the truth is the truth where's
[1:51:21] the holy ghost in that
[1:51:24] i had a brother called me to uh
[1:51:25] yesterday he called me yesterday oh
[1:51:27] brother from down south don't even
[1:51:29] believe in the
[1:51:30] message no more and i don't know why he
[1:51:32] told me this but he did he said you know
[1:51:34] what he said before my wife died she
[1:51:36] used to get on me all the time she said
[1:51:37] because they he said i would drink me a
[1:51:39] glass of wine every night again
[1:51:43] i preach i
[1:51:45] i just got quiet
[1:51:49] he said she said he he told she told me
[1:51:51] he said i know the bible said if you
[1:51:53] keep doing that it's going to make
[1:51:54] mockery and i'm thinking right now it's
[1:51:55] making mockery right now
[1:51:57] but you know people do it
[1:52:00] and they don't see i can't do that
[1:52:01] because i was raised up around
[1:52:03] alcoholics
[1:52:04] you know and i was delivered from
[1:52:05] alcohol so i can't do all of that
[1:52:08] but i know what it is
[1:52:10] and i know the pool
[1:52:12] and i know how to be delivered
[1:52:16] but you get people and they just they
[1:52:18] don't understand the devil is smarter
[1:52:20] than what you think
[1:52:22] because you never know the day that
[1:52:24] things say i got you now
[1:52:27] that's what happened to me i didn't know
[1:52:28] the day
[1:52:30] but until i got saved i found out he had
[1:52:33] me
[1:52:36] came from a line of alcoholic drug
[1:52:37] addicts and everything else you name it
[1:52:39] i'm not a i i i i tell the truth like
[1:52:42] the prophet of god say i'm ashamed of it
[1:52:44] but i tell you the truth
[1:52:45] you love the lord
[1:52:47] let's move on y'all love the lord
[1:52:49] i don't know what time it is but if you
[1:52:51] need to go that's okay see one was the
[1:52:53] preacher the other one was the church dc
[1:52:55] and they're all just deceiving the lie
[1:52:58] that came that satan told eve was 99 90
[1:53:02] truth all right right but listen
[1:53:05] we must stand for the whole bible
[1:53:08] even if you put it back in the ark in
[1:53:10] the destruction of the world there was
[1:53:12] the crow and the dove sitting on the
[1:53:14] same roost one was just as much a
[1:53:17] a bird as the other one was is that
[1:53:20] right but what was it one was a crow
[1:53:23] nature and the other one was a dub by
[1:53:25] nature one could fly
[1:53:28] just like the other one won and that's
[1:53:30] why people are having so many troubles
[1:53:31] in their lives because their nature
[1:53:33] haven't been changed
[1:53:35] brother said a lot of times people
[1:53:36] confuse that new new spirit with the
[1:53:39] holy ghost he said that new spirit is
[1:53:42] given to you just
[1:53:44] you can cope with the word
[1:53:46] but that ain't the holy ghost
[1:53:48] the whole it is a portion of the holy
[1:53:50] ghost but the holy ghost come to change
[1:53:52] you
[1:53:53] your nature like
[1:53:55] the word of god says you know i'm a new
[1:53:56] creature in christ all things are passed
[1:53:59] away behold all come new right in the
[1:54:02] new world you won't see one thing
[1:54:05] that will remind you of this one
[1:54:09] everything in the new world will be
[1:54:11] totally different brother brown said
[1:54:13] that is the kind of baptism of the holy
[1:54:15] ghost and fire that you and i as a
[1:54:17] believer supposed to have
[1:54:19] hey
[1:54:20] and if we're not there yet it's time to
[1:54:23] wake up
[1:54:25] amen all of us amen need more god but we
[1:54:29] need to press toward the mark of a high
[1:54:31] calling paul said the life that i now
[1:54:33] live
[1:54:35] showing that there was a time that he
[1:54:36] once lived a life that was acceptable
[1:54:39] according to the law but it wasn't
[1:54:41] acceptable to god matter of fact he said
[1:54:43] i was blameless but now paul said i die
[1:54:47] daily
[1:54:49] huh and if you're going to live you've
[1:54:51] got to die daily you got to examine
[1:54:54] yourself every day you got to die
[1:54:58] somebody says well how do you die where
[1:55:00] you know what your will is you refuse to
[1:55:02] do it that's how you die
[1:55:05] amen
[1:55:06] because most of your will is just built
[1:55:08] upon habits anyway they said take about
[1:55:10] seven days to break a habit
[1:55:12] i don't know but listen
[1:55:14] if you want to resist the devil that's
[1:55:16] how you do it
[1:55:20] you say it ain't possible let me tell
[1:55:22] you it is i had a man get in my face he
[1:55:24] wanted to fight me and i'm almost done
[1:55:26] he had a man who wanted to fight me
[1:55:28] taller than i was six five or so all in
[1:55:31] my faith
[1:55:33] and you know what he even winning and um
[1:55:38] said he was going to get his gun
[1:55:41] well i had some well-respected people
[1:55:44] with me at that time so i took them home
[1:55:46] and i came back and
[1:55:50] knocked on his door
[1:55:52] and he came to the door
[1:55:54] and i had to look up to see his face
[1:55:58] you know what i told him i said i want
[1:55:59] you to know
[1:56:01] i'm not afraid of you
[1:56:04] he said i know that you're not
[1:56:08] now come on somebody there was nobody
[1:56:09] around now
[1:56:11] but i was not afraid of him i knew who i
[1:56:13] know who i am
[1:56:15] so i said i want you to know i'm not
[1:56:16] afraid of you he said i know that you're
[1:56:18] not i said listen let me tell you
[1:56:20] something
[1:56:21] i said before the lord changed me he
[1:56:23] changed me
[1:56:24] i said because there was a time you
[1:56:26] wouldn't have gotten away with what you
[1:56:27] just did
[1:56:28] come on somebody it don't make no giants
[1:56:31] fall
[1:56:32] they fall just like short folks
[1:56:36] and i have been taught when somebody's
[1:56:39] taller than you go for the knees
[1:56:44] just not trying to tell you how to do
[1:56:46] things but but my point is
[1:56:49] you don't you know it doesn't matter and
[1:56:51] i learned because i came up pretty much
[1:56:53] in the if you say in the hood the more
[1:56:56] people they say oh he ain't doing
[1:56:57] nothing
[1:56:59] people do all that talking they scared
[1:57:02] anyway
[1:57:04] if you gonna fight you don't waste words
[1:57:06] you just go for it
[1:57:08] but nevertheless i i told him that
[1:57:10] and from that day i pretty much got
[1:57:12] respected you know
[1:57:14] but my point is i witnessed to him
[1:57:17] and i told him i said listen
[1:57:19] the lord jesus changed me
[1:57:22] and just like he changed me
[1:57:24] he can change you
[1:57:26] and then i walked off the porch
[1:57:31] if you're gonna have a confrontation
[1:57:33] don't leave jesus out
[1:57:35] don't let don't walk away and let the
[1:57:37] devil get the victory
[1:57:40] right
[1:57:41] you somehow even if you acted ugly for
[1:57:43] the moment
[1:57:45] repent
[1:57:46] and make it right
[1:57:47] because you don't want listen you don't
[1:57:49] know when you're going to die or when
[1:57:51] that person is gonna die see satan
[1:57:53] whenever he calls his things as the
[1:57:56] prophet god said is somehow he's
[1:57:58] benefiting from it
[1:58:00] so you don't want him to benefit from
[1:58:02] nothing
[1:58:03] you shut him
[1:58:04] down hallelujah the prophet god said the
[1:58:08] church is perfected through
[1:58:10] justification sanctification and the
[1:58:12] baptism of the holy ghost there you go
[1:58:15] you're not even perfect until then amen
[1:58:18] he said then you're sealed until the day
[1:58:21] of your redemption
[1:58:22] and he's that once purged by the blood
[1:58:25] of jesus christ has no more desire of
[1:58:27] sin you pass from death
[1:58:31] unto life
[1:58:32] paul said i am crucified
[1:58:34] with christ
[1:58:35] nevertheless i live
[1:58:37] yet not i but christ liveth in me see
[1:58:41] the the you know we can't allow the mess
[1:58:43] of the word just to be poetic
[1:58:46] it's gotta live and i'm done for tonight
[1:58:50] but listen
[1:58:52] how do you know
[1:58:54] you know what the dove is clean
[1:58:56] peaceful just study the dove you know
[1:59:00] the oil inside cleans it cleanses it
[1:59:03] and but this this uh crow
[1:59:06] can hang
[1:59:07] on the same roost
[1:59:09] and he could eat all that stuff
[1:59:12] of the world and say hallelujah praise
[1:59:14] the lord glory to god because remember
[1:59:17] the crow was on the boat
[1:59:22] the crow was in the boat
[1:59:23] jacob and esau was of the same family
[1:59:27] and did you know that judas and jesus
[1:59:28] came from the same tribe of judah
[1:59:32] all in the family
[1:59:35] and i'm telling you this is just the
[1:59:37] beginning folks what i'm trying to say
[1:59:39] is we've got a lot of pressing into
[1:59:41] we've got a lot of surrendering
[1:59:44] to do i'm not just preaching on you i'm
[1:59:46] talking about myself
[1:59:48] i have a i have a goal
[1:59:50] and i told the lord this morning and i
[1:59:53] told him but i mean just talking with
[1:59:54] him
[1:59:55] i'm gonna make it
[1:59:58] no matter what the cost
[2:00:00] you've got to lose everything i'm going
[2:00:02] to make it
[2:00:04] i've got to go by myself i'm going to
[2:00:05] make it
[2:00:08] i love people i hate to be rejected but
[2:00:10] i'm going to make it
[2:00:12] you understand me my lord was rejected
[2:00:15] and so if he could take it i can too
[2:00:17] amen i tell you like this people you
[2:00:20] can't go with the flow the majority of
[2:00:21] the people because this message church
[2:00:23] is doing this and them listen this is
[2:00:25] time to focus
[2:00:27] on you
[2:00:28] not on everything else on you
[2:00:32] making sure you got the good you know we
[2:00:34] don't ever want to come up and say lord
[2:00:35] have not we done these things in your
[2:00:37] name no
[2:00:39] that's not us
[2:00:41] we are the one we are the ones where he
[2:00:43] says
[2:00:44] enter into the joys of my love of the
[2:00:46] lord well done
[2:00:47] my good and faithful servant
[2:00:50] i came here to see a revival among the
[2:00:52] bride i've seen something happen in lime
[2:00:55] ohio don't tell me it can't happen i've
[2:00:57] seen the dead rays i've seen numerous
[2:01:00] people being healed i know it by this
[2:01:03] word by this word and young people
[2:01:04] believe in it
[2:01:07] but it was hard it was hard trying to
[2:01:09] get people into the spirit of god for
[2:01:11] them to see and i can't give you that
[2:01:12] revelation only god can give it to you
[2:01:15] but you need to pray and ask god said
[2:01:17] lord what is brother brooks trying to
[2:01:18] tell us what is
[2:01:20] is he telling us the truth and if he is
[2:01:22] show us what he's saying so we may enter

[2:01:28] uh really get on one accord we'll see
[2:01:30] god move in a mighty way

[2:01:34] others churches
[2:01:37] hello
[2:01:39] i'm telling you
[2:01:40] when even in the pentecostal realm when
[2:01:42] we would go to those churches that was
[2:01:45] like half the size of this room here
[2:01:48] a little shack you know the flow you
[2:01:50] know when you shout on it the whole
[2:01:51] thing rocked with you
[2:01:56] but
[2:01:57] we had a glorious time
[2:02:00] yeah so i can see it now i can feel it
[2:02:02] now oh i never shouted so much in my
[2:02:04] life
[2:02:09] but that's all we had but it was good
[2:02:12] then god brought us to this place and
[2:02:15] and supposed to be jumping by now
[2:02:19] i've seen it and i know it can be
[2:02:21] and i'm trusting that it will i promise
[2:02:23] the lord if nobody else in the church is
[2:02:25] going to do it i will if i become a
[2:02:27] spectacle don't don't don't look at me
[2:02:30] like i'm stupid
[2:02:31] because i'm going to entertain my lord
[2:02:34] and i'm going to give him what he
[2:02:35] deserves

[2:06:12] [Music]
[2:06:14] brother branham talk about a short quick
[2:06:16] message
[2:06:20] i believe there's a time
[2:06:22] there's something coming
[2:06:24] and everybody think they know
[2:06:28] all about it
[2:06:33] but they don't everybody don't know
[2:06:36] they talk about that secret catching
[2:06:38] away
[2:06:39] everybody won't know about that
[2:06:42] even those around us who think they know
[2:06:44] because it's a secret it's going to be
[2:06:46] given to individuals
[2:06:49] and i trust that by god's grace that he
[2:06:51] would
[2:06:52] count me worthy
[2:06:54] father god as we come before you lord
[2:06:56] and we pray oh god for my brother
[2:06:59] keith lord that you would purge and
[2:07:02] clean hallelujah him lord tonight

[2:07:17] [Music]
[2:07:18] likewise

[2:07:24] that your holy spirit would have prayed
[2:07:26] hallelujah in me in such a way i'll be a
[2:07:29] walk in jesus
[2:07:30] bless us now blessed
[2:07:33] in jesus
[2:07:36] christ amen
[2:07:40] [Music]
[2:07:44] you're making too much out of it no i'm
[2:07:46] not
[2:07:48] i'm not making enough of it
[2:07:53] i listen i listen to that message
[2:07:55] brother and who says why am i a holy
[2:07:57] roller
[2:07:58] [Music]
[2:07:59] may god be merciful
[2:08:01] father we pray right now for my precious
[2:08:04] brother isaac lord that you be merciful
[2:08:06] to us we pray father that your holy
[2:08:09] spirit would purge and cleanse him lord
[2:08:11] from all iniquity any every unbelief
[2:08:14] lord that he'll come to that perfect
[2:08:16] stature of christ
[2:08:18] lord god and that you will seal him in
[2:08:20] such a way father that people will know
[2:08:22] that there has been a major change
[2:08:24] [Music]
[2:08:26] in jesus christ
[2:08:27] [Music]
[2:08:35] so you'll understand what i'm saying
[2:08:38] when it comes to
[2:08:41] the ephesian church they had all the
[2:08:42] gifts
[2:08:44] they heard the character of christ
[2:08:46] they were the seed
[2:08:48] but they were not those who would be
[2:08:50] translated at the time because the the
[2:08:52] alpha the maker had not come
[2:08:54] this is the uh the the same seed as i
[2:08:58] preached the other night more of it
[2:09:01] and so
[2:09:02] what we must see
[2:09:04] is what they saw in the days of ephesus
[2:09:07] or even if you want to say in the days
[2:09:09] of william branno
[2:09:10] you know
[2:09:12] we must see more
[2:09:13] and people say it won't be an open show
[2:09:15] we know that
[2:09:17] it's not been one
[2:09:18] but then even among ourselves we should
[2:09:21] have testimonies
[2:09:23] right
[2:09:24] of what god is doing and what god can do
[2:09:26] and what what what he's doing for us
[2:09:30] like i said by god's grace he allowed me
[2:09:33] to
[2:09:34] be able to see
[2:09:35] the dead raised twice
[2:09:37] and and i thank god for that
[2:09:40] i didn't deserve it
[2:09:41] you know i don't deserve it i still
[2:09:43] don't but it ain't me it's him and when
[2:09:46] you see those things and you know what
[2:09:48] god can do
[2:09:50] you know what god can do
[2:09:53] this is not a
[2:09:55] uh some mystic thing this is reality
[2:09:58] and we see that
[2:09:59] and that's what we're trying to bring to
[2:10:01] people here in this church but you know
[2:10:03] when you see people hardly ever coming
[2:10:05] to church
[2:10:06] then when they come to church on sundays
[2:10:08] they come all late there's a revelation
[2:10:10] something's lacking
[2:10:12] their understanding we're talking about
[2:10:14] coming to meet god
[2:10:16] people don't understand they it's just
[2:10:18] too much carnality he said brother you
[2:10:20] shouldn't look at it yes it's the truth
[2:10:23] but you know what jesus always keeps his
[2:10:25] appointments
[2:10:26] he's never late he's always on time
[2:10:29] right most of the time he's waiting on
[2:10:31] us
[2:10:32] i just want to see people love the lord
[2:10:34] like he deserved to be loved
[2:10:38] that's all
[2:10:39] may god have mercy on all of us and may
[2:10:42] he continue to bless us
[2:10:44] and strengthen us
[2:10:46] because we need him
[2:10:47] [Music]
[2:10:50] we need it
