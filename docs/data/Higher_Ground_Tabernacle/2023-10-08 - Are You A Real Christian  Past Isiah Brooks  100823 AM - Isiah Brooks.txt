brothera and his group we're just going to minister a little bit this morning we want him to say something today if if the Lord will have him to inform you we have some baptisms this morning uh so we we're going to try to just go through this and basically uh get out of the way trusting that the Lord will bless you this morning I I love the Lord and I appreciate him uh for everyone who was here I want you to to keep in mind this is not uh brothera group this is not brother Brooks's group uh we stand together as the Bride of Jesus Christ and by one body one Spirit of we baptized into one body and so we may differ in some ways but if we all have the Holy Ghost and we are listening to the message of this hour that will bring us into Perfection then we are Blood Brothers hallelujah hallelujah I have one scripture that I'd like for you to turn with me to Second Corinthians 3 and 2 and then Hebrews 1 14 second Corinthians 3 and two it reads ye are our Epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men I I want you to know where the epistle is [Music] written it's written in the heart hallelujah hallelujah uh we ask that you turn with us now to Hebrews and it reads are they not all ministering Spirits sent forth for to minister for them who shall be hes of Salvation hallelujah hallelujah I'm going to ask you turn one more scripture please Proverbs 23 and 7 we'll read the first portion of that scripture and then we'll pray and have you be seated for as he thinketh in his heart so is he for as he thinketh in his heart so is he let us pray our gracious father God we thank thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and all that you do for us we pray Lord God this morning that you would bless the word of God bless it so much so Lord that it would take root and anchor in our souls Lord that when we leave here this morning we will leave here closer to you than we were before we came bless each and every heart Lord I pray and bind every spirit in this assembly that's not like you uh in the name of Jesus Christ Lord let your uh have free course that we may glorify you in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen you may be seated I have I I want to read a quote First by the prophet of God brother Brandon preached a message in 1962 uh 319 the end time sign seed and I'm only throwing this quote at you because there are so many people who can't see the time that we're living in hopefully we'll be able to grasp something this morning that that that will cause a concern and a fire to burn within our souls uh when we look at the condition of the Bride of Jesus Christ and we know the scripture says that we ought to be on fire for God uh but when we see uh uh that there is something wrong there is no real worship everything has become systematic programmed and that's not the original Church the original church has always been moved by the Holy Spirit her response to him has always been a response of Joy a response of peace and a response of love we're not living in an age where it is touched not taste not and handle not we're not living under the law uh there is a law that we do live under and that law is love but it is divine love and so as Christians we live the life that we live because we love God hallelujah hallelujah and y'all can say Amen to the word I'm going to preach it anyway brother random says disasters everywhere California Los Angeles like to wash into the to the ocean what is it beginning of Sorrows earthquakes have picked up everywhere why is it five stars come in [Music] line Grace God's grace what happened an infant Church Hallelujah a bride now I I want to stress brother said an infant Church Hallelujah a bride infancy that the power of God has begun to fall on her she is taking form a bride for this bridegroom that three Stars meant his Perfection of the heavenly father of the Trinity becoming one on earth Among Us God offices becoming one office what happens now it's the Church of the Living God coming together under the word of God and the astronomical Heaven is announcing her approach amen might not believe that but it's the word just the same yes sir and that's been 61 years ago when this message was preached it is 2023 and if my math is correct it's later than what we think the saddest situation that I am now embracing is that the world in itself they are joining together Hallelujah to bring what a persecution on the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah but what are we doing where are we in the symphony where are we in this drama one thing I know the Bible says the Bride made herself ready hallelujah hallelujah my question this morning who are you what are you Hallelujah are you a real Christian hallelujah hallelujah or are you a fake hello I want you to think this morning because being a Christian doesn't mean joining an organization it does not mean joining a group it does not even mean joining the message because we've got a lot of message joiners people who have joined the message but have never had a born again experience Hallelujah and if you haven't had a born again experience Hallelujah you are just a potential Christian hallelujah hallelujah what are you going to do brother Brandon preached a message on the token and he said that was the greatest of all his messages Hallelujah you know why you can understand all Mysteries and have not charity it profits you nothing hallelujah hallelujah I mean people of God this is a time of urgency it is a time of desperation but many of us have allowed Satan to cool us off to distract us to make us think in ways that we shouldn't be thinking your focus should be on the coming of the Lord and being obedient Hallelujah and we say all the seals are open Hallelujah the mighty angel came down Hallelujah but what are you doing did he come just to show off he came to make a change Hallelujah he came to pull a bride and out of denominations and to bring her up to the Statue of a perfect man hallelujah hallelujah where are you in the Statue Paul said examine yourself to see whether you be in the faith one thing I've learned also is that we love God in our minds but in our hearts we don't know him my question is do you know him as a True Believer do you know him I could tell you this morning that Joe Biden joid is a president of the United States I can tell you this morning that William br was the seventh angel Messengers to our our age I can tell you that but I don't know hello I don't know brother Joe Biden I know of him I can tell you things about him I can tell you things I like about him I can tell you things I do not like about him but that does not mean I know him Hallelujah Hallelujah and in this age God does not wink at ignorance the word of God has been open to us hallelujah and you and I know that the prophet of God said that his message was to dress the bride how well are you dressed Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying I want you to understand we did not brother Bram did not come to establish another religion Hallelujah huj he had a mission and that mission as a brother said last week was to find Rebecca Hallelujah to find a bride for Isaac hallelujah hallelujah the one thing that I love about is that she had character y'all hear what I'm saying she had character so much so she was able to hear the voice that eler heard what do you mean brother Brooks God revealed to her Hallelujah without Ela telling her she not only watered the camels she watered the men as well or to say it like this she did not only water the men she water the camel now where did she get that Revelation from hallelujah it's because she had a connection with God and as brother Bram says God works on both ends what are you called for we did not we we were not we're not called to be another denomination or another organization but we ourselves carry the spirit of denomination you said brother books don't say that I'll say it again because when these two groups come together there should never be a funny feeling but I can feel what you feel y'all hear what I'm saying it shows that within yourself you have denominated it yourself Hallelujah huj I know what I'm talking about brother said like this when the squeeze come on you'll forget about it you ask a person what church they belong to and neither will you find out what denomination they are you will be so glad to see a real Christian standing in that hour hallelujah hallelujah when when brother and I get together to Fellowship I don't have no funny feelings and he doesn't have no funny feelings if he did I would feel it I would know that y'all hear what I'm saying and my point is this when you got the Holy Ghost you don't care what the person look like you're so glad to see somebody that's got the same quickening power that you have hallelujah hallelujah whether we realize it or not we're going to spend eternity with each other so we might as well start now hallelujah hallelujah now how many of you going to tell God who he's going to allow in heaven so you can understand God made that decision before the foundation so you can't put me in you can't take me out hallelujah hallelujah let me move on because we must understand we have been called to be the word hallelujah hallelujah I'm going say it again we have been called to be the word for this hour let's say it like this we have been called to be the message of this hour is that right Paul said we are living Epistles written and read Hallelujah by all men so when I read you what am I reading all I'm supposed to see when I see you is Jesus Christ that's it hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord in time sign seed paragraph 21 he said he is the word he is the word and when you receive the word you receive Jesus for he is the word the word was made flesh dwelt among us we believe that don't we every bit we believe that Christ is God's word made manifest and we believe that his bride must be the same thing we believe that she must believe every bit of the word and have that word in her because she is a part of the body she is the body where he is the head hallelujah hallelujah now let me let me say it like this if I didn't have a head my body wouldn't know what to do but because of my head because in my head it's my brain it's my mind and my mind tells me what to do Hallelujah this is right and we know that the head stone is come down Hallelujah we have no right to think our own thoughts Hallelujah the Bible says let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus Hallelujah who thought it right who thought thought it not robbery to be equal with God hallelujah you understand me but as long as you have your mind you will never reach the level Christianity God want the mind of God is Not Earthly it's Heavenly Hallelujah and the Bible says let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus hallelujah hallelujah y you understand what I'm saying you have been called to a higher calling Hallelujah your calling is higher than Hallelujah hallu you have been called to the Capstone age where God can come and occupy your body through your mind rule your thoughts rule your affections he is the ruler he is Lord over you that's what we come for but there are so many people who not willing to surrender the victory in this message is not trying to make yourself something the victory of this message is humility humbling yourself hallelujah hallelujah now you might think you you might think you know more than I do some of you I know you do but I don't care what you think you hear me the reason being I know who I am you must know who you are I know where I came from and I know where I'm going you must know that hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord who could have outdone uh who could have out uh uh done Paul in his ministry you had 11 disciples who walked with Jesus talk with Jesus is that right I mean fellowship with Jesus saw Jesus as a man and saw Jesus as God is that right so much so much so the word of God said we handled him I love that we Fellowship we I handled him you know what I'm saying John could even say I laid in his bosom Hallelujah but guess what all of them had to be born again can you imagine the experience that John had laying in the bosom of Jesus hallelujah hallelujah the anointing that surrounded that man's body he no doubt felt like he was in Heavenly places Hallelujah but then John still John still had to go to Pentecost he still had to be born again hallelujah thank God for a prophet because he tells us that when we get born again that just the beginning of the journey and a lot of us we've had experiences but we're not [Music] moving there's no increase of Joy there's no increase of sincerity there those who who so so many habits that needs to die let me tell you something I believe it the way the prophet said if you truly have the Holy Ghost you can't wait to those Church doors open Hallelujah your alarm your alarm clock is not the motivator of you being on time no y'all don't like when I go there because I don't care how faithful you say you are if you can't find time to be on time I'm not talking about those who just working and stuff but those of you who have the time to be on time and still you come late Hallelujah there's something wrong with your Holy Ghost your experience I don't come to see you I come to see God one more thing before I go to the next Mo God I want you to use me but if you're faithful to that half hour a prayer that you supposed to give God at service surprised where God will take you from if you're faithful unto the little Hallelujah he would then give you much hallelujah hallelujah you know what if somebody came to my job if I was an employer and someone came to my job I've employed them are you employed you are employed God has call you to work and you show up late I would fire you constantly constantly late and I told you this last week every one of us will give an account for being slack every one of us we give an account if you grieve the Holy Ghost you will have to give an account hallelujah hallelujah let me go on I was pull back there but I want people to realize that you don't have to tell me whether you got the holy ghost or not your behavior tells me the word is God let him be Lord and God this is the end time SE sign is that right when we saw William brandham In the Flesh we saw a sar we saw a man who God put a word in him that would only catch the elect those amen who have been predestinated and ordained to make the Bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah and those who have been ordained to be the Bride of Jesus Christ she becomes the word hallelujah when she see Mary she when she sees Mary she sees herself somebody help me here when see joshu way she sees herself Hallelujah when she sees David she sees herself people say well I can't praise God like that when I see David I see me oh is that right she becomes the word he is the alpha he is the Omega the beginning he's the end and every one of those scriptures have been laid there for the Bride of Jesus Christ for her to see who she really is hallelujah hallelu that's right when I see David conquering Goliath I see myself is that right because David had the same Holy Ghost the same anointing David had is the same anointing living in me and David had it with him but today he's not just with us he's in us hallelujah and when God is in you he's going to act like God he's going to walk like God he's going to talk like God why because he is God hallelujah hallelujah look what the prophet said so I never touched a child he talk praying for someone went right to the pull pit with the word and stayed right with the word and the word healed her so instantly until she got up and walked away he's talking about a child an 18yearold girl a man who has been sentenced to death because she has cancer but it was the word she heard and she believed the word hallelujah listen and she got up and walked away hallelujah it's all right now and living like anybody else can you find a trace of it anywhere never even touched the word or touched her the word went forth she healed the word and the word is God's life and God's power and the word is what does it the word heals the sick hallelujah what are you saying brother Brooks I'm saying that every minister is a ministering Spirit Hallelujah a ministering Spirit of fire s from God hallelujah and if you can believe the word when the preacher is preaching I don't care what your elet is hallelujah I don't care what afflictions you may have she is not the preacher but it's the power of God that comes through the preacher Hallelujah that same anointing Hallelujah that Elijah had is here today Hallelujah the same anointing the same power the same signs it's supposed to follow the bride are you the real Christian we want real Christians hallelujah hallelujah is that right I even heard the prophet of God say if you can get 10 people on One ACC he said the Rapture would take place 10 people and I'm preaching like this cuz I want those who's going to get baptized today you're not being baptized to a church hallelujah hallelujah I may baptize you but I you don't belong to me you belong to God y'all hear what I'm saying you got to understand many of us all we know is churchianity We join the We join the message we know how to act like message people supposed to but one thing I know that when you truly born again the Bible say you have unspeakable joy Hallelujah you have a peace and the Bible says remember he told that woman at the well you have water living water springing up into eternal life Hallelujah but some of us will come down in here and we think what brother Brook's trying to work my emotions I don't need to work your emotions Hallelujah the holy spirit is supposed to be your emotion hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so you know that when you come to Christ you come in a serious you know what I'm saying if you're not serious then that baptism will make you a false [Music] witness hallelujah hallelujah cuz when you go down in the name of Jesus Christ you come up to rise to walk in a newness of Life Hallelujah the old man is that baptism is showing you there something has changed and the old Man is dead and the new man wants to live Hallelujah I got to that before I needed to Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God if we could just see what the Lord is trying to get us to see he wants to be God in you fulfilling his thoughts in you he wants you to live in Heavenly places not on this Earth but we find Christians message Believers are so Earthly bound hardly ever think about Heaven until Sunday hallelujah hallelujah this is supposed to be a everyday Affair Hallelujah you understand me I'm a man and those of you who are women are women this is who we are this is what we are every day I don't have to think about what I must do as a man because I am a man so is it with someone who has God in them you don't have to think about what God does because the mind of Christ is in you he will lead you and guide you into all truth hallelujah hallelujah ministering spirit I just know one thing so many people will be surprised because I don't care how much message you know talk to everybody here if you don't have the quickening power you won't get up huh I just heard the brother brother Adam say that he said there are so many people say you just don't get the Holy Ghost like the the way they used to get it they say you don't have to go through all of that I told somebody I've told you before even as the prophet God says every birth is a mess when the women change their way of producing a a baby which they will never it is the order of God y'all hear what I'm saying ask any woman who have had babies how much fun is it no it ain't no fun when you are in labor agonize you go through it Hallelujah my wife don't mind me saying this but I was there with almost all my my my kids and when those pains would come I saw the way she would grip that bar I mean she was just ging because of the pain just and she wanted to hold my hand a certain way but I knew if I had given her my hand she was going to break it I saw the power I saw the force yall understand me something was working there as a man I couldn't comprehend Hallelujah but I saw something that a woman goes through Hallelujah nobody else can explain it Hallelujah but let me say it like this in the spiritual you got to go through something in order for Christ to be formed in you hallelujah hallelujah you're not going to get on your knees with some sweet prayer you got to agonized like Jesus did let me move on you love the Lord I'm almost done here yeah Philippians 2 phili I'm trying to get us to see something this is why the devil don't want us to have it he knows if we get it he is defeated and will be defeated hallelujah hallelujah he knows that you can say your bride all you want to but the devil is not afraid of what you say but when it comes to character he knows he can't deal with the character cuz he's met that character before Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying when you look at at Peter and he begins to describe to us the divine nature of God nobody not the Baptist not the Methodist not the Pentecostal they don't even know what that means Hallelujah huj but God has given us a revelation of what it is it's his divine nature and when that nature is in you you become God that's why the devil don't want you there you say Lord give me patience and y'all don't want patience because you know tribulation let me tell you something the suffering of this world canot be compared to the glory that God has in stored for it's worth every moment if you got to suffer suffer for the name of Jesus you'll be crowned Hallelujah with Glory at the end of the day Philippians 2 9 through1 it says wherefore God also have highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow and let me tell you something whether you bow here bow there you going to Bow Hallelujah of things in heaven of things in Earth and things under the earth oh my god when those Elders saw the lamb the Bible says they fell you know they fell to their faces they humbled themselves they threw their Crown because they realized everything they did on Earth wasn't by their power it was by the power of the Holy Ghost not by power not by might but by my spirit sh the Lord everything they accomplished was because of the Lamb Worthy is the Lamb why is a lamb hallelujah hallelujah you said well what do you mean see that's why I so love and appreciate the prophet of the hour brother BR because he was humble if anybody could have been puffed up Hallelujah and from testimonies they said when it came to brother you could never tell his enemies from his he loved his enemy just like he L Hallelujah hello somebody was that Christ in him Jesus loved Judas you couldn't even tell that he was a devil Jesus knew he was a devil allowed him to kiss him and still called him friend hallelujah hallelujah oh somebody mistreat you though I met a sister down in North Carolina North Carolina South Carolina I believe it was and I'm not going to tell you who she is but she no I'm Sor yeah no no no it was Li Ohio and I she knew some people here and there and she said oh yeah I know everything that goes on and I'm thinking to myself you know better than I do what is it people you'll never bring you'll never come to conf Perfection gossiping and [Music] backbiting let me say it like this you gossip you backbite one another that's not the spirit of Jesus Christ and when you are anointed with that Spirit it is not the Holy Ghost it is the devil because he knows A House Divided cannot stand yeah y'all saying amen okay may the word of God convict you every time you open your mouth saying stuff that you ain't got no business say hallelujah y'all love me now right that's like I tell people you won't make Heaven if you don't you got to love me you don't even have a choice and I got to love you too every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess Hallelujah am I is something wrong with me now I'm I'm going go ahead and finish it I can't read just scripture scripture but listen Jesus prayed that the glory we have from the beginning I I want those who believe in me that have the same Glory what was the glory god was in Christ hallelujah what is the glory god is in you Hallelujah yall understand me and when God is in you Hallelujah you are the word of God for this day Hallelujah youall understand me I believe in miracles I believe in signs I believe in wonders but I also believe in change cuz you can have change you can have all these things but if you have not changed since you declared to be a Christian something's wrong with your experience Hallelujah there is no way you can live off of this manner and not be changed this manner this bread Hallelujah has come from the holies of holies it is from behind the veil Hallelujah and this man will change you you don't have to change yourself it will change you it will cause you to Blossom it will cause you to produce Blossom Hallelujah you love the Lord hallelujah hallelujah let me say it here in time SE sign he said it was a three it was a three of perfection showing that the Trinity of god father Son and Holy Ghost has made manifest in a [Music] man Jesus Christ the one perfect man all other men had failed everything else had died but here come a man that couldn't die Perfection that even death couldn't kill him he rose up again now look what his his his prayer was father I would that they be one even as we are one Hallelujah so when you have the father you have the son when you have the son you have the Holy Ghost so the Trinity of God it's manifested in you oh my God you see were you saying that's why Jesus had the ability to create Hallelujah that's why God gave the ability brother to create every son and daughter of God hallelujah if God is in you you have that same potential hallelujah hallelujah and I'm closing on this let the squeeze come I don't have to worry about the squeeze Hallelujah because the God who created The Squeeze is living in me is living in you Hallelujah and God at his appointed time will always Supply my needs why brother Brooks because I am bride and you must be bride too hallelujah hallelujah listen my last quote greatest battle ever fought paragraph 178 God is calling every Seed of Abraham this morning to that same kind of a life great battles is on now God wants his children separating themselves from what see taste smell feel smell hear imagination conscience memory reason affection everything open up their mind and let the word come in and March with the word that's a real Soldier you understand me a real Soldier amen has so surrendered to God can hear the commands of God is that right bride of Jesus Christ she'll know what to do with the word CU she follows orders hallelujah hallelujah I said one more let me say like this if Christ if ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sth on the right hand of God set your affection on things above and not on the things of the Earth for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God hallelujah hallelujah I could go on but let me say this by the grace of God people of God we will get the worst if we missed the Rapture or the changing of the body how miss the translation your own soul will torment you because your soul is always screaming out to you the right to do your own soul none of us want to miss it and there's not one person in here I would want to miss it but these are not my words even the prophet God said without the Holy Ghost you're not going to make it said that understand all Mysteries without charity it proit you nothing hallelujah hallelujah and but you got to put it put in your time right but Satan is going to keep you busy and so occupied till you won't have time for God right now if you got time you need to put your time in there's got to be so many changes that must take place in you're not going to to Heaven as a liar you're not going to go there a you're not going to go there as a fornicator bter all those natural things that we do won't be able to enter only those who are clothed in his righteousness sh into the gate you love the Lord I so appreciate God amen amen we'll come to the end I don't know if my brother want to say I asked him to brother if you would come you like to say something if you don't feel L it's fine okay okay so so uh I'm closing this of the service I didn't finish I didn't finish everything but I want to address once again those who are going to be baptized Hallelujah I know my brother Wesley is going to be baptized I don't know who else from brothera church that wants to be baptized but I had an option and one option was to do it at a hotel but I prefer the river okay we want to make sure that we don't we know that this is not it but we want to make sure if there be something on you it's going to keep flowing we know that's not the way it works but we we know that the river is a symbol of something your old past your past sins are washed away and they go to a place that you never see them again for those of you who are going to get baptized say this you'll never die you'll never go to hell for the sins that you were born in because they have forgiven you hallelujah hallelujah but as you become a Christian you're going to have failures you're going to fall and I'm I'm just saying because you you you're maturing you got to mature Paul say you got to grow up into him hallelujah hallelujah and so in that Journey you going to have battles where you're going to win some and lose some but when you realize that you are in the army of the Lord and you being trained by him and he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it hallelujah hallelujah she's the Bride of Jesus Christ understands the revelation of the word she's not baptized in the name of Father Son and the Holy Ghost because she realized that that those those are just titles Hallelujah but you're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ according to acts 238 where the Trinity becomes one three offices embodies one man who is Jesus Christ Our Lord he was the one crucified he was the one died and he's the one that rose from the dead I love this so when you see the grace of God and I want to encourage you never allow yourself to be clothed with the laws of this message if you get the Holy Ghost you will live it you understand me but we didn't come here to practice righteous we don't practice righteousness righteousness was given to us he became our sin that we might become the righteousness of righteousness is given to us by way of of of Calvary hallelujah hallelujah uh but you'll never hear a dog practicing how to bark he's a dog he knows how to B you'll never see a cow going to school going to school to learn how to give milk cows cow right that's what a cow does so when you're born again and truly really born again you don't have to teach somebody Holiness because the god in you is Holy and the Bible said he will teach you is that right when the prophet of God was in Africa and those native was naked when the Holy Ghost fell they all ran out to get their blankets to cover themselves what was that the teaching of the ho ghost and that's how it is today the Holy Ghost will always teach you write the word of God that's why you need it it's always so hard to be a Christian when when did it become hard it's not hard to be a Christian that's like a lamb it's so hard to be a lamb but how can it be that when that's all you've ever been when you truly born of God not hard to be a Christian the way is hard you got to suffer but with the Lamb's nature you know how to suffer you go through it and not run away like I feel sometimes hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord I'm just trying to encourage you you know we love the Lord uh I love this anointing and sometimes it's hard for me to pull out of it God amen amen let's sing yes Jesus love me as a song leader come so you agree the river every everybody
