[49:53] thank god for our precious brother amen
[50:00] amen
[50:07] good terms
[50:12] ah my size service again oh here i feel
[50:15] at home again now hey praise the lord
[50:18] now lord will we're just gonna dive into
[50:20] a little subject i thought the lord gave
[50:22] us to me about
[50:23] i was praying in between services like
[50:25] little rodeo i'm gonna go i was looking
[50:26] at this one look at this this is
[50:28] and then my i don't know i just felt
[50:29] comfortable right here so
[50:32] i hope this will be a blessing to you
[50:35] um because that's what we we just want
[50:39] to be a blessing we want to be edifying
[50:41] uh that's the main thing is even if we
[50:43] got one extra nugget to you then that's
[50:46] that's what we came to do if you're
[50:47] strengthened just a little bit
[50:49] you felt like you've got a blessing
[50:50] that's what you want to do so
[50:53] um tonight let's turn into the word of
[50:55] god in exodus
[50:56] 30 i'm gonna have uh one two
[51:02] we're gonna do a little bit of uh
[51:04] scriptures here just about five or six
[51:06] maybe
[51:06] and then we'll get into it okay i hope
[51:09] this is a blessing there's
[51:11] i taught this in akron and one brother
[51:12] said brother can i believe that i have
[51:14] that whole study i said sure so i sent
[51:15] it to him
[51:16] that was encouraging so it's uh if we
[51:19] could let's turn to
[51:20] exodus 34 verse one
[51:23] uh there i i i i was i was listening to
[51:26] service to the
[51:27] i was like to the message of the hour
[51:29] and uh something the prophet said just
[51:31] struck me and i was like
[51:33] and i just started thinking about all
[51:34] the scriptures and uh what was the point
[51:36] you know
[51:37] because god doesn't do anything for no
[51:39] reason
[51:40] there's always a specific reason he puts
[51:43] things in the scripture
[51:45] and there's always a specific reason why
[51:47] he does a certain thing
[51:49] and uh when i saw this i was like oh i
[51:53] just need to teach this and
[51:55] i don't know if the people have known it
[51:56] before or not and
[51:58] but anyhow we want to reiterate this by
[52:01] the grace of god in exodus 34 verse 1.
[52:06] excuse me and the lord said unto moses
[52:11] hew the two tables are spun a stone
[52:13] likened to the first
[52:15] and i will write upon these tables
[52:19] the words which were in the first tables
[52:21] which thou
[52:22] breaketh so here is god now
[52:26] same boys he said he said moses you
[52:27] broke the ten commandments
[52:29] the original section he said makes two
[52:31] more he says and i'll
[52:32] write it again all right he's gonna
[52:37] rewrite now go to first corinthians 14
[52:44] as i've teach things you know and and i
[52:47] trust me i'm 90
[52:48] time i'm i'm sitting right in those
[52:50] seats too as well so
[52:51] and as you sit there and hear the word
[52:53] or or maybe as i teach this it just
[52:55] becomes more and more alive
[52:56] every time and just uh it it it's just
[53:00] amazing to see that there is a book out
[53:02] there that's actually alive
[53:05] it's actually a spirit book right this
[53:07] is a spiritual
[53:09] mystery book hiding everything we need
[53:12] is
[53:12] right in here i heard a brother tell me
[53:14] he says ye he said brother did you ever
[53:16] think about how
[53:17] if we could look into heaven right now
[53:18] and i was like and i'm thinking you know
[53:20] you know i was thinking yeah he said
[53:21] brother just go like this
[53:24] and then this here we can actually get
[53:26] this is like a
[53:27] window of heaven and to look into there
[53:31] you have to do this so just look into
[53:33] your word and you're actually now seeing
[53:35] into the spiritual into the heaven
[53:37] and you can actually dive in there and
[53:39] leave this world for a little bit and
[53:41] see what all's involved
[53:42] what just by reading the word of god
[53:46] amen sorry for that first corinthians 14
[53:48] i don't want to hold you too long
[53:49] they're standing
[53:50] first corinthians 14 verse
[53:54] 36 now look what paul's writing here
[53:59] he says what came what came the word of
[54:01] god out from you
[54:03] or came it unto you only if any man
[54:06] think himself to be a prophet
[54:08] or even spiritual he says let him
[54:12] acknowledge
[54:13] that the things that i write notice
[54:16] paul's now writing these things
[54:17] by the inspiration holy ghost the things
[54:20] that i write unto you are the
[54:21] commandments
[54:22] of the lord amen so here now god has
[54:26] written first
[54:27] and now god is writing through a man
[54:29] right
[54:30] now go to revelations 1.
[54:35] sorry i was getting the nerves back
[54:37] there as
[54:38] standard um but now that i see it's a
[54:41] small crowd
[54:42] i'm calming calming calming coming so
[54:45] that's what we need right there um
[54:47] revelations 1
[54:49] verse 10. uh you know let's uh
[54:54] yeah yeah verse 10. notice saint john he
[54:58] says
[54:58] i was in the spirit that's capital s
[55:01] holy ghost
[55:02] in the anointing he was just in the in
[55:05] christ
[55:06] i was in the spirit on the lord's day
[55:08] and heard behind me a great voice out of
[55:10] a trumpet saying i
[55:11] am the alpha the omega the first and
[55:13] last and what thou
[55:14] see is he says right in a book
[55:18] so now here john god is using john now
[55:20] to write
[55:22] and send it unto the seven churches
[55:23] which are in asia ephesus smyrna
[55:25] pergamus
[55:26] the tiger sardius uh philadelphia and
[55:28] unto obviously laodicea and i just
[55:30] jumped that scripture sorry
[55:32] now let's continue on here in verse 19
[55:37] write the things which thou has seen and
[55:39] things which are and the things which
[55:40] shall be here
[55:41] after so here once again he's commanded
[55:43] to write
[55:45] one more scripture go to genesis 1 1.
[55:52] to me this this study right here is a
[55:54] fantastic
[55:57] and no interpreter so i can just kind of
[55:58] go at my pace
[56:00] brother did a fantastic job today god
[56:02] bless you and i

[56:07] out of speed or you know i'm a different
[56:09] kind of guy

[58:19] they

[58:21] kind of it's like reverse age maybe
[58:24] so uh anyhow god bless you guys i really
[58:27] really appreciate you um
[58:31] especially coming to the house of god
[58:32] hearing the word of god and i want this
[58:34] to be a blessing to you and
[58:36] you guys are the youth here's youth and
[58:40] coming up and very exciting to meet you
[58:44] gentlemen and brothers
[58:48] it's really been a blessing to see that
[58:52] so here in genesis 1 1 it says in the
[58:54] beginning god created the heavens and
[58:55] the earth
[58:58] and i think myself you know i i used to
[59:01] in fact
[59:02] i used to teach the godhead wrong for
[59:04] about 10 years and then
[59:05] brother cam said brother you know he
[59:07] started investigating the message
[59:09] looking into it and i
[59:10] i thought it wrong just the smidge just
[59:11] wrong and i took correction i said
[59:13] absolutely
[59:14] and now that we're teaching things
[59:17] correct more and more and precise
[59:19] uh more correct uh what was
[59:22] in genesis 1 1 what god what was god
[59:24] doing here in the beginning
[59:27] god created the heavens and the earth
[59:31] he said he created the heavens first and
[59:34] then the earth
[59:35] second and what was he doing he was
[59:37] writing
[59:38] his story he was writing the word of god
[59:42] we get down to the natural which we can
[59:43] see with our visual eyes and
[59:45] at night time you can look at the
[59:46] constellations and all those things and
[59:48] the prophet of god he says that's the
[59:50] bible
[59:50] written up there and then in the daytime
[59:53] we see the sun and the moon chase each
[59:55] other and
[59:55] those sort of things and we see the
[59:57] birds in the air we talked
[59:59] uh last night on how how nature teaches
[1:00:01] and
[1:00:02] god actually wrote the scripture he
[1:00:04] wrote the salvation plan
[1:00:06] in nature he wrote all that stuff in
[1:00:09] nature and i've always
[1:00:10] wanted to understand it a little bit
[1:00:12] deeper and by the grace of god hopefully
[1:00:14] we'll be able to get a little bit deeper
[1:00:15] in that
[1:00:16] but it says in the beginning god created
[1:00:18] heaven's ears did you know
[1:00:20] that before uh genesis 1 1 we know that
[1:00:23] he was just
[1:00:24] god right he was like he wasn't god
[1:00:26] because we know that god is an object of
[1:00:28] worship we've heard these things uh
[1:00:29] many many hundreds and hundreds and
[1:00:31] hundreds maybe thousands of times right
[1:00:33] so before he was god he was elohim just
[1:00:35] self-existing
[1:00:38] and in his attributes we know that he
[1:00:40] wanted to be healer he wanted to be
[1:00:41] provider he wanted to be
[1:00:42] all those things to his children right
[1:00:45] but he also wanted to be a father
[1:00:50] he also want to be a creator he also
[1:00:52] wanted to be a sal he wanted to be a
[1:00:54] savior
[1:00:56] so even before he was god even before
[1:00:58] the creation come forth something had to
[1:01:00] come out of him and that was the logos
[1:01:02] right
[1:01:02] and we know that that was a light body a
[1:01:05] word body correct
[1:01:10] and so now and if i would draw it when i
[1:01:14] teach it i draw it because
[1:01:15] i'll be honest the lord told me to join
[1:01:17] a certain organization
[1:01:19] uh it's business and i
[1:01:22] and i said lord why do you want me to
[1:01:23] join and i just kept showing it showing
[1:01:25] and i said fine i'll
[1:01:26] join up and start selling this and this
[1:01:28] and this and whatever
[1:01:29] so then sure enough i i was i was i'm
[1:01:31] like i didn't want to be there so i
[1:01:33] started
[1:01:33] i fishing automatically so i'll either
[1:01:35] kick me out or i'm going to catch fish
[1:01:36] right
[1:01:37] so sure enough two guys started getting
[1:01:40] interested in the word of god and i
[1:01:41] started
[1:01:42] every sunday night i'd drive after
[1:01:44] service drive to toledo
[1:01:46] do bible studies to one o'clock in the
[1:01:48] morning and drive home
[1:01:50] and we were stuck on baptism for for two
[1:01:53] months
[1:01:54] they could not get it through that
[1:01:56] denominational training that the baptism
[1:01:59] the father's holy ghost is the lord
[1:02:00] jesus christ
[1:02:03] and then once god broke forth and
[1:02:05] through that barrier then i started
[1:02:06] moving to godhead because they're one
[1:02:08] insane they're connected
[1:02:11] in fact that's how they teach trinity is
[1:02:13] through matthew 28 19.
[1:02:14] but that's not dealing with the godhead
[1:02:16] that's dealing with the baptism
[1:02:20] and then now as i'm dealing with godhead
[1:02:22] they said brother i i
[1:02:24] and so i had to draw it out and what i
[1:02:26] did i drew a big g
[1:02:27] but i did dots to show that it was
[1:02:29] invisible right
[1:02:30] and then i drew the pillar of fire and i
[1:02:33] said notice this is the invisible father
[1:02:35] that's the father
[1:02:36] and out then he spoke with that pillar
[1:02:38] of fire right
[1:02:40] and then then that invisible g that
[1:02:42] invisible god
[1:02:43] had to go and dwell within that pillar
[1:02:45] of fire right and now that's that's the
[1:02:47] father in
[1:02:48] enveloping himself dwelling in the sun
[1:02:50] right
[1:02:53] and then once i drew it they're like
[1:02:56] don't touch that white board leave it
[1:02:57] right there i said yes sir
[1:02:58] because i was in their house their
[1:02:59] apartment and they looked
[1:03:02] at that thing and finally they came to
[1:03:04] believe in the godhead one person
[1:03:06] because you could you could draw it out
[1:03:07] you could explain it they could not
[1:03:09] imagine or put it together in their mind
[1:03:10] so i actually just had to do a simple
[1:03:12] drawing and that changed them right
[1:03:13] there
[1:03:14] am i so that's what what i do
[1:03:18] so you know the father
[1:03:21] is the person the invisible
[1:03:24] the eternal right and the bible says
[1:03:27] here in john 5 and 19
[1:03:29] then jesus answered and said to him
[1:03:31] barely very i say unto you
[1:03:32] the son can do nothing of himself but
[1:03:34] what he seeth the father do
[1:03:36] for what things so ever he doeth these
[1:03:40] also do with the son likewise right and
[1:03:42] then he says
[1:03:43] for the father loveth the son
[1:03:46] jesus the image the expressed image of
[1:03:48] god said the father that father
[1:03:51] that one is dwelling in me he said he
[1:03:53] loves me
[1:03:55] he loves the son oh yes absolutely i'm
[1:03:57] going to show you how much he does love
[1:03:58] the sun
[1:03:59] now if we could now i don't know how
[1:04:00] long i'll be tonight but we're just
[1:04:01] going to we're just going to teach this
[1:04:03] by the grace of god
[1:04:04] if we turn if not now we're going to go
[1:04:06] you guys got this okay so
[1:04:08] in hebrews 1 now saint paul is the
[1:04:11] in hebrews 1 saint paul dials and he
[1:04:13] dials in he brings forth a fresh
[1:04:15] revelation on the godhead
[1:04:17] the expressed image of god right and
[1:04:19] then he's able to pull from the old
[1:04:21] testament something in hebrews 1
[1:04:24] 7 it says and of the angels he saith who
[1:04:27] maketh his
[1:04:27] angels spirits and his ministers a flame
[1:04:30] of fire
[1:04:31] but now in verse 8 he pulls from old
[1:04:34] testament
[1:04:36] but under the sun he saith now notice
[1:04:40] god the father is speaking now to the
[1:04:42] son thy throne o
[1:04:44] god is forever and ever a scepter of
[1:04:48] righteousness in the scepter of thy
[1:04:49] kingdom
[1:04:51] thou has love righteousness he says and
[1:04:53] hated and he's talking about the image
[1:04:55] of god absolutely he's talking of what
[1:04:57] jesus christ and flesh
[1:04:58] absolutely he says he says uh uh he said
[1:05:01] therefore god
[1:05:02] even thy god hath anointed thee with the
[1:05:04] oil of gladness above thy fellows why
[1:05:06] because he was the anointed one he was
[1:05:08] the messiah he was
[1:05:10] he was exactly what was prophesied all
[1:05:12] the way back in genesis 3 right
[1:05:14] he said sure now he says and thou lord
[1:05:17] in the beginning has laid the
[1:05:18] foundations of the earth so back in
[1:05:20] genesis 1 1 in the beginning god created
[1:05:23] that was the father and the son bringing
[1:05:25] forth the creation of god right
[1:05:27] so here now notice now notice god is now
[1:05:30] in the sun in genesis 1
[1:05:32] and that light with god in it that light
[1:05:34] that logos with god in it is now
[1:05:37] creating everything and writing the
[1:05:38] scriptural bible right
[1:05:41] sure he says in the beginning thou has
[1:05:43] laid the foundation the earth and the
[1:05:45] heavens are the work of thine hands they
[1:05:47] shall perish he says but thou
[1:05:48] remained that's why that goes all the
[1:05:51] way back to matthew 24 he says he says
[1:05:53] heaven and earth shall pass away but my
[1:05:54] word shall
[1:05:55] never pass away amen yes sir he says but
[1:05:59] thou
[1:05:59] remaineth he says and they all shall wax
[1:06:02] as old as doth the garment
[1:06:03] he says in a vesture thou shall fold
[1:06:05] them up and they shall be changed he
[1:06:06] says but thou
[1:06:07] art the same amen he says and for thy
[1:06:10] years they shall not fail amen that is
[1:06:12] the son that is the word of god
[1:06:18] but now remember mo paul actually pulled
[1:06:20] this from the old testament now i want
[1:06:22] to show you something
[1:06:23] and where did he pull that for him he
[1:06:24] pulled that from psalms 45.
[1:06:27] now as we go back to four psalms 45
[1:06:30] let's turn to verse 1 there
[1:06:33] psalms 45 verse 1
[1:06:37] now look how this is written now
[1:06:39] remember the bible says all scripture is
[1:06:41] given by the inspiration
[1:06:43] of of the holy ghost or god himself
[1:06:45] right
[1:06:46] now look what is writing here he says to
[1:06:49] the chief musician the son of
[1:06:51] the musician upon i can't remember i
[1:06:53] can't even speak that for the
[1:06:54] the sons of kora uh mashiel
[1:06:58] he says a song of loves
[1:07:02] he says my heart is indicting
[1:07:06] did you notice how the holy ghost says
[1:07:07] my heart is indicting
[1:07:10] a good matter he says i speak of the
[1:07:14] things which i have
[1:07:15] made touching the king my tongue is the
[1:07:18] pen
[1:07:18] of a ready writer
[1:07:22] now that word indicting let me break
[1:07:24] this down you know that word indicting
[1:07:26] it means boil is over a bubble is over
[1:07:29] it means to properly to boil over as a
[1:07:31] fountain he says and the idea here is
[1:07:33] the heart boiled over with emotions of
[1:07:36] love he said it was full and overflowing
[1:07:38] it found expression in the words of this
[1:07:40] song
[1:07:41] in fact this is the only place in the
[1:07:42] bible this word in hebrew indicting is
[1:07:44] found
[1:07:46] and this is god speaking of what
[1:07:50] in verse 2 verse 3
[1:07:53] verse 4 5 and 6 it picks up in here in
[1:07:56] verse 6 he's talking about the son
[1:07:59] god is overjoyed he's bubbling up he's
[1:08:02] so excited
[1:08:03] about what his son is going to do he's
[1:08:05] so excited what the image he's going to
[1:08:07] bring forth and mary
[1:08:09] is going to do he's trying to express
[1:08:11] something and the father
[1:08:13] loveth the son amen sure
[1:08:16] now
[1:08:20] let's continue on now why does the
[1:08:23] father loveth the son
[1:08:25] in john 8 28 then he saith then said
[1:08:28] jesus unto him when ye have lifted up
[1:08:30] the son of man then shall you know that
[1:08:31] i am he and that i can do
[1:08:33] nothing of myself but as my father hath
[1:08:36] taught me i speak these things and he
[1:08:38] that has sent with me
[1:08:40] has sent me is with me the father has
[1:08:42] not left me alone he says for i
[1:08:43] always do the things that please him
[1:08:47] why the logos he was the word and that
[1:08:50] word was
[1:08:51] perfect there's no fault in it it's
[1:08:53] perfect and god
[1:08:54] loved it because when that word was made
[1:08:55] manifest it did exactly
[1:08:58] it stayed with himself i'll say it like
[1:09:00] that sure
[1:09:02] amen now moving on here
[1:09:09] in psalms 90 verse 1 a prayer of moses
[1:09:12] the man of god his lord thou has been
[1:09:14] our dwelling place in all
[1:09:16] generations before the mountains were
[1:09:18] brought forth or ever
[1:09:20] before thou thou has formed the earth
[1:09:22] sorry form the earth in the world
[1:09:24] even from everlasting to have lasting he
[1:09:26] says thou art
[1:09:27] god was showing what the god the logos
[1:09:29] was all the way in the beginning sure
[1:09:32] then in micah in 5 and verse 2 now this
[1:09:35] is a prophecy of where the messiah would
[1:09:37] be born correct
[1:09:38] he says but thou bethlehem ephra
[1:09:41] he says though thou be little among the
[1:09:44] thousands of judah yet
[1:09:45] out of thee shall he come forth unto me
[1:09:48] that is of to be a ruler
[1:09:50] in israel right so what the messiah
[1:09:52] would come out of bethlehem
[1:09:54] but notice whose goings forth have been
[1:09:56] from old and everlasting it was the same
[1:09:58] god all the time the same logos that son
[1:10:01] was with
[1:10:02] god in the beginning sure absolutely
[1:10:04] identifying
[1:10:05] just exactly now in corinthians
[1:10:08] i'm sorry colossians 1 15 he says who
[1:10:12] is the image of the invisible god
[1:10:15] right we know that's so that we can be
[1:10:17] he could he could he could touch and
[1:10:18] taste and feel do all those things right
[1:10:20] and he was the image on the the
[1:10:22] invisible god this is a hand-picked
[1:10:24] body this is a hand made body of god
[1:10:27] the firstborn of every creature this is
[1:10:29] god's personal body this is how he
[1:10:31] wanted to be made manifest
[1:10:33] he says but for by him were all things
[1:10:35] created that is in heaven that on earth
[1:10:37] there it is genesis 1 1
[1:10:39] visible and invisible whether they be
[1:10:40] thrones and or dominions or
[1:10:42] principalities or powers
[1:10:43] all things are created by him and form
[1:10:44] and he is before all things
[1:10:46] and by him all things consist amen
[1:10:50] now uh i don't know how brother brooks
[1:10:53] teaches
[1:10:54] the logos but me and my pastor back home
[1:10:57] we were
[1:10:58] examining these scriptures and to me
[1:10:59] this looks like logos to me this looks
[1:11:01] like something
[1:11:02] that was uh specifically put here now in
[1:11:05] proverbs 8
[1:11:07] and verse 20. to me this is logos to me
[1:11:10] this
[1:11:10] is exactly what god was jesus christ was
[1:11:14] he says i lead in the way of
[1:11:16] righteousness
[1:11:17] in the middle of the paths of judgment
[1:11:19] that i may cause those that love me to
[1:11:21] inherit
[1:11:22] substance and the bible says faith is a
[1:11:25] substance
[1:11:27] oh my we want more faith absolutely why
[1:11:29] because we're going to need that
[1:11:30] rapturing
[1:11:31] faith to make it out of here amen
[1:11:34] that's the substance i want right there
[1:11:36] and the of course the holy ghost himself
[1:11:38] more and more
[1:11:39] he says that i might cause those that
[1:11:40] love me to inherit substance and i will
[1:11:42] fill their
[1:11:44] treasures now look the lord possessed me
[1:11:47] in the beginning of my way
[1:11:50] could this be now remember in in a lot
[1:11:52] of psalms and a lot of proverbs
[1:11:54] a lot of the old testament sometimes it
[1:11:56] was god i was like this
[1:11:57] god god would actually uh speak through
[1:12:01] them right
[1:12:03] the they said in the old testament or in
[1:12:04] the new testament that a lot of times
[1:12:06] the prophets were anointed by what the
[1:12:08] spirit of christ
[1:12:09] absolutely and now here we see exactly
[1:12:11] the logos now bringing forth the word
[1:12:14] himself
[1:12:15] the lord possessed me in the beginning
[1:12:17] of his way
[1:12:18] before his works of old i was set up
[1:12:20] from everlasting from the beginning
[1:12:22] or ever the earth was when there were no
[1:12:24] depths i
[1:12:25] was brought forth what out of god came
[1:12:28] the low god said now hear the word
[1:12:30] jesus is now speaking he says i've come
[1:12:32] out of god
[1:12:33] he says when there are no fountains
[1:12:35] abounding with water before the
[1:12:37] the mountains were settled before the
[1:12:38] hills i was i
[1:12:40] brought forth amen to me that looks like
[1:12:42] logos to me that looks like the sun
[1:12:44] before it was flesh
[1:12:45] to me looks like the word of god amen
[1:12:48] well as yet he was not made he had not
[1:12:51] made the earth he said no the fields nor
[1:12:53] the highest part of just the earth
[1:12:54] when he prepared the heavens he says i
[1:12:57] was
[1:12:58] there when he set a compass upon the
[1:13:00] face of the deep he says when he
[1:13:02] established the crowd the clouds above
[1:13:04] when he strengthened the fountains with
[1:13:06] of the deep when he had when he gave to
[1:13:08] the sea his decree
[1:13:10] that the water should not pass his
[1:13:11] commandment when he appointed the
[1:13:13] foundation the earth he says
[1:13:14] then i was by him as one brought up with
[1:13:19] him what
[1:13:20] the almighty invisible god wanted to be
[1:13:22] a father and that logos was a son to him
[1:13:24] amen
[1:13:26] and i was daily his delight rejoicing
[1:13:29] always before
[1:13:30] that light would just dance and jump and
[1:13:32] it was living and and god didn't
[1:13:34] just love to be in the center of worship
[1:13:36] amen sure
[1:13:38] rejoicing in the habitable part of the
[1:13:40] earth and then verse 35
[1:13:42] for whosoever findeth me findeth life
[1:13:46] remember the old time the old tabernacle
[1:13:48] what the jesus said
[1:13:50] i am the way the truth holy
[1:13:53] place and the life holiest of holies
[1:13:56] that whole thing was him
[1:13:58] and inside of that body was life why
[1:14:00] that's why that blood had to be shed
[1:14:02] because in that blood was the very life
[1:14:04] that we sent on you and me amen
[1:14:06] to fill us and to live through us amen
[1:14:08] yes
[1:14:10] now
[1:14:13] you may already know these things but it
[1:14:16] says in john 1 1 in the beginning was
[1:14:17] the word the word was with god and the
[1:14:19] word was
[1:14:20] was god the same was in the beginning
[1:14:22] with god all things were made by him and
[1:14:24] without him
[1:14:24] was not anything made that was made and
[1:14:28] then of course in genesis 1 1 i want to
[1:14:29] go back there
[1:14:30] in the beginning god created the heavens
[1:14:31] the earth now let me ask you a question
[1:14:33] why was there two realms why did god
[1:14:37] create
[1:14:38] the heaven and the earth
[1:14:41] why didn't he just stick with the heaven
[1:14:44] why didn't he just have that tabernacle
[1:14:45] in heaven and this and that and just set
[1:14:47] up everything
[1:14:48] and just leave it like that but he
[1:14:49] actually had to create another
[1:14:51] realm another world why did he do that
[1:14:55] you may know already know these things
[1:14:56] or however but
[1:14:59] and i come to the to the thought to why
[1:15:02] you know i thought about the devil one
[1:15:04] day and i thought man can he be saved
[1:15:06] can the devil be saved is there a
[1:15:07] redemption is there a chance is there a
[1:15:09] loophole
[1:15:11] no that's right why
[1:15:14] because in the word of god redemption
[1:15:17] salvation can only come through blood
[1:15:21] and that blood has to come through death
[1:15:24] and the bible says that satan is a
[1:15:26] spirit a chariot of anointed cherub
[1:15:28] right
[1:15:29] and if satan is a spirit that would mean
[1:15:31] a spirit would have to die for him
[1:15:33] and since god is eternal he cannot die
[1:15:35] there is absolutely no salvation for
[1:15:37] the devil or any of the demons
[1:15:40] absolutely that's just that simple
[1:15:42] so now
[1:15:46] but that's where the beauty of it is
[1:15:52] why didn't he just leave us up in heaven
[1:15:54] why didn't he just leave a spirit
[1:15:56] people because he had to write a story
[1:15:59] notice we did not fall adam did not fall
[1:16:02] up there but god had to send him
[1:16:06] and sent that soul that seed life into a
[1:16:09] flesh and then when that flesh that seed
[1:16:12] entered that flesh
[1:16:13] and then satan contempted eve and adam
[1:16:15] and all those things it's like this
[1:16:16] when satan could tap adam because it was
[1:16:18] adam before you
[1:16:20] she didn't receive a name changed to
[1:16:22] after
[1:16:24] so then after thou thou that now that
[1:16:26] that seed that seed life the children of
[1:16:29] god
[1:16:29] took a fall it was in the flesh
[1:16:33] now now that's where god set the stage
[1:16:37] everything had to be a stage right there
[1:16:39] right
[1:16:40] everything was set
[1:16:44] in fact let me show you something here
[1:16:47] do you know in revelations 20
[1:16:50] and i verse i came about 10 or 11. it
[1:16:53] said that
[1:16:53] that those that make the first
[1:16:55] resurrection are blessed
[1:16:57] and holy right and then if you jump now
[1:17:00] where did they get their blessedness
[1:17:01] where'd they get their holiness
[1:17:03] why are they blessed and holy here then
[1:17:05] in revelation sorry in matthew 25
[1:17:07] dealing with those that come up in the
[1:17:08] great general resurrection those on the
[1:17:09] right and those on the left
[1:17:11] we find those that are on the right the
[1:17:12] ones that are counted as sheep he says
[1:17:14] those are blessed as well where'd they
[1:17:16] get their blessing
[1:17:18] but then we see those on the left where
[1:17:20] where did they get their cursing
[1:17:22] you know god set a stage everything is
[1:17:25] planned
[1:17:26] out it's fully let's go to genesis 1.
[1:17:34] you know god knew exactly what he was
[1:17:36] doing
[1:17:38] this thing so elected so set
[1:17:42] everything stacked in our favor we just
[1:17:45] have to enjoy
[1:17:46] salvation we have to joy we just have to
[1:17:48] yield here
[1:17:50] amen now look here in the in the fifth
[1:17:52] day
[1:17:53] genesis 1 verse 20.
[1:17:56] and god said let the waters bring forth
[1:17:58] abundantly and the moving creature that
[1:18:00] has life the fowl
[1:18:01] that that may fly above the earth in the
[1:18:05] open firmament of heaven
[1:18:06] the god created great whales and every
[1:18:08] living creature and moveth
[1:18:09] which the waters brought forth
[1:18:10] abundantly after their kind
[1:18:13] and every winged fowl after his kind and
[1:18:15] god saw that it was good
[1:18:16] so god created the birds the fish the
[1:18:19] whales all those things but notice in
[1:18:20] verse 22
[1:18:22] and god blessed them
[1:18:26] was a blessing and placed upon the fish
[1:18:28] and the birds
[1:18:30] blessed but known as to the sixth day in
[1:18:34] verse 24
[1:18:36] and god said let the earth bring forth
[1:18:38] the living creature after his kind
[1:18:40] cattle and creeping things
[1:18:42] and the beasts of the earth are of his
[1:18:43] kind and it was so and god made the
[1:18:45] beast of the earth after his kind and
[1:18:47] the cattle there were
[1:18:49] after their kind and everything that
[1:18:51] creepeth upon the earth that after this
[1:18:53] kind and god
[1:18:54] saw that it was good notice he did not
[1:18:56] say it was good because it would have
[1:18:58] spoken it would have to stay good
[1:19:00] but here he says and god saw that it was
[1:19:03] good and notice
[1:19:04] no blessing put upon it
[1:19:08] he blessed the fish he blessed the birds
[1:19:10] but there was no blessing
[1:19:12] put on animal life do you know where
[1:19:15] we're going with that
[1:19:18] god could not bless animal life because
[1:19:20] he knew animal life would take part in
[1:19:21] the fall
[1:19:23] and god had to leave a space where he
[1:19:25] could curse something
[1:19:28] he could not bless animal life because
[1:19:29] there was a curse waiting coming forth
[1:19:33] in genesis 1 and 20 and god said let us
[1:19:36] make man after our image right
[1:19:39] in verse 28 and god blessed them
[1:19:44] and god said unto them be fruitful and
[1:19:45] multiply right there is where the
[1:19:47] blessing is
[1:19:49] once something is blessed god could not
[1:19:51] erase it
[1:19:53] that's where those in the bride get
[1:19:54] their blessing and holy they get the
[1:19:56] holy from the holy ghost but they get
[1:19:57] the blessing all the way back here in
[1:19:58] genesis
[1:19:59] and in matthew 25 that's where those on
[1:20:01] the right hand get their blessing it was
[1:20:02] already blessed
[1:20:05] the stage was set the book was written
[1:20:07] the names were already written up there
[1:20:08] was done and sealed
[1:20:11] eternal
[1:20:15] so why does the why is the sun the word
[1:20:17] of god so important that logan's so
[1:20:19] important
[1:20:21] and remember the topic is can you write
[1:20:23] i was just kind of setting this
[1:20:24] foundation there is that all right
[1:20:26] i'm in construction that's just what we
[1:20:28] do now
[1:20:31] in exodus 3 verse 1
[1:20:34] because there's always a reason for
[1:20:36] something there's only god does
[1:20:37] everything for a reason
[1:20:40] in genesis 3 verse 1 now moses kept the
[1:20:42] flock of jethro his father-in-law
[1:20:44] the priest the minion and he led the
[1:20:46] flock to the backside
[1:20:47] of the desert that was a predestinated
[1:20:49] move
[1:20:50] why because what at that point at that
[1:20:53] moment in time the pillar of fire come
[1:20:54] down and reveal himself
[1:20:56] why did the father appear with the son
[1:20:59] why was the logos why was that pillar of
[1:21:01] fire
[1:21:02] there why not before why not why not and
[1:21:05] maybe
[1:21:05] in genesis where enoch and noah and this
[1:21:08] that but the
[1:21:08] pillar of fire appeared right then
[1:21:12] the pillar of fire when it appears it
[1:21:14] signifies something
[1:21:17] when god appears with the sun something
[1:21:20] big is going to take place
[1:21:22] something big is going to happen
[1:21:25] like what do you think we're expecting
[1:21:27] right now we're expecting another
[1:21:29] appearance of the pillar of fire
[1:21:32] i believe brother isaiah when he first
[1:21:34] come into the move
[1:21:35] of what we call the the word of god or
[1:21:37] the message they saw it in their tent
[1:21:39] meetings i believe
[1:21:41] he said he couldn't even move
[1:21:45] a reverence a fear holy fear holy
[1:21:49] reverence
[1:21:50] no one could move and then when it left
[1:21:54] he said somebody said did you all see
[1:21:56] that
[1:21:59] the pillar of fire appeared again
[1:22:03] something's going to happen now notice
[1:22:05] as the pillar of fire appears here to
[1:22:07] moses notice as he's in the presence of
[1:22:09] god the presence
[1:22:10] of god says cover it he says take off
[1:22:12] your feet because you're on holy ground
[1:22:13] right
[1:22:13] and then we find not only does he do
[1:22:15] that and obey that
[1:22:17] because now remember the living
[1:22:18] creatures that were up there they had
[1:22:19] six wings right flying and
[1:22:21] and the other ones closed their face the
[1:22:23] other one's head they hid their feet
[1:22:24] right
[1:22:25] and we know that's humility and all
[1:22:26] those things reverence and all those
[1:22:27] things to what holy god
[1:22:29] and we see that as god commands moses to
[1:22:31] to take up his take off his shoes or
[1:22:33] sandals or however
[1:22:35] the bible says in verse 6 and moses hid
[1:22:38] his face
[1:22:39] as well for he's afraid to look upon god
[1:22:42] this is a holy god reverend i'm talking
[1:22:46] deadly sincere reverence right here this
[1:22:49] is now
[1:22:49] the very creator of heaven come down to
[1:22:52] meet his people
[1:22:53] but he came in pillar of fire why
[1:23:02] he says now the influence of 64 it's
[1:23:05] like moses in his presence taking all
[1:23:06] his shoes
[1:23:07] uncovered his feet see set one of uh see
[1:23:10] the one over on his feet covered meant
[1:23:12] humility
[1:23:13] watched the servant now before god his
[1:23:16] face covered in reverence
[1:23:17] his feet covered humility yes be
[1:23:19] conscious to be very conscious of your
[1:23:21] little ones of how little you are
[1:23:23] he says you want to see how little we
[1:23:24] are he says put your finger in a in a
[1:23:26] pan of water
[1:23:27] and see if that hole remains where you
[1:23:28] put your finger because he said he says
[1:23:31] he says he's god really truly doesn't
[1:23:32] need us
[1:23:33] he says but we need him you know you can
[1:23:36] have a gifting calling in your life but
[1:23:38] if you refuse it god will move to
[1:23:39] somewhere else
[1:23:41] that's what we're just trying to yield
[1:23:43] and everyone wants to find their
[1:23:44] position we must find our positions
[1:23:46] what gifts lay in your life what gives
[1:23:48] what other gifts lay in my life we have
[1:23:50] to find
[1:23:51] what we need amen and god help us amen
[1:23:54] he says now he says humble yourself see
[1:23:56] how little you can be
[1:23:57] but not what you know not what you don't
[1:23:59] know let yourself get humble
[1:24:02] before god and one of the greatest
[1:24:03] things we can do is
[1:24:05] master human ability
[1:24:08] well brother keith you sure can pray and
[1:24:10] you can do this and do that
[1:24:11] and brother keith has to set that aside
[1:24:14] and say lord i am completely
[1:24:16] helpless lord what do you want me to do
[1:24:19] lord use
[1:24:21] this vessel if moses was called and he
[1:24:23] had six what six weaknesses
[1:24:25] and god could still use him to do that
[1:24:27] what more can he do with us
[1:24:29] and that was under the covenant of what
[1:24:31] a bulls and ghosts but now we're in the
[1:24:32] covenant of the holy ghost
[1:24:33] god the prophet said it only takes it
[1:24:35] takes if god can get one man under his
[1:24:37] control
[1:24:38] fully yielded
[1:24:42] he said he'd have another move one man
[1:24:45] another
[1:24:45] the other portion he said he said
[1:24:46] wherever a divine healing a major divine
[1:24:49] healing
[1:24:49] is it'll spark a revival if we can just
[1:24:52] get beside ourselves and really just
[1:24:54] yield and hear the voice of god and move
[1:24:56] amen god help us
[1:25:00] now what was
[1:25:03] what was the logos doing there
[1:25:08] when the logos appeared with the father
[1:25:10] and moses
[1:25:11] what was it saying because the word that
[1:25:13] light was the word of god
[1:25:15] and when the logos appeared and came
[1:25:17] down that pillar fire it showed that
[1:25:18] there was a
[1:25:19] word coming and what after directly
[1:25:23] after this we know the process of
[1:25:24] bringing them out of
[1:25:25] egypt and all those things and god sent
[1:25:27] them into the desert
[1:25:29] he had to go into dry places he had to
[1:25:31] come in to dry this and dry that where
[1:25:33] there's nothing but we can only depend
[1:25:35] on god
[1:25:40] but the pillar of fire signified that
[1:25:42] there was a word coming
[1:25:43] now notice what what now since there was
[1:25:45] a word coming god in his foreknowledge
[1:25:47] he knew it was coming as well
[1:25:51] god had ten major plagues and he just
[1:25:54] destroyed egypt
[1:25:56] left it in ruins the greatest nation the
[1:25:58] greatest king of his time
[1:26:00] but notice in galatians 3 verse 19
[1:26:05] wherefore then serveth the law
[1:26:08] or sir wherefore then serve the law it
[1:26:10] was added because
[1:26:12] of transgressions god did not give them
[1:26:15] a law
[1:26:16] until they went off the word they had
[1:26:19] the prophet of god
[1:26:21] remember the logos was the word and that
[1:26:22] signified that
[1:26:24] god knew before anything before anything
[1:26:26] that they were going to fall and he they
[1:26:27] were going to need a word of god
[1:26:29] and that word of god would point them to
[1:26:30] salvation
[1:26:32] don't do this don't do that and you'll
[1:26:33] live but if you do this you're a dead
[1:26:35] man
[1:26:37] sure and god wrote the ten commandments
[1:26:41] he wrote the statutes the judgments all
[1:26:44] those things the ordinances
[1:26:46] correct now
[1:26:50] so we see that god had to send a prophet
[1:26:52] to the desert
[1:26:54] and then at the as the prophet was in
[1:26:56] the desert the pillar of fire would show
[1:26:57] up
[1:26:59] and it signified there was a great move
[1:27:01] coming and the word of god was going to
[1:27:02] be brought forth
[1:27:06] now we know about luther right
[1:27:10] luther was a powerful man of god and
[1:27:13] they say he was the great reformer but
[1:27:15] you know there was another reform
[1:27:16] reformation in the bible in hebrews 9
[1:27:20] and verse 10 saint paul is diving now in
[1:27:23] the old testament
[1:27:24] led by the holy ghost to write and to
[1:27:26] bring forth the shadows and types
[1:27:27] showing exactly what it was
[1:27:29] in hebrews 9 and verse 10 he's dealing
[1:27:31] now with the
[1:27:32] the the way the priests handled the the
[1:27:35] sacrifice
[1:27:36] uh it says which stood only in meats and
[1:27:38] drinks and divers washing and
[1:27:40] cardinal carnal ordinances imposing on
[1:27:43] them until the time of the reformation
[1:27:46] see so what was what is the true
[1:27:48] reformation the true reformation is
[1:27:50] moving from law to grace and that was
[1:27:51] through jesus
[1:27:52] christ the great capital g capital r
[1:27:56] reformer amen
[1:27:59] luther was a smaller version
[1:28:02] but the time of the reformation when
[1:28:04] things changed but remember
[1:28:06] what took that it took the holy ghost
[1:28:08] the pillar of fire to come down once
[1:28:09] again
[1:28:10] on the son of god right now and what did
[1:28:14] that prove what did that produce
[1:28:16] it produced the book of acts correct
[1:28:19] sure now
[1:28:22] and what was the book of acts the
[1:28:24] prophet said he says and god was tearing
[1:28:25] loose and pulling apart and cutting
[1:28:27] himself uh
[1:28:28] pulling apart separating himself
[1:28:30] dividing himself and placing it on each
[1:28:32] one of them
[1:28:33] showing that what god and man has become
[1:28:35] one correct
[1:28:37] it was like a candlestick you were you
[1:28:38] became a light absolutely
[1:28:41] the light dwell right here and you were
[1:28:42] like a walking candlestick and god said
[1:28:44] he says he says will he take a
[1:28:45] candlestick and light it and hide under
[1:28:46] a bushel no he will not do it but he
[1:28:49] places on a hill so what the all the
[1:28:50] world can see
[1:28:52] not the stick itself but that light on
[1:28:54] there amen yes lord
[1:28:56] sure absolutely now
[1:29:01] let's move here now
[1:29:05] when's the next time we see the pillar
[1:29:06] of fire on the scene in the bible
[1:29:09] saint paul
[1:29:14] and saint paul was a man of the law he
[1:29:17] was a pharisee he was circumcised on the
[1:29:19] eighth day
[1:29:20] the stock of israel look at his resume
[1:29:23] he says the tribe of benjamin a hebrew
[1:29:24] of hebrews is touching the law he's as a
[1:29:26] pharisee he says he was blameless
[1:29:28] concerning zeal persecuting the church
[1:29:31] touching righteousness that is in the
[1:29:32] law
[1:29:33] blameless he lived it perfect just like
[1:29:35] job oh my
[1:29:36] he's before things were gained to me i
[1:29:37] count a loss for christ right so he had
[1:29:39] quite the resume
[1:29:42] but then we see that as he was
[1:29:44] persecuting the true church what the
[1:29:46] pillar of fire came down and revealed
[1:29:48] himself
[1:29:50] to the prophet paul
[1:29:54] right
[1:29:58] what was taking place if the pillar of
[1:30:00] fire showed up one more time
[1:30:02] and appeared to a man just like he did
[1:30:05] with moses
[1:30:07] the pattern must continue but what was
[1:30:11] god doing
[1:30:12] why was god meeting this man in that
[1:30:15] sort of way just like he did a major
[1:30:17] prophet moses
[1:30:18] why was he why was the pillar of fire
[1:30:20] the word now coming forth
[1:30:22] the one that just crucified lived and
[1:30:23] died turned back to spirit form come
[1:30:24] back down
[1:30:25] now the pillar fire with god and the
[1:30:27] father and in the son and appeared to
[1:30:28] him and spoke out i am jesus
[1:30:33] because remember what had taken place
[1:30:36] and where did where did peter go i'm
[1:30:37] sorry where did paul go
[1:30:39] directly after meeting that pillar of
[1:30:40] fire he says but what neither i went to
[1:30:43] jerusalem to them which were apostles
[1:30:44] before me but i went to
[1:30:45] arabia and returned again unto damascus
[1:30:49] then after three years i went up to
[1:30:51] jerusalem he went right to the desert
[1:30:52] just like
[1:30:53] moses god had to send him in the desert
[1:30:57] just like moses moses scots in the
[1:30:59] desert and then in that time what the
[1:31:00] pillar of fire would appear
[1:31:03] now he had to wait on god but what was
[1:31:06] it for
[1:31:10] as we examined the seven church ages
[1:31:13] christ came lived and died and we were
[1:31:15] estimating around 33 a.d right
[1:31:18] and from 33 a.d to 53 a.d
[1:31:22] the start of ephesus there was 20 years
[1:31:25] of perfection there's
[1:31:28] 20 years of purity
[1:31:34] 53 a.d
[1:31:38] do you know there's only one book in the
[1:31:39] bible that is actually supposedly
[1:31:41] written
[1:31:42] and sent to the churches in that pure
[1:31:44] form
[1:31:46] all the other books of the bible are
[1:31:48] after 53 a.d except one
[1:31:50] and that was matthew matthew was sent in
[1:31:53] 37 a.d
[1:31:55] what probably just to encourage god
[1:31:57] anointed matthew encourage
[1:31:58] the people that say this was jesus
[1:32:00] christ life this is it
[1:32:02] but after 53 d or round 53 a.d what
[1:32:06] satan had crept in
[1:32:09] sent false teachers false brothers
[1:32:12] unawares
[1:32:12] and they started getting the church off
[1:32:14] and the church got off
[1:32:18] you know it was the second book
[1:32:19] published after 53 a.d
[1:32:22] the book of first corinthians so for 20
[1:32:26] years the church lived pure
[1:32:30] lead led of the holy ghost
[1:32:33] but notice how fast the church went off
[1:32:35] to where god
[1:32:36] had to anoint paul now the one that saw
[1:32:38] the pillar of fire was going to bring
[1:32:40] the word of god and what was that word
[1:32:42] just like it was in the mountains the 10
[1:32:44] commandments for correction
[1:32:46] what was the what is this all this new
[1:32:47] testament for it's correction trying to
[1:32:49] get us back to the book of acts
[1:32:53] the church had so fallen from its
[1:32:55] original state that god had to now
[1:32:58] bring forth and notice notice that how
[1:33:00] the people
[1:33:02] how how did they get how did the church
[1:33:04] start falling it had started
[1:33:06] elevating people in first corinthians 1
[1:33:09] the first chapter of the first book
[1:33:11] sent after 53 a.d now i beseech you
[1:33:14] brother and by the name of our lord
[1:33:15] jesus christ that you all speak the same
[1:33:16] thing and there'll be no divisions
[1:33:18] among you but you'd be perfectly joining
[1:33:20] the same mind and the same judgment
[1:33:22] he says for it has been declared unto me
[1:33:24] my brother and by them which are of the
[1:33:26] house of chloe that there are
[1:33:27] contentions among you
[1:33:29] 59 a.d he says now i say this
[1:33:33] that every one of you saith i am of paul
[1:33:36] he says i am of apollos i am cephas and
[1:33:39] i have christ
[1:33:40] they had already in the pure church
[1:33:43] fallen and now they are identifying
[1:33:44] themselves they have lifted men up and
[1:33:45] said i am they connect them instead of
[1:33:47] with christ
[1:33:49] the exaltation of ministers he says
[1:33:53] is christ divided for was paul crucified
[1:33:55] for you he says oh are you baptized in
[1:33:57] paul's name absolutely not
[1:34:01] he says now the prophet says communion
[1:34:03] 1965 he says but paul set the thing in
[1:34:06] order he was the prophet to the new
[1:34:07] testament
[1:34:08] he says just as moses went to the
[1:34:10] wilderness to receive the inspiration to
[1:34:11] the right five books
[1:34:12] of the bible well paul was also sent the
[1:34:14] desert received inspiration of god to
[1:34:16] set the new
[1:34:17] new testament church in order and to
[1:34:19] type it with the old
[1:34:21] that was the pillar of fire and they
[1:34:23] wrote it
[1:34:24] god allowed them to write it i want to
[1:34:27] show you something here
[1:34:30] there's coming a time where the very
[1:34:32] discernment of god will be just like the
[1:34:34] book of acts
[1:34:36] and i want to show you the level of
[1:34:38] discernment when the lord showed this to
[1:34:40] me it just blew me away
[1:34:42] let me show you the very level of
[1:34:43] discernment of our lord and savior
[1:34:46] you mind if i do that now
[1:34:52] let's go in malachi 4 verse 4 he says
[1:34:55] remember ye the law of moses my servant
[1:34:58] which i commanded unto him in oreb for
[1:35:01] all of israel
[1:35:02] with the statutes and judgments right
[1:35:04] you know that horeb that word horeb
[1:35:06] means
[1:35:06] it means a parched or dry place or
[1:35:09] desolate
[1:35:13] he says so notice he's tying this with
[1:35:15] malachi he puts this right in malachi 4
[1:35:16] right before malachi 5
[1:35:18] showing that what god would send him in
[1:35:20] a dry dry time and that we would be in a
[1:35:22] dry
[1:35:22] dry time but in malachi 4 5 where do
[1:35:26] they where do most
[1:35:27] i was like ministers put emphasis behold
[1:35:30] i send
[1:35:30] you or behold i send you elijah right
[1:35:34] but what if we put the emphasis on
[1:35:36] behold i
[1:35:38] god where did it all come from god
[1:35:40] almighty who sent malachi 4 god almighty
[1:35:43] who sent malachi 4 to you god almighty
[1:35:47] now i'm going to show you something here
[1:35:49] very powerful
[1:35:51] in john 6. if we want to turn there
[1:35:53] let's get it up on the screen because i
[1:35:54] want to show you what god thinks
[1:35:56] of exalting someone else
[1:35:59] you can actually say scripture and you
[1:36:02] can
[1:36:02] mean it a different way
[1:36:06] this i hope this is a blessing to you
[1:36:08] this blew my mind when the lord showed
[1:36:09] this to me
[1:36:12] john 6 28 now watch how this comes out
[1:36:17] watch how these pharisees god actually
[1:36:19] discerns the very
[1:36:21] heart of these people this is this is
[1:36:24] supernatural
[1:36:25] in john 6 28 then said they unto him
[1:36:28] what shall we do that we might work the
[1:36:30] works of
[1:36:30] god they wanted to serve god they want
[1:36:32] to do man this guy
[1:36:34] he's healing sick raising that he's
[1:36:35] preaching things he's confounding the
[1:36:37] pharisees and scribes and sadducees
[1:36:39] he's doing it all who is this guy he
[1:36:40] must be a prophet there's something
[1:36:41] about him
[1:36:43] jesus answered to him this is the work
[1:36:45] of god that you believe on whom
[1:36:47] him on whom he has sent right now look
[1:36:50] as we move verse 30 they said they
[1:36:53] referring to them what signs sure style
[1:36:55] then
[1:36:55] that we may see and believe what does
[1:36:58] thou work
[1:36:58] now notice what they say next
[1:37:02] they're pulling from the old
[1:37:06] our fathers did eat manna in the desert
[1:37:10] as it is written notice what they say
[1:37:14] he gave them bread from heaven to eat
[1:37:18] wow that's brother brother brooks is
[1:37:20] that is that the truth
[1:37:22] is that the truth brothers they pulled
[1:37:25] from the scripture
[1:37:25] it was absolutely not one word off
[1:37:29] but notice the spirit behind the words
[1:37:33] what did they
[1:37:34] mean by he
[1:37:41] he he gave them
[1:37:45] our fathers he gave them bread from
[1:37:47] heaven
[1:37:48] he did it he was the one he was the
[1:37:51] great one
[1:37:52] and jesus said unto them verily verily i
[1:37:55] say unto you
[1:37:55] moses gave you not that bread from
[1:38:00] heaven
[1:38:02] you know brother ran when he healed the
[1:38:04] sick and he brother raised the dead
[1:38:06] they don't even say he they say the
[1:38:07] prophet
[1:38:09] it was not the man of god it was god
[1:38:12] himself
[1:38:14] but look how far they could quote
[1:38:16] scripture and mean
[1:38:17] something else and yet a premium
[1:38:21] and a seem or or seem like they're
[1:38:24] staying with the word of god
[1:38:25] and yet in their minds they meant to
[1:38:27] magnify a man
[1:38:30] behold i send you jesus christ right
[1:38:34] here would not
[1:38:34] share his glory with moses
[1:38:39] that was gold nugget right there that's
[1:38:41] a big one hey
[1:38:42] whoop there it is keeping your keeping
[1:38:45] your files
[1:38:47] because that'll prove a lot of things
[1:38:49] right there
[1:38:50] wonder what that image of jealousy was
[1:38:52] in ezekiel 8
[1:38:55] and he gave them bread from heaven i
[1:38:57] hope that was a blessing now
[1:39:00] now let's continue to move on
[1:39:05] in daniel 12 and verse 4 but thou o
[1:39:08] daniel shut up the words and seal the
[1:39:09] book even to the time of the end many
[1:39:11] shall run to and fro and knowledge shall
[1:39:13] be
[1:39:13] increased what he's talking he's talking
[1:39:14] about the opening he's talking about the
[1:39:16] sealed book right
[1:39:18] many times the prophet said he said he
[1:39:19] said daniel saw the same thing heard the
[1:39:21] same thing as
[1:39:23] john you know john heard the seven
[1:39:26] thunders right
[1:39:30] now let me throw you something here let
[1:39:31] me find the book of daniel go to daniel
[1:39:33] 12 here
[1:39:35] i can show you where he heard him
[1:39:41] in daniel 12 4 oh thou daniel shut up
[1:39:44] the words and seal the book even to the
[1:39:46] time of the end
[1:39:47] many shall run to and fro and now shall
[1:39:49] be increased right
[1:39:51] so here daniel's to seal the book but
[1:39:53] now look at verse 7
[1:39:55] and i and i heard the man clothed in
[1:39:57] linen which was upon the waters of the
[1:39:59] river
[1:39:59] and when he had held up his right hand
[1:40:02] and his left hand up unto heaven and
[1:40:03] swear by him that liveth forever and
[1:40:05] ever and it shall be for a time
[1:40:07] at times and a half and when the time
[1:40:09] shall be accomplished scattered the
[1:40:10] people
[1:40:11] of his holy people the power of the holy
[1:40:13] people all these things shall be
[1:40:15] finished
[1:40:16] just like revelations 10 but notice he
[1:40:19] says
[1:40:20] and i heard but i understood not
[1:40:23] he heard the seven thunders but he did
[1:40:25] not understand them
[1:40:28] but we know that john understood them
[1:40:30] and he was about to write
[1:40:31] because remember when he saw that
[1:40:33] mystery babylon he looked at this woman
[1:40:34] who was sitting in all this and sitting
[1:40:36] on all that and he's rich she was rich
[1:40:37] and dressed this way
[1:40:38] he was drunk with the blood of martyrs
[1:40:40] and he said i wandered with great
[1:40:41] admiration he could not understand what
[1:40:43] this was
[1:40:44] how did this woman get like this what
[1:40:46] exactly took place but when
[1:40:47] he heard the seven thunders he didn't
[1:40:49] say anything about admiration he was
[1:40:50] just ready to write him
[1:40:51] he knew them he heard them and it was
[1:40:54] clear to him
[1:40:56] i mean let's throw that out there so now
[1:41:01] would this ring forth again we know in
[1:41:04] 1951 the pillar of fire
[1:41:06] showed to the prophet right and in many
[1:41:08] photographs the pillar of fire was found
[1:41:09] in the prophet's
[1:41:10] photos let me start here in the day in
[1:41:13] the door to door 1963
[1:41:15] and i'm going i'm glad this morning to
[1:41:18] see
[1:41:18] many of my minister friends brother
[1:41:20] outlaw there i noticed him when i raised
[1:41:22] him up from he goes from phoenix
[1:41:24] and i'm very happy to see you down here
[1:41:26] brother outlaw

[1:41:50] that's right tony he says so i've got
[1:41:53] off to that one up to brother williams
[1:41:54] not long ago
[1:41:55] up at phoenix you know i said tucson i
[1:41:58] live here you know
[1:42:00] so i had a kind of hold up kind of a
[1:42:03] hold up for this place
[1:42:05] you see and up on this mountain here
[1:42:07] look down to jericho
[1:42:09] and see our brother and while we're

[1:42:13] uh uh so he types uh jericho and tucson
[1:42:16] and all those things to what
[1:42:17] over there what was he talking about
[1:42:20] what was he trying to express
[1:42:22] and then one time he got pulled over the
[1:42:24] police
[1:42:25] and the police see i think it was light
[1:42:27] was out he says i couldn't make a
[1:42:28] policeman last night give me a ticket
[1:42:30] believing that
[1:42:31] that that that that was jerusalem i was
[1:42:34] on the road going up here by apache
[1:42:35] junction
[1:42:36] and one of my lights went off the
[1:42:38] headlight the dimmer and i was trying to
[1:42:39] make it to a filling station
[1:42:41] when the other one went off so he's in
[1:42:42] complete darkness
[1:42:44] and i happened to look behind me and i
[1:42:46] seen this red light whoop he says and
[1:42:48] stop me he says you know what i stopped
[1:42:49] before
[1:42:50] i said yes sir them lights is out.
[1:42:53] the policeman said that's right he says
[1:42:55] you know it's a violation to do that he
[1:42:56] says yes sir but i couldn't get to the
[1:42:58] station i couldn't find anything
[1:42:59] i was trying to fire on he says where
[1:43:01] are you from he says brother branson
[1:43:03] from jerusalem
[1:43:05] he says where he says jerusalem he
[1:43:07] looked at my license he says are you a
[1:43:08] minister
[1:43:09] he said yes he says he says i'm from
[1:43:12] jerusalem he says where is that across
[1:43:13] the sea
[1:43:14] no sir it's up on that here hill called
[1:43:16] tucson
[1:43:17] so jerusalem was tucson and phoenix was
[1:43:20] jericho right
[1:43:21] and the prophet likened it to that he
[1:43:24] says i've been in down
[1:43:25] here in jericho here ministering in the
[1:43:27] valley
[1:43:29] and brother bramble kind of jokes he
[1:43:30] says i wonder he didn't get a ticket
[1:43:31] because i was messing with him you know
[1:43:33] just paraphrasing there he says
[1:43:36] uh he's dealing now he says and i find
[1:43:39] one of my greatest moments of
[1:43:41] of my visit to tucson i come here
[1:43:43] because that i was led to come here
[1:43:46] i come here because that holy spirit
[1:43:48] through a vision sent me
[1:43:49] here to what a desert place he says i
[1:43:53] come here because that the holy spirit
[1:43:54] threw a vision sent me here i know that
[1:43:56] might seem strange but he
[1:43:57] as far as i know anything that i know of
[1:43:59] god i was sent by a vision of tucson i'd
[1:44:02] wonder
[1:44:03] why he ever sent me to this desert place
[1:44:08] he said spiritually speaking over the
[1:44:10] city i don't know of any place that's
[1:44:12] more
[1:44:12] spiritually dead than tucson god sent
[1:44:15] him to tucson right
[1:44:17] completely spiritually a desert he says
[1:44:20] it's dead
[1:44:24] he says there's war between the churches
[1:44:26] there's fuss
[1:44:27] be between the congregation he's just
[1:44:29] there's no unity
[1:44:30] everyone's grabbing he says and holding
[1:44:32] and squeezing and trying to get this one
[1:44:34] proselyting
[1:44:35] he says it's a desert speaking
[1:44:37] spiritually
[1:44:39] what was god doing the pillar of fire
[1:44:41] showed up and now the prophet was sent
[1:44:43] to the desert
[1:44:45] what was prepping we know exactly what's
[1:44:47] prepping
[1:44:48] he says but then i read in the bible
[1:44:49] where god had sent moses away from his
[1:44:51] beloved ones and
[1:44:52] all that was dear to him and sent him
[1:44:54] into a wilderness to write the laws of
[1:44:56] the bible that was the old testament
[1:44:57] amen
[1:44:58] the first five books of the bible he
[1:45:00] said that is really
[1:45:01] that really he says is the old testament
[1:45:04] amen yes sir
[1:45:05] now he goes on to say he says and then i
[1:45:08] find
[1:45:09] the book in the new testament where paul
[1:45:11] which is the author not the author but
[1:45:12] the writer of the new testament
[1:45:14] he was also drive out from among his
[1:45:16] people by the spirit to arabia where he
[1:45:18] was in three and a half years and to
[1:45:19] find the inspiration
[1:45:21] and paul is the chief writer of the new
[1:45:23] testament
[1:45:24] see paul received inspiration to write
[1:45:26] the new testament taking
[1:45:28] all the old as a shadow setting in order
[1:45:30] god honored it and made the new
[1:45:31] testament amen yes sir
[1:45:33] absolutely so can you write
[1:45:38] and now if the old testament had to be
[1:45:40] drove out the writer
[1:45:42] to be drove out from his people into the
[1:45:44] desert the wilderness to get inspiration
[1:45:46] to write the old
[1:45:47] and in the new testament the writer had
[1:45:48] to be drove out by the author into the
[1:45:50] desert place to get an inspiration to
[1:45:52] write the new testament
[1:45:53] and the books are sealed he says with
[1:45:54] seven seals he says it would require
[1:45:57] the same
[1:46:03] i believe in these days to open those
[1:46:05] seven seals to leave what you hold dear
[1:46:08] to what you cherish in a law a little
[1:46:10] home that was given by me by the people
[1:46:12] and amongst all my friends and family
[1:46:14] and the church that was flourishing
[1:46:15] and having and lacking nothing i leave
[1:46:18] that
[1:46:19] pull right away from it and move away
[1:46:22] into the desert where you knew nobody
[1:46:23] and everything was against you
[1:46:25] look at the sacrifice one man had to
[1:46:27] make to what
[1:46:28] to have god open those seven seals
[1:46:31] he had to get alone and wait for god to
[1:46:34] move
[1:46:35] amen he says but there's something about
[1:46:37] god that he drives a man to do things
[1:46:39] that's beyond his
[1:46:40] own thinking why would brother brooks
[1:46:42] drive all the way up here to iowa
[1:46:44] god said move he says get up here feed
[1:46:46] my sheep up here
[1:46:47] he's so you can he says uh beyond his
[1:46:50] own thinking so you can be to the glory
[1:46:52] and honor of god and i feel that not
[1:46:54] self-honored
[1:46:55] i feel it a privilege that it was that
[1:46:58] it was to leave
[1:46:59] everything that i call deer to get into
[1:47:01] this wilderness and he says
[1:47:03] suffer like i have never suffered in my
[1:47:04] entire life
[1:47:06] that was the hardest portion of his life
[1:47:08] obeying god
[1:47:09] pulling from his his home pulling from
[1:47:12] his church pulling from all that moving
[1:47:13] to a desert where no one got along
[1:47:15] spiritually he said he suffered worse
[1:47:18] than
[1:47:18] all his rest of his life and here in the
[1:47:20] wilderness or this desert
[1:47:22] but i believe and in doing that and
[1:47:24] obeying what god commanded to be done
[1:47:26] here
[1:47:26] god has opened to us the mysteries of
[1:47:28] this last day and here we are with this
[1:47:31] message but it always takes that pillar
[1:47:35] of fire
[1:47:38] to appear and then god will write again
[1:47:42] amen yes sir he says now the word
[1:47:46] manifested is revealed in the revelation
[1:47:48] and here then what does that
[1:47:50] puts me if he is the shekinah glory i'm
[1:47:53] part of it amen he says oh amen
[1:47:55] that's right the word itself revealed
[1:47:57] reveals
[1:47:58] itself think the mysteries of god has
[1:48:00] made known to us this day by the same
[1:48:02] heavenly messenger it was made known
[1:48:03] unto me
[1:48:04] known unto them in the days in them days
[1:48:06] notice the same pillar fire moses simply
[1:48:08] fire
[1:48:09] uh paul all those things he said that
[1:48:11] the exact same the exact same leadership
[1:48:12] that i had
[1:48:14] amen now
[1:48:19] so if we're waiting he says now think of
[1:48:22] it the same pillar of fire that come
[1:48:23] upon those men that wrote the bible
[1:48:25] is the same purifier here today
[1:48:28] interpreting the bible amen how we thank
[1:48:31] him for that
[1:48:32] same what a comfort one identification i
[1:48:34] just read a quote you know why god had
[1:48:35] to say in the book of revelation
[1:48:38] you know what the prophet said why the
[1:48:39] book of revelation had to come
[1:48:42] because after 53 a.d when the fall would
[1:48:44] come and paul was writing
[1:48:46] letter after letter and writing the new
[1:48:47] testament new testament people were
[1:48:49] taking the new testament and twisting it
[1:48:51] and god said he had to send that book of
[1:48:53] revelation to john to come down
[1:48:55] and in the beginning of the book if you
[1:48:57] if you hear it you're blessed if you if
[1:48:58] you listen to it you're blessed if you
[1:49:00] read it you're blessed but at the end it
[1:49:01] says if you add or take away
[1:49:03] anything he had to seal it and said you
[1:49:06] cannot have any more that's it that's
[1:49:08] everything's included that's why he
[1:49:10] included the book of revelation because
[1:49:11] he had to put a seal on it
[1:49:13] no adding nor taking away the book is
[1:49:16] finished
[1:49:18] right amen sure now
[1:49:23] so now it's time
[1:49:26] can you write
[1:49:29] each mighty man of god was used of god
[1:49:32] to
[1:49:33] write the scripture but the bible says
[1:49:35] that you are written epistles
[1:49:37] he says you are written epistles in our
[1:49:38] hearts is written
[1:49:40] you you are our epistle written our
[1:49:42] hearts known and read of
[1:49:44] all men the way you
[1:49:47] act the way you live is depend
[1:49:50] everything depends
[1:49:51] on you i just taught a brother two weeks
[1:49:53] ago on what i call
[1:49:54] the loophole of salvation in matthew 25
[1:49:59] why were those people saved on the right
[1:50:01] hand because of the way they treated the
[1:50:03] bride of jesus christ
[1:50:05] so you must act accordingly absolutely
[1:50:07] every time in the last couple years you
[1:50:10] know how many times i've been on a job
[1:50:12] site
[1:50:13] and the man i'm working for comes up to
[1:50:14] me with a cold cold bottle of water said
[1:50:16] simon
[1:50:18] i have to give this to you i was working
[1:50:21] at university toledo
[1:50:22] i was fixing the roof train and it was a
[1:50:24] tight tight spot
[1:50:25] and he was an old man he was going to
[1:50:27] retire in three months and i told his
[1:50:29] brother i witnessed to him a little bit
[1:50:30] by baptism he's like ah
[1:50:31] uh i think you're going a little too far
[1:50:33] listen but he was a bad he was a
[1:50:34] christian
[1:50:35] and i was the last day i was going to be
[1:50:37] there i said i can't remember the name i
[1:50:38] think it's bob
[1:50:38] i said bob i'm going to be done here in
[1:50:40] about three hours he's a sigh i'm taking
[1:50:41] off early day
[1:50:43] he said give me a second runs back
[1:50:45] downstairs i'm still working
[1:50:46] and he walked the steps three steps he
[1:50:49] said simon i had to give you this cold
[1:50:51] this cold beverage would you do would
[1:50:52] you please drink it i said absolutely
[1:50:57] three weeks ago i was sent to a
[1:50:58] millionaire's house
[1:51:00] there was a sewage ejector problem and
[1:51:03] i'm thinking million oh man it's gonna
[1:51:04] be a mansion and
[1:51:05] it's gonna be sweet and i'll just take
[1:51:06] my shoes off go down there probably a
[1:51:08] finished basement concrete i just pop
[1:51:09] the lid pull the huge ejector pull out
[1:51:11] this net you know what it was
[1:51:12] it wasn't like that he was on a
[1:51:15] he was on a crawl space and that sewage
[1:51:19] was come down into that ejector pit
[1:51:21] and it was seeping out seeping seeping i
[1:51:23] went into a cesspool
[1:51:25] jumped down there with my headlight and
[1:51:26] i'm like oh god to help me
[1:51:29] why did you make me a plumber and i
[1:51:32] humbled myself
[1:51:33] and i went down there with my gloves
[1:51:35] which were not waterproof you had to put
[1:51:36] your hands and just pull and go and
[1:51:38] i'm i'm not scared of corona trust me
[1:51:41] i've been in it all
[1:51:43] i pulled that thing checked it found out
[1:51:47] was wrong this and that
[1:51:48] set it down and the man said simon
[1:51:51] here's a here's a glass of water for you
[1:51:54] i witnessed to him but he said he goes
[1:51:56] he gave me actually three of them he
[1:51:57] said make sure you drink this is for
[1:51:58] this is from me
[1:51:59] something cold thank you so much for
[1:52:01] helping me
[1:52:02] you know what i did i drank that water
[1:52:04] because i know these people cannot
[1:52:07] understand he didn't know this little
[1:52:09] five foot three and a half
[1:52:10] plumber was a seed of god
[1:52:14] but i know when that offer comes to take
[1:52:15] that and drink that
[1:52:19] is that a loophole no that's the truth
[1:52:22] that's the word of god
[1:52:23] only a seed of god will bless the bride
[1:52:25] amen
[1:52:26] sure amen so if we are to right now
[1:52:30] he says but if that's uh uh he says have
[1:52:33] you found that blessed hiding place from
[1:52:35] the wrath remember there are
[1:52:37] not two hiding places there's just one
[1:52:40] you might be a good member of some
[1:52:41] church he says which i have nothing evil
[1:52:43] to say
[1:52:44] he's but that's if that's all you have
[1:52:46] and your life isn't compared with the
[1:52:48] book of
[1:52:49] acts remember these signs shall follow
[1:52:51] them to believe now
[1:52:52] the prophet also said he said there be a
[1:52:54] people false anointed at the time he
[1:52:56] said would be preaching
[1:52:57] mark 16 preaching mark saying displaying
[1:53:00] mark 16 and yet there'll be one word off
[1:53:04] science was miracles are those
[1:53:05] absolutely said no you'll know them by
[1:53:07] their
[1:53:07] fruits not by their gifts not by this
[1:53:10] not by that
[1:53:10] not by miracles and signs and this that
[1:53:12] you'll know them by the fruits they live
[1:53:16] and as the man of god taught malachi 4
[1:53:18] he said he said
[1:53:19] these these fruits are the spirit he
[1:53:21] says there's imposters
[1:53:23] imitators of each one each one can be
[1:53:26] mimicked
[1:53:29] and that's why you have to give it the
[1:53:30] word test listen to what they say
[1:53:32] they're staying with the word are they
[1:53:33] saying exactly what the scripture says
[1:53:35] are they meaning just like we saw in
[1:53:36] john 6
[1:53:38] are they saying well moses he gave us
[1:53:40] all the bread are they meaning brother
[1:53:41] bran are they meaning god
[1:53:44] but that takes the holy ghost
[1:53:47] amen now and joel 2 says i will restore
[1:53:50] you the years of the
[1:53:52] the locusts the the have eaten the
[1:53:54] cankerworm the caterpillar and the
[1:53:55] palmer worm right
[1:53:57] um now the palmer worm
[1:54:00] represents the fruits right which is
[1:54:02] eats the fruits of the spirit up
[1:54:04] then the locusts represent the leaves or
[1:54:06] they ate up the leaves which is divine
[1:54:07] fellowship
[1:54:08] the cankerworm uh devoured the bark or
[1:54:11] that lifeline
[1:54:12] and the caterpillar was the sucker of
[1:54:14] life or denomination
[1:54:15] do you know how the devil works
[1:54:19] god showed me how this works
[1:54:23] by a quote i hope you i want to read
[1:54:26] this
[1:54:28] do you know how the devil you know the
[1:54:30] devil works in textbook form
[1:54:31] just like god does you know brother
[1:54:33] jesse he was down in guyana
[1:54:35] with brother brooks i believe and they
[1:54:36] woke him up he just got in preaching a
[1:54:38] good service or whatever they would come
[1:54:39] out knocking on the door bro jesse we've
[1:54:41] got a demon-possessed lady right
[1:54:43] well jesse said yes we'll go pray but
[1:54:45] jesse said he's never done this before
[1:54:47] he said he laid his hand on the woman
[1:54:49] and started rebuking his spirit and he
[1:54:50] he said that her hands started grabbing
[1:54:52] her hand his hands really tight
[1:54:54] and then he kept rebuking the devil keep
[1:54:55] reviewing the devil come out of the name
[1:54:57] of jesus christ
[1:54:57] and he said that she started to bite his
[1:54:59] hand
[1:55:01] and he said it started hurt a little bit
[1:55:02] but he just kept rebuking and all of a
[1:55:03] sudden he said
[1:55:04] she let out a scream and fell down as
[1:55:06] dead
[1:55:07] and when brother jesse told me this he
[1:55:09] says textbook bible
[1:55:12] because whenever a spirit comes out
[1:55:13] it'll rent the person they fall down
[1:55:15] just slain
[1:55:16] textbook bible you know the devil works
[1:55:18] that way
[1:55:20] everything works the same let me give
[1:55:22] you an example here i want to show you
[1:55:23] something here
[1:55:24] in first corinthians 11
[1:55:31] our church our assembly has actually
[1:55:35] experienced this
[1:55:38] we had started our assembly and
[1:55:42] brother bart had a dream and god
[1:55:44] supernaturally showed me something
[1:55:46] through
[1:55:47] my dogs i had two sisters two dogs
[1:55:50] and they for one for some reason they
[1:55:52] started getting
[1:55:54] angry at each other and they were like
[1:55:55] buddies from birth they got
[1:55:57] angry each other when this and this and
[1:55:58] this and this and they were fighting and
[1:55:59] they've never done that before
[1:56:01] i said lord what are you trying to show
[1:56:02] me and then he showed it to me
[1:56:06] but now remember this is something for
[1:56:08] us to watch out for
[1:56:10] this is textbook bible how the
[1:56:12] antichrist comes in
[1:56:14] in first corinthians 11 verse 17
[1:56:18] now in this i declare unto you i praise
[1:56:20] you not that you come together not for
[1:56:21] the better but for the worse
[1:56:23] for first off for first of all when you
[1:56:26] come together in the church
[1:56:28] i hear that there are divisions among
[1:56:31] you
[1:56:32] so god allows the devil to kick in and
[1:56:35] form little groups and divisions and
[1:56:37] maybe there's a church within a church
[1:56:39] or two separate churches together with
[1:56:41] one but the first thing we're going to
[1:56:42] see is divisions in the church and
[1:56:44] that's why
[1:56:44] god showed me with brother bart called
[1:56:46] me said brother so i had the stream
[1:56:47] and i'm going to tell you the problem
[1:56:48] the church i said hold a second i'll
[1:56:50] tell you i said division he said how do
[1:56:51] you know i said god already showed me
[1:56:54] he showed him spiritually he showed me
[1:56:55] through the natural
[1:56:58] so first of all when you come together i
[1:57:00] hear there'll be divisions among you and
[1:57:01] i partly
[1:57:02] believe it now notice after the visions
[1:57:05] what's the next step
[1:57:06] for there must also be there must be
[1:57:09] also heresies
[1:57:10] among you you know what the next thing
[1:57:12] sprung up in our church
[1:57:14] a heresy a false teaching
[1:57:17] afterwards brother cam met the brother
[1:57:19] in a minute back and said hey
[1:57:21] you need to correct that he said i'll
[1:57:23] correct that if i feel led to brother
[1:57:24] cam said no you will correct it he says
[1:57:26] if i feel led to king says you're gone
[1:57:30] but first there was a division in the
[1:57:32] church
[1:57:33] resistance towards a pastor
[1:57:37] and then a heresy strung up because
[1:57:39] that's textbook bible
[1:57:40] but why was all this
[1:57:43] for there must be heresies also among
[1:57:45] you for
[1:57:47] that they which be which are approved
[1:57:49] may be manifest
[1:57:50] among you that kind of stuff
[1:57:54] god allows to rise up in the in those
[1:57:57] that are teaching false
[1:57:58] to show that these are the truth that's
[1:58:01] textbook
[1:58:02] bible
[1:58:05] now if we're to write the book of acts
[1:58:08] again if god's going to use us to write
[1:58:09] the book of acts again we have to
[1:58:10] identify what spirits
[1:58:12] and how they work did you know
[1:58:14] organization
[1:58:15] and denomination are not the same thing
[1:58:17] they actually accomplish separately they
[1:58:19] accomplished two different things
[1:58:20] separately
[1:58:21] in order do you know which one's first
[1:58:26] the bible says i'm sorry i'm sorry not
[1:58:29] bible the church age book look how the
[1:58:30] prophet breaks us down
[1:58:31] he says and the very same spirit and
[1:58:33] doctrine is right amongst the
[1:58:34] protestants and it's called denomination
[1:58:36] he says nicolaitanism is organization
[1:58:40] humanizing the leadership of the church
[1:58:42] and thereby disposing the spirit
[1:58:46] so the way for satan to get into the
[1:58:48] church is he's got to
[1:58:50] have the people elevate and magnify a
[1:58:52] man and then when that happens when
[1:58:54] these people switch from the leadership
[1:58:55] of the holy ghost
[1:58:56] now to a man the spirit of god leaves
[1:59:00] and now when the spirit of god leaves
[1:59:02] now the prophet said you can bring in a
[1:59:04] denominational mindset or
[1:59:06] denominational spirits and now he says
[1:59:08] now they can pull
[1:59:09] and make different creeds
[1:59:12] that's the order of that antichrist
[1:59:14] spirit how it works
[1:59:16] i saw that quote i was like what
[1:59:17] happened i've been looking for that in
[1:59:18] like 10 years
[1:59:20] oh now i understand how it works
[1:59:23] are you mad now and you can stand by the
[1:59:26] grace of god let's stand here
[1:59:30] i want to read a couple quotes here
[1:59:39] he says he says but let me tell you
[1:59:41] brother if the holy ghost is real
[1:59:44] in the church today the kind of church
[1:59:46] it had that wrote the book of acts
[1:59:47] behind it the church of living god the
[1:59:49] church of jesus christ
[1:59:50] become again alive by the same holy
[1:59:53] ghost that fell on the day of pentecost
[1:59:55] it will write a book of acts behind it
[1:59:59] what are we waiting for the bible said
[2:00:02] not by might
[2:00:04] not by power but by my spirit there is
[2:00:07] coming a time
[2:00:08] that after god has healed off and pruned
[2:00:10] every false branch
[2:00:12] and it's now and now it's time to bring
[2:00:14] forth life
[2:00:15] back into the vine and push forth the
[2:00:17] branch it's gonna happen
[2:00:19] we are now what being patient waiting on
[2:00:22] god
[2:00:22] to bring forth that life back out to the
[2:00:25] church you know in the
[2:00:26] in in one of the was the feast of the
[2:00:28] trumpets
[2:00:29] he said the holy ghost has been bound
[2:00:32] the holy ghost has been bound
[2:00:33] for 2000 years
[2:00:37] and if we have the holy ghost inside of
[2:00:38] us and it's not living according we're
[2:00:41] binding it
[2:00:43] we ourselves are even though we're
[2:00:45] sealed even though we
[2:00:46] are the bride of christ but if we are
[2:00:48] binding him
[2:00:50] and not letting him work through seven
[2:00:53] church ages they had the holy ghost
[2:00:55] literally the very life of god in them
[2:00:57] and they could the bible said god we did
[2:00:59] ignorance for a season
[2:01:03] but now that we have the saints of god
[2:01:05] we have now the open word what's left
[2:01:09] we have to yield
[2:01:13] and as i've said under my pastor brother
[2:01:16] camp for almost 10
[2:01:17] almost 10 years now you know what the
[2:01:19] culmination of
[2:01:20] all where all the problems lie
[2:01:24] that's our fault lack of prayer
[2:01:28] the prophet said if we had a praying
[2:01:31] church
[2:01:33] i'm talking like that brother saying the
[2:01:35] other night about that sweet hour of
[2:01:37] prayer
[2:01:38] if we could have a praying church he
[2:01:39] says the signs of one will be
[2:01:41] multiplying among us
[2:01:45] and that's good but what is the pattern
[2:01:47] remember what is the pattern
[2:01:49] my pastor had he had evangelists come in
[2:01:51] he started preaching this and had a good
[2:01:52] services
[2:01:53] he met the man in the back and brother
[2:01:56] cam was kind of testing him
[2:01:58] that's what a pastor does the pastor's
[2:02:00] overseer the watcher
[2:02:01] he's the man that's like hey what's
[2:02:04] going on here
[2:02:07] and he said he said brother he says he
[2:02:09] says you know i'm so excited and he
[2:02:11] and he said it in such a way he says i'm
[2:02:12] so excited for the
[2:02:14] book of acts and how the local assembly
[2:02:17] is going to have all nine spiritual
[2:02:18] gifts and the brother said
[2:02:19] brother we already have nine all-night
[2:02:21] spiritual gifts in the entire body
[2:02:24] he says it's worldwide and he said no
[2:02:27] brother the prophet said
[2:02:28] in the local assembly
[2:02:33] do we have higher heights to reach
[2:02:35] absolutely do we have greater
[2:02:37] grounds higher grounds to reach
[2:02:39] [Laughter]
[2:02:42] just type in local assembly local gifts
[2:02:45] he said
[2:02:45] he said the true church will have all
[2:02:47] nine spiritual gifts living
[2:02:49] in the local he does not say world or
[2:02:52] the body of christ he's at the local
[2:02:54] assembly
[2:02:55] is it possible all things are possible
[2:02:58] is it going to happen absolutely because
[2:03:00] he said i will restore
[2:03:02] amen saith the lord absolutely
[2:03:05] so our goal is not necessarily march 16
[2:03:08] but we want what
[2:03:09] all of it a higher life
[2:03:13] everyone has a psalm or or a revelation
[2:03:17] or or this or that all edifying each
[2:03:20] other
[2:03:21] every one of us has a ministry i don't
[2:03:24] care who you are you have a ministry
[2:03:27] how are we going to win souls for christ
[2:03:28] how are we sayings of god there's a move
[2:03:30] coming like brother says there's a
[2:03:31] ladder rain
[2:03:32] coming and it's going to produce it's
[2:03:34] going to mature
[2:03:35] what we are amen
[2:03:40] he says that when his church sits
[2:03:41] together in heavenly places then the
[2:03:43] fullness of the power of god is in his
[2:03:45] church
[2:03:45] the prophet said i long for the day when
[2:03:47] the anonymization of fire is back in
[2:03:49] the church he says each one of us
[2:03:52] holding spiritual gifts spiritual
[2:03:53] offices coming together
[2:03:55] bringing the pillar of fire back again
[2:03:58] to what write the book of acts one more
[2:04:02] time
[2:04:04] amen let's say let's sing a little
[2:04:07] something
[2:04:08] saints we've gotta know we're a small
[2:04:09] church and you guys are all probably
[2:04:11] thoroughly repented and
[2:04:13] keeping yourselves right but if you need
[2:04:14] prayer we're more than happy
[2:04:16] to pray for you by the grace of god and
[2:04:18] we know god's he's
[2:04:20] he hears our prayers he answered them i
[2:04:24] gave a little testimony i was
[2:04:25] praying for a certain thing about
[2:04:27] getting a house for somebody
[2:04:28] to help them and for two days in a row i
[2:04:30] come home from work and i'd instantly
[2:04:32] just hit the prayer and i started
[2:04:33] praying god
[2:04:34] and in two days the holy ghost told
[2:04:36] brother brooks to call me
[2:04:38] i said brother brooks uh what's what
[2:04:40] what's going on he goes brother the holy
[2:04:41] ghost told me to
[2:04:42] call you i was like oh he goes what's
[2:04:44] been on your mind i said
[2:04:45] and i told him this and this and he gave
[2:04:47] me his advice and he told me which what
[2:04:49] to do
[2:04:51] he gave me his advice and i took that
[2:04:52] advice and i made a decision upon that
[2:04:54] advice but what god heard me
[2:04:58] if we get down and really seek god with
[2:05:01] all sincerity
[2:05:02] with all the bible talks about the
[2:05:04] sincerity of the bread the bread of
[2:05:05] sincerity of truth
[2:05:09] we're gonna we're gonna see it
[2:05:12] now here's what i kind of like he says
[2:05:14] he says uh he says god bless you boys
[2:05:16] god bless you there god bless you all
[2:05:18] over the building he says your hands let
[2:05:20] the holy spirit waken me up from the
[2:05:22] slumber that i'm sitting in and here's
[2:05:24] our great call our great desire i want
[2:05:27] to be filled with the holy spirit now
[2:05:29] this is the prophet his desires
[2:05:30] i want to be filled with the holy spirit
[2:05:32] in such a way that my human senses will
[2:05:34] not function
[2:05:35] unless it is the will of god i want to
[2:05:38] be led of the spirit
[2:05:39] he says the spirit is the sixth sense
[2:05:42] god gave man five senses they wasn't to
[2:05:45] control you he says what the holy ghost
[2:05:48] is sent to control you the five senses
[2:05:50] here
[2:05:50] is to contact the earthly he said but
[2:05:53] that's not the control oh this is hot
[2:05:54] well it's only
[2:05:55] hot if god allows you to get burned amen
[2:05:58] ever hear that testimony brother ray
[2:06:00] over in lorraine or sheffield
[2:06:02] he's working at the steel plant there
[2:06:04] he's working a steel plant
[2:06:05] and his job was to flip over 900 pound
[2:06:08] steel rolls of
[2:06:10] rolls of steel and he was slipping and
[2:06:13] went over and flipping went over and his
[2:06:14] his bar got caught and the roll flipped
[2:06:17] over and
[2:06:18] landed on his hand 900 pounds
[2:06:22] and he said brother he goes god must
[2:06:23] have given me the power of samson he
[2:06:25] said he reached out like this
[2:06:26] lifted it up and threw it off one hand
[2:06:29] 900 well probably 450 pounds on one side
[2:06:33] and he said he pulled his hand up like
[2:06:34] this and his fingers were flat
[2:06:37] blood shooting out on the corners do you
[2:06:40] think he went to the hospital called
[2:06:41] 9-1-1
[2:06:43] he is in such a place he said this isn't
[2:06:46] even real
[2:06:48] and he finished out 12 more hours of
[2:06:50] work
[2:06:52] and he said by the end of that end of
[2:06:53] that week everything was back to normal
[2:06:56] this is not real
[2:07:00] he remember the prophet said he's in
[2:07:01] that realm over there is more real than
[2:07:02] this one
[2:07:03] and you must command this to to do
[2:07:08] and brother ray anointed his he told me
[2:07:10] that same testimony
[2:07:12] and it was a year later i was screwed i
[2:07:14] was up 14 foot in the air and i was
[2:07:16] screwing a screw with a drill
[2:07:17] gun this way which we all know i learned
[2:07:20] i should have learned a long time ago is
[2:07:22] not the way to screw yours
[2:07:24] and i hit that thing and it went right
[2:07:25] in my eye
[2:07:27] and i was 14 in the air i'm sitting on
[2:07:29] us on a stud
[2:07:30] and i said lord god right in
[2:07:33] i mean and my mind went right
[2:07:37] back to brother ray and his testimony i
[2:07:40] said lord
[2:07:42] my dad was standing right there saw me
[2:07:44] he's like silence him and i was like dad
[2:07:45] just hold on

[2:20:40] the bottle was created but if the coke
[2:20:43] represents
[2:20:44] god it was not is that right
[2:20:47] that's what makes us sons of god the
[2:20:50] flesh is not it's
[2:20:51] created has a beginning in the ending
[2:20:56] but the god inside is eternal
[2:21:00] it's simple but we can make it
[2:21:02] complicated if we want to
[2:21:05] but just as i said last week if you
[2:21:07] could run
[2:21:08] understand as he said the godhead of the
[2:21:10] relationship
[2:21:12] between the son and jesus our god and
[2:21:15] the son
[2:21:16] you understand what he means father i
[2:21:18] would that they be one
[2:21:20] even as we are one it is a mystery
[2:21:24] it is a wonderful mystery i appreciate
[2:21:26] the brother bringing
[2:21:27] the word of god the way he has
[2:21:31] and you had to really listen to hear and
[2:21:34] see
[2:21:35] where he was trying to take us but one
[2:21:38] thing for certain
[2:21:40] if we can see that this we're at the end
[2:21:42] of this
[2:21:43] all of these things have already been
[2:21:44] done we we see it historically
[2:21:46] [Music]
[2:21:48] profoundly right in the word of god
[2:21:50] hidden from the intellectuals and the
[2:21:52] ddds and the ldds
[2:21:54] but then god takes it and he brings us a
[2:21:57] prophet and i like what he said malachi
[2:21:59] 4 i send you elijah that was really good
[2:22:04] because one thing for certain our
[2:22:06] marriage
[2:22:08] is marriage to the lamb
[2:22:11] we wed him and i thank god for
[2:22:14] everything
[2:22:15] many people don't understand sometimes
[2:22:18] they think you're trying to cut brother
[2:22:19] branham out of the picture
[2:22:21] and god knows that it's not true you
[2:22:23] can't preach
[2:22:24] about noah i mean the flood without
[2:22:27] bringing noah
[2:22:28] you can't preach about the exodus
[2:22:30] without bringing in moses
[2:22:32] you can't even preach about god without
[2:22:34] bringing in jesus christ
[2:22:36] and you and i must understand that what
[2:22:38] god is doing now he's trying to refocus
[2:22:41] us
[2:22:42] all of us because we have all fallen
[2:22:45] into a system of religion
[2:22:48] and we're trying to pull away from every
[2:22:50] system
[2:22:52] because where the spirit of the lord is
[2:22:53] there's liberty and we want to be where
[2:22:56] we can be led by the spirit is that
[2:22:58] right
[2:22:59] you know here was a prophet of god
[2:23:02] getting ready to take a plane uh
[2:23:04] out and then all of a sudden god said
[2:23:05] keep walking i wonder how many times
[2:23:08] how many of us would have done that i
[2:23:10] got a plane to catch i can't
[2:23:12] i can't miss this plane but god said
[2:23:15] keep walking
[2:23:20] keep walking that's all i'm saying
[2:23:24] that connection that unity that oneness
[2:23:26] is where god is taking us and i'm not
[2:23:28] going to preach
[2:23:29] even already did the preaching i've been
[2:23:31] blessed by god's grace i've been blessed
[2:23:33] brother
[2:23:34] and uh you know a lot of times people
[2:23:37] are not used to teaching because i try
[2:23:39] to teach and i preach
[2:23:41] but you know to draw out the things on
[2:23:43] the board was really wonderful
[2:23:45] and we forget that the that the bride is
[2:23:48] perfected
[2:23:49] by the five-fold ministry pastor can't
[2:23:52] do it on his own
[2:23:53] evangelists can't do it on we need
[2:23:55] teachers we need those who can come in
[2:23:57] here
[2:23:57] and draw it out and bring it to us in
[2:23:59] the way that you did brother i
[2:24:00] appreciate that
[2:24:02] you love the lord i do and i know you
[2:24:05] too and i'm gonna let the song leader
[2:24:07] whoever
[2:24:07] saying continue singing
[2:24:27] another refreshing from the lord amen
