[38:57] i if i had been if i was a machine i

[39:03] tired like everybody else how about that

[39:09] luke 12 32-34
[39:14] are you there
[39:16] fear not little flock
[39:18] for it is your father's good pleasure
[39:21] to give you the kingdom
[39:24] sell that you have
[39:26] give alms provide yourselves bags which
[39:30] wax not old
[39:31] a treasure in the heavens that faileth
[39:34] not
[39:35] where no thief approaches
[39:37] neither moth corrupt
[39:40] for where your treasure is
[39:42] there will your heart be also
[39:46] one more scripture
[39:48] revelations 21
[39:54] revelations 21
[40:04] 21-11
[40:18] everybody there
[40:20] having the glory of god
[40:22] and her light
[40:24] was like unto a stone most precious
[40:28] even
[40:30] like a jasper stone
[40:32] clear as crystal let's read the tenth
[40:34] verse i'm sorry
[40:35] and he carried me away in the spirit
[40:39] to a great and high mountain
[40:42] and showed me that great city
[40:44] the holy jerusalem
[40:46] descending out of heaven from god
[40:50] let us pray
[40:53] our gracious father we come before you
[40:55] lord as humble as we know howard
[40:57] we thank you for this time and
[40:59] opportunity lord to worship you and
[41:01] in your word we realize oh god that
[41:04] without you we are nothing and we
[41:07] realize oh god that
[41:08] you are our everything we thank you
[41:11] father for
[41:12] being so real to us for being our
[41:15] heartbeat our life our breath
[41:18] and lord god we pray this evening that
[41:20] your perfect will will be done
[41:22] as we surrender ourselves our souls our
[41:25] minds our body to you
[41:27] have thine own way lord in jesus
[41:29] christ's name we pray amen
[41:32] you may be seated
[41:35] i have been uh
[41:38] just thinking about a lot of things
[41:42] the meetings as i said in south carolina
[41:44] were
[41:46] really really great they were really
[41:48] good
[41:49] and you know when we say that word good
[41:51] it almost feels like i'm cheating
[41:54] it's beyond good
[41:56] but we know one thing for certain for
[41:58] those who heard the word of god
[42:01] if they really listened
[42:03] no no doubt they was in for a change
[42:08] some came up for the holy baptism of the
[42:11] holy ghost
[42:12] and as far as i know it appears that
[42:14] they did get it
[42:16] it was really really phenomenal how the
[42:19] word of the lord did
[42:21] what god did what he did
[42:23] there was a lot of dancing a lot of
[42:26] worship a lot of praising
[42:28] and there was a lot of weeping
[42:32] i like to entitle this message because
[42:35] well i guess my thought of the bride and
[42:37] i'm going to try to take my time like
[42:39] i'm doing now
[42:40] um
[42:41] if he permits
[42:44] the changing of his mask
[42:48] and
[42:48] in our day
[42:51] and when we think about that we must
[42:54] come to know
[42:56] to know your position in christ is a
[42:58] revelation
[43:02] and only god can give that to you
[43:06] so i trust by god's grace that
[43:09] god is working with you to vindicate
[43:12] himself in you
[43:15] uh because you got to understand the
[43:17] bride
[43:18] in this day
[43:20] has to have more than words
[43:23] she is a powerhouse
[43:26] she must be
[43:28] one that god vindicates
[43:31] you know resolve all doubts
[43:34] that she is bride she will be different
[43:36] from all the rest
[43:38] because not only will she have the
[43:41] authority of god
[43:43] but she will also have his life
[43:47] i took a quote from arenas
[43:50] you know
[43:52] we remember him from the church age book
[43:55] and uranus says
[43:57] the glory of god
[43:59] is a man
[44:01] fully alive
[44:03] but the life of a man
[44:06] is the vision of god
[44:09] human action takes on an even greater
[44:13] significance
[44:14] when we can consider this statement
[44:18] for if god's glory is a man fully alive
[44:22] then man's life
[44:24] must be a noble thing
[44:27] and
[44:28] when we see and say these things because
[44:32] we have
[44:33] lived as human beings and and basically
[44:36] what we look at as being man it's not
[44:39] really man it's just it's just a
[44:41] perversion of him
[44:43] because only god can give you what a
[44:45] real man is
[44:48] jesus christ was the first real man at
[44:51] the adam
[44:53] his life was perfect
[44:56] he loved god in
[44:57] every way
[45:00] he was the word made manifest
[45:04] and he never did one thing wrong
[45:07] amen as a man i'm speaking
[45:10] because as god we know the bible said in
[45:13] him dwelt the fullness of the godhead
[45:15] bodily
[45:18] jesus wasn't 99.9
[45:21] faith
[45:22] he was a hundred percent
[45:25] now the bible tells us not to fear
[45:27] because we're living in the most evilest
[45:30] age ever
[45:32] we've never seen things the way they are
[45:35] never have been
[45:37] because what you've got now you've got
[45:39] seven church ages uh kind of that's
[45:42] that's kind of moved in together
[45:45] so so all of the wickedness in every age
[45:47] is now
[45:50] coming to a head in this
[45:52] day and age
[45:54] and the people who lived in ephesus
[45:57] would have never made it in this age
[46:01] and all of the other ages
[46:03] god hand picked you for this age because
[46:06] he knew you could do it
[46:09] he understood your makeup
[46:12] now think about if you got 6 000 going
[46:14] on
[46:15] years of sinful acts
[46:18] in your dna
[46:19] not just sin for acts plagues and
[46:22] viruses and all of those things that
[46:24] have attached themselves to
[46:27] and god says
[46:30] you can make it
[46:34] i believe with all my heart that
[46:37] god has already equipped us you see
[46:39] that's what the prophet said that god
[46:41] equips you
[46:43] he doesn't just put you out there with
[46:45] with empty hands
[46:47] but he equips you every man every woman
[46:49] for their age god equips them
[46:53] so they can be
[46:54] victorious in their age
[46:57] one of the things that i i i know that
[47:00] we must do
[47:02] here the bible says that we've got to
[47:05] basically give everything away
[47:08] sell everything and that means things of
[47:11] value to you
[47:13] things that you treasure things that you
[47:15] know you you would idolize
[47:18] god said you got to surrender all those
[47:20] kinds of things
[47:23] and he says but listen
[47:25] there are other things that you can
[47:27] consider to have
[47:29] and these things are heavenly things
[47:33] wherever your wherever your heart is
[47:36] there is your treasure the things of
[47:39] earth can be taken from you stolen from
[47:41] you whatever
[47:43] they're not eternal they're just
[47:44] temporal
[47:46] but here jesus is saying i'm giving you
[47:48] something that's not only everlasting
[47:51] but eternal
[47:53] and you and i must understand that what
[47:55] we are doing now
[47:58] we're making choices
[48:01] as i've said i believe here
[48:03] you know it's working with the mind
[48:06] if satan can change your mind
[48:09] he can change your character
[48:11] is that right
[48:12] and it's vice versa
[48:14] if god changes your mind he changes your
[48:18] character
[48:19] because that's what satan did to eve in
[48:21] the beginning he changed her mind about
[48:24] the word
[48:26] and when he changed his mind her mind
[48:28] when she changed her mind about the word
[48:31] he changed her character with it and
[48:33] when i say character i'm talking about
[48:35] nature
[48:36] if the word the word we know
[48:40] is the only thing that could change the
[48:42] human nature
[48:43] it is the only thing that has the power
[48:46] to change you from a sinner to a saint
[48:49] it is the only thing that can take a
[48:51] filthy unclean dirty worm like us and
[48:54] make us a prince or a king or you know
[48:58] it has the power to transform you
[49:02] when we the dangers i said before here
[49:05] the danger of allowing our faith to
[49:08] become systematic
[49:10] is is that when your faith becomes
[49:13] systematic or your religion becomes
[49:16] systematic you you become blind
[49:19] you you know it's like jesus said you
[49:22] have left
[49:23] your first love
[49:25] and when you begin to argue
[49:28] and fuss about doctrine or issues and
[49:31] things of that nature then you have
[49:33] allowed the devil to be with you
[49:36] and you and i must understand that the
[49:38] word of god is not to be striving us
[49:41] with it it's to be taken
[49:43] just as it is
[49:45] and god will reveal to you
[49:48] what he means
[49:50] i think in our in in this time i find
[49:54] that there's only a few people that's
[49:56] really
[49:57] are searching and seeking and thirsting
[49:59] for god
[50:01] uh you know many of the message
[50:03] believers
[50:04] as we call them has become so complacent
[50:08] they're so satisfied with just being
[50:11] identified with malachi 4 and being able
[50:15] to say uh you know revelation 10 you
[50:18] know one through seven the mighty angel
[50:20] came down
[50:21] or saint luke you know you know the son
[50:23] of man but but see what we fail to see
[50:28] is that there is a message within a
[50:30] message
[50:32] you can read the message you can listen
[50:34] to the message
[50:36] but there's a secret within it
[50:39] and god reveals to you
[50:42] things who if your bride
[50:44] god will unlock those mysteries to you
[50:50] but if you're not he hides himself
[50:53] and this is why we've seen so many
[50:55] fallen brothers and sisters
[50:58] because when they thought they knew the
[51:00] message
[51:01] they never did get it
[51:04] and of course
[51:05] you'll never be able to understand what
[51:07] he's saying
[51:08] without the holy ghost
[51:12] coming from the message elijah
[51:14] the prophet
[51:15] brother adam tells us about paul and how
[51:17] that anointing was with paul
[51:20] that's 173rd paragraph if you want to
[51:23] look it up sometime
[51:24] but i just wanted to pull a little
[51:26] phrase out of it
[51:28] because he says like the spirit from
[51:30] elijah to elisha
[51:34] there was a carrying on of the holy
[51:36] spirit did y'all know that the spirit of
[51:38] elijah was the holy ghost
[51:40] how many men y'all thought elijah had
[51:42] his own spirit
[51:43] we don't get the spirit of a man
[51:45] we get the spirit of god
[51:47] and the spirit on elijah and elisha was
[51:52] christ
[51:53] the holy spirit
[51:55] right
[51:56] i think sometimes people think when they
[51:57] get eli as elisha you get a double
[52:00] portion of elijah's spirit and they
[52:02] thinking it's a man no no no no it's the
[52:04] holy ghost is that right
[52:07] giving you a double portion of his
[52:09] spirit
[52:10] and so we must understand when you get a
[52:13] a double portion of the holy spirit that
[52:15] means anybody know from
[52:18] one of the things that always excited me
[52:20] about real eggs
[52:22] is that sometimes you'll get a double
[52:24] yolk
[52:26] every time i see a double yolk i get
[52:28] excited
[52:29] don't ask me why it just makes me know
[52:32] that this this egg is more real than the
[52:34] other ones
[52:36] but when it comes to elijah
[52:39] the holy spirit comes down to give you a
[52:42] position
[52:43] now understand this
[52:46] elijah and elisha
[52:49] brother who talks about it
[52:51] you know
[52:52] and and he goes on to say now
[52:55] elisha
[52:56] was in training
[52:59] elijah
[53:03] and while all of the other prophets were
[53:06] doing their thing
[53:08] elisha
[53:10] stayed true to elijah
[53:14] elijah elisha
[53:16] could not get
[53:18] his position
[53:20] you see what i'm saying
[53:21] let me say it like this
[53:23] he could not get his position or come to
[53:26] recognize his position until elijah
[53:30] moved out of the way
[53:32] and the position that he liked
[53:35] shah
[53:36] received was appreciation that he like
[53:39] john
[53:40] once was in
[53:43] you see what i'm saying
[53:44] so
[53:45] that's why he said if you see me go away
[53:49] then the anointing the double portion
[53:52] will come down upon you
[53:55] right now if you understand this message
[53:59] before 1963 brother branham was
[54:01] preaching to everybody
[54:04] but when god opened the word when the
[54:06] seals were broken when the mighty angel
[54:08] came down when when when we talked about
[54:10] the pillar cloud and the pillar of fire
[54:12] his ministry was changing
[54:15] matter of fact he said things after the
[54:17] sears were open that he never said
[54:19] before
[54:21] and most of the things that he was
[54:23] saying was to the bride
[54:27] it was no longer to the public
[54:29] it was in a secret place
[54:32] that god had hidden his message in a
[54:34] secret place
[54:37] and therefore amen it only the bride of
[54:40] jesus christ will be able to look into
[54:43] the message in a spiritual way and read
[54:46] between the lines and understand who
[54:48] he's talking about
[54:50] he's not talking about elijah anymore
[54:52] he's talking about elisha
[54:55] and he's giving those that word of faith
[54:58] so elisha can put on the mantle
[55:03] right it just didn't happen elisha had
[55:07] to grow into it
[55:08] [Laughter]
[55:10] amen
[55:12] it just couldn't happen so god
[55:14] understood that this whole process of
[55:17] the rapture and becoming like god amen
[55:20] in the sense of character and nature was
[55:23] a process
[55:25] it didn't happen overnight
[55:27] and no matter how those people in when
[55:30] when the prophet left off the scene
[55:32] everybody said oh we got it we got it we
[55:34] got it but they failed to see it was
[55:36] just in seed form
[55:40] amen
[55:41] they didn't have it
[55:43] potentially they did
[55:45] but the reality of what we're looking at
[55:48] has not yet been displayed amen
[55:52] amen that's the truth
[55:55] and you and i must understand amen that
[55:58] this this spirit is
[56:00] eternal right
[56:03] and because you are baptized and you
[56:05] have the holy ghost it makes you eternal
[56:08] but you've got to learn
[56:12] and step into your position
[56:16] right
[56:17] and you must be worthy of it
[56:21] you know romans 4 20-25 says
[56:24] and talking about abraham he staggered
[56:28] not
[56:29] at the promises of god through unbelief
[56:33] we know sarah laughed
[56:35] she couldn't believe that she could
[56:36] produce a
[56:37] a child
[56:39] and understand everything that was done
[56:41] was
[56:42] supernatural
[56:44] god changed abraham and sarah back to
[56:46] young people
[56:48] they had kid children you know that's
[56:50] the truth
[56:51] because after sarah died uh
[56:53] abraham married another and had more
[56:56] children
[56:57] oh man come on
[56:59] so you and i must understand the process
[57:02] was
[57:03] was supernatural
[57:05] but there was also spiritual changes
[57:08] i mean excuse me natural changing all
[57:11] along god was changing the atoms
[57:15] in abraham's and sarah's body
[57:18] because they believed the promise
[57:21] right now we don't see it but what god
[57:23] is doing is changing the more you eat
[57:28] the more you eat the more he's changing
[57:31] you on the inside
[57:33] even though the world can't see it
[57:36] hallelujah the mystery still is in you
[57:40] hallelujah
[57:42] so what's happening that's why you can't
[57:45] lay away from the tapes you can't lay
[57:47] away from the books you can't lay away
[57:49] from your bible they all come together
[57:53] he's the alpha any omega
[57:56] hallelujah
[57:58] glory to god he was fully persuaded
[58:01] are y'all understanding this
[58:04] he was full abraham was fully
[58:06] persuaded that he that promised it
[58:10] was able to do it
[58:13] hallelujah
[58:15] and because he was fully see if listen
[58:17] you can't look at your conditions
[58:20] your natural faults and failures you
[58:23] were born of failure you came into this
[58:25] world failure hallelujah but god chose
[58:28] you
[58:30] to take a position that you never
[58:32] thought you would
[58:34] take what about odessa
[58:38] she never in her mind dreamed that one
[58:40] day she would be queen
[58:42] she was a no-name sister
[58:46] nobody knew her
[58:47] but god election did
[58:51] and god set the stage
[58:53] for her
[58:55] at such a time as this
[58:57] you see what i'm saying
[58:59] amen and here she was one day looking
[59:01] like a pauper
[59:03] and the next day she's in as a queen
[59:06] there was nothing she did do
[59:09] it was all god because as she was odessa
[59:13] god was changing her character
[59:17] hello
[59:19] and by the time she got it to to her
[59:21] pageant if i'd say it like that she was
[59:24] everything that the king a hesserua
[59:26] wanted
[59:29] who did that
[59:30] god
[59:32] hallelujah you see what i'm saying
[59:35] but what happened is after she came into
[59:39] her position it was beautiful wonderful
[59:43] but it wasn't all over
[59:45] god had to institute pressure
[59:50] you see what i'm saying god had to make
[59:52] her realize who she was
[59:55] you see what i'm saying see that's what
[59:57] was hidden in the book esther and when
[59:59] brother branham preached it he's trying
[1:00:01] to get god is trying to get us to see
[1:00:03] who we are
[1:00:04] and he's also telling us when the
[1:00:07] pressure come that's when we will awaken
[1:00:10] to our full position our full authority
[1:00:13] of who we are
[1:00:15] is already given to us we don't have to
[1:00:18] worry whether the king is going to give
[1:00:19] it to us esther has already written it
[1:00:22] she's already told us the king is going
[1:00:24] to give us half of the kingdom
[1:00:27] and listen jesus christ when he comes
[1:00:29] into you that's what he says i'm giving
[1:00:32] you half of the kingdom your joint airs
[1:00:34] with me
[1:00:37] everything i own you own everything i
[1:00:39] have you have
[1:00:41] right
[1:00:43] hallelujah
[1:00:45] see but it was not written for
[1:00:48] his sake alone
[1:00:50] god
[1:00:52] imputed to him righteousness
[1:00:55] the bible also said blessed is the man
[1:00:57] whom god will not impute sin
[1:01:00] the brother of them said that's the
[1:01:01] bride
[1:01:03] y'all understand me
[1:01:04] that god doesn't charge sin to you
[1:01:08] he's not concerned about your faults
[1:01:11] he's concerned about your mission
[1:01:14] what he's ordained you to do is what he
[1:01:16] is concerned about
[1:01:20] amen is that right well look how peter
[1:01:22] denied him three times
[1:01:26] you think that would upset god like how
[1:01:27] can i trust this guy with the keys
[1:01:30] no he was ordained
[1:01:33] he had a covenant that was unconditional
[1:01:36] and god took that unconditional covenant
[1:01:39] and used it
[1:01:41] to put it
[1:01:43] as a spokesman the preacher on the day
[1:01:46] of pentecost
[1:01:48] the same man who cursed and swore he
[1:01:50] didn't know jesus
[1:01:52] was the same man testifying i know him
[1:01:55] this is that when they ask what is all
[1:01:58] his commotion he said this is that that
[1:02:00] was spoken by the prophet joel in the
[1:02:02] last days i pour out my spirit this was
[1:02:06] peter the coward that ran
[1:02:08] stood boldly on the anointing of the
[1:02:10] holy ghost why why why because the god
[1:02:13] he once walked with no longer walked
[1:02:16] with him but walked in him
[1:02:20] that's what we want
[1:02:22] we want god to walk in us
[1:02:26] hallelujah
[1:02:27] oh glory to god is that right
[1:02:30] but for all of us to whom it shall not
[1:02:32] be imputed if we believe on him that
[1:02:35] means righteousness
[1:02:37] if we believe on him that raised up
[1:02:40] jesus our lord from the dead who was
[1:02:42] once delivered what for our offenses and
[1:02:46] was raised again for our justification
[1:02:49] that's your bible
[1:02:50] hallelujah that he became sin
[1:02:54] that we might become the righteousness
[1:02:55] of god amen now when you believe that
[1:02:59] something happens
[1:03:01] hallelujah
[1:03:03] amen
[1:03:04] see jesus christ is the only he is the
[1:03:06] great shepherd i want to say this
[1:03:08] because the lord knows the path that he
[1:03:11] leads you you think god is confused
[1:03:14] he is not
[1:03:16] when you go through your suffering when
[1:03:18] you go through your trials when you go
[1:03:20] through your temptations when you go
[1:03:21] through your falls do you think god
[1:03:24] grabs his mouth said oh no i didn't know
[1:03:26] it was gonna happen
[1:03:28] no he knew it
[1:03:31] you may not like this but he ordained it
[1:03:35] god orders the steps of the righteous
[1:03:40] hallelujah he orders the steps of the
[1:03:43] righteous
[1:03:45] because i'm going to tell you something
[1:03:46] it ain't god that's being put to the
[1:03:48] test it's you
[1:03:52] right
[1:03:53] when peter then was on the boat in a
[1:03:55] storm cape and they got all afraid and
[1:03:58] began to scream and holler you know
[1:04:00] oh god cares doubt not that we perish
[1:04:03] that that test was not for them
[1:04:06] for him jesus the test was for the
[1:04:09] disciples he told them things to do and
[1:04:12] they failed
[1:04:14] they had they had power over sickness
[1:04:17] power over everything they were sons and
[1:04:19] daughters of god
[1:04:21] had not even gone to pentecost yet
[1:04:25] hallelujah but god had given them that
[1:04:28] authority and he put them to the test
[1:04:31] and they failed
[1:04:33] and that's exactly what happens to us
[1:04:35] sometimes
[1:04:37] god put us to the test and we fail we
[1:04:40] look where are you jesus and the lord is
[1:04:42] saying well i never left you
[1:04:45] but this is your battle
[1:04:47] amen you speak the word
[1:04:51] come on somebody you speak it if you
[1:04:54] really believe god is in you you speak
[1:04:56] the word amen
[1:04:58] oh you say well brother i don't feel the
[1:05:00] anointing
[1:05:02] what you mean you don't feel it
[1:05:04] if jesus christ is in you you don't have
[1:05:06] to feel it
[1:05:09] right
[1:05:10] i got a liver and i got a kidney and i
[1:05:13] don't feel it
[1:05:14] but it's in there
[1:05:16] and i know if something goes wrong it's
[1:05:17] going to let me know it's in there
[1:05:20] you see what i'm saying feel this is not
[1:05:22] this this is faith
[1:05:25] amen
[1:05:26] it might sound crazy
[1:05:29] but i'm gonna tell you it's just like
[1:05:30] when i was down there at the at the in
[1:05:33] the meeting i lost my little key i had a
[1:05:35] little key you know they give you rental
[1:05:38] and i lost it i didn't know where it was
[1:05:41] i looked at my bible to zip apart
[1:05:43] i had another brother look in it he
[1:05:45] didn't see it either that third time i
[1:05:48] zipped i said oh lord you know where the
[1:05:50] key is i zipped it and it dropped out
[1:05:52] like almost in my hand
[1:05:54] somebody said well yeah
[1:05:56] we all forget sometimes it wasn't no
[1:05:58] forgetful this
[1:06:00] to me that was supernatural
[1:06:01] you're not taking away my blessing
[1:06:05] no
[1:06:06] you can reason those things all you want
[1:06:08] to
[1:06:09] we we did the whole yard everywhere i
[1:06:11] went we flashed it we had cars moving we
[1:06:14] had our phones like we're hunting
[1:06:16] treasure hunting and we were
[1:06:18] but when god listen i don't know what
[1:06:20] kind of accident he was protecting me
[1:06:22] from
[1:06:24] god doesn't do things in vain
[1:06:27] amen
[1:06:28] i trust him
[1:06:30] mm-hmm he is our shepherd the lord jesus
[1:06:34] christ right amen that is what the holy
[1:06:38] spirit he said well how the lord gonna
[1:06:40] if you have the holy spirit he's going
[1:06:42] to lead you
[1:06:44] the bible said he will lead you and
[1:06:45] guide you into all truth
[1:06:48] what you're afraid about
[1:06:50] you don't have to be afraid
[1:06:52] he promised to lead at you and guide you
[1:06:55] into all truth
[1:06:58] the thing about it is we as sheep
[1:07:00] sometimes try to get ahead of the
[1:07:02] shepherd
[1:07:03] and you know that's abnormal
[1:07:07] man and woman
[1:07:08] god promised in this last days that
[1:07:10] he'll pour out his spirit upon all flesh
[1:07:13] he promised
[1:07:14] he has sinned the baptism of the holy
[1:07:16] ghost and he called up and he'll call a
[1:07:19] bride without spot or wrinkle he
[1:07:22] promised to do it he'll do it
[1:07:24] don't listen to these harlem shepherds
[1:07:27] they'll lead you astray
[1:07:29] the holy spirit is the shepherd to feed
[1:07:32] you sheep food from this word
[1:07:35] is always come by the shepherd he is our
[1:07:39] shepherd he said listen to him you are
[1:07:42] the sheep of his foe
[1:07:44] if you are you'll hear his voice
[1:07:48] not what somebody else say and let me
[1:07:50] say it like this when he said somebody
[1:07:51] else said we always look at somebody
[1:07:53] else like some other person why do you
[1:07:55] listen to the devil he's somebody else
[1:08:01] don't even listen to what somebody else
[1:08:03] says
[1:08:04] including the devil
[1:08:15] you know it's amazing because i had
[1:08:16] somebody compliment me today and i'm
[1:08:18] like
[1:08:19] i don't know what you seeing
[1:08:24] but you know why why do we do that
[1:08:27] why do we do that
[1:08:29] we almost spoil the compliment when
[1:08:31] people give it to you
[1:08:35] you know in reality i'm glad the
[1:08:37] compliment came
[1:08:40] but but the whole point is it's like
[1:08:42] this
[1:08:42] we do it to ourselves god said you're
[1:08:45] holy
[1:08:46] god said you're sanctified and you know
[1:08:49] what we'll say i'm a hypocrite
[1:08:53] god said i've justified you as though
[1:08:55] you've never sinned in the first place
[1:08:59] and we'll just throw out that whole list
[1:09:00] of sins we've done
[1:09:02] did yesterday today and then we'll go
[1:09:05] back in history under the blood pull it
[1:09:07] out
[1:09:11] god ain't pleased with that
[1:09:15] if he has taken you
[1:09:17] and given you his righteousness walk
[1:09:20] like you got it
[1:09:22] believe that you have it
[1:09:24] because his righteousness is your coat
[1:09:28] that he's given to you
[1:09:32] not what somebody else said you hear
[1:09:33] what he says a stranger's voice you you
[1:09:37] know not to follow right
[1:09:39] we don't do it
[1:09:40] right let's go to malachi 3.
[1:09:46] you love the lord
[1:09:48] you know a lot of people don't
[1:09:49] understand the importance and i i mean i
[1:09:52] i thank god i hate preaching
[1:09:54] even on tithing but
[1:09:57] here it is a little bit
[1:09:59] because people don't understand the the
[1:10:01] depths of that and how when you don't
[1:10:03] pay tithing god's shepherd you've broken
[1:10:05] your fellowship with him god don't
[1:10:07] fellowship with thieves
[1:10:09] and don't do it and you feel like
[1:10:11] something's missing yeah god's tithing
[1:10:15] you forgot somehow to put it in where it
[1:10:17] should be
[1:10:19] right what people don't understand well
[1:10:20] i don't have to give them
[1:10:22] you you need a revelation
[1:10:25] you understand you need a revelation
[1:10:28] god has given you life health and
[1:10:29] strength
[1:10:30] all these things he given to you and you
[1:10:32] can't give him tim you know you sound
[1:10:35] like nabal
[1:10:40] you know what we need to understand you
[1:10:42] want god to bless you and the whole time
[1:10:44] he's trying to bless you you stealing
[1:10:46] from yourself
[1:10:50] it affects everybody is that right even
[1:10:53] when a can took the little wedges and
[1:10:55] comments guess what people got his whole
[1:10:58] family was destroyed
[1:11:01] i think was 3 000 got killed or 300 i
[1:11:03] forgot how many was but it was a lot of
[1:11:05] people got killed because one man in his
[1:11:07] selfish ways
[1:11:10] we our body
[1:11:12] right you wouldn't want somebody to take
[1:11:14] a ham and hit your finger
[1:11:17] because you are told
[1:11:19] i guarantee you
[1:11:21] let somebody take a hammer and hit your
[1:11:23] finger your toe gonna feel it
[1:11:25] everything else going to feel it
[1:11:28] right malachi 3 6 and 8
[1:11:31] for i am the lord i change not
[1:11:34] let me tell you something y'all think
[1:11:36] y'all gonna make a rapture and don't
[1:11:37] know how to play tithing you are
[1:11:39] deceived
[1:11:43] how are you going to trust god to take
[1:11:45] you in the rapture and you can't trust
[1:11:47] god to supply your knees
[1:11:52] i am the lord i change not
[1:11:55] therefore you sons of jacob are not
[1:11:57] consumed
[1:12:01] did you hear what i'm saying
[1:12:03] you sons of jacob you know jacob was a
[1:12:06] sister
[1:12:07] but jacob was born again it
[1:12:09] was changed to israel
[1:12:12] right
[1:12:14] even from the days of your fathers you
[1:12:16] have gone away from my ordinances
[1:12:19] and have not kept them
[1:12:21] return unto me
[1:12:24] and i will return unto you listen what
[1:12:26] he says is a problem said the lord of
[1:12:29] hosts but you say
[1:12:31] wherein shall we return
[1:12:34] well a man robbed god
[1:12:38] yet have you robbed me
[1:12:40] but you say within you have rob you
[1:12:43] you we with you
[1:12:45] you say with wherein have we robbed thee
[1:12:49] and he says in tithes
[1:12:51] and offerings
[1:12:53] and some people have paid their tithes
[1:12:54] and won't pay their offering you still a
[1:12:56] thief
[1:13:01] hallelujah
[1:13:03] people don't understand that
[1:13:05] by every word
[1:13:08] god expects us
[1:13:09] to live by every word
[1:13:11] man does not live by bread alone
[1:13:14] yeah
[1:13:15] but by every word
[1:13:17] i think i i i hope brother rich don't
[1:13:20] mind me saying this but i remember him
[1:13:22] telling me he said isn't it unfair it's
[1:13:25] like a man hiring somebody to run his
[1:13:27] company
[1:13:29] and he says all you got to do is run my
[1:13:31] company
[1:13:33] and and and when it's time to you know
[1:13:35] to pay me
[1:13:36] you give me 10 percent and you keep the
[1:13:39] 90.
[1:13:41] that's what he does
[1:13:44] tithing is 10
[1:13:46] you keep the 90.
[1:13:47] can you imagine you have no idea the
[1:13:50] many of people who wish they could work
[1:13:52] and you know how that is
[1:13:54] i remember a brother telling me a pastor
[1:13:56] telling me that there was a brother in
[1:13:57] his church who was barely making it one
[1:14:00] time and his pain is tithing so
[1:14:01] faithfully then when he got wealthy he
[1:14:04] slacked off
[1:14:05] and he came to prayer to ask the
[1:14:08] pastor to pray for him and so the pastor
[1:14:10] said lord take his money away so he can
[1:14:14] pay pay
[1:14:16] stop paying the stock
[1:14:20] [Laughter]
[1:14:23] yeah that's the way it is well when i
[1:14:25] got rich it's hard for me to pay your
[1:14:27] tither real lord
[1:14:31] take it away so he can get back what was
[1:14:33] most most important the job of what he
[1:14:35] was supposed to do
[1:14:38] you see what i'm saying
[1:14:40] we don't do god right we look at human
[1:14:43] flesh and say oh we i'm that this you
[1:14:45] know brother brooks is brother brooks
[1:14:49] you have no idea when what god has to do
[1:14:51] sometime he dips into somebody else's
[1:14:54] funds just to give me something
[1:14:56] my wife will tell you
[1:14:58] i've had long distance help
[1:15:01] without asking
[1:15:03] yeah
[1:15:05] listen
[1:15:06] you say why is it that the message don't
[1:15:09] go out in these
[1:15:11] great big places
[1:15:13] these big crusades like amongst the
[1:15:16] denominations
[1:15:18] it's not their food
[1:15:21] it's not the church
[1:15:23] so-called food
[1:15:25] it's the bride's food
[1:15:27] it's
[1:15:28] spiritual food in season oh i want you
[1:15:31] to hear that that's why the message
[1:15:33] seemed to break forth
[1:15:36] sometimes
[1:15:37] in a season
[1:15:38] you've read it you've seen it but it
[1:15:41] but then there's a season where certain
[1:15:44] quotes and certain things he said began
[1:15:46] to blossom you say hi in the world i've
[1:15:48] read this i've listened to it so many
[1:15:50] times and i've never seen it because it
[1:15:52] wasn't for the season for it
[1:15:55] you see
[1:15:56] remember what what moses did
[1:15:58] the people cried for meat it wasn't the
[1:16:01] season for meat
[1:16:03] and they cried for me because they were
[1:16:04] tired of the manner
[1:16:07] and what happened they got sick
[1:16:10] the food was hard on them the meat was
[1:16:12] hard to you know me
[1:16:15] they they they took in too much
[1:16:18] and that's what's happening with the
[1:16:19] message
[1:16:20] they took in too much now everything
[1:16:23] they went down is coming up
[1:16:28] may god help us
[1:16:30] you know that's why preachers got to be
[1:16:32] careful you got to be careful that
[1:16:33] you're preaching the message that god
[1:16:35] wants you to preach at that time you
[1:16:38] can't say well lord i'm deep and i got
[1:16:39] it you'll kill people with it
[1:16:42] look at the revelations that once
[1:16:45] thought people once thought was not
[1:16:47] revelation because it was
[1:16:51] right now the thing that wasn't is why
[1:16:54] because the season things are being
[1:16:57] opened now that we can see
[1:16:59] you know the the time and and everything
[1:17:01] else is now caught up
[1:17:03] we can look back and see that the cloud
[1:17:06] in itself wasn't just some kind of
[1:17:07] demonstration it was god vindicating
[1:17:10] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:17:13] and the day and forever he was
[1:17:15] vindicating he's the he's the same god
[1:17:18] amen that jehovah of the old testament
[1:17:21] is jesus christ of the new that's what
[1:17:23] he was doing and he was always also
[1:17:25] vindicating to to rebecca that he was
[1:17:28] the isaac
[1:17:32] let's come for her
[1:17:38] hallelujah it's spiritual food in season
[1:17:42] it will make them sick at their stomach
[1:17:45] talk about the dominations oh because
[1:17:47] when you start getting on your gods and
[1:17:49] all that people can't handle that when
[1:17:52] you get on serpentine they're like you
[1:17:54] know he's crazy the imagination goes
[1:17:56] wild he said it's too rich for them
[1:18:00] see
[1:18:01] you can't do it
[1:18:02] but for the children
[1:18:04] it's bread
[1:18:06] it's life
[1:18:08] it's jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:18:10] today and forever see that's what i'm
[1:18:12] talking about when elisha fully takes
[1:18:16] her position
[1:18:17] and i know sometimes some people may
[1:18:20] well she's already there all i'm gonna
[1:18:21] say i'm gonna say it like he told me to
[1:18:23] say it when she fully takes her position
[1:18:26] we're going to see something
[1:18:29] it won't it's going to be more than
[1:18:31] words
[1:18:34] hallelujah you see esther she had to
[1:18:36] have pressure
[1:18:39] the pressure has to come the squeeze has
[1:18:42] to come now i'm not saying oh we're
[1:18:44] going to wait no in the process of all
[1:18:46] of this you must continue to eat and eat
[1:18:49] and eat that word eat it eat it don't
[1:18:52] get tired of reading your bible don't
[1:18:53] get tired or listen to the taste don't
[1:18:55] get tired of praying you got to keep
[1:18:57] going on with this thing even when you
[1:19:00] don't see changes god is making changes
[1:19:05] who
[1:19:06] look at what a little yeast would do to
[1:19:08] bread
[1:19:09] just a little bit
[1:19:11] it'll blow that whole thing up
[1:19:14] think about the word
[1:19:17] you put the word in you don't worry
[1:19:19] about it
[1:19:21] it's going to do just what it says
[1:19:23] you're going to do
[1:19:24] look at what the word of god says in
[1:19:26] isaiah 55 9.
[1:19:28] we read there to the 13th verse
[1:19:31] for as they have i love this scripture i
[1:19:33] have a i see such a powerful revelation
[1:19:35] in it
[1:19:36] for as the heavens are higher than the
[1:19:38] earth
[1:19:40] so are my ways higher than your ways
[1:19:43] and my thoughts
[1:19:45] than your thoughts
[1:19:47] for as the rain coming down listen
[1:19:49] listen god uses such simplicity to show
[1:19:52] us the resurrection
[1:19:54] he shows us here reproduction
[1:19:57] he shows us resurrection
[1:20:00] in this little these two passages of
[1:20:01] scripture he says for as a rain cometh
[1:20:04] down
[1:20:05] and the snow from heaven
[1:20:07] and return not thither but watereth the
[1:20:10] earth
[1:20:11] and maketh it bring forth
[1:20:14] and bud
[1:20:16] that it may give seed to the sower
[1:20:20] and bread to the eater
[1:20:22] he just described what we call the
[1:20:23] circle of life
[1:20:25] so shall my word be
[1:20:28] that goeth forth out of my mouth
[1:20:31] it shall not return to me void
[1:20:35] the whole thing everything i saw my word
[1:20:38] doing everything i spoke will come to
[1:20:41] pass
[1:20:43] you let's just say it like this a
[1:20:45] hundred years earlier let's say 200
[1:20:48] years if you could describe
[1:20:51] the world today
[1:20:52] the way it is
[1:20:54] people would lock you up as being crazy
[1:20:58] you telling them that there's a cause
[1:21:00] that don't that doesn't need horses
[1:21:03] and stairs that you don't have to step
[1:21:05] on your step you just step on it you
[1:21:07] don't have to step up on it it'll ride
[1:21:09] you up or elevator you know that
[1:21:13] they think you're crazy
[1:21:16] really crazy
[1:21:18] and you know you just tell them about
[1:21:20] airplanes and all of these things that
[1:21:23] science had produced they would think
[1:21:24] you crazy
[1:21:26] but listen god said it
[1:21:30] god said in the last days knowledge will
[1:21:32] increase
[1:21:33] men will run to and fro
[1:21:35] he talks about it amen how chariots
[1:21:38] would be jostling going down the highway
[1:21:40] and everything coming into each other
[1:21:42] they didn't know how to describe it he
[1:21:44] called it a torch because you know at
[1:21:45] night you have your flash you have your
[1:21:47] lights on
[1:21:48] they didn't they didn't understand it
[1:21:50] horses carriages all that's in there
[1:21:54] you know you talk about revelation when
[1:21:57] when when when john saw the the the the
[1:22:00] the the uh beast with a tail or sting
[1:22:03] and you know and and shoot fire and had
[1:22:06] the face of a man he was looking at a
[1:22:08] helicopter
[1:22:09] he didn't know how to do it but he saw
[1:22:10] him in war
[1:22:12] shooting bombs
[1:22:13] dropping bombs he looked in there and he
[1:22:16] was the thing with the face of a man
[1:22:17] because the man is driving and flying it
[1:22:20] but that was his best bet
[1:22:22] he didn't know how to he took it and you
[1:22:24] know it was god purpose
[1:22:26] to hide it
[1:22:28] and you you you look at all of these
[1:22:30] movies and they got all kind of animals
[1:22:32] creatures coming out of space and
[1:22:34] everything
[1:22:36] i thought when god said that in this day
[1:22:38] and time we'll be seeing hideous sites i
[1:22:40] didn't know he was talking about people
[1:22:47] hideous
[1:22:49] people growing horns and you know just
[1:22:51] mutilating their faces and you know
[1:22:54] dying their hair all colors and
[1:22:56] you know what i'm saying don't even look
[1:22:58] human
[1:22:59] i'm not picking i'm just saying the
[1:23:02] bible said it was going to be and it is
[1:23:10] just like i preached uh down there you
[1:23:12] know there was at one time science used
[1:23:14] to stand for
[1:23:15] what was biology and science still for
[1:23:18] what was right night psychology is now
[1:23:20] saying hold it
[1:23:23] what you say doesn't matter anymore
[1:23:25] psychology is now the ruler
[1:23:29] it's true
[1:23:32] like i said you know i went to walmart
[1:23:34] and i'm not picking on nobody we've come
[1:23:36] from all walks of life but god has saved
[1:23:38] us
[1:23:39] amen but what i'm trying to say i was at
[1:23:42] walmart and and they said that the lady
[1:23:44] uh i was having trouble with the cash
[1:23:46] register and this woman says okay my my
[1:23:49] um
[1:23:51] manager she's going to come and help you
[1:23:53] out well when she came it wasn't she was
[1:23:56] he
[1:23:57] so my question is
[1:23:59] where will you stand
[1:24:01] when they say you got to form conform to
[1:24:03] what you t we telling you are you fired
[1:24:07] you got to call a man or she
[1:24:10] are you fired
[1:24:12] you gotta you got i don't listen
[1:24:16] change whatever you want to change
[1:24:20] you're going to still be what god said
[1:24:21] you are
[1:24:26] ain't no changing in that
[1:24:29] hate i saw something i was i don't even
[1:24:31] look at youtube i was looking at
[1:24:32] something on the news i forgot which
[1:24:34] part of the news where this lady this
[1:24:36] man who was once a lady he said they are
[1:24:38] not telling he said science is lying to
[1:24:41] the people
[1:24:42] he says since i trans he said i've been
[1:24:45] miserable
[1:24:46] fighting all kinds of diseases all kind
[1:24:48] of medication and everything i got to do
[1:24:50] to try to keep me myself looking like
[1:24:52] this and and she he said i don't know
[1:24:55] which one it was now but anyway
[1:25:01] and i'm not trying to be funny oh she
[1:25:03] said no matter what i have concluded i
[1:25:07] will never be a man
[1:25:11] and now this lady a man is trying to
[1:25:14] inform other people
[1:25:17] that science is lying to them
[1:25:22] i'm sorry i got on that but my point is
[1:25:24] we're in this day
[1:25:26] and don't tell me now because what what
[1:25:29] satan is the prince of air he's the
[1:25:32] airway
[1:25:33] he facebook and all these things that
[1:25:35] you're looking at all these things are
[1:25:37] designed to change your mind against the
[1:25:39] word
[1:25:40] amen
[1:25:42] you want to be yeah i don't want to be
[1:25:43] liberal we keep looking at what you're
[1:25:45] looking at because you're literally
[1:25:47] dealing with spirits
[1:25:49] that's going to make you compromise at
[1:25:50] the end
[1:25:59] you tell me i don't care what's been put
[1:26:01] on you i don't care what you come
[1:26:03] through i don't care you know
[1:26:06] you know i know
[1:26:08] that my god
[1:26:10] and your god
[1:26:12] can do do a seedling
[1:26:15] above
[1:26:16] whatsoever you ask
[1:26:18] or think
[1:26:20] there is not a scar that satan put on
[1:26:23] you that god can't remove
[1:26:27] i remember brother brown said he just
[1:26:28] prayed for this guy he had a cancer on
[1:26:30] his ear and and said when god healed him
[1:26:33] there was not even a scar
[1:26:36] y'all understand me if god can do it in
[1:26:39] the natural he can do it in the
[1:26:40] spiritual
[1:26:41] we got to trust him that's what i'm
[1:26:43] saying god did not call you to this
[1:26:46] message to send you to hell he did not
[1:26:50] but we've got to allow him to do his
[1:26:52] work
[1:26:55] do you see what i'm saying
[1:26:57] he went on and says listen just as
[1:26:59] nature in itself caused this thing to
[1:27:01] grow to blood and blossom he said my
[1:27:03] word will do it
[1:27:05] folks you got the seed of god in you
[1:27:07] do you have him you can't you there you
[1:27:10] couldn't even have the compassion for
[1:27:11] this word you couldn't have a love for

[1:32:15] earthquake
[1:32:16] shifted the earth didn't it it literally

[1:32:20] saying it moved the earth closer to the
[1:32:23] sun and it sped up
[1:32:26] that's why the days are shortened
[1:32:28] and god said except like short in the
[1:32:30] days no no flesh would be saved that's
[1:32:32] how he interpreted it
[1:32:35] that's how he interpreted now that you
[1:32:37] y'all know the days are faster
[1:32:40] what we used to be able to do in 24
[1:32:42] hours or 12 hours is amazing nowadays

[1:33:49] the circumcision made without hand in
[1:33:51] putting off the body of sin of the flesh
[1:33:54] by the circumcision of christ what is he
[1:33:56] saying you god didn't cut it off
[1:33:59] you got the holy ghost you worried about
[1:34:01] your flesh your flesh has been condemned
[1:34:04] god has cut it off god is not looking at
[1:34:07] this flesh he's looking at the inner man

[1:34:17] him in baptism
[1:34:19] wherein also you are risen with him
[1:34:22] through the faith of the operation of
[1:34:24] god who have raised him from the dead
[1:34:27] and you being dead in your sins
[1:34:30] and the uncircumcision of flesh hath he
[1:34:33] quickened together with him

[1:34:45] that it's over
[1:34:47] it really is finished
[1:34:49] we're just going through the motions
[1:34:53] but if you read revelations
[1:34:55] revelation tells us what has already
[1:34:57] happened in the other dimension
[1:35:00] [Laughter]
[1:35:02] we're just catching up
[1:35:07] when mighty angel came down oh god

[1:36:12] right
[1:36:14] listen
[1:36:16] he says listen are you coming you coming
[1:36:18] with this morning to confess that see
[1:36:21] that sin that i preached about this
[1:36:23] morning the sins of the world has been
[1:36:25] condemned and killed
[1:36:27] and you know more you are you're no more
[1:36:30] a servant to that thing
[1:36:32] but but is dead
[1:36:34] and you are coming to be buried in the
[1:36:36] name of him who died for you that's what
[1:36:38] people say well i you got to be baptized
[1:36:40] in the name of the father son in the
[1:36:42] name in the name of jesus christ because
[1:36:44] people say well how do you baptize i
[1:36:46] said i baptized according to matthew 28
[1:36:48] 18 and in acts 238
[1:36:51] i said because matthew 28 tells us what
[1:36:53] to do
[1:36:55] and and acts 2 38 tells us how to do it
[1:36:59] you know and i don't understand why
[1:37:01] people have such a hard time with jesus
[1:37:03] because when you get sick you call on
[1:37:05] jesus
[1:37:06] when you're almost in a wreck you call
[1:37:08] on jesus you know when you're driving
[1:37:09] down the road and you're almost getting
[1:37:11] in an accident you said you don't say
[1:37:12] father son and holy ghost
[1:37:17] you say
[1:37:18] jesus i don't understand it
[1:37:22] people get healed
[1:37:26] i don't care
[1:37:28] you know what people don't understand
[1:37:29] because ain't no power now
[1:37:31] those are titles but the name no name
[1:37:35] and whatsoever you do in word or deed do
[1:37:37] it all in the name
[1:37:40] hallelujah
[1:37:43] i remember a question years ago they had
[1:37:45] on the radio
[1:37:46] and the lady asked the question when we
[1:37:48] get to heaven which one we gonna see
[1:37:50] first
[1:37:52] father the son or the holy spirit
[1:37:55] you know what the announcer did he
[1:37:57] changed his such
[1:38:01] he changed if he asked me i told him the
[1:38:04] bible said there was only one set on the
[1:38:05] throne
[1:38:06] and that was jesus christ that's what
[1:38:08] you're going to see
[1:38:11] it was the bible he could have answered
[1:38:13] it
[1:38:14] and avoid the trinitarian thing
[1:38:17] they don't even know where it came from
[1:38:19] my goodness
[1:38:20] write out bell worship in the form of
[1:38:22] christianity
[1:38:26] and you are the coming to bear it in the
[1:38:27] name of him who died for you and killed
[1:38:30] sin for you and rose
[1:38:32] for your justification and you are
[1:38:35] complete in him
[1:38:37] not in no church not in branham
[1:38:39] tabernacle not in association but you
[1:38:42] are complete and safe in jesus christ
[1:38:49] give me a few more minutes
[1:38:51] it's a it's a change that change is
[1:38:53] approaching
[1:38:55] you know at some point in time
[1:38:58] abraham and sarah recognized their
[1:39:00] change
[1:39:03] and at some point in time if you listen
[1:39:05] to the messages how the prophet god
[1:39:06] describes this process
[1:39:09] now he was working with the natural but
[1:39:11] i'm gonna work with the spiritual
[1:39:12] because somewhere in your life you gotta
[1:39:15] understand there's a process of changing
[1:39:16] going on you in you you're not the way
[1:39:19] you used to be
[1:39:20] and you could see these changes
[1:39:22] constantly happen things that you even
[1:39:24] never thought uh you would separate from
[1:39:27] me but you're separating from them
[1:39:29] because you want to be a better
[1:39:30] christian
[1:39:31] see it's not you but it's god in you
[1:39:35] and and friends that used to really
[1:39:37] excite you about being friends no longer
[1:39:39] excites you because they don't believe
[1:39:41] the message or see it like you see it
[1:39:44] right and you're tired of all of the
[1:39:46] arguing over quotes and arguing about
[1:39:48] this doctrine and that doctrine because
[1:39:50] all you're interested is change
[1:39:52] i just want him to change me
[1:39:55] i don't care about all of this other
[1:39:57] stuff i know he's real just change me
[1:39:59] lord
[1:40:00] because no man can add one cupid to a
[1:40:02] statue and i realize i don't care how
[1:40:04] much you argue you know when you see
[1:40:07] ministers and brethren arguing through
[1:40:09] quotes and i'm not talking about sitting
[1:40:11] down and having a sensible conversation
[1:40:13] that's not what i'm talking about but
[1:40:14] striving with each other the holy spirit
[1:40:16] is not in that
[1:40:18] he said but one day we will be able to
[1:40:20] see him face to face
[1:40:22] that that is for this age
[1:40:26] he is coming at the end of this age
[1:40:30] partially realization will be made
[1:40:33] perfect
[1:40:34] realization complete
[1:40:37] realization hallelujah
[1:40:39] we have been looking through a glass
[1:40:41] darkly but soon it will be face to face
[1:40:46] we have been going from glory to glory
[1:40:49] but soon it will be right in the glory
[1:40:52] and in his glory will shine
[1:40:55] we shall be like him
[1:40:57] wondrously like him
[1:40:59] jesus our savior divine
[1:41:02] isn't that wonderful
[1:41:04] we are complete in him that is true
[1:41:07] he will not lie to us about that but one
[1:41:10] day we will be changed in the atoms
[1:41:14] we will put on immortality we will be
[1:41:18] all swallowed up in life
[1:41:20] then we will realize realization
[1:41:25] i like that
[1:41:27] ooh
[1:41:32] let me skip because i i want to get to
[1:41:34] something
[1:41:39] hebrews 13 20-21
[1:41:42] it says thou the god of peace
[1:41:44] that brought again from the dead our
[1:41:46] lord jesus christ
[1:41:48] that great shepherd of the sheep
[1:41:51] through the blood of the everlasting
[1:41:53] covenant
[1:41:54] make you perfect
[1:41:57] in every good work
[1:41:59] how
[1:42:00] i don't know how he's doing it
[1:42:02] but the bible said make you perfect
[1:42:05] in every good work
[1:42:07] to do his will
[1:42:10] working in you
[1:42:12] that which is well pleasing in his sight
[1:42:15] through jesus christ
[1:42:17] to whom
[1:42:18] be glory forever and ever amen
[1:42:23] the prophet god said
[1:42:26] there is power and glory
[1:42:29] and blessings upon you
[1:42:31] and satan is defeated
[1:42:35] in the presence of christ see that's
[1:42:37] what we can't afford i'm almost done we
[1:42:40] cannot afford to let the church dry up
[1:42:43] we need the holy spirit moving
[1:42:46] and the only way that we can you got to
[1:42:48] come an expectation
[1:42:50] i don't care if 99 of the people are not
[1:42:53] responding we need one match to set a
[1:42:56] fire
[1:42:57] all we need is one person to get on fire
[1:42:59] and if that fire is real it'll light the
[1:43:02] other ones
[1:43:04] hallelujah
[1:43:06] hallelujah
[1:43:08] he put see satan is defeated
[1:43:11] he knows even satan knows
[1:43:15] he's he's he's on the earth he's going
[1:43:18] like a royal lion it isn't long till he
[1:43:22] he's finished he knows his time he's
[1:43:25] going like a roaring lion but remember
[1:43:28] the prince of peace stands by
[1:43:31] let me tell y'all something we have an
[1:43:32] unseen force working on our part
[1:43:35] you know elijah i mean elijah says lord
[1:43:38] open gahey's eyes
[1:43:40] right get hazel was all so afraid and
[1:43:43] upset when the syrians was all around
[1:43:45] him and everything else and you know
[1:43:47] elijah said what was what was that to me
[1:43:50] pretty much you said it you know he said
[1:43:51] you know there are more of us than them
[1:43:54] lord open this man's eye
[1:43:56] and when he saw
[1:43:58] when god opened his eyes and he saw that
[1:44:00] through that dimension he saw chariots
[1:44:03] of fire
[1:44:05] ready for battle
[1:44:06] see you and i we're never alone
[1:44:09] it's we only think that we're alone is
[1:44:12] when when our eyes are closed
[1:44:14] but when you're spiritual
[1:44:16] you know
[1:44:18] it may feel like i'm alone but i'm never
[1:44:21] alone
[1:44:23] right
[1:44:24] that's it
[1:44:25] see
[1:44:26] but remember the prince of peace stands
[1:44:28] by
[1:44:29] the great divine one the architect of my
[1:44:32] being the architect who built me what i
[1:44:35] am who built you what you are is here so
[1:44:38] what i'm saying is if you might look
[1:44:41] odds seem odd to everybody else but it's
[1:44:43] always been the odd stone that made
[1:44:45] everything fit together
[1:44:49] jesus christ was the odd stone
[1:44:52] they threw it away they didn't want it
[1:44:54] but the bride wants the odd stone
[1:44:58] he's the one that fits everything
[1:44:59] together and maybe you just kind of
[1:45:01] awkward a little different than
[1:45:03] everybody else but that doesn't mean
[1:45:04] that you you're not usable god uses the
[1:45:07] odd stone to bring things fit everything
[1:45:09] together
[1:45:11] how many times you've done puzzles and
[1:45:12] you find a piece of puzzle and you think
[1:45:14] where in the world this go
[1:45:17] and you find out that without it the
[1:45:19] puzzle is not complete
[1:45:21] that's just the way it works
[1:45:23] we needed thomas
[1:45:26] we needed peter
[1:45:28] right we needed matthew god used all
[1:45:30] those different variations of stones
[1:45:34] and he used it and built a foundation
[1:45:37] that the whole church is built upon
[1:45:40] it's built upon jesus christ
[1:45:43] but god used those men as the foundation
[1:45:47] you love the lord
[1:45:49] i'm closing
[1:45:54] i want to say the bible says to us
[1:45:59] peter he said
[1:46:01] upon this rock
[1:46:02] i build my church
[1:46:05] and the gates of hell
[1:46:06] shall not prevail against it
[1:46:10] i would encourage you tonight
[1:46:14] whenever you get time and i know you
[1:46:16] probably listened to the tape before

[1:46:36] it
[1:46:37] it'll show you we're not far
[1:46:40] we need everything that's happening in
[1:46:43] this world right now we need it
[1:46:46] because most of the christians
[1:46:49] we become dolatory we become lazy
[1:46:53] and god is about ready to put it to us
[1:46:56] wake us up to the reality of who we are
[1:46:59] we need that
[1:47:01] we need that you know it's like the
[1:47:04] disciples they were so confident
[1:47:06] in themselves pretty much because they
[1:47:09] had jesus
[1:47:10] but when the world took jesus away and
[1:47:13] crucified him
[1:47:14] they realized they weren't nothing
[1:47:18] without him
[1:47:20] and so you found those ones after the
[1:47:22] crucifixion they went looking for him
[1:47:26] let me say it like this he's here
[1:47:28] but you got to go looking for him
[1:47:31] look him looking for him in his word
[1:47:34] and he'll reveal himself to you
[1:47:36] right
[1:47:37] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:47:39] forever he's a god that changes not

[1:47:48] your grace and we thank you for your
