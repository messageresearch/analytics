know the word of god has have preeminence so we're just gonna go into the word of god are you glad tonight brother adam said he saw the bride marching to the tune of the word onward christian soldier marching as to war i think that key of c was the right one i changed it so i paid the price anything god is good to us anyway i'm glad we can do that and not worry about whatever anybody says right god is so good to us and i i appreciate him more than any anybody could ever know we had wonderful services there in iowa city the anointing was amazing and even then and even as it is now i feel so unworthy to be standing behind this podium preaching the word of god i'm a man that has to acknowledge my sins every day confess before god and make things right and just to know that god will still use me amazes me because his holiness is something that we can't comprehend we have an idea of things but we won't know what it really is like until we get there but i'm grateful that god made a statement i always use it he says i'll never leave you nor will i ever forsake you that means all the world to me i don't have to worry about being rejected um you know we we came up through christian i'm thinking that we could be lost at even even given to any given time but if you're in christ there is no way that you can be lost if you were in his mind before the foundation of the world to be bride there is nothing in time that can change that and i'm grateful let us turn by the grace of god to james the first chapter of james please hallelujah from james we'll we'll go to the gospel according to john john 6 james james peter the first chapter beginning at the third verse knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing if any of you like wisdom let him ask of god that give it to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him but let a man ask in faith not wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the seed driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the lord a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways saint john 6th chapter we'll begin reading at the 37th verse of that particular chapter saint john 6 37. and it reads all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out i came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the father's will which have sent me that of all which ye have given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day let us pray our gracious father we thank you we appreciate you so much lord being in this faulty house this frayer body body made of clay fallen as it is you've given us the grace lord to live according to your word and father we come short sometimes we falter but we realize that we have a big brother we have a father we we know lord jesus that because of his acceptance we are accepted in him and lord we thank you for our lord jesus christ and all that he's done for us and will do from now throughout eternity in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated i'll try not to be long and i hate saying that because every time i do that i end up being long but you know i was thinking today even today how what what god would have me to speak tonight because i had some things that i could have continued but i felt like i needed to kind of like put a little pause or something in that area to bring you into a place where you can have confidence in the lord sometimes we waver in our thoughts because we lack faith in him and one thing i know about the lord jesus christ when the fullness of god comes in you understand the lord can never doubt his own word so the problem is never the word is never god himself it's us and we need to die and rot to our own thoughts and ideas the bible said we ought to cast down every evil imagination that exalt itself against the word of god that means that if god has said and has told you something amen that word must have preeminence over your thoughts and your desires but i thought about how dark it is we were some of us were talking there at the house yesterday evening and and it inspired me somewhat to know that we're living in such a dark age and to me it makes god even greater i mean you know to know that this is the as the prophet god said this is the most evilest age we've ever lived in and you and i have not even seen the climax of it uh and we know that evil seducers are whack work worse is worse they're getting worse all the time and even it's amazes me because the world is hoping and looking for messiah and the messiah that they were looking for has come and gone and uh in a sense in which they would be able to see him we find out that the church age locked him out of their age they knocked locked him out and put him on the outside and now they're crying for messiah and they're going to get one but it won't be jesus so we're living in a time that the darkest time that's ever been but we know that it's the darkest before dawn amen and we realize by god's grace that god has brought us such a message that gives us light remember brother branham talked about it after the seals and stains were open he talked about how the bride of jesus christ as far as knowledge we were far ahead of history and and time had to catch up with the word that's why when the prophet of god spoke so many things ah afterwards the seals were open we thought we understood when we did not because time and history events had to take place in order for the word of god to be made manifest so we can see it you know uh prophecy being made clear you know through modern events so we we understand by god's grace how god began to see uh we be we're beginning to see things in the scripture that we've never seen before even among ourselves we have seen you know the fall of men and men worship and all of these things that we start with over in babylon has crossed over you know into our realm and the thing that's so it if god doesn't show you the two spirits that works within the framework of the church you will never see what's going on because it they're they're like twins they're so close together and you know even brother brandon was talking i heard him today talking about twins that you know even their thumb prints are different they're not exactly alike even though they call them identical um you know when it comes down to to to really defining one from the other they have signatures that one or the other doesn't have now i say all of this by the grace of god is that because this is a time of trying and testing it is what we call the time and the age or the or the time period of adoption uh you know because we realize we come through you know the church ages and we come through the tutorials and you know we come through all of this teaching and all of these things but now amen that that we have come to a time where god is testing us to see whether we're worthy of sonship and you and i understand oh i got the holy ghost but the holy ghost is there to teach you the holy ghost is there a men to guide you and to lead you into all truth but it is our duty to be subject to the holy spirit amen this is where the trying comes in now we must always understand that everything we go through everything we go through god has already seen it because he's the alpha and the omega there is nothing in time or out of time that could ever catch god by surprise amen so we understand that we when we come through these tests and oftentimes we say test because most of the time they're like tribulations to us i mean these tests can be very extreme and and very hard but understand that every time god put us in a test is for his glory let me say it let me say it again the end result of every test is that god will be glorified amen right and he comes in the middle or in the time when you least expect him you can't put a time on him every time i think about shadrach meshach and abednego and how god allowed them to walk into the furnace a fire and never showed up until they got in there it amazes me because a lot of time we you know envision you know we're seeing these things with our own eyes and and i don't know how they felt i don't know you know uh but one thing i do know is that they faith hell and and they said you know it doesn't matter what you do to me throw me into the fire but i have a constitution right i will never bow you can kill me but i see the reality of it is that god was not words on a scroll god was life and it was reality so much to those those i call them the bible said boy so but in reality they were real men in character and they held fast the prophet god said it like this he said they even had a prayer meeting and god never answered or showed up it was a time of silence it was a time where god didn't pat him on the back and says hey boys i'm with you it wasn't like when he said to polycop don't fear polycarp no he was quiet how do you stand when god is quiet and you haven't heard from him but one thing for certain the bible tells us that god hears our prayer before we even speak them he knows the very intent of your heart but he try you to see what you're going to do when you can see god as being god you're all right you're going to be okay because you know and understand that nothing can be greater than your god it's been time tested all of the old testament stories our historical stories that we read in there these things are not fictional but they're truth amen amen truth daniel and the lion's den was not some fable like catholic church and other churches teach them they were real men it was a reality to them amen god was a reality hallelujah and they didn't treat god like he was a thing they knew he was god hallelujah you think about it and i don't know my wife and i we've seen real lions they were in a cage but let me tell you something lions are so fierce even when they're in the cage you scared of them yeah they're powerful be uh powerful creatures and you know you think about here these these uh daniel is facing lions and i don't i mean hungry lions and no doubt those lions were disappointed that night because for certain they thought it was meal time but you see it wasn't that time or that kind of time in the mind of god and i want to say it like this you cannot leave this earth until god is through with you that you have fulfilled better understand what i'm saying because when the squeeze come on and when they begin to persecute the church don't be afraid of death because that's how the devil breaks you down you get a little sick you're gonna die you get cancer you're gonna die who says you're gonna die because satan afflicts you with something doesn't mean you're going to die if you have the faith to believe you can say to this mountain mountain be thy move and it has to be moved god testes you sometimes we need things we want things and we feel almost like an urgency oh lord how long how long will it take you how long and just in a moment's time god swings the door open and usually when you have to wait on a blessing the blessing is bigger than what you asked for hallelujah listen you one of the things that we must learn even in the statue of a perfect man we must learn patience and patience is not something that just happens it is something is like building muscles you have to build muscles of faith because it's a time when you have to sit still sit quiet it says wait on god and wait for god and the devil during those times are always there to torment you to make you feel like what you have faith in is a lie but the truth of the matter is he's a liar he can't stop the will of god and when you know that you're in the will of god you can have faith and believe god now you can't have faith when you say oh he's going to do it today and tomorrow i'm not sure he's going to do it that's james said it so don't get mad at me he said a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways oh today it's okay and tomorrow is not see no no no you can't get nothing you have to hold fast now i'm coming to something real now see because i what my my whole thought was seeing through the darkness he's a lamp he's a light to my pathways and i lamp to my feet he he's he's leading me through all of this darkness how you gonna make how in the world you're gonna make this journey without the word and the darkness is the worst we've ever seen it on the face of the earth but through this darkness we understand there's coming a darn a daybreak the light shines where brother books not just in the heavens but the light shines in you is that right i was just listening to what brother brandon was talking the other day he said he thought he was a guide remember on his uh honeymoon the vacation he took took his wife up there thought he'd go hunting you know and he got lost he said he thought he was such a guide but that's not that's not laying on the pages of the book on the tape for you to think to be amused by we all think and like to be in control we take our experiences sometimes and we feel like we're pros at what we're doing in reality we're still lambs and whenever we get to that place you think you know it and you can do it and then god will break you down in such a way you have to say lord jesus i'm lost i need a guide you know that's one thing i loved about brother branham he was just clothed with humility he didn't mind telling it and you and i must understand it's okay to tell it we're supposed to tell it it gives other people's faith it gives them strength to realize they're not the only one that's going through something we supposed to comfort one another in this darkest hour you say what do you mean prior to them leaving out of egypt they knew the blood had been applied but by the the drama that was illustrated to us there were still those who were saying father are you sure hallelujah and we had a messenger that came with the word to dissolve all doubts to make us sure right that's what the bible said make your calling and election sure we are sure why because we understand that the call we have heard was the voice and is the voice of god no man could bring you to this message no man can make you see it no man can give you understanding it is a holy ghost it is christ himself who is leading us through this dark dark hour amen huh is that right see this we come to at this point in our lives to understand the reality of this life the reality of this life did not come to make you lost you understand what i'm trying to say in other words no matter what you go through if you've been in the mind of god if you're a true seed of god there is no way this life can cause you to be lost amen i'ma say that again see if you have you was with god and you don't even know how come you know that you know that you know but you know in spite of all your faults and all of your shortcomings you know you were there something on the inside radiates that through you that's what causes us to repent that's what causes us to feel godly sorrow when we feel when we do wrong because we don't want to displease him something in us testifies of a holy life and a holy place a place of righteousness hallelujah didn't he say i'd not lose one that's exactly what he meant in the reality of this life satan uses the tactic of fear to discourage us and to make us believe that we can be lost jesus says i've gotten you written in the palm of my hand listen people we would not even need calvary if we could do it ourselves it was always grace even under the law it was grace they could never do the law it was always grace and now is grace grace because god understood the trials and tests we would go through i think that was brother ben that preached he's our father he's our father and father loves us as his children guess he would chasten us he will chastise us when we do wrong but i'm trying to get you to a place where if we could see nothing can cause us to be lost maybe we'll be able to move forward into our father's business because that's the only way you can be adopted you must go into the father's business and prove yourself it must be proven he's not going to give you know his business to some kid that is not mature enough to know how to handle it but he gives his business to a son that have proven his maturity you understand what i'm saying you know we talk about healings and deliverances and discernments and all of these gifts that that that should be flowing through the body but brother brown tells us in this last days there's going to be a few people that get it because there is not going to be that many that that would grow up to that maturity know how to handle it amen right we've seen it pentecost didn't know how to handle it they were real gifts every good and perfect gift come from god but what did they do they didn't glorify god they glorified themselves all of a sudden god's ministry became their ministry my ministry what ministry this is all about one kingdom and that is the kingdom of god that's it i like that for all the father giveth me shall come to me there's he didn't say might come he said come to me it doesn't matter if there's a prostitute whoremonger drug addict whatever you know what i mean i don't care if it's a man wearing a dress or a woman wearing pants god is able to clean and sanctify and you and i must realize that we must always open our minds to the fact that god's seed can be anywhere search the highways and the byways and the ditches and the scummy areas that's where they're laid in the last day that's where they were they weren't in the churches because the churches had rejected them it was the people on the corners it was the beggars the people that the society turned down that's where true seed is because one thing for certain if you can show those people that god is god oh my we'll have a revival by one man and by one sister i'm gonna read john and i'm not gonna be long john 9 1-38 i'm trying to get us to see because while we worried [Laughter] you know i you know i i i did i wanted to be about six three or something and and you know i thought i was gonna make it because i grew really tall you know at the first and all of a sudden it came to a halt all my other brothers taller than i am you know and i thought maybe i'll get there or a little above and no and it would not have mattered how much i would have gotten on my knees and prayed lord please you know because god knew my statue he understood the limit everywhere every little part of me could not not go beyond his boundaries on what he saw me as being right one of my closest friends you know he's a short fella and he says man when i get to heaven i'm gonna be this this this and i'll be tall i'm like oh no that's not the way it's gonna be brother god didn't make no mistake with your height if you short here you'll be short there but one thing that brother branham did say he said everything that sin put in you god will take it out hallelujah glory to god john 9 1 through 38 and i i won't i have to read this down because it's it's it's long but but it's wonderful we know the story but i want you to see how blind people becomes by way of traditions and we've been guilty brother branham tells us about how god hates starchy services he said it more than once he even spoke and said things about the canadians you know in in this their statute but that was not a compliment because he said everybody that received the holy ghost acts the same way that's what he says and so you and i we understand we allowed as i said not all teachers but there were those who literally took the holy spirit away from us and we allowed it the actions of it you know they didn't mind if you fell into the tradition of looking holy like the pharisees but they couldn't care less about the inside of the cup and that's what that's what jesus said he said listen outwardly you look like white as sepulchre he said but inside your dead men bones where is the life where is this holy ghost we're talking about and you and i being the bride most should be the most powerfulest church on the face of the earth it shouldn't be something like oh what are those people oh what those people believe no no no no it should be such a powerful life that people should see it is that right he said don't take your light and put it on the bushel he said now put it up on a pinnacle where some people can see it it's supposed to be seen this message is the life of the message is supposed to be seen hallelujah i'm pushing i'm pressing i fall i come short just like everybody else but i get up yes and as jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth and his disciples asked him saying master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind and jesus answered neither hath this man sin nor his parents but that the works of god should be made manifest in him so let me say it like this it doesn't matter what condition you were born into you're in the message you're in the word and you have been born for a purpose and that purpose amen is that god will be manifested in you that's what it's all about i keep crying out lord help us be about our father's business and we need to find what his business is you know what this business is go ye therefore right teach all nations is that right that's what he said we are soul winners but how we're going to win souls if we don't even believe that our souls have been won we're fighting as i said the devil has a fighting each other of fighting ourselves we're fighting oh lord am i saved and my bride that's nonsense he said my sheep heareth my voice and a stranger they will not follow have you heard his voice hallelujah there have been many people in this world looked at william branham saw him but never heard the voice that came out of him but you and i have heard the voice and we know that it is not the voice of a man but it's the voice of god through a man and we don't care what people think about us hallelujah those who follow jesus they didn't care what other people thought about them they knew they had met the messiah and if the people knew the scripture the bible said in the days of the son of man what was that day this day as it was in the days of sodom as it was in the days of noah god would reveal the son of man and the son of man is another term for profit that god would visit this generation in the form of a prophet and he did it and the world missed it and a lot of people in the mess is still missing it like i said if he didn't come how did he take a picture who was that brother branham identified that cloud just like john the baptist identified jesus he said that's my lord he had to that's why he kept saying listen even you listen to the tapes from 63 afterwards when the sears were open he kept trying to tell the people i'm going i'm leaving it won't be long and he kept saying well if i'll i'm not the one maybe someone would come after me and you know we got people trying to take that out and take that in such a way and the revelation is did not elisha come after elijah and did not elisha finish up elijah's work hello and elijah is not one man it's the body of jesus christ with the double anointing on her listen and that's the thing it is support we're supposed to do and we don't know on record how many miracles elijah did but we're supposed to do twice the amount oh where is it then can we stand in the pulpit and say this is that people to say this is that and until we get there we need to keep pressing until this become that everything william branham preached god preached through him amen it's supposed to manifest itself through the people of god that's the truth it never was supposed to be a social society and yet we've made it thus i must work the works of him oh lord have mercy oh look let me let me back up to the third verse he said jesus answered neither have this man sin nor his parents but that the works of god shall be made manifested in him i must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work and where are we where are we and let me tell you something we we if we be in dalatory yes god help us help us help us help us because listen when when when when when the squeeze come on brother brother said there'll be many people that will die because they stand for this message but you don't hear that being preached i just heard him the other day on it and if he said it that's what's going to happen i know something's going to happen in america is that right brother brown said the last elijah's last stand was on the white house help us jesus as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world is he still the light he is still the light that's why we must live it because we are the light we must be different we must prove we did not come from satan's eden when he had thus spoken he spat on the ground and made clay of the spiral and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with clay and he said unto him go wash in the pool of sion which is interpreted sent he went his way therefore and washed and came seeing the neighbors therefore and they which before had seen him that he was blind and said is not this he that sat and begged now look at this never ever has this ever happened again happened before it was a miraculous thing and you'll never even find this that kind of thing happening in the old testament where a man was born blind and regained his sight never and you and i must understand it was so miraculous but instead of the people see what i'm saying they were so traditionally engaged they were blind and instead of seeing jesus as being the messiah they were so traditionally taught these things should not take place on the sabbath day and if it happens on the sabbath day this man must be a devil see how messed up in their minds and if we're not careful we'll think when nobody's got the holy ghost except those around our little clique like i said the other day amen elijah thought the same thing and the word of the lord came to him says no no no no no i have seven thousand you got people who can't even read and they know more about god than some people who can hallelujah you see how how messed up this can be what happens if god raised up a man who didn't grow up in the message but the message is in him christ is the message jesus christ is the message look with the pharisees they were so traditionally blind they could not see that god could use a prostitute and god took a prostitute something they wouldn't touch or even look at or even speak to and he took that woman and led her into the simon's house and openly embarrassed them openly put them to shame and openly rebuked them because they said to you know jesus caught their thoughts you know and he says listen i came here you didn't wash my feet you didn't worship me you didn't do nothing to show me favor but this woman came in she bowed herself down to me she started washing my feet she washed my her my feet were and dried up with her tears and dried with her hair simon tell me in other words he she didn't even say lord i want to be saved she didn't even open her mouth but knowing he was the word he was able to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart and he says woman your sins be forgiven and these people were so blind in their traditions this can't be how could this man let him you know touch and feel on his feet and oh you know what it had to really look bad hallelujah but just like jesus told them it's not what goes in it's what comes out washed his feet and these traditional pharisees and we've got many of them set right there and criticized you let somebody get wild in church before they think it's the holy ghost they think it's a demon because they're not used to the holy ghost y'all understand me that's the truth and i've seen it i've seen it i've seen great men of god in this message afraid of the holy ghost the holy ghost started move starts moving and they'll shut it down i've been to meetings like that personally i would not lie from the pulpit i told that brother i said if he would have come to shut me down he surely would have thought i had a demon i wouldn't have fought him i ought to worship god twice as much i would ought to transform myself into a david and he would have had something on his hand they would have put me out for disturbing church service oh i know it i know it i know it i know me but you know what maybe a little self might have been in it but anyway they would not have told me to sit down y'all don't fall asleep back there please you're so quiet ain't even saying amen but god is speaking anyhow some said this is he others he is like him but he said i am he didn't he want to believe the man's testimony therefore said they unto him how were thine eyes open he answered and said a man that is called jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said unto me go to the pool of sin home and wash and i went and washed and i received sight then they said unto him where is he he said i not i know not they brought to the pharisees him that a four time was blind and it was the sabbath day when jesus made the clay and opened his eyes you think god made a mistake he understood their traditional errors he rebuked them from for their hypocrisy he said if you had had an ox that fall in the ditch on the sabbath day you would have gotten him out and here's a daughter of god that is being healed and you having a problem with that you hypocrite which one is worth more the ox or the one that is the daughter of god see we we we we just we don't understand it sounds like i'm being critical i'm just being honest i'm being straightforward because i want god to deal with all of us tonight and open our eyes so we can be free like we're supposed to be free it's true holy spirit comes in the service and you're worried about what other people think i don't care if you say run run jump whatever sometimes he might say go lay hand on that brother go lay hands on that sister as long as you're not disturbing the preacher do it we're just to we just to something we we lock him out because we're so concerned about what other people are going to think and oh i don't want to disturb the service isn't that funny god told a lady to go pray for a lady and her baby and she said oh no i can't do it brother branham is here y'all remember the story and what happened god said god through brother graham said the lady is healed when you pray for you see them you see what i'm saying we push it off on other people and we fail to see god trying to use you oh i got to wait to the pastor you don't have to wait for the pastor the power of healing is in you if you got god in you whatsoever you doing word or deed do it all in the name of jesus we don't have a hierarchy here god help us like i said the early church they didn't have a bible we don't know how long it took the scrolls to get to their churches but one thing they were totally led by the holy spirit every day god is the word god is the word didn't is that right he said i will write my word upon the tables of your heart therefore the there since the pharisees this man is not of god because he keepeth not the sabbath day others said how could a man that is a sinner do such miracles and where and there was a division among them they said unto the blind man again what saith thou of him that he have opened thine eyes he said he is a prophet but the jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and received insight until they called the parents of him isn't that something they're asking the man who was blind you see what i'm saying there is such denial because jesus didn't come from their denomination or organization right that that's what happened with jesus they asked him what authority did you have in other words what branch of religion did you come from i mean where did you get your doctrine degree you know did you graduate magnum laude see they didn't understand where he came from how can you have such an authority and know the word as well as you do i still i still wonder i still wonder how on earth jesus got in that pulpit and they knew about him and they he got in that position and opened the scriptures at this day the scripture is fulfilled and he sits in the chair of elijah but he just he did things to just disturb them he broke their traditions he he he he was a rebel to them they hated him because they knew they couldn't stop him the power of god was with him even nicodemus said we know that they are a teacher come from god because no man can do these things see so they understood and what i'm trying to tell us you know we we must you know we've seen how the organizations in the nomination did brother random and they didn't understand when they were putting him out they were fulfilling revelations the third chapter where jesus was standing outside the doorknob they had no idea what they were doing but the word of god said they were going to do it you understand me so you say well what do you mean brother brooks listen i'm going to tell you something brother branham if you heard me say this earlier brother branham has fulfilled his word the word of god but the bride of jesus christ was left on record message a message a message of of of maturing a message of coming because he talks about y'all better listen to those tapes he and i mean listen with a different ear not a traditional ear oh i'm going to learn to see how deep i can get no feed me lord this is bread from heaven this is bread from the shekinah glory it is the only thing that's going to transform you no man can do it i know how people think they're wrong in so many ways but you know i'm not going to get into doctrinal issues right now his parents and listen they were afraid right you go ask him he old enough see that's how you know instead of standing there what a miracle your child been born blind he's 30 years old and you're afraid of men but this man may have been born blind but he could see through the darkness that's where i'm going he may have been born blind but he could see through the darkness he understood what hypocrisy was he could see the pharisees and what they really were even when they they saw miracle the miracle listen he says listen nothing has been done like this ever before wearing the scripture wearing the scrolls and then you got the audacity to say this is of the devil he says show me in the word where a sinner was able to do such a thing he said judges any way you want to but i'll tell you like this i once was blind but now i see hallelujah it wasn't only that he saw jesus but he saw the system amen hallelujah and kicking them out of the system was the best thing that could happen the prophet god preached a message then jesus came sometimes you've got to go through those dark moments to before jesus come and rescue you hallelujah oh jesus help us lord we don't take a stand for this message like we do we want to make it a tradition you know we want to make it a yesterday and brother said that's the problem we always look backwards and see what god has done in the past and we always say what he's going to do in the future and we can't even see what he's doing now this is not a mind game god is not just feeding our mind with the word so we can intellectually know him what page is on and what book is out of god don't even care you're the living you are the living word what god wants that he wants that bible he wants those tapes he wants those books to transform move off the page into the vessel living epistles written and read of all men that's what he wants and everybody's looking at oh who's got the biggest church and we understand having big churches don't mean one thing to god you're preaching right you ain't gonna have one big church hello jesus had multitudes until he started preaching it right you ain't following me for my word you follow me for the fish and the laws it's true i'm telling you you you you have a meeting even in in the message church you have a meeting and tell people you don't have food people come from out of the world where you ain't no you've never seen them before but they're there god help us jesus same spirit then king then again called them they the man that was blind and said unto him give god the praise we know that this man is a sinner and he answered and said whether he be a sinner no i know not one thing i know that whereas i was blind now i see then they said to him again what did he do today how how open he thine eyes and he answered them i have told you already in other words why are you bugging me i didn't already told you this and you did not hear wherefore would you hear it again will you also listen he's being sassy he's annoyed yeah and he says listen you're going to hear together and told you one time wherefore would ye hear it again will you also be his disciples he shut him up being didn't he then they reviled him and said thou art his disciple but we are moses disciples there you go they were so blind they couldn't see the move of god they couldn't see their visitation they didn't it was right in the word i mean come on when when uh i said like this can any good thing come out of nazareth see that's all people look at but they don't see they don't see they don't see how god immorphy clothes himself in human flesh and i'm going to tell you now if you don't believe that god has come in the flesh john says you're antichrist and what let's bring it to your table if you don't believe that god comes into your flesh you are antichrist this building has nothing to do with holiness it's you you are the temple of god and that's where god wants to occupy you listen all of us need to be sanctified because he can't do it otherwise hello it's the truth you want more god you got to get rid of your stuff we want to see a revival get rid of the trash lord is me standing in the kneel of prayer me lord not my brother not my sister it's me but don't you worry he's working on me he's doing just what he promised he was going to do and i'm really excited about it we know that god here is not sinners but if any man be a worship of god and do this will him he hear it since the world began was it not preaching or he preaching to the preachers it was not her that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind if this man were not of god he could not he could do nothing they answered and said to him thou was all altogether born in sin see what i'm saying you know they don't ask the question who did sin jesus said nobody but this is done to the glory to be the glory of god now they put the man back in sin and does thou teach us and they can't they cast him out jesus heard that they had cast him out and when he had found him he said unto him does thou believe on the son of god and he answered and said who is this lord who is he lord that i might believe on him and jesus said to him thou hast both seen him and is he it is he that talketh with thee and he said lord i believe and just what he did he worshipped him we don't know where he was he wasn't in a building he was wherever jesus was he broke out into worship what was it jesus freed him and he whom the son set free is free indeed freed him from his natural blindness freedom from his organizational blindness right and he came to jesus he saw the word he understood the word was god because no jew would have worshipped another man not a real one traditions of men blinds are so terribly bad and they creep up like serpents it always start out right and ends up wrong there are things that we are to do that are not traditions they're ordered by god things like dressing holy and living holy and you know baptism and communion and things of those natures those things are god-ordered they're not traditions of men traditions of men is when they add things to things you know they measure your dress and say it has to be so long you know different stupid stuff like that right but where lest any man spoil you through philosophies and vain deceit let me tell you something you will never have to worry about the way a woman dress or a man dress if their heart is right god will teach you don't tell me he won't he will beware lest any man spoil you through philosophies and vain deceit after tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after christ right we we you know we we can't allow ourselves to to focus on you know shouting and dancing and speaking in tongues and that's really good i love it all but we're in the time of change it's about changing from glory to glory it's about changing into his image it's about changing and pressing amen into from brotherly kindness into divine love yes and these things come by what prayer believing god's word and praying he said you have not because you what ask not for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principalities and powers and we we fall into real worship of men we worship men because this man has a certain name and that man has a certain name this man got a big church and that man got a big church and let me tell you something that's just what the pentecostals do bishop so and so and bishop this and whatever bishop said whatever the board of bishop do that's what we do nonsense it's a trick of the devil god don't have cookie cutters every person is an individual but we come together like living stones to worship god brother bam says here a woman standing here i'm a young man waiting to get married she's she meets my specifications every way she's a lovely christian she looks like one she's dressed like one oh she got a dress oh yeah she acts like one she lives like one i i'll admit she make me a good wife but she isn't mine till i take her for mine you understand me because all of the traditions all of the things we do y'all can look bright but you're not bright till he take you that's the way the message is you can sympathize with it and say it's right but you've got to take it to yourself to become part of it then you and the message become one then the anointings with you as it is with the others like moses and elijah and all these things that the same anointing is now with you that's who do you say this is he preached such a powerful message trying to get the people to recognize their day and his message hallelujah can i go just a little bit further just like this comes amen from who is this melchizedek he says listen just like a great architect can sit down in his mind and draw out what the what he thinks it's he's going to do to build create now he cannot create he can take something that's been created and make it in in in a different form because god is the only way only one can create but he gets in his mind what he's going to do and that his thought that that's his desire now it's a thought and then he speaks it and it's a word then and a word is a thought and when it is expressed it's a word a thought expressed is a word but it has to be a thought first so it's god attributes it becomes a thought then a word notice those who have have tonight eternal life was with him and in him and in his thinking before there ever was an angel star cherubim or anything else so let me say it in in in our little way of terms brother venom says even when i was a child or he said how can i say it he says when you was a child you knew you were different something told you you were different you were odd and you couldn't even figure it out in in in reality that that was representation that was election pulling on you how many times you should have been dead and god didn't let it happen huh so many things have happened in your life and and you don't even know how you got out of it but god brought you and when everybody criticized you you were can i can i say you know you were the black sheep of the family he was the one that god they didn't want around right and when i say that i mean anybody can be a black sheep you could be chinese and still be a black sheep but my point is you're the one that they rejected and you know i looked that up because i didn't know what a black sheep was and a black sheep when they're born among the white sheep the black sheep don't they don't want nothing to do with it isn't that crazy but anyhow that's just the way it is see so those kind of things even go down to the animal yeah anything that's different people are afraid of it right he isn't god see see so what happens you know uh we can't even understand why we love god how many of y'all know why all we can say is because he first love us that's it you can't listen let's say it like this the holy ghost in you you can't even explain it it's unexplainable but yet you know you got it my god he is and if he's infinite he is if and if he isn't infinite let me go back in his thinking before there ever was an angel star cherubim or anything else that's eternal and if you have eternal life you always was not your being here but the shape and form that the infinite god and if he's is an infinite he is he isn't god god has to be infinite we are finite he is infinite and he was omnipotent omniscient omnipotent excuse me i'm the president omniscient omnipotent if he isn't then he can't be god knows all things all places because his omnipotence uh i'm the president omnipotential makes him omnipotent i'm the present he is a being he's not like the wind he is a being he dwells in the house but being omnis omniscient knowing all things make him omnipresent because he knows everything that's going on so i'm gonna break it down before i i'm almost done the reality of the believer is that god is not far the reality of a believer we understand that god is in this place right now we know that not only does god occupy this space but also angels do too and if we could open it up and see it it probably would terrify us because of the holiness and you can't ever think that god don't hear your thoughts because the bible tells us he he heard them before they got there now my thing is this is that you know if we could see god and this is what we do the reality is we put god so far away and we forget he's in here if we could remember he's here we would stress out we wouldn't worry we wouldn't fear because we know god is in his temple he's in there if we could remember that god is not just is in heaven but we are the ones that are in heavenly places in christ jesus right and he's just another dimensional way we can't see him but he can see us right that's why i try to tell people don't think you sneaking around and doing stuff and god don't see you he see you you know when i confess to the lord i don't only just confess to him i confess to his angels and everybody that was looking on y'all looking at me like crazy but it's true lord forgive me heaven watches you you know yes they do remember the story about babylon lord have you seen what's going on in babylon those were angels reporting to god you're never alone he said you wouldn't be and you never are television does not manufacture a picture a television only channels it into a circuit and then the television screen picks it up but the picture is there to begin with television wasn't here television was here when adam was here television was here when elijah said on mount carmel television was here when jesus of nazareth walked the shores of galilee but you're just now discovering it they would have have they wouldn't have believed it back there you have been crazy to have said something like it but now it's become a reality you understand so god even through science has shown us that these dimensions do exist and so is it christ and so is it that christ is here that's what he said if television he said christ is here the angels of god are here and someday in the great millennium to come it'll be just more real than television or anything else because they are here he reveals himself in his great form of what he claimed as he's a morphe himself into his servants and proves himself ah my i i need to need to close but but but let me tell you in my thought last thought i'll say this we got to recognize the power election because the power of election supersedes grace did you know that because if he wasn't elected you wouldn't have grace the election came first then grace and you know it works with grace right but god chose you to experience grace and when you realize that i came from god and i go back to god you understand like a dew drop you had to fall but the same dew drop sees a resurrection when the sun strikes it and pulls it back into its proper place and that's where we are the reality is i came from god and i go back to god nothing can stop me from going back because i'm a part of him and he's a part of me but then said but let your faith touch him and watch what happened now if i believe god's servant and have told you the truth god will vindicate that to be the truth and that would prove that jesus christ is living tonight see if you can believe what he said and you believe he's truly a prophet you believe what he says and god will vindicate it he will vindicate it to you that's the way it works the reality of we got to stop you know um we can stand we got to stop thinking if you truly seed you know you know that the whole thing about today is that everybody's trying to be something they're not you know you got all those trans this and trans that and i'm not going to speak much on that but no matter how much they trans they'll never be god knew what he did it was doing when he made man he knew what he did was doing when he made woman you know and the the evolution they're trying to find is not in science it's in god that god would take a sinner such as i such as you transform us into sons and daughters of god replants us in the new world we'll come again after we dust turn into dust we'll come again by the voice of god he'll call us from the earth and we'll find ourselves walking the new streets of jerusalem it won't be no babies there so when you hear people say oh i went to heaven and i saw babies and all day i don't know they might have went somewhere but it wasn't not the heaven i'm talking about babies came by the way of the fall it never was to be and so calvary brought us back to the reality of what we should be and there ain't a thing satan can do because jesus christ conquered death hell and the grave now we are in a place of restoration god is restoring us so you can come brother sing a song or two or so i don't know if there's anybody that needs prayer you're more than welcome to come up but i'll say one thing we should be the most happiest people in the world we don't need psychiatry we don't need that we just need the power of god reading books on how to do this and how to do that we need god you get god he'll show you how to do it i often wonder we all got all these cookbooks and i think who was the first cook and where did the inspiration come from [Music] the earliest i know is the bible god told israel how to bake cook the lamb how to roast the the herb how to do all of that and i guess it all came from there i don't know but one thing i know is that god is in control and i'm glad he is i just can't worry because i want and either you came from god or you didn't you got to believe that you did something tell you you came from god believe it [Music] just pray [Music] jesus [Music] through it all [Music] i've learned to depend upon [Applause]
