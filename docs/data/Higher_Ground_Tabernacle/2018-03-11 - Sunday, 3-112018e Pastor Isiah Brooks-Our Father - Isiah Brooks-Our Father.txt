bringing healing to oh don't stop freeing it all the Lord is nice oh don't stop he'll cry and it is true amen yes Lord glad to see my sister are you doing this evening a manga bless you amen you know God is so good to us hallelujah Matthew six please we had a good time there in Iowa City appreciate your prayers yeah appreciate our brother rich going with this we're going to start reading at the ninth verse of the sixth chapter of Matthew after this manner therefore pray our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven you love the Lord let us pray father we thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy thank you for the reading of your word Lord we just pray that tonight that you just have have your way give us the strength increase our faith in you Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated when we use this little illustration again by God's grace and I just hope that you can see what I'm working with but I'm liking this bottom here as being God and I'm alike in this bottle as being his adversary which is the devil you have two origins here this amen is eternal life and this here is the beginning of a creation or creation Lucifer has never been eternal had he been eternal he would have remained with God remember the scripture says if they were not of us if they were of us they would have remained but because they're not of us they leave and so you and I must understand Amen that those who came from God will always go back to God Jesus himself said I have never lost one Moses told Pharaoh I would not even loot leave oh one hoof behind you understand me so when God gathers and I'm gonna read that scripture in just a minute when God gather he comes to gather his own you understand me redeem means to buy back that which once was yours and so so Redemption tells us that somewhere in eternity we was God with God and so you must understand Amen that that that's why Lucifer can be destroyed Amen because he was created being at the time of Lucifer's reign or at the time that Lucifer was if I could say in a position of holiness none of the Angels knew who he was Amen they just thought he was one of them but your origin will always determine what is manifest down the road alright and so Lucifer because he would God said iniquity was found in him he did not even speak it with his own mouth but God being a god that can judge the heart so what was in the heart of Lucifer for thou have said in your heart I will Excel I will Excel I would go beyond I will exalt myself above the stars of God so God saw that now you must understand that there is only one God and God is a jealous God he says in the Book of Isaiah Amen if there's any other god I don't know him Amen so we realized by God's grace that this is God let's put it this way alright the Bible tells us that Jesus Christ was the fullness of the Godhead bodily alright amen he said unto David David said he said David wanted to build God a house he said what house can you build me right Tim ha heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool what can you build me but the Bible tells us that God prepared himself a body right so I want you to understand if I took this let's put take this out of the bottle let's say this is in this is God's Spirit right now we're not interested in the bottle we interested in what the bottle is contained in we want that substance and if this is God in this bottle amen ask I'm trying to give you a great scenario so you can see what I'm working with God poured all of his substance let's put it this way all of his character into Jesus Christ and this is what Jesus Christ says I can't do nothing except I see the father do it so the Bible tells us that Jesus Christ that God is a spirit no man I've seen God at any time follow me now because I'm gonna deal with you you need to know exactly who you are and where you come from amen once you come to know who you really are you as an individual becomes an invincible army Satan cannot just do it we'll what he desired to do with you because at that time when you come to know who you are you understand that you are Satan's God Satan is not your God you rule over him you come from the royal family your sons and daughters of God and Satan has never been a son yeah II understand me because to be a son you have to be begotten II right okay and the Bible tells us that Jesus Christ was the only begotten right so we find out that all that was in God he poured it into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured it into what the church right that means you you you all of us who got the Holy Ghost that is God in you right that's what he did at the communion he did it at the communion one bread one God broken into what many pieces but it takes all those pieces to make one bread right in Jesus he was one body but in his bride he's many bodies so much so a man no man can number them to make myself clear and plain by God's grace so you would understand among the Jewish people they said to kill a man to kill a universe hello think about if you can love a man what you're doing so if you're kill a man you kill but you kill a universe why would you say that because understand we'll never know how many seeds were in the tree of Abel because he was killed but let's look at his dad his dad it was Adam look what Adam has produced numbers cannot be numbered from the days of Adam from the days all the way up you see all the seed all mankind all the image of Adam amen multiplying multiplying multiplying and we know that one soul saved is worth ten thousand worlds so you talk about a kingdom you're talking about a one tree because you and I know how it is you got an apple tree you got an orange tree and each tree produces fruit year at the year at the year at the year until there's no more seeds in the tree but you are look at that one seed that you plant it understand that seed came from somewhere so some multiplication is a consistence is a a constant C being reproduce reproduce reproduce reproduce what if you stopped that one seed right so that's what the devil tried to do he tried to stop the seed of of Jesus Christ like he stopped the seed of Seth Seth has no seed Seth has nothing right so you look at this thing and say what brother was what are you trying to say I'm bringing us to a point you came from somewhere and you're going somewhere but if you came from God there is no way you've been turned back into this sea because once God brings you out of himself you will always be here right and remember Jesus said I have never I won't lose one right so we understand that even though tree bring forth alphabets from the same tree one Apple may be bigger than the other one Apple may be redder than the other one my Apple might be more round than the other but they all came from that tree why because God is a variety God loves a variety you understand me so I'm saying these things so you can understand because if you can understand that God is your father it will elevate you it would bring you to a place where God is no longer a stranger mmm and you look at these things you say what brother what are you trying to say where are you going with this our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name holy is thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth not above earth not alone Earth but in you in you in earth as it is in heaven is that right because you got to realize that heaven was in Adam wherever God is is heaven so heaven was in Adam and what happened is when Adam sinned he lost heaven for the moment because Adam could never lose his sonship sin never law made us lose our sonship it only broke our relationship right you could never lose your sonship I don't care how bad what am i children how they may misbehave they can never I could never decide how can I say I can never disown them and and even though they made this own me but the blood tests showed that they are mine now I'm getting a little happy I'm trying to hear amen so you got to realize amen that's why it's important to get the Holy Ghost having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his right only the seal of God will show you who you are hmm in other words if the man is that spanking the train he patched all those virtues in you and what virtue see putting in you his own it is Christ in you the hope of glory and once all of himself is placed in you he seals it and what does he steal the width Son of God read the package son of God daughter of God you understand me and that seal cannot be broken until it reaches destiny so we come from God and we go back to God oh you say brother books I don't see it let me say it like this Jeremiah I knew you Jeremiah was born a sinner but God said I knew you before the foundation of the world hallelujah and how can God know Jeremiah before the foundation the world called him to be a prophet if God did not know him and he didn't come from God he came from God Oh people say well I don't understand how Solomon can be saved I'll tell you how he can be saved he is saying why Solomon came from God the Lord justify who he will he forgives whom he will it's not by power is not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord Oh I'm coming to something in just a moment but we look at this thing and you know what I love God for you know what I'm just so loving for because he promised he's not like us we promised and somehow things going or get in the way and messes up the promise and we can't fulfill it but there is not one promise God has ever made mankind and didn't fulfill it if God has given you a promise you can rest on that promise that is going to be so I don't care what Satan tries to do the only thing that Satan can delete you or whip you with his unbelief is that right that's how he broke down by unbelief but if you believe amen if you believe his word hallelujah is like a wall of fire about you Satan K penetrate your faith hallelujah oh come on somebody when God said unto his disciples if you say to this mountain be thou move and believe in that heart it shall be moved what was he telling them it's like a man training his son where one you're part of me I know what you're capable of doing because I'm the one that created it all and if you say to this mountain understand you're a part of me and the part of me in you will make that mountain move he tried to teach them what it was to be esta poll a fall and son versus a restored son how Jesus was never fallen so he he he he was the example he was a picture-perfect person if I could say like that to show them what it was and what is supposed to be to be a restored son he didn't have to be restored he is but we've been fallen we needed to see the supernatural we needed to see what we were supposed to be can I use that word we needed to see what God was trying to evolve us into you need fish go for it you need money go for it huh because the power is in the tongue is that word the Bible said life and death is in the tongue whatever you speak that's what you gonna get if you speak death you're gonna get death if you speak life you're gonna get life hallelujah if you allow your atmosphere to be negative that's what you're going to get but if your atmosphere is positive hold on like Paul's atmosphere Paul said we're more than conquerors who Christ Jesus not just a Kagura more than a conquerer ma because we know the Conqueror right God is our Father when you were born again you'll no longer connected to your natural parents hallelujah bah when you're born again your DNA changes you got God's blood in you now [Music] so he wants you to act like gods hallelujah I didn't say he he wanted you to act like the God he's the only God hallelujah but we must God is willing to use you because no man has seen God at any time and often time you the only God that man will will be able to see you the housing of God is that the word the Bible said no you not that you are the temple of God Alleluia Lord let that will be done in earth as it is in heaven hallelujah listen he turned out like a daddy the Cain have a choice he came from a devil so what else could he be [Music] hallelujah you've never seen an apple tree bring forth the orange one or pear tree bring forth Lymon is what ever see me in you is what you're going to be there are vessels of Honor they're vessels of dishonor and God uses them both is that right oh you want to be mighty you want to be famous you you know what God could have made you a pharaoh that's not life life is Christ Jesus having him on the inside is worth more than anything you can bow come on nobody can buy this did you choose to be in the family that you were born in tune absolutely not and perhaps as a child you may able to look at somebody else's family's old man they look like they got a good everything looked like they got a good but you don't know what gold like my mom used to say you don't know what goes on behind closed doors hallelujah I am so thankful that God has made it so that you don't even have to be smart to be in God's army hallelujah oh let me say I am so glad that God didn't the only way you can make this this madness message or this army you have to have a perfect recall thank you Jesus because y'all know me hallelujah huh but in all of this even God didn't care he just knew that you and I was somewhere the God said well I can't remember where brother Isaiah Brooks is he never lost me I lost God God didn't lose me oh I found God no I didn't God found me I was the one that was lost hallelujah this is when we talk about the promises of God and as I'm gonna go back to this because remember if you kill your brother that's like killing a tree and everything that that tree owns and possesses is dead and this is why Jesus amen the devil thought well praise God if he is the son of God I got him now because he has no seed but he didn't understand that this tree wasn't a natural tea tree this tree lived before a man he ever was created this tree was the Tree of Life a lujah and this tree was in the Garden of Eden is that right oh you say you're not a tree - our tree your fruit tree it proves it right is that right bring forth fruit even Jesus saying you're supposed to bring forth true fruit and the service should I be like a tree planted by the river of water y'all won't be to stand still let me stand still but I feel a mint sometimes a man I feel like sometimes we forget where we come from the birds don't are not show an intelligent but when it comes to God they praise God more than me and ooh hallelujah the trees you'll never see him complaining when the wind is blowing so tough this forever no matter how they are beat down they go down they steer praising God hallelujah amid the winking blow live off of the tree and the tree will still praise God and sway in the wind that tree know whose God who is God you say a tree can't hear yes they cared if a son of God or God speak to it Jesus said I could say to these rocks and these rocks will cry out of you don't tree be plucked up was the pre tree withered he how did that tree whether that tree musta had an ear to hear a good word of God y'all don't understand everything here's the voice of God I don't care if it's a solid rock it can hear the voice of God ooh Oh what you're talking about water can hear the voice of God when Moses spoke to that water what did it do hallelujah so you must understand mankind is the one that's fallen and that's the reason why we can't so easily he revives but in order to hear the voice you have to follow him from A to Z right you say well what do you mean brother let me say it like this you're gonna make mistakes God knows if you're really truly going in you do not want to make a sin have a sinful life anybody loves saying in here I was saying down there in in Iowa City you know I hate it when my mind I allow my mind to go through bad things Oh y'all don't do that and sometimes we can you need you know you just the devil just he comes and you know you you try to fortify yourself but there I love this we're saving this school walk to you and waiting he's waiting for that little crack hallelujah and here come with that little crack through that crack and make you think all kinds of bad things about yourself and that God don't love you hey and you ain't gonna make it and all these nonsensical things and yet and still will go through it and will keep going if God don't shake us and cause us to you know snap out of it you know that's the truth because you know what a serpent hands that about it they say serpents charm Birds serpents can charm you by looking at you and mesmerizing you it has like a witchcraft about itself amen and and all it has to do is just catch your eyes and while you watching it it just steadily slowly moving on up to that place where you can consume you that's what he does does it to a lot of people amen and you must recognize the serpent as being something evil you can't say whoo look at that beautiful snake did you see the size yeah you got to realize Amen that you are in in in it this is a war but you come out right but you still gotta fight I was saying how did Jacob how did Jacob get what he got in the Bible said listen Jacob I love and Esau I hate how come because God saw what he saw was gonna do he saw the choice of Esau and guess what Esau did not come from God like we did he saw wasn't a true son of God and guess what they both came out of the same moon how did that happen you understand me in order to have eternal life now you have had you had to have eternal life before anything that's eternal cannot die Alleluia how could you have lived with God whether be add to me whatever it was but how could you have been there all this time and took you how long to get here you got here is that right and you and I know I'm million to one there was a million of more amen other germs trying to get to that egg many of them cross right over the egg hallelujah but God ordained you to come through that woman hallelujah and if you made it then you can make it now that's why I look at it hallelujah Oh glory to God we shall be just like him you know God ain't gonna stop until we are God doesn't do an unfinished work it is perfect in itself God Amen working in you you said what Lord I want to be like you don't worry he's gonna make you just like him hallelujah is that right my point is you gonna fall you gonna come short you're gonna have a lot of pain I'm not trying to take away the effects of sin sin is really bad to be Oh disobedient is really bad hallelujah thank about the many times that we disobey God and all Adam had to do was warning is one thing and look what we into and we have to ask God for many minutes that's why you've got to forgive one another you gotta love one another is that right remember the man who had this big debt there was a man under his authority who had a debt and this man this man that was under this man a man he come-to said why don't you please help me forgive me you know there's another a man was so angry gave him a time period to pay his debt he didn't so he he really had this man beaten hallelujah yummy hey man and then when the news went back to the man who was above the other man let me let me say like this your brothers and sisters may do one wrong or - thanks to you amen and you want to hold it how many things you Oh God how much do we owe God how many times we need to go to her how many times we go to him all the time not forgive me Lord forgive me Lord forgive me hmm that's why Jesus said if you can't forgive your brother neither will I forgive you and there are many so called Christians if I can say like wet like that wash it and say it that way but there are many Christians who are now lost because they didn't have the ability to forgive let me tell you something the only way you can't forgive you must be elected and chosen by God to be to forgive is that right you say how beat that can be let me show you how deep it is Jesus spat in his face slapped him around call him the devil they did everything they could do to put bitterness in his heart but he was too saviour paulina he was full of the Holy Ghost hallelujah so God stepped back the Spirit of God stepped back and said okay son you got to take cavalry as a man hallelujah I'm with you now but I'm with you hallelujah see he step out there because you know what Jesus had to become sin hallelujah he couldn't stay there like he was because he had to feel every pain he had to feel every blow he had to feel every word everything that was said to him he felt because of you and I but he had an obligation he had a purpose in life and he understood by the scripture he was the Lamb of God he was the one that was going to take this sin charge away from us hallelujah you said what do you mean I'm saying he understood we were family he understood Amy that right you've heard me say it many times when Jesus mother came to him say Lord your mother's here he said who is my mother who is my brother who is my sister but those who do my father's will hallelujah those are my people the real people are my people are those who are full of the Holy Ghost those are kind from the God family so are you so are you and when you God family let me tell you something you're like another Steven let him cast the stones let them hit him hit you in your face let him stone you to death but at the end of the day you said father hold not these things to their charge hallelujah what do you mean brother Brooks he was the same as his father his father said Father forgive them for they know not what they do if we're gonna see a powerful revival in this church we're gonna have to have l.o.v.e capital Devine that right and you not understand one thing for certain Amen that perfect love is based on forgiveness I'd love to say it - is that right because listen would Adam its wife sinned against him hallelujah do you ever see it in the scripture where she came up to Adam says I'm sorry there is no repentance there if it is is not written hallelujah but Adam so loved her his whole duty amen now is seen he was always a husband but now that his wife is sinned against him he could have said what in the world have you done I'm going to the proper and I'm gonna ever tell him to give me another one but he didn't he's so loved her you'll never see in the scripture what all Adam did before the fall hallelujah now we had a property came and told us some of the things Amen that Adam had the authority to do but it's nothing written and said Adam did this out of the debt so we don't know can you imagine amen are you hearing every day oh I love you I love you I love you I love you now how you know that you don't never know you'll never know how much a person loves you until they offend you when they do something wrong contrary to you you'll know how much you love them huh because the love is long-suffering love covers a multitude of seeing God now I'm not talking about this a filial love that akil's about it because he's jealous I'm done my devala the Bible said in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us in then while he was a sinner Adam died for her he could save us but he couldn't redeem her yeah even I'm seen y'all getting quiet of me I'd never did it Eve oh there was no repentance at that time Adam come see what I did and she persuaded him to do the very same act and so now they all caught the same attitude when God walks in the cool of the evening you took my one flesh in one spirit is that right she said Lord the circle Adam said Lord the woman you gave me she said Lord the serpent you gave me not one of them stood there says Father forgive me but what did God do he jumped to the jump if I could sit with he went immediately to the restoration he went immediately to restore them to cover them to protect them because he was a father our Father you understand me in the midst of all our wickedness God could catch us in the act if he really wanted to send you to hell he could take your life right then there are those who were right in the act with just their mouth declaring there was something like a God and God struck him dead right then worms eat them hmm but still his patience and love suffering is with his children whoo listen when seaweed not only that but you see our soul is a part of God that's the real you your soul is a part of God is that right and even in our fallen state yet it's the most great species of all species on earth is the man and then get him to connect with his maker he becomes a super man is that right oh we don't see that hallelujah but Hollywood knows that there really are Superman hallelujah they try to scientific find or demonize it or whatever the case may be but even mankind know we're supposed to be something greater than what we are hallelujah it's evident just you know the intellectual side of it amen how many ah scientists in our day can build a pyramid how many of them can make dyes that'll last for thousands of years nobody yet they say we're more intelligent and they were it's a lie I'd ever from a lot from hell is what it is those people were eight if you had to go see the pyramid in order to see the entire state building it and whatever was that little building a time put up there that looked like a little child's play tons because those tons every mile or so high well in the world y'all understand understand what I'm trying to say but understand what I'm saying I'm saying this how can you think your problem is so big that God cannot solve if I hell does this this bottleless is like to me give me some time with this though if I held this thing out for a long period of time at the Wow that which is likely comes heavy and begins to drop right but the moon the Stars the earth the Sun has been held in its place since the beginning of time way before then God has held it and not one thing has moved out of his place you understand me why cuz God can't get weak he's Almighty hello he's Almighty and if God can hold the Stars and the moon in place you think God can't fix it for you I'm trying to help your faith you gotta broaden your mind when it comes to God you were God to be strapped up into the little brain here it ain't gonna work hallelujah God is far bigger than your brain he's your father I call him a mastermind ah because these things that he's formed they declaring him the declaring his power declaring hallelujah you'll watch me get behind time but that Sun is gonna rise tick-tock ha you and I we're beautiful people you might not think so cuz you're not looking at the real me but we're beautiful people in the inside of us it's the greatest and the most beautiful thing ever and that's gone that's why it's important for us to dodge our own will in our own way if God Adam before the fall you know God can lead lit it can lead Adam after the fall all right I think one of the greatest men ever lived was Abraham and Abraham was a common man just like you and I was nothing special about Abraham but election God chose him he lived in a time and a day Amen that they were idol worshipers but only inside of Abraham was a seed term of God hallelujah you see what I'm saying that's why God don't care whether you're let me put his way I don't know how to say it I said God don't care but let me just say it in this manner there are those who have been prostitutes there have been doors who have been mongers and pervert us and all kinds of things and yet on the inside there's a seed gene of God and God looks at the seed and some point God will visit you like he did Jericho hallelujah Here I am locked up in the city and then don't even belong to Israel but God says she's a part of it is that right and God why took a harlot oh well no not only that God restore her to her position in a natural way because she belonged to the royal family I love this but when God told down the walls of Jericho he restored all the evidence that they haven't ever been a harlot if the Scriptures had not said it we would have never known it hallelujah but I want you to look that's what the blood does when the blood of Jesus strikes you when it rose a walk for you and then it kills and it's how all of your past not some of it all of it and you walk away from Jericho like a new creature in Christ mm-hmm we have no abilities of our own we can't impress God the greatest singers in the world whether it be gospel or whatever the case may be you can't impress God let me tell y'all something we don't really know what singing is until we get to heaven perfect pitch and all that stuff being able to sing without catching a breath [Laughter] never never weaning from it we know we don't do that is and when someone say you sing like an angel that's a real compliment y'all understand me see there's no abilities of our own you know it's even a preacher you know we think oh my god is that just just - I'm gonna tear it up just do it but you're not doing nothing when it comes to men - preaching preaching is not acting though a preacher may act you understand me but my point is if God ain't doing it it's all in vain hallelujah and at the end of the day no matter what he does how he raises his voice and I'm talking about myself that's not what God is in God is in his word I want to hear what he's saying we all love the emotional part but let me tell you something people that's not what you ought to follow you need to follow what's being said and if it's the Word of God that's what you follow your understanding amen you look at these things in you sometimes people than what I am so smart let me tell you like this that's what Moses taught I can deliver the children in Israel I'm gonna go down there and I'm a set that Egyptian straight and whenever you know because somebody done told me I'm gonna be the deliverer and I believe it they men so I'm a little put it in order and what do you know with a dead man every time you try to help God you end up with a dead man and guess who the dead man becomes you hello Moses now the dead man represents Mose you say what do you mean because from that day on Moses became a vagabond a fugitive of Egypt he was no long longer this great royal family and that's what that's what happens to you when you get in God's way you stumble and fall even though he was to be the deliverer he was opposed to wait god is that right but God will always turn that evil around for good why because on God's calendar he had a conference call he had a call for Moses that Moses wasn't there yet y'all understand me so God had a Egypt to kick Moses out so Moses could make the journey to the Sinai and when he got there God was waiting hmm you see a lot of time we are it will us it into places and us and into journeys we don't even know where we're going but God knows and at the end of the journey guess what I don't care how far he is how long it takes amen as long as at the end of the journey I meet God am i making sense he said well what do you mean I'm saying like Jacob Jacob was a thief he was shot is that right and you look in the scripture says that when he cheats his brother out of this birthright and you know he goes over there to his future father-in-law and he cheats his father-in-law and God blesses him an angel came and told Jacob how to treat how to trick his father-in-law I don't understand it but what I'm trying to tell you when you are a seed of God you're blessed you may not recognize it at the time that you are seat of God but when God sees you he sees himself he'll bless you in Egypt he'll bless you wherever you are amen because you are here he will protect her come on somebody you and I know I know I know I should have been dead the many times Satan tried to kill me but he couldn't because I didn't belong to him Satan is the one who kills his children and God saves his own his own hallelujah oh you said all those souls in hell it would have never been that way if Lucifer hadn't done what he did that right god kicks who out Lucifer and all of those angels that God created that followed Lucifer was ordained to do it hallelujah because they were created he never was a part in the beginning that's why Paul says unto us I think this Paul he said listen if they leave you they weren't part of you now people think round if they leave my church God ain't talking about no denominational Church God talk about if they lead the word you stay with the word but it didn't lead the word they never was a part of the word whatever people you did for their similar dive ain't got nothing to do with your stimuli even though it may occur in your simile Paul there's a little more deeper than that and he probably referring back to Lucifer is that right you sure what do you mean brother did not the Bible tells us in the book of Revelation come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sins so daddy can't be talking about leaving a church building my church system because he's calling you out of that he's leaving God mmm help me Jesus y'all understand me the only way that we can destroy Satan's working us is to render unto God a complete surrender that's the only thing that can destroy the works in the devil it was like Christ came in and I'm not gonna be long tonight but it was like Christ he was facing the greatest thing of his life and you know he had to be the lamb he can't open his mouth he had to keep his shot a man he had to he knew the pain he was gonna experience pain that was beyond anything ever I felt on the day of her own desert why coz thinking about the millions and trillions in part whatever you got it I don't know how many how many the young tree is I don't know but anyway that was to come that he had to die for and to think he felt all those blows for us those strikes and bruises were our sins the judgment of God being afflicted upon him think about that and he knew it and yet he the Bible said with joy he said his plane face like a flint ha because he knew the outcome he understood that was going to be a nation born without sex there was going to be a nation of people a special class of people that will come through his loins and when the devil Pierce him in his side who came out of his loins blood and water which was a type it meant of the bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah and the devil sent in the book of song who shall declare his generation who's gonna clear his G who's gonna declare his seed here we are Lord when the devil thought he had Jesus come to a stop hallelujah it was only just the beginning whew we almost happy in now the houses and thousands and thousands of children has come out of Christ who sits on the throne of God Jesus Christ and who sits on the throne of Christ the bride of Jesus Christ and as Jesus came out of God we came out of her eyes I was thinking about this the other day brother rich amen jesus said if you if you fable into little I would give you 10 cities cities and he doesn't even say how big the cities gonna be but let's supposing is just that in a natural that's wonderful too but think about if he gives me ten cities one two three four y'all understand me I'm counting so I gotta stop cuz we got more than ten in here but my point is that's like having a tree and each one of you is a universe and your soul is worth more 10,000 world's infant infinity is what it is because I will never stop existing hallelujah you know I don't know how to try to say what I'm saying but I'm gonna tell you something this thing is so great that when God you know you gotta be something's got to be wrong with you if you think that God created the earth and the earth only for habitation anybody seen heaven there's plenty up here and then happening heaven worlds and stars and Suns and moons and do you think God is doing all of that to be vain eyes have not seen nor ears heard God gives you the ability to create and you don't even use it hallelujah what is he giving you the ability to create form there's no creation after this oh I don't know let me say it like this the Bible said that God rested on the seventh day right he rested and the Bible said Joshua didn't fulfill that that day but there's coming another rest and what was that rest the Holy Ghost when you enter to the Holy Ghost you have now entered into your promised land am I making sense and what is your promised land Oh amen we realized that God said to Abraham I am your portion I'm not the screen brother I'm uh I am your portion I'm gonna give this a portion him a portion him up this one this preacher portion this preacher portion I give this preach preacher portion but don't you worry about what I've given you them I am your portion Oh somebody help me here oh thank about it if God says I am your portion somebody gonna have to scrape me off the floor I just fainted because I've just not been given the greatest thing ever and that's eternal life can you imagine and this is just a small teeny little piece of God that we see now how God good good God has been you have no idea what's awaiting you and the thing forever I'm gonna be with him eternally there's no dying no crying you can't you can't these are the bird brains that we have we came fathom what it is and you think that I'm gonna trade this for anything of this world hallelujah you see what do you see I'm seeing like like like Satan has Satan has his fashion Satan what they wear in hell is not what they wear in heaven that's why everybody's naked because they make it in hell hello you don't carry nothing you know you don't see God said well when you get to hell God Satan is gonna robe you with something you ain't got nothing naked you came into the world and they could you leave out only the believer is clothed with the character of Christ and because he's clothed with Christ he has a clothing - that's waiting on him yeah I remember now this whole thing started with being clothed and unclothed we were clothes and Satan unclothed them and what is he doing now he's still unclosing them but those who are in Christ keep themselves clothed you love the Lord he meant that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even where in him back to the point we must be in him hallelujah for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many what brethren you mean to tell me that Jesus is my brother and if he is my brother that means his daddy is mine you can't have two daddies you don't understand that the Godhead is so important because they want to make three cards there is no three gods may God hear when they say it just like you you got body soul and spirit hello but you'll never see me saying how you doing body body says though I'm doing okay and then what about two spirits Oh soul I didn't mean to forget you you know what they gonna take you and lock you up somewhere cuz you schizophrenic hallelujah but they say well who would Jesus got talking to and they don't understand John was the only one that saw the vision you know after all those people would have saw that dub coming down and saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased they would have fell down and worship or fainted but John was only one they'd seen it and they must understand that was a vision descending like a door like mmm and people don't understand that was truly the voice of God ah because Jesus was only the house of God like you are the house of God but he was born without sex about making sense all right I'm trying to hurry I'm trying to hurry you and I must understand by God's grace the only thing listen it takes a full surrendered heart to Jesus Christ no matter how he literally you are though a fool will not err in that way see so listen to listen closer now as you know what was not Abraham our Father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar right but you got to understand that the Bible says Abraham was justified by faith hallelujah the Bible said if you believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is the son of God you are saying how many I believe that a man you can't take that out of the world at that moment they're justified in their passed from death unto life the problem with us is that when God shows us more opening of the world if you fail to walk in it that's when death strikes you now right oh yeah the children of Israel came right out of out of Egypt amen and it was justified they escaped the Death Angel when they were in Egypt but when they got in the wilderness when it came to sanctification they did not they failed and because of that they died is that right Jesus said they are all dead right my our fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and Jesus said they're all dead go look it up that means eternally separated from God and that's what people said well we ain't got to look like that we ain't got to be sanctified yes you do if you're gonna go all the way to the fault the next stage and that's didn't feel complete with the Holy Spirit because God cannot put his spirit in it unclean vessel he won't do it I'm going on you love the Lord come on somebody you and I must understand that we are the General Assembly the Church of the firstborn right which are written in heaven huh your names are written in heaven you say brother please how could my name be written in heaven God put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world what do you mean was I there you were there when God said let there be light you were there you said that in Scripture yes it is the Bible said Levi paid tithes in Abraham where was Levi in Abraham two more generations down huh so what are you saying I was in God that's why I can return back to him hallelujah and by God he listen there's a part of me that's created this old flesh but when I get the Holy Ghost that's what I had with that's what I had with him before I became this Oh God give me the seal I had the seal sheets in broke the connection hallelujah Oh amen sin was the one that made us what we are but God said in the beginning there was a sore sowing seeds hallelujah there was a good so uh he put one in my heart he put what all of his children had his seed before they got here and the preaching of the word is like the blood cell breaking through the egg and causes life in you now when you hear the gospel you confess with your mouth believe in your heart now you have been been been conceived hallelujah you're not quite formed yet but your life in Christ is that right amen now you're forming up you're forming up your formula whatever tell you something you don't become a real baby Amen until you get Christ gives you full birth by blood water and spirit that were John said and these three agree in one you gotta have blood water experience justification safe occasion baptism of the Holy Ghost right and so when you come out hallelujah because all that that nine months you lived off your mama's life that right that's what we do we come in and we live off the church life hallelujah but that neighbor cord got to be cut so we can take our own breath so you gotta understand by God's grace that when you take your own breath that's why people must understand I can't own you know church can on you know preacher can on you know Bishop look nobody can own you you have been bought with a price and you're not your own you belong to Jesus Christ hallelujah Jesus Christ is your father he's your husband he's your Redeemer that's that's Isaiah 54 I gotta hurry up cuz I'm enjoying myself know ye not that your let me read that scripture I love that scripture turn almost to it right to it just about mm-hmm fifty four five for that maker is dying husband Oh your maker is your husband how can it be your husband lets you be like Eve on the inside of him Oh a man is that Ryan II was only inside an atom when she came to manifestation she was his why the Lord of Hosts is his name what that mean he had a lot of like Solomon plenty right and I Redeemer the Holy One of Israel the god of the whole earth shall he be called for the Lord have called me as a woman Forsaken and grieved in spirit and a wife of youth when thou was refused said their Lord in a small moment I have forsaken thee but we're great with great mercies will I gather thee is that right you said brother looks at it you know what I had done read this Bible many a time but one day my wife and I was at a gas station and this man came up to me with prophecy and he gave me that scripted that was one of them that he gave me and saying God told me to give this scripture to you well why was with me hmm what was the other one brother now there 57 no weapons formed against you shall prosper no oh brother that's core is it in a is a good core isn't it I'm already I'm about ready to close what am i trying to tell you I'm trying to tell you that listen I heard that brother Torah preached some good messages and every one of us ought to be stirred enough to prove him wrong I don't even know what he preached but I heard it was a hot one oh thank God told us I'm glad I wasn't there I was just kidding my point is this your success in becoming a true son or daughter of God is hindered upon your faith to believe which you come from if Satan can cause you to doubt and disbelieve that you came from God he's definitely proven to you you're thinking like him because even though God was the creator of all things Satan thought he was on his own God he had his own origin so therefore he could do what he wanted wanted to do but for us who know we I don't know about you I I depend on him I'm not seeking something else other than eternal life that's all I want I didn't give myself a thirst for eternal life I didn't give myself to know God hallelujah and you and I ought to be so we ought to see how blessed we are that God didn't allow us to be worshipping Buddha or Allah he brought us into truth and this truth is vindicated by his old life hallelujah we're not sitting around kissing statue feet and all this kind of stuff we are serving a living God and I so thank God I don't understand it other than he knows my name he knew me before I knew me hallelujah and he chose us what I was saying in understanding what I was saying with brother when I say prove him wrong because God gave him the words to speak and if God gave him words of correction we must love the correction hallelujah because let me say like this every true seed of God will correct themselves how do you yourself brother book repentance that's all you can do God I'm wrong you're right and in closing I'm saying this when God is right and you acknowledge he's right he was then direct your path like I said down there the church I said how can you die anybody know how to you die how do you die tell me is there an instruction book to tell you how to die but God said we must you must die you must rock to yourself rock to your ideas rot rot rot because every seed before it could ever bring forth life it must die and rot go dig it up in the Nile you find out that every seed that's planted because you don't even you can't even see the life that's in the seed until it manifests itself after you rock and that's what it is we got to die to ourselves down to our wheel die to our habits and so a Lord how do I do it I tell you where you first start prayer Jesus as a man said father I would that you this copy pass away from me nevertheless not my will our Father that will be done in earth nevertheless not my will and he kept praying he kept praying he kept praying he got up one time he says could not y'all stay with me for an hour god what's happening with you don't you know the pressure and the squeeze is on and y'all over here sleeping when y'all to be praying with me and then at the while he come back a second time it says sleep on because now the consequences of your not praying will now be made manifest and then when they came when the soldiers came guess what instead of them staying with Jesus they all scatter the only person that stayed with Jesus was John and John was the type of the bride hallelujah help me Jesus so you and I realize amen hmm we're being born of uncorruptible seed born of God is to be born of uncorruptible that means it cannot be rubbed it through the world or do the things that Satan put on you it cannot be corrupted hallelujah it can't be habbit eyes you can't mix you with nothing faith cannot be mixed with anything not real faith I'm jumping job said in 35 35 10 but none said where is God my maker who give his song anybody know what I'm talking about how many times they've been you've been so down and God comes and only starts singing all over him to you and you don't even want to sing that song because you're saying I don't feel nearer and God is trying to say but that's what I'm saying it so you can get nearer listened gotta make your radio you hear sounds from heaven and you think it's coming from your mind it's coming in your mind I don't mean to laugh I'm serious folks you know it is true it's so true we we miss God by what we miss God we do too much process one thing I learned about my mom you don't hurt her heard me talk about her my mama didn't have enough education she didn't even know how to reason I'm sure she did but she probably didn't know that's what she was doing my point is she just knew whatever I heard the preacher say I believe it the Holy Ghost in church no matter had to beat her up she heard the word her faith call the whole of it and God filled her right there in a Baptist Church God don't care where you get the Holy Ghost as long as the temperatures right but don't you think no air gonna hatch if the church is dead and cold hallelujah that's why I scream out all the time about having this temperature right in this church we got young people that's coming up and they gonna need the Holy Ghost if they tear it God tarry long enough hey Church the you know you can't be a Frigidaire that's what people say the Church of the Frigidaire up I don't want this church to be like that or the Church of the frozen Chosin no sir there's got to be movement here they've got to be action in here these children gotta learn how to love God and if they don't see you loving them how you love God coz they learning through us y'all understand me somebody is always watching you oh wait I'm almost done I'm just gonna cut it short whereas not sure but whoever cut it I get really I don't mean this sound playfully to put it I'm just happy all I can tell you I do think about my salvation I don't worry if I'm saved or not that's not when I worry about I I want to hear well done you understand me I want to hear well done and I don't mean no harm I don't want to be one that called oh I barely made it I don't want to be a bear to make it you understand me the Bible said we're going to have reward there be some rewards that works that'll be burnt and all that I don't want my work to be burned everything I do I want to do it for Christ I don't want to be somewhere well I think I can do something I think I can help him no sir that's exactly what that man did when he grabbed that Ark he thought he could help David and he had no business grabbing the ark I don't care if it was falling that wasn't his position the Word of God said don't touch it and that's what God means don't touch it and you and I must understand him and the best thing we can do is to get on our knees somewhere somehow and pray to God take you to the next level he waiting on us he said well it's so difficult do you think at this day at a time the devil is gonna make it easy for you well brother books I just get so tired I get so sleepy and I get this net any other that's just a sign that you've got a devil working on the outside on the other side of you trying to keep you from your goal hallelujah sometimes you don't even know where else to say but just say Jesus he knows what's in your heart you don't know where to say like them like the men say if you don't know how to pray just pray abcdefg and God to know exactly what you're talking about he's God but we gotta persevere people I'm telling you it's true I'm not just talking to you or above you I'm saying this man gotta pray more I didn't already spoke to my heart and he's speaking to yours you want to see the supernatural occur you want to see that little room come to pass in your life where me and comes in there amen and walk out hold lame and blind and halt and what is going to happen that's people people don't understand anything or some great man is gonna raise up the greater man then calming down right now God is trying to get the people in their closet he alone will make this move there won't be another see more or something you know one of the seven angels are finished now we're now with Joshua we're with the pillar fire we're with God himself he's the one that's gonna make the next move oh lord help us Jesus and you and I know the Bible said whatever if you pray in a clowder you pray and secretly God will manifest himself so others can see I believe that with all my heart but you and I know most of us prayer Satan hates it and he's going to do everything he can you know what he works with feeling who said you had to feel them do y'all feel me I'm talking you do you feel the anointing y'all understand what I'm trying to say I'm talking to you but you can hear me right that's all you want to do let me hear him when I speak I won't even speak back whether I feel anything or not I want to know he's dead it ain't based upon feeling that's pillow costume and where we're supposed to be good beyond the childishness of that now like there's something wrong with it because we're Pentecostal but we supposed to be a mature Pentecostal and I'm not talking about a church denomination I'm talking about way of experience you can't get to heaven without a Holy Ghost experience right you love the Lord let's stand I wanna I really want to preach more on this our Father because we need to know who our Father is Alleluia once you know more about your father it gives you some prior to being who you are hello did not the Bible said we are citizens of heaven we have a kingdom that cannot be moved Paul said oh this earthly Tabernacle be the SOB I got a building devil and we so worried about this okay hallelujah you got him stay this thing is dying from like I heard a brother say this thing is dying from the moment you take your first breath we were born into death hallelujah Oh like I said many times I never knew what it meant for an old person to get up out of that chair you know they get up I better be careful how far I'll go down and let got complete victory because sometimes getting up out of that chair in especially if you not accompany with pain young people eh I told some friends of mine just tell that's a y'all better enjoy that you I say because when that age come don't you know Amen they talk about the pains of death how many y'all experienced in it oh yeah you're already experiencing the pain that come with death as you grow older you can't do what you want to do oh my goodness and you know something can be that much off the phone you trip over it because you can't lift your feet as hot you and I must understand that we have a greater hope we have also love God because God didn't play with us he didn't he didn't roll dice he didn't do checkers or in it he didn't do nothing like that and make this miss salvation by a chance I'm so grateful he did not make it by chance oh you got a chance to make help make ever no sir no ma'am this is not a chance this is predestination this is election this is by God's choosing well if God gonna just choose you listen God knew who you were gonna choose I don't understand it all but I do know one thing as I said today you didn't find Christ Christ found on you he knew where you were Adam we're out there and you think God didn't know where Adam or he wanted Adam to respond because it's when God asks you where you are you ought to know where you are right amen and when Adam when God responded and I love it like I said I hope you understood what I was saying about brother Troy's meaning preaching because I love brother Troy preaching I haven't heard it yet but I will but my point is when God was talking to you today or talking with you on Wednesday amen and I'm gonna tell you something I gotta listen cuz I gotta get mine too but my point is is imma imma gonna I'm tryin to tell you this is the attitude we want everybody to take we want you to say thank you Jesus so somebody sent me one of those things they said this man this person has seven years to continue to be six seven years I think it was and it's a long story but this bird was going to heaven he says ask the Lord why you know how long that I must take sick like this and the bird came back to Doug and said he told me that you have to be you got six seven years to go seven more years to go he said but but each day I want you to say thank you Lord and he said that those seven years turn into seven days because he every time he woke up no matter what kind of pain he felt no matter how it looked amen to him he said thank you Jesus thank you Lord oh Lord I just so thank you for every moment I have here and what I'm going through like right now I thank you Jesus hallelujah yes see that's what we fail to do the Bible said in all things give things because you know God is the one who's leading us God predestinated us he chose our battles for us right I just had a daughter a friend of mine who lost her daddy who never was a daddy to him/her and you know and I shared a few things with her and I said you know what God told me he said the daddy that you didn't have I am he now I'm gonna be the father that you so long for hallelujah if I had to make a choice I'd rather him than the other one that's going on you understand no offense but if I have been predestined ordained to pass a test I want to pass it with our hundred if I can get an A+ brother I want a plus hallelujah and don't tell me Amen those disciples amen had a different Holy Ghost no they didn't some of them Amen they hadn't you think there was some Superman they were only super because the Super God was him right but that's the kind of Holy Ghost I want to have that I can go to a chopping block and call out the devil said hey I'm laughing - you think you killing me but you see I have an eternal life I cannot die hmm Paul said I'll tell you what I want to stay back here this long for the Jews but if it was up to me I would have been gone a long time ago yeah that was Paul attitude but you see when you start thinking God he's short indeed he's short new trials he's shortened amen everything that you're going through when you begin to really praise the Lord you know I praise God for victories I haven't even seen yet huh thank you Jesus for saving all of my children that's what I do sometimes they'd ever try to make me think otherwise has no sir God gave me a promise and Abraham was able to call those things that be not as though they were and I'm Abraham see I don't have to see it to believe it I believe God's Word is sure alright they love the Lord me seeing how sweet [Music] yeah anybody want prayer anybody in here amen need anything from God I was well but but I
