[0:00] in their own way of thinking
[0:03] they had their own theology
[0:08] he means what he says and he says what
[0:09] he means
[0:12] and really if the people would have been
[0:14] in a place to search the scripture
[0:18] they would have come to knowledge or to
[0:20] know
[0:21] who christ was this is why jesus told
[0:24] them to search the scripture
[0:26] for in them you think you have eternal
[0:28] life
[0:30] but there was also another variable that
[0:32] that that laid in the scripture
[0:35] and that was god said that they would be
[0:38] blinded
[0:39] and so they could not see
[0:44] not that god made them blind but he saw
[0:46] their decisions
[0:48] he saw what they would do when the word
[0:51] would come
[0:53] and because of their pride and arrogance
[0:56] jesus had to say them say to them
[0:59] because you
[1:00] say you see your sins remain
[1:05] but we find that in that day only a few
[1:07] people came to know who he was
[1:10] his disciples walked with him three and
[1:12] a half years and
[1:14] didn't truly understand who he was until
[1:17] one day jesus
[1:18] brought a question to them all who do
[1:21] men say i
[1:22] the son of man am and we know the story
[1:26] he directed to peter and he said unto
[1:30] peter who do you say that i am
[1:32] and he said some say that thou john the
[1:34] baptist some say you're jeremiah
[1:36] zechariah one of the other prophets
[1:38] but jesus said who do you say that i am
[1:43] because we must realize that not only
[1:45] was jesus christ the messiah but he was
[1:47] also the seventh seal of his day
[1:50] of the old testament and that seal was
[1:53] broken
[1:54] and when that seal was broken not only
[1:57] was there a new message that was given
[1:59] to paul
[2:01] but there was also a resurrection that
[2:03] took place
[2:04] at that time nobody knew about it
[2:08] only those whom god revealed himself
[2:11] to because on the day of his
[2:14] resurrection
[2:15] we find out that those who resurrected
[2:18] with him
[2:19] appeared to about 500 or more
[2:23] and even so out of that 500 there was
[2:26] only 120
[2:28] in the upper room so sometimes people
[2:31] see
[2:31] supernatural and even the supernatural
[2:34] can't bring about a conversion
[2:37] this is what i love about the message
[2:39] because we realize by god's grace
[2:42] that what is now has already happened
[2:46] nothing is new under the sun god dealt
[2:49] with israel
[2:50] and in the same like manner
