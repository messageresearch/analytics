so our brother can have his way or let god have his way out brother simon amen did y'all enjoy this morning amen i did too yesterday as well and i'm expecting a big steak again we're gonna ask our brother to come we know it's not him it's the holy spirit [Music] outpouring whatever he needs i pray that god will do that for him just because he came to see this little flock in jesus christ's name let's thank god for our precious brother amen amen good terms ah my size service again oh here i feel at home again now hey praise the lord now lord will we're just gonna dive into a little subject i thought the lord gave us to me about i was praying in between services like little rodeo i'm gonna go i was looking at this one look at this this is and then my i don't know i just felt comfortable right here so i hope this will be a blessing to you um because that's what we we just want to be a blessing we want to be edifying uh that's the main thing is even if we got one extra nugget to you then that's that's what we came to do if you're strengthened just a little bit you felt like you've got a blessing that's what you want to do so um tonight let's turn into the word of god in exodus 30 i'm gonna have uh one two we're gonna do a little bit of uh scriptures here just about five or six maybe and then we'll get into it okay i hope this is a blessing there's i taught this in akron and one brother said brother can i believe that i have that whole study i said sure so i sent it to him that was encouraging so it's uh if we could let's turn to exodus 34 verse one uh there i i i i was i was listening to service to the i was like to the message of the hour and uh something the prophet said just struck me and i was like and i just started thinking about all the scriptures and uh what was the point you know because god doesn't do anything for no reason there's always a specific reason he puts things in the scripture and there's always a specific reason why he does a certain thing and uh when i saw this i was like oh i just need to teach this and i don't know if the people have known it before or not and but anyhow we want to reiterate this by the grace of god in exodus 34 verse 1. excuse me and the lord said unto moses hew the two tables are spun a stone likened to the first and i will write upon these tables the words which were in the first tables which thou breaketh so here is god now same boys he said he said moses you broke the ten commandments the original section he said makes two more he says and i'll write it again all right he's gonna rewrite now go to first corinthians 14 as i've teach things you know and and i trust me i'm 90 time i'm i'm sitting right in those seats too as well so and as you sit there and hear the word or or maybe as i teach this it just becomes more and more alive every time and just uh it it it's just amazing to see that there is a book out there that's actually alive it's actually a spirit book right this is a spiritual mystery book hiding everything we need is right in here i heard a brother tell me he says ye he said brother did you ever think about how if we could look into heaven right now and i was like and i'm thinking you know you know i was thinking yeah he said brother just go like this and then this here we can actually get this is like a window of heaven and to look into there you have to do this so just look into your word and you're actually now seeing into the spiritual into the heaven and you can actually dive in there and leave this world for a little bit and see what all's involved what just by reading the word of god amen sorry for that first corinthians 14 i don't want to hold you too long they're standing first corinthians 14 verse 36 now look what paul's writing here he says what came what came the word of god out from you or came it unto you only if any man think himself to be a prophet or even spiritual he says let him acknowledge that the things that i write notice paul's now writing these things by the inspiration holy ghost the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord amen so here now god has written first and now god is writing through a man right now go to revelations 1. sorry i was getting the nerves back there as standard um but now that i see it's a small crowd i'm calming calming calming coming so that's what we need right there um revelations 1 verse 10. uh you know let's uh yeah yeah verse 10. notice saint john he says i was in the spirit that's capital s holy ghost in the anointing he was just in the in christ i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice out of a trumpet saying i am the alpha the omega the first and last and what thou see is he says right in a book so now here john god is using john now to write and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia ephesus smyrna pergamus the tiger sardius uh philadelphia and unto obviously laodicea and i just jumped that scripture sorry now let's continue on here in verse 19 write the things which thou has seen and things which are and the things which shall be here after so here once again he's commanded to write one more scripture go to genesis 1 1. to me this this study right here is a fantastic and no interpreter so i can just kind of go at my pace brother did a fantastic job today god bless you and i hope i didn't do anything wrong or get out of speed or you know i'm a different kind of guy i admit that so in genesis 1 here verse 1. in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth so say a word of prayer dear heavenly father lord jesus we just love you and lord we come humbly lord once again lord i not sure why i'm standing behind this pulpit here lord but lord you have ordained it and lord we just want to be edifying lord and lord may you speak once again lord and lord lord these i didn't make up this study lord you just gave this little study to me god lord i just prayed a blessing lord to the people god and lord may just give them strength lord and greater understanding in the knowledge of jesus christ and lord god we want to and lord we lord we're dealing with every day we run into heathens god and lord the unsaved the lost and lord and lord if you allow us to strike a conversation in order and and in every person lord that you know you know i've met lord and we've struck a conversation and we try and push it towards the word and we start talking the word of god lord you lord and lord jesus lord they always have a spiritual question even the most heathen foul mouth they always wonder why this scripturally why this scripture why did god do this and why and lord we want to have an answer for everything so let me just pray you bless this study god may be edifying in the name of jesus christ amen you may have your seats so i if i had a title it would be can you write good to see the young bell boys back there all grown up man it's strange it's like sister angie's sitting with strangers to me to me wow who are these guys and they've grown up to be fine young men and may god bless you guys appreciate seeing you and that's kind of hard you know you see familiar and and you know as i come back and see brother brooks he doesn't aged at all actually his sister angie has an age brother keith looks just the same and but these two look different and here they're they're ages catching up with them they're getting older and they maturing into you know i don't know it's kind of it's like reverse age maybe so uh anyhow god bless you guys i really really appreciate you um especially coming to the house of god hearing the word of god and i want this to be a blessing to you and you guys are the youth here's youth and coming up and very exciting to meet you gentlemen and brothers it's really been a blessing to see that so here in genesis 1 1 it says in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and i think myself you know i i used to in fact i used to teach the godhead wrong for about 10 years and then brother cam said brother you know he started investigating the message looking into it and i i thought it wrong just the smidge just wrong and i took correction i said absolutely and now that we're teaching things correct more and more and precise uh more correct uh what was in genesis 1 1 what god what was god doing here in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth he said he created the heavens first and then the earth second and what was he doing he was writing his story he was writing the word of god we get down to the natural which we can see with our visual eyes and at night time you can look at the constellations and all those things and the prophet of god he says that's the bible written up there and then in the daytime we see the sun and the moon chase each other and those sort of things and we see the birds in the air we talked uh last night on how how nature teaches and god actually wrote the scripture he wrote the salvation plan in nature he wrote all that stuff in nature and i've always wanted to understand it a little bit deeper and by the grace of god hopefully we'll be able to get a little bit deeper in that but it says in the beginning god created heaven's ears did you know that before uh genesis 1 1 we know that he was just god right he was like he wasn't god because we know that god is an object of worship we've heard these things uh many many hundreds and hundreds and hundreds maybe thousands of times right so before he was god he was elohim just self-existing and in his attributes we know that he wanted to be healer he wanted to be provider he wanted to be all those things to his children right but he also wanted to be a father he also want to be a creator he also wanted to be a sal he wanted to be a savior so even before he was god even before the creation come forth something had to come out of him and that was the logos right and we know that that was a light body a word body correct and so now and if i would draw it when i teach it i draw it because i'll be honest the lord told me to join a certain organization uh it's business and i and i said lord why do you want me to join and i just kept showing it showing and i said fine i'll join up and start selling this and this and this and whatever so then sure enough i i was i was i'm like i didn't want to be there so i started i fishing automatically so i'll either kick me out or i'm going to catch fish right so sure enough two guys started getting interested in the word of god and i started every sunday night i'd drive after service drive to toledo do bible studies to one o'clock in the morning and drive home and we were stuck on baptism for for two months they could not get it through that denominational training that the baptism the father's holy ghost is the lord jesus christ and then once god broke forth and through that barrier then i started moving to godhead because they're one insane they're connected in fact that's how they teach trinity is through matthew 28 19. but that's not dealing with the godhead that's dealing with the baptism and then now as i'm dealing with godhead they said brother i i and so i had to draw it out and what i did i drew a big g but i did dots to show that it was invisible right and then i drew the pillar of fire and i said notice this is the invisible father that's the father and out then he spoke with that pillar of fire right and then then that invisible g that invisible god had to go and dwell within that pillar of fire right and now that's that's the father in enveloping himself dwelling in the sun right and then once i drew it they're like don't touch that white board leave it right there i said yes sir because i was in their house their apartment and they looked at that thing and finally they came to believe in the godhead one person because you could you could draw it out you could explain it they could not imagine or put it together in their mind so i actually just had to do a simple drawing and that changed them right there am i so that's what what i do so you know the father is the person the invisible the eternal right and the bible says here in john 5 and 19 then jesus answered and said to him barely very i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things so ever he doeth these also do with the son likewise right and then he says for the father loveth the son jesus the image the expressed image of god said the father that father that one is dwelling in me he said he loves me he loves the son oh yes absolutely i'm going to show you how much he does love the sun now if we could now i don't know how long i'll be tonight but we're just going to we're just going to teach this by the grace of god if we turn if not now we're going to go you guys got this okay so in hebrews 1 now saint paul is the in hebrews 1 saint paul dials and he dials in he brings forth a fresh revelation on the godhead the expressed image of god right and then he's able to pull from the old testament something in hebrews 1 7 it says and of the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire but now in verse 8 he pulls from old testament but under the sun he saith now notice god the father is speaking now to the son thy throne o god is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness in the scepter of thy kingdom thou has love righteousness he says and hated and he's talking about the image of god absolutely he's talking of what jesus christ and flesh absolutely he says he says uh uh he said therefore god even thy god hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows why because he was the anointed one he was the messiah he was he was exactly what was prophesied all the way back in genesis 3 right he said sure now he says and thou lord in the beginning has laid the foundations of the earth so back in genesis 1 1 in the beginning god created that was the father and the son bringing forth the creation of god right so here now notice now notice god is now in the sun in genesis 1 and that light with god in it that light that logos with god in it is now creating everything and writing the scriptural bible right sure he says in the beginning thou has laid the foundation the earth and the heavens are the work of thine hands they shall perish he says but thou remained that's why that goes all the way back to matthew 24 he says he says heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass away amen yes sir he says but thou remaineth he says and they all shall wax as old as doth the garment he says in a vesture thou shall fold them up and they shall be changed he says but thou art the same amen he says and for thy years they shall not fail amen that is the son that is the word of god but now remember mo paul actually pulled this from the old testament now i want to show you something and where did he pull that for him he pulled that from psalms 45. now as we go back to four psalms 45 let's turn to verse 1 there psalms 45 verse 1 now look how this is written now remember the bible says all scripture is given by the inspiration of of the holy ghost or god himself right now look what is writing here he says to the chief musician the son of the musician upon i can't remember i can't even speak that for the the sons of kora uh mashiel he says a song of loves he says my heart is indicting did you notice how the holy ghost says my heart is indicting a good matter he says i speak of the things which i have made touching the king my tongue is the pen of a ready writer now that word indicting let me break this down you know that word indicting it means boil is over a bubble is over it means to properly to boil over as a fountain he says and the idea here is the heart boiled over with emotions of love he said it was full and overflowing it found expression in the words of this song in fact this is the only place in the bible this word in hebrew indicting is found and this is god speaking of what in verse 2 verse 3 verse 4 5 and 6 it picks up in here in verse 6 he's talking about the son god is overjoyed he's bubbling up he's so excited about what his son is going to do he's so excited what the image he's going to bring forth and mary is going to do he's trying to express something and the father loveth the son amen sure now let's continue on now why does the father loveth the son in john 8 28 then he saith then said jesus unto him when ye have lifted up the son of man then shall you know that i am he and that i can do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me i speak these things and he that has sent with me has sent me is with me the father has not left me alone he says for i always do the things that please him why the logos he was the word and that word was perfect there's no fault in it it's perfect and god loved it because when that word was made manifest it did exactly it stayed with himself i'll say it like that sure amen now moving on here in psalms 90 verse 1 a prayer of moses the man of god his lord thou has been our dwelling place in all generations before the mountains were brought forth or ever before thou thou has formed the earth sorry form the earth in the world even from everlasting to have lasting he says thou art god was showing what the god the logos was all the way in the beginning sure then in micah in 5 and verse 2 now this is a prophecy of where the messiah would be born correct he says but thou bethlehem ephra he says though thou be little among the thousands of judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is of to be a ruler in israel right so what the messiah would come out of bethlehem but notice whose goings forth have been from old and everlasting it was the same god all the time the same logos that son was with god in the beginning sure absolutely identifying just exactly now in corinthians i'm sorry colossians 1 15 he says who is the image of the invisible god right we know that's so that we can be he could he could he could touch and taste and feel do all those things right and he was the image on the the invisible god this is a hand-picked body this is a hand made body of god the firstborn of every creature this is god's personal body this is how he wanted to be made manifest he says but for by him were all things created that is in heaven that on earth there it is genesis 1 1 visible and invisible whether they be thrones and or dominions or principalities or powers all things are created by him and form and he is before all things and by him all things consist amen now uh i don't know how brother brooks teaches the logos but me and my pastor back home we were examining these scriptures and to me this looks like logos to me this looks like something that was uh specifically put here now in proverbs 8 and verse 20. to me this is logos to me this is exactly what god was jesus christ was he says i lead in the way of righteousness in the middle of the paths of judgment that i may cause those that love me to inherit substance and the bible says faith is a substance oh my we want more faith absolutely why because we're going to need that rapturing faith to make it out of here amen that's the substance i want right there and the of course the holy ghost himself more and more he says that i might cause those that love me to inherit substance and i will fill their treasures now look the lord possessed me in the beginning of my way could this be now remember in in a lot of psalms and a lot of proverbs a lot of the old testament sometimes it was god i was like this god god would actually uh speak through them right the they said in the old testament or in the new testament that a lot of times the prophets were anointed by what the spirit of christ absolutely and now here we see exactly the logos now bringing forth the word himself the lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old i was set up from everlasting from the beginning or ever the earth was when there were no depths i was brought forth what out of god came the low god said now hear the word jesus is now speaking he says i've come out of god he says when there are no fountains abounding with water before the the mountains were settled before the hills i was i brought forth amen to me that looks like logos to me that looks like the sun before it was flesh to me looks like the word of god amen well as yet he was not made he had not made the earth he said no the fields nor the highest part of just the earth when he prepared the heavens he says i was there when he set a compass upon the face of the deep he says when he established the crowd the clouds above when he strengthened the fountains with of the deep when he had when he gave to the sea his decree that the water should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundation the earth he says then i was by him as one brought up with him what the almighty invisible god wanted to be a father and that logos was a son to him amen and i was daily his delight rejoicing always before that light would just dance and jump and it was living and and god didn't just love to be in the center of worship amen sure rejoicing in the habitable part of the earth and then verse 35 for whosoever findeth me findeth life remember the old time the old tabernacle what the jesus said i am the way the truth holy place and the life holiest of holies that whole thing was him and inside of that body was life why that's why that blood had to be shed because in that blood was the very life that we sent on you and me amen to fill us and to live through us amen yes now you may already know these things but it says in john 1 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and then of course in genesis 1 1 i want to go back there in the beginning god created the heavens the earth now let me ask you a question why was there two realms why did god create the heaven and the earth why didn't he just stick with the heaven why didn't he just have that tabernacle in heaven and this and that and just set up everything and just leave it like that but he actually had to create another realm another world why did he do that you may know already know these things or however but and i come to the to the thought to why you know i thought about the devil one day and i thought man can he be saved can the devil be saved is there a redemption is there a chance is there a loophole no that's right why because in the word of god redemption salvation can only come through blood and that blood has to come through death and the bible says that satan is a spirit a chariot of anointed cherub right and if satan is a spirit that would mean a spirit would have to die for him and since god is eternal he cannot die there is absolutely no salvation for the devil or any of the demons absolutely that's just that simple so now but that's where the beauty of it is why didn't he just leave us up in heaven why didn't he just leave a spirit people because he had to write a story notice we did not fall adam did not fall up there but god had to send him and sent that soul that seed life into a flesh and then when that flesh that seed entered that flesh and then satan contempted eve and adam and all those things it's like this when satan could tap adam because it was adam before you she didn't receive a name changed to after so then after thou thou that now that that seed that seed life the children of god took a fall it was in the flesh now now that's where god set the stage everything had to be a stage right there right everything was set in fact let me show you something here do you know in revelations 20 and i verse i came about 10 or 11. it said that that those that make the first resurrection are blessed and holy right and then if you jump now where did they get their blessedness where'd they get their holiness why are they blessed and holy here then in revelation sorry in matthew 25 dealing with those that come up in the great general resurrection those on the right and those on the left we find those that are on the right the ones that are counted as sheep he says those are blessed as well where'd they get their blessing but then we see those on the left where where did they get their cursing you know god set a stage everything is planned out it's fully let's go to genesis 1. you know god knew exactly what he was doing this thing so elected so set everything stacked in our favor we just have to enjoy salvation we have to joy we just have to yield here amen now look here in the in the fifth day genesis 1 verse 20. and god said let the waters bring forth abundantly and the moving creature that has life the fowl that that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven the god created great whales and every living creature and moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and every winged fowl after his kind and god saw that it was good so god created the birds the fish the whales all those things but notice in verse 22 and god blessed them was a blessing and placed upon the fish and the birds blessed but known as to the sixth day in verse 24 and god said let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping things and the beasts of the earth are of his kind and it was so and god made the beast of the earth after his kind and the cattle there were after their kind and everything that creepeth upon the earth that after this kind and god saw that it was good notice he did not say it was good because it would have spoken it would have to stay good but here he says and god saw that it was good and notice no blessing put upon it he blessed the fish he blessed the birds but there was no blessing put on animal life do you know where we're going with that god could not bless animal life because he knew animal life would take part in the fall and god had to leave a space where he could curse something he could not bless animal life because there was a curse waiting coming forth in genesis 1 and 20 and god said let us make man after our image right in verse 28 and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply right there is where the blessing is once something is blessed god could not erase it that's where those in the bride get their blessing and holy they get the holy from the holy ghost but they get the blessing all the way back here in genesis and in matthew 25 that's where those on the right hand get their blessing it was already blessed the stage was set the book was written the names were already written up there was done and sealed eternal so why does the why is the sun the word of god so important that logan's so important and remember the topic is can you write i was just kind of setting this foundation there is that all right i'm in construction that's just what we do now in exodus 3 verse 1 because there's always a reason for something there's only god does everything for a reason in genesis 3 verse 1 now moses kept the flock of jethro his father-in-law the priest the minion and he led the flock to the backside of the desert that was a predestinated move why because what at that point at that moment in time the pillar of fire come down and reveal himself why did the father appear with the son why was the logos why was that pillar of fire there why not before why not why not and maybe in genesis where enoch and noah and this that but the pillar of fire appeared right then the pillar of fire when it appears it signifies something when god appears with the sun something big is going to take place something big is going to happen like what do you think we're expecting right now we're expecting another appearance of the pillar of fire i believe brother isaiah when he first come into the move of what we call the the word of god or the message they saw it in their tent meetings i believe he said he couldn't even move a reverence a fear holy fear holy reverence no one could move and then when it left he said somebody said did you all see that the pillar of fire appeared again something's going to happen now notice as the pillar of fire appears here to moses notice as he's in the presence of god the presence of god says cover it he says take off your feet because you're on holy ground right and then we find not only does he do that and obey that because now remember the living creatures that were up there they had six wings right flying and and the other ones closed their face the other one's head they hid their feet right and we know that's humility and all those things reverence and all those things to what holy god and we see that as god commands moses to to take up his take off his shoes or sandals or however the bible says in verse 6 and moses hid his face as well for he's afraid to look upon god this is a holy god reverend i'm talking deadly sincere reverence right here this is now the very creator of heaven come down to meet his people but he came in pillar of fire why he says now the influence of 64 it's like moses in his presence taking all his shoes uncovered his feet see set one of uh see the one over on his feet covered meant humility watched the servant now before god his face covered in reverence his feet covered humility yes be conscious to be very conscious of your little ones of how little you are he says you want to see how little we are he says put your finger in a in a pan of water and see if that hole remains where you put your finger because he said he says he says he's god really truly doesn't need us he says but we need him you know you can have a gifting calling in your life but if you refuse it god will move to somewhere else that's what we're just trying to yield and everyone wants to find their position we must find our positions what gifts lay in your life what gives what other gifts lay in my life we have to find what we need amen and god help us amen he says now he says humble yourself see how little you can be but not what you know not what you don't know let yourself get humble before god and one of the greatest things we can do is master human ability well brother keith you sure can pray and you can do this and do that and brother keith has to set that aside and say lord i am completely helpless lord what do you want me to do lord use this vessel if moses was called and he had six what six weaknesses and god could still use him to do that what more can he do with us and that was under the covenant of what a bulls and ghosts but now we're in the covenant of the holy ghost god the prophet said it only takes it takes if god can get one man under his control fully yielded he said he'd have another move one man another the other portion he said he said wherever a divine healing a major divine healing is it'll spark a revival if we can just get beside ourselves and really just yield and hear the voice of god and move amen god help us now what was what was the logos doing there when the logos appeared with the father and moses what was it saying because the word that light was the word of god and when the logos appeared and came down that pillar fire it showed that there was a word coming and what after directly after this we know the process of bringing them out of egypt and all those things and god sent them into the desert he had to go into dry places he had to come in to dry this and dry that where there's nothing but we can only depend on god but the pillar of fire signified that there was a word coming now notice what what now since there was a word coming god in his foreknowledge he knew it was coming as well god had ten major plagues and he just destroyed egypt left it in ruins the greatest nation the greatest king of his time but notice in galatians 3 verse 19 wherefore then serveth the law or sir wherefore then serve the law it was added because of transgressions god did not give them a law until they went off the word they had the prophet of god remember the logos was the word and that signified that god knew before anything before anything that they were going to fall and he they were going to need a word of god and that word of god would point them to salvation don't do this don't do that and you'll live but if you do this you're a dead man sure and god wrote the ten commandments he wrote the statutes the judgments all those things the ordinances correct now so we see that god had to send a prophet to the desert and then at the as the prophet was in the desert the pillar of fire would show up and it signified there was a great move coming and the word of god was going to be brought forth now we know about luther right luther was a powerful man of god and they say he was the great reformer but you know there was another reform reformation in the bible in hebrews 9 and verse 10 saint paul is diving now in the old testament led by the holy ghost to write and to bring forth the shadows and types showing exactly what it was in hebrews 9 and verse 10 he's dealing now with the the the way the priests handled the the sacrifice uh it says which stood only in meats and drinks and divers washing and cardinal carnal ordinances imposing on them until the time of the reformation see so what was what is the true reformation the true reformation is moving from law to grace and that was through jesus christ the great capital g capital r reformer amen luther was a smaller version but the time of the reformation when things changed but remember what took that it took the holy ghost the pillar of fire to come down once again on the son of god right now and what did that prove what did that produce it produced the book of acts correct sure now and what was the book of acts the prophet said he says and god was tearing loose and pulling apart and cutting himself uh pulling apart separating himself dividing himself and placing it on each one of them showing that what god and man has become one correct it was like a candlestick you were you became a light absolutely the light dwell right here and you were like a walking candlestick and god said he says he says will he take a candlestick and light it and hide under a bushel no he will not do it but he places on a hill so what the all the world can see not the stick itself but that light on there amen yes lord sure absolutely now let's move here now when's the next time we see the pillar of fire on the scene in the bible saint paul and saint paul was a man of the law he was a pharisee he was circumcised on the eighth day the stock of israel look at his resume he says the tribe of benjamin a hebrew of hebrews is touching the law he's as a pharisee he says he was blameless concerning zeal persecuting the church touching righteousness that is in the law blameless he lived it perfect just like job oh my he's before things were gained to me i count a loss for christ right so he had quite the resume but then we see that as he was persecuting the true church what the pillar of fire came down and revealed himself to the prophet paul right what was taking place if the pillar of fire showed up one more time and appeared to a man just like he did with moses the pattern must continue but what was god doing why was god meeting this man in that sort of way just like he did a major prophet moses why was he why was the pillar of fire the word now coming forth the one that just crucified lived and died turned back to spirit form come back down now the pillar fire with god and the father and in the son and appeared to him and spoke out i am jesus because remember what had taken place and where did where did peter go i'm sorry where did paul go directly after meeting that pillar of fire he says but what neither i went to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but i went to arabia and returned again unto damascus then after three years i went up to jerusalem he went right to the desert just like moses god had to send him in the desert just like moses moses scots in the desert and then in that time what the pillar of fire would appear now he had to wait on god but what was it for as we examined the seven church ages christ came lived and died and we were estimating around 33 a.d right and from 33 a.d to 53 a.d the start of ephesus there was 20 years of perfection there's 20 years of purity 53 a.d do you know there's only one book in the bible that is actually supposedly written and sent to the churches in that pure form all the other books of the bible are after 53 a.d except one and that was matthew matthew was sent in 37 a.d what probably just to encourage god anointed matthew encourage the people that say this was jesus christ life this is it but after 53 d or round 53 a.d what satan had crept in sent false teachers false brothers unawares and they started getting the church off and the church got off you know it was the second book published after 53 a.d the book of first corinthians so for 20 years the church lived pure lead led of the holy ghost but notice how fast the church went off to where god had to anoint paul now the one that saw the pillar of fire was going to bring the word of god and what was that word just like it was in the mountains the 10 commandments for correction what was the what is this all this new testament for it's correction trying to get us back to the book of acts the church had so fallen from its original state that god had to now bring forth and notice notice that how the people how how did they get how did the church start falling it had started elevating people in first corinthians 1 the first chapter of the first book sent after 53 a.d now i beseech you brother and by the name of our lord jesus christ that you all speak the same thing and there'll be no divisions among you but you'd be perfectly joining the same mind and the same judgment he says for it has been declared unto me my brother and by them which are of the house of chloe that there are contentions among you 59 a.d he says now i say this that every one of you saith i am of paul he says i am of apollos i am cephas and i have christ they had already in the pure church fallen and now they are identifying themselves they have lifted men up and said i am they connect them instead of with christ the exaltation of ministers he says is christ divided for was paul crucified for you he says oh are you baptized in paul's name absolutely not he says now the prophet says communion 1965 he says but paul set the thing in order he was the prophet to the new testament he says just as moses went to the wilderness to receive the inspiration to the right five books of the bible well paul was also sent the desert received inspiration of god to set the new new testament church in order and to type it with the old that was the pillar of fire and they wrote it god allowed them to write it i want to show you something here there's coming a time where the very discernment of god will be just like the book of acts and i want to show you the level of discernment when the lord showed this to me it just blew me away let me show you the very level of discernment of our lord and savior you mind if i do that now let's go in malachi 4 verse 4 he says remember ye the law of moses my servant which i commanded unto him in oreb for all of israel with the statutes and judgments right you know that horeb that word horeb means it means a parched or dry place or desolate he says so notice he's tying this with malachi he puts this right in malachi 4 right before malachi 5 showing that what god would send him in a dry dry time and that we would be in a dry dry time but in malachi 4 5 where do they where do most i was like ministers put emphasis behold i send you or behold i send you elijah right but what if we put the emphasis on behold i god where did it all come from god almighty who sent malachi 4 god almighty who sent malachi 4 to you god almighty now i'm going to show you something here very powerful in john 6. if we want to turn there let's get it up on the screen because i want to show you what god thinks of exalting someone else you can actually say scripture and you can mean it a different way this i hope this is a blessing to you this blew my mind when the lord showed this to me john 6 28 now watch how this comes out watch how these pharisees god actually discerns the very heart of these people this is this is supernatural in john 6 28 then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god they wanted to serve god they want to do man this guy he's healing sick raising that he's preaching things he's confounding the pharisees and scribes and sadducees he's doing it all who is this guy he must be a prophet there's something about him jesus answered to him this is the work of god that you believe on whom him on whom he has sent right now look as we move verse 30 they said they referring to them what signs sure style then that we may see and believe what does thou work now notice what they say next they're pulling from the old our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written notice what they say he gave them bread from heaven to eat wow that's brother brother brooks is that is that the truth is that the truth brothers they pulled from the scripture it was absolutely not one word off but notice the spirit behind the words what did they mean by he he he gave them our fathers he gave them bread from heaven he did it he was the one he was the great one and jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you moses gave you not that bread from heaven you know brother ran when he healed the sick and he brother raised the dead they don't even say he they say the prophet it was not the man of god it was god himself but look how far they could quote scripture and mean something else and yet a premium and a seem or or seem like they're staying with the word of god and yet in their minds they meant to magnify a man behold i send you jesus christ right here would not share his glory with moses that was gold nugget right there that's a big one hey whoop there it is keeping your keeping your files because that'll prove a lot of things right there wonder what that image of jealousy was in ezekiel 8 and he gave them bread from heaven i hope that was a blessing now now let's continue to move on in daniel 12 and verse 4 but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased what he's talking he's talking about the opening he's talking about the sealed book right many times the prophet said he said he said daniel saw the same thing heard the same thing as john you know john heard the seven thunders right now let me throw you something here let me find the book of daniel go to daniel 12 here i can show you where he heard him in daniel 12 4 oh thou daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and now shall be increased right so here daniel's to seal the book but now look at verse 7 and i and i heard the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river and when he had held up his right hand and his left hand up unto heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever and it shall be for a time at times and a half and when the time shall be accomplished scattered the people of his holy people the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished just like revelations 10 but notice he says and i heard but i understood not he heard the seven thunders but he did not understand them but we know that john understood them and he was about to write because remember when he saw that mystery babylon he looked at this woman who was sitting in all this and sitting on all that and he's rich she was rich and dressed this way he was drunk with the blood of martyrs and he said i wandered with great admiration he could not understand what this was how did this woman get like this what exactly took place but when he heard the seven thunders he didn't say anything about admiration he was just ready to write him he knew them he heard them and it was clear to him i mean let's throw that out there so now would this ring forth again we know in 1951 the pillar of fire showed to the prophet right and in many photographs the pillar of fire was found in the prophet's photos let me start here in the day in the door to door 1963 and i'm going i'm glad this morning to see many of my minister friends brother outlaw there i noticed him when i raised him up from he goes from phoenix and i'm very happy to see you down here brother outlaw you brother from jericho coming up here to jerusalem what was he what was what was brother branham doing 1963 right before the seals he's now typing phoenix and tucson as jericho and jerusalem correct he says we're happy always to be that's right tony he says so i've got off to that one up to brother williams not long ago up at phoenix you know i said tucson i live here you know so i had a kind of hold up kind of a hold up for this place you see and up on this mountain here look down to jericho and see our brother and while we're always he says uh uh so he types uh jericho and tucson and all those things to what over there what was he talking about what was he trying to express and then one time he got pulled over the police and the police see i think it was light was out he says i couldn't make a policeman last night give me a ticket believing that that that that that was jerusalem i was on the road going up here by apache junction and one of my lights went off the headlight the dimmer and i was trying to make it to a filling station when the other one went off so he's in complete darkness and i happened to look behind me and i seen this red light whoop he says and stop me he says you know what i stopped before i said yes sir them lights is out. the policeman said that's right he says you know it's a violation to do that he says yes sir but i couldn't get to the station i couldn't find anything i was trying to fire on he says where are you from he says brother branson from jerusalem he says where he says jerusalem he looked at my license he says are you a minister he said yes he says he says i'm from jerusalem he says where is that across the sea no sir it's up on that here hill called tucson so jerusalem was tucson and phoenix was jericho right and the prophet likened it to that he says i've been in down here in jericho here ministering in the valley and brother bramble kind of jokes he says i wonder he didn't get a ticket because i was messing with him you know just paraphrasing there he says uh he's dealing now he says and i find one of my greatest moments of of my visit to tucson i come here because that i was led to come here i come here because that holy spirit through a vision sent me here to what a desert place he says i come here because that the holy spirit threw a vision sent me here i know that might seem strange but he as far as i know anything that i know of god i was sent by a vision of tucson i'd wonder why he ever sent me to this desert place he said spiritually speaking over the city i don't know of any place that's more spiritually dead than tucson god sent him to tucson right completely spiritually a desert he says it's dead he says there's war between the churches there's fuss be between the congregation he's just there's no unity everyone's grabbing he says and holding and squeezing and trying to get this one proselyting he says it's a desert speaking spiritually what was god doing the pillar of fire showed up and now the prophet was sent to the desert what was prepping we know exactly what's prepping he says but then i read in the bible where god had sent moses away from his beloved ones and all that was dear to him and sent him into a wilderness to write the laws of the bible that was the old testament amen the first five books of the bible he said that is really that really he says is the old testament amen yes sir now he goes on to say he says and then i find the book in the new testament where paul which is the author not the author but the writer of the new testament he was also drive out from among his people by the spirit to arabia where he was in three and a half years and to find the inspiration and paul is the chief writer of the new testament see paul received inspiration to write the new testament taking all the old as a shadow setting in order god honored it and made the new testament amen yes sir absolutely so can you write and now if the old testament had to be drove out the writer to be drove out from his people into the desert the wilderness to get inspiration to write the old and in the new testament the writer had to be drove out by the author into the desert place to get an inspiration to write the new testament and the books are sealed he says with seven seals he says it would require the same i believe in these days to open those seven seals to leave what you hold dear to what you cherish in a law a little home that was given by me by the people and amongst all my friends and family and the church that was flourishing and having and lacking nothing i leave that pull right away from it and move away into the desert where you knew nobody and everything was against you look at the sacrifice one man had to make to what to have god open those seven seals he had to get alone and wait for god to move amen he says but there's something about god that he drives a man to do things that's beyond his own thinking why would brother brooks drive all the way up here to iowa god said move he says get up here feed my sheep up here he's so you can he says uh beyond his own thinking so you can be to the glory and honor of god and i feel that not self-honored i feel it a privilege that it was that it was to leave everything that i call deer to get into this wilderness and he says suffer like i have never suffered in my entire life that was the hardest portion of his life obeying god pulling from his his home pulling from his church pulling from all that moving to a desert where no one got along spiritually he said he suffered worse than all his rest of his life and here in the wilderness or this desert but i believe and in doing that and obeying what god commanded to be done here god has opened to us the mysteries of this last day and here we are with this message but it always takes that pillar of fire to appear and then god will write again amen yes sir he says now the word manifested is revealed in the revelation and here then what does that puts me if he is the shekinah glory i'm part of it amen he says oh amen that's right the word itself revealed reveals itself think the mysteries of god has made known to us this day by the same heavenly messenger it was made known unto me known unto them in the days in them days notice the same pillar fire moses simply fire uh paul all those things he said that the exact same the exact same leadership that i had amen now so if we're waiting he says now think of it the same pillar of fire that come upon those men that wrote the bible is the same purifier here today interpreting the bible amen how we thank him for that same what a comfort one identification i just read a quote you know why god had to say in the book of revelation you know what the prophet said why the book of revelation had to come because after 53 a.d when the fall would come and paul was writing letter after letter and writing the new testament new testament people were taking the new testament and twisting it and god said he had to send that book of revelation to john to come down and in the beginning of the book if you if you hear it you're blessed if you if you listen to it you're blessed if you read it you're blessed but at the end it says if you add or take away anything he had to seal it and said you cannot have any more that's it that's everything's included that's why he included the book of revelation because he had to put a seal on it no adding nor taking away the book is finished right amen sure now so now it's time can you write each mighty man of god was used of god to write the scripture but the bible says that you are written epistles he says you are written epistles in our hearts is written you you are our epistle written our hearts known and read of all men the way you act the way you live is depend everything depends on you i just taught a brother two weeks ago on what i call the loophole of salvation in matthew 25 why were those people saved on the right hand because of the way they treated the bride of jesus christ so you must act accordingly absolutely every time in the last couple years you know how many times i've been on a job site and the man i'm working for comes up to me with a cold cold bottle of water said simon i have to give this to you i was working at university toledo i was fixing the roof train and it was a tight tight spot and he was an old man he was going to retire in three months and i told his brother i witnessed to him a little bit by baptism he's like ah uh i think you're going a little too far listen but he was a bad he was a christian and i was the last day i was going to be there i said i can't remember the name i think it's bob i said bob i'm going to be done here in about three hours he's a sigh i'm taking off early day he said give me a second runs back downstairs i'm still working and he walked the steps three steps he said simon i had to give you this cold this cold beverage would you do would you please drink it i said absolutely three weeks ago i was sent to a millionaire's house there was a sewage ejector problem and i'm thinking million oh man it's gonna be a mansion and it's gonna be sweet and i'll just take my shoes off go down there probably a finished basement concrete i just pop the lid pull the huge ejector pull out this net you know what it was it wasn't like that he was on a he was on a crawl space and that sewage was come down into that ejector pit and it was seeping out seeping seeping i went into a cesspool jumped down there with my headlight and i'm like oh god to help me why did you make me a plumber and i humbled myself and i went down there with my gloves which were not waterproof you had to put your hands and just pull and go and i'm i'm not scared of corona trust me i've been in it all i pulled that thing checked it found out was wrong this and that set it down and the man said simon here's a here's a glass of water for you i witnessed to him but he said he goes he gave me actually three of them he said make sure you drink this is for this is from me something cold thank you so much for helping me you know what i did i drank that water because i know these people cannot understand he didn't know this little five foot three and a half plumber was a seed of god but i know when that offer comes to take that and drink that is that a loophole no that's the truth that's the word of god only a seed of god will bless the bride amen sure amen so if we are to right now he says but if that's uh uh he says have you found that blessed hiding place from the wrath remember there are not two hiding places there's just one you might be a good member of some church he says which i have nothing evil to say he's but that's if that's all you have and your life isn't compared with the book of acts remember these signs shall follow them to believe now the prophet also said he said there be a people false anointed at the time he said would be preaching mark 16 preaching mark saying displaying mark 16 and yet there'll be one word off science was miracles are those absolutely said no you'll know them by their fruits not by their gifts not by this not by that not by miracles and signs and this that you'll know them by the fruits they live and as the man of god taught malachi 4 he said he said these these fruits are the spirit he says there's imposters imitators of each one each one can be mimicked and that's why you have to give it the word test listen to what they say they're staying with the word are they saying exactly what the scripture says are they meaning just like we saw in john 6 are they saying well moses he gave us all the bread are they meaning brother bran are they meaning god but that takes the holy ghost amen now and joel 2 says i will restore you the years of the the locusts the the have eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar and the palmer worm right um now the palmer worm represents the fruits right which is eats the fruits of the spirit up then the locusts represent the leaves or they ate up the leaves which is divine fellowship the cankerworm uh devoured the bark or that lifeline and the caterpillar was the sucker of life or denomination do you know how the devil works god showed me how this works by a quote i hope you i want to read this do you know how the devil you know the devil works in textbook form just like god does you know brother jesse he was down in guyana with brother brooks i believe and they woke him up he just got in preaching a good service or whatever they would come out knocking on the door bro jesse we've got a demon-possessed lady right well jesse said yes we'll go pray but jesse said he's never done this before he said he laid his hand on the woman and started rebuking his spirit and he he said that her hands started grabbing her hand his hands really tight and then he kept rebuking the devil keep reviewing the devil come out of the name of jesus christ and he said that she started to bite his hand and he said it started hurt a little bit but he just kept rebuking and all of a sudden he said she let out a scream and fell down as dead and when brother jesse told me this he says textbook bible because whenever a spirit comes out it'll rent the person they fall down just slain textbook bible you know the devil works that way everything works the same let me give you an example here i want to show you something here in first corinthians 11 our church our assembly has actually experienced this we had started our assembly and brother bart had a dream and god supernaturally showed me something through my dogs i had two sisters two dogs and they for one for some reason they started getting angry at each other and they were like buddies from birth they got angry each other when this and this and this and this and they were fighting and they've never done that before i said lord what are you trying to show me and then he showed it to me but now remember this is something for us to watch out for this is textbook bible how the antichrist comes in in first corinthians 11 verse 17 now in this i declare unto you i praise you not that you come together not for the better but for the worse for first off for first of all when you come together in the church i hear that there are divisions among you so god allows the devil to kick in and form little groups and divisions and maybe there's a church within a church or two separate churches together with one but the first thing we're going to see is divisions in the church and that's why god showed me with brother bart called me said brother so i had the stream and i'm going to tell you the problem the church i said hold a second i'll tell you i said division he said how do you know i said god already showed me he showed him spiritually he showed me through the natural so first of all when you come together i hear there'll be divisions among you and i partly believe it now notice after the visions what's the next step for there must also be there must be also heresies among you you know what the next thing sprung up in our church a heresy a false teaching afterwards brother cam met the brother in a minute back and said hey you need to correct that he said i'll correct that if i feel led to brother cam said no you will correct it he says if i feel led to king says you're gone but first there was a division in the church resistance towards a pastor and then a heresy strung up because that's textbook bible but why was all this for there must be heresies also among you for that they which be which are approved may be manifest among you that kind of stuff god allows to rise up in the in those that are teaching false to show that these are the truth that's textbook bible now if we're to write the book of acts again if god's going to use us to write the book of acts again we have to identify what spirits and how they work did you know organization and denomination are not the same thing they actually accomplish separately they accomplished two different things separately in order do you know which one's first the bible says i'm sorry i'm sorry not bible the church age book look how the prophet breaks us down he says and the very same spirit and doctrine is right amongst the protestants and it's called denomination he says nicolaitanism is organization humanizing the leadership of the church and thereby disposing the spirit so the way for satan to get into the church is he's got to have the people elevate and magnify a man and then when that happens when these people switch from the leadership of the holy ghost now to a man the spirit of god leaves and now when the spirit of god leaves now the prophet said you can bring in a denominational mindset or denominational spirits and now he says now they can pull and make different creeds that's the order of that antichrist spirit how it works i saw that quote i was like what happened i've been looking for that in like 10 years oh now i understand how it works are you mad now and you can stand by the grace of god let's stand here i want to read a couple quotes here he says he says but let me tell you brother if the holy ghost is real in the church today the kind of church it had that wrote the book of acts behind it the church of living god the church of jesus christ become again alive by the same holy ghost that fell on the day of pentecost it will write a book of acts behind it what are we waiting for the bible said not by might not by power but by my spirit there is coming a time that after god has healed off and pruned every false branch and it's now and now it's time to bring forth life back into the vine and push forth the branch it's gonna happen we are now what being patient waiting on god to bring forth that life back out to the church you know in the in in one of the was the feast of the trumpets he said the holy ghost has been bound the holy ghost has been bound for 2000 years and if we have the holy ghost inside of us and it's not living according we're binding it we ourselves are even though we're sealed even though we are the bride of christ but if we are binding him and not letting him work through seven church ages they had the holy ghost literally the very life of god in them and they could the bible said god we did ignorance for a season but now that we have the saints of god we have now the open word what's left we have to yield and as i've said under my pastor brother camp for almost 10 almost 10 years now you know what the culmination of all where all the problems lie that's our fault lack of prayer the prophet said if we had a praying church i'm talking like that brother saying the other night about that sweet hour of prayer if we could have a praying church he says the signs of one will be multiplying among us and that's good but what is the pattern remember what is the pattern my pastor had he had evangelists come in he started preaching this and had a good services he met the man in the back and brother cam was kind of testing him that's what a pastor does the pastor's overseer the watcher he's the man that's like hey what's going on here and he said he said brother he says he says you know i'm so excited and he and he said it in such a way he says i'm so excited for the book of acts and how the local assembly is going to have all nine spiritual gifts and the brother said brother we already have nine all-night spiritual gifts in the entire body he says it's worldwide and he said no brother the prophet said in the local assembly do we have higher heights to reach absolutely do we have greater grounds higher grounds to reach [Laughter] just type in local assembly local gifts he said he said the true church will have all nine spiritual gifts living in the local he does not say world or the body of christ he's at the local assembly is it possible all things are possible is it going to happen absolutely because he said i will restore amen saith the lord absolutely so our goal is not necessarily march 16 but we want what all of it a higher life everyone has a psalm or or a revelation or or this or that all edifying each other every one of us has a ministry i don't care who you are you have a ministry how are we going to win souls for christ how are we sayings of god there's a move coming like brother says there's a ladder rain coming and it's going to produce it's going to mature what we are amen he says that when his church sits together in heavenly places then the fullness of the power of god is in his church the prophet said i long for the day when the anonymization of fire is back in the church he says each one of us holding spiritual gifts spiritual offices coming together bringing the pillar of fire back again to what write the book of acts one more time amen let's say let's sing a little something saints we've gotta know we're a small church and you guys are all probably thoroughly repented and keeping yourselves right but if you need prayer we're more than happy to pray for you by the grace of god and we know god's he's he hears our prayers he answered them i gave a little testimony i was praying for a certain thing about getting a house for somebody to help them and for two days in a row i come home from work and i'd instantly just hit the prayer and i started praying god and in two days the holy ghost told brother brooks to call me i said brother brooks uh what's what what's going on he goes brother the holy ghost told me to call you i was like oh he goes what's been on your mind i said and i told him this and this and he gave me his advice and he told me which what to do he gave me his advice and i took that advice and i made a decision upon that advice but what god heard me if we get down and really seek god with all sincerity with all the bible talks about the sincerity of the bread the bread of sincerity of truth we're gonna we're gonna see it now here's what i kind of like he says he says uh he says god bless you boys god bless you there god bless you all over the building he says your hands let the holy spirit waken me up from the slumber that i'm sitting in and here's our great call our great desire i want to be filled with the holy spirit now this is the prophet his desires i want to be filled with the holy spirit in such a way that my human senses will not function unless it is the will of god i want to be led of the spirit he says the spirit is the sixth sense god gave man five senses they wasn't to control you he says what the holy ghost is sent to control you the five senses here is to contact the earthly he said but that's not the control oh this is hot well it's only hot if god allows you to get burned amen ever hear that testimony brother ray over in lorraine or sheffield he's working at the steel plant there he's working a steel plant and his job was to flip over 900 pound steel rolls of rolls of steel and he was slipping and went over and flipping went over and his his bar got caught and the roll flipped over and landed on his hand 900 pounds and he said brother he goes god must have given me the power of samson he said he reached out like this lifted it up and threw it off one hand 900 well probably 450 pounds on one side and he said he pulled his hand up like this and his fingers were flat blood shooting out on the corners do you think he went to the hospital called 9-1-1 he is in such a place he said this isn't even real and he finished out 12 more hours of work and he said by the end of that end of that week everything was back to normal this is not real he remember the prophet said he's in that realm over there is more real than this one and you must command this to to do and brother ray anointed his he told me that same testimony and it was a year later i was screwed i was up 14 foot in the air and i was screwing a screw with a drill gun this way which we all know i learned i should have learned a long time ago is not the way to screw yours and i hit that thing and it went right in my eye and i was 14 in the air i'm sitting on us on a stud and i said lord god right in i mean and my mind went right back to brother ray and his testimony i said lord my dad was standing right there saw me he's like silence him and i was like dad just hold on i said lord you know i need this right eye to weld i need i need this right eye to work i don't want you to pay my bills i said lord i need this right i but i love you lord you know i want to serve you lord and i need this right eye and the pain i felt and all those things and i cried crawled down the ladder there the extension ladder one eye and i got down and i said dad did you did you see that he said i saw it i said dad i don't know if i'm gonna be able to see or not but let's say a prayer and i said a prayer my dad witnessed and i said the exact same prayer i sit up there and i said lord god i need this right eye we got done praying i said dad i'm going to open my eye in about 10 seconds here i counted 10 and i lost confidence i was like because i don't know what's going to happen but i said a prayer and i said you know what let's do this i counted 10 and i opened my eye and i said dad i can see my dad said amen because it doesn't matter what happens to this it's not real you think i went to hospital no i went right back to work i drove in half an hour and a half to adrian michigan i pulled the final the superintendent on the job he looked at me said what happened ryan i said i want to i took a drill back thought he said simon he's one of them dominating guys simon i want to tell you something i've seen this before that is eye trauma you're going to lose your eye i'm sorry to tell i'm sorry i'm the guy that has to tell you this but you're you're going to lose your eye man i said okay but he didn't know i already prayed for him he says next time i see you'll probably have a glass i'm sorry i'm what is guess what i can see and guess what else happened on that job i was working on that job and there was a man on a scaffold two scaffolds up and i'm working here on the floor ground cutting like this cast iron pipe for a drain and i heard a thud boom on the concrete and you hear it all day long let's hear it this and that and i'm just cutting and i look up and there's a man laying there as his uh fell off the scaffold his hard hat was flung over here or wherever and his man's just going and i'm looking at his co-workers and they're standing there just going i run over to this gentleman probably 15 foot away and here he is he's he's on and i've heard it before it's called the death rattle before you go out there's the bible the body's just pulling for air to survive pulling from air and i'm looking at the guys i'm just like uh no one's doing anything they seem to they're just standing there looking i said come here come here come here i said do you mind if i pray they said no i said close i said bow your heads then i went down and said a one minute prayer i said lord god just heal this man don't let him die i took off running to the nurse station because i was at a school i come back out and he was he was he was back to himself he come right out of it they life flight him all the way to university of michigan and i just went on my day two weeks later a big man about six foot five come looking at me come hunt me down hey you yes sir i'm like am i in trouble he's like hey are you the guy that prayed over that one guy that fell i said yeah he goes you're not gonna believe this i said what's that he goes they rushed him all the way to the u of m live flight and that night his brains got blood on the brain his heart his head started swelling he had a punctured lung and he broke his shoulder because it hit the the scaffold of the or the outrigger of the scaffold and he goes you know what happened the next day i said what's that his brain didn't it came back and he was walking around they let him out the next day and i looked at this big man and i said you tell that man that jesus christ saved his life that day on the exact same job that god saved my eye amen anyhow i just want to be blessed i just wanted to tell you that little testimony there let's say a word of prayer dear heavenly father lord jesus lord you know lord this message may be a little cut up lord or however lord but lord jesus lord it was i looked it over lord and just uh oh i just felt so good lord just to teach it again god lord jesus lord we just pray with edifying and lord god lord may you bring forth lord the book of acts in this church lord may these brothers well may they sister god lord be able to bring forth god lord exactly what you have lord may your spirit lord ignite itself lord god may you come through that that that buying god lord and bust out another branch god lord and produce exactly what you said god you said you're the alpha lord and now lord please lord bring forth the old man of god and the bride hear god use these brothers lord these this assembly lord use the pastor god lord and lord jesus lord lord we're going to do it all for your glory and lord when we say he gave us brethren from heaven lord we're going to mean you lord jesus we're going to mean that you did it all lord everything was in your plan lord you've fulfilled everything lord you you left no room for air god and you were faithful let me count you uh the most faithful person jesus christ the righteous lord the omnipotent all those things but we we love you so much bless the people god in the name of jesus christ amen saints of god hope it was a blessing just a little testimony here a little study there but that's how i teach i teach like this just that's how i teach so anyhow brother isaiah if you want to come up here if anyone has prayer just sing something or pray play something we leave out in the morning so keep us our church in prayer we're pushing towards the same thing we want the book of acts we want nine spiritual gifts in the church we want all everything that god has for us we want to be yielded we want to be used we want to fulfill the word what have we got for a song this thing lord prepare us to be a sanctuary i guess that's what's coming to my mind hallelujah who tried and true [Music] now sing that again oh lord prepare me to be a sanctuary [Music] try and true [Music] thank you pure thee [Music] oh [Music] good [Music] foreign [Music] me [Music] thanksgiving [Music] foreign [Music] tried it through [Music] be [Music] me [Music] thanksgiving thank you we truly thank god for the grace of god we thank god for the word i hope i didn't disturb the brother but i had to run out quickly but you know we have been blessed today i don't think brother i know brother simon don't know some of the things that i preached just the other day about jesus christ and god and how jesus and god is the same but yet not the same elohim and jesus can't say he's elohim yet he is elohim it's like the coke bottle the bottle of coke the bottle was created but if the coke represents god it was not is that right that's what makes us sons of god the flesh is not it's created has a beginning in the ending but the god inside is eternal it's simple but we can make it complicated if we want to but just as i said last week if you could run understand as he said the godhead of the relationship between the son and jesus our god and the son you understand what he means father i would that they be one even as we are one it is a mystery it is a wonderful mystery i appreciate the brother bringing the word of god the way he has and you had to really listen to hear and see where he was trying to take us but one thing for certain if we can see that this we're at the end of this all of these things have already been done we we see it historically [Music] profoundly right in the word of god hidden from the intellectuals and the ddds and the ldds but then god takes it and he brings us a prophet and i like what he said malachi 4 i send you elijah that was really good because one thing for certain our marriage is marriage to the lamb we wed him and i thank god for everything many people don't understand sometimes they think you're trying to cut brother branham out of the picture and god knows that it's not true you can't preach about noah i mean the flood without bringing noah you can't preach about the exodus without bringing in moses you can't even preach about god without bringing in jesus christ and you and i must understand that what god is doing now he's trying to refocus us all of us because we have all fallen into a system of religion and we're trying to pull away from every system because where the spirit of the lord is there's liberty and we want to be where we can be led by the spirit is that right you know here was a prophet of god getting ready to take a plane uh out and then all of a sudden god said keep walking i wonder how many times how many of us would have done that i got a plane to catch i can't i can't miss this plane but god said keep walking keep walking that's all i'm saying that connection that unity that oneness is where god is taking us and i'm not going to preach even already did the preaching i've been blessed by god's grace i've been blessed brother and uh you know a lot of times people are not used to teaching because i try to teach and i preach but you know to draw out the things on the board was really wonderful and we forget that the that the bride is perfected by the five-fold ministry pastor can't do it on his own evangelists can't do it on we need teachers we need those who can come in here and draw it out and bring it to us in the way that you did brother i appreciate that you love the lord i do and i know you too and i'm gonna let the song leader whoever saying continue singing another refreshing from the lord amen after the word has gone forth amen i heard from god this evening that's my testimony the amen song is just worship the lord [Music] this thirsting of my soul [Music] fill it up and make me [Music] [Music] come and win this thirsting of my soul feed me till i [Music] fill it up and make me yes jesus i lift it up lord come and quench this thirsting of my soul [Music] oh yes lord i left [Music] feed [Music] feel my cupboard yes lord i lift it up lord may you come and quench this thirsting i have in my soul [Music] [Music] fill it is and make me whole feel my cup lord oh yes lord i left it up to you lord come and quit this bursting i have in my soul feed me [Music] fill it up and make me [Music] fill it up and make me [Music] it is and make me open up [Music] just to take him at his word and rest upon his promise amen jesus just to take him at his word just to rest upon his promise and [Music] [Music] him over and over jesus jesus preaches jesus of your grace to trust him more trust in jesus just to trust his cleansing blood and his faith [Music] singing jesus jesus yes [Music] just from jesus [Music] jesus jesus [Music] now i'm so glad i learned to trust him with jesus christ and i know [Music] jesus jesus how i trust him [Music] all for grace jesus jesus [Music] i trust jesus [Music] jesus jesus jesus i trust jesus christ [Music] [Music] jesus [Music] tell him one more time jesus jesus [Music] jesus christ [Music] oh [Music] [Music] amen there's no one else we can put our trust in than jesus hallelujah and after that we after we put our trust in him all we can say is all is well we have had the message alone there's nothing to worry little bride just trust in him all is well amen this will be dismissed we'll sing this last song always well same key please [Music] shalom all these ways [Applause] there is a place of perfect rest behind the inner [Music] is [Music] shalom there is a place of perfect rest behind [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] all these [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] i dressed for [Music] there is a place a perfect rest behind the inner [Music] see there is a place [Music] [Music] slow little bright rays [Music] you
