[0:00] as we stand we're just going to get
[0:01] right into the word of
[0:06] God ask as we stand that you turn with
[0:10] us to 2
[0:20] Thessalonians love the
[0:23] Lord second
[0:26] Thessalonians read from the second
[0:28] chapter
[0:33] beginning at the ninth verse and we'll
[0:36] go
[0:36] to uh Isaiah
[0:40] 66 2 Thessalonians
[0:44] 9 at the 12th
[0:54] verse I'm sorry 2 Thessalonians 2 give
[0:58] me beginning at the ninth
[1:05] verse didn't sound
[1:09] right even him whose coming is after the
[1:13] working of
[1:15] Satan with all power and signs and lying
[1:21] wonders with all deceivableness of
[1:24] unrighteousness in them that
[1:26] perish because they receive not the love
[1:31] of the truth and that's my theme because
[1:35] they receive not the love of the truth
[1:38] that they might be saved for this cause
[1:42] God shall send them strong delusion that
[1:47] they should believe a
[1:49] lie that they might that they all might
[1:53] be damned who believed not the truth but
[1:57] had pleasure in
[2:00] unrighteousness amen Isaiah
[2:19] 66 Isaiah 66
[2:28] and4
[2:35] I also would choose their
[2:38] delusions and will bring their fears
[2:40] upon
[2:41] them because when I called none did
[2:46] answer when I spake they did not hear
[2:50] but they did evil before mine
[2:53] eyes and chose that in which I delighted
[2:58] not
[3:00] let us
[3:01] pray Heavenly Father God we come before
[3:04] you Lord as humbly as we know how we
[3:07] thank you for your grace and your mercy
[3:10] we thank you Father for being good to us
[3:14] Lord we pray that you forgive us of all
[3:16] of our sins and our
[3:19] shortcomings Lord we just pray that you
[3:22] would cleanse us with your Holy Fire oh
[3:25] God make us ready Lord give us God God
[3:29] what we stand in need
[3:32] of to make a translation father and to
[3:36] all to you be all the glory Lord we ask
[3:40] these things in Jesus Christ's name we
[3:42] pray
[3:44] amen you may be seated amen just to
[3:47] encourage you by the grace of God uh if
[3:50] you have a way of listening to the
[3:52] message uh this day the scripture is
[3:55] fulfilled I pray that you will allow or
[3:57] ask God to give you a full revelation of
[4:01] what is really being really taking place
[4:04] uh during that time uh I think a lot of
[4:06] times people uh basically uh saw uh
[4:11] different things but brother bradam was
[4:13] basically trying to bring us up uh into
[4:17] history bring us up into the day in
[4:19] which we were are living in and uh he in
[4:24] that scripture or in that uh this day
[4:26] the scripture is fulfilled uh we find
[4:29] out out that brother brandom approaches
[4:31] the uh uh the uh Podium and somehow his
[4:37] wife has given him a new Bible and the
[4:39] pages stick together and a priest
[4:43] basically uh tells him amen uh that God
[4:46] is getting ready to do something so here
[4:49] God speaks through him and the priest
[4:52] not even knowing what the prophet was
[4:53] going to preach uh had no idea basically
[4:57] what he was uh going to to do we find
[5:01] out also in that same tape there was a
[5:03] sister who was of the priest the
[5:05] priest's sister uh who were was there in
[5:09] the meeting uh spoke in tongues
[5:12] interpreted the exact thing that the
[5:15] priest that told brother Brandon so we
[5:18] we look at this and uh my subject on
[5:21] tonight would be the power of Satan's
[5:26] illusion and uh we realize amen that
[5:29] that where we are uh we're living in a
[5:32] time when uh people are in a
[5:35] delusion you know you can use the word
[5:38] illusion delusion because a delusion is
[5:42] a false
[5:43] belief or opinion now that's something
[5:47] that somebody really when they think
[5:49] they're right when they're wrong the
[5:51] Bible says that we're living in a day
[5:53] when the the ways of men they think that
[5:55] they're right uh see but there's only
[5:58] one way right
[6:00] and that's God's way when we speak of
[6:03] Illusion we speak of something that
[6:06] deceives by uh producing a
[6:11] false uh and
[6:14] misleading
[6:15] impression of
[6:17] reality something that produces in other
[6:21] words you you might even think you got
[6:24] evidence that you're right for an
[6:27] example when uh uh Janis and jambre
[6:31] threw down their
[6:33] rods and the Egyptians were at that
[6:36] point brought into an
[6:40] illusion and because they believe the
[6:43] illusion they came into a place of being
[6:46] delus deluded so we looked and we see by
[6:50] the grace of God Amen that you know they
[6:53] began to believe why should we follow
[6:55] Moses when we got janers and jambre and
[6:59] we find out that that's exactly what
[7:01] happened in our day and when brother Bon
[7:04] began to speak the message this day the
[7:07] scriptures fulfilled he was trying to
[7:10] indicate to the people the very thing
[7:13] can't you see what is taken place a
[7:17] priest hand me a Bible like a priest
[7:20] handed Jesus the
[7:21] Bible Jesus comes from this scripture
[7:26] that I'm coming out of
[7:29] but Jesus read the scripture where it
[7:32] was an accepted
[7:34] time but I'm reading the scripture where
[7:37] the Judgment of God is at
[7:39] hand so he was showing the Alpha and the
[7:43] Omega of the scripture that Jesus had
[7:46] read and understand amen it was still
[7:50] the Lord Jesus hiding behind human
[7:54] flesh and so we find out amen that we
[7:58] are living in a time and and this thing
[8:01] become h h h
[8:03] psychological because once a man
[8:06] believes something with in their mind
[8:08] it's so difficult for them to see
[8:11] anything else in other words they become
[8:14] blinded in their minds that's that's the
[8:18] age that we're living in the Bible said
[8:21] that uh in Revelations 3 that Leo deia
[8:24] would be blind now he's not speaking
[8:27] amen that she's naturally blind but
[8:30] because she's spiritually blind she
[8:32] can't see
[8:33] naturally the things that are spiritual
[8:37] so we find out by the grace of God Amen
[8:40] that this whole world a basically is
[8:43] living in an illusion they really
[8:46] believe that they're right now watch
[8:50] this on the on that message brother
[8:51] brandham says amen for those of us who
[8:55] reject the message listen to it really
[8:58] there is no hope for you when you reject
[9:01] the message you basically commit H H uh
[9:05] blasphemy amen and so there are a lot of
[9:09] people who have been led into an
[9:12] illusion and now amen they are in really
[9:16] uh
[9:17] insane because they've walked away from
[9:20] the truth the only way you can truly
[9:23] believe a lie you must first walk away
[9:26] from the truth so we find out that and
[9:29] the Bible said that's what God did he
[9:32] gave them a strong delusion not just an
[9:35] a illusion or a delusion he gave them a
[9:39] strong one one that cannot be broken and
[9:44] brother Bradman goes on in that message
[9:45] and he tells us amen that because of
[9:48] their dis obedience he said that was
[9:50] their
[9:51] Jubilee and he said when they walk away
[9:54] from this message God bore them with a
[9:56] or in their ear and they'll never be
[10:00] able to hear the message again not that
[10:03] they won't hear with the ear but they
[10:05] won't believe that it's right they won't
[10:08] believe that it's true and look at all
[10:11] the people that have walked away from
[10:14] this message not knowing that they
[10:17] crossed the line of grace and
[10:19] mercy now I'm not talking about
[10:22] backsliders because backsliders know
[10:24] it's true even though they're not living
[10:28] it I'm talking about people who have
[10:31] blasphemed and said negative things and
[10:34] spoke evil of the Holy Ghost it's
[10:37] amazing I was preaching this message and
[10:39] normally I don't listen to that man
[10:40] called camping because he's so far off
[10:42] the word but you know I heard that man
[10:45] preach a message
[10:47] tonight and he literally blasphemed the
[10:50] Holy Ghost he literally called the
[10:52] things that were of God the devil and I
[10:55] thought oh my God such a a intellig and
[10:59] educated man and think about the
[11:02] millions of people that follows this man
[11:05] teaching that he has led into
[11:09] blaspheming the Holy Ghost thank God for
[11:12] a prophet Hallelujah because you and I
[11:14] would have done the same thing truly it
[11:17] looked Wicked truly it looked evil truly
[11:20] it looks like it's not of God but
[11:23] brother brandham said it's the same rain
[11:26] be careful because rain makes the seed
[11:30] grow and M rain makes the tears
[11:33] grow same anointing but different
[11:38] seeds but he called the anointing the
[11:42] devil so you know it's just a lack of
[11:45] understanding but when you see and I
[11:47] thought Lord what an illusion how what a
[11:51] delusion that this man is in because
[11:54] he's really calling everybody else false
[11:58] when he himself is
[12:00] false that's what the Bible said the
[12:03] blind leaders lead the blind and they
[12:06] both shall fall into the ditch one of
[12:09] the things that really stirred my heart
[12:11] up about this message because some of
[12:14] you know about uh uh uh Kenny Copeland
[12:18] and his gang well that's just part of
[12:21] what's really happening how they
[12:23] receiving the pope and it is amazing
[12:25] that the pope amen sends him a personal
[12:28] video
[12:29] now I'm going to read something in
[12:31] Daniel turn with me to Daniel please
[12:33] Daniel
[12:35] 11 you know you look at this thing and
[12:38] you see by the grace of God that nothing
[12:41] is happening out of order amen
[12:45] everything is happening now there is a
[12:48] uniting is't that amazing because here
[12:51] we got into this church and we preach A
[12:53] House Divided cannot stand and we show
[12:56] that it is so important that we as a
[12:58] little group group here would pull more
[13:00] together and be as one now that's
[13:03] something that you can't do uh in human
[13:06] effort it literally takes the Holy
[13:08] Spirit to do it because our true Union
[13:11] comes by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[13:14] amen the Bible said by one Spirit are we
[13:16] baptized into one body this cannot be
[13:19] achieved by by man's work or men's H
[13:23] hands but if we all seek the same thing
[13:27] and have the same mind we'll come into
[13:30] the unity of the Faith by the spirit of
[13:34] God now we look at this thing in Daniel
[13:37] 11th chapter beginning at the 21st verse
[13:40] and we're not going to read it
[13:42] all but this is talking about the
[13:45] Antichrist the man that is to come the
[13:48] Bible says and in his
[13:50] estate shall stand up a vile person
[13:55] oh let's say the Pope that we got now is
[14:00] he the Bible say he's
[14:02] vile but the world saying he's
[14:05] good oh he's a good man he's he's
[14:08] popular right and now he's extending his
[14:11] hand to his denominational
[14:15] Brethren to whom they shall not give
[14:18] honor the honor of the Kingdom but he
[14:21] shall come in peaceably oh they weren't
[14:24] going to give him but he's coming in
[14:26] peaceably watch the serpent
[14:29] he's coming in peaceably and obtain the
[14:33] kingdom by what flatteries you're my
[14:37] brother who's to blame for this thing
[14:40] I'm to blame and you're to blame oh he's
[14:43] just sucking them in amen But the
[14:46] saddest thing is amen if they had only
[14:49] listened to the
[14:51] voice they would know what's actually
[14:54] happening right now I'm so
[14:57] grateful that God sent us light in the
[15:00] time of Darkness I don't know what to do
[15:04] and the more I see this thing
[15:06] approaching the more it makes me want to
[15:09] press into
[15:11] it hey
[15:16] somebody
[15:18] Hallelujah we could have been caught
[15:20] right up under that but God called us
[15:27] out and with the arms of a flood shall
[15:31] they be
[15:32] overflown from before him and shall be
[15:35] broken yay also the prince of the
[15:38] Covenant and after the league made with
[15:41] him he shall work deceitfully but he
[15:43] shall come up and she be shall become
[15:46] strong with the small people and that
[15:49] means amen he that's all he needed is a
[15:51] small group right because remember amen
[15:55] the prophet of God said it's just only
[15:56] 1% in Russia that's
[16:00] communist right they're the ones that's
[16:03] ruling it doesn't take much it just take
[16:06] a real strong hand a real dictator that
[16:11] knows how to surmise he knows how to
[16:15] conquer the people uhh by by his by his
[16:18] flatteries he knows what people
[16:21] like he knows it he's the
[16:26] devil right he's the devil so we realize
[16:29] by the grace of God this Antichrist is a
[16:32] smooth
[16:36] character but what we don't see is that
[16:40] this thing is being fulfilled in our
[16:43] day we're
[16:45] overdue but now we can see the time is
[16:48] running out and remember if you're here
[16:52] when he turns into the Beast that means
[16:55] you missed the
[16:57] rapture
[17:00] you've missed it that's what you don't
[17:03] want to do because you think amen like I
[17:06] heard the other day you say hell but
[17:09] hell amen is just a word in your
[17:11] vocabulary none of us know what it
[17:14] is but let me say it like this it is a
[17:17] place of chaos hello it's a place of
[17:20] suffering it's a place that your mind
[17:23] can't even comprehend the worst horror
[17:25] movie you've ever seen cannot be compare
[17:29] because I'm going tell you something
[17:30] about horror movies they come to an
[17:33] end not in this
[17:35] world not in the world of chaos now I
[17:38] want you to understand this this what we
[17:40] call a world of order has become is
[17:43] becoming more and more every day a world
[17:45] of disorder it's becoming a world of
[17:47] more chaos and look at the wickedness
[17:50] that we see now can you imagine what
[17:54] hell is like when there is it is totally
[17:57] Lawless
[18:00] one thing after the other pain and Agony
[18:03] coming on and listen there is no time
[18:07] clock you and I can't imagine it like we
[18:10] can't imagine heaven we can't imagine
[18:12] what it would be there but it's because
[18:16] they failed to love the truth y'all hear
[18:19] what I'm saying when you fail to love it
[18:22] he didn't say like it he said love
[18:26] it he gave them over to a a strong
[18:29] delusion when you watch those people
[18:32] that's always trying to find fa with
[18:34] what God has brought in this day my God
[18:37] they standing on on Dangerous
[18:40] Grounds it's a difference when you're
[18:42] learning and you're seeking to no truth
[18:45] but when you're seeking to find fa
[18:47] you're in Dangerous Grounds oh help us
[18:50] Lord Jesus God said he chose their
[18:56] delusion here it happened in Pharaoh's
[18:59] day God took a a Fallen King called
[19:03] called called Moses and raised him up he
[19:06] looked like an insane man and he was the
[19:11] truth but they wanted to believe with
[19:13] all of listen God hardens Pharaoh's
[19:19] heart and Pharaoh hardened the people's
[19:22] heart because they believe Pharaoh when
[19:25] they knew Moses was right
[19:29] they were caught under the spirit they
[19:31] were caught under that illusion and they
[19:33] all
[19:35] perished because they may missed the day
[19:37] of their
[19:39] visitation think about it people 2
[19:42] Corinthians
[19:46] 11:14 you love the Lord It's a powerful
[19:50] it's a powerful illusion of Satan the
[19:53] whole world is going after
[19:57] it now think about it if Satan's Eden is
[20:01] a mixture of everything that is in the
[20:06] world it's I w't I'll be jumping in a
[20:09] minute I'm I'm gonna slow down but I
[20:10] want you to realize amen that Satan amen
[20:13] he loves to to to to take what God has
[20:17] done and and pervert it and make it look
[20:20] right that's what I'm saying second
[20:24] Corinthians please
[20:27] 11:14
[20:30] it's powerful people and I'm going tell
[20:32] you something what we've got we ought to
[20:34] be praising God for it every day and
[20:36] every night Hallelujah said brother
[20:38] Brooks brother Brooks I'm not what I
[20:40] should be let me put it this way if
[20:42] you're looking at your works if you're
[20:45] looking at your flesh if you're looking
[20:48] at your achievements you miss heav A
[20:51] Million
[20:53] Miles because let me say it like this
[20:56] how can you achieve anything without
[20:57] Jesus Jesus
[20:59] Christ and you got to realize that is
[21:02] what Grace is all about to look at
[21:05] Calvary and to look at the Lamb of God
[21:08] and said it was all enough for
[21:11] me that's it I can't do it so I'm
[21:16] accepting what he's done for
[21:21] me it doesn't mean that we go out and
[21:23] live any kind of life we do whatever we
[21:26] can do to live right before God in
[21:29] appreciation to what he has done for us
[21:33] hallelujah and to know that within your
[21:36] heart amen you're going to make mistakes
[21:38] but when you do you didn't mean to do it
[21:41] you didn't mean to do it and and and and
[21:44] there are times you did but God still
[21:46] died for your sin your iniquity when you
[21:49] knew to do good and you didn't do
[21:51] it second go 11:14 he says what no
[21:56] Marvel which in other words Marvel not
[21:59] for Satan himself is
[22:01] transformed into an angel of
[22:05] Light and that little that little thing
[22:08] I sent out to some of you by way of the
[22:11] text here it is this man I forgot his
[22:13] name he's liking himself to have the
[22:16] spirit of
[22:17] Elijah
[22:19] reconciliation a Ministry of bringing
[22:22] the hearts of the children to the
[22:23] fathers and the hearts of the father to
[22:25] the children thank God we know the real
[22:27] El Li
[22:29] but the thing that you can see that he's
[22:31] the bridge that's going to take amen
[22:34] this fullness of the Pentecostal church
[22:36] right back into amen this Catholic
[22:39] Church he even called them Catholic and
[22:42] you know what they are they baptized in
[22:45] the name of the father son and allly
[22:49] go there are there is children and you
[22:52] know they basically even the Lutheran
[22:55] Church in this this city has basically
[23:00] recant from what Luther
[23:03] did and they have now accepted the
[23:06] Catholic Church as
[23:10] Brethren they forgotten go back in
[23:14] history it's just a sleeping giant ready
[23:17] to kill and murder all over again oh my
[23:22] goodness what the people don't
[23:24] understand is going to be worse than
[23:25] bloody bloody what say Bloody Mary and H
[23:28] Mary time
[23:30] hallelujah hallelujah and what they you
[23:33] know the people is you know it's a sad
[23:35] thing because what we thought uh would
[23:38] be foolish virgin is actually receiving
[23:40] the mark of the
[23:42] beast brother Bram in that tape uh uh uh
[23:46] uh uh this day the scriptures fulfilled
[23:48] he said you better believe it now he
[23:51] said because if you don't believe it now
[23:53] you will have to seal it your life your
[23:56] with your blood you have to seal you'll
[23:59] have to die for this truth because you
[24:02] wouldn't go further with it he said
[24:04] believe it
[24:06] now right you won't accept the mark but
[24:09] you'll die because you got to seal your
[24:13] blood now when God blood should have
[24:16] been your
[24:19] seal
[24:23] Hallelujah St John
[24:26] 12:36
[24:30] [Music]
[24:33] what people don't understand this thing
[24:34] can happen it could flip like a life F
[24:37] flip switch overnight and you know and I
[24:40] know most of us you see what Lord I say
[24:42] most of us I'm talking about message
[24:43] people they're not
[24:46] ready how do you make yourself ready by
[24:50] receiving the Seal of the Holy
[24:52] Ghost it's not that you're not going to
[24:54] make mistakes but you know you got the
[24:56] seal
[24:58] you know you got it and the prophet of
[25:01] God said if you got the seal you'll seal
[25:03] to the day of your Redemption nothing
[25:05] can break the seal nothing can break the
[25:09] seal that box cart got to go all the way

[29:59] dangerous time how many Y how many

[30:03] something people of God you know what
[30:05] that Pope said he likened himself as the
[30:08] Joseph and he likened himself as these
[30:12] Brethren he said during that time the
[30:14] Brethren had to come to him he said they
[30:17] had money here the key he had they had
[30:20] money but they couldn't eat is that
[30:23] America he's setting her up she's she
[30:27] her money won't be of any value until
[30:30] they come to
[30:32] Joseph oh people can't you see it he's
[30:35] literally telling them what's going
[30:42] on liking himself to
[30:47] Joseph oh my and the Pentecostals are
[30:51] eating it
[30:53] up eating it up because they failed to
[30:55] believe a little Kentucky
[30:58] 1 Thessalonians 5:5 ye are the children
[31:01] of the light and the children of the day
[31:03] we are not of the night nor of
[31:06] Darkness Hallelujah we are children of

[37:59] and making them think that he's some
[38:00] great prophet oh it just makes you want
[38:02] to throw
[38:05] up how they was carrying on about this
[38:08] Pope I'm like oh my God worshiping the
[38:11] devil and don't even know it and
[38:13] claiming that they got the Holy Ghost

[38:17] tongues and this Copeland God was
[38:19] speaking in tongues and brother Brandon
[38:22] told us what it was all
[38:24] about all of that don't mean nothing
[38:27] Satan can do it all and he's deceived
[38:30] them by the very
[38:34] thing is that all right the Bible says

[40:43] from a real bad situation but what good
[40:47] is that now when you turn your back on

[42:56] we got peace we're brothers now
[43:00] hallelujah we're Union amen that's the
[43:03] Bible the Bible said they're coming to

[43:15] beast Lord hallelujah how you going to
[43:19] say that ain't of God Amen here they are
[43:21] having a
[43:24] Revival that's where the peace and
[43:26] safety comes in I thought Lord I ain't
[43:28] never seen that before I said God I said
[43:31] I ain't never seen that before I thought
[43:33] oh world peace is church PE because the
[43:35] whole thing is about
[43:38] religion the whole thing is about
[43:40] religion the whole thing about breaking
[43:43] peace over there in Israel because
[43:45] Israel thought it was
[43:47] peace peace between all the
[43:50] churches one uni uni United Catholic
[43:54] Church did you did you know you a
[44:02] Catholic
[44:03] Hallelujah woo but this is also the day
[44:08] of the anointing of
[44:10] Enoch Hallelujah remember Amen in Noah's
[44:14] day amen everybody was doing all kinds
[44:17] of stuff they were so dissatisfied they
[44:19] were marrying giving in marriage you
[44:21] know banqueting you know everything
[44:23] party hardy they were doing all those
[44:25] things and the whole time the ark was
[44:27] being
[44:28] built isn't that true the whole time the
[44:32] world is doing all the
[44:35] stuff naming their
[44:38] Idols come on somebody in the whole time
[44:41] God's
[44:42] building building the ark
[44:44] Hallelujah they don't see it they don't
[44:47] know it amen but the children of light
[44:50] do Hallelujah remember brother BR was
[44:53] basically saying listen this is the
[44:55] spirit of Elijah
[44:56] and I'm trying to call the churches back
[44:58] to repentance like Elijah tried to call
[45:01] Israel back to repentance he said listen
[45:04] listen that's why brother said he said
[45:05] I'm not going to keep it a secret
[45:06] anymore he said it's too late in the
[45:08] evening he said they're worshiping the
[45:11] devil thinking they worshiping God now
[45:13] where did he get that in the scripture
[45:15] because Israel was doing the same thing
[45:18] they were calling on bail thinking that
[45:21] they were worshiping God they were under
[45:23] a strong delusion and Elijah tried to
[45:27] pull him back to the right God because
[45:30] baale means
[45:33] Lord
[45:34] hallelujah and Lord is Lord hallelujah
[45:37] so they were saying Lord to bail but he
[45:40] saying it's the wrong Lord
[45:42] hallelujah that's what he's trying to
[45:44] tell us all this thing this trinitarian
[45:46] Lord is the wrong
[45:51] Lorden tried to call him back and he
[45:53] says okay I'll tell you what to do you
[45:54] cut yourself you just have one of those
[45:56] big parties that you've been doing and
[45:58] he said maybe your God
[46:01] asleep he showed us the fanaticism that
[46:05] will occur in the denomination of
[46:07] churches because they're trying to get
[46:09] an answer from their
[46:13] God under the inspiration of the voice
[46:17] of
[46:18] Elijah they're doing all kinds of
[46:21] stuff
[46:23] Hallelujah but here the Bri of Jesus
[46:26] Christ that's what he said all of you
[46:28] who was on the Lord's Side come on over
[46:31] here hallelujah and he basically built
[46:35] that altar he poured so much water on it
[46:38] amen there was no way amen it could have
[46:40] United Hallelujah but God sat it a fire
[46:44] and licked it all up sh that God is
[46:46] going to give us a flooding of the rain
[46:49] Hallelujah he's going to give a flood
[46:51] rain Hallelujah and when the fire come
[46:53] down we'll go up with the fire
[46:59] hallelujah hallelujah look at that thing
[47:03] hallelujah we're in a time of sodom's
[47:06] day perfect
[47:08] lawlessness Nations all over the world
[47:10] has become that and think you think it's
[47:12] strange I heard on the news today that
[47:15] 50% of America now believes that
[47:17] same-sex marriage is okay
[47:23] 50% hello no
[47:29] 50% so what I'm saying is we beyond
[47:33] Sodom we're Beyond Noah's day we're
[47:36] Beyond it's worse than it's ever been
[47:39] you better believe
[47:43] it we're in a time of Pharaoh's day is
[47:46] that right the Bible said Rose of a
[47:48] pharaoh that didn't know Joseph who do
[47:50] you think your president is he don't
[47:52] know him he don't know God hallelujah
[47:55] neither does he know God's

[48:15] even thinking about flesh even though
[48:17] I'm calling names I want you to know all
[48:19] these Spirits are here and if these
[48:21] Spirits are here the spirit of God must
[48:24] be
[48:26] it has to be because the Bible said when
[48:29] Satan comes in like a flood the spirit
[48:31] of God lifts up a
[48:34] standard
[48:37] Hallelujah that's right amen and what
[48:40] did he do amen he had no respect this
[48:42] Pharaoh for God's chosen people is that
[48:45] right no he didn't he his whole his
[48:48] whole the end of the whole thing was
[48:50] let's go kill them

[48:56] turn with me now second
[49:01] Corinthians living at a time we when
[49:04] it's scary to me I don't know about you

[49:11] and mind uh not because I'm just getting
[49:14] older but I realize it's imminent if the
[49:17] Raptor don't take place one the other
[49:19] one will y'all hear what I'm saying and
[49:22] and I'm constantly thinking praying
[49:24] every day God is my witness I got to be
[49:27] ready I got to be ready that's all that
[49:30] matters to me nothing else matters to
[49:37] me 1 Corinthians
[49:40] 6 beginning at the 14th word
[49:43] verse says be not be not unequally
[49:46] yolked together with
[49:48] unbelievers for what Fellowship have
[49:50] righteousness with
[49:52] unrighteousness and what communion have
[49:54] light with dark Darkness we we will walk
[49:57] over that scripture we just walk all
[49:59] over it and what Concord ha Christ with
[50:06] bah what Accord we're not on one Accord
[50:10] what Accord does does does does Christ
[50:12] have with bah or what part had he that
[50:15] believeth with an
[50:18] Infidel how we don't walk together with
[50:20] with an
[50:21] Infidel and what agreement have the
[50:23] temple of God here it is
[50:26] with
[50:29] Idols yeah you know y'all heard about
[50:31] Beyonce uhhuh y'all y'all what are the a
[50:34] lot of these names shouldn't even come
[50:35] out of our our
[50:37] mouths they're
[50:39] Idols you can't be a chrisan and
[50:42] admiring something of the
[50:46] world you know if you're going to speak
[50:48] you speak the truth of them that there
[50:50] must not be some
[50:53] admiration what agreement have the
[50:55] temple of God with Idols for ye are the
[50:58] Temple of the Living God there is no
[51:01] other Temple there is no other go place
[51:04] where God abide except in the hearts of
[51:08] man and God have said I will dwell in
[51:11] them walk in them I will be their God
[51:15] and they shall be my people Children of
[51:18] the light hopeing
[51:23] God nowhere near be a
[51:27] same come on somebody do you remember
[51:31] the prophet of God said amen that that
[51:33] the Catholic church is the highest form
[51:35] of
[51:36] spiritualism it ain't that fellow am man
[51:38] with the witch bones rling his
[51:42] toys hallelujah it's the one dressed up
[51:45] like
[51:46] priests
[51:48] holy going into into the depths of Satan
[51:51] Hallelujah you better believe he's got
[51:53] to be powerful because amen he so
[51:55] powerful he'll get a greater demon than
[52:00] Beyonce he get the Beast he get the real
[52:02] thing he get he get Satan
[52:05] himself and here we can't even get the
[52:07] Holy
[52:10] Ghost come on you know what it is
[52:13] because those people about that business
[52:16] every day they're seeking ways amen if
[52:19] they got to fast 40 days to let a demon
[52:22] come in they'll do it did y'all know
[52:25] that that's what they do they get out of
[52:28] themselves now we don't have to go that
[52:31] measure but my point is our way of
[52:33] getting the Holy Ghost is
[52:36] simpler just saying Lord I surrender all
[52:40] and really believe really mean it Lord I
[52:43] don't even know what all is but whatever
[52:45] it is you know all is all I surrender
[52:48] all and that's what I want I want your
[52:49] Holy
[52:52] Spirit Hallelujah is that okay now we
[52:55] look look at this thing and you saywell
[52:57] brother Brooks what we we're Spirit of
[52:59] ant luian day is the same brother BR
[53:01] said that was the age amen when men's
[53:03] achievements was highly recognized far
[53:06] beyond beyond
[53:07] God's is that right it was it was man's
[53:10] achievement man's flesh amen
[53:12] counterfeiting things and making things
[53:15] and it was all man that's why when God
[53:18] came down in Noah and bought built this
[53:20] little Ark they must have laughed that's
[53:23] all your education can produce
[53:27] you know what I'm saying it had to be
[53:29] something on that on that wise he had
[53:30] looked like a fool I don't care what
[53:33] these movies are showing amen these
[53:34] people dressed all primitive and didn't
[53:36] know what they were doing brother
[53:37] brandom says Amen in in this day uh This
[53:40] Day scriptures fulfill he said they were
[53:42] far more Highly Educated way above us
[53:45] and that's what's wrong with our
[53:46] scientist they don't want to acknowledge
[53:48] it and they know the Egyptians and all
[53:51] of them were far more Highly Educated
[53:54] than we are looking at these pyramids
[53:56] built on one end of the the scope of the
[53:59] world to the other end and underwater
[54:01] and above water and they they know we
[54:03] can't do it to this
[54:06] day yeah a hurricane come by there they
[54:08] ain't moving them
[54:10] bricks they ain't moving no Stones they
[54:13] so built in a
[54:15] way see
[54:18] math mathematically
[54:21] correct oh my God help us Lord amen and
[54:24] what was it amen all these Spirit are
[54:27] loosed on us and this is what we talking
[54:29] about amen the river of
[54:31] Euphrates the Bible said amen in World
[54:34] War I
[54:35] all those demons was
[54:37] loosed the bride and herself had not
[54:40] even been recognized as a bride yeah
[54:42] World War I but they were loosed and
[54:44] they were waiting for come on you got to
[54:47] realize this now because that's exactly
[54:49] what they were doing Amen in the old
[54:51] they waited waited oh it's got to come
[54:54] we'll see the the evidence of her being
[54:56] here and when she comes we'll get
[54:58] her see God comes along in in this
[55:03] little KY and and and you know slowly
[55:05] moved him up the up the line like it did
[55:07] Moses they didn't even realize it amen
[55:11] come on somebody and then we look at
[55:13] this thing and here now they seeing this
[55:15] seven seal don't you think if the
[55:18] astrologist saw the birth of William
[55:21] brandham you better believe the Catholic
[55:23] Church saw the move of those seven
[55:26] angels they know we're
[55:30] right
[55:33] yeah but just like those of the of the
[55:36] of the New Testament let's kill him so
[55:39] that we can inherit him his
[55:42] inheritance they knew Jesus but they
[55:45] said let's kill him so we can inherit
[55:48] his
[55:49] inheritance they wanted the church when
[55:51] the church belonged to him they want the
[55:54] bride they'll never get her though
[55:57] Hallelujah Satan wanted us from the
[55:59] beginning of time Hallelujah but he
[56:01] can't get us why because God hid Us in
[56:05] the last book of life brother brand said
[56:07] Not only did God choose us he saved us
[56:10] and he sealed us before the foundation
[56:13] of the world so am I you going to be oh
[56:15] Lord I hope I get to seal if you were
[56:17] sealed before the foundation of the
[56:18] world you'll be sealed before it's all
[56:21] over withen in the eyes of God you
[56:23] sealed amen hallu that's just the way it
[56:27] is hallelujah God the Bible said God
[56:30] once wink that ignorance God don't wink
[56:32] that ignorance no more and you know God
[56:34] don't care whether we believe it in he
[56:36] don't care there's billions of people in
[56:39] Hell who who didn't
[56:41] believe they didn't believe Jesus was
[56:43] the Christ so what you think about
[56:45] William
[56:46] brandom they don't believe that he was a
[56:48] prophet they don't even care you know or
[56:52] he was too hard on
[56:53] women
[56:55] I don't mean no harm sisters but don't
[56:58] you think it was a woman that got us in
[57:01] trouble I don't mean is the truth she
[57:04] was the one that let down to God and
[57:07] because of that that's why God's hard on
[57:09] her that's why she's so emotional
[57:11] because that's where Satan worked on
[57:15] at it's not that you you you know God
[57:18] think of you less but he knows the
[57:22] abilities that's it he don't think no
[57:25] less he just know the ability of us to
[57:27] move you know you to move into into
[57:29] those emotional Realms and you know
[57:31] that's why man and woman anden we have a
[57:33] hard time because the woman is emotional
[57:35] man is not and the he don't know he
[57:37] don't understand he's just don't and
[57:39] he's he thinking is all that
[57:42] necessary but that's just the way we
[57:45] made it up we can't help
[57:47] [Laughter]
[57:51] it you know but my point is this let let
[57:54] me move on we're living in a time where
[57:59] everything has been revealed if you and
[58:03] I miss the Rapture it's nobody fault but
[58:05] our
[58:05] own you can't blame God he done gave you
[58:08] more than enough right we allow things
[58:11] to distract us understand we shouldn't
[58:13] do that because that was a sign of of of
[58:17] of Miss
[58:19] lot she allowed herself to be distracted
[58:23] at the wrong time
[58:25] it was time to go up and she was being
[58:28] distracted see what I'm saying she was
[58:30] already
[58:32] ascending and she allowed herself to be
[58:35] distracted y'all hear what I'm saying
[58:38] and that's what it is God is building
[58:39] your character and everything else it's
[58:41] not time to be
[58:44] distracted because if so you get left
[58:47] behind hello is that all right I'm
[58:50] almost closed with this uh we'll finish
[58:52] this on Sunday but I wanted to wanted to
[58:55] say this by the grace of God because
[58:56] there's a lot more to it uh but I wanted
[58:59] to kind of like put it all together uh
[59:02] with this one scripture Hebrews 12:25
[59:05] we'll let you go early
[59:10] tonight you love God I people of God we
[59:14] we're blessed we we're so blessed let me
[59:17] let me say something happened to me
[59:18] today a brother called me from South
[59:20] Carolina a young brother I knew him when
[59:22] he's a boy and I missed his call but he
[59:24] left it on the voicemail he said brother
[59:26] books he said he said I he said I I just
[59:28] wanted to call you to let you know how
[59:30] much I appreciate your messages online
[59:33] he said I have been revived so many
[59:35] great things have happened because I
[59:38] have been able to listen to the messages
[59:40] online I don't know whether they still
[59:41] moving or not but I just say I if we
[59:44] could get them going because other
[59:46] people have called as well and you know
[59:48] what gets me most of us don't even
[59:50] listen to
[59:52] him but that's okay God got got somebody
[59:55] that's going to listen and you got to
[59:57] understand this particular young man was
[59:59] trapped in a situation that God is TR to
[1:00:01] deliver him
[1:00:08] from see Satan sat Satan want to hinder
[1:00:11] us he want to stop us because he we
[1:00:13] don't realize the magnitude of what's
[1:00:15] really going on you know I say this even
[1:00:17] from my little CS that you'd be
[1:00:19] surprised all over the world even the Cs
[1:00:22] that I didn't even like people
[1:00:25] are liking and believing and
[1:00:28] enjoying y'all hear what I'm saying you
[1:00:31] you do a little put a little bread upon
[1:00:33] the Water the Bible said it'll come
[1:00:36] back it's the little things that God
[1:00:39] call
[1:00:40] Great and and I think people missing it
[1:00:43] it ain't about a name it's not even
[1:00:45] about a position it's just doing what
[1:00:47] God want you to do that's what God
[1:00:49] called Meek doing the will of God that's
[1:00:51] God's meekness that's your meekness in
[1:00:53] God doing what God asked you to do
[1:00:56] that's it it that's
[1:00:58] it Hebrews 12 closing on
[1:01:04] this
[1:01:09] 25 see that you refuse not him that
[1:01:14] speaketh but if they escape not who
[1:01:16] refus him that spake on Earth much more
[1:01:20] shall not we escape if we turn away from
[1:01:25] him that speaketh from
[1:01:28] heaven and God spoke from Heaven those
[1:01:32] Seven Seals Came From Heaven Hallelujah
[1:01:35] come on somebody amen and didn't he say
[1:01:38] God was going to shake the Heaven and
[1:01:39] Earth when those seals God blasted and
[1:01:42] said the Judgment going to hit uh uh the
[1:01:45] West Coast amen it shook Heaven and
[1:01:47] Earth people don't understand what day
[1:01:49] we're living in that scripture has been
[1:01:52] fulfilled and is being fulfilled
[1:01:55] right
[1:01:56] now people look at a little Kentucky and
[1:01:59] they fail to see by the grace of God it
[1:02:01] wasn't a man it was God behind the man
[1:02:07] veiled but he's given them a strong
[1:02:11] delusion people in here have the you
[1:02:13] know they they let their minds blind
[1:02:15] them even when it comes to the pastor
[1:02:19] preaching is it Pastor Brooks or is it
[1:02:22] God if it's the word is God you know and
[1:02:26] my thing is God Amen is moving and
[1:02:28] trying to get the people Amen to a place
[1:02:30] H I don't know how you've pressing but
[1:02:32] I'm pressing and it doesn't get
[1:02:38] easy it will not and it does not get
[1:02:40] easy but let me ask you a question
[1:02:43] though will it be worth it
[1:02:51] all you think to yourself it's worth it
[1:02:54] all every pain every whatever I go
[1:02:58] through it's going to be worth it all
[1:03:00] because I'm going tell you something
[1:03:01] people let me say like this i' I've
[1:03:04] heard so many
[1:03:05] people you gonna always owe somebody you
[1:03:09] just try to do what you can do to pay
[1:03:10] him right right you I'm saying that's
[1:03:13] the system the system is you gonna
[1:03:16] always owe somebody I don't care if you
[1:03:18] got billions of dollars you going to owe
[1:03:22] somebody you going to die oing somebody
[1:03:26] because people that got a lot of money
[1:03:27] they don't always pay their
[1:03:29] bills why should they when they got a
[1:03:31] lot of
[1:03:34] money y'all hear what I'm saying you
[1:03:36] gonna always oh that what brother say he
[1:03:39] said just let the people know you gonna
[1:03:40] pay and the Bible said owe no man
[1:03:42] nothing in this system is impossible not
[1:03:45] to owe anybody know what I'm talking
[1:03:47] about you know unless you're going to
[1:03:49] live way out in the country you got your
[1:03:50] own
[1:03:51] well you got your own little mortal
[1:03:54] thing a going on with your
[1:03:55] electricity you really out there in the
[1:03:58] wilderness and guess what more than
[1:04:00] likely you're going to have to pay
[1:04:02] taxes y'all hear what I'm saying you go
[1:04:04] ow somebody nothing's
[1:04:07] free so why did I'm saying all that
[1:04:09] because I'm saying to you do your best
[1:04:12] but don't let these things consume you
[1:04:14] till it take you off the purpose for
[1:04:17] which you were
[1:04:18] born takes you away from that you're not
[1:04:21] supposed to be taken away not at this
[1:04:23] day and time not at this day and time
[1:04:26] and I'm not saying say quas I'm not
[1:04:28] saying that whatever will be will be but
[1:04:30] I'm point trying to say do the best but
[1:04:33] when you know you've done your best you
[1:04:35] say thank you and Hallelujah
[1:04:39] anyhow am I making sense don't worry
[1:04:42] it's not time to worry I mean we've got
[1:04:44] to have faith in God have faith and
[1:04:47] enjoy your this portion of your
[1:04:53] salvation let us stand it's true that's
[1:04:56] all I'm trying to say don't let the
[1:04:58] devil take your joy don't let him take
[1:04:59] away you know what God done gave to you
[1:05:02] you know this thing is is a beautiful
[1:05:05] situation amen you think about it and
[1:05:08] I'm going tell you something you look at
[1:05:09] Peter James John when they thrown into
[1:05:10] jail and prison amen and you know those
[1:05:13] those were real
[1:05:15] prisons they were
[1:05:17] real there was no luxury nothing
[1:05:19] luxurious about that and I understand
[1:05:22] that you know the Roman jails were worse
[1:05:24] in all
[1:05:26] jails and they got in there praising God
[1:05:29] and thanking the lord and the angel came
[1:05:31] down shook the shook the foundation and
[1:05:34] it now that was yesterday and and and
[1:05:37] less than two days
[1:05:40] ago and if God did it for them he'll do
[1:05:43] it for
[1:05:44] us but our attitude must measure up meet
[1:05:47] up to what God would have us to do you
[1:05:49] see Praise Him in all situation yes you
[1:05:53] going to have those things they hit you
[1:05:54] real hard but at the same time once you
[1:05:56] regroup you go back to worship
