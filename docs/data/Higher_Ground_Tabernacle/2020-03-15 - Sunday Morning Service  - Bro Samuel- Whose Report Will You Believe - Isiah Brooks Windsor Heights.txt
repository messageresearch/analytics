amen amen we thank the Lord for bringing us in his house this morning I mean how many are looking forward to hear from the Lord we don't come looking forward to hear from a man but we come looking to hear from God what's we just standing let us open our Bibles to the book of numbers numbers chapter 13 we'll read verse one in verse two whilst we're standing and then the rest wants to be seated let us just spray before we read the Evan Lee father we approach the throne of grace and mercy this morning father thinking you father for bringing us in your house you said in your word wherever two or three are gathered in my name is you said you will be there so we don't have to wait for any any feeling or anything because we know Lord that our feelings may deceive us but we know that your word will never deceive us and when you speak a word it will never return to you back void but after it has accomplished that which you have sent it for now we are standing on that word knowing that you you are in our midst I just pray our Father God that when you make yourself known in our merest touch the hearts that need to be tired father give answers to those Lord that has to be answered I do not know Lord what the children want but you do know father God and you promise that that you will supply it according to all our needs or father God according to your riches and glory I just pray O God this morning that may you come down speak to your children in a mighty way speak to us Oh father it may your anointing be in our midst so that in the end of it all we might say for sure Lord you spoke unto us with no shadow of doubt now as we're reading your word father gotta pray that you give inspiration to it in Jesus Christ's name I pray believing saying thank you lord amen let us read the Book of Numbers chapter 13 verse 1 and 2 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying send our men that they may search the land of Canaan which I give unto thee I wish I give unto the children of Israel of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man everyone a ruler among them may take our seat we're going to read further down the chapter here we'll look at our the LORD commanded Moses he is saying send one representative from all the tribes of the children of Israel so he is sending 12 spies to go spy the land of Canaan we all know the story and they all went to see this promised land that God had already promised their father Abraham to see how it was like before they went to go and overcome it because they were told that for each and every ground that God promised them they had to fight they had to fight and go get it so before they went for it they were sending spies to go and see how the land is like so they probably know how to to fight what strategies to use so they sent 12 men that were representing the two million children of Israel let us go down to verse 30 let's started 31 actually but the men who went up with him and said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature and there we saw the Giants the sons of anak which come of the Giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight so this is the report the other 10 men are giving they're saying we cannot take it it's just too much we're gonna get these people will just part us to them would look like grasshoppers and they are giants so we cannot go and take it but let's take a reading at verse 30 verse 30 and kaleb's till the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to Oh commit you see this man were looking at their physical stature they were looking at their physical abilities and in abilities that's what discouraged them but we look at Calif he is a different kind altogether he saw the man but he was not looking at that he was looking at the promise that God gave because he knew that God never fails in any of his promises and he knew that this was a land that God had promised Abraham their forefathers so he knew that God is able to do what he promises and now these 10 men they say we cannot go to take this land because it's a land of giants so we cannot do it this is this is a mission impossible and look they're saying and there we saw Giants the sons of anak which come of the Giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and they're saying we cannot do it because they are the sons of anak let us look at verse 22 to see how many would the sons of anak verse 22 says and they ascended by the south and came unto he born where a he-man she shy and Tom I the children of anak were how many how many names did we read here a he-man she shy and tommye the children of anak were just three just three children of anak but now they're saying they don't come in they don't come and say we saw three children of anak they say we saw giants children of anak we cannot we are not able to take it so they're giving a false report because the the the hosts of Israel was two million people and they were supposed to go and fight and get the land but he's saying well they sold three people they are saying because of these three we cannot go do it so they were giving a false report so this morning we just want to talk for a little bit on the subject who's the report will you believe so this is what we are seeing Caleb was not looking at the physical other physical limitations he was looking at the promise of God because God promised Abraham he said I'm giving you this land and your seed shall possess it so that's what they were looking at you see when God gives a promise no matter how things look like he is going to shift things around to make sure that promise comes to pass look at Abraham he was given the Abraham and Sarah and they were given a promise of a son but they were old in their 90's and hundreds they were not able to conceive and get a baby but because God had kept a promise it had to happen so he had to recondition their bodies to make them younger so that they could so that he could perform his promise to them so this is what God does no matter how things look like no matter what his situation looks like look into the word his promises will never fail his word is not going to change but it is you who's going to change so that the word can be made accomplished to you amen so we ought to have faith like Caleb another prophet of God tells us that Caleb is a he's the type of the Gentiles and we are the Gentiles the Gentile faith it is known to be the strongest faith in the Bible so that's what we ought to do we don't look at what things at what circumstances tell us we look at what the word says we look at the promises of what God say to us amen because you see the devil tries to make that he tries to put that fear in you because he knows the moment you realize what you can do its trouble to him so that's why he tries to give you this false report and try to make you fear because fear is the greatest weapon that the devil uses look what's happening out here in the media everybody is so scared I mean people have been having flu I mean who hasn't had flu in their whole life everyone did but look at what what what fear is doing to people that's the greatest fear that's the greatest tool that the devil uses because he knows if you are not afraid you are going he's going to be in trouble so the devil is already afraid of you because he already knew he already knows what you hold he already knows who you are for example let's take a look at just read chapter 2 you don't have to open it though just to chapter 2 all of you read verse 9 to 11 it says this is this was a Rahab she says she said unto the men I know that the Lord had given you the land and that your terror is falling upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the sea of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt and what he did unto the 2 kings of the amorite and we're on the other side of Jordan Sehun and AAG whom he utterly destroyed and as soon as we heard these things our hearts did melt needed neither did there remain any hope courage any more courage in any man because of you for the Lord your God He is God in heaven above and in the earth beneath so you see the enemy already knows they know your testimonies so they are scared the enemy is already scared of you but it's not what the devil tries to do he's trying to make you fear so that you do not overcome him because he knows he knows what you are holding so that's why he tries to to bring things around you and you you know you are scared and you don't get to do anything about it but now if you get to know that the devil is already afraid of you there won't be anything that can stop you and you will stop living under your own privileges because you know the power that you have you know the authority that God plays in your hand and you know what God can do for you so we gotta you gotta learn to refuse the devil's report and I believe the report of God because what everything that the devil says is a lie the devil is never tells you the truth if you say something is up to something you take if he say something take the opposite of that because the devil always lie his report is always false and we gotta take God's report a man we readin the Bible of a man code we know Hezekiah he was an arm he was sent a letter by the king of Assyria his name was a Sennacherib and he was sent a letter and it was threatening him and he was saying I'm coming to destroy you you and your land and in that letter he wrote a lot of things and he wrote all the names of the kings that he had overcame he wrote a list of all the kingdoms he had utterly destroyed and he sent it to Hezekiah and he said he sent it with a message and he said I'm coming for you Hezekiah opened it and he saw it it was true and he knew that this man is coming for him but he looked at it and he decided that I'm taking this report as a false one and he took it into the house of the Lord and he went to God and he said Lord read what Sennacherib has said but I'm not believing it I'm believing in your word because he knew the promise that Ezra had been given that they shall be no enemy that will stand before you so he knelt he went to the house of God and he gave the letter to God and he said lord please read this and then after he prayed God sent a prophet to - here's a kind he said I have heard your prayer hallelujah that's what we ought to do bring whatever problem you have into the house of the Lord if you lost your job Yury take that as a false report and you say to God I know this is what they are saying but no I don't believe it I am believing what you say Amen because the Lord says I know that thoughts that I have for you thoughts for you to prosper those that are good for you amen this is what God has for us so even if you are sick the depth the the doctor give you the doctor gives you a letter it has all this disease in it you say okay that's what their machines are saying but this is not what God says you bring it into the house of the Lord you look at the report at God's report God's report says that you are healed you were healed 2000 years ago and but now the doctors report is saying he was sick so you have to decide which report you believe just believe on God's report and he will never fail we have seen him in all history that he has always come through hallelujah so you have to come to a point in time where you have to choose which which report to believe God will never fail you amen because we know the promise that was given to Abraham like we were saying the other day that Abraham's the promise was not to Abraham only but it was given to the seed of Abraham naturally and spiritually so the promise that was given to Abraham he says thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy so that's that promise already is going to whether you are capable or not that promise is going to condition you for you to be able to possess the gates of the enemy we look at our Shanga there is not even a lot that is reading about Shamgar in the Bible his name is just mentioned twice he was not even a warrior but one time he was there he was a farmer he was not even he was not even a trained soldier he was there he was a farmer and then one day older the Philistines had been had been taking the the children of Israel for granted every time they would plant their harvest and everything after they after they harvest it then they'll just come and take everything and go back with it and feed their families so the children of Israel were just working and things were just being stolen from them their produce but one day Shambo was looking at his family his daughter was so skinny she wasn't having enough food and the wife is right there they have no food they just have whatever they had just they had just garden then he is standing right there he's since the Philistines coming to the prophecy he was dramatised and he says he was telling by the window he souls he sees a six hundred Philistines coming towards him then he looks at them then he looks at his family then he says no not today that's a false report I'm looking at what God said and he remembered what God said to Abraham he says your seed shall possess the gate of the enemy so he looked at his blood and his blood told him that he was he was Abraham's seed so he said whether I'm a soldier or not whether I have the training or not I am going anyhow that blood is going to keep me because God is bound to keep his word because if anything was going if anything was going to happen to Shamgar he was going to go back to God and say you didn't keep your word so he was just throwing himself they had the enemy he knew that victory was certain he knew that God is able to keep his word so he took whatever that was closest there was an ox God you know he's just a small stick that has a small meadow at the end and he took it and he jumped out of the window and he went and he smote 600 trained trained soldiers who had who had been in the Army for so many years but this was just a farmer because he realized that God keeps his word and he took what the devil was bringing to him as a false report and he says I'm only believing what God says and God says I shall possess all the gates of the enemy so that's what you gotta do you're gonna come to a point in time where you gonna have where you're gonna have to stand those circumstances you're gonna have to stand and you take it back to the enemy because sham goers not just being defensive he had to go on the offensive that's that's what that's how that's how worry is like so you gotta choose anything that comes your way you gotta choose with how you want to PLASA fie it as a false report or as a true report a man is all right because we have the power when God gave us the Holy Ghost in the book of Acts he essayed after the Holy Ghost has come upon you you shall receive power what's that power to do it is to withstand all the forces of Satan you see many people think that when you receive the Holy Ghost life is now easy no sir when you receive the Holy Ghost that's you have just declared war a man when you receive the Holy Ghost you have drawn enemy lines with the devil because before you received it you are on the same side with him he really didn't have a reason to fight you but now when you have decided to say I'm following Christ I am now saved this is what I want to do you have drawn a line to say Satan we are no longer on the same side so you have declared war so when you decide to serve Christ you know that it is now a time of war with the devil so if the warfare is not a picnic that's what it is we gotta you gotta stand and fight you see and how do we fight you know the devil he always tries to stop us from praying because the prophet of God tells us that prayer is the most powerful weapon that God placed in the hands of man he said it's greater than an atomic bomb when you know the power of an atomic bomb and he says prayer is greater than that gentleman's shift things change Hezekiah changed the mind of God with prayer prayer is the most powerful thing so Satan knows that prayer is powerful so that's why he's gonna stop you from praying the prophet of God says when the weakest Christian kneels down to pray they're able to shake hail all the demons they are gonna shake if the weakest Christian kneels down to pray so you don't have to worry about much if you just know you are desiring to serve the Lord and you know in your heart you are a Christian don't let the devil tell you you are not a pastor you're not a deacon or you don't have so much experience in the word just by be a Christian you have the ability to shake the foundations of hell because that's the Word of God so that's why Satan tries to stop you from praying listening to the word reading the word because he knows that's where your power that's where your power comes from and he knows that's where his destruction comes from you see many times you try to wake up in the middle of the night you try to wake up and pray then you set an alarm you wake up your snoozy do you say you have five minutes it's probably three in the money you snows you say I'll wake up in five minutes time I have the whole night is yes too early you snooze that alarm until you wake up in the morning and you never did pray it happens a lot too many of us right it's why it's the devil he's trying to stop you from praying because you know the moment you start praying he is in trouble many times when you start praying that's when you get destructions your phone goes off or suddenly you have something very important to do it's because he's trying to stop you from praying because he knows when you start praying it's too late for him so we gotta be we gotta get up our loins and always stand fast and we gotta be offensive no defense if you do not win a war by being defensive you gotta be offensive look at the what happened at Pearl Harbor you see that's what the devil does he tries to sneak up on you when you are least expecting it the Japanese they launched there they launched their their airplanes their of their fighter jets and everything and the US wasn't even expecting it they thought maybe they were going to attack their resources maybe in the Philippines or Southeast Asia that's what they were thinking they were like they are not coming here so they were not even prepared for it and then just one morning bombs are dropped and they're and they're in trouble that's exactly what the devil does because they were waiting you are defense waiting for the enemy to come to you you do not do that you go into the enemy's camp you have to take the fight to the enemy they had to realize that for us to win this war we have to go fight that's why you see the Hiroshima and Nagasaki thing they had to you had to be offensive that's how you win a war so the devil tries to attack you once you are relaxing because you don't see it coming that's why we gotta stand fast keep on praying and be on our knees because he is so sneaky and he is just he's a bluff he is not he is not for real the Bible says he's he's like a roaring lion seeking whom he made before he is like a roaring lion not air but he is like a roaring lion so he is just a bluff he is not a lion he's not dangerous at all if you gotta realize that then you will stop living under your own privileges and the devil he is so persistent he don't stop until he gets you he does not stop at all and you also you are not supposed to stop resisting imagine for how long for six thousand years the devil has been trying to disrupt God's plan he knows he's not ever gonna overcome but somehow he just can't stop if if a Christian could have if a Christian could have as much persistence as the devil has we wouldn't we wouldn't have many problems we'll always be victorious if you fall down get back up if you fall down get back up you know you are going to stand it because you have a promise so the devil is so persistent but you also resist because the scripture says resist the devil and he will flee away from you so the more he is persistent you resist he is persistent you resist because the God keeps his word resist the devil and eventually he's going to flee away and but he's gonna come back again with another method so we gotta make sure we know that we have the power resist the forces of the devil because we have a promise that was given to us to our feather a brother Abraham that we have to possess all the gates of the enemy hallelujah and nothing can go against us I read what the prophet of God says who says refused to sign anything the devil brings he will have to take it back say I refuse to have it I just won't have it no sir he will have to take it back in the name of the Lord if you believe it and confess it and say I've accept Jesus Christ as my healer there is no affliction or disease can stay on you stay right with it so that's what you got to do you got to come to a point where you refuse it and you say no I don't accept it I am only accepting what Jesus Christ says when the devil brings to you sickness you look at the sickness and you say no I do not receive it Christ died for me not that I'm going to be healed but I was already healed 2,000 years ago you see because it was already done once you just have to do is receive it take it and apply to yourself because it was already done you because he was bruised for our iniquities all your sins that you did and you are going to do they were already forgiven for you just have to accept Christ as forgiveness and take it and apply it to you for it to be for you to be a effective I'll read another quote as well it's a symptoms they're lying vanities don't receive them don't have nothing to do with them if you look to them you're looking away from God we look at the unseen not at what we see no one could look at what they see and be a Christian you have got to believe that things that's unseen for is by faith you are healed not by sight or by feeling what if someone came up in the morning to you to your door Express agent and throw you a whole basket full of rattlesnakes and had your name on them said here they are they're yours you know they you know they are they're just like you know your symptoms are there if you receive them they're yours but you don't have to take them you can say I don't want them if they's a package does deliver at your door it has your name on it and your address is it and you know that's your name and that's your address that package is not yours until you sign for it you can deny it and you say take it back I don't want it yeah and then you take it back it's no longer yours although it has your name on it so it's just your duty you see you refuse it it's just that simple amen when you see something coming your way it is directed to you you say no I refuse it the doctor's report says I have cancer yes it has my name on it yes your machines say that but it is not mine until I accept it and you know what I am NOT deciding to accept it right now so you take it back because it is not mine that's how simple you gotta take it it is that simple and they say your names on them you say I don't want them I won't have them he can stand there and argue as much as he wants to you but until you take them and sign for them they belong to the Express company until you sign for them don't sign for nothing the devil brings everything the devil brings to you is a lie and it's meant for your detriment the devil is not your friend he is an enemy no matter house and the devil is a smooth talker too no matter how smooth he tries to talk you into it and tries to reason do not accept it it's the devil it's not good for you you see many times the devil is so slick he makes you think that it's yourself telling you that he comes through reasoning uses your five senses and reasoning you look at it and you say but you know what well I think just accepted this that's what it is you know us Matic you got diabetes like yeah this I just gotta accept it you know but no don't it's not yourself who's telling you that anything that's negative is is the devil he brings to you he talks to you through your reasoning through your imagination and you think you are having a conversation with yourself but if you no you are not you are having a conversation with the devil so he's gonna make you think that you are the one who came up with that but it's not it was him so you gotta realize oh you gotta realize all the tactics the prophet of God says overcoming is really recognizing the devil or his techniques so the moment you realize that that's your first step in overcoming you just have to say no it's the devil I see you not happening hallelujah that's what you gotta do he says date is though date is yes though I refuse to have it take it back have nothing to do with it if you won't testify that you've got it then when you testify you still have your sickness the devil keeps it with you but you refuse to testify you're fit say I won't have it no sir that's when you're getting faith your faith give give your faith a chance turn it loose and brittle let let it work you've got it all bound down with traditions turn it loose cut your faith loose let God have his way with that somebody's word is right either what you're looking at or what God says that's the two reports whose report are you gonna believe what you are seeing and in most cases the devil can fool the other five senses so most likely what you are seeing with your five senses the devil is showing it to you if it's not good for you is the devil so you gotta get you gotta put it away and take what God says for you amen either what you're looking at or what God says God's Word is true and always believe it alright but the first time you testify if you sickness it brings you right down to the realm again you sign for it refused to sign for it testify of what you believe so you see that's that's what the devil does he comes to you with the reasoning and the devil he he attacks believers in a different way you see you know many people we think we our our trials and temptations they are different from the rest of the worlds because we are believers the devil tempts you by the word and we are not altogether spiritual beings we have that natural aspect in that spiritual aspect and take for example of sickness heats your home or maybe you lose a job that's affecting your natural part but how is the devil gonna afflict you in that how is he trying you he's going to come to you when you are in that situation and he makes you look at the word you were sick probably can't pay the bills he lost his job and the devil is going to show you a scripture where he says many other afflictions of the righteous but God delivers out of them delivers them out of them all and he says what are you and he's tempting you using the word the devil uses a scripture that's out of season to tempt you that's how he get us using our five senses using reasoning you see the devil is the greatest theologian than all of us he's a had 6,000 years to study the Bible he knows it back to back through and through so you can never out quote the devil looking at the Bible he knows all of it he looked at Jesus he came to tempt Jesus when he came he said he he he told him you got the power turned the stones into bread and eat that's the temptation he was using and does the word say that yes Jesus had the power to do it but it was a scripture out of season and he all them he put him up he put him on a on a pinochle and he says cast yourself down they a God will send His angels before your foot - is the ground God will do that but that was a scripture out of season that's how the devil tempt us because that's that's our temptations that's how our temptations are different from anybody else and that's the most discouraging thing when you look at the word and it seems like it is not happening and it looks like God is not fulfilling his word so if you try to rely on your knowledge then yeah you are not going to outwit the devil by that you see the Bible tells us that do not reuse what you're going to say in the court of laws but the Holy Ghost is going to give you a Turin's that's why you got a that's why you you got a depend on the Holy Ghost many times you are seated right right that you don't know nothing but the Holy Ghost just drops the right scripture what you need right there and you know this is God so that's what you gotta depend on you gotta depend on God you see the devil uses a scripture out-of-season to tempt you that's the temptation of the word that's the temptation to the believer I can imagine Lazarus the beggar he was begging for bread I can imagine he looked at the scripture that says what David says I'm a young but now I'm old I've never seen the righteous begging for bread imagine what was going on through his mind he is begging and he's seeing that Scripture if it was any of us I mean then God is not keeping his word but we gotta be stronger and hold on fast and be like job and say even though he slay me I will still serve him hallelujah is that attitude you have towards God just like that Sarah Phoenician woman when God told her that I cannot give way I cannot give the bread of the children to the dogs you see she wasn't going to a priest she was going to Jesus the word itself she walked she went to the word flesh and she had a petition and the word said you are a dog but it was her attitude she said if this the word the word never lies and if the word is calling me a dog that's right I believe it and she said that's nothing but the truth and she accepted it it's her attitude and she ended up getting what she wanted because of her attitude towards the word she didn't let the devil take that because if it was any of us you call me a word a dog you see this is not even a priest but this is Jesus the word itself yeah I mean if it was any of us like right I'm out of here you see but it was here attitude towards the word and just holding on fast the prophet of God says I love God so much that even if he sends me to hell I would still love I'll still keep on loving him that's the attitude we gotta have and we will overcome the devil at all of his tricks and we know that that's what the devil is good at so we gotta keep on holding on and know that we gotta believe God's report and not the devil's report I'm gonna read our brother branham's own testimony he said he had a he had a stomach problem he says when I started to eat and swallow the first mouthful the doctor said one mouthful if he eats would be in digestion boy you'll die right now and I eat the beans and cornbread and onions yes sir I took in the house the blessing over it and got it in my mouth and chewed it up and swallowed it devil said you'll die and here it come right back up I held my hand over on my mouth swallowed it back again I said no sir ha ha I refuse no sir somebody's right either while my system says or what God says but I decide to look at what God is saying I went out on the street and the hard water running out of my mouth down my mouth as soon as soon as I was singing I can I will I do believe that jesus heals me now someone said how you feeling I wonderful you healed sure you how you feeling fine anything wrong nothing how you feeling fine are you healed sure you see he was looking at God's Word that I am already healed not at what his system was telling him is that right not what his five senses were telling him those symptoms because he knew that that's the realm that the devil operates with and that's why you gotta have the sixth sense faith the devil cannot get to that he can only affect this five and faith is the superior sense so when you have that sixth sense when the devil comes to try and talk to you to this five so the 6/10 was just told the other one shut up I'm the boss here and we are looking at what God says I stayed right with it day after day and week after week and I was healed one morning I believed in my to come at his word nobody ever cast it away from me but the word said so and the word of God will defeat Satan any place anytime anywhere and on any condition so you keep on believing it's going to turn out right anyway just keep on holding it you remember that that blind person who was prayed for he kept on saying I can see although his eyes were closed he kept on professing it he was not he was not believing what his sense of side was telling him his sense of side was telling you me you cannot see we cannot see nothing our eyes are blind but he says no I'm looking at the sixth sense the sixth sense tells me that I can see and he was believing on that he kept on believing it until God made him God answered his prayer and honored his faith and he's eyes open hidden he was saying so that's we got to do you got to be persistent Widow and just believe the word of God you believe God's report and he will never fail you just remember that anything the devil says to you it ain't true you gotta reject it amen I'm going to read you all know the story of David David and Goliath when David came he was coming from you he was coming from from the heading the Sheep and he was sent by his father to go I'll give his all the brothers food and then that's when he says Goliath he's trying to defy God the Living God amen and then he had to go fight I'm just gonna read through the story read our first Samuel 17 44 year and have to open it I'll read too fast and the Philistines say to David come to me and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field the scent first time in 1744 I'm going to 45 then say David to the Philistine thou comest to me with this word and with a spear and with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the god of the armies of Israel whom thou has defied this day will the Lord deliver thee into my hand and I will smite thee and take thy herd head from thee and I will give the carcass of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the Earth might know that there is a God in Israel I'll go to 51 and he says therefore David ran therefore David ran and stood up point the Philistine and took his sward and drew it out of the sheet thereof and slew him and cut off his head therewith so here if we look if if we look here the Philistine if we look at verse 44 Goliath says to David come to me and I will give that flesh to the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field but David refused it and in verse 46 he is taking back what Goliath I say to him he is taking it back to Goliath and he says no you are not going to cut my head but I am going to cut yours and I out if I will feed it to the beasts of the field so he was refusing Goliath he was refusing go Lions report and he says no I'm taking it back unto you and David was not waiting defensively waiting for Goliath to come to him and he can block him no he ran to Goliath because you know that's how you win war you you go offensive you be on the offensive not on the defensive and you take back what the enemy is saying to you those threats you take them back and that's how God will deliver you so here's a giant he is trying to here's a giant he's trying to - to defeat David but David is looking up unto unto God's Word he's remembering the testimonies that God had with him through him and he knows God cannot fail so he was confident you see this other soldiers soul and he's all the brothers they were scared they never had any experiences but because David had these experiences he knew God was gonna come through for him so that's why he he had the ability he had the guts to take back what the devil had say to him and send back the threats to the - Goliath and then he his lot he slew Goliath and cut off his herd and when the Philistines saw their champion was dead they all fled so he had victory he won who he wrought victories for the whole nation by defeating one man begins because he refused what Goliath has said and took it back to Goliath and then all the smaller Devils ran away from him after they saw that their captain had fallen I read another quote where brother branham he also had he also had a similar experience when he was in a prayer line and this manniac of Oregon wanted to come to him and he wanted to teach it to destroy him but he says no when the Spirit of God came upon him he says no I am not the one who's going to fall but you were going to fall at my feet and you said the man you say you snake in the grass I'm going to show you how much servant of God you are I'm going to knock you way out in the middle of that audience he said I'm going to knock you out the middle of the audience the speed of God's aid you fall over my feet this was not william branham speaking but it was God when God takes over you can rest rest assured because God never fails and he said I'll show you whose feet I'll fall over he drew back his arm to strike me and still there was no fear and I was in there because I wanted to be seen I was there with the commission from God to the people and when he started to strike something happened he said Satan leave this man and when it did his great eyes seemed to push out his teeth said together and he turned around and fell over fell over my feet till the policeman had to come and roll him off you see because I believe this was this was this was like a similar experience that happened to David because this man was this man was like a giant in these tranches he's trying to say you are going to fall over my feet and God now after God had taken over and God had taken control he says no you are going to follow my feet and a similar thing happened he says when he was speaking you could be he could have heard a pin drop the old saying is he says when all the Legion saw that their chief man had been slain every sick person rose to their feet every cot was empty every wheel chair emptied and the whole group was healed at one time and walked out so there never was a prayer line in this in this sermon it's because a similar thing happened when David slew Goliath all the Philistines ran away in this case I believe God is a God of presidents what he did before he can do it again so all the all the sick people all the quotes or the paralyzed people they just got healed instantly after this man fallen because the chiefest of them all was slayed so that's what you gotta do look for the chiefest demon in your life you slay it the rest of them will run away he's a god of presidents isn't he we said he did it in the Old Testament he did it in this age for our example so if you believe what God says take the enemy to the fight get on the offensive God is always God will always come true on his word and he will never fail you amen just go for that the bigger demon go for it don't be scared go for it attack him cut off his head fitted to the Beast and all the little devils will run away hallelujah that's why I believe God always if you look at what God did before he can do it again look at Auntie Jemima she looked into the Bible and she saw herself in there and she said Lord you did it for this woman I'm in the exact same position why not me and she was saying right there and God said well you have seen yourself I did it before I can do it again so just if you just have faith that $0.06 like that black David had you go take the fight to the enemy God will show up to brought you victory amen I want to say um I'm gonna give a little story I don't know I don't know if you ever heard it before it's about the owl the owl when it was um a couple of years back then so they say he was he used to lie to the birds of to all the birds and say I'm the king of the birds because I have horns you know you know the furthest that stand up like that and he said I'm the I'm the only bird that has got horns so I'm the king of the birds so he used to stand right there and send all the birds doing all his dirty work and everything find food for the owl and everything and he was standing right there and this keep kept on going for a very long time and then one little Robin one day it was just so the AH would sleep all day well they say that's the reason why he sleeps all day he would he was just sleeping all day lazy not doing any work just sending the other birds to do the job for him then a little Robin was perched by a branch close by one day he was closely paying attention to the horns and then a soft breeze come through seize the horns shaking like what and he the Robin gets a little bit closer it looks clearly that won't look like horns gets a little closer you see the breeze going through and the furthest deer shaking like that guess so closer and then he he used his beak to peck on the feathers then when you pegged there was no Holmes then he got off there told all the birds it has been a lie the owl has no hones we have been set free so all the birds were set free because of this little robin which went and investigated and so that days it was a lie and they were set free from the slavery that they were under you see so the devil has been has been trying to scare all of us with death through the Old Testament and everything no one had power over death all the sages of old but Jesus Christ when he died on the cross of Calvary he decided to call the devil on his bluff and he went down he went to hell during the three days when he was with during the three days when he was dead he went down to the hell and he went and called out the dab on his bluff kicked him and he took the keys of death hell and the grave and he called him out so now death has no hold on you the grave has no hold on you because Jesus Christ went and he called out the devil his bluff and he came he rose up triumphant to tell us that it's a lie the devil doesn't have no horns it's a lie death has no power over you hallelujah that's what so we cannot live under our own privileges we got to believe God's report unto us you see Satan is not eternal Satan had the beginning so he's gonna have an end that's how it is creatures of eternity if you had no beginning then you have no end and we are creatures of eternity is that right so when the devil was created you were already there on the back part of God's mind you saw the devil being created but it's just because of this birth you cannot remember so bye-bye years chronologically you are older than the devil so don't let the devil fool you for no reason and when the devil was created when Satan was created he was created as an angel who was the Archangel and when in the in the original creation in God's part he angels are of a lower order than man when he created Adam before the fall men way above angels because angels they are servants they wait on us when we pray to God for protection it's angels that do that it's because they are servants so when Satan was created he was of a lower order than men so Satan by virtue said Satan has no authority over you but after the fall that's when humanity fell to be lower than angels but now after the cross of Calvary Christ redeemed us back to our original position now we are of a higher order any man born again any more any man born of the Spirit of God you have the authority of the devil because you are of a higher order than the devil because he is going to have an ending but you and I we do not have an ending we are going to go back to where we came from hallelujah because Edom was of Adam was a fair high order but he fell so men didn't have no authority during that time but after 2000 years ago God gave back the authority to the bride so it you and I gotta use it when URIs refused the devil's report you take that and you say I have authority over the devil so you have to speak you have to keep on praying believing that your prayer will overcome all the force of the evil one because God gave us back the title deed you see when God created Adam he gave him dominion over every living thing so that that includes everything everything created by God Adam had dominion over it so now everything God created which includes Satan and his Devils which are the Angels Darwin that fell out you have authority over them he's only a bluff so if you realize that you have the authority over Satan he will he will not have anything over you no sickness can stand against you you gotta go back you gotta fight him take back your peace take back your love the joy of your salvation you don't longer have it go and get it you have the authority you have the power to do it because you are above him you are you are a creature of a higher order than the devil himself now because Christ went to investigate and called out Satan on his bluff we no longer fear we have no longer the spirit of fear because fear is what any man who was already any man who has fear has already overcome you're already defeated if you have no if you got fear but now because we have no fear nothing can stand before us no death no cancer no disease no afflictions brought to us no coronavirus can stand before us because we have the authority over everything that the devil tries to bring to us because God gave us authority amen you see God is a God of precedence he like repeating what he did before before the found a before Genesis 1:1 he kicked Satan from from from heaven after he tried to be prideful and he kicked them out back he kicked them on the earth and he was now a fallen angel an evil angel I'll say and then so he liked kicking him that after the cross of Calvary he went down when he goes when he went to hell to catch the keys of death hell and the grave the prophet of God dramatized and he said he went they and he kicked them he liked he liked that experience and now so he kicked them before the foundation of the world and now he kicked them after the cross of Calvary but now Christ left there's the scene of the earth but now we are representing him you and I we are housing Christ in us when you are born again of the Spirit of God you have Christ within you and now cry God was to repeat the same kicking so now because you have Jesus within you it is your duty to kick Satan because since God likes doing it he is going to do it with you so don't be scared just go just kick he is going to fall off and you're going to get that victory amen you will never fail the first Eve failed by the second Eve you and I will never fail because our second Adam he will never fail Amen so we are taking the fight back to the enemy's camp we are being offensive not defensive and we will overcome nothing can stand in our way amen how many I agree with me - did this morning that we are taking back the enemy to the the fight to the enemy's camp and we are refused we are refusing the enemy's report and we are believing God's report only a man and we wanted we will when you get and know your authority you begin - afflicting your afflictions and you begin troubling your troubles because you have the authority and you got to keep the devil on the run amen we do not accept terrorism we do not negotiate with terrorists we do not any negotiations when the devil start negotiating with you know that he is up to something don't accept it when he tries to negotiate with you just be offensive get on the offensive and victory is sure because you are a seed of Abraham you will have a promise to possess all the gates of the enemy so that by being a child of Abraham you have the royal blood of Abraham flowing within you go fight that blood is going to keep you that faith is going to keep you because you are a son of Abraham and God will help you a man and he will rot victory through you amen let us stand upon our feet amen let us sing we've got the power in the name of Jesus amen we've got the power in the name of Jesus we've got the power in the name of the Lord four Sator ages we cannot be defeated we've got the power in the name of the Lord at the second verse for many years now Satan tried to stop us by the bride of Jesus Lord was still alive like a mighty army we'll keep marching onward winning every battle called the Lord's on our side we got the power in the name of Jesus we got the power in the name of the world the satan rages we cannot be defeated we got the power in the name of though we have we have the power in the name of Jesus we got the power in the name of the law those SATA rages we cannot be defeated we got the power in the name of the Lord I mean let us bow our heads and pray father we come before you to face one more time this morning Oh God thinking you oh Jesus Christ reminding us Oh father the authority and the power that we have Lord that we don't have to wait for the enemy to attack and be on the defensive but to always be on the offensive because that's how we win our Wars Lord we claim back everything that the enemy took from us because we are realizing that we have more power than he is God Oh father God we know you promised us a restoration father God no matter what he took we claim it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ knowing that we are able to do it you have made us more than overcome as Lord through your son Jesus Christ and by the promise that you gave unto us Lord that will possess each and every gaze that of the enemy Lord we are standing on that knowing that you will never fail Lord your prophet he told us that you can do anything but fail so we are standing on that Lord we are standing on your word knowing that you will fulfill each and every one of your words Lord Jesus Christ we bind sickness we bind all the afflictions that the devil might try to bring in our way knowing we have the power Lord ask that blood that we have in the road flowing through us by being sons of Abraham and daughters Lord we know that will keep us Oh father there isn't Oh plague that can get ahold of us no coronavirus that can get ahold of us or afflict your children Oh father God we bind it this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ saying you have no power over the children of God and may your children go free Oh father God Lord you know each and every desire you know each and every need that your children have all father God as we come to you Lord this morning father I pray O God that may you just supply Oh God all our needs father God we are waiting on you we know Lord you are always there for us help us Oh father god now look as we are departing Lord to go in our different places Oh God we will just keep on remembering and may you keep on reminding us O God not to leave under our own privileges but just keep on holding Oh father go to your word and always believe what you say for us and not what the devil says because we know who we are Lord we thank you Jesus Christ in Jesus Christ's name I pray believe in putting everything
