[29:55] God I'm a little hoarse tonight but I
[29:57] give you the best I can give you by
[30:00] God's grace in second chronicles were
[30:03] coming from second chronicles the fifth
[30:06] chapter 13 and 14 verse
[30:13] [Applause]
[30:16] 1350 of second chronicles 13th and 14th
[30:20] first yeah we're such a blessed people I
[30:31] say that a lot because I really believe
[30:33] that and you know to think that God
[30:39] would have grace and mercy on us it's
[30:44] glorious because God and it's this last
[30:48] day the most evil age of all ages like I
[30:55] heard somebody said the other day no
[30:57] pressure no diamond pressure comes to
[31:04] make a diamond and God is looking for
[31:07] some diamonds here would it be the
[31:10] greatest of all stones
[31:12] I believe that second chronicles 5 we're
[31:21] going to read the 13th verse it came
[31:29] even to pass as the trumpet ears and
[31:32] singers were as as one to make one sound
[31:36] to be heard in praising and thanking the
[31:38] Lord and when they lifted up their voice
[31:41] with the trumpets and cymbals and
[31:44] instruments of music and praised the
[31:47] Lord saying for he is good for his mercy
[31:51] endureth forever that then the house was
[31:56] filled with the cloud even the house of
[31:59] the Lord so that the priest could not
[32:02] stand to Minister by reason of the cloud
[32:05] for the cloud of the Lord had filled the
[32:09] house of God let us pray father we thank
[32:17] you for your amazing grace we thank you
[32:21] for being so good to us you have been
[32:22] better to us and we have been to
[32:25] ourselves saw our Father we say that all
[32:29] the time but Lord it is so true we
[32:32] reverence you we respect you Lord we
[32:34] lift up your Holy Name we thank your
[32:37] father because you know what we are
[32:39] without you Lord with just worms or God
[32:43] we're just flesh that is just just
[32:46] worthy Lord to be destroyed Lord but by
[32:49] your amazing grace O God you have
[32:52] brought us into your family by your
[32:54] quickening power and so God we thank you
[32:57] Lord because it was your choosing and
[32:59] not ours Lord will spend eternity
[33:02] thinking your father because eternity
[33:06] won't be long enough you've been so good
[33:09] to us Lord whatever your perfect will is
[33:13] for us in our lives so let it be and
[33:16] your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray
[33:18] amen you may be seated
[33:23] we realize this evening that this whole
[33:31] thing that we are now experiencing in
[33:34] this world was caused by disbelieving
[33:37] one word and the prophet of God said
[33:42] that in order for us to make heaven we
[33:44] must believe every word we know but by
[33:51] God's grace that none of us in ourselves
[33:54] can make heaven if God had not made the
[33:58] way for us we would all be condemned I
[34:04] like to entitle this message his mercy
[34:07] endureth for ever but I like to also
[34:10] have a sub topic or theme unbelief is
[34:14] the yoke of bondage
[34:17] remember Amen when you yoke with
[34:21] something that means you put together by
[34:23] some kind of instrument like when they
[34:30] would yo courses together yoke cows
[34:32] together and most of the time when
[34:35] something was yoke it was like an agency
[34:39] of oppression something that would be
[34:42] when
[34:43] that place you in a place of subjection
[34:47] you know you when you talk about a yoke
[34:49] you in servitude you know it's a bondage
[34:54] an unbelief places us in bondage because
[34:59] the Bible said he whom the Sun is set
[35:02] free it's free indeed I was thinking
[35:06] about the scripture in second chronicles
[35:08] when the Lord gave it to me I I heard
[35:12] one thing more than one thing I I saw
[35:15] where they were on one Accord they had
[35:19] one voice and everybody there was there
[35:24] to praise God there was nobody there
[35:28] that we're trying to get personal
[35:32] recognition but they were all in one
[35:35] Accord kind of like on the day of
[35:39] Pentecost when the power of God came
[35:42] down and they filled a room and filled
[35:45] each and every one of them that was in
[35:47] that house that room and so when I think
[35:52] about the mercies of God I know one
[35:54] thing for sure we all needed I don't
[36:00] care how long you been saying you need
[36:04] the mercies of God when we talk about
[36:08] mercy we must understand that mercy is
[36:13] when you found guilty and somebody has
[36:17] compassion on you they're willing to
[36:21] pardon you even though you're wrong
[36:24] y'all know what I'm saying and you must
[36:28] understand that that is applicable to
[36:32] every man because if I were says is
[36:36] there any righteous no not one
[36:40] so without the mercy of God we can look
[36:43] it says oh oh but nor was a great man
[36:45] but you understand
[36:46] he found grace and mercy in the eyes of
[36:50] the Lord we talked about Enoch and how
[36:53] Enoch walked with God but Enoch found
[36:57] grace and mercy he could not have done
[37:00] what he did if God hadn't done it with
[37:04] him in for him
[37:05] and all that God asked for from Enoch
[37:09] was his will
[37:10] alright cuz you got to understand you
[37:14] know as long as we do our will we become
[37:19] failures as long as we do his will we
[37:25] become victorious and one thing about
[37:29] God is that he is so merciful he just
[37:32] doesn't want us to be yoked he want us
[37:36] to be free right the Bible says in the
[37:40] presence of the Lord there is fullness
[37:43] of joy and when joy is not there
[37:48] something has you yoked somewhere you
[37:53] have walked in your own will and not in
[37:55] the ways of the Lord
[37:57] I think about mercy and how God had
[38:01] mercy on Abel the Bible said that God
[38:05] revealed unto Abel the sacrifice how
[38:09] else would he have known right and the
[38:13] prophet of God said one of these old
[38:14] days we're going to realize how much we
[38:19] needed revelation revelation is our
[38:24] overcoming power first of all you got to
[38:28] realize and have a revelation of who you
[38:30] are
[38:32] right I'm gonna try to tried not to go
[38:36] so fast but when mercy is given you are
[38:40] you and I know that it is a for an
[38:44] example if you come to trial and you
[38:48] have a judge and he's heard all of the
[38:52] things that you've done and and he's
[38:55] seen where you you're guilty is at his
[38:58] discretion
[39:00] he's the
[39:01] with the verdict and if he wants to have
[39:06] mercy it's up to him because sometimes
[39:12] judges are spiritual and they can see
[39:16] beyond all of the facade and everything
[39:19] else and they can see that really this
[39:20] man didn't really intend to be them you
[39:23] know he just had a bad deal of cards in
[39:26] life and at that point in time he may
[39:30] say Aloha I'm gonna let him I'm gonna
[39:32] give him some time but I'm gonna cut it
[39:33] in half right that's when he mitigates
[39:37] the verdict he lightens it and you and I
[39:42] must realized by God's grace that Bible
[39:49] said all have come short of the glory of
[39:53] God
[39:54] see when Israel knew and they were
[39:57] getting ready to worship God they
[39:59] understood they have not been a good
[40:01] nation they were not such a good example
[40:05] for God to use every time God trusted in
[40:09] him gave them blessing they back slid
[40:14] Israel piers are here here the Gentiles
[40:17] in this age had one prophet Israel had
[40:20] numerous of prophets and guess what they
[40:24] did to them kill them destroyed them
[40:27] shut up their ears right look what they
[40:31] did to Jeremiah look what they did to
[40:33] Isaiah hallelujah and God still had
[40:37] mercy hallelujah and they were guilty
[40:40] but you see God even made a promise to
[40:44] Abraham and David I'm gonna deal with
[40:49] you sons as children i'ma spank them but
[40:53] I will not destroy them
[40:55] hallelujah I don't care about the
[40:58] spanking if I need a spanking spank me
[41:01] Lord but just don't destroy me let your
[41:05] mercy be with me right Lord and when I
[41:08] fall short in unbelief because
[41:14] all of us will have believed the word
[41:16] and often time we think we do believe it
[41:19] is that right remember that young lady
[41:23] in Midtown who was a part of the Church
[41:26] of Christ and how God healed her and she
[41:30] was about I think brother man said about
[41:32] 47 pounds because of associate disease
[41:34] that her uncle gave it gate to her and
[41:37] God healed her but then there was
[41:38] another girl belonging to the same
[41:40] organization who's had bad kidneys
[41:44] needed a kidneys plant transfuse me our
[41:48] operation and they were gonna send her
[41:50] about so many miles away but brother
[41:52] Branham saw by God's grace that she
[41:54] would not have been made the trip so he
[41:57] went there to see the girl and she's old
[41:59] brother I got faith I know I got faith
[42:02] and he says he knew she did not have it
[42:06] and he told her you won't make the trip
[42:11] if you don't get this faith now you die
[42:13] before you get there he said the parents
[42:15] didn't like him to say that but he said
[42:17] he had to tell them the truth and
[42:21] brother BAM began to show her what faith
[42:23] is real faith I'm saying this because a
[42:26] lot of us think we got it but he says
[42:30] see that light fixture see that thing
[42:32] there hanging if you got faith I want
[42:35] you to move it she says see I don't
[42:39] believe that kind of stuff where is that
[42:41] in the Bible he said I tried to tell he
[42:43] didn't believe it he said but is not it
[42:46] written in the Word of God that Jesus
[42:49] spoke to the tree and it withered and
[42:52] began to build what he was doing opening
[42:55] her understanding and what faith is he
[42:58] went through the thing with the eyes
[43:00] with the touch in the feeling and what's
[43:03] declaring in your sisters what is really
[43:05] there he said faith is that sixth sense
[43:09] but faith is like your touch when you
[43:12] touch it you know what it is
[43:15] or when you see it you know what it is
[43:18] you have something because your senses
[43:21] have declared it's real and is there
[43:23] that's what faith is and when the
[43:26] prophet of God
[43:27] to move that thanks she says that that
[43:29] uh she didn't say which crap well she
[43:32] said that some mmm what's that word kind
[43:37] of like telepathy whatever they he said
[43:39] it was it was like okay this is not
[43:41] accepted that's not God right and you
[43:46] know we find out by God's grace
[43:48] she said well who did it did God do it
[43:52] all the devil he said neither I did it
[43:57] see faith can move mountains the Bible
[44:01] says right the faith of a mustard seed
[44:06] can move a mountain not a mountain of
[44:10] trouble a mountain he was on the Mount
[44:13] of Olives when he spoke that see this
[44:15] mountain if you say to this mountain be
[44:19] that move the mountain must move why
[44:22] because it cannot be hybrid it with
[44:25] unbelief it's a pure seed right so he
[44:31] goes on to the explain and he didn't
[44:33] finally sees all around I really see
[44:35] what you're saying now I really lord
[44:38] help me help my unbelief basically I see
[44:40] it but lord I believe it but lord help
[44:42] me
[44:43] and instantly God the probably God pray
[44:46] for her and she was healed hallelujah
[44:50] you see faith is something that God
[44:52] gives you it's not emotional it's real
[44:58] it's just as real as your eyes as real
[45:02] as your ears right it's so real Amen
[45:06] that you know you've got what you have
[45:07] is not something that you have to work
[45:10] up to get it it's like the Bible says
[45:13] after which the Holy Ghost is come upon
[45:15] you you shall receive power well in the
[45:18] Pentecostal Ram we thought we had to
[45:20] have power as work it up but it's not
[45:23] power as such it is Authority which is
[45:27] totally different the way you work with
[45:30] Authority and the way you work with
[45:31] power is two different things two
[45:33] different ways Authority you don't have
[45:35] to be nothing but who you are
[45:40] you love the Lord now listen what he
[45:43] says now all of us have been failures at
[45:45] time and maybe even today you benefit
[45:50] I'm sorry I love eight minutes cuz you
[45:52] know what it exposes it - hahaha it's
[45:55] the truth
[45:56] hey every day somewhere you fail and you
[46:01] get up brother Brown said we bats not
[46:03] every day I ought to make you feel a
[46:08] little better about yourself to know
[46:11] that God gave you the Holy Ghost knowing
[46:14] you were going to steal backslide with
[46:15] it
[46:19] listen when he says anything what is
[46:21] what is that in your hand he said that
[46:24] maybe man here this afternoon maybe
[46:26] ministers that's been total failures
[46:29] maybe you've been a housewife maybe
[46:32] you've been as a student at a school and
[46:34] maybe you've been as a child to your
[46:36] parents whatever you have been - let
[46:38] that be a has-been I've been that today
[46:42] and today is finished
[46:44] that was yesterday whatever it's in the
[46:47] past
[46:48] and start from today no matter what it
[46:51] is maybe you've been a failure as a
[46:54] Christian maybe you have failed to go on
[46:57] with God if it has been take note - what
[47:02] I'm going to say just in a few moments
[47:05] about this
[47:06] Moses failed down in Egypt when he was
[47:10] born to be a deliverer to bring the
[47:12] children of Israel out of Egypt why
[47:14] because he did it in himself he took it
[47:19] upon himself to do it and anytime you
[47:22] take things upon yourself and leave God
[47:25] out then you're going to be a failure
[47:27] like Moses was he thought he can do it
[47:32] seeing an Egyptian beating him beating
[47:34] in an Israelite so he just killed him
[47:37] and covered him up and that's what we do
[47:39] we make a mistake and try to cover it up
[47:42] but God sees it all right and when he
[47:46] did it he become a refugee in another
[47:49] land over in the land of Ethiopia
[47:52] went over there and he had married a
[47:54] wife got him a job herding sheep and he
[47:57] married Jethro
[47:59] the priest of Midian he married his
[48:01] daughter and there was two children born
[48:04] to him and he got a common laborer a job
[48:07] a sheep herder and have been herding
[48:09] sheep for 40 years because he failed to
[48:12] put God first see how long that kind of
[48:16] thing can last
[48:17] the failure the thing you have to ride
[48:20] that horse for 40 years if I could see
[48:22] it like that think that what's been the
[48:25] matter with the church's brother when it
[48:28] gets to a place that we put our church
[48:30] first instead of Christ
[48:32] we've gone right straight down when you
[48:36] put them as an individual put your
[48:38] church first your social life first
[48:41] instead of your spiritual life you're
[48:44] going to fail in other words spiritual
[48:47] life comes first that all right now
[48:50] listen there's a difference between
[48:52] mercy and grace mercy according to the
[48:55] prop of God is when you caught in the
[48:58] act and you know of course people are
[49:00] lenient and they give you a little mercy
[49:03] now grace is mixed in there too you know
[49:04] but grace is unmerited you know there is
[49:11] no I'm guilty grace is given there is
[49:18] nothing amen on this side that can judge
[49:20] you because he is unmerited favor
[49:25] unconditional love you understand what
[49:27] I'm saying now so it's no matter what
[49:30] you do I've already decided to justify
[49:33] you right so is that kind of a thing
[49:40] listen remember the young man who who
[49:43] are I think he betrayed our country and
[49:45] they were gonna kill him and and the
[49:47] mother came in there crawling on her
[49:49] knees and saying pardon my son but she
[49:52] was asking for mercy no he was guilty he
[49:55] was guilty he was guilty but I I'm
[49:57] asking for your favor and so we realize
[50:03] amen
[50:04] because he didn't receive the pardon he
[50:07] didn't receive the favor and therefore
[50:09] he was guilty and he had to be killed
[50:12] even though there was a part in there
[50:15] for him see what I'm saying
[50:17] so you and I must understand that when
[50:19] there's a different dream mercy and
[50:21] grace and understand this you and I are
[50:25] birth under grace you and I
[50:30] amen the grace of God has already from
[50:33] the foundation of the world said no
[50:35] matter what you're going through what
[50:36] you got to encounter you still make
[50:39] heaven see that that's with me that's
[50:44] hard for us to understand it really is
[50:48] hard for us to understand because we
[50:51] always want to help God now don't get me
[50:54] wrong you say what do you mean brother
[50:56] Brooks listen did not Peter deny God
[51:02] three times Judah betrayed him once
[51:06] Peter betrayed him three times hello
[51:10] but God in his mind had already
[51:13] determined Peter is going to be us the
[51:16] spokesman on the day of Pentecost it
[51:20] makes you can't comprehend it I'm just
[51:22] trying to tell you there are often time
[51:25] we
[51:28] embodied ourselves our yoke ourselves
[51:30] because we disbelieve we say we don't
[51:33] but we do we owe
[51:36] we yoke ourselves with unbelief because
[51:38] if God has justified us as though we
[51:40] never sinned in the first place why are
[51:43] we accounting sin to ourselves don't get
[51:51] me wrong a real Christian is gonna do
[51:54] their best to live a Christian life
[51:56] they're not going to go out here rioting
[51:58] and painting the city and all that kind
[52:00] of stuff they're gonna live
[52:02] circumspectly do it the best they can to
[52:05] please God those are the kind I'm
[52:08] talking about I'm not talking about
[52:10] people who just figure they can do
[52:12] whatever they want to do and expect to
[52:14] go to heaven all that proves that
[52:16] they're not going to heaven
[52:18] is this okay see you and I must
[52:22] understand that God when we talk about
[52:24] God I'm saying there's been somebody
[52:27] who's taken our place it's not like God
[52:31] is not just God is just and he needed
[52:35] someone he's so just he needed someone
[52:39] to take your place in mine we will be
[52:43] worthy to go to hell hell we would be
[52:46] worthy for torment and everything else
[52:49] everlasting torment right I didn't say
[52:52] eternal I said everlasting we're worthy
[52:55] we weren't guilty but it was amazing
[53:01] grace because God chose to save you
[53:07] y'all hear me and yet that's why that
[53:11] the real believer is supposed to be full
[53:14] of joy because once you see that you're
[53:18] totally free that there is no
[53:21] condemnation going to those who walk not
[53:24] after the flesh but after the spirit and
[53:26] if you got the Holy Ghost amen God has
[53:28] declared you to walk after the spirit
[53:32] read that spell read those scriptures
[53:34] see God made a way for you and me and
[53:37] that's what we need to say Lord there is
[53:41] now no condemnation well I'm gonna
[53:45] condemn myself if somebody has already
[53:47] paid the price
[53:48] Oh somebody go pay a thousand dollar
[53:54] bill for me and I'm over there oh I just
[53:55] wish I could have paid that bill
[53:58] somebody just paid it for me so I can go
[54:01] free and you and I must understand by
[54:08] God's grace that it is it is his mercy
[54:11] endureth forever
[54:13] is that right the scripture said that
[54:16] his mercy so free so full but then said
[54:19] is rich in mercy but it's so he's so
[54:22] full of mercy the Bible said they are
[54:24] renewed every morning so you you do you
[54:28] you you can't run out of it not those
[54:31] who are chosen
[54:32] electing to be ride you cannot run out
[54:34] of it he has blessed you and he's had
[54:38] given you a covenant he hallelujah we on
[54:42] the Abraham's covenant the unconditional
[54:45] covenant oh I'm not saying that when you
[54:48] do bad you don't feel bad no you're
[54:51] gonna feel bad because you don't want to
[54:52] hurt God or disappoint him but God has
[54:55] already seen your repentance before you
[54:58] repented he knows you go with him that's
[55:02] why he gives you the Holy Spirit that's
[55:03] why he calls you hallelujah you didn't
[55:07] choose him he chose you we're not gonna
[55:13] argue with Jesus aren't we
[55:16] lilia no man could come to me except my
[55:19] father draws him first then it was God
[55:22] knocking at your heart not you seeking
[55:26] God it was God seeking you so you see
[55:29] the Covenant is to do is to you also
[55:32] Grace Covenant because it's God God's
[55:36] grace calling you whoo you never chose
[55:39] him he chose you how does amazed in the
[55:43] world today he reached down and chose
[55:46] you hallelujah because he put your name
[55:53] on the lands book of life before the
[55:55] foundation in the world that's what the
[55:57] Bible says before there was a well Jesus
[56:01] was a lamb slain from the foundation
[56:03] world because when God speaks anything
[56:06] is so perfect it has to take place and
[56:09] it it has good as it is as good as done
[56:14] when God speaking hallelujah
[56:17] oh come on somebody he said I am perfect
[56:21] he says you're perfect we're perfect
[56:23] here's examine yourself to see if you're
[56:26] perfect he said examine yourself to see
[56:29] whether you're in the faith if you can
[56:32] believe that you're perfect because of
[56:35] what he's done for you oh my god oh Lord
[56:42] listen he said he he's
[56:45] the trouble the church is scared oh I'm
[56:49] afraid of this don't be afraid you say
[56:53] oh oh if I can just it isn't you it's
[56:56] him
[56:57] I'm not worthy of healing sure you're
[57:00] not I'm not no nobody's not but he's the
[57:04] one is it isn't our worthiness is his
[57:08] goodness to us see the Old Covenant what
[57:12] a little Moo what if a little Mew would
[57:15] be born in a pasture some night and I
[57:19] don't know whether you ever farmed any
[57:22] or not but this meal was born with
[57:24] flopped ears
[57:27] that's a horrible meal to begin with and
[57:31] he's not he's not needed and he's cause
[57:34] I his tail sticks right up straight what
[57:38] a Harbor look at me now if he could look
[57:42] around to his mammy he'd say you know
[57:45] what as soon as the master of the house
[57:47] comes out he will knock me in the head
[57:52] I'm not even worthy of the food I eat
[57:57] I'm no good
[57:59] but if mammy was really instructed she
[58:02] say wait a minute son just a minute I'm
[58:05] going to tell you something you don't
[58:07] know
[58:08] he says that's what I see I want to tell
[58:10] you see you don't know who you are son
[58:13] you see you are born you are born under
[58:16] birth right and when the master of the
[58:19] house I don't care what you look like
[58:21] when the master of the house comes out
[58:23] to see he's got a new mule born then the
[58:27] thing he has to go do is go get a lamb
[58:30] without a blemish and take that perfect
[58:33] lamb and that perfectly I'm dies so you
[58:36] can live
[58:37] then the little mule can kick up his
[58:39] heels and have a big time you see what
[58:42] they say he you and I don't have to
[58:44] worry we came in here ugly like a mule
[58:47] cause I had not need all that hallelujah
[58:50] but God had already provided a way he
[58:54] provided a lamb for you and I
[58:57] are you and me that right Oh tea that's
[59:03] the way it is with us we're imperfect no
[59:06] good born and sin shaped in the nuclear
[59:09] come to the world speaking lies we're no
[59:12] good to begin with but God don't look at
[59:14] you he looks at the sacrifice hey he
[59:18] looks at the lamb he doesn't see you
[59:21] because he sees Christ Jesus died for
[59:24] you and if you can find some fault with
[59:26] Jesus then you your your healing might
[59:30] not be right but if you don't find no
[59:32] fault with him it's perfect your he god
[59:36] call you by His grace not that you would
[59:39] but if God would huh the scripture since
[59:42] he was a lamb slain before the father's
[59:44] in the world
[59:45] that was God's Word when God speaks it
[59:49] is good as finished right there
[59:52] hallelujah
[59:53] that's why the Bible said the words were
[59:55] finished before the foundation of the
[59:58] world it's not God is not surprised at
[1:00:01] those who are who are unbelievers he
[1:00:03] understand Amen that there are some
[1:00:06] people it meant they can't believe like
[1:00:10] there's nothing in him but you know if
[1:00:12] you got something that can believe that
[1:00:14] shows you come from God look what he
[1:00:21] says he says there he says something
[1:00:25] down in your heart he said you want to
[1:00:28] be a Christian but there he's talking to
[1:00:30] a young man he says but there's
[1:00:31] something that won't let you be a
[1:00:34] Christian is that right he says that's
[1:00:36] it I said that's the devil and that's
[1:00:40] unbelief and I said you believe that he
[1:00:43] said yes sir I said do you believe if I
[1:00:46] ask God to break that power of unbelief
[1:00:48] above you that you'll be a Christian he
[1:00:51] said yes sir and I and just that time we
[1:00:56] bow our heads he let out a scream he
[1:00:59] jumped up in the air like that and it
[1:01:02] was gone and the man is a staunch
[1:01:05] Christian today but you see what we
[1:01:08] don't understand is that Devils
[1:01:10] the church unbelieving Devils and they
[1:01:13] will come and anoint you with some kind
[1:01:16] of a long belief because you can't
[1:01:18] process it God never told you the
[1:01:20] process is what he said believe it
[1:01:23] that's all we need to do because once we
[1:01:26] believe it God will perform it hey he
[1:01:31] see when we understand Abraham's
[1:01:33] covenant y'all watch it for him he did a
[1:01:35] lot of little things that he shouldn't
[1:01:36] have done but Abraham is the father say
[1:01:39] and God said as he did it to Abraham he
[1:01:42] would do it to Abraham see hallelujah
[1:01:45] and if you got the faith of Abraham
[1:01:47] praise the Lord Amen every blessing of
[1:01:51] Abraham comes to you he made a covenant
[1:01:54] with man and then was always breaking
[1:01:57] it's coning but man was always to try to
[1:02:00] find some way to save himself trying to
[1:02:03] make himself he comes from a strain in
[1:02:06] the Garden of Eden when man realize he
[1:02:08] has sinned he tried to make himself
[1:02:11] religion a coveting right see the word
[1:02:14] religion means covering and Allen East
[1:02:18] rolled fig leaves together and made him
[1:02:20] themselves a religion and since then
[1:02:23] it's been a strain of man down through
[1:02:25] the ages trying to do something to save
[1:02:28] himself
[1:02:29] now I know every one of us is big guilty
[1:02:32] every one of us been guilty you know why
[1:02:35] because there's a lack of trust in God
[1:02:39] if God said he's gonna do it he's gonna
[1:02:42] do it the problem is we've got our will
[1:02:45] in the way who got the way and let God
[1:02:49] have his way let God have his way every
[1:02:54] tree don't grow to us at the same speed
[1:02:59] but he promised he they've begun the
[1:03:02] good work in us it's safer to complete
[1:03:04] it now you can't complete it
[1:03:08] he will call the area not one of us can
[1:03:12] move ourselves up that ladder huh huh
[1:03:15] hey man how many times you told I'm I
[1:03:18] have patients and all of a sudden a
[1:03:20] little niece or nephew or something
[1:03:24] children or somebody hallelujah lid
[1:03:28] flies off but when God's get ahold of it
[1:03:37] but a lot of time he wants us to
[1:03:39] recognize who we where we are like I was
[1:03:42] telling her brother today God gave me
[1:03:44] such a beautiful day of witnessing today
[1:03:46] and yesterday and I it's God it couldn't
[1:03:48] be me just like a water fountain with a
[1:03:50] half flowing and I get praise to God
[1:03:54] that leads me back that makes me feel
[1:03:56] good
[1:03:57] what I can tell somebody about Jesus and
[1:03:59] they're listening that makes me feel
[1:04:02] real good so anyway let's go on but you
[1:04:05] see him what brother man goes on the
[1:04:07] same but you are saved by grace election
[1:04:13] God's foreknowledge predestination for
[1:04:17] day for ordination Paul tell the church
[1:04:20] Ephesus that God predestinated us in
[1:04:22] Christ before the foundation well he
[1:04:24] said think of it predestinated us in
[1:04:27] Christ before the foundation of the
[1:04:29] world what we worried about being
[1:04:34] downing Thomas made it and was one of
[1:04:38] the Apostles hello oh come on somebody
[1:04:43] look at Peter even after he got the Holy
[1:04:46] Ghost he dealt with being prejudiced
[1:04:49] hallelujah then look at Paul and Peter
[1:04:53] was it Pauline um Barnabas they fall not
[1:05:00] this fall but fight but they argue they
[1:05:03] had a heated argument with the Holy
[1:05:06] Ghost and Grace save them anyhow now I'm
[1:05:13] not giving you no tools to justify your
[1:05:15] faults but I'm trying to tell you by
[1:05:18] God's grace that in the Grace and eyes
[1:05:20] of God you are perfect predestinated us
[1:05:24] in Christ before the valley were we what
[1:05:27] we worry about being getting away from
[1:05:29] that worry we're just the happiest
[1:05:32] creatures you could ever see lot
[1:05:38] how can you believe that and keep from
[1:05:40] being happy right how can you really
[1:05:43] believe you free and you're not happy
[1:05:46] right he said I used to see old brother
[1:05:50] Bosworth and he says brother brother
[1:05:53] branham I said how are you feeling this
[1:05:55] morning brother Bosworth said the same
[1:05:58] old trouble back on me brother branham I
[1:06:00] said the same old trouble what is it he
[1:06:03] said just so happy I can't sleep hey
[1:06:11] madam how could I believe that what I
[1:06:13] believe without being happy
[1:06:18] help us Lord that's what we ought to do
[1:06:21] speak it
[1:06:22] we got a kid might remind ourselves
[1:06:24] think about where he brought us it
[1:06:27] features to sense beginning it first
[1:06:29] verse and you have he quickened who were
[1:06:32] dead in trespasses and sin everybody
[1:06:36] says amen
[1:06:37] that's the truth we were all dead in
[1:06:40] trespasses and sin we're in time past ye
[1:06:42] walked according to the course of this
[1:06:44] world according to the Prince of the
[1:06:46] power of the air the spirit that now
[1:06:48] worketh in the children of disobedience
[1:06:50] we were slaves whether I was I was truly
[1:06:57] a slave whatever the devil say do I did
[1:07:00] it didn't even have time to process it
[1:07:06] God's mercy and grace is that right oh
[1:07:11] we're in time past ye walked according
[1:07:13] the cause of course of this world
[1:07:15] according to the Prince of the power of
[1:07:16] the air the spirit that worketh in the
[1:07:19] children of disobedience among whom also
[1:07:21] we all had our conversation that means
[1:07:24] our lifestyle in this time past in the
[1:07:26] lusts of our flesh fulfilling the
[1:07:28] desires and them of the flesh and of the
[1:07:31] mind and we're by nature the children of
[1:07:34] Wrath even as other God but God I like
[1:07:39] that word but God it's like when the
[1:07:42] devil say you're gonna die and you can't
[1:07:43] live because you've got but God says
[1:07:46] right how
[1:07:49] and when the devil said you ain't nothin
[1:07:51] but a hypocrite but God says hallelujah
[1:07:54] whenever he brings that distilled but
[1:07:57] God hallelujah he leaving something out
[1:08:01] of this equation but God who is rich in
[1:08:05] his mercy for his great love wherewith
[1:08:08] he loved us y'all hear me the merge is

[1:13:40] has got to happen yeah I'm feeling
[1:13:45] pretty good was there something on the
[1:13:48] inside of you y'all know y'all know it
[1:13:50] even before you came to this message you
[1:13:52] knew that was always something on the
[1:13:54] inside of you that really loved and
[1:13:55] respected car hallelujah brother man who
[1:13:59] said that was that a little piece of
[1:14:00] life when I saw that I let me read it to
[1:14:03] you it's just that good angular just
[1:14:05] pair afraid I'm gonna read it to you he
[1:14:07] said now we are part of God you always
[1:14:10] were you don't remember it because you
[1:14:14] weren't only an attribute in God you
[1:14:16] were only in his thinking your very name
[1:14:19] if it ever was on the book of life it
[1:14:22] was put there before the foundation of
[1:14:24] the world he
[1:14:26] you what you were god didn't you do you
[1:14:30] and Bolin huh
[1:14:32] I didn't know he was going to turn out
[1:14:34] to be yummy in the odds of God seeing
[1:14:41] his sin let me say the pot cake called a
[1:14:46] killer black we all was that dark and
[1:14:49] blackest whatever no light in us except
[1:14:54] that attribute that little thing and I
[1:14:58] know that when I hear brother Branham
[1:14:59] say that when I'm getting ready to read
[1:15:00] it does something for me cuz I knew I
[1:15:03] could remember as a child I knew
[1:15:05] something was different about me and
[1:15:07] everybody would treat me that way anyway
[1:15:09] they treated me like all the curse but
[1:15:13] that's okay
[1:15:14] now I realized what it was that they
[1:15:17] didn't like it was a spirit that didn't
[1:15:18] like that right they don't double didn't
[1:15:22] like me kept look at me like but you
[1:15:24] don't look like you man now he knew I
[1:15:27] was Gloria God right
[1:15:35] he says I'm only saying this not to mix
[1:15:39] up doctrine but to straighten it out
[1:15:41] that we might get away from this fear
[1:15:44] and scare you don't know who you are you
[1:15:48] are not going to be going to be but now
[1:15:52] you are sons of God see you always were
[1:15:56] the sons of God for when God had you in
[1:16:00] his thinking at the beginning you have
[1:16:02] to be some part of you your life that's
[1:16:06] in you now had to be with God before
[1:16:09] there well when he before they eat
[1:16:13] before he even become material here on
[1:16:15] earth before there was anything but God
[1:16:19] you were one of his attributes he knowed
[1:16:24] what your name would be he know the
[1:16:26] color of your hair you would have he
[1:16:30] known all about you
[1:16:31] the only thing happen is when when you
[1:16:34] usually being a sinner see many of you
[1:16:37] can fellowship with me
[1:16:39] on the start when you was a little boy
[1:16:41] or a little girl you would walk around
[1:16:43] and there would be certain things that
[1:16:45] were just where it would it wouldn't
[1:16:47] bother the other kids it seemed like
[1:16:50] there was something in you that cried
[1:16:53] out there was there there was God
[1:16:56] somewhere yet you were a sinner you
[1:16:59] remember that a man he said now what was
[1:17:02] that that was that little form of life
[1:17:05] in you Dan lujah I reveal abort when I
[1:17:15] was a young man we'd be out there
[1:17:17] playing basketball and stuff like that
[1:17:19] and somebody was square in Jesus name it
[1:17:22] would halt the game everybody would stop
[1:17:25] you make that right or you go home
[1:17:27] people include at one time there's a
[1:17:31] time people respect the gods hey you you
[1:17:33] know you're gonna talk like that we're
[1:17:36] gonna get away from you people used to
[1:17:38] respect God now they use it they make
[1:17:41] mockery and everything out of it but
[1:17:43] that person that got a little something
[1:17:45] on the inside they're not gonna put up
[1:17:47] with that nonsense why would we allow
[1:17:50] ourselves to be anything when bondage
[1:17:53] the game don't let the devil burn you up
[1:17:56] I'm talking from experience I have this
[1:17:59] has been the last couple of months it's
[1:18:01] been one of the most trying months of my
[1:18:05] life mine battles bad mine battles but I
[1:18:15] told the devil you know that's exactly
[1:18:18] where they gonna stay when the devil
[1:18:22] want me to do something no devil you go
[1:18:24] do it right so you and I must realize
[1:18:28] him and that these bother looking about
[1:18:30] that bow says stand fast therefore in
[1:18:32] the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made
[1:18:34] us free and be not entangled again with
[1:18:36] the yoke of bondage now he was talking
[1:18:38] about circumcision remember in Galatians
[1:18:41] how the Galatians those came in those
[1:18:44] false brethren came in until tried to
[1:18:46] tell the Galatians that they the men had
[1:18:48] to be circumcised right and
[1:18:53] and there was a group of people that
[1:18:54] were becoming to coming to a place that
[1:18:55] they were literally believing that and
[1:18:58] Paul said wait a minute wait a minute we
[1:19:00] as Jews couldn't even keep that we
[1:19:03] weren't faithful into that so don't even
[1:19:06] try to bind these people up with this
[1:19:08] ritual well God wasn't even talking
[1:19:11] about that kind of a circumcision now
[1:19:13] he's working with the circumcision of
[1:19:15] the heart suppose they don't let me see
[1:19:20] that's what I'm trying to say those
[1:19:22] little rules and regulations just not
[1:19:24] hate testing
[1:19:25] touch not taste not handling up Paul
[1:19:28] says we don't have nothing to do with
[1:19:29] that so you got to understand it ain't
[1:19:33] my touching and tasting and handling cuz
[1:19:35] all that has been finished for me
[1:19:38] God has paid the price for every fault
[1:19:41] every shortcoming I would ever have we
[1:19:47] not to judge one another like that it's
[1:19:49] the inner man the inner man that's the
[1:19:56] real man the inner man who was Christ
[1:19:59] Jesus oh you sure well what did God do
[1:20:03] what did he do let me tell you something
[1:20:05] I love it cuz I love to see it like this
[1:20:07] God really knows how to be bring perfect
[1:20:10] perfection out of things that is so
[1:20:12] unperfect only God can do it he's the
[1:20:18] only one I know that can bring light out
[1:20:20] of darkness he's the only one he's the
[1:20:26] only one that can take somebody like you
[1:20:28] and I and bring perfection it almost
[1:20:31] seems impossible but I believe it he
[1:20:37] says listen I testify again to every man
[1:20:39] so you can understand if you follow the
[1:20:42] law Amen then you'll be judged by the
[1:20:44] law and then the grace of God is not
[1:20:47] affect to you
[1:20:48] that's what he's trying to tell us see
[1:20:51] you and I are so faulty we could never
[1:20:54] be pleasing in God's sight or even our
[1:20:56] own it took Jesus Christ our Lord who
[1:21:02] was a perfect man and that's why the
[1:21:05] vows said we are accepted
[1:21:06] we love it and if you have been accepted
[1:21:10] why we carry on like we haven't been is
[1:21:16] that right
[1:21:17] didn't brother branham tell us the
[1:21:18] greatest battle ever fought is in your
[1:21:20] mind he told us that do you expect
[1:21:25] that's what I'm saying do you really
[1:21:26] expect you to get out of it this is the
[1:21:29] age of the battle this is where Eve had
[1:21:33] it and she messed up and lost it this is
[1:21:36] where you see the Albin Omega right
[1:21:38] whatever he's Sheba saying we will not
[1:21:41] fail why God is good and His mercy and
[1:21:46] do it forever right we understand by
[1:21:50] God's grace hallelujah Amen cuz Adam
[1:21:52] could not redeem Eve he died for but he
[1:21:57] couldn't give her life hallelujah why
[1:21:59] because he wasn't a quickening spirit
[1:22:01] hallelujah but the Bible said the second
[1:22:04] Adam he's a quickening spirit he is the
[1:22:06] lord of heaven oh so when he came he
[1:22:10] could start for us and he was raised
[1:22:13] from the dead to declare the
[1:22:16] resurrection of his bride right is that
[1:22:21] right is that that isn't that not that
[1:22:23] right brother said when when Jesus rose
[1:22:26] from the dead we rose with him we win
[1:22:29] him and so every victory Jesus got we
[1:22:36] got it we have it and nothing can take
[1:22:40] it away from us except your own
[1:22:42] underneath is this okay Oh everything
[1:22:55] everything that we you know I love the
[1:22:58] way God did this thing it's so simple
[1:23:00] yet so powerful you'll never see a
[1:23:03] orange tree going to the store shopping
[1:23:06] for oranges
[1:23:11] he's got everything he need in him to
[1:23:15] bring forth oranges he understand me so
[1:23:21] everything the orange tree needs to
[1:23:24] produce oranges is already in him
[1:23:27] because it was in the sea and all that
[1:23:30] orange tree needed that seed needed was
[1:23:32] to be watered and plays in a place where
[1:23:35] the Sun like and that's it
[1:23:40] you can't ripen yourself you must stay
[1:23:44] in the presence of the Sun it is the Sun
[1:23:46] who ripens you I hope you enjoying this
[1:23:54] people I am everything I need is in him
[1:23:58] Qi and he said that's the way a
[1:24:01] Christian is we are pledged together in
[1:24:03] Christ Jesus who is the in and
[1:24:06] exhaustible fountain of life we're
[1:24:09] planted in Christ and we'll just drink
[1:24:11] and drink and drink push out everything
[1:24:14] we have need up for the earthly journey
[1:24:17] divine healing the power of God and all
[1:24:20] these other things in every individual
[1:24:23] is is in here that we see the baptism of
[1:24:26] the Holy Ghost for your planet in Christ
[1:24:28] hallelujah see the Holy Ghost baptism
[1:24:31] yes sir everything you have need for
[1:24:34] this life journey even the rapture is
[1:24:37] right in you then everything Lord show
[1:24:44] us the father see and you and I must
[1:24:47] understand by God's grace you say well
[1:24:49] what do you mean think about Jacob and
[1:24:51] I'm not gonna be too much longer Jacob
[1:24:53] in Genesis 32 it says Jacob said O God
[1:24:55] my father Abraham god of my father Isaac
[1:24:57] God of which say it to me returning to
[1:25:00] that country and to that kindred and I
[1:25:02] would deal with well with thee see what
[1:25:03] was it here with Jacob had already
[1:25:05] shikes it his brother Esau now God who
[1:25:09] says now you got to go back home and he
[1:25:10] saw yes and then mm-hmm they didn't come
[1:25:12] I tell you what I got some phone you got
[1:25:14] to understand Esau hated Jacob until God
[1:25:17] intervene when God soft soft and esau
[1:25:22] hard cause if you read it correctly
[1:25:25] he saw found out that Jacob was coming
[1:25:27] he was not going over there to shed
[1:25:30] share bread and wine he was going to do
[1:25:34] something to Jacob and Jacob sensed it
[1:25:39] he knew that Lord you said you're gonna
[1:25:42] deal well with me but there is a Esau
[1:25:44] over there right he had way believe it
[1:25:47] now you said what do you mean
[1:25:49] because he sent his family out now it's
[1:25:54] the same thing his daddy did Abraham put
[1:25:58] he put put his wife Sarah in harm's way
[1:26:02] because of his own fear and here was the
[1:26:07] sexy you can't get around with him from
[1:26:08] the genetic things there is still work
[1:26:10] folks and so he did the same thing you
[1:26:13] know and but listen the Bible tells us
[1:26:16] that you know he says I am not worthy of
[1:26:19] the least of all the mercies and all the
[1:26:24] truth without has showed unto thy
[1:26:26] servant for I will my staff I passed
[1:26:29] over the Jordan and now I become too bad
[1:26:32] so he said listen and all of my failures
[1:26:35] you blessed me anyway I am not worthy I
[1:26:38] came here tonight my father-in-law I
[1:26:42] came to his country married his daughter
[1:26:44] married his other daughter I came here
[1:26:47] by myself
[1:26:48] but now you blessed me I'm leaving here
[1:26:52] with two bands I got two groups of folks
[1:26:58] yeah yeah hear what I'm saying and he
[1:27:01] said not Lord I'm not even worthy of
[1:27:02] this but this has been your mercy see
[1:27:05] it's amazing when you and I can see the
[1:27:08] mercies of God and bless God for it
[1:27:14] blessing for it that's what they were
[1:27:16] doing Lord you are good that's blessing
[1:27:21] God and Your mercies in doing forever
[1:27:24] that's blessing God you don't realize
[1:27:29] what God gives each and every one of us
[1:27:31] the Holy Ghost so that we can have
[1:27:33] fellowship and you know what it is God
[1:27:37] is having fellowship with himself
[1:27:40] that's why when you fellowship you
[1:27:42] fellowship around the word because now
[1:27:45] that word is fellowshiping with the word
[1:27:47] husband and the wife is having a good
[1:27:49] time together
[1:27:53] hallelujah how God is merciful he's full
[1:27:56] of mercy right
[1:27:59] hallelujah I got Nehemiah 9 just let me
[1:28:03] read this and I'll let you go he says
[1:28:06] listen from the 16th verse 6 birthday
[1:28:08] and our fathers dealt proudly they talk
[1:28:10] about Israel what they did harden their
[1:28:13] necks harden not hearken not to thy
[1:28:18] Commandments and refused to obey
[1:28:21] neither were mindful of the wonders that
[1:28:24] thou didst among them but harden their
[1:28:27] necks and in their rebellion appointed
[1:28:30] captains to return them to their bondage
[1:28:34] right is that not what our church didn't
[1:28:36] it this last day the prophet of God said
[1:28:39] there was a time that people would
[1:28:40] really really got excited about the
[1:28:41] miracles and the signs and the wonders
[1:28:43] and things that God did in that day and
[1:28:45] then he said all of a sudden he said oh
[1:28:47] it became common to him and then when it
[1:28:50] became common what did they did they
[1:28:52] became denominational then they did what
[1:28:55] by choosing to go in denomination they
[1:28:57] became back in bondage right remember
[1:29:02] the same thing God told Samuel Samuel
[1:29:06] they did not reject me they reject you
[1:29:09] they rejected me but i'ma show you what
[1:29:13] this King is gonna do this King is not
[1:29:16] only gonna have your sons working in
[1:29:19] servitude you know doing whatever he
[1:29:22] wants you to do but then he's gonna have
[1:29:24] your women doing this this this this
[1:29:25] this did it not happen see whenever you
[1:29:29] put a king over you outside of the King
[1:29:32] Christ Jesus you gonna be a slave that's
[1:29:37] just justice the way it goes
[1:29:40] he said yeah and when they made the
[1:29:43] molten calves I said this is I God and
[1:29:45] brought brought me up out of Egypt and
[1:29:48] had brought great proof and had brought
[1:29:51] great
[1:29:52] provocations yet thou in thy manifold
[1:29:56] mercy for suka still not in the
[1:29:59] wilderness the pillar of cloud departed
[1:30:02] not from them by day to lead them in the
[1:30:05] way neither did the pillar of fire by
[1:30:07] night to show them light and the way
[1:30:09] wherein they should go now gave it also
[1:30:12] thy good spirit to instruct them and
[1:30:15] withheld it not that manner from their
[1:30:18] mouth and gave it them water for yeh 40
[1:30:22] years did thou abstain them in the
[1:30:25] wilderness so they would they like
[1:30:27] nothing neither clothes wax not o and
[1:30:31] their feet swelled not 40 years of
[1:30:36] walking around and your feet wouldn't
[1:30:38] even swell but to see they were so into
[1:30:41] themselves they never saw how blessed
[1:30:44] they were they didn't see it now we can
[1:30:47] see that you mean to tell me I got
[1:30:48] clothes that go wear out shoes did not
[1:30:52] go to wear out you know think about it
[1:30:58] and these people didn't even pay
[1:31:00] attention to it and they were rebellious
[1:31:03] they were always complaining and gods
[1:31:06] learned she was still with them see
[1:31:09] that's what God wants us to see he wants
[1:31:11] us to see his mercy and His grace he
[1:31:14] wants us to be able to say thank you
[1:31:16] Jesus
[1:31:17] God we realize we don't deserve this
[1:31:27] their children also multiply though is
[1:31:31] the stars of heaven and brought at them
[1:31:33] into the land concerning which thou has
[1:31:35] promised to their fathers that they
[1:31:37] should go in to possess it and a lot of
[1:31:40] time we don't never think about it but
[1:31:41] in that day it wasn't so easy to have
[1:31:43] children many children died in that day
[1:31:45] women and children giving birth sure it
[1:31:51] wasn't so easy they didn't have a
[1:31:53] c-section if a child went breech the
[1:31:57] mother sometime died or the baby
[1:31:59] sometime both of them sometimes see it
[1:32:02] was just that way but not what
[1:32:05] they began to multiply children sons
[1:32:08] healthy uh-huh yeah think about it by
[1:32:12] the time they come out of that forty
[1:32:13] years they had millions I'll think about
[1:32:18] it people that's no joke
[1:32:23] god blessed him just that well and they
[1:32:25] didn't think about it so the children
[1:32:29] went in and possess their land see when
[1:32:36] God make a problem is he gonna eat that
[1:32:38] promise it's going to come to pass
[1:32:41] and though some do it they've before
[1:32:45] them the inhabitants of the land
[1:32:47] the Canaanites what I'm trying to say in
[1:32:49] all of this if God has ordained for you
[1:32:52] to do something there is nothing out of
[1:32:54] hell that can stop it nothing your
[1:32:59] failures won't stop it Moses was a
[1:33:03] failure he killed that he killed that
[1:33:04] Egyptian okay he messed up it couldn't
[1:33:09] stop God said he was the deliverer and
[1:33:11] that's what he was you mean to tell me
[1:33:14] God had a murderer for to deliver a year
[1:33:19] now you look at you should all my
[1:33:21] goodness and I tell you like this look
[1:33:23] at Solomon died in a Dollar Tree Solomon
[1:33:28] saying he did on earth what God wanted
[1:33:33] him to do and the Prophet God in the
[1:33:36] message as I was with Moses God said he
[1:33:38] looks at the Commission and not your
[1:33:39] failures that's paraphrase but that's
[1:33:42] what he said not your fault
[1:33:43] he looks at what you do what you came to
[1:33:46] do did you do it hmm you sure well I
[1:33:53] haven't done nothing like I said the
[1:33:56] other day this little finger I'll keep
[1:33:58] mine it may not be worth much to you
[1:34:03] someone else but I'm gonna keep mine and
[1:34:07] you don't know how important that little
[1:34:09] thing there is until it's gone
[1:34:11] that little told me like may not look
[1:34:13] like it take it off and see how well
[1:34:15] your balance
[1:34:18] huh so you got to realize I meant all
[1:34:21] these little things and I think to
[1:34:22] myself loaded with it seems so easy and
[1:34:24] so nice to be able to impact a few
[1:34:27] loaves of bread and fish and that was it
[1:34:32] hey man you might just been here just a
[1:34:35] witness to one soul right wasn't that
[1:34:40] lady who witnessed a Martin Luther
[1:34:44] Wesley it was Wesley witness the
[1:34:46] Wesleyan look at what Wesley became the
[1:34:50] only man in church service the only man
[1:34:52] that got saved in that church service
[1:34:54] and he won millions to the Christ and
[1:34:58] brother Branham said everyone he warned
[1:35:00] to Christ that lady is the part of that
[1:35:04] inheritance I could crown think about it
[1:35:08] I've always done this is the last
[1:35:10] scripture he said and you know he said
[1:35:13] therefore thou delivered them into the
[1:35:15] hands of their enemy who vex them and in
[1:35:17] times of their trouble when they cried
[1:35:19] unto thee thou heard at them from heaven
[1:35:22] and according to that manifold mercy dog
[1:35:25] gave it them saviors who saved them out
[1:35:27] of the hands of their enemies I said
[1:35:29] listen you harden your heart
[1:35:31] I love the enemy to take you over you
[1:35:33] repented and I said somebody to deliver
[1:35:37] you it was still merciful to me even
[1:35:41] when I turned my back on you that's what
[1:35:44] he that's what David said he said God
[1:35:48] was merciful to us his bill even when we
[1:35:50] turn our backs on now look at the
[1:35:53] mercies of God I'm almost done you think
[1:35:56] about I was telling this guy the other
[1:35:57] day I said all the Jews have gone
[1:36:00] through was the work because they said
[1:36:03] when when Pilate said you tried to wash
[1:36:07] his hand and said the blood is of me and
[1:36:10] the Jews cried out let that blood let
[1:36:12] his blood be on us in our children and
[1:36:15] they've been suffering every sense they
[1:36:19] curse their own children and in the
[1:36:24] midst of all of that they cursed Christ
[1:36:26] because they said listen when you say
[1:36:28] the blood is on the honest murderer is
[1:36:30] what they saying
[1:36:32] they murdered crisis when they said we
[1:36:34] will take the responsibility of his
[1:36:36] killing and our children you see and in
[1:36:42] all that they said God still had mercy
[1:36:45] God said he ain't gonna be like this I'm
[1:36:49] not gonna turn my back on Israel
[1:36:50] that's impossible for me to do right he
[1:36:56] goes on to said I even got it engraved
[1:36:58] in my hand I can't turn my back
[1:37:03] he said that coming a day that I am
[1:37:05] gonna take when I judged you by scatter
[1:37:09] do all over the world there's coming
[1:37:12] today
[1:37:12] I'm gonna bring you back on eagle's
[1:37:14] wings where would this country be
[1:37:17] without the merges and grace of God that
[1:37:21] he's shown toward Israel your cell phone
[1:37:25] would not exist your tablet would not
[1:37:28] exist almost all of our technology is
[1:37:31] has been because of the Jews and you
[1:37:37] gotta realize amen nobody ain't messing
[1:37:40] with Israel because they know Israel got
[1:37:41] some stuff packing even when it comes to
[1:37:45] bombs and everything else
[1:37:46] Israel playing technology they got stuff
[1:37:49] that you and I don't even know about
[1:37:52] and the only reason why the Antichrist
[1:37:55] will be able to kill them because it's
[1:37:57] written if it wasn't written in there no
[1:38:05] nobody would be able to touch Israel
[1:38:07] ya know what I'm sayin so if God you can
[1:38:10] see what I love this because you can see
[1:38:12] what God has done through Israel who
[1:38:14] wasn't so good of an example and yeah
[1:38:17] there's something yet it gone through it
[1:38:19] it paying the price but still there's
[1:38:21] still that remnant that real seed of God
[1:38:24] that's all gone wait no he's waiting on
[1:38:27] that 144,000 to be present on earth and
[1:38:30] once they're there he's got his number
[1:38:33] y'all you mean it's like the bride once
[1:38:35] that last member coming we're going up
[1:38:40] this whole thing
[1:38:42] the whole world wraps itself around the
[1:38:44] bride in Israel everything that you see
[1:38:49] right now every movement that's been
[1:38:51] made is only positioning the bride to a
[1:38:56] place because remember brother Graham
[1:38:58] said that she gonna be tried and tested
[1:39:00] at every point right you see it all is
[1:39:03] about like okay what doctrine you
[1:39:05] believe you've got to denounce this and
[1:39:08] you got to join this ain't denouncing
[1:39:09] nothing ain't joining nothing whatever
[1:39:11] you got to do got to do it you
[1:39:14] understand me and then when you get to
[1:39:16] the place Amen that you can love God
[1:39:18] like that not my will but let die be
[1:39:21] done you really got something going you
[1:39:25] really have something going then
[1:39:27] understanding brothers and sisters it's
[1:39:29] about the mercies and grace of God and
[1:39:32] understand he's already fixed it you may
[1:39:36] not be where you desire to be but if you
[1:39:39] continue to ask God to help you he said
[1:39:42] only reason why we have not because we
[1:39:44] ask not but as long as you continue to
[1:39:46] ask God gonna bring it y'all understand
[1:39:49] me that day has an appointed time to
[1:39:51] manifest itself right because dad you
[1:39:55] said well I ain't no good but let me
[1:39:56] tell you something so you can understand
[1:39:58] if that was the devil in you he will not
[1:40:01] be asking for God's help huh
[1:40:05] so that must be God in you that's asking
[1:40:09] for God's help
[1:40:12] ain't no devil gonna ask for God's help
[1:40:14] look at Cain he walked away from God's
[1:40:16] help but you see a son of God or
[1:40:18] daughter of God when they constantly
[1:40:20] asking God for help that's a son that's
[1:40:23] a daughter that's that life in you
[1:40:25] knowing it because you're not satisfied
[1:40:28] with went with where you are okay
[1:40:30] and the devil don't like that he just
[1:40:33] doesn't like it but he can't stop it
[1:40:37] hallelujah let's tan our names were
[1:40:40] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:40:41] before the foundation of the world I was
[1:40:44] saying you were say before the
[1:40:46] foundation of the world
[1:40:47] hallelujah we're just going through the
[1:40:49] motions but God has already fixed it
[1:40:51] just like he had 12 chairs up there
[1:40:54] waiting for those 12 disciples or 24
[1:40:56] elders amen we got our seat - nobody sit

[1:41:32] god help us and keep us from that yoke
[1:41:36] of unbelief no matter what God says so
