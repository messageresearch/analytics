seated just for a moment we have our brother joseph from arizona garcia uh the storm directed him this way he wasn't supposed to come this way but you know but god had something in store for us i've never heard him preach but i know god is going to bless us he didn't take this brother all out of the way to bring him here and like i said there's something we must we must need to hear i told brother joseph just to have his liberty let god let go and let god have his way he wants to sing he wants to preach if you want to shout if you want to dance whatever he has plenty of room here amen you love the lord amen and we're going to have our brother joseph garcia to come forth and he's going to introduce himself and his family they remind me when my one my little mine were little like that yeah when you got eight of them we used to cover the whole row come brother enjoy bless the lord you love the lord amen amen amen god bless you it's good to be in the house of god tonight amen do you love the lord amen praise the lord am i supposed to use this amen amen here we go praise the lord thank you brother amen god bless you i appreciate brother isaiah open up the pulpit for us and it definitely was the hand of the lord i was not planning on coming here but um just to give you a little background my my father he's contracted pancreatic cancer and um he's down in arizona i minister over in cadillac michigan and we were visiting him he started chemotherapy and we're trusting the lord for him we don't fear cancer our sister we're not afraid of that we know what our lord can do and what he will do um but we were visiting down there and we were about to head our our way back and uh sister called us and said you shouldn't leave i was just about to leave she said you should look at the weather and i looked there and right across the the way we were going to go was a huge snowstorm ice storm all these things so i was like well we're going to go around it because we gotta head home you know and we started driving on monday my wife started picking all the hotels we were gonna stay at and two days ago she picked the hotel we're gonna stay at and i called voice of god this morning i said we're gonna be in des moines iowa for for wednesday night i want to go to church i don't know about you but wherever i go i want to go to church i want to i want to know people to know where i stand wherever i go and and so i called them and the first name they tell me is brother isaiah brooks i was like i know that brother and i was like what are the odds that she picked the hotel two days before and it's 10 minutes from your church on this whole big town of des moines brothers it was the hand of the lord amen and so we know that god works in mysterious ways and when he's working in your life it feels a whole lot more precious to you doesn't it so we know that the lord has led us here and i just pray that we're a blessing to you this evening and all we want to do is is edify the body brown sister i know about you i got no agenda except getting people to the message of the hour which is jesus christ and him crucified amen and i just wanted to sing a little song for you it's a it's a song the lord put on my heart a long time ago and i just hope it's a blessing you can try to follow along if you want to brother um it's it's just a kind of a repeat song but just uh i hope it's a blessing to you so amen the lord has been so good to me and to you he set us free i know we've heard but have we learned of what he prayed oh in a land far away they wrote down what he had to say he said in prayer when you pray please forgive oh i see that splinter in your eye but there's a beam in front [Music] don't be so quick to be a judge [Music] how many days how many nights did you take a standing by on the wrong side of the army of the lord still god's mercy did extend now an enemy's a friend so when you pray when you pray please forgive oh when the enemy surrounds and the devils hate about we must love each other closer than before [Music] forgive so you may say oh save your place forgive my sins and equities but don't forget to remember all he said love one [Music] you another when you pray please forgive you are your own worst enemy but god said love your enemies and who the lord has freed is surely free indeed don't let those passions make you stray cause we don't live for yesterday cause when you pray when you pray amen aren't you glad he forgives us brother sister amen he promised us if we would forgive others he would forgive us amen and that's what we want to do and tonight brother sisters if you would let's just stand amen appreciate the worship amen the spirit the atmosphere amen it doesn't matter how many or how little it's all about the the spirit that's within the building anymore it's in the people even not even so much the building but that god comes down and he touches our hearts right god god has no respect for persons or numbers of persons he looks at faith amen and there's a quote i read brother brown talked about he said brother sister as it came down it would be smaller and smaller groups amen and you notice as you refine gold when you start out with that ore it's a big chunk but as you work it down what does it get finer and finer and finer amen and i believe that our prophet he spoke about perfect love amen and when he went across the curtain of time if you remember that story he tells it's not a story he was telling us a testimony when he went across that curtain of time and he came back to our sister he went where they had made it he went where they had made it and he said nothing will enter in there but perfect love yeah i'm convinced now more than ever that nothing will enter in there but perfect love so when i read the scripture and it says that you could have the the tongues of men and angels you could preach the house down brush it doesn't matter if you don't got love it profits you nothing amen so tonight we are warned that the love of many will wax cold right and that he asked us to go back to our first work so if you would let's just turn over to first john there's many familiar scriptures that come with with the love of god but we want to be identified and so this this scripture here in 1st john chapter 4 we're going to go through here and i usually have a lot of quotes and i apologize that i honestly did not know i was coming here so if if i say something verbatim i usually like to quote it just like he said it um because that's the only message we got brother sister i don't have my own message amen we have a messenger right and he was sent and signified by his angel onto his servant john right the angel's the one that set and signified it so if you would first john chapter 4 it says beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world right we witness that all around us we see what people are teaching what they're telling people we can witness it it says hereby know you the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist wherever you have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world ye are of god little children have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error beloved let us love one another isn't it interesting as it goes through this identification of what the spirit of the antichrist and the spirit of christ are he goes right into brother and said let us love one another let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth god amen he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love amen let's bow our heads to gracious heavenly father lord god we come to you tonight lord grateful for the love of god in our hearts lord thanking you for this message you've sent to us lord for opening up our eyes for giving us ears to hear and hearts to believe lord this precious message father for it is a late hour lord and we see it and i just pray that do us the great honor of completely moving me out of the way and just speak to us by the holy spirit tonight father you brought us here together father and we know lord it was your perfect will for the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord so we commit the service into your hands now and ask your blessings and for your grace and jesus christ precious name we thank thee and pray amen amen god bless you you may be seated and if you say amen if you shout you want to get up and dance or sing whatever you want to do brother sister i i believe in every gift that god has to give amen and so if if if i say anything that's wrong brother just please forgive me just counter to my ignorance like brother brown said just spit the pits out right all right i never stopped eating cherry pie because i hit a pit but so as we go through this brother sister beloved let us love one another for the love is of god and everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth god and he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love and we know that brother adam he'd establish the difference between agape and filial love right he said feel your love is the kind of love that would make you um kill a man if he was cheating with your wife he says but agape love is ramen that'll make you pray for your wife and that man right now that seems very anti-human and it is because it can't be the spirit of man that overcomes it's the spirit of god that overcomes my sister it's the love of god and in the hour that we're living and the devil is doing everything in his power to rob us of the love of god right now maybe not so much to rob us of going to church not to rob us a pain or ties not to rob us of a whole lot of things but if you don't have the love of god all those things profit us nothing brother sister the love of god is something that the devil is robbing people of and the reason he's robbing them of it because love produces faith you got to remember he says they asked him the question what's greater love or faith he says love because love produces faith but faith does not produce love right and it says do i have faith to move mountains but have not charity it profited me nothing and our prophet said if you want to know how i do all these things how i i'll stop these animals and these he says it's with love right we remember when he tells us those story he was out there mowing his lawn that one day and he hits that beehive and all the hornets come running out there and he says he didn't get scared right because perfect love casteth out all fear he didn't get angry because love is very patient it came to him as an anointing right that anointing came down and he said i love them right he put himself in their shoes little creatures insignificant thinks he but god's not a respecter of persons right neither was his prophet he said oh i'm so sorry i bumped into you with i'm just trying to mow my lawn i've been praying for the sick people there's a few chances i got to come out here and mow oh just would you please just go back and he says they lined up and went back into that nest what was it love did that right he didn't get up and pray some big prayer he didn't get he didn't call down fire from heaven nothing he just spoke to those bees and they went back into their nest because he had the love of god on the inside run sister when that man from portland came up to him that maniac and said i'm going to punch you into the the stalls back here he said he was more than able to do it but the rest said i was 150 pounds soaking wet but he was standing there and that spirit came up because it wasn't that man he was a spirit in that man that's man that's why we can love all people you can even love your enemies because you got to remember it's not the people it's the spirits on the people or in the people that's why we can love our enemies brother sister but that man came up to brother branham and he had something on him see he thought that spirit was right he thought that spirit was right and if someone's got a spirit on him like that that thinks it's right brother sister you fussing and fighting with ain't gonna do a thing with that spirit right and that spirit came up to him and it started cussing and yelling at him and screaming and threatening him and doing all these things and what did brother madame do he loved the man right he said that spirit came and it came down and he looked at that man he says this is just a man probably got a wife and some kids he don't want to be it's that spirit that's on him all right he said he loved him and what did it do the spirit spit in his face oh how many of us would pass that test there or help us lord right oh that's but that's a prophet but he's got the same spirit you've got to have you may have a different office he may have an office that's specific but sister you have to have the same spirit that he had amen it's the same jesus christ god don't give you a dip in jesus christ you may have a different office but you are called of god you're just as much a part of the body as any other part of the body i may not be the eye but if i'm the skin on the bottom of the feet all devils in hell are still under me right but we got to have that love right so he stood there and he's watching that man spits right in his face and he said i just i loved him and when he reached back to go punch him it says he said since you've challenged the spirit of god you'll fall before my feet it says i'll show you whose feet that fall reaches back falls right on his feet the police come up look at this is he healed he says no because he believes in that spirit he thinks it's right he says but he'll be okay and he was but what did it love conquered that spirit amen right love is the thing that changes the atmosphere in your home right love is god if you want god in your house you gotta have love in your house right too many people that come in with the book of rules and i believe in holiness and sanctity and all those things brother sister if you try to live it by a book of rules you're just as good as a pharisee or a sadducee you're going right back to the law you're going right back to the things that paul was preaching against right in our messenger he did not bring a different message that paul brought right he brought the same exact message magnified multiply brought up to our day and if that kind of allah had to be back there it's got to be in this day too if it's the kind of love that would send paul into a city after being stoned and go right back into and say oh he came back to encourage the people right they had killed they'd stoned him they dug him out of the city and thought he was dead and what do you do he gets right back up goes to another city comes right back and says oh i came here to encourage you why because he loved them more than his own life more than his own well-being more than his own feelings more than anything else he loved god and he loved god's people right we didn't get a lot of commandments from jesus christ we got a lot of the word being fulfilled but one of the commandments he said love one another as i have loved you right why is that so important all men will know you my disciples when you have love one for another man it seems like love keeps coming up a whole lot right and it seems to be the thing that the devil's fighting tooth and nail not just amongst brothers and sisters in the church but brothers and sisters in different churches right there seems to be a disunity when we should have one messenger right if we're all following the same messenger we should have one goal to make heaven our home well i don't care about lifting up a church or any church name or any group or in denomination i'm all about getting us lifted up right we don't edify a building we edify a body right a body of believers which brother sister the heart and the liver and the lungs are all separate they all do their own things but they're connected right but the liver don't tell the heart how to do its thing right that's why every church is sovereign amen i believe that every church is sovereign and when you have a love like brother branham said he said you should be able to bitterly disagree with one another and still love each other like brothers and if you can't do it i don't care how right you are i don't care how great you're doctrine i don't care how powerful your ministry i don't care how how generous you are all i care is do you have the love of god lord give me the love of god because all those other things will follow right because once you get the giver you get all the gifts right once you get the giver you get all the gifts but the gift the greatest gift is the love of god brother sister god is love listen he says and this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him right so his love sent him to us right his love sent him to us and our love is what recognizes him right because this is a love letter and if it was sent to you you can only recognize it if you're in love with the sender right that's the reason some people can read this word of god it means absolutely nothing to them right and that's the same thing for the love letter we got in the seventh age right when he said that eliezer was some gifts down to the people so he can bring him back to the place that they are supposed to be right it's a restoration message right the restoration of what the bride tree right in the bride tree she bears fruit what's one of those fruits that's one of the most important ones right because it's it's one of the things the devil takes off first right those fruits of the spirit the sweetness the gentleman make this kind all those things that love why because when someone comes into a church and there's no love they'll leave the church right when someone comes into the house of god and they don't know god bless how they're going to know god if they don't know that god is love right and how can they know the love of god if they can experience god in flesh and anyone that says that christ comes not in the flesh is the spirit of antichrist but those who say that christ comes in the flesh that god fills us with the holy ghost that's that god still gives us a love that can make us turn the other cheek verses that god still has power to change men and women today are too many people that just want to come in to have church versus a lot of people come to church and they find religion but very few people find christ and there's a difference the pharisees had religion and they crucified christ but those ignorant fishermen they had a love for god they had a love and that god recognized it he was willing to give peter a man who would deny him three times cut off a man's ear go right back to the fission after christ and he still gave him the keys to the kingdom amen why because peter loved god and jesus christ so much when he asked him where else would we go will you leave also where else only you lord have the words of eternal life what would make a man stay with somebody who's being rejected by the church leaders whether not by the numbers of people by the multitudes who just said eat the flesh of my flesh and drink the blood of my blood or you have no part in me what would make you stay i know i've said some crazy things what made my waist type with me it was love cause she loved me she maybe didn't understand but he brought it all around the lord worked it out peter's standing there witnessing the man he loved say something that doesn't make any sense doesn't make a lick of sense but he says oh where else could we go whereas only you have the words of eternal life he didn't understand see what love does you ever done something you didn't understand because you're in love with somebody love is a powerful force and that's filial love that's just the that's just the shadow of the type right what about god's perfect agape love right that's why the devil fights us on praying and reading our bibles and listening to them tapes and i'm not just talking about playing in the background i'm talking about receiving what's coming off of them tapes receiving something in that prayer a lot of times we get down and we pray and we just we don't break on through now remember he said repent and go back to your first love oh my we're right back to love and the hour that we're living he says repent go back to your first love what was it he said it was that love of those old-fashioned pentecostal meetings right where the holy ghost came down when the fire came down oh but it's wednesday night we're tired we've got to work god don't care about that god wants to be worshipped and praised by who whosoever will who is ever so willing to worship god and to love him to stand up and praise him and give him what he do he'll do everything a life for love every every sister you have a duty as a christian but a duty will not keep you we have a duty as christians but i don't do things out of a sense of duty i do them because i love god and i tell you what love has made so much more of a difference in my life than a whole lot of other things now if you love god he'll make you line up with the word it's not some i'm not talking about no dodie grandfather love that just let you go out live any old life and do anything but sister that's not the love of god that's turning the grace of god into lasciviousness right what we want is the love that makes us live a life amen because you can't live that life without that life you can't do it without it you'll be miserable you'll be backslid you'll be up and down in and out you'll be wondering why can't i get the victory why can't i get the victory but sister you need to get back to the first works ready to get back to that law that's the hour that we're living in that's the thing people aren't willing to do oh i've been in this message for 20 30 40 50 years god don't care how many years you've been in this message what happened when's the last time you got experience with the holy ghost when's the last time you cried out to god the last time you got on your knees and prayed like you used to pray well god wants us to go back to those first works to remember that we ain't nothing just because we've been in a message for a couple of years that we ain't nobody because we think we know something more than somebody else brother sister we are nothing without god you know there's only one qualification to be a christian you got to be a sinner and we all qualified we all qualified but by the grace of god he's brought us here and it's by love what put him on a cross it wasn't duty it wasn't because he felt obligated it was love that put him on that cross right and what makes us serve him my sister it's love if you do it out of any other source it'll run out it'll run out if you try to do it out of a sense of duty my sister there's people that can live almost all the way up to the end of their time and then when the time comes they realize they don't have anything you can live righteous you can live holy those pharisees that rich young ruler he walked up to jesus and he said lord what must i do to inherit eternal life and jesus looked at and he loved him oh my for god so loved the world and he loved him but he looked at him he said go sell all that he says you know all the commandments honor that mother that father don't tell a lie he said i've done all of these things i don't know about you but i couldn't say that i couldn't stand there and say i've done all of these things since the days i was a child but he could he stood i've done all these things but what else must i do even he knew he was missing something amen christ looked at him says tell all thy good come follow me oh how may how many today are caught up in that old trap of not being willing to give up anything everything and come follow jesus and they said he left sorrowful and he was sorrowful because brother man says next time we saw him he was down in hell my sister that rich young ruler he didn't recognize that just being a good person just being nice just being this or being generous whatever he was sister it's more than that and we have to get back to that love of god in our churches and in our hearts and in our walk and in our homes and wherever we go and wherever our sister you only have one opportunity in all your life to save a soul it's in the hour that you're living right now to testify to somebody to reach out to somebody to be that reason that somebody's coming to church or serving the lord maybe gets baptized you never know what kind of seed you're going to plant when you go out with the love of god and demonstrate it to people people are starving to death out here they're starving to death right and some of us though we shouldn't be we're still hungry because we're not filling up like we should right we're wondering why we're our our love is waxing cold do you do you find it a little bit harder to forgive people do you find a little bit harder to to to get a little you know gracious get into the spirit find a little harder to pray i don't know about you but it seems like the devil's been fighting really really hard remember ram talked about 200 000 000 demons unleashed upon the bride not the world he said upon the bride so what what what must we do brother sister let's run back to the love of god the genuine sincere love of god or when you read the word it's not just that a habit all right i know we've all done it right we've all done it you go and you read it and you did it and you're still honoring the word of god you're still doing you're out you're doing what a prophet said to do but brother and sister if you're reading it and it's not hitting you like it should go and read it again oh but i got too much to do no no something's wrong with you and the lord go back and do it again right because you don't know what time your time is going to come up bruh it says you know when the lord's going to pull your number and say it's time to come on home right make your calling and election shore right the bride has made herself she's the one who did why because she was already given everything she was given all the gifts eliza brought it all right this is what we we are dressed by the message of the hour right and that message is getting us back and if it's a return then i got to look back into the hours of that we're living which is revelation and it says repent and go back to your first works your first love right and those pentecostal meetings nowadays brother sister you could tell people don't want to worship people don't want to worship i mean worship i'm not just talking about getting loud there's a lot of people get lost i'm talking about wars you know worship is oh thank you lord thank you there's something to it it goes deeper than just making some noise you're screaming and crying out to god you're lifting your hands you're praising it why because you love the lord god almighty not because someone just told you to or the song leader said lift up your hands you should come into the house of god with the love of god and the other brothers got the love of god the other brothers got to imagine a whole church full with the love of god right every time we come in there's a problem what happens the lord just brings that love down in there we forgive one another right we build on that and that how's the church grow oh and it's got them roots brown sister and that love reaches out and they've got all those things that are coming into us but so we have an uh we have an amazing opportunity to show people in the darkest time that has ever been the light of god the love of god and people are looking for people are hungry for the love right and i'm not just talking about people that you see every day i'm talking people on the streets brother sister you don't know i was we were driving here and i i had taken out twenty dollars in cash and i didn't even know why i took it out and i just had it there and sit in my wallet sit in my wallet finally i was gonna go buy something from the gas station and as i was walking over the gas station and there was this man standing there and he was just you know he had his mask on everything and then the lord said go talk to him and i was like it's gotta match me just want people walking up to him you know it's like you know your mind works right by a little oh you start reasoning it out no but the love of god don't make sense sometimes so he said go talk to that man so i'll go and talk to him hey my name's joseph god bless you how are you doing you know just go out of your way you remember around got on sister media one time when they were walking and they he said he says hi to the sister and he says you didn't say hi to the sister she said oh i nodded he said peter say hi use your word you'll say speak acknowledge her right sometimes you you would be amazed just acknowledging someone just acknowledging them their humanity that there's somebody there standing there start talking to open up a conversation love will make you reach out love will make you look past your own pride your own awkwardness your own faith and reach out to somebody because maybe that person needs jesus christ or maybe the lord just wants to test you and see if you're willing to do it or not you don't know what the reaction is going to be you know what's going to happen all you know is maybe the lord put on your heart now you don't have to raise your hands but just think back on your life how many times maybe there was you felt maybe led to say something or to reach out or and you didn't do it help us lord help us to be so in love with god that we don't worry about ourselves and we say all right lord let's be about your business lord so i went up to this man and just started talking to him i didn't have any agent i was just talking to him i wasn't even thinking about it and just said oh god bless you how are you doing and what's going on and he was telling me about the stuff that's going around that little area and i said are you a christian he said yeah i am a christian i said i could tell and he says we have a little church right down here there's a little baptist church he says it's a prison ministry and all he says oh that's good that's good jerome he says yeah just you know i'm just i'm just hungry i'm a little hungry and i was like oh i got you jerome here you go brother and i gave him that money and as soon as i gave it to him i knew that's who it had been for the whole time right and it was just a little thing brother sister but it showed somebody love that's right why would a stranger come up to you and give you 21. right go out of their way to do it i remember i was standing in the brothers just little things but you know little god works in the little things right i was i was in a gas station once or it was a uh it was a fries it was a grocery store and we're standing there and there's two people in front of us and you could tell they're about to go camping they've got all their stuff and they're stressing out you know sometimes you just go on a big trip and they're like i heard the wife say three times don't forget the ice don't forget the ice don't forget the eye so what does he do he forgets the eyes all right and he's standing there in front of me he should have seen his countenance just dropped like oh man see this walk in front and i start going up and i say hey just go ahead and take the ice i'll pay for it i'll pay for it and the guy just turned around and says what it was such a this is just a tiny little insignificant but that just the thought just a little act show me your faith but without you i'll show you my faith by my works all right just a little tiny thing you should've seen it so probably made the whole day who knows all right you can see they're about to get into a fight but maybe it stops something who knows little things like that and they make a bigger difference than you think i'm going to tell you a story when i was a sinner i was a druggie i was a drunk i would do anything and everything not just to be honest shame the devil tell the truth right i was a filthy sinner hair down to my shoulders and i was a soil plumber and i was working with a couple of brothers who went to a message church and there was this brother named martial serrano and this brother's wife makes the best beans you've ever had in your life right and he had bean and cheese burritos brother and if you man if you're a mexican a bean cheese burrito that's just gold that's skull right there and so he he he would come over and what he would do he would sneak up on us and he would scare us because me and my buddy were doing stuff we weren't supposed to be doing at the job site and so he would come up and scare us after death and we freak out and he's awesome come here come here and he would come and he would talk to me he would talk to me like a human being he wouldn't talk to me like i was dirty or i was filthy or wasn't worth it and he fed me he fed me those little burritos and to him it was just a little burrito but to me he was showing me something that at the time i didn't understand what it was but i wanted it i wanted what he had i didn't understand what it was and later on i found out what it was it was the love of god amen reaching down to a sinner who wasn't worthy you didn't deserve it i didn't get it was the grace of god in something small and simple god hides himself in simplicity and reveals himself in the same right that's god reaching out brother sister he uses us who are the hands of god who are the feet of god who are the men we are the body of jesus christ right and we've got to display christ to our brothers and our sisters to our children to our families to our co-workers wherever we go whatever we do brother sister let's show forth the love of jesus christ this is the hour when the devil is fighting too thin nail to just bring remember this what jesus said that the foes your foes would be they of your own household they have their so how are you going to overcome that with the love of god right that's why the devil's fighting it's so hard to think just he's coming so so hard in so many different ways he gets his people fussing i bet you we sat here me and brother isaiah books go back and forth and we'd find out 50 things we could disagree on but it wouldn't matter one bit because there's one thing we do early on we both love the lord amen amen and if you love the like brother ram said if if someone says jesus christ on a god i'll fellowship around that right and if you've got love for somebody it'll look past all the differences right brother brother brother branham used to go and visit her brother all the time baptized in the name of father son and holy ghost and he kept visiting kept busy kept visiting it was brother joseph jose he said one of the hardest guys he ever got to convert from father son and holy ghost but they fellowshipped all the time they loved to go together they left to be with one another right they loved one another they had differences but the differences didn't matter when the love of god there filled all the gaps right and he said it took me forever but he finally won him over imagine if he'd had the kind of spirit something that some of us message preachers have that kind of spirit oh that brother don't see him you know i don't know about that he must be foolish oh that's i don't know who's wise or who's foolish but to me anyone who calls somebody's foolish sounds pretty foolish to me because you don't know and i don't know nobody knows except god right i believe i'm the bride of jesus christ that's where that's where i stand but i'm not here but like who is who is it because you don't know and nobody knows and if they say they know then brother sister beware false prophets try to eat the spirits right that's why we're here and the love of god will give you something on the inside that will warn you right because it is the spirit of truth right it's the spirit of truth and it'll open up your eyes and you'll see man if this is causing division because brother sister there is going to be a pulling away we know that but the bride doesn't pull away from the shuck the shuck pulls away from the wheat they went out of us for they went from us because they weren't of us but sister we don't push nobody away right you love as much as you can and that they can't stand it they'll pull away on their own and it causes heart aches and sorrows but i'm here because i love him i'm not here because i love anybody else i love everybody else but i'm not here because i love everybody else i'm here because i love god right and if i love god then i love everybody else right he says you're gonna write this you get it right this way but you can't have it right this way if you're not trying to get it right this way right so he said i will not forgive you until you forgive others that's that scripture i base that song on right forgive others what makes you forgive others you have love for them because what saved you from your sin and your filthiness and your unrighteousness and your failures and your mistakes and your sins and your iniquities it was love that reached down to you and it's love that'll take you all the way so how can we do anything less when it comes to our brothers and our sisters right and like the end of that song says your own self because we got to remember god did say love your enemies and you are your own worst enemy but you remember god loved you remember and he didn't love you at your best he loved you at your worst he loved you at your worst that's what he died he didn't die for you at your best he died for you at your most sinful right love does that loves the thing that reaches down like loves what makes you look at a brother or a sister and not say i don't think because a lot of people looked at me but i looked like that and they wrote me off but a few people looked at me with love and they said god can do anything and he did and when god can do anything because of love and sister then you'll go forth with that love willing to do anything all right when you see it happen when you see it manifest in your life when you see that love rise up and stop you i there was this one time i used to i used to live in phoenix and i don't know if you ever been to phoenix don't at least on the summer when the traffic's really really bad and so i was i used to live there in chandler and i was driving to work one day and and some of those times the traffic gets really crazy right and you're just trying to get in there and all this and i i'm not gonna lie i'm gonna tell the truth i'm gonna tell myself i cut a guy off bad really bad because i i was i'm just telling like it was i was going and i was i was i should have got in a lot earlier but i started speeding up well he starts speeding up well then i start speeding up and so you know just turns to one of those so i just gunned it right in front of him you know and then he comes around and cuts me off i'm like oh whatever you got it good for you you know but he follows me to work he falls i know i don't know if you heard about southeast we call thing called road rage you ever heard of that they do with guns over there the road rage on you so these guys follow me and i i'm working at a bank it's a four-story garage and he follows me all the way up to the top of the garage right now i parked my car and he parks right behind me like you're not getting away and so i get out of the car and he gets out of the car and he starts yelling and i i grew up in the south side and if someone comes at you i couldn't help it i started clenching my face i was good the only thing i was thinking in my head is all right i'm you know left hook right hook you know you know bodytalk and i was just thinking i'm gonna hit this person because he's coming at me and he's very he's agitated i could tell i really made him mad and he's coming at me and he's screaming and he's yelling at first brother sister i'm not gonna lie i failed the test i i wasn't cussing or nothing but i was just getting really mad and my i was just like you're the one who sped up you're the one that made this dangerous and just kept going and like i feel i could feel the human part of me was getting ready to punch this man i'm not gonna lie the human part of me was getting ready to punch and then something spoke out of me and said i'm sorry i cut you off i'm sorry i'm sorry i cut you off and the man literally choked on his words he was like and he got in his car and he drove away and i was standing there and i was like thank you well what that was the love of god that was the love of god that came down and spared me and him you know i spared both of us it was the grace of god brother sister that came down and just showed a little bit of grace because i didn't feel like doing it so it wasn't me it wasn't me it was jesus christ now the thing about it is is lord help us to be willing to submit to that instead of resisting you know i love when god overrides us but but help us lord to be obedient help us because obedience is greater than sacrifice amen but love oh man it's been my theme it's it's it's an amazing grace for us it's every part of god it god it's the only god is love god's a whole lot of things but to me god is love he says faith hope and charity but the greatest of these it's love amen do you believe that tonight amen amen let's stand let's go to the lord and let's just bow our heads and amen the musicians would come amen let's just bow our heads and just thank the lord for his love to us dear gracious heavenly father lord you're so good father in so many ways so many times lord
