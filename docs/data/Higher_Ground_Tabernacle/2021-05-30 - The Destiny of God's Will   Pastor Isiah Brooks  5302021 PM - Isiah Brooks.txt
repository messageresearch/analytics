the spirit and get a little warm you love the lord people thank god for his grace a long time we'll go right on into the word of god don't have my ipad this morning it locked up on me so i had to come with the message this morning i spent several days working on the one that's on the ipad we've been preaching on a lot of things being born don't feel strange yourself at home amen everybody in here is human we're people and we love fellowship and to our visitors i trust that the people of god will love on you after service because that's what this is all about it really is a family of faiths as we stand let us turn to acts 17th chapter action in the way that we think in the way that we perceive things as you have heard me say many and the only way that we can reflect him is that he himself is within us reflecting god has can never be by human ability you can work like a horse [Music] and all of your accomplishments to god will be as filthy rags so in order to make the heaven we need what it takes to get there and we have learned that we ourselves cannot make this happen this is why we need the grace of god acts 17 actually 26 22 72 my subject beginning to this morning will be the destiny of god's will destiny 17 a book the book of acts 17 chapter 22. i'm sorry acts 17 actually 26 verses 22 through 31. then paul stood in the midst of mars hill and said you men of athens i perceive that in all things you are too superstitious [Music] for as i passed by and beheld your devotion i found an altar with this inscription to the unknown god whom therefore ye ignorantly worship him worship him declare unto you world and all things therein seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands neither is worship with men's hands as though he needed anything seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things and have made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on on all the earth face of the earth excuse me i hope you all got that one blood thing there's only one race and that is the human race and have determined the time before appointed in the bounds of their inhabitations that they should seek the lord if happily they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own prophets have said for ye are also the offspring his offspring for as much then as we are the offspring of god we ought not to think that the godhead is likened to gold or silver or stone or graven by arts and man's device without divinity and the time of this ignorance god went at but now commended all a day in the which we he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he have ordained whereof he have given assurance unto all men in that he have raised him from the dead this is that this third verse 32nd verse and when they heard the of the resurrection of the dead some mocked and other says we will hear we come before you lord jesus we know how we'll see and we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us god who cleanses us from all our own rights that we would bring forth a hundredfold in jesus christ's name amen amen you may be seated moves us off i was so glad when our brother jose told us that he was going to be off what a victory we appreciate uh all of you this morning hey man i'm glad to see my sister sitting over there and she's holding by myself she's not hadn't seen her in a while so there's so many you know she works out of town and so therefore she she's been here when i wasn't here we always have her in our prayers when we think about what's happening now surely everybody at some point in time would like to run away and find a hiding place and there are times you know you feel like god can you take me now you have to follow something it's because of all of the pressures that we're now facing things that we have never seen no have ever heard and we talk about the last days a long period of time and that means that the grace and mercy of god has come to an end mankind will be reproved hallelujah now i want to say this to those who are angry at each other this morning that is the spirit of the enemy that's doing that great [Music] you need to focus on what god is doing this is a very serious time that we're living in this is a time where god is calling for mature christians [Music] and you must know that god is real if this is sensitive to your feelings right now when i was reading this morning i thought well if god had a diary this would be it the bible in itself tells us that the things that god did throughout out all the history of man we read it like it's some history book no let it come only for this one but it's more than the history book messi please click what it is this is the book of life yeah understand me your company hear paul it was simple come to a place where people were worshiping all kinds of gods and to make sure they didn't [Music] he's not your church dogmas god is not your traditions the bible said that god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth hallelujah and here paul says i'm going to declare unto you this unknown god should you this resurrection because we know no man come to life and when you talk about a resurrection that in itself is a mystery because he declared i am the resurrection i am the light and he proved it he raised a man from the dead for four days hallelujah you love the lord you're producing your heart now we know that there is a destiny but how are you going to know god come on somebody there are thousands of gods god is not like a statue juniper coming in he's not some object that you have made like unto man hallelujah he's beyond that he is the creator of all things he is even your creator and [Music] you understand me amen when god gave you the breath of life hallelujah it was at that point and no man can shorten his time is that right no man can just die everything is on a calendar everything is set in order by god hallelujah if you think you are in control of your life let me see how long you can hold your breath photo you must surrender and how can you say that brother isaiah i'll say it like this where were you before you got here hallelujah they say you were in your mother's womb but where you can search the scriptures day and night and if god does not open the scripture if he doesn't reveal himself to you you won't even know it this is why so many people have doctors degrees in hallelujah is that the truth it was like that in jesus day the pharisees they were the intellectuals of the scroll and when they came in contact with jesus recognizing him instead of saying you are the son of god they called him a devil see because if you don't know how god behaves you really wouldn't know him let's go on the bible says that god is a spirit and i'm gonna try to hurry and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth and the truth of the matter is if you come into this world it's okay if you're a doctor [Music] oh i wish i was living you know revelation is something else well you're living in revelation the very beginning of revelation is now on display what you're seeing out here is in revelations [Music] oh let me hurry now get some off on see when we i've got to watch these things because my handwriting is pretty bad so i got really scared when we think about what god did in the beginnings to show you his purpose he created the animals he created the trees and then he met and in genesis he created man in his image the first chapter he created man in his own image as a match and that man was in the image of god [Music] image of god [Music] you have a representation of yourself you see a lot of times people come to church and they come to church to hear a sermon [Music] he's speaking to his people he's the spirit and the bible says no no man have seen god at any time oh but i've seen him you may have seen his housing how many of you have seen the holy ghost how many you have seen in your spirit how many have seen let's move on so god comes along he forms himself into the word and the word is god and that word is jesus christ and jesus christ began to make all things is just like you understand what i'm saying so i gotta say it like this you see god don't care june regardless if you think he's one secular huh oh say oh i know he's one do you secular god don't care if you think he's three you know god doesn't care if you know if you think he's too you will get passive let me say it like this is one of what you come to see i can say jupiter that obama obama was the president at one time and i can read books about obama and i can declare to you where obama went he went golfing today i can learn everything about obama you understand what i'm saying i could say okay i know this president that we've got now but it doesn't mean he knows me you understand what i'm trying to say i but because you have a mother and a father doesn't mean that you know who they are hallelujah you know people say i know my mama i know you say why are you preaching like this brother we're trying to get you to a place this morning if god were permitted that we would see ourselves in the book hallelujah man it's not a creature that has just been placed here it shows our maturity you get to the table the food is spread you're looking at the biggest piece of chicken when you know you don't need the biggest piece and you go for the biggest piece of chicken and you see your your brother your sister looking for the biggest piece and you say because you have a little small maturity over the brother little sister i don't know no that's pieces for me that's what we do for the city that's how we go we failed to see that the food was prepared for all hallelujah chicken is chicken amen the bible always god has always tried to reveal himself to us hello [Music] hallelujah now one thing about god i want to say because i don't have to hurry he is unchangeable and i want to say to my visiting friends and all other builders christians this water is just absolutely delicious it's called naturally alkaline and inside the bottle is called eternal interior you understand me i have no company and i can ask you tell me how does this water taste you guys the way you're drinking it look like it's delicious but you'll never know how delicious it is until you come i can tell you by somebody else's testimony god is good but let's go back to the garden of eden quickly but in the garden of eden adam and adam knew god i don't you couldn't say i did that on purpose it was not adam and eve it was adam and adam they both had the same name because they had the same characters they were made in the image and likeness of god hallelujah but before he was in it he was only out you understand me and so we find out that god had a plan and the first thing he told adam i want you to be fruitful and multiple you know what i'm talking about it's not there the point is we must return back to the state we were in before the fall and remember the longer man stayed away from the presence of god [Music] the more his eyes became dim it pleases you so much so their eyes became blind they didn't know him they didn't know what he looked like hallelujah so when god came in the form of a man he lost [Music] mathematically perfect mathematics that could endure the tsunami waves of the flood without it sinking hallelujah the most intelligent man of our day hallelujah built the ship called the titanic hallelujah when they thought it was unsinkable hallelujah you know what i say they should have pulled up noah and asked how he built his ship was it hallelujah you see because he had a word from god [Music] hallelujah you know what i'm saying the bible says as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in this day so don't say oh if i was in the days of noah i would have heard noah but if you don't hear god now hallelujah through the voice of a preacher you wouldn't have heard him then hallelujah because noah was a mighty preacher he had to go against all odds it had never rained in that day it had never hallelujah he was speaking in a language he's finally hearing guys that the people had never heard of the legion of people the scientists were saying never been is ninja and it will never happen hallelujah but noah preached a hundred and twenty years you see what i'm saying they have discovered noah's ark [Music] this is it see something the first alien we know of was the serpent he was not of the bloodline and that makes me excited so anyhow that's wrong yeah remember i said one blood but anyway let's go so here was god behind human flesh it was a jew by the name of noah hallelujah and only eight souls [Music] eight souls in that day saw god they looked beyond noah's fault and they saw god god's warning and thank you to it because we're living in such a scientific age don't get me wrong science has its place but when science can't give you what you need [Music] can you see me now oh that great science right that's what i would do i would bow before it is a scripture if it fail but i i don't worship science measures i worship the god that made the scientists hallelujah listen the bible says in diverse is he doesn't have his own interpretation that's why the bible says the word of god is not of any men's private interpretation because god interprets what he needs by way of a prophet let's move on hallelujah now the bible says that if the words of the prophets were steadfast or the way the words of the angels because that's what god called them angels i know a lot of people believe and they believe that angels got winged quite you just hallelujah you understand me so let's move on by god's grace no you said well what do you mean brother bro you and i are elements or how can i say you and i are products of the fall we came in as sinners so there's no way i can preach we came in as sinners something you can't be sure and we're products of sin we come through this life hating the fact have you not ever been jealous of somebody foreign you understand me that's because of sin you know oh we you know i hear i hear women say that all the time oh she just thinks she's something usually when they do say that it's a little jealousy it's like you're not getting the attention okay so there's a little jealousy there you know you know i've got you know eight children four four girls and four boys almost a ton of grandkids so i listen to that conversation let's turn to jeremiah i know i'm skipping i know i'm skipping but i've gotta i've got to try to bring something right at the end because i want people to understand you were not made to go to hell you were not made like adam and and eve did in the beginning they were the the scene part of god can i say it like that they were the part that you could see they were very housing whatever god wanted them to do they did it they didn't have their will they didn't have that you know it was always the will of god it was the will of of of of of of uh eve when to made this thing change [Music] every amen if you call yourself a christian i believe because you're supposed to be a lamb you don't have a right to respond in ways that we in the in the wrong way you reflect in christ okay just bear with me i i'm trying to get there just said jeremiah you love the lord amen 29 jeremy um you you know the scripture van off 29-10 it says for thus saith the lord that after 70 years be accomplished i will visit you and perform my good word toward you thoughts of [Music] and as soon as it gets cold and every every one of us think it's cold outside everybody in here thinks it's cold it's not cold before coming into january and february but you see we appreciate the warmth because of the cold war hallelujah y'all know how it feels to be sad baby something about the contrast of god but you know god is good people even in our civilizations god is trying to implement laws do you see them to protect us from our own will is that right thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness god implemented those laws to protect us to ensure some kind of joy and some kind of peace [Applause] you're not going a dog we're the ones who because we're made in the image and likeness of god even when we're falling we're still little creators hallelujah we can see visions we can take trees that are actually standing there and take paint [Music] this is not where god wants us to remain amen people said well it's boring to be a christian if you are a christian and you are born you don't even know what christianity is she said there is no such thing as i'm bored as a christian no something's wrong with your experience hallelujah you mean to tell me you've got god with you are you bored he said i'll never leave you will i forsake you i will always be with you so evidently if you bored i don't see that means god is not there oh you don't recognize him as being there somebody help me here oh oh i feel so lonely that spirit is up to the devil hallelujah because let me tell you something when god is walking with you and you're walking with god he's the majority all by himself hallelujah i'm preaching something that's not even in my notes god always tried to reveal himself to jesus what he's trying to do trying to heal himself that's what calvary was all about that was what the cross was all about he's gonna die so that you will not have to die hallelujah he rose again so that you can rise y'all understand me he took your sins you might become his righteousness hallelujah and what are you saying the greatest privilege i've ever had is what i am now about my past that might even make you walk out hallelujah but i can also tell you some things that where i am now god brought me here it was not about human effort i did all the worldly things that everybody else was doing hallelujah but when the holy ghost came here god changed me i'm a methodist hallelujah all of that becomes idolatry hallelujah what gods want to hear that i'm a christian i've been born again i've got god on the inside and i'm walking with him and he's welcome and these signs shall follow them that believe that hallelujah hallelujah yeah but if you're struggling with people even here what you say hallelujah because when god comes in it's not a new lease on life it's a new life it's god in you which is the hope of glory hallelujah now when we look but anyway uh god is creating a new creature a new creation and this is where a lot of christians don't know this is what they said yourself god never ordained you to just go to church pack your all right you know so that's not christianity christianity is the life of jesus christ you see people who say they're christians and their behavior doesn't become this y'all hear what i'm saying so we know and they know it is the life of god i'm talking about something here this is just the foundation of what i'm trying to get to i'm trying to tell you something there is a destiny there is an end that we must all come to um and this end must be according to the word of god you know when you get to heaven you're not going to have the the the catholics here the presbyterian and all that stuff mankind made division [Music] preachers hallelujah but how do you get into the body of christ by one spirit are you baptized into the body of christ oh we don't need the holy spirit look i know god sent a prophet god don't care about you knowing that this is what gets me yeah we've got schema people they try to put a color on jesus some say well he's jewish dad don't you think being a jew a lot of jews died in the wilderness you understand me being the jew don't save you so far because all israel is not israel being part of a message i hope you all hear what i'm saying you got to understand this thing is deeper than what we're going i don't know it's more serious than what we're working with you will know the free you know i'm looking at lemons and i'm saying oh look at those beautiful oranges that's nonsense orange because i want you to understand you got to be born again life is so precious and i'm speaking to the whole church life is so precious hallelujah oh my god help us jesus there's nothing you know i'm i'm preaching here i came here because i knew that they were going to be uh uh a spirit of of know it all you know i i know it all you and whenever you get in your mind that brother brooks ain't preaching deep enough for you that's the devil talking to you but you don't love the word it comes in simplicity you got a pharisee you don't you know you know you understand what i'm trying to say i'm trying to say people when we come together we're in a prayerful state of creation if there be anybody in need of god hear what he's saying if you don't if you just come together for your own plate of food you're not thinking that's not the way the body works the body works together hello when peter was thrown in jail they all came together to pray for deliverance away and they comprise of two groups of people the group givers and takers some people come to church yes and all they come to do is take it and you know it's like some of my kids if you don't give them exactly what they want [Music] yeah you're going to be hungry later and don't get mad with me when your stomach starts growling let me ask you a question so you've done since you've been here just in the way of giving you to christ amen enter his gate with praise thanksgiving [Music] but a lot of us come says lord what you're gonna give me today dedicate that was for somebody let's move on i'm almost done just with this portion of it because i have to preach this evening tonight i'll be able to give uh yeah so anyway we know that there's a purpose let me say it like this since i'm wrestling with a spirit let me say it like this this morning if you should die right now will your character go up [Music] he i called him and he was doing this and he was doing that so when he died i'm going to make him you die you wake up if you die evil you go you go where you go [Music] whatever you are in your heart is who you are it's scripture thinking in his heart because i know that is the beginning corinthians first corinthians now in this first corinthians 15. i know everybody love me tonight this morning i appreciate you all loving me i love you all you know you don't you can't go to hell and i can keep you out you got to love everybody i don't like her i don't like him now they say like you got a love i wish y'all could see your faces when i say certain things oh you it's a giveaway so you can understand that when you die you don't that that's not the end of you starting at the 40th verse there are also celestial bodies there's one glory of the sun another glory of the moon another glory of the stars for one star defy of different from another star in glory before you sometimes they blink out like that before you learn you know those blinkers are a lot of christians they're blinkers they shine and they go out they shine and they go out but then there's other christians that are steadfast nothing bothers them they see that you see that smile and that light all the time anyways they got different glories please forgive me those of you who are not used to me i'm almost done it is sown in weakness he was the only man the word says i will not let your body see corruption and every time i think about that i think amen it is sown in this honor it is raised in glory is that right it was a curse for a man to die on the tree it was a curse jesus died on the tree he was cursed he was perfect for you but he raised [Music] he didn't care how big god didn't care how big the stone was got the community nothing can hold his body down don't care if a true believer you die we made you you see and put you in an um those dust particles are going to come back together again oh my so much so much let's move on okay so you and i know this hallelujah so it is sown in a natural body is i have one waiting for me hallelujah and so it is written the first man was made a living soul man adam [Music] but the second adam who is the quickening spirit who is the holy ghost hallelujah the second adam hallelujah came to replenish the earth yeah the first adam failed look what yeah the second adam did not believe him you said well how is he going to replenish it there won't be any birthing over there all of the birth states can take places here that's why god told nicodemus you must be born again hallelujah as you were born into this world you must be born into world to come hallelujah don't tell me it's not real because jesus says i go to prepare a place that where i am there you may be also jesus that in my father's house he's on me there are many mansions yup i don't know about you hallelujah but i have a destiny i have a place to go to go rising up right now from glory to glory to glory to glory amen every day be coming into his image more and more like him i want to talk like him i want to walk like him i want to live like him i want to preach like him i'm going to do everything like he does hallelujah maybe i look a little fanatical but i'm feeling pretty good here i got a while some even when times i'm down i got a little something going on on the inside hallelujah y'all understand me so you and i must realize amen there is a place that's why paul says i'm not afraid to die nero's chopping block nero's chopping block the the he laughed in the face of nero he laughed in the face of the chopping block is that right he wasn't afraid of death you're a real true saint of god who have met god who have talked with him hallelujah who have fellowship with him you're not afraid of death come on somebody everybody was afraid of the coroner everything makes you sick all my life the food you eat and making sick hallelujah but you know when you don't come through it you said brother jesus i had it there's no escape hallelujah but when you know the god the scripture the judge you know the god of covert 19. hallelujah the bible said many are the afflictions of the righteousness [Music] but that don't stop it either amen oh my goodness i had a little fun just now but god allows things to happen to us i'll make you decisions that's one thing about the jewish people i love essentials they did go through a powerful holy cause costa and those people still love god he says they may not even know him like christians but they hold fast to what they've been taught is that right listen that's what mary did discover feminism god the word of [Music] that's not and that's the truth you said you go to churches and they don't need to get us because we're crazy because we get loud yeah we get loud you're going to churches you can hit up here here pin drop and they said the lord is in his holy temple [Music] he said keep silent he didn't say be dead oh my god let me tell you something there's someone with your own shoes i'm just going to close here but let me finish let me finish that show oh i closed it on the scripture the bible says if we bore the image of the earth with the image of the earth a man and a woman image that's what represented god in the beginning i really appreciate her and i trust her i really appreciate her and i trust her but if my wife would have come up with a blonde blue eye let's see my phone veneering blue yeah y'all you get what i'm using her and i hope she don't mind i never worried about that but if my wife was to come up with a baby with a blonde blue eye she is um y'all understand what i'm saying now come on brethren those of us of a fair color if your wife would have come out with some hair like mine and a nose like that had to go way you got to be in his image and his lightness hallelujah i like it all my children jump to me almost all anyway [Music] the brooks has all got the same kind of hair the books on the men from the text they've got my nose a couple of my kids look so much like me they almost look like my little little little knees you know little views or whatever they call it so i never needed to go get a blood test the very image of who they are he was able to love the unlovable did he take up the mission he was kind to people when they were mean to him that's the image but what about stephen um they were stoning him beating him with rocks y'all better understand what i'm talking about there is a pressure coming yeah there is a persecution of the christians that is coming you are the next on it's coming the question you're going to be tested you're going to be tried you better have christ on the inside oh yes because even as the prophet god said must become the prophet yeah god has given us jews are the names all the things pertaining to life according to second peter 1. everything we need to make it to heaven given the eagle knows so you say oh you know this is not a day where you say lord he deceive me hey the people you know people get in trouble and then they want to throw it back on you but i said by god's if any of you come short of the holy ghost it won't be my fault because i'm preaching it right how deep everybody is you've got all the don't do that they know all the dudes know how to dress up where not to go and steal me don't have the holy ghost you know why because most people are ashamed a lot of people are ashamed or having the holy ghost is old-fashioned [Music] is have you received the holy ghost since you believe and there's a certain way that the holy ghost acts the holy ghost does not act unseen right but i'ma tell you we close out we say lord your grace and it is his grace sometimes we take it for granted we just let our little wheel run us when you do that you don't for perfection by the grace of god i trusted i could bring the message to a place that we can really see the kind of oneness that if that's what you got it's failing your religion to tell you you should be this way and be that way [Music] [Music] something wrong with the [Music] foreign yes so many things running through my mind i'm excited she's wrong to know that there is a an expected expected yeah [Music] and one night as she lay quietly the spirit of the lord overshadowed her and said that you can see a child that sin cannot
