hallelujah hallelujah victory today is [Music] glory to god hallelujah if i was just a little bit younger i would show you guys how to dance in the spirit i appreciate the lord jesus truly he is my all in all we're going to ask that you stand with us to the book of joshua we're going to read and leave our jews from joshua the 10th chapter i really appreciate our brother charles coming up and helping us out actually i i must must not have gotten a note that he was going to be here and i came to church this morning thinking that i wasn't going to have an interpreter so i appreciate the lord and these brothers for working with me the way they do well i know there have been times the brothers have gone down there to help them and i like it that way i like it when the church works together joshua the 10th chapter jesus and we're going to read uh starting from the 13th verse 13th and 14th verse of that chapter and then from there we'll go to romans the eighth chapter of it you're there and the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies it's not this written in the book of joshua so the son stood still in the midst of heaven and haste uh not to go down about a whole day elisa and there was no day like that before it or after it that the lord hearken unto the voice of a man for the lord fought for israel romans the eighth chapter beginning at the first verse there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus have made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit exists we thank you for your mercy we shall thank you for being so good to us lord you have been better to us and we've been to ourselves we are so blessed today to be able to hear your words everybody who's in bondage in one way [Music] amen amen you may be seated i like to entitle this message the atmosphere of joshua the atmosphere of jerusalem you know the name joshua jose is and so joshua amen we know who he is he was the appointed leader by god after the death of moses we have obtained a message a message that's beyond uh comprehension do not accomplish you can't reason with it [Music] he shall bring it to pass you see it's not us working it out it's actually jesus christ but we must understand the importance of the spirit the importance of the importance of the anointing and as we said on wednesday we have had years of teachings word many people misunderstood that the word is not something that's on pages and so when in all of our teachings joshua was christ josue every great leader in the bible it was christ in more faith anointing men to do his will christie that we must understand that when one received the holy ghost one becomes free from the law of sin and death is satan can so easily bring us into a condemnation state but the bible says he whom the son is set free hello this message the message has come to us for us to fall in love with jesus christ galatians 5. let's sink we're going to read 14 through 18. only uh for all the law is fulfilled in one word but how many of us have a revelation of that and how many of us can actually say we are doing that more so say it like this we are living that but if you bite the 15th verse but if you bite and devour one another take heed when it goes consume one of one another you see at the moment the same spirit that causes you to do that it will also cause you to be consumed hallelujah then i say then walk in the spirit he's only giving you the solution to your problem about the problem yes sir because there is no way and you shall not what fulfill the lust of the flesh and you just feel like you gotta say something back if that is not of god in a pardon the bible says when jesus christ was suffering he was like a sheep or a lamb and i knew he would not open his mouth you know our children know some fun when they get sassy when they talk back what as a parent what is your response you want to immediately fully immediately correct that child hallelujah if you can't respect your father who is god you're not going to obey nobody else that's not even in my notes but it's true walk in the spirit that only spray he said what do you mean brother what is it it's just like it's just like uh you know when when uh i lost my thought but when you're persecuted the bible said revile not in other words don't don't don't come back at the person in a fight now we say oh we got the holy ghost i've only sent this question but the bible tells me that when stephen was being stopped uh [Music] god said bless your enemies i'm trying to tell you how much holy ghost you got said you sent this proof of it you love the lord that's all i'm saying the bible said for the flesh 17th verse so that you cannot do the things that ye would but how [Music] person watch that observation because the next thing is that that gate is going to open when that comes you got to rebuke it satan that you're a liar satan you're a liar the bible said bless and curse not have mercy upon that person thing that james talk about that little thing that sticks his head out like a snake you understand me now i'm gonna go ahead on in just a minute but i i want to lay this down because you and i must know there's a difference between walking in the flesh and walking in the spirit you can't sometimes my grandson he just get a little frustrated and as far as i'm concerned because it is a spirit that's gonna say any spring a rebellion rebellion a spirit of disobedience saying spirit like this will be something you know the bible says don't even look at somebody like you hate him i'm gonna get been guilty of that combination come on this i'll be real you you know you do so there is no way you can make heaven how easy it is that right brother brother said we we we were we were we were born failures then what's going to make us victorious hallelujah what's going to make us rapture ready just give unfair long live the holy ghost but let me put it this way there are many people with the holy ghost to make a rapture how many people committed brother branham said had the holy ghost and they stayed in the system so he said only system instead of following the word for their day only this day this scripture is fulfilled i want everybody to have access to that message i want you to go listen to it and i want you to thoroughly listen to it this is important as he explained listen i'm gonna read these things and then i'll get into because i'm not done with prayer listen people cry out for prayer can you cry out that god will teach you how to pray god know how to pray most of us have never god just heard us aspiration after this is the ceos this is why i probably missed this song amen look what he says in the message the seven seals have been opened the whirlwind is to the west coast since western he said now don't miss it they did back yonder coming a little closer to our day and people personally what does the scripture say about today about the time we live in jesus figure god is about to do something we'll listen to that question within our minds what is god getting ready to do because this under the inspiration of the holy spirit it is personal you mean a priest what was he doing fulfilling the scripture is that right and he ties this very thing that's happening [Music] into the event don't don't leave venema that jesus was in the temple and they asked jesus to read it and he read out of isaiah closed it with this day the scripture is fulfilled what was he this is why because that's what he's doing now jesus christ jesus is coming into flesh not just william brown williams [Music] you cannot be changed [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen amen but he said as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the days when the son of man is being revealed which is a prophet yeah the son of god and the son of david now he lives here on earth he never did say inaudible scriptures directing you to the scripture he's supplying these scriptures to himself he's trying to unveil to the people they said this is a divorce they're sitting right before them jesus they saw jesus but they were blind to the facts they were living in the day of their visitation and so has this church aimed at a glitch this is the church did not recognize a day of visitation he could [Applause] he was the son of man now here we come for 2 000 years he's been known to us as son of god spirit confess the jew is praying and in the millennium he'll be son of david he believes upon the throne we all know that who believe the scripture hallelujah is that right that's what they saw jesus asked his own viewers jesus christ they called him a devil they called him hallelujah but there were some there were those world war that's what i would do it but i gotta wait for him hallelujah and then he tells us if we knew not just him but not the angel melon hallelujah is that you know you have to be careful when you say pentecostal because people want to take all the joy out of it no no no no no no no no this is not a subtraction subscription edition setting addition hallelujah all day plus plus hallelujah amen now you love the lord i'm trying to get us to a place where we understand you cannot leave the message learn the message without the holy spirit the bible said is christ in you the hope of glory [Music] hallelujah amen you understand what i'm saying companies are those of us who don't have the holy ghost the second one and you make sure the gives you a new birth you've done innovations from a pig to a dog in columbus or from a buzzer to a dove uh then if moses said he saw that and testified to the to be the truth s obligated excuse me god you will take you know that is not a cold it's nothing it's just a sneeze but why do we feel like when god comes to our house god took shadrach meshach [Music] i think the only one they could fellowship with that with was with daniela and those hebrew boys we call them boys it's a finality they were real men matter of fact honestly they were willing to die in faith without deliverance is that right brother said it like this he said they even had a prayer meeting and god kept quiet oh jesus and they said even though he's on the memphis i haven't heard from him hallelujah i'm still not going to bow satan's unbelief [Music] that's what it is [Music] it was god who in in uh tabernacled himself it was god it's a jew who tabernacled himself she said they start that's y'all should be saying amen really louder than that my dear friend is a man i think i heard my wife i never heard her praise the lord for my wife i'm sure there were other people but my point is what i'm trying to build here by the inspiration of the holy ghost is your faith faith safwa all people all men whether be converted or not live by faith some kind right but you don't you need his face and i don't care how much the pastor prayed for you my temper because they lack the faith and he's the same yesterday i will be so happy when we get to the place instead of worrying only this complaint we begin to praise him worry worry works against you the complaints bring you usher our he said if jesus christ stood there and read that day see jesus said they were looking at the naturals lord this man my brother my friend he's been dead four days how could he live what might be his life people you must get with god to the fact to the point that satan has no space the judgment is every day satan is accusing you of the keys and he's got good evidence he's got some good evidence how he became my sins he said but you've got to believe this part too i have become the righteousness so when you understand that by revelations and that's what we do lord what have i done wrong just because you're faithful nothing wrong and when your faith fails you can i go just a little bit longer i know i've gone along this morning just give me a little bit more time he said we stand here tonight and say that jesus christ is the same yesterday he said god is obligated to prove that to be so because it's his word you all need to talk to god you need to start taking this message and says lord you said that all things are possible to choose from that belief that's the oh god help us see god is more than able listen what i'm gonna read and i'm gonna close on this video uh he says sometimes therefore you may be sitting out there with cancer or you might be setting with a disease you think why me being a christian it is or anywhere else it's the lord [Music] of god it was a real praise of god there isn't enough whistles it takes the spirit of god it's upon us at the moment come down on it that's what does it mean and they're long forgotten yet because they've classed the gift of the holy ghost initial evidence of speaking in tongues and i heard devils and witches oh you got people oh i ain't gonna go there because that's another you know it's amazing it amaze we all battle we all got weaknesses we've got because of this of course it's a share but greater the greater man is inside the greater see you know people say well lord i can't overcome don't lie to god don't think i can't don't don't even go there nali memphis and if you get serious about overcoming it was that serious he'll give you the overcoming power there will not be any excuses in heaven you are a german this is kiss lucille none okay not one member because he's giving us what it i haven't gotten to that part of prayer but i just got to work i keep saying y'all were here wednesday those who who were here wednesday y'all heard this you know we preached on travailing really getting into the spirit of the anointing i got the holy ghost but i don't believe malachi 4. at the world says the messiah we know when the messiah comes hallelujah listen outside of that on the older side it can't be the holy ghost if it says it's the holy spirit and denies one word of that bible cannot be the holy ghost that's the evidence whether you believe or not fervent yeah talking about prayer the effects were fervent that desperation effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much your heart it won't work it works it's a function but the bible said if you got a ought against the brotherhood right lay your gift at the altar this is the positivity you'll talk to the brother and sister take it right i can hear your prayers hallelujah yeah glory to god when a righteous man not a good man find them get in travail when a righteous man person i'm sorry a good man in person in one person or soul travail or travail he said on this [Music] and she didn't get up there doing no rosary stuff she didn't get up there's our father who wanted him all pretty much she raised the roof she cried out to god and so much so god she traveled they know she didn't know yeah she did really and she still was still in her living room and it is just wherever she [Laughter] call whatever you want to say i can tell you what the prophet says remember that little boy with the corduroy pads his affliction tied him up into knots what was in his house the clothes the baby would be wearing the baby uh you know the place he slept and he has brother he said you've been there at my house i treated it on my misery and brother brown said yeah do we i have a gift gender and it takes me places it's some amendments y'all understand me he's giving me complaining prayer will take you places it will break to you you you dimensional anyway you're supernatural but we failed to tap into it afraid of the supernatural hallelujah and what god is trying to tell us that when you pray i'll show you things hallelujah oh yeah and we need to know that he said it it's the token it gives you something but he also says a ducey confessing our faults confess getting right make making it ready for it confess our faults one to another and i love you well enough i pray for you and you pray for me every people and we'll stay with it fervent prayer until he answers that's what desperation sound like that's desperation suddenly there's a spot that's what we should have all the time we're so prideful we don't want nobody to know you're battling and the devil holds that pride i understand because you're afraid if i tell sister so-and-so if somebody holds you in uh uh confident that's a truth breaker you can you've made somebody confidentially confident in you false to you it confessed their foot on spill your guts out you don't spill your guts out you don't you don't told everything and they're they're like they're the righteous ain't got nothing to tell you [Laughter] [Music] you know when people tell me false i always say hey i got some too much loss folks there's got to be one or two people in here like the devil can stop the promises of god totally nonsense nonsense i'm just telling you what the word in brother branham said and the truth of the battle i'm closing the truth of the matter is i used to be i didn't know i had so much pride one time yeah and and when my wife would confess to the church that i i was sick or had some problem she didn't know but inside me i wanted to go hide to get it out this is because i don't fear anymore what you think about me you understand what i'm saying and you've got to come to that place where uh uh christians should be christians and when it's like this peterham got thrown in jail i'm close and so when peter came knocking on the door to open the door she was amazed amazed she was shocked if you met y'all remember there's a time you wouldn't even pray do not without prayers i know what i'm talking about that's my wife there were times i would sneeze and say excuse me jesus and jesus and everything else will be added thank you sir in moments like this i'll sing out a song anybody design prayer sing out a love song to jesus [Music] in moments like this i lift up my hair i lift up my hands to you lord [Music] you lord [Music] i love
