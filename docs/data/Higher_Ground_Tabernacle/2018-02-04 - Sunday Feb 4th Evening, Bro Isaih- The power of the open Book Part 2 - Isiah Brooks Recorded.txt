TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we had on this morning we're try not to be long God would help us we want to eat from Hebrews the fourth chapter Hebrews 4 we'll read the third and the fourth verse was for three through four for we which have believed do enter into rest I'll say that again don't you listen closely for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest remember there were those who would not believe during the time of Moses and so therefore they did not enter into rest even though God had offered it unto them although the works were finished from the foundation of the world and everybody that was ordained to enter into rest did do so and those who were not did not and understand that God is not unjust God knows everything and he knows your choices and so therefore he predestinate you according to the choices that you've made before the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and God did rest the seventh day from all his words amen so everything that God was to do he did it and he rested hallelujah amen Ephesians 1:4 according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love right say it again according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world not in the 19th century before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame hallelujah before him in love you love the Lord 2nd Timothy 2:19 and then we'll pray 2nd Timothy 2:19 nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that name at the name of Christ depart from iniquity Heavenly Father we pray before you Lord we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you Lord for being so good to us and Lord without your Jesus we're nothing it is because of you and your master mind that we stand here today in honor to our creation and father we pray that you'll get glory in and throughout our lives to you be praised in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ have dine on way Oh God amen and amen you may be seated we spoke on the message this morning basically trying to show us that the book of the book was open and you know we think about the book of Redemption but we must all realize that this whole Bible is deemed as dealing with with Redemption though God tells us how he created all things he also tells us how mankind fell and that God amen was to redeem us remember when I had him fail God did not sing Gabriel he didn't sin wormwood or some other angel but we realized that God Himself came down to redeem mankind now the Bible tells us that the voice of God walked in the cool of the evening or the cool of the day and we realized that the voice of God is God even though we realize also who that voice was it was none other than what we call who we call the Lord Jesus Christ amen he he he he had and he walked amen in his theophany there to show us and to bring a revelation to Adam and Eve now you say what do you mean because it is the same holy spirit you can't change it God can't change it right if brother Branham said that that the The Tree of Life was Jesus Christ what he was the only one that could have given life amen to Adam and Eve and he is the voice of God because remember in the beginning when there was nothing amen it was that logos that came out of God that low cost was Jesus Christ in that form right amen he was the son brother branham tells us that how that when he spoke and when he began to create he was like a child he began to rejoice and shout and everything else amen when he began to see all those things coming into view now we realized by God's grace amen that here God is coming and he's telling us and he's showing us amen as I said on this morning that all God our owns it's ours you know is that right Paul said that we are joint heirs with Christ right amen as it was in the beginning he was joint heirs with Adam that's before Amen she had a name change but as long as her name was Adam as long as she stayed connected with Adam everything that Adam oh she owned a man if separation came after the fall it meant when she chose to obey another voice other than her husband's voice so we realized by God grace the work was finished right from the foundation of the world that means that God how could I said he wrote the novel he did everything every actor every part of this was finished amen but nobody knew what was in the book besides God Amen nobody understood the book but God understand when those priests in the book in in Leviticus priesthood and all of those things you know they didn't fully understand what God was saying if they had then we would not have meet God to talk to him but Jesus when he came down him and he began to explain the scripture because all they saw was law God said don't do this God said don't do that and Paul tells us that nobody was able to keep it so they were hypocrites and all who tried to live the law was hypocrites if the Jews could live in how you think Gentiles can live it it's always been my grace so we realized by God's grace we we the book has been opened and now God is unreeling the complete mystery of redemption even in Genesis 3:17 we find out a man that God spoke a word the serpent shall bruise his heel in you and you shall bruise his head and he talked about wind when did that happen it was locked in the scripture we didn't understand it we didn't even know who the serpent law but we found out that when Jesus was being crucified who crucified Him it was a serpent it was a serpent seed and here they were fulfilling Genesis 3 where did Moses get that from huh hey who was the Pharisees in the Sadducees jesus said unto them you generation of vipers you understand me we looked at these religious men as being pious and holy and acceptable to God and God comes along and says not so he said you hold the truth in unrighteousness in other words you know who I am but you you refuse to let the people know who I am you won't go in and you shutting and you blocking the door so others wouldn't go in is that what they did pride it's the truth remember the man who was blond born blind by birth they threatened you to to excommunicate his parents and instead of staying with the truth amen they avoided the question and they wanted to know who Christ was and they said don't ask us ask him he is of age how fearful these people were they were afraid of the ecclesiastical RAM in that day they were afraid of them and because they wanted their social status to remain and they had rather a men pushed their son to the side and be accepted by the Pharisees of the church world of that day with that young man a man who actually got his sight blind out from from being blind thirty years knew that only God could heal it hallelujah and he even went into a little debate a little argument he says hey to the Pharisee well don't you don't you know he's not written that only God could heal hallelujah and then they got upset with him and says well what are you and who are you you're nothing now what kind of attitude is that you're nothing and are you here to teach us like we've got our DD Blvd whatever degree they had they had it and then we're going to let know some nobody tell them what it is well the wise young man says well you can say whatever you want about Jesus but I am I am here as a testimony that I was blind but now I see you figure it out you don't want to say his God but let me tell you something I was blind you no I was blind I was here thirty years or more begging you never healed me right but here come a man that you call a devil and he comes and he touched me and healed me and you want me to believe that he's a devil when you couldn't do nothing for me oh come on somebody they got led with him they were angry with him and that's how it is Amen when a true son and daughter becomes enlightened to who Jesus is that enlightenment becomes a revelation to them so much so they understand who they are is that right remember when Jesus asked the question he said who do men say I the son of man am now at the Christ the Son of the Living God rested i doubt simon barjona for blessed flesh and blood did not reveal this thing to you but my father which is in heaven he has revealed this thing to you and now from this moment on you will no longer be called simon barjona I'm calling you Peter but you are little rock your piece of the rock hallelujah but I want you to understand that the revelation that you just received amen this is what I'm building my church upon hallelujah not you Peter but the revelation of who I am hallelujah why because Satan has spent thousands of years with trees and trees of people ain't men making them not know who I am because he has been a squatter he has been deceiving the people God don't care God is a myth but at the same time he wants you to worship Him but I've come I am the light of the world hallelujah is that right they said John and you that lady says no I'm not that light he said but there's one that's coming after me whose shoes I'm not even worthy to unlatch lujah but when he comes he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire oh my and then John picks it up in John the first chapter and he said this light was the light of men I see that in such a way in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God that word became flesh hallelujah and we beheld his glory as the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth hallelujah it doesn't stop pays and he came to his own but he's all received and not but to them that received him he gave them power to become the sons of God hallelujah she is hidden the receiving of who he is it meant that makes you know who he is and he and who you are is that right when the prophet of God came in this day he told us about the ego story how the many of us were actually hatched under the chicken but we were not chickens we were Eagles the egg was a eagle a hallelujah and because the egg was the eagle a that egg could only bring forth egos hallelujah oh come on somebody you may have been given birth amen underneath the chicken but your identity Amen shows who you are because in those system there's a lot of things we couldn't eat and one of those things were the Trinity we couldn't eat it Oh y'all better understand me when I was a Baptist amen I knew as a boy that God was one I could not explain it but I knew he wasn't cut up in three pieces hallelujah and when I really found out that people really thought that he was three persons that really got me now hallelujah because I know when you got three personalities in one person you are schizophrenic hallelujah commotion about it know you got to understand all of these things were given to us we got power on the inside not just a word but a word power come on somebody world is active the Bible said is a sharp two-edged sword hey man it goes out and accomplished what he's supposed to accomplish the Bible said it is only the Word of God that is able to discern the very intent and thought of the heart hallelujah when no man ever can see what's on the inside God goes in with the scope of the word and he can see every motion every intent everything about you God sees it hallelujah that's why you can't hide from God God is who he is Paul had the explaining this is above all he's through all he's in you all hallelujah is that right David said if our sin in the midden into hell thou are there if I built and I had we should flying to the heavens though out there wherever I go thou art there there's no hiding place other than in the rock in the cleft of the rock hallelujah so you and I must understand in hallelujah if the foundation of God standeth sure why should I be afraid hallelujah having this seal the Lord knows them that are here and while we were insolent seeing the bombs that in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us hallelujah so you and I must understand because we are sinners we were sinners Christ died for us God oh come on somebody we understand by God's grace what Hebrews 6 says Amen it talks about the rain coming on the Justin E and just we didn't know what that was we thought it was just a parable hallelujah but then the Bible according to the gospel shows us that in the beginning there were two seed song there was a good seed in a bad seed hallelujah I don't know about you but I'm to see the god song I'm the good seed hallelujah why because it is his word that has quickened me to life hallelujah one time I was dead and sin and I didn't know it but then God comes along and quicken what was only inside of me that's what there is a transformation going on the inside God is restoring the bride treat hallelujah my worship is being restored the word is being restored everything about the bride tree is being restored hallelujah and right now God is bringing us into the very image and likeness of his dear son and the devil can do me no harm hallelujah he can't stop me because the God that I serve and the God that you serve is Alpha and Omega he's the beginning and the end he's the first in the last hallelujah oh my he is beginning of a sentence in the pit the period of one hallelujah oh come on somebody we look at this tank and God had us colored that they were trying to figure out how God is gonna do it now look he saw him on Calvary before he went to Calvary the Bible says hey many of the princes of this world would have known who he was they would not have crucified him hallelujah they would have said don't mess with him let him live as long as he can Hollan Oh glory to God because one thing for sure even if they had no they went to crucify him if they had known what that vessel had on the inside hallelujah amen is not by power is not by might but by my spirit said the Lord and when the Holy Ghost came down into that body of Jesus hallelujah he became omnipotent y'all hear me somebody hallelujah he was a man for a fasting forty days and forty nights without food or water I guess that's just the way it was but nevertheless Amen we realized by God's grace he was doing what he was overcoming he was already overcome but think about it in his weakest as a man in his weakest condition he walked the death that's why we must realize that the prophet of God comes along and says oh the weakest Saint can make the devil shrivel you say I'm weak but the problem is take what you got and go to God in prayer hallelujah the Bible said cast all your cares upon him while he cares for you Oh glory to God and that's what we mean to do oh I'm weak but you still got power at least your tank is not empty hallelujah you still got something amen better shake the devil hallelujah Oh glory to God thank you Jesus why because my ego my momma eagle and my daddy golly want to say it when I scream they scream back oh yeah yeah all I gotta do is make a noise hallelujah and they'll come running hallelujah you know that's the truth hallelujah the Bible said they shall come from the east and from the west and from the north and from the south and they should sit down in the kingdom of God see that's what that's what Jesus was telling the Pharisees those Jews you gonna miss it you gotta miss it because I got a people they gonna come from the east and the west they're gonna come from everywhere and they're gonna sit down in the kingdom of God and he goes on saying behold they're our last which they're our last which shall be first then they're a first which shall be last hallelujah the Jews were first hallelujah come on somebody but look at these old nasty Gentiles hallelujah God called them dogs God called them swine's hallelujah they had the nature of uncleanness hallelujah they did whatever come to their minds but all in the book of Isaiah tells us that God was going to call the Gentile hallelujah oh my god was going to call her Beulah Oh God was gonna call a Beulah God was gonna marry her go in a god I said one time you had a forsaken people but now I'm calling you amen to be my bride hallelujah and you and I are witnesses and everything that that Isaiah prophesied in that day has now come the pan Beulah I'm Beulah land hallelujah look at it Jesus come along and he's telling the church you may not have known me you may not have understood me he said I will say to the seven church Oh behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be you said well what works brother Brooks amen they asked Jesus one occasion what works must I do and jesus said here is the works that you believe on Him whom God has sent hallelujah that's all you got to do truly believe what he's God sent us a prophet and you believe the words of that prophet and you began to drink it you forget to eat it you drink if you eat if you're drinking you leave it and it began to push his way out of you hallelujah is that right because that's what a mother do she just eaten that baby get to push it out oh my god is that right I am the Alpha and the Omega the beginning in the end the first and the last hallelujah none of us would understand what God is doing right now except the mercies and grace of God has given to us hallelujah do you know why God God had just had to come down and die for us so he can explain to us what did happen to us what happened to you he said you would trick like E you did not mean you didn't mean to sin in the first place hallelujah and because I know that I'm gonna justify you as though you've never said in the first place hallelujah but it took the property took the opening of the word for us to understand that you understand me that's why the headstone came down crying grace grace it didn't say mercy mercy it said grace grace grace is the unmerited favor of God hallelujah God didn't see us doing wrong oh come on somebody because of His grace hallelujah he took our sin and sent it back to the originator you mean everything I did rose Satan got a painful hey my everything I've done know Satan must pay for somebody gotta pay for and if God took the pill be away from us that means Satan must pay for everything we have done wrong hallelujah that's what he's saying now when he told I told Johnny eat the book he told John to eat the book because now he wants the treasure in the earthen vessel he wants that treasure in you he wants his word in you so because it is your defense when I see the Blood I pass over you somebody she it is that treasure hallelujah there's a time to sold JA this old clay jar was empty hallelujah but when God filled me ha man he filled me up with himself hallelujah now I got God in the job somebody help me I got God in the jaw hallelujah Hey look at that lightbulb look at these lights what is that it's a confinement in container amen and when you see this container is like it's glowing Alleluia why God is in the job hallelujah glory to God sealed up and you can't even break it mmm he said we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body I wanted to be made manifest hallelujah they said I said I wasn't gonna tell nobody but I couldn't keep it to myself hallelujah Oh glory to God all of a sudden the joy of the Lord began to bubble up on the inside up Harley oh come on somebody mm remember a man with Atos it's awesome that old woman Amen who was also fistic ated had other club a social club and she thought well my daddy's old Holy Roller I need

Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever see we won't yesterday and forever but he declared himself to be the same God today hallelujah he's a God that changes now hallelujah and I'm going to tell you something we're getting ready to do something that no other they offered this way we know a man that Enoch was translated you know that Enoch defeated death death supposedly had a right because that old squadra Satan had the keys of death hell and the grave and death had a right to hold him but she Enoch was a special agent he came down from heaven they meant to prove to the devil he meant God got a remedy yeah if God can translate one he can translate a billion a trillion he can translate any and every one he wants to translate oh my god I'll be honest with you I wouldn't mind having a trip trip like Phillip honey do we huh Amen oh my Phillip was translated hallelujah right into the desert I don't mind having one like that but that's my inheritance oh come on somebody that's my inheritance and when God want to get you somewhere at a fast pace he can do it well glory to God and we find out in my email was translated I'm sure the devil was so embarrassed somebody broke his lock somehow the keys of death somebody unlocked the door me knock y'all hear me and he could complain to God with God you know according to it alright I am supposed to you know the God the Lord will say you know you need to hush because in reality I'm the one with the title deed you just making people think you are the one you just a squatter on my property and I'm God I can do what I want to do hallelujah oh but he gonna be shook up we've been talking about this rapture for some time now you're gonna see some translations going on and God just not gonna take us out of here but he gonna let us walk around 30 to 40 days hallelujah I don't know what all gonna happen during that day but all of him will know that their day will soon arrive when they and their masters will be caught and thrown into the lake of higher [Music] hmm God's property and he paid the price for it hallelujah listen nobody knew and that's what encouraged me it gives you wrapped in faith see law can't give you wrapped in fakes only when you can trust God's grace hallelujah wherever he leads me I'll follow right and you gotta understand it is it is His grace that makes you rapture Eddie come on you said what do you mean abraham believed God and God accounted his as righteousness earlier and the bride believes God because she's Abraham's seed and God counts is that righteousness you righteous yes I saw you do something but I believe the word is right I might be wrong a thousand times a day but the world is right hallelujah Lord a god you love the Lord oh my I can see all heaven y'all know heaven had a good time y'all people I don't understand it people don't people a hell look having this Pentecostal they don't they don't play in heaven you understand me heaven worship God like no other place on earth or in earth above earth wherever you want to say it heaven worship God hallelujah especially the redeemed oh come on some honey that's why David said let the redeemed say so can you imagine yeah we don't have the imagine y'all know what kind of prison we were once in and God has set us free hallelujah all we can do is say hallelujah listen I can't see it but I believe it because I believe it I can see it well the lujah heaven no play Amen when that time came when that lamb that book had to be open I anticipation I don't know how you know the awesomeness of what was going on there nothing I can I don't know what it was like but I can see everybody anticipating here was John carrying on and he couldn't see it he didn't understand it it meant that he was a man there's nobody to open the book he said I look down in the region I look in that region I look at this image and I look in that dimension and nobody was worth it to lose the book no need to read it but then that Ava said Oh John don't you weep don't we John the Lion of the tribe of Judah he has prevailed and John says I just said quietly and watch no sir the Bible said Oh Oh heaven hurry hide John saying glory honor oh wow these are laughs oh he just he's shook it up up there and don't you know that represents the bride the bride isn't that supposed to sit quiet she supposed to worship hallelujah worship Him for what because he was the one that redeemed you he's the one that claimed you hallelujah he did not come back to claim us we still would be on the shelf somewhere Lord a god but that he brought that book he took the book out of him that said on the right hand oh come on somebody said on the right hand of the throne he took the book he was the only one worthy who Jesus was the only one worthy Jesus Christ was the only one worthy hallelujah then he made you worthless he made me worthy hallelujah John go get the book hallelujah go get the book John John take the book don't refuse

just quote the scripture right Oh God so good to us amen now our kids with his handed the Seventh Seal book of redemption from the original oh now when we lost it at the Garden of Eden through Adam it went back to the original owner but there's been a poacher on the land a squatter and that's Satan he comes over he's he's a poacher a squatter man how I could say something right now but I better not

inheritance it's how he got you back harlot oh lord help us Jesus is so is so wonderful he breaks to see his reveals give us his inheritance give us his inheritance to his people he gives the inheritance that he inherited becoming kinsman redeemer and freely giving out to us it all belongs to him he was the one who redeemed but instead of keeping it himself he gives it back to the people

because if you don't take heed you might fall right you can't take the devil and you think you can how could I say take him for granted like hey I'm all right now I'm all right I'm all right no it's time to keep watching you keep taught you got to keep playing call that devil is trying to set you backwards I understand me hallelujah but when God it doesn't hook that fish y'all know what it is to fish come on some time and get snagged on something but you got your fish and you got to learn how to work it right to get that fish out y'all God is a master fisherman hallelujah and once he gets his hook in you amen you might have your problems you might do things you shouldn't do but God gonna reel you in God done called you you can't get away from his car he's gonna reel you in even if you got

made a lot of them hallelujah everybody ought to be saying Amen in here it's the truth all of us ain't none of us know hey don't don't don't don't line the house of God none of us have done all right but my by the grace of God when they say how did you overcome later see it all you can say is by the grace of God God ain't looking at the outside God looking at the inside and I tell you what just like I tell people I say you know what there was a man who I baptized in when he was drunk and some people wouldn't done that for some reason I always ask God to give me the heart of a person let me see what's in their heart and I baptized that man when he was drunk and when he came up he was sober Wow cuz drunkenness a number demons and demons don't like the name of Jesus hallelujah he couldn't get sanctified but he probably wanted to be he came out in what I even baptized a man who was a drug addict i baptize when God did such a wonderful thing to him he said can we do it again I say anger hurt nobody hallelujah he said I shouldn't have done it yeah I did it and man it was the first one that counted but a second one went gonna hurt something inspired him to say it when the devil was it hallelujah now I've been listen so we understand Satan possess I'm thinking over there and he didn't want to give it up right then y'all know what I'm saying how many of us who walked through sanctification and we feel and we got up we fail and we got up we fail and we got up but one day it clicked y'all hear me one day that revelation struck me I don't have to do this I don't have even will to do this and once I saw it was my wheel that was yielding I shut him down ha ha ha doctor wheeled out not by my power by his power saying the possession of it now is a squatter he is finally he don't want to give it up right quick he went out here a little later on in the scripture I think over here in another chapter and he didn't want to give it up right away but he had to fight he had to fight over it but finally when he was brought to the showdown he was cast into the lake of fire mmm and all that God is doing it all God has done in all what God is gonna do he's gonna rapture so many folks and you know what Satan stealable to give it up tane gonna be locked up a man for a thousand years and then released and he still don't want to give it up so God a man said now now is your end

that didn't come from me they going to we getting rid of all the trash y'all said you shouldn't call him trash we getting rid of all the cannon fodder hmm hallelujah is that okay and Christ is just listen I love this he said when our Redeemer redeem when our kinsman redeemer become Jesus Christ he become the son of David which is heir to the throne glory he's heir to the throne by being a son of David God taught or told back there that he would never leave David never leave David with our seed Christ is the son of David and he becomes our kids my redeemer waiting and getting ready and getting a place ready to well he can reign with us as the son of David he's heir to the throne as the son of Abraham he's heir to the royal grant Amen that's right he's heir to the Royal Grant Palestine and all that's in her Abraham see he was a son of Abraham and the son of man what does the son of man what did that man loose he lost the earth so also as a son of man he's an heir to everything in the earth all this he's got and he's got to give it back up then he returned back as he was now then as the son of God he's heir inheritance he and Erik all things and as the son of David he's heir to the throne and the son of Abraham him he's heir to the royal grant as a son of man he's heir to the earth and a son of God he's heir to all things in heaven and earth oh my that's our Redeemer our kinsman redeemer y'all understand me whatever he's heir of you are - can I read a couple more we'll get on to everything else notice what did we lose what did we lose well it was given the Adam to have eternal life as long as he eat from the tree he had eternal life and we notice again that Adam Rossi he inherit the earth he was like an amateur God over the earth the earth was his everything was given unto his hand he couldn't do with it whatever he could do with it whatever he wanted to he named it and he called it and done whatever he wanted to he was truly a son of God now in the fall Adam forfeited the title deed to that he fought affinity to Satan Satan took the title deed Abraham was Adam was very slothful and he did not redeem his right rights for he could not redeem his right but Satan which does not rightfully own it but possesses that he is the god of this earth the Bible says so he possessed that not because that he really rightfully gets it but he possess it now do you get it Satan possesses it that he holds it into his hand death is in there his hand the earth is in his hand that world belongs to him every nation to him the governs in the controls the world and everything in the world Satan does you see Jesus knew who he was he told Pilate he said you ain't got no power and the only power that you have is what my father gave you shut him up shut him up right Amen but thanks God we're not the world there's there you are see I don't mean the church he don't he don't control the church he just controls the world he said they were kids and he's the god of the world Jesus said he was he is he's the god of this earth has blinded the eyes of the people the god of this earth he's the God of heaven and now he's rightfully don own don't rightfully don't get his own this he don't own it he does not own it right but he forfeited and Abraham forfeited the title deed to it to this all this stuff that we own eternal life and inheritors of the earth jesus said in Matthew blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth see and look it wasn't it wasn't to Adam or any of his see Adam seed absolutely lost everything - it's not see seed of Adam no matter how much we try to beautify this world and how much we try to make big thick fine homes and things it still doesn't belong to Adam see no sir it did not go to Adam see no sir because Satan took it lock stock and barrel now am i yes so many things could be said I just want I just don't want to take too much of your time he possessed it but he doesn't not he does not rightfully only a Satan doesn't I see and when the rightful owner right for owner owner lost it there only one way that he it can be redeemed that's that by a near kinsman it's the only one who can rightfully redeem it now of course this we have in the virgin birth of Jesus Christ right a kinsman redeemer I'm closing on on Ephesians three now we understand that all that God has given us when that book was open the inheritance was given is up to you and how to release it it's already released but you've got to take it you got a you got to have it out like this and and receive it unto yourself right because he's done it all all of your healing all of your deliverance is everything that God has done is given to you and guess what because it's yours you don't have to beg for it but you got to ask and faith that's what he said when you ask in faith it shall be done that's not wavering oh I feel like it or I feel goosebumps running up and down my spine my hairs are standing up on me and he'll surely he's here hallelujah I don't need all of that I thank God for but I know he's in me because he said I'll never leave it nor forsake you I always be with you remember I told you that even when I die his spirit is gonna rest on my bones your bones it wasn't just Elijah bones at the spirit restaurant Amen that means God possessed it and not even Satan can do nothing about it hallelujah this plot of land is holy hallelujah I'm just gonna read Ephesians excuse me 3 through 10 blessed be the god of our Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according he have chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will his will not even yours his will a to the praise of the glory of His grace when he have made us but accepted in the beloved made us accepted you are accepted not by power not by mine but by my spirit it's not him then will it nor he that running a God that shows mercy in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace wherein he had bounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will oh did he do it according to his good pleasure with ear purposed in himself honey this is how I did it honey how did you do this this is how I did sweetheart that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth you can't have it no you got that which belong to you on earth and in heaven and in him all of him had to be poured into you piece by piece that's what a devil like to keep us divided because he know we joined together we've become a mighty body whoo that's Dan got a release it is in you you got a release it Sheila God is good to us amen became better

praise His name as we stand weary from first Corinthians the 11th chapter we'll read the twenty-third verse come down to the 31st well I have received the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup but he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause are many weak and sick be among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together went to condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come
