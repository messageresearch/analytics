TRANSCRIPT
========================================
in our bi there to just get the feast proper before we get to the background of it chapter 2 to keep you standing otherwise I would have picked it from the background but let's just pick it from the front back act chapter the second chapter and we're going to read from verses 1 to 4 and when the day of Pentecost was fully C they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clo tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of themen and there appeared unto them clo tongues uh sorry verse four and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance thank you God bless you may be seated yeah like I I've announced to you the subject of uh the happenings around Pentecost the happiness around the Feast of Pentecost because I move because this all right thank you y okay all right so as I've so we're thinking tonight on um a great subject before us and uh if you Familiar of course with the scriptures I was actually originally thinking the because I I came in last Wednesday just a week today now the morning of Thursday I was the first news I heard was the passing of our precious brother Billy Paul and I was I knew there was going to be a lot of issues around it because the enemies of the Cross and the message you use it at a very big Feast I intended I had intended and I brought to speak on that particular subject there's a lot of stuffs around some prophecies and people are talking all kinds of stuff I wanted us to deal with it but after having a good time talking with the pastor today I realize is not of the school is not of those kind of people that are that are having doubt so I I felt with a pastor like that the church would be solid had an idea that this church has finished shopping long ago not shopping for Truth for those shopping for truth you need to do a lot of work there so I felt it would not be Soo necessary to speak on that particular and then so I thought about speaking on something on something else so I just kind of change it and uh uh the Pentecostal Feast is a very great feast in the Bible it's a very great feast as a matter of fact it is uh one of the most cre feasts and that is why the Bible was very explicit upon it in the New Testament like I told you the if you looking at the at the scriptures the Bible recorded it in the first four verses of the book of act chapter 2 the that thing was actually to last throughout all the seven churches and as a matter of crossed into eternity but that just gives you the actual happenings of the of the Feast of Pentecost see if you look at the Bible one of the biggest problem of the Gentiles they they don't the Gentile world does not understand God they don't understand does not understand what we are talking about the Christianity as a program to the Gentile world is just one of the things that happens to you along your life's journey they don't and that is why they missed it they don't understand for this purpose you remember P Pontius pilot one time our Lord Jesus Christ are you King he said for this cause was I born for this cause the Gentile world has not do not understand that we were like the house of Israel which is understand that we we were not people that were born and came to discover God no no you not people that were born and they were just living their life and along the line to find out that there was somebody we were actually dispatched from home sent on assignment actually purposely built for this cause for thisa were we BN we don't understand Pentecost as what the way the rest of the world looks at it's not something that happened to us that we are part of and is a that is the reason why to to the children of Israel this is what Mak peuli this is what make the Israel of God which is peculiar understand it's a program actually if you look at the Bible you can broadly divide what you call the old and the New Testament you can broadly divide it into five sections you you got the first part which is called the old test the first part of it which is called the Old Testament which is veryy covering about 4,000 years you that first part actually the preparation of God is the preparation for the program now the gospels the gospels the Old Testament is the preparation for the gospel pration for the program now the gospels have as Matthew Mark L joh is the manifestation of what God SP 4,000 years preparing for the physical manifest is the manifestation of is the is bringing this program which was which was in mind it become solid it become physical it becomes tangible and visible where El it was it was it was in the mind it become physical become something tangible something we can feel something we can touch something we can relate with because God does not want us we cannot Thrive dealing with Christianity as a belief the message of the to us this is why we cannot think of going back it's not a belief you know what you believe this is this is United States of America right is it actually a belief is it this is United States right I believe it you believe it is it actually a belief it is not a belief it's said it's it's a reality it's a you are part of it it's not that you don't believe no it's it's real it's tangible you are a part of it it's a part of you the message of the hour the kingom of God this is Kingdom this is the the government of United States that is why we also have Kingdom the kingdom of God which is called the message of the hour for us it is not a belief you can deny belief you cannot deny reality for people that are turning back on it it's a belie a belie it's not a belie us just a Bel it's a thing it's a reality we feel it we know it we touch it it's touching us we that is why Jesus said he said you know what he told he said I know God and if I should say I don't know him I'll be a liar like you I know him I know him it's not just a belief I testify what I see why we we we we we we know this thing God know the message of we feel it it does something we should say we do not we will become Liars that the message is not true we'll be lying we will be lying to ourselves I don't want I don't I don't want to be a liar I want to be honest I want to tell truth so now so you find out you have those 4,000 years of preparation then the you have the gospels marthew Mark Luke and John and a half years of the Manifest becomes tangible and AUD amen it's moved Beyond a belief and then then you have that's the second thing now I told you preparation then the manifestation then you have the book of Acts which which follows Matthew Mark mthk L as the propagation that is the the circulation of it throughout all the world and then you have the Epistles that follows the book of Acts as the explanation as the clarity to make it clear and then you have the Book of Revelation as the consumation they wrap it up and it back to where it was at the beginning now that is the reason why to the Pentecostal Furs it was not just something that just happened and they just believe and deny later so here we are so here we are uh you you find out this few verses that we read the book of Acts the background of it the details what you these few things that you read in the book of act chapter [Music] 2 need to go back to find the details of the program and the details of the Feast of Pentecost actually there are seven feasts of the Lord in the Bible all right there are seven feasts you need to read I'm sorry this is we need to take like a detail study seven feasts in the Bible you go to the Book of Leviticus 23 leus 23 you find in lus 23 Al Exodus 23 23 deom 16 there are seven FS you will understand something it has always been at the back part of God's all along from the that is the reason why read the Bible like Gentiles we must not read the Bible like G actually I don't know if you have the if you have the the the this particular kind of Bible that has the Hebrew translation of that they have the Hebrew letters TI together with English brother used it actually for studies I want us to go you will notice that in the book of in the book of uh in the Book of Genesis chapter 1 if you are reading verse 14 I don't know if you can be following with me if you are reading verse 14 you something there said and God said let there be light in the perament of Heaven to divide the day from the night let let there be light let there be for signs and for seasons and for days and for years for a regular Gentile what comes to your mind when you reading season is the Autumn right you know the summer the winter and that's what comes to your mind that's that's not the T here you go back to the original the word the Hebrew word translated there I wish you have that particular software that the prophet that has the Hebrew you just click on it and transfer you to the Hebrew word you just click on that word season and then the Hebrew word if you take this word Seasons here you will be surprised if you go to the book of if you go to the book of lus 23 vers 23 ver4 you are going to be surprised to find out are the feasts of the Lord now you're going to find out that what translated feast in Leviticus these are the feasts of the Lord even the holy conation which you shall Proclaim inia going to find out that Fe here and the season here was exactly the same one God used in the Book of Genesis the word the word season in Genesis 114 the same word Fe season in Genesis 14 at the back of God's mind even when there was yet no man God programmed this world to make the word that means appointed time for Gathering God in in creating the light of the Sun and the Moon to be for calling Israel call it's not just for entertainment it's not just for time to Gant around and jump up and down and go to work you and work and go work and we reduce Bill bills bills just work pay bill just work pay bill just work pay bill just work pay bill until you grow old and you expire you understand we just we we distort we distort the program of life that man shall not live man shall live by bills just just become you just we just become Servants of our system we become in the mind of God at the back of his mind the Sun the moon and the light were all designed to be able to be sounding alarm to raise alarm to signs the children it is time to gather to do convocate it is time to gather around for the worship of the master for the worship of the Lord that is what the Bible says here the conclusion of the matter worship that is the idea that is why you are here you are not here to eat and to drink and to live on the fruit of the earth and then you die if you are here to eat and drink and give to children and raise them up what are you doing different from a goat do you hear me I said if your purpose is to B to grow Mar a wife children raise them up to become old marry again and then you what have you done different from a goat what what have you done different don't were they not born were goats not born yes sir don't they struggle to eat don't they go about every day looking for what to eat don't they raise their children so what would be your difference what would be your difference how do we reduce life it's a break in the heart of God man that he made to be a part of a Heavenly Host to be a part of a kingdom for service for things that are higher things that are noer has become reduced eat and drink and build house and build a house and beautiful cars and at the end of the day what happen this is why you find out at the back part even for creating the Sun and the Moon and the lights a part of the things when it is setting is calling you it is time for service time for worship it is a call so that is why you need if you go back so we're going to read now let us get the background of the Feast of Pentecost fast I don't know you don't giveing me time and it's it's a problem to me you know all right now let's let's let's let's go I want this listen now let's start from verse no let's let me take it to four because of time these are the feasts of the Lord which ye shall Proclaim right now these feasts are seven in number can you flush it for me I want because of time I want just just let no no no the fist the the chat the chat I the chat I gave you I want us to look at it let's look at the chat I gave you yeah thank you see can you look at it here these are the scriptures you got why the rest of the Gentile world that's why if you no this the scriptures have you ever read a scripture that say and the Lord spake unto Moses and say speak unto the people of the world have you ever said and the Lord SP Moses and say speak to the people are people everywhere are there not people everywhere is it not God made them right God made them did you ever hear the Lord spake unto Moses and say speak on to the peop of the world what do you read and the Lord spake on MTO the children of Israel speak on Church speak to them because they were made for a purpose they understand why they are here speak on the children of Israel these are my feasts shall Proclaim their Seasons even the holy convocation holy what [Music] conv I want to look at it here there are seven of them this is Feast of the Passover can

Feast of Tabernacles as the all right now if you watch very carefully you will notice that I'm coming back I'm coming to eat now you will notice that I I I don't have the time to go into all of this and let you see the implication or did for you so that you see you will become we will become fools and people unless we can see ourselves in the program unless we can see that we are part of this thing and this thing is part of us are of Destiny we are not RS we not RS we are not stray yellings that are made for amen no no no no no no no no we were made on purpose we were designed for purpose and for the purpose is for the praise and the glory of our God we cannot do anything different that is why say me me if I live another life this is life to me it's not a belief we cannot turn back upon the word of God we can't turn back upon the message because it is a life to rest it is not a belief not a that those that are those are following beliefs can go back for this is who we are I remember I remember some years back I had the privilege of being in Israel a tour of the holy land and then we met this lady she was one of the guides and she was kind of maybe late 30s almost 40 and she was single was and then we got talking she was one of the guides said we found out that she will be interested in getting married just like God made it for every normal woman then we said what if you could you could get to a husband from from Africa from will you oh when you follow you get married you got to follow your husband she looked at us and smile said no he said Israel is me I am isra is I can't deny myself is is me I am that is how it works this message is me and I am it to destroy it is to destroy myself to deny it is to deny myself there's no other way there's no other way it's a matter of Destiny praise be to God so I want you to look at it so if you look at this church you see that the feast are seven and you will see that Pentecost stand right in the middle number four and three this side and it stands like in the middle of them all watch something now I was talking to you about happenings around Pentecost if you go to the Book of Leviticus chter 23 8 to 15 no chapter 23 vers 15 to 21 sorry vers 15 to 21 because of time I I don't want to go into all read you can you can mark it down 15 to 21 and then you would you will see let's read this one no no no I'll read the other one you will notice there a specific way that F of Pentecost what you saw that happened do you notice in the in the book of act chapter 2 the Bible say when the day of Pentecost was fully come it is this particular Fe now if you look at it these are the details of the observance we keep talking you know talk to a regular Pentecost Church PC no idea of of feast of Pentecost and this is why they float they do not see it as a destiny this is why what God is doing trying to do to you is to blow off all the sons all the blow up all the shifting and anchor you way down upon the Rock of Ages which is the word of God and you rem steadfast standable [Applause] abiding always abiding you can not be firm you canot the of the ground to [Music] you theck the rock the rock until your anle holds and your anle Can Only Hold upon the revelation of the word this is why when the word of God is hidden from you then anchor is hidden from you now look at it and he shall count unto you from the tomorrow after the Sabbat from the day that you brought the she of the W [Music] offering shall be complete that is where you get the word Pentecost seven Sabbath is seven days so if you count seven Sabbath it gives you 49 now you have to start it on the Sunday watch where do you start counting from where do you start counting from let's look at the next verse you will notice it is

us now listen close onto the Tom after the seven number and shall bring out of your this is the details he give them because of time I can't go to all of this but let's turn to something this is an Leviticus 23 open up the details of the observance of the Feast of Pentecost to the church now Deuteronomy chapter 16 give another side and more details to what should happen in that and unless you put the two together you cannot understand what happened on the and what is actually happening to you I want us to look to sorry turn to deom go to verse let's start from verse verse 8 sorry you say

I want to notice this everybody is inv and son and daughter and stranger and the fatherless and the Widow that are among you is a great time in the place which the Lord th God has chosen to place his name there so you can see let's hold that in our mind let's hold that in our mind while we tie it together now for the stus I guess few of us realize this that from the archives few of us realize in the [Music] message I have all the documents the first name of the Bram Tabernacle the Pres Bram Tabernacle when brother Bram took it over was the Pentecostal church that was the name and why it was actually named the Pentecostal church is what it was and that is what every Church in all ages should be must a church in this age that actually not Pentecost but the prophet went further to explain that I didn't mind you I didn't say Pentecostal organization do you remember the song heally sing though these people may of what live him they have how many of them have received in Jes not both far and wide is the same on the day of Pentecost the same running through it was remember it was for seven Sabbath and that seven Sabbath signifies seven Church ages is supposed to live on a story was supposed to have a contact orinal fire in his otherwise you cannot keep a holy convocation why a lot of assemblies in the message Unholy Unholy convocations Unholy righteous congregations as a matter of fact scripturally it is called synagogue a lot of churches are synagogues which is an aggregation of all kinds of mind that are flowing the same direction for the real [Music] redeemed they have all received I want to notice Pentecost baptized in Jes that is the way it is for every Church to be for that's is why throughout the church including this church by the fire of Pentecost you know what every with a song and a smile F my way every the love is the for how long for how long all the with what a song There Is No say let he say you must never have a thr on your face but you know some of us we acquaintances withing always always serious always always tightening up and there is something wrong you are not in the Feast of Pentecost happen around Pentecost a song and as says Sing he said obey my instruction sing all the day long not a anywhere not a FR on your face with a song and a smile the thing that is actually responsible for your smile do you notice this it's not just that you are happy go and check it happiness means response to happiness that is why you get happy now something happen you are responding to what happing but it was what they had was a joy joy is a noun it's a person it's a personality inside there you don't even know why just it's a reality just there somebody there actually there's somebody living there there is actually somebody living there that is why you are never lonely to occupy yourself with phones that why a lot of you if you lose your phone you go wild you go mad because that is your companion because there is an inside here the way this Christ is living here it is a company every day it is a s and smile you do not need you do not need the portions of this life you do not need games you don't need games you don't need whiskey you don't need drinks you don't need you don't need to get promotion you don't need to get a house even without knowing where the meal is coming from there is somebody living here praise be to God if you understand this we're coming down here now that is why the Feast of Pentecost is a great time among the Believers did you notice this to show you how true it is do you notice this that the Lord Jesus in act 1 7 and actually forbid them to move around if forbid them to move around don't go out please give me the chat again we are dealing with what happenings the Feast of Pentecost here I want to notice something here now the feast I give you the background to understand Feast of Pentecost re your was a great time is the greatest of time only thing that he follows is Passover why if you notice Pentecost cannot come before Passover is the beginning of all feasts and as a matter of fact it is the C of all because that was Christ standing at the gate to give a welcome mat back all the children that are lost in in car of this world in trespasses andl it is the welcome M back for them okay the Feast of Pentecost was a great time for the Believers in the land of The Seven Feast I told you of the of all the seven feasts F uh this Feast of Pentecost set is set in the middle he has three this side side and sandwiched in the middle watch it and now of The Seven Feast again there were if you read Leviticus no not lus now yeah if you read Le 23 you notice the Bible said three times shall your three times shall your M shall your children appear before the Lord in a year there are three actually what you call The Seven Feast it's a breakup of three major feasts the f are actually three major and feast of the Passover feast of Pentecost and Feast of Tabernacles you have the three major Feast please I don't know I do I need to read that I could just you can just go and check it in leus 23 you have three major Feasts that is if you notice this can you notice this this is this is the first major feast and Carries two ERS to follow it those two others were like minor ones not unimportant that so they go together with this that is why you see this one is on the 14th Feast of on 11 bread is sorry I'm sorry Feast of Passover is on the 14th Friday the 14th that was why Jesus Christ was crucified on day after that you will notice the Bible said they those people could not touch the this thing because they want to be able to enter to the Feast of unle bread and they must not touch the Dead the 11 bread starts on April the 15th and last the 21st 16th you have the Shi wave the first sh which is why Jesus asked to resurrect but on Sunday as the first fruit which was sh the Bible say if the first fruit be holy the lump then the rest of the seed coming the rest of it include me means I am already accepted we are not struggling for acceptance the Bible say having accepted Us in the below having accepted Us in the past over prise to God that is why it's a great time of rejoicing for the s the unbelievers are the unbelievers are busy drinking the Believers busy and and and and and they sitting at the feet of Jesus and they rejoicing and they saying oh my God what a mighty God what a God of Lord what a God of Grace and they singing Oh Praise My Soul the king of heaven and they telling themselves imortal invisible God only wise from our eyes most glorious most gracious Ancient of Days Almighty Victorious great name we pra givers to both great in all life thest oh the fullness of [Music] all and flourish as leaves on the tree and wither and perish be none

The Journey because that is what user them to the new program the New Kingdom know going friend we we we not follow faes we we are coming from somewhere and we are headed home that is why we can Rejoice we know what we are talking about our lot is not a lot of sadness encourag every day and somebody need to sit by you encourage pleas no sir you are the one encouraging others praise be to God praise be to God hallelujah now I need to bring something to you if you notice this interesting you know what the life of Israel and when I say Israel it will be a very dangerous thing for you to disconnect yourself from Israel You're look the Israel you are looking there is a shadow does a shadow cause an object or an object cause a shadow which is which it is the presence of an object that is responsible for the presence that is why brother did not preach Israel he preached is shad Shad of the Bride is what this is [Laughter] Israel go to the new the Bible call this is the Israel of God you don't not be looking and say oh wow oh this is isra this is the shadow you see that that one cannot be destroyed it means the object cannot be destroyed even though surrounded by enemies it can never go down because God say I the Lord have planted it I will water it let me tell you no matter what you do 10,000 John callings 10,000 callings can never bury the message it's impossible the cops will cannot stay inside the ground it will end up buring every one of them word of the hour was in the beginning was the word the word was with God in the beginning was the message the message is not 21st century in the beginning before came before believe came before in the beginning was the message and the message was with God and the message was God all that happened in Mal is that it became flesh amen what is all the noise about what all the noise about with this hallelujah amen hallelujah yes sir praise be of God for those of you expecting God to open websites to defend himself have you noticed cheap cheap evangelist open website have you ever seen website of goaa it is truth that is why it does not respond to arguments does not respond to silly [Music] allegations I want you to notice something Israel isra It's A peculiar Nation if you look at the book of It's A peculiar Nation see the church PEC very few but let's leave that let's go now you notice something that in Exodus chter 5 and you will notice that God told the people now if you in indeed obey my voice and keep what Covenant you know con it's something that connect two people together God is connected with this Bri amen you understand it is not my program you know what program not progam he said you it didn't say your Covenant I want then you shall be what PE treasure unto me people even though all the is

hair don't tell anybody you went to sacrifice your [Music] hair it's not a sacrifice C it was disturbing you it's not it's not a sacrifice sacrifice sacrifice means sacrifice f up things that are there that's right giving up things that are there did you notice he had to give up ISAC when God wanted to establish that Covenant he asked the most difficult thing because people the of Abraham to anything because the love of Jesus is far greater than your connection with your wife that is why he that love father or mother or sister or brother or work let me tell you brother I don't care if it's United States or it's in UK or it's in Africa this is not an African message it's not a United States message brother said miss work but don't miss church you hear that said brother said miss work may I tell you only the Seed of Abraham can do that I used to tell the people how how can you pay tight when you didn't pay tight how can you how can you pay did sayi he paid he PID tight in Abraham because he paid by the time he came here out of Lo he he will have to pay because he has [Music] paid maybe you don't get me do you know why the shadow of my hand is moving can you you know why it's moving does this Shadow have an option if I move like this does he have an option can he say I'm not moving he cannot say so you understand because this person moved he must move because life is here and the life of Levi was inside the genetic constitution of Abraham what happened has to happen here and if you were there if you were there said you can hardly wait for them doors to open you will be right there God pays bills God does things you fail just little little tests this train of Abraham God asked him to give what is De to him kingom of what go to the New Testament was that what Peter said first 2: you are royal so the priesthood was carried to the New Testament was carried onto me the Bible say he amen you cannot be getting the title of an eagle and you cannot pick a chicken get the title of e Eagle is not a title is a character amen praise spirit of God praise be to God so have you noticed it kingdom kingdom means system is a system of system headed by a king which is the king is the king of the priests I want you to watch something now have you notice that God proclaimed both the Believers in the Old Testament and the church in the New Testament he proclaimed them to be what [Music] priests to them an IDE idea if they have a desire if they have a desire if they have a desire if they hold an idea if they have a plan God said it must not be they don't ask

Zion great is the Lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our God and in the mountain of his Hool beautiful for situation and as as they running back home they matching it's it's an Ascension it's a holy convocation they feel happy they feel special they are special people nobody like them in all the and they matching Z beautiful and they would tell them and each person that is why David

office let go do you get happy to go to work are you glad you go because you must work this one gives you what Joy you feel you are invited to the table of Lord young you young man you are invited to

remain in their homes that in their offices let them be those who never knew our god do you notice it they remain this are special Feast before the daily sacrifice 16 17 18 19 21 for unle bread and then again by the time they finishing it's time to begin then they start counting can you see their lives seven sabbaths have you noticed that from pass over to Pentecost it is as if they never return home it is the day they finish the Feast of Pentecost remember they started April 14th after they were like in church all the days wow that is why when the rest of the unbelievers look at them how do you make it how do you do it they tell well it's not me love of jesuses R when they asking how do you make it how do you make it they tell them there is something inil all myor love something makes my heart a blessing makes my life to switch to from day to day there this church and this should be a mystery to the people of our are you getting my point they are like that until June when they celebrate Feast of Pentecost the Feast of pent that is the first time they are dispersed to go home fully that is why from Pentecost until the seventh month there are which is which is a symbol of seven Church ages why they can go home is this oh precious friends sorry to stop it's so sweet you know what did you notice this when they finish keeping the Feast of Passover they were not dispersed to go home when they finished Feast of unle bread Never released to go home they come back the feast off sh waving are you with me they were still not released in what Fe did they release them for a long period of years of seven Church it is of Pentecost the token of your lamp come inside of you you got so that you don't I don't know whether you getting my point when they celebrated Passover they can because if you go you fall back but from Pentecost when you receive the fire god can say you can go and then the power of the Pentecost you and he will keep keeping you near The Cross and you will never be able to this is why Jesus said you in the upper room the Pascal L has been offered to them the Pas L has been offered the of 11 bre was going on was going to begin Jesus never relee them he said receive Pentecost after P the church can start the seven Church ages and by the seventh month there's going to be a t trumpet that will gather them back again toer them back into the Millennium
