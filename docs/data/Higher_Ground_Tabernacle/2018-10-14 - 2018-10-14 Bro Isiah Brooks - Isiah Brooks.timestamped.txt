[10:00] [Music]
[10:08] hey if you ever heard a song like that
[10:15] song at a football game they got it from
[10:18] the church we suck we supposed to do it
[10:24] yeah
[10:27] they stole it from the church but I
[10:29] didn't know that until I came into the
[10:31] church evening yeah we used to say how
[10:51] team is so awful in it but you know God
[11:00] is good too is a the Lord allowed us to
[11:02] do such foolish yes thank the Lord
[11:08] we're going to be coming from Psalms the
[11:10] 93rd chapter of verse that division nah
[11:20] Psalms a nine then Psalms 91 I know the
[11:25] Lord just led me to these Scripture it's
[11:29] amazing talking about I want to say we
[11:35] talk about the Thunder that shakes the
[11:36] devil you know everybody talked about
[11:39] thunders yeah but there is a thunder
[11:42] that shakes the devil and you and I must
[11:46] understand Amen that as I was saying
[11:49] last week God is not through with us yet
[11:53] and we're moving forward in God and I'm
[12:00] happy to know that there's something
[12:03] changing in me every day
[12:06] and that that's something is Jesus and
[12:10] saying we've got our brother Gabrielle
[12:14] with us he fellowship there in Iowa City
[12:18] and he's from Cedar wrap it up amen he
[12:23] has some personal issues that he needs
[12:24] to attend to but we don't want to
[12:27] dismiss service without praying for him
[12:29] he has some special requests and we're
[12:33] not gonna speak what they are but I just
[12:35] know that God will answer prayer amen
[12:39] Psalms 93 and five it says that
[12:43] testimonies are very sure holiness
[12:47] becometh thy house o Lord forever Psalms
[12:57] 911 911
[13:06] 91911 reads he that dwelleth in the
[13:09] secret place of the Most High shall
[13:12] abide under the shadows of the Almighty
[13:16] I will say of the Lord he is my refuge
[13:20] and my fortress my god in him will I
[13:25] trust let's go back to Psalms 9 1 1 91 1
[13:38] and 9 1 1 I figure these are emergency
[13:41] scriptures Psalms 911 Psalms 911 sings
[13:54] praises to the Lord with dwelleth in the
[13:57] Zion declare among the people is doing
[14:02] now think about those two scriptures
[14:05] that are just read both are talking
[14:07] about God's dwelling 991 1 and it's so
[14:14] amazing that God is perfect in his math
[14:16] and how he set things up in the
[14:19] scripture but we think about what God
[14:23] has told us and we see that God in his
[14:27] and his element is perfect he's in all
[14:32] above all through all and there's no way
[14:37] of getting around him he's so high you
[14:41] can't get over him he's so low you can't
[14:44] get under him he's so wide you can't get
[14:47] around it and we realize they've been
[14:50] today that that song was perfect to
[14:52] brother so we think God for His grace as
[14:55] we have been talking about your subject
[15:00] stop matter started the life we now live
[15:03] and I said and studied and we talked
[15:06] about it this morning the most precious
[15:08] gift that God can give is his life
[15:14] amazing that he does it in a natural and
[15:18] he gives it in the spirit of spiritual
[15:20] he died that we might have his life and
[15:24] now he's given us his life what amazing
[15:29] amazing grace let us pray Heavenly
[15:33] Father we come before you we thank you
[15:36] for your grace in your mercy
[15:38] we thank you for your love divine and
[15:41] without you Jesus we are nothing father
[15:44] we pray that your perfect will be done
[15:47] we are needed people and father we
[15:51] living in the last days where Satan is
[15:54] distracting so many of us and father is
[15:58] difficult not to be distracted without
[16:00] you so may we abide in the shadows of
[16:04] your wing help us father God that will
[16:07] dwell in that secret place on high in
[16:09] that anointing that we call the Shekinah
[16:12] glory let us be there lord have mercy
[16:15] upon us Lord as we come before you as
[16:18] humbly as we know how thank you for your
[16:20] presence in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[16:23] amen
[16:24] you may be seated
[16:34] discussed and talked about it we
[16:37] realized they men that one thing that as
[16:39] I said earlier when David was saying thy
[16:42] loving-kindness it's better than life
[16:45] and we ourselves those of us who have
[16:50] experienced God in some manner we know
[16:53] that that is true the Bible even tells
[16:56] us that is the love of God that bring
[16:59] men unto repentance now God can spank
[17:02] you and God can do whatever he wants to
[17:05] do but when you see the love of God for
[17:08] you and it causes you to repent that's
[17:11] even more wonderful we showed you by
[17:14] God's grace that if you need something
[17:16] done in God the only way we can achieve
[17:19] that is to have faith in God and faith
[17:22] in his word because God is its word and
[17:26] you and I know that one thing for
[17:29] certain Christianity can it could be
[17:31] mimicked by science you know we we
[17:34] talked about that this morning or
[17:36] preached on it where we talked about how
[17:38] that Christian science can produce or
[17:41] all of the attributes of the spirits you
[17:45] know love and patience and kindness and
[17:47] all of those things
[17:48] brother mantle said they can do it and
[17:52] brother Bellamy goes along and he tells
[17:53] us now we talk about attributes in
[17:56] character
[17:56] he said the high priest and all really
[18:00] in in respect look better than Jesus did
[18:03] he said they were the ones who were
[18:05] kissing the babies and they were the
[18:06] ones at the funeral and they were the
[18:08] ones who fared the poor and needy and
[18:10] things of that nature and here was Jesus
[18:12] with a will amen he said now where was
[18:19] loving-kindness there he said with a
[18:20] whip driving them away from the temple
[18:23] screaming my house should be called a
[18:27] house of prayer it should no longer be a
[18:30] thin of Thieves
[18:31] so when it comes to character I want you
[18:34] to understand by God's grace and we've
[18:36] said there's so many times it's in the
[18:39] seed it is something you cannot produce
[18:43] of your own it has to be in the seed in
[18:47] which God
[18:48] from the foundation of the world but if
[18:52] the seed is ripen if it's lit if it's
[18:55] quickened this seed will break forth of
[18:59] his kind sometime preachers feel and I
[19:03] know this is so true there times that
[19:05] preachers preach one thing and live
[19:07] another and this is why I tried my best
[19:10] by God's grace to live what I preach
[19:13] am i perfect and those things no but
[19:18] that's where the grace of God comes in
[19:20] the Bible tells us that the brother Bram
[19:23] tells us that preachers called to preach
[19:26] and to live it too so it doesn't matter
[19:31] you know you look at a man of God you
[19:34] want to see God's character in him not
[19:37] that you're trying to put him on a
[19:39] magnum flying glass or some kind of
[19:41] telescope examining every part of him
[19:45] but you want to see by God's grace the
[19:48] kind of character the Bible declared
[19:51] that he would have flowing out of you
[19:54] one thing I know about Christ is that he
[20:00] never ever put himself above his
[20:02] disciples he never told them to call him
[20:06] Reverend he never told them to call him
[20:09] Bishop but his name was Jesus he always
[20:14] dwelt among the common people he was so
[20:18] common today felt comfortable talking
[20:23] around him whether it was good or bad
[20:26] they literally talked and discuss things
[20:30] around him knowing he had discernment
[20:33] things that they should not have been
[20:35] discussing and the world corrected them
[20:39] every time one thing about brother
[20:42] Branham I was told that brother Brandon
[20:44] was able to make the least of all at
[20:48] least a min feel like the greatest and
[20:51] so when you're talking to people with
[20:53] Christ in you it's not you puffing
[20:55] yourself up but you humbling yourself
[20:57] and making them feel great then Jesus
[21:02] do it he said Peter except you washed my
[21:05] feet you have no part of me and Peter
[21:12] did not want Jesus to wash his feet but
[21:16] Jesus being God humbled himself y'all
[21:19] hear me I'm talking about the Holy
[21:20] Spirit this is kind of like the Holy
[21:23] Spirit makes you live it doesn't make
[21:27] you want to be one of the great ones it
[21:29] makes you want to be the least hello and
[21:34] when it comes to a preacher a preacher
[21:36] supposed to be in a place where he
[21:38] becomes the least not the greatest hello
[21:42] but his switch is turned around because
[21:45] of nickel Antonin ISM now the preacher
[21:48] becomes king he becomes God
[21:51] that's not Christ that's not the life he
[21:56] lived Jesus was so common it took Judas
[22:00] to identify him with the kiss he didn't
[22:04] wear a special raiment to say I'm there
[22:06] I'm the leader that this group of people
[22:08] you know what I'm saying but he kept in
[22:11] such a way that nobody knew who he was
[22:13] until he was identified by healing he
[22:17] was so common when he told the people
[22:19] amen
[22:20] don't tell nobody what happened here but
[22:24] you know how we are and gotta tell us
[22:27] not to do something we way out there
[22:29] come see the man right now when we talk
[22:34] about this and that's what brother
[22:35] Graham said he said if you can't live it
[22:37] and stop preaching a preacher is coming
[22:42] to a place and I'm not just going to
[22:43] dwell with the preacher cuz I'm coming
[22:45] to you we are the living epistles of God
[22:49] written and read of all men and Jesus
[22:54] bravano said the reason why we are the
[22:56] Pinkney epistles because he said it all
[22:58] to read like this because it is written
[23:02] we are now being read because it has
[23:07] already been written now we are being
[23:10] read and understanding man Mary was
[23:13] written but one day she was read
[23:15] she was a very inversion that the Word
[23:18] of God says she would be Mary didn't
[23:21] know she was that virgin until the angel
[23:23] came to her you didn't even know that
[23:25] you was a son and God of God truly until
[23:28] his angel came to you he was able to
[23:31] identify you in the scripture and
[23:34] somehow we have a problem with it but we
[23:37] I've identified in the scriptures that
[23:39] right you shall bring it to me bring it
[23:42] to me here was ELISA coming down it says
[23:44] Lord the woman a man that give not only
[23:46] the camera water but give my man to
[23:49] drink let it be her
[23:50] and here was Rebekah coming out and
[23:53] guess what she identified she identified
[23:56] herself and brother man said God was
[23:58] working on both ends so God works on
[24:01] both ends you're not supposed to god
[24:04] says oh you the length of God but you
[24:07] don't know it I have chosen you to do
[24:10] this but you don't know it God inspired
[24:14] Rebekah what to do even though she
[24:17] didn't know fully what she was doing he
[24:19] inspired her and then to feed the camels
[24:22] and the men that was her identification
[24:26] because she denied it with the thought
[24:28] of God Abraham was the only I mean Ella
[24:31] here ELISA was the only one that knew
[24:33] the thought of Abraham right she didn't
[24:37] dare she wasn't there when Eliezer cried
[24:39] out Lord I don't know how to choose a
[24:40] bride Amen but you know how to do it let
[24:43] it be thus and God inspire Eloisa amen
[24:47] to lay out the criterias of a wife and
[24:50] in Eleazar look Lord and God inspired
[24:53] Rebekah to do what he required and then
[24:58] Eleazar didn't say well I'm a I'm a man
[25:00] now I'm you know how I haven't found the
[25:03] right no he humbled himself Oh God
[25:07] you have been faithful in your promises
[25:11] when it comes to the Word of God but the
[25:14] bottom said it like this he says no
[25:15] matter how educated you are how much
[25:18] culture you are able to accumulate you
[25:21] you yet
[25:22] you've got to yet face death and because
[25:25] it is written that means must die and
[25:28] that the judgment death is not so bad
[25:31] but coming to the judgement is the bad
[25:34] part now you can die but happened that
[25:38] the judgment and God is not going to
[25:40] inquire of you how much schooling you
[25:43] got when you were on earth and how much
[25:46] knowledge you accumulate it whether
[25:48] you've got a Bachelor of Art or whatever
[25:50] degree of my hair even as a minister
[25:53] he's not going to be required of you but
[25:57] is going to be required of you what you
[25:59] did about the understanding of God's
[26:01] Word that's where the requirement comes
[26:04] because that see your education is fine
[26:08] but the Word of God is life my world is
[26:12] life and to know it is life and he said
[26:15] know him he is the word so you can only
[26:19] know him by the word for he is the word
[26:23] that's the only way you'll know him is
[26:26] by the word see so why that's why we're
[26:30] so important in this day if we're gonna
[26:32] live the word we must have the word we
[26:36] couldn't we you've heard me say this
[26:38] before that's why we were not attracted
[26:40] to Oral Roberts or Billy Graham or Tommy
[26:43] Hicks or any of those those because we
[26:45] were not of that seed and I want to
[26:48] clarify that because I think people
[26:50] misunderstood me one time when I said
[26:52] that see brother Branham didn't have a
[26:54] seed the seed that he sold was God's
[26:56] seed right so when I talk about seeds
[27:00] I'm not talking about amen a man seed
[27:03] I'm talking about God seed right and so
[27:07] we when we talk about uh-uh-uh
[27:10] these men sowing seeds I mean that's why
[27:13] we we weren't able to catch what they
[27:16] were doing we may have seen it we may
[27:18] have admired it but nothing made us
[27:20] attract it like a magnet but when it
[27:23] came to this message and we heard it it
[27:28] attracted us like a magnet hallelujah it
[27:31] caught ahold of us we didn't catch ahold
[27:32] of it
[27:33] it snatched us to it all right and
[27:36] because of that it has identified to us
[27:38] who we really are
[27:41] Oh doesn't make any difference right now
[27:44] and have vowed you might think yourself
[27:46] to be that's not what God is looking at
[27:49] he's looking at the seed that's laying
[27:51] on the inside of you because he know the
[27:54] seed in itself is perfect and it will
[27:56] not come back boy it will accomplish
[28:00] every seed listen whether we see it or
[28:02] not there are trees that are deign to
[28:05] bring forth fruit and there are trees
[28:07] who may be of the same kind of fruit
[28:09] that will never bear you say that in
[28:12] Scripture it is because Jesus came one
[28:15] day to a fig tree and found that fig
[28:17] tree without fruits hello basically it
[28:23] was impersonating a real fruit tree you
[28:27] and I must understand that voices is
[28:29] something I love the way brother Branham
[28:31] pushed this he says thousands of live
[28:33] forces he says all we need in
[28:36] jeffersonville but let me say all we
[28:38] need in the MU and I all we need in Iowa
[28:40] City thousands of little voices the
[28:43] Thunder of God thundering out in
[28:46] sweetness and holiness purity undefiled
[28:49] lives walking around in the earth today
[28:53] without a blemish is there anything too
[29:00] hard for God see what we must understand
[29:03] this scripture is referring to people
[29:06] who have been quickened seas that are
[29:09] living not potential right
[29:15] the foolish version had potential but
[29:17] they needed the line to come alive in
[29:20] them but the only way that the life is
[29:22] going to ever live you must die and rot
[29:26] that is the order of nature in order for
[29:30] seed to reproduce yourself it must die
[29:34] and rot right a man you should all
[29:40] brother was what are you saying but you
[29:41] must also understand the gospel to us
[29:44] did not come in word only but through
[29:47] the power manifestation of the Holy
[29:50] Ghost and in all in other words it is
[29:53] the Holy Ghost
[29:54] taking the Word of God and making it
[29:57] manifest they can never you'll never
[30:01] receive the Holy Ghost I get it if you
[30:03] don't believe it's for you you got to
[30:06] believe that's mine when you approach
[30:09] God you're approachable a bonus Lord you
[30:12] said if I repent like I read this
[30:14] morning and be baptized in the name of
[30:16] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[30:18] sins of my sins you said I would receive
[30:22] the Holy Ghost and Lord you said I now
[30:24] can come boldly before the throne of
[30:27] grace boldly when somebody has promised
[30:32] you something and said they gonna give
[30:33] it to you you don't come up timidly you
[30:35] come up boldly with an assurance that
[30:38] they have promised they gonna give it to
[30:40] you it's there they've got it and that's
[30:43] what God wants he wants you to approach
[30:45] him in faith because you said it I
[30:48] believe it now I want to receive it I
[30:50] come to receive what you told me I was
[30:52] going to happen that's what every
[30:55] attribute every attribute if God says
[30:59] I'm supposed to have godliness I'm gonna
[31:01] approach him with it you said Lord that
[31:04] godliness was mine that you have that
[31:08] for me is that right and brother Ram
[31:11] said listen he said all the potential
[31:14] everything that we need to make a
[31:16] rapture is already in us how many y'all
[31:19] believe that I believe that everything I
[31:22] need to make this rapture is already in
[31:24] me you know what the problem is I got to
[31:27] move out of the way that's what it is
[31:32] Lord I've got to move I've got to
[31:35] surrender hallelujah
[31:38] right understand to live godly is
[31:42] painful huh
[31:46] that's the scripture you will suffer
[31:50] pain sin in itself gonna cause pain
[31:54] spiritual pain you ever been thirsty and
[31:57] couldn't get the water it's a different
[32:00] kind of pain something happens is
[32:03] different kind of painted it can
[32:04] literally cause you to get anxious
[32:07] sometimes I anxiety comes I gotta have
[32:09] water don't give me no kool-aid I won't
[32:12] water it's something about it when you
[32:15] thirst for that you know well nothing
[32:19] else ask a thirsty man in the desert a
[32:23] man he's thirsty been out there for a
[32:25] long time and he wants something to
[32:27] drink and you ask him you won't Pepsi a
[32:29] water promised you he gonna tell you
[32:32] water because God water is God's divine
[32:36] quench the thirst quencher right and
[32:41] that's what he was telling even in the
[32:43] spiritual that's why Jesus I'm the
[32:45] Living Waters I'm the dwell springing up
[32:48] into eternal life I'm it you can't he
[32:52] said listen if you receive this you will
[32:55] never thirst again you won't want
[32:58] nothing else I will this she that's why
[33:03] you don't we y'all know that's the truth
[33:06] we cannot I don't know some people may
[33:08] still be listening to radios and stuff
[33:10] you know gospel stuff and I'm not saying
[33:12] you can't get a little tidbit you might
[33:14] get a little something but normally Amen
[33:17] you don't want to hear that like that
[33:19] because it just sounds like noise to you
[33:20] is it static ecstatic is something going
[33:24] on there you can't feed you can't
[33:26] satisfy you what you're looking for
[33:29] that's why I play the tapes I better be
[33:34] careful how I say to epical yeah they
[33:36] might think I'm moving into another
[33:37] dimension here nothing here here here
[33:39] yes but I also listen to preaching is
[33:43] that right
[33:44] so you what are you saying brother
[33:46] Brooks so you understand that this life
[33:50] that we're in what's the use of having a
[33:52] fountain like I think once we stop with
[33:54] the water outside out here and you go up
[33:57] there and you try to push it and nothing
[33:59] comes out because it was empty
[34:00] you would disappoint it weren't you ah
[34:03] because you had a thirst you had
[34:06] something on the inside that was calling
[34:07] for the water and it wasn't there
[34:10] that was a good that was a good thing
[34:12] that God did he gave us his plenty water
[34:14] and you know what we were doing wasting
[34:15] it
[34:16] and then God took it away from us and
[34:18] then what now you want it see that's you
[34:21] did away yes it wasn't there to play in
[34:27] it wasn't there to amuse the children it
[34:30] was there only for third to be a thirst
[34:33] quencher but see that's how it is with
[34:37] the word if you don't thirst for word
[34:40] the Bible said if you thirst not only
[34:43] would God fill you but he's he even like
[34:46] it for bread if you hunger for it you
[34:49] shall be fed you shall be filled
[34:52] is that right she the word is God and in
[34:57] the beginning was the word and the Word
[34:58] was with God in the world was God and
[35:00] then Jesus said ye abide in me and my
[35:04] word and you ask what you will it'll be
[35:07] done for you
[35:08] now how many I'll believe that I believe
[35:10] it he'll even even even Joe he you know
[35:16] when he we start going through the test
[35:18] the faith the thing that Joe was
[35:20] examining himself is like Lord have I
[35:22] not kept all your precepts havenõt been
[35:26] faithful in everything that I know of it
[35:28] got to the place that almost sound like
[35:29] Joe was glorifying himself on the matter
[35:33] but Joe knew that there was no sin that
[35:35] he knew he had done so he couldn't
[35:38] understand the trials and the tests and
[35:40] everything that he was going through and
[35:41] many times that's how it is when sin or
[35:44] when sickness or anything come my way I
[35:46] said Lord what have I done I don't say
[35:49] Lord what my neighbor did what have I
[35:51] done what did i do am i the breach and
[35:55] I'm the reason for the sickness and if I
[35:58] am revealing to me that I may make it
[36:00] right you understand what I'm saying so
[36:04] you and I must understand you know what
[36:07] is more important to have tongues and
[36:10] interpretation they have prophecy
[36:12] prophesied or to be an example of what
[36:18] God speaks of being divine love you can
[36:24] love you enemy brother branham's
[36:27] real Christian weed gets to a place that
[36:29] you can team up set in now
[36:33] I'm not there yet I'm not like a
[36:36] firecracker I don't easily start burning
[36:38] and exploding but there are times and I
[36:43] asked God I says God you talk about
[36:45] undisturbed faith that's what I want I
[36:48] wanted so wonderful and so in me it
[36:51] meant that nothing can disturb it
[36:54] because worry is not an attribute where
[36:59] it comes from the fall is that okay she
[37:06] staying with Christ in the word she
[37:10] don't go right or left
[37:12] take right with it and then it's
[37:15] actually not your word then is his word
[37:20] understand me the Word of God cannot
[37:23] come back boy I wanna I wanna be with
[37:27] the Thunder that shake the moment on the
[37:30] Thunder that shakes I was sitting on a
[37:31] Thunder wherever I be my life Thunder
[37:35] that is speech y'all know what
[37:37] thundering is right you can't help but
[37:39] to notice it and often time you hear the
[37:42] Thunder before you see the lightning
[37:45] right but I just don't want to be all
[37:47] thunder and no lightning because the
[37:51] Lightning is to display of the power of
[37:53] the Thunder hallelujah
[37:56] and so you look at this thing he's all
[37:58] brother what are you trying to say I'm
[38:00] trying to say wherever I go make let me
[38:04] beat let my life be a difference not
[38:07] what I say what I live hallelujah
[38:14] see when we we're not careful even in
[38:18] this message we find ourselves just like
[38:20] the world with programs and
[38:22] entertainments it got so placed I
[38:26] remember when we came and we had
[38:28] somebody lead in prayer everybody would
[38:30] pray but now we just listened to one
[38:34] man's voice we become accustomed to it
[38:36] and I don't know whether people are
[38:38] praying in their hearts are praying in
[38:39] the mind's eye
[38:40] what they're doing but the prayer is not
[38:42] to entertain you the prayer is here for
[38:46] God it's a direct connection to God but
[38:51] we're listening and I don't that's why I
[38:53] don't like praying in public because I
[38:54] have to fight with this idea of praying
[38:57] when I'm praying to God I can just say
[39:00] the way I want to and not worry about
[39:02] anybody judging my words and I struggle
[39:07] with that because the devil say you know
[39:09] you gonna mess it up on your English I
[39:11] mean he does whatever he can do but my
[39:15] point is is that when the prayer comes
[39:17] out in the morning or the evening and
[39:19] then we all ought to pray he just
[39:21] leading it's like a song leader he's
[39:25] leading the songs but you're singing
[39:27] with him
[39:28] prayer is supposed to be the same way
[39:30] he's praying but you're praying with him
[39:33] come on somebody so y'all get quiet on
[39:36] me but that's the way it's supposed to
[39:37] be now when it comes to perfection all
[39:42] of us are guilty of not being perfected
[39:44] with ourselves
[39:45] brother balanced and obedient to the
[39:47] great commandment given here by spirit
[39:51] Paul st. Paul excuse me let us just
[39:53] remember this that we are guilty that
[39:56] some way and somehow the best of us are
[39:59] guilty before God because it is written
[40:03] of the Lord Jesus Christ be perfect even
[40:06] as your father in heaven is perfect
[40:09] so we can only be perfect through our
[40:12] faith in his shed blood hello
[40:15] he didn't say works our faith in his
[40:18] shed blood but there's not one thing we
[40:21] could do to help ourselves we have to
[40:24] trust in his mercy let your light so
[40:30] shine mmm because what we do we get we
[40:34] get a little if we're not careful such a
[40:36] thin line between law and grace and why
[40:40] are you doing what you're doing like I
[40:43] said this morning Amen people said well
[40:45] that's the way my church believed it
[40:47] wrong wrong answer when it comes to God
[40:50] you're a shame of God now your shame to
[40:53] a at
[40:54] you believe that and that's the way I
[40:57] believe it and that's the way I am
[40:59] convicted to believe it it ain't the
[41:01] church it's the word hello so we can
[41:07] only be perfect through our faith in his
[41:09] shed blood but there's not one thing we
[41:12] could do to help ourselves we have to
[41:15] trust in His mercy so I will pray for
[41:18] you that God will forgive you for all
[41:21] your unworthiness and you will you pray
[41:23] for me that God will forgive me for my
[41:26] all my unworthiness
[41:28] hallelujah now brother Branham is
[41:31] talking about this because and this
[41:32] message she's working with so let your
[41:35] light shine amen is a communion service
[41:37] they're bout to have communion and now
[41:40] we're facing the table we're facing
[41:42] communion and we must acknowledge that
[41:44] all of us have been guilty one way as a
[41:47] brother says or another you pray for me
[41:52] and I pray for you hallelujah
[41:56] is that Alright because even when God
[42:00] gives you the Holy Ghost until we have
[42:03] change but let him said it like that in
[42:05] this book this flesh ain't gonna be no
[42:07] different
[42:08] until God gives you your other body you
[42:13] have to fight with this until Jesus come
[42:15] oh but you see what it is when you
[42:18] become a perfect man guess what happened
[42:21] you no longer a child a child child
[42:23] faith a child got a little strength a
[42:26] grown man got far more strength right so
[42:29] we grow in strength we grow in faith we
[42:33] grow till after while we put the devil
[42:36] to shame it doesn't mean that the devil
[42:38] gonna stop coming and messing with your
[42:40] mind but he when he comes a man we're so
[42:44] fortified it's like trying to get beyond
[42:48] a fire hallelujah
[42:52] we're so far defied til he cannot get to
[42:55] us because we've grown in Christ she you
[43:00] the devil cannot work with darkness
[43:02] unless you have darkness in you hello
[43:07] you said that ain't true James says it
[43:09] you're drawn away with your own lust and
[43:13] enticed so it ain't God that you drop
[43:17] it's the devil somewhere has a seat in
[43:20] you and same thing pulls on that but
[43:24] once that devil is gone there's no place
[43:26] he can look there's no place he can pull
[43:33] you're the problem not God it ain't the
[43:36] Lord you've got to overcome all the
[43:39] inhabitants of the land is that right
[43:43] brother well listen he told Joshua when
[43:46] you go into that land I want you to slay
[43:48] I want you to kill everything they told
[43:52] told the man of God if you do not kill
[43:55] them they will become a thorn in your
[43:57] flesh and that's why Israel still are
[44:01] dealing with the Philistines the same
[44:05] people God told them to kill they didn't
[44:10] do it and now has become a thorn in
[44:13] their flesh and as that was in the
[44:17] natural so it is with the spiritual
[44:19] y'all hear me you and I must understand
[44:23] by God's grace it is his loving kindness
[44:27] that makes us love him more when he does
[44:32] kindness to us when we don't even
[44:35] deserve it David said his mercy endures
[44:38] forever
[44:39] his mercy amen is renewed every morning
[44:43] I love that you know it can't be
[44:45] exhaustible it's inexhaustible it is
[44:49] there enough amen to that like like like
[44:51] like the Prophet God said it's like a
[44:53] little rat a little mouse in the in the
[44:55] in the in the oh there in Egypt in the
[44:58] in the storage place where they store
[44:59] everything says you know I better be
[45:00] careful because I don't want to eat it
[45:02] all up a little mouse in the granary
[45:07] with all that grain he could never eat
[45:10] it all up he said that's how it is with
[45:13] God why do we want to spare God he made
[45:16] God wants to give you the greater things
[45:18] he wants to see you perfect he
[45:21] to see these attributes manifested he
[45:24] loves a rainbow he loves it seeing it
[45:26] reflected through you and around you and
[45:29] above your world it is his covenant he
[45:31] first made and guess what that rainbow
[45:34] was not possible until they had gone
[45:37] through the flood you came in a year ago
[45:40] just drop in your lap you must suffer
[45:45] the Bible said those who have suffered
[45:47] in the flesh has ceased from sin you
[45:50] gotta suffer because your flesh couldn't
[45:53] want to do want you to do the contrary
[45:54] things but when you can put that in
[45:57] there harnessing the Holy Ghost and when
[45:59] that devil hey one of them right I think
[46:03] I told you about this story this is a
[46:07] reality when I first time riding a horse
[46:09] I went to ride this horse and this was a
[46:13] smart horse for somehow that horts knew
[46:15] it was my first time on a horse was back
[46:18] and so the horse wanted to take charge
[46:21] he did and when we would go down this
[46:25] the the inclines he would gallop in a
[46:28] certain way that would make it would be
[46:33] right even so I caught on to him I
[46:39] started talking to him like it was a man
[46:40] I said if you do that again i'ma pull
[46:43] this ring and imma imma break your neck
[46:47] at least it make you feel like it huh
[46:49] you know that that old horse tried it
[46:51] again I pull out that rock I like I want
[46:55] you to know I'm the man that horse
[47:00] straight know I'll never forget it
[47:04] I let him know I'm the boss and that's
[47:07] how sometimes you gotta meet the devil
[47:09] no you the boss no he ain't the boss of
[47:13] your life you're the boss now because
[47:16] you did that I'm gonna shout you eat
[47:20] what did you do to beat what did you try
[47:22] I'm gonna show you how much you'll think
[47:24] of me I'm gonna praise God for it see
[47:26] you gotta get that weapon tree of praise
[47:28] and song and let him know I'm still a
[47:31] victory I'm still the Conqueror
[47:34] why he made me so I don't have to work
[47:37] hard
[47:38] thanks be to God who gives us the
[47:40] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ
[47:44] brother Adam said it like this in a
[47:46] message the unwelcome Christ he said
[47:50] Jesus reputation is made we're sinners
[47:53] is Jesus reputation is made with sinners
[47:58] it takes sinners that realize they're
[48:02] sinners that realized their loss realize
[48:06] they're always there away from God that
[48:10] would get beside themselves and then
[48:12] worship Him that's where he's his
[48:16] reputation is made
[48:18] you can't give God a reputation without
[48:20] praises without testimonies without
[48:24] telling somebody about his goodness
[48:26] that's where it's made that's why you go
[48:29] through trials so in tests so you can
[48:32] tell people just how good god has been
[48:35] to me that's what it's for
[48:37] you know it's not for you to just keep
[48:39] yourselves and all knowing all the
[48:41] goodness of God and you don't tell
[48:43] nobody the testimony of Jesus is sure
[48:46] and you and I are supposed to tell those
[48:48] testimonies you know a lot of times we
[48:51] don't tell them because the devil says
[48:52] you don't you know all you've been as a
[48:53] hypocrite how you going to tell somebody
[48:55] Amen what God has done from you I don't
[48:57] care how much you think I've been a
[48:59] hypocrite listen people if you to bridle
[49:02] cars you could never be a hypocrite let
[49:07] me say that again if you the Bride of
[49:09] Christ you can never be a hypocrite if
[49:11] you are under the blood you can never be
[49:15] a hypocrite put it that way
[49:16] so that you're alone that when you're
[49:18] under the blood God don't see your sins
[49:20] all he see is the blood but the devil
[49:25] would make us think and calculating this
[49:27] net only to hush us up you can't tell
[49:30] nobody about this message because you
[49:32] ain't been faithful I can't tell it if
[49:36] I'm thankful I'm not faithful it's true
[49:38] anyhow see he try to hush you up and
[49:41] then by using your false and what we
[49:43] call our failures but listen you keep
[49:46] praising God
[49:51] is that right brother BAM said there was
[49:54] known there was no difference between
[49:55] Israel and Moab they served the same God
[50:00] had the same altar
[50:02] the only difference he said that Israel
[50:05] had a covenant they had a Schmitt rock
[50:08] they had a pillar of fire hallelujah
[50:12] they had promises that lawyer didn't
[50:14] have that's what makes us different
[50:16] it is the promises of God it is the
[50:20] promise of a rapture is that right oh
[50:24] when Joseph Amen came and he saw look
[50:27] Benjamin the Bible said he gave all his
[50:29] brothers food and substance but if we
[50:31] came to Benjamin he gave him a great
[50:33] portion hallelujah I'm liking this bride
[50:36] this last little Gentile a piece of
[50:38] what's left I like in her core we
[50:41] weren't around when the great revivals
[50:43] was going I wasn't oh if I was I was
[50:48] just a little top you understand me but
[50:51] now I've grown up and I'm promised a
[50:54] double portion and so are you right I am
[50:58] a special born child just like Benjamin
[51:02] was hello I'm special born so are you
[51:06] and therefore it's all right to say the
[51:08] Lord where are my blessings it's all
[51:12] right amen you say God I won't see I
[51:14] don't care about limousines and great
[51:16] cars and great houses and greatness it
[51:19] I don't lived it enough to know that you
[51:21] can be looking in a great house and
[51:22] still as long as you can be you can you
[51:25] can be driving one of the finest cars
[51:27] there is and still be crying because you
[51:30] feel rejected them alone ha poet of God
[51:33] but what I love if I'm a poor man give
[51:36] me Jesus hallelujah because of our God
[51:40] Jesus that's enough
[51:42] y'all understand we people used to sing
[51:45] that but since they've got enriched
[51:47] Jesus ain't quite enough but let me tell
[51:50] you something he will always be more
[51:52] than enough for me hallelujah because
[51:55] I'm going to tell you something even
[51:57] your best friend can never be there when
[51:59] you read the lead of the most
[52:03] is that right it's okay I can't be with
[52:08] you when you're in your house
[52:09] feeling lonely in blue or going through
[52:12] whatever y'all understand me but one
[52:15] thing about Jesus he's always there
[52:17] that's what I mean and you know what I
[52:20] can't always say the right things that's
[52:23] gonna comfort you but Jesus can say one
[52:25] or two words anything I don't know about
[52:27] you all you gotta say you know I will
[52:30] always love you I become brother in his
[52:33] head it's the truth one word in your
[52:40] countenance from God settles it all
[52:42] stops the devil foolishness is that make
[52:46] sense I was like I told you before I was
[52:49] going through something and and I was in
[52:51] my kitchen and I heard his voice hadn't
[52:53] heard it for a while in the way that he
[52:55] talked he said I I'll never leave you
[52:58] nor forsake you who now you could say
[53:03] what you wanted that scripture brother I
[53:05] know it but that scripture came alive to
[53:09] me in my kitchen the devil say you know
[53:14] you that's just see the devil says you
[53:16] know that's just you but when you hear
[53:20] it at a time you wasn't thinking it you
[53:24] know it came from somewhere when you
[53:29] hearing and you wasn't even thinking
[53:32] that it comes in a place where you
[53:34] weren't even thinking about him and he
[53:36] comes in it he interrupts everything
[53:38] changes the atmosphere that's God oh my
[53:46] goodness I'm trying to explain an
[53:48] experience and I don't know whether
[53:49] you're getting it or not but my point is
[53:52] when it comes to people in this message
[53:54] they they say they know him but they
[53:56] hadn't heard him talking a long time he
[53:58] speaks he talks hallelujah amen he will
[54:03] enter into your heart and your mind and
[54:05] say things that your heart and your mind
[54:07] could not even cut think about thinking
[54:09] I'm saying I know what I'm talking about
[54:12] hallelujah as I said and how we're going
[54:15] to be much
[54:15] but I said this the greatest gift that
[54:17] God could give you his life and why
[54:19] aren't we enjoying it your life's
[54:21] supposed to be enjoyed hallelujah
[54:24] listen if you just got a slice of bread
[54:27] you ought to thank God for the slice Wow
[54:30] because some people don't even have a
[54:31] slice how are you Oh Lord I ain't got
[54:36] number one pair shoe some people don't
[54:37] have shoes come on y'all that's the
[54:42] truth I used to get an attitude what I
[54:44] want to go buy a burger and then have
[54:45] money to buy one what a spoiled child
[54:49] right when god I got food and
[54:52] refrigerated everything else and I rally
[54:55] my pot keep looking through my thing I'm
[54:57] a Burger King or some kind of that's
[54:59] what I used to eat that stuff you should
[55:00] come to my mind and I didn't have no
[55:02] money to drive through the drive-through
[55:06] but I get an attitude like God you know
[55:09] humma never have a seat I know it's our
[55:15] foolish people I'm telling you the way
[55:18] the devil used to fight me now I got
[55:23] more than enough I've been asking the
[55:27] Lord showed me who where to give these
[55:29] suits and things away I just got too
[55:31] much stuff and you know what it's gonna
[55:35] always be that way you know because the
[55:37] more you give the more you get it's true
[55:41] I can give something away and here comes
[55:43] something else right and there are times
[55:46] I have bought gifts from people and here
[55:49] comes somebody else giving me the gift
[55:51] that I gave to somebody maybe even a
[55:52] better one so you look at these things
[55:55] and you say what brother was what it is
[55:57] it's just the law of God good measures
[56:01] press down running over and if your life
[56:04] is not going going that way
[56:06] you need to examine it and see why it's
[56:08] not going that way I do you love the
[56:15] Lord
[56:17] oh I've given you situations and showing
[56:21] you a man that see it you can't work
[56:25] with this with the intelligent
[56:26] intellectual faith and you know before I
[56:29] never knew that there was intellectual
[56:30] faith until I came to this message if
[56:32] this message is trying to you know you
[56:34] believe Lord I can believe
[56:35] I know it's true well you know what it
[56:37] was we see the difference between Israel
[56:40] and David because here was Israel with
[56:43] an intellectual faith they knew what God
[56:44] they knew Jehovah but they had never
[56:46] seen him live and here was David outside
[56:50] there in the field with the Sheep and he
[56:52] saw God killed a bear he saw God killed
[56:54] a lion so he had more than an
[56:57] intellectual faith he had a faith by way
[57:00] of experience he had a revelation that
[57:02] the God they were serving he served was
[57:05] greater than this Goliath and killed you
[57:09] have a true experience with God you're
[57:11] gonna always think that the devil is
[57:13] greater you may not ever say it but your
[57:16] actions will prove that you really
[57:18] believe that the devil has more power
[57:20] over you than God and until you really
[57:24] have an experience and really believe
[57:26] God Satan will always reign but when you
[57:30] haven't experienced with God it
[57:32] overthrows Satan it kicks him off the
[57:35] throne of your heart and the Jesus come
[57:37] to reign there is that right that's what
[57:40] I love about that story when when when
[57:42] when David wanted Jerusalem and and you
[57:46] know the I can't even think of the name
[57:49] of it right now those are those who had
[57:52] Jerusalem jebby sites and the Japanese
[57:55] dykes were were really descenders kind
[57:58] of like of the Giants they kind of had a
[58:00] connection there and whether you believe
[58:03] it or not it was those Giants those
[58:05] debuts that literally made those people
[58:07] who was lame and blind and David said I
[58:11] want you to kill all of that that
[58:12] despises me this is my city and none of
[58:15] that has come gonna enter into my city I
[58:17] want all of that swept away you know
[58:20] what I'm saying every true King gets rid
[58:22] of everything he doesn't like right and
[58:27] David says listen I want to get rid of
[58:29] all of that
[58:31] find me a man and Here Come Joab huh huh
[58:35] amen Joab me L it exam exhausts Jehovah
[58:40] but let me tell you something iover son
[58:42] of Jehovah let me say it like this it
[58:44] meant by God's grace here was a man who
[58:47] didn't even know he would be the one
[58:49] that would but would help this establish
[58:52] Jerusalem y'all understand me and and
[58:56] what happened is he goes in there and he
[58:59] literally kills all that was needed to
[59:02] be killed so that ednan and he and he
[59:04] gets a reward from David understand
[59:10] there's a Joab now that's in favor of
[59:15] God's plan for the New Jerusalem that's
[59:19] why no lame you know what the lame is a
[59:22] man who can't stand straight on the word
[59:26] you understand me
[59:28] a blind man everybody know that he can't
[59:31] even see it cuz he ain't born again
[59:34] hallelujah you cannot even see the
[59:38] kingdom until you're born again and you
[59:42] and I must understand that that must
[59:45] those kind of people must be done away
[59:48] with and that's what's happening around
[59:50] the message if you remain blind if you
[59:53] remain lame it's a spirit that's gonna
[59:56] get rid of you because you're not going
[1:00:00] to enter into the New Jerusalem like
[1:00:03] that and that's why Jesus said he said
[1:00:06] you know if your eye offend you
[1:00:09] pluck it out hmm anything that's going
[1:00:13] to all to you and cause you not to
[1:00:15] really believe the Word of God the way
[1:00:17] it is get rid of it you got to stand for
[1:00:23] testing times right now all right you
[1:00:26] want to see the devil afraid of you live
[1:00:28] it live God's Word you live it in the
[1:00:32] devil of sick in the shoes hallelujah
[1:00:35] right
[1:00:36] let him oversleep don't let him get up
[1:00:40] because when he did love is gonna be
[1:00:42] troubling my kingdom let him sleep
[1:00:47] that's just the way it is and you and I
[1:00:51] must understand that if you if you go
[1:00:53] search that out in the scripture where
[1:00:55] that Japanese light would you rusyn
[1:00:56] woman they had a valley that was
[1:00:58] literally symbolic of hell
[1:01:02] and understand even even even where
[1:01:06] David and Goliath worth fighting it that
[1:01:09] was a it was in the valley and so I want
[1:01:13] you to understand by God's grace that
[1:01:15] that even David knew that Goliath had
[1:01:18] descendants you and I we don't
[1:01:21] understand but listen every time brother
[1:01:24] Berlin talks about giants in this day he
[1:01:27] calls them intellectual and when when
[1:01:32] when he was about ready to depart from
[1:01:34] from Jeffersonville he said
[1:01:39] Jeffersonville the Philistines is among
[1:01:45] the intellectuals those whose going to
[1:01:49] alter this thing and turn it and change
[1:01:51] it if you don't fight because you know
[1:01:54] what happened y'all and if you follow
[1:01:55] they followed it well they the things
[1:01:59] that God wants the things that God would
[1:02:01] do among them that once excited that
[1:02:03] them became common you hit on the tape
[1:02:06] brother boundary buchen them because
[1:02:09] they these things have become common he
[1:02:11] saw them growing cold
[1:02:13] he saw the far leaving he saw the
[1:02:17] changes that were going to take place
[1:02:19] down there you know what he said he said
[1:02:22] whatever you do don't pattern yourself
[1:02:24] whatever but whatever bred them
[1:02:26] Tabernacle does don't you pattern in
[1:02:28] yourself behind it I just pretty much
[1:02:30] raised it that way myself but that's
[1:02:32] what he meant
[1:02:33] he saw the changes taking place and you
[1:02:36] think he didn't see what was going on
[1:02:38] now you follow that if you want to that
[1:02:44] proves you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:02:46] brother Brooks you're gonna say
[1:02:47] yes I'm little saying there's only one
[1:02:51] message for this hour Malachi 4 in
[1:02:58] Revelation 10 7 has already happened
[1:03:01] there is nothing else to follow other
[1:03:03] than the bride in her revival and right
[1:03:08] now she is being revived and what caused
[1:03:10] brother Branham described to us what
[1:03:12] revival is are not shouting and dancing
[1:03:14] is getting over to dine out of your life
[1:03:16] and if you are getting trashed out of
[1:03:18] your life you are in a revival people
[1:03:24] are so afraid and when did Jefferson's
[1:03:28] view become our Mecca this is God
[1:03:32] absolutely this is brother Brandon's
[1:03:35] quote book and he didn't preach nothing
[1:03:40] but Jesus is that right that's what he's
[1:03:43] at
[1:03:43] Paul said I increasing nothing but Jesus
[1:03:46] Christ and him crucified
[1:03:48] now I didn't die for you don't be
[1:03:52] baptizing in my name I did nothing for
[1:03:54] you and the Prophet Guard had to come
[1:03:57] back and say the same thing why because
[1:04:00] the same anointing that was old Paul was
[1:04:02] on him because both of them were
[1:04:04] prophets one was the Alpha and the other
[1:04:06] was the Omega you and I must understand
[1:04:11] that the word of life has been given to
[1:04:13] us and it's more dangerous for us than
[1:04:15] it is for the denomination cuz they
[1:04:17] don't know no better but for us the
[1:04:19] Bible said to whom much is given much is
[1:04:21] required and let me tell you something
[1:04:23] I'm gonna say this and I'm gonna say it
[1:04:24] again there was no way that we can live
[1:04:27] this without the Holy Ghost and does it
[1:04:30] does he make it easy for you
[1:04:32] no why you say that because he told
[1:04:35] brother Brennan he said this thing this
[1:04:37] great portion of heaven is given to you
[1:04:39] because you have chosen the harder way
[1:04:43] he gives you a choice you can go the
[1:04:46] hard way or you can go the easier way
[1:04:50] you understand me
[1:04:51] he didn't call us rainbow trials for
[1:04:53] nothing we got to go up the stream he
[1:04:59] loved the law heard I
[1:05:01] ah he's still working on me but I you
[1:05:07] know I don't get discouraged like it's
[1:05:08] not gonna be completed because he said
[1:05:11] he had completed the work he started in
[1:05:14] me I might go through some trials and
[1:05:16] tests and you know right now I was
[1:05:18] telling somebody I said right now I did
[1:05:20] the truth of the matter is I'm going
[1:05:21] through a great flood but then you know
[1:05:24] the Lord quicken to me while I was
[1:05:25] preaching it was a rainbow that came
[1:05:27] after the flood what a powerful covenant
[1:05:31] amen
[1:05:32] what an assurance that God gives us it
[1:05:35] was a rainbow that came oh yeah I don't
[1:05:41] see what I'm seeing maybe I don't know
[1:05:42] but he just oh my god yeah God is
[1:05:49] realistic we still got communion I get
[1:05:52] carried away yeah we're gonna ask our
[1:05:59] brother to come up now and we're gonna
[1:06:00] pray for him brother
[1:06:01] come Gabrielle hi I love this brother he
