TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen we thank God for being here tonight and uh we appreciate the beautiful weather that God has given us I am grateful to be alive in Christ uh we we stand and have a word of prayer Our dear heavenly father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord we thank you for being so good to us Lord we thank you Father unworthy creatures we are of ourselves but thank God for your dear son in the blood of Jesus Christ that has been shed for us and has become a perpetu ation for our sins Lord we pray right now that you bless this little bible study anoint the word give us wisdom but most of all give us a revelation more revelation of yourself and fellowship with you we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen we'll be coming from um we'll be dealing with with um the excuse me the scripture of of of uh first John and um we will be incorporating some other things as we go down the line but we'll start reading um first John the first chapter beginning at the fifth verse and U most of us uh pretty much know this particular scriptures or these scriptures by heart um John is a a a beautiful character and um we appreciate everything that the Lord inspired him to write you you and I must understand that by the grace of God John was a one of those disciples that was very close to Jesus and uh he was his brother as well so he saw things that I think some took a time to see but I I believe John saw uh he was kind of ahead of everybody in that uh he had had great great experiences with with the almighty god um he was one that I believe was uh time traveled so anyway we know that's real but let us read this um beginning at the fifth verse of First John uh first chapter this is the message we have have heard from him and declared to you God is light and there is absolutely no darkness in him if we say we have fellowship with him and yet we walk in darkness we are lying and we are not practicing the truth now I'm going to this is kind of another revise but anyway you'll get it if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus his son cleanses us from all sin if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and righteous to forgive us of our sins and that cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in US amen so I'll read it from the King James version this then is the message we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sins if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us let's just stop there father we just thank you for the reading of your word we pray father God that you will break the bread of life to us in this hour and we ask it in Jesus name with Thanksgiving amen you may be seated appreciate our brother Matthew uh being with us by the grace of God I I love the scripture I love it all but when I'm when we think about God and we went over that a little bit last time we we studied the first part of of uh the scripture we understand that God is light now when we speak of light we're speaking of Revelation amen okay because when you're in darkness you can't see anything and of course you know just last uh on Wednesday we we worked with you know uh gross Darkness covering the people and and all of these things I believe that when John was writing uh these uh letters or messages by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost God was really uh I take it personally every scripture to me is alive it's not something old and then I got to apply it to me no no no it's fresh it's alive it's for today tomorrow and if there be another day after tomorrow that scripture still lives uh everybody don't can't see God I mean they don't understand God matter of fact you know the Bible said the light came and the and the Darkness comprehended it not meaning that they couldn't understand it they couldn't see it um they couldn't grab a hold of it and but there are those who have been ordained to see the light now as we as we go with this we understand that the only way that you can Tru fellowship with God is that you got to move like the sun you move with the light because the light doesn't change as it move like in the morning and it moves and there's another day that's morning it moves and as it moves or you say the Earth rotate however you look at it light is always there to reveal for you to see something that you could not see when you were in darkness and that's how it is with God if like I said you know in in the day of of of of of Wesley uh they saw their light you know in the day of Luther they saw that was their light but it didn't stay there that revelation of God began to move forward and everybody if you were in Luther age you had to transition into wesle age and the Wesleyan had to transition into Pentecostal age and the Pentecostal age has to transition into the bride age amen because the Bible said if you walk in the light as he is in the light right that's where the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you that's when you begin to Fellowship one with another because see you can understand the system that we're now seeing because they're not walked in the light they became a denomination they became an organization and this is what brother R was trying to tell us as we walk in the light we must consider and understand we're Brethren amen right he started off as as a Baptist he came to know Jesus as a Baptist he moved from the Baptist to the Pentecostal from the Pentecostal into the very word and you know he knew God back then and he knew God better it gets better because the lights get better brighter right so you look at these things and it's a it's a thing that message people we've done we've is isolated ourselves and and I I don't agree with that kind of a thing because I believe the shuck is supposed to pull away from the wheat that's right not the wheat pull away from the Shar amen and how else they going to know or see this light if we don't Fellowship one with another that's what it is brother brandom never de dechristianize anybody Paul never dechristianize anybody they when they saw John's disciples they said have you believed have you received the Holy Ghost since since you believe as Christians when we find somebody Walking In a Different Light we're supposed to take that Christian by the grace of God and bring them into a greater light that's when we began to have fellowship if we say we have fellowship with him and yet we walk in darkness we are lying and do not practice the truth and it goes on to say if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we li and do not the truth now how how is that going to be determined you know a person say you know we sing that song I'm in the light no more darkness no more night well you got to understand when you're walking in the light the light of God never goes out amen we're not talking about candl light we're talking about the light of the shikina glory amen and remember as we go on the light that we walk in tonight is different from the light that the Pentecostal walked in because we're living in an age where it's not anym it's no longer touch not taste not handle not it's not the law amen we're living in an age where God has declared that we never sin in the first place am that's right now in this age we want you to understand because we are in our flesh I heard brother brandom just say we purge ourselves every day right that's why we don't go through a Great Tribulation because we're constantly cleansing ourselves By the Light of the word we say washing ourselves by the water of the word amen right one of the things that I think that we when we walk in the light when two people Fellowship when we Fellowship you know we understand what that is brother B said two fellows in a ship but but what it is is when we Fellowship fellow there's nothing like Fellowship matter of fact we supposed to come together the more in the last day to fellowship and to worship and that means we we talk about the word of God we talk about our testimonies we we give praise to God because I don't know about you that strengthens me and I believe that the body is here to strengthen one another but the only way that we will'll be able to do that is Walking In The Light let me so you'll understand there's no big eyes and little 's in the light we're all the we how can I say it we're we're the same peas in the pod amen right we we can't judge each other uh in the way that we did in denomination right because in this uh life you ought to be dead amen is that right Paul say it's not I that live but Christ that lives in me so we're not here to to uh uh reflect ourselves or to reflect our achievements see whenever you see people doing that they're not in the light according to the Easter seal you know brother random said the true exper Holy Ghost experience doesn't glorify itself doesn't glorify Moses doesn't glorify Elijah it only glorifies Jesus Christ that's when you know that you are truly in the light when you're glorifying Jesus Christ now here we go the the any questions comments okay if we say we have no sin now but you said but Brother Bruce you said we don't have any sin what is sin sin is unbelief if we say we don't have no sins we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us I ask you a question tonight can a sinner sin the answer is no The Sinner is a sinner only Christians can sin The Sinner is an unbeliever he's not a believer but a Christian who is a Believer has moments of unbelief so they're the only ones that can sin let me ask you another question is lying stealing cheating are those things sin no they attributes of sin which is unbelief right so we got the word of God we got the blood of Jesus in our day this message come to what dress the bride amen but in order to be dressed you must be justified you must be Sanctified you must be filled and sealed amen with the attributes of God right you understand what I'm saying because when we were in this Pentecostal age we thought we had it all with the speaking in Tong jumping and shouting and all of that and I'm not saying anything wrong with that but there was more light amen that came came our way that bring brings us I was talking to a Pentecostal friend of mine yesterday I said go home and read uh second Peter I believe it was the first chapter uh where it talks about the attributes of God and uh and so I told him to do that I said because in that chapter it talks about the divine nature of God after your uh Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patient godliness brotherly kindness you know and there in the Divine love now that is the full statue of Christ that is his divine nature and only those who have the divine nature will be taken in the Rapture right so we see those things and we understand those things what a what what what was Jesus what let me show you something um let me see go with me to uh Mark 14 3 and N Jesus Christ is the word that's correct but we understand that the word is unveiling it it reveals itself unfolds itself and and the and the and in that day of the law they knew that uh prostitutions a pro those who were prostitutes were were unclean they weren't even you weren't allowed to even be around them dare not you touch one amen and and and and and and because they were unclean and and if you would uh find yourself in a unclean position you had to go to the priest and he had to do the ceremonial things to say you're clean but but anyhow Jesus was the word and remember he said except you believe that I am he you should likewise die in your sin now what was the difference between the law and Jesus us the law came to as a school Master as the Paul says it came to teach us what sin or what how Wicked we are let's put it in our own terms it was a school Master right because how can you repent from something that you don't even know it's wrong amen I think I was talking with Josh or someone I was talking with just the other day how these little kids can curse and say all kind of stuff but they don't even know it's wrong because they have no word they have no Bible the nature of a man is wrong right but that Bible the word was is God so it came to show mankind his nature is wrong and then it said came to show mankind you can't make it until you change your nature amen so the law was came came to condemn us teach us and to condemn us to make us see that there's no way that you can make it amen right without Grace so Jesus came and he comes with Grace and Truth as he has done in this hour because remember in the seven Church ages it was all law and as the message we brought that law with us amen But as God began to really unfold and unveil to us the grace and truth now we're seeing we were already free amen that's right God made us free and and in this message you have to accept your freedom in order to be free amen right so let's turn to Mark 14 3-9 because we're talking about walking in the light as he is in the light that's my subject walk in the light as he in is in the light right and the blood of Jesus do what it cleanse you from all unrighteousness and with all of that you have Fellowship one with another why because you understand that the blood of Jesus Jesus Christ get cleanses me cleanses you too there is no way we can be cleansed of ourselves we can't sanctify ourselves Jesus said I sanctify myself that you might be Sanctified so everything from justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost to the infilling of the complete character of Christ is done to mankind by the grace of God Amen none of us has a place to boast amen all right God took it out of our hand hands that's right there is no place to boast or to raise ourselves up in a prideful way as if we're something because whenever you in Pride you are in darkness yes starting at the third verse and being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leopard as he sat at me there came a woman having alabaster box of ointment and of Spiga very precious and she break the box and Ed on his head now now I want you to understand this there are in they are in the House of a leopard first of all they're wrong amen the leopard is unclean and the house of the leopard is unclean when you were a leopard you had a certain place they put you you were excommunicated you were not supposed to not the Jews now the Gentiles may have fellowship with leopards but the Jews knew that leprosy was unclean amen but here they are in the House of Simon the leopard and leopardy represents what sin and we find out there in the house of leprosy judging the woman with the alabaster box ain't that something that's how we do we judge one another one is a leopard and one is a and both of them are caused by by sin and unbelief yeah right and there come a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of Spiker very precious and she break the box and poured it on his head now I want you to understand this oil was very expensive oil okay it wasn't something cheap it was it was also it was used amen for the burial you know and other things I'm sure but right now she's anointed by God think about this because this is not her mindset that's right and as we know that God works on both ends so here she is Anointed by God a prostitute not even converted yet thank you Lord but she had a seed in her that's right you understand me what makes us believe this message even when we were Sinners it was that seed that God put in us and God anointed us Drew us to this message when all of the religious system like Simon and their uppy attitude looking at Jesus with dirty feet amen and that's how they do it they they they invite him to church and I don't want to get into that cuz that's another little thing but we we never want to invite Jesus to church and pay him no attention that's right we come to worship Him amen right and understand by the grace of God the only way you can truly worship him you have to worship Him in spirit and in truth and when you in spirit and truth you're free yes sir and people should never come to church in bondage because you're free and when you allow your mind remember it's your mind this is where the battle is yes sir your mind your mind is your prison house your mind will enchain you amen right but your heart sets you free the revelation of God in your heart sets you free this is one of the better scriptures that I find you know in the whole Bible when when John is looking and and there's no one worthy to open the book that means no one amen no matter how great Moses was how great Elijah was how great all of the the m messengers of the Old and New Testament there was no one worthy amen so how can you ever be worthy that's right your Redemption can could only come by the bloody lamb Jesus Christ himself see you still go back to the blood right amen because I want you to understand from Adam all the way up what did what did Cain and uh what did Adam do to deserve blood he was in the wrong he was a sinner there was nothing he could do to save himself but Salvation is of the Lord and God killed an innocent lamb sheded his blood to redeem Adam and Eve y'all understand me if it was free then it's free now if it was Grace then is Grace now right so how can we not love one another no matter what we do when people do wrong we still got to love them you got to love your enemy you got to love your brother you got to love your sister you understand what I'm saying because the moment you feel like you are in a place where you don't have to forgive or have to love you are in darkness that's the way it works now you can hate the sin you may not even like the person's ways but you got to love them and I don't mean filio love I mean agape love willing to lay your life down yes sir right so fellowship with God by Revelation oh I didn't finish that I'm sorry that scripture where I was so what happens something's changing first of all here is the woman with the alabaster box I'm I'm showing you now because this is the kind of stuff God does he will do this to you that's right he he's no he's it's not different there's no different here in the law God jumps in Grace amen they couldn't even recognize Grace until Paul came amen Paul had to teach the the the the the the the the old Jewish people what Grace was all about what did they have a struggle absolutely amen because we find them in Galatians still trying Amen to circumcise people right Christians that supposed to accept Christ but then he here come Paul said you you Bewitched amen that's right something body has cast a spell on you because the law never worked only the grace of God and and this grace of God comes through the shed blood of Jesus Christ of course God from the beginning you know decided this is what he would do but no matter how religious religious you become without the blood of Jesus Christ applied to your life you gone you've come nowhere because religion will never save you as I said and everybody has religion so here's this woman everybody knows she's a prostitute and she's coming into Simon's house and nobody stops her and we find out that Simon knows her now how did he comes to know her y'all understand what I'm saying he wasn't the only one that knew her but but the point is he's trying to scorn her did anybody try to stop her no before you know she's at jesus' feet amen who invited her to come Jesus did amen that's the truth let me it's amazing because Jesus said I do nothing except the father show me amen so he knew she was coming amen he knew like I said he got there before she got there and he knew she was coming so he had to be there when she would come that's how it works God knows every move you make yes sir he sees you he hears you before you speak a word he answer you before you even call that's God Amen this is not something what God said well what's going to happen next he [Music] knows and and I'm saying this to you so that you understand when you truly have a revel Hallelujah when you truly have a revelation of God in you you are an invincible person and understand this you can fellowship with him every day all day and how you do that to have the Revelation that God said I'll never leave you nor forsake you and Jesus is always there with you whether you know it or not this Dimension that we're living in is awful amen that's right but he's here right we know that because of the the word of God being open 1963 y'all know how it works but my point is once you it's a revelation you can say it in your mind with your mou all you want to but until you understand that Jesus Christ is here and he's with you every day then it will change your way of thinking change your way of walking and you'll be very cautious on how you look because you know he's sitting there with you not just with you but in you right so here it is they didn't recognize Jesus they didn't know who he was but here as according to with the prophet of God this woman knew that there was another prostitute and you know how Word of Mouth goes she had been saved by Jesus from death amen that's right they caught her in adultery and he freed her why what did he say woman where be your accusers do y'all understand this bride of Christ where be your accusers she says I have none then Jesus says well you're free because I have nothing to accuse you of either what was he telling her here was a seed of God called in the act and God gives her Amazing Grace and according to the law she should have been stoned and the man that's right that's the truth but we know organizations they always break the word because they didn't bring the man they brought her only they brought her you understand what I'm saying so what I'm trying to say is to you that applies to the Bride of Jesus Christ today hey where are your accusers I think it's Isaiah 57 uh uh I believe um no uh no weapon formed against you should prosper and you know you're going to judge them you know that judge you and all you know how the scripture go so but but this is walking in the light right every age had their light so what is your Revelation I'm free yes sir I'm living in the Shina of Glory I'm being changed every day not by power not by might but by his Spirit he that begun the good work in me is faithful to complet it yeah do you understand that and it doesn't just apply to you it applies to your brothers and sisters it doesn't matter where they are in the program all wheat does not grow to maturity at the same pace everybody has their their portion in this and God showed that through his disciples can you imagine being with 12 gangsters and one being a devil that's what they look like how many of y'all would have followed Jesus come on somebody yeah put yourself there this man don't have nothing naturally foxes have whole bir bir have nesses but the son of man have no place to lay his head amen he doesn't even have a real full change of clothing amen that's right didn't he have nothing right to be fully buried in nothing he had nothing and y'all look like Vagabond roing roaming from one place to another that's right Jesus the Lord did that on purpose he could have come looking like a prince but he chose the low life you know why because he want that's where a lot of save people that's where a lot of seed is at the end of the day he says the highways the byways now you know the the the rejects of this generation that's where I am but guess what we're Prejudice that's the trth we become so Prejudice why because they got to smell right yeah they got to look right oh no tattoos forget it right but you're not not even walking in the light with that kind of an attitude it's not the attitude of Jesus it was Satan who was full of Pride amen that's right until you become nothing you you got to become nothing and and this is what this is what walking in the light I I I was told and I don't know how true it is they said when brother brandham died and they had his funeral they said all kind of homeless people was at his funeral and they basically had testimonies what brother bradam did for them how many of us are reaching out and could have a testimony like that John is a serious book I love John because John types out the bride right this word must be be real to you alive to you and how are we going to make it happen we have to pray and seek God face so that the love of God will fill us and seal us because when you come to a place when you don't have no human effort to do good but you're doing good see because doing good when it's just human effort it's religion it could be just religion but when you have a nature in you that you're doing so good and you're loving people is that right they say Jesus Lord when did we visit you when did feed you they had no record of doing it amen right because they by Nature were performing the duties of God and oh I can remember when I did this for so and so n no n it's not that you it's just okay so what happens is in this hour right you still have people concerned about Mary and what she did and I'mma keep keep moving like I said you know but but why did God said wheresoever this gospel shall be preached the n9th verse who wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world this also that she have done shall be spoken of for a memorial because you know what we have no idea what she had to press through that's right knowing that she could easily be pulled out and stoned amen but this woman was so captivated by Jesus and what he had done for someone else see testimonies has a great deal has a great should have a great impact on on a Believer or a person who don't even believe when when they hear what God has done for someone else it gives them hope it quickens them but this is the thing that I love when Jesus spoke to this woman and says woman basically your sins be forgiven what did she do it wasn't her Works she was obedient to the Holy Spirit she didn't even ask he said your sin be forgiven and the truth of the matter is what we we fail to see that before the foundation of the world your sins were forgiven amen and all God is asking is for you to walk in that light as he is in the light when I see her anointing his body for death I see God in return anointing my body for life amen and you see how God Amen uses this woman in such a special way to uh make us see the contrast between with religion and Grace amen and that's what we come to this message to see the difference between religion and Grace because everybody every Christian every Buddha Buddha got religion Allah has religion everybody everybody has something good they do amen but none of that saves you amen let's move on there's a lot could be sa let's go uh the Bible said if we we have not sinned we make him a Li and his word is is not in us can anybody say that you do not I mean there are times like you say even when it comes to your healing and your deliverance you says Lord help thy my unbelief it's already done but we F we we wrestle we against this that's why Paul said I crucify it daily I must put the thing to death that Christ may live every day right this is your enemy right this is what the devil devil use to fight your spiritual growth but can I say this and I want you to see this uh every battle you go through is to glorify God no matter what you go through God is going to get the glory right for an example I give you an example when the Hebrew boys as I would finish U continue that message about the darkness when the Hebrew boys were uh thrown uh you know uh in the fire it was their darkest hour but guess what it was what God was using to make the Heathen Praise Him amen he was glorified by the heathens amen up take Daniel nebuch NE Daniel Daniel we know that thou God is God and and when I think about that the Bible said every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God Amen y'all understand me we talking about oh we we'll write another book of Acts the book of Acts never stopped amen that's right I mean even in the church ages when they those people were dying in the name of Jesus they were writing a book of Acts those that went to death and those that overcome it's it's not in the book but they were re they were actually still a continuation of Acts I I don't even know why people don't even see that but we think that we've got to have the raising of the Dead no the book of Acts was also a lot of suffering they were able to endure the punishment or endure the suffering in the name of Jesus Christ because that's the only way they could have done it you cannot endure pain and hold your standard in God without God's anointing amen yeah God will give you Supreme Grace or Supreme faith in the Supreme hour amen it's God not you none of us could have stood up even even Daniel couldn't have stood up to those Lions without the anointing of God amen the Hebrew boys thrown in the fiery F y'all see what I'm saying but they had a revelation who God was I shall not be and I Shall Not Bow I shall not break and that's what John is basically saying because where Satan attack us more than any place you're not saved you need more God how much God how much more God going to give you yeah you know what I'm saying you either s you got it or you don't amen you say well oh I need the Holy Ghost so bad who's to say you don't have it but as long as you don't believe you don't have it you don't have it amen because this age is about faith in the word of God Amen that's it and I believe if you have faith in the word of God as the word of God is preach how many how many how many and how many the Bible said you've never sin in the first place that's right now God put that before you is that tough one but by faith I believe that it's a revelation and if it's a revelation I'm free there is now no condemnation to those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit why should I condemn myself if I got the Holy Ghost are you going to make mistakes oh sure but then there's coming a time I believe those mistakes are going to vanish as we move into that Perfection because the that's what the scripture says of Peter said if these virtues abound and be in you you should never fall you won't error you'll be like him the the divine nature is in total control and I believe that I know maybe others don't but I do second chapter please we'll read a little bit that any questions yes yes sir you answered that they are believers but you have stages and some Believers are just Justified and and some Believers are Sanctified and some Believers have the Holy Spirit right and all that category it it's a growth period right but understand this the Bible said if a man confess with his mouth and believe with his heart it's made unto salvation so you got to understand salvation is a process like growing in from a boy to a man and that's what salvation is like it's like growing up but but the truth of the matter is you still believe you're a man right so that's how it is with the Son of God when you are a son of God you grow from a kid all the way up but you still the Son of God you're going to make mistakes but that's what the blood of Jesus Christ is all about but a sinner is an unbeliever you know and when I say a a real unbeliever someone no matter what you try to do to prove to him that Jesus Christ is Lord they don't believe say that again oh the Bible said that God Reigns on the just and the unjust so when it rains outside it doesn't rain just on the corn but it also rains on the wheat too and weed excuse me so that same mercy and Grace that's given to uh the wheat is always given also given to the the weed yeah this is that's why B the Bible tells us don't be jealous of the people out there that's not serving God and they getting all this kind of stuff this is their reward but for the true Christian our reward is heaven and in a in a in a in a a body that that can't sin can't die can't get weak you know we have we have a a a glorious body fashioned by God yeah but that's what I love about God and and I say that young man because God loves The Sinner he hates the sin because he's the creator of all things God said he would that none should perish and he knows what they made out of God has no pleasure in condemning people but because of their choosing because of who they are because of what they are they make the wrong choice but people oh God did that no this thing would have been like heaven if man hadn't fall take it back to where it come from and so it's it's it's if God can love a sinner we can love a sinner too yeah yes sir when a man it's there's a difference in the sense that conception and birth is two different things when you're conceived into your mother's womb you're being fashioned and formed right you have no life of your own because you're living off of her life right it's like a lot of people that come to church they they accept Jesus Christ as their savior and I want to say this that God doesn't abort any of his children there's no miscarriages with God right every true conception he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it so every conception of God grows from that that little thing in the womb and and and and comes up and and at that time of Deliverance where you take a breath and become your own that's where it is you understand even in nature teaches us that that even the child once it's still in the womb a lot of people depend on the church right you see what I'm saying once you get the Holy Ghost you know you don't depend on the on the church because you got the Holy Ghost within yourself but God God that little life in you is just as important to God as a grown man and it's his work work not ours did I answer your question okay any other questions any other comments preacher okay anytime you know if you wanted to comment on anything it it's amazing because he's been teaching on first John 2 yeah at home Bible study so but I'm going to let him do what he's doing over there but I just want you to understand this this is what I love about God the Lord said I have never lost one go ahead I've never heard that before the reason the only way I could the only thing person I think that would think that Paul is an antichrist is a woman [Laughter] preacher because Paul teaches that women are not supposed to preach and the Bible teaches that Christian well in his past we were all Antichrist it's not just Paul we all did Evil and we all if you ever had a Christian persecute I mean a witness to you before you were ready to to accept it yeah yeah yeah that would be the best way to say it about unbel yeah yeah they thought Jesus was a devil too matter of fact they called him be's above just going with with what he said see so put it this way walk in the light go back to that as he is in the light it's a revelation see the prostitute who was caught in adultery it was revealed to her that Jesus was the Christ the woman at the well who was a prostitute it was revealed to her that Jesus Christ but to the Sadducees and the Pharisees who were supposed to be the religious people they called Jesus a devil and a son of and and a son of uh um you know when you out of wedlock yeah so it's God who reveals right and he showed that it's God who opens the eyes of the blind for example example the man who was born blind he was blind for 30 years until Jesus came and they asked Jesus who did Sin who parent because they believed that the sins of the father is transferred to the children and Jesus answered no none did all of this was done for the glory of God so when God opens up a man's eye eyes regardless to what condition they're in or being are found in is all for the glory of God man none of us you know it's all by Grace not works that's any man should boast so all of this that we're talking about now that's what we we're saying you can't be saved by law and you you can only be saved by the grace of God the law and Grace does not mix and we've been taught law law law law and nothing's wrong with law but I believe this once you get to Holy Ghost you follow his law which is his nature yeah so let's read this yeah I got a few more minutes 1 John 2 beginning at the first verse my little children these things write I unto you that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous right in other words Jesus Christ is our perpetuation he's the man that stands in the Gap you know he's the one that actually pleads our case you know how we sang this song he dropped the charges he dropped the charges well Jesus he was not only the attorney but he was the judge he was everything so he threw the case out and said casmi you know he settled it all for us right by his grace cuz none of us are worthy of Heaven no matter what we do as righteous people our righteous is not of ourselves is of God that's why I don't understand people why people don't want to be Christians BR that's the be brother that's the greatest thing to me I've never ever uh say after becoming a Christian wish that I was not to me it's the greatest thing that ever happened and it's gotten sweeter all the time time when I thought I had knew God then here come more of God it never ends and um and you know like I said Even Heaven if if you know after this this day or after this uh Redemption portion of God can you imagine you can't even imagine how things will be because everything would be perfect nothing will miss a beat I I don't even know how that could how to conceive that the goodness of God will be so great and it never get it'll never get boring you never run you know you know I don't even know what to do because how would be his mind and his mind would be our mind and whatever however he thinks that's the way you know it's kind of like uh how can I say it he'll be the brain of Heaven he'll be the very brain of heaven and however we think is however he think is what we'll do as he thinks we'll know like Adam did I know this is off of my subject but how Adam knew how to name the CH the the animals is because he had the mind of God and however God thought whatever he thought of that animal Adam was able to see it by Revelation and called those animals the same thing God did call so that's how we'll be when it's all over amen won't be no secrets I love that right so he's that advocate he pleads for us uh don't you love that the blood of Jesus Christ right you know the Bible call him our high priest but now we look at it now the high priest has become the very bleeding bloody word of this message how can it not cuz anybody that listen to the message and really listen to it it's going to break you it's going to cause you to humble yourself it's going to cause you to wash yourself that word is going to do it see it's because it's the spirit of it you know it's not the letter of it it's the spirit God is alive and well right so let's do the second verse and then we'll we'll end it and he is perpetuation of our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world and that's that's the that's the key the whole world was saved on Calvary the blood of Jesus Christ when it dropped on the ground according to the prophet of God the whole world was saved but people go to hell because they don't accept it and a pardon is not a pardon except it be accepted as a pardon it's simple if a person really believe that Jesus Christ died in their stead then you he becomes your sin and you becomes his righteousness it's a not even a fair trade but I'll take it amen you know so he's pleading our case and he became our sin that we might become his righteousness so in all that you do are you familiar with the with the uh uh Matthew 25 to 10 virgins five were wise and five was foolish five had they all was slumbered incept the Bible says and but they were all given robes talking about the wedding now so when when he called the people for the wedding when they came to the door they he had someone there to give everybody the same robe no matter where they were Rich poor whatever the case may be they all wore the same robe and it was and it was given to them they didn't have to work for it all they had to do is show up and that's what God is saying all you got to do is show up and I'll do the rest and this this this is all she oh brother I I I know I love God no if you don't love your brother you don't love God that's the Bible how can you say you love your brother or you know love God and hear your brother you see him all the time and you don't love him the Bible say you're a liar right cu the Bible say you haven't seen God at no time but how can you love him you've never seen him but you see your brother and you don't love him amen see that it doesn't work it can't work you got to love God in order to love God you got to love his people love your enemy love those that despitefully use you pray for them all of that but it's a wonderful situation because you know what you'll never have high blood pressure ERS and diabetes and because all of that comes from the lack of love all of that let's stand and I believe the more we progress and move into Divine love all of the the afflictions of unbelief and and hatred or whatever the case may everything that we've allowed Darkness because Jesus said there be no Darkness there's no darkness in me even God said there's no darkness in me he's the light and if he's the light Darkness can't dwell in light amen it has to be dispelled and I believe with all my heart once we move right into that light that revelation of God and you can see how much grace he's given to you you're going to want to give that same Grace to someone else right it's riches is the riches is beyond is beyond any money anything that uh this world can give this this revelation of truth that really is changing us we're not changing ourselves it is changing us amen let's bow father God we thank you for the word we thank you for this hour of teaching instructing encouraging uh Lord I just pray that something was said tonight that will not only glorify you but give uh us a greater revelation of who you are in us not above us not with us but in us that we may manifest you and magnify you declare you that people may see you in us and glorify you in heaven bless us now as we depart give us traveling mercy and Grace and let no hurt harm or danger come upon us Lord until we meet again in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen we're thism amen
