[46:33] [Music]
[46:48] [Music]
[46:57] [Music]
[47:08] [Music]
[47:20] I can remember when we first came to
[47:28] this message people were coming from
[47:33] everywhere we would sing that song at
[47:37] the time we just was having service in a
[47:40] church in a house I tell you what that
[47:43] house was really worshipping with us
[47:48] times of our lives during that time
[47:52] almost every gift was working in the
[47:55] church
[47:55] [Music]
[47:57] songs speaking in tongues disarmament
[48:02] during that time but that was just a
[48:06] free Lu to what we're about to
[48:07] experience in a day or so from now we're
[48:13] just going to get right into the Word of
[48:16] God pray that the Lord give me what to
[48:19] say I've got a lot of things to say
[48:22] tonight I know I won't be able to finish
[48:23] them all but just pray that God will
[48:27] give me other words I believe that we're
[48:31] living in the last days you know
[48:34] according to the prophet of God in a
[48:36] message Exodus he said we're about a
[48:39] minute and a half away if we counting
[48:44] the time in which God has allotted a
[48:47] thousand years as a day and we realized
[48:51] by God's grace because we were talking
[48:53] about a generation a generation it's 40
[48:55] years and he said that generation about
[48:57] a minute and a half in God's time but I
[49:00] want to really preach tonight I'll teach
[49:04] tonight however God would leave me like
[49:07] I said there's so many things I want to
[49:08] get over and maybe if I don't get it all
[49:11] said done tonight we'll try to finish it
[49:14] up or do something different every time
[49:16] I say that I'm there to go different way
[49:18] so I'm quite careful how I say it but as
[49:22] we stand let us turn to 2nd Peter please
[49:26] 2nd Peter the first chapter we're gonna
[49:32] read the 17th verse down to the 21st
[49:36] verse and then we're going to go to
[49:38] Revelation steam which is a familiar
[49:40] scripture I believe for all of us I'm
[49:46] really excited about the things in which
[49:49] God is doing a lot of times people think
[49:53] that God blow a horn or something and
[49:56] say look at me but most of the time when
[49:58] God is doing something most people don't
[50:01] even know who you're doing it and he
[50:03] does it in such a simple way that people
[50:06] can't catch it with their intellectual
[50:08] minds it actually takes a
[50:10] it takes an inspiration from God for us
[50:14] to see what he's doing as we are you
[50:19] there
[50:19] second Peter first chapter beginning at
[50:22] the seventeenth verse but he received
[50:25] from God the Father honor and glory when
[50:29] there came such a voice to him from the
[50:32] excellent glory this is my beloved Son
[50:37] in whom I am well pleased and the voice
[50:40] which came from heaven we heard when we
[50:44] were with him in the holy mountain
[50:48] remember the word holy mountain the
[50:49] words we have also a more sure prophecy
[50:53] a more sure word of prophecy we have
[50:58] this is what the Word of God is speaking
[51:01] and think about the prophecy and that
[51:04] day compared to what it transpired in
[51:06] our day we have also a more sure word of
[51:10] prophecy where until ye do well that ye
[51:15] take heed as unto a light that shine it
[51:19] in a dark place until the day dawn and
[51:23] the day star arise in your heart now
[51:28] I'll come back to say something to that
[51:32] in just a moment knowing this first that
[51:36] no prophecy of the scripture is of any
[51:39] private interpretation but the prophecy
[51:43] came not in old time by the will of man
[51:47] but holy men of God spake as they were
[51:50] moved by the Holy Ghost revelation 10
[52:08] beginning at the first verse and I saw
[52:12] another mighty angel come down from
[52:15] heaven clothed with the cloud and a
[52:19] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[52:21] was as it were the Sun in his feet as
[52:24] pillar of fire and he had in his hand a
[52:28] little book open and he said his right
[52:31] foot upon the sea and his left foot on
[52:34] the earth and he cried with a loud voice
[52:37] as when a lion roar and when he had
[52:41] cried seven thunders uttered their
[52:44] voices and when the seven thunders utter
[52:48] had other dear voices I was about to
[52:53] write now I want to pause here just for
[52:55] a moment cause whatever the others the
[52:57] thunders uttered John understood it
[53:01] because he was getting ready to write it
[53:04] and I heard a voice from heaven saying
[53:07] unto me seal up those things which the
[53:11] seven thunders uttered and write them
[53:13] not so I want you to understand that
[53:17] these thunders that that that John saw
[53:20] there are heard there by God's grace he
[53:23] understood them they will be sealed up
[53:26] until the end and the angel which I saw
[53:31] standing upon the sea and upon the earth
[53:34] lifted up his hands to heaven and swear
[53:38] by them that liveth for ever and ever
[53:40] who created heaven and the things that
[53:43] therein are and the earth and the things
[53:46] that therein are and the sea and the
[53:48] things which are therein that there
[53:51] should be time no longer but in the days
[53:55] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[53:57] he shall began to sound the mystery of
[54:01] God should be finished as he hath
[54:03] declared to his servants the prophets
[54:06] and in the voice which are her and the
[54:09] voice which are heard from heavens faker
[54:12] to me again and said go and take the
[54:17] little book which is open in the hand of
[54:19] the angel which standeth
[54:21] upon the sea and upon the earth and I
[54:24] went unto the angel and I said unto him
[54:27] give me the little book and he said unto
[54:30] me take it eat it up and it shall make
[54:34] that bad belly bitter but it shall be in
[54:37] that mouth sweet as honey now I want you
[54:41] to understand also that a lot of these
[54:43] things that are being said God in the
[54:47] spirit gives us something to relate to
[54:51] something to relate to in other words
[54:55] when John ate the book we wanted we need
[54:58] to know what John was eating because
[55:00] that is something to receive you
[55:02] received whatever that was in the hand
[55:05] of him
[55:06] right so you got to understand this that
[55:09] this message it's not something that you
[55:11] only believe but you must receive it and
[55:16] John said that when he took it out of
[55:18] the right hand which is the hand of
[55:20] authority it became bitter but it shall
[55:23] be in thine mouth sweet it was sweet so
[55:26] the book must be received and I took the
[55:30] little book out of the Angels hand and
[55:32] ate it up
[55:33] and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[55:35] just like the angel said and as soon as
[55:38] I had eaten it my belly was bitter and
[55:41] he said unto me thou must prophesy again
[55:45] before many peoples and nations and
[55:48] tongues and kings let us pray
[55:52] father God we thank you for your grace
[55:54] in your mercy we thank you for being so
[55:57] good to us
[55:58] you have been better to us Lord and we
[56:01] have been to ourselves father what a
[56:04] mighty God we serve we love you Lord
[56:07] Jesus we pray father God because there
[56:10] is no way that I can minister the
[56:12] thoughts that you have given me today
[56:14] except you speak them through me
[56:16] help us Lord as we approach your throne
[56:20] as humble as we know how
[56:22] cleanse us and clean us from anything
[56:24] all unrighteousness Lord let nothing
[56:27] hinder the message tonight father we
[56:29] thank you in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[56:31] amen
[56:32] you may be seated
[56:34] you know we we must realize by God's
[56:37] grace that the things that we are now
[56:40] experiencing is something that has been
[56:44] before because you and I must understand
[56:48] that Solomon said that there is no new
[56:51] thing under the Sun and that which has
[56:53] been is now and you know how it is in
[56:56] other words history have a tendency to
[56:59] repeat itself it may be different in
[57:03] characters but the spirits are always
[57:06] the same
[57:08] according to 1st Thessalonians 5 1
[57:12] through 9 and we're going to read that
[57:13] but you don't have to turn here Paul
[57:16] writes to us and he says but of the time
[57:18] and seasons brethren you have no need
[57:20] that I write unto you for yourselves
[57:23] know perfectly that the day of the Lord
[57:25] so cometh as a thief in the night for
[57:29] when they shall say peace and safety
[57:31] then sudden destruction cometh upon them
[57:34] as travail upon a woman with child and
[57:37] they shall not escape but ye brethren
[57:41] are not in darkness that that day should
[57:43] overtake you as a thief I trust were not
[57:49] ye are the children of the light and the
[57:52] children of the day we are not of the
[57:55] night nor of darkness therefore let us
[57:59] not sleep as do others but let us watch
[58:02] and be sober and see that's the thing he
[58:05] says now let us not sleep but let us
[58:09] watch and be sober for that they that
[58:13] sleep sleep in the night and they that
[58:16] be drunken a drunk
[58:18] in the night but let us who are of the
[58:22] day be sober putting on the breastplate
[58:25] of faith and love and for a helmet the
[58:29] hope of salvation this is the part I
[58:32] like for God has not appointed us to
[58:35] wrath but to obtain salvation by our
[58:40] Lord Jesus Christ that is so important
[58:45] because I tell you
[58:47] we're living in a day that we must know
[58:50] what God is doing so we look at this
[58:53] thing and we we we want to back up a
[58:56] mint a second Peter go back there the
[58:59] first chapter and the nineteenth verse
[59:01] says we have also a more sure word of
[59:06] prophecy where until you do well that ye
[59:10] take heed as unto a light that shine it
[59:13] in a dark place until the day dawn and
[59:19] the day star arise in your heart and you
[59:24] know reading that you you you you may
[59:26] not understand but let me say it like
[59:28] this and you made it may understand when
[59:31] we talk about a light in a dark place
[59:34] we're talking about the the seven golden
[59:37] candlesticks was a light in a dark place
[59:40] and those seven lights worked as one and
[59:45] it was used to see what was in the room
[59:50] but then there was another place what we
[59:53] call the Holies of Holies and we
[59:57] understand that behind the veil was a
[1:00:00] light that was not a natural light it
[1:00:05] was not a man-made light it was what we
[1:00:09] call the Shekinah glory now understand
[1:00:12] it meant in order for the d-star the
[1:00:17] light of God or the Son of God to rise
[1:00:20] in your heart is that right we're living
[1:00:23] in a time he meant that you and I must
[1:00:26] come to a place in Christ to be capped
[1:00:29] or to be crowned however you want to put
[1:00:33] it with love did I and I'm gonna get to
[1:00:37] something in just a moment now we're
[1:00:39] looking at this thing and was thinking
[1:00:41] oh god what's happening but we must
[1:00:44] realize Amen that we're living in a time
[1:00:46] that brother Branham call it the third
[1:00:49] Exodus and I was going to entitle it but
[1:00:53] I thought let me do something a little
[1:00:55] little different in my title I wanted to
[1:00:58] let you know that these are
[1:01:01] the ending this is the ending of the
[1:01:05] world these are the days the ones that
[1:01:08] we are living in are the days that's
[1:01:12] literally coming up to the very end of
[1:01:15] the world now a lot of people don't want
[1:01:17] to believe that but it's true anyhow we
[1:01:21] see that in Peter Peter says that a
[1:01:24] thousand years is as a day with the Lord
[1:01:27] right and we have come six days
[1:01:31] going into the seventh if you want to
[1:01:33] put it this way and every 2,000 years
[1:01:36] God does something the first 2,000 years
[1:01:41] amen was the flood the second - 2,000
[1:01:45] years Amen was the coming of Christ
[1:01:48] right and now we have the truth the
[1:01:52] third 2,000 years something must happen
[1:01:55] and the Bible tells us at the end of
[1:01:58] this the sixth day you and I must
[1:02:02] understand that something is supposed to
[1:02:04] happen supernaturally now why would you
[1:02:09] call this the third Exodus and let me
[1:02:10] I've got no so I want to I want to try
[1:02:13] my best to put it in in in order by
[1:02:16] God's grace because we realized by God's
[1:02:19] grace that something must happen the
[1:02:22] world can no longer go the way it's
[1:02:24] going we we serve a just God we serve a
[1:02:29] holy God
[1:02:30] we serve a righteous God and as one
[1:02:33] brother said if God doesn't judge
[1:02:35] America he'll have to raise up Sodom and
[1:02:37] Gomorrah and apologize because we're
[1:02:40] really worse than Sodom ever been why
[1:02:44] because this is what we call the harvest
[1:02:47] time this is the time when everything
[1:02:51] come to fruition everything in harvest
[1:02:54] everything that has been planted now we
[1:02:56] see it in a mature stage God when God
[1:03:02] created Adam Adam had Dominion God had
[1:03:07] Adam had a body different from what we
[1:03:10] had in other words he had some part of
[1:03:13] God that we
[1:03:14] we're now moving into Adam was born or
[1:03:19] he was created with what we call a
[1:03:20] theophany which is a word body he knew
[1:03:24] God God knew him right but when Adam and
[1:03:28] Eve sinned he forfeited it and from that
[1:03:32] point on amen
[1:03:34] this became Satan's world is that right
[1:03:38] Satan is the Prince he's the power of
[1:03:42] all the principalities beyond him uh
[1:03:45] said in other words he's a king in his
[1:03:49] kingdom
[1:03:50] he's got princess he's got he's got
[1:03:53] powers under him but he is the chief
[1:03:57] ruler and you and I must understand that
[1:04:00] this world in as it is is still being
[1:04:04] run ran by satanic power so much so when
[1:04:10] brother mantle preached a message
[1:04:11] Satan's Eden he said in this day Satan
[1:04:16] is not only the god of this world but
[1:04:19] he's actually being worshipped as God
[1:04:22] even in the churches people are thinking
[1:04:26] that they're worshipping Jesus Christ
[1:04:28] when they're worshipping Lucifer Oh
[1:04:31] somebody help me here but the first Adam
[1:04:35] lost his position he lost the authority
[1:04:39] we call it the title need write the
[1:04:45] title deed was not a piece of paper the
[1:04:50] title deed was God himself
[1:04:51] Oh somebody help me here it wasn't
[1:04:55] something secondary it was God who
[1:04:59] enveloped Adam Adam was in God and God
[1:05:04] was in Adam and when he sinned God has
[1:05:09] to separate himself right is that right
[1:05:13] brother man said the title deed went
[1:05:16] back to the owner who was God himself
[1:05:21] now you got to understand what the title
[1:05:24] deed is it is the authority of psy
[1:05:28] and daughters of God is that right
[1:05:31] remember now I'm saying the first Adam
[1:05:34] lost it but the second Adam gained it
[1:05:37] back he was the one who defeated death
[1:05:42] hell in the grave it's not like God is
[1:05:51] going to defeat it it's already defeated
[1:05:53] and that's why Paul said we are more
[1:05:57] than conquerors through Christ now the
[1:06:03] second Adam regained the position for
[1:06:06] man time and he showed that's what John
[1:06:10] said John said that in the book of John
[1:06:13] the first chapter says John was not that
[1:06:16] light but he bore witness of the light
[1:06:19] see and that light was the life of me
[1:06:24] see in other words we lost the real life
[1:06:27] of what a man supposed to be like when
[1:06:31] created and made in the image of God
[1:06:34] from the time Adam fell he could never
[1:06:38] produce sons and daughters of God he
[1:06:42] could only produce sons and daughters of
[1:06:45] Adam they were made in the image of Adam
[1:06:49] and Adam was made in the image of God
[1:06:52] when Adam was a fallen son somebody help
[1:06:56] me here the Bible said that this first
[1:06:58] Adam was was actually earthly he was
[1:07:03] made out of the dust but this second
[1:07:06] Adam was a quickening spirit the Bible
[1:07:09] said he was not only just a quickening
[1:07:11] spirit but he was Lord he was actually
[1:07:15] caught manifested in the flesh
[1:07:19] now we realized by God's grace that
[1:07:24] after the fall as we said when Jesus
[1:07:27] came and he redeemed us his death had
[1:07:31] was necessary
[1:07:32] now I'm gonna say this why because the
[1:07:35] Bible said when it comes to a testator
[1:07:39] he says as long as the test data is
[1:07:42] still alive the testament cannot be
[1:07:45] enforced remember and you got to
[1:07:49] understand so Jesus was the test data
[1:07:51] and hardly nobody ever knew he was here
[1:07:55] but after he died after he shared his
[1:07:59] blood then the gospel began to go
[1:08:03] throughout all of the world you
[1:08:07] understand me not just the gospel but
[1:08:11] the Bible said that his his his
[1:08:13] Testament was in his blood but the blood
[1:08:18] of Jesus couldn't work for us as long as
[1:08:20] he was alive
[1:08:22] that's why he said it's best that I go
[1:08:24] to the Father so when I leave I'll swim
[1:08:28] back I'll send back the very power that
[1:08:32] caused me to be Who I am
[1:08:36] hallelujah is that right he said I'd go
[1:08:39] to God and I go back I come from God and
[1:08:41] I go back to God
[1:08:43] now i'ma brag on him a little bit
[1:08:44] because you see Jesus Christ he men was
[1:08:48] not not Jew nor Gentile he was literally
[1:08:52] the blood of car Mary had nothing to do
[1:08:56] when she was a first inkubator
[1:08:58] the first surrogate mother if I could
[1:09:01] see it like that because God created the
[1:09:04] egg and he created the blood hallelujah
[1:09:08] otherwise Jesus would have been a sinner
[1:09:11] this is why Jesus never called Mary
[1:09:14] Mother he said woman hallelujah and you
[1:09:19] got to understand even at his death he
[1:09:22] still called a woman why because there's
[1:09:27] no such thing as the mother of God if
[1:09:31] it's a mother of god she's more God than
[1:09:34] that the son here hallelujah so you say
[1:09:38] what do you mean where are you going
[1:09:39] with this I want you to understand that
[1:09:41] when God comes when God comes he comes
[1:09:45] to show us something
[1:09:47] and in this last day we must understand
[1:09:52] that God is only calling the elected
[1:09:55] oh come on somebody
[1:09:58] why amen because it is the elected the
[1:10:03] chosen ones that God prepared a place
[1:10:07] for now when he came to redeem us his
[1:10:14] blood still saves but he also now when
[1:10:18] he comes again he's coming to take us
[1:10:22] with him then he's going to come again
[1:10:25] and when he comes again we'll come with
[1:10:28] him but there's a process in which God
[1:10:32] has allowed us us who believed to see
[1:10:36] somebody said well they were talking
[1:10:38] about the baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:10:40] I'm jumping a little bit so they say
[1:10:42] well it's the dis and it's a dad you
[1:10:44] know
[1:10:44] but when you're baptized with the Holy
[1:10:47] Ghost don't you know you're actually
[1:10:48] born as a baby so I got the Holy Ghost
[1:10:53] oh praise God that's good but you just
[1:10:56] started you even you haven't even had a
[1:11:01] barrel yet until you get the Holy Ghost
[1:11:04] when you get the Holy Ghost now you're
[1:11:07] going to be tried and tested hallelujah
[1:11:11] you've got to suffer because you got to
[1:11:17] realize by God's grace where God is
[1:11:20] taking us then let me hurry up we know
[1:11:25] about God's grace that whenever God
[1:11:28] doesn't exit us he always use a prophet
[1:11:34] hello is that right the truth of the
[1:11:39] matter is when when God got ready to
[1:11:41] destroy the earth amen he didn't use a
[1:11:43] lot or you know or something else he
[1:11:48] used noah who was a prophet and the
[1:11:52] prophet has a mind of god somebody help
[1:11:56] me here the bible said he has no seed of
[1:11:59] his own in other words he's not one that
[1:12:02] would personally interpret the word god
[1:12:05] interprets it through him y'all
[1:12:08] understand me
[1:12:09] because the only person who can really
[1:12:11] tell you what this means is the man who
[1:12:14] wrote it and the man who inspired it
[1:12:18] hallelujah
[1:12:19] now imma going with this because a lot
[1:12:23] of time I read there even in Exodus
[1:12:25] brother branham said Moses was not the
[1:12:27] pillar of fire he was he was that he was
[1:12:31] the servant he was a man underneath the
[1:12:33] pillow fight being led by the field of
[1:12:35] fire now I may have that in my notes I'm
[1:12:37] not sure but the point I'm working with
[1:12:39] is this pillar fire we're working with
[1:12:42] now we had no idea what creation was
[1:12:45] like until the Prophet caught the mind
[1:12:48] of God and told us that when God created
[1:12:51] the earth all of a sudden there was
[1:12:53] nothing and all of a sudden come a light
[1:12:57] that he called the Sun yeah and I'm
[1:13:01] saying and that Sun according to st.
[1:13:04] John one created everything in the
[1:13:09] beginning was the word the Word was with
[1:13:10] God and the the Bible tells us
[1:13:13] everything that was made he made it and
[1:13:16] he made it for his own pleasure
[1:13:19] what a mastermind somebody asked me the
[1:13:24] other day well why we had to go through
[1:13:25] all of this I tell you what you'll never
[1:13:28] understand love until you go through
[1:13:31] something God did this because he loved
[1:13:35] us he said well Adam and Eve sinned we
[1:13:38] became like God knowing good from evil
[1:13:40] it was his intent he wants us to know
[1:13:44] good from evil Satan or Lucifer will
[1:13:48] never ever come and play again they'll
[1:13:53] never come in angel or cherubim whatever
[1:13:58] they'll never be another revolting in
[1:14:01] heaven after this because God's purpose
[1:14:06] will be fulfilled now you must
[1:14:10] understand that here God comes along by
[1:14:13] way of a prophet and we look at Egypt
[1:14:18] and all of us we've said this that it
[1:14:20] looked like we're going through another
[1:14:21] eighth age of experience
[1:14:23] and at this time something was going on
[1:14:27] cuz now if you take all of the history
[1:14:30] and I can't do it in one service but
[1:14:32] let's take what Babylon did Babylon was
[1:14:36] cruel
[1:14:37] Babylon put the people of God in into
[1:14:40] bondage Babylon was was a murderer but
[1:14:46] Babylon mixed with some other things and
[1:14:49] all of a sudden the same spirit of
[1:14:51] Babylon moves her own right you said
[1:14:56] what do you mean well let me put it this
[1:14:57] way the same spirit that was in Babylon
[1:15:00] was also in Egypt and that spirit rose
[1:15:05] up and became a man we know that in the
[1:15:17] time of Ramses now I've been to Egypt
[1:15:20] and they said Ramses and Moses and all
[1:15:22] that never existed well I guess when God
[1:15:25] tore
[1:15:26] they lost everything huh that's the same
[1:15:30] thing they say about brother Branham
[1:15:31] they said you know there was nobody who
[1:15:33] fell off the bridge and whatever that
[1:15:35] that's nonsense
[1:15:37] yeah because God get rid of the evidence
[1:15:40] doesn't mean it didn't happen
[1:15:42] and we look at this and you said what
[1:15:45] what do you mean brothers because we
[1:15:47] think we see by God's grace that why God
[1:15:50] was working on Ramsey raising up Ramsey
[1:15:53] there was a Moses too there was an
[1:15:56] intellectual side and a spiritual power
[1:16:00] rising up at the same time hallelujah
[1:16:04] it's like Lucifer and Micah always the
[1:16:07] same battle with different people and
[1:16:10] why Ramses what but you know you
[1:16:13] remember said he said TK had all those
[1:16:15] kids killed and everything else and then
[1:16:17] you know trying to stop the deliverer
[1:16:19] hallelujah isn't that familiar because
[1:16:22] even when role was in power they still
[1:16:25] tried to stop the raw your seed by
[1:16:27] killing them but every time the devil
[1:16:31] tried to stop God he's already a step
[1:16:34] ahead he
[1:16:37] is that right when they tried to kill
[1:16:40] the children in Bethlehem God had
[1:16:42] already told more Josephine Mary
[1:16:46] the devil is coming get out of here
[1:16:48] comes right down to Egypt hallelujah
[1:16:53] so you and I must understand that God
[1:16:55] doesn't change his mind so after we see
[1:16:59] that God since a prophet and in the
[1:17:01] first Exodus which was the time of Moses
[1:17:04] then God brought a God prophet we call
[1:17:08] him Jesus he was a prophet of all
[1:17:11] prophets is that right
[1:17:13] but in our day he brings a king prophet
[1:17:16] is why you call him a king because when
[1:17:20] he gave for the brand of the Kings sword
[1:17:24] he was a king but yet he was a prophet
[1:17:27] so you saw what do you mean you and I
[1:17:30] must understand that we're living in the
[1:17:32] last day and you know everybody tried to
[1:17:36] figures out the thunders you know how
[1:17:38] brother Brendan said don't even try to
[1:17:40] figure that out right he said God will
[1:17:45] interpret his own word when that time
[1:17:48] comes if you are chosen and elected you
[1:17:52] will hear the voice of God is that right
[1:17:55] he said what what do you mean because
[1:17:56] remember even in revelations 10 when the
[1:17:59] thunders other we didn't understand it
[1:18:01] when that seven seals were open
[1:18:04] brother varlyn said when that last Hsieh
[1:18:06] was opened all of a sudden there was a
[1:18:07] half-hour silence right and he said when
[1:18:11] everything thought that he talked about
[1:18:13] how it was like a rocket remember he
[1:18:16] came back he said it was a rocket shut
[1:18:18] up
[1:18:18] boom boom boom shut up five five five
[1:18:21] five so when you see something
[1:18:23] continually that way it is either it's
[1:18:27] timeless it's eternal
[1:18:31] so whatever the seven thunders uttered
[1:18:34] it was eternal and there's only one
[1:18:38] eternal and that's God Himself and
[1:18:43] everybody I got the quote and I left it
[1:18:45] at the house he's in the place I
[1:18:47] couldn't get it out but anyway everybody
[1:18:50] the seven thunders of the the virtues
[1:18:53] and so many people believe that but
[1:18:58] according to brother Branham the old the
[1:19:00] Ephesus church aid had the virtue of how
[1:19:03] weren't they raptured if that's what's
[1:19:09] gonna give you make you rapture I want
[1:19:12] you to understand that's important very
[1:19:15] important you're supposed to have that
[1:19:18] because if you don't have all this all
[1:19:21] the way up to the brunt of the kindness
[1:19:23] charity can't sit down but every church
[1:19:29] did it had a virtue it had to press
[1:19:32] through right but at the time when it
[1:19:36] came to us and then we get the whole
[1:19:38] loaf in other words the experience that
[1:19:41] we get with God is supposed to take us
[1:19:43] from faith all the way up hallelujah and
[1:19:48] understand this that we when it comes to
[1:19:51] this Amen God has done all the
[1:19:54] conquering somebody it was the Holy
[1:19:59] Ghost that conquered in in Ephesus age
[1:20:03] not the people it ain't even you
[1:20:06] you're not the Conqueror he's a
[1:20:08] conqueror in you sometimes I think by
[1:20:16] God's grace we've got the seven thunders
[1:20:18] in the wrong place because everybody's
[1:20:21] trying to try to do something my remnant
[1:20:23] but when the Sears was open and when
[1:20:25] that thunder when it came to thundering
[1:20:26] brother Branham said he couldn't
[1:20:28] understand there's a part it was like an
[1:20:31] unknown tongue and I've heard people try
[1:20:33] to define it leave it alone but let me
[1:20:37] say it like this what it will do what is
[1:20:39] going to do is going to translate you
[1:20:46] hello because that seventh seal was the
[1:20:50] coming of Christ we saw him as the
[1:20:55] mighty angel standing there Amen with
[1:20:58] one foot on the seat and the other one
[1:21:00] on their own land
[1:21:01] what was he declared
[1:21:04] we'll be no more in otherwise everything
[1:21:07] he conquered on Calvary has now been
[1:21:12] given back to him hallelujah
[1:21:15] but it didn't stop there John saw the
[1:21:19] book he saw the authority he saw the
[1:21:22] title deed he saw God oh my you said
[1:21:27] what do you mean brother Brooke listen
[1:21:28] he saw what what he needed in order to
[1:21:34] make heaven because we realized by God
[1:21:39] let me let me read something quickly let
[1:21:41] me read something quickly a quote quote
[1:21:42] from poppycock he says Amen coming from
[1:21:46] the 3rd Exodus he said God ever makes a
[1:21:51] decision to do anything one way he can
[1:21:54] never change it and in the Garden of
[1:21:58] Eden when he wanted to redeem a man back
[1:22:00] to fellowship he made a decision it was
[1:22:03] the blood
[1:22:04] they tried education they tried
[1:22:07] denomination they tried nationalized
[1:22:10] realization and everything else and it
[1:22:13] never works there's only one place that
[1:22:16] God will ever meet with a man and that's
[1:22:19] under the shed blood like it was in Eden
[1:22:22] it never changed now you said well what
[1:22:26] this has to do with anything because you
[1:22:29] got to understand only the seed of God
[1:22:32] will recognize and receive the blood or
[1:22:37] the revelation of the blood Cain seed
[1:22:40] will choose organizations over the blood
[1:22:44] any day it will choose intellectualism
[1:22:47] over the blood any day tree it doesn't
[1:22:50] matter it's not about how deep you are
[1:22:52] and I find out that even in this message
[1:22:55] people think you're saved by the depth
[1:22:57] of the word hallelujah what a deception
[1:23:01] you're only saved by the grace of God
[1:23:05] and because God has elected you you
[1:23:09] could be dumb as a doorknob but if God
[1:23:12] has elected you to be bribed there's
[1:23:14] nothing in hell or heaven
[1:23:17] that can stop you from making a rapture
[1:23:19] it gets on my nerves I could say it as a
[1:23:22] man people want to put you in and put
[1:23:25] you out ain't got no power
[1:23:30] ain't got no signs ain't got nothing
[1:23:33] excuse my English but it ain't God they
[1:23:35] got nothing
[1:23:39] Paul said I didn't come to you with
[1:23:43] excellence of speech I came with
[1:23:45] demonstration and power
[1:23:47] we came to demonstrate what Malachi for
[1:23:51] brought not to just rattle it off like
[1:23:54] some educated intellectual nut forgive
[1:23:56] me I can't help it because that's just
[1:24:01] what it is
[1:24:03] here we telling people that we're the
[1:24:05] bride and we can't even come together in
[1:24:07] unity you know you got to watch these
[1:24:10] preachers cuz sometime they have a
[1:24:12] weapon behind their back but anyway
[1:24:16] let's move on you love the Lord so we
[1:24:20] look at this thing and we say oh brother
[1:24:22] Wordsworth he says listen God never
[1:24:25] changed in the Garden of Eden when he
[1:24:27] wanted to redeem a man back to
[1:24:29] fellowship he made a decision it was the
[1:24:32] blood y'all heard me he tried to educate
[1:24:35] it they tried the nomination they tried
[1:24:37] nationalization and everything else and
[1:24:39] it never works there's only one place
[1:24:41] that could God will ever meet a man and
[1:24:43] that's under the shed blood like it
[1:24:45] wasn't even it's never changed so where
[1:24:49] is the blood the blood has to be
[1:24:52] somewhere it's not your organization
[1:24:55] that's just a covering like Adam and Eve
[1:25:00] when they got naked they tried to cover
[1:25:03] their nakedness with fig leaf your
[1:25:05] religion is a fig leaf and that fig leaf
[1:25:09] will never satisfy God you've got to
[1:25:11] have the blood hallelujah and we know
[1:25:15] it's not the literal blood anymore but
[1:25:17] it's the life of the blood hallelujah
[1:25:20] that life that was in the blood of Jesus
[1:25:22] must come upon you in your heart not on
[1:25:27] your head not on your body
[1:25:30] it must come into your heart that is the
[1:25:33] Daystar and when the Daystar is in your
[1:25:37] heart you're no longer a child of the
[1:25:39] night you're not oh no longer in
[1:25:41] darkness hallelujah ha because we have a
[1:25:44] word hallelujah we had a man in holiday
[1:25:48] who can turn on the light and he did
[1:25:54] only one place God met in the days of
[1:25:59] job under the sacrifice lamb only one
[1:26:02] only place he met in the days of Israel
[1:26:04] was under the sacrifice lamb like he did
[1:26:07] in the Garden of Eden under the
[1:26:09] sacrifice lamb the only place he meets
[1:26:11] today is not in the denomination they
[1:26:14] fuss and stew amongst one another huh
[1:26:18] that sounds familiar
[1:26:20] denominations he'd even say
[1:26:22] organizations he said denomination and
[1:26:25] don't tell me we don't have
[1:26:26] denominations hallelujah let's move on
[1:26:29] they fuss and stew among one another not
[1:26:31] in church unity they still do the same
[1:26:34] thing
[1:26:34] not in intellectuals they all mixed up
[1:26:37] but under the blood of the Lamb every
[1:26:40] believer can meet with fellowship where
[1:26:42] the life is God chose in the days of the
[1:26:46] Exodus he called out a group and out of
[1:26:49] that group I want you to know something
[1:26:50] he only got two that went to the
[1:26:53] promised land
[1:26:54] whew now watch this because we talked
[1:26:58] about a promised land he pulled them out
[1:27:01] of Egypt and took him to a natural land
[1:27:04] hallelujah Jesus pulled him out of
[1:27:07] denomination and organization and
[1:27:09] brought them into the land of the Holy
[1:27:11] Ghost so where do we go from here
[1:27:14] that's why brother Evans a justification
[1:27:17] make roof of st. vacation st. vacation
[1:27:20] make room for the bachelor the Holy
[1:27:21] Ghost hallelujah and the baptism of the
[1:27:24] Holy Ghost make room for the Daystar for
[1:27:27] Christ himself
[1:27:29] hallelujah so we can't just stop at the
[1:27:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost we've got to
[1:27:35] mature Alleluia is that right we've got
[1:27:42] the mature
[1:27:43] and if the seed of God has been quicker
[1:27:46] than you it's gonna mature I'd love to
[1:27:49] watch the cornfields because they can
[1:27:51] beat those seeds can be sown all at the
[1:27:53] same time but they don't all come up at
[1:27:55] the same time they don't all grow as
[1:27:58] tall as each other you know you got some
[1:27:59] tall and some short in some middle ways
[1:28:01] hallelujah same seed that's how it is
[1:28:05] with us
[1:28:05] hallelujah see the song hallelujah but
[1:28:09] your time coming up it's coming up
[1:28:12] hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord
[1:28:15] that's why the prophet of God said we
[1:28:17] should lay in the presence of the Sun to
[1:28:20] be ripe under let's move on God chooses
[1:28:25] the day of Exeter's he called out a
[1:28:27] group and out of group day I want you to
[1:28:29] notice something he only got two that
[1:28:31] went to the promised land what did he
[1:28:34] choose to to take them out by politics
[1:28:37] organization
[1:28:38] he chose a prophet with a supernatural
[1:28:42] sign of a pillar of fire I'm gonna get
[1:28:45] to that in just a moment that the people
[1:28:47] wouldn't be mistaken what the Prophet
[1:28:50] said was the truth and God comes down a
[1:28:53] pillar of fire and vindicates himself
[1:28:55] shows his word is right that's what he
[1:28:59] brought his first Exodus his second
[1:29:02] Exodus let's go back to the first Exodus
[1:29:04] what did he do when God raised up first
[1:29:07] of all he heared Moses and he calls
[1:29:11] Moses Amen to be brought into a place of
[1:29:15] bondage we all know that Egypt was a
[1:29:18] place of bondage it was a place of
[1:29:21] intellect hallelujah and that's why God
[1:29:25] she you see you said what do you mean
[1:29:26] but Moses had it was a proper child
[1:29:29] that's what the Bible said and if you
[1:29:31] know God meet meaning of a proper child
[1:29:34] that means somewhere the pillar fire
[1:29:36] appeared because MRAM and Joseph Beth
[1:29:39] understood this child is different is
[1:29:42] that right when william branham was born
[1:29:44] the pillar of fire showed up and mom and
[1:29:47] daddy though they were not educated
[1:29:49] understood one thing
[1:29:50] this child is different see whenever God
[1:29:55] brings our prophet he brings a pill
[1:29:57] fire hallelujah but you got to
[1:30:01] understand the pillar of fire is the
[1:30:03] expression of God for the brandman
[1:30:06] succession of the Prophet who followed
[1:30:08] the pillar of fire oh come on you're
[1:30:11] home
[1:30:11] y'all get quiet when I talk like that
[1:30:13] but I'm trying to get you to a place
[1:30:15] where you can see Jesus only that's what
[1:30:19] he taught us he said I can't do nothing
[1:30:23] except God reveals it to me so we
[1:30:27] understand that what happened and what
[1:30:28] did Moses do the first thing Moses did
[1:30:31] he took his first pool and shook Egypt
[1:30:37] he did it just like I was there with the
[1:30:41] healing campaign what did he do he come
[1:30:45] right down to Egypt and he shook Egypt
[1:30:48] shook up Pharaoh Pharaoh started ahaha
[1:30:51] we you know some magician trick or God
[1:30:53] says okay if that's what you think it is
[1:30:55] you wait here just a moment till I show
[1:30:57] you what I got
[1:30:59] what happened the contest was on
[1:31:04] intellectualism versus the power of God
[1:31:08] hallelujah come on somebody and he was
[1:31:12] Pharaoh was the top top top sheet the
[1:31:15] chief of intellectualism hallelujah he
[1:31:19] knew what he had y'all can understand
[1:31:21] Egypt had lasted thousands of years and
[1:31:24] nobody could break it hallelujah and God
[1:31:28] took her a one-man army by the name of
[1:31:32] Moses and all Moses had to do was to be
[1:31:36] obedient to the voice that he met in the
[1:31:39] pillars of the pillar fire and that
[1:31:42] burning bush hallelujah you see them
[1:31:45] saying that's what makes us more than
[1:31:48] conquerors when we can hear the voice of
[1:31:50] the pillar fire hallelujah came and God
[1:31:57] bring the pillar fire because you had
[1:31:59] all Roberts Tommy Hicks Billy Graham and
[1:32:03] not one of them as a pillar of fire
[1:32:08] above his head why because
[1:32:11] was the profit of the day now I'm gonna
[1:32:15] go ahead and could say a few things in
[1:32:16] just a moment remember I told you the
[1:32:19] test data and the testament there's two
[1:32:21] things you see because you got to
[1:32:23] realize that Moses had to go off the
[1:32:25] scene in order for Joshua's ministry to
[1:32:28] operate now because when Moses was there
[1:32:33] they depended ELO's it but Joshua
[1:32:37] represents the Holy Ghost hallelujah
[1:32:41] they cross the ranch the Jordan without
[1:32:44] Moses you understand me why because God
[1:32:50] had turned the corner now Joshua was in
[1:32:53] Commission is that right hey it's just
[1:32:59] like what Moses did when Moses came you
[1:33:02] know what he did he gave them let's put
[1:33:06] it this way
[1:33:06] a testament let's say it was a new
[1:33:09] testament to them but to us is the Old
[1:33:12] Testament because when Moses began to
[1:33:16] resent the word to them this is all hold
[1:33:19] up you know we Abraham and you know all
[1:33:22] of them that ours but what is Moses
[1:33:26] whenever God deals with the property not
[1:33:29] only does he give them you know the
[1:33:31] pillar fire he takes him up on a
[1:33:33] mountain and he praises them in a
[1:33:36] position that is his ultimate it's like
[1:33:39] mouth to ear if to hear to live how you
[1:33:41] want to put it but it's that man and God
[1:33:43] alone and he came back and he says now
[1:33:48] God has given me a word it ain't just
[1:33:51] about being circumcision circumcise now
[1:33:53] you got laws that you must obey is that
[1:33:58] right they always come back with a word
[1:34:03] the first Exodus was like that right now
[1:34:08] watch this because when Moses went off
[1:34:10] the scene now Joshua had to take the
[1:34:13] people all the way which was the Holy
[1:34:16] Spirit right and in Joshua's ministry
[1:34:20] that's when Caleb and Joshua received
[1:34:23] their Mountain
[1:34:24] right so we come along he said let me
[1:34:27] hurry up because I'm just giving you
[1:34:28] this is I'm gonna be working on this for
[1:34:30] some time so we come to this and here
[1:34:34] come Jesus the god prophet let's go to
[1:34:37] the second exit out I can expound on a
[1:34:39] little bit more but let's move on we got
[1:34:42] the second Exodus now what was the
[1:34:44] second Exodus God calling them out of
[1:34:48] laws and traditions the traditions of
[1:34:52] men is that right
[1:34:53] Jesus it is the tradition of men that
[1:34:55] kills the effect of the word they had
[1:34:59] and is so much doubt to what Moses had
[1:35:02] said to there was no effect but remember
[1:35:06] it took Joshua let's go back it took
[1:35:10] Joshua to have faith in what Moses said
[1:35:13] in order to cross over the Jordan now
[1:35:17] here come Jesus and he's coming with the
[1:35:19] Testament is that right he's a prophet
[1:35:22] he's the God prophet and Jesus said unto
[1:35:25] those Pharisees and Sadducees except you
[1:35:27] believe that I am he you should likewise
[1:35:29] die in your sins Moses could have said
[1:35:31] it hey Shep you believe that I am he you
[1:35:33] should likewise die in your sin brother
[1:35:35] Branham could say that whoa somebody
[1:35:38] help me except you believe that I am he
[1:35:41] you will likewise die in your sins
[1:35:43] my it wasn't a man preaching it was God
[1:35:46] preaching he can't change and the first
[1:35:53] thing Jesus did when he came up he went
[1:35:56] right there to the heart of the law
[1:35:58] right into the synagogue and he shook
[1:36:01] him up a twelve-year-old boy
[1:36:03] knowing all this where did you go to
[1:36:05] school huh immediately his fame went out
[1:36:12] is that right remember even the first
[1:36:15] miracle when he turned the water into
[1:36:17] wine you got to understand this was God
[1:36:19] prophet this was a prophet amen that was
[1:36:22] going to have to give his life to
[1:36:24] restore back what the first Adam lost
[1:36:28] hallelujah because this is not a natural
[1:36:30] Moses brought him from a natural land
[1:36:33] into a natural aid but now we got a
[1:36:35] spiritual God a quickening
[1:36:37] bringing us into a new land which we
[1:36:40] call the Holy Ghost and this is why
[1:36:42] brother Brennan said the Holy Ghost is
[1:36:44] not representative of heaven the Holy
[1:36:46] Ghost represents Canaan because when you
[1:36:49] get the Holy Ghost
[1:36:50] you got battle after battle after battle
[1:36:52] but God has already said I've given you
[1:36:56] the land well how will you put your feet
[1:36:59] that you possess it is y'all hallelujah
[1:37:04] so we come and we come to this place by
[1:37:07] God's grace that Jesus come any and he's
[1:37:09] and he's got a Testament with it this
[1:37:13] man don't speak like all the others he
[1:37:16] speak with some authority hallelujah
[1:37:19] hallelujah when Jesus said you know
[1:37:23] disciple said you know where do you get
[1:37:25] your authority he said I tell you what
[1:37:27] tell me who John the Baptist was I love
[1:37:29] this said they got in today I love to
[1:37:34] say like this they got into their echo
[1:37:35] miracle group and the Pharisees and
[1:37:37] sassy because i'ma tell you something
[1:37:38] one thing about the devil he will fight
[1:37:42] they will fight each other until a true
[1:37:46] seed of God comes and they're saying
[1:37:49] Devils that fights each other were
[1:37:51] joined together against the real
[1:37:53] Christian hallelujah I know it's true
[1:37:58] when I when we was down there in down in
[1:38:01] Columbia South Carolina when we came out
[1:38:03] of that system and it was Baptist people
[1:38:05] Methodist people Pentecostal people you
[1:38:08] know churches who didn't even believe in
[1:38:09] women preachers got together against us
[1:38:15] they will unite hallelujah let me say it
[1:38:19] like this Ram Jesus coming you better
[1:38:23] get ready Ramses is coming Ramsey is a
[1:38:30] murderer just like his daddy let's move
[1:38:34] on so when Jesus come he shakes him up
[1:38:38] he goes and he does everything contrary
[1:38:42] to the law love like they said Jesus
[1:38:45] tell me something why is it that every
[1:38:48] time I see you and your disciples yo
[1:38:51] eating all the time they call Jesus a
[1:38:54] glutton Shepard in John's supposed to be
[1:38:58] of the same right he's of God why is it
[1:39:01] that his father was are always fasting
[1:39:06] because John rejoiced to see the
[1:39:09] bridegroom hallelujah
[1:39:12] show us our brothers what do you what do
[1:39:14] you get with this because Jesus comes
[1:39:15] along and he heals on the Sabbath day
[1:39:18] what was he doing with his own life he
[1:39:23] was writing with his old life he was
[1:39:27] showing them that that the son of man he
[1:39:30] has power over the Sabbath and they
[1:39:38] didn't like him
[1:39:40] because wherever they tried to trap him
[1:39:43] he was able to get out of it far smarter
[1:39:47] than the intellectual he was God and
[1:39:51] they hated him but they did not know
[1:39:55] that this was another Exodus they did
[1:39:59] not know that he came to destroy that
[1:40:02] organization and denomination is that
[1:40:05] right he even prophesied that one of
[1:40:08] these days something's gonna happen he
[1:40:10] said listen if you don't believe Who I
[1:40:12] am if you don't listen to my message I'm
[1:40:14] sending a man by the name of Titus and
[1:40:18] he's going to destroy this city he's
[1:40:21] going to destroy this temple and
[1:40:23] everything else with it
[1:40:24] why because you missed your visitation
[1:40:27] you miss your day of visitation in
[1:40:30] America and the whole world has missed
[1:40:33] their visitation God came down is that
[1:40:38] right
[1:40:39] look at look at Exodus God says I'm
[1:40:42] coming down and when it came down where
[1:40:45] was he in Moses so God amen came down in
[1:40:50] them in the image of a man that's how he
[1:40:53] does it when he walked in the cool of
[1:40:57] the evening he was in the image of a man
[1:41:00] hallelujah when he talked to the voice I
[1:41:03] mean to the burning
[1:41:05] the voice of a man why because this
[1:41:08] Bible represents a man and they want to
[1:41:10] change it to a woman it can never be
[1:41:12] because this Bible is see no woman don't
[1:41:20] have seen hallelujah these people are so
[1:41:25] insane hallelujah is that right and
[1:41:30] remember it was always the pillar fire
[1:41:33] that was who leads right the pillar fire
[1:41:37] led the children of Israel out of Egypt
[1:41:41] by night I like that
[1:41:44] it's nice but we're getting ready to
[1:41:47] break into a day and you got to look
[1:41:51] what happened amen when the pillar fire
[1:41:55] when Joshua crossed over
[1:41:56] they said the pillar fire disappeared it
[1:41:58] never disappears you just can't see it
[1:42:03] but God never leaves he was there in
[1:42:07] Joshua Oh somebody help me here you said
[1:42:12] well I don't see the pillar fire you
[1:42:13] need to see him in you that's where he's
[1:42:18] coming he's come to live in you Feast of
[1:42:22] Tabernacles amen somebody need to
[1:42:23] understand that this thing is shattering
[1:42:26] time has now come to its place where the
[1:42:29] shower is disappearing and the reality
[1:42:31] is becoming you and me hallelujah it's
[1:42:40] been proven okay let's get what he says
[1:42:45] the second date said he brought a
[1:42:47] prophet unknown which was the son of God
[1:42:49] prophet Moses said he was a prophet he
[1:42:52] would be a prophet and had a pillar of
[1:42:54] fire and done signs and wonders and that
[1:42:57] same prophet said whosoever believeth in
[1:42:58] me the works that I do shall he do also
[1:43:01] and here he promised the same thing in
[1:43:04] the Exodus in the last days he cannot
[1:43:07] change it and by scientific proof by the
[1:43:10] witness of the spirit by the works of
[1:43:12] the Spirit as we see it today the great
[1:43:14] pillar of fire is moving among us with
[1:43:18] signs and
[1:43:18] wonders of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:43:20] Christ calling the people from
[1:43:22] denominationalism into the presence of
[1:43:24] Jesus Christ to live going to a land let
[1:43:30] me stop it right there
[1:43:31] because remember the pilla fire had
[1:43:33] always been tall talked about by William
[1:43:36] Branham when he said that was that like
[1:43:38] that like that like that like and I
[1:43:40] think it was a down in Texas right when
[1:43:43] when they had the big argument in the
[1:43:44] pillar of fire come down and they took
[1:43:46] the picture right that's when that man
[1:43:48] told brother Bosworth I'm gonna put my
[1:43:50] fish and I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna
[1:43:51] do that brother and saying he took six
[1:43:53] pictures and none of them came out but
[1:43:55] that's seventy something about the
[1:43:57] number seven but that 71 is when the
[1:44:00] pillar of fire was shown above the bank
[1:44:02] man's head he came into the audience you
[1:44:03] understand that so that I got those
[1:44:07] stories right this is but anyway you got
[1:44:09] to understand that when the pillar of
[1:44:12] fire comes and he had identifies you you
[1:44:16] are who you are fire moving among us in
[1:44:21] the signs and the wonders the
[1:44:22] resurrection
[1:44:23] so therefore the pillar fire was here
[1:44:24] even though everybody couldn't see it we
[1:44:27] could only see the effects hallelujah
[1:44:29] how many times you I know myself I felt
[1:44:32] the power of God come over me in my hair
[1:44:34] just stand up and you know I feel the
[1:44:36] strange feeling like he described come
[1:44:38] over me that is the pillar of fire
[1:44:42] hallelujah let me move on there is no
[1:44:45] mistake friends it's not what I'm saying
[1:44:48] I'm just your brother but it was God
[1:44:50] who's proving to you
[1:44:51] what makes it's the truth same pillar
[1:44:54] fire he used for that for the other two
[1:44:57] he's brought it among you today and
[1:45:00] prove it by scientific as you know Life
[1:45:03] magazine package is that right so you
[1:45:05] understand that this wasn't done in the
[1:45:07] closet somewhere if you wouldn't even go
[1:45:09] to Washington DC they got it up there in
[1:45:11] their library Library of Congress I
[1:45:13] believe but you know you can't hide the
[1:45:16] truth whether there's a picture up there
[1:45:19] or not I know he's in me so we know that
[1:45:22] we're not coming the reason why amen
[1:45:24] we've got a sure word of prophecy you
[1:45:28] understand me
[1:45:29] it has been proven
[1:45:32] by God in this last day hallelujah
[1:45:36] people raised from the dead eyes of the
[1:45:39] blind crippled walking dead raised in
[1:45:42] stir truth
[1:45:43] no man can do that except God be with
[1:45:46] him hallelujah what is it that mighty
[1:45:50] angels that stood there on the land in
[1:45:52] the sea is now standing in the believer
[1:45:55] conquering death the land and the sea
[1:45:59] where ever devil the devil try to place
[1:46:02] us it doesn't matter let me hurry up
[1:46:04] said it was gonna be long this is the
[1:46:06] time he said what this is the entire the
[1:46:09] Bible says as it was in the days of
[1:46:11] Sodom as it was in the days of Noah we
[1:46:13] can see these things happening now you
[1:46:15] and I must understand we must exchange
[1:46:18] how are we gonna take skin see because
[1:46:22] when we we're already in the land of the
[1:46:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost but now we've
[1:46:26] got to go somewhere else and the only
[1:46:28] way we can get there is that we must
[1:46:30] have a change of body that land that
[1:46:34] we're going to it's a land that once
[1:46:37] Adam had he had a theophany and I don't
[1:46:43] know what all it was but all I know is
[1:46:45] that God will pack us with a theophany
[1:46:47] and a glorious high and the land this is
[1:46:52] eternal that's what time will be no more
[1:46:54] we're no longer in the seventh church
[1:46:57] age we are in the eighth day the a
[1:47:00] church age is that right him saying no
[1:47:03] such thing it is cuz the prophet said so
[1:47:07] hallelujah he said so this is what we
[1:47:11] call the bride age and the bride age has
[1:47:15] no time we have now entered into
[1:47:19] eternity by the power in the Spirit of
[1:47:23] God so when the devil tell you you're
[1:47:25] not going to make him tell he's a liar
[1:47:28] hallelujah I heard the voice of Jesus
[1:47:32] say come on to me and rest all ye that
[1:47:36] labor and heavy Lane
[1:47:37] and I'll give you rest take my yoke upon
[1:47:41] you and learn of me hallelujah for my
[1:47:44] yoke is easy and my burden is light we
[1:47:48] don't have to worry about it
[1:47:49] the mighty Conqueror has already
[1:47:51] conquered hallelujah he made sure you
[1:47:55] made it when he gave you the seed before
[1:47:57] the foundation of the world he may put
[1:48:00] that seed in you and that seed of God
[1:48:03] will conquer anything and everything
[1:48:08] yes we're different and we can't help
[1:48:10] but be different hallelujah we we see
[1:48:15] this thing is or what brother was there
[1:48:17] so many people you know let me tell you
[1:48:19] something when it comes to this message
[1:48:21] you don't have to you don't have to
[1:48:23] scientific fire anything and we find
[1:48:27] people you know it's all right to have a
[1:48:29] little diagram but everybody want to
[1:48:31] have diagrams let me ask you something
[1:48:33] else when you got the Holy Ghost
[1:48:35] explaining it to me not one of you can
[1:48:38] explain it because it's unexplainable
[1:48:42] when you get the whole ego oh I shouted
[1:48:44] that dance but that doesn't tell me
[1:48:46] nothing a lot of people shouting dance
[1:48:48] and ain't got it oh there's so much joy
[1:48:51] let me tell you something when the real
[1:48:53] Holy Ghost come you know what happens to
[1:48:55] you you change don't even know how you
[1:48:59] change but you change those old desires
[1:49:02] are no longer damned you change you have
[1:49:05] a mind
[1:49:06] battle because that's where God put the
[1:49:07] battle in the mind but in the heart you
[1:49:10] are Christian and you know your
[1:49:12] Christian panting they explain it it
[1:49:17] can't even explain it but it's real it's
[1:49:20] real there was a time we groped in
[1:49:22] darkness we're not groping in darkness
[1:49:23] anymore
[1:49:24] hallelujah look what he says in the
[1:49:26] third Exodus and today God has called as
[1:49:30] his elected the spiritual seed of
[1:49:33] Abraham by the faith that he had in the
[1:49:36] Word of God don't you see the spiritual
[1:49:38] see today that don't see the
[1:49:41] intellectual church it sees the word and
[1:49:44] it's being called from those big
[1:49:46] denominations into the presence of Jesus
[1:49:48] Christ was that clear
[1:49:51] did you get it so let me go back to
[1:49:54] Jesus I have you have understood Mr D it
[1:49:57] was Jesus who was God in the flesh he
[1:49:59] says listen it's better for me to go
[1:50:01] away because if I go away the comforter
[1:50:05] will come because I the Testament can't
[1:50:10] be written it can't be done the power of
[1:50:12] the blood can't be seen for the believer
[1:50:15] until I go I got to go so that comforter
[1:50:19] would come down and he'll come down and
[1:50:21] be in you
[1:50:22] he's the blood he's alive he's one I'm
[1:50:25] working with but I've got to die so that
[1:50:28] you can live is that right Moses had to
[1:50:31] move off the sea so Joshua hallelujah
[1:50:35] William Branham who was our prophet he
[1:50:37] had to move off the scene so we could
[1:50:39] see the movement of the thunders I know
[1:50:46] people don't want to accept that but you
[1:50:48] must understand that God is moving and
[1:50:51] he's moving in a way if you don't get it
[1:50:53] you gotta get it if you truly chosen
[1:50:57] if you truly chosen of God you'll see
[1:50:59] that this move is on the bride and God
[1:51:02] didn't tell you nothing he's like he
[1:51:04] gave you order without telling you what
[1:51:06] the orders were but the orders is in the
[1:51:09] thunders is in the C O God is in Christ
[1:51:13] is in you is that right every time he
[1:51:22] went up to the mountain Moses went up
[1:51:24] there and it thunders when God told him
[1:51:28] to write the Ten Commandment it was
[1:51:31] thundering when Jesus was trying to
[1:51:34] teach it all of a sudden Thunder and
[1:51:36] Jesus said now this voice did not come
[1:51:38] because of me it came from you some
[1:51:41] people said it was a thunder and some
[1:51:43] people said it was an angel hallelujah
[1:51:45] and here's the prophet of God said I
[1:51:47] seen this angel this angel talked to me
[1:51:49] many times but one day that ninety AIDS
[1:51:52] and that angel came and he was a big man
[1:51:55] white robe hallelujah dark complected no
[1:52:00] shoes on his feet
[1:52:01] hallelujah he said I have come from the
[1:52:04] presence of
[1:52:05] to tell you of your gift in what God has
[1:52:08] called you to do
[1:52:09] hallelujah he wasn't the only one here's
[1:52:12] a witch she called herself an astrologer
[1:52:15] hey you I want to talk to you brother
[1:52:20] Branham was still hot-tempered he did
[1:52:23] not want to talk to this lady because
[1:52:25] first of all he did not trust women in
[1:52:28] that sense she said you know you've been
[1:52:31] born under special sign he said I don't
[1:52:34] want to hear it I don't know nothing
[1:52:36] about it
[1:52:37] and she kept working with and working
[1:52:40] with say she said to him but if you
[1:52:42] would receive it and submit to it that
[1:52:45] gift would shake the world you know what
[1:52:49] she's also said you were born on the
[1:52:52] same day Jesus was born and God gave you
[1:52:56] your birth on that day as a memorial now
[1:52:59] y'all crazy as all get-out hallelujah
[1:53:03] but I believe it he was not born in
[1:53:06] December he was born in April that's
[1:53:10] when all the Lambs are born you see how
[1:53:12] the denomination organizations have lied
[1:53:14] to you they've lied so much to you they
[1:53:16] got the three wise men at the birth of
[1:53:18] Jesus they didn't get there two two and
[1:53:20] a half years later that's your Bible and
[1:53:23] if they lied there where else are they
[1:53:26] lying but you believe it cuz that's what
[1:53:29] you've been taught hallelujah but God is
[1:53:33] trying to unteach you that was Jesus hmm
[1:53:42] you love the Lord we're at the end
[1:53:45] people we're at the end and you and I
[1:53:49] must understand Amen that God says you
[1:53:51] know God is look what he said in 2nd
[1:53:53] Peter 3:18 8 through 13 now I'm a close
[1:53:55] in just a moment he said but beloved be
[1:53:57] not ignorant of the one thing that one
[1:53:59] day is with the Lord as a thousand years
[1:54:01] and a thousand years is one day the Lord
[1:54:03] is not slack concerning his promise as
[1:54:05] some men count slackness but is
[1:54:07] long-suffering to us-ward not willing
[1:54:09] that any should perish but that all
[1:54:11] should come to repentance now it's so
[1:54:13] amazing because we understand and it's
[1:54:16] the truth do you know that the real
[1:54:18] Catholic Church
[1:54:18] they was used to be a Pentecostal church
[1:54:21] when they first started out you know
[1:54:23] what they threw away the word and they
[1:54:26] built the church on dogmas increase look
[1:54:28] at them now what ain't both powerful do
[1:54:31] you understand your history the millions
[1:54:34] of people they've killed
[1:54:35] the crusade when they made people
[1:54:38] worship oh come on somebody that's not
[1:54:41] Jesus he said whosoever will let him
[1:54:44] come and you better believe mama getting
[1:54:48] ready to do her thing again
[1:54:49] she's getting ready to bail America out
[1:54:52] we will become her slave and you know
[1:54:55] what every true Christian will be
[1:54:56] persecuted why is it that way cuz Ramses
[1:55:02] is moving at the same time that God is
[1:55:06] preparing a bride for a rapture the
[1:55:10] Bible says as soon as a child was
[1:55:11] delivered don't you worry
[1:55:13] the child will be delivered God is gonna
[1:55:17] bring forth Christ in you but as soon as
[1:55:20] it happened that's when the squeeze
[1:55:22] gonna come down hallelujah and we'll be
[1:55:26] taken up for three and a half years
[1:55:30] hallelujah the Jews would then have
[1:55:33] their revival for three and a half years
[1:55:35] but why they having their revival we'll
[1:55:37] be sitting at the Welcome Table come on
[1:55:42] somebody now I want you to understand
[1:55:44] Ramsey's ain't playing he's out to kill
[1:55:48] you
[1:55:49] hallelujah but he came
[1:55:52] we've been predestinated we've been
[1:55:56] chosen hallelujah amen and what has God
[1:56:01] done when he came back he says eat the
[1:56:03] book that's why I tell you eat just look
[1:56:06] here your message study your message
[1:56:09] read your message pray hallelujah that
[1:56:12] the authority of the word will not just

[1:56:16] right down the outers of your heart
[1:56:19] hallelujah so when the devil comes in
[1:56:21] like a flood he God will lift up a
[1:56:23] standard you're the standard hallelujah

[1:56:55] seen so many beautiful women in your
[1:56:58] life that's a sign of the end time
[1:57:05] lawlessness we never thought it would be
[1:57:08] lawlessness in America but it's here
[1:57:12] people can do whatever they want to do
[1:57:15] but don't you worry

[1:57:19] push that button
[1:57:22] yeah they don't understand this thing is

[1:57:46] happens the power of Satan will into
[1:57:49] everybody in that church just like the
[1:57:53] power of God is gonna enter every
[1:57:55] believer he will give birth to his
[1:57:59] tracks as God gave birth to her his
[1:58:01] church hallelujah you said that ain't
[1:58:04] yes that's how that's how Babel was

[1:58:24] who was there they didn't wake up into
[1:58:28] the ardent that the thing was over
[1:58:29] hidden he realized they had done certain
[1:58:32] things they were spellbound
[1:58:35] demonic possession and the same thing is
[1:58:39] coming again they're all it's already a
[1:58:43] lot of people you just go against their
[1:58:46] doctrine

[1:59:17] enclosing don't you understand where we
[1:59:19] standing there were three walls in the
[1:59:22] Bible the first wall was World War 1 the
[1:59:25] second Woolf is World War 2 3 whoa
[1:59:29] there's a World War 3 coming out right
