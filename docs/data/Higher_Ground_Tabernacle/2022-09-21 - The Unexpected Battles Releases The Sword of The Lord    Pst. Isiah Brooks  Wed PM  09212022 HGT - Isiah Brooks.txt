into the word of god you know i don't know i guess sometimes we forget who our adversary is and we fail to see that we are a walking target throughout the day satan knows who we are even if we don't know who we are he's been fighting christians for thousands of years now he's seeing strengths and evol he's also seen weaknesses but i don't think he fully understand grace why would an enemy waste his time time trying to destroy something that he's not capable of destroying i thank god for calvary i thank for the mercy i thank god for the mercy and the grace of god god has been so good to us we're just going to ask as we stand for you to turn to us turn with us excuse me to ephesians the 6th chapter we're going to read the 12th verse a little short verse there you know where paul is encouraging all of us to put on the whole arm of god uh i'm i'm ministering this uh thought tonight only because i realized that something's moving in the dark and we can't exactly see exactly what it is but something is coming and you know god gave me basically three witnesses today and i'll talk about those witnesses in just a moment ephesians 6 12 for we are also not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places let us pray heavenly father we come before you lord jesus and we thank you god for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us lord we pray tonight that you forgive us and cleanse us from anything that will hinder the move of your holy spirit lord we know father god that we're not perfect within ourselves but our perfection comes from you we have no ounce of righteousness of ourselves but our righteousness come from you lord who we are and remember god our father that you cannot you're the only one that can make us worthy because you're the only one that is worthy father i pray that you bless the service in a special way i love you lord and i do believe in trust that you're going to get us to the place just as the word is spoken is prophesied of what we should be i'm trusting we're trusting in you and in your word in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen you may be seeded missing brother rich i don't know what what is going on there but you know that's how it is i know how faithful he is and and before i forget i want to remind i need to be reminded that those curtains need to be dealt with they're leaning i walked in here the other day and i look back i'm like what in the world this whole house that i'm living here god is good to us the unexpected battles some battles you can prepare for you know they become visible you know we can see how uh our world is going now and and i'm sure they're trying to decide who's going to push the button first that's how serious things are but we as christians we we must be prepared at all times and how do we get prepared the only solution to our problem is jesus christ having god behind the veil because he is our battle axe he is the one who fights for us but one of the things that really prompted me to to uh minister this message uh really because of the message our brother willie preach on light light is something else it's nothing like being in darkness and maybe some people here has never had the experience of your lights getting cut off well when i was a child that did happen and then you find yourself walking around the house with little candles trying to find your way through because it's so dark see back in the day we didn't have the kind of lighting street lights that we have now when darkness came it was dark and so i was thinking about all of the darkness that we're now facing and you and i must understand that this darkness cannot be seen most of the time with the natural eye it is a supernatural condition it is a condition of the mind it's a condition of the spirit and only the invisible god can direct us i'm so glad that david said that the lord is my light he's my lamp into my feet and the light into my pathway he is the only one that can direct me through this darkness you and i are living in a we're living in a time that you know the people are calling good evil and evil good and for ages satan has tried to put out the light of god even from the beginning of time i would say the beginning when god created man he put adam and eve and of course you know how the enemy came but satan came in in an unexpected way you know the lord told uh adam and eve don't don't don't touch nor taste and i i don't know basically uh what they were thinking when god spoke those words because we are in reality to understand what god said to him in order to dim the order that he had given had to come by way of a revelation who knows i could have been in a natural way thinking about an apple or orange or pear but you see this understanding only came by revelation god enlightening adam and eve and therefore enlightening able what he meant what what what what god is requiring but when battles come unexpected we want god to take control and i i i thought of a subject the unexpected battles releases the sword of the lord you and i we're coming through a time that we must understand that this is uh this is no joke and all of us must be more serious we must understand amen that god is calling for perfect faith and most of us perhaps don't know what that is but i'll tell you distinctly what it is perfect faith is jesus christ and this is why the bible says that the just shall live by his faith and in order to have his faith to live by he must live in you this perfect faith must live in you because perfect faith can handle all circumstances perfect faith can change all conditions perfect faith amen literally can control uh the atmosphere it controls events it stops the what-ifs you know what i'm saying because uh as my brother richard told me he said god is the god of everything and he is even the god of what ifs i thank god for being the god of was if because i'm glad i didn't have to live or what if and he used the scenario and he said now what if hitler never came what if there was never hitler then the world at large would be different we have no idea what it would be like but there were certain men whether sinner or saint god placed in this world to fulfill his purpose we we we look at the religious persecution of old but had not there been a religious persecution america would have never been discovered more than likely that's that's still a what yeah but you see god amen in his own mind understood that this country had to be established because john the revelator as they called him the revelator is really christ but john had written of this particular nation in the 13th chapter of revelation the lamb the little animal that came up like a lamb and began to speak like a dragon that's america 13 stars 13 states 13 stripes and 13 is the number of a woman and as you come into america amen you see who a woman new york the statue of liberty this is why the woman this is a woman's nation and you and i must recognize that because it is no offense to our sisters it cannot stand branham said this in the message mechazodec if we approach this subject today real sensibly calmly never be excited faith never gets excited faith never rushes itself faith knows what it is talking about you never seen our master excited about anything standing by the grave of a dead man he was just as calm as he was when he would sit on the mount and look over jerusalem standing on the trouble on a ship in the troubled seas the waves tossed about he was so completely rested in god until it never he never uh even paid any attention to it enough to wake up always undisturbed faith now we find here that the reason that we can be undisturbed because it was given to our father abraham and his children so if god has given us undisturbed faith undisturbed faith is our inheritance we we it's what we can possess because it has been given to us and god who gave the promise swore by an oath that he would confirm it and keep it and that he and that he has done he didn't say will do that he has done so i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm going this way so that you can understand that a lot of times people think that we're not in a battle but just like our brother uh uh uh uh said smiley said the other day he said we're already in a squeeze it's just that the squeeze in itself has not yet been intensified we were talking uh brother keith and i and sister joy and we were talking this earlier today about uh how things do happen sometimes you know we we they catch us seemingly uh off guard incidents and if we're not careful we will react to the incident but god wants us to be undisturbed i mean that's the way it was when mary and martha came to jesus all lazarus is sick you know jesus didn't stop biting his nails like lord what must i do it almost seemed like he was insensitive to what was really going on but really in reality he was so into god there was no worry amen and the reason why he understood who the father was don't you understand god creator is the creator of all things and nothing is out of cater we've got all of these fallen angels all of these wicked is coming against us but god has already reassured us that our names have been written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world you know we we work and we we we seek god because we we really want to hear a well done but the well done has already been spoken and we want to because we really remember in this day and time it's not our righteousness this is not a message of law this is a message of grace unmerited favor that god has given to us hallelujah by way of election when we talk about spiritual warfare it almost seems so unfair that we have to fight something that we cannot see but in reality if we fully come to understand it it's not you that's doing the battle or the fighting it's god in you this is why we need the holy ghost you cannot fight satan he is a he is a warrior of all warriors and if he calls a third of the heavens to fall where do you think you stand without the grace of god this warfare is an engagement in an activity it's a conflict between good and evil hallelujah while good knows how to speak the word because the word is god evil knows how to cast spells because you got to remember amen the thing that lucifer did with with eve had to have had to capture her in a in a spell because how can you be with god and all of a sudden you can't remember or understand what he told you not to do and then you reason within yourself to think that what you're doing wrong is right it had to be a spell it had to be something that lucifer did in the mind and this is why amen you know the bible tells us that witchcraft is like stubbornness is like witchcraft saul saul was bewitched and it was the people that bewitched him he was more concerned about what they thought about him then then he was concerned about what god thought about him and god told him kill everything animal king you name it kill it all but the devil came with this reasoning y'all better hear what i'm saying because the word of god is your stabilizer if you allow satan to cause you to reason away from it you and you are now a victim of witchcraft you are a victim of of satan casting a spell on you your light has become darkness you understand me and people think well there ain't no such thing as witches you better wake up and smell the coffee witches are just as real as children of god who has the holy ghost there's always a negative and a positive y'all understand me sometimes we undergo things in our lives and we don't even understand it but somebody it's a possibility that somebody is trying to be with you so how many times you felt funny you don't know why you're feeling funny and you don't feel like praying no there's something working in the spiritual realm and your holy ghost is trying to make you aware of something it's not like don't don't don't cast these things off well i'm feeling strange no there's a reason why you're feeling strange those those uh senses that god has given us has been given to us to protect us listen saul was so messed up a real king of god until he went to the witch of endor don't tell me it ain't real and even in that day when all the witches have been put out of israel saul the king went to the king which you're in to follow me through this now because i want you to understand what we're battling now it's it's it's it's a spirit of witchcraft and when i say that i mean the whole world y'all understand me i'm gonna get to something in just a moment if you realize let me stop and let me say it now before i forget it when a nation is conquered by another nation what did they do they take that nation flag down and they put their flag up hello so when they put the rainbow colors or the flags on the white house they were saying this is our nation now hello somebody what were they doing they were literally casting a spell on america and we let it happen that's why everybody is going crazy y'all hear what i'm saying you see stuff you've never seen before since then and it's only going to get worse because instead of men and women want to be men and women they want to be things it's real it's real this is why we must stay prayed up my wife we are witnesses of this thing we went to a church where somebody gave us clothing we were in virginia riding home my my my my trunk of the car had been smashed there was no way to open it we're going down the road all of a sudden the wind came through and blew that trunk open and the clothes in which somebody gave us were older but we were just being nice we took the clothes thinking that maybe we could savage it let's go through it but the thing about it there was such a wind and not none of those clothing fell out of the car that night when we got home i had to go to work and my wife had an experience that was really horrifying i'm not going to go through all of that but we later on she later on had someone to pray they prayed over that did y'all burn the clothes i think no threw them away whatever they did with them anyway we found out that the enemy she saw some things after we got rid of the clothes she saw things coming going outside of the house now you can believe that or you don't you don't have to but what i'm trying to say is you're not exempt because you're in the bride don't think you're not going to be challenged hallelujah is that right and what happened to saul because he called up samuel god judged him and saul lost his life right so you got to understand you can't play with that kind of stuff you say what brothers what are you saying i'm trying to tell you that these kinds of people they work harder in their field to be that than what we work harder than to be bride they work on it they come together with it they meet each other and the whole time and then we've been seeing that the bible tells us amen that this whole age is is it has been affected by jezebel and her religion and you talk about bear worshiping all of these things that we holidays and things we celebrate and listen you don't even know that you've been spellbound you've been captured amen by witchcraft thinking it's it's the word of god it's the truth israel didn't know they were under the uh uh spirit of of witchcraft until elijah came and when elijah came because remember the word baal also means lord and that that mount uh uh uh with the carmel showdown was all about the word that versus the devil good against evil amen yeah you hear you hear what i'm saying guess what and these both good and evil represented two churches two churches and they all were israelites meaning they were of the same body of people but on one side one was worshiping the true god that was on the side of elijah and the other one amen worship on the side of jezebel y'all better hear what i'm saying and it was a spiritual thing going on and elijah made fun of them because of their worship they didn't know how to contact their god he said call on him cut yourself maybe he's asleep somewhere but they both had seven altars seven rams they they looked so much alike they were twins when it comes to worship but one was true and the other one was false guess what happened god vindicated see that's why people or you this is what drives me because so many people in the message don't you understand we need holy ghost and fire amen when elijah said let the god that answered fire let him be god those words still holds today let the god get answered by fire let him be god it ain't your religion god must vindicate you to be right and he does it by answering by fire fire the holy ghost hallelujah remember it was in calgary canada there's a a guy who could cast spells and in the in the audience he was making he was traveling different places making people bark like dogs think about what they were doing up there in canada when they was having that revival and people were traveling all the way up to canada to have this revival and they were all coming out barking like dogs i had a friend and laughed about it thought it was laughing barking like dogs and they thought that was the holy ghost you see what i'm saying she is already in the framework of the church and people don't even recognize it because they don't have the word for today the word of today is our light it is our enlightenment it has uncovered the devil's scheme and therefore we can see what he's doing this is what brother adam said for unbeliever to set among people whose believers when when demons he said we talk on this afternoon they actually are beings that get loose among people here some time ago at calgary canada it become visible many times of seeing they look something like a big spider like a big like a black shadow right my granddaughter had such a terrible dream the other day it really stirred up and when she woke up she said she saw a spider crawling across the wall running rather demonic power she couldn't move she couldn't get up but then when she did get up this is what she saw what is that you understand me my point is this people of god we are fighting against spiritual wickedness in high places and they know you you think they don't know you they know you they know your faith they know what you believe there is no secrets with the government why because you don't told them everything all on your phone whatever you ought to even know your ice cream many times in the season they sometimes like big spiders like a big black shadow right i seen one one time from an epilepsy look like a tortoise with long legs that come down and whirled up like a like that floating around there in calvary canada with 20 something odd thousand people there and every one of them watched that now why am i saying that because we'll watch that fourth dimension we'll watch that tv or we'll watch that program and we'll watch demonic spirits and powers and oh we fear is fictitious and we don't understand that the whole time satan is casting spells on you all you got to understand is the word entertainment enter and once you enter satan can do what he wants to do with you we're all sitting right here where god has had mercy on us and has spared us especially when we've looked at things we know we should not have god be merciful i heard a testimony of a person said one time she was looking at this i don't i don't know the show thing it was a movie where where four girls became witches they were witches and all that she said just watching that she had the thought i wouldn't mind being a witch and what was it is that she they were able to control their enemies you understand me but what people don't understand is the end result it's the end result of this the end result because when people indulge in those things they don't understand they're getting the short end of the stick satan got something for you hallelujah now i'll move on because i've said what i want to say here and he went on and then some time ago a bunch of boys wanted to play a trick on me you heard them them hip hypnotizers goals these uh army camps and make somebody bark like a dog and so forth one of them said in the meeting so just acting smart several thousand people was there and i i kept feeling a funny spirit you hear me a funny spirit i washed around to i caught the man who it was now if you guys are spiritual you could be sitting in a restaurant and a witch will come in and you don't they won't have to tell you they're witches you have caught it already in your spirit i learned just the other day that from this point of your heart from this point to center point till out here you got an eight to seven eight to seven to eight feet circumference of a of uh uh atmosphere you know how you walk by somebody you feel that funny you know you feel that whatever that is you have an atmosphere if you have a positive atmosphere fear you're literally a man changing things around you if your atmosphere is negative you're changing things around you you said that's not message yes it is brother branham said the bride of jesus christ has the power to change the atmosphere and remember when his wife was crying and everything else he put on the apron went up there to help her and what did he do he changed the atmosphere hallelujah it's the truth you get around somebody that's negative all the time it changes the atmosphere positive person changes the atmosphere you understand me so don't tell me i know that we are connected to everything hallelujah but we must learn how to to connect with god and god alone and the only way we can do that we must sell out everything everything we think we know we have to give it to god in prayer and god will then take over for you hallelujah right brother better said when he caught the man he told him what are you doing why are you doing that and guess what happened they packed him out god paralyzed him how many times you know people try to work things against you and then when it comes my way when i feel that thing i sent it right back in the name of jesus i do see modern day churches we we don't realize it but brother branham told us is he did he not he said modern-day churches were being led by a witch spirit of witchcraft i'm telling y'all people see i know what i'm talking about i've had i've encountered these things even in north carolina even in fayetteville north carolina i've encountered these things personally i've seen it i've seen it [Applause] work people amen preachers disguising themselves as preachers and here in the dark they're working their magic oh it's true it's not just in all other nations is here in america and the thing about america she's hidden it really well brother brandon said it in the church he says now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the what church and defile it it comes into what the church this is why i fight against the starchiness of the the people because when it's starting we basically we're shedding the holy ghost out god loves fire and he said i would that you'd be hot or cold but the truth of the matter is when when lukewarm you can't attract god with lukewarmness see it's it's like the people are being bewitched because they think they can come and give god such a service and it's okay we fail to see who we're worshiping we're worshiping god hallelujah see he said what that anti-christ spirit would come into the church and defile it doing what making it lukewarm formal and powerless now tell me if that's not what we're looking at and if that be true the enemy is hiding somewhere and how does he hide he hides in people like the holy ghost hides in you the devil hides in people and they come to destroy your your worship you say brother books you don't know what you're talking about yes i do because even in south africa they were having a tent meeting and i think i told you guys this and these was baptist people i wasn't there but i got it got it a testimony from a brother brother patty and he said these beautiful women came up for prayer and this is a baptist preacher bringing an altar call and he had no idea that these women were witches and when they got close enough to him you know what they did they slit his throat is he living no not on this side but the truth of the matter is this had he known the brother in the message knew they were witches he didn't know what they were going to do but he knew they were witches you understand me so my point is this people of god you know the holy ghost you say that's not possible where paul knew witchcraft when he saw it right you could be in church and people be screaming and hollering like they got the holy ghost and the whole time is demonic power i've been a witness to that i've seen it i've seen a woman speak in tongues and was what was possessed by a devil thank god for the message well i'm coming to where i'm coming i was talking to brother simon smith i i would think he wouldn't mind i was telling him i was going to preach this message about the unexpected and while i was talking to him somebody ran into him and hit him and hit his car that happened today keith had an incident with him today you guys had an incident with you today something that would normally get you upset and that's what the devil is trying to do get you upset but god needs us to have undisturbed faith that no matter what happens i'll remain the same because the god in me and the god in you is in control oh don't worry about it you think god didn't see it it was just a test just like when that man called me and started cursing me out there at the bank a test right thank god for the test and know that god has already figured it out you know god don't have to figure it out he already know the outcome right you don't have to worry about that portion of it just glorify god thank him anyhow and you'll see that god had it all mapped out okay i'm almost ready i'm i'm coming see what it is he said satan is fighting so hard he can't stand it because he's doing everything he can do to keep you from the true revelation of who you are and your connection with god everything he's doing he's trying so hard to do it he don't want you to know that you can do the greater works he don't want you to know that you are an invincible army he don't want you to be able to identify the two spirits that works in the framework of the church they don't want you to know that but the bride of jesus christ is given to her now i'm not talking about visitors or people that come i'm talking about you know what i'm saying people that just have evil in their heart they come to church to destroy you don't think so i'm gonna tell you something if you go and look at these these pentecostal preachers that used to be big and how people sent people in in to their churches to filtrate them and to make them fall to sexual sins these things weren't coincidental if you've read enough you'll understand you've got a force that's working against the church and we know what brother branham said he said women popularity and money and satan will try a pastor or preacher with all three of those if you can overcome that you can be a successful preacher or a successful christian let me move on by the grace of god this age and i've got to get to you god this age that the lord has chosen he's chosen to bring forth a bride that can that that consists of all the church ages that were faithful to the voice of that age don't tell me that this is not the worst age ever it is i've never seen so much corruption in my life only because we have been defeated by hollywood we've been defeated they worked hard at it but they changed the minds of not only sinners but they're now changing the minds of christians things that once was wrong we now compromise and say it's all right it's not all right where is the soldier amen that's going to fight in the battle brother said we've turned a corner we're looking toward heaven watching for the coming of the lord the cap on the pyramid as we would say is coming back the church must be resurrected soon and we must be ready look what deuteronomy 20 1-2 says when thou going out to battle against thine enemy seith horses and chariots and the people more than thou be not afraid of them for the lord that god is with thee which brought thee up out of the land of egypt now why would you read the scripture i'm reading the scripture because we're now dealing with little these little these little matters that god is allowing satan to put in our way but he's expecting us to grow by them yes he's expecting us a man to move through these things as though it doesn't even matter really it doesn't when you realize amen that god has saved you and and brought you through everything and listen we know that god cannot lie every promise he promised is a yay every promise why should we be worried let me say it like this why would we be worried about something that can't defeat us you understand it cannot because god has ordained it not to be able to defeat you now you look what david did why do you think god the devil brought bathsheba and everything into david's life an unexpected battle but david didn't handle it right he allowed the battle to he he allowed that spirit to suck him into that vow to the the conflict and then he found himself amen defeated and he tried to hide it you can't hide nothing from god but it could not stop god's purpose david still remained king he had the suffer but he also got belshima and he had a solomon hallelujah all things work together for the good of them that love god so what are you saying brother brooks what i'm saying these battles that we're going through listen you and i know i know my my wife was telling me some things that she had to go through in her mind and today things were battling me in such a way that i knew something was going wrong this enemy amen was on me trying to make me angry at a brother for no apparent reason and i knew it wasn't me i knew it was the devil hello guess what i got victory but you see you got to recognize when something is not you that means it's another entity somewhere you can't see it but you can battle with it with what the sword of the lord and what is the sword of the lord the word of god hallelujah you don't have to see it god sees it and it shall be when ye come now into the battle that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people now if you go into the deuteronomy you'll find out that they were getting ready to go to battle and the priest was speaking to the people and say hey if you just got married stay home if you just had babies stay home in other words amen he was giving them excuses to stay home because we needed somebody whose minds were going to be focused on the battle see that's the problem with we who call ourselves the bride our minds are not focused on the battle we're focused on becoming rich or becoming famous or becoming building a house or a fighting a car whatever the case may be our minds are not focused listen i'm not saying anything wrong with those things but our greatest purpose that which we were born is to put the devil under our feet hallelujah that's where we hear that's why we're here our whole purpose is to show that the same jesus christ or god of the old testament is god of the new and his name is jesus christ and he lives unexpected those are the things that get to us because i love that thought of undisturbed faith brother brooks are you there yet no things still disturbs me at times but i know it's mine now right and things always come when you least expect it and it's just like a it's the truth when when david's jesse told david said listen i i i want you to go and um fetch some food to your brethren right dave didn't know he was going to get ready to fight a giant he had no idea you know just like the brothers when y'all was on your way to church you didn't know it's those things that we know when we're out of control of it it seemed to irritate us agitate us hollywood but you see god wants us to get to a place where it doesn't these things that that seem to take us by surprise we forget god ordained it because nothing can try you without coming back without coming by god's throne first hallelujah and here was david and i loved david because here was david all of a sudden found himself in a situation and david because he was so consecrated and he said i meditate on the lord day and night what you understand me his whole being was consumed by god a god who we could not even see but the anointing of god was so powerful he said he anointed my head with oil and my cup run is over you see it wasn't like a drip or drop it was overwhelmingly full he was full of the holy spirit so when he came to goliath it was like a a a mouse who had been dropped into the wine fighting a cat and he comes up out of that glass as where is that okay see that's the way it was you and i we get drunk in the spirit then then all that love that we'll have will cast out every fear every concern all of a sudden dave is seeing his whole thing change from packing a lunch to fighting a giant you understand me and david didn't run like his brothers they said is there not a cause right he didn't run from the problem he ran to the problem and i think that's where god wants us when we you know when when he's just facing the challenge god don't want us running from it he want us running to it because no devil no weapon formed against me shall prosper that's the word and when we don't understand it quote it use the sword of the lord let it go out because when the positive word comes out it changes all the molecules it changes all your surroundings hallelujah is that right yeah it's the truth god told elijah it ain't going to rain till you call for it i like that amen because even the atmosphere must obey your word when you are preaching it or releasing it amen because of the battle you're in the battle david said i want you to understand i'm in a higher order i'm not going to have to fight you with swords and spears and whatever the case may be i'm i'm bringing the sword of the lord that's how david won it was a word he spoke it you understand me with with with not only reverence excuse me respect but he knew amen somehow god has put me in this search situation and god is going to get me out right and guess what i'm coming out as a victor this goliath will not see david understood i'm a king and god has anointed me to be king and i don't care how great this giant is he cannot defeat me why because it's not my time to die but it is time to die right uh i'm gonna take your and that's amazing every time i think about it here was david coming up and and he he he had no no no sword of his own but he says listen i don't know whether he saw a vision or not but he said i'm going to take your head off and he did and he used the enemy sword to cut his head off i love it i don't know how they did it but he took that head and he paraded it from city to city that's that's just rough that's rough amen but what was he doing in the demonic realm he was showing those demons don't touch this he was showing those demons my god is the living god my god is the alpha the omega my god is jehovah my god is a creator and guess what my god is a giant killer you didn't think that he parading that thing around like that put fear in all the neighboring countries hallelujah david said this day will the lord deliver thee into my hand and i will smite thee and take thy head from thee and i will give the caucus of the host of the philistine this day until the vows of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the earth may know that there is a god in israel that's the whole point and what people don't understand when god the sword of of god become men hello because when you eat the word the word is the sword when you eat the word you become the sword of god gideon in the sword of the lord right what was he saying i'm under the inspiration of the word i am the sword i am the judge i'm bringing judgment and that's that's where the word is once it's in you you become the sword that's why when god slapped that sword in the brother brown's hand and said this is not just a sword this is the king's sword right that same sword has been given to the bride of jesus christ not just you say what it was it was an opening of the seven seals it was the word of god amen now unfolding amen to her who she is and the ability that god has placed in her from the foundation of the world oh we may look like nothing david didn't look like much either but he went down in history as a giant killer fighting against the hold of witchcraft you know and that's that's true we don't see it like that but you're like what's wrong with that child or what's wrong with him you know we don't even understand it's witchcraft these are demonic powers right and god said we have the power to trade upon serpents cast out devils in his name y'all understand me and you and i must understand and then god will reveal to us the method in which do which we do it right remember the guy who came his wife was unsaved and he rebuked her and called satan y'all remember that almost ended up in a divorce brother man say you don't do that go take us some flowers love conquers everything you you're not gonna cut gas out of stubborn spirit by rebuking it by rebuking a stubborn spirit you make it more stubborn is that right it's the truth right we know by god's grace that in every age whatever the spirit was that held those people in captivity god through the holy spirit broke it when luther came he broke that strong home right wesley came he broke the stronghold when pentecostal came he broke through that veil right so now what's holding us something is holding but god has promised he can't change his mind he can't change his ways whatever it is god has already ordained it to be broken and the bride of jesus christ will stand virtuously powerful even as the word of god says so we will and we're moving that's what the devil is hating that's why he's fighting you because he knows your heart he sees you're different from him and if he could kill you he'd kill you but he can't kill you why because we are encompassed about with greater car we have angels we have a wall of fire we have a men a host of angels right it's the truth when elijah was fighting amen uh those syrians and gay hazel you know lord the master there's more of them than us god said open his eye that's what we need we need god to open our eyes so that we can see that there are more of them than us y'all think you're the only one sitting in the chairs people of god there's angels in here now you can't see them but they're here let me let me tell you something i'm a quote i'm gonna finish this but i'm gonna say these things so you can understand i want you to pray for me and i need and i pray for you because i see what god is doing when this squeeze come you can't fight back i know what a lot of people say oh i got my gun and then peter said i got my sword and god said you fight with the sword you're going to die by the sword i've had people look at me like you crazy man somebody in here trying to come and do something to my family i'm killing them well i don't know about that you better make sure that's the will of god you see what i'm saying acknowledge the lord in all his ways and he shall direct your past see because if you're not careful that adamic nature will jump you and you'll act out of the flesh right so that's not what we that's not the test we we're coming to a place amen to god we've got to be lambs did y'all know that we must be a lamb the nature of the lamb when the holy ghost comes it is the nature of a lamb not a goat and a lamb amen is willing to be led by led to the slaughter oh you said what even peter when he was he knew he had to die he knew he was going to be crucified and then peter says no i'm not worthy don't crucify me like my lord i'm not worthy to be crucified like him turn me upside down paul he knew when he went to rome he knew heaven was going to kill him he knew it but he went on any way because he had one more thing he had to do he had to preach to the emperor you understand me how many of us you know i look at where your brother says well he got killed in the accident but didn't you know he knew it he literally on the tapes tell the people yeah one of these days they're going to be taking my hand from the steering wheel he saw it and guess what he marched on with it anyhow all of the great patriarchs did they saw it coming and paul saw it coming but paul was excited when he saw that his day was coming he even laughed in the face of death oh death where's your staying oh grave where's your victory thanks be to god who gives us a victory through our lord and savior jesus christ that is a real believer because i'm gonna tell you what's moving your whole government or the government's all over the world is being demon inspired i'm going to read you what brother brandon said you said don't say that brother you're on the air listen john the baptist said to herodias and and that ain't yours you understand how can you hold back the fire when the fire is in you what you gonna do when they come knocking on your dell and try to find out what you believe in what you stand for no you can't do that i'd rather die in this thing than to give up my truth this is just a moment people pain this pain lasts a moment your body can't take but so much of it it's going to give up the goals one way or the other y'all understand jesus christ is the only true living god he's the only way listen let me i'm to let you go i forgot we started late forgive me because it is every government is the seed of satan jesus says so the bible says see every government is controlled by the devil there is govern there is coming a government who will be who will be controlled by christ but that's in the millennium but this these governments now no matter how well we think they are yet the back of them they're they're dominated by satan these kingdoms he said are mine i do with them whatever i wish to i would give them to you if you would worship me is that what jesus that's what devil he showed jesus all the kingdoms and he said they were mine how did they become he is satan i mean uh adam and eve forfeited the rights and when they forfeited the right this world became that's why people say well i can't believe god this ain't our god jesus christ is not he didn't make this mess it was the devil and his evil men shall wax worse and worse because this is satan's eden this is his he's in control of everything you know that's the truth back in the colonial days when people if they thought you was a witch you was burned now witchcraft is published on tv like ooh come and enjoy it you can be one if you want they're recruiting people right nothing is said oh they don't want christian books in school but they can tell you about all the demonic power right what's that television show that had you know with the people you know i can't even think of any of it but this boy and this girl all them witches and they were doing all this crazy stuff it i can't think of it but anyway y'all know what i'm talking if i said it but but what i'm trying to say is but what about the christians right now the world not just the united states the world is turning on the christians the real ones the fake ones they don't have to worry about they got them already but those real christians we're in their way i'm almost done psalm said this is i'm closing on this scripture psalm 24 so you can realize we can realize tonight who we are and what what what what the lord is to us or should be to us the earth is the lord's and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein for he have found it upon the seas and established it upon the floods who shall ascend into the heel of the lord or who shall stand in his holy place he that have clean hands and a pure heart who have not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully he shall receive the blessings from the lord and righteousness from god of his salvation this is the generation of them that seek him that seek thy face o jacob lift up your heads oh ye gates and ye be and be ye lifted up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is the king of glory the lord strong and mighty the lord mighty in battle lift up your heads on your gaze even lift him up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory and just right at it says and shayla means meditate on this so you'll understand we're living in the last days and i didn't get out really everything i really wanted to get out but one thing that god told paul just held timothy neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbyter meditate upon these things give thyself holy to them that thy profiting may appear to all take heed unto thyself and to the doctrine continuing them for in doing this doubt shall both save thyself and them that hear thee and so i'm going to say it like this there's a time when the trinitarian doctrine was heresy but now the oneness of god is heresy it flipped and i'm going to tell you something we know that demons ride on the trinity ask any witch they'll tell you and it's so sad that the churches have no idea what they're worshiping and the bible said it would be this way jesus even said i come in my name and you won't receive me but another will come in his name in him you will receive and whether y'all know it or not but i'm gonna tell you something this thing is closing fast very fast and you've got to make sure they say make your call in an election sure seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these other things will be added what will it gain what will it prosper a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul i don't understand the mind of a rich man a rich man get richer every day and when he dies like solomon said a fool will take it and spend it for him it's true they they works it's a demon demons demons they don't even know they're possessed but many people can't handle the truth because they they feel like they're giving up too much that rich young ruler i guarantee you he's now in hell and he wished he had only followed jesus instead of following in his money let's stand all power is given and heaven and earth is given unto me said the lord jesus i'm not trying to be mean i know people are listening on the youtube i hope something was said to them and if they did get mad then god will handle it but i can't be afraid because somebody's going to hear are they going to hear i have to speak as god calls me to speak but i realize if i don't blow the trumpet who's going to sound the alarm if i don't try to tell the people of god what what we're getting ready to face and you need to prepare yourself we're living in a time where mothers will begin to be against fathers and fathers against sons and daughters against mother we're living where god says i didn't come to bring peace i came to bring a sword and the word of god separates family we think oh if it's true they're gonna bring him no no no no god took me out of my family i love my family this day but i love my god more you love the lord he is so rich he is so merciful he's so good and i thank god for all that he's done for me saints of god i want i want that undisturbed faith i look at those old warriors through the time of suffering when they came with the great persecution and go read them fox's book about it you'd be surprised see the history they done covered that up and people have forgotten but let me tell you something there's been no nature change that church that killed back then is still alive and more vicious now than ever when did she ever change her nature no we saw her in revelation she's riding a beast with ten heads now if you're watching them if you're watching the news a little bit you see now that those ten airs are now forming up call them you in whatever you want to call it call them united but the bible said they will give their power to the beast and they've done it that's why the world is moving into this one world order all over the world he's moving the devil is and that's what people don't understand and it's all about religion it's all about i'm telling you it started in heaven dropped down to the earth now we're at the end of it god is depending on you and i'm depending on god you love the lord ask our brother to come that's just about the word of prayer first our gracious father i so thank you lord for what's being said i trust lord something was said that will awaken the hearts of the people simple as it may be we understand that the spirit that we're working is against is more powerful than any man but when it comes to the holy ghost it becomes powerless and father we need you in this hour there's no way that we can defeat this hour or conquer the enemy before us without you [Music] we'll be like israel without the ark of the covenant we'll be defeated without you but we need you jesus not around us but in us living in us abiding in us lord we do want to worship with all of our heart but father you know the tug of war that we have with ourselves in the flesh every day but lord
