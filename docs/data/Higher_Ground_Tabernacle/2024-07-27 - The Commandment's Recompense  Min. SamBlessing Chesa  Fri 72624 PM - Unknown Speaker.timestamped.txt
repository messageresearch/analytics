[21:35] why because you're listening to the
[21:37] Commandments of God God will not let
[21:39] that go in vain but he says if you
[21:41] follow
[21:42] that you shall have good success in
[21:46] other in the earlier scripture we read
[21:48] in Proverbs it says you shall have favor
[21:50] both with God and with man even in
[21:53] school you will just find special favor
[21:56] with your teachers at work you don't
[21:59] know why your boss just favors you why
[22:01] because you are listening to the
[22:02] Commandments of God and His blessings
[22:05] are on you and his favor is following
[22:07] you men don't know why you're being
[22:09] favored but it's simply because God has
[22:12] favored you because you listen to his
[22:15] Commandments um next verse for you
[22:19] please and we go to Psalm Psalms
[22:23] 18 the Bible says the Lord rewarded me
[22:26] according to my righteousness according
[22:28] to the cleanness of my hands have you
[22:31] recompensed me for I have kept the ways
[22:35] of the Lord and have not wickedly
[22:38] departed from
[22:40] God for all his judgments were before me
[22:44] and I did not put his I didn't put away
[22:48] his statues away from me so here's what
[22:51] the writer is saying God rewarded me he
[22:55] gave me
[22:56] benefits he paid me because I was
[23:00] righteous and remember righteous does
[23:03] not mean that you do not sin righteous
[23:07] the prophet of God gives us that um
[23:08] definition of what a righteous man is a
[23:11] righteous man is one whom when he falls
[23:14] down it gets up you fall down 99 times
[23:18] get up 100 you fall down you keep on
[23:21] going look at Abraham all the lying he
[23:25] did look at Isaac all the lying he did
[23:28] jaob of all the lying he did but if you
[23:30] read their
[23:33] report in Hebrews it says they were
[23:36] perfect they didn't do
[23:39] nothing why because righteous men is not
[23:43] someone who never sins because we all
[23:45] sin the only person who never sinned is
[23:47] Jesus so if you sin get get up my
[23:50] brother get up my sister and keep on
[23:53] walking that's what a righteous man is
[23:55] so if you are righteous he says I have
[23:58] kept the ways of the Lord and have not
[24:01] wickedly departed from my God for all
[24:03] his judgments were before me and I
[24:05] didn't put out his statutes so he got
[24:08] rewarded for keeping the Lord's statutes
[24:11] if you can go to the next one
[24:13] please um I don't know why I lost um
[24:17] okay looks like there's a little region
[24:19] here that I uh that I
[24:21] need okay it
[24:24] says the next one it says I was also
[24:27] upright before him and I kept myself
[24:30] from my
[24:31] iniquity therefore had the Lord
[24:33] recompensed me according to my
[24:36] righteousness according to the cleanness
[24:39] of my hands in his
[24:44] eyesight saying the Lord rewarded me of
[24:48] my righteousness so throughout all these
[24:50] scriptures we are reading we are seeing
[24:52] a pattern and we are seeing the clear
[24:54] message that we're talking about that
[24:56] listening to God's Commandments you will
[24:58] get a recompense you will get a good
[25:01] reward that's all it is we go to uh John
[25:05] chter 14 verse 21 he
[25:08] says he hath kept my Commandments and
[25:11] keepeth them he it is that loveth me and
[25:16] he that loveth me shall be loved of my
[25:18] father and I will love him and will
[25:22] manifest myself to
[25:27] him listen listen to that he that keep
[25:31] he that hath my Commandments and keepeth
[25:34] them he says I love him and my father
[25:38] loves him too and I will manifest myself
[25:41] to him that's another reward keep the
[25:45] Commandments of God Jesus Christ will
[25:48] reveal himself in his own person to you
[25:51] when you follow the word and Judah said
[25:54] unto him that's not judas's scariot he
[25:55] says Lord how how is it that thou
[25:58] manifest thyself unto us and not unto
[26:01] the world and Jesus answered and said
[26:03] unto him if a man love me he will keep
[26:06] my words and my father will love him and
[26:10] we will come unto him and make our abod
[26:14] in him with
[26:16] him this is nothing but the Holy Ghost
[26:20] because the Holy Ghost is the person of
[26:21] Jesus Christ himself leaving in you and
[26:24] this is the
[26:25] best the tops them all best reward you
[26:29] can ever get from God he says you listen
[26:32] to my Commandments keep my Commandments
[26:35] keep my word and I will love you my
[26:39] father will love you and we will come
[26:42] and leave in
[26:43] you and we know these are not two
[26:46] persons this is not
[26:49] um the Trinity or the the tuness of God
[26:53] but it's God it's um it's one God
[26:58] showing himself in two different offices
[27:00] so he's saying my father will love you I
[27:03] will love you and we will come and leave
[27:05] in you and that's the Holy Ghost that's
[27:07] a formula of receiving the Holy Ghost
[27:09] keep God's Commandments do what his word
[27:11] is saying repent and be
[27:14] baptized and you shall be filled with
[27:16] the Holy
[27:17] Ghost and he that loveth me not keep not
[27:23] my sayings he that loveth me not keepeth
[27:25] not my sayings those that don't love God
[27:27] does not keep his Commandments and the
[27:29] word which you hear is not mine but the
[27:31] father's which sent
[27:33] me but this thing I command I them
[27:36] saying obey my
[27:39] voice we've going to the next uh that's
[27:42] that's the next verse I mean you'll find
[27:45] you go
[27:47] back Jeremiah chapter Jeremiah chapter 7
[27:50] and verse 25 this was God um talking to
[27:53] Jeremiah giving him the word to go tell
[27:55] the people remember the prophet is a m
[27:58] PE of God so when you listen to what the
[28:00] prophet says you are hearing directly
[28:02] from God in Jeremiah chapter 7 God was
[28:06] sending Jeremiah to go talk to talk this
[28:08] to the children of Israel he said since
[28:11] the day that your fathers came forth out
[28:13] of the land of Egypt unto this day I
[28:16] have sent unto you all my servants the
[28:18] prophets daily rising up and early
[28:21] sending them yet they hearkened not unto
[28:25] me it's not because they didn't listen
[28:28] they heard it but they didn't do what
[28:30] the word was saying yet they hacken not
[28:33] unto me no inclined their ear but Harden
[28:37] their neck they did worse than their
[28:40] fathers they decided to not listen to
[28:43] The Commandments of God and verse 27
[28:46] says therefore Thou shalt speak all
[28:49] these words unto them but they will not
[28:52] hearken to thee Thou shalt also call
[28:55] unto them but they will not answer thee
[28:57] he's already telling them I'm sending
[28:58] you but they are hard-headed they have
[29:01] hard stiff necks they're not going to
[29:02] listen to what you're saying but thou sh
[29:04] say unto them this is a nation that
[29:07] obeyeth not the voice of the Lord the
[29:10] god nor receiveth correction truth is
[29:14] perished and is cut from their mouth cut
[29:17] off thine hair oh Jerusalem and cast it
[29:19] away and take up a lamentation on high
[29:22] places for the Lord hath rejected and
[29:24] forsaken the generation of his WTH God
[29:27] is telling the children of Israel that
[29:29] he was he was his wroth was kindled
[29:32] against them because of what they had
[29:34] did not listening to the Commandments of
[29:36] God so listening to the Commandment of
[29:38] God has a recompense and remember a
[29:40] recompense is a reward and could it
[29:43] could either be an evil
[29:44] reward or a good reward and he says for
[29:48] the children of Judah have done evil in
[29:50] my sight say the Lord they have set
[29:52] their Abominations in the house which is
[29:54] called by my name to pollute it and they
[29:56] have built the high places of toet which
[29:59] is in the Valley of the son of ham to
[30:02] burn their sons and their daughters in
[30:04] the fire which I commanded them not to
[30:06] neither came it into my heart therefore
[30:08] behold the days come say the Lord that
[30:11] it shall no more be called T nor the
[30:14] Valley of the son of H but the valley of
[30:16] Slaughter for they shall bury in t Till
[30:20] There be not Place says because you
[30:23] didn't listen to me you're not going to
[30:25] have enough Graves this is is another
[30:28] recompense of not listening to the
[30:30] Commandments of God it says and the
[30:33] carcasses of these of these people shall
[30:35] be meat for the fouls of heaven and for
[30:37] the Beast of the earth and um None Shall
[30:40] free away from them then will I cause to
[30:43] sees from the cities of Judah and from
[30:46] the streets of Jerusalem the voice of
[30:49] merth and voice of gladness the voice of
[30:52] the bridegroom and the voice of the
[30:53] Bride for the land shall be desolate
[30:56] this is a curse that come for not from
[30:59] not listening to the Commandments of God
[31:03] Amen so this is another recompense it
[31:06] does not mean you are only God is this
[31:08] father who's just spoiling you do what
[31:11] do whatever you're going to do he's not
[31:13] like a grandfather who whatever the
[31:15] grandkid does you're just okay you break
[31:17] things you're okay you don't listen to
[31:20] Commandments oh you're fine God is not
[31:23] like that he's also a god of wrath he's
[31:25] a god of judgment listen to his
[31:27] Commandments he will give you judgment
[31:29] listen to his Commandments sorry he'll
[31:31] give you Mercy don't listen to them he
[31:34] will give you judgment and the children
[31:36] of Israel were taken away into captivity
[31:38] because they were not
[31:41] listening to his Commandments I'm going
[31:44] to skip everything I
[31:46] have
[31:51] to Exodus
[31:53] 19 um I'll try to run to that y just I'm
[31:57] just going to end on that one right
[31:58] there Exodus 19 um verse 5 he says now
[32:03] therefore if you will obey my voice
[32:04] indeed and keep my Covenant then ye
[32:08] shall be a peculiar treasure unto me
[32:11] above all people for all the Earth is
[32:16] mine that's another reward if you obey
[32:19] my voice indeed and keep my co Covenant
[32:23] you shall be peculiar peculiar means
[32:26] special you are
[32:28] different it says for all the Earth is
[32:31] mine and you shall be unto me a kingdom
[32:34] of priests and an holy nation these are
[32:38] the words that thou shallal speak to the
[32:39] children of Israel this is in Exodus
[32:43] he's saying if you do my if you do what
[32:45] I say in my word you shall become a
[32:47] kingdom of priests and later on we see
[32:50] in Revelation John comes on and he's
[32:53] saying blessed is he that read and they
[32:56] that hear the word words of this
[32:58] prophecy and keep those things which are
[33:00] written therein for the time is at
[33:02] hand and um so it's not just reading but
[33:08] they that hear the words of the prophecy
[33:10] and keep those things which are written
[33:13] for time is far spent and this was John
[33:15] to the seven Church
[33:17] ages and verse 5 says and Jesus Christ
[33:20] who is the faithful witness and the
[33:22] first begotten of the dead and the
[33:24] prince of the kings of the earth unto
[33:27] him that loves loved us and washed us
[33:30] from our sins in his own blood he had
[33:33] made us Kings and Priests unto God and
[33:37] his father to him be glory and Dominion
[33:40] forever and ever

[33:47] Commandments reading his word keeping
[33:50] his Commandments see Jesus Christ
[33:54] himself who died for you he was he has
[33:57] made us Kings and Priests unto God Kings
[34:02] means that he has given us Authority
[34:04] priests means we can intercede for one
[34:06] another he has given us power that's a
[34:09] recompense that's a reward for keeping
