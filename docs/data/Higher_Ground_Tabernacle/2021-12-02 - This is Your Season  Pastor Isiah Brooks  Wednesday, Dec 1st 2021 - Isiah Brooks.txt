song because it means so much god is so good to us and i trust that the word of the lord will be a blessing to you tonight my subject is this is your season and i know you're probably wondering where i'm going to come from on this but i'm dealing with grace and the expression of christ in you so let us as we stand let us turn to saint john we're going to come from the sixth chapter of saint john the reason why we most of us struggle is because we have a revelation sometimes of what grace is sometimes it's right and sometimes it's wrong but i i understand that a lot of times when it comes to being a christian we come short we come short especially of our joy because we forget what calvary was all about and we must understand that there is nothing that you can do in yourself god didn't need no help to save you he saved you because he wanted to amen and uh you must understand that that uh god so loved the world he went out of his way to save us amen and uh it's not like he's going to save us today and lose us tomorrow but i trust that somehow through the message you'll be a blessed tonight beginning at the 28th verse of the sixth chapter beginning at the 28th verse then say they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god and jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that you believe on him whom he sent amen and understand that believing is an action word yes because once you hear and you believe you act upon what you believe or heard one more scripture coming from romans the fourth chapter you love the lord amen amen glad to see everybody here today see god doing his whatever he's doing i know he's he's working on me and i'm so glad to be a part of that by god's grace romans the fourth chapter beginning at the first verse what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found for if abraham was justified by works he hath were up to glory but not before god for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of death did y'all hear that yes sir but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justify at the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as david also described the blessedness of man unto whom god imputed righteousness without what works saying blessed are they whose iniquity are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin love the lord let us pray father god we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us giving us grace today we thank you for your mercy that endureth to all generations and lord we pray tonight that you bless the service in a special way we give you honor and glory in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated this is your season and the reason why i entitled it because the pentecostal age is pretty much over god is calling a people out of that age to bring into what we call the eternal age where the bride of jesus christ dwell amen and you know i think about things the word of god how the word of god is so true and pure of itself uh when we look at the word we come to see that the word is how can i say dimensional if i can say it like that because the word is so eternal eternal that it no matter what age it is spoken it still lives it's active it's like he spoke it today it was at every age it's been that way because the bible says that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's a god that changes not and you and i must understand that in order to enjoy this salvation you need a true revelation amen of what grace is amen that's true you know i've noticed sometimes that though we live life by our own choices we are kept by god's plan of predestination amen god that's what keeps us safe is what god has set in his mind for you to do now i'm going to tell you like this the works of god is to believe on him that uh that god whom god has sent but there are two kinds of works there's a work that you do and there's a work that god does amen and paul was talking about the faith or the work that comes by the faith in god and that faith is what god thinks of you and james talked about works uh faith without works is dead now he's looking at what people think of you because if you are a christian they expect to see works from you but you see most of the time the works that god does for us we don't even see it amen god is using us in ways that we will never see until we get over there remember the power of the lord when i did i feed you when were you hungry and i fed you when were you naked that i clothed you when were you thirsty i gave you drink these people were doing the work of god didn't even know it because they didn't know at what point in time the work in which they did was that work in which god predestinated them to understand that the work that god gives us is something that will always come out right amen we use the word manipulate but sometimes god will move you in a way to produce what he wants for the purpose of what he he sent you for amen and listen when it comes to that that kind of a work that kind of a faith is not in your hands it's in god's hands and god determines all of that like for example somebody who might want to sing and it says oh i want to sing i've got to sing and they have no singing voice well no matter how they try to sing it is not what god purposed them to do you understand what i'm trying to say everybody have we have a purpose and there's a god purpose and then there's a grace of god and you understand that grace and faith and love all work together you can't have faith without love and you can't have love without faith is that right so you got to understand by god's grace amen there is also a work that god uses with the elect the elect only everybody can't do what the elect does and each each elected individual has a work that god has set forth in his mind for them to do oftentimes they don't even know what that is the work of god for example is that little woman who was in church and she walked up with her little mics those two mics and put it in the offering plan that was the work of god and that work of god is now on the record of heaven amen you hear what i'm saying it was already in the mind of god and then it took us a prophet to tell us that reason why there was she was so inspired to do that because god was granting her eternal life hallelujah now you think about uh uh in the bible when you had anna and simeon and and they're they're in the temple all day now think about this it's been hundreds of years and there was no messiah but somehow in the inspiration in their prayer life they were inspired to remain in the temple amen and pray to jesus come amen hallelujah now they didn't know what they were doing but they had the inspiration and god moved them into that place there were other prophets no doubt other than anna and simeon but they were the elected ones in which god wanted to place in the book so you and i must understand there are things that we are doing we don't even know it is ordained of god amen but it is that's why when we get over there we're going to see what all we did for the kingdom of god oh it's true it's true think about it that's god's thoughts concerning you now of course when when when uh uh ruth and naomi and her husband and all them went down to uh moab they had no idea they were in the will of god because to everybody else they were backslidden hallelujah but god knew exactly what he was doing he knew that the only way that he could get ruth out of there he had to send someone in that's the way you do it especially on the warfare you sit in your spies your spies bring out what you want them to bring and that's exactly what god did you and i must understand that that that when we come to uh works like i said there's a work of god and remember jesus christ even says i come to do the work of god and he never strayed one moment because he didn't have a will of his own per se because he surrendered every thought he had to the word of god amen he never missed a beat he's not like you and i because of our own will we sometimes miss a few beats sometimes we think uh that the works of god is is uh feeding the poor and uh you know giving arms and all kinds of those things that and mind you you got to be careful in even when you do that because if there is just an ounce of self-gratification you've missed it amen because this is not about you and it's not about me it is about him you love the lord now you and i must understand there's a plan a redemption see and in this plan amen is to make uh whatever god has thought about you come to a complete end yeah you can't miss it that's why people they don't understand the word of god is true if a man confessed with his mouth believe in his heart that jesus christ is his savior amen he is saved amen well it doesn't matter where he's at brother was in a baptist church you understand me god began to move him out of there and then he went into the pentecostal realm and then from there into the word but you see once that seed has been quickened once god has gotten your attention you he can never take it back see and god knows those that are been elected to do what he wants them to do so you see when we talk about works human human works remember i read to you the work that god requires of us is to do to believe on him that one that god sent all that believed in moses it's true once they it when they those who continue to believe now you got to continue you can't you can't not believe today and believe tomorrow it's continue whom god has sent and the one he's speaking of here is himself jesus christ says believe on him whom god have sent is that right because salvation can come by no other than the lord jesus christ and understand jesus christ is a more faith he changes his mass so whom god sends is whom we must believe in it doesn't stop there and the thing is as i thought i said you know a lot of times i've been there sometimes we sit still and we think to ourselves oh god if i you know i haven't done nothing for you but who says god wants you to do something amen y'all understand me god had a man 30 years blind a religious man did nothing but beg did arms right but he never knew that when he saw jesus and jesus healed him that that was in the mind of god and that was his purpose amen hallelujah because they asked him who did sin and and jesus said nobody but all of this was done for the glory of god y'all understand me so our works that god has ordained for us to do will never come back to him void amen no matter what you go through it will never come back to him void you will accomplish everything that god has in his mind for you to come accomplish and matter of fact you can't even die until then you love the lord you know most people believe that the works that we are judged for is the way we live our daily lives that is our actions and our thoughts and our speech and other beliefs that works are only uh our conscious effort to speed or spread the gospel and to do good for mankind now all of those things that we just read there is is all about you but god doesn't judge you that way and we didn't know that but the bride of jesus christ has nothing against her you have been so justified amen and the pro listen that's the message that's the word the bride of jesus christ has nothing against her see we talk about dwelling in her his presence but oftentimes we look at the word we look at our works our works versus god's works see what i'm saying but what god has determined for us none of your words can hinder it that's right amen what yes it was god's purpose to give peter the keys and peter denied the lord three times what he did was his own works though they were bad but those bad works could not hinder him from getting the keys because in the mind of god peter was to be the sportsman on the day of pentecost see what i'm trying to say we we we fail to see and we because we take our consciousness you know we judge ourselves in so many ways so many ways that we even doubt whether we save sometime because we're not doing what we feel like god wants us to do remember your feelings can get you in trouble amen hallelujah you've got to be led by the spirit they that are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god amen hallelujah listen brother banham talks about faith works and work is dead in 1950 he says now look like paul was speaking in romans the fourth chapter justifying abraham by faith and james is justifying him by works but it does not contradict paul was speaking with what god saw in abraham and james was speaking of what man saw in abraham you understand me god you're right paul was speaking of what god saw in abraham and james was speaking uh what man saw in abraham right because what god saw god saw abraham staggered not at the promises of god but if we read the bible in our own way looking at his works we would say he's staggered but whose report will you believe amen so you and i must come to a place amen as we said uh uh god then james speaking was speaking of what man saw in genesis 22 where abraham offered up isaac you see so faith what faith you have that's what god sees and what your what your works is is what your neighbors see see because somebody said oh that cannot be a christian i saw them do this and i saw them knew that who's the judge of it amen who's going to relay any charge to god's elect y'all understand what i'm saying it is god's judgment that determines who's a christian and who's not regardless to whether you work or whether you don't our working amen is there for rewards lay up your treasures in heaven there is your rewards but understand amen whether you do anything or not once you're saved truly saved god has saved you he's he's allowed you to come in there's no way of turning you out thank you lord right now so you'll understand by god's grace ah your faith in itself in god points to your predestination see because the bride of jesus christ will always believe the word amen and if you have a true believer it's it's it is your faith that keeps you going to you reach your destination see and that's what we don't understand we think faith is something else but faith is that determination i've made a lot of mistakes i've made a lot of faults i've had a lot of thoughts i've had a lot of failures but watch this there ain't no turning around because what i know is true and i believe that he that begun the good work in me is faithful to completed i believe it it ain't me i'm not doing the work he's doing the work see it's like this when they took in the old testament that little lamb and and you had to put your hand on that lamb for sacrifice that means you could go away free all you had to do is believe that that lamb was taking on your punishment that's it o lamb of god amen he became our sin that we might become his righteousness amen hallelujah how did abraham receive righteousness which abraham is a type of us abraham received righteousness because he believed god amen and it was imputed unto him for righteousness hallelujah now let's bring it to our day because the same god that was in abraham was in william branham and because we believe him you understand me it wasn't the prophet's word it was god who was in the prophet's word y'all got quiet on that one but it's true anyhow it's true it is the word of god and because of what we're believing listen it is the prophet that hews the people out it is this message that bring the people out of the organization is that right elijah stood there on mount carmel and says amen let's go have a show down here y'all understand me all who worship god stand on my side and all that worship bear stand over that side right what was he doing hewing them out bringing them out separating the believers from the unbelievers and those who followed uh followed elijah eli elijah amen stood with god and those who followed baal stood with denomination and organization so you coming out of the system proves whose side you're on amen hey we sweat and i have to oh lord you know because how can i say it like this i'm gonna throw this at you sometimes god deliver us and we don't even believe it really know it that he did you're supposed to have faith to believe that he right that's right how many times you've gotten healed and the symptoms lingered you understand me and eventually because you believe the symptoms disappear is that right that's how it is with salvation that's how it is with healing you must understand this body is sick it's sick in the natural it's seeking the spirit y'all understand and it takes work i believe i'm perfect and it takes the word of god time to bring that perfection through your body as he would any kind of sickness because sin is a sickness it's spiritual unbelief it's a sickness and faith will move keep moving until everything that you come short in is out of your mind out of your body amen that's the word amen it heals let me say it like this how many of us have been changed and don't even know when it happened amen huh it happens sometimes you've had headaches lord heal my head you're gonna don't even know when the headache disappeared amen but it was the word spoken and understand everything has a time period to it god can do a miracle on you but usually when it comes to healing and this message medicine that we're talking about is the bomb of gilead right it will heal us and right now the word of this hour which is the healing of god it is the perfection of god and it is bringing us to perfection and all we got to do is let it happen amen because you can't do it you can't sanctify yourself huh you couldn't justify yourself so how you're going to sanctify yourself it takes the word of god to sanctify you and in his time right in his time god will sanctify you you love the lord oh yes think about it many times people do a lot of great things and sometimes people do wonderful things especially in the world and folks says oh my goodness he was a saint or she was a saint and you know why they do that because these people through their lives have done such great wonderful works help people and the bible says you can do all of that and have not charity it profits you nothing but understand now god is the judge at the end of the day people who are if i could say won't make it to heaven but come up in the white throne judgment because they have been good to you god is going to grant them eternal life think about that now because those people as well as we are what we are we have been ordained to be bride and they have been ordained to be what they are but god is merciful god is just hallelujah because he said as you've done unto the least of these you've done it unto me so you and i must understand we shouldn't even worry about people oh god i just wonder if they're going to be saved well if it was in god's mind for them to be saved they will be amen and one thing for i one thing i know is that faith is a creation a creator i just saw something the other day and science is now tapping into it because they thought one time that man in the universe was separate from the other right and then god comes along and and through science has proven to uh uh to the scientists that man is connected to everything and no matter how far it goes out into the universe we are affect affecting it you understand me what we do now is affecting that you say oh it can't be well let me say it like this to put it in the word when adam sinned the whole creation fell huh everything failed and so everything we do that's why the bible says be careful about your wordings right don't let them be idle because everything is creative especially when you're observing something i heard brother adam said if you you want the holy ghost of you want perfection he said view your especially when you see when you're sick he said if you can envision yourself healed and then walk into it amen and then the scientists are saying the same thing they call it photons futons and they did an experiment where they actually had this big board and they actually had two slits in it and then they fired the futons and and one when the futons were not being observed it went straight but they noticed that when when the futons were being observed they acted in a different way showing amen that we have an effect on creation bring it down to the message brother branham said you can create your atmosphere you hear what i'm saying you can create it no matter how hey let me you know where they broke it down to prayer how prayer here in des moines can reach somebody in guyana south america it's the creation it's the futons it's the power of god who connects us to the universe we're connected to heaven amen sin broke us up pretty much but the holy ghost unites us hallelujah that's why the bible says we're now sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus amen what are you going to do with all of this power and authority that god has given to us so much so he said you're so connected to nature that if you say to a mountain be moved that mountain has to hear in movies you understand me so you say what do you mean i'm talking about god's faith and god's faith is in the bride of jesus christ now your faith god's faith and when we see that god has a purpose for us to do we need to express ourselves the reason why i entitle it uh this is your your season because there's not there's there's not coming another one this is the end of it right into eternity we we moves and the bride of jesus christ is what we call the finale of the whole drama and she takes everything and you understand what a finale is it takes everything that had previously come before it and cap it off and that's what god is trying to tell us but you got to understand that condemnation in your spirit of yourself hinders you and it creates a negative atmosphere and therefore it hinders the purpose of god in you amen now these things were brought to me and i'm trying to tell us tonight amen this is why uh i was telling a brother the other day the scripture says if you keep your mind stared on me i will grant you perfect peace what is perfect peace but god himself you can't get it no better than that if you got perfect peace you got perfect faith listen paul before he died had perfect peace oh you going to nero's chopping block he didn't laugh at nero he laughed at the devil oh death where's your stain oh grave where is your victory he's speaking these things thanks be to god who gives us a victory through our lord and savior jesus christ he's speaking and understand brother branham said when you speak the word of god you got angels that must bring that makes it come to pass it all is all connected you say it can't be it is even when brother branham was born there was a star that showed up in the sky not only just showed up in the sky but came down and hovered over his head as a baby he didn't know nothing about no stars but the god of the universe did hallelujah the same with moses it's the same with jesus y'all understand me the pillar fire witness who he was and what he was hallelujah is that right oh you say what do you mean now scientists are saying amen that even man is made out of the cosmic dust well i could have told them that hallelujah and you and i must understand that before we get the holy ghost the light that's in us is cosmic light then brother said when you get the holy ghost that holy ghost life moves the cosmic light out of the way amen oh people of god see what i'm saying but as long as the devil can have you condemning yourself and making you think that you're responsible or you've got you've got control over your life you have no control and nothing you do whether positive or negative is going to stop you from making it because what god has determined can't come back void amen now don't get me wrong i'm not saying go ahead out here in sin the bible says shall we continue in sin that grace may abound say god forbid if you are truly christian if you truly got the holy ghost you're going to do everything you can do to measure up to the word of god amen hallelujah but understand that we cannot sin amen amen the bible say the best seed remaineth in you you cannot sin james says you have faults confess your faults one toward another you understand me because as long as we are in this body this body has to sin nature it hasn't changed yet and because of this body we falter and fail sometimes is that right not a mistake it's a mistake when you didn't know you were going to do it but a mistake is not a mistake when you know what you're doing amen that's not a mistake that's sin you understand me oh yeah understand that god what for ordained works you love the lord amen and you understand that these four dane um works that god has for us none of us says oh i'm just going to serve the lord none of us it was god who drew us that's right it was god who changed our hearts it was god who changed our mind it was god who gave you faith faith is a gift from god you understand me and all men don't have faith that's the word so whatever god has given you use your measure use your measure to the fullest but don't think because i'm a preacher i'm going to make heaven or singer or piano player or usher or deacon those things those are little gifts and those kind of gifts god gives you but the bible said god gives those gifts a man without repentance you don't have to repent to get that you understand me so understand you can't say oh because i'm a preacher i'm going to heaven no sir the only ones that are going to heaven are those who are born again and come to the full stature of christ in this day know i mean rapture y'all know what i'm working with amen so you say well oh my brother brooks brother brooks what are you saying you know a lot of times we we we the calvinist or armenian it's very difficult for people to find a balance saved always you know saved and well i ain't going to do nothing to god make me do it or something you know and that there's no balance in there see that's what a lot of the uh baptist and all dude that's why they dress and act the way they act because they just figure you know i can do whatever i want to do i'm saying no no that ain't it no when you love god the bible says keep my commandments this is a relationship hallelujah this is not a club or large this is a relationship that you must have with god amen and the closer we walk with god the more god will reveal to us hallelujah i'm not going to be long tonight hallelujah but let's go to matthew the 4 6 chapter again matthew 6 you love the lord am i you know what if people can see what salvation has done for them it would truly set them free and people of god i'm not pointing at nobody i'm saying i'm learning myself i'm learning my freedom you know because the bible said when you're saved it washes away the guilt consciousness and i used to struggle what if he washes away the guilt consciousness because now you know what you are and you understand how god thinks about you so you're not feeling all this guilt and oh what i did and what i used to do and how i did that and all that stuff once it's under the blood of jesus christ you move on amen ain't nothing you can do that's going to surprise god amen you think god didn't know that jonah was going to run from him go just the opposite way he knew god had planned the plot jonah ran right into the whale's belly mouth right he knew god prepared it already y'all understand what i'm saying now you look at this thing the bible said abraham staggered dot and as i said i want to ask abraham how in the world could you tell sarah to tell that man you you know i mean but understand to me that's that's that's that's rough that's real rough i can't comprehend that but he did it and brother branham said it like this he said abraham types the bride he's a bride he's a type of the bride as he as god dealt with abraham god deals with abraham see the same way that means we are capable of doing some of the most vilest things but god is capable of cleansing you from all of it and before we all came to christ we revived amen at least to most of us anyway because everything the only person that comes out squeaky clean in all of this is jesus himself he's the only one that comes out squeaky clean what i said matthew the sixth chapter you love the lord fourth verse let's go to the third verse but when thou do with arms let not thy left hand know that right hand doeth that that thine arms may be in secret and that father which in secret seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly you understand that that means that you're not seeking the will of man or the rewards of men but you're literally doing these things as unto the lord as our brother said right you're not even you're not accept you're not seeking self-glorification but you're doing this as unto the lord and when you do things like that unto the lord nobody needs to know what you're doing hello that's the truth that's when god rewards you in this life now that that's not talking about on the other side that's talking about this life amen right so you go on you say wait a minute brother let's move on and when thou prayeth thou shall not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they have their rewards and that's one of the reasons why i don't like praying in public or in the church and stuff like that because i have a battle to keep the channel straight i don't want to be praying for people to enjoy i want god to hear it right so it's difficult sometimes because you even i'm saying with myself because you want to make sure your english is right and who cares god don't care about that but that's the way the devil will cause you to air and you'll forget you're talking to god and you're praying like you're talking to the people you've got your reward so we got to understand every work he expressed was meant to bring salvation to some and cause others to hate him is that the truth what's wrong with that god want every time we look at things and we see what god is doing god amen does things to call some to love him and some to hate him amen that's what god does and you and i must understand these things are real i'm not going to be too much longer but i'm going to tell you one thing about the election the elect of god the elect of god do not trust in her own works how many of y'all think y'all can work your way to heaven and that's where we fall short don't we because we fail to see what grace is amazing grace how sweet the sound let me show you what grace does grace saved a sinner right had never done works in his life never perhaps thought about god didn't have him on his mind but on day on the day of calvary he said lord remember me when you come into the kingdom see so when you when you see what god is doing if god did it once he can do it again but what was he doing he was showing to the believer what god was thinking about the sinner and the man was a vile sinner but in the mind of god he was bride amen right at the last minute a lot of times people don't understand you don't know the relationship that people have and maybe they don't have one at all but in the mind of god they were with him and even at that last moment i know a lot of people won't believe this but it's true anyhow and one of these days we'll see that because brother branham said they're going to be a lot of people saved you thought wasn't going to be there and there'll be many that you thought would be there would not be there amen that's just the way it runs hallelujah you know and in all that we do our works are supposed to supposed to uh witness uh what we are and who we are you know you you got a christian and she she she looking like a jezebel well that's quite hard for us to really believe that person is a christian i remember seeing this so-called uh and not demeaning her because maybe she doesn't know any better but she was one of those uh gospel singers out there i mean she looked like she was in a nightclub or some kind of a less show with what she was wearing and she was singing the song i know i've been changed got home the angels in heaven has changed my name sign my name change what because what's on the inside will reflect on the outside and though we you know how can i say it we must understand that when it comes to grace grace is sovereign as brother branham said in the message of grace grace is sovereign and god will have mercy on whom he will that's why i was saying that song who have known the mind of god and who his counselor will be i mean you understand me god is sovereign he have mercy on whom he will you have grace on whom he will and who's going to stop him if the bible says no man can lay a charge to god's elect who's going to charge him huh hey you say all brothers what are you saying that's why we'll find out at the end of the day people who work let me tell you something you need to understand what the true grace of god is because if you go before god with words he's going to respond to you with works that's what the rich young ruler did he did not have a revelation of the grace of god and he says lord what must i do to inherit the kingdom and jesus said boom he went down through the ten commandments oh i've done them all but he didn't know that was the word the word saw through the heart and understood that he loved his riches more than he loved god and you can't allow yourself to love something more than you love god god must come first hallelujah you and i must understand we're getting ready to go through a persecution and we will be prior to this rapture and if you don't understand grace you don't know what you might say you don't know what you might do you understand me but the grace of god has been with us i mean when peter got under pressure he cursed and everything else and denied god and god still kept him amen yeah but it doesn't give us rights amen to go out and start cursing folks that's not grace we don't trust in our works that's what i'm saying because if you trusted in your works you're condemning yourself because your works will never be good enough amen you're condemning yourself you're working under such a law in such a place amen that you're always you can never satisfy this flesh this flesh could never be righteous that's why god's gonna change it it's the inner man that god is looking at not the outward man paul said the good that i would i don't do then that which i desire to do i find myself not doing it the prophet there of the ephesus age was confessing he wasn't all of that either but he said i pressed toward the mark of a high calling which is in christ jesus paul understood his mission and paul understood that he was supposed to suffer for christ is that what the holy spirit told him because of what you've done you're going to suffer many things for my name's sake and paul is oh god the only thing that paul asked god to heal him from was his eye disease he said how you know it was an eye disease because brother branham said it and he wouldn't get because of the pillow fire because of the scabs and stuff like that he had always had that plus and whatever running out of his eye and paul even said there were some of you who thought i was jesus christ and you would have plucked your own eye out and give it to me you understand me so paul had the same kind of fanaticism following him but understand your position as bride we will not leave out of here as failures will not leave out here as cowards this is your season and your season should be that season of staying in the presence of the lord amen hallelujah i thought about that the bible says pray without ceasing staying in the presence of the lord i says lord how you just do that and the lord said to me i believe he's talking to me because i was talking to him you let me do it you desire it you ask for it i will fulfill it because none of us can do that not one of us can do that with all of our efforts we could never do that the greatest of all men couldn't do it you say oh what do you mean just to show you i'm not saying just you go out and do things you ought not to do but david took another man's wife but the grace of god was with david and god even calls david you know he's a man after his own heart explain that one to me you see because he understood the intent of david he knew the purpose of david and he also knew the devil's tricks hallelujah and god knows every time the devil has tricked you to do something that you shouldn't do and god don't hold you chargeable why you believe god and your believing god is god has counted it as righteousness hallelujah i feel like shouting tonight because the grace of god surpasses this is why i say hey everybody want all all these laws and all these rules and that i mean that they're good you know we're supposed to correct the church and put things in order and things like that especially when a brother and sister is purposely walking disorderly but when somebody falls short the grace of god should be there you don't you don't stop and kill your soldiers you pack them on your back if you got to carry them you carry them you understand me that's what the love of god is you don't have grace you don't have love you don't have love you don't have grace we you you know how it is you think about it and you think grace and love don't care about what nobody else thinks when it comes to the services of god what do you mean jesus came to simon's house sent there by god knew the prostitute mary was coming knew the ridicule he was going to get knew how people was going to judge him you see what they did they judged him and says how can this man be of god and don't know this kind of a woman the problem was they didn't know he did know them know her he knew her better than they did and here was mary didn't even know it she was going to be in the book forever under the inspiration of thirst because jesus said if you thirst after righteousness you shall be filled and she thoughts for that righteousness she was willing to die to her own pride and she went into simon's house saw jesus there and all she could do was worship him see that's the problem we fail to see we come to worship him it was it was vast i who refused to worship god that's true her husband right the king that was in shout and tight but esther worshipped him she always showed respect to the king even at a time when she was in call or summon she still respected him she didn't come up there like a little sassy woman she came in humility hallelujah like i said even when it comes to the sinner we don't sin i mean a christian we don't sin now you can't have a sinner and a saint at the same time you can't be a sinner in the same that's why i say you got to watch your motives because if you're doing something and you know it's wrong you're doing it that's saying it's when you stomp your toe you didn't know you was going to stump your toe that's a mistake you understand me a mistake is something that you don't know is going to happen and it happens but when you think about what you're doing that's sin oh i don't get a great amen on that one [Laughter] but they just can't be mistakes if you know what you're doing when you're doing it that's not a mistake understand as long as this nature is with us and it will be into the changing of the body you're going to struggle the bible said we were born and shaping in iniquity and in sin did our mothers conceive us that's what it is right you don't have to teach a child how to lie you don't have to teach a child how to steal that nature is there but because we are born again we know how to hush him up right we know how to destroy that nation god will come in and continue like i said with a disease you've been healed and that disease takes a little time for your body to flush it out so is it with everything else you love the lord amen he takes every desire of sin away from you and ever and when god fully gets you to a place where he's taken every bit of that sin desire away from you you are completely there y'all hear me yeah take it away lord take it away that's what grace does because without grace we all would be dead right now way before now oh yes all of us dead buried and everything else if it wasn't for the grace of god and so we understand one thing because we make mistakes doesn't make us unbelievers amen let me say that again because we make mistakes doesn't make us unbelievers right unbelievers is when you know to do to do good and you do it it's not because unbelief is sin right but we confess we spill confess we make things right with god right and understand god in this age where we are we are the most how can i say we have the greatest liberty of er of all the ages amen to express god to express what he wants to express his life we have all the ages we have the room for all of him you understand me every age coming from ephesus on up uh after ephesus had a portion of god but here we have uh the place where all all of god can be filled placed in you now everybody has a little measure of it but all of god is in that measure is that right brother of adam said a little teaspoon of the ocean has all the substance everything the ocean has is in that little teaspoon see that's how god is i'm almost done because i'm trying to tell her something i don't know whether i'm getting it over to you or not one of the things that we must learn to do is trust our faith or have trust in our faith you understand me because that faith was given to you by god faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen faith faith god said to to abraham uh abraham call those things that be not as though they were that was faith who can do that but god amen that ain't the kind of faith that man has gods call those things that be not as though they were and it happened amen right before they ever was a star before there was a moon before they ever was a solar system god called those things that be not as though they were and they had to come to existence and that's what you have to do call those things you don't have to see it you don't have to even envision it as long as you got the word and that inspiration comes to you where do you think it's coming from the devil don't want to give you nothing good the inspiration of faith comes from god and he wants you to step in that and trust in that faith hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the bible said we know that whosoever is born of god sinneth not but he that is begotten of god keepeth himself now you know you can't keep yourself but god is the maintenance man he's the one that maintains us right he is our is that right it's the shepherd that takes care of the sheep it's not the sheep that take care of itself we're too dumb amen it takes god who keepeth us hallelujah and how do he keeps us through our prayer through our trust through our faith through our love all of that god uses that because let me tell you something if you really want god to smile upon you have faith in him god honors your faith in him yes sir and a lot of time when the devil says it ain't going to happen you got to say devil you know what i know you you a liar hold that in his face you're a liar because god says so and when god tells you anything believe it it doesn't have to be written that's right you understand me because in the beginning was the word the word was with god and like i said the other day the word wasn't written it was a person hallelujah and that word today is still a person who is jesus christ himself amen and when you call on the name of jesus he will answer prayer hallelujah god will always come to your rescue that was one of the things that i so enjoyed when i was out there in arizona at brother bob's church and it was a it had been a long time since i felt god brush up against me oh jesus had been a long time i think the time that he brushed up against me i think we was in that church on 100th street and i was preaching and i went to move this and something bumped into me and i was way from the wall that same service my wife was praying she thought somebody had kneeled down to pray with her remember hon and somebody put their arms around her and then who was that for jesus see that's how real he is and you know i want to see that again is there anything wrong with that i want to see that again hallelujah but in a greater measure that's what brother branham said we hold fast our faith our professional confession he said one of these old days he will materialize before you i believe that i believe that and i'm looking for that hallelujah but you got to understand i'm cutting it short faith in his word is what perfects us if you can't you can't believe you can be perfected then then he can't perfect you amen i believe it i believe every one of those virtues are in me and i believe every one of those virtues will it's going to express itself and i believe in god's own time i will reach that perfection that he wants me to reach nothing can stop it that's what i love about it you know you know i won't say this but i will say it you know how those little kids when they used to want to be sassy they just got to do this kind of thing he kind of make you want to do that at the devil you know because there's a thing he can do about it you see the world can't come back forward people this is the time we should be the most joyous of all times we really see the coming of the lord don't you see it and understand who would have seen this like we can see it when brother branham preached a message satan's eden we never thought we could see the all the politics flooded with devils and they're coming after the word amen this is what the listen people say oh it ain't gonna get no better folks it's not happening it is this season that it's the darkest before dawn and it's gonna get darker and think about it when it's all over they're going to come after the christian and they don't care what denomination you belong to but when they understand you say well i don't know well they know you they already know your number they know what you how much money you got in the bank they know all those things there ain't no secret they know what you believe what you don't believe right you got a phone they know where you go and where you don't go they know all of that so how you gonna run first of all you got too much heat you got too much fire in you so they got they got machines they can show know exactly where you're running huh there's no escape except in christ that's the only escape in christ alone will i give the glory in christ alone let me read this last quote ah the message of grace grace was promised in the garden of eden and grace came grace can't get grace to adam and eve nowhere to go know which way to turn and yet grace made a way think about it let me say this my sinner friend you may be here this morning a prostitute you may be here this morning a woman chaser you may be here a drunkard or a gambler or a murderer you might be here as an impure husband or impure wife you might be violent of the violence of sinners you say i've passed that stage of redemption no you're not or you wouldn't be at church this morning grace will make a way for you in the dark hour if you just accept it adam right if you just accepted adam had to be willing to accept it so do you accept it take your hands off of god's work and let god work in you you understand me because it's hard sometimes to accept grace for what it really is because the devil is always there to call you call you a hypocrite and there's no greater hypocrite than the devil y'all understand me let's stand but this is your season and i believe with all of my heart if we learn to just praise god and worship him and give him what is because nothing can save you he saved you nothing you can do the pharisees they thought they could save themselves and the more they tried the worse they got brother branham said it's like a leper trying to lick his spots the more you lick the more the spots become clearer and that's how we do in our lives we try to transform ourselves yeah you transform on your knees there you go when the prophet god talks about remaining in the holiest of holies i said ah how do you do that it's when you can get in your present your closet and you pray until god comes that's that holy place and you begin to pray the more you pray the more you stay right there are times i tell you my mom reached something because in her day i would go to school and when i come back my mom was still locked in that bathroom still praying oh yeah and i'm not just talking about her i'm sure there have been others i heard of a pastor years ago he prayed so much to all of his parents had where his knees wore out what a wonderful testimony and you think about how we struggle and prayer understand me is not always just a feeling it's a connection once you connect it's amazing how long you could be there without knowing how long you've been there how many times you talked to a friend on the phone says oh i didn't know we were on the phone that long you've been in there three hours in my day that's the way it was my buddies we talked on the phone and didn't even know we had talked that long but see when you're enjoying yourself when you're enjoying prayer you could pray and pray and pray and and and it's in those times god changes you because once you enter into prayer you stop speaking unbelief you start beginning to speak faith and those are the things that god that pleases god faith is something that stands in the midst of all things and like i said it's god's grace to give you that nobody can give you that but god you love the lord i appreciate your coming i appreciate you being here i trust somebody has been blessed and i try to bring it more clearly i feel like i it's not as clear as i like to bring it but i trust by god's grace he'll give me a little more time to because that connection did y'all get the part about the universe that's so important that's really an important piece tonight because he created it that way and when adam was in his proper place adam ruled the heavens and the earth he was connected with god and so you got to understand that once we this message is to bring us back to that connection that's why he jesus was able to walk through walls walk on water because they were connected he understood that all of this was part you know they were all part of it's hard to explain it but i do know that we're so connected and it was sin that brought the breach how do you think the prophet could tell you that one of these old days will travel like a thought because it's true the very thoughts how many times you know i know keith different ones we've been uh brother richard and you and brother isaac sometimes you're thinking about a person in the phone ring what was that you don't think oh that's coincidence that's not coincidence it's connection it's a universal thing that's going on beyond this physical body because this physical body really is not you the inner man is spirit [Music] right so you got to understand when you you and i that's why the bible said take this word and meditate on it when you meditate on the word of god it'll take you to another realm a different understanding a greater revelation and when you see grace the way it is you'll never have to worry about falling into the hands of a cult [Music] y'all hear what i said when you really know grace no man ever can ever tell you well if you don't belong to this or you don't belong to that if you don't belong to mine because you know what i belong to jesus christ and him only that's what grace did for me i'm done [Music] there is power in the name of jesus oh there is power in the name of jesus oh there is power in the name of jesus to break every chain to break every chain to break every change [Music] there is power in the name of jesus oh there is power in the name of jesus [Music] to [Music] surprise [Music] she's rising up [Music] [Applause] [Music] we break [Music] oh there is power in the name of jesus there is power in the name of jesus oh there [Music] name is jesus [Music] be hallelujah from this burden of sin there's power in the blood it's power in the blood oh would you [Music] oh there is power [Music] oh there is power [Music] is [Music] [Music] i [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is oh [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Music] of the land god [Music] do [Music] [Applause] [Music] do [Music] do [Music] do [Music] you
