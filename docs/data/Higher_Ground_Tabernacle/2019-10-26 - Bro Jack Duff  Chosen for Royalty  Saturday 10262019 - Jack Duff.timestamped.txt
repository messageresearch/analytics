[35:04] appreciate those of you who have come
[35:06] out tonight I was expecting a greater

[35:13] I just feel sorry for those who didn't
[35:16] show up
[35:17] cuz we're gonna have a good time no

[35:23] do know it's the will of God for me to
[35:25] have our brother Jack here tonight and
[35:27] so I'm expecting because I've heard him
[35:32] preached I've seen the Lord use him and
[35:35] I just want him to have free course I
[35:39] want him to do as God's they do like I
[35:43] said when we come to church we we don't
[35:45] come to see a system we come to see the
[35:50] liberty of the Holy Spirit God is not a
[35:53] system and God wants us to expect the
[35:56] unexpected
[35:59] and she's up front brother he expects us
[36:06] to expect the unexpected and that's what
[36:08] I'm doing I'm doing that by God grace
[36:12] and I trusted everybody else will do
[36:15] likewise like I said I want our brother

[44:08] all over the world a man here in first
[44:12] Peter chapter 2 is what we want to read
[44:14] from a man glory to God
[44:24] thank you Jesus first Peter to just read
[44:27] a couple verses and then from here we'll
[44:34] start at verse 1 thank you so much start
[44:37] at verse 1 says wherefore laying aside
[44:44] all malice and all guile and hypocrisy
[44:49] and envies and all evil speakings
[44:52] and I just love the way Peter writes
[44:55] this it says laying aside all these
[44:57] things and and this is not something
[44:59] where we necessarily pray and ask God to
[45:01] take this from us
[45:03] these are things that if we know we have
[45:05] it we have to lay it down all right we
[45:08] have to lay it aside that's that's what
[45:10] it says laying aside all malice all
[45:13] guile right and hypocrisy and envies and
[45:17] all evil speakings verse 2 says as
[45:20] newborn babes desire the sincere milk of
[45:23] the word that you may grow thereby if so
[45:28] be ye have tasted that the Lord is
[45:31] gracious in man verse 4 says to whom
[45:37] coming as unto a living stone disallowed
[45:41] indeed of men but chosen of God and
[45:46] precious ye also as lively stones are
[45:50] built up a spiritual house a holy
[45:52] priesthood to offer up spiritual
[45:55] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[45:59] Christ wherefore also it is contained in
[46:03] the scripture behold I lay in Zion a
[46:06] chief Cornerstone elect precious and he
[46:09] that believeth on him shall not be
[46:12] confounded verse 7 says unto you
[46:17] therefore which believe he is precious
[46:20] a man but unto them which be disobedient
[46:24] the stone which the builders disallowed
[46:27] the same as may the head of the corner
[46:30] and a stone of stumbling in a rock of
[46:32] offense even to them which stumble at
[46:35] the word being disobedient wherein to
[46:38] all so they were appointed and I love
[46:41] this because now the subject changes a
[46:44] man and verse 9 it says but ye are a
[46:48] chosen generation that means you're not
[46:50] the disobedient ones a man wearing two
[46:53] they were appointed but ye are a chosen
[46:55] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[47:00] nation a peculiar people that ye should
[47:05] show forth the praises of him who hath
[47:08] called you out of darkness into his
[47:11] marvelous light
[47:13] a man in verse 10 says which in times
[47:15] past were not
[47:16] people but are now the people of God
[47:19] which had not obtained mercy but now
[47:22] have obtained mercy amen we thank God
[47:25] for that mercy that he's given us amen
[47:28] let's have a word of Prayer before we'd
[47:30] approach our thought on tonight father
[47:33] God we thank you for this time of
[47:35] fellowship we thank you Father for the
[47:38] opportunity to stand before this portion
[47:41] of the bride of Jesus Christ here in Des
[47:45] Moines Iowa Lord and we just appreciate
[47:48] Lord the privilege to be able to come
[47:50] and be in fellowship and God we pray
[47:52] that as we come tonight that the Holy
[47:54] Spirit would take complete control of
[47:56] the thought that you would encourage the
[47:59] hearts of your people Lord the to is

[48:04] way into a rapture of God blessed a

[48:35] seated amen
[48:37] we want to use for our topic tonight
[48:40] chosen for royalty a man chosen for
[48:45] royalty
[48:47] there was a story that the prophet a man
[48:53] shared with us he told it two different
[48:55] ways depending on which tape you were
[48:57] listening to you were here at come two
[48:59] different ways one he tells it as this
[49:02] young boy going to his grandmother's
[49:04] house a man another way he tells it as a
[49:07] little boy going to his auntie's house
[49:09] no matter a man which way it was I think
[49:13] the main the main gist of the story is
[49:15] what happened when he got there to the
[49:17] house and what what brother Branham says
[49:18] that they lived in the in the country
[49:20] and there were things that were in this
[49:23] relatives house in the city that the boy
[49:25] never seen before right he never never
[49:28] experienced these things but
[49:30] or and and when he went to this
[49:32] relative's house he just began to just
[49:34] look around he was just really enjoying
[49:36] himself like wow I've never seen this
[49:38] and I never seen that this is this is
[49:40] just awesome just to be here and you
[49:42] know in this house and and I said you
[49:44] know he got to spot where he began to
[49:46] climb up some steps praise the Lord and
[49:48] as he was climbing up the steps a man
[49:51] the boy got to the top of the steps
[49:53] praise God and when he got to the stop
[49:56] top of the steps now this really blew
[49:58] him away amen when he finally got to the
[50:01] top of the steps he he looked and he
[50:02] looked at and there was something in
[50:04] front of him and he like now now what is
[50:08] this so maybe the boy might have took
[50:10] his hand and he did something like this
[50:12] and when he did like that he saw what
[50:14] was in front of him do the same thing he
[50:15] did and then maybe he did something like
[50:17] this and then he saw what was in front
[50:19] of him do the exact same thing he did
[50:20] and he say you know before you know it
[50:23] before he knew it there was a revelation
[50:25] struck the boar and he began to get
[50:27] excited and he told his mama he said
[50:29] mama and he looked at this this thing in
[50:32] front of him and say mama that's me
[50:36] hallelujah he was looking at a mirror
[50:38] and saw a reflection of himself and it
[50:41] was the first time ever that the boy
[50:43] recognized himself in the mirror
[50:46] hallelujah and and and I think brother
[50:49] Branham wasn't just sharing Amen those
[50:52] stories with us just to share those
[50:54] stories with us he brought that
[50:56] inspiration in for a reason amen because
[50:59] there had to come a time when we as the
[51:02] bride of Jesus Christ would be able to
[51:05] look into the scripture and be able to
[51:08] say mama that's me
[51:13] amen look at the scripture see yourself
[51:15] identify there hallelujah glory to God
[51:20] it brings a new recognition a new
[51:23] understanding when you can see yourself
[51:25] in the scripture hallelujah Peter says
[51:30] Amen to us in verse 9 of here first
[51:34] Peter chapter 2 it says but ye are a
[51:36] chosen generation a royal priesthood a
[51:41] holy nation a peculiar people that
[51:43] you should show forth the praises of him
[51:46] who have called you out of darkness into
[51:48] his marvelous light
[51:49] and as I read that scripture at my mind
[51:53] my mind just began to kind of reflect on
[51:56] the generations that have walked this
[51:58] earth people that lived here in a man
[52:01] and maybe some of the things that they
[52:03] experienced with God just moving for
[52:06] them in their generation
[52:07] they could have surely thought that they
[52:09] would have chosen generation at that
[52:11] time hallelujah
[52:13] I thought about Moses when a man he was
[52:16] chosen to be the deliverer
[52:18] hallelujah just go with me on this
[52:20] journey here a man on tonight my god
[52:23] hallelujah glory amen and that you know
[52:26] as as he was chosen to be the deliverer
[52:28] um you know I just thought about you
[52:31] know something about that about this
[52:33] when Moses was chosen
[52:35] there was nothing in this world that
[52:38] gets thought Moses from becoming the
[52:41] deliverer I want to tell you something
[52:45] if God has elected and God has selected
[52:48] you for a very specific work there is
[52:51] nothing that the devil can do that will
[52:54] stop you from fulfilling the purpose
[52:56] that God puts you on the earth here for
[52:58] hallelujah I want to tell you maybe some
[53:01] of you have been this close to death
[53:03] maybe a car accident maybe a man maybe
[53:07] even our being there in the end in the
[53:09] operating room and they thought they
[53:10] lost you but somehow you came back
[53:13] hallelujah I want to tell you the reason
[53:15] that you came back the reason that you
[53:17] can die in that car accident the reason
[53:20] that you can drown whatever it was that
[53:22] you faced the reason that you can do
[53:24] that because your purpose was your
[53:27] protection hallelujah God had a purpose
[53:30] for you and the very purpose that God
[53:33] had for you has been your protection
[53:35] that purpose has kept you on this earth
[53:38] hallelujah praise God hallelujah
[53:43] there was no crocodile that could stop
[53:46] Moses there was no snake dekha stopped
[53:49] Moses I don't care what Moses came up
[53:52] against he was gonna be the deliverer
[53:55] no matter how long it took for Moses to
[53:56] come to this place his purpose was his
[53:59] protection glory to God there he was a
[54:04] man floating down the Nile River oh and
[54:08] you know it's just a beautiful story
[54:10] when you even when you read it and how
[54:12] his parents put him out there - now his
[54:15] momma feeling the pressure of the day
[54:17] and realizing that she can't hold on to
[54:19] a boy so she she had to give him up to
[54:21] the nile river not nine really when
[54:23] she's given up to the now she's like
[54:24] Lord you take it and you do whatever
[54:26] you're gonna do with him and not knowing
[54:28] that God was gonna direct her basket
[54:31] right into the house of Pharaoh and not
[54:34] only direct a basket to the house of
[54:36] Pharaoh for Pharaoh's daughter the
[54:37] Raisinets own son but then he gave Moses
[54:40] mother a job in Pharaoh's house to raise
[54:45] her own son and get paid for it
[54:50] God know how to do things when you can
[54:54] just release it until my hands of God
[54:56] you'll be surprised what he'll do for
[54:58] you holy
[55:01] just think about this generation they
[55:04] had been in bondage for 400 years and
[55:06] have been praying for deliverer and
[55:08] finally this man Moses comes on the
[55:11] scene glory to God and for 400 years it
[55:15] would represent ten generations a man
[55:17] but now we have a generation that is on
[55:20] the earth that is that's finally
[55:22] receiving the opportunity to be released
[55:25] from the bondage of the Egyptians what a
[55:29] generation to live in what a generation
[55:32] amen to be alive in that they thought a
[55:36] plague strike Egypt they saw the dead
[55:39] things are passed through the land and
[55:40] strike the homes of those who refused to
[55:44] follow the words of the prophet Moses
[55:48] hallelujah the dead thing just struck
[55:51] the homes of those that refused to
[55:53] follow the prophet in that day a man in
[55:55] that same depth English strike today
[55:57] those that refuse to follow the word for
[56:00] this day as it has come through God's
[56:02] prophet listen this generation
[56:06] serious deliverance they experienced the
[56:08] parting of the Red Sea this generation
[56:11] saw death to the Egyptians that had them
[56:13] in bondage amen but this same generation
[56:17] died wandering in the wilderness rather
[56:20] than enjoying the Bliss of the land flow
[56:23] with milk and honey
[56:24] this generation failed it into the
[56:26] Promised Land but that generation gave
[56:29] birth to another generation now in their
[56:33] time they might what if they might have
[56:34] thought that they were the chosen
[56:36] generation at that time but look at all
[56:38] the things that experienced them they
[56:40] look at all the things that they missed
[56:42] hallelujah stay with me here tonight the
[56:45] next generation I thought about the ones
[56:47] that they gave birth to were under the
[56:49] ministry of Joshua hallelujah
[56:52] a man in here after experience in a man
[56:56] after entering the promised land this
[56:59] next generation experienced sons can
[57:02] steal moon hangover agile heart what a
[57:05] generation to live in to see the Sun
[57:08] stop for a full day what a generation to
[57:12] live in hallelujah maybe if you were
[57:14] living at that time you say we must be
[57:16] the chosen generation they think they
[57:19] saw Amen the sons tested they saw the
[57:22] parting of the waters of the Jordan just
[57:25] like their parents saw the Red Sea amen
[57:27] open up
[57:28] hallelujah this generation let out a
[57:30] great shout and saw the walls of Jericho
[57:33] come down and me before their day in for
[57:36] their time they thought they would
[57:38] consider themselves the chosen
[57:40] generation we go on and look at another
[57:43] generation that walked on the earth the
[57:46] firt they saw the first king of Israel
[57:48] come a man to the throne but they saw
[57:52] him also be anointed and rejected by God
[57:55] amen they saw David slay Goliath and
[57:58] eventually become the second king of
[58:00] Israel this a new Dame it was chosen a
[58:03] man they saw David Amen anoint Solomon
[58:05] there were so many so many positive
[58:07] things happening in salamis day that
[58:09] even that time the people said man we
[58:11] got to be the chosen generation can I
[58:16] come a little further
[58:18] I think of the believers that live
[58:19] during the time of the Lord Jesus oh my
[58:23] his first coming glory one would have
[58:26] thought that many would have been under
[58:28] expectation amen to see our Lord and
[58:30] Savior
[58:31] however they were only a few like Simeon
[58:33] and Anna and the wise men some shepherds
[58:36] who were blessed to welcome him though
[58:38] many experienced his power and his
[58:41] wisdom think about it I you know think
[58:44] about his wisdom when I figure out the
[58:46] woman caught in the act of adultery they
[58:49] bring this lady before Jesus and they
[58:55] say we caught her in the act of adultery
[58:58] and they had rocks in their hands and
[59:01] they're ready to stone them but we want
[59:03] to see Jesus the law tells us to do this
[59:05] a particular way but before we actually
[59:08] execute the law we want to see what
[59:11] you're going to say about hallelujah in
[59:15] the wisdom Jesus glory to God it just
[59:19] begins to write in the sand and they
[59:22] like my men now we got a case that we're
[59:24] presenting we have a situation here
[59:26] you're ignoring this by right in the
[59:28] sand what do you want us to do the law
[59:30] says do this he said he that's without
[59:33] seeing let him cast the first stone
[59:38] hallelujah and when went and just that's
[59:41] just one little sentence changed
[59:44] everything about the situation here
[59:46] that's without sin let him cast the
[59:48] first stone and I can see maybe one of
[59:51] the fellows said now now I'm no eager
[59:53] cash because he ain't got enough and he
[59:55] just drops his rock and then in the next
[59:58] hour I'm just dropping that nobody on
[1:00:00] Cassius don't everybody drop their rocks
[1:00:02] and walked away
[1:00:03] hallelujah maybe the devil is renting
[1:00:06] their cash from took some stones at you
[1:00:08] that is time for the devil to drop every
[1:00:10] Rock he danced without sin let him cast
[1:00:14] the first stone
[1:00:16] everybody drop rocks
[1:00:18] nobody could cast a stone it displayed
[1:00:20] Jesus knew if you caught the lady in
[1:00:23] adultery
[1:00:24] she can't commit adultery by herself so
[1:00:28] if you're only gonna bring her where's
[1:00:29] the other killed
[1:00:30] to party wisdom of Jesus it says it was
[1:00:35] sssss where are your accusers woman
[1:00:40] where are your accusers say I have no
[1:00:42] say neither do i qg but go and seeing no
[1:00:47] more
[1:00:48] hallelujah what wisdom a woman that had
[1:00:53] a death sentence on her receive life
[1:00:57] because she came into the presence of
[1:00:59] the right person hallelujah we all had
[1:01:03] deaf sentences on us but because we've
[1:01:05] come into the presence of Almighty God
[1:01:08] we can have life more abundant what a
[1:01:12] generation think about a man the woman
[1:01:16] at the whale how her life was turned
[1:01:19] around a man when she met Jesus at the
[1:01:22] whale glory to God think about the woman
[1:01:25] washing his feet glory to God the
[1:01:28] feeding of the 5,000 the feeding of the
[1:01:31] 4,000 the day was raised the blind were
[1:01:34] given their sight the death had their
[1:01:36] tongues loose yet the majority of this
[1:01:39] generation wanted him crucified think
[1:01:44] about it it should have been an exciting
[1:01:46] generation but to be identified with
[1:01:49] Christ during that time meant
[1:01:52] excommunication I think of the
[1:01:56] generation we come a little further I
[1:01:58] think of another generation that walked
[1:02:01] this earth before I got here a man is
[1:02:03] the generation that experienced a Sousa
[1:02:05] Street what a mighty move of God
[1:02:10] hallelujah amen in the gifts of the
[1:02:13] Spirit returning into the church I hope
[1:02:16] you are not afraid of the gifts a man
[1:02:19] that if it's in the Bible belongs to us
[1:02:22] I know Pentecost has made of disgrace of
[1:02:26] many of these things but it don't mean
[1:02:27] that it's not for us
[1:02:29] hallelujah church amen every gift that
[1:02:32] was spoken in Corinthians belongs in the
[1:02:34] body if they had in that Pentecost we
[1:02:37] should still have it now
[1:02:39] glory to God the Prophet taught us how
[1:02:42] to put these things in place but we
[1:02:44] don't have to be afraid of it anymore
[1:02:46] glory to God amen
[1:02:48] I think of a generation that experienced
[1:02:51] Azusa Street a great revival those that
[1:02:54] experienced a Welsh revival even what a
[1:02:56] mighty move of the Spirit of God amongst
[1:02:59] the people of God those revolvers gave
[1:03:02] birth to another generation that saw
[1:03:04] people moved from tent to tent amen they
[1:03:07] experienced the president got like never
[1:03:09] before
[1:03:09] hallelujah amen there were great healing
[1:03:12] revival sweeping the nation's people
[1:03:15] like Jack Coe and all Robertson Billy
[1:03:17] Graham and Tommy Hicks until Osborne
[1:03:20] they're just some of the ministers that
[1:03:22] God were using during that time and God
[1:03:25] was using them even during that time we
[1:03:27] had a mighty prophet on the scene
[1:03:31] hallelujah during the time of the great
[1:03:33] tent revivals many experienced the
[1:03:36] presence of Jesus Christ in the prophets
[1:03:39] meetings as was seen in Scripture he
[1:03:41] revealed the secrets and Amen of a heart
[1:03:44] and reveal the mysteries of God we still
[1:03:47] have our witnesses that alive that can
[1:03:49] tell us some of the testimonies that it
[1:03:51] saw hallelujah glory to God but I want
[1:03:56] to say something here even in that
[1:03:57] generation because I want to I mean
[1:04:00] brother Branham was already gone before
[1:04:03] I was even born so I have to make a
[1:04:07] statement here tonight with all these
[1:04:09] generations even a generation that got a
[1:04:11] chance to see the Prophet that
[1:04:13] generation was not the climax that
[1:04:19] generation was not the climax hallelujah
[1:04:24] stay with me here I wanna I wanna I want
[1:04:27] to say something here oh my god had
[1:04:32] another generation coming that was going
[1:04:35] to experience the greatest event that
[1:04:38] ever will happen on the earth now and I
[1:04:41] want to say this because the Prophet
[1:04:42] said it
[1:04:43] I don't want to spiritualize this amen I
[1:04:46] want to make it real the greatest event
[1:04:49] that will ever happened on the earth
[1:04:50] will be the second coming of the Lord
[1:04:52] Jesus Christ
[1:04:53] not just a word coming we appreciate
[1:04:55] that but I'm talking about the literal
[1:04:58] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:04:59] brother Branham said that the greatest
[1:05:01] event that whatever happened on earth
[1:05:03] would be when the second coming of the
[1:05:05] Lord takes place so the generation
[1:05:07] that's living to experience that it's a
[1:05:11] generation that Peter was talking to
[1:05:13] when they said ye are a chosen
[1:05:15] generation oh my let me just read
[1:05:20] something here to you the Prophet makes
[1:05:22] a statement a man out of the message the
[1:05:25] ephesian church age he says these seven
[1:05:27] messengers are making God known to the
[1:05:31] people he that receiveth them receiveth
[1:05:35] him that sent them it's on 1320 they
[1:05:38] speak and act upon his authority he
[1:05:41] stands behind them with all the power of
[1:05:43] the Godhead Matthew 28 verse 18 through
[1:05:47] 20 says and Jesus came and spake unto
[1:05:49] them saying all power is given unto me
[1:05:53] in heaven and in earth go ye therefore
[1:05:55] and teach all nations baptizing them in
[1:05:57] the name of the Father and of the Son
[1:05:59] and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to
[1:06:01] observe all things whatsoever I have
[1:06:03] commanded you and lo I am with you
[1:06:06] always even unto the end of the world
[1:06:08] the consummation of the ages so there
[1:06:10] they are full of the Holy Ghost and
[1:06:13] faith on fire with the fire of God
[1:06:16] holding forth the word of truth and
[1:06:18] there he stands to back them up
[1:06:21] amen and think of it look at what the
[1:06:24] Prophet says now think of it not one
[1:06:27] believer of any age knee cry and his
[1:06:31] heart o that I might have been back
[1:06:35] there in the first age when the
[1:06:37] Possible's were sent out so what he's
[1:06:39] saying we don't renounce for the look in
[1:06:41] the rearview mirror Amen we're not sure
[1:06:45] if we look at a rearview mirror we're
[1:06:46] bound to crash say don't look back and
[1:06:49] say oh I wish I would have been a part
[1:06:51] of the generation that Moses was there I
[1:06:54] wish I would have been a part of the day
[1:06:55] that Joshua was there I wish I'd have
[1:06:57] been a part when it when the first
[1:06:59] coming of the Lord Jesus I wish I'd have
[1:07:01] been there when brother Brennan would
[1:07:02] don't look back look up praise God look
[1:07:07] forward search he said there's no need
[1:07:10] to look back look up he says behold him
[1:07:14] who was even now walking in the midst of
[1:07:17] the churches through all ages he's still
[1:07:20] moving in the midst of the candlesticks
[1:07:22] glory to God they hold him who is the
[1:07:26] same yesterday and today and forever and
[1:07:29] who never changes either in essence or
[1:07:31] in his ways where two or three are
[1:07:34] gathered together in his name there he
[1:07:37] is
[1:07:37] in their myths and not only in their
[1:07:41] myths as a complacent own local or as a
[1:07:44] recording angel but there he stands
[1:07:46] expressing exactly what he is the light
[1:07:50] and sustainer and giver of all good gift
[1:07:53] to the church hallelujah hallelujah
[1:07:57] the prophet goes on and makes this
[1:07:59] statement and the message Shalom
[1:08:02] he says the hour is here it says if I
[1:08:06] could have been back there before the
[1:08:08] days that the world was created and
[1:08:11] looked down and seeing the whole thing
[1:08:13] my and the father had said to me what
[1:08:17] day would you want to live I would say
[1:08:23] now right now he would not have chosen
[1:08:28] Moses day he would not have chosen
[1:08:30] Noah's day he wouldn't have chose any
[1:08:33] other day but this day right now says I
[1:08:36] was saying now right now this is the
[1:08:39] hour he said this is the greatest hour
[1:08:43] that the church has ever moved into just
[1:08:46] before the coming of the bride oh I love
[1:08:50] that it says all the real Church of the
[1:08:53] Living God oughta be on fire burning
[1:08:56] with the light of the gospel being
[1:08:58] vindicated among them
[1:09:00] rise and shine for thy light for the
[1:09:04] light has come to you listen listen
[1:09:07] listen a statement says the light of
[1:09:09] this day he says Isaiah was the light of
[1:09:13] his day
[1:09:15] No was the light of his day why he had
[1:09:20] the word manifested and the gospel the
[1:09:23] Bible words for this day is the light of
[1:09:24] the day what a glorious time that we
[1:09:26] live in now as I as I as I looked at
[1:09:29] that inspiration just struck me if
[1:09:31] Isaiah was the light of his day Noah was
[1:09:36] the light of his day Moses would have
[1:09:39] been the light for his day
[1:09:41] Jeremiah would have been a light for his
[1:09:44] day Ezekiel would have been the light
[1:09:47] for his team and we can just bring it
[1:09:49] right on down the line right till we get
[1:09:51] all the way down to the Lord Jesus Jesus
[1:09:54] is the light of every day hallelujah but
[1:09:59] when the Lord Jesus moved on to seeing
[1:10:00] Paul became a light for his day i
[1:10:03] rainiest and Martin and Luther Colombian
[1:10:06] Wesleyan and all the seven message even
[1:10:09] brother Branham would have been the
[1:10:11] light for this day hallelujah but
[1:10:15] brother Branham is not here anymore
[1:10:17] so who where did the light go and
[1:10:20] brother wrote him laughs where did the
[1:10:22] light go
[1:10:23] Oh hallelujah oh I love my brother got
[1:10:28] his hand up because he recognized
[1:10:30] whether like wit if you don't know I'm
[1:10:32] gonna tell you where it is jesus said ye
[1:10:36] are the light of the world so you have
[1:10:40] become the light for this day
[1:10:42] praise God it's time for you to look in
[1:10:44] the scripture and say mama that's me
[1:10:52] you see I'm descriptive Matthew 5:14
[1:10:56] through 16 says ye are the light of the
[1:10:58] world a city that is set on a hill
[1:11:00] cannot be here neither do men light a
[1:11:03] candle and put it under a bushel but on
[1:11:06] a candlestick and it giveth light unto
[1:11:08] all that I in the house let your light
[1:11:11] shine before men that unit that they may
[1:11:13] see your good works and glorify your
[1:11:15] father which is in heaven as I thought
[1:11:19] about that quote I thought to myself
[1:11:22] what did it feel like when brother
[1:11:25] Branham picked up
[1:11:28] alakay for and realized that he was the
[1:11:32] very fulfillment of the scripture what
[1:11:36] did it feel like when he read revelation
[1:11:39] 10 7 it could look at the scriptures say
[1:11:43] mama mama that's me hallelujah and then
[1:11:52] it's okay for us to identify the prophet
[1:11:54] but like I said at the end in my opening
[1:11:57] when he shared the story by the little
[1:11:59] boy growing up and seeing himself in the
[1:12:01] mirror he was trying to get us to see
[1:12:03] ourselves in the mirror of the word of
[1:12:04] God because I mean it was a few years
[1:12:08] ago I looked at that scripture in first
[1:12:10] Peter amen chapter 2 verse 9 and when he
[1:12:13] said Ye are chosen generation something
[1:12:16] struck me I said mama
[1:12:20] that's me so how can Peter write this
[1:12:25] how how can Peter write worse like this
[1:12:28] I thought about this I you know I just
[1:12:32] took time to just really reflect on this
[1:12:34] Peter says ye are a chosen generation
[1:12:37] and I want you to understand Peter
[1:12:41] writes this in 1860
[1:12:44] these are years after the Lord Jesus has
[1:12:48] already come and going in here Peter is
[1:12:50] writing the words not now and I thought
[1:12:53] about Peter
[1:12:53] why did not why didn't Peter right I am
[1:12:56] a chosen generation and I'm going to go
[1:13:00] through his story in a little bit all
[1:13:01] the things that Peter experienced he did
[1:13:03] not say I he said he who was he talking
[1:13:09] to who was he writing this for what
[1:13:13] group was coming on the earth what
[1:13:15] generation was going to hit the earth
[1:13:17] that could look at that scripture a
[1:13:19] little differently than everybody else
[1:13:21] he was not writing this to Moses he was
[1:13:25] not rightness to Joshua he was not
[1:13:27] writing this to all the prophets that
[1:13:28] ago he was rightness to a future people
[1:13:30] he wasn't even writing to the people of
[1:13:33] his day and God thought so much about -
[1:13:40] he puts you in the scripture
[1:13:42] he puts you in the scripture I want you
[1:13:45] to look at this you know that the
[1:13:47] scripture says in 1st Peter 2:9 but G
[1:13:49] our children generation a royal
[1:13:51] priesthood a holy nation a peculiar
[1:13:53] people that she should show forth the
[1:13:54] praises of him who has called you out of
[1:13:56] darkness into his marvelous light
[1:13:58] now I took a a manor a little Liberty to
[1:14:01] go and look at that scripture a man in
[1:14:03] the emphatic dialect and the emphatic
[1:14:05] die Glocke is like the original
[1:14:07] translation into English a man for a man
[1:14:10] and here in an emphatic die Glocke it
[1:14:12] reads but you are a chosen race a royal
[1:14:18] priesthood a holy nation and then it
[1:14:22] says a people for a purpose you were
[1:14:26] born with a purpose in mind yeah your
[1:14:30] parents can not your mama could miscarry
[1:14:32] you you there is a purpose in line for
[1:14:37] you to be here a people for a purpose
[1:14:40] and you want to know what your purpose
[1:14:41] is the Bible says that you may declare
[1:14:44] the perfections of him who called you
[1:14:49] from darkness into his wonderful light I
[1:14:51] thought about that and I said no a
[1:14:53] chosen race is that was the offense if
[1:14:57] that was recorded in the original
[1:14:59] translation I thought about how the ends
[1:15:01] of the Lord came to the prophet and told
[1:15:04] him to pick up his pen and write and
[1:15:06] these words that then I'm going to read
[1:15:09] to you these were not the words of
[1:15:11] brother Branham but these were the words
[1:15:13] of an angel from heaven amen before you
[1:15:17] were born that angel had already written
[1:15:19] you a message recorded it through his
[1:15:22] prophets pen hallelujah you all I want
[1:15:27] you all I want to read that and see what
[1:15:28] did the angel after say to me in that
[1:15:32] message that the angel total profit
[1:15:34] picked up his pen he says in these last
[1:15:37] dates the true bride church Christ's
[1:15:41] feet will come to the headstone and she
[1:15:45] will be the super church a super race as
[1:15:51] she nears him
[1:15:53] they in the broad would be so much like
[1:15:56] him that they will even be in his very
[1:15:59] image I say amen to the angel I was born
[1:16:05] with a purpose I was as a as a young boy
[1:16:09] of a man and I want to say four or five
[1:16:13] years old I remember playing around the
[1:16:16] pool and as I was playing around the
[1:16:19] pool I had some cousins that were they
[1:16:21] couldn't swim in the deep end and I
[1:16:23] couldn't swim at all but there they were
[1:16:24] I settled down and in the shallow end
[1:16:27] just kind of enjoying themselves and I
[1:16:29] was walking around and around the pool
[1:16:31] and I would throw a rock in and I was
[1:16:32] scooped the rock out and I throw a rock
[1:16:34] getting I'm gonna scoop the rock out and
[1:16:36] I throw it in and then I got brave I
[1:16:38] went down to the deep man six feet of
[1:16:40] water couldn't swim but I'm just on the
[1:16:41] outside I throw a rock and I scoop it
[1:16:43] out and I throw it in scoop it up this
[1:16:45] time say I'm gonna let it go a little
[1:16:46] deeper and I threw it down and I tried
[1:16:48] to scoop it out this time I fell in and
[1:16:51] all I remember is waking up in the arms
[1:16:55] of a fireman and I and I remember you
[1:17:00] know because they told me say it said
[1:17:02] Jack you fell in
[1:17:03] we couldn't swim to get you and and and
[1:17:07] and and what happened there was a at
[1:17:09] that time there was a lifeguard she
[1:17:11] wasn't on duty and she just happened to
[1:17:13] be skating by the pool at the time that
[1:17:16] I fell it she couldn't even get both of
[1:17:18] our skates off the time so she just took
[1:17:19] one skate off jumped in the pool I don't
[1:17:22] even know the lady never met her but
[1:17:25] that one day she was there for a purpose
[1:17:26] and she took one skate off jumped in the
[1:17:31] pool reached down and got me out of the
[1:17:34] pool and all I remember to say that the
[1:17:36] police were there firemen were there
[1:17:37] medics were there and and I just I was
[1:17:40] landing and a fireman's arms and all
[1:17:42] these people around and somehow they
[1:17:44] revived me and I came back I don't I was
[1:17:46] out for I don't know how long for all
[1:17:48] those people to get that that time I
[1:17:50] don't know how long I was out but I know
[1:17:52] this much God had a purpose for me
[1:17:55] and the devil could not kill me before
[1:17:59] my purpose was for feel one of God's
[1:18:03] purposes was for me to be in the morning
[1:18:05] preaching this message tonight
[1:18:07] hallelujah and I know the devil tried to
[1:18:10] cut me off many times but God got my my
[1:18:14] my my purpose my very purpose that God
[1:18:17] had me born for has been my protection
[1:18:21] [Applause]
[1:18:23] and many of you all have the same
[1:18:25] testimonies you are people for a purpose
[1:18:30] glory to God glory to God we start
[1:18:34] thinking about how God has kept us in
[1:18:36] our darkness watched over us our goddess
[1:18:38] protect us we can't help but worship Him
[1:18:39] a man a man we don't we don't you know
[1:18:42] we don't need me I tell the church back
[1:18:44] home I can praise him by myself
[1:18:46] he's been so good to me I can worship by
[1:18:48] myself a man a man I do feel like David
[1:18:53] some time old magnify the Lord with me
[1:18:55] and let us exalt his name together but I
[1:18:59] know how to praise him by myself
[1:19:01] when I just think about how good he's
[1:19:03] been to me hallelujah he's worthy of my
[1:19:07] priests worthy of the glory think about
[1:19:11] this tonight here Peter writes these
[1:19:14] words ad 60 he writes the script in
[1:19:19] first Peter 2 and and I thought about it
[1:19:22] why why why didn't Peter write I am
[1:19:26] right Peter Peter Peter was a part of
[1:19:31] the group that saw the first coming of
[1:19:33] the Lord Peter his first encounter with
[1:19:37] Christ
[1:19:38] a man was in Luke 5 where Peter was a
[1:19:42] little discouraged when he came to
[1:19:43] church he brother branham say he was
[1:19:46] sitting on a stump and as he was sitting
[1:19:49] there he was wondering you know they've
[1:19:51] been fishing all night they caught
[1:19:52] nothing and he comes to the stump and he
[1:19:55] says son it says well I just wonder what
[1:19:58] this guy's gonna say I wonder what this
[1:20:01] preacher got to say you know and as they
[1:20:04] sitting there listening to Jesus and
[1:20:05] okay says something good and the crowd
[1:20:07] start getting larger
[1:20:09] argent larger and Jesus is backing up
[1:20:11] and and getting further away from the
[1:20:13] people - he's standing in the water
[1:20:14] preaching to the people and finally gets
[1:20:17] this fight he says Peter if you don't
[1:20:19] mind can I get inside your boat
[1:20:21] Peter just happened to have his boat
[1:20:23] parked in the right place can I get
[1:20:26] inside your bows like yeah yeah you can
[1:20:27] get in my boat in Jesus dance and he
[1:20:29] preaches to the people and then right
[1:20:31] when it when he closes the servants says
[1:20:33] Peter let's go fishing they may let's
[1:20:36] launch out into the deep and and get
[1:20:38] some fish and Peter says now Jesus I
[1:20:43] understand your ministry as a preacher
[1:20:46] and and I can appreciate that but I'm a
[1:20:49] fisherman and what I know is that the
[1:20:51] fish are not biting right now there's no
[1:20:53] need for us to go out there I've already
[1:20:55] been out there I called nothing but but
[1:20:57] but but let me tell you now since I'm a
[1:20:59] fisherman I understand nothing gonna
[1:21:01] happen when we go out here he said but
[1:21:03] nevertheless at thy word I'll go drop my
[1:21:08] net Peter goes out the word for Lord
[1:21:11] Jesus and caught so many fish II could
[1:21:13] handle it
[1:21:14] what a generation of living experienced
[1:21:17] something like this Peter
[1:21:20] I saw his mother-in-law healed in this
[1:21:22] very hour that jesus prayed for her
[1:21:25] Peter Peter Peter I think about him and
[1:21:30] you know just just so many things he was
[1:21:32] there with the five thousand being fed
[1:21:34] and there were the four thousand be fed
[1:21:36] saw miracle after miracle so Lazarus
[1:21:38] being raised from the dead
[1:21:39] amen even in the house when gyruss
[1:21:41] daughter came Peter was there
[1:21:44] experiencing all this and you would
[1:21:46] think that Peter would write in the
[1:21:47] scripture I am the chosen generation
[1:21:49] Peter experienced something that no
[1:21:52] other man on earth experienced go back
[1:21:58] and look at in Matthew 14 here Jesus
[1:22:03] said just finished feeding the 5,000 he
[1:22:05] sent the disciples onto the water say
[1:22:07] let's go onto the other side and let's
[1:22:09] do some things over there and and and
[1:22:11] and Jesus didn't get in the boat with
[1:22:13] them and the Bible said that the that
[1:22:15] the winds were were contrarian so this
[1:22:18] was a stormy condition that the railways
[1:22:21] were contrarian and the
[1:22:23] days were just overflowing in the boat
[1:22:25] and here now here the disciples are
[1:22:26] trying to roll and then as they're
[1:22:28] rolling they see Jesus come walking on
[1:22:31] the water they thought it was a ghost
[1:22:33] they thought it was a spirit I said they
[1:22:34] say man I didn't know we've never seen
[1:22:36] nothing like this could this be Jesus
[1:22:39] you say yes it's I it's I Peter Peter
[1:22:43] Peter put Jesus to the test Peter says
[1:22:47] lord if it be thou he experienced
[1:22:52] something that no other man ever
[1:22:53] experienced it it be that fears one
[1:22:57] thing for Jesus to walk on water but
[1:22:59] it's another thing when a man born like
[1:23:01] you a man born like me begin the walk on
[1:23:05] water that's a different thing and I'm
[1:23:07] not Pete Peter say if it be down then
[1:23:10] bid me come now notice Jesus didn't take
[1:23:13] time to explain to Peter how to do this
[1:23:16] he didn't he didn't even give him a
[1:23:19] paragraph he didn't give him a little
[1:23:22] book to read amen on how you walk on
[1:23:24] water nothing he just gave him one word
[1:23:29] one words Peter say if it be thou bid me
[1:23:32] come and all they heard from the Lord
[1:23:35] Jesus was come now he thought he was
[1:23:41] putting Jesus to the tests but now the
[1:23:43] Lord Jesus had to put him to the test
[1:23:45] you said if it be thou bid me come I
[1:23:50] just respond it come and I can see Peter
[1:23:58] on the boat the waters are choppy the
[1:24:03] wind is against him it's just now Jesus
[1:24:06] is walking on the sea in a stormy
[1:24:08] condition not when it was calm while it
[1:24:12] was trouble that's when Jesus does his
[1:24:15] best work
[1:24:19] so if you going through a troubled time
[1:24:21] right now look for God to do his best
[1:24:24] work I see Peter just on the side of
[1:24:29] book now y'all y'all heard him say come
[1:24:32] Andrew John y'all heard him with Matthew
[1:24:35] got hurt
[1:24:36] that's what he said come here and I can
[1:24:39] see Peter just maybe take one foot put
[1:24:42] it down on the water and he got still
[1:24:43] one foot in the boat one foot on the
[1:24:45] water because I don't know if just gonna
[1:24:47] work or not put a little weight on it
[1:24:50] it's holding me I'm going boys you begin
[1:24:55] to step out on the water and he begin to
[1:24:56] walk you would think this man would say
[1:24:59] and the chosen generation but he's
[1:25:02] walking he says no no he doesn't say I
[1:25:04] said yeah and as he's walking and he's
[1:25:07] walking next thing you know he looks and
[1:25:09] and uh now he was already walking in
[1:25:13] stormy conditions but he looks at the
[1:25:15] wave and say that I shouldn't be out
[1:25:17] here
[1:25:17] he was already walking in those
[1:25:20] conditions there was no need to doubt so
[1:25:23] as we begin to seek them here's our lord
[1:25:26] save me the Lord Jesus reaches down and
[1:25:29] picks north now this is just me this is
[1:25:32] just me I don't believe that Jesus
[1:25:36] picked up Peter put him on his shoulders
[1:25:39] and carried him back to that boat I
[1:25:41] think Jesus said if you were walking
[1:25:43] before you're gonna keep walking spin up
[1:25:47] Peter and let's walk back to this Punk
[1:25:50] because the Bible say when they were
[1:25:54] when they got back to the boat that's
[1:25:57] when the storm ceased you want to know
[1:26:02] when Jesus wants you to start walking in
[1:26:04] the midst of your store
[1:26:09] [Applause]
[1:26:12] not not when it gets calm in the midst
[1:26:15] of your storm
[1:26:15] recently I was listening to a testimony
[1:26:18] of her brother you know brother Brandon
[1:26:20] spoke to that storm in Colorado he spoke
[1:26:23] to it when it was stormy conditions not
[1:26:26] when it was quiet you want to know when
[1:26:30] the greatest miracles always happened
[1:26:32] when a great trial is is upon you so
[1:26:36] don't run from the trial don't run from
[1:26:38] the trial count it all joy Oh blessed be
[1:26:43] the name of the Lord Peter walked on
[1:26:45] water the only man that could that was
[1:26:49] born like us to say I did it had
[1:26:52] witnesses there and you would have
[1:26:55] thought a man that experienced all these
[1:26:57] things say I am the chosen generation
[1:27:01] but he didn't write that
[1:27:03] you said ye are can I go a little
[1:27:05] further about Peter this saying Peter
[1:27:07] that experience all this was the same
[1:27:10] guy that denied Jesus three times and on
[1:27:14] the third time change this language
[1:27:17] start cursing think about it
[1:27:20] think the same man and now we're not
[1:27:23] lying I want Peter you know denied him
[1:27:25] and he start cursing I don't even know
[1:27:26] him no I'm not a part of that group I
[1:27:28] know no I don't believe the message
[1:27:30] y'all stay with me here I don't believe
[1:27:34] the message no no no I'm not with that
[1:27:36] group I mean Peter just absolutely did
[1:27:38] not the Lord Jesus now I want you to
[1:27:40] think about this because when Peter
[1:27:43] walked away from the message for his day
[1:27:45] when Peter did not the word for his day
[1:27:48] we probably would have been a part of
[1:27:50] group would say Peter would never preach
[1:27:51] in my church again
[1:27:55] but when Jesus rose again he has
[1:28:00] specific instructions go tell my
[1:28:04] disciples
[1:28:07] and he uses a specific name and peeta
[1:28:12] he knew Peter was discouraged he knew
[1:28:15] Peter felt defeated but don't tell my
[1:28:18] disciples and Peter I will meet them in
[1:28:21] Galilee not only did he call this name
[1:28:26] Shona he was identified with them I want
[1:28:29] to tell you something
[1:28:30] your failures cannot disqualify you from
[1:28:35] sonship I want to say that again your
[1:28:39] failures cannot disqualify you from
[1:28:43] sonship Peters failures his denial did
[1:28:48] not disqualify him from being a son of
[1:28:50] God and Peter not only was he chosen by
[1:28:54] the Lord Jesus said go tell him the
[1:28:56] meatman Galilee now know that when it
[1:28:57] got to the Upper Room came out this man
[1:29:01] that failed God became the spokesman on
[1:29:05] the day of Pentecost not only that he
[1:29:09] let him write scripture that would
[1:29:11] identify us for the day that we live in
[1:29:14] the man that failed the man that did not
[1:29:17] the word the man that rejected the
[1:29:21] message for his day be careful who you
[1:29:25] rejected who you talk about you don't
[1:29:28] know how God had use them
[1:29:35] can we go a little further Oh glory to
[1:29:38] God I I question why with Peter right ye
[1:29:44] are all the things that he experienced
[1:29:46] he could have easily said I am he said
[1:29:50] ye and I looked at this the reason that
[1:29:53] Peter could say that is because Peter
[1:29:57] saw the second coming of the Lord it was
[1:30:00] revealed to him by the Lord Jesus as
[1:30:02] well as angel the Lord spoke to him
[1:30:04] about the second coming Lord and when
[1:30:06] Peter got a glimpse of the second coming
[1:30:07] Lord because brother Branham said that
[1:30:08] would be the greatest event that would
[1:30:10] ever happen when Peter got a glimpse of
[1:30:12] that Peter knew that that generation
[1:30:14] that lived during that time to
[1:30:15] experience the second coming of the Lord
[1:30:17] that generation would be the chosen
[1:30:19] generation Peter saw it in Matthew 17
[1:30:22] verse 10 through 13 look at this and his
[1:30:27] disciples this is the Lord Jesus
[1:30:29] actually showing this is Mount
[1:30:30] Transfiguration experience coming out of
[1:30:33] this his disciples asked him saying why
[1:30:35] then say the scribes that Elias must
[1:30:38] first come and jesus answered send them
[1:30:42] Elias truly shell first come and restore
[1:30:46] all things verse 12 but I say unto you
[1:30:51] that Elias has come already and they
[1:30:53] knew him not but have done unto him
[1:30:55] whatsoever they listed likewise shall
[1:30:58] also the Son of man suffer them and
[1:31:01] verse 13 says dinner the sight was
[1:31:02] understood but he spake unto them
[1:31:05] of John the Baptist Jesus speaks in this
[1:31:10] these verses of two comings of Elijah
[1:31:13] there's one Elijah that will come and
[1:31:17] restore all things that's at the second
[1:31:19] coming of the Lord
[1:31:20] and then there was Elijah that had
[1:31:22] already come amen and then the disciples
[1:31:25] understood he was talking about John the
[1:31:27] Baptist now unfortunately there are
[1:31:28] people today that try to bring both of
[1:31:30] these Elijah's and they try to tie them
[1:31:32] into John the Baptist and my question a
[1:31:36] mentor anybody that tries to do that I
[1:31:38] said if John the Baptist fulfilled the
[1:31:40] part of restore all things tell me what
[1:31:44] did John restore
[1:31:48] except to a particular brother he says I
[1:31:51] haven't studied that and I wanted to
[1:31:54] tell him there is nothing to study
[1:31:57] because that part of that verse was not
[1:32:00] talking about John the Baptist it was
[1:32:02] talking about Elijah that would come
[1:32:03] before the second coming of the Lord
[1:32:05] Jesus hallelujah and if you want to ask
[1:32:08] me what did that Elijah restore because
[1:32:11] he has already come and go I can tell
[1:32:14] you things that he restored he restored
[1:32:16] the mystery of water baptism is it
[1:32:19] father son Holy Ghost or in the name of
[1:32:21] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:32:23] he was thought what happened in the
[1:32:25] Garden of Eden with the serpent seed the
[1:32:28] original sin
[1:32:29] we were lost we were thinking apples and
[1:32:31] apricots and all kind of other things
[1:32:33] but he restored the truth of what
[1:32:35] happened in the Garden of Eden hello he
[1:32:38] restored Godhead G Hoover of the Old
[1:32:42] Testament is Jesus of the New Testament
[1:32:45] he restored the truth of marriage and
[1:32:48] divorce he ain't even talked to us about
[1:32:50] the baptism the Holy Ghost without sin
[1:32:53] safety
[1:32:54] hallelujah you can receive without
[1:32:57] sensation you should care that some
[1:32:59] might receive it with so I might receive
[1:33:00] without but it will produce a change in
[1:33:02] your life I can tell you that much here
[1:33:04] is he told us that there will be no
[1:33:06] eternal hell there's only one form of
[1:33:09] eternal life and that's true long as
[1:33:11] that's that's true the life that you
[1:33:12] have through Jesus Christ he restored
[1:33:14] the mystery of the rapture the shop was
[1:33:17] this message going forth the voice of
[1:33:19] the Resurrection that called Lazarus
[1:33:21] from the grave that same voice has
[1:33:23] called us out of dead denominations and
[1:33:25] and things of the world that we are in
[1:33:28] the midst of a raptor right now many
[1:33:30] don't even realize it and the Trump is
[1:33:33] calling us to a marriage supper the
[1:33:36] Prophet restored these truths in the
[1:33:38] Word of God and there's so many other
[1:33:40] things that he restored we thank God for
[1:33:42] that I want you to I want you to just
[1:33:45] stay with me here on this a man this is
[1:33:48] not a message to Patmos vision says
[1:33:52] notice before Jesus returns to Earth
[1:33:54] this is a little head of time but the
[1:33:56] spirit of Elijah will return back to the
[1:33:58] earth and turn the hearts of children
[1:33:59] back to the father's the Bible says
[1:34:02] Jesus saw him here the pasta saw him
[1:34:05] here the order of the coming of the Son
[1:34:07] of man glorified he's to be glorified
[1:34:09] and coming back the first thing before
[1:34:12] they saw him was what Elijah then what
[1:34:15] Moses Israel returning yonder the
[1:34:18] lawkeepers and then the glorified son of
[1:34:20] man hallelujah do you see the order of
[1:34:22] his coming the spirit of Elijah or the
[1:34:24] witness of the LAT of the last church eh
[1:34:26] see coming in power to manifest him we
[1:34:31] realize a man what that scripture meant
[1:34:34] when Jesus said that you know he told he
[1:34:37] told Peter there jesus answered 7 him
[1:34:40] Elijah's truly shell first come restore
[1:34:42] all things that was pertaining to
[1:34:44] brother Brandon's ministry has come he's
[1:34:46] gone and we're fellowship and around
[1:34:47] this truth around the light that God has
[1:34:50] given us for this day but that light
[1:34:52] that we're feeding on is reflecting now
[1:34:54] out of us stay with me here I said we
[1:35:01] are chosen for royalty
[1:35:04] chosen for it God had purpose that's why
[1:35:07] every time the devil tried to wipe you
[1:35:09] out no matter where it was he couldn't
[1:35:11] do it because God had a purpose for you
[1:35:14] sometimes we go through life but we
[1:35:16] don't feel chosen we don't feel chosen
[1:35:20] we feel like we're failures I feel like
[1:35:24] why would God even waste his time but
[1:35:29] we're chosen and I want to tell you a
[1:35:32] story about a young man that probably
[1:35:34] also didn't feel too chosen but yet he
[1:35:36] was chosen for royalty this man a
[1:35:39] prophet was sent to his house prophet
[1:35:44] Samuel God said I've rejected this guy

[1:37:07] his daddy didn't even consider him as
[1:37:12] one of the sons to be anointed you want
[1:37:17] to know how I can tell you that because

[1:38:07] he's come to anoint the next king in the
[1:38:09] house and all of us have gone through
[1:38:11] the line to be anointed and nobody
[1:38:13] received the north's and so the Prophet
[1:38:14] said do we have one more board dare to
[1:38:16] say you was the last boy we got to bring
[1:38:19] you to the house in order to appease the
[1:38:22] prophet all right David comes into the
[1:38:28] house to anoint instruct the front
[1:38:30] I can see before he even picked up the
[1:38:32] Horn of oil that the oil is seeping out
[1:38:37] anointed this floor now but and his
[1:38:39] brothers were God had every one of his
[1:38:41] brothers to be there to be a witness
[1:38:44] that David was chosen for royalty father
[1:38:50] he picked it up and as he just poured it
[1:38:53] just a over floor or going all over the
[1:38:55] image and that's what we need here at
[1:38:57] higher ground is a it's an overflow of
[1:39:00] the oil just being poured out I'm
[1:39:03] expecting that this weekend hallelujah
[1:39:07] [Applause]
[1:39:08] here David chosen for royalty nobody had
[1:39:12] any confidence in him but yet God knew
[1:39:15] what was in David he had to wait till he
[1:39:18] coming to that - into the throne but yet
[1:39:20] he was chosen for royalty I want to tell
[1:39:23] you no bear could kill David until he
[1:39:27] comes to the throne no lion could kill
[1:39:30] David until he comes you know even while
[1:39:33] you were a sinner y'all don't hear that
[1:39:37] either while you were a sinner God was
[1:39:41] protecting you your purpose was your
[1:39:44] protection even while you were sinner
[1:39:46] and do you know when David went to face
[1:39:50] Goliath that David was the only man in
[1:39:54] the camp of Israel that could fight
[1:39:57] Goliath and not die the only warrior
[1:40:05] that could go against Goliath and not
[1:40:07] die if David would have died in battle
[1:40:10] God would have had to raise David up
[1:40:13] because God had already placed a promise
[1:40:16] on top of David that he would be the
[1:40:19] next king what protection what
[1:40:24] protection when we're protected by these
[1:40:27] promises we walk differently we live
[1:40:30] differently we act differently
[1:40:32] hallelujah glory to God how we love you
[1:40:37] Lord Jesus I want I want to just kind of
[1:40:39] share something with you here oh my mom
[1:40:43] this a statement here out of here you
[1:40:47] him he says Galatians one tells us that
[1:40:50] we were Podesta nated to the adoption of
[1:40:53] sons by Jesus Christ predestinated of
[1:40:55] God though many are called but few are
[1:40:57] chosen
[1:40:58] the chosen was chosen at the beginning
[1:41:00] now but we are predestinated to the
[1:41:02] adoption of children by of God by Jesus
[1:41:05] Christ in other words to you Bible
[1:41:06] scholars what I'm trying to say is a
[1:41:08] placing of a Sun the Sun was
[1:41:11] positionally placed and today the church
[1:41:13] has gone on for year after year after
[1:41:15] year and when we see God calling man out
[1:41:19] one of his sons and positionally places
[1:41:21] him and makes him his son and recognizes
[1:41:25] it before the public then we turned that
[1:41:27] son down and say he's a divine healer or
[1:41:29] holy ruler don't you see see Church oh I
[1:41:33] don't know what the remedy is I don't
[1:41:36] know how did ever get back to this place
[1:41:38] but that's the way our attitudes are
[1:41:41] towards that person if the ministry is
[1:41:43] of God God will vindicate that ministry
[1:41:47] if it isn't of God then God would have
[1:41:51] nothing to do with it
[1:41:54] chosen for royalty brother Branham said
[1:41:58] there's certain truths that we need to
[1:41:59] emphasize and I wanted to come here to
[1:42:01] Des Moines and emphasize this truth
[1:42:03] there's a scripture that brother Branham
[1:42:06] takes us to in revelation 1 and 5 also
[1:42:09] verse 6 a man he gives us the scripture
[1:42:13] and I just I just love it I want to just
[1:42:15] read it here and then I'll bring a quote
[1:42:18] here and we'll find a way to get it to
[1:42:20] bring ourselves out revelation 1 and 5 I
[1:42:23] want you to just just just meditate on
[1:42:26] this 5 and 6 and from Jesus Christ who
[1:42:33] is the faithful witness and the first
[1:42:36] begotten of the dance and the Prince of
[1:42:39] the kings of the earth unto him that
[1:42:43] loved us and washed us from our sins in
[1:42:49] his own blood
[1:42:52] this is not your blood that did it but
[1:42:54] this is the blood of Jesus Christ that
[1:42:56] did it
[1:42:56] and I want you to understand what it did
[1:42:58] for you hallelujah amen the brother
[1:43:01] Branham says that as a statement that he
[1:43:05] makes here that I want to just kind of
[1:43:06] give to you before we go to next that
[1:43:09] next verse Oh glory to God if I can just
[1:43:12] find it
[1:43:12] oh my mind says we're kept saved by the
[1:43:15] Blount
[1:43:16] Amen we're kept saved he says he wasn't
[1:43:19] you wasn't saved by the blood but you're
[1:43:21] kept saved by the blood you were saved
[1:43:23] by grace through faith believing it look
[1:43:26] at this now look at this because this
[1:43:28] blood does something for you by being
[1:43:30] washed in his own blood verse 6 tells us
[1:43:33] that he hath made us and hath made us
[1:43:39] the blood did this right have made us
[1:43:42] kings and priests unto God and his
[1:43:46] father to him be glory and Dominion for
[1:43:50] ever and ever amen
[1:43:52] that means you are not supposed to be
[1:43:54] the popper right you're not supposed to
[1:43:56] be a man just dismiss this this this
[1:43:59] with this attitude that poor me you are
[1:44:01] a king and a priest the blood of Jesus
[1:44:04] Christ has made you royalty Oh
[1:44:08] hallelujah when you when you realize
[1:44:11] that you're royalty you have to act like
[1:44:13] royalty you have to walk like royalty
[1:44:16] you have to talk like royalty
[1:44:18] hallelujah amen the blood of Jesus
[1:44:21] Christ has brought you to this place
[1:44:24] prophecies this the Prophet says this in
[1:44:27] the message a man who says he hath made
[1:44:31] us this is not a revelation of Jesus
[1:44:34] Christ
[1:44:34] it says he hath made us he says oh there
[1:44:38] are certain truths we need to improvise
[1:44:41] this is one of them he had he hath made
[1:44:45] us salvation is his doing salvation is
[1:44:49] of the Lord all of grace he redeemed us
[1:44:52] for a purpose he bought us for a purpose
[1:44:55] we are kings oh I love that spiritual
[1:45:00] kings oh we are we are going to be Kings
[1:45:03] upon the earth with him
[1:45:04] when he sits on his throne but now we
[1:45:07] are spiritual kings and we reign over
[1:45:09] spiritual Kingdom
[1:45:10] it says in Romans 5:17 for if by one
[1:45:13] man's offense death reigned by one much
[1:45:15] more they which receive abundance of
[1:45:17] grace and of the gift of righteousness
[1:45:19] shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ
[1:45:22] and in Colossians 1:13 who have to live
[1:45:25] it us from the power of darkness and
[1:45:27] hath translated us into the kingdom ring
[1:45:29] of his dear son beasts this next
[1:45:33] statement is very powerful to me the
[1:45:34] Prophet says this right now we reign
[1:45:38] with Christ having dominion over sin the
[1:45:43] wall the flesh and the devil
[1:45:48] [Applause]
[1:45:50] brother I'm struggling with this
[1:45:52] struggling with what a king don't
[1:45:55] struggle with nothing amen
[1:45:59] a king a struggling with nothing they
[1:46:01] may a king realizes he has Dominion
[1:46:04] right so so he says right now we reign
[1:46:07] with Christ having dominion over sin the
[1:46:10] world of flesh and the devil showing
[1:46:12] forth his praise and glory shark lost
[1:46:14] himself for it is Christ in us willing
[1:46:16] and doing of his good pleasure yes
[1:46:18] indeed even now we are seated in
[1:46:21] heavenly places in Christ Jesus I love
[1:46:23] that now I've thought about this if he
[1:46:28] made me a king and priest hallelujah I
[1:46:32] mean I mean I'm chosen for royalty and
[1:46:36] not only that I know that there are
[1:46:38] other places in scripture that support
[1:46:40] this I'm if I'm a king I'm act like one
[1:46:45] I'm a talk like one you know I'm gonna
[1:46:48] give you something here revelation 17:14
[1:46:52] says these shall make war with the lamb
[1:46:55] and the lamb shall overcome them for he
[1:46:56] is Lord of lords and King of Kings and
[1:46:59] they that are with him are called chosen
[1:47:02] and faithful if he is king of kings my
[1:47:06] question is who are the other kings
[1:47:10] well mama
[1:47:14] mama that's me
[1:47:19] if you are king you have to conduct
[1:47:22] yourself like a king this is the conduct
[1:47:25] of a king even though he is a great man
[1:47:27] he makes others feel greater Jesus the
[1:47:31] creator of the world washed the feet of
[1:47:33] the disciples he made others feel great
[1:47:35] when a king feels bad he still looks
[1:47:41] good when a king feels bad he still
[1:47:49] looks good brother branham told us a
[1:47:50] story of the of King George that was in
[1:47:52] Africa I'm sorry in Canada the man was
[1:47:55] feeling bad didn't really want to get up
[1:47:56] in that in that car and ride but he said
[1:47:59] as the king he had to look good so when
[1:48:03] a king feels bad he still looks good
[1:48:06] hallelujah amen a king is the final
[1:48:10] authority so when a king speaks there is
[1:48:14] no questioning what he says that's why
[1:48:18] Jesus said if you say to the mountain be
[1:48:21] thou removed and be thou cast into the
[1:48:23] sea and don't doubt in your heart you
[1:48:27] can have what you say why because the
[1:48:29] king have spoken and when a king
[1:48:32] releases his word he can take it back
[1:48:35] you understand that a king can take it
[1:48:38] back I mean you know when they come
[1:48:39] against Daniel and Daniel's they say now
[1:48:41] now you know the king you wrote this you
[1:48:43] sound that we are Signet you can't take
[1:48:45] it back
[1:48:46] a king can't change what he spoke that's
[1:48:50] why King has to be careful what he
[1:48:51] speaks can I tell you another thing a
[1:48:58] king keeps his head up even in dire
[1:49:01] situations brother branham told us a
[1:49:04] story about the African slave here he
[1:49:08] comes to a land that he probably never
[1:49:11] have a chance to go back home again but
[1:49:14] his attitude in the midst of whatever he
[1:49:16] was faced they couldn't understand why
[1:49:17] is this boy's head always up and why's
[1:49:19] he always got a good attitude and you
[1:49:21] know I mean you know they say do you
[1:49:23] feed them different from the other
[1:49:24] slaves no no no no we don't feed him in
[1:49:26] a different
[1:49:26] he's the same he get same as them say
[1:49:28] well once you set up something I'm not
[1:49:30] selling him I'm keeping him I got to
[1:49:33] keep him I can't let him go so why is he
[1:49:35] so different from everybody else what'd
[1:49:37] he say well I had the same question
[1:49:38] y'all hey I got to ask him some
[1:49:40] questions I come to find out that in his
[1:49:44] homeland this boy is the son of a king
[1:49:50] hallelujah so he has to conduct himself
[1:49:53] like the son of a king even though he
[1:49:56] may never see his father again it was
[1:49:58] instilled in him that I got to act like
[1:50:02] a king holy I could be the next king so
[1:50:05] I gotta act like a king I gotta walk
[1:50:08] like a king I gotta talk like a king I
[1:50:10] can't carry myself like the common
[1:50:12] people I'm royalty and as the bride of
[1:50:18] Jesus Christ we are royalty
[1:50:20] we've been washed in his blood and he
[1:50:24] has made us kings and priests sometimes
[1:50:33] I might not feel like it sometimes it
[1:50:36] may not look like it but that's who I am
[1:50:40] the Prophet says this and we'll bring it
[1:50:43] home here and Jehovah Jireh says what
[1:50:46] are all our conduct to be not like the
[1:50:49] world but we should act like sons and
[1:50:51] daughters of God conduct ourselves like
[1:50:53] Kings children not like slaves of
[1:50:56] fashions and slaves of passion and
[1:50:59] slaves of pride we should be sons and
[1:51:02] daughters of God and act like it and
[1:51:03] conduct ourselves that way
[1:51:05] let our conversations and everything be
[1:51:07] seasoned with God's Spirit I got eight I
[1:51:11] am statements that I want to say over
[1:51:13] myself and I want to say it over you as
[1:51:15] well I am the very righteousness of God
[1:51:19] according to second Corinthians 5:21
[1:51:22] I am loosed by the perfect blood of
[1:51:25] Jesus and no one can lay any charge
[1:51:28] against me according to Romans 8 and 1
[1:51:30] verse 33 to 34 I am an heir to all God's
[1:51:35] power and omnipotence so therefore I
[1:51:38] need not to fear according to the church
[1:51:40] amen I may not have the material
[1:51:44] resources to fall back on them but I am
[1:51:46] rich and in spite of it all hallelujah
[1:51:50] my security lives in Christ who is my
[1:51:52] shield and exceeding great reward
[1:51:55] according to revelation 2:9 Genesis 15 1
[1:51:58] and the church age book and also says I
[1:52:01] am a I am more than a conquerer
[1:52:05] quarter-turn Romans 8:37 and that the
[1:52:08] sixth was Jesus said I will walk with
[1:52:10] Him and white because I am worthy
[1:52:14] revelation 3 4 also I am the very elect
[1:52:18] and I cannot be deceived according to
[1:52:22] Matthew 24:24
[1:52:23] and this last when I I want you all to
[1:52:27] repeat it after me say this I am a king
[1:52:31] and a priest and I have dominion over
[1:52:37] sin the world my flesh and the devil
[1:52:43] come on let's give God praise we've
[1:52:46] chosen for royalty hallelujah
[1:52:49] Oh glory to God Church we got to think
[1:52:54] about this we got to think about this as
[1:52:56] I looked at that description first Peter
[1:52:59] - I said Lord this just means so much
[1:53:02] more to me now why would Peter write
[1:53:04] words like this
[1:53:05] why would I say things of this nature
[1:53:08] it's because Peter was looking at a
[1:53:10] group I believe Pete I believe God
[1:53:14] showed Peter glimpse of what was
[1:53:15] happening in des moines this group of
[1:53:18] people that would look at that scripture
[1:53:20] one time maybe I'm reading all your life
[1:53:22] but then oh mama that's me it's not just
[1:53:28] not just words on a printed page but old
[1:53:31] Peter was writing to me what did it feel
[1:53:34] like we're brother branham ricketts not
[1:53:36] recognize himself in the scripture
[1:53:38] what joy must have flooded to show his
[1:53:40] soul what joy should flood our souls
[1:53:43] because we see ourselves in the Word of
[1:53:46] God a chosen generation a royal
[1:53:48] priesthood a holy nation a peculiar
[1:53:50] people a people for a purpose
[1:53:54] let's pray Lord Jesus how grateful we
[1:54:02] are Lord that the Word of God could be
[1:54:07] written in such a way father years
[1:54:13] before we would even come to this earth
[1:54:15] that you would have something there
[1:54:17] waiting for us to see Lord that would
[1:54:20] quicken a man the depths of our soul God
[1:54:24] this message that you sent us through
[1:54:26] your prophet Lord was was sent there to
[1:54:29] quicken something in our in our souls Oh
[1:54:31] God it wasn't the message did not come
[1:54:34] to be an alternative to denominations
[1:54:37] but God it was to bring our hearts turn
[1:54:40] our hearts back to the truth the Word of
[1:54:42] God Lord and now we see our position the
[1:54:46] Prophet even told us that once the bride
[1:54:48] recognized us who she is
[1:54:50] then the rapture will go god I pray to
[1:54:54] the people father with a man would come
[1:54:56] to understand a man that that this is
[1:54:59] what you've called them - this is what
[1:55:01] you've chosen for this is why no
[1:55:03] delicate stopped them until they come
[1:55:05] they till they came to this place Lord
[1:55:07] to recognize themselves in Scripture
[1:55:09] Lord as we see ourselves may we walk
[1:55:12] different may we talk different may be
[1:55:13] active and we live different God may we
[1:55:16] live like royalty because we have been
[1:55:18] chosen for royalty God we love you we
[1:55:23] praise you we honor you we thank you for
[1:55:26] who you are to us God
