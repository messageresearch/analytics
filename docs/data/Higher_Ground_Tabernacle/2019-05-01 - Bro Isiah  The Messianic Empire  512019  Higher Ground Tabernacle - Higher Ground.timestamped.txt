[12:20] as we stand I need to make a few
[12:28] announcements but I'll do that after the
[12:30] service after the word has come forth
[12:41] revelations the first chapter
[12:48] revelations one
[12:58] we read the fifth and sixth verse of
[13:00] Revelations one there will read
[13:04] revelations five nine through ten
[13:07] revelations one five and six and from
[13:13] Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness
[13:16] and the first begotten of the Dead and
[13:20] the Prince of kings of the earth unto
[13:27] him that loved us and washed us from our
[13:31] sins in his own blood
[13:35] and have made us kings and priests unto
[13:39] God and his father to him be glory and
[13:43] Dominion for ever and ever amen
[13:48] hmm that's really sweet
[13:52] amen revelations five nine and ten and
[14:00] they sang and they sung a new song
[14:03] saying God worthy to take the book and
[14:08] to open the seals thereof for thou was
[14:13] slain and has redeemed us to God by thy
[14:18] blood out of every kindred and tongue
[14:20] and people and Nations and have made us
[14:26] unto our God kings and priests and we
[14:31] shall reign on the earth
[14:34] let us pray I have any father we come
[14:39] before you humbly as we know how we
[14:42] thank you for your goodness we thank you
[14:47] for your grace and your mercy Lord we
[14:50] pray that you would have preeminence
[14:53] tonight Lord I pray God that you would
[14:58] give us uh pterence as your Holy Spirit
[15:02] will move upon us cleanse us from all
[15:06] unrighteousness if there be anything I
[15:08] have said done or thought
[15:11] that would hinder the service father God
[15:14] washes clean forgive us of our sins
[15:18] everything about us is wrong but
[15:21] everything about you was right we say
[15:23] amen to the truth of the word Lord let
[15:27] thy Holy Spirit break in the straw every
[15:29] yoke of the enemy
[15:30] lord I pray that you were quicken our
[15:34] minds our bodies and our souls that we
[15:38] may see you tonight
[15:40] in Jesus Christ name we pray amen
[15:43] you may be seated
[15:52] first of all I give honor to our Lord
[15:55] and Savior Jesus Christ I think the air
[15:57] is kicked on already I don't know maybe
[16:00] it was just me feeling the fire but I
[16:02] feel okay right now
[16:04] amen we thank God for His goodness we
[16:08] thank God for His grace and I think the
[16:14] more I began to study and the more I
[16:16] began to see this message and who I am
[16:23] what I have come to do and understand my
[16:28] work cannot be work unless I work by him
[16:31] as Jesus Christ Himself said I can't do
[16:37] nothing except the father showed me he
[16:40] worketh and therefore I work it to my
[16:46] Lord saw visions and so he saw and
[16:50] understood exactly what his father
[16:52] wanted him to see but the Bible says
[16:56] that they that are led by the Spirit of
[16:59] God they are the sons of God I began to
[17:06] see by God's grace that salvation is
[17:09] more powerful than anybody sometimes we
[17:13] just forget how great it is and I think
[17:16] the more we move into it began to
[17:18] venture out into it we'll begin to see
[17:21] that Calvary was more about more than
[17:24] just a man dying raising from the dead
[17:29] but his ministry was a Ministry of
[17:33] reconciliation a ministry of restoring
[17:39] restoring what back to us the things in
[17:44] which we had lost by way of the fall
[17:48] coming into this age of evil age were
[17:53] Satan seemed to dominate the political
[17:56] realm the spiritual realm and seemed
[18:01] like every other Ram
[18:03] the only thing that he does not have
[18:05] control over is the kingdom of God there
[18:11] is an empire but the Branham call it the
[18:16] Messiah Empire and that's what I want to
[18:21] speak on tonight so that we understand
[18:25] that we have come to conquer everything
[18:30] that Satan has done we've come to tear
[18:33] it down we've come to put it under our
[18:36] feet we come to take back and to take
[18:41] over what the thief has stolen from us
[18:48] but the only way that we can accomplish
[18:51] this is that we must have faith in God
[18:56] to believe that we are what he says we
[19:00] are we are not just servants but in the
[19:06] second-handed road brother Branham says
[19:07] that the servant of God has to call on
[19:10] God he has a depend on God not his
[19:14] church not his robe he has to depend on
[19:19] God and God asking him to do the
[19:24] impossible and in order to do the
[19:27] impossible
[19:28] you've got to call on God for power of
[19:31] God to perform the impossible and if we
[19:36] be the Messiah's servant we have to have
[19:41] the Messiah's power and he promised us
[19:46] in the word is that right I am the vine
[19:50] and ye are the branches
[19:51] I energize every branch that brings
[19:56] forth fruits I like that word energize
[20:00] because you can be whipped you could be
[20:04] limps but once energy comes in it
[20:09] restores that branch to its original
[20:12] state you and I must know by God's grace
[20:18] where we come from if we know where we
[20:23] come from as I said a few services ago
[20:25] if you could understand your origin if
[20:28] you can take it back to where you came
[20:31] from then you can understand where
[20:33] you're going
[20:36] it's amazing that even Lucifer who when
[20:41] God created had a different beginning
[20:45] and when I say that he wasn't a part of
[20:50] God as such he was just the creation but
[20:56] you and I was more than what Lucifer
[20:58] started out to be because we are what we
[21:03] say a rotation off of God we were in him
[21:08] and because of Adam's failure in his
[21:14] faults we realized Amen we became
[21:19] perverted creatures that's only only out
[21:24] of shell but inside the inside God
[21:29] protected his heritance 1st Corinthians
[21:36] the 6th chapter 9 through 11 says know
[21:40] ye not that the unrighteous shall not
[21:43] inherit the kingdom of God be not
[21:48] deceived neither fornicators nor
[21:52] idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate
[21:57] nor abusers of themselves with mankind
[22:01] not nor thieves nor covetous nor
[22:06] drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners
[22:10] shall inherit the kingdom of God he goes
[22:16] on and he names all of these things and
[22:19] mine you Paul is talking to the church
[22:22] of Corinthians more than likely most of
[22:26] these people had already been baptized
[22:28] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[22:31] perhaps some of them had the holy ghost
[22:35] we're about only God knows but Paul
[22:39] began to just identify all of these
[22:42] fruits of unrighteousness because
[22:46] sometimes we who are under grace take
[22:50] grace for granted and that grace then
[22:54] becomes this grace Corinthians church as
[22:58] we know was full of folly they were what
[23:03] we call a counter church but they yet
[23:06] still belong to God it wasn't that they
[23:09] couldn't be straightened
[23:10] but somewhere they got off the beaten
[23:13] path and Paul said after he named all of
[23:19] these things and said Amen that they
[23:21] would not inherit the kingdom of God he
[23:24] began to say and such were some of you
[23:29] hello and such were not some such you
[23:35] are but sir you were some of you were
[23:40] but ye are washed what was Paul saying
[23:45] these things because we forget that we
[23:50] have become we are can't become to be a
[23:53] new creature not something patched up
[23:56] but a brand new creature but yea washed
[24:02] but ye are sanctified but ye are
[24:06] justified in the name of the Lord Jesus
[24:11] and by the spirit of our God
[24:16] now he said in that name and by that
[24:20] spirit there's no other way to be
[24:23] justified there is no other way to be
[24:26] sanctified because remember our
[24:29] righteousness is as filthy rags it has
[24:33] to be the working of the Holy Spirit
[24:37] look what God has done many of us amen
[24:41] can identify with some of these things
[24:44] if not
[24:45] all of these things why because the
[24:47] Bible said we had all sinned and come
[24:49] short of the glory of God and all of
[24:53] this was not a mistake everything has
[24:56] been because God purposed it to be so
[25:00] but you and I we have a greater hope we
[25:06] have something that we can hold on to or
[25:09] rather it holds on to us because the
[25:12] Bible said in that while we were yet
[25:14] sinners Christ died for us
[25:17] now that is a love that you and I can
[25:20] not even comprehend that while we were
[25:24] yet sinners Christ died for the ungodly
[25:29] hallelujah that means while we were out
[25:33] there doing what we used to do God had
[25:38] us in line when he was on Calvary
[25:43] hallelujah
[25:44] ha because we're family why because
[25:51] we're family and because we are family
[25:58] he redeemed us just the other day I was
[26:04] thinking about God and thinking about
[26:06] the Lord and thinking about perfection
[26:08] yesterday and the Lord directed me to
[26:15] Joseph and said that Joseph forgave his
[26:20] brethren where did you get those scars
[26:25] where did you get those wounds in the
[26:29] house of your friend and so was it with
[26:34] Jesus Jesus was betrayed and treated bad
[26:39] and mocked by his own brethren but it
[26:43] was there Jesus who hung on the cross
[26:45] and said Father forgive them for they
[26:48] know not what they do
[26:50] and then when I began to see Stephen
[26:53] Stephen means crowd and I looked at
[26:58] that word who said there it is here was
[27:01] Steven an offshoot off our part of the
[27:05] original Church and evidently P of
[27:10] Steven had come to a place where God
[27:14] thought he was ready so that he was
[27:18] ready that he was full of divine love
[27:23] hallelujah
[27:24] before Paul even came to preach it
[27:28] Steven had already reached that place
[27:31] where God wanted him to be how do you
[27:35] know when your crown would divine love
[27:37] you can say like Steven Lord all these
[27:42] things not to their charge you can say
[27:46] like Jesus forgive them father for they
[27:49] know not what they do
[27:51] you can be like Joe's up don't harm
[27:54] yourself God did this for the saving of
[27:59] Israel see that's where God is taking us
[28:05] he's taking us to a place with these
[28:08] little mere lines of ours can't even
[28:11] comprehend we've never gone this way
[28:13] before and God is directing us he's
[28:16] leading us into a perfect place but you
[28:20] and I must have died to our selfishness
[28:23] we must allow the Holy Spirit to uproot
[28:26] every bitterness every anger everything
[28:30] that you have harbored within yourself
[28:32] because let me tell you something those
[28:34] are the kinds of things that clogs up
[28:37] the flue the pipe the place that leads
[28:43] to the area that God wants to get into
[28:45] it's blocked by these ideas in your mind
[28:49] that you have a right to be so
[28:52] hallelujah we have no more rights when
[28:56] we gave our lives to Christ we we
[28:59] fulfill it all of our rights and we gave
[29:03] them to God and therefore we must allow
[29:07] ourselves to surrender to his holy
[29:11] spirit is that all right and when we
[29:15] surrender to him God can then move
[29:17] through your being and he began to shine
[29:21] that light in those dark places and then
[29:25] when is when you overcome when you
[29:28] surrender you overcome because the
[29:31] greatest enemy is you hallelujah so you
[29:38] and I must understand there is an empire
[29:42] something that God is working with he's
[29:45] establishing his kingdom here on earth I
[29:50] thought about how Hollywood celebrates
[29:54] their celebrities the Emmy and the
[29:56] Grammy and whatever kind of else they
[29:58] have out there red carpets and all that
[30:00] and all you see is glamour all you see
[30:05] is Satan's devices hallelujah and they
[30:09] think that those rewards of the greatest
[30:12] thing that they could ever have we are
[30:15] we have a greater ceremonies coming
[30:18] hallelujah
[30:20] that will make these Emmys and these
[30:22] Grammys look like nothing why because we
[30:27] are the celebrities of heaven oh come on
[30:31] honey we are the celebrities is that
[30:35] right Oh most of us we can hardly wait
[30:38] till we see Noah
[30:39] we can't Halle wait till we see Abraham
[30:42] we can't Holly wait till we meet Sarah
[30:44] all of those who have gone on before us
[30:47] and listen people what were they doing
[30:50] they were literally impersonating the
[30:53] Holy Spirit Christ for their day they
[30:57] are the real actors is that right
[31:01] because it was God Christ big in live
[31:05] and praying in the past his purpose was
[31:10] that right it's too true because when
[31:13] Jesus went down into the LA region he
[31:17] asked those who fail to listen to Noah
[31:21] why did not you hear my message
[31:26] that could've easily say but we didn't
[31:28] we don't remember you but he could
[31:31] easily say but yes I was there
[31:34] hallelujah I was a very voice of Noah
[31:38] and when you wouldn't hear Noah you did
[31:41] hear me Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[31:45] today and forever Hebrews 13 and they
[31:48] can never be changed God is God and the
[31:54] Bible tells us in this kingdom in this
[31:59] Empire everything works by the name of
[32:05] Jesus Christ there is no other name
[32:08] devices no other name given under heaven
[32:11] whereby we must be saved but the name of
[32:13] Jesus and every knee shall bow and every
[32:16] tongue shall confess that he is Lord
[32:21] hallelujah is that right not just in
[32:25] heaven but things on earth things under
[32:28] the earth that means he'll must bow to
[32:32] the name of Jesus Christ that means it
[32:39] meant there's power in that name and the
[32:42] Bible says the whole of heaven and earth
[32:45] is named after him see what I'm saying
[32:49] it is an empire it is a kingdom the
[32:53] ruler of this kingdom is Jesus Christ
[32:56] himself
[32:59] is that right when he rose from the
[33:01] babys is all power in heaven and earth
[33:04] is given unto me and then it began to
[33:06] say ah you shall receive power after
[33:10] which the Holy Ghost is come upon you
[33:12] that's why the devil don't want us to
[33:15] have the real Holy Ghost he doesn't mind
[33:18] if we have religion he doesn't mind if
[33:20] we have church energy he doesn't mind
[33:22] amen we have a isms our schisms outcries
[33:26] out doctrine hallelujah but when it
[33:28] comes to the rear bar he don't want you
[33:31] to have that because he knows that once
[33:34] that comes in he's a defeated foe
[33:38] completely defeated hallelujah he
[33:42] realized at the time that God seals it
[33:45] with the Holy Ghost you become his Lord
[33:49] he doesn't want that hallelujah
[33:54] remember quoted that some time ago
[33:56] brother Brennan said that Jesus Christ
[33:59] defeated Satan at Calvary with sweetness
[34:03] and meekness Oh somebody help me here
[34:08] see people what this is not a time to
[34:11] fight this is not a time to fight it is
[34:17] not a time to be worried about somebody
[34:20] else's doctrine somebody help me here
[34:24] you see because you and I will save by
[34:27] grace and if Satan can get you
[34:30] distracted hallelujah
[34:34] you will be the man that will fall hello
[34:39] because you and I must understand God is
[34:42] moving of people into perfection nothing
[34:48] but perfection not by your might not by
[34:52] your power and not by your spirit is
[34:55] only his spirit hallelujah can we move
[34:58] into the listen is that the truth you
[35:00] can't get into this Empire unless you
[35:04] have the Holy Ghost and you can't go up
[35:06] to heaven and get into heaven unless you
[35:09] have the Holy Ghost hallelujah because
[35:12] his empire is the Holy Ghost the kingdom
[35:18] of God is not meat and drink but is joy
[35:23] peace and righteousness well in the Holy
[35:26] Ghost
[35:28] when you talk about an empire it city
[35:32] we're working with the supreme power in
[35:34] governing supreme that means there's
[35:38] nothing above it it is the alternate is
[35:41] that there's nothing above it now i'ma
[35:44] say this the Bible said that name of
[35:47] Jesus happen hardly exalted
[35:51] come on Salani I had a young brother say
[35:54] this to me the other day a brother in
[35:56] the message he said I used to be
[35:57] Catholic he said and we admired Mary we
[36:02] worship Mary just like some of the
[36:04] people do brother branham he said and
[36:07] when I see somebody leaning toward that
[36:10] he said I won't even come to church to
[36:14] listen to a preacher that's trying to
[36:17] make him God will somebody help me imma
[36:20] get in trouble here hallelujah because
[36:23] it's really the same spirit you don't
[36:27] have to say Amen but it's true anyhow it
[36:29] is the same spirit there's only one Lord
[36:33] and one Savior hallelujah and his name
[36:37] is Jesus Christ
[36:38] that's what brother Branham preached it
[36:44] is an empire it is a powerful system
[36:47] that God is working in his people but to
[36:50] see God can't use coward soldiers he can
[36:55] use those who want to retreat he can't
[36:59] use those who run with a Worley
[37:01] hallelujah he's looking for a man
[37:05] somebody who's stand straight on his
[37:08] word and be not afraid to call it like
[37:11] it is huh
[37:13] he says now in the Old Testament we know
[37:18] Church was called the kingdom of God he
[37:23] said the kingdom of God now I'm taking
[37:25] this from the chronology of the Bible
[37:29] the Old Testament the church was called
[37:32] the kingdom of God in other words God is
[37:34] a king and the church is his domain
[37:37] God's kingdom Old Testament in the New
[37:40] Testament is called the messianic Empire
[37:44] oh I like that messianic in other words
[37:48] the Messiah's Empire where the Messiah
[37:53] rules and reign no denominational
[37:57] barriers are nothing the Messiah rules
[38:01] in his Empire isn't that wonderful
[38:04] thinking messianic and para therefore
[38:08] the church is not an organization the
[38:10] church is not a gathering of the people
[38:13] the church is the people of God that's
[38:16] been called out of the world to show in
[38:19] another Kingdom five identifications
[38:23] that's where it's located you hear what
[38:25] I'm saying
[38:26] so you saw brothers what do you say God
[38:30] has called us out and now he's calling
[38:33] us in too so that we can become the
[38:37] master of our circumstances hello
[38:44] somebody Jesus was the master of his
[38:49] circumstances there was nothing that
[38:53] could take him of God or make him sin he
[38:58] was the master he was the Lord of all of
[39:03] his circumstances who even when things
[39:07] came upon him unaware because he was a
[39:12] man and there he was entered into his
[39:16] ship the Bible says and his sin side was
[39:19] followed him and behold there arose a
[39:22] great tempest in the sea in so much that
[39:25] the ship was covered with the ways but
[39:28] he was asleep hallelujah that the ship
[39:32] was covered with ways but he was a sheep
[39:35] sleep and his disciples came to him and
[39:37] awoke him saying lord save us we perish
[39:42] can it be can you believe that you in
[39:45] the boat with Jesus and you still
[39:47] thinking you're gonna perish you're in
[39:50] Christ and you still think you're gonna
[39:52] perish no matter what's don't come upon
[39:56] you when you are in Christ there's no
[40:01] way you can perish and he said unto them
[40:04] why are ye so fearful o ye of little
[40:07] faith
[40:08] fearful the Bible says none of the
[40:11] fearful shall enter into that City I'm
[40:14] afraid I'm gonna be low none of the
[40:16] fearful
[40:18] hallelujah I'm afraid I'm gonna fall
[40:20] none of the fearful hallelujah oh ye
[40:27] little slay faith then he rose and
[40:30] rebuked the wind in the sea and there
[40:32] was a great calm hallelujah if you don't
[40:36] fear death
[40:36] that's can take somebody help me here
[40:40] but no she's not a real Eisenmann many
[40:43] people die prematurely
[40:46] because they are afraid of chaos are
[40:48] afraid of death afraid of these diseases
[40:52] but understand this you must become a
[40:55] master you must become a ruler come on
[41:01] somebody
[41:01] he made us kings and priests whew and
[41:06] the King has to have a kingdom Oh
[41:11] hallelujah
[41:13] why are you fifth all ye little faith
[41:16] then he arose and rebuked the winds and
[41:18] the sea and there was a great calm is
[41:22] that right but I said that demons was in
[41:25] those that storm hallelujah he looked
[41:28] beyond the circumstance and he saw what
[41:30] was causing it and he went straight for
[41:32] the juggler peace be still
[41:38] but the men Marvel saying what manner of
[41:42] man is this but they didn't understand
[41:44] when he opened that see in the waves
[41:48] obeyed him he was not speaking like a
[41:50] man he was speaking like God it wasn't
[41:53] the man who calmed the scene
[41:55] it wasn't a man who stopped that the
[41:58] waves it was God hallelujah hallelujah
[42:03] hey this is hey what manner of man is
[42:08] this that even the wind and the sea obey
[42:11] Him they would steal carnal they would
[42:15] steal connell because all they could see
[42:17] was a man hallelujah and that's what's
[42:22] wrong with a lot of people now that's
[42:24] all they can see is a man and look at
[42:28] the proper guardians all i can see is a
[42:29] man

[51:05] battles getting hard seem like you don't
[51:08] know which way to turn but think about
[51:10] it the Bible said with every temptation
[51:12] God has always made away we take her
[51:15] linearly or sometimes we feel like Moses
[51:18] backed up against
[51:19] we see all these things coming at us
[51:22] don't scream don't cry speak the word
[51:24] and go for hallelujah he's made us kings

[51:56] when his children wasn't living right up
[51:58] the sacrifice was right hallelujah it's
[52:01] not by power not by might but by my
[52:04] spirit said the Lord is all about you
[52:09] believe in who you are he said that's
[52:13] what we are
[52:13] he said amen to him be glory and
[52:16] Dominion forever and ever is that right
[52:19] listen he said we will rule on the earth
[52:22] not just in the Millenium because we
[52:26] rule here we rule this you must prove
[52:30] you are king is that right supreme power
[52:37] in governing you got it you got to stay
[52:40] connected first of all he said that that
[52:42] that life will energize you the Holy
[52:45] Ghost come to energize you every day get
[52:48] energized is that right we don't let our
[52:51] causes run out of gas we know that if I
[52:54] call run out of gas it's going to stop
[52:56] so is it with you if you let your body
[53:00] your vessel run out of the gas of the
[53:03] Holy Ghost it's going to stop hallelujah
[53:07] is that all right each age lived there
[53:11] he lived there age live there message
[53:14] we're not nothing different we're not
[53:16] gonna get by every age lived their
[53:20] message that's what the probably God
[53:22] says in evening messenger he says each
[53:25] age had its message and messenger God
[53:30] has seen to that even in the church
[53:33] we find out that each one had a
[53:35] messenger and each one lived their age
[53:37] and another one come in and that one
[53:40] went out and another one come in and on
[53:43] down to the seventh church age each scar
[53:46] each angel of the church each messenger
[53:50] and see we find out excuse me at the
[53:53] last church age over in Revelation 10
[53:56] there's to be a trumpet sound and there
[53:59] were seven voices they were not
[54:00] permitted to write but it was seven on
[54:03] the backside of the book the seven seals
[54:06] were on the back side of the book and
[54:08] after the book is written then it's
[54:10] sealed back there with seven seals now
[54:12] no one know what they are but it said in
[54:16] the day of the seventh angel sounding
[54:18] forth his message that earthly angel now
[54:20] because this angel came down from heaven
[54:23] and this was was on earth an angel is a
[54:26] messenger a messenger to the aged and we
[54:29] notice now we know with all these things
[54:31] about that rainbow sign and all of those
[54:34] things but you see it didn't say well
[54:36] you know it didn't make just a trumpet
[54:38] sound there's a message those voices has
[54:41] something to say and all the Prophet God
[54:45] did was tie into loose ends from all the
[54:48] way from from Paul all the way up to the
[54:51] Pentecostal age and his very age and he
[54:54] brought the puzzle in the picture back
[54:56] together so that we can see that Jesus
[54:59] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[55:02] forever and if the puzzle had been
[55:05] restored that means the body has been
[55:07] restored that means the power of the
[55:09] bodies restored that means our Holy
[55:11] Ghost is back in the body that means we
[55:14] must do the same watch the same thing
[55:16] with the same power the same gives the
[55:19] same everything everything hallelujah
[55:25] live voices God ain't interested he's
[55:30] got people dancing and shouting speaking
[55:31] in tongues and everything else
[55:32] everywhere hallelujah God God would
[55:36] rather you sit quiet and not say nothing
[55:38] and live it then this child every
[55:42] service and be hypocritical
[55:45] somebody help me here is that right
[55:48] that's the way guardian God came back to
[55:51] restore to us the light that Adam had
[55:55] and Adam was ruler that right
[56:00] the winds obeyed Adam everything obeyed
[56:04] Adam the trees obeyed Adam he was the
[56:07] master of his circumstances hallelujah
[56:11] when God raised up Moses what was he
[56:13] doing he was teaching Moses has to
[56:16] become the master of his circumstances
[56:19] God brought in opposition on moses
[56:23] without even telling him that he was
[56:26] going to do it Wow he wanted Moses who
[56:29] realized that the world he had was
[56:31] master the master of all circumstance
[56:35] when Janna's and Jambres came to outdo
[56:39] Moses guess what happened
[56:40] Moses serpents swallowed up James and
[56:43] Jambres every time I don't care was an
[56:47] intellectual giant this word will
[56:51] swallow with him up hallelujah Wow
[56:54] because if not Crete it's not some
[56:57] intellectual but it's by revelation when
[57:00] you have revealed and God has revealed
[57:02] himself to you you know he's gone that
[57:06] was a thing that kept Moses while he
[57:08] didn't run away
[57:09] he knew he met the pillar fire he knew
[57:12] him that God hallelujah and so all fear
[57:16] was taken from Moses little boy hey
[57:22] that's what he said oh we need in terms
[57:24] of your thousands of live voices the
[57:26] thunder of God thundering out in
[57:28] sweetness and holiness purity undefiled
[57:32] eyes walking around in the earth today
[57:35] without a blemish well yes sure real
[57:38] Christians that's thunders against the
[57:41] enemy the devil don't care how loud you
[57:44] can holler the devil don't care how much
[57:45] you can jump or how much you can do this
[57:48] or shout but that hurts the devil but
[57:52] what hurts the devil is to see that
[57:54] sanctified holy life
[57:59] that right consecrated to God saying
[58:02] anything to him call him anything just
[58:06] as sweet as he can be and moves right on
[58:09] that throws him away see that thunders
[58:12] that that shakes the devil hallelujah
[58:15] you see what I'm saying a real Christian
[58:18] I'm sorry I'm I'm spitting everywhere
[58:19] because I had coffee before coffee
[58:21] drives you out but nevertheless it was
[58:23] good but nevertheless you and I must
[58:26] realize by God's grace we have alive and
[58:29] this message is bringing us into that
[58:32] life hallelujah
[58:33] we would have never learned and knew
[58:35] what we know now had it not been for the
[58:39] seventh angel messenger hello the
[58:44] probably God couldn't be he couldn't be
[58:47] nothing else his purpose was he born a
[58:50] prophet his purpose was had to be it he
[58:55] couldn't run away from it he didn't have
[58:57] the visions to show up they showed up
[59:00] well he liked it or not hallelujah he
[59:03] was called to that hallelujah that's why
[59:06] you can't help but to be this bride you
[59:09] can't help but to believe this message
[59:11] hallelujah it is your purpose for which
[59:13] God has made you you can't get away from
[59:16] it if you wanted to Oh
[59:19] God knows I don't want to woo is this
[59:25] okay you got to keep these things in
[59:27] mind
[59:28] Paul says listen Antichrist is going to
[59:31] come into this place he said they are
[59:33] already here John said they were gonna
[59:36] come john said they're already here and
[59:38] what was they doing they were disguising
[59:40] themselves as angels of light I mean if
[59:43] you look at the Corinthian church you
[59:45] can actually see the Antichrist moving
[59:47] everybody wanted to speak in tongues
[59:49] everybody want to prophesy everybody
[59:52] wanted to do something want that
[59:53] recognition and the devil always won't
[59:56] recognition hmm the devil almost we
[59:59] always want to be recognized for doing
[1:00:01] something hallelujah but not Jesus Jesus
[1:00:06] they don't tell nobody
[1:00:07] amen he don't want the recognition
[1:00:10] hallelujah
[1:00:11] remember that's the way the Christ is
[1:00:13] but when it comes to people and you
[1:00:16] won't recognize where he should he
[1:00:17] should have polluted me I should have
[1:00:18] been a bishop but that's how it is in
[1:00:23] that denomination or I'm quitting the
[1:00:25] church to see because I've been a
[1:00:26] preacher for a long time I've been held
[1:00:27] it for years and they won't promote me
[1:00:29] to be a bishop polos thing a man didn't
[1:00:33] know he was a bishop all along
[1:00:34] hallelujah glory to God now let me move
[1:00:37] on god don't care you know people don't
[1:00:41] want recognition is that right the brass
[1:00:43] is Lord when did we visit the sick when
[1:00:46] do we feed the poor when we win win win
[1:00:48] win win we don't know when see they were
[1:00:52] so busy about their father's business
[1:00:54] they didn't want no red didn't need the
[1:00:56] high class names hallelujah the only one
[1:00:59] I want to get recognition from is Jesus
[1:01:01] Christ my lord hallelujah
[1:01:07] Paul says listen I'm gonna die free
[1:01:10] second Peter first you know how it talks
[1:01:12] about the virtues but I'm gonna skip
[1:01:14] some of it because I'm just going
[1:01:15] quickly for if these things being you
[1:01:18] talk about the virtues here you know
[1:01:20] that's the divine nature of God and
[1:01:23] people don't want they don't to preach
[1:01:24] there you know what
[1:01:25] like I said they believe in healings
[1:01:27] they believe in deliverances is that
[1:01:30] right they believe in miracles
[1:01:32] hallelujah
[1:01:33] but the bride of Jesus Christ these
[1:01:35] people who claim to be bride have a hard
[1:01:37] time believing that God can transform
[1:01:40] them and that's the thing he came to do
[1:01:44] oh you believe in all the miracles
[1:01:49] well transformation of you you the
[1:01:52] greatest miracle that could ever happen
[1:01:55] why don't we start with it oh I used to
[1:01:59] be this and up in this for a long time
[1:02:00] that's all right God comes to change it
[1:02:04] and I know a man who could turn on the
[1:02:06] light is that right
[1:02:08] God can quicken your mind and make you
[1:02:10] know you do not have to remain in prison
[1:02:13] hallelujah is that right because he who
[1:02:16] said to say he who said he was said to
[1:02:20] free makes you free indeed he whom the
[1:02:23] Sun set free he's free
[1:02:26] huh your freedom has been purchased you
[1:02:32] can go free let's see you got a withered
[1:02:38] long eyeball with this we'll go dog
[1:02:41] didn't care
[1:02:44] jesus healed a lot of withered arms all
[1:02:48] my leg was shot but I wanted to go home
[1:02:52] God don't care you was born with it
[1:02:55] and headed 30 years but doesn't mean
[1:02:58] that doesn't mean you have to
[1:02:59] continually have it the man for 30 years
[1:03:03] blind never seen daylight before bar
[1:03:07] that way he could have made an excuse I
[1:03:10] was born as man there's no way out
[1:03:12] not when it comes to Jesus not when it
[1:03:15] comes to his empire hallelujah we come
[1:03:19] to straighten and see everything say to
[1:03:21] me crooked we come to straighten it out
[1:03:25] that's the power of the Holy Ghost come
[1:03:27] on somebody you gotta believe it that
[1:03:33] God that the problem is with us we don't
[1:03:35] have enough love and compassion Jesus
[1:03:38] was always moved with love and
[1:03:39] compassion that's why people were being
[1:03:41] able to be healed and delivered it was
[1:03:44] he saw condition and it moved him but we
[1:03:47] look at conditions as oh lord have mercy
[1:03:49] hallelujah you are the mercy you are the
[1:03:53] mercy God put you there because you're
[1:03:56] the mercy but we use it like like a some
[1:04:01] second handed thing when we are the
[1:04:04] Christ we are the Messiah's oh you're
[1:04:08] getting you getting scared on me now see
[1:04:10] but that's what we are but as long as
[1:04:12] your line is not girdled and you just
[1:04:15] scattered plain you'll never come to see
[1:04:18] what God has called you to do

[1:04:32] it's been a greater revelation and every
[1:04:34] day it seems to get greater and greater
[1:04:36] and then when the Lord comes to show you
[1:04:38] you can't
[1:04:38] have one of these things to you then
[1:04:40] what you do you ask for them you ask for
[1:04:43] them because when you ask you show him
[1:04:46] you believe that you're supposed to have
[1:04:47] it hallelujah and you know what I keep
[1:04:50] telling the sauce every day almost I

[1:05:34] us when we came to Christ had to be
[1:05:36] sanctified cleansed up huh hallelujah
[1:05:46] old friend of mine he was a young man he
[1:05:50] said it was hard for him to get saved
[1:05:52] because he was born in the message and
[1:05:54] he had never done much wrong so when
[1:05:58] they were calling for sinners he didn't
[1:06:00] see himself as a sinner he couldn't go
[1:06:02] up because he never been out in the
[1:06:04] world he never did this he never did
[1:06:05] daddy never did it it just didn't have
[1:06:08] the revelation though that he was born
[1:06:12] he was born a sinner and every day he in
[1:06:17] his life he sin one of the things that
[1:06:21] made him a sinner because he didn't
[1:06:23] believe he was you know it don't care I
[1:06:29] mean somebody's priest and everything
[1:06:31] else could outdo us hallelujah but yet
[1:06:34] they were Devils the Bible said have you
[1:06:39] thirst and hunger after righteousness
[1:06:40] you shall be filled
[1:06:42] that's what makes you different your
[1:06:44] thirst is different hallelujah
[1:06:47] your thirst is different if you first

[1:07:05] you abundantly into the everlasting
[1:07:06] kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ

[1:07:20] Tabernacle to stir you up by putting
[1:07:23] yourself in room in other words as long

[1:07:37] him to remember stir him up that these
[1:07:40] things must be in you because this is
[1:07:43] the divine nature of God this is what
[1:07:46] animal loves hallelujah and because of
[1:07:49] Jesus because of Jesus Christ dying and
[1:07:53] raising from the dead oh we didn't
[1:07:56] realize amen when that Holy Ghost came
[1:07:58] on a day of Pentecost we oh come on how
[1:08:00] is that facade we thought I was speaking
[1:08:02] in tongues and shouting and dancing and
[1:08:04] feeling good hallelujah but that was it
[1:08:07] was more to it than that God was
[1:08:10] restoring his nature back to mankind
[1:08:13] building his empire hallelujah and God
[1:08:18] is building his empire and
[1:08:21] reestablishing his nature God's nature
[1:08:24] in man and if his nature is being
[1:08:28] reestablished in you it makes you him
[1:08:32] you become him and he become you that's
[1:08:36] what Jesus said father I pray that we
[1:08:39] become one they become one even as we
[1:08:42] are one when did they become one when
[1:08:46] the Holy Ghost came down on that River
[1:08:50] and Jesus and God said this is my
[1:08:54] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to
[1:08:57] dwell in hallelujah
[1:09:05] not okay give me a few more minutes
[1:09:08] we're talking about resurrection I can't
[1:09:11] get over that either cuz I'm harder you
[1:09:13] know Bible said we're already sitting in
[1:09:14] heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:09:16] alright at 8:30 give me a few more
[1:09:18] minutes he said Amen in first
[1:09:20] Corinthians 15 42 and 49 is it so also
[1:09:23] is the resurrection of the Dead it is
[1:09:25] sown in corruption it is raised in
[1:09:27] incorruption it is sown in dishonor it
[1:09:30] is raised in glory it is sown in
[1:09:32] weakness it is raised in power what
[1:09:35] that's right this means this man so what
[1:09:40] by sex hallelujah but poor and bereaved
[1:09:47] hallelujah it is sown a natural body it
[1:09:50] is raised a spiritual body there is a
[1:09:52] natural body there's a spiritual body
[1:09:54] and so it is written listen you got to
[1:09:58] understand God trying to get us to be
[1:10:00] somewhere we're talking about the
[1:10:01] squeeze hallelujah but God took a man
[1:10:05] 2000 years ago by the name of Philip and
[1:10:08] translated him translated him he didn't
[1:10:12] have a bus ticket he didn't have a car
[1:10:15] he didn't have a plane God took him and
[1:10:18] moved him into the desert hallelujah I'm
[1:10:22] talking about in the after age and he
[1:10:27] declared I am the Alpha and the Omega
[1:10:29] maybe I'm crazy but that's what I
[1:10:32] believe
[1:10:33] hallelujah I believe if I don't have
[1:10:35] transportation God can make it happen
[1:10:38] when it come to his purpose and his
[1:10:40] working we kept that believe he's the
[1:10:43] same he done he's the same yesterday
[1:10:45] today forever hallelujah
[1:10:49] ah he said the first man was made a
[1:10:53] living soul the last Adam was uh first
[1:10:57] man Adam excuse me was made a living
[1:10:59] soul the second the last Adam was made a
[1:11:02] quick Experion
[1:11:04] that was not first which is spiritual
[1:11:06] but that which is natural and afterward
[1:11:08] that which is spiritual the first man is
[1:11:11] of the earth earthly the second man is
[1:11:13] of the Lord from heaven
[1:11:17] the first man Adam was my daddy he was
[1:11:23] from the earth but my this the last one
[1:11:27] that second one that one that we know is
[1:11:29] a quickening spirit the box that he is
[1:11:31] Lord mm-hmm from heaven as is the
[1:11:38] earthly such as they also that are
[1:11:40] earthly and as is the heavenly such are
[1:11:42] they also the heavenly did we bear the
[1:11:45] image of Adam we are called the sons of
[1:11:49] Adam we got ears like him a nose like
[1:11:52] him eyes like him enough lock him talk
[1:11:55] like him walk like him we bared that
[1:11:57] natural image and as we have been born
[1:12:01] of the image of the earthly we shall not
[1:12:04] that we might not that it might happen
[1:12:07] it shall in the eyes of God is already
[1:12:11] done hallelujah he said we shall also
[1:12:14] bear the image of the heavenly what a
[1:12:18] promise what a promise I didn't even
[1:12:23] want to look like my daddy
[1:12:25] until my DNA says it ain't what you want
[1:12:35] it happened as long as that we eat is
[1:12:39] longer that would continue to be healthy
[1:12:41] my brother when I talk to him here the
[1:12:43] last time he says tell me at what point
[1:12:46] in time and you know in your years did
[1:12:49] you realize you changed from looking
[1:12:51] like your mama to your daddy I said I
[1:12:55] did notice I said if you go back in some
[1:12:57] of my pictures I look like a different
[1:12:58] fellow altogether nevertheless I bear
[1:13:01] the image of my natural father was that
[1:13:05] by chance no sir it's programmed
[1:13:09] hallelujah I'm almost done see we come
[1:13:12] to take control this is your land and
[1:13:15] remember I told you this is your
[1:13:17] inheritance hallelujah after it's all
[1:13:20] said and done this earth will be ours we
[1:13:25] come back here and wherever else he
[1:13:27] wants us to go hallelujah
[1:13:33] I'm almost done I'm gonna do this last
[1:13:36] quote coming from the fundamental faith
[1:13:39] foundation of faith he says now the
[1:13:41] things of it is since he has restored
[1:13:43] man back to this place man in the fallen
[1:13:47] has lost his conscious of what father
[1:13:49] put him here on earth to do in other
[1:13:51] words all the plumbing as it was in our
[1:13:55] brain and our outlets the faith has been
[1:13:58] clogged up with business affairs with
[1:14:01] the home life domestic things it's all
[1:14:04] become so clogged clogged up with that
[1:14:07] until God can't operate through those
[1:14:09] channels that he made a man fall now
[1:14:12] when God made a human body every little
[1:14:15] part of it had its place to play the
[1:14:18] teeth the tongue the eye the nose God
[1:14:21] does everything in there to make it
[1:14:24] perfect in operation to make the man to
[1:14:26] live if God so pad and the man the body
[1:14:30] of a man
[1:14:30] how much more as we patterned and said
[1:14:33] in order the body of Christ the church
[1:14:35] if God designed man's body
[1:14:38] he certainly designs the body of his son
[1:14:41] the church and he's designed us to come
[1:14:45] together in heavenly places in Christ
[1:14:47] Jesus and have these supernatural
[1:14:50] workings of God outlets through gifts of
[1:14:54] the Spirit such as prophecy wisdom and
[1:14:56] knowledge and the gifts of healing and
[1:14:58] all of these other different gifts is
[1:15:00] outlets that God lets out his power and
[1:15:04] let out his revelation to the people in
[1:15:08] other words you and I have no right to
[1:15:11] get jealous of anybody who's got
[1:15:14] something that we don't have just use
[1:15:17] what you've got everybody has something
[1:15:20] different oh I felt like shopping but I
[1:15:24] had to hold this pulpit right see God
[1:15:27] the design men's body not as an
[1:15:30] individual so much but as units we're
[1:15:32] all together one great body of believers
[1:15:35] and now how do we get into this body by
[1:15:38] mystical body of the Lord Jesus by one
[1:15:41] spirit we're all baptized into this body
[1:15:43] now Satan
[1:15:45] but the laws of sin and death makes
[1:15:48] everything that sin and death brought
[1:15:50] operates to Satan's sins right did you
[1:15:55] hear what I said let me read that again
[1:15:57] and if Satan by his power can make his
[1:16:01] laws work in man how much more God with
[1:16:07] his power make his laws work in man if
[1:16:12] Satan can make his laws
[1:16:14] be sure and us in laws be sure and us
[1:16:21] recognize it how much more God to his
[1:16:24] children to make his laws be recognized
[1:16:28] among his people of divine healing
[1:16:30] revelation power gifts manifestation of
[1:16:34] the Spirit the law of sin and death
[1:16:36] works in the people and the law of
[1:16:39] Liberty of Christ has come unto us to
[1:16:42] set us free from those things you tell
[1:16:46] you that whatever Satan put on you the
[1:16:50] law of Liberty has come to make you free
[1:16:52] oh mercy my last one can I do it faith
[1:17:05] doesn't come by fasting faith doesn't
[1:17:09] come by praying reading a book all of
[1:17:12] that's good
[1:17:13] fasting praying reading reading a book
[1:17:16] but faith come by a settled something
[1:17:19] that's in the human heart that tells you
[1:17:22] just as you as you come to this church
[1:17:24] tonight when you come home you told your
[1:17:27] wife you'll be home after the service
[1:17:29] was over you do that unconsciously you
[1:17:32] just go out and get in your car and go
[1:17:34] on home now you come could not do it
[1:17:38] unless you have faith you could do it
[1:17:40] you never move from there you're sitting
[1:17:44] if you didn't have faith you could raise
[1:17:46] up but you've done it so much and you
[1:17:49] just become so accustomed to those laws
[1:17:51] till it's a natural thing now y'all got
[1:17:55] to understand when we were babies we had
[1:17:58] to believe
[1:17:59] we could walk we had to believe we could
[1:18:03] crawl because that was the thing that
[1:18:06] initiated us it it was the thing that
[1:18:08] made us we looked at our siblings or
[1:18:11] whoever we saw them walking and said
[1:18:12] well I can do that but see it became so
[1:18:17] common we just do it now if we could
[1:18:21] throw ourselves completely to God and to
[1:18:24] his will and be lost to our own thoughts
[1:18:26] and just let the mind of Christ being us
[1:18:29] them same operation of the Spirit will
[1:18:33] work through us just as the natural
[1:18:35] things does naturally supernatural
[1:18:40] right just the same thing because we
[1:18:43] were first created for the purpose to
[1:18:47] control to rule and to praise God and to
[1:18:50] live for God we what let me read that
[1:18:53] again we were the purpose we were
[1:18:56] created for that purpose to control to
[1:19:00] rule and to praise God and live for God
[1:19:03] and Jesus said if your body tell the
[1:19:07] devil I was created for this purpose and
[1:19:12] to rule you you're minding don't get
[1:19:20] this it's got to be your heart if you
[1:19:23] abide in me and my word about in you you
[1:19:26] can ask what you will and it shall be
[1:19:28] given unto you if you abide in me and my
[1:19:31] word abiding you huh that means is
[1:19:34] living to abide to abode it lives there
[1:19:37] and the Father and his word is
[1:19:39] inseparable because the word is his son
[1:19:42] and in the beginning was aware of the
[1:19:43] words with God in the Word was God and
[1:19:45] the world was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:19:48] us God and His Word is inseparable you
[1:19:51] cannot have God without having his word
[1:19:54] and when you have his word you have God
[1:19:57] oh so I'll leave it everything the human
[1:20:09] race lost in Adam was redeemed when try
[1:20:13] God himself become kinfolk with the
[1:20:17] human race and redeemed it back to his
[1:20:19] maker all that was lost he redeemed back
[1:20:23] again what a marvelous picture you see
[1:20:27] it's our origin it's what we supposed to
[1:20:31] be right and if we don't learn to use it
[1:20:35] says you know we teach a baby how to
[1:20:38] talk we teach the baby how to walk and
[1:20:41] once that baby learned how to talk and
[1:20:44] the walk
[1:20:44] it gets on his own right and God Holy
[1:20:47] Spirit is teaching us how to be messiahs
[1:20:52] little God's anointed one and the the
[1:20:59] teaching is you must repeat the words
[1:21:04] that daddy is speaking you said you know
[1:21:07] that we race between the when the baby
[1:21:10] start talking says the mom says say mama
[1:21:12] mama and and the dad say say Dada Dada
[1:21:15] Dada because we want that baby first
[1:21:18] word to be daddy right normally that's
[1:21:20] what it is about
[1:21:21] I'm sorry sisters that's just the way it
[1:21:23] goes they hardly ever say mama and
[1:21:25] they're down the road but daddy is a
[1:21:27] easier way to pronounce things because
[1:21:29] they're the way their mouths of things
[1:21:30] but nevertheless they learn how to say
[1:21:34] words properly because we rehearse those
[1:21:37] words to that child
[1:21:39] Jesus rehearses his word and he says now
[1:21:43] this is the way it's supposed to be said
[1:21:46] hello and if you say it the way it is
[1:21:50] written and the way it's supposed to be
[1:21:52] said you'll get the same product you
[1:21:57] become gods when you learn how to speak
[1:22:01] like gods let's stay
[1:22:21] we're an empire we're the kingdom and
[1:22:25] every Kingdom that works for his king
[1:22:28] every King works for his kingdom you
[1:22:30] want to make sure everything in his
[1:22:31] kingdom is right things going right you
[1:22:34] know no foolishness you know he wants it
[1:22:37] right and that's the way the Holy Ghost
[1:22:39] is I think a lot of time we fail to see
[1:22:41] that the Holy Ghost is reporting every
[1:22:43] little action indeed that we do we we
[1:22:46] forget because we can't see him we think
[1:22:48] he's not dead
[1:22:49] but God was here before we came he will
[1:22:52] always be here and he sees us he knows I
[1:22:55] every move he knows I ever every thought
[1:22:57] there's no way out of this thing other
[1:23:00] than to do what he wants us to do God is
[1:23:03] not forcing us to serve Him he said
[1:23:05] whosoever will let him come
[1:23:06] God wants willing House willing minds
[1:23:09] who don't want to go listen my thing is
[1:23:11] I don't care if he's black like the
[1:23:13] probably God said I don't care if he's
[1:23:14] black brown white don't make no
[1:23:16] difference I don't care what kind of
[1:23:17] eyes his color of eyes color of his hair
[1:23:25] when I see it I'm not falling in love
[1:23:28] with his physical I'm falling in love
[1:23:31] with his spirit with that supernatural
[1:23:35] being that went out I can't say it like
[1:23:40] that when I was way but because he
[1:23:42] didn't but he agreed to suffer to die
[1:23:46] for us think about it people
[1:23:51] father not my will but thine be done he
[1:23:54] had to make a choice as a man to suffer
[1:23:59] because he realized the greater the
[1:24:02] greater in what is going to be like for
[1:24:05] those who are redeemed those who press
[1:24:10] their way through this age and be those
[1:24:13] little messiahs that he wants them to be
[1:24:16] right it's beyond Christian everybody to
[1:24:18] say they're Christians but God want to
[1:24:20] see Christ he want to see a life live
[1:24:23] life thundered where she shaped the
[1:24:28] atmosphere once you walk into a room see
[1:24:32] that kind of a shaking the more the more
[1:24:39] that I surrender the law the more that
[1:24:50] are released like is the more
