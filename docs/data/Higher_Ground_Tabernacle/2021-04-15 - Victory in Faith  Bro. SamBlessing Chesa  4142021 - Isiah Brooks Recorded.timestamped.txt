[34:16] made it to church
[34:18] tonight amen
[34:21] it's always good to come to church

[34:30] appointment
[34:32] hallelujah um let's read hebrews
[34:36] chapter 11 verse one and eight
[34:42] one through eight now faith is a
[34:44] substance of things hoped for
[34:47] the evidence of things not seen for by
[34:50] it the elders obtained a good report
[34:53] through faith we understand that the
[34:55] worlds were framed by the word of god
[34:57] so that things which are seen were not
[35:00] made of things which do appear
[35:02] by faith abel offered unto god a more
[35:04] excellent sacrifice than cain
[35:06] by which he obtained witness that he was
[35:10] righteous
[35:11] god testifying of his gifts and by it
[35:14] he being dead yet speaketh
[35:18] by faith enoch was translated that he
[35:20] should not see death
[35:21] and was not found because god had
[35:24] translated him
[35:25] for before his translation he had his
[35:28] testimony
[35:28] that he pleased god for without faith it
[35:32] is impossible to please him
[35:33] for he that cometh to god must come
[35:37] must believe that he is and he is a
[35:39] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[35:41] him
[35:42] let us bow our heads is whilst we're

[36:42] come and anoint the word that's in your
[36:45] bible because only you can give life to
[36:47] it
[36:48] i pray in jesus christ's name believing
[36:50] amen
[36:51] let me take your seats
[36:57] so for some time tonight we want to
[37:00] speak on
[37:00] this subject victory in faith
[37:05] when brother troy asked me to to speak i
[37:08] was
[37:09] just waiting on god to see which
[37:10] inspiration he was leading me
[37:12] and um he led me to this subject so i
[37:15] believe
[37:16] is going to help a few people amen
[37:20] so we're speaking on victory in faith so
[37:23] in the bible that we in the verse that
[37:25] we read
[37:26] in um hebrews chapter 11
[37:31] it says paul says now faith is the
[37:33] substance of things hoped for
[37:35] the evidence of things not seen so faith
[37:38] is not something that's imaginary
[37:40] but it's something that it's a substance
[37:43] substance is something that's tangible
[37:45] of the the evidence of the things not
[37:48] seen
[37:48] so the things that you are hoping for
[37:50] the thing that you are believing that
[37:52] you are going to have
[37:53] faith is a tangible part of it and
[37:57] in the last verse in verse 6 it says but
[37:59] without faith it is impossible to please
[38:02] him
[38:02] for he that cometh to god must believe
[38:04] that he is so without
[38:06] faith you cannot please god the prophet
[38:09] of god tells us that in the soul
[38:11] of you in the soul of a human there are
[38:13] only two things that can stay within
[38:15] there
[38:15] that is either doubt or faith and if you
[38:18] have
[38:18] doubt then you are not being led of of
[38:21] god
[38:22] but if you have faith then you have that
[38:25] space for god to come and dwell
[38:26] in because faith is of god and if you
[38:29] have doubt
[38:30] you don't have god in your life you have
[38:32] darkness
[38:33] but for you to please god you have to
[38:35] have that faith
[38:37] inside of your life many times we don't
[38:40] understand
[38:40] faith it seems the way we read and
[38:44] it seems like something that's abstract
[38:46] something that don't exist or something
[38:48] that's
[38:48] imaginary but faith like the bible just
[38:51] just told us
[38:52] it is a substance it is tangible you
[38:55] coming to church
[38:57] that was faith getting into your car
[39:00] that was faith because you had faith in
[39:02] your car that your car was going to take
[39:03] you here
[39:05] each and every one of you when you sat
[39:06] on your chair you didn't check to see if
[39:09] it was gonna
[39:09] if it was gonna buckle under you why
[39:11] because you had faith in that chair so
[39:14] faith is that simple we see it in our
[39:16] every
[39:17] day-to-day lives but many times when we
[39:20] want to use it
[39:21] for what we are believing on the devil
[39:23] will make it seem as if
[39:24] it's something imaginary and something
[39:26] that's unachievable
[39:28] the prophet of god said in her faith in
[39:30] god he says faith
[39:32] why is the most common thing there is
[39:34] you can't even get a drink of water
[39:36] without faith you couldn't come to this
[39:38] meeting without faith
[39:40] you cannot move your finger without
[39:42] faith
[39:43] so whatever you do you have to believe
[39:45] in it for you to achieve it
[39:48] you would have already have faith and
[39:51] then
[39:52] in romans chapter 10 verse 17 paul tells
[39:54] us that
[39:55] so then faith comes by hearing and
[39:58] hearing
[39:59] by the word of god so
[40:03] every time we listen to the word of god
[40:06] every time
[40:06] we read in the bible that's how we get
[40:09] our faith
[40:10] that's how faith comes in into your
[40:12] heart
[40:13] and the devil knows that the more you
[40:15] listen to the word of god
[40:17] the more you read the word of god you're
[40:19] going to have faith and
[40:21] faith is a weapon that god gave us so we
[40:23] can overcome the devil
[40:25] so the devil has put destructions in
[40:27] front of us
[40:28] so that we don't have enough time to
[40:30] listen to the word
[40:31] we don't have enough time to
[40:34] read the word we don't have time for
[40:36] bible study we don't have time for
[40:38] devotions
[40:39] why it is the devil that's bringing it
[40:42] in front of us
[40:43] so he distracts us because he wants to
[40:46] keep that faith that you have
[40:47] so little because he knows the moment
[40:49] you have faith
[40:50] it is trouble for his kingdom so
[40:54] we got to be cognizant of that and know
[40:56] that every time the devil is trying to
[40:58] distract us
[40:59] but when the moment you realize that
[41:01] that's the devil's technique the prophet
[41:03] of god says
[41:03] you would have already overcome and then
[41:06] you go on
[41:07] every day you read your bible you pray
[41:10] every day
[41:11] the prophet of god was as somebody said
[41:14] how do i make it into the rapture he
[41:15] said
[41:16] read your bible and pray every day not
[41:19] every other
[41:20] day but each and every day so every time
[41:23] when you listen to that word because in
[41:26] the beginning was the word
[41:27] and the word was with god and the word
[41:30] was god
[41:30] so we have god in written form
[41:34] we are we have god right at our
[41:36] fingertips
[41:37] the more we are reading the bible we are
[41:40] hearing what god is saying to us
[41:42] we are getting god into us because you
[41:45] are supposed to
[41:46] get god within you that's what jesus
[41:49] wants for us
[41:49] you and me when you get the holy ghost
[41:52] to have jesus christ to come and dwell
[41:53] within you and me
[41:56] so you have to stand firm on that word
[41:58] the word that you have read
[42:00] what you would have heard what you have
[42:02] read you have to stand firm on
[42:04] it because the devil brings reasoning
[42:07] that's how he first fell at the first
[42:11] god gave them the word but the devil
[42:13] came and he reasoned the word
[42:15] out of them and that's how they become
[42:17] they became um they came to fall
[42:20] but the prophet of god tells us that he
[42:22] says that's the death struck to satan
[42:24] when a man takes god at his word brother
[42:27] that will kill satan
[42:29] every time not some other time
[42:32] but every time when a man takes guarded
[42:35] his word
[42:36] that will kill satan every time so the
[42:38] devil knows that
[42:40] the more you read the more you listen to
[42:42] the word
[42:43] that's a potential deathstroke to him so
[42:46] that's why you and me we all
[42:47] have to be focused to make sure that we
[42:51] are focused on god
[42:52] and listen to each and every word that
[42:53] he says we should do
[42:56] when a man takes god at his word that's
[43:00] a death stroke
[43:01] amen yes sir and now faith is so simple
[43:05] you don't have to crank for you to go
[43:07] get faith because faith it is already
[43:09] given
[43:10] when we read in the bible um
[43:13] ii peter chapter one if we if you can
[43:16] open up bibles to
[43:17] second peter chapter one verse five
[43:29] verse 5 reads and besides this
[43:33] giving all diligence add to your faith
[43:36] virtue
[43:37] add to virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[43:40] temperance and to temperance patience
[43:43] and to patience godliness
[43:45] and to godliness brotherly kindness and
[43:47] to brotherly kindness charity
[43:50] for if these things be in you and abound
[43:53] they make
[43:54] you that you shall neither be barren or
[43:56] unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord
[43:58] jesus christ
[43:59] when we go back to verse five it says
[44:02] add to your faith
[44:03] virtue so all the if you look at the
[44:06] stature of a perfect man
[44:09] according to what peter wrote here he is
[44:11] saying add
[44:13] virtue to faith to virtue and knowledge
[44:16] so that
[44:16] faith is already there
[44:19] is the basis of the stature of a perfect
[44:22] man
[44:23] so you don't have to crank about it the
[44:25] moment you are converted
[44:27] the more you receive christ as your
[44:29] personal savior god
[44:31] gives you faith as a gift the prophet of
[44:33] god tells us that
[44:34] faith is a gift from god so you don't
[44:37] have to worry to say where am i gonna
[44:39] get faith i don't have faith the moment
[44:42] you just
[44:42] accept christ as your personal savior
[44:44] god already places faith in your heart
[44:47] that's how we get to start building up
[44:49] the stature of a perfect man
[44:51] because without faith there is no
[44:53] foundation
[44:54] faith is the foundation for us to come
[44:57] into the perfect image of christ
[44:59] because we know the stage of a perfect
[45:00] man is the stature
[45:02] of jesus christ and that's what each and
[45:04] every believer
[45:05] is yearning to be to end up in a place
[45:08] where when jesus
[45:09] looks in us he sees himself when jesus
[45:12] looks
[45:13] at you he sees a mirror image of himself
[45:16] a perfect reflection because we would
[45:19] have gotten
[45:19] into the stage of a perfect man but we
[45:22] cannot get there without faith
[45:23] and faith is already given to you
[45:27] improving israel the prophet of god said
[45:28] you can only have faith as god gives you
[45:31] faith
[45:32] you cannot fake it god has to give you
[45:34] that faith
[45:36] however religious you may be yet it must
[45:40] take you must have faith and your faith
[45:42] can only rest if you're a christian
[45:45] upon the proven word of god so faith
[45:48] rests on the proven word of god
[45:50] that basis when you take it is going to
[45:53] be a death stroke why because your faith
[45:55] is
[45:56] resting on it on the firm foundation
[45:58] that never fails because we know the
[46:00] word of god
[46:02] never fails god is not a man that he
[46:04] should lie
[46:05] or a son of man that he should repent
[46:07] but we know that his word never fails
[46:10] so faith it is a gift from god the
[46:12] moment you are saved
[46:14] god has already given you the faith and
[46:16] when you accept christ into your heart
[46:18] into your soul you have that you have
[46:21] that open space already
[46:23] for faith to come and live in because we
[46:25] know that
[46:26] it can only be either faith or doubt
[46:28] that very small
[46:29] space that's created in the in the heart
[46:31] of a human being
[46:33] so we need faith for us to become
[46:36] overcomers
[46:37] and in some place brother branham says
[46:39] faith is a revelation
[46:40] god has to reveal that faith with you to
[46:43] you amen
[46:45] at one place he was explaining faith he
[46:48] says
[46:49] patience and so forth there is a mockery
[46:52] of it
[46:52] a pretending to be in nature given
[46:56] faith and nature given virtue there's a
[46:59] nature given temperance
[47:01] all these things are nature given and
[47:03] the biggest
[47:04] part of our faith is mental faith
[47:07] by hearing the word it brings us to a
[47:11] mental recognition of god
[47:13] so that faith we were talking about
[47:14] earlier on that made you sit where you
[47:16] are without looking at the chair
[47:18] that made you get into your car and come
[47:20] here
[47:21] that faith that mental faith by
[47:24] when you hear the word it brings you to
[47:27] a mental recognition of god
[47:30] and he says but if this coming from
[47:33] above
[47:33] brother if it ever strikes this there is
[47:36] a godly spiritual faith
[47:38] when what does this faith do
[47:41] the faith recognizes only the word
[47:44] no matter what anything else says it
[47:46] only recognizes the word
[47:48] in the beginning was the word and the
[47:50] word was with god
[47:52] and the word was god and the word is
[47:54] still god
[47:55] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[47:56] among us and when the word
[47:58] itself is pouring into our faith
[48:02] our mental faith becomes a spiritual
[48:04] revelation
[48:05] so the faith that you already have
[48:09] when you when the word itself pours into
[48:12] your faith
[48:13] then that mental faith that you have it
[48:15] becomes a spiritual revelation
[48:18] it becomes the spiritual faith of the
[48:19] prophet who god was talking about
[48:22] because without faith it is impossible
[48:24] to please god
[48:26] and when we have faith we know all
[48:27] things are possible
[48:29] we know the the the principal theme of
[48:32] the met
[48:32] of the ministry of brother branham it
[48:34] was only believe
[48:36] all things are possible believing is an
[48:39] atmosphere with where faith can operate
[48:42] and
[48:42] believing in an ad is an atmosphere
[48:45] where faith is going to produce those
[48:46] results
[48:47] so what we all need to do is only
[48:50] believe
[48:51] all things are possible when you believe
[48:54] nothing can stand before you
[48:56] when you believe you can be healed when
[48:58] you believe
[49:00] all demons can be cast out away from
[49:02] your way
[49:03] when you believe you'll be able to have
[49:05] victory amen
[49:07] when you have faith all the impossibles
[49:10] they are changed to being possibilities
[49:12] faith is not in i think so matter it's
[49:15] not enough
[49:16] i think so but it's and i know so i
[49:18] think so that's hope
[49:20] we are not required to have hope but we
[49:22] have to get faith
[49:23] knowing that whatever i say it is going
[49:26] to happen
[49:27] faith in god's word that each and every
[49:29] word that god says is yea and
[49:31] amen everything that god says is gonna
[49:34] come to pass
[49:35] it is and i know so and we have
[49:38] absolute confidence in what god had amen
[49:41] so it changes all the
[49:42] impossibilities two possibilities we
[49:45] know joshua and caleb
[49:47] when they went with the other ten spies
[49:50] they were not looking
[49:51] at what their side was saying in first
[49:54] corinthians tells us that
[49:55] we live by faith and not by sight so we
[49:58] do not look at what our eyes say
[50:00] when you when in school you learn that
[50:02] our eyes give us what we call
[50:03] optical illusion there is an illusion
[50:06] that your eyes give you
[50:07] and satan maximizes on that but we know
[50:11] we don't
[50:11] live by that faith we live by we don't
[50:13] live by that sight
[50:14] we live by faith so when joshua and
[50:17] caleb and them when they went to
[50:19] to spy the land they saw giants but they
[50:22] were not
[50:23] looking at what their eyes were saying
[50:25] their eyes were giving them an optical
[50:27] illusion
[50:28] according to the word of god because the
[50:30] word of god said
[50:31] you are supposed to go and overcome and
[50:33] take that land
[50:35] that's your land so the other 10 spies
[50:37] they were not
[50:38] looking at faith they were focusing on
[50:40] what their side was telling them
[50:42] they were focusing on what their eyes
[50:44] were seeing and the moment you do that
[50:46] you are already
[50:47] defeated but when you look to faith
[50:50] knowing that whatever god said i believe
[50:53] it i don't care what my eyes see
[50:55] i don't care what the symptoms may be i
[50:57] know it's going to come to pass
[50:59] why because god said it and i'm resting
[51:02] on god's faith and not my eyesight
[51:05] if god said so i know it will happen
[51:08] it doesn't matter how many years it will
[51:11] it takes for it to come to pass but i
[51:13] know it is going to
[51:15] happen why is it because god said so
[51:18] at an appointed time god will make sure
[51:21] that will happen
[51:22] because god is willing to bankrupt
[51:24] heaven to make sure his word comes to
[51:26] pass
[51:27] so don't be afraid to take god at his
[51:30] word
[51:31] just have that faith in what god says
[51:33] and apply that word in whatever
[51:35] situation you have
[51:36] in whatever aspect in life you have the
[51:39] bible has everything
[51:40] apply that faith god is able to come
[51:42] through and he will
[51:44] help you out isaiah
[51:47] isaiah said when god speaks the word it
[51:49] cannot go back to him void
[51:52] but only after it accomplishes that
[51:54] which he has
[51:55] sent it for so when god speaks it has to
[51:59] happen
[52:00] it can never fail so all the all the
[52:03] verses
[52:04] from genesis 1 to revelation 22
[52:08] all the word that god put in here it is
[52:12] valid everything that god put here
[52:15] is his word so when god speaks
[52:18] when you open and look at that bible and
[52:21] what god says
[52:22] know that it will never go back to him
[52:25] void
[52:25] but it will go back to him after it
[52:27] accomplishes
[52:28] that what he sent it for abraham
[52:32] knew that god had told him he was going
[52:34] to have a son
[52:35] so he knew that that word was not going
[52:38] to go back to god after until he had had
[52:41] a son
[52:42] so that's why he had that patience and
[52:44] he had that
[52:45] faith to wait for 25 years in
[52:48] hebrews chapter 11 tells us that he's
[52:50] tagged not on the promises of god
[52:53] why because he knew that god
[52:56] this word would never go back to him
[52:58] void but after he does
[53:00] what he sent it for so he was resting
[53:03] upon god's word to say
[53:04] god say god said i will have a son so i
[53:07] will have a son
[53:08] i don't care i don't care when it's
[53:10] going to happen
[53:11] how it's going to happen but i know it
[53:13] will happen
[53:15] hallelujah so when god says something in
[53:17] his word just go ahead
[53:19] take it god will go god will come
[53:22] through for you
[53:24] when in his word he says that you are
[53:27] healed
[53:28] don't look at the circumstances don't
[53:30] look at the symptoms
[53:32] you say god said it i believe it and it
[53:34] is going to happen
[53:36] because he said in his word i was healed
[53:38] two thousand years ago
[53:40] when he said it all you have to do is
[53:42] step in and claim it
[53:44] that's all you have to do it's already
[53:45] there for you to take
[53:47] because god's word never failed when he
[53:49] says it is finished
[53:51] two thousand years ago when he was
[53:52] hanging on the cross when he said it is
[53:55] finished
[53:55] that's when everything was finished so
[53:58] you don't be afraid to take god at his
[54:00] word
[54:01] so you just go and you say satan i don't
[54:04] care whatever you're putting in my way
[54:06] i know it was already finished so
[54:08] whatever i'm seeing
[54:09] right now doesn't determine the outcome
[54:12] what determines the outcome
[54:13] is what god said revelation 8 11 tells
[54:16] us that
[54:17] the bride has a ministry of what
[54:19] prophesying again
[54:20] and we know the bible is a book of
[54:23] prophecy
[54:24] all we have to do is prophesy again
[54:27] again means you are repeating what has
[54:29] already been said
[54:30] so whenever you are in a situation you
[54:32] take that and you say
[54:33] the bible say i am an overcomer you are
[54:36] prophesying
[54:37] that's what faith takes you go go on
[54:40] ahead and know god will never fail
[54:42] if god say lay hands on the sick they
[54:45] shall recover
[54:46] i'm not afraid to do that you should not
[54:49] be afraid to do that
[54:50] why because god never fails
[54:53] i'm not worried about the outcome why
[54:56] because i'm not the one who's
[54:58] responsible
[54:59] for the action when god says in his word
[55:02] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[55:03] recover
[55:04] i will go and i will do what his words
[55:06] say go lay hands on the sick
[55:08] they shall recover it is not up to me to
[55:11] make that person recover
[55:12] it is up to god so that's why i can go
[55:15] ahead
[55:15] i know i have absolute faith in god he
[55:18] has never failed
[55:20] and he is not failing and he shall never
[55:23] fail amen
[55:25] so whenever you see what god said you go
[55:28] ahead
[55:29] you are not responsible for it god
[55:31] himself is responsible
[55:33] to make sure that his word comes to pass
[55:36] do not be scared to take god at his word
[55:38] hallelujah
[55:40] he gave the disciples the commission he
[55:43] said go preach the gospel
[55:45] to the uttermost parts of the world they
[55:47] were not afraid to do it
[55:48] because they knew that he was with them
[55:50] he was in them
[55:51] he was the one who was doing those
[55:53] wonders he was the one doing those
[55:55] miracles when peter and them said um
[55:59] when that uh beggar was asking for money
[56:02] he says
[56:03] we don't have silver or gold but such as
[56:05] we would give it to you what was he
[56:06] talking about
[56:07] he knew that jesus was already in him so
[56:10] he was just
[56:11] giving he was giving jesus out that's
[56:14] what he had
[56:15] he was not scared he was not worried how
[56:18] is that man how is his legs going to
[56:20] straighten up
[56:21] that was not up to him because he knew
[56:23] that
[56:24] god's word never fails god is
[56:26] responsible
[56:27] he takes full responsibility of his word
[56:30] he will never let his word
[56:32] be shamed he will stand for it amen
[56:36] so you just take god at his word and you
[56:38] know he can do it
[56:39] he will never fail noah said it's going
[56:42] to rain scientists they came and they
[56:45] proved it to him they said
[56:46] it has never rained he says i don't know
[56:50] i don't care how it is going to happen
[56:52] but why because i know god said it
[56:54] so he went on around and preached for
[56:57] 120 years
[56:58] saying rain is going to come it is going
[57:01] to rain
[57:02] he had no he had no scientific
[57:05] explanation to that but he knew that was
[57:08] going to happen
[57:09] he was not scared to do it because he
[57:11] knew he was not responsible for it
[57:14] he knew god was responsible for forming
[57:16] the rain clouds
[57:17] and making it rain he was not worried he
[57:20] was just speaking the word
[57:22] what god had told him he knew god never
[57:24] fails you know god's word
[57:27] never fails but it always come to pass
[57:30] so he preached for all those 120 years
[57:33] and it reigned because god when in due
[57:36] time
[57:37] god's word he will make it come to pass
[57:39] so when god said it will happen
[57:41] i'm not worried about how it's going to
[57:43] happen
[57:45] god will make you god will prepare a way
[57:49] for his word
[57:50] to happen to you look at abraham and
[57:53] sarah
[57:53] they were old people they were now old
[57:56] scientifically their bodies could not
[57:59] were not able
[58:00] to bear children but they didn't care
[58:02] about that
[58:03] they were holding on to the word god was
[58:05] responsible
[58:06] for rejuvenating them for rejuvenating
[58:09] their bodies to make them
[58:10] younger so that his promises could be
[58:13] fulfilled in their lives
[58:15] so when you look at god's promises in
[58:17] your life it doesn't matter what your
[58:18] situation is looking like
[58:21] it doesn't matter how much doubt is
[58:23] trying to come within you
[58:24] don't care about that because god
[58:27] himself
[58:28] he will make way for that promise to
[58:30] happen to you
[58:31] because he will make sure his word never
[58:33] fails
[58:34] god is god changes every impossibility
[58:38] to possible amen
[58:45] we all know of the song that says god
[58:47] any reavers you think are uncrossable
[58:49] any mountains you think you cannot
[58:51] tunnel through
[58:52] but we know we serve a god that
[58:55] specializes in things
[58:57] that men call impossible our god calls
[59:00] those possible
[59:02] if we only have faith in him that's how
[59:04] we get our victory
[59:05] when we are relying on god because he
[59:08] never fails us amen
[59:10] so we got to change our vocabularies
[59:13] christians
[59:14] from impossible to it's possible
[59:17] not i think so but i know so i know god
[59:20] will do it
[59:22] you cannot be shaken because you know
[59:23] that the revelation that god has given
[59:26] you that is faith
[59:27] it cannot be shaken god can do nothing
[59:30] nothing can move it
[59:31] because god is behind it and he is the
[59:33] one who has given it to you
[59:35] and sometimes the prophet will say i'm
[59:36] speaking according to the revelation of
[59:39] my faith
[59:40] because he knew what he was standing on
[59:42] amen
[59:44] many times faith
[59:47] is contagious that's why we are supposed
[59:50] to share our testimonies
[59:52] when you hear somebody when you have a
[59:54] testimony that happened to you
[59:56] god done something for you in your life
[59:59] don't be afraid
[1:00:00] to share it because god
[1:00:03] helped you god came to your health so
[1:00:06] that
[1:00:06] you can share that testimony and spike
[1:00:09] the faith that's in your brother
[1:00:11] that's in your sister so you have to do
[1:00:13] it
[1:00:14] in this quote the prophet of god says
[1:00:17] now
[1:00:18] um if mr john doe out here had cancer
[1:00:21] and was healed
[1:00:22] so you can have it and be healed faith
[1:00:24] comes by hearing is that right
[1:00:26] and he says that's the way congress uh
[1:00:29] congressman absol
[1:00:31] who preached um i believe from this
[1:00:33] puppet here when he read
[1:00:35] of florence nightingale and her trouble
[1:00:38] he had heard of this shoemaker down here
[1:00:40] who had been paralyzed laying in his
[1:00:43] chair for about 10 years
[1:00:44] wheeling him up and down the floor to
[1:00:46] give or to do his work
[1:00:48] his office at the baptist and then when
[1:00:50] a vision appeared over him and
[1:00:52] saying he was bound in that wheelchair
[1:00:54] for those years with his
[1:00:56] back broken and down in that place and
[1:00:59] his prince in his
[1:01:00] back until he he couldn't even move
[1:01:03] and the man was made perfect whoa
[1:01:06] congressman absolute said
[1:01:07] if that can happen to him it can happen
[1:01:10] to me too
[1:01:11] god what he did for you he can do the
[1:01:14] same for me too
[1:01:15] what he did for me he can do the same
[1:01:17] thing for you as well
[1:01:19] so when god heals you that's not your
[1:01:21] own testimony
[1:01:22] go give it to the bride of christ
[1:01:25] somebody else
[1:01:26] is waiting on that testimony somebody
[1:01:28] else you might not know
[1:01:30] is suffering from the similar problem so
[1:01:32] when you say the testimony
[1:01:35] god is going to use it to heal somebody
[1:01:37] else
[1:01:38] and it will go on right on ahead until
[1:01:41] all the children of god have been
[1:01:42] delivered
[1:01:43] until the children of god have been
[1:01:45] saved so don't be
[1:01:46] scared don't be ashamed don't be shy to
[1:01:49] share your testimony
[1:01:51] god is using your testimony he is
[1:01:55] waiting on you
[1:01:56] to help somebody else god wants you to
[1:02:00] use your experience
[1:02:01] how you receive the holy ghost somebody
[1:02:04] else is probably in a similar situation
[1:02:07] probably you you were stuck and you were
[1:02:10] bound by this addiction
[1:02:12] maybe you were bound by demons of
[1:02:14] whatever sorry it was
[1:02:16] and god delivered you you never know
[1:02:18] there is probably someone
[1:02:20] somewhere who is going through the same
[1:02:23] thing
[1:02:23] that when you share their testimony is
[1:02:25] going to be evidence to them
[1:02:27] that if god did it for them he can do it
[1:02:30] for me as well
[1:02:31] so go share the testimony
[1:02:34] give it to the people somebody else will
[1:02:36] be helped by that amen
[1:02:40] and make sure that when you give it
[1:02:43] you testify of the goodness of the lord
[1:02:46] because it is not for our own glory
[1:02:48] it is not proving how good we are but we
[1:02:51] know it is
[1:02:52] telling and testifying of how good our
[1:02:54] god is
[1:02:55] each and every testimony is for us to
[1:02:57] give glory
[1:02:58] back to god because he's the one who
[1:03:00] deserves all the glory
[1:03:02] and he's the only one who is supposed to
[1:03:05] get it and not anyone else amen
[1:03:07] so faith we are supposed to have
[1:03:10] faith because faith the prophet of god
[1:03:13] sees it is muscular
[1:03:14] he says in this uh quote he says genuine
[1:03:16] faith doesn't take no for an answer
[1:03:19] it's got hairs on the chest it's big and
[1:03:22] burly
[1:03:23] it speaks and everything else says down
[1:03:25] that's all
[1:03:27] you know if those feelings raise up and
[1:03:29] say you don't feel any different you
[1:03:31] just say
[1:03:31] shut up faith will say shut up
[1:03:34] sit down and god will take over why
[1:03:37] because
[1:03:38] faith is that sixth cent that will put
[1:03:41] to submission
[1:03:42] all the other five it doesn't matter
[1:03:44] what your eyes are saying
[1:03:45] it doesn't matter what your your
[1:03:47] feelings are saying they might say we
[1:03:48] are we are still feeling sick
[1:03:50] we are still feeling painful but faith
[1:03:52] is saying no the word of god does not
[1:03:54] say that
[1:03:54] the word of god says you are healed so
[1:03:57] your
[1:03:58] five senses have to be set under
[1:04:00] subjection to what faith is saying
[1:04:02] your face says shut up don't even feel
[1:04:04] it that's it
[1:04:06] just look at what god says god say so
[1:04:09] so faith believes it you can just hold
[1:04:12] on to faith
[1:04:13] and just let faith take over it makes
[1:04:16] the rest of them look
[1:04:17] look like little to us it makes them sit
[1:04:20] down because he is the boss
[1:04:22] god he's got great big brownie muscles
[1:04:25] and i tell you
[1:04:27] everything else all feelings and
[1:04:28] superstitions and little isms and things
[1:04:31] will just sit down when faith takes over
[1:04:35] faith will sub faith will put fear into
[1:04:38] some
[1:04:39] submission faith will make sure that you
[1:04:42] have
[1:04:43] victories because you are resting on the
[1:04:45] word of god and you have
[1:04:46] faith you have the i know so that god
[1:04:49] will do it
[1:04:50] so we are just supposed to have faith in
[1:04:52] god
[1:04:53] because that's how our victories come
[1:04:56] it is that sick sense that people think
[1:04:59] that we are crazy
[1:05:01] it makes us it makes you extraordinary
[1:05:03] because it is out of the ordinary
[1:05:06] um i shared this story one uh some time
[1:05:08] ago
[1:05:09] when i was when i was younger i should
[1:05:11] have been um
[1:05:12] in middle school i think i was 12 years
[1:05:13] old then i heard my dad preaching in
[1:05:16] church he said
[1:05:17] oh faith is a sixth sense two days
[1:05:20] afterwards i had a quiz
[1:05:22] in in class and the quiz was saying
[1:05:26] how many senses does a person have and i
[1:05:28] sat there then i took out my pen and i
[1:05:30] wrote
[1:05:31] six senses and right there when i was
[1:05:33] seated
[1:05:34] i knew everyone else was writing five
[1:05:36] senses and i was so proud that i was the
[1:05:38] only one
[1:05:39] who knew that i have six we have six
[1:05:41] senses amen
[1:05:44] then after i submitted my paper and it
[1:05:45] got graded and uh
[1:05:47] of course i got it wrong then i went
[1:05:50] back i was so mad i went back to my dad
[1:05:52] i said
[1:05:53] you were preaching that we have six
[1:05:55] senses but this is what i wrote and the
[1:05:57] teacher
[1:05:58] he graded the teacher she graded it
[1:06:00] wrong that's when he explained to me
[1:06:02] that
[1:06:02] we are different people they have five
[1:06:05] senses but
[1:06:06] we we have six senses when you have the
[1:06:08] holy ghost within your life
[1:06:10] it is different the world will make
[1:06:14] mockery of us because it sounds so
[1:06:16] absurd
[1:06:22] amen that faith will make us receive
[1:06:25] whatever we want
[1:06:26] the bible in um i believe it is in john
[1:06:29] it says
[1:06:30] ask whatsoever you will and this shall
[1:06:32] be given unto you
[1:06:34] because you already have faith in you
[1:06:35] know god is going to grant it to you
[1:06:38] and we don't receive because we ask not
[1:06:41] we are scared to bother god
[1:06:43] but if your motive is right go on ahead
[1:06:45] go ask god
[1:06:46] god is more than willing to give you
[1:06:48] your request he is ready to make the
[1:06:50] heavens bankrupt just to make sure his
[1:06:53] word
[1:06:53] has come to pass to make sure his word
[1:06:56] has been fulfilled
[1:06:57] and the prophet of god says you can
[1:06:59] never exhaust god's love and mercy to
[1:07:01] you
[1:07:02] you say well i hate to bother you so
[1:07:03] much father he wants to be bothered that
[1:07:06] way he does
[1:07:07] don't ever think that you would ever ask
[1:07:09] too much of god
[1:07:11] i believe the scripture said you have
[1:07:13] not because you ask not
[1:07:16] and you ask not because you believe not
[1:07:19] he wants us to ask and believe that our
[1:07:22] joys would be full
[1:07:23] he wants you to ask abundantly
[1:07:26] he is our heavenly father he is an
[1:07:28] affection for you and me
[1:07:30] he loves us so he wants you to ask
[1:07:33] whatever you want
[1:07:34] and he is willing to give it to you
[1:07:36] because he is our heavenly father amen
[1:07:39] and he says ask for big things don't
[1:07:41] limit your faith
[1:07:42] to some little master seed get on out
[1:07:44] here
[1:07:45] to some other kind of faith move out in
[1:07:48] big things
[1:07:49] big things is just as easy to receive as
[1:07:52] little things
[1:07:53] you just have to believe that's all
[1:07:56] and you got faith just know exactly how
[1:07:59] to use it
[1:08:00] and it will be all right you can put it
[1:08:02] right to work
[1:08:03] and it'll be just fine could you imagine
[1:08:06] talking about exhausting god's love and
[1:08:08] power
[1:08:08] and beneficiaries for you could you
[1:08:11] imagine a little bit of fish
[1:08:13] about that about that lung probably way
[1:08:15] out in the middle of the ocean and he
[1:08:17] says
[1:08:18] now wait a minute i better consider this
[1:08:20] thing i better drink
[1:08:22] of this water sparingly because i might
[1:08:24] run out someday
[1:08:26] imagine that just a little fish
[1:08:29] this big it's in a whole ocean it says i
[1:08:32] have to save this water
[1:08:34] because it might finish that's how
[1:08:38] you are taking god when you are scared
[1:08:40] to ask
[1:08:42] that's how you were seeing him you you
[1:08:44] saying
[1:08:46] you are this little pretty much and all
[1:08:49] his promises are that big
[1:08:51] all you just have to do is ask you can
[1:08:53] never ask enough
[1:08:54] just ask and god is willing to give you
[1:08:57] because he wants
[1:08:58] your joys to be full and he says
[1:09:01] um well that could easily be done more
[1:09:03] easy than you could ask
[1:09:05] too much of god he is the inexhaustible
[1:09:07] fountain of life
[1:09:09] whatever you need of him ask ask him and
[1:09:12] you believe it
[1:09:13] he provided it in the redemptive
[1:09:15] blessings when he died at the calvary
[1:09:18] and gave a promise to you for everything
[1:09:20] you have need of
[1:09:21] while you're in the journey and it's
[1:09:23] yours if you will ask and believe it
[1:09:26] all you have to do is only believe
[1:09:29] that's right you will receive what
[1:09:30] you're asking for
[1:09:32] you could imagine a little mouse about
[1:09:34] this long under the great goddess of
[1:09:36] egypt saying now wait a minute
[1:09:38] i better not eat just about two grains a
[1:09:40] day because i might run
[1:09:41] out before the winter is over it is just
[1:09:44] the same thing
[1:09:45] when uh when joseph when joseph had to
[1:09:47] store all those grain
[1:09:49] imagine a little mouse saying i have to
[1:09:51] eat only two twice a day because i'll
[1:09:53] finish it
[1:09:54] that's impossible when you go to god
[1:09:57] don't ask for a little bit and say no i
[1:09:58] just have to ask
[1:10:00] for just for this only because maybe
[1:10:02] that might be too much
[1:10:03] no sir you go ahead ask god what your
[1:10:07] heart
[1:10:07] desires and just make sure that you are
[1:10:10] asking him
[1:10:11] according to his will and you are
[1:10:14] asking god for the right objectives and
[1:10:17] you have the right motive
[1:10:20] because uh in james 4 says you
[1:10:23] ask and receive not because you ask
[1:10:25] amiss
[1:10:26] that you might consume it upon your lust
[1:10:28] when you're saying
[1:10:30] ask big and ask god so many things that
[1:10:33] you want
[1:10:34] you just don't go and start blabbering
[1:10:36] and say i want this i want this and
[1:10:38] i want that but because you have the
[1:10:40] holy ghost
[1:10:41] you have that sense sensitivity you're
[1:10:43] saying lord
[1:10:44] what do i need in my life and god will
[1:10:47] inspire you
[1:10:48] what to pray for god will inspire you to
[1:10:50] let you know what you need for this
[1:10:52] journey
[1:10:53] because he's the one who knows so
[1:10:55] whenever you are asking
[1:10:57] make sure that you are not asking amiss
[1:11:00] just to
[1:11:00] to to consume it upon your last like the
[1:11:03] bible says
[1:11:04] and many times the reason why we do not
[1:11:06] receive
[1:11:07] it's either god is strong is trying our
[1:11:10] patience
[1:11:11] like abraham he did not just give him
[1:11:13] just like that
[1:11:14] but he was working his virtue of
[1:11:16] patience
[1:11:17] and he was working it out if god is not
[1:11:20] trying your patience and building it up
[1:11:23] maybe you are asking
[1:11:25] i miss maybe you're asking for you to to
[1:11:27] to satisfy your lust
[1:11:30] so we have to be connected to god to
[1:11:32] know the right thing that we're asking
[1:11:34] for
[1:11:34] we have to be connected to know what we
[1:11:37] need at that particular time amen
[1:11:40] many times maybe people are asking for
[1:11:42] blessings so that they prove their
[1:11:44] haters to be wrong
[1:11:45] saying i need this big car so that i
[1:11:47] show off the soul and so
[1:11:49] that oh now i made it in life that's
[1:11:51] your motive
[1:11:52] your motive is for you not to serve god
[1:11:54] so god is not going to give you
[1:11:56] because he knows your motive is wrong
[1:11:58] you you are asking amidst
[1:12:00] and you will not receive it but if you
[1:12:02] ask according to him
[1:12:04] and say lord if you need a genuine
[1:12:06] blessing
[1:12:07] god is able to do it i'm not saying god
[1:12:09] doesn't give you won't give you a car
[1:12:11] if you need it and your motive is right
[1:12:13] he will give it to you
[1:12:14] if you need a house and your motive is
[1:12:16] right god will give it to you
[1:12:18] if you need a job and your motive is
[1:12:21] right
[1:12:21] god is able to give it to you because
[1:12:23] you said ask
[1:12:24] and i will give it to you so that your
[1:12:26] joys might be full
[1:12:29] some people maybe one the reason they
[1:12:31] don't receive is because
[1:12:33] they're asking so that they compare with
[1:12:35] with the johns or
[1:12:36] or somebody else with their friends or
[1:12:38] prove that i'm better
[1:12:40] now that set is just satisfying your
[1:12:43] lust
[1:12:43] and god does not want that and he might
[1:12:45] not give that to you
[1:12:47] because so every time you have to make
[1:12:49] sure you have that connection with god
[1:12:51] and you're constantly in prayer and
[1:12:53] sensitive
[1:12:54] for god to let you know what you need at
[1:12:56] that point in time
[1:12:57] and when you pray knowing that you have
[1:12:59] that connection
[1:13:00] you know for sure that his word is not
[1:13:02] going to fail
[1:13:03] you know that god is going to give it to
[1:13:05] you
[1:13:07] god knows his children well he knows
[1:13:09] that if i give
[1:13:10] so and so that thing he knows that this
[1:13:13] person is not going to serve me no more
[1:13:16] if if you have a child who's probably
[1:13:18] five years old
[1:13:19] and they say i want i want a car even if
[1:13:21] you can afford it you're not gonna buy
[1:13:23] it to them
[1:13:24] because you know they don't need it then
[1:13:27] they are asking amiss but if they ask
[1:13:29] for a toy that's
[1:13:30] that's at their own level you will give
[1:13:32] it to them because
[1:13:34] that is necessary that's what they need
[1:13:36] at that point in time
[1:13:37] so it's the same thing with god
[1:13:38] sometimes we ask things
[1:13:41] that god knows that the moment they give
[1:13:43] you that blessing
[1:13:45] that blessing is not going to be a
[1:13:46] blessing but it is going to stop you
[1:13:48] from serving god
[1:13:50] or is going to push you further away
[1:13:52] from god and god
[1:13:53] does not regret so he's
[1:13:56] he's going to make sure you not have it
[1:13:58] until you get to the point
[1:14:00] where you can receive it so we are
[1:14:04] supposed to ask
[1:14:05] god in abundance and we are supposed to
[1:14:07] make sure we are asking the right thing
[1:14:09] we are not asking amiss it's just like
[1:14:11] elijah
[1:14:12] elisha he was elisha was under the
[1:14:14] ministry of elijah
[1:14:16] he enjoyed the way god was working with
[1:14:19] elijah
[1:14:19] and when elijah was about to depart
[1:14:21] elijah said ask whatever you want and
[1:14:24] i'll give it to you
[1:14:25] elisha was not scared he said he did not
[1:14:28] say oh
[1:14:28] you are a great man could i just be used
[1:14:30] by god just a quarter of
[1:14:32] the way god used you no he was not
[1:14:34] scared he went all in
[1:14:36] he says i want a double portion of your
[1:14:38] spirit i want that spirit to be on me
[1:14:40] why because he was not scared he was
[1:14:42] asking for a big thing
[1:14:44] that's what we got to do and we also
[1:14:46] know we are the bride of jesus christ
[1:14:49] we have the elijah anointing the our
[1:14:52] elijah
[1:14:53] he has gone on forth to be he has gone
[1:14:55] on for to be with the lord
[1:14:56] and we are here we are supposed to ask
[1:14:59] for that double portion
[1:15:01] to be working in our midst all the
[1:15:04] miracles that brother branham did
[1:15:06] they were just not there just to be
[1:15:08] written in books
[1:15:09] but the way as an example that you and
[1:15:11] me we can do it
[1:15:13] jesus said greater works than this shall
[1:15:15] you do not in
[1:15:17] not in um in quality but it was in
[1:15:20] quantity
[1:15:20] because we are a many member bride so we
[1:15:23] have to
[1:15:24] ask for more we are the spiritual elisha
[1:15:27] we say lord we want that double portion
[1:15:30] we want to do more
[1:15:32] the way you work in your servant may you
[1:15:34] work
[1:15:35] like that in us and god is able to do it
[1:15:38] because he wants to give us big things
[1:15:41] he is willing to let us ask and the
[1:15:45] greatest thing you could ever ask god of
[1:15:47] is the holy ghost
[1:15:48] at one point the prophet of god says god
[1:15:50] is more than willing to give the holy
[1:15:52] ghost
[1:15:53] more than you want it so you just know
[1:15:56] god is already
[1:15:58] there with his arms out all you just
[1:16:01] have to go and say lord i'm ready
[1:16:03] it just takes that desperation to get to
[1:16:06] the point where you say
[1:16:07] i need it and when you ask for it god is
[1:16:10] more than willing to give it to you
[1:16:13] and when you get the holy ghost within
[1:16:16] you
[1:16:17] the prophet of god said we become
[1:16:19] omnipotent
[1:16:20] i'mma read this quote he says he says
[1:16:22] now man i was going to choke it
[1:16:24] but i'm going to say it man is
[1:16:26] omnipotent
[1:16:27] you don't believe that but he is a man
[1:16:30] fully surrendered to god
[1:16:32] is omnipotent did he not say in mark 11
[1:16:35] 22
[1:16:36] whatsoever things you say and don't
[1:16:38] doubt in your heart it will come to pass
[1:16:40] you can have what you have said and he
[1:16:42] goes on to say
[1:16:43] what happens when two omnipotents meet
[1:16:46] when god
[1:16:47] and man comes together it's too
[1:16:49] omnipotent
[1:16:50] something's got to shake so when you
[1:16:52] have the holy ghost
[1:16:53] when you have received christ as your
[1:16:55] personal savior
[1:16:57] you are a pertain your a potential
[1:16:59] omnipotent
[1:17:01] when you have the holy ghost you are
[1:17:02] omnipotent so
[1:17:04] he says what happens when two
[1:17:06] omnipotents meet when god and man comes
[1:17:08] together he says something's got to
[1:17:10] shake
[1:17:11] whatsoever you'd say with that creative
[1:17:14] power
[1:17:14] of omnipotence of god knowing that he's
[1:17:17] promised it
[1:17:17] and he said it in his word he says it
[1:17:20] creates a power that goes out
[1:17:22] yonder and brings things to pass
[1:17:25] that's things that is not it makes them
[1:17:28] as though they are because
[1:17:30] two omnipotent have met isn't this the
[1:17:32] same scripture that's in isaiah
[1:17:34] that says when god speaks his word does
[1:17:37] not come back to him void
[1:17:38] so when you become omnipotent god is
[1:17:42] sharing with you that creative power you
[1:17:44] just gotta believe it you just gotta
[1:17:46] know what you're talking about
[1:17:47] you just gotta have that faith which
[1:17:49] gives you that victory
[1:17:53] amen so we have to
[1:17:56] know that we are omnipotent and the
[1:17:59] devil is always trying
[1:18:01] to confuse us he's always trying to
[1:18:03] distract us
[1:18:04] and has brings that doubt within us you
[1:18:06] think
[1:18:07] i cannot pray for this thing to happen i
[1:18:10] might though i might not have that
[1:18:11] authority
[1:18:12] but i'm here to tell you the prophet of
[1:18:14] god is telling this
[1:18:15] we are omnipotent and every time two
[1:18:18] omnipotents meet
[1:18:19] you and god these are shaking that's
[1:18:21] gonna happen
[1:18:23] that sickness has to shake off that
[1:18:26] whatever problem that's in your life
[1:18:28] that is
[1:18:29] tormenting you it has to shake when two
[1:18:32] omnipotents meet
[1:18:33] there's no problem that can stand before
[1:18:35] you
[1:18:36] so you gotta know your true identity you
[1:18:39] gotta know
[1:18:40] who you are and the prophet of god said
[1:18:43] um
[1:18:43] you know the padma's vision he says
[1:18:48] don't fear john we know john is a
[1:18:50] representation of the bride
[1:18:52] he was a top of the bridge he says all
[1:18:55] that i am
[1:18:56] you are heir to all my power that is
[1:18:59] yours
[1:19:00] my omnipotence is yours as i stand in
[1:19:03] your midst
[1:19:04] i have not come to bring fear and
[1:19:06] failure but love and courage and ability
[1:19:09] all power is given unto me and it is
[1:19:12] yours
[1:19:13] to use you speak the word and i will
[1:19:17] perform it
[1:19:18] that is my covenant and it can never
[1:19:20] fail what is that covenant the covenant
[1:19:23] is
[1:19:24] you speak the word and i will perform it
[1:19:27] so we just got to take god at his word
[1:19:29] he says that's my covenant
[1:19:31] we serve a god that doesn't break his
[1:19:33] covenant we have seen out through the
[1:19:35] bible he had a covenant with abraham
[1:19:37] he fulfilled it to the t everything god
[1:19:40] has said in his word every covenant he
[1:19:43] made it with man
[1:19:44] he did it so why would he break his
[1:19:46] covenant now
[1:19:47] so if you just got to remember that god
[1:19:49] has a covenant with me
[1:19:51] that i have to speak the word and he
[1:19:53] will perform it
[1:19:54] that is the third pool ministry that we
[1:19:56] saw in the in the
[1:19:58] in the ministry of of of the prophet of
[1:20:00] god
[1:20:01] that put the third pool ministry when he
[1:20:04] spoke
[1:20:05] things happened when he spoke those uh
[1:20:08] squirrels were created and that same
[1:20:10] power is laying in you and me
[1:20:12] all we have to do is speak and we know
[1:20:14] god will perform it
[1:20:16] because we know that that's his covenant
[1:20:18] with
[1:20:19] him and us and um
[1:20:22] we said earlier on that faith comes by
[1:20:25] hearing and by hearing the word of god
[1:20:27] again here in the prophet god says there
[1:20:30] it is
[1:20:31] he is spirit and he is life that is
[1:20:34] exactly what the word is
[1:20:36] that is exactly what jesus is he is the
[1:20:39] word
[1:20:40] so when a spirit-born spirit-filled man
[1:20:43] in faith takes that word into his heart
[1:20:47] and places it upon his lips why that is
[1:20:50] the same as
[1:20:51] deity speaking every mountain has to go
[1:20:55] satan cannot stand before that man
[1:20:59] i'ma repeat that he says when a spirit
[1:21:03] filled man in faith takes that word
[1:21:06] into his heart and places it upon his
[1:21:09] lips
[1:21:09] so when you are listening to that tape
[1:21:12] when you're in church listening to that
[1:21:13] word
[1:21:14] and you are reading that bible when you
[1:21:17] take that word
[1:21:18] and you take it to your heart and then
[1:21:21] you put it on your lips
[1:21:22] the prophet of god says that is the same
[1:21:24] as deity speaking
[1:21:26] no don't take it to your head but take
[1:21:28] it to your heart because
[1:21:29] in the head that's where the devil
[1:21:31] reasons out and the moment you start
[1:21:33] reasoning with the devil you are already
[1:21:35] defeated
[1:21:36] so don't take that word to your to your
[1:21:38] mind but take it to your heart
[1:21:39] and when you take it to your lips it is
[1:21:41] the same as deer is speaking
[1:21:44] that is the deadpool and we have to
[1:21:46] exercise it
[1:21:47] this comes we are supposed to come to a
[1:21:49] point where you can tell the brother and
[1:21:51] you say
[1:21:52] i give you rain why that is the power
[1:21:55] we have the power to do it and we
[1:21:57] believe at some place the prophet of god
[1:22:00] calls it
[1:22:00] reckless faith someplace stubborn faith
[1:22:03] because
[1:22:04] you know it is happening you know it
[1:22:06] will happen because
[1:22:08] you have that faith and you have that
[1:22:10] confidence in god
[1:22:11] that his word when he says i have a
[1:22:13] covenant with you
[1:22:14] he will never fail we know hetty wright
[1:22:18] she was there
[1:22:18] and her sons they were they were playing
[1:22:21] wherever they were
[1:22:22] and when she was asked what do you need
[1:22:24] she realized that the anointing was
[1:22:26] there
[1:22:27] she knew that god was the and she
[1:22:29] believed
[1:22:31] she had that atmosphere believing is
[1:22:33] that atmosphere that faith can work in
[1:22:35] and she believed for her children and
[1:22:38] when
[1:22:38] and when she said i want the salvation
[1:22:40] of my two boys
[1:22:42] when the prophet of god spake and gave
[1:22:44] it to her she received the salvation
[1:22:46] and the boys were saved why because she
[1:22:49] had
[1:22:49] faith she knew it can happen it could
[1:22:51] happen so it doesn't matter
[1:22:53] if you have loved ones that that are not
[1:22:57] saved
[1:22:57] you know god can still do it what he did
[1:23:00] before
[1:23:01] he can do it again all those things that
[1:23:04] god did in the past
[1:23:05] was just not for history we do not serve
[1:23:07] a god of history
[1:23:08] what he did back then he can do it today
[1:23:11] that was just an example to show you
[1:23:13] that
[1:23:14] what i did i can do it in your life here
[1:23:16] we are in the last age
[1:23:18] we are the last people we don't have no
[1:23:21] history to be written no more
[1:23:22] so everything that's there everything
[1:23:24] that's in the bible it is there for us
[1:23:26] to use
[1:23:27] every story that happened in the bible
[1:23:30] every testimony i'll call it
[1:23:32] that's in the bible is to encourage you
[1:23:34] and me
[1:23:35] when you come across a similar situation
[1:23:37] you say lord
[1:23:38] that is me i need that in my life and
[1:23:41] god is able to do that for you and me
[1:23:44] so we just have to have faith and
[1:23:46] believe and god will
[1:23:48] give us the victory so it doesn't matter
[1:23:50] where you are you say i don't have a
[1:23:51] gift
[1:23:52] the the bible says the gift will kill 6
[1:23:55] 000 and you kill
[1:23:56] your 1 000. so you're gonna have to
[1:23:58] stand and say
[1:23:59] lord where is my thousand i have that
[1:24:02] faith
[1:24:03] i gotta kill my one thousand demons i
[1:24:05] gotta kill my one thousand problems
[1:24:07] i have that sickness i have to kill it
[1:24:09] because i have that faith
[1:24:11] and your word says i'm gonna have to i
[1:24:14] will overcome
[1:24:15] and you take god in his word amen so
[1:24:19] we just have to have faith and we know
[1:24:21] that faith
[1:24:22] is going to take us to the rapture that
[1:24:24] faith is what we need
[1:24:26] for our bodies to be translated how can
[1:24:29] you be translated if you don't have
[1:24:31] faith
[1:24:32] to heal a headache that cannot happen
[1:24:35] you have to have
[1:24:36] faith and faith the more you use it thus
[1:24:39] the more it grows bigger
[1:24:40] the bible says if you have faith like a
[1:24:43] mustard seed
[1:24:44] you can say to a mountain be moved when
[1:24:46] he was talking about that there are two
[1:24:48] sides to it
[1:24:49] a mustard seed is small so if you have
[1:24:52] small faith you can speak things for
[1:24:54] things to happen
[1:24:55] if you have that little faith but also a
[1:24:57] mustard seed
[1:24:58] it is because a mustard seed it cannot
[1:25:00] be high bread
[1:25:02] this that's one of the only seeds that
[1:25:05] cannot be
[1:25:06] hybrid or mixed with anything else so if
[1:25:08] you have that faith
[1:25:10] and you don't mix the word of god with
[1:25:12] anything else
[1:25:13] and you are just resting your faith only
[1:25:15] on the word
[1:25:16] you know that with your faith god can
[1:25:18] perform wonders
[1:25:19] with your faith god can grant you your
[1:25:21] heart's desires
[1:25:22] why because it is unadulterated it is
[1:25:26] not hybrid
[1:25:27] with any unbelief that faith don't let
[1:25:30] it hybrid with any doubt
[1:25:32] it's because god can use that little
[1:25:35] faith
[1:25:35] to move that mountain into the sea when
[1:25:38] he says that
[1:25:39] you shouldn't care wait is where is the
[1:25:41] um
[1:25:42] the the earth move or the crane where is
[1:25:45] it going to come from to move the
[1:25:46] the mountain into the sea that is not
[1:25:48] your problem the word of god just says
[1:25:51] when you say that mountain is going to
[1:25:53] be moved so when i speak
[1:25:55] i'm not worried about how it's going to
[1:25:56] go there because that's not my
[1:25:58] responsibility
[1:25:59] it's not my responsibility to make it
[1:26:01] come to pass
[1:26:02] my responsibility is just to speak i
[1:26:04] know god will do it
[1:26:06] one way or the other because he has
[1:26:07] never failed and he will never fail
[1:26:10] you and i will promise to do exploits
[1:26:14] daniel wanted to leave in this day when
[1:26:16] when he saw
[1:26:17] god gave him a snapshot of what was
[1:26:19] going on today he said lord
[1:26:21] i want to live in that in that day i
[1:26:23] also want to live
[1:26:24] there daniel wanted to sit where you are
[1:26:27] seated right now but god said
[1:26:29] you go your way daniel this is not your
[1:26:32] time i have a special person
[1:26:33] who is supposed to be there and
[1:26:37] we all know the testimony of daniel he
[1:26:39] was cast
[1:26:40] in the lion's den and we know the the
[1:26:43] three hebrew boys
[1:26:44] they were cast into a lake of fire and
[1:26:46] they were not burnt
[1:26:48] and with that testimony god says no you
[1:26:50] go your way
[1:26:51] the better people were supposed to learn
[1:26:54] to run the final race
[1:26:56] so imagine when you go to heaven then
[1:26:59] daniel asks you
[1:27:02] what did you do in your age then you say
[1:27:05] nothing
[1:27:07] he's going to say that's where i wanted
[1:27:08] to live because he understood
[1:27:11] with the full revelation of the power
[1:27:13] anything is possible
[1:27:14] he understood that with all the
[1:27:17] mysteries
[1:27:18] open all the seven seals open and all
[1:27:21] the power that god has given to the
[1:27:22] bride
[1:27:23] the covenant that god has with you and
[1:27:25] me that when you speak things has to
[1:27:27] happen
[1:27:28] he knew that it is unlimited it is an
[1:27:31] ending what god
[1:27:32] can do in your life what god can do in
[1:27:34] my in my life
[1:27:36] so that's why he wanted to live there so
[1:27:38] you and me we are not supposed to be
[1:27:40] troubled
[1:27:41] by circumstances that come away problems
[1:27:44] that come away
[1:27:45] we have to use that faith when diseases
[1:27:48] come
[1:27:49] we are supposed to pray and we know that
[1:27:51] the disease will leave
[1:27:53] not for ourselves only but even for our
[1:27:55] loved ones
[1:27:56] when we pray for them we know they're
[1:27:58] supposed to be delivered
[1:27:59] not only diseases probably an evil habit
[1:28:03] that is the faith can actually change
[1:28:05] that away as well
[1:28:06] because while we have the power we have
[1:28:09] the power to speak
[1:28:10] we have the power to pray and things
[1:28:12] will happen because
[1:28:14] god wants to use you god wants to use me
[1:28:17] because those exploits that daniel saw
[1:28:20] was for you and me and we can only do
[1:28:23] that if we have faith
[1:28:25] and that is how we will get our victory
[1:28:27] amen
[1:28:28] let us stand up on our feet
[1:28:35] amen you know with faith
[1:28:38] everything is possible just if you could
[1:28:42] just
[1:28:42] only believe you know all things are
[1:28:45] possible
[1:28:46] nothing can stand before you if you have
[1:28:48] faith
[1:28:49] you know of that lady that was in
[1:28:51] memphis tennessee
[1:28:52] it was have faith that brought a whole
[1:28:54] flight down
[1:28:55] there were businessmen in there were
[1:28:57] running to meetings
[1:28:58] or people who had different schedules
[1:29:00] but have faith stopped all that
[1:29:03] because she saw herself in the word and
[1:29:05] she says i believe
[1:29:06] that's me and that has to happen for me
[1:29:08] and have faith brought the whole plane
[1:29:10] down
[1:29:11] and it was delayed so that her desire
[1:29:14] could be fulfilled
[1:29:15] so that her petition could be fulfilled
[1:29:18] because she knew
[1:29:19] who she was she knew what she was
[1:29:23] believing on she knew that god's word
[1:29:25] never fails

[1:29:31] word and she was relaxed because she
