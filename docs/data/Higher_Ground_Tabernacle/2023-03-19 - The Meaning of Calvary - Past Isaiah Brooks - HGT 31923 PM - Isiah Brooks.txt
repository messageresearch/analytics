Keith and all I had been concerned in the past with the condition of the church I had been experiencing some things personally I had hey uh brother Keith call someone to Kevin check the church out to check the church out for chickens but we found out what that we don't have any mold or the amount of mold that would harm us so the air is done it's good enough to breathe and my concerns were because periodically a roof leak and so I had twice I had wondered what was going on up there but so to make you feel comfortable we have a clean bill of health mid Iowa environment Iowa environment okay so you can shout as loud as you want to everything if you leave here feeling funny it ain't the church we thank the Lord being here uh you know for a moment I thought where are the people and I thought maybe I shouldn't announce I'm going to be here maybe more people will come out amen but we are looking at it at some changes and you can expect me to be here more often expected to move well I see than I have been in the past I've only seen everybody loved the Lord let's sing that song in this time in his time usually our brother Frank is he would be here to interpret for us but uh he had some

morning but it doesn't mean we have to be late and that means what I mean by that is that God has given us this time to worship and to praise him oh I do it your glory and I think we should take this time to do just that amen amen amen my wife and I had to travel my family wanted to vote down to Ohio for some business on TV and God miraculously took us down in June brought us back amen my wife do you have the book in my phone I wanted to read something to you by the grace of God before you may be seated before start the message this morning my wife had no idea what I was going to be preaching and my family showed me this uh man my mom cleansing shoes this quote coming from [Music] okay amen daily readings this is the words of brother Branham inspired by the Lord if you want angels to appear to you keep your mind on God and off the things of the world hey only video shows demand go about your business go to your church go to watching of dishes wherever you are keep your mind on him all day and all night long then God will do something you're drawing closer to him you got the world shut out just you and he are together disappearing of angels frighten the little virgins speaking of marriage she had been taught that the days of Miracles was passed and and with the stripes I was here foreign on favor with God could you have your own what a message to bring her again thou has found favor with God and while she was thinking on that scripture then that was the scripture that was confirmed to her now if you're sick I don't see exactly speak on that scripture if you're lost she was that big on that scripture if you want the Holy Spirit think on that scripture and the Holy Ghost will come from amen amen now as we stand I know we appreciate the word of God you know if I would have said that somebody else was was the author of that quote there would be some who would readily receive it yeah but because I said it was from Brother randomly some people struggle God is good to us we're going to be coming from the scripture of Jeremiah the 31st chapter we'll read the third and fourth first Jeremiah 31 3-4 um and then we'll read John 17 22-24. Jeremiah Jeremy remember in that quote I have found favor of the Lord favored of the Lord you are favorite of the Lord the Lord have appeared of old unto me saying yea I have loved thee with the Everlasting Love do you want to understand therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee is again I will build thee and thou shalt be built o Virgin of Israel Israel Thou shalt again be adorned with thy tablets and Shout go forth in the dances of them that make Mary the new Lord amen amen Saint John 17. Andrew 22-24 foreign and the glory which thou gaveth me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one I think is them endowing me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me father I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou loveth me before the foundation of the world I thank you foreign foreign father God we thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy we thank you for your Divine love that word you cannot even express our gratitude how you could love such a such a such a one is your love is past my understanding and we believe do we believe Lord that the work you've begun in US father bless this audience let them not leave out in the way they came in may we be drawn closer to you may we be willing Lords to give you praise that's why I thought I'll Minister on the meaning of Calvary the significance this is just the beginning of a little series that I will be doing because I believe that a person don't have a meaning or understanding of Calvary they have not yet been to California and every Christian is should have the experience of what I call Calvary this is if you don't have an idea of what it costs Christ Jesus to die for your sins and if you don't know that it was once and for all because uh if you don't understand that once you become a true Christian okay there is no one that can unchristen you not personally and understand this by God's grace that everything has a meaning because Shack shows Jesus Christ didn't go to Calvary for nothing there was a purpose there was a meaning there was a reason why he was born why he had to die and the most important part rise again I just want to start in a simple way in this America or in this world we have more preachers in this age than we've ever had two days before don't do please don't touch because there are churches almost on every corner yet the Bible says that this is a day of famine and the famine in the land is for the hearing of the word is that right never in the history of this message we've had so many message preachers hallelujah hallelujah is that right more than ever before but my question is where is the living statue of Christ wait let statues last statue is the Living Word where is the living Thunder Hallelujah is that right exclusive right and the reason being is because we have done the same thing the churches we hear the words but we have no understanding we don't understand the meaning we don't understand the relationship that the word of God to give us hallelujah when when when Adam said unto Eve where she came from do he was also referring to himself because God is a man is that right and so as he created a wife for uh Adam who I don't he created a wife for himself hallelujah it's so much Adam that he cannot be complete without us complex so new Hallelujah Hallelujah you ever seen something that you and you might ask the person who knows what is foreign utensils I would have never known that they were utensils to eat with because they did they just don't see to me they look like little miniature drumsticks but because somebody knew what they were and they understood the purpose is that right to eat with pumonji and I've still not mastered it amen you understand me it's the same way with any any culture perhaps you can find a culture today they've never seen a spoon or fall in Korea well you know though both of them are utensils to eat with Massachusetts they have different purposes because you know how to use them to that individuals I'm saying all these things for a purpose there's a meaning yeah and what Christians have lost they have lost their meaning Hallelujah and when it comes to meaning it's the expressing of the relationship was explaining amen amen yeah when we think about gonna do Punk song why do we uh what was this whole Calvary about it it was it was it was actually to uh re-established the love of God Into the Heart of his bride the only curl the sunny Boos you see Jesus died from a broken heart is but in his soul man don't he knew that a true bride a true being a true Christian would come along and have the relationships with him a victory that he had in his mind keep on saying hallelujah if that's why Jesus even said super questions he said if you overcome you don't have any situation to sit with me in my book even I have said in my father foreign foreign and yet we we're satisfied with one service a week new songs reading perhaps one book a year with lack of tithing support no Bible reading at all you don't teach your children the word of the uh or meanings you know it's like this we say don't commit fornication they won't understand what's the meaning why is fornication wrong hallelujah hallelujah you must teach this go to the word of God show them examples of what that kind of thing will produce it will bring a reverence [Music] but because you lay a law down doesn't mean they understand what you mean because you never explains so what happens to them they go out living a miserable life transgressing the word of God because they don't understand why they should not is that all right what is your relationship with Christ so I'm in the message what does that means foreign [Music] does it mean that exclusivity of God is revealed to me yeah what does it mean I'm in the message just read ornament signs what does it mean to you yes your relationship with the message because that's just Christ at least what does it mean to you why are you a Christian what is your meaning for being one what is the purpose of it so I can escape here so I can miss make a Rapture I don't know if I can go to heaven what is it what is sequence see you got to understand Calvary wasn't just a historical events every time a Christian to themselves what does it mean the word is life what does this Bible mean to you that's that's the that's the that Bible is the word oh six pounds how much do you fellowship with it foreign I'm I'm throwing things at you because I want you to understand that's because you have a reason for beings what good is a light bulb in lump if you don't plug it up in the socket cut it off Christians need to be cut on because the Bible said you're the light of the world he's the same yesterday The Power of Words supersedes any action of kindness yes dinner any action of kindness for example if you take your wife out to dinner and there are no words spoken between you and yeah is that right um you know you take her out and and move out there they can like for example I was down at Gray's Lake some years ago I assume it was husband and wife and I assume that the the the the the the boat rides were supposed to be romantic and I thought it was so strange that they were in the same boat with no communication they both were texting on their phones what is love y'all understand what I'm saying I'm coming to where I'm going I'm just I'm just playing in the background because I said this is part one hallelujah hallelujah you know have somebody ever said something to you and you said okay what did you mean by that did you really really mean that because you want to understand what's being said whatever is being said affect you in a positive ways hallelujah hallelujah words have power on the prisons people say Sticks and Stones let me break my bones foreign Hallelujah voice of the words because the Lord means what he says [Music] and he says what he means the whole Bible is a love affair is that right it's a love affairs God has for his creation and if you're in the world you'll be in the words in the daytime if I was a woman I would say to that guy said Tom if you are ashamed of me being with me in the daytime you can't be with me y'all doesn't know what I'm talking about so I'm seeing this if you are ashamed of Jesus Christ and you can only fellowship with him when nobody else can see you that's not a real Fellowship hallelujah hallelujah the Bible says that we must be instant in season and out of season in season and out of season that means Jesus Christ it's supposed to be do I asked you hallelujah hallelujah you know my wife and I my family was at some kind of yard sale and there were some Pentecostal people out soon you know no makeup you know long dresses but they look so sad they look so good he's happy he's a detect Easter foreign [Applause] amen I had a sister is that even sir when she didn't want to share any of her food coin foreign she would do it like this you know or she would do something to her food to make sure you didn't want it that's what you call selfish but when she wanted something shoes make Junior give me some of that because I understand what I'm saying this selfishness throughout her whole life but she claimed to be a Christian [Music] oh Lord have mercy I gotta say this one more than I get back to the world one day I was at her house took her to the grocery store you don't you know we bought two big buckets of food news brought it back home she cooked chicken I love chicken I guess I fit the picture preachers love chicken lately but the point of the matter is I think I ate three pieces and she said on her breath foreign amen amen because what his purpose for but success all of the arrogance everything that the world brought to us God came to undo it if you need hallelujah hallelujah he came to bring us into a place that the glory in which he had with the father we may see it and we would be one even as he is you hear what I'm saying he's not done this because his Christian walk is a journey I wish I I wish to God one two three I want to understand my meaning see if I came here stir you up in your spirit on what to explain so that you can have a great time I'm missing the mark the message came to change and so I can't just be preaching good stuff I have to bring the thing that's gonna like the knife cut some things out of you yeah what do you claim to be I don't know what is your purpose why are you here there are people you don't have to be great yeah we're just sheep for pastors you know some people have uh voices to sing orange some sheep are just there to play music you some may not have you know many gifts everybody has something amen amen hallelujah hallelujah John 17 22-24. I'm gonna get to where I need to go in just a minute and the glory without gaveth me I have given them now how many you can say I have the glory of God that they may be one even as we are one come watch yourself what does that mean what does that mean kids God wants us one what uncle my wife and I won my funny one but that's a different one then this Oneness Hallelujah is that right because in in this Oneness John 10 30 says don't I and my father are one Hallelujah and he told his disciples when you see me you see the fire come from that kind of Oneness says hallelujah i in them they may be perfect in me so his wonders here I would be in here hallelujah that the world may know that thou has sent me has loved them God away foreign uncle [Music] that's a different story what does it mean this was a video father I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am the only thing Jesus Christ asked foreign I was told something the other day I say the other day but uh it's been sometimes there's some women some sisters don't believe that they need the Holy Ghost when you satisfy because the Bible says they should be saved through childbearing he do I keep going according um ask God what does that means do you think you can be just a sinner because your husband is safe and you have children for him you're going to heaven everybody that is alive you must be born again Mary had to be born again you gonna happen again y'all hear what I'm saying saved Soviet in childbearing means that you'll be here God will take care of you Hallelujah say the word save me Hallelujah oh my goodness if that be the case there's a lot of women out there that you already saved yeah because they don't have a lot of children but they're still going to the bar that's not what it means but you'll take whatever the preacher says God and sincerity what it means I feel like I'm running through this place right now sisters y'all need to know the message too don't let nobody tell you you don't need to know this is and you count on your husband to get you there if you wish you never understand the meaning there is a reason even for the husband that you've chosen you can remember and you know what sometimes there's nothing much married and we had children what is the reason why God put you with that individuals you think he did that just to make you miserable Hallelujah yeah all marriages are not happy but there's a purpose you say God I don't want to be just like you you did you send your answers God said I'm gonna use the best tool I got and you said whether it be the male or the female cause that's right look what God did with Moses Hallelujah and if it wasn't for zapporo is this Moses would have been killed by God so if it was just that one purpose alone I'd love to pick up her son foreskin and say you bloody husband your bloody husband I don't know how to say it but the purpose is she fulfilled that purpose out am I making sense I'm coming here's a meeting behind Calvary yeah we are the ones who's fulfilling the purpose foreign Jesus Christ you have blessed us with all spiritual blessings Hallelujah in Christ he didn't say songs [Music] the Bible said you are blessed you have already been blessed yeah go to that scripture with humility and love for God you'll never come to understand what that means this is a love letter see and there's so much love in it yeah gotta read between the lines to know what that means think about it separate yourself from all the world separate yourself sit back get in your room wherever concentrate on the scriptures Hallelujah I'm grateful I'm you know there's every day there's moments of Shame the moment don't that comes in my life and there's moments I have to ask God forgiveness for forgiveness but in all of that but don't do son I have a revelation I am don't ask me to explain but I understand I understand that he became my sins Hallelujah peace and I understand without the mercies all of us do from the poop into the back of the door are nothing but Hypocrites y'all better help me here all of us hello [Music] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah God doesn't cover your sins before you even confess it is I have come to understand this is not given you because I come to understand that there is no sin they can keep the bride Out of Heaven okay hallelujah hallelujah this thing was not determined this thing was determined before the foundations decrease hallelujah hallelujah it's nothing but the truth and that's why they ought to give us joy brother was talking about it yesterday you know what I mean I used to have that y'all know what I'm trying to say I'm still saying it's foreign [Music] say you can't save me yeah Hallelujah Hallelujah but I didn't know it has so much about my salvation that's it I said dude this mess is supposed to be jobs you should want everybody to know about it that's where God needs to do for us we need to restore the job of this message Hallelujah [Music] that kind of Joy that'll have you running when Peter James and Jonah when they were on the road he just broke the bread they realized that he was alive and well you understand how how far they read oh my God he's alive this is what the message is about I lost a secular message every denomination will know and that he lives [Music] Hallelujah it's something else right protect your shoes you know it's like when you bring flowers to your wife you just don't say here you go no matter how pretty those flowers come on you know and she's just saying thank you thank you but you know what she want to hear some words and if you can't say the words y'all see what I'm saying because it's the words even more people don't give off sisters am I right yeah those words mean something Hallelujah you love the Lord and you know when I think about it that God said with my loving kindness [Music] foreign what does it mean we say words and we don't even know what they mean because when it comes to that better for worse we want to run that's what I told the church the last time I was out in Iowa City Iowa City I said it was time I wanted to run yeah but when you love somebody you can't run when you really love them y'all looking at me like I'm crazy what if God would have said to you I don't see you then it's enough I can't put up with you no longer I'm leaving you you should do less God have mercy could you hate that's what I mean he'd have done that to me long time ago it would have happened to me tell you how many times [Applause] a fallen short it's your sweet don't make but what gives the reconciliation with his stripes hallelujah hallelujah he was beaten he didn't take battery for my iniquity in the trespass attachment of my peace was upon him it is you know what iniquity is when you know to do right you don't do it and if you've got a little bit of Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is going to always tell you don't do it there's a fat smile don't do it you're a fat spot and we do it anyway you know the funny thing about it is after we do it we want to say the devil made me do it of course but let me move on continue why do you serve God what's your purpose for what reason do you attend church am I helping somebody that's because yeah we need to understand we need to find out the meaning lesson of Christianity and the meaning what our purpose is you know it's not to uh build a kingdom a greater man in society that the world may see Christ in us that's it we don't come to excite the people Newton though it might happen we don't come to bring the message that will have the people then all you know Hallelujah my aim is not your my if if my aim is not your heart Simone but your head my aim is not of God hallelujah I had to tell a preacher one time I don't care about your best message I want to hear from God to me cause I need to hear from God today a lot of times people come to preachers even preachers are guilty sometimes preachers are guilty they want to pull out their best message they can get the people you know show me in the scripture what Jesus ever did that it ain't there I don't want to be stirred I want change that's what we come from and this message will change listen I'm gonna tell y'all something this is where we faltered we have tried to do it for years [Music] foreign how many of you ever had a bad habited and that happened hang on to you for a long time I'm not going to do this anymore and for a season you looking good until that Spirit of loneliness comes rejection whatever that is it comes and now you want comfort and Men y'all looking at me like y'all don't know what I'm talking about when I got this conversation you said you weren't going to do again it would describe you're going to make mistakes from making people it comes to lessen your mistakes [Applause] [Music] it's like that's why you're here that's the reason you're here God can change you could you from glory to glory the ground that's why you're here you're the reason because that's not the reason for being here [Music] making you over again hallelujah hallelujah man I can I can you know something there are some Pentecostal preachers they'll come with a little bit of meat too Yvonne Virginia but when it's all over what does it mean to you you know sometimes the powerful we desire God and don't know it's gone when it comes to come job and Joe which do all he did go through he had no idea that how many millions of people in the world we don't you call me in the media on the Pepto God took one name and said there's none like him yeah okay do you really think job did that on his own he had a contact with God that's why Joe was a perfect man unless the perfect God is in the man I'm almost done but my thing is to get you thinking what does it mean to be a Christian what is my meaning what is my meaning what is my relationship amen what is my relationship with the god I claim I mean does he know me as king milk on it now Brother Band I'm using the illustration with the Lily out of the Statue of a perfect man it comes from way down in the mug and every minute of the day a shackman used to do it has to be drawing from the earth see what does it do with this virtue that it draws it gets crucified it gives it out it makes a beautiful sight for the admirer sidonians it opens up itself for honey for the bee to come and get its parts and don't complain and and so complaint answer complaining Christians we're so good at complaining the complaint I was looking at the clothes in my closet yeah maybe the day before yesterday and I was thanking God for it but then you know what I saw vanity I got so much stuff me and my wife said we're getting rid of a lot of this stuff hey my family I get sick every Sunday what am I going to wear Shack demons it's like oh my God I haven't really been into me okay Android just saying what is your meaning what are you here for this is one thing about you chose and I'm pulling for no money but I'mma says she went back and packed the goods hallelujah hallelujah and y'all called me Pastor won't even pay your tithing oh you love the Lord they don't complain you can sit sit sits uh since foreign my question is they might disjoint as a Christian what do you have to give out virtue I virtue knowledge patience what do you have two screws at me because the word of God tells me that the New Testament Saints they preach wherever The Inspirations they preached persecution that little bee would scratch his head listen simply petite what if the bee come in there I don't see like an insufficient funds you tell me like a brother said closing just tell me if somebody said what does that means see but the truth of the matter is I tried to transfer some money from One bank to another Point by way of about and they wouldn't let me do it these banks are going crazy you could say Bonks you better get you something out because if banks y'all laughing I'm seriously at least you'll have a little cash just in case in case it comes to pass Drew Scott's Christianity to pass what happened to the men the people down there in in general in
