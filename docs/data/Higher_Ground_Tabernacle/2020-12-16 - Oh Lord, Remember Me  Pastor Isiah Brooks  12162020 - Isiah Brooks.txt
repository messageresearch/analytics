wants to but this is one book he cannot unlock it's right in his face and every time he thinks he has the codee god changes the code and we are people that God has given us the code that code is revelation he said I'll build my house upon a rock is that right and that rock is Christ Jesus and the revelation of who he is we like to entitle this message oh Lord remember me as we stand we go right into the word of God we we won't finish this lesson but we really do want to start on it uh Sunday morning we won't be here our brother Isaac a due day will be ministering uh we've got people leaving our brother Samuel this is his last service for a while my brother Isaac is leaving for Arizona and I don't know where everybody else is tonight they could be traveling as far as I know of but we we want to give our brother Isaac and our brother Samuel you know safe journey and uh we're looking forward to you returns we thank God for his grace and mercy judge the 16th chapter it didn't feel so warm back there but now it feels warm up here so I don't want to put you all asleep I don't know what it was on but uh if you want to cut it back down you can I had her to cut it back cut it up because it was cold back there but like I said I don't want to be make it uh uncomfortable for everybody else judges the 16th chapter there's a lot of things I like to say tonight and I just believe by God's grace that we're such a blessed people we're such a blessed people we every time it seems as if situations overwhelm God always has a place of Grace setting right there in the scripture for us and so I thank the Lord for his Amazing Grace we missing our brother Troy brother Troy won't be here Sunday as well he'll be traveling to Michigan amen I really appreciate him I pray trust that he have a he and his family have a great time in their travel be safe you know by God's grace and um yeah he needs a little break but anyway we thank God for his grace and his Mercy judges the 16th chapter we're going to read the 28th verse uh of that particular chapter um I do thank the Lord for his Amazing Grace because um living in a time like these this we need his grace judges 16 and 28 you know we've been dealing with Samson last time we spoke on Samson we dealt with the Jawbone of an ass and I don't know whether you fully understood what I was trying to say but I trust by God's grace he gave you the revelation of what was saying what God was saying and one thing I do know that we're looking for a refreshing we know that there is a final outpouring of the Holy Spirit uh it won't be uh that kind of a spirit that will make you jump and Shout but it will surely give you Victory amen because that's what we're working with now we are those who will conquer in Satan's Eden 16:28 and Samson called unto the Lord and said oh Lord remember me that's where I got my subject from I pray thee and strengthen me I pray thee only this once oh God that I may be at at one once Avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes let us pray father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how and we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us we pray father God that you would have preeminence tonight and we'll be careful to give you the praise Glory and Honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated you have heard me say many many many times uh and that message has always stuck out to the oh Lord once more oh Lord just once more uh that the prophet of God preached in 1963 and it was after the seals and uh you and I know that at that time uh most of the churches had already uh uh disfellowshipped uh themselves with him uh uh basically because of his teachings and his Doctrine and of course they had no idea that they were literally fulfilling Revelations 3 where Jesus Christ would be outside of the church knocking at the door because what they did not realize that was that that not that brother Brandon was Jesus Christ but uh he carried the message of Jesus Christ and he was uh the veil of the coming of the Lord and they don't understand that or the peering of the Lord however you like to say that uh but we understand by God's grace that there was a message left for us uh when everybody else rejected it uh there was a Remnant that God had predestined uh to hear that word and Obey it one thing about the word of God it is also a word of Prophecy when God write things uh for example when we look in the Old Testament many of the Old Testament stories that we have listened to and read throughout the years uh were types and shadows of future events uh you take the story of Esther uh when it uh took place it was the the the the type of what God had in his mind to do for his bride uh when you look at Ruth uh The Book of Ruth we we think it's a just a little story or allegory of some type but we realize by God's grace that there was a depth to that uh story it was actually God Amen shadowing entire typing uh the story of redemption for the Gentiles as well as the Jews and so we look at these things and we find out that God has always hid himself in Simplicity and of course we would have never known these things had not God sent a prophet that that he used to unlock the scriptures to us uh by way of of Shadows and tipes and so when we talk about Samson and we talk about the uh Shadow and type and this is why we've been really working in Shadow uh Samson because in the day of Samson as you heard me say in the previous lessons that Samson amen typed out a time when everybody thought that they were right in their own eyes uh the prophet had gone off the scene and Joshua had now gone on and there was a generation that stood with Joshua ministry as well as Moses Ministry but then there came another group of people uh that really strayed away from the word and and in other words they became blinded uh because they didn't stay on on track they didn't stay with the word but and then during that time Satan was bringing in his deception and everybody thought that they were right in their own eyes and if you look at those judges you'll find out that the the people who were blood rated were the ones who were fighting each other it was Israel that had been so divided but they were fighting one another Judah and all the others amen trying to see who was going to have preeminence one o over the other and if we could look at those shadows and type we find out it's the same today everybody's trying to find out who's going to have preeminence I believe it was at a time when Jesus was on Earth his disciples asked the same question who would be the greatest Among Us and Jesus said unto them this is the this is the way that the Gentiles teach this is what they teach but I tell you the greatest among is the least of all and so we look at these things and we say oh my God have mercy on us this is what I'm talking about in all of this chaos and all of the Chao chaos that is going in on in the spiritual realm and the political realm and the social realm billions or millions of people on earth I had to come ask the question then who am I and where do I fit in where is my place of refuge and many of us know our refuge is in Christ but we need to know by God's grace the the condition of the church we know that the condition of the church is in bad shape so when we look at Samson we think it cannot be the bride this can't be the bride but I got news for you it is because you got to realize that Leia the sea is already dead she's been tried wanting and she she's in a position that she thinks she's living and she's dead and she don't even know it but we want us ourselves when we come to see we need to know what about our day and where do we stand and in order to understand that or order to answer that question you got to see what condition the church is in because it's in the Bible and Solomon said there's no new thing under the sun somewhere we're there whether we are that church on fire or whether we're that church that's cold and dead or whether we there in Le sea which is lukew but we're there coming from a little quote amen I want to read by God's grace from oh Lord just once more brother Bron began to tell us that where we are and what I'm working with the United States now because I can't deal with the whole country I got to work here he says we are living off the tax money that will be paid in 40 years from today the nation is broke where is it at who has got the money we haven't got it our bonds are no good we've got to have gold and who's got it he says the Catholic Church what will they do before these whiskey men and all of these great holders and stockholders will ever give it up they will absolutely sell out and the church WIll loan the nation the money and what will it do it'll sell its Birthright now we just read in the in the paper or the YouTube where all of these great companies businesses of the United States has already made a covenant with the Pope y'all understand me you can say amen and these things have already been prophesied that they would happen and so brother B goes on to say but what we're doing is we're selling our Birthright and what will they do it will sell their Birthright straight into Catholicism and I'm going to bring that out in the scripture in just a moment then what are we going to do that's the gold of the world them and the Jews and that's the Covenant that he'll make with Israel see you Bible readers can teach that in your church you see I'm just showing you I believe the same thing that's how it will have to come to pass and we've got it right there now and here we are organizations with the mark of the beast upon us just exactly like the first Beast an image unto it a Federation of churches joining a power and they made an image unto the Beast that he could both speak and it and and it done the same thing the first Beast did before it right in our clutches oh children what time is it is there a possibility Samson stood there and said now he bringing samsons into it he's in the midst of all of the chaos and all of the Unions that's going on and and we have got to be blind as a bat if we don't know that our country is changing from democracy into what a system called the one world order it is and it must happened but before they could actually do this thing they must break the back of America because amen uh uh we were uh head in econom in the economic realm and that must be broken because in this system they're trying to bring an equality of course that will never happen until we see Jesus now he says what time is is there a possibility Samson stood there and said what time just is there a possibility Samson happened to think that great God he's omnipotent he is Everlasting God I see my mistakes I'm going to repent and he cried out now understand this now if this is a shadow and a type of the Bride you see that's what people don't people don't understand brother Brown said that the Rev bride has not had her Revival yet now Revival is getting the trash out of your life and I want you to understand the story of Samson he was lured and woed into a a a condition where that find where he found himself Amen in a place of mockery hallelujah amen now I want you to follow the the the steps of this message this message amen was when it came when God began to break it was like Samson there was no enemy there was nothing that could defeat him the Philistines couldn't defeat him every battle he fought even in Chicago he defeated it was a spirit of Samson on the prophet of God now Samson represents the bride right and God is now coming to a place because am mean what has happened we're being mocked we're being laughed at you're the bride of Christ look at you you guys can't even get it all together you're weak where be your Miracles where be your joy where be your gifts I mean you used to have them but where are they now y you understand what I'm saying these things have become such a great mockery to even those who were Among Us is now marking us remember in my last message I showed you that even even Judah was on the side of the Philistines and they had actually been uh uh uh in in in bondage or servitude to the Philistines for 40 years because of what their Disobedience to the word of God we must come to a place where we find ourselves in the scripture that's why I read Luke I'm reading Luke now Luke 4:18-19 says the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he have anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he have sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the cap and to recovering of the sight to the blind to set at Liberty to them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord what happened who was that that was Jesus Christ in the temple now reading the word of God to all of the hearers and before he sat down he said this today this scripture is fulfilled in your ears what was it he was literally finding himself in the word he understood the day he was living in and he understood who he was and what his mission was all about and you and I must understand amen that that is what we must know we must know who we are our day and his message and what we are sent for am Hallelujah and in spite of all of our failures we've got a story of Samson because you got to realize the devil is smart he couldn't get you to go to like the prophet of God said to the movies so he brought the movies in hello there's a lot of things he couldn't do so he put it on the phone the iPad the whatever and all of these things is to woo you to lure you to entice you hello don't get quiet but we have a hope beyond the grave if I could say it like that we have a message amen something that has been hidden in the scriptures laying there under those seven Thunders amen because nobody understand the mystery of it and nobody else will because remember when Samson told his first wife The Mystery of the lion and the and the honey she blabbed she told it but this brother R said it will not be impersonated nobody will understand it but those who is given to and they won't be able to explain it Hallelujah I'm anyway listen in that message present stage of my Ministry brother Bram said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor and he have sent me to heal the brokenhearted and to preach the Deliverance to the captive and to recover the sight to the Blind and to set at Liberty to them that are bruised and it preached the acceptable year of the Lord and then he said he closed the book because that was the F that first part of that scripture was given to Jesus Christ himself amen amen but the day of Vengeance was given to the spirit of Malachi 4 which is in turn was Jesus Christ himself so he's bringing out this particular scripture to let you know it's a continuation now amen something is taking place I know where I am and I know what I come to do now some of y'all can say Amen bat your eyes or something what we need to do is find our scriptural finding of our place or position of where where we are in the scripture it's not enough to say okay I can see Ruth and I can say see Naomi but right now we're in a place where we need to know what the next move of God is we're in a place many people have actually allowed Delilah to Blind them and when you think about the two eyes you know you talking about Prophet you know you talking about you talking about uh uh uh Paul and and and the last day messenger because he said I preached the same thing and understand like I said last week when you get two eyes your eyes are not s going way your eyes are going this way to produce a perfect vision must bring forth the cross right so we see by God's grace that we're at a time that you and I must know and like I said if we're at a time where the church world is about to embrace the mark of the beast they're entering into something they don't even fully understand remember Samson did not understand what was going on deila did a good job on him Hallelujah coming from proving his word brother B said you know there's scripture in the Bible in 1 Thessalonians 5:21 where it is written prove all things hold fast to what which is good and when anything is proven it will either be proven right or wrong and where there's anything in question it should be proven until you find out what is right amen and then as you find what is right he says hold fast in other words grip it don't turn it loose hold it fast in other words hold it tight so that it will not slip hold fast to that which is good after it's been proven right and anything that's proven not right then turn it loose as quick as you can get away from it don't never hold onto the wrong things now what is he trying to say he's coming he says now this message have been proven you should look into it look into it and see it and try it it's been proven right you know I look at these things because what people don't understand is that this this Samson continued right he didn't die until the victory was won but we're a church out of a church right it started on the day of Pentecost and and I'm jumping in my message but you know how powerful Pentecost used to be and I'm not talking about a zusa street I'm talking about the real Pentecost they had everything and let me stop because I'm getting ahead of myself first seal brother B tells us one day we we're going to find out where it's written we need to have something we need to know something where where where where this this this power of of authority is going to Quicken us we need to see it in the scripture even if it's in Shadow and type we at least know it's going to happen Samson Was Defeated he was defeated hello y'all understand me you know I'm not talking about denominations now I'm talking about the bride amen what are you saying I'm saying we've done the same thing we've allowed Delila to W us you say what do you mean there are so many people that don't even know which way they're going and understand me by God's grace God has never left himself as a witness but I'm talking about as a whole we don't even know what the message is many people some of us think we know but like I said we're in a time where everybody's right in their own eyes and only the word is right only God can Quicken it only God can give us what we need at this day and time brother R goes on to says and then there is coming forth seven mysterious Thunders that's not even written at all that's right and I believe that through those seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing Faith now watch this he said getting the bride together what togetherness I'm being real now I'm just going to be honest this on tonight because it it's going to get the bride together now how it get how is it getting us together not by Church buildings by one Spirit are we baptized into the body of Christ [Music] Hallelujah that's right and I believe those seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing Faith because what we've got now we wouldn't be able to do it can I get an amen there is something amen there is something we've got to step father we can't have enough Faith to for Divine Healing hardly we've got to have enough Faith to be changed in a moment and be swept up out of this Earth and we find that after a while the Lord willing and we will find that amen after a while the Lord's willing find where it's written now he said it wasn't written but now he said you're going to find where it's written then all the judgments of these evildoers now see down through the ages of these seals have been breaking until now the last seal is broken and now they as they have been watching in on these seals and just presume presuming what they were doing you hear what he said when some people say that seven seal is not open he said the last seal has been broken see that's what I'm talking about he can say something yet people will still have their own interpretation of what he's saying he said it was open it's been Broken Hallelujah and as they've been watching in on these seals and just presume and presuming what they were doing now at the End of the Age of the church ages all these evil doers will take will take place and head up in the tribulation and all these evil doers of the Seven Seals that's been working mysteriously in the church not somewhere else in the church so you got to understand that you know when it comes to believer us you must must understand you said that can't Samson can't be yes she is because he starts off with Seven Locks and that's where his power was that's where his authority was and when he come came into his everybody was afraid of Samson he was like the Boogey Man amen here was a little fella not with these big bronzy my muscles no sir the only way they could identify Samson was by his Seven Locks and when he had when they saw the man with the Seven Locks amen they knew that was Samson now I don't know how they were locked maybe they were braided or maybe they were big curls I don't know but one thing for certain you could count them he didn't have eight he didn't have four he had seven and seven is what completion so in judges 16 4-9 and it came to pass afterward that he loved a woman in the valley of Sora whose name was Delilah and I looked up that name Sorak the valley of that that makes you know that it's it's something that's kind of seem like they always would fight in the valley every now and again they fought on mountains but most of the time in in the valley when uh when uh uh uh David had to fight Goliath it was in the valley and that's usually where the enemy take us in the valley you know we very seldom fight Wars on the mountain he takes us in the valley that name zorak means hissing it's like a color inclining to yellow and whenever we see yellow it's a caution a caution a caution or serpent hissing a caution and that's where he this is where uh uh uh Delilah was and if he could have understood the the the the name of Zoro he would have understood you better be careful boy I don't care how pretty she is you better be careful there's a cautious light is that right and the lord of the Philistines came up unto her and said unto her entice him and see wherein his strength lith and you understand what enticing is everybody know what that is it's the same thing the serpent did to eeve he enticed her he took something and he led her into an excitement or an exciting you know desire because the Bible said that she looked at it and she thought it was good and we find out that in this amen entice that word enticing is a is a strong word it's something that you and I have to be careful of because whenever you see the word enti you're also going to find lust somewhere and so he he the Philistines is in type and I'm going to get to that in just a moment the Philistines Amen in type was something but he she she the Philistines was overseeing Delilah somehow she was part of them and and they had rule over her now understand that Delila represents a church Samson represents the church Samson represents the true church Delilah represents the false one and he and she enticed him to see wherein his great strength lith and I get to this and I'm gonna go ahead on and read this and I'll come back and try to explain and by what means we he we may prevail over him that we may bind him to afflict him and we will give thee every one of us 1100 pieces of silver understand this now because there's a bargain there's a deal going on and it's all all being done through enticing and Delilah said to Samson tell me I pray thee wherein thy great strength lith and wherewith Ye Ye mightest be bound to afflict thee and Samson said unto her if they bind me with seven green wids that were never dried then shall I be weak and be as another man then the Lord of Philistines brought up to her seven green wi which had not been dried and she bound him with them and now there was a were men lying in weight abiding with her in the chamber and she said unto him the Philistines be upon thee Samson and he break the wi as a a a thread of toe is broken when is touched the fire so his strength was not known as I said Samson here is the type of the True Believer he's the true Church uh the true Ministry of the Holy Ghost I mean signs and wonders followed him you know all they had to do is say Samson's here and many of the Philistines would run and and you got to understand Philistines not only represents a a fake a false organization or church but it also represents demonic Powers but here's Samson who is a Nazarite and we we know the secret of of his Nazarite of being a Nazarite was uh the anointing or the uh the anointed mystery you know of those Seven Locks because remember God told his mom and his dad whatever you do don't let him cut it so anyhow we look at these things and we say Lord what is it that we don't know but here was the early church amen the first church was blessed with seven spirits of God and Seven Stars in his right hand and they were all abundant in faith and in the Supernatural what could touch the early church when they first were birthed cripples were walking dumb was talking dead was raised now I'm going all the way back to Pentecost now this is what the early church so you got to understand in this Samson story there must be seven Church ages and Seven Seals and however you want to put it because if it types us out we must find out where it's at we're at the end time Hallelujah and we must know amen that here was Samson amen as a shadow and a type of the Bride of Jesus Christ now I know that a lot of time people think amen that at the end of the day you know as I said before this great Jesus is going to crack the sky and everybody's going to start rising up and disappearing and that's that's not quite right that's not you won't find scripture that says that's the way he's coming his coming is a mystery hey everybody won't see him like that because the Rapture will take place and people won't even know it's gone so what are you talking about I'm saying even the Rapture to this day God will interpret it his way but no man know the day nor the hour but we know the season we're living in Revelations 2:1 says unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus all right these things say he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand and who walketh in the midst of the seven golden C sticks see the stars represented the light and the anointing of The Messengers and the Seven golden candlesticks represented the power of the Holy Ghost they had it right there amen with them and think about it how powerful they were when they first started I think 3,000 Souls were saved one time though they were poor didn't have much but one thing they did have was the anointing of their day so the first coming of the of Christ brought this power to the church they were Witnesses of Christ and Witnesses of uh to the power of the Holy Ghost you know they didn't have to wonder what it was they knew what it was was it was so powerful that it was it Simon the Sorcerer who wanted the Holy Ghost he wanted to buy it and it was the disciples says you're in the seed of Satan you a seed of the serpent you are evil if you think that the power of God can be bought but watch this now because here was Delilah trying to find out Samson secret cuz she she she's already done bought it or sold it before she can get it she was like Judas being bought by the Philistines I'm coming here cuz the Philistines that word also means villagers or can I say it like this denominations but they gathered together to do what destroy Samson because Samson was their enemy he was the target this message is the target yes this message is the enemy why because it exposes Satan that's right in his craftiness Hallelujah hey if I could get destroy him I got him and this is why people don't understand they said well what happened remember months ago maybe a year ago amen when they started this move uh you know uh believe the sign preach amen who who were Pastors in this church in Africa and everywhere else left the message and went back to the Catholic Church what was it that was the anointing it has to be there because you got to understand amen she comes to find your weaknesses she wants to know your power but see what they don't understand God didn't even reveal it to us so we can't tell them nothing we can say oh the seven Thunders but they don't know it we can say the Seven Seals but they can't understand it you see that's why God put it in that kind of grammar that grammar of the seven seal will Anno you if you're an intellect that's right but he he it behind Simplicity hallelujah what they don't understand is got God is a is a loaf of bread he breaks it up amen here a little there a little line upon line precept upon precept he hides it from the wise and The Prudent Hallelujah but she want to know his secret Hallelujah and they were Mighty and power like Samson right that early church amen they you know Samson what what did he do he was killed lions destroyed the destroyed the fields of the Philistines and he kill you know I talked about it last week he whipped those Philistines and put them in Three Stacks with the Jawbone of ass what was it that Jawbone of the ass amen it was a new Jawbone not only that it was anointed there is no way that he would have been able do you realize how thick those men helmets and everything else was in that day I don't even know how they held their heads up because the helmet was so sick but Samson took that jaw on boom and he killed now we don't know how long it took we think that every time he hit somebody they went out but it doesn't say it could have been an all day it could have been two days three days we don't know how long it took but at the end of the day he had to have time to whoop him and stack him at the same time right but in all of that he defeated the Philistines oh y'all understand me he took the gates of Gaza upon his back is that right he was such amazed he was such he he was a Marvel to him they they didn't understand he all the amazing feats that he did or had amen but that was the early church but soon There Rose a false church called Delilah now y'all know that's the scripture in that first church age what came huh she was aimed at and relaxed and what did they bring they brought a false Church in by way of deception by way of control by way of moving little doctrines is that right because that's what Paul said the Antichrist is already here he coming in and he's going to change your doctrines because you know when you change a word it brings in death sir and Delilah was that kind of a person you know Dela Delila it means you know feeble she she was like um but it wasn't like she was feeble it was it was a verb that kind of a thing that will cause you to be feeble and that's what she did she kept talking to Samson and all of us all of a sudden he became feeble he kept she kept working with with the the True Church of God y'all don't believe it it's the truth we didn't know the Antichrist Spirit at the end of the day was called Jezebel and Jezebel was just another type of Deliah and she woed him and woed him and you know what she she she became Samson weak spot she did did she had the ability to make the strong man Weak by what deception and that's what the CH that's what she did that thing that became a deed became a doctr and what did it do it made Ephesus weak and every time she brought a trick Samson came up out of it Hallelujah because even when when when it came that she would you think about it she had Samson so under her control that every time he she tried to deceive him she always had another man in her Chambers they were there waiting what was that that was the devil waiting to imprison Samson as soon as he got off the word is that right right because that's what he said oh he he's he's he's flirting with her you know I'll tell you a little bit he goes on and says I'll tell you a little bit about you know my my seven Thunder Revelation if you just bind me with this or bind me with that this is what's going to happen and it never happen because God cannot be bind she's a type of the false church this girl and if you understand by God's grace she's all right the Philistine types out Rome he's that four fourth be of Daniel's Vision so the spirit of wrome gets into her and entice or seduce the true church to find the source of her power don't tell me that didn't happen let's bring it all the way down to our day because that's what happened to the Pentecostal Church she used to be powerful but when demon shakarian flirted with Delilah he literally Gave Over his power her power is that right gave her power amen join in he she he seduced her and how did how did how did she seduce him I'm talking about how did Rome seduce him money that's what happened now they got big churches big Pentecostal churches Coliseum churches big churches why amen she's been seduced H I ain't against I'm just trying to preach the word of God I'm not against nobody but I'm against systems so the spirit of Rome gets into her to entice and to seduce the true church to find the source of her power see they thought it was speaking in tongues that ain't it speaking in tongues never been the power of the church ma speaking in tongue is the least of all gifts but now everybody think if I if I speak in tongues I got the power oh no no no no no see they don't even know see where that great strength liar see religious that white horse rider impersonation of Christianity and the source of his strength by what means we may prevail against him you see what I'm saying when you see people getting together what means what is that political let's find out how we can do this thing politically that's why I try to tell people amen you know what we need the Holy Ghost in This Church you don't know who's been sent here I remember in I Ohio amen my my house was bugged people were following me they might be still following I don't care didn't care then don't care now my point is amen they know you they know me there is no hiding place outside of Jesus Christ and it it behooves us today to make sure you got the good amen I've learned some things about Grace and I've learned some things about God in these last this Corona virus probably been the best thing that could have happened for me spiritually y'all understand me I know many people have died and many people have gotten sick but I'm trying to tell you it was a eyeopener for me my scripture the scripture of this Bible has now been unfolding and unfolding unfolding and unfolding and all along we've known this but it yet it still took us by our surprise political right that red horse rider and so you better understand where I'm going with this if those horses are riding which they are what's coming what is now the spirit of that P that pale horse rider I'm jumping my message I'm jumping but you got to understand the end result of this is death amen you understand me but like I said it you know there's victory in death amen because Samson said Lord let me die with my enemy but he knew that if he would die with his enemy he was going to rise again amen y'all understand me in other words I will not bow I will not Bend I will not break there'll not be a mark of the beast here and whatever it takes God will keep me and we shall stand am right that's what it is see what happened that political uh politician came in riding on that red horse the church and state with equal find a way so that we can get equal grounds so we can destroy him by numbers and you see no matter what they did throughout history they thought they were going to defeat Ephesus and they couldn't they thought they were going to defeat Smyrna but they couldn't we killed them all they couldn't kill them all by killing them it made them stronger what is that secret those people God Amen that makes them that way we got to kill them well let me say it like this if you didn't kill Jesus and if you couldn't kill Jesus you surely can't kill his children amen hallelujah cuz they made out of the same substance Hallelujah I hope I'm being you being blessed tonight because I want you to understand that this in this these things I keep working with Samson because there's a lot more to Samson than the whole judges there's a lot to it and by God's grace I hope we get a chance to go through all as many that we may bind see that what was it what binds you what binds a person other than demon power brother Brooks I'm trying to tell us something here and maybe I'll jump a little bit and then have to come back around but my point is this he told her if you cut off my seven lcks now I'm jumping but I'll come back to it then I'll lose power I won't have no more Authority and when she cut those Seven Locks off yall understand what I'm trying to say she brought so much confusion in the church through her denominationalism and her false teachings Jezebel did and what happened when you break one word you go into darkness and it put Samson into a place now watch this because the Pentecostals and I'm jumping back and forth I hope you see where I'm working cu the Pentecostals of our day they saw the Spirit of Samson they saw it right but demon sharan start flirting with all the organizations Billy Graham as well but he didn't do what Deus did Demus led the UPC right into the World Council of churches and at that point she takes the mark of the beast now watch Leia she's blind she's naked but listen my son was asking me the other day he said Daddy you know you're talking about uh churches that have prospered and all that I said don't you know the original Church ain't never had nothing I said only in this age have we become rich and increase with good and have need of nothing I said but the early church where Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I Thee but how did we get rich we got rich like Delilah we sold out to the Philistine which is representation of the Catholic Ro Roman Catholic Church understand amen the Philistines they never did get rid of and this church this bride you're not going to get rid of the Catholic Church she's here to stay the only person only one will ever get rid of her is God himself they bribe we've been here for 2,000 years or more no other organization has been here yeah that's right it's true look what you were and look what you are now oh yes and the Bible says amen she's bringing everybody to their knees all whose names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life shall will take the mark of the beast and here we are in this last day and we're like Samson say what you want to say but as a whole we're just like samon eyes plucked out going around in circles grinding the meal huh grinding the meal while they make fun of us y'all say y'all got a prophet and y'all supposed to be this and y'all say ye are gods and y'all say this and that y'all predestinated and y'all elected and look at you your whole thing is falling apart you know why because we let some of the Philistines in we let those S those people seduce us they found out where the power was you don't need no Holy Ghost Holy Ghost without sensation hello what was that now these same people that brought the doctrine is no longer among us but they weakened us now people don't even know what the Holy Ghost is when it's already been preached to us you can't live and live you got to die and live and that's what the people don't want to do they want to die they don't want to die but one thing about Samson he said he came to that conclusion I've been wrong I have sinned I've done wrong I've allowed the Philistines the influence the Lusty the the the the seduced duction amen get a hold of me I'm there but there's a possibility he said Lord remember me I like that statement some say Lord remember me you ordained me Hallelujah is that right he was chosen he was elected Amen to destroy the Philistines amen so is a bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah she is designed to De be to De to defeat Satan in his own Eden is he there like I said I jumped all over my message but Delilah in the 16th chapter 10th verse say Delilah said unto Samson behold thou has mocked me and told me lies now tell me I pray thee wherewith thou mightest be bound and he said unto her if they bind me fast with new ropes that never was occupied then shall I be weak and be as another man Delilah said therefore took two ropes and bound him therewith and said unto him the Philistines be upon thee Samson and they were liar lying in weight about abiding in the chamber and he break them from off his arms like a thread and Delilah said unto Samson hitherto thou Hast mocked me and told me lies tell me therewith thou mightest be bound and he said unto her if thou weaves the Seven Locks of my head with the web and she fastened it with pin and said unto him the Philistines be upon thee Samson and he wake out of his sleep and went away with the pin of the beam and with the well and she said unto him how cast thou say I love thee when thine heart is not with me oh my thou has marked me these three times and has not told me wherein thou great strength lith now if you can't see how the enemy comes in with that second seal in this thing and the thing that he's doing is trying to bind the first forse Rider than the red one and now she's wooing him she's working with him and he's just kind of giving her all kind of intellectual answers but we know one thing that in that second seal is when they began to legislate and you know made doctrines laws and you know you know making the church and state join amen together and and and and and what did that do that crippled the church but they were still strong under that Ox anointing there was revealed in the giving up of their lives and become martys for Christ and it it only made them stronger as I said under that you see what what I'm saying is even though church and state joined together that little group was still as strong and you know what they became Martyrs you can't put this down you can't stop it it is what it is you know but we know by God's grace and then Delilah and then when she saw that she was defeated she got angry but you know what sometimes we we got to understand this did theila you know she was a prostitute and no doubt she she did what was necessary to weaken Samson she basically wanted to dominate him and every time she thought she could use her sexuality to weaken weaken him and break him down he always pull a trick on him and that's the way it is that's the way it is spiritually we don't even see it but that's what seducing Spirits do they come to break you down they come to to to to to den uh how can I say uh to rule over you because the Bible said who you yield your members to obey that's who you your servants to and she got mad remember when Jezebel got mad even a prophet called Elijah was a scared afraid of her he himself cuz Jezebel said I'm going to kill you huh I'm going to kill you I'm put you know mean she and guess what Elijah got out of her way and when the anointing of God is Not on you you ain't nothing that's right I don't care who you think you are with that anointing is not there you are nothing amen Samson was nothing without the anointing it proves it am Pentecost look at them they can shout they can dance they can run up and down the house they can speak and I'm talking about everybody that them to be that listen that's not where the power lay that wasn't Samson's strength the strength first of all was in the Covenant amen hallelujah come on and you got to realize that Samson had an unconditional Covenant is that right he sure did he did wrong he paid for it oh y'all think oh I got an unconditional Covenant I ain't going to pay for it yes you are you're going to pay for whatever sin you do you going to pay for it but at the end of the day God will save you amen is that right and just observe it I'm going on he is you know even in the third seal if you want to go and he is getting weaker where where see him bringing up those Seven Locks of his hair see she's getting closer to the truth he gives her an intellectual idea of his Seven Locks and she tries with demon power all those lies she's telling with telling him you know and and she's just flirting and I wish I was an actor I put it on for you tonight but I'm not an actor you know but my thing is I mean she did all the the the the the things that a woman would do to to lure him and to seduce him and one of the things she didn't began to work a little psychology on him you ought to be ashamed of yourself and say you're a man of God and won't tell me the truth and every time I you tell me it's a lie and it's just so Samson was still blind in his Spirit he may have had eyes to see but he was blind he couldn't see what the woman was doing hello amen so was the Pentecostal Church of our day she couldn't see what join in what that church was doing to her she was Mo literally moving into what they call the mark of the beast she's now Grand they great they got big money they but they don't understand they are the image to the Beast I'm talking about what's the reality of our day now they G to shut this down one of these old days and so I'm hoping that you getting this in your soul it took so much more believable she weaved a web into his locks and pinned it down to a horizontal beam seemingly trapping his head completely this shows a war of intelligence yeah yeah and under that third seal was a false Doctrine after the defeat of the Catholic Church see the spirit of the enemy trying to trap the church in a web of teachings that they had different interpretations for the teaching of Christ and of the Old Testament though they came out of the mother Church they began to to devil into demonic doctrines and belief and that's exactly what happened they came out under that intelligent age Luther right but then after they came out they start dabbling into those things that were not scriptural hallelujah amen what was it he had her he had tied her down Hallelujah but it didn't last amen because even under that int intellectual age we had great men like Martin Luther and John Wesley and a host of intellectual or intelligent minds of the Gospel that was constantly able to steer each denomination away from receiving the mark of the beast in their time this ain't something new we've known for years about the mark of the beast and our church amen America was found upon freedom of religion what were we doing running from the Philistines running from Rome freedom of religion again H but oh oh my she slick when Delila kept seeing I I gotta I got I gotta I gotta get her somehow I gotta when he I gotta get I got to get Samson son house you know I got to get him I got to I got to find a way you know she she you know she carried on like little hurt girl and you know what I'm saying she oh she went through her motions mhm and know Samson finally broke down right but see what people don't understand is that we're living in the day of oh Lord once more you and I know we want Revival but you know what the only way we going to get it we must die to ourselves the secret of the anointing returning was a mystery and I'm going to close in just a bit because I don't I don't want to go too far with this I'll finish it up Sunday evening my point is this when the pale house came pale hor came through that was that second depth before the first depth the depth of the soul to death and he followed after him now watch this because when Delilah came she was that type of the false church now look at this you didn't even know the false Church existed did we until God broke the seals it separated the false and the TRU here was a church amen producing twins they look so much alike but one amen has been ordained to be anointed again amen see Samson coming or the first coming was great but the second coming which is Samson again which is a bride of Jesus Christ in her Ministry but in order for her to defeat the Philistines she must die to herself amen she must must confess she must ask God for forgiveness and she must cry out oh Lord once more Lord remember me she made a deal with Rome Philistines telling them she was ready to join them and they brought her money see that's what she did when they asked her to do it she joined them this is the first age because that that you know where we C became rich and increased with good think about it how do we get it all of a sudden we would just pour on the corner shaking the tamarine now we've got these huge churches that call themselves huh and they say we're on fire you know why because everybody even myself have been guilty of it expecting to see jumping and shouting and running and dancing and that's not real fire real fire is when you can't help it help but tell somebody about Jesus cuz remember on the day of Pentecost when the fire fell they were dancing shouting running but you know what they were declaring Jesus is Alive that's when you're on fire when Jesus becomes so real you can't can't keep your mouth shut amen so let me move on and I'm just getting ready to say it we're the only one that types out it types out Samson because a lot of time we say well Samson was blind and didn't know it well one thing about Samson when the Philistines finished with them he was rendered powerless he was weak and he was the worst of all and they didn't know him he didn't even know it he he didn't know it you said what do you mean he really couldn't see his condition until his condition saw him he was blind stripped at the meal slavy is what it was slavery to what Philistines slavery to sin slavery to have it slavery slavery slavery right he got tired of it but here's the mystery he didn't even know that while he was going through the mockery while he was going through the suffering his locks had grown back the Philistines were so into their Amusement that they didn't even see the Covenant had been restored I don't know who braided his hair how the locks came back but he just went like this there was nobody there to comb his hair nobody to braided or give it any kind of manicure or whatever you call it but somehow something stirred his heart he got tired of the laughter he got tired of the mockery he got he realized amen there might have been other shows but he was the center of Attraction y'all better hear what I'm saying this message is the center of Attraction and somehow we ought to want to see it live again amen something got to start oh Lord remember me that's all I'm saying Lord remember me I'm wrong I I I make my confession I'm not on fire like I desire to be hallelujah oh no there's no way I'm where I ought to be now I can say it y'all that's between you and God all I'm trying to say is that what I read in the Bible is what I want to see in me I'm I'm not talking about some some mocra lifestyle I'm talking about something that's so powerful my life is just like Christ hello that's what we are called to be and you and I must understand by God's grace this is the day we're living in you are going to either take the mark of the beast or you going to be sealed by the Holy Ghost oh Lord once more you say that can't be bride it is bride and I'll continue on this lesson come Sunday but let me tell you something people of God we're right at the brink of something our country is falling and ain't not but one church that can can raise us up I didn't say one country I say church that's what it's going to be everybody every country in the world bows to the wrong Minds mystery Babylon the Great first wrong was destroyed but this spiritual one be here when Jesus come back nothing to be able to break her ho but Jesus himself and he takes us out that's what I love about it he takes us out Amen to be with him do y'all realize what I'm trying to say what are you saying because if you read the Bible you find out that the Antichrist become the Beast and the Beast become I the false prophet the Beast and y'all know how it works so you got to understand this ain't no joke this ain't no play play brother bam said you know when it comes to the persecution of this thing what Hitler did to the Jews would be Child's Play huh Child's Play do you know what those Jews went through and then you got people say it never happened are you serious Child's Play and nobody nothing can be more crueler than those Devils from the anian those Devils that was from from anian day they're alive now you say oh they awake now and the only thing that's hoing now is certain laws but we got a government right now that's going to let a lot of stuff loose y'all I tell you what I better not say that but they might have the sirines out my door but my point is this people of God it's serious and I don't know whether I made it clear but maybe maybe next week I mean Sunday evening I'll make it even more clear but we're we're at a place right now if you know seals and some of the church ages and what they with stood and what went on during that time time you would see this thing moving right in just by the way Delila is saying things and and what's being taking place what's taking place and understand those three steps came up to the for point and what happened we went in into to to to such a such a age of murdering killing and you know and we're getting ready to see that come again no not in America no not just in America all the whole world anybody nobody won get in the way you know I mean I mean I uh Obama said this thing is coming nobody will be able to resist it he said it nobody will be able to resist it no matter what but he don't know about the bride you see we'll resist it we've been ordained to resist it we'll come down to the last little moment but at that moment will be changed yes sir yes sir we got a promise y'all stand understand oh Lord remember me remember me father God we come before you Lord we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy Lord we just thank you for being so good to us Lord you know my heart you know my inner being you know my strength you know my weaknesses you know all of us Lord father you know the beginning and the ending and Lord we believe with all of our heart that this message have been sent to us and we believe by God's grace that something is moving Samson hair grew back and he didn't even understand didn't know it was a mystery to the Philistines it was a mystery to Samson but as the hair grew the strength the courage grew with him and father he began to see himself way off of the promise and all he could do is say Lord once more don't let this church go down as a laughing star but may she be raised to complete victory over the Demonic powers of this age they've made moery of this message Lord they brought confusion in this message but father you say that
