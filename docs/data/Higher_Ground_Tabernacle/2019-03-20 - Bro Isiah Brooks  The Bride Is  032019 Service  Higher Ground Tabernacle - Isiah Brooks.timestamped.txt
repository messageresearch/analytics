[33:34] Amen now as we stand but go right into
[33:41] the word of the Lord
[33:46] gonna come from James the first chapter
[33:52] xxii verse Matthew 25 James 1 beginning
[34:08] at the 22nd verse but be doers of the
[34:14] word and not hearers only deceiving
[34:19] yourselves for if any be a hearer of the
[34:24] word and not a doer he is like unto a
[34:29] man beholding his natural face in a
[34:32] glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth
[34:36] his way and straightway forgetteth what
[34:39] manner of man he was but whoso looketh
[34:43] into the perfect law of Liberty and
[34:49] continueth therein he being not a
[34:53] forgetful hearer but a doer of the work
[34:57] this man shall be blessed in his deed
[35:02] Matthew 25 beginning at the first verse
[35:07] that's in the New Testament first book
[35:16] then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be
[35:19] likened to ten virgins which took their
[35:23] lamps and went forth to meet the
[35:25] bridegroom and five of them were wise
[35:29] five were foolish remember that five
[35:33] were wise and five were foolish they
[35:36] that were foolish took their lamps and
[35:38] took no oil with them but the wise took
[35:41] oil in their vessels with their lamps
[35:44] why the bridegroom tarried they all
[35:47] slumbered and slept and at midnight
[35:51] there was a cry made behold the
[35:53] bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him
[35:57] so know that the wise and the foolish
[36:00] slumbered and slept then all those
[36:03] virgins 7 first arose and trimmed their
[36:05] lamps and the foolish said unto the wise
[36:08] give us of your oil for our lamps are
[36:11] going out but the wise answered saying
[36:14] not so lest there be not enough for us
[36:18] and you but go ye rather to them that
[36:21] sell and buy for yourself know that this
[36:26] selling is about prayer ok and while
[36:29] they went out to buy the bridegroom came
[36:31] and they that were ready went in with
[36:34] him to the marriage and the door was
[36:38] shut after what came also the other
[36:41] virgins saying Lord Lord open to us but
[36:46] he answered and said verily I say unto
[36:48] you I know you not watch therefore for
[36:52] you know neither the day nor the hour
[36:56] wherein the Son of man cometh let us
[37:00] pray
[37:01] father God we come before your Lord
[37:03] Jesus as humbly as we know how and we
[37:05] thank you for your grace and your mercy
[37:07] father we thank you for your cleansing
[37:10] power we thank you for Lord your your
[37:14] your way of doing things there is none
[37:17] like your Lord there never be any like
[37:20] you and we pray father God that you
[37:23] grant this service a blessing bless your
[37:27] people Lord give us a
[37:29] to here and are hard to receive and will
[37:32] be careful to give you the praise glory
[37:34] in honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[37:37] amen
[37:38] you may be seated we're really glad to
[37:42] see everybody out tonight I like to
[37:48] entitle this message the bride is and
[37:52] there's so much that could be said or
[37:55] that can be said and so you know I'm not
[37:58] gonna be able to say at all but I will
[38:02] by God's grace tried to expound on what
[38:05] the things in which God has given me and
[38:08] I thought to myself when God was giving
[38:11] me this message the first scripture that
[38:12] he gave me was the one in James because
[38:17] we must remember who we are and what we
[38:20] come for we did not come into this world
[38:23] to just have pleasure to live rich rich
[38:29] in a way of being rich we we didn't come
[38:32] for pleasure and and we didn't come to
[38:35] make a name for ourselves if you can
[38:38] recall in the Bible according to Genesis
[38:40] Adam and II were made to reflect not
[38:45] only to reflect God but to worship Him
[38:48] and so they had a direct contact with
[38:51] the Living God
[38:53] there was no in-betweens or no middleman
[38:56] at the time when they were created to
[38:59] worship God now we know that the serpent
[39:02] was about his business but before that
[39:05] they worshiped God and the way they
[39:08] worship God was to keep his commandment
[39:10] and that was they can have and do
[39:13] whatever they chose would choose to do
[39:15] the only thing that God told them not to
[39:18] do that was to eat of the tree of the
[39:21] knowledge of good and evil and by
[39:24] disobeying one word we see what has
[39:28] happened and that's how you really
[39:32] worship God you worship God in obeying
[39:35] his word all right living under his word
[39:40] now we the Bible tells us
[39:43] that basically this Bible is our mirror
[39:47] if you really want to know where you
[39:50] stand in God here it is if you read this
[39:54] Bible the Bible will tell you exactly
[39:57] what kind of a person you are it also
[40:00] gives you hope it shows you the kind of
[40:04] person that you can and could be so you
[40:08] know this Bible is up a mysterious book
[40:11] everybody can read it but everybody
[40:14] can't understand it it is given to a
[40:17] selected group of people and these
[40:19] people that were selected they were
[40:22] elected from the foundation of the world
[40:25] you have heard me use this scenario a
[40:29] cow doesn't go to school to learn cow
[40:32] language and its birth he understands
[40:36] his mama and his daddy a dog doesn't go
[40:39] to dog school to understand his mom and
[40:43] dad he doesn't learn how to learn how to
[40:45] bark now but because we are fallen we
[40:49] learn how to talk we learn how to
[40:51] understand our parents and our parents
[40:54] must learn how to understand us and that
[40:58] is one of those things that shows that
[41:00] we are fallen creatures but when you're
[41:03] born again and you're born of God you
[41:06] understand God's language hallelujah
[41:10] just because we're born of that nature
[41:13] and once you're born of the nature of
[41:16] God this Bible becomes a open book
[41:21] now you and I by God's grace understand
[41:25] this Bible feeds your Holy Spirit if you
[41:31] want to get stronger in God you read the
[41:33] word this Bible in it lays
[41:39] transformation power it is the thing
[41:42] that will transform you and change you
[41:46] right we don't need as I said a new
[41:50] lease on life
[41:52] we need a new life a new kind of life
[41:55] and
[41:57] you know and I know that we were born
[42:00] Amen by God's grace with with with the
[42:05] the nature of a conquer burrow a sinner
[42:11] the Bible said we have all sinned and
[42:14] come short of the glory of God it
[42:18] doesn't matter if you had the seed of
[42:19] gene in you when you were born into this
[42:22] world you and I were born sinners and
[42:26] there are things in us even in our
[42:29] damnable nature in that sinful nature
[42:33] there was still a cry for truth a cry
[42:37] for God and for some reason that however
[42:41] it works that that gene that
[42:44] representation that God placed in us
[42:46] even as sinners always made us know when
[42:51] we were wrong we didn't know how to
[42:53] control it we didn't know how to get out
[42:56] of it and it literally controlled us we
[43:00] were consumed by it we were dead in sin
[43:03] right and so therefore it was basically
[43:07] basically our master we were controlled
[43:10] by darkness even though we had a gene
[43:13] seed or representation of God in us the
[43:17] gospel is the light it is the voice of
[43:22] God and when the voice of God spoke to
[43:27] each and every one of us no matter where
[43:30] we were in life we could have been a
[43:32] whoremonger or whatever the case may be
[43:34] a drunkard on the Attic of some sort but
[43:37] when that light struck the seed
[43:39] something came to life and when that
[43:44] came to life it literally began to
[43:46] identify somehow something changed you
[43:50] know you began let me say it like this
[43:53] if you would like me you know I used to
[43:57] be what they call a party animal I went
[43:59] out and I drank and I did a lot of
[44:01] things right and and and there is a
[44:04] season in my life I really enjoyed it as
[44:09] a sinner I
[44:11] people say well you know I just ate the
[44:13] Lord from delivered me from a miserable
[44:15] life I said it did not become miserable
[44:18] until God started dealing with you
[44:25] before God start dealing with you you
[44:28] enjoy doing that I did and and you'll be
[44:33] a liar to say that you do didn't because
[44:36] God had to do something somewhere you
[44:39] heard a word I saw something Sean
[44:41] Christian something that had like to
[44:44] instruct you yeah
[44:46] my point is you and I realize amen okay
[44:50] especially when you heard the gospel
[44:52] that God tell us about it when God saved
[44:56] me or even before he saved me I knew
[44:59] that God was not three persons I knew
[45:03] God was one and I knew Jesus Christ was
[45:06] God now I didn't know how I couldn't
[45:10] read the Bible at that time but even in
[45:12] my my god dealing with me I was in a
[45:17] Baptist Church a woman preacher got up I
[45:20] knew that was wrong it scared me to
[45:23] death I went back home I said mama
[45:25] they had a lady there she got up an
[45:28] appropriate to preach her name was
[45:30] Reverend Pierson I said mama that wrong
[45:33] now on air literate woman talks to me
[45:37] and she says yes jr. that's wrong and
[45:40] God don't like it now I'm saying these
[45:44] things because they're things in your
[45:45] life things that you knew don't know how
[45:48] you came to know it but see God dropped
[45:51] that in on you that was that election
[45:54] that God had and and now it's beginning
[45:57] to express itself
[45:58] I went from church to church to church I
[46:01] knew everybody's doctrine whether be
[46:04] Baptist Pentecostal you know Catholic
[46:08] and you all that but you see there was
[46:10] still a thirst there was something in me
[46:13] that made me know I was not to be the
[46:19] way I am I didn't enjoy me anymore
[46:22] I hate
[46:24] me hello until you hate you you ain't
[46:29] going nowhere as long as you can love
[46:32] yourself you're not going anywhere
[46:35] you've got to learn how to hate this old
[46:39] man now let me go on to say this right
[46:45] now who do you say you are who and what
[46:52] do you see when you're looking into the
[46:55] mirror of the word when you actually are
[47:00] there and you're reading this word my
[47:04] question is can you comprehend it
[47:06] the word is comprehensible when you're
[47:10] born again hello but if you're not
[47:15] comprehensible maybe there's an
[47:17] experience that you're lacking
[47:19] hallelujah that will change that right
[47:24] because the carnal mind cannot perceive
[47:27] those things that are spiritual it takes
[47:30] a spiritual mind and the only way you
[47:33] can have a spiritual mind you must be
[47:35] born again spiritually right you
[47:39] understand me
[47:40] so James is saying sometimes we allow
[47:44] this French because listen this old man
[47:47] is still alive every day until you kill
[47:52] him
[47:54] this old man right now this flesh is not
[47:58] converted don't treat it like it is
[48:04] don't deceive yourself because you said
[48:07] all I'm saved but this man still needs
[48:10] to be changed and he will be redeemed
[48:13] and changed at the twinkling of an eye
[48:18] when God changes us from mortal
[48:21] immortality that's the only time this
[48:24] old body will be changed so people get
[48:27] mixed up because this man has a mind and
[48:31] we fail to see the Bible says greater is
[48:34] He that is in you is the whole
[48:38] the ghost mine that is greater than the
[48:40] fleshly mind and Paul said you must kill
[48:43] him every day right and that's where we
[48:49] hope I'm in the message oh praise God no
[48:52] no no no Amen even the prophet of God
[48:55] had they put a cross in front you've got
[48:58] to keep Jesus before you everyday at all
[49:02] times
[49:04] hallelujah is that Alright but we'll
[49:07] call to the highest calling do you
[49:10] realize that the bride of this age will
[49:13] get the greatest reward of all the ages
[49:18] mmm think about it Paul had a great age
[49:22] called Ephesus they were the word
[49:25] hallelujah they were all matured people
[49:28] that really saw the move of God and yet
[49:31] in this age if you overcome this your
[49:38] reward will be far above any other age
[49:43] hallelujah
[49:44] I'd like to say seven times higher is
[49:50] that right
[49:51] but we must remind ourselves on a daily
[49:54] basis of who we are who are you
[49:59] you must continually speak I am the
[50:04] bride the bride has no negative words
[50:12] coming out of her mouth and if Psalm
[50:15] should slip she immediately corrects it
[50:20] the bride must be positive in every
[50:25] situation you don't come whole Lord rose
[50:30] me no walls no walls to the ride see my
[50:37] point is no matter what you going
[50:39] through I was telling a thing of her
[50:42] brother Keith I said I wake up with the
[50:45] morning and in brother Troy the Satan is
[50:48] always when I wake up in the morning
[50:50] he's a you a nut butter
[50:51] it doesn't matter how long I pray I
[50:55] never pray enough for him
[50:58] he's always cutting me down he's always
[51:01] telling me what I am NOT but one thing I
[51:05] remember about the devil he's a liar so
[51:12] if he's if he's a liar all you got to do
[51:14] is reverse what he's saying and you'll
[51:17] get the truth about yourself you must
[51:21] know that you in battle and right now
[51:24] this battle is the greatest battle ever
[51:26] fought mmm where in your mind oh I just
[51:31] feel like I'm gonna lose it don't say it
[51:35] you might feel it but you must recognize
[51:38] why you feeling that is because the
[51:41] devil is pressing on your mind he wants
[51:46] you to speak it out of your mouth
[51:47] because you're the only person that can
[51:49] curse you Satan can curse you he cannot
[51:54] curse you but when you out of your own
[51:57] mouth confesses yourself it meant then
[52:00] he gets you on your own words why you
[52:04] say that brother Brooks because you and
[52:06] I are little creators we are in the
[52:10] image and likeness of God and he gave us
[52:13] a voice and words because we could speak
[52:15] things and these things will have to
[52:18] happen and don't you know that even if
[52:21] it's negative if you're not careful it
[52:23] will happen Elijah said Lord let the
[52:28] fire fall and the fire fail right and he
[52:35] cursed those children and guess what the
[52:37] Lions ate them see you have to be
[52:40] careful on the things you say as sons
[52:42] and daughters of God hallelujah
[52:46] your words are more powerful than
[52:48] witchcraft no evil shall come now my
[52:54] place
[52:59] you know that you and I must realized a
[53:02] man that we was always examine ourselves
[53:05] in the mirror do we do that every day we
[53:10] get in our mirror at home don't we yeah
[53:15] and no matter how you think about
[53:18] yourself you want to groom in it a
[53:19] little bit right here is your grooming
[53:23] mirror huh if you need a shave this is
[53:27] gonna tell you you need to say trim it
[53:30] off boy trim it off right whatever God
[53:35] will reveal it in his word
[53:37] I'm not even no no listen the bride is a
[53:40] virtuous woman I love that word virtuous
[53:45] because y'all know the kind of
[53:47] wickedness you know yeah yeah how can it
[53:52] be brother
[53:54] but with all with God all things are
[53:57] possible
[53:59] the Bible says you can find a virtuous
[54:01] woman for her price is far above rubies
[54:06] did you know the Bible said a wise woman
[54:08] builds her house and let me say like
[54:13] this this is your church this is your
[54:15] house you build it you don't tear it
[54:18] down hello come on somebody you don't
[54:23] tear it down you build it up you build
[54:26] your brothers you build your sisters
[54:28] everything you say about your brothers
[54:30] and your sisters should be positive if
[54:33] you cannot say any positive things you
[54:36] shouldn't be they shouldn't be said at
[54:38] all the Bible said the heart of a
[54:44] husband does safely trust in her so that
[54:47] he shall have no need of spoil that
[54:52] means God don't have to worry about you
[54:55] church hopping switching doctrines and
[54:58] all that kind of stuff
[55:00] now get me right it ain't the church
[55:02] that's right is the word that's right
[55:04] and all of us has come from somebodies
[55:08] church or somewhere somehow we all part
[55:11] of coming out of her
[55:12] right but we come to a place where this
[55:17] become our headship right this is our
[55:21] head whatever the Bible says this is
[55:24] what we'll do this is how we obey Him he
[55:29] becomes alive she will do him good and
[55:34] not evil all the days of her life I'm
[55:37] talking about a virtuous woman hello and
[55:43] she has a ministry do y'all have a
[55:46] ministry do we have a ministry all of us
[55:49] have a ministry she opened her mouth
[55:52] with wisdom and the tongue is the law of
[55:56] kindness oh lord help us Jesus we need
[56:01] some kindness hmm when you find yourself
[56:08] frustrated and angry all the time
[56:11] understand that is a devil right the
[56:15] Bible says that if you know God inhabits
[56:19] his for the praise of the people in the
[56:23] fullness in his presence is fullness of
[56:27] joy so if you angry frustrated whatever
[56:31] the case may be somewhere you've gotten
[56:33] out of his presence hello and the dove
[56:36] is gone but when you're in the right
[56:42] character the dog comes down these sins
[56:45] and now you're just a sweet and all you
[56:49] can do is say some cuckoo words yeah
[56:53] you're learning how to coo coo right and
[56:55] then that's God her children rise up and
[57:00] call her blessed her husband also and he
[57:03] praises her that's like every man
[57:07] supposed to praise his wife
[57:13] you suppose say good things when you
[57:16] know you feel like it hello y'all better
[57:21] understand me you are little creators
[57:24] and you create the atmosphere you can
[57:28] change the wife attitude yes this
[57:33] fussing and caring I'll go give him a
[57:35] big hole you might have to dug first but
[57:38] no stop I shouldn't have said hey
[57:42] forgive me but the truth of the matter
[57:45] is you can change the atmosphere just
[57:49] with words and every woman love words
[57:54] that's why the Bible brought it this way
[57:57] hallelujah
[57:58] when you know Abraham Amen when he went
[58:02] to ella ella
[58:04] Iza when ella either went to get Rebecca
[58:06] what did he have now he had gifts but he
[58:09] had words and no doubt amen he told her
[58:13] Isaac was what kind of character
[58:15] amen he was and guess what she fell in
[58:19] love with him never ever seen him before
[58:23] that's how you fall in love with God
[58:25] when the preacher bring it right huh
[58:29] if he pleased it bring it right and then
[58:31] you will fall in love with this Bible
[58:33] and you'll go home and a I gotta see
[58:36] what's in here
[58:37] read your messages a man is because of
[58:41] the way he bring it something you wanna
[58:43] know more about her tell me more tell me
[58:45] more
[58:47] right many daughters have done
[58:52] virtuously but thou excel at them all
[58:56] that's us
[59:00] see I can't make it I can't make you
[59:02] believe that but you gotta believe it
[59:04] that's us hallelujah you know my brother
[59:09] better than ever is because the banner
[59:15] over us is love
[59:17] you don't mind me calling your name do
[59:19] you that was a good one
[59:23] but you know we look at things and you
[59:25] know i'ma tell you
[59:26] something I'm excited because I realized
[59:28] by God's grace that love is the only
[59:31] thing that's gonna conquer your enemy it
[59:36] conquers every time all the time right
[59:39] and you and I must understand oh I don't
[59:42] know how ask God and the Bible said if
[59:46] you got the Holy Ghost you don't need to
[59:47] know how it's already in you the problem
[59:51] is sometimes we have imprisoned him
[59:53] we've locked him up with our own fleshly
[59:56] desires but God wants to be expressed
[59:59] you've heard me say this a lot of times
[1:00:02] and then our alcoholics period you don't
[1:00:04] need the Holy Ghost to overcome
[1:00:06] alcoholism there's a lot of alcoholics
[1:00:11] that have overcome without the Holy
[1:00:13] Ghost you know how you do that it's
[1:00:16] painful but if you resist the devil the
[1:00:21] Bible shall hear from you it's true if
[1:00:25] you won't give that devil that drink or
[1:00:27] he said just one more just one more
[1:00:29] don't give him the one law and he's
[1:00:33] gonna leave you when he see that he
[1:00:35] cannot get you to drink why cuz he's an
[1:00:38] alcoholic spirit he will recede he won't
[1:00:41] express himself in you and if he can't
[1:00:45] express himself and you guess what he
[1:00:47] will find somebody else
[1:00:49] it doesn't mean iam come back now
[1:00:51] they'll say the devil he'll come back
[1:00:54] he'll try to get back in you but don't
[1:00:57] let him do it huh you have to tell him
[1:01:02] what this hotel is fool this hotel is
[1:01:08] for normal reservations and you can't
[1:01:11] come in right so that's the way you have
[1:01:14] to do it no matter what it is another
[1:01:19] brother night we were talking if you got
[1:01:21] a line spirit the thing is you're gonna
[1:01:23] have to stop lying
[1:01:26] you got to confess it first tell the
[1:01:29] devil you know about it definitely the
[1:01:31] most Saints you say tell her tell the
[1:01:33] truth and shame the devil
[1:01:36] yeah let's go on
[1:01:39] just throwing things out because I
[1:01:40] really believe that this is the will of
[1:01:42] the Lord listen the Bible says favor is
[1:01:45] deceitful and beauty is vain but the
[1:01:49] woman that feareth the Lord she shall be
[1:01:53] praised hello
[1:01:58] favor is deceitful and that's what a lot
[1:02:02] of times people think or they think
[1:02:04] great gain is godliness God is favoring
[1:02:07] me I got all kinds of stuff now I got a
[1:02:10] Cadillac I got a new house I got a new
[1:02:12] that oh look how God is blessing that
[1:02:15] ain't nothing you can lose those things
[1:02:19] just like that it doesn't mean that God
[1:02:23] is failure God reigns on the just and
[1:02:26] the unjust
[1:02:27] and because a person is poor doesn't
[1:02:30] mean that they're cashed I had no one
[1:02:35] his name was Lazarus he was so poor he
[1:02:39] couldn't even afford a happy me he
[1:02:43] couldn't he couldn't go to McDonald's he
[1:02:45] couldn't go y'all know why I'm using
[1:02:47] that term these terms cuz you can relate
[1:02:49] to this a lot of us get attitudes
[1:02:51] because we don't have enough money to
[1:02:53] buy something this man was so poor he
[1:02:58] was begging fighting animals or dogs for
[1:03:01] the crumbs y'all understand me now how
[1:03:06] many of us that poor but he never never
[1:03:11] cursed God he was more blessed than the
[1:03:13] rich man and when they died both of them
[1:03:17] died the rich man with the hell and
[1:03:19] Lazarus went where in the bosom of
[1:03:21] Abraham see so you can't don't get me
[1:03:25] wrong all of us love to be blessed but
[1:03:29] like the Bible says even that could be
[1:03:31] deceitful hmm that's the Bible the year
[1:03:38] King Uzziah died I saw the Lord
[1:03:41] why because King Uzziah was so blessed
[1:03:44] by God he thought he can become a priest
[1:03:47] it wasn't given to him to be a priest he
[1:03:50] was a king and when he messed
[1:03:52] guess what God struck him with leprosy
[1:03:54] because he stepped out of his position
[1:03:57] but that's what blessings will do
[1:03:59] sometimes blessings will give you put
[1:04:02] you in a you have to watch the devil
[1:04:03] that's all I'm saying I'm not cutting
[1:04:06] down nobody blessing I love blessings I
[1:04:09] love I love signs I love wonders but I
[1:04:13] know one thing I love character his
[1:04:17] character right uh-huh
[1:04:23] it's the truth look at look at all of
[1:04:26] the the people who supported the
[1:04:28] prophets ministry and then you know fell
[1:04:30] away monetarily and anyway let's go on
[1:04:35] her husband is her Lord God did y'all
[1:04:38] know that now I want you to put yourself
[1:04:42] in a woman's place if you can but just
[1:04:45] imagine that your husband was a wealthy
[1:04:47] man a kind man a rich man right and he's
[1:04:52] your husband is there anything that your
[1:04:55] husband would not give you especially if
[1:05:00] it's something you need it
[1:05:02] you understand me think about how you
[1:05:04] would handle your wives or whatever the
[1:05:06] case may be you know by God's grace you
[1:05:09] would give them whatever they want it
[1:05:11] see God is not just our Savior he's our
[1:05:15] husband is that Alright so don't ever
[1:05:20] let the devil think that God is not
[1:05:22] there to supply your needs the Bible
[1:05:25] tells us that he can give us exceedingly
[1:05:27] abundantly above whatsoever we ask or
[1:05:31] think this world is not the thing that
[1:05:34] is supposed to control you it is the
[1:05:37] Holy Ghost and they that are led by the
[1:05:40] spirit they are the sons of God
[1:05:42] hallelujah and God said if you ask
[1:05:45] anything in my name and believe that you
[1:05:47] shall receive it that's exactly what it
[1:05:49] means
[1:05:50] and used to say he can't give it to you
[1:05:57] fear not Isaiah 54 in 4:3 says fear not
[1:06:02] I got a hurry but thou should not be
[1:06:04] ashamed neither be thou confound
[1:06:06] for thou shalt be not be put to shame
[1:06:09] for thou shalt forget the shame of the
[1:06:12] youth and shalt not remember the
[1:06:14] reproach of that would have heard
[1:06:15] anymore for thy maker is dying husband
[1:06:21] the Lord of Hosts is his name and the
[1:06:25] Redeemer the Holy One of Israel the god
[1:06:29] of the whole earth shall he be called
[1:06:32] now you tell me the god of the whole
[1:06:34] earth paint with your mountains with the
[1:06:39] god of the whole earth
[1:06:41] amen fed millions under the ministry of
[1:06:44] Moses hallelujah people are you know
[1:06:54] something you gotta put you some time
[1:06:56] God put you to the test but the bride
[1:06:59] believes him the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:07:02] trusts God she trusts her husband
[1:07:06] because she know there is no failure in
[1:07:10] him
[1:07:11] and God has a reputation to uphold
[1:07:15] hallelujah God has a reputation to
[1:07:19] uphold
[1:07:21] he will never allow his reputation to be
[1:07:26] smeared no he ain't the same he is the
[1:07:30] same but the truth that the problem is
[1:07:33] whether we have the faith to believe
[1:07:35] that he is the same for the Lord have
[1:07:41] called me as a woman Forsaken and
[1:07:43] grieved in spirit and a life of youth
[1:07:47] and when thou wast refused said thy God
[1:07:50] for a small moment Heather forsaken thee
[1:07:53] but with great mercies when I gathered
[1:07:56] II in a little rap I hid my face from
[1:07:59] thee for a moment but with everlasting
[1:08:01] kindness when I have mercy on thee said
[1:08:04] the Lord thy Redeemer now I hope this is
[1:08:07] okay with you because my point is this
[1:08:09] you and I must realize they meant that
[1:08:12] God amen is our all in all he's my
[1:08:16] Savior he's my deliverer he's my friend
[1:08:18] he's my anchor
[1:08:20] he's my shelter he's my buckler he's my
[1:08:22] shield he's not all and all that's what
[1:08:26] he wants to be to every one of us I'm
[1:08:30] gonna tell you something do y'all
[1:08:32] realize we getting ready to face the
[1:08:33] squeeze this government is getting ready
[1:08:37] to turn and Christians you're going to
[1:08:41] have to prove yourself hallelujah
[1:08:45] think about the penalty think about the
[1:08:48] penalty that God is going to allow you
[1:08:50] to go through let me member this way let
[1:08:54] me put this way to make myself plainer
[1:08:55] or clearer it this Bible here claim came
[1:09:02] by bloodshed people lost their lives
[1:09:06] putting this together literally lost
[1:09:11] their lives I can't remember who told me
[1:09:14] this but somebody said that
[1:09:15] statistically they said about two

[1:13:09] a church we're saying we want to many
[1:13:12] more this year members that's alright
[1:13:14] but the voice that I'm trying to say to
[1:13:17] you this morning is like the written the
[1:13:20] writer of this epistle we believe to be
[1:13:23] Paul which is saying looking for the
[1:13:26] coming of Jesus Christ the second time
[1:13:28] looking for him in order to do it
[1:13:32] you've got to see something before you
[1:13:34] can tell somebody else to look at what
[1:13:37] you're seeing huh if you're looking for
[1:13:40] the color you got to see something you
[1:13:44] can't tell something I'm looking for the
[1:13:45] coming of the Lord and you ain't seeing
[1:13:47] nothing
[1:13:47] no the Bible has already instructed us
[1:13:51] what to look for we're living in those
[1:13:54] conditions right now the world is
[1:13:57] falling apart the judgment of the Lord
[1:14:00] is everywhere and that tells me I need
[1:14:03] to look hallelujah and when you're
[1:14:08] looking and meant about said he will
[1:14:10] appear to them that are looking if
[1:14:12] you're not looking you'll miss him but
[1:14:15] if you look at me oh it's not yet it is
[1:14:17] this is the season we may not know the
[1:14:21] day nor the hour but this is the season
[1:14:24] this is the time ooh y'all pulling
[1:14:33] tonight
[1:14:33] I like this amen jeremiah 31:3 through
[1:14:39] for the lord appeared of all unto me

[1:14:47] everlasting love therefore with loving
[1:14:50] kindness have

[1:15:05] Satan tried to kill me before I got
[1:15:08] saved oh I can tell you some things
[1:15:12] that'll make you curl up your toes but
[1:15:14] I'm going to tell you something
[1:15:15] God was in it all what about that Jerry
[1:15:26] he's got a powerful testimony recently
[1:15:29] but you know what when God is in in it
[1:15:32] the devil he gets mad because the devil
[1:15:37] want to destroy you he knows that God
[1:15:40] will be incomplete without you oh we
[1:15:47] need God and God needs you she made it
[1:15:50] that way
[1:15:52] he bind himself with his own word he
[1:15:57] made it that way Adam could not survive
[1:16:01] without Eve there was no multiplied
[1:16:04] without any you being the bride the
[1:16:07] church there's no multiplying without
[1:16:09] you he needed us God is a spirit
[1:16:14] no man has seen him at any time but the
[1:16:17] son has declared him see but God needs
[1:16:22] you you're part of the family you ought
[1:16:27] to be so thankful hallelujah with loving
[1:16:33] kindness ever drawn thee and I love it I
[1:16:36] love it I so laughs that all of us are
[1:16:39] different every one of us you may ought
[1:16:43] we all may all have the Holy Ghost and
[1:16:45] we get so different you don't try to be
[1:16:47] like me and I'm not gonna try to be like
[1:16:48] you because I wasn't made to be like you
[1:16:51] I was made to be me and God loves to
[1:16:55] express himself through me and he loves
[1:16:57] to express himself through you I love it
[1:17:02] that way so
[1:17:04] because because of that we don't we
[1:17:05] don't we don't have space to compare
[1:17:07] ourselves with one another
[1:17:09] oh I wish I was like that one I wish I
[1:17:12] was like no cuz you don't know what he's
[1:17:16] got to go through to be that way right
[1:17:24] everybody trials are different and what
[1:17:27] we all go through we have to go through
[1:17:30] it but you got to believe that whatever
[1:17:33] it is God is gonna bring you through huh
[1:17:38] I'm so glad I don't have some of y'all
[1:17:40] trials but you better be glad you don't
[1:17:43] have mine either
[1:17:44] cuz I don't think you gonna handle mine
[1:17:46] like I think I know I can't have a yard
[1:17:48] you understand me
[1:17:50] every one of our trials have been what's
[1:17:55] that word um personalized that ain't the
[1:17:58] word I want but it is it's especially
[1:18:02] designed for you yeah you know I must
[1:18:09] realize they meant this food we're
[1:18:10] eating the message that we're eating
[1:18:14] what what is supposed to do bring forth
[1:18:17] transformation how many of y'all when
[1:18:21] you eating after food can see yourself
[1:18:25] getting fat you don't know it until
[1:18:29] someone say boy I remember when I was
[1:18:36] young and I I you know used to fast and
[1:18:38] free a lot of time at one time like one
[1:18:40] season I started gaining weight old
[1:18:42] friend came to my job and she saw me
[1:18:45] she's a war there's more of you what can
[1:18:53] I say you know because a lot of time you
[1:18:57] can't see it just like you can't see
[1:18:59] yourself growing how many y'all see
[1:19:03] yourself growing come on you know all
[1:19:06] you know is your mama would take you say
[1:19:07] boy you grow in your pants you're
[1:19:09] growing out your pants you know we
[1:19:11] should call them ankle whippers you know
[1:19:13] your plans get shot overnight you know
[1:19:16] but you didn't see
[1:19:18] but you grew why because you were still
[1:19:21] eating you still living and your body
[1:19:25] processed it and made it happen you
[1:19:28] understand me
[1:19:29] that's how it is in the spirit you may
[1:19:31] not see it but you keep eating it you
[1:19:34] get stronger you get bigger you
[1:19:37] understand me you have more confidence
[1:19:39] right why because this is God in one
[1:19:45] phone and if you keep eating this you
[1:19:48] will become like God like they say you
[1:19:51] are what you eat and the bride must be
[1:19:56] born of his bone and flesh of his flesh
[1:20:00] coming in yo oh you know what I'm saying
[1:20:03] none of us can say oh I've made it no
[1:20:06] we're all growing we're all losing we're
[1:20:10] all maturing and the Lord you'll ensure
[1:20:14] the more you have compassion on those
[1:20:17] who are less mature than you did I say
[1:20:23] that right that haven't grown that
[1:20:26] hasn't grown as much as you've had
[1:20:27] because you come that way you know it's
[1:20:31] like you're your brother running in
[1:20:32] bumpy falls and skinned his knee and you
[1:20:35] pick him up the arm and oh hey I know
[1:20:37] what that feels like I've been there and
[1:20:39] you know what you do you rub your little
[1:20:42] brother's knee and we are done man
[1:20:44] I have well as well sister but but
[1:20:50] nevertheless amen
[1:20:52] we what we know the pain we understand
[1:20:55] the growth we understand each other
[1:20:58] because we've been there don't forget
[1:20:59] where you come from when you forget what
[1:21:02] you come from
[1:21:03] you're gonna lose your compassion for
[1:21:04] others you become self-righteous when
[1:21:07] you forget where you come from
[1:21:09] hallelujah few more minutes few more
[1:21:12] almost 8:30 the thing I love about it I
[1:21:16] can't put everything into this message
[1:21:18] but this book this Bible is our mirror
[1:21:21] it is the thing that listen sometimes
[1:21:23] you don't even know you have issues
[1:21:26] until you read this Bible then when you
[1:21:29] read this Bible the light
[1:21:31] shine it would quicken and cause
[1:21:33] conviction that conviction would bring
[1:21:36] you to repentance hallelujah and
[1:21:38] repenters will bring you to
[1:21:40] sanctification he said i'm saying it
[1:21:44] that's the way it works but if you don't
[1:21:46] never read this you're not gonna be
[1:21:48] convicted this is your this is where you
[1:21:55] take your bath washed in the water of
[1:21:59] the word like I'm almost done with this
[1:22:07] portion she can never be forgotten don't
[1:22:12] think the dad ever says well God don't
[1:22:16] love you in I know you've been crying
[1:22:18] out for that holy goes for a long time
[1:22:20] but you ain't gonna get it now he just
[1:22:22] told you you gonna get it when he said
[1:22:27] you can't that means you can cuz he's
[1:22:30] blocking you his ways are always
[1:22:33] negative they're there to block you from
[1:22:35] your victory hmm what if the devil would
[1:22:41] have told Sam oh you just picking up
[1:22:43] that drive on a job born of an ass you
[1:22:46] think you're gonna whip them fellas down
[1:22:47] with this it's scientifically it would
[1:22:53] have been ridiculous just to think that
[1:22:56] he could where were 3,000 men he whipped
[1:22:59] them with a bone power him up wit for
[1:23:04] the mixed power
[1:23:05] read your Bible and and that's the way
[1:23:09] it is with God what's in your hand they
[1:23:12] say little David Oh David had was a
[1:23:15] slingshot and a stone and he killed a
[1:23:19] giant if you catch this revelation Jesus
[1:23:23] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:23:25] forever
[1:23:26] that's my little stone and every time
[1:23:29] the devil comes I will that stone at him
[1:23:33] and is guaranteed you come out the
[1:23:41] winner every time
[1:23:42] David proved the stone works and faith
[1:23:47] in God who slew listen I tell people I
[1:23:49] said if David would've did a somersault
[1:23:51] Amen and just God would direct that
[1:23:55] stone because the giant had to die and
[1:24:00] Israel had to be victorious and it was
[1:24:03] all about God being glorified we don't
[1:24:09] believe that all things work together
[1:24:11] for the good of them that love God how
[1:24:14] many y'all really believe that I believe
[1:24:16] that it works together you have to wait
[1:24:20] some time to figure it out sometime you
[1:24:22] don't figured out but trust God Oh help
[1:24:25] me Lord I'm trying today
[1:24:26] listen says can a woman forget her
[1:24:29] suckling child that she should not have
[1:24:31] compassion on the son of her womb yay
[1:24:34] they may forget yet will I not forget be
[1:24:38] behold I have engraven thee upon the
[1:24:43] palms of my hand
[1:24:44] thy walls are continually before me God
[1:24:48] said I can't forget you you might forget
[1:24:51] me but I'll never forget you ooh
[1:24:55] hallelujah
[1:24:57] he cannot forget think about it we win
[1:25:00] the mind of God eons before time God
[1:25:04] still remembered you the plan was
[1:25:08] already set you were going to be born
[1:25:10] this time of year and never die nothing
[1:25:13] could have stopped it hallelujah and
[1:25:16] guess what he knew what he was going to
[1:25:18] have you doing this day about a toast
[1:25:26] Sam you made what 10 years ago or how
[1:25:28] many many years ago before y'all got
[1:25:30] here you're gonna be in America and I
[1:25:32] would be preaching to you Yuda laughed
[1:25:37] your brother
[1:25:39] you're the love like ain't no way I know
[1:25:42] I wouldn't mind going but I can't see it
[1:25:44] I ain't it for you to see
[1:25:47] God had already determined it Oh God who
[1:25:53] the thought like I said I would have
[1:25:55] been an eye I hate cold weather nor
[1:25:59] forgive me but I know it's a part of God
[1:26:02] what I suffer lord have mercy
[1:26:06] but you know I thank God for - y'all go
[1:26:10] an and you know the older you get right
[1:26:12] brother it's different it's different
[1:26:15] ooh I remember being a little kid II I
[1:26:19] didn't I've got getting out there
[1:26:21] throwing snowballs and wrassling on can
[1:26:23] all that the snow now I'm like oh you
[1:26:26] know you're afraid to go outside you
[1:26:29] open the door whoo he's like somebody
[1:26:31] God has a sister you well he has a
[1:26:38] sense of humor let me hurry listen I
[1:26:43] won't you understand who you not
[1:26:45] understand this parable he is like it in
[1:26:48] many parables talking about the bride
[1:26:50] like like a husband and a wife he calls
[1:26:53] the church the bride and the bride is no
[1:26:55] longer see the bridegroom is no longer
[1:26:57] two people they are one she is flesh of
[1:27:01] his flesh and bone of his bone and then
[1:27:03] when a man and woman is called to be a
[1:27:05] mystical body of Christ by the Holy
[1:27:07] Spirit they become a full member of his
[1:27:10] body when they feel with the Holy Ghost
[1:27:12] that's right because God took that
[1:27:15] spirit out of Christ raised it up his
[1:27:18] body and placed it on his throne and the
[1:27:21] sent back the Holy Spirit to make up the
[1:27:25] mystical body of Christ this is what I
[1:27:28] love about it the same Holy Spirit that
[1:27:31] was in Christ is now in us Christ sits
[1:27:35] on the throne and here his Holy Spirit
[1:27:37] is down now so if the Holy Spirit was
[1:27:40] subject to God the Father if I could say
[1:27:43] like that if he was subject to that he
[1:27:46] said I'd do everything which pleases the
[1:27:51] father as a man that's why you see
[1:27:54] that's why he said that because if the
[1:27:56] Holy Spirit is in you you strive if I
[1:27:58] could say like that you you
[1:28:00] our striving in Christ is submitting to
[1:28:03] Christ we strive to submit and to humble
[1:28:07] ourselves to him in and everything just
[1:28:11] let me read one or two more scriptures
[1:28:13] and I'll let you go
[1:28:14] the Bible says according to proverbs 35
[1:28:18] is five in six it says every word of God
[1:28:20] is pure he is a shield unto them that
[1:28:25] put their trust in here if you take a
[1:28:31] word on Scripture and you hold it before
[1:28:33] you like this when the devil coming at
[1:28:35] you that word becomes a shield it will
[1:28:39] protect you every time hallelujah oh
[1:28:43] come on somebody just the name of Jesus
[1:28:46] as a shield I've seen God almost stop
[1:28:50] the car on a dime because I said Jesus
[1:28:53] I'd like to say you know come up like
[1:28:55] that hey yeah and you know it is right
[1:28:58] then I don't you know you know we can't
[1:29:00] see it but I believe that host of Ages
[1:29:03] right stops that car 1 or 2 it doesn't
[1:29:07] make it may be different but I'm saying
[1:29:08] God and the invisible always working on
[1:29:11] our behalf did you know that the Bible
[1:29:13] said we are encamped about with so great
[1:29:16] a cloud of witnesses that mean they
[1:29:18] ain't cap compus us the Bible said God
[1:29:21] has already put a wall of fire about us
[1:29:23] we don't even see it but it's there and
[1:29:26] sometimes people feel it and it makes
[1:29:29] them feel uncomfortable
[1:29:30] but when that wall is there and they
[1:29:33] started acting strange you say thank you
[1:29:35] Jesus add thou not unto his words lest
[1:29:40] he reprove thee and thou be found a liar
[1:29:44] you don't have to add nothin to it
[1:29:47] it's good the way it is mmm blessed be
[1:29:50] the Lord Psalms 28 and 7 because he have
[1:29:54] heard the voice of my supplication the
[1:29:57] Lord is my strength and my shield my
[1:30:00] heart trusted in him see what I'm saying
[1:30:02] trust in the Lord with all thine heart
[1:30:05] and lean not to your own understanding
[1:30:09] acknowledge the Lord in all your ways
[1:30:12] and he shall direct your
[1:30:14] let me say like this if you think you're
[1:30:17] gonna walk this Christian walk without
[1:30:19] enemies you are deceived hello
[1:30:23] you will help enemies you're gonna have
[1:30:26] problems but guess what you have no
[1:30:30] rights because you got to love your
[1:30:33] enemy you can't treat your enemy the way
[1:30:39] they treat you you got to love your
[1:30:41] enemies that's the only ones getting in
[1:30:44] heaven guru Judas was Jesus enemy right
[1:30:53] and Judas called his enemy friend Jesus
[1:30:58] called his enemy friend and let Judas
[1:30:59] kissing do you know what sure that would
[1:31:03] have been a fighting thing for some of
[1:31:04] us y'all go where you going even knows
[1:31:14] the truth but God forgive us he knows
[1:31:19] we're growing he knows we're young you

[1:31:29] is my strength and shield my heart
[1:31:30] trusted in him and I am helped therefore
[1:31:34] my heart greatly resources and with my
[1:31:37] song will I praise Him the last one
[1:31:40] commit thy ways Psalms 3075 commit thy
[1:31:45] way unto the Lord Trust also in him and
[1:31:49] he shall bring it to pass
[1:31:51] I feel pretty good now that'll mean egg
[1:31:59] but I can't help it I'm a child in his
[1:32:02] eyes and when you and I committed it
[1:32:06] takes away the worry it takes away the
