[50:09] i trust everybody is feeling that pull
[50:15] my brother sang the song i'm going up
[50:18] yonder
[50:21] and he kind of mentioned some things
[50:23] about being changed
[50:25] will be changed from mortal immortality
[50:29] hallelujah as we stand
[50:33] let us turn to hebrews the first chapter
[50:37] i appreciate the lord jesus christ
[50:40] it's quite a shame you know we my wife
[50:43] and i
[50:45] passed an assembly of god church
[50:49] and the parking lot was full
[50:54] what a shame that when we come to a
[50:58] place that we say we believe is truth
[51:04] yet the people are so lazy
[51:08] if i could say it like that dilatory
[51:12] however you want to say it they just
[51:17] don't show up but for those of you who
[51:19] do
[51:21] uh god has a reward for you
[51:25] you are the word and the bible says
[51:28] the bible says that's jesus christ what
[51:30] is the will of god
[51:32] even the prophet god said a true
[51:34] born-again believer can't hardly wait
[51:36] till the doors are open
[51:38] and uh my wife and i when we were
[51:40] looking at that
[51:42] i don't know what time church started
[51:44] but they were there
[51:48] and uh it was such a rebuke
[51:51] as far as i was concerned because we say
[51:56] we know him hebrews 1
[51:59] and like i said how do you love
[52:02] someone you do not know
[52:07] just the other service we were talking
[52:08] about that and
[52:10] we're still talking about seasonal
[52:12] change
[52:15] this is a time where things are changing
[52:17] whether you like it or not
[52:18] it's happening
[52:21] and one thing i know for certain that
[52:23] god can't change his mind
[52:26] i wish i could zip it up how could i say
[52:30] it i wish i could just speed things up
[52:32] in my life
[52:34] to that perfection
[52:38] but every change is important everything
[52:40] we go through
[52:42] every storm no matter what it is
[52:45] it's important for our growth we don't
[52:48] have to understand it
[52:49] but we must trust god
[52:52] if you trust him it'll bring a great
[52:56] peace to your heart
[52:57] and your mind because you know that
[53:00] everything he does and everything that
[53:01] he's going to do is for your good
[53:05] think about the people that has that
[53:07] that have made it to heaven
[53:11] how shameful they would be what they are
[53:13] when they realized that
[53:15] what they were going through god was in
[53:16] it
[53:19] and how often they thought god wasn't
[53:21] there
[53:22] when he was the one carrying them
[53:26] he said he'll never leave us nor will he
[53:28] forsake us
[53:29] and that's exactly what he means hebrews
[53:33] 1
[53:34] glad to see those of you who are here
[53:37] we're just happy and
[53:38] like i said i'm not here to to uh
[53:44] bring anyone to shame i i just know that
[53:48] as a pastor we see things that
[53:53] the parishioners or the saints of god
[53:55] don't see this is why we call a shepherd
[53:58] we see dangers that you don't see and
[54:01] that's why we understand and understand
[54:03] the importance of coming to church
[54:06] and i'm talking mainly to the people if
[54:08] they are listening online
[54:11] not those of you who are here but the
[54:12] ones who are online those who
[54:14] rather stay home and look at it from a
[54:17] distance
[54:19] but god knows you sitting there and he
[54:21] can address your situation
[54:24] even from here because you're just a
[54:26] dimensional way
[54:28] hebrews 1 10 through 12
[54:33] and thou lord in the beginning has laid
[54:36] the foundation of the earth
[54:39] and the heavens are the works of thine
[54:41] hands
[54:43] they shall perish but thou remainest
[54:47] and they all shall wax old as doth
[54:51] a garment and as a vesture shall thou
[54:55] fold them
[54:55] up and they shall be changed
[54:59] but thou art the same
[55:03] and thy years shall never fail
[55:07] i love that isaiah 40
[55:11] and 8.
[55:22] trusting you there isaiah 40
[55:26] and 8 the grass
[55:30] withereth the flower
[55:33] fadeth but the word
[55:37] of the lord shall stand
[55:43] forever
[55:46] in the latter part of that scripture it
[55:48] also says
[55:49] surely the people is grass
[55:53] so we know what's going to fade away and
[55:55] what's going to fold up what's going to
[55:57] wrinkle up if you want to put it that
[55:58] way
[55:58] however you want to put it you're going
[56:02] to change
[56:03] whether you like it or not let us pray
[56:07] heavenly father god we come before you
[56:09] lord and we thank you for
[56:10] your amazing grace i thank you for how
[56:13] you direct us
[56:15] and your leadership lord and our
[56:18] leadership is not of men but it's of
[56:20] your holy spirit
[56:22] and we appreciate everything that you do
[56:24] for us lord
[56:25] even in our greatest efforts we do make
[56:28] mistakes
[56:29] but lord we are so confident in your
[56:32] sacrifice
[56:34] in your blood in your in in your victory
[56:39] that we can rest within you knowing that
[56:42] you have accomplished everything
[56:44] that we need to accomplish and that our

[56:53] grace

[57:01] in their hearts
[57:02] that when we leave this service tonight
[57:05] we would feel that desire to want more
[57:08] of you
[57:10] lord grant it father because you told us
[57:12] lord and you have said in your word
[57:14] that if we'll seek you early we will
[57:16] find you
[57:18] bless each and every heart we ask these
[57:21] things in your lovely name jesus christ
[57:24] amen you may be seated
[57:31] i like to entitle the message season
[57:34] the season of change and this is part
[57:37] two
[57:38] we preach the other part on sunday for
[57:41] part one
[57:44] and i want to start with the thought
[57:46] that everything changes but
[57:49] the word of the lord
[57:52] change in itself can be something that
[57:55] is seasonal
[57:59] it could also be something that is
[58:00] permanent
[58:02] the things that god changes
[58:05] with the intent of it remaining that way
[58:08] is a change that is permanent
[58:12] change comes sometimes silently
[58:15] sometimes change comes lasting you know
[58:19] with lasting it with time
[58:23] sometime it comes abruptly you know
[58:26] uh you know like a peaceful day turning
[58:28] into a stormy day
[58:30] a tornado or a hurricane something that
[58:32] comes and it abruptly brings a change
[58:35] and
[58:35] once it's done the change is apparent
[58:38] you can see it with your own eyes
[58:40] what the change did make change is
[58:43] something also
[58:44] that something that you and i have
[58:46] really no control of it
[58:48] of it's something that god ordains he he
[58:51] has already
[58:52] uh sat in his heart in his mind what he
[58:55] it purpose to do with each and every one
[58:57] of us
[58:59] sometimes like i said it comes in a way
[59:02] of
[59:03] permanent like for example how
[59:06] cain and abel was very peaceful they had
[59:09] a wonderful
[59:10] no doubt relationship until the time of
[59:12] offering
[59:14] when they began to sacrifice and it was
[59:15] church time and then
[59:17] not even knowing something was working
[59:20] and they didn't even know it and that's
[59:21] the thing
[59:22] change happens things work
[59:25] to bring change and sometimes you don't
[59:27] even see it until the change has come
[59:31] because i'm sure that uh cain did not
[59:33] see
[59:34] that his brother they were going to
[59:37] argue
[59:38] and his brother kane was going to slay
[59:41] him
[59:42] understand change was made and that
[59:45] change was permanent it was something
[59:47] in this dimension that could not be
[59:50] changed until god
[59:52] would do something about it i know i'm
[59:54] using the word change as part of the
[59:56] definition but nevertheless you
[59:57] understand what i'm trying to tell you
[1:00:00] we look at this thing and we we see that
[1:00:03] you know in us god is the only one that
[1:00:06] can bring a change
[1:00:08] the bible says no man can add one cubit
[1:00:11] to a statue
[1:00:13] oh how we wish that once we
[1:00:16] when we first got saved we would have
[1:00:18] just snapped into
[1:00:19] into perfection and you know take a
[1:00:21] rapture uh is our greatest hope but
[1:00:24] that kind of a thing you know it takes
[1:00:28] a process and every process brings about
[1:00:31] change
[1:00:33] i i'm talking about change because you
[1:00:34] remember when years ago
[1:00:36] the president of old was saying change
[1:00:39] change
[1:00:39] we didn't realize what kind of change we
[1:00:41] were going to see but now we see
[1:00:43] the change and a lot of us don't like
[1:00:45] the change
[1:00:47] some may like it but i don't
[1:00:51] i'm just being honest and when we come
[1:00:55] to
[1:00:55] see that change involves movement
[1:01:00] you know like right now i'm standing
[1:01:02] here but if i move i've just
[1:01:04] changed my position i might remain the
[1:01:07] same person
[1:01:09] but i'm not in the same place i used to
[1:01:11] be
[1:01:12] but in this case we want to change from
[1:01:16] one place to another
[1:01:18] but we also want to change with the
[1:01:21] change
[1:01:22] like the bible says from glory to glory
[1:01:26] right and so we we must understand by
[1:01:29] god's grace
[1:01:30] there is only one thing that doesn't
[1:01:32] change and that's god in his word
[1:01:34] and they're not two entities they are
[1:01:35] the same
[1:01:37] he is the word and the bible says he
[1:01:40] cannot lie
[1:01:43] right we've seen god move throughout
[1:01:46] history
[1:01:47] moving from justification to
[1:01:49] sanctification
[1:01:50] to the baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:01:53] even when the baptism of holy ghost came
[1:01:55] in 190
[1:01:56] 1906 in isuzu time everybody thought oh
[1:01:59] my this is the ultimate
[1:02:02] cannot be any more changes and god says
[1:02:05] this
[1:02:06] is just the beginning baptism of the
[1:02:08] holy ghost is that you're just now being
[1:02:11] born
[1:02:12] into the spiritual atmosphere or
[1:02:14] dimension
[1:02:15] that we talk about but you're not done
[1:02:18] yet
[1:02:19] there is another change coming and you
[1:02:22] see the church
[1:02:22] at large did not understand that that
[1:02:25] change was coming
[1:02:27] they the pentecostal church thought they
[1:02:28] were the ultimate
[1:02:30] and then when god began to move by way
[1:02:32] of uh malachi
[1:02:34] uh uh you know four coming in and
[1:02:37] showing us that we
[1:02:38] we there's another change coming
[1:02:41] and um they couldn't understand the
[1:02:44] change you know how that is
[1:02:45] most people don't like change most
[1:02:48] people like their comfort zones
[1:02:52] and you know what god is god change
[1:02:55] things and god will bring you out of
[1:02:57] your comfort zone
[1:02:59] just to make you who you are let's just
[1:03:02] throw this out for an example
[1:03:04] there were no group of people that was
[1:03:05] as starchy as the jews
[1:03:08] and when god brought the change from law
[1:03:10] to grace they were jumping out of
[1:03:12] windows and running up the streets
[1:03:13] saying he's alive he's alive
[1:03:16] well if people had seen them the moment
[1:03:19] or
[1:03:20] a day or two before this change happened
[1:03:23] they would have not
[1:03:24] they wouldn't have not noticed that
[1:03:26] these people were the same people that
[1:03:27] were
[1:03:28] saddened
[1:03:31] but now they are full of joy and that's
[1:03:33] what joy does it changes the disposition
[1:03:36] you know some changes are not healthy
[1:03:38] for you even in the natural
[1:03:40] we're not supposed to worry we're not we
[1:03:42] weren't built to be to worry we weren't
[1:03:44] built to fret we were
[1:03:46] we weren't built to be fear those things
[1:03:48] bring tumors and blood pressure and
[1:03:50] diabetes and all of these diseases that
[1:03:53] attaches themselves to us
[1:03:54] because we we allow ourselves to take a
[1:03:57] negative
[1:03:58] change hallelujah
[1:04:01] i'm looking for a change i hope
[1:04:03] everybody else is looking for a change
[1:04:05] i'm looking for a change like our
[1:04:06] brother samuel says i'm going up yonder
[1:04:09] now yonder might not be but so high but
[1:04:11] i'm going there
[1:04:15] surely people is as grass and that's the
[1:04:17] thing that that word struck me when i
[1:04:19] was studying
[1:04:20] sure the people are as grass you know
[1:04:23] how
[1:04:25] we walk on grass
[1:04:29] and basically that's what god is saying
[1:04:31] you are insignificant
[1:04:33] until a change comes
[1:04:37] and he's the only one that can change
[1:04:39] you
[1:04:42] he's the only one that can take a dust
[1:04:44] of sand
[1:04:46] and make it a star
[1:04:50] he can change you and god is not looking
[1:04:53] for
[1:04:54] some passion of job like brother branham
[1:04:55] said god is not right now we're talking
[1:04:58] about our total change
[1:05:00] a new creature i don't know about you
[1:05:04] but i thirst for that
[1:05:05] to be completely new with all things
[1:05:09] far be far far behind me
[1:05:13] hallelujah and you know as i know even
[1:05:16] as you mature as a christian satan tried
[1:05:18] to bring up some of the past
[1:05:20] and he'll never get to you until you
[1:05:23] accept
[1:05:25] his thoughts and ideas about you
[1:05:28] and the first thing he tells you is that
[1:05:30] you haven't changed
[1:05:33] but see when you have come you come and
[1:05:36] you
[1:05:36] know god you know him for yourself see
[1:05:40] jesus christ himself is a revelation the
[1:05:43] holy ghost is a revelation
[1:05:45] it doesn't matter how people say oh i
[1:05:46] got it but you see their action
[1:05:48] shows whether they really believe that
[1:05:50] they have it or whether they have it or
[1:05:52] not
[1:05:53] because when the holy ghost comes in you
[1:05:55] there is a change
[1:05:57] there the change is so drastic that
[1:06:00] others will realize that they know it
[1:06:02] because you have changed from death unto
[1:06:05] life
[1:06:06] you can't be dead and say i've changed
[1:06:09] no life is something that is
[1:06:12] seen noticed
[1:06:17] realized malachi
[1:06:20] 3 and 6 says for i am the lord
[1:06:24] i change not
[1:06:28] aren't you glad about that i'm so glad
[1:06:31] god is not
[1:06:32] bipolar you know i'm so glad he's not
[1:06:35] double-minded
[1:06:36] i'm so glad that god don't change on me
[1:06:39] you know when i repent i expect his
[1:06:42] forgiveness
[1:06:44] is that right because he said if you
[1:06:46] repent from your sins he will forgive
[1:06:48] you
[1:06:50] there's no ifs but it's about it if you
[1:06:52] are sorry that you've done wrong
[1:06:54] he's there to forgive you and i could
[1:06:56] walk up amen i could walk
[1:06:58] clean like i tell people i might go
[1:07:01] through my changes through the day
[1:07:04] but at night when i go to sleep
[1:07:07] i'm sanctified
[1:07:12] and i stay that way so when i wake up in
[1:07:14] the morning i wake up sanctified
[1:07:16] now the devil might be on my in my ear
[1:07:19] have y'all noticed that sometimes
[1:07:20] you wake up and the devil got this crazy
[1:07:22] song in your ear
[1:07:23] you're like where is coming now you got
[1:07:25] a battle with that song with a christian
[1:07:26] song of some sort
[1:07:28] or a word let's move on i think what we
[1:07:31] need to do is learn how to accept our
[1:07:33] change
[1:07:34] most christians say well i believe the
[1:07:36] word yeah
[1:07:38] well actions are always speaks louder
[1:07:42] yeah you can say whatever you want to
[1:07:43] say but whatever your actions are it
[1:07:46] tells who and what you
[1:07:47] are accepting that which
[1:07:50] has already been achieved y'all
[1:07:53] understand what i mean
[1:07:55] we're not the achiever per se
[1:07:59] he is the achiever
[1:08:03] and when you begin to accept you who you
[1:08:06] are
[1:08:06] you recognize i'm looking for change
[1:08:10] as that brother keep brought to my
[1:08:12] attention which is wonderful
[1:08:13] it was a thought i had been preaching on
[1:08:16] change and then he said this thing
[1:08:18] sean you are the change and i thought
[1:08:21] that's right
[1:08:23] now oh come on
[1:08:26] i came in this dimension in this age
[1:08:31] to bring the change
[1:08:35] hello so did you
[1:08:38] don't look for somebody else to bring
[1:08:40] the change you
[1:08:41] are the change
[1:08:46] all we need is the anointing amen
[1:08:49] we need the anointing of the holy ghost
[1:08:52] so that the change can be permanent
[1:08:58] hallelujah we don't have to figure it
[1:09:00] out
[1:09:02] the true seed of god will not in a place
[1:09:05] to try to figure
[1:09:06] out how the change is going to come i
[1:09:08] wish i could find a scientist
[1:09:10] that can tell me how i'm going to change
[1:09:13] from mortal
[1:09:14] to immortality i wish i had somebody who
[1:09:17] could tell me
[1:09:18] how jesus turned the water into wine
[1:09:21] you know what i'm saying i wish there
[1:09:23] was somebody here
[1:09:25] that can tell me how he took a dead man
[1:09:27] by the name of lazarus that was dead
[1:09:30] four days and made his fake and man knew
[1:09:35] he probably had baby skin
[1:09:40] but we've got to learn
[1:09:44] that we're we're gideon was the same
[1:09:46] we're like gideon did you know that
[1:09:49] even though we don't know him per se
[1:09:51] gideon was a type of you
[1:09:54] didn't say lord i've been a christian
[1:09:56] all these years
[1:09:58] and all i could see is that the devil
[1:09:59] comes and he's tearing my house up
[1:10:02] he's stealing everything that you bless
[1:10:03] me with he's taking it from me
[1:10:07] if there be god
[1:10:10] and if you still with israel if you
[1:10:12] still with the bride where
[1:10:14] be the miracles now gideon is looking
[1:10:17] for a change from somewhere else
[1:10:20] and god says no no no you're the change
[1:10:25] i put those thoughts in your heart i put
[1:10:27] that desire in your mind
[1:10:29] i put that that that that yearning
[1:10:32] for miracles in you because you're the
[1:10:36] one i'm going to use
[1:10:38] you see that's why god put this in you
[1:10:40] if you have a yearning to witness
[1:10:42] you're the change if you had a yearning
[1:10:45] it meant to pray for somebody to be
[1:10:47] healed you're the young you're the
[1:10:50] change
[1:10:52] all those things that god puts in you to
[1:10:54] make a thirst for
[1:10:55] we know that there is a law where the
[1:10:57] deep call to the deep
[1:10:58] there's one to respond but god is not
[1:11:02] looking for you to look around you the
[1:11:04] bride
[1:11:06] hallelujah listen to the scripture
[1:11:09] think about it people wanted to change
[1:11:13] so much
[1:11:14] to when john the baptist came they
[1:11:16] thought he was a monster they thought he
[1:11:17] was crazy
[1:11:19] but they wanted the messiah y'all
[1:11:22] understand me
[1:11:23] but god always hides himself in
[1:11:25] simplicity
[1:11:27] hallelujah god is right in our faces
[1:11:30] most of the time
[1:11:31] and you know his presence is so
[1:11:32] unrecognized
[1:11:34] we just move right through him all over
[1:11:36] him not now i'm not saying
[1:11:38] not i'm not pointing fingers but i'm
[1:11:39] saying as christians as a whole
[1:11:41] that's what we do and here was john the
[1:11:45] baptist
[1:11:47] here god was working with him and these
[1:11:49] people show that they weren't really
[1:11:51] into the word because if they were into
[1:11:54] the word
[1:11:54] they would have known john the baptist
[1:11:56] was not the messiah
[1:11:59] can you imagine for those who really
[1:12:01] thought he was the messiah
[1:12:04] how it must have been when he was thrown
[1:12:06] in jail
[1:12:08] and his head was cut off
[1:12:13] and john the baptist himself kind of got
[1:12:16] you know like an eagle you know
[1:12:18] eyes got a little blurred the trials and
[1:12:22] the tests were
[1:12:22] were were real and they were wicked
[1:12:26] come on somebody there's nothing worse
[1:12:29] than waiting in a jail cell
[1:12:31] knowing that your head is going to be
[1:12:32] taken off
[1:12:34] come on you don't think the devil is in
[1:12:36] there oh yes he's in your head trying to
[1:12:38] get in your head
[1:12:39] and john the baptist says hey tell me
[1:12:43] you go ask him is he the one or shall i
[1:12:45] look for another
[1:12:46] john is saying am i supposed to die yet
[1:12:52] right because john has already said at
[1:12:54] the baptism i must decrease and he must
[1:12:56] increase
[1:12:57] so john knew he was to go off the scene
[1:13:00] but he wanted
[1:13:01] comfort and then when the scripture came
[1:13:04] back
[1:13:04] and said that jesus was you know healing
[1:13:06] the sick and raising the dead and doing
[1:13:07] all those things
[1:13:08] that john knew the messiah was going to
[1:13:10] do
[1:13:12] he knew the change was of god
[1:13:17] huh this scripture
[1:13:21] ephesians 1 3-7 it says blessed be the
[1:13:25] god
[1:13:25] and father of our lord jesus christ who
[1:13:28] have blessed us with
[1:13:30] all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:13:32] places
[1:13:33] in christ and remember i told you last
[1:13:35] week you want spiritually
[1:13:37] spiritual blessings on earth
[1:13:41] you know it's you want god to give you
[1:13:44] all the spiritual stuff
[1:13:45] and yet you earthbound your connor is
[1:13:47] what i'm trying to say
[1:13:49] you got to go up higher remember and
[1:13:52] then the angel said unto john
[1:13:54] come on hither what i'm going to show
[1:13:56] you you won't get it down here
[1:13:59] you got to be in the spirit is that
[1:14:01] right and the bible said
[1:14:02] john was in the spirit on the lord's day
[1:14:06] you've got to be in the spirit to
[1:14:07] understand what this bible is talking
[1:14:09] about
[1:14:10] especially in this age the message that
[1:14:13] we've got
[1:14:14] we've been given is only spiritually
[1:14:16] seen and by revelation
[1:14:19] right you can read that book and you can
[1:14:21] listen those tapes all day
[1:14:22] and you'll still know nothing about what
[1:14:24] he's talking about
[1:14:27] i think it was i think brother troy and
[1:14:29] i was talking
[1:14:30] and you know it's lying upon the line
[1:14:32] and preached up about priesthood
[1:14:34] and you you know we're talking about you
[1:14:36] know you know
[1:14:37] in between yeah god don't mind you
[1:14:39] reading in between
[1:14:40] but you're in between going to end up
[1:14:42] back on the line
[1:14:45] it's got to come back to the word i
[1:14:47] don't care how you in between it
[1:14:49] it's still got to come back to that word
[1:14:52] because that word
[1:14:53] will never fail the way fade away it is
[1:14:56] what it is
[1:14:58] yes now listen what i'm saying listen to
[1:15:00] the word this is beautiful
[1:15:02] blessed be the god and father of our
[1:15:04] lord jesus christ
[1:15:06] who have blessed us with all spiritual
[1:15:09] blessings in heavenly places in
[1:15:12] christ christ mean anointing
[1:15:16] so if i'm going to get these blessings
[1:15:19] i've got to go
[1:15:20] in the anointing to get them
[1:15:25] it doesn't come by economy it comes by
[1:15:28] being
[1:15:29] in the spirit a consecrated
[1:15:32] life help us jesus
[1:15:35] listen as he has chosen
[1:15:39] us in him before the foundation of the
[1:15:42] world
[1:15:43] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:15:45] before him i
[1:15:47] believe that amen
[1:15:50] i don't care what kind of life i've
[1:15:52] lived in the past
[1:15:54] i have failed and i've come short so
[1:15:56] many times
[1:15:57] but this i believe
[1:16:01] he chose me
[1:16:05] i just want to fall back and say catch
[1:16:07] me angels
[1:16:09] he chose me
[1:16:13] he chose you
[1:16:16] because you was good no let me ask you a
[1:16:19] question
[1:16:21] if god chose you where were you when he
[1:16:23] chose you
[1:16:25] you were in him there was no other god
[1:16:28] he said there is no other god out there
[1:16:34] i didn't have no other choice but what i
[1:16:37] found in me
[1:16:39] [Laughter]
[1:16:41] somebody help me here so you see by
[1:16:44] god's grace how can you lose it
[1:16:47] like i said last week sunday
[1:16:50] when adam and eve says oh they have come
[1:16:53] to the place
[1:16:54] they know good from evil they have
[1:16:56] become gods
[1:16:58] before then they had no other will other
[1:17:01] than the will
[1:17:02] of god and they were children of god
[1:17:05] right but what they didn't understand
[1:17:09] was
[1:17:09] evil or let's put it this way
[1:17:12] they did not understand the thing was
[1:17:14] that serpent
[1:17:17] made them discover their will
[1:17:23] they had a will outside of what god you
[1:17:26] understand me
[1:17:27] he made them discover their will
[1:17:32] and when they discovered their will
[1:17:34] instead of staying with the will of god
[1:17:37] they moved on because you got to realize
[1:17:40] that the whole
[1:17:41] subject read between the lines was about
[1:17:43] multiplying
[1:17:46] that's what god told adam and eve we
[1:17:48] multiply
[1:17:49] and we pleased the earth then god sent a
[1:17:51] prophet in this day and told us
[1:17:53] that it would be given to adam and eve
[1:17:56] what time
[1:17:57] to do this but the serpent says listen
[1:18:01] there's a knowledge you don't know about
[1:18:03] and you can have these kids as whenever
[1:18:05] you want to
[1:18:08] your will y'all understand me that's why
[1:18:11] that's why i try to tell people
[1:18:12] you can't give nobody to the holy ghost
[1:18:15] it's god's will whenever they get it
[1:18:18] you can cry and scream all night long
[1:18:21] but until god
[1:18:22] accept you until god says now is the
[1:18:25] time
[1:18:26] right oh you think about it
[1:18:30] you know god told abraham you're going
[1:18:31] to have a son your name his name is
[1:18:33] going to be isaac and i'm going to tell
[1:18:34] you when it's going to happen
[1:18:35] now he gave them the promise how long
[1:18:37] ago 25 years before it ever happened
[1:18:39] how many of us would have waited on that
[1:18:41] but see that made abraham who he was
[1:18:45] a true seed of god he was willing and
[1:18:48] ready to wait
[1:18:50] i don't care how long it takes
[1:18:53] said so hallelujah you understand me
[1:18:58] so if you got a wife you got a son you
[1:19:00] got a daughter and i got plenty of
[1:19:01] children
[1:19:02] that god promised me that would be saved
[1:19:04] but guess what i'm gonna wait
[1:19:08] when his time is that's the win is going
[1:19:10] to happen
[1:19:11] i can shake him i can beg them i can
[1:19:14] plead with them but it will never happen
[1:19:16] until
[1:19:16] god's appointed time that's what
[1:19:19] anything
[1:19:22] i just feel like shouting john up here
[1:19:25] when you think about what god is doing
[1:19:28] we must learn that's that's what adam
[1:19:31] and eve did not do
[1:19:33] they didn't wait right
[1:19:36] it's just like when god told saul killed
[1:19:38] everything i went over this the other
[1:19:39] day
[1:19:39] kill everything everything that means
[1:19:42] the king the queen
[1:19:43] the beast the dog the cat whatever kill
[1:19:46] it all he thought he's going to save the
[1:19:51] best of it
[1:19:54] you can't you're going to flatter god
[1:19:57] you're going to tell god
[1:19:59] that what you this is what you asked me
[1:20:02] to do there's a better way
[1:20:04] there's no better way
[1:20:08] you know moses could say well lord why
[1:20:11] are you sending me
[1:20:12] through this sea you told me to bring
[1:20:14] the kids out see the children out see
[1:20:16] that's that's how it is
[1:20:18] you must learn to trust him with all
[1:20:19] your heart
[1:20:21] don't try to analyze what he's doing
[1:20:25] just trust him when you pray you pray
[1:20:28] with faith
[1:20:29] and faith says it's mine you don't have
[1:20:32] to see any signs you don't have to see
[1:20:34] any wonders faith says it's mine
[1:20:38] listen adam and eve didn't have any
[1:20:40] signs and wonders they just had the word
[1:20:42] and if we're going back to that we must
[1:20:44] learn how to trust
[1:20:46] the word 100 without a feeling
[1:20:50] or a sensation thank god if that comes
[1:20:53] but that does not mean god is in it
[1:20:59] sensations don't mean god is in it
[1:21:03] ah sensations oh sensations
[1:21:06] man yeah when i was in the world likes
[1:21:09] to dance on the floor and i used to
[1:21:10] always feel like a wind would just
[1:21:16] so i understand what sensations can do
[1:21:19] for you
[1:21:20] according as he has chosen us in him
[1:21:23] before the foundation of the lord
[1:21:24] so you learn how to wait that's what
[1:21:27] saul couldn't do
[1:21:29] saul didn't know how to wait
[1:21:32] and he went on and he you know that's
[1:21:34] how people do
[1:21:36] they always try to give you the answer
[1:21:39] when you already know it
[1:21:41] why do we do that when god has already
[1:21:43] told us what the answer is
[1:21:45] we try to find the answer out to
[1:21:47] somebody else like they're some kind of
[1:21:49] great psychiatrist or something when god
[1:21:52] is the word and you know what's right
[1:21:54] because as soon as you move wrong you
[1:21:56] feel it
[1:22:00] anyway let's move on have him
[1:22:02] predestinated us
[1:22:03] and what happened to saul he lost his
[1:22:05] position
[1:22:08] god dethroned him
[1:22:12] is that right what happens to the
[1:22:14] foolish virgin brother
[1:22:15] said they were made out of the same
[1:22:17] material but one didn't go any didn't go
[1:22:20] as far as it should have
[1:22:22] they had both the same word they had the
[1:22:25] ball both had the same opportunity
[1:22:28] oh yeah i know y'all think the foolish
[1:22:30] version out in the denomination that
[1:22:31] anywhere they are
[1:22:33] they they were called out come out of
[1:22:35] her people
[1:22:36] come out wherever they were they were
[1:22:39] all sleeping and slumbering and god said
[1:22:41] come out of there
[1:22:43] amen
[1:22:45] [Music]
[1:22:47] right now people don't even think the
[1:22:48] holy ghost is important and they can
[1:22:50] looking right at the coming of the lord
[1:22:53] look at the attacks of israel look what
[1:22:56] they did to our gas line they say it's
[1:22:57] back online now and we're going to have
[1:22:59] gas in seven days but you know what i
[1:23:01] thought to myself oh man these people
[1:23:03] are
[1:23:03] playing games
[1:23:07] oh what you think where is satan's eden
[1:23:13] who's ruling the world
[1:23:16] you better believe it so when the devil
[1:23:18] worshipers say
[1:23:19] that satan is a ruler it's true
[1:23:28] having predestinated a you know children
[1:23:30] of god you don't have to do wrong
[1:23:34] for devil worship to hate you despise
[1:23:37] you or dislike you
[1:23:38] sometimes people don't even know why
[1:23:39] they don't like you
[1:23:44] it's the spirit in them they don't mean
[1:23:46] no huh
[1:23:47] it is what they are who they are you
[1:23:50] ought to thank god you are who you are
[1:23:53] having predestinated us to the adoption
[1:23:55] of children not meant to be down this
[1:23:56] road
[1:23:56] by jesus christ to himself according to
[1:23:59] the good pleasure of his will
[1:24:03] like that old infidel that said to
[1:24:06] brother branham do you what
[1:24:08] god you think god exists and he and all
[1:24:11] those people through the
[1:24:12] dark ages mothers with their babies
[1:24:14] being ripped out of them and people
[1:24:16] being set on fire
[1:24:17] and thrown into the lions and he's
[1:24:18] sitting there enjoying it
[1:24:20] oh who gave god
[1:24:24] counsel
[1:24:28] you know i think about foolish people
[1:24:29] i'm saying that is a dumb devil
[1:24:34] i'm telling the spirit in the man now
[1:24:36] you know what i'm saying
[1:24:38] come on somebody i mean you can't even
[1:24:40] make yourself well when you get sick
[1:24:43] what kind of control do you have over
[1:24:45] your life but anyway let's go on
[1:24:47] you're going to judge god okay so we
[1:24:51] look at this thing and you see
[1:24:52] it it's his will it to the praise
[1:24:57] it's all about love you know
[1:25:01] we love him because he first love us
[1:25:04] amen this is about love
[1:25:08] divine love and you got a dying rock
[1:25:12] nothing lives until it dies and rot
[1:25:16] and that's where i met in my life lord
[1:25:18] whatever speck of dust dirt whatever
[1:25:20] darkness in me i want it out
[1:25:23] i want this perfection i see it i

[1:26:15] in you
[1:26:16] hallelujah glory to god
[1:26:20] talking about a change and we're being
[1:26:22] changed even when you don't know it

[1:26:27] have ever seen a baby grow
[1:26:31] no you haven't

[1:27:16] what i'm trying to tell you is that in
[1:27:18] the dna of jesus christ maturity is in

[1:27:24] blood is applied
[1:27:25] amen hallelujah brother brahma said it
[1:27:28] like this that god gives you and
[1:27:30] me a blood transfusion
[1:27:33] hallelujah and what's the blood of
[1:27:35] christ which is the spirit of the holy
[1:27:36] spirit whether it's the holy spirit in

[1:27:55] i see it are you ready you're complete
[1:27:58] i am in him but you know what i will not
[1:28:01] be satisfied until i see the blood
[1:28:04] change
[1:28:05] the blood that changes me you understand
[1:28:08] me the product of the change
[1:28:10] by the blood i won't see that
[1:28:14] product here like i said when that

[1:28:18] that word body comes to me it will be no
[1:28:20] great big change
[1:28:22] you know i want it to be so that i can
[1:28:24] just step right on in it
[1:28:26] yeah i believe that's it romans 2
[1:28:29] 7 says to them who by patient
[1:28:32] continuance in
[1:28:36] well-doing seek for glory and honor
[1:28:39] immortality
[1:28:40] what you're seeking it you want it
[1:28:44] you got to have it you see what i'm
[1:28:46] saying you're not resting on your couch
[1:28:48] and
[1:28:48] you know just being you know at ease and
[1:28:51] zion no
[1:28:52] you're saying you're looking you says i
[1:28:54] want that lord
[1:28:56] i want that glory i want that honor i
[1:28:58] want that immortality more i want that
[1:29:00] eternal life
[1:29:02] you promised me eternal life i want
[1:29:05] that at whatever cost
[1:29:09] at whatever cost
[1:29:16] we can't remain
[1:29:20] in the spirit of laodicea and expect to
[1:29:22] make a rapture
[1:29:27] rich increasingly good and have need of
[1:29:30] nothing
[1:29:31] and so many people around this message
[1:29:33] they just don't have need
[1:29:36] oh i like being when he said he said
[1:29:38] there's a difference between being
[1:29:39] blessed
[1:29:40] and have blessings oh
[1:29:43] i like that that'll never leave me
[1:29:46] you know because everybody's ble have
[1:29:48] blessings that's right
[1:29:50] just and the unjust have blessings but
[1:29:52] everybody ain't blessed
[1:29:59] yeah jacob was blessed
[1:30:03] esau had blessings
[1:30:07] he still got him he got all that all
[1:30:10] over there
[1:30:12] silver and gold have none but such as i
[1:30:14] have
[1:30:15] right i'd rather be as poor as dirt
[1:30:19] and have jesus on the inside than to be
[1:30:21] the wealthiest man in the world
[1:30:23] and that's what the devil makes you
[1:30:25] think you're not blessed because you're
[1:30:26] not
[1:30:27] you're not blessed because you ain't got
[1:30:28] all these riches and all these things
[1:30:30] let me tell you something when you die
[1:30:32] somebody gonna get it anyhow
[1:30:36] they carry nothing with you nothing
[1:30:39] and you have us worried about all of the
[1:30:41] stuff
[1:30:42] and you can't carry not one dime with
[1:30:44] you that was that amazes me
[1:30:46] how people pack all the jewelry and the
[1:30:48] rings and everything in the coffin
[1:30:50] i'm like what a waste of money
[1:30:57] yeah you said but you said what about
[1:30:59] those grave rivals you had those grave
[1:31:01] wobbles i mean i ain't gonna ever do
[1:31:02] that kind of thing but
[1:31:04] at least they know there's value in that
[1:31:05] coffin but they ain't going after your
[1:31:07] body
[1:31:08] they're going by what they're going for
[1:31:09] what you possess
[1:31:13] you say oh brother brooks that's an
[1:31:15] unnatural but in the spiritual don't you
[1:31:16] know that's what they have in churches
[1:31:19] grave robbers they rub all the dead
[1:31:22] bodies
[1:31:23] rob all the dead people spiritually of
[1:31:25] their money and their jewelry and their
[1:31:27] houses and their land
[1:31:29] grave robbers
[1:31:33] we're at a time now that we're at a
[1:31:36] place
[1:31:37] where change must come and i'm going to
[1:31:40] keep
[1:31:41] pushing until further now we've got to
[1:31:43] change
[1:31:44] we can't make the change ourselves but
[1:31:46] we do know who
[1:31:47] who changes i mean
[1:31:50] think about it he's god like i said he
[1:31:53] that come to god must believe that he is
[1:31:55] god
[1:31:56] and that he's rewarded them that
[1:31:57] diligently seek him
[1:31:59] they don't get mad with the devil the
[1:32:01] devil's doing what he's supposed to do
[1:32:03] we must do what we're supposed to do
[1:32:07] right in times of trouble he shall hide
[1:32:10] me
[1:32:12] let me tell you something everybody in
[1:32:14] here is dealing with something
[1:32:17] but i'm gonna tell you something if you
[1:32:18] if you're hidden in christ
[1:32:20] there's a peace that passes all
[1:32:22] understanding
[1:32:24] you can't even explain it sometimes i
[1:32:26] come in here and i'm not feeling good in
[1:32:28] my
[1:32:28] hallelujah i'm not feeling good in my
[1:32:31] flesh but on the inside
[1:32:35] don't touch that can't touch that
[1:32:40] said to me the other day you you're
[1:32:41] always happy and i'm like how do you
[1:32:43] know that
[1:32:44] i didn't know i didn't know it was being
[1:32:46] seen but on the inside i'm telling you
[1:32:48] in my heart i am by god's grace
[1:32:52] listen ecclesiastes three and six and
[1:32:55] i'll come to something else in just a
[1:32:56] minute
[1:32:57] a time to get and a time to lose
[1:33:00] a time to keep and a time to cast away
[1:33:04] a time to rin and a time to sow
[1:33:07] a time to keep silent and a time to
[1:33:11] speak and you know that's one of the one
[1:33:12] of the things that we can't understand
[1:33:14] when to keep silent there's sometimes
[1:33:17] you need to shut
[1:33:19] keep your mouth shut right if you got to
[1:33:22] hold it together hold it together
[1:33:24] if you got to run out the room run out
[1:33:26] the room
[1:33:27] but you must be able to discern when to
[1:33:31] keep
[1:33:31] the mouth shut man
[1:33:35] what right you understand what i'm
[1:33:38] saying
[1:33:38] because this is what gets us in trouble
[1:33:42] if eve had not talked to the serpent she
[1:33:44] would have never fallen
[1:33:47] what made her talk to him when god had
[1:33:50] already told her
[1:33:51] stay away from that from that you know
[1:33:54] don't even touch it
[1:33:56] so she was she was practicing social
[1:33:58] distance
[1:34:02] way back then
[1:34:05] how you doing you know what i'm saying
[1:34:06] let's move on
[1:34:08] but you can see how ridiculous these
[1:34:11] things are
[1:34:13] but she talked to him and he made reason
[1:34:15] let me tell you something
[1:34:16] if you talk to the devil that whispers
[1:34:18] in your mind he's going to deceive you
[1:34:21] you better you better stop him right off
[1:34:26] you know when he come to me i said wait
[1:34:27] a minute devil that's not even me
[1:34:29] i don't say no more i don't even have to
[1:34:32] say i rebuke you devil because i shut
[1:34:34] him out
[1:34:36] resist the devil
[1:34:39] amen a time to speak
[1:34:42] a time to love i'm telling you my wife
[1:34:45] will tell you she knows me better than
[1:34:47] any
[1:34:48] as soon as i know i say something wrong
[1:34:49] i'm saying forgive me
[1:34:51] yeah that's what i do
[1:34:54] you know and if i allow pride to hold me
[1:34:57] you don't have to worry about it pride
[1:34:59] never wins
[1:35:02] i'm going to always come back and say
[1:35:04] i'm sorry
[1:35:07] oh some of y'all need that lesson
[1:35:10] but you see what we don't we need to
[1:35:12] understand by god's grace is that
[1:35:15] when offenses come and i'm learning when
[1:35:18] offenses come if you do not
[1:35:20] correct it you are allowing the devil to
[1:35:23] have heyday
[1:35:25] he's going to enjoy beating up on your
[1:35:27] partner
[1:35:28] and beating up on youtube and the whole
[1:35:30] point behind it is all about pride
[1:35:34] we are can i say it failures to begin
[1:35:38] with
[1:35:40] within ourselves we are failures to
[1:35:42] begin anybody in here
[1:35:44] have walked a day without sin huh
[1:35:47] without making a mistake somebody help
[1:35:49] me here because i really want to know
[1:35:50] how you do it
[1:35:53] but we're constantly lord forgive me
[1:35:55] lord forgive me lord i didn't mean it
[1:35:56] lord help me
[1:35:57] i mean it's a it's a dead it's a this is
[1:35:59] how you stay
[1:36:00] under the blood god knows your heart
[1:36:03] that's why he gives you the holy ghost
[1:36:06] don't you know it's wonderful to be able
[1:36:08] to identify sin or whenever you're wrong
[1:36:11] there's so many people that don't even
[1:36:12] see that they have no knowledge they
[1:36:15] have no conscience of it
[1:36:19] look what brother bradham says in the
[1:36:21] end to me
[1:36:23] oh if the church could ever get to the
[1:36:26] place
[1:36:27] to where it could solemnly rest upon
[1:36:30] god's eternal word
[1:36:32] to be the truth think about it
[1:36:36] see that's the thing we're not resting
[1:36:40] we're not resting like we should but
[1:36:43] when you know the world you gotta you
[1:36:45] gotta
[1:36:45] stay there you know you can't start
[1:36:48] looking around like peter
[1:36:49] you know lord the tempest is you know
[1:36:52] that's when you begin to sink
[1:36:54] stay right there keep your eyes on the
[1:36:56] word say whatever you would say
[1:36:59] devil but the word says and i'm resting
[1:37:01] on the word what a difference
[1:37:07] huh you got to rest on it
[1:37:10] rest upon god's eternal word to be the
[1:37:12] truth
[1:37:13] what a difference there would be what a
[1:37:15] correcting there would be
[1:37:17] what a cutting away there would be what
[1:37:20] a joy
[1:37:20] there would be see until you rest that
[1:37:23] god's word
[1:37:24] is true there is no change
[1:37:27] he can't bring a change the bible says
[1:37:30] we are all have all come
[1:37:32] short of the glory of god oh
[1:37:36] none was worthy
[1:37:40] you see what i'm saying nobody paul
[1:37:43] peter james john
[1:37:44] there's only one not even william
[1:37:47] branham that was
[1:37:48] jesus christ the only one worthy
[1:37:51] to open the seals to loose the book um
[1:37:54] y'all understand what i'm saying you
[1:37:56] know pride is an evil thing
[1:37:58] it comes and you don't even know you
[1:38:00] have it
[1:38:02] but it's very destructive i've seen
[1:38:05] lives ruined because nobody wanted to
[1:38:07] submit
[1:38:09] hallelujah and what is that
[1:38:12] but a feeling pride never fed me
[1:38:16] pride never clothed me pride has never
[1:38:20] done nothing for me but to make me fall
[1:38:24] and ashamed um
[1:38:27] you say well what are you saying even
[1:38:29] adam and eve had
[1:38:30] pride right after they fought fail
[1:38:34] no don't well you know the the woman you
[1:38:37] gave me
[1:38:40] the woman says uh the serpent why i just
[1:38:42] said lord we were wrong
[1:38:44] we did just what you said we we
[1:38:46] shouldn't do it we did it
[1:38:49] god had to pull the truth out well who
[1:38:52] told you you was naked
[1:38:55] see that's what pride do it won't tell
[1:38:57] the truth it you know
[1:38:58] it won't go deep enough to expose the
[1:39:01] devil
[1:39:03] it'll keep you from exposing the devil
[1:39:05] because you feel like oh my world is
[1:39:07] going to go apart if i
[1:39:08] tell this i'm going to well let me tell
[1:39:10] you something if you don't tell it
[1:39:12] where are you going to end up at
[1:39:16] don't let pride hinder your walk with
[1:39:18] god
[1:39:21] that's what peter did too you know he
[1:39:22] had pride right oh lord i ain't going to
[1:39:25] deny you i'm going to be right there
[1:39:26] with you
[1:39:27] god said telling the word
[1:39:30] correcting the word or trying to tell
[1:39:32] the word you're wrong y'all understand
[1:39:34] that
[1:39:35] and she says oh you're going to die deny
[1:39:37] me three times before you know the
[1:39:39] cockroach three times you're going to
[1:39:40] deny me oh no
[1:39:42] yeah i wonder how he felt you know how
[1:39:44] shameful he felt
[1:39:47] you know what i'm going to tell you
[1:39:48] something all of us has done it
[1:39:51] one way yeah one three times more than
[1:39:54] yeah we've all done it
[1:39:56] when we should have stood up for jesus
[1:39:57] we did not
[1:40:01] alleluia help us jesus what a difference
[1:40:04] there would be
[1:40:04] what a correction there would be i got
[1:40:06] to move faster what a cutting away
[1:40:08] there would be what a joy there would be
[1:40:10] what a power there would be
[1:40:12] when men and women would take god at
[1:40:14] face
[1:40:15] value what is the truth
[1:40:18] no matter what the circumstances look
[1:40:21] like
[1:40:22] that has nothing to do with it god
[1:40:25] says so that settles it
[1:40:31] that was good see because i
[1:40:35] know as human being we do it
[1:40:38] but we've got to stop it we got to ask
[1:40:41] god to help us
[1:40:42] to stop that if god says i'm healed i'm
[1:40:46] healed
[1:40:48] all right i got a situation right here
[1:40:50] amen well
[1:40:51] i had a situation but i've been claiming
[1:40:53] my healing
[1:40:55] see what to see how quickly the devil
[1:40:56] tried to make you own something that's
[1:40:58] not yours anymore
[1:41:00] never was mine hallelujah
[1:41:03] all right and these old doctors trying
[1:41:05] to tell me oh please
[1:41:07] i says lord you raise the dead
[1:41:11] you bring life this is just a little
[1:41:16] something
[1:41:18] but brother books what if you lose your
[1:41:20] sight i
[1:41:21] shall know him
[1:41:25] i shall know
[1:41:28] oh my god i wish i could feel what i'm
[1:41:32] feeling up here
[1:41:34] when god was going to destroy the world
[1:41:37] one
[1:41:37] time because of his sin and wickedness
[1:41:41] noah built god an ark
[1:41:44] we do not wish to try to achieve
[1:41:46] anything
[1:41:47] listen because see what i'm trying to
[1:41:49] say is that if you don't accept
[1:41:52] the achievement you don't accept what
[1:41:54] he's already achieved
[1:41:55] you're going to miss the rapture you
[1:41:58] understand me
[1:41:59] you must accept what he's done for you
[1:42:01] like for example a pardon is not a
[1:42:03] pardon except to be
[1:42:05] received as a pardon and everything that
[1:42:08] christ has done
[1:42:09] is finished when jesus said it's
[1:42:11] finished that's exactly what he meant
[1:42:14] but he needs somebody to believe it's
[1:42:17] finished
[1:42:17] and if you can believe that he can work
[1:42:20] you up to the place where he wants you
[1:42:21] to work
[1:42:22] because you're not struggling with
[1:42:24] condemnation
[1:42:27] you know we struggle with that stuff and
[1:42:28] we shouldn't be so condemning ourselves
[1:42:31] it shows that we're lacking confidence
[1:42:33] in the word
[1:42:35] with the stripes we're healed oh
[1:42:38] not that god is going to deliver us he's
[1:42:40] delivered us already
[1:42:42] he's healed us already he saved us
[1:42:44] already
[1:42:45] we're in heavenly places now in christ
[1:42:48] jesus
[1:42:48] because of him but we must accept that
[1:42:53] i wake up every morning now desiring to
[1:42:56] be in heavenly places
[1:42:57] remaining in that heavenly place i don't
[1:43:00] want to be in the
[1:43:01] natural and you know i got to do natural
[1:43:03] things but let my spirit be in that
[1:43:06] heavenly place
[1:43:09] huh because there's nothing for us to
[1:43:12] achieve in this way
[1:43:14] we just accept that what's already been
[1:43:17] achieved god caused noah to build an
[1:43:21] ark that would save the world if they
[1:43:24] would believe it
[1:43:26] ah right now who is our ark
[1:43:29] jesus christ and all they had to do
[1:43:33] they didn't have to you know build the
[1:43:34] octaves you see the whole world
[1:43:36] missed it because they would not accept
[1:43:39] what god had already done
[1:43:40] he provided a way of escape he provided
[1:43:44] a way of safety
[1:43:45] and those who denied the way it was lost
[1:43:48] but if you just believe that it's
[1:43:49] already done
[1:43:52] how it takes the law and throws it out
[1:43:54] the window
[1:43:59] i love this grace because i i don't know
[1:44:01] what y'all but i need
[1:44:04] i'm laughing but y'all don't know i need
[1:44:06] this grace
[1:44:08] i don't know if grace wasn't here i
[1:44:10] don't know oh lord have mercy
[1:44:12] i need this grace and you don't want
[1:44:14] your portion give it to me
[1:44:16] i'll take it
[1:44:19] but god knew they wasn't going to be
[1:44:21] saved so he made it just so many
[1:44:24] cubit long and as he did in the days of
[1:44:27] noah
[1:44:27] he promised to do it at the coming of
[1:44:30] the son of man
[1:44:31] he's got a gospel it doesn't reach out
[1:44:34] and let men and women come into the
[1:44:36] kingdom of god loaded with sin and
[1:44:38] unbelief
[1:44:39] it's narrow but it's the way
[1:44:44] that's what i tell these folks oh i
[1:44:46] believe the message let me tell you
[1:44:48] something
[1:44:49] they believe moses message and look what
[1:44:51] happened
[1:44:54] you can't tell me that noah didn't have
[1:44:55] a mega church i know he did
[1:44:58] because moses had one but at the end of
[1:45:01] the day how many did he have left
[1:45:04] it was a new generation that came up but
[1:45:06] at the end
[1:45:07] of moses ministry really the ones who
[1:45:10] had followed him
[1:45:11] amen and got to that place was joshua
[1:45:13] and caleb
[1:45:17] the new generation had to be
[1:45:18] re-circumcised
[1:45:21] at least noah had a little bit more than
[1:45:23] that
[1:45:26] see you can't stop the sun from shining
[1:45:29] with unbelief
[1:45:31] you couldn't stop the program of god
[1:45:33] with your unbelief
[1:45:35] john the baptist said god able of these
[1:45:38] stones to rise children to abraham
[1:45:40] see god's word has spoken it's got
[1:45:44] to come to pass see somebody's going to
[1:45:47] hear it
[1:45:48] somebody's going to get the benefits of
[1:45:51] it
[1:45:52] i don't know about you but i'm one of
[1:45:54] those somebodies
[1:45:55] now you could be something i'm not going
[1:45:57] to be selfish you could be someone else
[1:45:59] you could be one of those somebodies but
[1:46:01] he said somebody is going to get it
[1:46:03] somebody is going to get the benefits of
[1:46:05] it and we'll
[1:46:07] all free moral agents can take our
[1:46:10] choice
[1:46:12] but look what happened in the days of
[1:46:13] noah all that heard were
[1:46:16] called fanatics they made fun of him up
[1:46:19] on the hill
[1:46:20] building this ark never water had come
[1:46:23] down and science
[1:46:24] might have come to him and said where is
[1:46:26] the water at
[1:46:27] show me where he's at it is but god's
[1:46:30] program
[1:46:31] has never been upon material things
[1:46:34] it's been faith in his word that's god's
[1:46:38] provided way to take his word for it
[1:46:41] believe it something that you cannot
[1:46:44] scientifically prove
[1:46:47] nor says i cannot tell you where the
[1:46:49] water is
[1:46:50] but god told me it's going to come
[1:46:53] that's good enough for me
[1:46:56] i don't know how i'm going to be
[1:46:57] raptured i don't know
[1:47:00] but it's good enough for me he says so i
[1:47:03] believe it
[1:47:04] i'm taking it into my soul that's what i
[1:47:07] live for you think i've tried walking
[1:47:09] this christian life
[1:47:10] all my life just to come up short
[1:47:14] i don't think so well i know it's not so
[1:47:19] you shouldn't either we're too close to
[1:47:22] to the finish line
[1:47:24] but you're going to have to realize it
[1:47:25] ain't about all of you and your ability
[1:47:27] to do anything
[1:47:29] my mind there's a lot of preachers
[1:47:31] that's going to be in hell
[1:47:32] a lot of them going to be left behind
[1:47:34] too
[1:47:36] hello powerful singers
[1:47:40] can call jesus on the scene
[1:47:44] but that ain't it gifts and callings are
[1:47:47] without repentance is whether god has
[1:47:50] chosen you to be bribed
[1:47:53] and let me tell you something right now
[1:47:56] the bride knows her season
[1:48:00] she knows it she can't help it she can't
[1:48:02] explain it but she know
[1:48:04] now is the time to hurry i said hurry
[1:48:07] and make yourself ready she knows it she
[1:48:11] feels it
[1:48:12] it's in the air
[1:48:15] oh god help us see i can't tell you
[1:48:18] where the water is but see that's all i
[1:48:20] know
[1:48:20] god told me he's going to come and
[1:48:22] that's good enough for me
[1:48:24] so he built the ark and made ready for
[1:48:25] it
[1:48:27] made ready for it the bride makes
[1:48:30] herself ready
[1:48:32] why are you making yourself ready
[1:48:33] because you can see the rain is about to
[1:48:35] fall
[1:48:36] right and brother branham said it like
[1:48:38] this he said it's the same thing
[1:48:39] when the pressure from the council of
[1:48:41] churches come on the church he says it's
[1:48:43] too late
[1:48:43] you already got the mark you can't make
[1:48:46] yourself ready he said that's equivalent
[1:48:48] to what it is when when rain started
[1:48:50] falling everybody wanted to come on now
[1:48:53] he said but the door was shut it was too
[1:48:55] late then
[1:48:59] can i say something i want to say this
[1:49:04] the holy ghost is not a feeling
[1:49:07] the holy ghost is a person
[1:49:10] don't get your feelings mixed up with
[1:49:12] the holy ghost that's pentecostal
[1:49:15] i don't feel him you ain't got to feel
[1:49:17] it
[1:49:18] he said this this is the word in that
[1:49:22] day
[1:49:22] you'll know that i'm in the father and
[1:49:24] the father's in me
[1:49:26] and i am in you how do you know he's in
[1:49:28] me he said he was
[1:49:30] i don't have to feel him
[1:49:36] i don't feel what that got to do with
[1:49:38] anything
[1:49:40] you know i got a liver i don't feel my
[1:49:42] liver
[1:49:46] they say i got an appendix too i never
[1:49:49] felt it
[1:49:52] but it's in there i believe it
[1:49:58] it's one of those things i don't have to
[1:49:59] see you know
[1:50:02] it's a great thing it's great things are
[1:50:05] quiet things
[1:50:06] i got this from brother troy we talked
[1:50:08] about it today i thought he don't even
[1:50:10] know it but this is good
[1:50:12] this goes with a message did you know
[1:50:14] that friends listen
[1:50:16] the sun which gives life on the earth
[1:50:19] to every living thing in botany life
[1:50:22] plant life tree life whatever more
[1:50:24] it brings forth life the sun does
[1:50:28] and it can call can draw a million
[1:50:31] gallons of water from the earth
[1:50:32] and he he quoted that and almost could
[1:50:35] see all that water going up like that
[1:50:38] now you can't see it
[1:50:41] but the change is being made you can't
[1:50:44] even feel it
[1:50:46] but the change is being made and all of
[1:50:49] a sudden you see clouds up there
[1:50:51] how did they get up there it was a
[1:50:53] process
[1:50:56] where the changes of these uh
[1:50:59] oxygen and all that other kind of stuff
[1:51:01] whatever brought it together
[1:51:03] now the water is above us
[1:51:06] you can walk through a cloud won't harm
[1:51:09] you
[1:51:10] right but did you know those same clouds
[1:51:12] can bring forth some bad hail
[1:51:17] and i think in texas they said that they
[1:51:19] had hail like that
[1:51:21] broke up people's cars and everything
[1:51:22] just last week i think it was a week
[1:51:24] before last
[1:51:25] really bad glad i wasn't in that storm
[1:51:29] but the point is these changes
[1:51:32] are made think about the people who had
[1:51:35] a real nice shine that day
[1:51:37] and the storm came and just tore their
[1:51:38] car to pieces
[1:51:41] you know it happens like i said
[1:51:44] sometimes changes come
[1:51:45] abruptly ask a woman who's impregnated
[1:51:49] she's going to have a baby the doctor
[1:51:50] told her she got two men two weeks late
[1:51:52] or two weeks
[1:51:54] more to go and the baby says not so
[1:51:59] comes abruptly you didn't know it was
[1:52:01] coming all of a sudden
[1:52:02] here it is it's on you see
[1:52:06] you was expecting it but it abruptly
[1:52:08] came and it came at a time when you
[1:52:09] least expect it
[1:52:10] and that's how the rapture is going to
[1:52:12] be that's how the change is going to be
[1:52:15] it's going to be
[1:52:16] a secret that's why i try to tell people
[1:52:18] i don't know exactly how we're going to
[1:52:20] see it
[1:52:21] how it's going to be he's coming 63 and
[1:52:23] i know we're going to meet him but the
[1:52:25] point is everybody won't see him
[1:52:28] not this time everybody didn't see jesus
[1:52:31] when he was raised
[1:52:32] when he raised up into those clouds
[1:52:36] on his disciples those who followed him
[1:52:40] right so what are you saying i'm saying
[1:52:43] all i know is however he does it because
[1:52:46] god
[1:52:47] interprets his own word i'm so tired of
[1:52:49] men trying to tell me how it's going to
[1:52:50] be done
[1:52:51] i don't care
[1:52:55] as long as i'm part of it and i ain't
[1:52:58] going to break up i ain't going to have
[1:52:59] this doctor know what's going to be done
[1:53:01] like this
[1:53:01] that's exactly what brother bram said he
[1:53:04] said the pharisees and the sadducees one
[1:53:06] came on the white horse
[1:53:07] one came this way he's going to come
[1:53:09] this way and hear jesus come on a donkey
[1:53:14] the messiah on a donkey who's going to
[1:53:17] believe that
[1:53:18] well he had a group of people who saw
[1:53:21] the messiah
[1:53:23] entering into jerusalem crying hosanna
[1:53:26] hosanna
[1:53:27] see god will never leave himself without
[1:53:30] a witness
[1:53:32] hallelujah see and it came it can draw a
[1:53:36] million
[1:53:37] gallons of water from the earth make a
[1:53:38] less noise that we can't get a bucket
[1:53:40] out of a pump
[1:53:43] brother branham knew how to put things
[1:53:44] together
[1:53:46] because that's the truth i don't know
[1:53:48] whether y'all well some of y'all might
[1:53:49] know with a pump and how to pump water
[1:53:52] yeah you got to work hard to get a
[1:53:54] bucket
[1:53:56] but it comes unless you got a good well
[1:53:58] it comes and all of that noise and god
[1:54:01] can
[1:54:01] do that and he amazes me
[1:54:05] oh we think we have a lot of knowledge
[1:54:07] and have to have a brass band to be
[1:54:10] a lot of jumping up and down and we
[1:54:12] ain't got a
[1:54:13] and we ain't got a good meeting we think
[1:54:16] everybody has to be on top
[1:54:18] they're clapping their hands and things
[1:54:20] and we think the music has to be going
[1:54:22] in a rhythm and everybody running up and
[1:54:24] down the island
[1:54:25] we had that and we good what good has it
[1:54:28] done
[1:54:29] where is it at where has it got us today
[1:54:33] come on and i don't mean no harm i came
[1:54:35] out of pentecostal church or apostolic
[1:54:38] i mean we tore it up
[1:54:42] yes sir i always came out of the church
[1:54:46] wet
[1:54:47] from sweat
[1:54:52] i said always but most of the time y'all
[1:54:54] know what i'm saying
[1:54:56] and you know what it is we became
[1:54:58] legalist
[1:55:00] if you don't do it this way you're wrong
[1:55:03] you ain't got the holy ghost it's like
[1:55:05] if you don't speak in tongues
[1:55:07] you don't have the holy ghost what a lie
[1:55:10] and if you don't shout what a lie and if
[1:55:13] you don't dance i tell you what i get
[1:55:15] sick of that systematic stuff
[1:55:17] and i want to see change
[1:55:20] change me lord if i got to do that
[1:55:23] change me
[1:55:25] everybody can do that anybody can do
[1:55:27] that a sinner can get under that
[1:55:28] anointing and dance
[1:55:32] but that ain't you just come out wet
[1:55:35] we need change we can't allow our church
[1:55:38] to be
[1:55:39] systematic and so in a system you know
[1:55:41] i've been guilty i'll tell you what
[1:55:44] i've been guilty i'm guilty as charge
[1:55:48] i want to see people happy and i love to
[1:55:50] see them jump and i
[1:55:51] i love to see them just worship but you
[1:55:53] know what everybody got their own way
[1:55:56] of doing it we can't become systematic
[1:55:59] and we have been and i
[1:56:01] perhaps you know been part of it
[1:56:04] but now we're tearing it down every man
[1:56:07] must be free
[1:56:10] what we want to see in this little
[1:56:11] fellowship and i'm going to close in
[1:56:12] just a bit
[1:56:13] but what we want to see is change
[1:56:16] i thought about i said lord maybe i
[1:56:17] should put a bulletin board up there
[1:56:19] a bit a big piece of sheet of paper up
[1:56:21] there so everybody can write their
[1:56:23] testimonies on
[1:56:24] how god has changed them i like to see
[1:56:27] that
[1:56:28] because you know people don't tell oh
[1:56:29] god don't deliver me from that and then
[1:56:31] you don't have to sign your name to it
[1:56:35] right in a way that nobody knows your
[1:56:36] handwriting
[1:56:38] but i love to see those testimonies you
[1:56:41] can't tell me god is not doing things
[1:56:43] people
[1:56:45] i know he is with me hallelujah
[1:56:49] right think about it it was going well
[1:56:53] and i'm finna close in just a bit
[1:56:54] it was going well with cain and abel
[1:56:58] until abel uh uh abel was murdered
[1:57:02] and you know it all seemed lost i don't
[1:57:04] even know how adam and eve felt
[1:57:06] but somehow you know they were emotional
[1:57:08] about it because adam and eve
[1:57:10] knew that cain was not theirs he
[1:57:12] couldn't carry on the bloodline like i
[1:57:14] said
[1:57:15] can you imagine when god gave uh eve
[1:57:19] seth because we didn't know
[1:57:22] that uh eve had girls until brother
[1:57:24] branham told us
[1:57:26] and you know the thing is you know can
[1:57:28] you imagine how
[1:57:29] he they must have fell when seth came up
[1:57:33] another boy god has appointed
[1:57:36] me another seed
[1:57:40] and brother balaam said that was a type
[1:57:41] of the resurrection
[1:57:44] abel went down and seth came up
[1:57:48] right then men began to call on the name
[1:57:52] of the lord
[1:57:55] amen hallelujah
[1:57:59] see it wasn't adam and eve's business at
[1:58:01] that time
[1:58:02] it was god who appointed the seed right
[1:58:06] but this is the message that we have
[1:58:08] heard from the beginning and that we
[1:58:10] should love one another
[1:58:12] now see i'm bringing something here
[1:58:14] because we're talking about rapture
[1:58:15] material
[1:58:17] not as cain who was jealous of his
[1:58:20] brother
[1:58:21] who sought to slay him and did slay him
[1:58:24] i read a little capture today you know
[1:58:27] about uh we just say man don't don't
[1:58:31] mess with that guy man he's a
[1:58:32] backstabber y'all know what a
[1:58:33] backstabber is
[1:58:35] it's a person who comes behind your back
[1:58:37] and discredits your character
[1:58:40] you know but now they don't they don't
[1:58:43] stab you in the back they shoot arrows
[1:58:49] you don't even know but you got all
[1:58:50] these things in the back
[1:58:53] and you're wondering why people are
[1:58:54] looking at you so strange and so funny
[1:59:02] that's true don't you know people who
[1:59:05] take lies before they take the truth
[1:59:08] they love to hear that strange stuff
[1:59:11] and people will go off and take oh well
[1:59:13] i think he's somebody i was
[1:59:15] this this is the truth i was accused
[1:59:19] of about a brother in my church i used
[1:59:22] to go to
[1:59:22] i won't call no name and my pastor at
[1:59:25] the time believed this guy
[1:59:27] now can you imagine how hurt i was
[1:59:30] when my pastor said the lie that he he
[1:59:33] received
[1:59:34] to me was a reliable source
[1:59:41] oh i know i got the holy ghost
[1:59:46] because in those days
[1:59:51] the days prior to that
[1:59:54] that would have been a fight i would
[1:59:56] have convinced him a different way
[1:59:58] y'all looking at me like i'm crazy but
[2:00:00] see y'all that's old man that i'm just
[2:00:02] telling you that's the way it would have
[2:00:03] been
[2:00:04] he wouldn't have so smoothly gotten away
[2:00:07] and the guy that lied to me finally came
[2:00:10] back and
[2:00:11] made the right thing to to the pastor
[2:00:13] but never confessed to me
[2:00:14] never made it right y'all understand me
[2:00:18] but just listen listen those things
[2:00:20] those deeds always show up
[2:00:22] because this brother don't even believe
[2:00:24] the message anymore
[2:00:26] god has a way
[2:00:30] concocted a real lie
[2:00:33] but the hurting part was my pastor
[2:00:37] believed it
[2:00:40] that's why i am so ever so ever cautious
[2:00:43] about
[2:00:44] things i hear i don't swiftly
[2:00:47] move to things because people want me to
[2:00:50] swiftly move
[2:00:52] i weigh them i pray over them i seek god
[2:00:56] for how to handle things god knows it's
[2:01:00] true
[2:01:02] it might bring me down in my spirit a
[2:01:04] little bit
[2:01:05] because i'm worried about you know what
[2:01:08] let me say it like this
[2:01:10] i believe i'm working with the bride and
[2:01:13] i know i must deal with you
[2:01:15] according to the way god would have me
[2:01:16] deal with you
[2:01:18] i fear god more than any if you all of
[2:01:20] y'all say i'm going to kill you
[2:01:22] and you're going to deny this word i'm
[2:01:23] saying hey should i get the knife or the
[2:01:25] gun or whatever you need to do it with
[2:01:27] because it ain't no backing up on this
[2:01:31] anyway let's move on not as cain who was
[2:01:34] that wicked one and slew his brother
[2:01:38] and wherefore slew he him because his
[2:01:42] own works were evil and his brothers
[2:01:45] righteous so basically he's saying
[2:01:47] it was all about jealousy right
[2:01:50] think about how you would have felt i i
[2:01:52] won't say you
[2:01:53] think about how cain must have felt when
[2:01:55] he realized he was not in the lineage of
[2:01:58] adam
[2:02:00] and god could not accept him because he
[2:02:02] was not of the chosen bloodline
[2:02:06] god ain't choosing nobody you're not
[2:02:08] going nowhere
[2:02:09] unless you're of the bloodline of jesus
[2:02:11] christ
[2:02:14] that's it he said listen
[2:02:18] cain if you do as your brother i'll let
[2:02:20] you live a good life a moral life and i
[2:02:22] won't even separate you
[2:02:24] but he goes and he kills his brother why
[2:02:26] because his daddy
[2:02:28] was a burden
[2:02:31] spiritually but cain exemplified
[2:02:34] what his daddy really was like
[2:02:39] see all your big statues and stuffed
[2:02:41] shirts didn't go
[2:02:42] with god you might be a ddd or phd or
[2:02:46] double ld
[2:02:47] you might be a bishop pope or whatever
[2:02:48] you might be
[2:02:50] but it takes god to make something out
[2:02:52] of nothing
[2:02:54] as long as you can be nothing god is the
[2:02:58] something
[2:02:59] as long as you can get yourself out of
[2:03:01] the way
[2:03:02] then god can come in but when you're so
[2:03:06] stuffed up and started
[2:03:08] till you got the biggest and the best
[2:03:11] you haven't got
[2:03:12] nothing that you ought to have and
[2:03:14] that's a humble heart before god
[2:03:16] and we know that brethren certainly sure
[2:03:20] you never did see hear the sun rise or
[2:03:24] never did hear that see and my whole
[2:03:26] point is
[2:03:27] these changes that are being made in us
[2:03:29] you don't hear it you don't hear the
[2:03:31] crackling and all of that something
[2:03:33] but somehow you must know i'm not where
[2:03:36] i used to be
[2:03:37] there's got to be a growth there's got
[2:03:39] to be a growth
[2:03:40] right when the word of god was open
[2:03:44] amen according to uh revelations 8 1
[2:03:47] amen the bible said there was silence in
[2:03:49] the heaven by
[2:03:50] the space of a half hour more was done
[2:03:54] in that little half hour than anything
[2:03:55] else
[2:03:57] and you said what do you mean brother
[2:03:59] brooks yeah i've seen people
[2:04:02] well as this date to that day that day
[2:04:04] to this day
[2:04:06] you know what different does it make it
[2:04:10] was silence
[2:04:13] that means nothing was being said
[2:04:18] well in heaven nothing was being said
[2:04:20] but on earth
[2:04:22] hallelujah i can see some i can see that
[2:04:27] right i mean here it was amen god spoke
[2:04:31] to
[2:04:31] saul he heard him
[2:04:35] the other one said it's thunder then
[2:04:37] when god was calling samuel
[2:04:39] samuel runs to saul and said did you
[2:04:42] call me
[2:04:43] it was silence to him but samuel heard
[2:04:47] the voice of god
[2:04:50] that's why brother said you could be in
[2:04:51] the same meeting one can hear
[2:04:53] the other one cannot some see the pillar
[2:04:56] fire some don't
[2:04:59] right one brother told me years ago and
[2:05:01] i he says oh
[2:05:03] you didn't see the pill of fire said but
[2:05:04] you wasn't there
[2:05:07] how you gonna tell me what i haven't
[2:05:08] seen with a pillow fire he brought his
[2:05:10] little doctor and i said brother
[2:05:12] you too late whatever you're trying to
[2:05:15] convince me of you too late for this
[2:05:17] i know what i've seen and i've seen the
[2:05:19] pillow five more than once
[2:05:22] i'm not bagging i'm saying god appears
[2:05:24] to whoever he wants to
[2:05:25] he's the same yesterday today and
[2:05:27] forever and because i've seen the pill
[2:05:29] of fire doesn't mean i'm even saved
[2:05:31] that has nothing to do with salvation
[2:05:33] the millions right in israel
[2:05:36] they saw the pillar of fire pill-up
[2:05:39] cloud
[2:05:40] and still was lost
[2:05:43] oh i'm trying to hurry i'm almost in my
[2:05:44] last scripture he went right on
[2:05:47] revealing his word to the body
[2:05:49] and vindicating him same by himself
[2:05:53] his children begins to kind of look more
[2:05:56] like him
[2:05:57] because it's fully maturing you hear me
[2:06:00] this is from marriage and divorce
[2:06:02] they become children of the word not
[2:06:05] children of the church
[2:06:07] children of the word and the word bride
[2:06:10] will be
[2:06:10] lovely little lady of the word
[2:06:13] unadulterated
[2:06:15] not touched by any man's organization
[2:06:18] this is why i try to tell you
[2:06:19] i'm not going to be your king i'm not
[2:06:23] going to
[2:06:23] rule you like that i'm not going to let
[2:06:26] that spirit of the nicolaitan come on me
[2:06:28] i'm not going to try to make you do
[2:06:31] nothing
[2:06:33] i preach the word you make the choice
[2:06:38] people say are you so soft well i'm soft
[2:06:41] this is how god
[2:06:42] made me
[2:06:45] if you know my daddy my natural daddy
[2:06:47] you'll be glad i'm soft
[2:06:50] but my point is show me a rough dove
[2:06:55] then i could say well there is a type
[2:07:00] but you got to understand when i'm up
[2:07:02] here it's the holy spirit ministering to
[2:07:04] you
[2:07:05] i have to be very careful on how to say
[2:07:08] it the way he wants me to say it
[2:07:10] i'm going to be judged for it
[2:07:13] that's right i mean just last week i had
[2:07:15] somebody told me i was too soft
[2:07:18] and i'm looking at him and i said but
[2:07:19] you're too hard see the judgment can go
[2:07:22] both ways
[2:07:24] right and my point is this when it comes
[2:07:27] to the word of god
[2:07:28] i know what it means for people to to
[2:07:31] dominate you
[2:07:32] i'm not here to do that you know
[2:07:35] the church age preachers do that
[2:07:38] in laodicea they do that but the
[2:07:42] headstone has come hasn't he
[2:07:44] hey eliezer had to move out the way
[2:07:47] brother brooks got to move out the way
[2:07:49] this is this is the time for isaac to
[2:07:52] make love with his bride
[2:07:54] i have no right i no preacher does but
[2:07:58] they do it anyway
[2:08:00] and they're going to have to answer to
[2:08:01] god for it you can't man handle god's
[2:08:03] bride
[2:08:04] and think you're going to get away with
[2:08:05] it absolutely not
[2:08:11] whoo y'all don't get quiet
[2:08:14] but it's the truth that's why it's so
[2:08:16] bad out there
[2:08:18] that's why it's so bad out there people
[2:08:19] don't even know how to make spiritual
[2:08:21] judgments and things of their own
[2:08:22] because they're
[2:08:23] used to people telling them what to do
[2:08:27] no you got to have your own holy ghost
[2:08:31] what's going to happen when the pressure
[2:08:32] come and you don't have a pastor over
[2:08:34] you
[2:08:35] you got to learn how to hear your god
[2:08:37] voice my sheep hear is my voice
[2:08:40] and a stranger they will not follow
[2:08:42] that's maturing right
[2:08:44] oh come on even in the natural your kids
[2:08:46] begin to grow up and say mama you can't
[2:08:48] tell me what to do now they better not
[2:08:50] say it like that but
[2:08:52] in other words they do what they're
[2:08:53] going to do
[2:08:55] i'm grown they'll say
[2:08:59] yeah when a child comes to that
[2:09:02] place and they're searching for their uh
[2:09:05] manhood or womanhood
[2:09:06] they're gonna do things that you're not
[2:09:08] gonna agree with because they're
[2:09:09] searching the land
[2:09:11] they need to know how far they can go
[2:09:14] what they're supposed to do
[2:09:15] how they can do it you understand what
[2:09:17] i'm saying it's a part of their identity
[2:09:19] to know
[2:09:20] their uh capabilities
[2:09:24] you need to know your capabilities in
[2:09:26] god and the bible said all things are
[2:09:28] possible to them that believe
[2:09:30] why have a boundary right
[2:09:34] yeah i got friends right now who are
[2:09:37] in marital mess up because they were in
[2:09:40] a church where the pastor told him
[2:09:42] who to marry now that they've left the
[2:09:45] church
[2:09:46] amen with their wives they don't want
[2:09:48] them anymore now they're remarrying
[2:09:51] yeah pastor told me this ain't no
[2:09:55] figment of my imagination i'm telling
[2:09:57] you what's real what's true
[2:09:58] around this message
[2:10:03] telling you what to who to marry come on
[2:10:06] but anyway if they did tell you and you
[2:10:09] did it
[2:10:10] you that's your fault
[2:10:15] you let them do that you made the choice
[2:10:18] like
[2:10:19] like brother brown said that girl she
[2:10:20] doesn't lost her mind
[2:10:22] coming i know johnny loves me
[2:10:29] if johnny loved you he would have
[2:10:32] married you
[2:10:33] he made the choice no matter what his
[2:10:35] daddy said
[2:10:38] people try to tell the truth
[2:10:40] [Music]
[2:10:41] i'm almost done i'm just going to read
[2:10:42] these listen i'm coming to the end of
[2:10:45] this
[2:10:45] i got two more scripture amen
[2:10:48] matthew 25 34 and 40 i'm going to try
[2:10:50] not to expound too much on it
[2:10:52] then shall the king say unto them on his
[2:10:55] right hand
[2:10:56] come be blessed of my father
[2:11:01] inherit the kingdom prepared for you and
[2:11:04] from the foundation of the world
[2:11:06] for i was a hungry and you gave me meat
[2:11:11] i was thirsty and you gave me drink
[2:11:15] i was a stranger and you took me in now
[2:11:17] there is a balance to what i just said a
[2:11:19] few minutes ago people of god
[2:11:21] because the spirit of god also says that
[2:11:24] you need
[2:11:25] no teacher you know people use that i
[2:11:26] don't need no teacher
[2:11:28] then brother bam says you got to have a
[2:11:29] balance today god said teachers
[2:11:32] in the church you see what i'm saying
[2:11:35] and the pastor is there to help you to
[2:11:38] lead you
[2:11:38] you know but what i'm trying to say the
[2:11:41] part i'm trying to work with is your
[2:11:43] maturing into making decisions and
[2:11:46] god decisions i hope i got that over god
[2:11:50] i'll show you what i was trying to say
[2:11:52] if i was hungry and you gave me meat i
[2:11:54] was thirsty and you gave me drink i was
[2:11:55] stranger
[2:11:56] and you took me in naked and you clothed
[2:11:58] me i was sick
[2:12:00] and you visited me i was in prison and
[2:12:02] you came unto me
[2:12:03] then shall the righteous answer him
[2:12:06] saying
[2:12:06] lord this this gets to me every time
[2:12:10] when saw ye hungry and fed thee
[2:12:14] are thirsty and gave thee drink when saw
[2:12:17] thee a stranger and took thee in or
[2:12:20] naked
[2:12:20] and clothed thee or when saw we seek or
[2:12:24] in prison
[2:12:25] and came unto thee
[2:12:28] and the king shall answer and say unto
[2:12:31] them verily
[2:12:32] i say unto you and as much as you have
[2:12:35] done it unto one of the least of these
[2:12:37] my brethren ye have done it unto me
[2:12:42] now we always look at people from
[2:12:44] outside those thirst
[2:12:45] what about the people among your church
[2:12:48] your assembly that you don't even know
[2:12:49] their names where they live at
[2:12:51] you don't have no idea who they really
[2:12:53] are you just know they come to the same
[2:12:55] church
[2:12:55] and we ought to be ashamed of ourselves
[2:12:58] because we're supposed to be the family
[2:12:59] of god
[2:13:01] see this is the kind of level this is
[2:13:02] the level of love that we're supposed to
[2:13:04] be on
[2:13:05] when we make a rapture that we so
[2:13:07] automatically do things in the spirit
[2:13:09] that we're not
[2:13:10] looking for a reward
[2:13:13] but anytime you do something looking for
[2:13:15] a reward
[2:13:18] you get your reward your reward is maybe
[2:13:21] thank you somebody going to tell you
[2:13:24] thank you if that's what you want
[2:13:26] but you know what i don't care about
[2:13:28] that when something good is being done i
[2:13:31] don't care if nobody recognized me i
[2:13:33] don't
[2:13:33] care now let me tell you something there
[2:13:35] was a time that i used to
[2:13:37] but i don't anymore i don't need no
[2:13:39] recognition like that
[2:13:41] i just want his recognition when i read
[2:13:44] this i want him to say i did that
[2:13:47] i will you know i mean without even
[2:13:48] thinking about it my last scripture
[2:13:51] matt uh first corinthians 15 15
[2:13:55] we're changing we must look for change
[2:13:58] we must thirst for the change we must
[2:14:00] ask for the change
[2:14:01] we must examine ourselves to make sure
[2:14:03] that there are things there to be
[2:14:05] changed
[2:14:05] you all know what i'm saying you got to
[2:14:08] watch cleans up every day
[2:14:10] you got to look into yourself see your
[2:14:11] faults and acknowledge him
[2:14:13] make those confessions unto the lord
[2:14:15] talk to him
[2:14:16] tell him what your desire is i don't
[2:14:18] know i hate this world
[2:14:20] i just don't like it i don't care i know
[2:14:23] that word care sometimes it's a hard
[2:14:25] word
[2:14:26] but it's it's almost like
[2:14:29] every man for himself
[2:14:33] in that way when it comes to god
[2:14:36] straight
[2:14:37] and narrow is the way and only a few be
[2:14:40] that find it
[2:14:42] i'm not expecting a a great crowd
[2:14:45] you know uh being a brother was talking
[2:14:48] today
[2:14:48] when brother bam said he went up to
[2:14:50] chicago and shook chicago
[2:14:53] and all he got was rosella
[2:15:00] we think we got shaking we got to get a
[2:15:02] whole bunch of stuff
[2:15:04] shook well look how he went through
[2:15:06] jerusalem and nazareth and all these
[2:15:08] places one here
[2:15:09] one here one here one here every now and
[2:15:12] again he'll get two
[2:15:15] but it's always been that way not the
[2:15:17] majority of people
[2:15:19] behold i show you a mystery we shall not
[2:15:23] all sleep but ye we shall be changed
[2:15:27] in a moment and in the twinkling of an
[2:15:29] eye at the last trump for the trump
[2:15:31] shall sound
[2:15:32] and the dead shall be raised corruptable
[2:15:34] and we shall be excuse me raised
[2:15:36] incorruptible
[2:15:37] and we shall be changed for this
[2:15:40] corruptible
[2:15:41] must put on incorruption and this mortal
[2:15:44] must put on on immortality
[2:15:48] so when this corruptable shall have put
[2:15:50] on immortality
[2:15:54] the flesh is grass let me tell you
[2:15:57] you can put all kind of weed killers on
[2:15:59] it everything else and make it looking
[2:16:00] good
[2:16:01] but it's going to wither
[2:16:06] i look in the mirror sometimes lord have
[2:16:08] mercy so when this corruptable shall put
[2:16:11] on incorruption
[2:16:13] and this mortal shall put on immortality
[2:16:15] then shall be brought to pass the
[2:16:18] saying that is written death is
[2:16:19] swallowed up in victory
[2:16:23] o death where is thy thief saying o
[2:16:25] grave
[2:16:26] where is thy victory the sting of death
[2:16:30] is sin
[2:16:31] and the strength of sin is the law but
[2:16:34] thanks be to god which giveth us the
[2:16:37] victory
[2:16:38] through our lord jesus christ therefore
[2:16:42] my beloved brethren and this is what i'm
[2:16:45] encouraging
[2:16:46] you with tonight the last words of this
[2:16:48] message
[2:16:50] be steadfast unmovable
[2:16:54] always abounding in the work of the lord
[2:16:58] for as much as you know that your labor
[2:17:02] is not in vain in the lord
[2:17:05] in the lord let's stand
[2:17:09] we appreciate you all
[2:17:13] for the sacrifice i know it's tough
[2:17:16] sometimes when you worked all day and
[2:17:18] come sit still for a while and i
[2:17:22] understand how sleep can capture you at
[2:17:24] times and
[2:17:26] don't bother it don't it doesn't bother
[2:17:28] me when i when i see the struggle
[2:17:30] because i understand the struggle
[2:17:32] but most of all god understands it more
[2:17:34] so than i do
[2:17:37] but i say to you by god's grace you know
[2:17:40] whatever you do
[2:17:40] don't forsake the assembling of yourself
[2:17:43] those who are
[2:17:44] online and hear me saying what i
[2:17:47] i'm saying it's it's more important now
[2:17:50] that you come to church and hear the
[2:17:51] word of god
[2:17:52] whether it comes through me whether it
[2:17:54] comes to troy
[2:17:56] whether it comes to isaac or whether it
[2:17:57] comes to samuel
[2:17:59] or whoever the brothers may be there's
[2:18:01] always something that you can
[2:18:03] hear and gain from hearing the word of
[2:18:06] god
[2:18:06] you know even if it's something that you
[2:18:08] feel like it's it's
[2:18:10] been repeated or whatever don't you
[2:18:12] understand the more things are repeated
[2:18:14] the more you can remember it and know it
[2:18:17] so people of god don't ever shortchange
[2:18:20] god
[2:18:21] i just believe that when i come to
[2:18:22] church i don't care who's preaching
[2:18:24] i'm going to get something i've never
[2:18:26] left the service without getting
[2:18:28] something
[2:18:29] you see what i'm saying and usually it's
[2:18:31] what i need to have for that day
[2:18:33] so i appreciate the lord i appreciate
[2:18:35] his ministries and
[2:18:36] appreciate the musicians and you know
[2:18:39] all of us who work together to
[2:18:40] help this assembly go forward like i
[2:18:43] said this is
[2:18:44] just a portion of the bride but if you
[2:18:48] of anything you must see you must see
[2:18:51] yourself
[2:18:52] as an individual as the bride not
[2:18:55] collectively
[2:18:57] you one
[2:19:00] and if you can see that then god can
[2:19:02] work with you
[2:19:03] take his promises this message is great
[2:19:05] and i i tell you what i
[2:19:07] i'm really excited about
[2:19:08] [Music]
[2:19:11] i don't know how but i'm just so excited
[2:19:14] i believe it with all my heart i'm
[2:19:16] closer now than i've ever been
[2:19:19] let's just have a word of prayer father
[2:19:22] god we come before you lord we thank you
[2:19:24] for your grace
[2:19:25] we thank you for your mercy we thank you
[2:19:27] for every heart that's here tonight

[2:19:32] those of us who are
[2:19:34] seeing your coming we see the drama we
[2:19:37] see the stage
[2:19:38] being set lord and you said that
[2:19:42] this thing is going to wind up with the
[2:19:43] persecution of the bride
[2:19:46] but you said lord god just at that time
[2:19:49] there's going to be a translation
[2:19:51] there'll be a little short quick work
[2:19:53] something that you'll do oh god i guess
[2:19:57] the way you did it there on the road to
[2:19:58] it layers
[2:20:00] you'll break the bread in a way that
[2:20:02] we'll understand it's
[2:20:03] you we'll vanish from out of the sight
[2:20:07] of the people
[2:20:08] help us now lord jesus keep us
[2:20:12] and guide us strengthen us lord jesus
