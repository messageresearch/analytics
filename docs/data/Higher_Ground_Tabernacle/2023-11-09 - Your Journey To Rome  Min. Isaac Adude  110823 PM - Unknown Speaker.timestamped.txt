[34:25] him amen he knows exactly that When God
[34:28] Says something that thing has to
[34:32] happen amen so when Paul when when when
[34:35] the the angel of the Lord appeared to
[34:39] Paul and told him that he will have to
[34:41] be God's witness in
[34:45] Rome amen Paul knew that he will not die
[34:48] he will before he he will not die but
[34:51] but he will get to
[34:54] Rome amen Paul knew that what Whatever
[34:57] May
[34:58] Come amen he will not die because he had
[35:01] a
[35:02] promise amen that he will have to be
[35:05] God's weakness in
[35:07] Rome amen that's the same thing with
[35:11] David he had an anointing from from
[35:15] God Amen God anointed David to become a
[35:20] king so it didn't matter if David had to
[35:23] face the
[35:25] Li
[35:28] it didn't matter if David had to face
[35:30] the
[35:31] bear even even when Goliath
[35:34] came amen David did not back
[35:39] up David did not
[35:42] Shake amen because he knew that he had a
[35:46] promise that before he
[35:49] dies amen he will have to become a king
[35:53] first so Paul had this
[35:55] promise amen that before he dies amen he
[35:59] will have to go to
[36:01] Rome amen but notice one thing here amen
[36:05] God did not tell Paul what Paul had to
[36:07] go
[36:11] through amen Paul that God did not tell
[36:13] Paul what he will have to go
[36:19] through amen God told him that he will
[36:21] have to go to Rome
[36:24] to amen and Paul knew that he will have
[36:27] to go to
[36:29] Rome but Paul did not know how he will
[36:32] have to go to
[36:34] Rome amen so right after that
[36:38] Vision right after that visitation
[36:42] of you read the in the next
[36:45] verse you see that the Bible says that
[36:47] more than 40
[36:51] people starting starting to
[36:55] fast
[36:59] fasting so that they can kill
[37:02] Paul amen here is Paul the verse before
[37:07] that amen God told him that you will
[37:09] have to go to
[37:11] Rome but right after that test
[37:17] become amen right after that
[37:21] visitation the devil now started to is
[37:23] trying to shake
[37:25] Paul
[37:27] amen first of all he had more than 40
[37:29] people to
[37:32] fast amen they had the mind made their
[37:35] minds made up that Paul will have to
[37:38] die amen they decided to kill
[37:42] Paul amen and then somebody there was a
[37:45] sister that was among
[37:48] them was among them when they went to
[37:51] when they went to the
[37:52] king amen she heard it then she went to
[37:55] tell Paul
[37:57] amen Paul did not
[37:59] Shake amen Paul did not start to think
[38:02] but God you told me that I will go
[38:06] to but here are 40 people about to kill
[38:11] me Lord how am I going to go to Rome if
[38:13] people are
[38:17] against Paul did not ask those
[38:21] questions Paul did not
[38:24] doubt amen but he still believed God
[38:28] amen and then the following verses shows
[38:30] how Paul was brought to
[38:34] judgment amen and Paul then requested to
[38:36] be heard by
[38:39] Caesar amen now we jump to verse uh
[38:41] verse 20 uh
[38:45] 27 amen that's when Paul now the journey
[38:50] started amen the first thing that
[38:54] happened amen a strong wind started to
[38:59] blow amen a tempest
[39:01] started amen the Bible even named the
[39:04] name of that
[39:08] temp the Bible named it
[39:14] euron amen that was the that was the uh
[39:16] uh the wind of of I think West and and
[39:20] and and north or something like
[39:24] that am the devil now starting to Temp
[39:28] Paul the devil starting to
[39:31] attack so notice that when Paul was
[39:34] doing that
[39:36] Journey amen he was close to
[39:40] Winter amen first of all he was
[39:43] cold amen and this one was different
[39:46] than his others Journey other
[39:50] Journey because this one he wasn't going
[39:52] as a free
[39:55] man
[39:57] amen but he was going as a
[39:59] prisoner amen so you take all the
[40:02] Comforts
[40:04] away there W no Comfort at all amen he
[40:08] had his hand all tied
[40:10] up amen and he was
[40:12] cold and now the devil decided to kill
[40:16] him because he knew man because he knew
[40:19] that God had some God had a work to to
[40:21] do
[40:24] with amen he brought that with
[40:28] strong amen and that wind wreck the
[40:33] Sheep amen throughout that
[40:37] Journey amen Paul did not doubt
[40:40] God Amen the prophet says in in a
[40:43] message proving his
[40:46] words amen paragraph

[41:01] the prayer
[41:02] cards up here and pray for
[41:08] them and omitting any other any other
[41:12] thing but just praying for the
[41:16] sick now listen the prophet says that
[41:19] but before we pray for the
[41:23] sick we've got to get the people in that

[43:54] coming to people
[43:58] amen now in verse 21 of that same
[44:01] chap amen Paul says that Paul D but
