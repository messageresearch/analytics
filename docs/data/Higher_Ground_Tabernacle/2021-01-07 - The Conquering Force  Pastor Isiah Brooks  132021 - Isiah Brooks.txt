here tonight amen safe and sound you know and he's kept us in this time of the corona and i know he's going to continue to keep us it's nothing of our goodness but it's just the mercy and grace of god i heard and had a brother basically of course text me and from south africa telling me about the pastors and all that have died there under this corona and here in one place not only that the father died but the son as well it's it's terrible there and yet we sit here and we fail to see the mercies and the grace of god almost every church i know of has been hit in terrible ways people dying and yet god has kept this little fellowship i'm not saying the devil don't come try us but you know when goliath comes david does too yeah so we thank god for the victory that we have seen uh in in this fellowship never forget people it's not because you've been so good it's just the mercy and the grace of god that the lord has kept us in this day and time and so as we stand we're just going to go right into the word of god we're so glad to see our brother mike we i think i text you i know i did i can't remember when the last i did but anyway glad to see you we missed you around here man we really missed you and so good good good good to see you some things that we are now facing and uh i think a lot of times we overlook some of the smaller things that goes on in our life and we understand one thing that those who make a rapture will be those who have conquered self and now they possess divine love because remember your greatest enemy is not the devil your greatest enemy is you but we're going to read from first corinthians the 12th chapter from there we'll go to romans the 8th and then of course to that famous scripture that we all are familiar with first corinthians 13. we'll try our best to keep it short but you know when it comes to uh we see the world falling apart i i listen to the message falling apart and birth pains and things of that nature the prophet of god is just literally laying it out as though he was here and you know one of the things that really caught my attention was that he said had he not known what the scriptures were foretelling of this age he said it would have been a strange thing and he said in this age love will be a strange thing because we're living right now in a time where people hate each other there's no middle ground they hate each other and don't even know why they hate each other but the bible says in the last days the kingdoms will be against kingdom and family against family and you know we're seeing it right now unfolding in our eyes i heard a man saying i'll let you sit down in just a moment i was looking to youtube and there was a a conversation going on i can't remember the name man's name but one fellow he called jonathan kahn he called jonathan khan a doomsday prophet and said well i don't even believe any of it and the other guy says well you know i don't believe it either and uh so if you know if they don't believe their own profit they're not going to believe ours but the point is i remember a little story when i was a little boy reading in in elementary and it was the little boy that cried woof and he would cry wolf and have all of these villagers come out with their hoes and their rakes and and everything and then they find out that the wolf wasn't there but one day the wolf showed up and when the boy was crying out for help nobody in the village would go to help him because they thought it was another prank it worked against him but the wolf did show up and like i tried to tell people i said you can say whatever you want to say you don't have to believe it but that's not going to stop what's coming our way and so i want to preach a little message tonight on love simple but powerful first corinthians 12 12-13 for as the body is one and have many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be born or free and haven't been all made to drink into one spirit oh i love that romans 8 26 it says likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself make it into session for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searches the heart knoweth what is in the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love god to them that who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and him whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say to these things if god be for us who can be against us let us pray father god we come before you lord we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us and we pray lord god tonight that you would have free course lord don't let this service uh be one that is common but i pray that somehow the word oh god uh prick the hearts stir up the hearts whether i speak in a calm voice or whether or not i shout doesn't change the word the word is powerful of itself and i pray lord god tonight that you would help each and every one of us see the day and time that we're living in and father i pray that you will set all of our hearts on fire that after this service oh god we'll set our face like a flint we'll move forward oh god that we may be anointed with the anointing of this hour that the message will be on display we ask these things in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated and like i said i try my best not to be long but i i want to just throw out a few things because you know a lot of times people come to the church and we all are guilty sometimes they miss and we don't know where they are and some of us don't even care where they are and i'm not throwing off on anybody but you know we we're too into ourselves the body is something that must work together and everybody's sickness failures uh whatever the case may be the body should be able to feel the feelings of each infirmities and so i was thinking about that because what made me uh go this way is because our sister uh um diamond uh was very sick and um was going about two months and and of course my business i missed her but yet and still didn't miss her enough naomi she gave me the word but we know it's more yo amen but nevertheless we we we we fail to see and and truth of the matter is if we don't unite together and and be one body then what where is this love because we're not talking about affiliate love we're talking about agape love and when god gives a person whether it be male or female agape love it it's not not something you've got to work at it's something that is now hearing the message divine love and sovereign grace brother brown said when divine love has been projected and come to his end is destination sovereign grace will then take over now you say well what does that mean to me what does it mean to us remember when the word of god came to the prophet and says because you have chosen the narrow way this is the victory of love divine so you say what do you mean it is the harder way it is a way that god has ordained for us to travel i was telling brother troy i said i think it was troy and and brother i said now i realize what god was saying when he said fear not little flock because the world is so in in such a chaotic state you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow a lot of people don't want to believe like uh i heard the man say well i don't believe they've been preaching doomsday uh as long as i know but that doesn't say nothing noah preached 120 years doomsday and it came i mean it's evident it showed up it showed up at a time when people least expected it and that's the way god always worked right amen so you got to understand that we're living in a time where the hatred right the power of hatred and the power of love has met together darkness and light and you and i have got to be the light let me tell you something you cannot love people with the filial love that this this trial will go beyond that and so you and i must understand amen somehow we better get with god only divine love makes a rapture hello being a church member doesn't do it being born around the message or knowing all the quotes and knowing all the places the prophet went does not guarantee you a rapture you and i must come into divine love and understand it is a birth hello it ain't something that's just gonna drop on you lord just give me divine love you gotta work you gotta die amen have you ever seen an animal hit by a car and that animal is jumping everywhere and he's just squirming what is he doing he's fighting for life he doesn't want to die he's fighting for life and that's the kind of thing we must understand we must fight for life now we look at this and you say well what do you mean love is the conquering force there is nothing that can conquer divine love absolutely nothing no demons no no devils nothing hell can present can lit can can jesus showed us that you know jesus himself went down into the lower region and he fought the devil on his own grounds hallelujah he said well i ain't got to forgive yes you do if you're going to make heaven you got to forgive well i i don't know man they don't did me wrong every time i see where the devil tried to justify a sin i said oh my god you and i have no idea the kind of love it took for jesus to conquer the devil huh he conquered satan in a way that none of us could have done it think about the beatings and the the speeding and you know you can't even step on some people's toes without them getting an attitude but see that ain't god and that has to die right this may sound like a simple message but it really is we must have love the prophet god said if i had uh uh uh if i had the opportunity to have any gift he said lord take all the gifts and let me have love for no matter how many gifts we got they will never do us any good except the love of god is the motivating motive behind the gift he said we must have love that all right understand we're one body we're supposed to take care of each other right oh it's the truth you know you're supposed to be what's mine and mine's supposed to be with your what's yours you say ain't no way well that's how the church started out they saw everything that everybody would have things in common nowadays it ain't so and i don't think we'll ever come to that but the nevertheless that's the way it started out you know i can remember when i was a little boy the neighbors were like brothers and sisters when my mama prepared food everybody was welcome nowadays you gotta be invited and don't come and stand on the porch like you're hungry like you're gonna uh-uh it ain't happening that's the way it is now i don't know and i can't say that's with everybody but when it comes to this church and this is what i've been really praying i've been praying and fasting i was been somewhat weak today because of it and yeah so anyway uh just for us not just for brother brooks for us that god would would literally give us a revelation of what this divine love is not just give us a revelation of it but feel us with it like the scripture we want to drink into that spirit we want god and and when i say that i mean we've got to we've got to just let go and let god have his way hallelujah because sometimes we do have infirmities and like the scripture says you know our infirmities everybody have has them and you know when it comes to knowing how to pray how many of y'all know how to pray all the time no don't even go there because you don't until the lord revealed to you what is needed that is the only way you know how to pray it all is all it always will be a revelation on how to pray and what to pray for now i don't know about you but i can see the tidal waves i see the thing coming our way you ought to be able to see this is not a time to be lukewarm and lazy and dilatory in the last few days i've been just confessing and asking god to forgive me for not being the kind of christians that i i should be or the kind that he's requiring me to be you say you brother books absolutely i can see where i've let him down many times allowing worldly things to get involved and hello y'all understand what i'm trying to say there is no time for that it really is no time for that somehow we've got to girdle up the lawns of our mind and recognize this is the time was that right and all i could hear this morning and today not all but the bride has made herself ready y'all want god to do it all no the bride has made herself ready huh this is a love affair we we look at peter and paul and john and all those ones who became martyrs for jesus christ but those people loved god even to the death hallelujah they weren't concerned about how they live and how great they were and what kind of mansion they had and most of those people all they had was sheepskin and caves but they were happy they had a joy you understand me hallelujah that's where brother man was he was a poor man but he had a joy he met the pill of fire and that was his joy he could care less on the you know whether his suit was matching or not when i thought i might as well be comfortable tonight it doesn't matter we're getting ready and the truth of the matter is it's not going to be easy now i read some things and i don't know how true they are but i do know one thing there's going to be a lot of pressure put on you amen when it comes to this vaccine that is something that you have to work out within yourself you know what i'm saying right we're not going to go any further with that i just say it's something that you have to work out if you felt feel led to take it take it but better understand whatever you turn into is your own fault don't blame the doctor cause you gave him your consent y'all know that thing ain't ready for nothing it's the truth and i'm not trying to be funny but it's the truth people have been dying from it right so let's move on by the grace of god but you know what you're the ones that seem crazy because you don't believe in science in that way you believe in god we understand that god is our supplier that's what i try to tell people i like science are you serious i know the god that created science not taken away from the hospitals and things amen they have their place but you don't force things on us not the christian remember i told you when i was preaching on samson you're the main event all of these things right now are happening to push the bride in her position amen absolutely and you say well what's wrong with i'm there's a part of me that's happy there's a part of me that stands secure but i can't wait to that anointing anoint the words that's in me and make it live is that right that's that's it it takes the anointing to anoint that's why we've been studying the word that's why we've been listening to the tapes that's why we've been reading our word so that when that time come the anointing of god will anoint everything in us it'll be god in you right what shall we say and i'm i want to encourage you what shall we say to these things if god be for you who can be against you people of god don't you understand no one can be against you and prevail hallelujah isaiah said what weapon that's formed against us shall prosper nothing amen amen understand the shock is not the mark of the beast okay a lot of people think it's democracy that ain't it is when you reject the word of god for your day but i ain't looking for nothing they're giving out freely y'all know what i'm saying in that in that way hallelujah and the thing that you and i must understand like i said it's going to be really simple but what we need to understand is that we have to examine ourselves how honest have we been not only to god but to ourselves honesty you must have honesty to go any further brother said i can look at you knowing that i will meet you at the day of judgment at the end of the world and say this one thing that the product that i am telling you about jesus christ the son of god lives and reigns tonight and this is the power this is this is what shook me he said and he's just as powerful just as real and just as alive as he ever was at any time y'all understand that we're not dealing with a historical god we need god we we need to contact him you know what i mean we need him so he can reveal to us he never changed when william branham went on he never changed he's still here he's still god he's still doing the same thing he you you got to understand if we're failing it's not because god is making us fail if anything a man ought to be honest god will respect you when you become honest you know and that's the thing like i said you and i when we look at this thing we've got you and i need to say i'm right there with samson i'm a failure all that you tried to get me to do i have failed the world has come in i've done this that and the other i've never listened how when's the last time we witnessed to anybody y'all understand me it shows amen that that's our commission but when we don't talk about it when we don't witness it shows we're backslidden he said well i ain't got nobody to witness to you know how to pray lord send somebody my way right the other day i was from the poured on a guy and he cut me off but i was going after him i was going to let him know that jesus saves now these things we we look at this and we say okay what is the difference see many times i've looked at services and i'm thinking wow you know my definition of being dead is has been totally wrong because you can sit still and not be dead you understand what i'm saying you don't have to jump you don't have to shout you don't have to run up and down the aisle to prove that you're alive because most of the time when people do all of that they're not alive and why you say that because the reason is is that they're looking at the wrong thing thinking that's god when they can do that in the club when they can do that at the ball game and don't tell me they don't feel an anointing oh there is an anointing i can remember being in the ball game and you know they hit a two pawn or three-pointer and i'm up out of my seat before i know it i'm coming to myself feeling stupid but that's the anointing i allowed myself to get into that anointing and people of god let's not let's not we need the anointing the anointing not a anointing the anointing even when the man preached his preaching is a different anointing same god but working in a different office hallelujah but we need that that anointing that shekinah understand me when you got the shekinah that love will enforce itself oh yeah somebody come and eat they got to tell you off and all of that all of a sudden the holy ghost put you there or even if you make a mistake he checks you and you got to confess and make it right that's power that's the holy ghost it's just that simple and hearing that still small voice i was going to i talked with brother works yesterday and i said you know i think i'm going to come out to uh to uh harmony in the desert i just found out they're gonna have it and this morning when i woke up the holy ghost says don't go so i'm not going so tomorrow i've got to call him and let him know i'm not coming not that i'm afraid of anything but he told me not to go so that's all that uh that's besides i don't know no new songs anyway you know it's just what it is and i won't stop anybody else from going but my point is this it's not time the time is now to examine yourself to see whether you be in the faith singing you can sing all you want dancing all you want but that's not it we've had that for hundreds of years pentecostals and all had all of that i was looking at a youtube thing the other day and i couldn't in 1980 and they were getting down and supposed to be singing about jesus and i thought to myself that's 1980. i don't even know what they're doing now what are they doing it's a state of apostasy they feel that anointing and they fail to see you can't do what you do in the club in the church no two different anointings i don't care how much you call on the name of jesus that don't sanctify what you're doing anyway i don't know how i stumbled i wasn't even looking for it but curiosity though i speak with tongues and of men and of angels and have not charity an old message paul preached this over a thousand years ago an old message and it's still holding fast today right it god don't care if i am become as a and brass or tinkling simmer and though i have the gift of prophet prophecy and understand all mysteries and and all knowledge and and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing now let me ask you a question do you really think god don't mean what he's saying he means exactly what he's saying you can be a superman in the religious realm and you still don't have love it profits you nothing i don't want to come up short i don't care what it takes where god's got to take me to get there i don't care about the pain i don't care about the sorrow i don't care about nothing right now but pleasing my lord and that might not sound right to you but i know i mean you know i'll be 65 this month that's closer that's getting pretty close to 70. 7-0 right that's pretty close that's all he promised me five more years brother brooks you just never know so i've got to do excuse me i've got to do what i need to do in this little space and time whatever god can help me with and give me i want it all y'all understand me i'm tired of competition i'm tired of people trying to put me in this and put me on that and try to determine what is and what is not i don't care about that stuff right now i really i got my eyes on jesus i'm focusing on him now i'm looking at him so that i won't be sinking in this storm i'm focusing on him this is what we must do and yes it is difficult huh because many of us have habits that we've got to give up i'm not exempt things we know we got to give up hallelujah and we say oh god you know the lord showed me something the other day say when i was preaching i said you don't need the holy ghost to overcome certain things you just need willpower you just need to stop that's true people say well you know he he he smokes and he needs the holy ghost hello there's a lot of people who smoke or did smoke and stopped yeah i had a brother who had been an alcoholic all his life he stopped now i don't understand it but i know when you get in your mind to do something like that it just happens and i call that faith that you didn't even know you had amen hallelujah yes and when god talked to me that about that the other lady guess what he made me an overcomer you don't know what i was going through but he made me an overcomer i feel the difference i see the difference only because i decided enough is enough now if you love god you got to put god first you got to talk to the devil like you really are in love with god right because that's when the devil talk that's when the devil hear you when you put god first he has to heal you and though i restore all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profits will be nothing charity suffered that long charity suffereth long and it's kind charity envy is not charity violence that itself is not puffed up ain't no bishop hallelujah real no that ain't charity and the closer man get to god the more humble he becomes hallelujah yes we get too carried away with in this message what people think of us i don't care anymore i knew god before i came here hello that's the reason why i'm here do you think i would ever come up to des moines on my own ain't no way excuse me for saying it like that but that i came because i was led by god god led me here because others were praying and through their prayers god led me here and i that's why i have confidence it doesn't matter i was telling the lord i said lord even if it go down to two or three i still know you brought me here one thing about love it trusts charity never faileth but what whether there be prophecy it shall fail whether there'll be tongues they shall cease and we know that right because all of those prophets on television or you youtube whatever you know they prophesied trump was going to get it trump was going to get it and then they had to come back and correct things now i still don't know what's going to happen i just know by god's grace everything looking good for the for the one world order to come into play and when that come into play it's going home time hallelujah i'm not ashamed of the gospel of christ it is the power of god unto salvation our message is different we have eyes to see the world can't see they're in darkness gross darkness hallelujah is that right brother branham said in this age that love would be such a strange thing did you know that oh it's true you can go shake a brother hand and hug him around the neck and then somebody look at you and thank you strange sisters too they'd rather think carnally that you've got something going on hello i'm talking about so-called believe us what he said what do you mean paul said greet your brother with a kiss that's that's on the neck now anyplace else is wrong right but even so we don't do that but i know one brother always catches me off guard aaron mcgarry and i hope he hears this you think i'll be used to it there's another brother from india that used to catch me all the time but aaron had a way of sneaking it on me yeah i'm telling you and i would just feel this rush like right there's nothing wrong with it there are other brothers who've done it that is all right it's okay as long as you're in the right spirit but and that's the love of god it's it's a strange thing when you tell a brother i love you brothers and now they can't handle that and you're supposed to tell each other you love each other and they look at you like what in the world you got going on there right and there's nothing you pure in your heart but it's such a strange thing for a man to love another man and be straight or a woman with a woman this is the day we're living in everything is perverted and i'm not going to go any further with that but that's what love has done it's come down to the lowest the lowest the lowest the lowest and god in this day is requiring us to go up to the highest divine love is the highest you can go and i'm i'm gonna close in just a bit but remember brother brandon preached desperation right after the seals and he said if the people don't get desperate they're going to miss it and how many of us are desperate say brother books i'm not desperate i don't know how to be desperate you can always pray for it but understand when you pray for it tribulations work with patience it's coming but god will put you in a desperate position amen so that you can cross over it's all about crossing over going beyond the veil that's what it is that's why god opened the seals that's why we know the things we know but we're not here to stand in the outer court or the inner court we're supposed to go into the holies of holies and not just temporarily going in near the visit we suppose brothers say go in there and shut the curtain behind you we're supposed to that's our dwelling place i'm praying i want it all books are you there yet by faith but i want to see it i want to see that anointing i want to see that life i want to see all of that i want to see it that's what he promised us and people of god we better get desperate we better ask god help us lord because one day we don't know when the door is going to shut right it's going to shut how many of y'all know that noah preached 120 years and when the doors shut nobody else could go in and there were times that even the prophet of god didn't even know whether the door was shut or not he said could it be is it has the last one coming in yet and that's in the 60s what about now when we who are in the message claim that we've got so much and all we've got is a system people don't like me saying that but i hate systems i see systems i'm not a part of that i'm breaking away from all of that just to find my lord just to know who he is so that he can know he knows me but i need to know who he is right when you think about all of those saints of god amen i had had some other things but when we think about supreme sovereign grace we must understand by god's grace that this sovereign grace is god you don't deserve it he chose you you didn't choose him and when it comes to your trials and difficulties and things you think god don't understand we often say god won't put us on us no more than we can bear and that's true god will never put on us uh more than we can bear and in in fact the fact of the matter is when it gets to the place that you can't bear it that's when you're supposed to cast your cares upon him he cares for you like the prophet said he cares do you care and that's the thing we must all care i i know this message is right i know it's 100 right and like the prophet god said if i if i can't obtain it i'm not going to stand in nobody else's way but it's my goal amen to see that pill of fire living in me hallelujah and folks we one thing i know is that the pressure is going to stir us up i was telling somebody today window when all these people who thought they weren't believers began to see this thing for unfolding the way we've been trying to tell them it's going to unfold it's going to get their attention and i just trust by the grace of god it's not too late that's the thing you love the lord we need to love one another when we see somebody missing or somebody's not here we need to inquire and that is not just the pastor's job it's everybody's job and my wife brought up a subject a thing that we need a phone list again we do we used to have a phone list you know where people had their names and addresses and whatever the case may be i love to have that again so that if somebody is missing i'll have the number where we could call and listen a call nowadays don't cost you nothing when i was when i was coming up it was a nickel dime quarter it costs you nothing now and i know you said well brother books what are you trying to say listen i don't care how much thunder you think you know how you know the seven seals you know oh lord you know all the mysteries of the old testament of redemption it'll do you no good until you're capped off with the love of god and i hope i've got a lot of people listening to me tonight it's simple but it's true it's real and we're getting ready to face a battle and the only force that's going to conquer this is love y'all understand me when they came at peter them to to to to destroy what happened peter got his sword and tried to cut the man's ear off and jesus said if you fight with the sword you're going to die with the sword but what did jesus do he humbled himself like a lamb hallelujah oh i got my rifle brother when they come yeah fight with that and you're gonna die with that right our love is the conquering element it is the force that god has ordained us to have to conquer the devil right and remember that quote he said jesus defeated the devil with meekness and sweetness that's uh brethren sweetness meekness yeah you love the lord i know it's simple but let's stand are we understanding can we see what god is requiring yeah i was talking the other day brother keith i might have been yesterday today and he mentioned love and had no idea that i was working in that area because i realized now that as a church we've been focusing on so many things and those things are not what we need it's good to know but without the holy ghost without the capstone but what good is it i tell you what i do not want to be left behind seriously i do not want to be left behind i can't imagine that i don't believe that's my destiny lord has been good to me has shown me things have been you know i just know i just believe with all my heart that i'm bright even though i'm not where i should be that anointing in me is carrying me it's taking me now and like i said once you come to a place in your life where you say i'm done i'm done with this stuff the world religion all of that i'm just lord i want you however you reveal yourself to me show me so that we can have an intimate relationship together not some church go up you know god show up every now and again we shout dance run out you know all that's good but that ain't it we've had all of that for years and the brother the prophet god said this is why the seals were open so that we could have that intimate relationship with uh behind me father we come before you as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace we thank you for your goodness lord we realize lord without love hallelujah we're failures it's not something that we can produce we're not talking about video love because we fail we need a perfect love we need that agape we need you to come into our lives lord and make the difference it doesn't matter lord what it takes to get us there please remember me that's what samson said lord remember me oh lord oh lord once once more
