[0:01] As we said last
[0:03] week, light can never be defeated. Amen.
[0:08] Because God is light. As we stand, let
[0:13] us turn to the scriptures according
[0:15] to Genesis
[0:19] 4. You love the Lord.
[0:25] Genesis
[0:27] 4
[0:33] 3-7. We want to praise God for the
[0:37] testimonies and things that have gone up
[0:39] before the Lord. Thank you,
[0:41] brother. Knowing that Jesus Christ is
[0:43] the same
[0:45] yesterday, today, and
[0:47] forever. God said, "These signs shall
[0:50] follow them that believe."
[0:53] That's not preacher only. that every
[0:55] believer sign should be following them.
[0:59] It is surely a token of the
[1:01] resurrection.
[1:03] Amen. You love God. Genesis 4
[1:09] 3-7. And in process of time it came to
[1:14] pass that Cain brought of the fruit of
[1:18] the ground an offering unto the Lord.
[1:22] And Abel, he also brought of the
[1:25] firstling of his flock, and of the fat
[1:28] thereof. And the Lord had respect unto
[1:31] Abel and to his
[1:33] offering. Amen. Would like to turn to
[1:35] Hebrews, please.
[1:40] 11:4. Hebrews 11:4.
[1:46] It reads, "By faith Abel offered unto
[1:49] God a more excellent
[1:52] sacrifice than Cain, by which he
[1:55] obtained witness that he was
[1:58] righteous. God testifying of his gifts,
[2:03] and by it being dead, yet speaketh."
[2:09] If you notice, by the grace of God, the
[2:11] next verse was or is by faith Enoch was
[2:15] translated. Amen. Those things in the
[2:18] word of God are not just put there to be
[2:20] placed
[2:21] randomly, but God places everything in
[2:24] its proper order. And hopefully to this
[2:28] morning, we'll be able to minister the
[2:31] word of God so much so that you'll be
[2:33] blessed. Amen. You pull on the gift and
[2:36] I'm sure God will bless you in a special
[2:38] way. Amen. Let us pray. Father God, we
[2:42] come before you, Lord, as humbly as we
[2:44] know. We thank you once again for being
[2:47] so good to us. And we pray, Father, that
[2:51] you just have free course here this
[2:54] morning, Lord. You know, there's not one
[2:56] thing I could do, oh God, to help your
[2:59] people. But I'm here, Lord God, so that
[3:02] you will may be able to use my lips and
[3:05] speak to your people, to their hearts.
[3:08] Forgive us and cleanse us from all
[3:09] unrighteousness, Lord. And we pray that
[3:12] your perfect and divine will be done
[3:13] here this morning. In Jesus Christ's
[3:16] name we pray. Amen. You may be seated.
[3:20] We said unto you Wednesday, we were
[3:21] going to preach on the power of the
[3:23] blood.
[3:24] You know, I really believe by the grace
[3:26] of God that a lot of time we don't know
[3:28] how good we have it. We sing about the
[3:32] blood, the blood
[3:34] prevail, victory in Jesus, all these
[3:37] great hymns that we
[3:39] sing. And you must realize that the only
[3:42] reason we can sing these songs is
[3:45] because what took place on Calvary about
[3:48] 2,000 years ago.
[3:51] We look at this thing and we wonder how
[3:54] can God do such a thing. And I often
[3:56] think to
[3:58] myself, how on earth God came up with
[4:01] the
[4:03] thought, the
[4:05] shedding of blood of the of an innocent
[4:08] lamb to restore
[4:11] mankind. You know, uh I I don't know how
[4:13] he came to that that thought, but I'm
[4:18] glad he did.
[4:21] We find out by the grace of God that
[4:22] through history, if you look at all of
[4:25] the tribal people from all over the
[4:27] world, somehow they knew there was
[4:29] something about
[4:30] blood. If it was human sacrifice, animal
[4:34] h or or or animal sacrifice, whatever it
[4:37] was, it it was something about blood
[4:39] that somehow fascinated
[4:42] man. And I you and I can always take it
[4:46] back to the Garden of Eden because
[4:48] that's where it all
[4:51] started at least in this
[4:54] dimension. The Bible tells us according
[4:56] to Genesis 9:4 that it is life that is
[5:00] in the blood. Amen. The scripture tells
[5:03] us, "But the flesh with the life
[5:05] thereof, which is the blood thereof
[5:07] shall ye not eat." So it was forbidden,
[5:10] amen, for mankind to eat blood because
[5:14] it was uh uh uh uh basically against the
[5:18] law of God. There was a purpose that God
[5:21] wanted this blood for and it was not for
[5:24] us to be eaten.
[5:27] Now we look at this thing and we
[5:30] understand and I don't care how much you
[5:33] say you are a
[5:35] Christian. Let me say it like this.
[5:37] There are many people that who who claim
[5:39] to be Christians but yet they are not
[5:43] under the blood.
[5:46] They are usually under some umbrella of
[5:48] a denomination or
[5:51] organization. And you and I must realize
[5:54] that God in this last day used to wink
[5:56] at
[5:58] ignorance. He doesn't anymore
[6:01] because God has revealed himself in this
[6:04] last day. We must recognize, Amen, that
[6:07] what God what took place in in in in
[6:10] Egypt, just excuse me, in in the Garden
[6:12] of Eden
[6:14] alone, we find out that after Adam and
[6:16] Eve
[6:17] sinned, they tried to hide
[6:20] themselves and the Bible tell they us
[6:23] that they sold uh fig leaves around
[6:26] themselves. Hello.
[6:28] But that was not suitable for God
[6:32] because God had in his own mind
[6:35] something different.
[6:37] He knew they were going to fall. You
[6:39] know, he didn't say, "Oops, I I didn't
[6:40] realize this was going to happen." But
[6:43] because we realize
[6:45] God slew a lamb
[6:48] before the foundation of the world.
[6:52] So God knew that Adam and Eve would fall
[6:54] and he had a solution for the problem.
[6:59] But man, we always like this. We always
[7:01] want to put something to it. And I hope
[7:03] by the grace of God, I'll be able to
[7:05] preach the word grace to you this
[7:07] morning. That so much so it will set you
[7:09] free.
[7:12] Because we realize that's what Adam and
[7:14] Eve did. They first thought that they
[7:17] could help restore themselves
[7:20] by veiling themselves with fig leaves.
[7:23] And those fig leaves were not, as I
[7:25] said, suitable for God. Let me put it in
[7:28] our modern term. Your religion,
[7:31] I don't care if you faithful in going to
[7:33] church, faithful in paying ti, faithful
[7:35] in worship, whatever, your religion is
[7:38] in vain if you're not under the blood.
[7:42] There's only one place of worship, one
[7:45] place to find God, and that is under the
[7:48] shed blood of his dear son. Now, I'm
[7:50] trying not to go so
[7:52] fast, but I want you to realize by the
[7:55] grace of God, there will be a many
[7:57] people come up short in this last day
[7:59] because they think they are under the
[8:03] blood. By the grace of God, I hope I can
[8:06] explain this. Romans 3:25, we have faith
[8:10] in his blood. Romans 5:9, we are
[8:12] justified by his blood. Romans 11:25, we
[8:16] have a covenant in his blood.
[8:18] Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. And I
[8:21] like this. St. John 3:16, there's love
[8:24] in the blood.
[8:28] Hallelujah. So, you and I must
[8:31] understand in that what God was doing in
[8:33] the Garden of Eden, he was he the Bible
[8:35] said he slew a little animal and he
[8:38] wrapped Adam and Eve. It covered what?
[8:40] their nakedness. So in other words, your
[8:43] religion is not a covering that God will
[8:46] accept. It is only the bloody bleeding
[8:50] word of God you can cover yourself with
[8:53] and be accepted by God. Now I I'm I'm
[8:57] explain in a in a minute. Now we look in
[9:01] the Bible and you and I must realize
[9:03] that we've got it so good. We've got it
[9:04] so easy. There's no reason why any of us
[9:07] in here this morning should be lost.
[9:09] Amen. I mean, we're not like the Jews.
[9:11] We've got to sacrifice millions of
[9:14] animals. Come on, somebody. And most of
[9:16] us perhaps could would not have been
[9:18] able to
[9:19] afford the
[9:21] animals that we would have need to
[9:23] sacrifice. Uh well, let me put it this
[9:26] way. I would not have been able to
[9:28] afford it because I need forgiveness all
[9:30] the time.
[9:34] Hallelujah. And listen, people, the they
[9:36] were in bondage.
[9:39] They had to wait a certain time for this
[9:42] animal to be sacrificed and this to be
[9:44] sacrificed. They had to wait in line.
[9:46] Think about it. Conscious eating them
[9:48] all up. Amen. And there's no way they
[9:50] could get a relief from their conscience
[9:52] because there's somebody's ahead of them
[9:54] and they can't say just God forgive
[9:58] me. But they faithfully did it year
[10:01] after year after year after year. Amen.
[10:04] They faithfully uh sacrificed those
[10:06] animals unto God. And it was just a
[10:08] covering.
[10:11] God could still see the bump in the rug.
[10:16] It was just a covering. God could still
[10:19] see the bump in the rug. Why? Because
[10:21] the blood of animals and bulls and goats
[10:23] could not remit your sin.
[10:27] It couldn't get up get rid of it. All it
[10:29] could do was cover it. We needed a real
[10:32] lamb.
[10:34] We needed something. Amen. that not only
[10:36] would remmit our sin, but get rid of it
[10:39] as though we had never sinned in the
[10:41] first place.
[10:45] This was a a great task that God had to
[10:49] do because the Bible tells us no man was
[10:52] worthy. The Bible says that all had
[10:54] sinned and come short of the glory of
[10:56] God. Is that all right? Maybe you
[10:59] thought you was righteous enough to make
[11:00] it. But I tell you what, I I think
[11:03] sometime how holy God is, I'm ashamed of
[11:06] myself even now. Hallelujah. Amen. If it
[11:10] wasn't for the blood of Jesus Christ,
[11:12] where would I appear in his
[11:15] presence? Now, we look at this thing and
[11:17] you say, "Well, brother Brooks, uh, you
[11:19] know, you you you got to realize that I
[11:20] don't care how great Moses, Joshua,
[11:22] Caleb, and all the rest of them were."
[11:24] Amen. They were not qualified
[11:28] to take away your
[11:31] sins. They were
[11:33] lambs, but they had spots,
[11:37] blemishes, failures. Hallelujah. Guess
[11:41] what? You and I were born failures.
[11:44] So don't be disappointed. It is what it
[11:47] is. You're born a failure. And there's
[11:51] only one way of becoming victorious and
[11:54] that is in Jesus Christ.
[11:56] Now, let me move on by the grace of God.
[11:59] We rise by the grace of God according to
[12:02] Hebrews 9. And I'm going to read this
[12:04] because I'm I'm going have to jump.
[12:06] There's no way that I can just give you
[12:08] this this this this to draw the full
[12:09] picture. And I trust that somehow God
[12:11] will help you out. We realize, Amen. As
[12:14] I said, they were all about rituals.
[12:18] Isn't that funny? Because that's how a
[12:20] lot of churches are today. They're all
[12:22] about rituals, the outward appearance.
[12:25] Jesus even told the Pharisees and said,
[12:27] "You look like, you know, uh, why is
[12:29] supper because you look good on the
[12:31] outside, but the inside, he said, you're
[12:33] like dead men bones."
[12:36] And what what good is it to have
[12:37] religion and with no joy? What good is
[12:40] to have religion with no peace? What
[12:42] good is to have religion, Amen, without
[12:45] it resting your soul?
[12:49] Hebrews 9 beginning at the 8th verse,
[12:52] excuse me, the Holy Ghost signifying the
[12:55] way of the holiest of all was not yet
[12:58] made manifest while as the first
[13:01] tabernacle was yet standing. Now
[13:03] realize, amen, he's working with the
[13:05] Mosaic tabernacle, the tabernacle that
[13:07] Moses built and all of that. And we
[13:09] realize that Moses, amen, saw this by
[13:13] design, not his, God's design. He only
[13:18] built it according to the pattern in
[13:19] which God has shown him. There was a
[13:21] outer court, there was an inner court,
[13:23] and there was a holies of holies. You
[13:25] see what I'm saying? Y'all heard this
[13:27] before. The outer court is when the sun
[13:29] shine. And that's how Christians are. As
[13:32] long as the sun's shining, they're
[13:33] happy. Cloudy days, they're sad. Thunder
[13:36] and lightning, they're fussing and
[13:37] fighting.
[13:41] Right. Amen. But the inner court, Amen,
[13:44] is in the candlestick light. uh uh
[13:45] light, right? You got the seven messages
[13:48] starting from Paul all the way up to the
[13:50] Malachi 4, William Brandom of our day.
[13:52] Hello.
[13:54] But when those light goes
[13:56] out, come on. Cuz we know they go out
[13:59] because in some people's lives today,
[14:02] that last candlestick has gone out.
[14:06] They can't even see their way anymore.
[14:07] Oh, come on, somebody. It gets smoky in
[14:10] the place. Come on. And that was the age
[14:14] when God called us according to Matthew
[14:16] 10. Is that right? A voice cried out,
[14:21] right? Amen. Call in 10 versions. Trim
[14:25] your lamps. Get away. Get away from all
[14:28] of the the junk of the world. Trim your
[14:31] lamps. Amen. So that you can see your
[14:33] way.
[14:35] Now we we realize that. So what
[14:38] happened? Where were we going from that
[14:40] from that inner court? We were leaving
[14:42] from the inner court going somewhere.
[14:44] God wasn't just leading to telling us to
[14:47] to to to come in something. What we were
[14:49] going into, we had to come out of
[14:51] something to go into something, right?
[14:53] We went somewhere. The wise foolish
[14:55] virgins went somewhere that the foolish
[14:59] virgins could couldn't go. The wise
[15:01] virgin went somewhere that the foolish
[15:03] virgins couldn't go. Why? Because the
[15:07] foolish virgins were datory.
[15:10] Come on. That Yes. Hallelujah.
[15:12] Procrastinators.
[15:14] Amen. But the wise virgins were
[15:16] diligent.
[15:18] Where did they go? The Bible said they
[15:20] went in a door.
[15:22] Hallelujah. They went into a door. And
[15:25] you say, "Well, what door did they go
[15:27] into?" They went into Jesus Christ. Cuz
[15:30] he said, "I am the door. I am the way. I
[15:34] am the truth. I am the life. So where
[15:37] did they go? They went into the door
[15:39] that the foolish version said they had
[15:41] gone into.
[15:45] And the Bible said they were shut
[15:47] outside the door. That means Jesus in
[15:51] this age according to Revelations 3 was
[15:53] knocking at the door. He was at He was
[15:55] the door but he was knocking at the door
[15:57] of your heart. Right? But it switches
[16:00] now. Now he wants you to knock at his
[16:03] door. Amen.
[16:05] Is that right? Because the foolish
[16:07] version came knocking but they couldn't
[16:09] get in. How do you knock on Jesus door?
[16:13] Lord have mercy. Here I am, Jesus. God,
[16:17] let me in. H. Y'all know what I'm
[16:20] talking about. I'm working with prayer.
[16:26] I've jumped all over my notes, but by
[16:29] the grace of God, let me read. The Holy
[16:31] Ghost signifying the way into the holies
[16:34] of all was not yet made manifest while
[16:37] at the first tabernacle was yet
[16:40] standing, which was a figure for the
[16:42] time then present, in which were offered
[16:45] both gifts and sacrifice that could not
[16:48] make him that did the service perfect as
[16:51] pertaining to the conscience. In other
[16:53] words, think about it people of God.
[16:56] They sacrificed all those animals and
[16:59] they left there feeling just as guilty
[17:01] as they were when they went there. There
[17:04] was nothing to appease. There was
[17:05] nothing to satisfy the guilt.
[17:11] Hallelujah. Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[17:14] There was nothing. Can you imagine going
[17:16] through those rituals all the time and
[17:18] yet stilling guilty in your conscience,
[17:23] not being able to determine what was
[17:25] right, what was wrong. Oh Lord, what a
[17:28] miserable place to
[17:30] be. But Christ being come,
[17:35] listen and let let me read it. says,
[17:37] "Which stood only in meats and drinks
[17:39] and divers washing and carnal or
[17:41] ordinances imposed on them until the
[17:44] time of re reformation imposed on
[17:47] them." imposed on them. Come on,
[17:51] somebody. You got to do this. You must
[17:54] do this. This is the law. If you break
[17:56] it, you're going to
[17:59] jail. You don't do it, you die.
[18:04] But Christ being come a high priest of
[18:06] good things to come by a greater and
[18:08] more perfect tabernacle, not made with
[18:11] hands, that is to say, not of this
[18:15] building, neither by the blood of goats
[18:17] and calves, but by his own blood he
[18:20] entered in once into the holy place,
[18:24] having obtained eternal redemption for
[18:26] us.
[18:28] Is that right? You say, "Well, what do
[18:30] you mean, brother? There was a lamb.
[18:32] There was a blood. There was amen. A a a
[18:36] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[18:36] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[18:37] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[18:37] a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
[18:37] s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s
[18:37] s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s
[18:37] situ h uh how God could bring a
[18:40] solution, amen, to us this morning. Now
[18:43] I'm working with something. I haven't
[18:46] even got to where I want to go, but as I
[18:49] said, no man was
[18:52] worthy. No
[18:55] man was worthy. And just to think, Amen.
[18:59] The Jews had done all of these things
[19:02] throughout
[19:04] history and yet their sins remain. You
[19:08] say, "Well, where you get that scripture
[19:10] from?" Jesus said unto those Pharisees,
[19:12] "Except you believe that I am he, you
[19:16] should likewise die in your sins."
[19:19] Why? Because he was the true
[19:21] perpetuation. He was the true lamb of
[19:24] God. He was the only one that could
[19:27] remit their sins.
[19:30] vanquish them as though they never been
[19:34] before. Right?
[19:36] See, now listen. He says, "Now we we go
[19:39] on and we say, well, well, brother, uh,
[19:42] what was this all about? You and I ought
[19:44] to be so happy."
[19:46] Christians are not joyous and they're
[19:48] not as happy as they ought to be. And
[19:50] it's only because they we've allowed the
[19:53] cares of the world and things to choke
[19:54] out the joy of God out of us. We we
[19:57] forgot how free we are. And you know,
[19:59] most of us have forgotten how how once
[20:01] we were in prison, how we were in jailed
[20:04] up within ourselves. Come on, somebody.
[20:06] And nobody knew you like you.
[20:10] Come on. Anybody in here perfect?
[20:14] Oh, y'all answered wrong.
[20:19] Hallelujah. Whether or not you are, I
[20:21] am. Hallelujah. Not by my own doing.
[20:26] If you're not perfect, you won't get to
[20:28] heaven. So, how you going to be perfect?
[20:32] G. Yeah. Come on, somebody. Jesus said,
[20:35] "Be ye perfect as your father in heaven
[20:38] is perfect." Now, if you if you can't
[20:41] There's no faults in
[20:44] heaven. Ah, come on,
[20:46] somebody. No flaws. Everything's
[20:49] perfect. So, how you going to get there
[20:51] if you're not?
[20:53] See, that's why Christians can't have
[20:55] the joy because you see, Satan is
[20:58] constantly showing you your fleshly
[21:00] faults.
[21:02] You'll never be perfect in this flesh
[21:05] until God change it. Amen. That's the
[21:08] redemption of your body. Y'all pulling
[21:11] me in the wrong in the direction I don't
[21:13] want to go right now. But it's true. I
[21:15] mean, you and I must realize that's why
[21:17] we're happy. I sing
[21:20] because I'm happy. You know I sing. Are
[21:24] you free? Because I'm free. His eyes on
[21:29] the spot. What? I'm free
[21:34] from the penalties of sin and death.
[21:40] That's what this day is all about. God
[21:44] didn't rise, Amen, to make another
[21:46] religion.
[21:48] He came to set the captive free. Amen.
[21:52] Is that the word? Amen. Now listen. He
[21:56] says, "How much more?" Now these bulls
[21:58] and goats, they did what they did, the
[22:00] blood. But he says, "How much more shall
[22:02] the blood of Christ who through the
[22:05] eternal spirit There you go." See, it
[22:09] wasn't just the blood. It was the
[22:11] eternal spirit working through the
[22:13] blood.
[22:16] That's what I'm talking about. You say,
[22:17] "Well, I'm under the blood." My question
[22:19] is, do you have the eternal spirit that
[22:22] was in the blood?
[22:24] Hallelujah.
[22:27] Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. You said, "Well,
[22:30] Brother Brooks, you know, I' I've been
[22:32] faithful." And there's a lot of faithful
[22:34] people right there in hell right now.
[22:36] Why? Because they didn't know Jesus
[22:37] Christ as their personal savior. You
[22:40] say, "Well, what? Well, brother, I know
[22:41] him as my savior." But you got to
[22:43] understand, he can't just be your
[22:44] savior. He must be your lord.
[22:48] That means he's telling you what to do.
[22:50] Ain't nobody going to tell me what to
[22:52] do. The Bible will. And if you don't
[22:54] listen to what he says, guess what? You
[22:57] out.
[23:01] Is that true? Somebody's going to be
[23:03] your Lord, whether it be God or the
[23:05] devil.
[23:09] You choose which one you want to be your
[23:10] Lord. Is that all right? Amen. Let's
[23:13] turn to Revelation 5. I got to hurry.
[23:15] Now, we're looking at this thing because
[23:17] nobody's worthy. There's only one lamb.
[23:20] There's only one solution. So, let me
[23:22] say it like this. God don't give you a
[23:24] multiple choice.
[23:28] Huh? You don't have a multiple choice.
[23:31] You don't have more than one answer.
[23:33] That's right.
[23:36] Come on, somebody. You got a right and
[23:39] you got a left. Right. You keep going
[23:42] right. You don't have to worry about
[23:43] going left.
[23:45] Right? You keep going right, you don't
[23:46] have to worry about being left.
[23:51] Hallelujah. Behind. Amen. So you and I
[23:55] must realize by the grace of God. Amen.
[23:57] That God, Amen, has fixed it. As I said,
[24:01] and you've heard, Amen. say this, like
[24:03] the prophet said, nobody goes to hell
[24:05] for drinking and smoking and cursing and
[24:08] lying and stealing and all. That ain't
[24:09] why you go to hell. You go to hell
[24:12] because you would not receive your
[24:14] pardon.
[24:16] You would not accept the sacrifice. You
[24:19] said, "Lord, I I believe in you." And
[24:21] yet you doubt what his word says.
[24:26] See, that's why we go to hell. Our
[24:28] unbelief, not our thoughts. If that be
[24:31] the case, Moses would be there. If that
[24:34] be the case, Joshua would be there. and
[24:36] everybody else that were born onto this
[24:38] woman's world, hallelujah, would be
[24:40] there. But thanks be to God. Hallelujah.
[24:44] God had a solution. And it was his
[24:47] blood. Hallelujah.
[24:50] Hallelujah. But people don't understand
[24:52] this. Well, I don't want no Holy Ghost.
[24:54] You don't want a blood transfusion then.
[24:55] And that's the only way that you can
[24:57] make it. You got to have a blood
[24:59] transfusion.
[25:00] What blood transfusion? His blood
[25:02] transfusion. You've got to get the life
[25:04] of Jesus Christ in you. And the only way
[25:06] it could get into you is if God give you
[25:09] a personal blood transfusion.
[25:13] That's what the Holy Ghost is. It is the
[25:16] life that was in the blood of Jesus
[25:18] Christ.
[25:20] And that's the only blood that is
[25:22] accepted. Amen. Hallelujah. In heaven.
[25:24] Come on. The Bible said no flesh and
[25:26] blood will enter there. But Jesus blood
[25:29] is spirit.
[25:32] Help me somebody. I feel like shouting
[25:34] John this morning. Oh my. Revelations 5
[25:38] says, "And I saw in the right hand of
[25:40] him that sat on the throne a book
[25:42] written within and on the backside
[25:44] sealed with seven seals. And I saw a
[25:46] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[25:48] voice, who is worthy to open the book
[25:50] and to loose the seals thereof? And no
[25:52] man in heaven nor in earth, neither
[25:53] under the earth was able to open the
[25:55] book, neither to look thereon." Come on,
[25:58] somebody. Not Paul, not Aranius. Come
[26:02] on, somebody.
[26:04] Martin, William, Brandon. Come on,
[26:08] somebody. People say, "Well, he opened
[26:10] the seals." No, he didn't. It was God
[26:12] who opened the seals. He was there.
[26:15] Amen. As the seals was open, God needed
[26:17] a visible person. He uses your body, but
[26:21] it was not the man. He said, I didn't
[26:23] even know what he was going to say. I
[26:25] was looking into other books trying to
[26:27] figure it out. and God come by,
[26:29] hallelujah, and open it up to me.
[26:36] Let me tell you something. Even if you
[26:38] understand just a little bit of this
[26:40] book, this book, God gave it to you.
[26:43] Anybody know what I'm talking about? You
[26:45] can read and study this thing all day
[26:46] and not know nothing. God hide himself
[26:49] right there. You won't even be able to
[26:51] see him.
[26:53] But my when he open it up. Hallelujah.
[26:55] You're able to see him from Genesis to
[26:57] Revelation.
[26:59] Hallelujah. Thank God for the lamb of
[27:02] God.
[27:04] Amen. Is that right? He said, "I wept
[27:06] much because no man was found worthy to
[27:08] open the book open and to read the book,
[27:10] neither to look there." You couldn't
[27:12] open it. You couldn't read it. Nor you
[27:14] Listen, it's the truth. Look at all of
[27:16] those men who come before. Amen. They
[27:18] tried to understand that they tried to
[27:19] open it. The only thing they could ever
[27:21] give us like Luther and Wesley was those
[27:23] things that God opened to them.
[27:28] Hello. Because you got to believe, Amen.
[27:31] When Wesley came, they talked about a
[27:32] sanctification. Huh? Amen. Now, we
[27:35] realize the sanctification that God told
[27:37] us about is not because we're
[27:39] sanctifying ourselves. It's God
[27:41] sanctifying us through his Holy Spirit
[27:44] and by his Holy Spirit.
[27:47] Hallelujah. Am I making sense? There's a
[27:52] sanctification, but it's not by human
[27:54] hands.
[27:56] It's by the Holy Ghost and fire that God
[28:01] burns that life that those demons out of
[28:04] all of us. Anybody know what I'm talking
[28:06] about? He burns them. He gets rid of
[28:09] them so much so, Amen. you don't even
[28:11] want to drink or smoke or gamble.
[28:24] Yes, I'm a witness. I used to be hooked
[28:26] on
[28:28] alcohol. God delivered me. Oh, maybe it
[28:33] ain't much to you, but it is to me. I
[28:35] know where I come from. I worked in the
[28:37] club. Come on, somebody.
[28:40] Don't get ashamed. It is what I used to
[28:42] be. Look at me now. Hallelujah. Only God
[28:46] can do this.
[28:52] Hallelujah. Only God can do it.
[28:58] I know what he can
[28:59] do. I'm here to encourage you. Amen.
[29:02] There's power in the blood if you trust
[29:03] him. Let me tell you something. I tell
[29:05] you, that demon came to me that for the
[29:07] last time. He wanted me to go get myself
[29:09] all lit lit up. Amen. He was anointing
[29:11] me. My everything was going on. You
[29:13] know, I was in the house by myself.
[29:15] Amen. Thank God I was because they
[29:17] probably would have called n well with
[29:18] 911 back in then. They they but they
[29:20] could call the patty wagon. Somebody
[29:22] Amen. Hallelujah. I went to screaming.
[29:24] Hallelujah. Jesus. Jesus. Just like
[29:28] that. Probably louder. Lord, don't let
[29:30] me do this. I don't want to do this no
[29:33] more. Hallelujah. I'm tell you, the
[29:34] window was shut. All of a sudden, a wind
[29:36] came
[29:37] through. Hallelujah. Whatever demons was
[29:41] in there, left with the wind.
[29:43] Hallelujah. And I never had a problem
[29:45] with it since. But see, that's how you
[29:47] got to act like a madman sometime to get
[29:50] God's
[29:51] attention. You can't get all
[29:53] sophisticated and uppidity up and Lord
[29:56] like saying a prayer. Don't say no
[29:58] prayer. Pray a prayer. Hallelujah. And
[30:00] when you get in desperation, God will
[30:03] answer your prayer.
[30:05] When you get in desperation, you don't
[30:06] care who look. You get ugly. It's all
[30:08] get out and you don't even care.
[30:14] I know. I remember Simon's sister up
[30:16] there. Amen. And in and in and and
[30:18] Napoleon, her baby was having having
[30:20] seizures and she got in the spirit. I
[30:23] mean, they had the whole tissue. I
[30:26] didn't even know that much fluid can
[30:27] come out of a person's nose. I mean, she
[30:29] was there for hours and didn't even know
[30:32] it. And when God brought up up out of
[30:34] there, God baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[30:36] When God brought her up out of there,
[30:38] not only was she filled with the Holy
[30:39] Ghost, but her child was healed of those
[30:41] seizures.
[30:43] So, you can't tell me she went there for
[30:46] her daughter, but she got a blessing,
[30:47] too.
[30:50] You can't tell me God ain't working. You
[30:52] know, I want the devil to know that. He
[30:53] knows it, but he need to be reminded.
[30:57] Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. Let me
[30:59] move on. And one of the other said unto
[31:00] me, weep not. Behold, the lion of the
[31:02] tribe of Judah, the root of David, had
[31:04] prevailed to open the book, and to loose
[31:06] the seven seals thereof. And I beheld,
[31:08] and lo, in the midst of the throne, and
[31:10] of the four beasts, and in the midst of
[31:12] the elders, stood a lamb, as it had been
[31:14] slain, having seven horns, seven eyes,
[31:16] which are the seven spirits of God sent
[31:19] forth into all the earth. Now, kind of
[31:22] mind men would say, you know what, God
[31:24] ain't a trinity. He's, I would say,
[31:25] seven. He's
[31:27] seven, you know. And he came and took
[31:30] the book out of the right hand of him
[31:32] that sat upon the throne. Now, I want
[31:33] you to realize, amen, that there's
[31:35] nothing wrong with loud
[31:38] worship. Matter of fact, amen. Our
[31:40] prophet tells us that this is the quiet
[31:42] place. The quietest of all three places,
[31:45] heaven, hell, and earth.
[31:47] Right? They loud and carried on in in
[31:50] heaven, and they loud and carried on in
[31:51] hell. Amen. Some of y'all need to go
[31:53] listen to those few minutes in hell
[31:55] again.
[31:57] Hallelujah. Have y'all ever heard about
[31:59] that? That thing that they you can
[32:01] listen when they did that that thing in
[32:02] Russia and they tapped into that
[32:04] dimension and you could hear hell. Come
[32:06] on, somebody. Have you go on YouTube and
[32:08] find it, right? You'll never it'll never
[32:11] leave you. You'll never get over it
[32:13] because it's real.
[32:15] The screams and the hollers, the
[32:17] screaming that comes from that place.
[32:19] Amen. and they accidentally tapped into
[32:22] whatever you think it wasn't God that
[32:24] did
[32:25] that. It's realise.
[32:28] But you know, sometime we allow
[32:30] ourselves to forget what Satan is
[32:33] pulling us into and God's trying to pull
[32:36] us out. Oh, come on, somebody. Now you
[32:40] say, you say, "Well, brother, anyway,
[32:41] let's move on." So, we realize by the
[32:43] grace of God, God comes along and the
[32:45] Bible said nobody was worthy. But
[32:48] listen, that lamb took the book.
[32:52] When you get to heaven, you're not going
[32:54] to I don't care what kind of uh medals
[32:56] you got on the on your shoulders, you'll
[32:58] realize one thing. I'm not worthy to
[33:00] wear it. The Bible said those 24 elders
[33:04] fell on their face. They threw their
[33:06] crowns because they realized that it was
[33:08] only one worthy and that was the lamb.
[33:10] If it wasn't for the lamb, no doubt they
[33:13] could say, "I wouldn't be here."
[33:15] Hallelujah. Amen. If it wasn't for the
[33:18] lamb, I wouldn't be dressed in disarray.
[33:21] Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. Now I
[33:25] listen. The we look at this thing and
[33:27] say, "Well, well, brother, what do we
[33:28] what are you trying to
[33:30] say?" We recognize that all the rituals
[33:34] and ceremonies that the Jews did
[33:36] concerning Jesus Christ, God bottled it
[33:39] all up into one
[33:41] man. Amen. Every ritual, every holiday,
[33:45] every ceremony was in Jesus.
[33:49] Huh? Come on, somebody. It's the truth.
[33:52] It was all in Jesus. And I'm going to
[33:54] tell you something like this. Amen. It
[33:56] doesn't matter how how we think. Oh,
[33:59] well, you know, I I'm not a bad person
[34:01] and I I try to be good and you know, I'm
[34:03] nice to my neighbors and, you know, I
[34:05] feed the poor. The Bible said you can
[34:07] feed the poor. You can have faith to
[34:09] move mountains and have not charity,
[34:13] which is God's love, which is God's Holy
[34:16] Spirit. It profits you nothing. You
[34:19] don't even have a covenant. Oh, let me
[34:22] hurry up because I'm too much on this
[34:23] one now. Now, Jesus Christ was he was
[34:26] pure. He was a pure and perfect
[34:28] sacrifice. He was a pure and perfect
[34:31] priest. He didn't have no infirmities
[34:34] that he had to to get forgiven of. He
[34:37] didn't have a problem. Amen. That he had
[34:40] listen. Is that the truth? Now, he was
[34:42] sick in his flesh, but he overcame every
[34:44] sickness. The Bible said, Amen. He was
[34:46] even tempted in his body such as we
[34:48] without sin. He never disbelieved.
[34:52] He was a pure and perfect lamb of God
[34:54] who performed the perfect sacrificial
[34:57] ritual. Is that right? He just didn't
[35:00] cover it all. He covered it all.
[35:05] That's right. Amen. He triumphed over
[35:09] Satan and all Satan possessed. Amen. In
[35:14] other words, he left Satan powerless.
[35:18] And you've heard me say this so many
[35:20] times. Satan's power is given by you.
[35:26] Cuz God took it away from him.
[35:29] He has no power. He has no authority.
[35:34] Not when it come to the name of Jesus
[35:37] Christ. You say, "Well, Lord, I want to
[35:40] make it. I just got to make it."
[35:41] Colossians 2:9 says, "For in him
[35:43] dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead
[35:45] bodily, and ye are complete in him,
[35:48] which is the head of all principalities
[35:50] and powers. Get behind me, Satan. I'm
[35:53] already complete."
[35:55] Oh my. You say, "But brother Books, I
[35:58] don't see how you can stand up there and
[35:59] say that." All I can tell you is the
[36:01] prophet of God went behind the curtain
[36:02] of time and he saw me there. Now, I
[36:04] wouldn't be there if I wasn't complete.
[36:09] I'm complete. I don't care what I look
[36:11] like right now. Hallelujah. I am and so
[36:14] are you. If you are in Christ,
[36:17] hallelujah, you are complete where? In
[36:20] him. Because you could never complete
[36:23] yourself. You say, "What do you mean by
[36:26] that?" That's why Jesus Christ being the
[36:29] second Adam,
[36:31] right? Or the last one, however you want
[36:33] to put it. Brother Bham said like this.
[36:35] He said God left his feminine part in
[36:40] there while he suffered. She was there
[36:44] when they slapped him. She was there.
[36:49] May maybe you're not getting it. Let me
[36:50] put it this way. I was there when they
[36:53] spat in his face. I was there when they
[36:57] mocked him. They laughed at him. I was
[36:59] there. When they crowned him, I was
[37:01] there.
[37:04] Hallelujah. That's why I tell people who
[37:06] suffer from these migraine headaches,
[37:08] you don't have to suffer. That's the
[37:09] devil. When they pierced Jesus Christ on
[37:11] his head, he took that migraine away
[37:13] from you. Hallelujah. The pressing of
[37:16] those stones on your head, amen, was a
[37:18] devil's migraine, and he took that from
[37:21] you.
[37:26] Yes, sir. He covered it all. He
[37:28] triumphed over Satan and all he
[37:31] possessed. You got to realize this
[37:33] crucifixion was no joke. And that's the
[37:35] thing is you and I have never seen one.
[37:37] So you and I can't imagine what it was
[37:39] like. Come on, somebody. It was worse
[37:42] than stumping your
[37:45] toe. It was worse than slamming your
[37:48] your hand in a door. Y'all hear what I'm
[37:51] saying? I'm saying these things because
[37:53] they can't even be compared. It's worse
[37:55] to the worst sickness you ever had. The
[37:58] worst pain you ever had is worse than
[38:00] that.
[38:04] Hello. Now, this crucifixion was no
[38:07] joke. You know, it looked like it was
[38:09] started by the Romans, but really in my
[38:11] studying, I found that the crucifixion
[38:13] was actually started by Alexander the
[38:16] Great. He started there, amen, in the
[38:19] great Persian Empire. And from him,
[38:21] amen, he taught it to what they call the
[38:23] Cath the
[38:25] Cathinians. And the Cathogenians taught
[38:28] it to the Romans. But it was the Romans
[38:30] who perfected
[38:32] it. And they literally took this thing
[38:34] and and and what they did, they were
[38:37] hanging you to keep your feet. You were
[38:39] so vile. Amen. Any man, the Bible said,
[38:41] "Cursed is the man that hangeth on a
[38:43] tree." So therefore, you were so vile.
[38:45] They wanted to keep your feet from
[38:47] touching the ground because the ground
[38:50] you supposedly crucified on would be
[38:51] holy ground.
[38:54] Nonsense. But the point
[38:56] is, the thing that I love about
[38:59] it, you know, it's amazing because they
[39:01] said when, you know, all of the blood
[39:03] the blood had to be poured to the basin
[39:04] of the of the of the of the sacrifice of
[39:07] the bowl, the bowl, the basin. And I
[39:09] thought, Lord God, I said, you know, God
[39:11] knew exactly what he was doing.
[39:12] Hallelujah. They said they they said
[39:14] they found the ark underneath the the
[39:17] the place where he was crucified. You
[39:19] know, God had to crack the earth because
[39:21] the blood had to drain. Oh my God. Amen.
[39:23] And you look at this thing, you say,
[39:24] "Well, brothers, what does that mean?"
[39:26] Listen, no matter what the Jews think,
[39:29] the true ark of
[39:32] God is here.
[39:35] That's just a shadow and a type.
[39:37] Hallelujah. But let me say it like this.
[39:40] Before the blood of Jesus Christ could
[39:43] ever get to your heart, Amen. He's got
[39:45] to rock it with an earthquake.
[39:48] Amen. He's got to crack that old stony
[39:51] heart and let that blood go right there
[39:54] in order to give you a heart of flesh.
[39:57] See, we we look at our hearts and you
[39:59] know, and it's it's something about us,
[40:01] we march up. We don't want to we don't
[40:02] want to cry. I tell you what, it is so
[40:04] hard. I could remember the time when the
[40:06] power of God would move. people would be
[40:08] shouting, crying and snotting and and
[40:10] whatever more it was. Now we've gotten
[40:12] so sophisticated and we've gotten more
[40:15] educated in the message, you know, and
[40:17] you know, now we know the greater and
[40:18] the deeper things. You don't know
[40:20] nothing.
[40:22] If you don't know Jesus Christ and he
[40:24] you know that he lives in you, you don't
[40:26] know nothing. You just got an
[40:28] imagination in your mind. Hallelujah.
[40:31] You got to have him on the inside. So
[40:34] much so he walks with you. He talks with
[40:36] you and he tells you that you're his
[40:38] own. Glory. Hallelujah. Come on,
[40:40] somebody. When the devil said you're a
[40:42] devil, Jesus said, "No, you're not."
[40:43] Amen. Y'all hear what I'm saying? The
[40:45] devil said you're a hypocrite, that Holy
[40:47] Ghost said, "No, you're not."
[40:48] Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. Y'all
[40:51] know what I'm talking about? When God re
[40:54] You say, "What? What?" Yeah. He speak.
[40:56] If Abel's blood was able to speak,
[41:00] come on, somebody. Cain killed Abel and
[41:03] Abel blood spoke and in speaking he said
[41:07] Lord where's my revenge but the Bible
[41:10] said there was another blood a greater
[41:13] sacrifice hallelujah that was greater
[41:16] than Cain and that sacrifice and that
[41:19] blood still speaks and that blood say
[41:22] father forgive them for they know not
[41:24] what they do
[41:27] that's the blood and all of us amen we
[41:29] look at this thing let me tell you
[41:30] something. I'd rather for the world to
[41:32] hate me for what I preach than to
[41:35] compromise on what I know is true.
[41:41] If I was going off of whether people
[41:42] like me or not, I'd be dead already. I
[41:45] got more enemies than friends. Y'all
[41:48] hear what I'm saying? So listen, let me
[41:50] say it like this. If it's hard sometime,
[41:53] I got to preach it because I'd rather
[41:55] deal with your angry faces than to deal
[41:57] with God. Amen.
[42:02] Now, we look at this thing and you got
[42:04] to realize, amen. This hanging on the
[42:07] tree was the it was a it was it was it
[42:09] was designed to produce the maximum pain
[42:12] and
[42:15] suffering in a slow death. It remind me
[42:19] of
[42:20] hell. The place you die, never
[42:24] die. And it's so long now. Come on,
[42:27] somebody. You know what people said? I'm
[42:29] too young. I can't I can't I'm too
[42:32] young. I can't be no Christian like
[42:33] that. I'm too young. I wonder what they
[42:35] thinking now that they've been down in
[42:36] hell for thousands of
[42:39] years. Huh? Was that that's that period
[42:42] is far longer. You traded
[42:46] eons of time over a little vapor of
[42:49] time. As James said,
[42:53] who cares about criticism in hell?
[42:55] Everybody's being criticized.
[42:58] And guess who criticized you in hell?
[43:01] Your own soul. Your own soul will be
[43:05] there and said, "I told you. I tried to
[43:08] warn you and you wouldn't listen."
[43:15] Hallelujah.
[43:17] The Bible said we're buried with him by
[43:19] baptism. I'm going too long. I'm sorry.
[43:21] My point is, Amen. When Jesus was
[43:24] crucified, listen what he said. I love
[43:26] these words. He said, "It is finished."
[43:29] Amen.
[43:31] It is finished. In other words, I've
[43:33] done everything the scriptures required
[43:36] me to do. It's finished. I've done the
[43:40] work, Lord. It's finished. And he told
[43:43] his disciples, "Now my time is at hand.
[43:46] Now that I've done all the deeds and
[43:47] everything is perfect, I've got to be
[43:49] sacrificed."
[43:51] Now, I'mma tell y'all
[43:54] this. Some would dare to die. The Bible
[43:59] says, but you got to realize what this
[44:02] death was
[44:03] about. Now, a lot of us saw the passion
[44:05] of Christ. It was worse than
[44:07] that. The human man, we we can't even
[44:10] fathom what how bad it was. But history
[44:13] said he didn't even look human after the
[44:16] beating. And guess what? You did it.
[44:20] He was taking your stripes, your
[44:22] whipping, your beating. And every time
[44:23] you go out in sin, that's another lick
[44:25] for Jesus.
[44:27] You did it. He suffered on Calvary
[44:30] because of us. I put him there. You put
[44:34] him there. And every time we willfully
[44:36] do everything, you literally are
[44:38] striking the man you say is your savior.
[44:41] You literally putting wounds on him.
[44:43] Come on.
[44:46] And think about it. He never changed his
[44:49] mind about you.
[44:52] He still loved you so much. He was
[44:53] willing to take every lick that Satan
[44:56] had coming to him. Hello.
[44:59] Think about
[45:00] it. Think about that. He loved you so
[45:03] much that he was beaten to a pulp just
[45:06] for you. Oh God, help us, Lord. Somehow
[45:08] we're not We got to brain freeze some
[45:10] here. I could feel it. You can't even
[45:11] comprehend it. No, you can't. But if you
[45:14] ask God to take you there, Amen. you
[45:17] would appreciate Calvary a whole lot
[45:19] more. Now, think about it. Here it is.
[45:23] The crown of all things, the end of
[45:26] time. We've had Pentecost. I'm jumping
[45:30] here. We've seen signs and wonders. But
[45:32] what was this
[45:34] finished? Let's go back to the beginning
[45:36] because you got to realize Jesus Christ
[45:38] would not have had to come had not Adam
[45:41] and Eve sinned.
[45:44] Not in the way he did. He would have
[45:46] just come as a son, but he had to come
[45:49] as a savior.
[45:51] He had to come as a deliverer. He had to
[45:55] come as a healer. Because he knew Satan
[45:57] through the fall was going to pervert
[45:59] everything and make it, excuse me for
[46:02] saying it like this, hell on earth for
[46:05] the children of God.
[46:09] Hello. He did it when Jesus Amen. raised
[46:14] from the dead. The Bible said we rose
[46:16] with him.
[46:19] Hallelujah. The Bible said we died. We
[46:21] rose with him. We were there when he
[46:24] kicked Satan. Amen. And slammed the door
[46:26] and took the keys. You and I were there.
[46:29] You say, "I don't remember, but I was in
[46:31] him." And so were you.
[46:34] Hallelujah.
[46:36] And you up on earth saying what you
[46:38] can't do. You did it all when you in
[46:41] him. You just got to you just got to
[46:44] meditate on the word and believe that
[46:46] you were there. Amen. You'll have the
[46:48] devil running from you after a while.
[46:54] Hallelujah. When he when he think about
[46:57] it, no man, no man, I don't care how
[46:59] great they were, had ever come up from
[47:02] the grave.
[47:06] Buddha,
[47:08] Allah, whatever his
[47:11] name, Muhammad, and all of them folks
[47:14] still down up in there. Do you think
[47:16] they in heaven with seven wives? I don't
[47:18] think
[47:19] so. There's only one people, they going
[47:21] to be shocked when they see Muhammad
[47:24] down in the fire.
[47:27] They kill me for saying that, but the
[47:30] truth is the truth. I don't care how
[47:32] many ways denominations say there's only
[47:35] one way to salvation.
[47:38] One way.
[47:42] Hallelujah. One door, one way. And
[47:44] everybody one God. They say, "Oh, it's
[47:47] three." Ah, you need to focus your
[47:49] glasses, right? Cuz it ain't nothing but
[47:51] one. Come on, somebody. Amen. So, we
[47:53] look at these things and you say, "Well,
[47:55] brothers, listen. Let me tell you
[47:56] something. Couldn't Wouldn't it be
[47:57] confusion confusing if you had three
[48:03] daddies? Think about it. Three
[48:09] daddies. But that's what people saying.
[48:11] They saying he's three and God is one in
[48:13] that way. Then therefore, whoever
[48:15] created you was all three of
[48:18] them. How you going to have three
[48:20] daddies? God in his wisdom brings you to
[48:24] one man. One man is your daddy. Yeah.
[48:27] Another man can say, "Well, I wish he
[48:29] was mine." But that's all he could do is
[48:30] wish.
[48:32] Cuz you can only come from where you
[48:34] come from.
[48:38] Am I making sense? Amen. So, we look at
[48:40] this thing. You say, "Oh, brother
[48:41] Brooks, listen. He whom the Son is set
[48:44] free is free indeed." Now, the Bible
[48:46] said there is now no condemnation to
[48:48] those who walk not after the flesh, but
[48:50] after the spirit. The Bible tells us
[48:52] that once you receive the Holy Ghost,
[48:54] you are now in God's eyes walking after
[48:57] the spirit. Why? Because the spirit will
[48:59] lead you. So wherever he leads you, you
[49:02] follow. You're not walking according,
[49:04] "Oh, do I make mistake?" Yes, but you're
[49:07] still being led by the Holy Spirit. You
[49:10] say, "Oh, it can't be." Yes, sir. The
[49:12] Bible said, "The footsteps of a
[49:14] righteous man are ordered by the Lord."
[49:16] God leads you like a shepherd.
[49:18] Hallelujah. And guess what? Sometimes he
[49:21] leads you into hard
[49:23] places and he already know the results.
[49:27] God ain't surprised. Oh my goodness. I
[49:30] didn't know that he would do me like
[49:31] that. No, he did. He knew what was in
[49:34] you. So he took you that way so that you
[49:36] could see what was in you. Hallelujah.
[49:39] Come on, somebody. But his point in
[49:41] leading you there is not for you to
[49:43] wallow. His point in leading you there
[49:45] is to get up.
[49:47] The just man falls seven times in a day
[49:49] and he gets up. Come on, somebody. Amen.
[49:53] When you're born free, you can never be
[49:55] a slave again.
[50:00] I thought somebody would respond better
[50:02] than that. But it's true. I got my
[50:08] papers. I got my papers. Hallelujah. And
[50:11] my papers were written before the
[50:12] foundation of the world. I know who I
[50:15] am. If I can't even get to where I'm
[50:16] going, blessed be the be he God. Amen.
[50:20] And father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[50:22] have blessed us with all spiritual
[50:23] blessings in heavenly places in Christ
[50:25] Jesus. Then why would you let the devil
[50:27] make you feel like you're cursed when
[50:29] God say he done blessed you with all
[50:30] blessings? You need to just start
[50:32] preaching to the devil. When the devil
[50:34] says you're not blessed, I'm blessed.
[50:36] Not with some, all things.
[50:42] Do y'all really believe in healing?
[50:43] Amen. Y'all know what I'm saying? Do you
[50:45] really believe in healing? When you
[50:47] believe in healing, guess what? I'm
[50:48] going to tell you something. Let me put
[50:50] it this way. Don't you know healing is a
[50:52] token
[50:54] of eternal life?
[50:57] When God When you see healing, that
[50:59] means eternal life is somewhere. Y'all
[51:02] hear what I'm saying? Now, I'mma bring
[51:03] it back to his word. God has already
[51:06] given Listen, God gave uh uh Noah a
[51:09] token. God told Noah, he said, "This
[51:11] rainbow sign
[51:14] It's my token to you. It'll never do
[51:16] this again. Is that right? It was a sure
[51:19] thing that God listen, let me put this
[51:22] away. A token is just a piece of the
[51:24] hole. Amen. Right. It is something that
[51:28] that gives you an assurance that
[51:31] whatever this token is about, I got it.
[51:33] In other words, Amen. I have a quarter,
[51:35] a token, and that's a token. And and
[51:38] especially if I want a loaf of bread.
[51:39] Well, you know, you're not going to buy
[51:40] that nowadays like that, but it used to
[51:42] be. You could buy a loaf of bread for a
[51:46] quarter. Anybody remember that? Oh, I'm
[51:50] the oldest one in here. Oh my
[51:52] god. Amen. So, you and I must
[51:56] realize. You must realize. Amen. Yes. I
[51:59] remember you could buy things with a
[52:01] penny. Did you know that you could buy
[52:03] cookies two for a penny? Anybody know
[52:06] where you could spend a penny now? No.
[52:09] You can't get nothing for a penny now.
[52:11] But my point is, amen. When when it
[52:14] comes down to a token, a token is a
[52:17] small part of representing the whole. In
[52:22] other words, when God gives you the Holy
[52:23] Ghost, that's just a token.
[52:26] That ain't the whole.
[52:31] Come on, somebody. That's just a token,
[52:34] somebody. And if it's good now, what is
[52:37] it going to be later? Hallelujah. Oh my
[52:41] god.
[52:44] Think about it. Think about it. You
[52:46] said, "What a token?" Let me tell you
[52:48] something. What a token could do. A
[52:49] token can make a a a man by the name of
[52:51] Elijah run so fast he passed a chariot.
[52:57] That's the kind of token I'm talking
[52:59] about. Amen. That was just a touch of
[53:01] heaven. Hallelujah. He was in another
[53:03] dimension. Hallelujah.
[53:06] I wish I was there to see it.
[53:08] Hallelujah. You said a tok a token. This
[53:10] token I'm talking about. Amen. It's just
[53:12] a part of heaven. Amen. Philip didn't
[53:14] need a car. He didn't need a plane. He
[53:16] didn't need a jet. He was translated.
[53:20] That's what this token gives you. Amen.
[53:22] Amen. It's just a part of the hole. And
[53:24] one of these days, Amen. Amen. We'll be
[53:27] translated out of here and we'll look
[53:30] back and think, "Oh my god, what a
[53:32] dump."
[53:35] He said, "When I see the blood," he told
[53:37] Moses, "I'm going to give you the blood
[53:38] as a token."
[53:41] Hallelujah. Amen. The blood of the lamb,
[53:43] that little Holy Ghost, that speck of
[53:45] Holy Ghost that you got in you. It's
[53:46] just a token. It's just something that
[53:49] said there's a greater land. There's a
[53:51] greater place. There's a greater
[53:52] something coming up the road.
[53:56] Hallelujah. Sometime that Holy Ghost get
[53:58] on you. So, Amen. You feel like you want
[54:00] to bust.
[54:02] Hallelujah. But think about it. One of
[54:04] these old days we will
[54:07] Hallelujah. One of these days we'll be
[54:08] translated. Think about it. Now I'm
[54:10] talking about the token because the
[54:12] token and you got a reason why he he
[54:14] raised it like this. Because it is the
[54:17] life of the blood.
[54:24] Is the life of the blood. and this
[54:27] blood. If Jesus, whatever Jesus did,
[54:30] let's put it this way. Let's put it this
[54:33] way in our term. If Jesus could take his
[54:35] DNA and put it on a computer trip chip
[54:38] and put it in you,
[54:42] cuz that's all the Holy Ghost is. Amen.
[54:45] God's DNA.
[54:47] And he puts it in you and he turns the
[54:51] computer on. Come on, somebody. This DNA
[54:55] is going to outride
[54:58] every little germ.
[55:01] Come on. No virus can stand on this one.
[55:04] Hallelujah. Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[55:06] This thing is going to go through the
[55:08] whole thing, clean it up. Amen. Give you
[55:10] a faster running system.
[55:14] Y'all hear what I'm saying? Mine's kind
[55:15] of going down, this one here. So, I need
[55:17] me a new one. Come on, somebody. Amen.
[55:19] It'll give you a faster one. Y'all know
[55:21] it's nothing like a computer that's
[55:23] running slow and you're like,
[55:25] "Come
[55:27] on, sometime
[55:29] today." You know, but when it's fast,
[55:32] Amen. you get excited. You, you know, it
[55:34] makes you even do this. Amen. You know,
[55:37] it just something about those fast pace.
[55:39] Hallelujah. Now, I say that by the grace
[55:42] of God, we'll travel like a thought
[55:44] because of the token.
[55:46] Amen. And understand this. This token
[55:49] can only be given to those who it is it
[55:52] belongs to.
[55:56] Come on somebody. Amen. That means the
[55:59] computer must be designed
[56:02] for the token to fit. The chip must fit
[56:05] your computer. Hallelujah. And where is
[56:08] the is is is where is going to be
[56:10] download the hard drive.
[56:14] Come on somebody. Come on somebody. And
[56:16] you and I must realize Amen. That's why
[56:18] we ought to be shouting, dancing,
[56:20] praising God, loving God, living before
[56:23] God. Amen. Because we realize we're
[56:25] free. Let me say it like this. There
[56:27] ain't nothing here can send me to hell.
[56:31] Nothing. Nothing can send me to hell. I
[56:34] cannot even send me to hell. Why?
[56:36] Because I've died already. I'm dead.
[56:39] Hallelujah. And the Bible said if I pass
[56:41] from death unto life, Hallelujah. when I
[56:44] believe in Jesus Christ.
[56:48] Hallelujah. So I am so free. The devil
[56:52] hates me and what it is. He's trying to
[56:54] make it miserable on this earth for you.
[56:59] Reminding you of your past. And like
[57:01] they say, you ought to remind him of
[57:03] your his future.
[57:06] Huh? Oh my my my
[57:10] my. Believe this me. Oh, I'm I'm I'm I'm
[57:14] I'm going to close out on this a just a
[57:16] bit. Uh because I I'll save the rest for
[57:18] this evening. For those who come out,
[57:20] we'll have a good time. Yeah. I know
[57:23] some of you have family situations to
[57:25] do, but then that's okay. You know, just
[57:28] keep God on your mind wherever you go,
[57:29] whatever you do. But I want you to
[57:31] understand this
[57:32] token. Think about it. I love this thing
[57:35] because the Holy Ghost had not come yet.
[57:38] And God told the man, he says, "I want
[57:40] you to circumcise them on the eighth
[57:41] day.
[57:44] See, the church ages couldn't get what
[57:45] we got. It wasn't the eighth day yet.
[57:51] It wasn't the eighth day yet. It was
[57:53] only on the eighth day. Hallelujah. The
[57:55] circumcision could happen. Hallelujah.
[57:59] It was only in this day. That's why God
[58:01] preached a message of visible union of
[58:03] the bride and the bridegroom.
[58:05] Hallelujah. Because there were coming a
[58:07] complete circumcision. That's why the
[58:09] Pentecostals failed. They didn't have a
[58:11] complete circumcision if they had only
[58:13] gone. See what I'm saying? They had the
[58:16] Holy Ghost in the outer court. Now, I'm
[58:17] talking the real ones now. They in
[58:19] heaven, but they supposed to be. But I'm
[58:21] just saying they didn't carry it all the
[58:23] way. They didn't go into the Holies of
[58:24] Holies. You see what I'm saying? Y'all
[58:27] hear what I'm saying? They got to the
[58:28] place speaking in tongues with the Holy
[58:30] Ghost. Shouting was the Holy Ghost.
[58:31] Dancing was the Holy Ghost. I'mma tell
[58:32] you something. I saw that devil do that
[58:34] before I came to this message or the
[58:36] Pentecostal church. Hallelujah.
[58:40] But when that life comes on the inside,
[58:45] it won't even let you do what you want
[58:47] to do.
[58:49] Huh? Oh, it would torment you. Did y'all
[58:52] know what I'm saying? It's like a
[58:54] nagging child. Mama, mama, mama, mama.
[58:58] That's how it is. Y'all know what I'm
[59:01] saying? The Holy Ghost is that way. He
[59:03] will never let you have peace when you
[59:05] done wrong.
[59:07] That's how you know you got something.
[59:10] Hallelujah. That's how you know you got
[59:12] something. The devil ain't telling you
[59:14] to make it right.
[59:17] [Applause]
[59:19] And all you got to do is let him grow.
[59:21] Grow, Lord. Add unto me virtue. Add unto
[59:24] me patience. Add to me, brotherly
[59:25] kindness. Add unto me. Add to me. Add
[59:27] me. Add unto me. And Lord, until I come
[59:29] into the p stature of Christ.
[59:33] H oh yes. I so thank God for the grace
[59:37] of
[59:39] God. Look what the prophet said in in
[59:42] and I'm going to close in just a minute.
[59:43] Just give me one or two more minutes.
[59:45] Don't time me. Please don't time
[59:47] me. Pat's vision 6124. He said, "What
[59:51] happens when two omnipotent meet?"
[59:55] Don't you know when you get the Holy
[59:56] Ghost, you are omnipotent?
[59:59] Oh Lord, I'm tired and I am weary. You
[1:00:03] got to stop singing that.
[1:00:08] That was the age before us. Hallelujah.
[1:00:10] Come on, somebody. Amen. We are
[1:00:12] victorious, Brian. Hallelujah. We've got
[1:00:15] the same songs of victory. Watch out,
[1:00:17] devil. I'm coming your way. Now, I don't
[1:00:20] know a song like that, but if anybody
[1:00:22] can write one like that, that would be
[1:00:23] pretty good. on with Christian
[1:00:27] soldier. Amen. What happens when two
[1:00:30] omnipotent mean when God and man comes
[1:00:32] together? Two omnipotent sometimes some
[1:00:36] something's got to shake. We've heard
[1:00:38] this before. Whatsoever you say with the
[1:00:41] creative power of the omnipotent of
[1:00:44] God. That was brother Keith's testimony.
[1:00:47] Amen. Anybody else have had a testimony
[1:00:49] like that? God has already put on your
[1:00:51] heart what to say, what to do, and it
[1:00:53] happens just like that.
[1:00:56] Hallelujah. Knowing that he's promised
[1:00:58] it and he said it in his word, it
[1:01:01] creates a power that goes out yonder and
[1:01:04] bring things to pass. You say, "Oh,
[1:01:06] brother, you know, I really want God
[1:01:08] straighten
[1:01:10] up." You know, we need to just
[1:01:13] straighten up and stop making the devil
[1:01:16] greater than God. Our gospel is not
[1:01:20] about Lucifer. Our gospel is about Jesus
[1:01:23] Christ. What he did, how powerful he is,
[1:01:26] how omnipotent he is, how he overcome
[1:01:29] everything. He victorious. He's God.
[1:01:31] He's the only true God. We don't have to
[1:01:34] worry. If you can focus on the right
[1:01:36] thing, you'll get the right victory. You
[1:01:38] get it? You'll get it.
[1:01:42] Hallelujah. The bride don't sing the
[1:01:44] blues.
[1:01:48] Come on, somebody.
[1:01:52] Hallelujah. Oh, if you had been here, my
[1:01:56] brother would not have died. No, we
[1:02:00] don't say that.
[1:02:03] Amen. Huh? We're right there. We're at
[1:02:05] the resurrection. He says, "Listen, we
[1:02:07] said I told you if you can believe it,
[1:02:09] you can. All things are possible. You'll
[1:02:11] see something here. But it's your faith.
[1:02:14] As I said many times, your mind is where
[1:02:17] the blockage is. It ain't the word. It's
[1:02:20] your mind. That's where the blockage is.
[1:02:23] You have listen taught traditions and
[1:02:25] all of that. Let me ask you a question.
[1:02:28] How many who were in here could convince
[1:02:30] a Muslim who's been born a Muslim that
[1:02:33] his faith is
[1:02:35] wrong? Y'all hear what I'm saying? He
[1:02:37] born that. He was taught that since he
[1:02:39] was a ni to a duck.
[1:02:43] How you going to tell him? If God don't
[1:02:45] come by and give him revelation, he'll
[1:02:48] never see it.
[1:02:50] Whether it be Baptist, Methodist,
[1:02:52] Presbyterian, Catholic, or or
[1:02:54] Pentecostal, if God don't come by
[1:02:58] and show them, they'll never see.
[1:03:03] Y'all hear what I'm saying? That's the
[1:03:05] only reason why you see
[1:03:08] is because God personally showed it to
[1:03:10] you.
[1:03:12] Otherwise, you wouldn't see it. You'll
[1:03:14] be on the opposite side just like
[1:03:15] anybody else. Y'all know what I'm
[1:03:17] saying?
[1:03:19] Same
[1:03:21] here. When I was in that one church,
[1:03:23] nobody could tell me. I thought that was
[1:03:24] the
[1:03:25] ultimate. Hallelujah. And I saw wrong
[1:03:28] going on, but I still thought, man,
[1:03:29] nobody can preach truth like this. Then
[1:03:31] when I heard the eagle scream,
[1:03:36] say, you got to come up higher. You got
[1:03:39] to come up higher.
[1:03:41] Hallelujah. I realized, Amen. From that
[1:03:43] point, I was no longer a sinner saved by
[1:03:46] grace. Hallelujah. But I was a son.
[1:03:49] Hallelujah. Born a son, created a son.
[1:03:52] Hallelujah. I didn't know I was a son
[1:03:55] until the sun shined on me.
[1:03:59] I always was a son. That's why I
[1:04:01] couldn't enjoy myself in the world like
[1:04:02] that. It's true. My friends could enjoy
[1:04:06] themselves and I'd come home every
[1:04:08] Saturday. You know, it's good now. I
[1:04:10] come on every Saturday. Amen. You know,
[1:04:13] you know, just crying in the mirror, you
[1:04:16] know, just just done. Oh my. Oh Lord, I
[1:04:19] ain't going to do it no more. I just
[1:04:20] ain't going to do it no more. Now you
[1:04:22] know you're drunk when you fall up the
[1:04:28] stairs. I done had that one,
[1:04:30] too. Hallelujah. Yay. Y'all know what
[1:04:34] I'm talking about? Y'all
[1:04:37] look, this old boy was no saint all
[1:04:40] along. And the only reason why I'm a
[1:04:41] saint now because God made me one. If
[1:04:44] you follow me every day, you'll find
[1:04:46] something I'm doing wrong.
[1:04:49] I fall short every day. Anybody know
[1:04:51] what I'm talking about? And don't get up
[1:04:54] in his head. There's a battle there
[1:04:55] going on all the time.
[1:04:58] Hallelujah. But regardless of that, I
[1:05:01] know who I am. Hallelujah. Amen. been
[1:05:04] washed in the blood of the lamb and I'm
[1:05:07] standing in his presence right now. This
[1:05:10] old foul body right now is going to be
[1:05:12] changed moment. Y'all know what I'm
[1:05:14] talking about. Because of the blood.
[1:05:17] Because there was a lamb. Hallelujah.
[1:05:18] They said, "Who's worthy? Who's worthy?"
[1:05:21] Hallelujah. They said, "Oh, John, don't
[1:05:24] you weep. There's a lion of the tribe of
[1:05:26] Judah. He's prevailed." Hallelujah.
[1:05:28] Thank God for the lamb. Thank God for
[1:05:31] the blood of the lamb. because of the
[1:05:34] lamb. Don't you know the whole creation
[1:05:35] will be restored?
[1:05:39] The whole creation, this thing, listen,
[1:05:42] every every animal, everything that's
[1:05:44] faulty, everything that Satan polluted,
[1:05:47] everything will be restored. Can you
[1:05:49] imagine just by the drop of blood?
[1:05:56] You and I, we have no idea. And I'm
[1:05:58] going to say something and I'm This is
[1:05:59] where I'm going to start. Possessors
[1:06:03] Because of the blood, we are possessors
[1:06:07] of heaven and earth.
[1:06:13] Come on, church. Y'all know what I'm
[1:06:14] talking about. In this little church,
[1:06:17] we've experienced God turning storms.
[1:06:23] Y'all, we prayed, "Lord, don't let it
[1:06:25] come. We want to have church." It
[1:06:26] turned. There was a time a bad ice storm
[1:06:29] would come. It split. The weatherman
[1:06:31] said, "We don't know what happened."
[1:06:33] Hallelujah. But this little bride over
[1:06:35] here, Amen. We know what happened.
[1:06:37] Hallelujah. Because, Amen. We're
[1:06:39] possessors of heaven and earth.
[1:06:42] Hallelujah. We know what we're doing
[1:06:44] over here.
[1:06:49] We're not running in the darkness like,
[1:06:51] "Oh my God, what am I doing?"
[1:06:52] Hallelujah. Amen. But, you know, we're
[1:06:54] not some kind of cow that think he's a
[1:06:57] sheep. We know we're sheep. We know
[1:06:59] we're lambs. Hallelujah. But we also got
[1:07:02] our father's nature. We can be lions,
[1:07:03] too. Hallelujah. We know how to roar.
[1:07:06] Hallelujah. When it's time to roar,
[1:07:09] people of God, let me tell you
[1:07:10] something. If you ever continue if you
[1:07:12] continue to judge yourself by your
[1:07:14] flesh, you going to be lost.
[1:07:16] Your flesh was judged by the law and it
[1:07:18] never could do do what it was supposed
[1:07:20] to do. You are a a complete mess up.
[1:07:23] Satan mess you up. You did not desire.
[1:07:27] It was your It wasn't your choosing that
[1:07:29] you would be born the way you're born.
[1:07:31] We're subject to these vanities.
[1:07:34] Hallelujah. We came into this earth
[1:07:36] being born in a nasty nature. And that's
[1:07:39] why God being so just said, "But that
[1:07:41] ain't the way you're supposed to be."
[1:07:42] Hallelujah. That's not the way I saw you
[1:07:45] in my mind. And what did he do? He's
[1:07:47] He's obligated. Listen to this. Listen
[1:07:49] to this. And you know, and I'm closing.
[1:07:51] He he said this. That old eagle went
[1:07:55] looking for that egg. Oh, I searched for
[1:07:58] God. You didn't search for him. He
[1:08:00] looked for you.
[1:08:03] And if he ain't found you in there, he
[1:08:05] going to find you. You You coming up.
[1:08:07] Hallelujah. Cuz he said, "I never lost
[1:08:09] one." Hallelujah. The devil will never
[1:08:12] take one of God's thoughts. If he if the
[1:08:14] devil is that powerful, he will reduce
[1:08:17] God.
[1:08:20] He could never take God's children away
[1:08:22] from him. Never. Never. Never. No matter
[1:08:25] what he does. You say, "Well, brother
[1:08:26] Rick, let me tell you something.
[1:08:27] There'll be a lot of people in heaven
[1:08:29] that you thought wasn't going to be
[1:08:30] there. There are a lot of people in hell
[1:08:32] who thought you thought was going to be
[1:08:33] in heaven." Why? Because it's not by
[1:08:35] what good works you do. It's by the
[1:08:38] grace of God. Hallelujah. And it's
[1:08:40] about, can I say it like this? It's
[1:08:41] election.
[1:08:44] It's election. That don't mean we go out
[1:08:46] and just do what we want to do. Lord, I
[1:08:48] want to do right. I want to be holy. I
[1:08:50] want to be what he wants me to be. But
[1:08:52] if I fall short, Hallelujah. Thank God.
[1:08:55] Hallelujah. God me. Hallelujah. By the
[1:08:58] blood of the lamb. Hallelujah. He's
[1:09:00] already covered me. I'm free. I'm free.
[1:09:03] If I die right now, I it'd be less than
[1:09:05] five minutes, I'll be in the presence of
[1:09:07] God. Less than five minutes, I'll be
[1:09:10] there. You say, "Well, brother, how you
[1:09:12] know that?" He promised it.
[1:09:17] That's what he did for me. I don't have
[1:09:19] to go by purgatory or or paradise. I'm
[1:09:22] going straight there.
[1:09:31] Brother Brooks, you know, I done made so
[1:09:32] many mistakes. Hello. He gave you the
[1:09:35] Holy Ghost and knew you still was going
[1:09:37] to make mistakes.
[1:09:40] And he sealed you to the day of your
[1:09:41] redemption. Hallelujah. That's why he
[1:09:44] said, "Grieve not the Holy Ghost whereby
[1:09:46] you were seen."
[1:09:55] Hallelujah.
[1:09:58] Oh, leave me alone now. Leave me
[1:10:03] alone. Oh
[1:10:05] my
[1:10:07] H. Yes, Lord.
[1:10:12] Woo.
[1:10:15] Woo!
[1:10:29] Hey! Hallelujah!
[1:10:36] Oh my
[1:10:39] my brother Rich had a dream whether I
[1:10:42] should tell or
[1:10:44] not and I
[1:10:46] forgot years ago my wife might
[1:10:50] remember Satan was we were living in uh
[1:10:55] Ohio and it's amazing it came back to me
[1:10:57] brother years later I
[1:11:00] mean but anyway that dream That dream
[1:11:03] was of
[1:11:04] God. I'm not going to tell it, but the
[1:11:06] dream was of God. And uh I I just say
[1:11:10] enough to say the enemy was challenging
[1:11:14] me on
[1:11:16] something. And uh I saw that
[1:11:20] same
[1:11:22] individual in that same uniform. I
[1:11:26] totally forgot
[1:11:28] about and it was so odd that I was
[1:11:31] looking myself
[1:11:33] But I can truly say God did that to
[1:11:36] remind me of something. So I appreciate
[1:11:38] you telling me, you know, I I want to
[1:11:41] say this, people of God, we we're
[1:11:42] getting ready to and I I I just wish I
[1:11:45] could say things in detail. I I don't
[1:11:47] know what God's getting ready to do, but
[1:11:48] I know he's getting ready to do
[1:11:49] something
[1:11:50] mighty. And I am so glad to
[1:11:54] be See, let let it say like this. It
[1:11:57] won't do you any good to study this
[1:12:00] message and know it from A to
[1:12:04] Z. Without the revelation that you're
[1:12:07] free and the grace of God has found you,
[1:12:12] you're going to always go back to the
[1:12:14] law. God can't love me because I'm not
[1:12:17] doing this. You wrong. The Bible said
[1:12:21] God loved us in while when we were yet
[1:12:23] sinners.
[1:12:26] But God ain't going to bless me because
[1:12:28] I'm not doing right.
[1:12:30] Hello. Let me tell you something. What
[1:12:32] he did to
[1:12:34] Abraham. Abraham
[1:12:36] lied. He was wrong. Went down there to
[1:12:40] that king and lied. When Abraham come up
[1:12:42] out of there, he was far more blessed
[1:12:44] than he was before he got
[1:12:47] there. He had more riches.
[1:12:50] Come on, somebody. He had more. And he
[1:12:54] had a greater revelation of God.
[1:12:58] See, you you you see, we can't put God
[1:13:00] in no box. And and I'm going to tell
[1:13:02] you, let me put it this way. It doesn't
[1:13:03] give us the right to just say, "Oh, I'm
[1:13:05] going just do anything." But my point is
[1:13:07] this. You've got to know you're
[1:13:10] free. You got to know if I die right
[1:13:12] now, I'm going to heaven.
[1:13:16] Not because of my righteousness, because
[1:13:17] of his. It's what he did for me. You
[1:13:21] hear what I'm saying? your lamb. If you
[1:13:23] if you can't if you can't say that from
[1:13:24] your heart, your lamb is not perfect in
[1:13:26] your heart. You don't have a perfect
[1:13:28] revelation of the lamb and what it did
[1:13:30] for you. You don't understand what the
[1:13:32] blood has done for you. If you can't
[1:13:34] truly say right now, if I die, I'm going
[1:13:37] to heaven.
[1:13:39] If you have truly received Jesus Christ
[1:13:41] in your heart, you
[1:13:43] cannot call the word a lie. The Bible
[1:13:46] said if you receive, you pass from death
[1:13:47] into life. You've already That's the
[1:13:51] word. Oh God, I didn't shout. I didn't
[1:13:53] dance. I don't care if I don't never
[1:13:54] shout or dance. I just want to live it.
[1:13:57] I want to praise him. Amen. Because of
[1:13:59] what he's done for me.
[1:14:01] Let's stand. Let's stand. I can go on. I
[1:14:03] can connect the service if you want me
[1:14:05] to.
[1:14:10] You know, I I put it this way. Uh saints
[1:14:13] of God, I still I didn't Anyway, God did
[1:14:15] what he wanted to do.
[1:14:19] But my whole point is because of the
[1:14:21] blood we're here. Don't you know on
[1:14:23] Easter rising of the sun, he said when
[1:14:26] that two sons rose, he said two sons ro
[1:14:29] uh rose that morning. Jesus Christ the
[1:14:33] son of God and the su
[1:14:38] n. They rose in harmony. The natural man
[1:14:41] and the spiritual man will connect one
[1:14:44] of these old days. My theophony. Come
[1:14:46] on, somebody. My word body. Amen. My
[1:14:49] glorified body and and and and me. We
[1:14:51] going to all come together. And guess
[1:14:53] what? It will be one.
[1:14:56] Hallelujah. It ain't going to be three
[1:14:58] of me. One.
[1:15:02] I cannot even imagine. Y'all think David
[1:15:06] was a dancer.
[1:15:09] I can't even imagine when I get over
[1:15:11] there what it's going to be like. Ah, no
[1:15:14] stop signs.
[1:15:17] Hallelujah. Nothing to deter me from
[1:15:20] what I'm doing. Oh my God. And they say,
[1:15:22] "I can only imagine." That's for sure.
[1:15:24] You'll have to have another body, amen,
[1:15:25] to look at him. You'll melt. You'll just
[1:15:28] fall apart. You You like sand grains of
[1:15:30] sand. You couldn't stand before God.
[1:15:32] You've got to have something different
[1:15:34] to stand before him. Think about it. No
[1:15:36] pain, no sorrow, no heartaches. Amen.
[1:15:40] and and and children are beautiful, but
[1:15:43] you got to understand there won't be no
[1:15:44] children.
[1:15:49] Y'all ought to be some of y'all should
[1:15:50] have been shouting,
[1:15:52] but y'all know what I'm saying? You
[1:15:54] won't have to be running over here. Come
[1:15:56] over here. Here. Come over here. No. All
[1:15:58] of us will be in a mature age.
[1:16:02] Children came by the fall, the way we
[1:16:05] come by sex. Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:16:07] But before then we were to be spoken
[1:16:09] into
[1:16:11] existence created even as Adam and Eve
[1:16:13] was full adults. Hallelujah. But because
[1:16:16] of that God had to learn teach us
[1:16:18] through children what the fall did to
[1:16:20] us. Because children has to learn how to
[1:16:23] talk properly, walk, eat right. We the
[1:16:27] parents. And because of the fall, we had
[1:16:28] to be taught all these things.
[1:16:30] Hallelujah. Among the animal kingdom,
[1:16:32] they don't have to be taught nothing.
[1:16:34] They already know. See, they didn't
[1:16:36] fall. we
[1:16:38] fail. So God is teaching man and man
[1:16:41] still haven't
[1:16:42] learned. So but in that day, Amen. They
[1:16:46] they all of us, but we'll be like
[1:16:48] children. You know, we might be in a
[1:16:50] grown state, but God said, "For such is
[1:16:52] the kingdom." Like children, you know,
[1:16:54] we won't we won't have these old
[1:16:56] computer brains. No, sir. Amen. We'll
[1:17:00] know all things. Huh? Is that right? Our
[1:17:03] theophony knows all things. Jesus said,
[1:17:06] "You know all things."
[1:17:10] And don't get me wrong, somebody got mad
[1:17:12] with me cuz I told them it wasn't going
[1:17:13] to be no snow. I said, "Don't mean no
[1:17:15] huh. Snow came from the fall and it
[1:17:17] won't be any there."
[1:17:21] God will have something better for you
[1:17:23] to
[1:17:24] do. It ain't going to be no
[1:17:27] hunting. I'm so sorry. All you little
[1:17:30] moose heads that's on this side, it
[1:17:33] won't be there. There'll be none of that
[1:17:36] kind of stuff. This is stuff foolishness
[1:17:39] in the eyes of God. Come on, somebody.
[1:17:42] Amen. So, I just thank God. I can't
[1:17:45] imagine, but I can hardly wait. You know
[1:17:48] what? I have to say that, brother, cuz
[1:17:50] I'm going to tell you something. The
[1:17:51] closer the rapture become, the more
[1:17:53] wicked you may even appear to be
[1:17:54] yourself. Your flesh ain't going to
[1:17:56] change, but the soul
[1:18:00] inside. More determination to sin. more
[1:18:03] determination to be like him. More
[1:18:06] determination is what you're looking at.
[1:18:08] Something pressing in you to to have
[1:18:10] more of him. What do you think that is?
[1:18:13] What do you think that is? That's
[1:18:15] election. You say, "Lord, I'm so far
[1:18:18] behind. Everybody can't be on the front
[1:18:20] line. Somebody got to come behind. I
[1:18:22] don't care if I am a komboose brother.
[1:18:24] I'm coming."
[1:18:27] I'm attached. Hallelujah. And ain't
[1:18:29] nothing breaking the chain. Hallelujah.
[1:18:34] Ain't nothing breaking it. It's a
[1:18:36] predestinated one. Oh, ship of Zion.
[1:18:38] Come on, somebody. You love God. Amen.
[1:18:42] Let's give God a round of applause.
[1:18:43] Hallelujah.
[1:18:45] Oh Lord, we thank you for this day. We
[1:18:47] thank you, Father, in commemoration,
[1:18:49] Father, of what you've already done for
[1:18:51] us, Lord. He whom the Son is set free is
[1:18:54] free indeed. Lord, we love you. Love
[1:18:56] you. Love you. Love you.
