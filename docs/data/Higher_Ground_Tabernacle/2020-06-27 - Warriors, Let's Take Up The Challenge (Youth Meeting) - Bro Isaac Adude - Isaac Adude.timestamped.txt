[39:28] I mean I I dealing plane to read to the
[39:33] verse 19 for them I feel like reading a
[39:36] tube you know to make everything clear
[39:37] and my subject this morning I mean this
[39:42] afternoon
[39:43] is wario's let's take up the challenge
[39:47] because if you read if you read and in
[39:50] those two Verte in those two chapters or
[39:53] those two books where we read you see
[39:55] that the main were challenged we see
[39:59] David was the the the army of Israel
[40:01] which
[40:02] Goliath you know standing and telling
[40:05] them that you know I will kill you all
[40:07] and none of you will come and fight
[40:09] against me because it was big it was
[40:12] huge she was tall and he thought they
[40:14] were stronger than everybody yes
[40:16] physically he was that's why it was a
[40:19] confidence into himself saying that you
[40:22] know I will kill everybody and he said
[40:25] before the children of Israel a
[40:27] challenge and that challenge somebody
[40:30] somebody had to take it up
[40:32] somebody had to go before him and say
[40:34] that hey we do serve a living God who
[40:37] can deliver us from your hand and and
[40:40] here we see it in second Kings we see
[40:43] that there were also another team his
[40:46] name was an Arab I used this verse this
[40:49] scripture one time when I preached the
[40:52] King the name of the king was in a grave
[40:55] he came and he said a challenge before
[40:57] the king of Judah before before before
[41:00] the king of Judah saying that your God
[41:04] would not deliver you from my hand and
[41:06] he began to show him how his father how
[41:09] his father killed other nations he began
[41:12] to show him how his father killed other
[41:14] other other Kings how other gods could
[41:17] not said free their kings and what he
[41:20] forgot was that the god that he was now
[41:23] challenging was different from the god
[41:26] he killed the god that he was now
[41:28] challenging was different from all other
[41:31] gods that he called that their gods
[41:33] could not save them you know he forgot
[41:35] that that's the part I forgot I forgot
[41:37] that the now that as a crier was serving
[41:42] a true and living God
[41:43] if Ogada Hezekiah was serving a God who
[41:47] was able you know to set him free if we
[41:50] forgotten Hezekiah was serving a God who
[41:52] was able to intervene to the fight and
[41:54] fight for him and he forgot all the you
[41:58] know all the fight that Israel had and
[42:00] how God delivered them from their
[42:02] enemies you know he forgot all of that
[42:05] and he came before them setting a
[42:07] challenge you know telling him that hey
[42:09] here's a challenge and now you can't you
[42:12] know your God can't can deliver you from
[42:14] that
[42:15] and we see that all those things you
[42:17] know went on to show us you know to give
[42:20] us the ability to trust God to give us
[42:23] the trust in God to give us the faith to
[42:25] build our faith you know to know that
[42:27] you know God has delivered people from
[42:29] the pinna past
[42:30] you know God has delivered the tune of
[42:33] Israel with everything ahead and is the
[42:35] same God today who can deliver us
[42:38] because we also as young people we do
[42:40] have challenges you know when you might
[42:42] not know it but we do have challenges
[42:44] when you go to work you go you go to
[42:46] school you have you are in in places
[42:50] where people don't believe as you it's a
[42:52] challenge for you because you have to
[42:54] keep a good reproach you know you go
[42:56] over the places and you see people you
[42:59] know cursing cussing and and singing you
[43:02] know it's a challenge for you you know
[43:04] cuz they don't believe that in this
[43:06] world that there's there's still people
[43:08] who follow the Bible they don't believe
[43:11] that in this world that's their people
[43:13] you know who all right they don't
[43:14] believe that in this world there's still
[43:16] young people you know who can stand and
[43:18] say hey you know this I don't do this
[43:20] this I don't say and this song I don't
[43:22] hear and this this this I don't do you
[43:25] know they don't think that there's still
[43:26] some other people and that is a
[43:28] challenge for us and that somebody has
[43:30] to take up the challenge somebody has to
[43:33] take up and show them hey Here I am
[43:35] I buy a Living Bible somebody has to go
[43:38] and take up the challenge you know we
[43:40] see one time David after going to the
[43:43] bottle you know he was coming home and
[43:45] and and and and and someone told him
[43:47] that his wife and and the wife of all
[43:50] these soldiers were taken and and that
[43:53] was also another challenge for David and
[43:55] he had to show that enemies that he was
[43:58] serving that God was more than able even
[44:00] though he didn't know where they went
[44:02] even though he didn't know who they took
[44:04] it but God was able to go and fight with
[44:07] him and to bring those people back and
[44:10] that is the same thing with us too you
[44:12] know you might have you know family
[44:14] people or friends or brothers going
[44:17] through a hard time you know you might
[44:18] not know what they're going through by
[44:20] your prayer is able or God is able to
[44:23] hear your prayer and to say them free if
[44:25] you only believe and the Prophet says
[44:28] that we need a man
[44:29] men and women who knows their position
[44:31] because if you see that all those people
[44:33] you know they knew their position you
[44:35] see David when was facing the challenge
[44:38] he knew his position that's why he could
[44:40] have gone to - so to tell him that -
[44:44] telling the experiences he had before
[44:46] you know he told them that experience he
[44:48] had with the lion he told him the
[44:50] experience he had with the bear you know
[44:52] telling him that hey I destroyed those
[44:54] those wild animals and I am able the God
[44:57] God that the god arisen with the God
[45:00] that is within me he's able to destroy
[45:02] this man again you know he had
[45:03] experienced God before and but and from
[45:07] those experience you know he had
[45:09] confidence in God he knew his position
[45:11] and he could have gone to show and tell
[45:14] him you know the same God who protected
[45:16] me is the same God today you know who
[45:18] will protect me against this one that's
[45:20] why you know experience is very very
[45:22] very important for us you know I I had
[45:25] my previous cuz this sermon was not what
[45:28] I planned to to preach today I had
[45:30] another one that are entitled a story of
[45:36] taking linear let me check it up again a
[45:39] story that becomes a personal experience
[45:42] you know cause because we went to our
[45:45] till Kentucky last night last week and
[45:48] we heard how those people the experience
[45:52] of the people you know who were a drug
[45:54] addict before you know who were you know
[45:56] who were who were drugged who were
[46:01] drinking and we were you know bad guys
[46:04] and how God has said them free and from
[46:07] those experience you know they were
[46:09] going and witness to people and God was
[46:12] saving them you know from the experience
[46:14] they had you know they had a standpoint
[46:16] they had some where they say that you
[46:18] know hey I have experienced God and they
[46:20] knew God and cuz we cannot know God
[46:23] without having an experience you know
[46:25] yeah they had something to stand you
[46:27] have to have something to lean on that
[46:29] you say that hey from that time you know
[46:32] God has become real to me from that time
[46:34] I have known God and he's the same God
[46:36] and and therefore I can face any other
[46:39] challenge because I know that God is
[46:40] with me that's why David had
[46:43] the experiences you know he could have
[46:45] gone to so and tell you and and and
[46:47] rehearse
[46:48] you know those experience and then so we
[46:51] have confident in their feel and when he
[46:53] was there he was not afraid because they
[46:55] knew that God was with him
[46:56] and the Prophet said that well this big
[46:59] Goliath walks out there that morning
[47:02] with all this great big crowds we though
[47:07] he's great big pounds after pounds and
[47:10] and Britain and breast plate he's big
[47:14] giant guards and everything worked out
[47:17] there and say made his great Boston said
[47:20] I defied the armies of Israel brother it
[47:24] happens it happens to fall on the wrong
[47:27] here and around the wrong ear that
[47:29] morning for him there was a little
[47:32] fellow standing out there know where he
[47:36] was it what we need tonight or this
[47:40] morning is somebody else who knows where
[47:43] they head what we need tonight is a man
[47:46] is men and women know who knows their
[47:50] position in cross Jesus and when the
[47:53] devil makes a big boat Heuer he makes it
[47:56] he makes his big boat he still making
[47:59] his boast with God who liest
[48:02] and we still got Davis to thanks be to
[48:05] God for that you know when you know your
[48:08] position they prophesy that even though
[48:10] the devil can come and make his big boss
[48:12] you know come to you and say hey you
[48:14] know I challenge you with this one I
[48:16] defy you you can't get it over you you
[48:19] know you can't get over this I got a
[48:20] challenge you I defy you I give you a
[48:22] sickness I give you you know pain I give
[48:25] you sufferings I give you Beatles I give
[48:27] you everything you know you can't get
[48:29] over it you know the devil a prophecy
[48:31] that we need David you know those people
[48:33] who can stand and say that hey you know
[48:36] I have experienced this with God and God
[48:39] is the same God able to do this you know
[48:41] cause he did it before and it's the same
[48:43] one over there because the Prophet says
[48:45] that God is the same yesterday today and
[48:47] forever and David was the man of faith
[48:50] but by Professor I Debbie was the man of
[48:53] faith and he knew where
[48:55] standing and he could easily tell so
[48:57] this experience because he knew God will
[49:00] back it up and and ago and he had that
[49:03] confident in God and the prophecy that
[49:05] he said but listen so he said I trust
[49:09] the Lord and I know even way long ago I
[49:13] took my slingshot and kill the lamb I
[49:16] killed a lion
[49:17] I killed a bear and and took his things
[49:21] right out of right out of the lab and
[49:27] took the lamb rod of right out of his
[49:30] mouth and when he rose up he slew him
[49:35] and he said and how much more will he
[49:39] give that answer uncircumcised
[49:42] philistine into my hand
[49:44] hallelujah there you are he know where
[49:48] he was standing he was a man of faith he
[49:52] believed God God was in him he knew he
[49:57] was anointed and and you know the same
[50:01] thing if you have yeah or if you're a
[50:03] Christian and if God hadn't elect you to
[50:07] be a Christian you will not be a
[50:09] Christian it's God's choice not yours
[50:13] no man seeks God no man seeks God at any
[50:17] time you haven't sought God but God I
[50:20] saw you it wasn't you calling for God it
[50:24] was God calling for you and when God
[50:27] called you is short he elected you he's
[50:31] sure he elected you you accepted the
[50:34] call he was justification and then you
[50:38] gave your heart to cross and he it was
[50:41] and was filled with the Holy Spirit and
[50:43] now you positionally placed in the body
[50:46] of Christ now if it made you quit your
[50:50] old man a bit you know old meet your old
[50:54] mean habit and as like a Christian how
[50:57] to they'll do that for you you know here
[51:01] your body cause it's a promise amen
[51:04] there you are you know when you know
[51:06] your position nothing can stand against
[51:09] the prophecy even you know there's even
[51:10] a quote that a prophecy that you know
[51:12] even cancer even everything nothing can
[51:15] stand against you you know we read last
[51:17] Sunday when we preached that the Prophet
[51:19] said that you know when you seek and the
[51:21] doctor tells you that today or you have
[51:23] you only have a few hours to live the
[51:25] prophecy that you don't have to accept
[51:27] it and if you don't have to accept that
[51:29] if you know your position you know the
[51:32] fifth that you're having cross because
[51:33] it's easy you know saying it's easy by
[51:36] believing it's another thing you know
[51:38] there's a song that says that faith
[51:40] unlocks the door you know we pray
[51:42] praying is easy you know praying you
[51:44] know words are easily spoken but faith
[51:47] is another thing because we have many
[51:49] people you know who testified that
[51:51] they're Christian we have many people
[51:54] who testify that have been with Christ
[51:55] we have many people who testify that
[51:58] they have had an experience with God but
[52:01] you know by faith but they don't but we
[52:02] find you know when they have problems
[52:04] when they have trials they don't have
[52:06] faith you know we have the tune of
[52:08] Israel in the earth in the desert you
[52:12] know in Egypt all of them had experience
[52:14] with God all of them saw how God created
[52:17] things all of them so how God said them
[52:20] free all of them you know so how God you
[52:24] know separated the Red Sea and they
[52:26] walked on dry land all of them so how
[52:29] God created the fourth for them all of
[52:32] them saw how God created water for them
[52:34] all of them had an experience you know
[52:37] most likely all of them you know my have
[52:40] you know they they have I can say that I
[52:42] have even more experienced up some of us
[52:45] do but but we see that when they can't
[52:47] but when they were challenged you know
[52:50] they're fair why because they did not
[52:51] have faith in God you know your
[52:53] experience you might have an experience
[52:55] but as long as you don't have faith in
[52:57] God you know that will not stand again
[52:59] you know your experience will become now
[53:01] a story I know God delivered me I know
[53:04] God you know created the water I know
[53:06] God you know man made me walked on the
[53:09] the dry land but but here is another
[53:13] experience where is the same faith that
[53:15] you had you know where's the same faith
[53:18] that you had but we need to have that
[53:19] faith you know in our entire life
[53:22] you know we need
[53:23] to have that fit there they can you know
[53:25] before God because God promised them
[53:27] Berlin but God never told them what they
[53:30] had to go through for them to get our
[53:32] land and they thought everything will be
[53:34] easy they thought that they will not
[53:36] have any challenge they thought that
[53:38] everything will be easy you know as God
[53:40] says that hey I give you this land so
[53:43] that we walked in that we walk in
[53:44] without a fire that we're walking
[53:46] without without you know without a
[53:48] challenge without anything and when they
[53:50] came and they saw those big man you know
[53:52] that was there and that in that city you
[53:55] know there be camp they forgot
[53:56] everything that God did for them you
[53:59] know they forgot all the experience that
[54:01] they had with God and when you forget
[54:03] your experiences you know you become
[54:05] weak when you forget your experiences
[54:08] that you have with God you become weak
[54:09] and the delicate is repair with you the
[54:12] Prophet one day is it all the story say
[54:15] it was playing he was praying for a
[54:16] blind man he prayed for the first time
[54:19] the blind man didn't see he prayed again
[54:21] for the second time he asked him he said
[54:23] that usually when I pray for the foot
[54:25] fall for a man for healing and if he
[54:27] doesn't if he's not here at the same
[54:29] place I tell him go and believe but he
[54:32] saw the desire that the young man had he
[54:35] wanted to see so bad and he prayed for
[54:37] him and he didn't see to the devil now
[54:39] be got be you know camp to his mind and
[54:41] tried to tempt him the Prophet said that
[54:43] the thing that he had to do was to
[54:45] remember the experiences that he had
[54:48] with God
[54:49] you know the Prophet was if we know it
[54:51] was remembering that all the experiences
[54:54] that God had with him and when he
[54:56] remembered those experiences that built
[54:58] up his faith you know when you remember
[55:00] those experiences they you know he had
[55:02] more confident and when he prayed again
[55:04] for the second time that man was healed
[55:06] and that's the same thing you may go
[55:08] through trials right now you may my you
[55:10] you know you might have challenges you
[55:12] might be sick you know the doctor
[55:14] telling you that yeah you can't get
[55:16] healed you might have things that you
[55:18] need to overcome but you know you need
[55:20] not if there now is the time to start
[55:22] thinking about what God has done for you
[55:24] in the past and when you think about
[55:26] what God has done for you the past then
[55:28] we start building up your faith that we
[55:30] start building up you're gonna feel
[55:31] you're confident and then you can go and
[55:34] fetch that devil and say that a devil
[55:36] I divided you before and then with God
[55:39] and I am still able to defy you again
[55:41] and if you only remember those
[55:43] experiences amen
[55:46] and and and the prophecy that you can I
[55:48] have a full foundation you cannot have a
[55:53] full foundation stand until you meet God
[55:55] so there is no way that you can say you
[55:58] can say that a I'm a child of God or I'm
[56:01] positionally placed you know in God's
[56:04] body without meeting him first
[56:06] everything has to start by meeting him
[56:09] first we see the Moses Moses was born
[56:12] with the gift Moses was born the Prophet
[56:16] says that Moses was born with the gift
[56:17] of faith but he had to have an
[56:20] experience with God to exercise that
[56:22] gift you know he was born it when he was
[56:25] born his mother was telling him you know
[56:28] about everything you know his mother was
[56:31] telling him how he had to set the
[56:33] children of Israel free and he went
[56:35] there and he was instructed by by the
[56:37] Egyptians and he was wrong and and he
[56:39] was smart you know with the with the
[56:41] Egyptian intelligence and he was
[56:44] well-trained and he thought that you
[56:45] know with the strength it was said that
[56:48] you know people we said the chin of
[56:50] Israel free but he forgot that he had to
[56:52] have an experience first you know and
[56:55] the Prophet says that the best way to
[56:56] serve God you have to have a bath you
[56:59] know an experience of God you know you
[57:01] have to know where to stand he says that
[57:03] one day when I was coming to church I
[57:06] was listening to in this sermon the
[57:08] Prophet said that was a young preacher
[57:10] and there was a young preacher who told
[57:13] his pastor he said that hey I need to go
[57:15] to school first you know to study the
[57:18] Bible and then he found out my bachelor
[57:20] degree on my daughter you know my
[57:21] bachelor degree and everything then I
[57:23] would go preach God and the pastor said
[57:25] that you don't need that you know the
[57:27] only thing that you need is to have an
[57:29] experience the Prophet said that's right
[57:31] you know we don't need all those
[57:32] bachelors we don't need all those things
[57:34] we just need people with the experience
[57:37] where they can say that I met God at
[57:39] this place and they can testify what I
[57:41] have experienced and if anybody here and
[57:44] if everybody here can testify can have
[57:47] the same thing you know we all can test
[57:50] five where we have met God you know we
[57:52] will see wonders and we will see things
[57:54] coming you know happening be among us
[57:56] you know we will see you know our
[57:58] miracles we will see you know wonders we
[58:01] will see God moving and the people will
[58:03] know that you know these guys and these
[58:06] people have met God and that they have
[58:08] been changed because they're watching
[58:10] you you know I was working I was at work
[58:13] you know working with a man you know it
[58:15] was my first time working with it just
[58:17] working and we were talking you know he
[58:20] understood that there was something in
[58:22] me that was different you know after the
[58:24] three days he stopped himself and saved
[58:26] me
[58:26] are you asked me a question if I was a
[58:28] Christian I said yes and I asked him why
[58:30] I said because you're different because
[58:32] my language is not like your language
[58:34] you know that's the you know that's the
[58:36] kind of experience you know that's the
[58:37] kind of things that we need you know we
[58:39] need to live a life of Christ not
[58:41] forcing it but yet to become natural you
[58:44] know you don't need to force it wherever
[58:46] you go you're living that life and you
[58:49] will have the same testimony everywhere
[58:51] and and that's the water when the
[58:53] prophecy that a Christian is to have the
[58:55] that the same testimony everywhere if
[58:58] I'm going to ask brother Frank about
[59:00] your testimony it will say the same
[59:01] thing and if I go ask brother Sam
[59:03] there's just a more LLL say the same
[59:05] thing and that will make you that that's
[59:07] what we need we don't need you know
[59:09] people who are based themself for all
[59:12] people you know who are followers of the
[59:17] crowd if you are with with sinners you
[59:19] become sinner and if you are with sense
[59:21] you become sense no we need people who
[59:24] knows where they stand
[59:26] you know no matter if they're living in
[59:28] a place where they're by themselves they
[59:30] can still you know bring the hollander
[59:32] to God and then the Prophet says that
[59:36] you save brother Brennan can I accept
[59:39] cross at my healer now he says certainly
[59:42] well they didn't then did someone ask
[59:45] him a question when what if in five
[59:47] minutes and what if I'm not feeling well
[59:51] in five minutes
[59:52] the Prophet says that you heal anyhow if
[59:56] you believe it you would ask me that
[59:58] question there is no question in your
[1:00:02] mind when you really
[1:00:04] you don't question it you believe it
[1:00:07] other people not questioning but you
[1:00:10] don't question it
[1:00:12] Goliath dragging Goliath says you see he
[1:00:18] was here last night and you didn't get
[1:00:21] here he was he was at the other meeting
[1:00:24] and didn't get here who is that answer
[1:00:28] Khan circumcised devil who is that devil
[1:00:32] that has no relationship with God at all
[1:00:34] who is that therefore that stands with
[1:00:37] nothing but defeated thing behind him
[1:00:40] his master was defeated recovery by a
[1:00:44] Lord and conquer hallelujah
[1:00:47] he's a bluff there that's all we won't
[1:00:50] believe him anymore down with him Jesus
[1:00:54] Christ
[1:00:55] Rob Satan everything he had he spoiled
[1:00:58] principalities and powers and dominions
[1:01:01] his domains reigns over the heavens are
[1:01:05] an earth and we are the subject of his
[1:01:09] domain my my that puts him where he
[1:01:13] belongs
[1:01:14] the devil thought they'd ever down there
[1:01:17] and Christ the victor you David you
[1:01:21] called elected anointed positionally put
[1:01:24] in the body of Jesus Christ but the
[1:01:27] baptism of the holy ghost Goliath you
[1:01:30] defeated a man he is defeated tonight
[1:01:33] and and if we all can stand and say that
[1:01:36] Goliath if this is defeated this morning
[1:01:39] you know we were you know we would not
[1:01:41] be you know nothing else we're coming
[1:01:43] our ways nothing else work on and look
[1:01:47] at how many even though we will you know
[1:01:49] look at how many of us are here and if
[1:01:51] we all can be together you know put our
[1:01:55] testimonies together and try to work
[1:01:58] together
[1:01:59] nothing will be nothing we're defeat us
[1:02:01] nothing will stand in our way you know
[1:02:03] if we all can be bound together in
[1:02:06] prayer and have you know this group of
[1:02:09] young people of testimonies you know who
[1:02:12] will have testimonies after testimonies
[1:02:14] nothing can stand in our ways and if you
[1:02:17] look at the
[1:02:17] Bible the New Testament you see that the
[1:02:19] book of Acts was is the only book that
[1:02:22] is not finished with an amen
[1:02:24] why because it's a book that needs to be
[1:02:27] continued it's a book you know that
[1:02:29] people needs to continue living the same
[1:02:31] book and and if you see and if we see
[1:02:34] the power of unity if we look at in
[1:02:37] Genesis chapter 11 verse 6 we will see
[1:02:41] the power of unity when people are
[1:02:44] together why why they can accomplish
[1:02:50] Genesis 11 verse 6 the Bible says and
[1:02:55] the Lord said Behold the people is one
[1:02:57] and they have all one language and this
[1:03:02] they began and this they begin to do and
[1:03:05] now nothing will be restrained for them
[1:03:10] which they have imagined to do why
[1:03:14] because they were all together they had
[1:03:17] all one language they had one objective
[1:03:21] they had one goal they had one thing one
[1:03:24] vision and God Himself say that nothing
[1:03:28] can be restrained from them you know
[1:03:31] they are able to do everything they can
[1:03:33] they're able to do everything they plan
[1:03:36] to do that's people who were not even
[1:03:39] Christian you know there were sinners
[1:03:43] but only by being together being unified
[1:03:48] God could have taken himself would have
[1:03:51] said that you know nothing can stop them
[1:03:54] from doing everything they wanted to do
[1:03:56] and God had to divide them for for
[1:03:59] stopping that accomplishment and what if
[1:04:01] we are Christians born of God you know
[1:04:05] Christian and and have the same faith
[1:04:07] have the same objective after the same
[1:04:10] goal have the same you know vision have
[1:04:12] the same language and what can defeat us
[1:04:16] what therefore can stand against us and
[1:04:19] say that we are not able to do you know
[1:04:21] why can't stand what can stand against
[1:04:23] us and say that if these people can't
[1:04:25] live the life they can you know if we
[1:04:27] all are together and if we all have
[1:04:30] wanted
[1:04:31] you know we will be able to accomplish
[1:04:33] everything because the Bible says that
[1:04:35] you know there's nothing impossible for
[1:04:38] them that believe everything that you
[1:04:40] believe as long as you have faith in God
[1:04:42] everything will be possible no matter
[1:04:44] how big it seems to be no matter how
[1:04:47] difficult that thing looks like you know
[1:04:49] it's all it only takes your faith the
[1:04:52] only takes of faith in God you know you
[1:04:54] know your position and you go to God and
[1:04:57] pray and God and God what we're
[1:04:59] certainly you know here you'll pray you
[1:05:03] know God promised that you know of
[1:05:04] Israel Palestine but they never told
[1:05:07] them you know why they had to go through
[1:05:08] you know God promised you things but he
[1:05:12] never told you why you have to go
[1:05:14] through so those little you know
[1:05:16] challenge that you have
[1:05:18] don't let this things discourage you you
[1:05:21] know you have a vision you have a
[1:05:22] promise go for it you know you have a
[1:05:25] vision you have a promise God promised
[1:05:27] you something go for it you know of
[1:05:30] course you will have trials because I
[1:05:32] remember long years ago I've read
[1:05:36] something the promise is that if you're
[1:05:38] doing something to go for God or if God
[1:05:40] has promised you something trials we
[1:05:42] always come you know you will always
[1:05:44] have challenge and that is the best way
[1:05:47] to know that God is behind it you know
[1:05:49] and whatever it is coming for the you
[1:05:51] know to your way on your way right now
[1:05:53] and he's trying to stop you from
[1:05:55] accomplishing while God has promised for
[1:05:57] you you know just have faith in God you
[1:06:00] know he promised it and he will do it as
[1:06:02] long as you have faith in God I mean
[1:06:05] doesn't matter what you have to go
[1:06:06] through even though you have to be sick
[1:06:08] even though the doctor has to say that
[1:06:10] this is your last day of living even
[1:06:13] though you see that you're a you wanted
[1:06:15] to do something and you don't have money
[1:06:17] at bills up to bills you know if God
[1:06:19] promised you something believe it and
[1:06:21] you will see it you know that you know
[1:06:23] of Israel never expected to see people
[1:06:25] you know who were you know who were are
[1:06:27] bigger than them because God has
[1:06:30] delivered them from Pharaoh so easily
[1:06:32] they didn't even have to fate you to
[1:06:34] fight and they thought that in the way
[1:06:36] that would a you know and everything
[1:06:38] will be the same thing but when they
[1:06:40] came before this trial they bear their
[1:06:43] fear and Wonder
[1:06:45] fear they're feared people who were
[1:06:47] fearing them because you see that when
[1:06:49] Joshua when the spy went to rehab where
[1:06:53] I began to tell them the testimony
[1:06:55] everywhere I had began to tell them what
[1:06:57] she heard and she told them that you
[1:06:59] know those people they fear you
[1:07:02] because they heard what God has done for
[1:07:05] you and your Goliath fear you because he
[1:07:08] is worried that they heard what God has
[1:07:10] done for you they heard why how God has
[1:07:13] set you free they heard our God has
[1:07:15] filled you with the Holy Spirit
[1:07:17] they heard how God has done things for
[1:07:19] you and they heard all of that and they
[1:07:21] know you and they fear you and and it's
[1:07:24] just as the prophecy is like a bluff you
[1:07:26] know it's just coming to trying to you
[1:07:28] know just trying to shake you a little
[1:07:29] bit and if you stand still you know God
[1:07:31] will make you you will go through if you
[1:07:33] stand still you will have everything you
[1:07:36] will have your possession you know just
[1:07:38] what you know after hearing what what
[1:07:40] Rahab said you know I imagine myself I
[1:07:43] mean you know just what I probably say
[1:07:45] that
[1:07:45] so why was all those people afraid of
[1:07:48] you know what they were afraid of people
[1:07:51] were afraid of them you know it's like a
[1:07:53] dog a dog is afraid of you but if he
[1:07:56] fears fear he will attack you and that's
[1:08:00] the same thing with the devil he's
[1:08:01] afraid of you you know the god he has
[1:08:04] been gone
[1:08:05] he has been conquered he has been
[1:08:08] conquered and and God conquered the
[1:08:11] devil you know recovery and and and he
[1:08:15] has nothing he doesn't have the power
[1:08:16] anymore and and he is fearing you so now
[1:08:21] what you have to do is to know where you
[1:08:23] stand to go and to remind him about what
[1:08:25] God has done in coverage to remind him
[1:08:28] about the position that he lost and when
[1:08:31] you remind him and when you have that
[1:08:32] faith nothing would stand against you
[1:08:34] you know in closing I want to say this
[1:08:39] as a lyric this are the lyrics from a
[1:08:42] song the song said the fight is on all
[1:08:45] Christian soldier face-to-face is
[1:08:48] stirring array with almost gleaning of
[1:08:52] gleaming and color streaming the right
[1:08:56] and wrongs engaged today
[1:08:58] the fight is on but be not weary be
[1:09:03] strong and his mind and in his mind hold
[1:09:07] fast if God before us his glory offer us
[1:09:13] will seek the victory which we sing the
[1:09:16] victor song at last we've got you
[1:09:19] rebound to the promised land resurrected
[1:09:24] Lord Jesus he's here now you believe it
[1:09:26] that's the Prophet asking the question
[1:09:28] the prophecy hallelujah there was on the
[1:09:32] move for Jesus the chief captain said in
[1:09:35] my name they shall cast out Devils they
[1:09:39] fail to get it 40 years ago but we
[1:09:43] coming now processing the land the same
[1:09:47] pillar of fire the same chief captain is
[1:09:50] leading the host of the Lord it's your
[1:09:53] land God promised to prosper you in Hell
[1:09:58] he gave you the body it's yours my
[1:10:02] it's your possession the devil is trying
[1:10:05] to take it over he hasn't got any
[1:10:08] authority to do it he's trembling
[1:10:11] tonight hallelujah great world of God's
[1:10:14] power moving in the building setting his
[1:10:17] trembling is it trembling Oh
[1:10:21] what if they only have faith his hearts
[1:10:25] about God it's melted in him
[1:10:27] why oh you say well the doctor said yeah
[1:10:33] but they realized that the host of the
[1:10:36] Lord is moving in now that's right no
[1:10:39] matter how high is what ah no matter how
[1:10:44] high is warded he may have warded out of
[1:10:49] the side of the doctor but he wasn't
[1:10:52] worthy out of the side of God he might
[1:10:56] be a great big Bluff to the medical
[1:10:58] science but here habla a big buff to God
[1:11:02] hallelujah if you only believe you know
[1:11:06] if you're honorable if God is here and
[1:11:09] the only thing is taking is
[1:11:12] your faith that's the only thing that
[1:11:15] can touch God you know this woman it was
[1:11:18] Bush she was was in blood
[1:11:20] everything was everybody was touching
[1:11:22] God everybody was touching Jesus people
[1:11:26] were touching Jesus even harder than her
[1:11:28] people were touching even the body of
[1:11:31] God Jesus people were that even the hand
[1:11:33] of Jesus people were touching all the
[1:11:35] PAS every part of Jesus but she didn't
[1:11:38] have to touch the part she only touched
[1:11:41] the garment the hand of the the you know
[1:11:43] they did the hem of the garment but what
[1:11:46] one make heard one made a touch a touch
[1:11:50] very special was because she had faith
[1:11:52] and that faith just God and took his
[1:11:57] virtue out of him and then and today if
[1:12:01] your faith can touch God is still the
[1:12:05] same God today to delivery if your faith
[1:12:08] can touch God is still the same God to
[1:12:11] dare to stand you know to stand for you
[1:12:13] if your faith can touch God is the steer
[1:12:17] still the same God to dare to set you
[1:12:19] free it doesn't matter whatever what you
[1:12:21] know what what you have done in the past
[1:12:23] it doesn't matter what you know what sin
[1:12:26] you have done how much how big it is if
[1:12:28] you are you if you can only have faith
[1:12:31] you know Calvary is there and the
[1:12:34] Prophet said that he never seen a man
[1:12:36] going to college and coming the same
[1:12:39] something has to happen either you have
[1:12:42] to be sealed with the seal of God or you
[1:12:44] have to be a seer you know with the seal
[1:12:46] of the devil
[1:12:47] you know something has been happening
[1:12:49] and if you can come to Calvary today you
[1:12:52] know if you can come to cover it today
[1:12:54] God is still the same God you know it
[1:12:57] doesn't matter what you're going through
[1:12:59] it doesn't matter how hard it is it
[1:13:00] doesn't matter how impossible it is God
[1:13:03] would still make a wish you know tread
[1:13:05] imagine the chin of Israel standing
[1:13:07] before the sea and seeing Pharaoh behind
[1:13:12] them coming none of them could have
[1:13:15] thought that God would make a way out
[1:13:18] you know people began to complain and
[1:13:21] they began to cry because the situation
[1:13:24] was bigger they
[1:13:26] what in their faith the situation were
[1:13:28] bigger you know then why did the
[1:13:30] authority they they they thought that
[1:13:32] the situation was bigger than God
[1:13:33] but Moses had faith and it took by the
[1:13:37] faith of Moses you know to God use the
[1:13:40] faith of Moses for the way out and if
[1:13:42] you can only have faith the Prophet says
[1:13:45] that you can have faith for you and even
[1:13:48] for your family you can have faith for
[1:13:51] them there were one time but I'll tell
[1:13:53] the story and then closed
[1:13:55] hey baby came to the altar and a prophet
[1:13:58] had to pray for support for him I forgot
[1:14:01] what sickness he had and his mother was
[1:14:03] there and the Prophet tell they told his
[1:14:05] mother said we can have faith for this
[1:14:09] baby you know and that is the same thing
[1:14:12] to death today you can have faith or we
[1:14:15] can have faith for someone that you care
[1:14:17] it the more we can have faith you know
[1:14:20] for anybody that you have in your mind
[1:14:22] any situation any problem if you can
[1:14:25] only have faith in God God will see God
[1:14:28] when you know God will make a way food
[1:14:30] if you can only have faith let's stand
[1:14:32] and brother friend will come you know if
[1:14:35] you can only have faith have faith in
[1:14:37] God you know that is the only thing that
[1:14:39] will set you free
[1:14:40] only thing faith nothing else
[1:14:43] [Music]
[1:14:55] bring to God
[1:15:04] like this it's Matthew chapter 18 verse
[1:15:22] 19 he says again I say unto you that if
[1:15:28] two of you shall agree on earth as
[1:15:30] touching anything that they shall ask it
[1:15:34] shall be done for them of my father
[1:15:36] which is in heaven so I'll repeat that
[1:15:40] part that if two of you shall agree on
[1:15:42] earth as touching anything that they
[1:15:45] shall ask it shall be done of them of my
[1:15:48] father and I just had this one quote
[1:15:51] that also came into my mind when he was
[1:15:53] speaking he says you just her brother
[1:15:57] branham he preaches he says this in the
[1:15:59] message influence of 63 he says you just
[1:16:02] put one or two good members in a church
[1:16:04] that's really on fire for God it'll do
[1:16:09] something for that church more than 40
[1:16:12] revivals you could have so if you just
[1:16:14] have two good members in a church power
[1:16:17] of unity and here we are more than two
[1:16:19] so if we could just get in one of four
[1:16:22] every time people got in one Accord the
[1:16:26] Holy Spirit came down in the upper room
[1:16:29] 120 people were filled with the Holy
[1:16:31] Ghost Paul in Silas when they go to
[1:16:33] Monaco the prison walls fell so we just
[1:16:37] have to be one Accord I know many times
[1:16:39] when we are at home school at work the
[1:16:43] week just goes by so fast and our minds
[1:16:46] are so preoccupied but just to need this
[1:16:49] moment just this moment that we have
[1:16:51] just try to concentrate yourself
[1:16:54] consecrate to God I know many of you
[1:16:57] asked for this
[1:16:58] to be able you know to have time to pray
[1:17:00] so just now after such a wonderful
[1:17:03] message has been preached let's just get
[1:17:06] in one Accord I believe in this place we
[1:17:08] can have a revival a new revival starts
[1:17:11] with the person in the church so if each
[1:17:13] and every one of us bring their revival
[1:17:16] imagine this place would be explosive so
[1:17:20] let's just sing this song just because
[1:17:21] he lives I can face tomorrow we are
[1:17:24] warriors just because of God because he
[1:17:27] won't have a future able to overcome
[1:17:31] just to say so let's just think this
[1:17:33] song a couple of times and then each and
[1:17:36] every one of us pray in your own way
[1:17:39] [Music]
