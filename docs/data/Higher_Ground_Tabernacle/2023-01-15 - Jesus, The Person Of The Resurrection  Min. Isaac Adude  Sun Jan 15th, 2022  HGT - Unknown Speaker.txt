turn our Bible still The Book of John chapter 11. [Music] oh my God brother John was supposed to be my interpreter this morning but something came up so he's not here so uh I would try my best to go even slower than I usually am just to make sure that everybody understands him so that we all can have a good time and go out with something from the Lord hey man let's uh turn to John chapter 11. 17 to verse 28. it's a it's a familiar story that you know almost everybody knows either you go you go to church or not or you've been to Sunday school or not I mean you know about the Story of Lazarus how you know God uh Jesus called him out and he was amen the Bible says in verse 17th then when Jesus came he found that he had laying in the Crave four days already now Bethany was night unto Jerusalem about 50 for Longs off and many of the Jews came to Martha Mary to comfort them concerning their brother then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary sat still in the house I mean I love this Martha didn't wait for Jesus to come in the house remember she went to the meeting and then verse 21 the Bible says that then uh about the verse 21 the Bible says that then Martha that then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if Thou Art if thou has been here my brother had not but I know that even now whatsoever that we ask of God God will give it thee amen amen here Martha is proving showing her faith it meant that she believes that if the Lord Jesus was there when Lazarus was still sick amen Jesus was going to stop amen he was going to stop uh our death human Lazarus will not die if Jesus was there verse 23 says that Jesus says unto her thy brother shall rise again and Martha saith unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection of the last day amen here she's talking about the resurrection of the Saints and the you know the end of everything but Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he leave and whatsoever leaveth and Believers in me shall never die Believers doubt this she saith unto him yet Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the son of God which shall come in the word in the world verse 28 and when she had said then and when she had said she went her way and called Mary her sister secretly saying the master is come and calleth 40. amen you may be seated and when this morning I have uh a little subject uh that we entitled Jesus the person of the Resurrection and then we'll try to teach a little bit uh about this verse of Saint John chapter 11 verse uh the of this uh Saint John chapter 11. amen here is talking about the resurrection amen because Lazarus was dead and and and and Jesus was called when Lazarus was yet still was yet sick but Jesus Took for long I mean the Bible says if you read the verse 5 it says that Jesus spent two days when he heard that Lazarus was sick instead of going straight to Lazarus Jesus didn't go straight to Lazarus I mean he was doing his own business and he was doing something else and he came when Lazarus was dead remember before we start uh as a background of my my my subject this morning I want to uh uh uh talk a little bit about the Trinity of God as Sons amen the Trinity of God the son because we know that the prophet says that God will come under three uh under three sons under three sons son's name I think that's how he goes I mean he says that the first one will be the son of the son of man the second one will be the Son of God and the third one will be the son of David then he says that between the Son of God and the son of David he has to come back again as the son of man so now we see here in John if you read in John chapter 1 verse one the Bible says that in the beginning amen let's go in and read it just to be sure the Bible says that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the saint was in the beginning with God as we preached it long time ago the Bible here the Bible is only talking about the beginning when the word started amen but thank God we had a prophet amen who had the spirit of an ego amen he was able to go back before the beginning saying that before the beginning before before God became the word amen he was a thought they meant that thought was was filling out the entire universe that thought was filling out the entire space amen but in order for him to create him and he had to condense himself amen into a form amen that that form that we call the logos the prophet said that the law goes amen it was it's like a white hallow amen it's a little form that Jesus I mean that God had to condense himself in that form Amen in order for him to start creating and then when he started creating that let there be light amen he started creating that letter be animals and and birds and sea and everything okay they told me just to slow it down it meant uh to be a letter be uh uh light and and everything it might that is when he became the word amen that is when John started recording that in the beginning was the word because before the beginning it wasn't the word before the beginning it was just a thought amen here it says that in the beginning was the word and that word was with God and the saint was in the beginning with God verse 3 says that all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and in him was life Amen in John chapter 11 it says that I am the resurrection and the life and to be said that in him was life and the life was the light of man and a large soreness in darkness and darkness comprehended it not Amen in that beginning that was the word it was the word amen here it says that that word lived Among Us amen thou word amen became a man in other words he became the son of man Jesus Christ the prophet and he lived Among Us amen he ate with us amen he fellowship with us amen amen he he was sick sometimes amen he was hungry amen he became a man he became the son of man amen and then at the cross amen at the cross when Jesus died because if you read the Prophet The Prophet says that the spirit of God came to Jesus when Jesus was baptized amen that's what the Spirit came because the that that's that's when the spirit says amen amen that's what John said amen that that he saw the spirit of God as a dove a life amen coming down on him amen that was when the spirit of God came to him amen and that Spirit left him he said amen before before he died on the cross because he had to die as a man so that Spirit left him and when it went and that Spirit came down as the Son of God which is the Holy Ghost yes uh Son of God Son of God feasted you Son of God which is the Holy Ghost amen and he will come back as the son of David and the Millennium still reign as the King of Kings yeah amen so the prophet here says that who is the son of man the prophetic elephants in the message is it uh it is the rising of the son the prophet says and to be waved again we realize in the last day according to Luke chapter 17 verse 30. that in the sun day again in the day that the s-o-n of men will be revealed I mean or waved again over the people Now who is the son of man in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh Among Us amen and that dwelling Among Us that is that that's the son of man it's the word being made flesh I mean yeah amen so now the Bible the Bible is telling us the entire Bible is telling us our three appearance of the son of man you see that the first time was with Abraham amen Abraham met him as a son of man amen remember when you went uh uh when you went when Sarah was in the tent uh amen amen amen God took himself a body created a body that he dwelt in jail remember and he went to visit he went to visit Abraham he might notice that before that amen you'll see that Abraham had Visions Abraham had had dreams Abraham Abraham heard the voice of the Lord amen but Abraham his body wasn't changed until he had to meet the behunters had to meet him the son of man amen and then as the prophet says that his back was turned against against the tent and when and when and when he gave them the promise of a son amen Sarah Sarah loved amen God was able to discern the the thoughts that was the the thought of Sarah amen but Sarah when when God told Abraham that why is Sarah laughing okay amen Sarah lied and said that she didn't laugh amen God was able even to kill Sarah right there in that same moment remember he couldn't do it because of Abraham amen you'll notice that Abraham's body and Sarah's womb was dead uh they are dead okay okay amen but when they met the son of man mechanism they had the promise amen of a resurrection to be brought back as young people amen right after that you'll notice that the Bible says that they went to a trip that they walked for miles and they went to that King Who Loved Sarah it's just amen that you find it in Genesis chapter 18 verse 9 and 14 I'm not going to read it okay uh uh Genesis 18 verse 9 to 14. and after and Jesus Jesus the second son of man amen you'll see that he was the son of man amen he revealed the secrets of the woman at the well amen he taught her about her great sins notice that every time that there is a son of man on earth a secret has to be revealed a secret has to be told amen with Abraham amen God told Abraham what Sarah was thinking and before he left amen himself says that shall I to Abraham my servant what I'm about to do so Jesus here you if you read and uh Jesus here the son of man amen amen he had to reveal the secret of the woman at the well he told her about all about her five husbands I'm pretty sure amen and when he died amen the Bible says that the day of the Resurrection he meant a resurrection happened he meant he died as one person amen but he rose up with many other sins amen that's another Resurrection with the son of man amen you will find it in Matthew chapter 50 verse Matthew chapter 27 verse 50 to 53 yeah and many bodies many bodies of the Saints slept a rose with him they called the senses amen so he promised in Luke chapter 17 30. at the day of the son of man amen everything that happens is supposed to be happening amen at the end of the day amen and God has to come as the son of man again for the Gentiles amen because their amen where Jesus came Jesus didn't come for the Gentiles amen Jesus came for his brothers the Jews amen but he had to give the Gentiles that same Grace amen he had to give them that same Revelation when he had to give them that same experience amen so he had to come back as the son of man the ministry of the son of man the minister amen so that's why you see that he sent us a prophet amen by the name of William Marion Williams he was a son of man because a prophet is a son of man amen a prophet is a son of man but he is the Son of Man by Jesus he is the son of man Jesus amen so he was a son of man amen revealing the son of man amen that doesn't make brother Branham the son of man assassins or he doesn't make brother Branham a god that is supposed to be worshiped or something yes amen but he was a vessel that God used Amen in order for God to accomplish the Perfection because God always works in three okay uh download Perfection amen and he's and and then through him amen the bride will have the rapturing faith amen through the sermons and through the messages amen the bride will have the faith amen for the resurrection amen amen because in first Thessalonians amen chapter four Iman is talking about the resurrection he meant the resurrection that is supposed to come amen amen you see that here that in every son of man Ministries you'll see that there is a secret that needs to be told that is to be revealed and there is a Rapture and I'm sorry there is a resurrection that needs to happen amen and here God also told us a secret the secret of the seventh seals amen if you notice that the seventh seal uh amen he was silent Amen in other words it was a secret and nobody can tell what's in the silence watching the silence and that secret had to be revealed to us that secret has to be told amen through the ministry of that son of man amen amen and and he says that because I leave you shall live amen because I'm alive you also will be alive amen because the bride is the word amen and the groom is also the word and one plus one equals you shall live awesome it was a certain death but because of Abraham across the Abraham God couldn't kill her man it wasn't that anything that Sarah did it wasn't but she wasn't dead but because of her marriage or something amen because God said that the day that you will eat from this fruit from this street that day you will die in order for him to redeem his bride I mean download the default he had to become equal to his wife amen so he also took that the Bible says that Jesus loved Mary and amen Jesus almost Jesus grew up with them amen he loved them so much amen by here Lazarus is sick and Martha sent people to go tell Jesus that your loved one is sick a mouth that the person that you love is sick as a human they tell you that there's someone that you love is sick amen you will stop everything and rush to that person amen you will cancel all the planes that you had and rushed to Aid that person amen by here with Jesus he was different but here he says that when he heard that he was sick he bought for two days in the same place so it looks like Jesus didn't care they said it looks like Jesus couldn't see the gravity of the situation amen here you see that the Pharisees they came to Mary and the sorry to comfort Mary foreign amen and some of them started to criticize Jesus that we thought that he loved this guy and we have heard about all the Miracles that he has done we have heard how we heal people but how come he couldn't do a single sacrifice for his for his loved one is amen but Jesus knew exactly what he was doing amen Jesus knew what the father told him he says that these things say it here and after he said unto them our friend Lazarus sleepeth but I go that I may wake him awake him out of sleep owns foreign 11. okay this is now here verse uh verse 15. the Bible says that and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there uh okay I am glad for your sakes that I was not there oh yes to the intent you may believe oh they they said it shows nevertheless let us go unto him amen here Jesus is saying that I'm happy that I wasn't there when he was sick because we serve the god that likes to show up sometimes we serve a God that likes to show off it meant sometimes you let the situation be become worse okay okay he likes when the situation becomes worse Amen to show off his power amen so now here Jesus comes amen Jesus knew that Lazarus was already dead now he's coming amen the Bible says that it was four days late according to the Romans law uh amen after three days the tomb shouldn't be open um to open the tomb after three days because the body has already seen corruption for me but Jesus here comes purposely after after three days the fourth day he shows up amen and then as we know Jesus that every word Jesus goes amen there is always noises the noises will reach the place before himself even goes to that place so this is the case here amen people already went to tell Martha that Jesus is coming before Jesus even showed up amen so now here you'll understand that Jesus didn't go to the house where Martha was the Bible said that Martha as soon as heard that Jesus was on his way amen she rose up quickly and went to meet Jesus said Lord if you were here my brother will still be alive [Music] amen she's showing to Jesus the faith that she had uh she's showing to Jesus that everything is possible to you amen that nothing is impossible amen so not Jesus she said Jesus here sees her faith amen and Jesus replied in verse 23. that thy brother shall rise again now Martha here she thought that Jesus was talking about the resurrection at the last days amen Martha here she thought that me and Jesus here is was talking about first Thessalonians chapter 4. amen but Jesus here was talking about the present time amen Jesus was talking about that situation there amen Jesus said to her that I'm not talking about the last the resurrection of the last day that I'm talking about this this time right here because I am the resurrection what we got our entitled from amen Jesus is the person of the Resurrection because you will understand that the resurrection is not an event amen but the resurrection is a person amen and that person is the Lord Jesus Christ amen Jesus says that I am the resurrection and I am the life and he that believeth In Me Is though he were dead a memory amen yet shall he live again amen now here verse 27 Martha and now she's punctuating everything that Jesus said with an amen amen she said yeah Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the son of God is we shall come into the world Amen so when you have a promise from God you see if it's available amen you always have to reply with an amen amen you always have to believe it you men have the faith like Martha Lord I believe that thou art the Son of God lord I believe that everything is possible Lord I believe that you are the person of the Resurrection Lord I believe that my brother should my brother will live again amen so when she said so she went her way party secretly to call Mary uh amen and here now I will stop a little bit there and try to um you see that here Mary and Martha represented the scents that were still alive who was already in the Tomb amen was representing the sins that are asleep and Jesus was representing the living word amen so here you have the sense dollar alive and you have the sense that are dead that are asleep and now you have the word amen because the Rapture amen is only for the bride the rapture it's only for the elected for the call out amen so now here the Bible says that and when she had said so she went her way party uh and called Mary her sister secretly Amen in other words it wasn't a public show I mean I'm not uh but it was in the secrets she went and called Mary Ellen and she says that the master is 4D because Mary was in the room with the Pharisees they met the Pharisees who did not believe in the Resurrection the Pharisees who did not believe in miracles the Pharisees who were there to criticize Jesus amen so Martha went to her in that room Amen in that chamber amen secretly to call her that the master is come and he's calling for you amen you see that the first sport was was was uh I'm pretty sure healing the second put was prophecy you see that those two pools it was a public show yeah healing and many people tried to imitate them they imitated the first pool they imitated the second Point amen but now the third one had to come amen which was not going to be a public show amen but he had to be a secret amen you had to go in the room and meet Jesus then you will have the Revelation amen because the third poor is the Revelation is the secrets amen so now here Martha she was working on that third pool she went in the secret Amen to call Mary amen she became the voice of the Resurrection amen Mary come out of this room it Mary come out of the Pharisees and go meet Jesus come out of my people come out of hurt my people foreign but in order for the resurrection to happen uh in I mean in all I mean amen Mary had to have that same experience that Martha had in other words hearing just what Martha said was not enough amen Mary also had to get out of the where she was and but he was making go meet Jesus personally amen go and be in contact with that person of the Resurrection amen so in order for the Rapture in order for the resurrection to happen amen you have to be in contact with Jesus amen it's the same thing with the Saints of all the scent of the Old Testament is some of them were prophets even some some of them were Warriors some of them amen some of them were preachers and some of them amen but you will see that but what they did or the the experiences that they had before is before amen couldn't get them couldn't help them to get out of the Tomb or to be resurrected but they had to meet Jesus amen they had to come in contact with the person of the Resurrection in order for them to rise in order for them to be resurrected again amen so you have to come in contact with him amen if you want to be among those people who will be changed even if you want to be among those people who will be resurrected amen you have to meet foreign was alone with Abraham yes amen she went he meant she talked to Mary alone telling her that there's a resurrection that's about to happen amen and now here at this last time that this is the the end of the days amen it's a personal revelation amen where you have to meet him amen here and now in verse 39 amen amen you see that Mary before that Mary went her way and to meet Jesus amen to have that same experience that marked ahead in verse 32 the Bible says that hear Mary saying that Lord if thou has been here my brother had not died amen you see that Jesus is telling uh uh it's telling Martha amen he's telling them to take away the Stone Age she started doubting a little bit amen it's it's normal amen sometimes it's human sometimes you know if you see the problem and and sometimes you get a little bit cold amen you see that Martha the sister of him amen said that lord it's already been four days and it started to think to to stinks but Jesus was there the word it meant to bring Martha back to the line it meant to restore the faith that Martha had amen here at verse 40 Jesus said unto her say that uh Satan

place amen first you have a voice you have a shout even getting people ready getting people together ready amen uniting the people getting ready that's why we assemble here this morning amen the second is the voice amen that same voice that called Lazarus out of the the tomb amen now the bride is the voice that he used to call that that he will use to call the bride the bride Le posa is the voice that is used to call the bride it the bride she became the voice of the Resurrection amen because Jesus was the person of the Resurrection Martha says that but Lord I know that even now Lord whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it thee is amen even now Lord everything that you will ask I mean it doesn't matter how the situation is hard I mean it doesn't matter how the situation

but God started restoring that boy amen one by one because of that spirit that was inside amen because of that Son of God that was inside of him and that Son of God didn't die when Jesus died so in other words amen we have the same Spirits we have the same Spirit as Jesus amen we have the same spirit that wasn't brother Brandon amen we have the same spirit that was leading all the prophets in the same spirit that was leading Moses The Same Spirit that was leading Paul let me speaking condition amen The Same Spirit that was leading Peter amen so that same if that same spirit is in US amen

receive the holy spirit amen helping them to have that same experience amen like Martha okay amen she had that experience amen she was oh Amen to call Mary it meant to say that Mary the master is

therefore go into the world preach the good news amen that God is no longer there that God is not dead amen that God is alive amen go preach the gospel give them the good news amen baptizing them amen in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ foreign and so you have to meet Jesus Amen in order for you to have a body change because the Bible says that in a moment Amen in a moment in the twinkling of an

moment to come amen there is a process before amen there was a processes of repentance being baptized in the name of the Lord amen and being with filled with the holy spirit amen there is a process

and he gave that in the name of the son that he will be named Isaac he was during that time because there is something that happens when you are at the table with him there is something that happens when you are feasting with Jesus that's why you will see that when Abraham saw Mercury gave him communion gave communion to Abraham and in the message who is this amen the prophet said that became Jesus amen Jesus was in America or the body of Jesus who revealed himself to us the Gentiles Jesus the last thing he did was to have communion with his disciples what was what brand of Smith's last
