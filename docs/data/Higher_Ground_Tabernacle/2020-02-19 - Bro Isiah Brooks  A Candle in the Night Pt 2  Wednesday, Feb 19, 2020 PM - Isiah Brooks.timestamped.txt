[14:58] fantasy our brothers made it back safely
[15:00] and we appreciate the Lord Jesus taking
[15:06] them over the dangerous streets and
[15:08] highways Amen a lot of people travel but
[15:11] they leave home and not return so even
[15:15] so it's always a blessing when God can
[15:21] bring you back a man we're just going to
[15:25] try to finish up on the message a candle
[15:30] in the night and we're dealing with vast
[15:34] I vasty however you want to pronounce it
[15:45] we realized by God grace how tests and
[15:50] trials come to us all that God expects
[15:54] us to make the right choices one of the
[15:59] things that I know about God he he
[16:02] places in his word that we should love
[16:05] him above all things even ourselves the
[16:11] bride of Jesus Christ will always put
[16:15] Christ first we want you to turn with us
[16:20] by God's grace - let's just go to one
[16:27] scripture here Colossians 3 Colossians 3
[16:32] 2 and 4 and we'll read the scripture
[16:37] there we'll go back to s10 abut in a bit
[16:42] there's a lot of things that could be
[16:44] said as I said when I started with the
[16:47] book of Esther there's so many things
[16:48] that could be said it's a book it's just
[16:50] full of things the types and shadows but
[16:54] right now I'm just dealing with those
[16:56] little simple things we're making the
[17:00] right choices
[17:03] the right choice could mean a matter of
[17:06] life or death sometimes you don't know
[17:10] when that last choice is being made
[17:14] that's why we should always go by the
[17:18] leading of the Lord and when we know God
[17:20] is talking to us we need to be obedient
[17:24] Colossians 3 2 2 4 set your affection on
[17:28] things above not on things of the earth
[17:31] for you are dead in your life is hid
[17:34] with Christ in God when Christ who is
[17:38] our life shall appear then shall ye also
[17:43] appear with him in glory
[17:49] let us pray
[17:51] father we thank you for your grace and
[17:53] your mercy we thank you for being so
[17:56] good to us
[17:57] you have been better to us than we have
[18:00] been to ourselves there are no words to
[18:03] express our gratitude tonight forgive us
[18:07] Lord of being a little tired but I know
[18:11] you are our strength and we just believe
[18:15] you will touch this body Lord and how
[18:21] Souls encouraged we thank your father
[18:25] for the power that lies within us and we
[18:28] realize how God is it's your Holy Spirit
[18:30] that keeps us alive grant us victory
[18:33] tonight we ask these things in Jesus
[18:36] Christ's name we pray amen
[18:38] you may be seated
[18:45] I was just listening to the prophet of
[18:47] God and he was telling us about this
[18:50] lady who knew at that time she was
[18:54] supposed to give her heart to the Lord
[18:56] and she failed to do so and on her way
[19:04] home she got an accident but before she
[19:12] the car the approaching car hit her she
[19:14] sent to her daughter I did wrong tonight
[19:18] and I know I did and then the car came
[19:25] and she was killed in the accident I
[19:28] don't say these things to scare anyone
[19:33] or to bring in a fight but I do know by
[19:36] God's grace we for certain don't know
[19:39] the last moments of time that's why I
[19:43] read that scripture set your affection
[19:45] on things above we understand what it
[19:51] means to be born sinners now we need to
[19:56] know what it means to be born Saints
[19:59] because when we were sinners we did
[20:02] whatever came to our mind to do we did
[20:04] it and like I said most of us we enjoyed
[20:08] doing sin because that was our nature
[20:11] like a pig that enjoyed mud that's the
[20:15] way we were
[20:16] but God rich in mercy saw us and he knew
[20:23] that it was something about us that was
[20:26] different from the others one thing I
[20:29] know about the Lord the Bible declare he
[20:31] knows them that I hear
[20:33] I'm so glad about it because God knew I
[20:38] was hears before I knew he was ours ears
[20:40] and because of his grace he has brought
[20:44] us thus far when I think about what went
[20:48] on there in King Ahasuerus day I don't
[20:54] think a lot of us realized the the thing
[20:57] that was going on because it was
[20:58] somewhat
[20:59] today like we have now it's because you
[21:02] know if you look in the scriptures you
[21:05] don't see God hardly mention at all
[21:09] the setting is about a king and a queen
[21:12] a king who was looking for a bride or
[21:18] someone who could really glorify him you
[21:23] see the beauty of Adam was Eve she was
[21:28] the beauty she was a glory of a husband
[21:31] but she spoiled that and of course
[21:35] because she did that this is why we are
[21:38] who we are but God in these stories and
[21:43] these are more than stories they were
[21:44] historical events that were taking place
[21:46] and these people didn't even know that
[21:48] they were writing Scripture
[21:50] just by their lives and we find out that
[21:54] think about vesti who or was a queen
[21:59] I mean come on it's like you're in the
[22:01] right place at the right time and
[22:05] sometimes we get to the place we forget
[22:09] we think Laura ourselves than we ought
[22:11] to and whenever you come to a place like
[22:15] that you know that somewhere a fall is
[22:18] coming because that's the way it was
[22:22] with Vashti she thought more of herself
[22:25] so you can never think that your will
[22:28] would supersede God's will God's will
[22:33] will be done and often time when he
[22:37] can't get you to do his will then there
[22:39] are consequences that follows think
[22:44] about it when Saul was told to kill all
[22:46] the animals and the king and everything
[22:48] else and he reasoned with in his mind
[22:51] that God needed something from him God
[22:54] don't need nothing from you other than
[22:57] obedience but saw him and thought that
[23:00] he would give God the best
[23:02] how can you give God the best when God
[23:06] has all that he needs God is not someone
[23:09] that is need in needful God is whole
[23:12] even as he is and we find out that
[23:16] that's what happened we find out that
[23:17] that's what happened to many of us
[23:20] sometimes God blesses us put us in a
[23:22] good place
[23:23] and we forget where we came from I don't
[23:27] know where vasty came from but evidently
[23:32] she was in a better place in the King's
[23:35] Chamber in the king's palace than she
[23:38] was before she got there but somehow she
[23:41] forgot and see that is the thing you can
[23:44] never think that you can't be rejected
[23:47] so what do you mean Paul says I must be
[23:50] careful lest I myself will become a
[23:54] castaway so we get to a place when you
[23:57] think that you've got it all down packed
[24:00] that is the time that you ought to be
[24:02] way because the Bible says take key when
[24:05] you stand right you got to be careful
[24:09] that your your stand is a stand of
[24:13] humility and a stand of humbleness
[24:16] because whenever we allow pride to get
[24:19] into the equation we're up for a fall
[24:23] and this is actually what fasted thought
[24:26] let me tell you something that spirit is
[24:28] a strong spirit it is among a lot of
[24:32] churches not only this denominations but
[24:35] among thee the message believers too
[24:37] because like I said the last time we
[24:39] spoke
[24:40] sometimes we get the spirit of you know
[24:43] the Pharisees like we're better than
[24:46] everybody else and you see that's when
[24:49] you are setting yourself up for fall
[24:53] hallelujah
[24:54] understand the prophet of God when he
[24:57] was here on earth he ministered and his
[24:59] brothers and sisters were of every brand
[25:02] he never separated himself and he loved
[25:06] people for who they were not what he
[25:09] wanted them to be whenever he found
[25:12] somebody that loved God he was attracted
[25:15] to that person regardless to who they
[25:18] were I listen to tapes all the time and
[25:20] I get to I get in my mind what went
[25:23] wrong and the problem
[25:26] is that we come to a place we call
[25:29] ourselves bride
[25:31] but listen vest I was queen
[25:35] she was already the wife Israel was not
[25:40] at times the wife and because of her
[25:43] disobedience God divorced her Israel
[25:46] will want to vote the wife of God and
[25:49] God divorced her because of her
[25:52] disobedience God is a holy God and right
[25:56] now we're living at a time where God is
[25:58] calling for holiness let me tell you
[26:01] something there is no way you're gonna
[26:03] get to heaven without fighting you're
[26:05] going to fight you must fight every inch
[26:10] of the way you must fight is that right
[26:13] he told Joshua I have given you the
[26:15] kingdom I've given you the land mother
[26:18] but you must fight you must fight pay
[26:22] every inch fight is yours but I want you
[26:26] to fight for it that's what happened you
[26:31] know we become complacent and when we
[26:33] become complacent you know we're in a
[26:36] danger zone I was telling the Lord and
[26:40] I've been praying for revival here in
[26:43] this little fellowship but I know that a
[26:47] man or woman who whoever they may be you
[26:50] can't have a revival unless you really
[26:51] want one and don't you know you have to
[26:54] fight for it because we're living in
[26:56] Laodicea
[26:58] this is the age we're living in we are
[27:00] being anointed by that spirit every day
[27:03] to be lukewarm to feel like you have
[27:07] need of nothing and we are in a place
[27:10] where we need everything everything and
[27:14] I'm not ashamed to say it but every day
[27:17] I pray for more God every day sometimes
[27:23] in the morning early mornings and things
[27:25] like that God wakes me up I'm praying
[27:27] I'm seeking God I'm crying out to God
[27:30] and saying Lord what what what what
[27:32] because I want to know what can I do
[27:34] what what must I do
[27:36] amen to make this perfection in which I
[27:38] feel the pool
[27:40] I don't know whether you feel the pull I
[27:41] feel a pull something's pulling me more
[27:46] now than ever before
[27:47] keep pushing keep pressing do I fall do
[27:51] I stumble every day somehow someway but
[27:55] I say immediately law forgive me I'm
[27:59] coming just a moment see I'm coming back
[28:02] to vaster because remember I said vast
[28:04] it means to be drunk to drink and she
[28:07] represents the drunken church but not on
[28:10] the Holy Spirit but on drunken on
[28:13] worldly things
[28:14] drunken on the blood of others
[28:17] hallelujah and that's where we are now
[28:20] the churches are drunk people are drunk
[28:22] because they can't discern the time most
[28:26] people when they're drunk they date they
[28:28] don't even know who they are they don't
[28:30] know what they supposed to be they don't
[28:32] know how to walk a straight line they
[28:35] are forever twisting and turning right
[28:38] because they have been in fact affected
[28:40] by something other than the Holy Spirit
[28:43] somebody help me here see what we don't
[28:47] realize is that these things that Satan
[28:50] is fighting with us with their common
[28:52] things they're things that that that
[28:54] that are common to men and they all fit
[28:57] in the three categories that love the
[28:59] lusts of the flesh lust of the eye and
[29:01] the pride of life and these are the
[29:04] things that we you and I must overcome
[29:07] blessed is the overcomer and as I said
[29:11] they men when we talk about overcoming
[29:13] that means you've got to fight yeah
[29:16] God is not gonna pull you through a tube
[29:18] God is not gonna just make it easy for
[29:20] you well sir and guess what
[29:25] he leads you into the battles he brings
[29:28] you into the tests and he expects you to
[29:32] overcome you understand me
[29:35] so when you don't never you never know
[29:38] when that last moment that choice it's
[29:42] going to be your last choice or your
[29:44] last time of failure because I think
[29:47] that vasty had had it so well she rose
[29:51] up within herself
[29:53] and that's what a lot of times he what
[29:55] is that what is the call for the hour
[29:57] come unto me all ye that are laden and
[30:01] heavy laden and I will give you rest
[30:03] take upon you take upon you my yoke
[30:07] right because my yoke is easy my burden
[30:10] is light
[30:11] right so you got to understand it is
[30:14] it's come unto me not me Jesus Christ
[30:17] it's not come to the church come to the
[30:21] preacher no sir let me tell you like
[30:24] this and this is what has happened to a
[30:26] lot of people they have an adopted the
[30:29] thought in their mind that a system is
[30:31] going to save you no system can save you
[30:35] hallelujah
[30:36] it doesn't matter where you belong to
[30:38] the group that believed that Malachi 4:5
[30:41] is it doesn't matter you see in it
[30:44] you're not called to that you got to go
[30:48] beyond that is that right it was John
[30:52] who called but then when when they came
[30:55] to John John said this is not the
[30:57] stopping point here is Jesus he is the
[31:01] Lamb of God who takes away the sins of
[31:03] the world follow him you see what I'm
[31:07] saying and I follow our leadership must
[31:10] be by the Holy Spirit hallelujah glory
[31:15] to God
[31:16] you know if fart is hard to find
[31:18] spiritual people anymore
[31:20] people want to talk about everything but
[31:22] Jesus they want to talk about everything
[31:24] other than the word you know what did
[31:27] God do for you today but we find out the
[31:30] people of troubles they love to talk
[31:32] about troubles and things that goes on
[31:34] in the world folks it is time to get God
[31:37] on your mind hallelujah if vasty had had
[31:42] sheep what happened to she lost love for
[31:45] her husband her Queen duties as that's
[31:51] what had happened her Queen ship had
[31:54] became become duties duties do this do
[31:59] this do this enemy so there was no love
[32:02] left when the King called for her so she
[32:06] basic
[32:07] you know denied him not realizing it was
[32:12] going to be a fatal mistake
[32:15] whenever Christianity becomes just
[32:18] duties to you you're backslidden
[32:21] I must go to church because it's my duty
[32:24] I must pay my tithing because it's my
[32:28] duty hmm y'all understand me whenever it
[32:31] comes to that place you are backslidden
[32:35] because it should never be duties
[32:39] hallelujah he said if you love me you
[32:43] keep my Commandments huh
[32:46] and that's what's happening you see the
[32:48] emptiness that's going on with the
[32:51] people of God that's supposed to be
[32:53] brighter you don't want to be why but
[32:55] what has happened is they have lost
[32:57] their love and like I was telling the
[33:00] Lord the other day I said Lord restore
[33:03] me where you are my first love y'all
[33:08] remember when God when you first fell in
[33:11] love with him oh my god nothing could
[33:15] keep you from Church nothing can keep
[33:17] you from prayer nothing couldn't keep
[33:19] you from reading you rejoice I did
[33:22] whether being street or in school it
[33:25] didn't matter because I was so in love
[33:29] with him you know how it is when you
[33:32] first get married and everything else
[33:34] always just love you know what I mean
[33:36] you hear the birds singing and all that
[33:42] and and that's what happened after a
[33:45] while if you don't keep the fire going
[33:47] it becomes duties and every marriage
[33:51] suffers it you go through that period of
[33:54] time and somehow you have to regroup and
[33:57] make it live again come on it's the
[34:01] truth you call that revival hallelujah
[34:06] every marriage has to be revived and
[34:08] what is it most of the time you have to
[34:10] take away your selfishness get away that
[34:13] get all the trash out and bring it back
[34:16] together but it has to be on both parts
[34:19] hallelujah
[34:21] now brother Bellamy talk about how in
[34:24] the marriage supper of the lamb how when
[34:26] things become duties he said it's wrong
[34:28] he says now you're living a lie and
[34:31] that's how it is with Christians when
[34:34] life the Christianity becomes a duty now
[34:38] you live in a lie a lie
[34:40] it must be love that compels you to live
[34:44] for Christ hallelujah
[34:48] it cannot be well if I don't I'm gonna
[34:51] go to hell or if I don't you know what
[34:53] I'm sayin something Bad's gonna thats
[34:55] not the right attitude I'm talking about
[35:00] nasty cause here's when she made that
[35:05] that statement that she wasn't gonna
[35:08] come to the king
[35:09] she list up see that's what happens to
[35:14] us when we fail to come to the king not
[35:18] to brother Brooks not the higher ground
[35:21] Tabernacle you must find Jesus you must
[35:26] come to him you must know him right when
[35:31] we say in turn to the Chamber be free
[35:34] we're not talking about entering my
[35:36] chamber into the into the the table of
[35:38] this place with all my gone into the
[35:40] Holies of Holies don't stop people of
[35:45] God it's rough right now it's hard right
[35:48] now it's a real press but you got to
[35:52] keep going because the test is given to
[35:56] you so that you can show yourself how
[35:59] much you won't heaven it is by grace but
[36:02] God has given us the grace to press on I
[36:07] think about Paul often and I think oh my
[36:11] god Paul Paul you'd never seen him
[36:14] complaining I've been beaten he said
[36:18] I've been you know dead and
[36:21] ship-wrecking you know I've been among
[36:23] false brethren food I don't know which
[36:26] one I'd rather best false brethren of
[36:28] the shipwreck but never less Paul
[36:33] it out hallelujah but Paul said I
[36:37] learned some things I learned how to be
[36:39] content and learn how to be obeys
[36:41] hallelujah I've learned hallelujah to be
[36:44] content in every position God put me in
[36:48] and that is battles wherever God put me
[36:53] I'm gonna be content if I'm in a battle
[36:55] I'm gonna be content and I'm on the
[36:58] mountaintop Valley wherever he places me
[37:01] see now you're growing I'm mature person
[37:06] and you know we're not pouting like kids
[37:09] you know we're growing up now coming to
[37:14] a place where we understand God is in
[37:16] control is eat our head huh think about
[37:19] it now I'm saying something this look
[37:22] look at this thing because service to
[37:25] God is something that must be volunteer
[37:28] you must voluntarily do it nobody should
[37:32] compel you and I think about the woman
[37:35] you know Mary when she got an alabaster
[37:38] bastard box how she ran to Simon's house
[37:41] and she was determined you understand me
[37:45] not liking it as to church she was
[37:48] determined and it Celeste them to be to
[37:50] be learned because when you come to
[37:52] church and you determine to get
[37:54] something from God he's gonna give it to
[37:56] you she was determined she didn't let
[38:00] all the coal and starchy people at
[38:02] Simon's house stop her right she had her
[38:05] heart and mind focused she saw Jesus he
[38:08] saw his dirty feet and she went to work
[38:11] hallelujah and some of us ought to be
[38:13] zealous enough to get here and you see
[38:15] how when it's dead in here put some
[38:17] screams in the air that's true
[38:21] don't go coming or it was dead in church
[38:23] wherever was dead in church and you was
[38:25] there and it was dead that means you was
[38:27] dead too right hallelujah somehow
[38:32] somehow you got to put some action in
[38:35] here I'd know one thing it takes one
[38:37] match to light a fire but anyway she
[38:44] didn't care she went to work and guess
[38:46] what
[38:47] God was waiting on her gotta let you
[38:50] worship him any you would have jumped
[38:52] shout run dance whatever he let you do
[38:55] it and at the end of the day guess we're
[38:57] gonna say what do you want what would
[39:01] you have of me see that's what a lot of
[39:03] time we fail to see those no simple
[39:05] lessons in in there we got bills to pay
[39:08] we got something to carry on you know me
[39:11] and we fail to see that the answer is in
[39:14] worship the answer is in worship the
[39:21] Bible said he indwells he inhabits the
[39:23] praises of his people we know that and
[39:26] we still won't do it God don't want your
[39:30] duty hear about it raise your hand why
[39:34] should I have to say that I remember I
[39:40] was out in and I'm coming out I was out
[39:42] in Arizona and the man the guy who was
[39:51] doing the conducting oh I got so angry
[39:54] he said uh y'all get up in stretch I got
[40:04] in trouble they told us not to say night
[40:08] we supposed to come up there and just
[40:10] saying yeah and being a preacher I
[40:12] couldn't help it I say get up and
[40:14] stretch I said everybody in here a shame
[40:18] with yourself I said there's a time that
[40:22] the church used to be oh so far oh so
[40:24] much Oh fire you'd have to tell them you
[40:27] may be seated
[40:28] now you tell them get up and stretch
[40:32] talk about backslidden come on somebody
[40:36] what kind of stuff is that anyway let me
[40:40] move on I don't know how come God got me
[40:41] here but I won't I want to say this by
[40:44] God's grace vasty gots it got so common
[40:47] Christ became so common and understand
[40:51] people get to a place they are ashamed
[40:54] of him you know whatever God strike you
[40:57] and you move you know what he's getting
[41:01] he called you into this assembly so he
[41:04] could show you off oh yeah is that right
[41:09] King Ahaz Laura called vasty in to show
[41:13] her off because to her she was the
[41:18] greatest prize of all that he had he had
[41:21] gold and silver he had diamonds he had
[41:24] rubies but the greatest of his treasure
[41:26] was his wife and so is it with God in
[41:29] you the greatest of his treasures are
[41:32] you that's why the devil fights you so
[41:36] much you're gonna be thought and
[41:40] sometimes you're gonna lose but he
[41:43] expects you to get up he expects you to
[41:47] get up the just man falls seven times in
[41:50] a day and he gets up the reason why we
[41:55] must stay on fire and who will not on
[41:58] fire we need God to relight the fire why
[42:02] because when you're dead everybody else
[42:05] become dead you understanding the
[42:09] influence of a dead spirit I used to
[42:13] call it like this the influence of a no
[42:16] worship demon yeah people are afraid to
[42:23] worship hallelujah but it's true that's
[42:27] how it starts a little corner starts and
[42:29] that comb is your spreads all over the
[42:32] place just like fire would do so why not
[42:36] bring the fire right set your affection
[42:41] on things above every time I think about
[42:44] that I think about my loved ones that's
[42:48] going on and I think about how important
[42:52] it is for me to meet up with them and
[42:55] how by God's grace I know they're there
[42:58] by faith you understand me
[43:01] I'm not talking about you see people a
[43:03] lot well I don't know whether I got some
[43:04] gold in the in the treasure I'm not
[43:06] talking about that you know the greatest
[43:08] treasure I got up there
[43:11] my relatives who made it that's what I'm
[43:14] looking forward to seeing them you said
[43:16] what do you mean remember brother
[43:17] Bosworth when he got ready to die the
[43:22] story was told that he was laying there
[43:25] almost like in a coma and all of a
[43:26] sudden he came up right he woke up and
[43:30] before he died he started shaking hands
[43:32] with his loved ones the converse that he
[43:34] he had won to the Lord
[43:36] y'all don't y'all believe that I believe
[43:38] that I know it's real
[43:40] hallelujah let me tell you something if
[43:43] you've never seen a demon or if you've
[43:45] seen a demon if a demon exists then God
[43:49] does too right and I've seen like I said
[43:54] you say well what do you mean brother
[43:56] books I'm saying you think about it
[43:58] right what what something but what it is
[44:01] sir to allow your family to know that
[44:04] you're going up just like sister Matthew
[44:07] over there in Ohio before she died the
[44:12] Lord came in and showed himself even the
[44:15] grandkids saw the supernatural weeping
[44:20] and everything when when their mom and
[44:22] grandma left out of the room see that's
[44:25] where I'm talking about
[44:26] I never sister who was there in Arizona
[44:30] and they said y'all go pray y'all
[44:35] preachers let me go into the hospital
[44:36] and pray for her
[44:38] and God told me no don't go cuz she's
[44:40] going home today I don't know what he
[44:43] said today but he told me she was going
[44:45] home gonna back that up but nevertheless
[44:47] I didn't go and they told me that when
[44:52] the preachers got there before the
[44:54] preachers got there all of her children
[44:56] were gathered in the room none of them
[44:59] told the other that they were going to
[45:01] see mom all of them were there she was
[45:04] laying there when the last one came in
[45:06] the room she all of a sudden woke up out
[45:08] of the coma and she began to tell them
[45:12] of her loved ones she was there talking
[45:14] about who all she's seen and all of that
[45:17] stuff and all of a sudden she broke out
[45:20] an amazing grace fell back and went on
[45:22] home see
[45:23] that's what I'm talking about the land
[45:26] is real it's worth the battle it's worth
[45:31] making the choice I live for it
[45:41] but in order to make this journey you're
[45:43] gonna have to pray mm-hmm you gonna have
[45:47] to pray you're gonna have to pray when
[45:51] you first get anointed is that right let
[45:54] me say it like this remember when when
[45:56] when Esther who was uh when Esther was
[46:01] chosen and and and they had to go
[46:06] through a purifying stage a cleansing
[46:09] stage I don't know what it is about
[46:10] Christians they don't they won't be
[46:12] halfway clean no God is calling for a
[46:18] full cleanse it's not this out with
[46:23] thing anybody can look make this look
[46:25] good he's working with the heart the
[46:28] heart must be clean
[46:30] only the pure in heart shall see God
[46:35] brother Branham brings out in the
[46:37] marriage of the Lamb he said that's what
[46:40] else to did that's how she ant outran
[46:43] the other girls she cleansed her heart
[46:47] he said well the way I dress doesn't
[46:50] make any difference yes it does because
[46:53] those girls amen they put on all those
[46:56] worldly attire and they thought they
[46:58] were do you know if he thought the
[46:59] worldly beauty was gonna appeal to God
[47:01] God don't care about that all
[47:04] righteousness not that dumb is it filthy
[47:06] rags to God what about a man who can't
[47:09] afford a nice clothes but it's hard is
[47:12] right hallelujah and that's what it is
[47:15] God wants you to cleanse your heart how
[47:18] by the washing of the walk by the water
[47:20] of the word this Bible will help you get
[47:24] clean is that right so that's what
[47:28] happens she cleansed her heart
[47:33] everything ryukenden and the others are
[47:37] Chamberlain's were telling her to do she
[47:39] did it this is the beauty of it because
[47:42] all those girls all of them were brides
[47:46] potential hallelujah they only became
[47:52] concubines after they had fellowship
[47:55] with the king you see what I'm saying so
[47:59] he's all praise God I had a wonderful
[48:02] experience with the Lord
[48:06] but what about today you can't go off
[48:12] and experience you had five and ten
[48:14] years ago that's nonsense
[48:17] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[48:19] and forever
[48:20] you suppose a heaven experience with God
[48:22] every day some way somehow if it's just
[48:28] him talking to you right remember some
[48:32] of those women may have had a wonderful
[48:33] time with kena has a rule that day but
[48:36] listen some of them were never called
[48:38] back they were just there and guess what
[48:44] there were his concubines and he could
[48:50] get another wife but he she couldn't get
[48:52] another husband somebody help me you
[48:55] understand me
[48:56] she was locked in that position and
[49:00] that's why I'm trying to tell you
[49:01] because everybody says I'm bride I'm
[49:03] bride that don't mean nothing until the
[49:07] King favors you God must favor you and
[49:14] when God favors you guess what he calls
[49:17] on you you don't have to call on him he
[49:20] calls on you and he calls you by name
[49:25] hmm
[49:27] otherwise you could be just a concubine
[49:32] that's why I said peace a bride bride
[49:34] bride let me tell you something many a
[49:36] brides many a brides maybe a bride's now
[49:41] Laodicea used to be a bride she was
[49:44] rejected back Basti because she didn't
[49:48] come when the King called her
[49:51] louia and so will we be if we don't
[49:54] follow through this word like we
[49:56] supposed to we will be rejected these
[49:59] are all no I'm in the bride I followed
[50:01] mankind you know let me tell you
[50:04] something revelation 2:7 that's what
[50:06] exactly Israel did and guess what
[50:08] majority of them were put away you said
[50:15] we're brothers you shouldn't talk like
[50:16] this yes because I'm gonna tell you
[50:18] something no unclean thing is going to
[50:20] enter in play with the devil all you
[50:22] want to but the devil got a trick for
[50:25] you oh yeah
[50:31] God lets her get away with something but
[50:34] not all the time huh he's always calling
[50:39] for repentance but when you get to a
[50:43] place where you can't even repent you in
[50:45] trouble you better cry out for
[50:46] repentance oh yeah I know some people
[50:56] may not understand what I'm trying to
[50:58] say but one thing I know is that the
[51:02] Bible says the bride have made herself
[51:05] ready and when the bride makes herself
[51:08] ready that means you're doing something
[51:10] you got to do something God doesn't do
[51:14] everything for you he'll show you how to
[51:16] do it right is that one time when my mom
[51:19] was teaching me how to wash dishes
[51:21] she helped me but then there was a time
[51:23] she said you watched him and what'd she
[51:28] do afterwards
[51:29] make sure you watched him right I had
[51:34] one son one time I told him to go down
[51:36] go downstairs and and clean the shower
[51:39] out you know what he did he got Lysol
[51:43] and just threw it on the walls ran the
[51:46] shower and he said he it's clean it
[51:51] smelled clean but he never scrubbed
[51:55] anything guess what he had to do it it
[52:00] ain't that just spraying stuff on stuff
[52:02] to make it clean you got a wash
[52:04] you got a scrub you understand me oh
[52:07] come on somebody sometimes the whole
[52:09] egos have to put some real impress some
[52:11] real pressure on you to get help you
[52:14] clean up yourself let me talk about
[52:20] prayer now for a moment because you got
[52:22] to understand that this battle without
[52:24] without prayer you in trouble our
[52:26] warfare is not carnal its spiritual and
[52:30] I'm going to tell you something with all
[52:31] of the demons that's coming along in
[52:33] this world if you're not careful some
[52:36] sexual demon go grab you because this is
[52:38] what the world is all about everything
[52:44] is that right that's how it started
[52:47] that's how it's going to end since I
[52:53] think it's been one of you for a few
[52:55] minutes ago when you were singing for
[52:59] you for you I am praying he said that's
[53:02] a what I want you to do here's it here's
[53:05] where I'm going is it's prayer that I
[53:08] depend on
[53:10] that's the secret i'ma say this again
[53:13] because I want you to understand you
[53:14] can't even really receive a a real
[53:17] revelation in your heart without prayer
[53:19] you can receive a revelation here but
[53:23] the revelation here doesn't work it just
[53:26] stimulates you your man your spirit man
[53:28] the revelation in your heart changes you
[53:32] that's what's happening with a lot of
[53:34] people right they're getting a
[53:37] stimulation but they're not changing
[53:40] this gospel supposed to transform you
[53:43] not conform you transform you change you
[53:49] from glory to glory to glory to glory
[53:53] that's why God told Timothy freely
[53:57] useful lust you think Timothy had
[54:00] problems he was young and you can't tell
[54:06] me what is not what it with you wow I'm
[54:09] so holy holy you young you keep your
[54:15] youth I'm glad
[54:17] I'm up in age now I know what it was
[54:22] like somebody helped me here
[54:25] y'all kid y'all looking at me like I'm
[54:27] stupid I know I've been there you can't
[54:30] play with the devil huh
[54:38] that's what I because listen y'all got
[54:49] show-and-tell
[54:51] we didn't have show-and-tell
[54:53] it was hide-and-seek but now y'all got
[54:56] show-and-tell everywhere you go so I
[55:03] feel sorry for you but you this is your
[55:05] day oh my god listen let me move on see
[55:12] that's the secret of all the mysteries
[55:15] of God that's the key that opens the
[55:19] door to everything of God is prayer tell
[55:24] me that's not where the devil fight you
[55:26] the most it's prayer cuz you get on your
[55:32] knees and you don't feel nothing
[55:34] sometimes and you feel like God in
[55:36] nowhere with you naughty metal at the
[55:38] ceiling of your house but when did God
[55:41] say feel me and I'll be there you know
[55:46] you don't have to feel him he's with you
[55:49] look at this that's God he is a breath
[55:56] he's always with you that's why the
[55:59] Bible said he is near thee naívi even in
[56:02] your mouth and they'll be glad he is
[56:04] because if he wasn't you'd be dead that
[56:08] breath is a it's a sign that God is with
[56:11] you is that right but you must pray
[56:19] listen this is what I say if Jesus had
[56:22] to pray you got to pray Dan you had to
[56:26] pray David had to pray asked I had to
[56:30] pray because
[56:31] God is going to bring priors on you and
[56:34] he said thinking that strange when
[56:37] divers temptations come upon you knowing
[56:40] that the trying of your faith is more
[56:41] precious than what gold because these
[56:47] trials have come to burn the world out
[56:50] of you he will do it if you want it
[56:54] don't say Lord I want to be like you no
[56:56] more because every time you say that you
[56:58] asking God for more it's coming can't
[57:03] nobody do you like Jesus he knows your
[57:08] weak points he knows what to struggles
[57:10] with but his compassion the Bible says
[57:14] fails not his compassion fails not don't
[57:19] ever think God get tired of you he
[57:21] cannot get tired of you if you really
[57:24] seed if you really hear he can't
[57:27] that's what David said his mercy and do
[57:29] it forever all generations his mercy he
[57:33] didn't just say grace he said it's mercy
[57:35] his mercy because Mercy's you know
[57:37] you're wrong you need help when you're
[57:40] wrong this is not a religion and when
[57:46] you find you call you handle it like a
[57:48] religion you're going to find yourself
[57:50] coming short God don't want this to be
[57:54] religion he wants it to be life everyday
[57:57] life everyday life wake up with the mind
[58:00] to serve God throughout the day with the
[58:04] mind to serve God hallelujah and when
[58:08] you feel yourself being pull one the
[58:10] opposite way that's when you say Lord be
[58:12] merciful how mercy on me you know put me
[58:14] right and am I the only one let's go
[58:17] through that every day every day
[58:23] remember the right mental attitude
[58:26] toward any promise of God will bring it
[58:29] to pass the right mental attitude toward
[58:32] any promise of God it doesn't it doesn't
[58:36] take gifts of healing to heal the sick
[58:38] people any person in here has a right to
[58:41] meet Satan anywhere huh
[58:44] oh I think everybody needs to hear what
[58:47] I said or what he said the point is
[58:50] sometimes we look to others to pray for
[58:52] us pray for yourself sometimes when will
[58:56] your faith increase when will you move
[58:59] you you know when will you come to a
[59:01] place of maturity where you can cast the
[59:04] devil out it's what we need we need to
[59:11] grow up
[59:12] listen I'm moving now listen Ephesians 1
[59:16] 17 through 23 you know eternity but it
[59:18] says with the eyes of your understanding
[59:20] being enlightened that you may know what
[59:24] is the hope of this calling and what the
[59:26] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[59:29] in the Saints this is what I love about
[59:31] Esther Esther just want it can I use the
[59:37] word naked she just wanted to be naked
[59:39] in other words she didn't want anything
[59:41] false she wanted God her King to see her
[59:47] for who she was she was not a hypocrite
[59:53] there was nothing false about her this
[59:56] is what I love about God I can be true I
[59:58] can be true I don't have to fake it you
[1:00:03] know I don't have to say like some of
[1:00:05] y'all you know you just know some of me
[1:00:07] you don't know all of me like I don't
[1:00:09] know all of you we always have that
[1:00:12] little one part that we hide behind we
[1:00:16] use as a facade because we feel like if
[1:00:18] people would see the real you all of you
[1:00:21] they wouldn't like you so we have this
[1:00:25] little mass that we work with sometimes
[1:00:27] and then to pretend but God said put
[1:00:30] away all of that you don't need that
[1:00:33] anymore
[1:00:34] that's what Paul said we don't know no
[1:00:36] man after the flesh you anymore we don't
[1:00:38] even know Jesus Christ after the flesh
[1:00:40] anymore listen we all saved by grace
[1:00:45] there is no dog there's an ocean that
[1:00:48] won't be brought to the light hallelujah
[1:00:53] and the only only thing the only way you
[1:00:55] can ever get rid of la darkness is
[1:00:57] put it under the blood be real yeah this
[1:01:11] is what I like about it she was she
[1:01:14] wanted to display her to her king the
[1:01:16] character that she had already
[1:01:19] she had character and those girls even
[1:01:24] though she knew that I can go into this
[1:01:26] chamber that they that you know where
[1:01:28] all of the jewels and all of the
[1:01:30] barrettes and braces and bracelets and
[1:01:33] everything and gowns and you know I can
[1:01:35] choose they said I can choose whatever I
[1:01:37] want to choose I can wear it and even if
[1:01:40] the King doesn't select me I can take
[1:01:42] this back with me Dum Dums
[1:01:46] excuse me what would an elaborate dress
[1:01:52] do you if you in a room all the time you
[1:01:58] ain't got nowhere to show it off this
[1:02:02] gonna be your first and last time to
[1:02:05] come before the king and you go calm a
[1:02:07] menu the crown is too big and and the
[1:02:11] bracelet too heavy but you love it y'all
[1:02:18] that's what people think but you know
[1:02:20] they don't look at people oh my god I
[1:02:22] don't even want to go there but how
[1:02:23] people come to church oh Lord
[1:02:25] but nevertheless you wonder who they
[1:02:29] gone to see oh I tell you what sometimes
[1:02:32] brother I'll be thinking wrong I said Oh
[1:02:34] Lord just hit her one time with that
[1:02:36] only goes and she get them high-heeled
[1:02:38] shoes boom now don't bother me because I
[1:02:46] it take character not to laugh
[1:02:48] especially you know told people about
[1:02:50] wearing high-heeled shoes y'all looking
[1:02:53] at me like I'm crazy I'm being real
[1:02:55] the party is yeah because people don't
[1:02:59] even realize Amen those thing gonna take
[1:03:01] you straight to hell and they just one
[1:03:03] little thing huh
[1:03:05] I had a friend she's going on I don't
[1:03:08] know whether she's with the Lord or not
[1:03:09] I don't know but I hope she did
[1:03:12] her name was well I better not tell her
[1:03:14] name but she's a big girl with them big
[1:03:17] old shoes hi you need to stop I should
[1:03:20] tell her you need to stop wearing no
[1:03:21] shoes first of all it ain't good for
[1:03:23] your back right I see it's not healthy
[1:03:28] those things are not healthy she had to
[1:03:30] wear was going down this incline and
[1:03:41] when things like that you when things
[1:03:43] like that happen you have to get serious
[1:03:45] all real serious inside you about the
[1:03:52] break so I had to wait to see whether
[1:03:56] she was make sure she wasn't hurt I
[1:03:59] think I lay out all the way to a job you
[1:04:03] know cuz I kept thinking I told you
[1:04:05] listen i'ma take this the truth never
[1:04:08] ever had to worry about her ever wearing
[1:04:09] high-heeled shoes again and people don't
[1:04:13] even think high-heeled shoes or send
[1:04:15] them to hell you know why because it
[1:04:19] takes a woman and it lifts her heel up
[1:04:22] it produces a proud look and God hates
[1:04:26] the prideful look whether it be male
[1:04:29] like female let me move on I don't know
[1:04:31] how come I got on that because most of
[1:04:33] the people that need to hear that ain't
[1:04:34] even here tonight let me move on you
[1:04:38] love the Lord the Bible says for grace
[1:04:41] are ye saved through faith and that not
[1:04:44] of yourself
[1:04:44] it is a gift of God right who chose
[1:04:51] Esther it was a king what made him
[1:04:57] choose her his own desire his own liking
[1:05:03] of her nobody forced him that was His
[1:05:07] grace toward her
[1:05:09] that's how it is with you God didn't
[1:05:12] chose you he didn't choose me because
[1:05:14] I'm a preacher or singer the gifts and
[1:05:18] calling of God is without repentance how
[1:05:21] people in the world got better gifts
[1:05:23] right
[1:05:25] but that doesn't save them because they
[1:05:27] can sing or play or dance that doesn't
[1:05:29] save you the only thing that saves you
[1:05:32] is the grace of God you said well what
[1:05:35] do you mean the grace I explained it to
[1:05:37] you the grace of God is like when God
[1:05:39] opened up your understanding it's going
[1:05:41] to rain getting the ark and everybody
[1:05:45] else don't hear it nobody else can see
[1:05:47] what you see right but the grace of God
[1:05:50] has given you a revelation that God had
[1:05:53] getting ready to destroy the world get
[1:05:55] in the ark that's His grace nothing you
[1:05:58] did to earn it he chose to do that for
[1:06:01] you that's the grace of God the grace of
[1:06:04] God is to tell you this message is right
[1:06:06] this message will produce a character in
[1:06:09] you that would get you into the gates of
[1:06:11] heaven
[1:06:13] everybody don't see it everybody don't
[1:06:16] know it but that's the grace of God to
[1:06:19] us but God has not appointed us to wrath
[1:06:26] how many I'll believe that how many
[1:06:28] y'all part of it at us no delegate no
[1:06:34] devil in here can convince me that I'm
[1:06:36] going to hell
[1:06:40] hello none so what are you saying you
[1:06:44] know Peter oh I just got old Lord if I
[1:06:48] could just make the rapture if ya when
[1:06:50] did if come in it you chosen and elected
[1:06:58] before the foundation of the world you
[1:07:01] know if this is not your cheesy he chose
[1:07:05] you yeah listen it's like his like it's
[1:07:09] like no he you know he chose the animals
[1:07:12] and God directed him all right and how
[1:07:16] you said what do you mean brother even
[1:07:17] the animals that were chosen knew where
[1:07:19] to go is that right this is that right
[1:07:22] those animals were coming two by two
[1:07:24] he didn't have to pray to Harper the
[1:07:26] Horn God had anointed those animals to
[1:07:31] find that Ark it was the Spirit of God
[1:07:36] moving in that day just
[1:07:38] it is now the world is getting ready to
[1:07:41] burn why are you here
[1:07:42] something is warning you something's
[1:07:46] telling you that the world is about to
[1:07:48] fall apart
[1:07:50] get in the safety zone hmm I hope this
[1:08:01] is okay I'm enjoying it ping listen you
[1:08:06] said what brother books what are you
[1:08:07] saying
[1:08:07] you said well huh for a long time I used
[1:08:11] to hate listening to the statue of a
[1:08:12] perfect man you say why would you say
[1:08:14] like that cuz I did it scared me because
[1:08:18] I couldn't see myself doing it I didn't
[1:08:22] know how to do it don't even go to a
[1:08:24] thinking man's filter flunked the test
[1:08:30] every time I didn't know how and to God
[1:08:35] open my eyes he that begun the good work
[1:08:41] in you its faithful to complete it ain't
[1:08:47] got nothing to do with it
[1:08:48] I believe God like abraham believed God
[1:08:51] and it was counted unto Him as
[1:08:53] righteousness believe God if you truly
[1:08:56] believe him in your heart he will bring
[1:08:59] it to pass
[1:09:02] no Abraham didn't even know where he was
[1:09:05] going and yet God was taking him every
[1:09:07] place he needed to be huh and that's how
[1:09:13] he is sometimes you don't even know you
[1:09:14] were being laid when God is leading
[1:09:19] mm-hmm that's right I don't know if the
[1:09:22] Lord Kanha Terry you know I look at the
[1:09:24] devil and I said you know what first of
[1:09:26] all I'm not afraid of him because of the
[1:09:28] grace of God you know if I was standing
[1:09:30] on my own then I would be terrified but
[1:09:33] when you know that you got Christ on the
[1:09:35] inside and you can see yourself moving
[1:09:36] glory glory glory glory things changing
[1:09:40] in you your mind is more set on God now
[1:09:42] and that's what my mind is more set on
[1:09:44] God now than ever before
[1:09:46] and I know I couldn't have done that I
[1:09:48] could not you know it was God he's been
[1:09:51] God it
[1:09:52] like Lord am I losing my mind and if
[1:09:54] that's that's happening that's a real
[1:09:56] good thing yeah give me a few more
[1:10:03] minutes I told my wife I wasn't gonna
[1:10:05] preach long I said I'm gonna try my best
[1:10:07] to do it short
[1:10:08] give me 7 more minutes I know it's hard
[1:10:13] because I know you come you're tired and
[1:10:15] everything so what yeah five more
[1:10:18] minutes and I'll let you go oh look my
[1:10:21] thing is we need a revival every one of
[1:10:25] us and I I know I do I mean I feel like
[1:10:28] I'm in revival now I really believe that
[1:10:30] God is reviving me getting all the trash
[1:10:33] out of my life and most of all I think
[1:10:35] my greatest battle has always been my
[1:10:37] will he's given me a great the grace of
[1:10:40] God to deny me you know throughout today
[1:10:43] I'm constantly denying my will and I'm
[1:10:46] gonna tell you something that old boy
[1:10:48] can be strong sometimes hmm Paul said I
[1:10:54] tell you what it's like I said
[1:10:55] to do you know the will to do good and
[1:10:57] then don't do it he said I struggle with
[1:11:00] it all the time huh
[1:11:03] and sometimes I find myself doing things
[1:11:05] I don't want to do and I do it anyway I
[1:11:10] know it you call that what iniquity
[1:11:13] thank God for the blood of Jesus he
[1:11:16] covers us even we know when he knows
[1:11:18] we've done wrong and we know we done
[1:11:20] wrong all right but you expect - you
[1:11:24] know revival is getting the trash out
[1:11:25] it's not adding more water anymore
[1:11:28] people oh we got a revival going on in
[1:11:30] our church and you know more people are
[1:11:32] coming that's not a revival revival is
[1:11:35] taking what you got and getting the
[1:11:36] trash out you know what I'd love to see
[1:11:40] I'd love to see this church so
[1:11:42] consecrated in and so in love with God
[1:11:44] amen we start drawing people off the
[1:11:47] street like a magnet I want to see that
[1:11:52] the the the the very Acts of the
[1:11:54] Apostles living in us not in somebody
[1:11:59] else in us both male and female I
[1:12:03] remember when I first came to this
[1:12:05] message nobody couldn't
[1:12:06] we've seen every every gift there was
[1:12:09] and that this Bible was in act in action
[1:12:12] in action among the brothers and the
[1:12:14] sisters we had we had prophecies and
[1:12:17] everything else that was telling us days
[1:12:19] ahead what was gonna happen oh yeah it
[1:12:22] wasn't nothing to see the pillar of fire
[1:12:24] or see God move in a mighty way and
[1:12:28] people say it ain't real it's real maybe
[1:12:31] they haven't seen it but I've seen it
[1:12:33] I'm a witness I'm just one of the ones
[1:12:34] who still know it's true hmm Brian eyes
[1:12:40] open oh it didn't make the paper it
[1:12:43] don't have to make the paper but you
[1:12:47] know why you know what messes up those
[1:12:49] brothers who've been in the in the
[1:12:52] message so long it comes at Oh y'all do
[1:12:55] Pentecostal you know what was the
[1:12:59] difference we believed everything we
[1:13:02] heard and we acted on it we didn't have
[1:13:06] no man's influence we acted upon what we
[1:13:09] heard we believed it and we got results
[1:13:12] that's it you don't need an
[1:13:15] interpretation for it it's right there
[1:13:18] if you just do what's being said to be
[1:13:21] done it's finished look we're all the
[1:13:26] interpretations that garden is calling
[1:13:28] and formal fighting each other and
[1:13:30] everything else where is the revival and
[1:13:33] until we come back together that we love
[1:13:36] one another it ain't gonna beat the Lord
[1:13:38] ain't coming yet
[1:13:39] you understand me somewhere you know it
[1:13:41] may not be a big group of everybody but
[1:13:44] my point is the bride must be on one
[1:13:45] Accord that's how the Holy Ghost fell on
[1:13:49] the day of Pentecost and that's how it's
[1:13:51] gonna fall again when we stop our
[1:13:53] silliness and our selfishness and get
[1:13:56] back to being in love with one another I
[1:13:58] could remember the time didn't even want
[1:14:00] to go home from church stay up two or
[1:14:03] three o'clock in the morning tired got
[1:14:05] to go to work in the morning didn't care
[1:14:07] we was in love with God now so let me
[1:14:12] move on so behind this badger skin your
[1:14:15] skin is where God wants to place the
[1:14:17] glory of God
[1:14:20] I says no you're not you are the temples
[1:14:21] of God now you show a brother why are
[1:14:24] you saying all the things that going on
[1:14:26] in his message let me tell you what's
[1:14:28] going on before I close the world is
[1:14:33] coming to here I'm laughing but I'm
[1:14:37] serious and people looking at it and
[1:14:40] don't see it all of the signs all of the
[1:14:43] markings of the word is in-your-face
[1:14:46] nations against nations earthquakes look
[1:14:50] at all the Seas the oceans everything is
[1:14:53] downsizing you know you see that that
[1:14:56] coronavirus is downsizing what's
[1:14:59] happening I mean you see California
[1:15:01] burning over time and floods here and
[1:15:04] floods there and viruses it and Wars and
[1:15:06] everything else and people right now are
[1:15:08] so unrest I don't know about you but I
[1:15:13] just don't have the peace of walking in
[1:15:15] the streets like I used to even in your
[1:15:19] neighborhood you don't even know who
[1:15:21] gonna ride around with the gun say it
[1:15:24] won't happen yes it happened up in
[1:15:25] Ankeny my son-in-law was just out in the
[1:15:28] park when they lived over there in that
[1:15:30] place and a guy came to him because he
[1:15:32] was looking at this guy and he see and
[1:15:34] he said you know you if you was in
[1:15:35] Chicago
[1:15:36] you wouldn't be staring at me like that
[1:15:38] because he said you you'd be killed or
[1:15:40] something like that I may not have the
[1:15:41] words verbatim but my son-in-law was
[1:15:44] just right outside of his door in his
[1:15:46] Park but somebody from somewhere else
[1:15:50] threatening his life nowhere is safe
[1:15:55] other than in Jesus that's it and people
[1:16:00] weren't you gonna do I'm gonna say this
[1:16:02] again like I said Sunday evening you
[1:16:05] only get one chance you don't get a
[1:16:09] second chance you mess up this time you
[1:16:12] die without Jesus you you don't knock on
[1:16:14] your door no more you don't ever get a
[1:16:17] chance to go to heaven oh you'll be
[1:16:20] resurrected in the second resurrection
[1:16:23] even where the Dead will rise but you
[1:16:26] know where they come when they rise up
[1:16:28] you know where they're going from Hell
[1:16:30] into the lake of fire you know
[1:16:33] second chance is it worth it is it worth
[1:16:38] it sometimes we we think some things are
[1:16:41] so valuable I guess that's what best I
[1:16:43] thought her party was better
[1:16:48] that's what denominations they have in
[1:16:50] reviving us all over the place they
[1:16:53] enjoying themselves so was she
[1:16:56] drunken dancing like they drunk playing
[1:16:59] like they drunk hauling and screaming
[1:17:02] like they drunk and don't even know
[1:17:03] they've been rejected let me tell you
[1:17:07] something you don't want to be in that
[1:17:08] chair hmm make your calling and election
[1:17:14] sure y'all understand me young people
[1:17:18] they know make your call and election
[1:17:20] sure you keep pressing for them said the
[1:17:23] real Holy Ghost will bring you to the
[1:17:25] full statue of Christ the real Holy
[1:17:28] Ghost will bring you to the full statue
[1:17:31] of Christ I might have put that word
[1:17:38] real but that's what he be the Holy
[1:17:40] Ghost will bring you to the statue of
[1:17:42] Christ and I say real because a lot of
[1:17:44] people think they got it and they don't
[1:17:45] and then you came in you can't come to
[1:17:48] the statue of Christ of you ain't born
[1:17:50] you ain't been begotten if the seed
[1:17:52] hadn't been quickened Romans 10:9 come
[1:17:55] on real people say oh you quoting it yes
[1:17:58] that's the Bible and you've got to
[1:18:00] confess with your mouth and believe in
[1:18:01] your heart that's where you're saved
[1:18:03] right it just doesn't stop there it goes
[1:18:06] on you got to grow up you got to mature
[1:18:09] right and let me turn something about my
[1:18:13] flowers out there because they look like
[1:18:15] they withering I don't know much about
[1:18:16] flowers so I went and asked about how to
[1:18:19] take care of them you know and when I
[1:18:21] look you know I'm believing but the lady
[1:18:25] basically was telling me it's the
[1:18:27] environment those flowers they like
[1:18:30] water they don't like that not a whole
[1:18:32] lot of water but like like a lot of
[1:18:34] sunshine and they don't like draught and
[1:18:35] that's why they withering because they
[1:18:37] writing that doing that draft hits them
[1:18:39] but so I've got a movement flowers here
[1:18:44] I'm talking about flowers but it's a
[1:18:45] spiritual plication
[1:18:48] because in order for the plants to bloom
[1:18:53] in a state of reproduction the comet
[1:18:58] must be just right
[1:19:02] so is it with the church in order for
[1:19:06] this church to bloom and bring forth
[1:19:09] reproduction this atmosphere must be
[1:19:12] right ain't nobody coming back to a dead
[1:19:16] church
[1:19:17] nobody excited why should I come there
[1:19:20] they don't look like they love Jesus huh
[1:19:24] hey man and the truth of the matter is
[1:19:27] I've been Church we had to preach we
[1:19:30] listened they mean the music we had to
[1:19:32] go for years without it but back then we
[1:19:37] had more fire than we got now hello
[1:19:40] it's the truth we'd go out and
[1:19:43] fellowship with one another
[1:19:47] now every man for yourself we didn't
[1:19:53] have much and a hotel room but things
[1:19:57] were better in that sense seemed like we
[1:19:59] had a closer connection but something
[1:20:02] has happened and I think all of us need
[1:20:05] agree examine ourselves because until we
[1:20:09] love each other the way we ought to
[1:20:10] we're not going nowhere yeah I'm gonna
[1:20:14] tell you something love you think love
[1:20:16] is mushy but love is not mushy love can
[1:20:19] take a lot of stuff love is rough tough
[1:20:22] right let's stay now I I I'm coming to a
[1:20:27] place and I'm closing just now I took
[1:20:30] more than 10 minutes I'm sorry but let
[1:20:33] me tell you some people it's real don't
[1:20:36] let the devil play and make you think
[1:20:38] you got a lot of time because we don't
[1:20:41] and it's gonna be so simple there'll be
[1:20:44] so many so small of a amount of people
[1:20:47] missing so nobody will miss him you know
[1:20:51] I just heard the prophet of God say the
[1:20:53] other day he said he said you know he
[1:20:55] said so many people will be missing from
[1:20:57] Jeffersonville and they won't even know
[1:20:58] where they go he didn't even say all I'm
[1:21:01] you know he just said so many Oh a few
[1:21:05] what about us because we think we got it
[1:21:10] all made because we can see that God
[1:21:12] sent a prophet Israel did too and I just
[1:21:15] keep saying that because I want people
[1:21:16] to know that that a system that we
[1:21:18] developed
[1:21:19] okay saying 45 minutes you know preach
[1:21:22] so many long minutes and you know a
[1:21:24] system that don't save you it just don't
[1:21:27] save you you are saved by grace but you
[1:21:32] got to come in contact with God you got
[1:21:35] to make a union
[1:21:36] it's got to be intimate it can't be a
[1:21:39] long distant relationship you understand
[1:21:43] me you got to talk to him and he's got
[1:21:46] to talk to you it's got to be that kind
[1:21:49] of a first place and God ain't gonna
[1:21:51] take a dirty bride I don't know it
[1:21:54] always it's grace yes it's great but
[1:21:57] like I'll tell you again grace gives you
[1:22:00] the time to make it right and I'm gonna
[1:22:04] tell you something people of God I want
[1:22:08] to be wrapped arrest
[1:22:10] completely sealed with divine love see
[1:22:14] this what we don't understand the token
[1:22:17] is divine love it must be on display it
[1:22:20] can't be here though I got the Holy
[1:22:22] Ghost but you still got that temper you
