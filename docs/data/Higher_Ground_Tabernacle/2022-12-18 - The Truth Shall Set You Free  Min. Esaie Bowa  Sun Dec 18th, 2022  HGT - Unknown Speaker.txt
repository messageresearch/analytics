[Music] have you see foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we've been condemned by Representatives Christ 1955 it is a scene he says this is love he said notice in the time when the slaves now be being sold and we were all sold out to sing by Adams foreign Glory of of God but God induce season sending his son Christ Jesus made in the form of sinful fleshity to redeem us to bring us out from under the bondage reconciling the word to himself [Music] to bring men out of slavery but the spiritual slavery we were in the Jews [Music] he came to deliver them from Spirituals the slavery of sin we may face Esther yes [Music] but Jesus identifies himself he said I am the way the truth and the lies that's the reason why Jesus say I'm the truth the way and the life [Music] [Applause] and that was Jesus in the doors in one go one the doors in the door okay 32 it is you see now absolutely to me it's the absolute truth what we're looking for is the truth the second is I told you that my
