[42:42] become our birthday boys and friends
[42:46] and uh people that we look forward to
[42:48] spending all of eternity with dejean

[42:56] the bonds of love that we have for the
[42:59] church here in des moines iowa affection
[43:04] the love that we feel for each one
[43:06] of you

[45:29] and he saith
[45:31] i cannot
[45:33] for it is sealed
[45:44] in

[47:54] they they
[47:55] ponder whether it means this or means
[47:57] that
[48:00] and you can see the evidence of it
[48:04] all around
[48:07] as people have taken uh 900 different
[48:10] ideas of what this book means
[48:16] and you can take uh just take the the
[48:18] doctrine of the baptism of the holy
[48:20] ghost
[48:24] now the one person will say
[48:29] that when you take the holy eucharist
[48:32] allah
[49:00] you take your confirmation classes
[49:04] and then they they sprinkle the water on
[49:05] you
[49:07] then they lay hands on you and they say
[49:09] they are confirming the holy spirit upon
[49:11] you
[49:13] can confirm
[49:42] that you now have that holy spirit that
[49:44] has been promised
[49:47] for me
[49:48] but you know all of those different
[49:49] ideas
[49:52] none of them stop god one bit
[50:12] and there has been uh the church has
[50:14] gone to a very dark age
[50:18] think about where the church was a
[50:20] thousand years ago
[50:38] hundreds of years of men taking this
[50:40] word and just haphazardly giving it out
[50:46] and mixing in the doctrines of men
[50:50] and different ideas
[50:52] the book was sealed
[50:56] who can understand it
[50:59] now i want to tell you that there that
[51:00] when the book is sealed
[51:04] then it does something to the people
[51:20] when the book is closed
[51:23] god's field of wheat is not transformed
[51:26] to the field it's supposed to be the
[51:29] the the
[51:30] transformation
[51:34] let's go down down in that same chapter
[51:36] is isaiah 29.
[51:40] enough verse 17.
[51:42] he's continuing on in this same thought
[51:45] same thought you continue
[51:48] but he begins to change direction just a
[51:50] little bit
[51:51] direction
[51:53] and he begins to describe what happens
[51:55] when the book is unsealed
[52:00] and he says is it not a very little
[52:03] while
[52:05] i mean something's coming soon
[52:09] is it not yet a very little while
[52:12] and lebanon shall be turned into a
[52:14] fruitful field
[52:18] and the fruitful field should be
[52:20] esteemed as a forest
[52:24] and in that day
[52:27] oh there is a day
[52:30] and in that day
[52:32] the deaf shall hear the words of the
[52:34] book
[52:37] the eyes of the blind shall begin to see
[52:39] out of obscurity
[52:44] and out of darkness the the
[52:46] the enamel
[52:48] the meek also verse 19 shall increase
[52:50] their joy in the lord
[52:55] the poor among men shall rejoice in the
[52:57] holy one of israel
[53:12] habit
[53:16] when things begin to get a little dark
[53:21] he'll only let it go for so long
[53:43] it says in the world if you go back and
[53:45] you read actually in the in the in the
[53:47] hebrew there
[53:49] it says and the world became dark
[54:08] you couldn't discern anything about it
[54:10] it wasn't the condition that god had in
[54:13] his mind before the foundation of the
[54:14] world
[54:19] and the earth being in that condition
[54:49] according to any man's idea anywhere no
[54:52] no no no no no no
[54:54] this is god himself that's the jewel
[54:56] remember this is the holy spirit of the
[54:58] living god
[55:00] and his creation has become void and
[55:02] dark and formless
[55:17] so he begins to brood over the darkness
[55:22] now i want you to consider what was the
[55:24] end result of his brooding
[55:31] we know that the animals sprung up
[55:35] we know that a great light starts
[55:36] shining on the earth
[55:40] we know that that grass began to come up
[55:42] out of the dirt
[55:44] we know all those things oh those were
[55:46] great
[55:49] we know that that uh the giraffes begin
[55:51] to wander across the earth
[55:56] and here's mr mrs giraffe
[55:59] here's a mr mrs lyon
[56:03] tiger
[56:04] and all those things
[56:06] and those things are great things great
[56:07] things great
[56:09] shows but the holy spirit was not done
[56:11] brooding because it had not yet come to
[56:14] the vision
[56:21] the holy spirit will always keep
[56:23] brooding until it comes to the place
[56:27] that he had in the vision
[56:43] formed out of the dust of the earth
[56:47] and god began to
[56:50] speak out
[56:53] and all of a sudden this man stood up
[57:11] very creator has poured himself into a
[57:14] his life into a body
[57:19] the life of the creator was being put
[57:21] into a body
[57:25] we know that god likes to do that
[57:28] he likes to put his life into our body
[57:32] that's been his desire all along to put
[57:35] his life into a body upon this earth
[57:52] he'd been commuting and commuting and
[57:54] commuting
[57:57] and he was uh just a chip off the old
[57:59] block
[58:02] when god had a thought
[58:04] do you have in ponce adam had a thought
[58:16] that his sons and daughters will be just
[58:18] like him this is
[58:48] says i want you to name all the animals
[58:52] i want you to consider their
[58:54] characteristics could you consider the
[58:55] characteristics which do you consider
[58:57] everything about them
[59:00] i want you to examine them
[59:02] look at every part of them
[59:05] look at their characteristics
[59:07] look at their mindsets
[59:09] look at the
[59:10] look at the end of the emotions
[59:13] look at every single part of them
[59:16] don't
[59:43] and all these things everyone with its
[59:45] counterpart male and female male and
[59:48] female male and female
[59:51] female and he went and he did everything
[59:54] that god told him to do
[59:58] well one thing all that amongst all of
[1:00:00] that here god had given him that
[1:00:02] commandment reproduce and multiply
[1:00:05] remember
[1:00:08] but when he began to see male and female
[1:00:11] male and female male and female
[1:00:25] and all throughout creation god have
[1:00:26] been saying it is good it is good it is
[1:00:29] good
[1:00:32] but here comes adam and eve
[1:00:35] god says it is not good
[1:00:38] that man should dwell alone dude
[1:00:45] and so god takes adam and he puts him to
[1:00:47] sleep
[1:00:51] reaches down onto the inside of adam
[1:01:12] [Music]
[1:01:22] bring them on down through the centuries
[1:01:24] call them the jews
[1:01:26] the
[1:01:28] the siege
[1:01:29] they took the pillar of fire
[1:01:33] the tablets of stone
[1:01:36] the
[1:02:04] meant to go into that promised land and
[1:02:06] take over
[1:02:09] but instead they dragged it to the
[1:02:11] wilderness for 40 years
[1:02:18] and they turn the power of god into a
[1:02:21] religion he's on faith
[1:02:24] yeah that's just like me
[1:02:26] that's just like what man does this
[1:02:28] fondly zombie they take the power of god
[1:02:30] and they turn it into a religion
[1:02:32] that's
[1:02:34] and after now think about it there was 2
[1:02:36] 000 years from adam until about moses or
[1:02:40] abraham's time
[1:02:45] and they turned the garden of eden into
[1:02:47] a religion
[1:02:50] they did all these things and the
[1:02:52] egyptians did what they did and the
[1:02:53] sumerians did what they did and every
[1:02:56] tribe of the earth did what they had to
[1:02:58] do with the power of god in the garden
[1:02:59] of eden
[1:03:24] god came again and sent a second atom to
[1:03:26] the earth
[1:03:36] and this second adam he he he he came
[1:03:39] upon this earth but if you say i don't
[1:03:41] even know
[1:03:55] god was coming down himself
[1:03:59] he formed himself a a body of flesh he's
[1:04:03] he spoke a word into the womb of mary he
[1:04:05] said
[1:04:10] he was born there
[1:04:12] by that spoken word creation all over
[1:04:15] again
[1:04:18] the word was spoken in the beginning
[1:04:21] and created a garden of eden
[1:04:24] yeah the
[1:04:35] he begins to attack that religion yeah
[1:04:42] whereas men take the power and spirit of
[1:04:45] god and they turn it into a form of man
[1:04:48] made religion
[1:04:53] they didn't know what to do with jesus
[1:04:57] they didn't know what to do with him
[1:05:00] one time jesus he was
[1:05:03] going he's preaching through all the
[1:05:05] tabernacles around israel
[1:05:19] we don't know what this man is preaching
[1:05:24] it doesn't it doesn't match what our
[1:05:25] schools of theology says
[1:05:31] the the the teachings of this man jesus
[1:05:33] there's no sin
[1:05:35] it doesn't match what the scribes say
[1:05:39] listen it doesn't match what the doctors
[1:05:41] say
[1:05:42] is the doctor but you know he just kept
[1:05:44] preaching all the same things
[1:05:47] he came he did just exactly what he was
[1:05:50] had to do
[1:05:57] unbelief does not hinder god one bit
[1:06:01] you can believe or you can disbelieve
[1:06:10] he got to this
[1:06:12] little church way up in the north
[1:06:16] this little synagogue
[1:06:19] he went in there
[1:06:22] he was going to have a church service
[1:06:26] but the pharisees had heard about him
[1:06:28] being up there
[1:07:13] they gathered in there
[1:07:16] and the house was filled with pharisees
[1:07:20] filled with sadducees
[1:07:24] i hope we don't have that around here
[1:07:28] now when you read in the gospels
[1:07:32] when it begins to describe that church
[1:07:34] service
[1:07:37] it says and the power of the lord was
[1:07:40] present to heal
[1:07:55] of any of those pharisees or sadducees
[1:07:57] being healed
[1:08:02] there is no testimony
[1:08:05] they didn't come out of there with a
[1:08:07] powerful testimony what god had done for
[1:08:27] the bible says the power of the lord was
[1:08:29] present to heal them
[1:08:34] there is no record of any other
[1:08:35] testimony
[1:08:40] now there were some men in that area oh
[1:08:43] there were some men in there
[1:08:48] they had a friend that was sick yes
[1:09:02] again could you visit this on purple
[1:09:06] and there's something about it when you
[1:09:07] realize that you're in a day where god
[1:09:09] is in the day of god's visitation
[1:09:16] in your mind
[1:09:25] [Music]
[1:09:28] that if i could ever live in bible days
[1:09:31] again
[1:09:56] so these four these four faithful
[1:09:58] friends
[1:10:01] they had their
[1:10:02] they had their their their friend that
[1:10:04] he couldn't walk
[1:10:07] so they put him on this little cot oh
[1:10:09] you know this is yours and they carried
[1:10:10] him on the poles
[1:10:13] and they're gonna go to church and get
[1:10:14] him into the presence of god's
[1:10:16] visitation
[1:10:21] amen
[1:10:23] but the thing of it was
[1:10:26] when they got to church
[1:10:44] when god has something in his mind that
[1:10:46] he's going to do
[1:10:51] now he's going to raise up stones under
[1:10:53] himself to praise him
[1:10:55] he failed to believe him exactly how the
[1:10:57] word says to believe him
[1:11:01] we can't receive christ the same
[1:11:04] yesterday today forever
[1:11:52] is
[1:11:56] here's the solution to all their
[1:11:58] problems
[1:12:01] they couldn't get him because of the
[1:12:03] the pharisees in the church
[1:12:21] above the platform
[1:12:26] i'm sure it caused a lot of commotion
[1:12:31] they might not have had very good church
[1:12:33] orders
[1:12:49] the very first thing he saw
[1:12:53] was not the cut
[1:12:55] it was not the sick man
[1:12:58] wasn't even the four people there
[1:13:02] it wasn't the ropes
[1:13:09] [Applause]
[1:13:30] the jewish
[1:14:08] now we know christ is going to have a
[1:14:10] bride
[1:14:21] a man is going to marry a man
[1:14:24] farmer
[1:14:26] that's just the way of creation
[1:14:29] every seed must bring forth of its kind
[1:14:32] especially
[1:14:36] in space so now i don't want to stumble
[1:14:38] you here
[1:14:46] will this bride of christ be
[1:14:53] amen
[1:14:55] now it's just to open up some of the
[1:14:56] scriptures now we had a time of day when
[1:14:58] this book was sealed
[1:15:03] but when the book begins to open
[1:15:08] then a fruitful field begins to appear
[1:15:10] and the garden of eden returns
[1:15:15] when the book is unveiled you begin to
[1:15:17] see scriptures in there that maybe men
[1:15:20] have taken in a religious way in the
[1:15:21] times past but
[1:15:45] and in six days god created the heavens
[1:15:47] and the earth
[1:15:50] and now in 6 000 years i mean
[1:15:54] it's time for something to take place
[1:15:58] it's time for the finishing act of
[1:16:00] creation
[1:16:04] it's time for the finishing act of
[1:16:06] creation
[1:16:10] don't you see that satan thought he
[1:16:12] interrupted the finishing act of
[1:16:14] creation
[1:16:27] he thought that god had taken himself
[1:16:29] and put himself in a weak body
[1:16:53] bring it to a tarnation make it so
[1:16:55] unclean that god could never live in it
[1:17:28] bit
[1:17:31] doesn't hinder god's plan
[1:17:39] when jesus was here on the earth
[1:17:45] old jehovah was putting himself in a
[1:17:46] weak body again
[1:17:53] he didn't exactly know what jesus was
[1:17:59] he thought he might be another prophet
[1:18:01] he wasn't sure
[1:18:05] but he'd never seen signs and wonders
[1:18:07] like this before
[1:18:15] this is a little bit higher than isaiah
[1:18:19] a little bit higher than what jeremiah
[1:18:20] was saying
[1:18:22] that david god worked in him pretty
[1:18:24] powerfully but this is this is another
[1:18:26] step here
[1:18:35] it got into the pharisees into the
[1:18:37] church world
[1:19:19] reversing every curse that was put on
[1:19:21] adam's race
[1:19:27] the earth will bear thorns and thistles
[1:19:31] and then they took jesus and they put a
[1:19:33] crown of thorns on them
[1:19:47] now let me tell you when jesus cried out
[1:19:49] on the cross and said it is finished
[1:19:54] he wasn't joking
[1:19:59] he knew exactly what he was saying
[1:20:12] and for some reason the church of god
[1:20:23] despite
[1:20:25] the finishing act of jesus christ on the
[1:20:27] cross
[1:20:30] jesus
[1:20:59] marched out and they went deep down into
[1:21:01] a dark age
[1:21:06] a thousand years of misery
[1:21:11] to take the power of god and upon the
[1:21:14] poisson
[1:21:15] just bury it in the earth
[1:21:19] but you know unbelief doesn't hinder god
[1:21:24] god's plans just keep marching right on
[1:21:28] right
[1:21:29] continue
[1:21:31] each one of us has a
[1:21:33] an opportunity
[1:21:35] opportunity a decision point
[1:21:38] decision to decide
[1:21:54] jesus christ was the second adam jesus
[1:21:56] christ
[1:21:58] but he was the real true son of god he
[1:22:01] was god himself
[1:22:06] saved by the blood of a man
[1:22:47] and he says into thy hands i commit my
[1:22:49] spirit
[1:23:05] is recreating a bride of christ upon the
[1:23:08] earth
[1:23:12] and there has been age after age
[1:23:17] now when you get to the book of
[1:23:18] revelations
[1:23:22] the the thyatira church there in
[1:23:24] revelations chapter 2.
[1:23:29] that was prophesying of that dark age
[1:23:34] he says i will put no other burden upon
[1:23:36] you
[1:23:39] just to you that haven't known the
[1:23:41] depths of satan
[1:23:45] i'm just speaking to those that haven't
[1:23:47] known the depths of satan
[1:23:51] i won't put any other burden upon you
[1:23:55] but then you turn to the laodicean
[1:23:57] church
[1:23:59] so that layer to see in church
[1:24:02] was prophesying of a last day
[1:24:06] other people that would be lukewarm
[1:24:10] formless
[1:24:12] void
[1:24:13] without shape
[1:24:28] and he would give them a great challenge
[1:24:32] that's speaking of our days
[1:24:36] now there's got to be someone that hears
[1:24:37] that challenge
[1:24:40] there's got to be someone that hears
[1:24:42] that
[1:24:53] now many of the 12 tribes they they
[1:24:55] heard about the promised land
[1:25:09] you know joshua wrote in a book every
[1:25:11] part of their inheritance
[1:25:15] surveyors out to survey the land
[1:25:22] to mark the boundaries of each tribe
[1:25:35] and they said uh the land that you gave
[1:25:37] to us is too
[1:25:49] [Music]
[1:25:53] now josh who i got pretty puzzled
[1:25:57] because you know i wrote that book just
[1:25:58] the way the pillar of fire told me to
[1:26:00] ride it
[1:26:04] turn the pages
[1:26:06] say well
[1:26:19] all the way down to hit reuben's
[1:26:20] territory
[1:27:15] go cut down them trees
[1:27:18] don't destroy that enemy
[1:27:21] because you said you were a strong
[1:27:22] people
[1:27:24] you had a big drive
[1:27:26] then you are more than able to conquer
[1:27:28] them
[1:27:58] how the spirit of the lord god told him
[1:28:00] to write it
[1:28:04] and he'd get written out that the
[1:28:06] portion for dan was right next to
[1:28:08] jerusalem
[1:28:12] uh
[1:28:26] to where jesus christ was going to come
[1:28:32] but you know they got to a place
[1:28:35] where that inheritance was just a little
[1:28:36] too hard
[1:28:40] if you ever look at the maps of the
[1:28:42] tribes of israel
[1:28:49] way up top at the north
[1:28:52] that's not where joshua told them to be
[1:29:04] it first starts talking about there in
[1:29:06] judges seventeen eight don juice
[1:29:19] he was looking for a place where he
[1:29:21] could get a a paid salary to be faster
[1:29:28] and then he found a a house that was
[1:29:30] full of idols
[1:29:34] and the man that had the house he he had
[1:29:36] all the idols but he didn't have a
[1:29:38] priest to to bow down into these idols
[1:29:44] when he saw this levi went by that was
[1:29:47] looking for a paycheck
[1:30:04] anymore
[1:30:06] jerusalem
[1:30:07] i could just worship right here
[1:30:11] you know it pays to worship where god is
[1:30:13] being revealed
[1:30:16] it pays to worship wherever the open
[1:30:18] book is
[1:31:01] route what was the upper room
[1:31:05] it was eden being recreated
[1:31:12] so they
[1:31:13] this man he got this lazy priest
[1:31:25] dan was beginning to realize that their
[1:31:27] inheritance was just too hard for him
[1:31:33] and they heard about this place way up
[1:31:35] in the north borderland
[1:31:39] where lazy people was dwelling
[1:31:41] on vive so the lazy tribe
[1:31:45] tribute
[1:31:48] and as they're leaving they found this
[1:31:50] lazy priest at this house
[1:31:55] they killed the owner of the house and
[1:31:56] they says you're going to come and
[1:31:58] you're going to be our priest
[1:32:04] the lazy land
[1:32:10] foreign
[1:32:29] it labels every tribe that that 144 000
[1:32:32] comes from
[1:32:37] the tribe isn't there like
[1:32:53] now we're living in a day when we've had
[1:32:55] our 2000 years
[1:33:00] now the jews had the revealing of jesus
[1:33:02] christ
[1:33:07] the samaritans had the revealing of
[1:33:09] jesus christ
[1:33:13] you know we're living in a day but the
[1:33:14] gentiles they they didn't have that
[1:33:16] revealing
[1:33:19] now we're coming to the end
[1:33:23] we're coming to the end of time
[1:33:27] and the church is in no condition
[1:33:32] i've seen it you've seen it
[1:34:14] [Music]
[1:35:12] angels get into the church
[1:35:16] and it completely destroyed the church
[1:35:18] of god
[1:35:21] nevertheless
[1:35:23] there remains a promise laying here
[1:35:38] that promise has been sealed for so
[1:35:40] so
[1:35:44] and we've been rejoicing knowing that we
[1:35:46] are god's creations
[1:35:50] we've been rejoicing knowing that we are
[1:35:52] god's people
[1:36:01] but you know everybody has an
[1:36:03] opportunity to enter into god's promises
[1:36:07] now the enemy will be in the land you
[1:36:09] know
[1:36:10] you can be a dan
[1:36:16] or you could be a caleb
[1:36:23] there's got to be someone that's going
[1:36:24] to inherit this problem
[1:36:28] now i don't know about you but
[1:36:31] when i listen to brother braham's
[1:36:32] sermons
[1:36:35] there is something that took place there
[1:36:37] that's different
[1:36:42] there is something that took place there
[1:36:44] that's different
[1:36:47] now i i've read through the the the the
[1:36:51] you know uh jeremiah i've read there
[1:36:53] i've read
[1:36:54] uh martin luther i've read
[1:36:58] god
[1:36:59] i'm glad god did what he did in those
[1:37:00] days
[1:37:03] now see what god did church made back
[1:37:06] there in the dark ages
[1:37:10] so god sent a martin luther
[1:37:12] church
[1:37:16] and then he sent a john wesley to raise
[1:37:18] the church up out of there
[1:37:20] it's higher it's getting higher it's
[1:37:22] getting higher
[1:37:24] azusa street you know
[1:37:27] he's right here
[1:37:32] in the 50s and 60s when brother brown
[1:37:34] was preaching
[1:37:38] now when i listen to those tapes oh no
[1:37:42] when i listen to those tapes
[1:37:47] and you could say
[1:37:48] you can hear brother braham just
[1:37:50] preaching
[1:37:52] a good fine message
[1:37:55] a powerful message
[1:37:58] a message that will transform you
[1:38:15] the day that he's living in basketball
[1:38:21] there is a people up to a nut to the
[1:38:23] level that they're supposed to be
[1:38:29] but when i hear him do something like
[1:38:31] this
[1:38:33] please after he's done preaching
[1:38:37] and also he says you there in the red
[1:38:38] dress
[1:38:42] you were praying right before you come
[1:38:44] in the room
[1:38:46] you're praying for your husband who
[1:38:47] lives over in louisville
[1:38:50] he's sick and he's not a christian
[1:38:55] go back home
[1:39:13] there was a power on the inside of him
[1:39:18] himself to this age to this hour
[1:39:22] ready for a rapture that's coming soon
[1:39:37] did exactly what god told him to do
[1:39:50] jesus christ now don't get too focused
[1:39:52] on the man here
[1:39:54] focus on what god is doing behind that
[1:39:56] man
[1:39:59] has revealed himself in a supernatural
[1:40:01] way in this day
[1:40:06] the house is full of pharisees you can't
[1:40:09] get in you can't get in to see it
[1:40:15] belief doesn't hinder god one bit
[1:40:18] someone's gonna see that get confident
[1:40:34] there must be a people
[1:40:37] that are getting ready to inherit
[1:40:41] a promise
[1:40:43] that has been laid up a sword in ages
[1:40:45] and ages
[1:40:50] now there can be some people will take
[1:40:52] it in a lazy way
[1:40:57] some people could say well i'll just
[1:40:58] take the easy part of the land
[1:41:00] where the enemy is i'm not going to take
[1:41:01] that
[1:41:15] and they begin to flip through the pages
[1:41:18] and it's it's no longer sealed to them
[1:41:22] they begin to they begin to see
[1:41:25] who jesus christ is jesus
[1:41:28] but not just who jesus christ
[1:41:45] but the bride has to become to a
[1:41:46] position where she realizes who she is
[1:41:51] inheritance
[1:41:53] unless you look at it by faith and say
[1:41:55] lord i need that for god
[1:42:06] he said that there came
[1:42:10] in 21 9 he says there came to me enough
[1:42:13] one of the seven angels which had the
[1:42:15] seven vials of the seven last plagues
[1:42:23] and talked with me saying come hither
[1:42:26] madrid
[1:42:41] now when is this wife going to be
[1:42:42] revealed
[1:42:46] you see the book was sealed back in the
[1:42:47] dark ages
[1:42:52] i know i know
[1:42:54] yeah
[1:43:07] and he'd heard about the power of jesus
[1:43:09] christ
[1:43:11] he had seen the power of jesus christ
[1:43:15] but as he was standing on that boat and
[1:43:17] he washed that spirit walking on the
[1:43:19] water
[1:43:35] he saw jesus walking on water
[1:44:05] well how close can the creation get to
[1:44:06] god
[1:44:10] and how much closer can his people get
[1:44:12] to it
[1:44:15] well how much closer can his sons and
[1:44:17] daughters get to him
[1:44:45] and now he began to sink yeah
[1:44:48] and it turned from wanting to walk on
[1:44:50] water
[1:44:55] now he needed to walk
[1:45:00] he needed the power of jesus christ
[1:45:04] you can you can look at jesus from a
[1:45:06] distance all day long
[1:45:08] admire his mighty works you can admire
[1:45:11] all of these but let me tell you
[1:45:13] if there is a bride to our lord and
[1:45:15] savior
[1:45:18] there's got to be someone that's walking
[1:45:20] with him step by step
[1:45:24] paul said that we are flesh with his
[1:45:26] flesh paul i didn't
[1:45:27] share bone of his bones
[1:45:32] and we've had all the denomination ideal
[1:45:35] denominational ideas of what it meant to
[1:45:37] be the body of christ
[1:45:41] in the future
[1:45:57] developing i'll tell you that little
[1:45:59] portion
[1:46:00] of this is just as powerful as the fault
[1:46:05] you know and
[1:46:06] let me tell you i'm not going to be one
[1:46:08] that stands back
[1:46:51] but let me tell you melissa
[1:47:06] amen
[1:47:07] jesus christ seed he went the word he
[1:47:09] went down into the earth
[1:47:14] now sc now just here in closing i know
[1:47:16] i've taken a long time
[1:47:19] let's just go over to ephesians real
[1:47:21] quick
[1:47:36] ephesians chapter 4
[1:47:39] this will be my last scripture
[1:47:45] in verse 8
[1:47:48] he said wherefore when he
[1:47:50] ascended up on high.
[1:47:54] he led captivity captive
[1:47:58] now i'm glad he did
[1:48:00] praise god he did that
[1:48:02] i needed that
[1:48:17] now what do these gifts do
[1:48:20] if there's gifts given to man how can we
[1:48:22] benefit from it
[1:48:27] what's the end result of those gifts
[1:48:29] upon the church
[1:48:57] there's a couple reasons here
[1:49:00] reason number one
[1:49:02] for the perfecting of the saints
[1:49:06] now the english word perfect
[1:49:10] it's kind of complicated
[1:49:13] we say perfect and we think oh never
[1:49:15] making a mistake
[1:49:20] that there is complete
[1:49:21] me
[1:49:23] completion
[1:49:26] for the completion of the church
[1:49:32] to come it's a complete it's whole so
[1:49:35] it's a complication
[1:49:40] for the perfecting of the saints
[1:49:44] for the work of the ministry
[1:49:46] um
[1:49:48] the love for the minister and the
[1:49:51] edifying of the body of christ
[1:49:57] now if those gifts are given to us
[1:50:01] then there's got to be someone that's
[1:50:02] going to stand up and say yo
[1:50:09] then god has given me something that i
[1:50:11] can come back
[1:50:12] come to completion
[1:50:16] wherever he had in his mind before the
[1:50:18] foundation of the world
[1:50:22] so the body of christ could be edified
[1:50:26] now how long are these gifts going to be
[1:50:27] in operation
[1:50:32] how long will these today did they end
[1:50:33] at the day of pentecost
[1:50:36] did they end when john the bat when john
[1:50:38] the revelator died
[1:50:49] these gifts will be operating until
[1:50:55] next week
[1:50:57] it's the body of christ
[1:51:00] until we
[1:51:02] the body
[1:51:03] all come in the unity of the faith
[1:51:10] so we know it's going to be gleason
[1:51:11] until that so we all come into the unity
[1:51:12] of faith
[1:51:14] and that's part of our inheritance now
[1:51:16] it belongs to us just understand
[1:51:33] and to the knowledge of the son of god
[1:51:37] oh yeah yeah i know jesus came
[1:51:40] oh yeah
[1:51:41] sure sure sure i know i know
[1:51:45] oh it's church
[1:51:47] these
[1:51:48] there's more to jesus christ than that
[1:51:50] yeah
[1:51:53] there's more to jesus christ than that
[1:51:54] yeah
[1:51:56] we will speak with all of eternity
[1:51:57] coming to the knowledge
[1:52:07] and unto a measure of the stature of the
[1:52:09] fullness of christ
[1:52:13] now if these things are given to us
[1:52:16] look at your own cells
[1:52:19] now i'm not here to preach a pitchfork
[1:52:21] religion
[1:52:23] well that's your brother so-and-so and
[1:52:25] that was so so nothing wrong
[1:52:27] down into your heart no
[1:52:39] do you know what jesus is doing right
[1:52:41] now in this hour
[1:53:10] you know they all had lamps
[1:53:13] it didn't matter whether they were wise
[1:53:15] or whether they're physical
[1:53:18] and psalms says thy word oh lord as a
[1:53:20] lamp unto my feet
[1:53:36] they all had a time when their word was
[1:53:38] working for him
[1:53:41] they had a time where their word was
[1:53:43] working
[1:53:46] there was a time when luther's message
[1:53:47] was working
[1:53:50] there was a time when wesley's message
[1:53:52] was working
[1:54:06] the church says
[1:55:02] is
[1:55:28] she knew that there had to that if her
[1:55:30] if her aunt if her lamp ever began to
[1:55:32] get low of oil
[1:55:37] that she knew she had to know the place
[1:55:39] of the refilling
[1:55:43] she had again she kept it right by her
[1:55:45] side
[1:55:48] she washed it she wouldn't even let
[1:55:49] anybody else get nervous
[1:55:52] version came to get something
[1:55:58] because she knew she had a duty
[1:56:01] and this is what her duty was is it
[1:56:04] to shine the light all the way to the
[1:56:05] wedding
[1:56:11] all the way to the wedding supper of the
[1:56:12] land just goes to speak
[1:56:14] shine the light shine the light that
[1:56:16] burning word
[1:56:18] that revealed words
[1:56:21] things that god said
[1:56:26] amen so she finally begins to look just
[1:56:29] like he looks
[1:56:32] nice
[1:56:36] by a simple humility
[1:56:54] amen
[1:57:06] there was times when we could get away
[1:57:08] with the lamp
[1:57:36] let's just stop right there zones are

[1:57:57] on the word of god
[1:58:00] you begin to be transformed
[1:58:03] for me it comes for me constantly into
[1:58:06] his image
[1:58:09] as you begin to feed on the word for
[1:58:11] your day
[1:58:14] word that's been expressed for the day
[1:58:16] that we're living in
[1:58:18] the power
[1:58:33] the word
[1:58:35] you submit yourself to him
[1:58:38] things begin dropping off
[1:58:44] beginning to look like that one that

[1:58:46] beginning
[1:58:51] [Music]
[1:59:00] yeah heavenly father i just want to
[1:59:03] thank you lord

[1:59:12] you would be given the preeminence
[1:59:30] that that veil is no longer on the

[1:59:39] and all those hearts while their veil
[1:59:42] cannot see
[1:59:47] but lord if that veil ever be taken away
[1:59:53] then they will begin to see you along
[1:59:56] and once they see you it asks you to why
[1:59:58] then they begin to be transformed by you
[2:00:01] transforming
[2:00:02] from glory to glory
[2:00:06] the lutheran message to the methodist
[2:00:08] methods
[2:00:38] but now we're seeing a resurrection
[2:00:41] and as that resurrection
[2:00:43] takes place
[2:00:46] we begin to be changed
[2:00:48] transform transforming into your glory
