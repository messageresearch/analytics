TRANSCRIPT
========================================
everybody there it reads stand fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ have made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage Ephesians the next book over we go to the sixth chapter reading from the 13th verse we'll read down to the fourteenth wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness well no scripture Zechariah the fourth chapter beginning at the sixth verse then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of Hosts who art Thou O great mountain before the rouble thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shouting crying grace grace unto it let us pray do you have any father we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us we pray Lord God that you bless the service here tonight in a special way Lord we are depending on you forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness we pray father God that you bless your speaker tonight you move completely out of your way and that you be able to speak to your people in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated we're surely glad to see everybody here tonight I got two of my favorite sisters back they're glad to see you by God's grace glad to see you you know when we look at tonight we we want to take our time and try our best to not hurry so much but we also want to be in a place where you will be able to see what God is doing we have heard many times of election and we have our thoughts and our minds about what it is election in itself is a revelation even though you can read it and you know it's God's choosing God electing you or you know but it must be a revelation to you you must know that you are elected by God in people said I came to Jesus you know the only way that you can come to Jesus is that Jesus Christ draw you said you know even Jesus said you can't even come to me except my father draw you and he's speaking of the Holy Spirit it's always about the Holy Spirit now we're living in the last day but I same times you know we fail to see how much God loves us when God gave Adam and Eve a covenant they broke it and from that point on whenever he would give men Covenant covenants they would break it and no matter what it was I mean you know we're we're flesh men with part Beast and part God or man how we want to look at it we are hybrids from the fall but with with all that with saying all of that we still have representation and that's what makes God interested in us is because of the representation that God placed in us before the foundation of the world now in a theological definition of election is as the choice by god of an individual individuals and for a particular work or for favor or salvation in other words you are God's choice and and you know the Bible tells us that we were chosen in him you know he didn't go to a grocery store to get you or some shelf in heaven but if we were in him and and even even saying that it is a revelation you know comes because we think about being in something like something put you in there but no one put you in God you were always in God see because if something put you in God something can take you out of God so as God existed you were always there and these are mines of ours we can't understand that but we believe that because that's basically what the message tells us it gives us such an assurance of our salvation Amen you know more like you know Calvinistic beliefs you know once saved always saved well that's true but when you really are say there are manifestations of your salvation that it's proof is vindicated Amen that you are saved now I haven't gotten to the main Scriptures yet I just read those scriptures because I want you to understand that if you you move out of grace you move into law and law will always kill you law will always condemn you right law has been placed in your life to prove and to show you you cannot be perfect but grace is what takes us there election is what takes us there now grace is old it's not something new grace is as old as the world is and believe you me grace was forced first shown to human race when he had began in the beginning or when God began to make human race when the human race was first created in the Garden of Eden on that dog'll awning when that little woman that stepped across the separating line and they're going against God Commandments and separated in the separated line and going against God commandment and enticing her husband to do the same thing then the law was broken cuz you and I know the law sir you gonna shoo lead I if you do this thing you're gonna surely die the law must have a penalty a penalty or it's not a law right what user making a law if there's no consequences behind that law if you if it would to be broken a man so there was a penalty and it was sin and and you know God in rich in mercy hallelujah comes along and gives out and he grace he didn't give the serpent grace matter of fact he didn't even give the serpent a way out he never introduced the blood to the serpent he only put the coats of skin on Adam and Eve why because they were elected they were chosen to do what they were doing believe you me the serpent though chosen was chosen to be a vessel of dishonor but he God needed that vessel of dishonor in order to show the vessel of Honor hallelujah so you and I must know that election stands I want you it's a powerful revelation to me because when the devil that has kicked you around a little bit that don't you understand God allows them to do that you know you go self as a Christian if you think that you know it's gonna be easy on you you are mistaken that's why we need grace it's almost it seems like a disadvantage that we fight in Lucifer in this flesh but because of it God being a just God brings grace and election he puts us in a place that no matter what Satan does or try to do he cannot stop the purpose of God the purpose of god is going to stand with you no matter what the devil does oh sometimes we cry sometimes we feel so far away from God as if God can't see us hallelujah Amen the Bible said even the nighttime even darkness is like light to God is that right David said if I make my bed and he'll die out there no matter where I go he's there hallelujah grace is always right law is always wrong understand law is there because I want you to understand law is not to be practice law is to be lived right because life is allowed life in itself will produce things is that right because if life is in you it is going to what manifests itself life is love life is God right and if life is there it has laws mm-hmm so you can understand when I'm where I'm going with this that's why the Bible says each seed every seed will bring forth of its kind because the life or the law of life is that life will make it happen is that right if you are corn seed like cannot transform you into anything other than corn if you are customer like can only produce or make that Kaka burro come to its manifestation right it's your truth this is no matter if it was a pig it still has life God has to make the pig live see show what I'm trying to tell you is that if you are truly sons and daughters of God God is going to make it happen hallelujah so you say otherwise is not in your hands that's the problem we always tried to put our salvation in that's what Adam did when he failed he put salvation in his hand he thought he conforming and shape and put on a fig leaf on him that was going to be okay that's religion God you can't you you the only when you meet God with religion guess what you naked only salvation like I preach the others they only the blood of Jesus Christ the blood of Jesus Christ is the only thing that can hide you from God is that right he cannot see you when you under the blood he hears your voice but he cannot see you thank God grace is always right not what you do is what you believe is it right it isn't works lest any man should boast and we find people that will boast but what you posted on all you are God made you if there is boasting it must be in Christ is that right that's why Paul said bear with me and my little folly he said the Pharisees I am the Pharisee I'm the one being brainless I'm the one but Paul said that is folly but I'm gonna bring you to a point because so y'all say o that you're the stalk of the stalk but he says not only am I uh-uh-uh-uh-uh Jew but I am the finest of the Jews see but he said that's foolishness because really god you're not known if God is not going to know the Jew by the flesh how you feel figure he gonna know you by the flesh circumcision is by the heart by the spirit that's how God comes to know you that's how you and I become Jewish Israelites however you want to put it Amen we are the spiritual Israel now we find out that the ruble coming down with the headstone and I love this because it comes down with a double portion of grace I need a double portion anybody in here don't need a double portion I need a double portion because I see it's every day I battle is every day I fail hallelujah is every day I need His grace I need his mercy as long as I've walked as a Christian I can say every day I needed His grace and His mercy every day and all I know is that the more he loves me the more I want to love him oh if I could just love God the way God loves me ooh if you are true seed and this isn't a Smyrna Church age you will hear that word the Spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and age hidden side just hear it he said receive it that's a man taking it in and living by it hallelujah if you are true seed if you are truly baptized with the Holy Ghost you will extreme his word above your necessary meat and yearn to live by everywhere that proceed out of the mouth of God now I don't know about you but I yearn to live it's me it's yearning see a lot of times we don't even realize that yearning is election it is relevant said even when we were sinners we always had that yearning to want to live for God we didn't know how to do it but it was something in us that made us know we were different that's election pulling on you even then and if God was pulling on you then did you think he gonna bring you to himself and lose you it cannot happen there's not a piece of God that could ever be lost and you and I are part of him right see he tells us in the in God's coming with Abraham he says that God says now Abraham my son I'm going to show you that it's not going to be nothing that you have to do I'm going to do it anyhow I'm to determine to save man regardless come on when the devil said you lost tell you a lie that's why I read that scripture remain free stand therefore in your Liberty where by grace have made you free who graves has made you free grace makes you free from the law of sin and death grace God's going to do it by grace he will do it oh when I think of that it just makes me want to scream see even the problem what the screams I'm dying I think oh nothing I could do nothing but the blood of Jesus I haven't got to offer nothing my utmost righteousness to yours would be filthy rags in his sight he's y'all heard me and so I'm a sinner to begin with and there's nothing I can do about it but something that he could do he took his blood and covered it over me like that so he sees me a righteous man because his son's blood made me righteous is that right put on the breastplate of righteousness why what is the Blessed the prep breastplate of righteousness is that blood covering that heart hallelujah you love the Lord see when God says I will it's already done right I will bless you it's already done I will save you it's already done she is all in the mind it's already done that is going to happen it's already done and all we have to do is wait for the manifestation of it hallelujah is that right see God saw the weakness of man that how he that he broke his covenant with him in the Garden of Eden then if you notice God making a covenant of the coming of Christ he never included anyone in it making the covenant of Christ he never included anyone he said I as a personal pronoun I will put in iniquity in him enmity between thy seed and the Serpent's seed C unconditionally do you see it unconditionally God said I will in other words see sin the Savior not now Adam if you do if you would do a certain thing out there see we will have never had a savior because Adam would have never done it but he said I will and when God says I will is already done hallelujah that's why Paul said we are now sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus already hallelujah oh we worry about the church without spot wrinkle or blemish don't y'all think about that sometimes oh I do God is looking for a church but I want you to know election stand God will make it happen look how many years God had to work with Abraham just to get him humble huh work with him all those years just to get him humble to a place where he's humbled Abraham was selfish he had fear he feared that the king would take his life and take his wife but listen what election does election races all your mistakes is that right it does because in the New Testament the Bob said Abraham stumbled not at the promises Oh see what I'm trying to say is that what but the devil tries to do to us every day is to get us a look at our failures and I won't the devil to know I have a lot of mistakes but when I'm under the blood while under the blood no matter what you accused me uh God cannot see what you're saying the blood fails me the blood fails you hallelujah election Spain that's why the devil hates you that's why he loves to pick on you he'd love to get that opportunity to kick you around a little bit probably letting off the pressure hallelujah amen but you if the truth of the matter is we're the only one they could accept the blood the blood of jesus christ weren't for angels it works for Sarah films and cherubims hallelujah it was only for sons and daughters of God and we have been chosen in this day to manifest that the blood of Jesus Christ still prevails is God doing hallelujah I believe in eternal security in this way I believe that the church has eternal security and as long as you are in Christ or in the church you are secured with the church that right as long as you are in the church you are secured with the church now then how do you get into the church by joining know by one spirit we're all baptized into one body not Methodist not Baptist not Pentecostal but one spirit first Corinthians we are baptized into one fellowship and in there as long as we're in this fellowship the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us continually but continually not today in this skip tomorrow continually God looking through the red as we have said less I see the red sinner but see your white through red then God for know and see the church is going to be whether you are in it or I am in it it will appear before God without spot or without Rico God done sin so that settles it forever now he's never said the church will be William Branham he said the church would be there and she would be a glorious church washed in the blood ironed out would be with our spot eco you go go through it he will iron out all those wrinkles in your life he's gonna wash all the trash out of your life but at the end of the day election says you'll be there election says you are there hallelujah and the delegate do we know how he hates this little group he hates us and then because we trust the word at the end of the day when the devil is from the mind all day you know in actions and words and these at the end of the day all I can do is say Lord I trust you I trust you he they begun the good work in us is faithful to complete it he's gonna complete it I am NOT gonna doubt that I don't know how he's gonna do it but he said and if he said he's gonna do it it's already completed hallelujah yes the devil don't want us to know these things about us amen Romans 9 10 through 18 says and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither have done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that call it hallelujah is that right come on somebody because you got to realize you had Jacob and Esau right he saw was really the first boy but God said Jacob is going to rule over Esau it was God's election that made Jacob rule Oh Esau hallelujah what did Jacob do Oh Jacob was as a shyster but guess what he meant the promise he wanted more God he had respect for the Holy Ghost if you've got respect for the Holy Ghost God will give it to you hallelujah it may take a while you might have to wrestle with the age or one night but the promise is your if you respect the Holy Ghost God will give you the Holy Ghost because that's what Jacob Jacob had respect for the birthright hallelujah and because of that respect God made it happen Jacob didn't know he was going to meet an angel he didn't know that he was going to have to fight hallelujah he wasn't prepared for it but there was something on the inside of him that wanted God more than anything and when that angel said let me go let me go I got another dude in it before Jacob said I ain't gonna let you go to your best man hallelujah he overcame the angel hallelujah you see because he was thirsting for this ride he's seen it you know you got it you know this message is yours you know it is your inheritance hallelujah but you want to see it live hallelujah that is somebody else but in you you want to see living in you and God has already appointed the time that he's going to meet with you don't give up on God because God is not going to give up on you hallelujah y'all remember the time Gideon had practically given up on God if God be with us we're Bo the miracles see God don't like that kind of talk gotta call him on the scene you go cut your hair you challenging God God gonna come on the scene with that kind of legacy oh I see you you one of mine and you've got no right talking like this so I got to show you something hallelujah and then with God come to Gideon he didn't say oh you're coward weak something you know what he said that mighty man of Valor even Gideon didn't even know he's I'm a demon so God said i'ma show you I'm real because that when I'm done with you you're gonna be a mighty man of Valor God had already said it and that's what he's trying to tell you and I we may look weak but we have a message in a perfect weakness we gave perfect strength hallelujah weaknesses where God really wants you to be because he wants to show you his greatness how great he is you say oh I can't overcome God said yes you can Paulino yeah I'm gonna overcome and have overcome for you hallelujah oh god help us Jesus hallelujah what should we say then right he said answer the written Jacob I have love but he saw I have hated what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God god forbid hmm but he said unto Moses that I have mercy on whom I have mercy and I have compassion on whom I have compassion you know I look at people and they look so sad when they're in church and I'm like yeah what's wrong with y'all people you know you're gonna get tired cuz you're in the flesh sometime but your joy all the way all the way all to remain he said I hope I trust that your your joy will remain your joy will be fulfilled hallelujah amen you see you get more from God if you continue to hold on to your joy well you get more you get more from God Jimmy for you said to Moses I emerged on whom I have mercy and I have compassion of whom I have compassion so then it is not him that willeth know of him that run it but of God that showeth mercy either like that part hallelujah somebody might have a greater wheel than me hallelujah somebody may be able to run faster than I can haul it but it ain't all of that ah hey man sometime I wish to myself us own lawn if I could quote like some of these brothers and have all that but you know what right here what probably as wide as this pulpit God knows what he's doing he knows he didn't hosted so far hallelujah him so he gives me some time I'm stuttering and skipping and everything else but at the end of the day when they had an auntie come it gets across by God's grace amen so then it is not of him that will involve him that running but of God the show of mercy for the for the scripture said in the Pharaoh even for the same purpose have I raised Dee up that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth and it's amazing Moses was a was a rep refugee and then he ran all righty he had to get up out of Egypt and though Pharaoh walk white all the name cuz I went to Egypt I've been teaching and in their history they don't have no place where Moses even existed you talked to an atheist about that say see it had to be a story hallelujah but when you got the Holy Ghost you know it's real hallelujah one time I remember this man saying to one of my pastors or I pass the register where said well the place that Moses went across was a sea of reeds and my pastors my past I got so excited to praise God you mean to tell me that God drowning Moses army in a sea of reeds that makes you more powerful hallelujah amen therefore see the word is right how can men look at the condition of this world and say not right and they think that by cutting it off by burning it you know even right now in the open California they're trying to ban the Bible then working real hard to make it illegal for you to have a Bible but they can teach our law outline we'll give them nothing cuz our law ain't got nothing to give and you know what eventually they're gonna win it's got to be but nevertheless and then you'll find some Christians don't hold a Bible you know what I'm saying well you know you look at now that Christians were a lot of Christians don't even love their Bibles anymore they really are ashamed you know they don't mind having it on an owner owner iPad or or phone but you know Holly see too many Christians carrying the Bible one time in America that's all you would see you go to Africa they stare Karen that's what impressed me about Africa cuz you know I can get on the corners you don't stop making my noise oh yeah I'll be dancing yeah and everybody come to my mama's come up they ready we preach right in the marketplace didn't have to have no church service scheduled you start Church tell you what when they see the little instruments coming those people are waiting on the bus on a taxi they just move right over in your area in America you know when they look at you like you're crazy it's a I used to preach on the corner didn't they made it illegal to preach on the corner gotta have our license now did you know that yeah you gotta have a permit cuz it's why are you preaching somebody get hit by our car get hurt then you be sued insanity backslidden yeah that's what stopped me because you had to have a permit romans 11 5 through 6 even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to election of grace and if by grace then it is no more of works otherwise grace is no more grace but if it be of watch then it is no more grace otherwise works is is no more words in other words its grace the unmerited favor of God because he made an unconditional covenant with you because he chose to do so Oh glory hallelujah every time I look at Israel it just declare election ooh here's a nation who was God said because of your disobedience this is going to happen to you Jeremiah lamentations everything it happened then God said I'm gonna bring you back it happened hallelujah Amen John wrote that Scripture souls crying under the altar how long way before it happened and it happened and you said what do you mean God also said according to Paul said Paul said I blinded to use the Jews so that I can give you space don't boast yourself against the branch hallelujah because they were blinded so that you can see go to God hallelujah God said that they were coming back to back to be a nation and then they had that same language they left with Hebrew Salani did it happen has it happened and it just boggles my mind we'll all of these I don't people say Iran and Iraq and all these going they gonna you know what's gonna happen who would have struck destroy the Jews who's gonna it's gonna be the church the union of the churches you know yes just like something I'm gonna tell y'all something a lot of people don't appreciate Trump but Trump is with all that he does he literally stopped the hand of God from falling on this nation especially when we started legalizing everything else come on somebody and he got in there start reversing Hey Oh what is he doing what did you know he's doing what God wants him to do that doesn't make him a Christian but you got to realize we had to reach the line god speed his head why cause maybe some of us ain't ready yet hallelujah is that all right now I personally believe I could be all together wrong in there don't don't say brother books prophesy but I just believe it's gotta be this Easter or the next that's how I feel this that's how close I feel it is all nature's telling us everybody tell my global warming it's judgment call it what you want to call it God in this whole earth Amen right is in travail hallelujah and you said all volcania rushing here I was telling everybody the other day I said listen did y'all remember how those those are earthquakes that are circling the globe on the Ring of Fire right and then now it hit Alaska what's next California it's already it's gone from Australia to New Zealand and all these other countries it's on this side now and brotherman said watch it when that serpent begins to wiggle her to his tail hmm then you not must understand by God's grace it's coming here but I believe that that is the same time of the resurrection I think it's in the sixth seal brother Whelan said that greater earthquake took place when Jesus rose from the dead and he tied it right into the California earthquake hallelujah it was such a shaking hallelujah and you gotta understand if this didn't shake Jerusalem it shook the whole world when Jesus raised from the dead and I know they say millions or years this happened but some some believe that's when the Grand Canyon was formed I don't know but all I know is it was formed and what went up got to come down right oh I'm so happy my great God's grace and what has come down got to go up and just glad about that we came down but we go up hallelujah God doesn't make any difference between his children every son they come to God must first be tried or chasing chest eyes you get it first he be tried or chasing corrected child chain train school everyone not one exception every son have you went through trials have you went through tribulations have you suffered persecution then you in do it then you endured these things you are real you are real children of God is that when you go through these things and you endure them that shows you are a real child of God but when you can't bear chest husband when the rod comes down heavy and you run off and back into the world the Bible said you were illegitimate children and not the children of God for when a man's born of the Spirit of God he expect those things and he loved those things and the Bible said that trials that comes upon us fiery trial is more precious than gold to us think of it it is this is what trials make me know it brings a revelation into my heart that no matter what I go through I'm most dear loving not one trial in all the years I've walked as a Christian has ever made me not want to love God even more because I realized at the end of the day he's the one that brought me through it perfect strengths the weaknesses that's what God wants to show you you go go through it you gonna be there gonna be times you gonna feel like you don't have one holy ghost all your experience is gone you know why because God don't want you to rest on your feelings you don't you don't feel God in that what makes you save hallelujah faith is a substance you got something greater than feelings hallelujah you think about old blind Fanny Crosby when the test came on her and they want her to write rock and roll music and all that stuff and said what good is it going to do you what if it happens you go to heaven and you steal blind she said I shall know him I shall know I love that scar in his hand that's how she got that that revelation of that hill hallelujah so you gotta understand every trial and test you go through brings about a revelation of Christ go through the Bible every trial every tribulation every time they went through something when they came through that fire they had a greater revelation of God personalized signature is that right because all our trials are different is that Alright amen brother Brown says in perfect strength he says I was reading of the book of Romans the fourth chapter where Paul wrote the divine commentary of the life of Abraham now we know that Abraham many times got kind of frustrated like we do know yeah because y'all don't get frustrated but when his commentary was written there wasn't any of his frustrations mentioned you see never mentioned them at all and that's what it is sometimes we forget we're men we're women we're human we're flesh and we're going to be that until we change a your flesh ain't glorified yet it's God in you I'm almost done folks a man abraham staggered not at the promise of God through a belief but was strong giving praise strong give him praise that's why I say don't let you and stop you from praising God you are elected you are chosen you are under the blood you are protected you are sheltered in the show you ought not be afraid of the Stalin praise them even in the time of the storm hey man when it looked like no there's no way out understand the Bible said with every temptation God has already made a way of escape it's already there you and I just got to find a way to get out hallelujah hey man in there our way I hope see there's not not my mistakes and then and everything just but just what I try to do the intention of my heart is to do for God's people you know and as I said on Sunday when it comes to two kinds of people there's two kinds of people brother I said he said they're that kind that don't want to sin he said that's what the grace of God came for those who don't want to sin he said now there are those people who are just don't care see and that's the difference between the good seed and the bad seed the good seed don't want to see right they were trapped into it right yeah and but that that one that you you find people who don't care they can just walk all over you and it doesn't bother them you know you got people who can kill somebody to let the body stay there while they eat eat a burger or something you know that might be a little exaggerated but people are just that hard they don't care you know they don't care right it's right in wars now in all the countries Syria where were you they maybe they can just kill kill kill different people right people with don't know mercy just as cold as a serpent mm-hmm right I'm almost done I'm finished I trust you you see what I'm trying to say remember last week I talked about escape to the city escape you know coming out from where you are understand that God has a place of shelter in every situation you know the thing I love about these cities they were placed upon the hill and so therefore you could see them and they were very accessible easy to get to understand this in order to see Christ daily you must always look up when you own your knees you're looking up now when I say that I mean you know that card is your head right he's in your heart but he's and he is your head he's one you were always looked up to because he is the domain city he's the one the great right he's the light that brings light to the city right see now Jeremiah 51 22 23 says thou art my battle axe and weapons of war for with thee will I break in pieces the nations and I end with thee will I destroy kingdoms and with thee will I break in pieces the horses and his riders and with thee without breaking pieces to cherish and his rider now here God could do it himself but he said but with you I'm gonna do these things so God in this day with us we have a purpose and God purpose is to you to do to bring forth his real father all day but how is he gonna do it not with a whirlwind with you with us right with thee will I breaking pieces man and woman and with thee without breaking pieces old and young and with D without breaking pieces there young man and the maid and I was also breaking pieces ease in the shepherd when his flock and with thee without breaking pieces to husbandmen and his yoke of oxygen oxen and with thee will have breaking pieces captains and rulers right so understand you have a part in this your election right God said I have come down but who did he sin Moses hmm see so you gotta understand when God want to use somebody he wants your body to use it to be used by him he wants you you have a part in the and then this is what I love about God he rewards you for allowing him to use your body and yet he made it mmm who let me hurry you know what I'm just gonna hold some of this because it's like another sermon but this is one of the quotes and I hope you know well a brother gave me and you don't know this quote so you can understand the prophet of God are saying something in the second coming he says all the sin of Ages is settling down into the generations of people that we live in now all the weaknesses from our fathers of inbred traditions is failed and sicknesses and diseases breaking out like never been known in all the world and then another thing I believe that when Satan which was prophesized would go about like a roaring lion in the last day to destroy mortal life and spiritual life and everything that he could I believe then if that's all dumping all of the evil is being dumped out on the human race in this day I believe that all the blessings will be dumped out as it was or poured out rather by Heavenly Father upon the church in the last days and what a day that we're living in so you guys say what you mean especially in America we supposed to be the most healthiest you know but we are looking at they putting up hospitals everywhere it's true it's true we were so health-conscious but then we got the most sickest people it's true Wow cuz we so sinful I'm not talking about John I'm John I'm almost done brother hey man I appreciate you so we're looking at these things and you know he said listen if that be the case of God is dumping Satan is dumping all his garbage into the people sickness everywhere all kind of diseases and everything else what about God's Holy Spirit see that's what we need to be concentrating on you know God don't mind you said like Gideon Lord I've read in the Bible I mean they've told me you know historically I've heard what you did with Israel but if you be with us where are you it make personalized if you be with us where well where are you I want to see you right there's nothing wrong with that you know let him let him do what he wants to do after that statement but a question but my point is you need to be seeking God and like the probably God said take him at his word sometimes we're so afraid for these you don't just because the faith we're so afraid to ask God for great things but we supposed to ask him for great things well if that right he didn't say now if you see this pebble if you want to speak to that pebble and that pebble gonna move out of the way no he took a mountain which is a great thing he want to show his greatness among us oh he said I just love it I hope out you see you see them coming it'll be there anyhow but see my point is we need to come and close on this we ought to be yearning for more of him and I'm gonna say you pray for me and I pray for you yearning for more of him why not not afraid oh I'm gonna be lost no no if you sit still and don't look don't do nothing from this point on and God has elected you to be bride you'll be bride nothing can change it let's tan it's not by works it's by the grace of God don't let the devil make you feel like oh I'm lost in God I know what I'm talking about because he tried to anoint me too with all that unbelief and then at the end of the day you you're almost sick of your stomach took because of what he you know he's done fed in your head you know but then you gotta say no no no no God's grace is sufficient for me hmm I don't know the next move I love it the way brother Digg said the other day just show me the next step just show me the next step lord if I could just take the right step the next step make it the right step I know I'm going in the right direction god is good do we have that host do we have that song with the verse god is good all the time he put a song free in this heart of mine started good all the time in the dark is night
