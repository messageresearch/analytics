[36:11] the if there has been some people in the
[36:15] church

[36:51] he told me if you asked me to forgive
[36:54] you was that the cleanest Advantage you
[36:58] are clean before God and before brothers
[37:01] so I wanted to let you know that
[37:05] if you have heard something about that
[37:11] it's not something that he had against
[37:13] me because I stole his mind
[37:17] but it was something that happened back
[37:20] home in our church
[37:23] and we fixed everything
[37:26] [Music]

[40:09] and the Earth was without form and void
[40:15] and darkness was upon the face of the
[40:18] deep air let's pray the Jews
[40:20] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[40:23] face of the waters
[40:28] let there be light and there was light
[40:33] and God saw the light and that it was
[40:36] good
[40:39] and God divided the light from the
[40:42] darkness
[40:44] and God called the light day

[50:41] like he did for that old start that's
[50:44] the Earth

[51:35] Ellen
[51:38] [Applause]
[51:41] and there was like
[51:43] [Music]
[51:44] the light comes from God
[51:49] the light comes from God
[51:51] [Music]
[51:53] the light comes from his spoken word
[51:57] and the spoken word said
[52:00] let there be light
[52:05] and when there was no light
[52:11] he sent his life his light to divide
[52:14] Darkness from the light and the brothers
[52:19] that word of Commandments
[52:26] to the heavens
[52:29] when God spoke he said that let it be
[52:32] light Abraham says
[52:35] that word that came from God
[52:39] brought light to the heaven
[52:43] so that the sun could shine
[52:48] that what God did in the beginning today
[52:54] his word
[52:55] a second is
[52:59] though the thing that Cast Away
[53:02] unbelief
[53:05] God pronounced himself
[53:12] it was the spoken word of God
[53:16] and the same way God spoke in the
[53:19] beginning
[53:29] it's the thing that casts away the
[53:32] atmosphere of Darkness
[53:36] God cannot pronounce his words
[53:40] and that word failed to be fulfilled
[53:45] the word of God is eternal God is
[53:49] eternal
[53:53] his word Remains the Same
[53:57] his word can never fail to come
[54:03] she is God
