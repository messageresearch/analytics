jesus having him live in my life live through my life and let my life be his life let us stand i'll be preaching a message tonight and i trust i can get all get through it in in such a way that you'll be blessed uh we're living in the last days and we see so many things happening and i think people are not aware of what's really happening uh they don't understand that the devil has a trap and all of the easy living that we are now uh enjoying if not careful will come back and bite us one day brother branham tells us that the dangers of this age is easy living and i'm coming to understand what he means i just wish i had and was able to put these up at the board but i i don't um didn't get a chance to go to uh get these what they call the illumina laminated can you do these pictures no but anyway you have to have it laminated i think in order to put them up but nevertheless we'll we'll explain things to you as we go let us turn to matthew the second chapter matthew's the second chapter i was really compelled to come to church i knew that many weren't would not be here but i felt like this message was for whoever should be here and for those who are listening by the grace of god on on the uh youtube we hope that this message becomes a reality and a real blessing to you it was some things that god began to show me none of my own myself but a brother shared some things with me which triggered a lot of thoughts by god's grace and i kind of compiled some of the things he he brought with the things that god was showing me and i trust by god's grace that this message would be a blessing to you it may even sound like a christmas message but it's not matthew 2 and 11 and when they would come into the house they saw the young child with mary his mother and fell down and worshipped him and when they had opened their treasures now now they open their treasures but i want you to take note to what their treasures are they presented unto him gifts gold frankincen and myrrh let us pray father god we come before you and we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves and father there is no words to express our gratitude all the things that you're doing and has done for us and we realize oh god that was it's going home time and amen and as we approach this time things are going to get worse and times are going to get harder and we understand that the trials and the tribulations also will escalate for the believer but by god we have confidence in your word because you said you'll never leave us nor will you forsake us and so we thank you right now oh god because your word is sure and we believe you lord and we trust you with all our hearts i pray tonight oh god that you'll bless the reading and the preaching of this word may it be a blessing to all those who would hear in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated i'm going to read also from romans 12 and 1 it says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service so here paul is writing to the romans and and he's literally telling them that you need to present your body as a living sacrifice and uh when we talk about a sacrifice it's not something that's enjoyable it is something that is done in honor of and so we we thank god for that because paul is saying you need to present yourself now according to revelations 13 excuse me according to revelations 3 and 18. we are told in this particular book here john writes and says counsel i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire the dollar made be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes have that thou mayeth see and i like to say tonight amen by the grace of god that that's what i see i see that there are a lot of people who are not seeing they don't see the role that they're playing in this drama but understand it is a very serious role and uh we must understand by god's grace that uh the bible tells us history repeats itself but just going back to the first scripture i read that has always caught my mind in the sense of what these gifts were and what did they do what did they represent understand by god's grace that when these wise men came to uh the child jesus he was not as christian says a baby wrapped in swaddling clothing but the bible tells us he was of age around two to three years old when the wise men came now so we want to kind of work with that thought by the grace of god because the bible tells us that when he brought these gifts to him christ jesus he didn't bring him to mary they brought him to jesus so these gifts had to tie into who jesus was and what he came to do so history calls them kings and of course that's not scripture the bible said that they were wise men and and we know that these that term king didn't come into play until a little after 300 years uh you know after the death of christ and y'all know what happened at late uh at the niocia a lot of things changed during that time but according to the persian word or the word that would be used in that time we understand that that word wise men in the persian understanding would mean priests and that word preached would fit better than anything else even though they were astrologers and things like that but they were a priest of that particular faith now according to what brother branham says he they said indeed he said these three wise men started off in different places and they joined together and came to one place as did the stars the stars were three they were supernatural and then they came together amen signifying amen the trinity of god understand that by god's grace amen to three not not three persons but we it represented amen a lot of things that the god on earth the god of heaven was now on earth and so we realize amen that when these three kings understand each one of those stars represented the kings or the priests from which they came amen they came from different directions but at the end of the day those three lights became one so we understand the condition of the world when we think about the condition of the world when jesus was born it was born in a bad time oh yeah yet again it was a good time we understand that israel was really spiritually dead as a nation is that right they have mixed religion with roman politics is that the truth and so we realized by god's grace amen they had a mixture of politics and religion sound familiar and in that day we understand that the the city of jerusalem that was supposed to be such a great time of a place of worship and a place of life and a place of god we find out because they had mixed everything with roman theology and and doctrines and isms and schism they were dead and what they used to be was no longer there so much so that when the star appeared they never did see that star is that right so underneath all of this stuff we understand that the uh political power which which basically was a priest or the preacher amen uh uh working amen with with this um uh i'm sorry the political power working with the priest power amen it became they were backslidden and they were being ruled and they were being taught by scholars does that sound familiar so i want you to understand that in that time jerusalem should have been a glow but instead of them being a glow they were a glare and and it's like our organization like our pentecostal age you what had happened is that we've joined in with the political realm and so therefore we have become just like the jerusalem of jesus day amen because even when the star in our day appeared they couldn't see it why because they had the glare of of of of yesterday amen working with them is that right even the prophet of god tells us that that when when when when the wise of men when they entered in jerusalem uh the glare of jerusalem made them lose sight of the star hallelujah and so when they went into and i'm just going to go ahead and preach it when they went into jerusalem they went by way of herod and herod was the king there and uh herod was the controller he was the nicolaitan he was a dictator he was the man of rome that was really over all of jerusalem and they had mixed it of course you understand you've seen little stories and maybe little movies where the the sanhedrin and all of those who were supposed to be a spiritual priest of god was ruled by rome and so even when jesus christ came they didn't recognize him but let me go on by god's grace so we realized amen that herod who was the type of the nicolaitan rule of rome ruled israel the church as well they had a name that they were life and yet they were dead so how would you say that because john said so that's right amen and the king that would come along because any king any king understand that's the way rome was any king anybody that had an authority anything that that that came that had power became a threat to herod as well as the church sounds familiar so when our star appeared oh i'm gonna jump in here to myself because that's the way it was in our day when he appeared amen we wanted to know where the king of the jews was but this time it was the king of the gentiles hallelujah but we find out amen that god always chose bethlehem right i mean you take david it was bethlehem it was you know he always used bethlehem because the word bethlehem means the house of god's bread and we must understand that even though the bible tells us that here was amen uh this city bethlehem it was a notable it wasn't anything great matter of fact the bible said it was the least of judah's princes and and we find out that that's where god always hides himself not in the great big fashion uh fashionable things but little things that places where people would dare to look for him that's where he shows up so we know by god's grace amen herod was so upset because here was these wise men had followed the stars for thousands of miles to find this king and they were thrown off the track or thrown off by the glare of religion and politics hallelujah that's the same thing that's happening in the message people are being thrown off of a systematic way of worship is that right and anything outside of that systematic worship is deemed to die that's the way it's been and that's the way it is and we realize by god's grace amen that here we find that here was this this king and and he he he he wanted to know where was this child going to be born now watch this because these wise men they were wise enough to try follow god by faith right and the faith that the just shall live by what faith you can't even walk this message without faith because you and i don't know where we're going amen hallelujah we've never been this way before and so god is training us but understand this the way is the way of the cross this is a hard way this is a way of suffering this is a way amen that you and i must understand in order to get to heaven you've got to suffer first hallelujah we always talk about all when i walk those streets of gold but you in order to walk those streets of gold you must prove yourself on this side of the dimension so we realized by god's grace these three wise men lost sight of the star when they entered into jerusalem and why because it was a system of religion religion and politics mixed hello and we find out it's among us religion and politics and whenever you have religion and politics mixing you have a dead church you have a dead seed somewhere amen because that is not god amen days that are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god hallelujah look at these wise men they were wise in the sense that they were able to catch hear the voice or hear the unction or feel the unction of god and they left everything to follow that star alleluia there was nothing even the astrologers of of of the world didn't see the star the astrologers of jerusalem never saw the star hallelujah and so is it in our day that's right only the elected of god can see the star and they will always follow that star because that star will lead you where to bethlehem to the house of god's bread amen hallelujah yet the wise men were asked the question where is the why the wise man asked the question where is he that is born king of the jews for we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him understand me that star that you see has caused a lot of commotion you you may not see it and you may not know it but it's it's it's shaking uh the religious realm because they can't get rid of it and the more they try to get rid of it the more it prosper is that right because remember amen when herod the roman the the the spirit that operates that system found out that there was another king he was troubled and right now they're still troubled because they understand that there are those who are coming up just like he came up hallelujah it was more than just uh uh three three gifts and understanding the gifts that they gave were the most expensive gifts of that time frankincense gold and myrrh and we think oh my goodness gold gold but gold was one of the least of the three the most expensive was the frankincense the myrrh and then the gold but today gold means more than anything else you can get a little bottle of frankincense now you know for 9.97 on youtube but back in the day it was hundreds of dollars and that and then a few years ago they've made billions of dollars selling frankincense now frankincense come in different kinds of trees you know but we're talking about the frankincense frankincense amen that can only be found as i've been told in one place now i've seen other places but we've got to do a little bit more studying on that because it says it not only can it be found in arabia but it also can be found in east africa and when i looked up east africa i found out that in east africa ethiopia was there and that's where the king of sheba came from her herbs and her spices and all of those kind of things so anyway we're talking about with and this is saudi arabia see how it's so close to each other you can't see that but here's saudi arabia and here is the south uh east africa but anyway let me move on by the grace of god it's important to see that because you understand that this uh frankincense tree only grows in places that is most i say most impossible for a tree to grow in and in my study i was told that a frankincense tree franken incentree can literally grow out of a rock oh y'all didn't catch it oh my god because at the end of the day you're going to see where i'm going with this because you got to understand that when they brought these gifts to jesus christ and i see now that uh it it there was something um that they had in common and that each one of these gifts had to suffer in order to manifest its glory amen you understand me amen now it also is a is a it's it's it's like a shadow and a type of god bringing the bride of jesus christ to the baby child because remember jesus at the time had no seed but the the bride that was to come was to suffer amen she had to be bone of his bone flesh of his flesh she had to be just like him and so it was more to just frankenstein incense and gold but you you understand there was a shadow and a type of justification sanification baptism of the holy ghost all of that was included in that giving and understand this that each one of those gifts were given from a different nation right ham sham and jeopard right and they were the three sons of noah right with which was the whole pete the whole of god's people y'all understanding so each one of those gifts amen represented suffering and i don't want to get too much into that but understand the bethlehem of judah it was at least among the princes of judah and as i said it was the house of god's bread and when when i said the the the wise men when they left uh jerusalem which which you know brother bam said in jerusalem they went you know should have been going down hallelujah boulevard and all that but nobody was going they may have been going down there but the worship was gone where the priest of god once was and then by leaving the star the star appeared again y'all understand what i'm saying see if you're tied into the system of this message you'll never see him you'll never understand what he's requiring from you because the system the glare of this thing will blind you and keep you from seeing the true christ christ child now i'm going to say it like this so you can understand me when we come to this thing this is where we're missing it brother branham said easy living that that that's the thing that's that's that's that is killing the bride of jesus christ let you know i said the bride let's say like this message people all right because it can't kill the bride but message people are dying in their tracks because of easy living matter of fact the bible said when if a woman liveth in pleasure she's dead already and and as you can see the people who claim to have seen a star something has happened understand the devil is smart he understands what it takes to destroy is that right he understood giving uh job more riches wasn't going to you know make him deny god because he understood god gave him the riches but understand job even job had a thing about him that that that superseded everybody of his age because the bible said he was a perfect man amen and understand how you become perfect because paul says it like this jesus let's say the word says like this jesus learned his obedience through the things in which he suffered so you got to understand the perfection of job came by with all all of his sufferings hallelujah and that's the problem we want to easy living we don't want to suffer but i'm going to tell you something paul says i'm going to glorify him amen i'ma glorify him or whatever state i find myself in hallelujah if i'm suffering i'm gonna glorify him if i've got more than enough i'm gonna glorify him in whatever state he finds me i'm going to glorify him hallelujah is that right listen so that you understand it's not just stop they said we come to worship and honor him so there's there's a worship and there's honor right and in order to honor him you've got to honor him through your sufferings hello somebody he said oh my god you know why do i have to go through all of this praise him when you go through it bring the sacrifice of praise honor him because he is the one that's leading and the word of god said the shepherd knows the path in which he's leading you hallelujah understand this this is why we need a man to see the word manifested it's not enough to preach the message of the hour preach it and and make the people feel good but we need to see a a manifestation of it we need because what happens is that manifestation of the word preached will always keep the true believer on right on the right track and then we won't have to worry about a system coming to spoil it you understand me because we can see jesus amen see the impossible it's impossible to honor god without faith in the promised word of prophecy now god promised us that we were going to come to the perfect stature of a christ and and if you can't honor him amen you cannot truly honor him without having faith in those promises hallelujah see the manifested world will always bring the true believer under the right authority oh it's true see that's what happened amen in the earlier church amen things became common even the prophet god said to brethren tabernacle how common things are becoming and he began to say no no notice that the philistines is upon you what happens you're cooling off the things that used to excite you don't excite you anymore and you know why because they start praying and when you stop praying you stop crying and oftentimes god make hardships come on you to bring tears tears are important to god that's why the prophet god said he doesn't believe in a dry eye confession amen because those tears are important to god it is something god is doing in your life to so in order for you to honor him now let me go on and i'll be i'll be getting with this in just a minute so that roman denomination of spirit always tries to kill the effect of the word you know everybody want to put it in the system you you can't do this and you can't do that and it kills the effect because the bible says who he whom the lord have set free is free indeed and and we want to put god in a box this is why we don't we don't see the move of the holy ghost like we ought to and we don't see the power of god falling like we ought to and something's got to be wrong somewhere we have allowed a system a damnable system to enter in and we'd rather have this rigid thing going on than to probably brother i'm saying like this you ought to get out of order sometimes just to get the holy ghost people need the holy ghost you understand me and god cannot build upon you without the holy ghost and where was the christ child found in a manger hallelujah in in a stable with animals and everything else in other words in order for god to be born he must be born in your manger your unclean heart this is where god comes in and he brings you to a place of suffering amen is that right oh lord you say i have suffered brother i'm saying you haven't even suffered till you get the holy ghost that's when it all starts hallelujah is that right now i'm just bringing you to something because i want you to understand your suffering is not so bad abs actually it's for your good you've got to have listen my subject is the gift the gifts i bring and that frankincense that myrrh and that gold must be exemplified in your life in order to be accepted you'll never reach perfection and each one of those particular virtues of particular items or however you want to look at it as i said they have a common element and that is you have to suffer in order for it to bring out its glory or its glow right it has to be beaten amen hallelujah is that right it's got to be beaten it's got to be wounded hallelujah tears got to come assumption about it amen hallelujah in order for god to perfect samson he had to bring him into a place where he could be beaten shackled scone rejected cry all of those things wounded he had to have all of that before god could crown his ministry paul too let me move on by the grace of god so you got to understand you can't get out of this samson got to the place that he was literally blinded but guess what samson never lost his faith that's right amen hallelujah and he said oh lord oh lord once more if i've allowed myself to be controlled by the philistines so much soldier i'm blind i'm shackled i've lost my freedom in the spirit lord please sir grant me victory over these philistines is that right amen and as i said the other day i think about it samson was so determined about his destiny until he said lord let me die with him he committed suicide in order to kill his his enemy now ain't asking y'all to go do that i'm just telling you that's what samson did right and he ended up in the hall of fame amen in hebrews 11 samson was there glory to god but he had to go through something to get there but he came through as a sacrifice for truth and hebrews 11 32 would tell us that see in order to you to get there you've got to give god your best amen and those three uh uh uh wise men came with their best is that right oh come on somebody it's nothing but the truth you think about amen the uh mary you know the prostitute she didn't go get some some little uh weird perfume but she spent all she had she gave her best amen what was she doing she not only worshiped him and understand in that out of basketball was frankincense and she was showing by presenting this frankincense her own suffering so that she that's why the bible said this woman has done a major thing she has anointed me for what my suffering my sacrifice somehow she was anointed to understand that this man was frankincense a tree that was going to be wounded a tree that was going to be bruised because in order to get the shap out of the frankenstein tree you've got to cut it you got to bruise it and when you cut that tree amen the sap the raisins what they call it the r-e-s-i-n it seeps out hallelujah and they call it the tears of the tree and that tree cried jesus was a man and he cried tears and the beautiful thing about the frankincense tree is that when it does it forms a scab and that scab heals the wound but the scar remains that's why the bible says he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity and the chastise without peace was upon him and brother adam said it like this even though he's brought the healing the scars will remain there we'll see him amen at the end of the day with those nail pierced hands hallelujah what was it it was that it was that freaking sense that good smell y'all know what i'm saying and you got to understand that's how come god bruises you that's why he let people cut you that's why he let people harm you and do the wicked things they do against you he knows that out of that womb was going to come that real residence that's if you got the holy ghost hallelujah it's going to come it's going to heal that scar but at the same time that wound but the sky will remain hallelujah that's all right it's all right to have battle scars hallelujah and that's the way it is with with the with with the uh a true believer that's your gift to god not to go and fight not to retaliate none of us we do it sometime but that's not what god wants we've got to die to ourselves and that's where murray come in murr is murder's death murr is also somewhat like the frankincense tree but you know when you when you when you're getting the south out of the myrrh you got to go beyond the bark you got to really bring him a womb like that soldier did on calvary he just didn't scrape the side the top of the tree like it is with frankincense but he pierced him and then when you pierce that that murray tree that resins come out of it amen hallelujah but that murder is a healer used myrrh for healing did you know that and understand that even when it came to frankincense that the seed offering and and the sin offering uh they they could not have those without frankincense but when it came to myrrh they didn't use it like that but when jesus died married him came with their ointments and they wrapped him up in myrrh hallelujah because myrrh was that smell [Laughter] that literally covered the stench of your death somebody help me here see so you can understand by god's grace that these things are so much alike because you got to understand that even with gold you can find it in the river you can find it in the spring but most of the time gold you have to dig for and among the astrologers among the scientists i would say they say gold was a material that really when the supernova exploded that this node this supernova star exploded and a lot of pieces of the gold landed on earth think about it was a shadow of the type of god jesus who came from god and and landed on this earth deity gold is deity and the only way you can get it you got to escalate it this is what happens to you your trials your tests the things you go to sometimes is so unbearable but you got to understand that god is trying to escalate it he's trying to bring that gold out of you hallelujah and when he brings that gold out of you guess what it has to be beaten that's the only way that you're going to reflect him is that you must have that kind god hey and now i'm going to tell you like this you gotta that the goal he's talking about is the holy ghost in you hallelujah that's why paul said let christ be formed in you you got to suffer that's why you've been suffering maybe you haven't understood why you've been suffering and why i got to go through this and why is this god is forming that perfect man in you hallelujah and and what's happening is we've got to let go and let god amen do it let him do it because this this this is your gift to him paul said present yourself as a living sacrifice here you are lord sacrifice man whatever you got to do hallelujah bring out the frankenstein bring out the murder bring the gold amen so that people can see that you and i have become one hallelujah you love the lord think about it these three wise men were following the prophecy but they did not even know where they were going and they go to rome in jerusalem excuse me and i'll say like this the daughters of jerusalem had no idea what was going on just like in our day they don't have no idea because they've mixed themselves with politics they never did see the star they never did see the star y'all understand me you know what they they saying now oh that's some some whatever they did you know that can't be real and when it comes to the cloud they can't see that it you know because god brings down seven stars and then those seven stars seven angels however you want to say it form the cloud but they can't see that but it's not for them to see that's right it's only for those elected ones to see hallelujah the most valuable item of all times as i said they were the most valuable the most costly this gold and frankincense and myrrh see in order to serve god in order to honor him you honor him with your best that's why the bible says come into the house you know when you you give a sacrifice of praise but you know what we do to show you that a lot of us are are are not where we should be because we think we can honor god by our social clubs you understand me we come to church to socialize oh to see this one and to see that one and and and you know and that's not it you know you're no longer you're no different from what they do in the in the churches with politics you're doing the same thing it's the same spirit we come here to honor god and and when the preacher preach and you find people in their seats like who did you come see you come to see god you come to honor him with the praises of your lips with the clapping of your hands but most of all with your surrendered life i know the word of god called said to see the prophecy is going to be fulfilled yes and even in genesis 49 10 it says the scepter shall not depart from judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until shiloh come and until unto him shall the gathering of his people be you understand me and when you saw those three wise men gathering from the north south east and west wherever they came from amen that was the gathering showing that one of these old days that same baby that that stood there two years old one day as the lord of lords and kings of kings is gathering all of his people why because they saw the star for their day you understand me this is why the prophet of god says listen god is storing up food yes amen this message is bethlehem amen hallelujah come on that's what it is the house of god's bread it is bethlehem in spiritual form amen and you and i must understand you cannot see jesus without this message you can't see it they had to go to bethlehem right oh lord help us lord those who can see the star of their age and walk by faith because they have not come this way before they are the bride of christ as i say astronomers didn't see him they couldn't see him but you can you have eyes to see listen we always played a part whatever god did we played a part it was gentiles that basically rule rule jerusalem and told and through their intellectual what teachers told the wise men where to go but you think it would have affected them see a lot of the people have seen this message have seen this picture have seen a lot of things but it means nothing to them because they are blinded hallelujah but those who have eyes to see they'll continue the father the star until they come to that resting place yes we look at this and understand that the tree had to be wounded that's the way they described when you're making uh frankincense and they say you have to wound the tree and when you wound the tree that's when that he shed tears now a lot of people don't think jesus cried but he did he even cried at lazarus tomb hallelujah do you not think he didn't feel the pain that he suffered he'd been going through calvary he felt the pain there's nothing wrong with crying matter of fact amen is best that god put trials on you that will break you amen because that's what it's supposed to be we're supposed to suffer is that right because jesus said if you suffer with me you shall also reign with me take up your cross and do what follow me hallelujah it's no way out of it people horrible things can happen to you and understand that everything that happens to you is for your benefit children going wayward that's your crying time that's your time that's your molding time wife husband whatever that's your molding time that's your time of breaking down that's your time of god allowing you to cry those tears so he can come back and heal it the scar will remain but he comes to heal you of those tears heal you of that hurt is that right is that right that's what the word of god says why are s why is the children of zion why are they still hurt is there no bomb in gilead there's bomb in gilead amen hallelujah right so we go on and we know by god's grace amen that we're following truth hallelujah so as i said by god's grace when it comes to uh these three nations this frankincense and this gold god's gift amen brother i said god gives fine it's place you believe that amen let me let me just read a little quote and i i'm uh no let's turn to uh acts 9 15. it's getting pretty warm here acts 9 15. you love you love the lord acts 9 15. thank you brother i hope this is a blessing to you i know by god's grace the word of god has been such a blessing to me just to see uh and i know you probably said how can this three these three gifts represent the bride and i'm gonna show you in just a minute but by the grace of god you'll see that that jesus christ he laid as a baby but all three of those things he was deity in that baby form yes he was the frankincense in that baby form he was he was the uh myrrh in that baby form he had to die for you and i that was jesus and and it represented these it was a revelation laying before that child and it was basically prophecy of what was going to happen to him in his life so you can see acts 9 15 please i'm just getting too excited i guess but the lord said unto him go thy way for he has a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the gentiles and kings and the children of israel for i will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake paul was chosen and listen you know and i know there's never been an apostle like paul since brother branham y'all know what i'm saying even paul had to give recognition to brother brown i mean even uh brother branham had to give recognition to paul right paul wrote almost all of the new testament but he had to suffer go to corinthians he'll tell you i was shipwrecked i was dead three times i was beaten i had many stripes i went hungry i went naked and paul said and all of that that let the frankincense come through and all of that i still was a sweet-smelling savior savor you know what i'm saying in other words nobody still can't put a hand on me is that right that's what paul said paul said even touching the law i was blameless so we find out that paul says listen i was a christian i was born a christian i had a reputation of a christian and nobody can say i acted outside of being a christian i was like christ and i was so much like him they wanted to worship me that's what he said he said there were those who would literally would have plucked their eyes out and giving them to me because they thought i was jesus christ himself but that comes through suffering that's not the over overnight trick that's that comes through suffering it comes through maturing hallelujah and understand paul represented the seed that was planted amen the original seed ain't nobody going to do me like that well a sheep always forfeits their rights romans 8 17. this is blessing me people there have been times i almost got a little upset when people won't speak i said i just spoke to you and won't say nothing me so i've done it to like hello you know you got to calm that devil down right because he up there trying to try to make you say something do something that's not of christ and and you've got to stop him in his tracks hallelujah romans 8 17 you love the lord the bible says if children and heirs of god and join us with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together that's what's killing the people easy living nobody wants to suffer and then the bible tells us don't you suffer as an evil dude that don't count only for righteousness sake only for god in the sake does god account count your righteousness you understand me all right let's go to philippians please i've listened to tapes today different ones why bethlehem and all kinds and it was just so much i'm steady trying to get it all and so by god's grace i'm gonna preach this again when i get the full armor but i thought i'd start this and do something with it so you can understand amen your suffering is all in the plan of god if you want to reign you got to suffer god knows what we got inside and so that gold has to be dug and then it has to be beaten and i mean beaten until the image of god is formed that deity got to be on display it can't be still down there dirty and all that kind of stuff don't serve when he comes back he's coming back for deity right amen let me move on philippians 1. philippians 1 29 for unto you it is given in behalf of christ not only to believe on him but also to what suffer for his sake having the same conflicts which he saw in me and now here to be in me so paul says i'm an example now you've heard all the conflicts and the afflictions in which i've had and this is not just for me it's for you too the fragrance of god has to come out that's right amen god has a bottle of tears he has tears that that he saves and it and it's a sweet savor to you to him knowing amen that you press through all the hardship i used to wonder lord how in the world these people of the ages have come through such a hardship and it looked like we got it so good new the truth of the matter is when you suffer from sin when you cease from sin you you know that's when god is you suffer right unbelief because one one thing for certain you know when you're truly sure of your salvation you tell everybody who you possibly can tell and in doing so you're going to come against some great devils right they're not going to believe you and instead they will persecute you but how many of us have been persecuted for the name of the lord jesus how long has it been one more thing let's move on you you are being blessed these three gifts represented the bride of christ john heirs in his suffering and even paul says i want to know him not just in the in the power of his resurrection but i also want to know him in his suffering see and we must understand when it gets too easy we're dating we're treading on a dangerous ground it's not supposed to be easy for us we're the bride of christ it's supposed to be difficult don't worry if we don't get it now we'll get it later because he tells us that the squeeze is coming right and he said when the stock market dropped he said ease of living will be over then so understand by god's grace is coming listen in the in i'm going to give you a couple of quotes and i'm going to let you go laodicean church agent says oh little flock do not fear this age is closing fast as it does those tares will be bound together as a three-fourth cord is not easily broken then we'll have a tremendous threefold strength of political physical and spiritual uh it says and then he says satanic power and they will seek to destroy the bride of christ she will suffer but she will endure amen fear not those things excuse me that are coming upon the earth for the for he who loved his own loveth them unto the end that's john 3 1 13 1 excuse me so you understand it's coming y'all we we we're looking at this little stuff that we're going through it's going to get and listen you need to know how to pray and you need to know how to to to die to yourself because that's the myrrh you got to die but god will wrap you with that mercy you'll smell good but you got to die and rot to all those things of the world ephesian church age that's why the bible said love not the world and all the things of the world and brother branham took it a little father he said if the speck of the love of the world is in you the love of god is not ephesian church asia says but not only is the candlestick of gold it is a beaten gold hand crafted of beaten gold according to her according to her according to her blueprint which were spirit given outside of the lord listen and the master jesus christ was ever a people so beaten and purged as the bride of jesus christ surely she is filling up the suffering that christ has left behind her good are destroyed her life is in jeopardy she is counted as sheep for the slaughter sound familiar she is killed all the day long that's scripture referring to jesus christ huh she suffers much but in it all retaliates not neither does she causes others to suffer worthy of the gospel is this lovely bride of christ y'all understand me she retaliates not neither does she cause others to suffer worthy there it is now honoring him and bringing yourself into a worthy state worthy of the gospel is the lovely bride of christ and as gold is malleable whereas brass will break with the beating this gold of god will bear her suffering for the lord not bowed not broken not destroyed but formed as a thing of beauty and joined forever by the trials and testing of this life see so when when knows why that star was coming together it was coming together for us shadowing the type of what god was doing and what he's doing in his last day amen is that right so we must understand by god's grace what the lord is doing god is working through our lives we understand by god's grace we've got to be wounded we've got to be bruised we've got to be beaten we've got to go through all of those things in which you know so you can understand what i'm what i'm saying even the prophet of god had to be beaten and wounded and who did the wounding god did it when the prophet disobeyed him he took his wife and baby wounded him but look what it brought forth he learned his obedience through the things in which he suffered sometimes god lets us go through these hardships these wounds amen just bringing us listen you want to be perfect that's what you asked for that's what i asked for i used to wonder lord why all my children why why why why this answered my questions because i can look back and i can see how intense my prayers were and how i cried out to god and how god healed me so much so that i don't even worry about it anymore that's the healing i trust god hallelujah i didn't understand it you know a lot of time we blame ourselves oh because i did no no no no no the the path of the righteous they are ordered by god they are if nothing happens coincidentally with god god has already staged it before you get there oh i didn't know samson was going to fall in love with delilah yes he did and he used that failure but look at look at ruth all the way in down there in moab naomi and all them they go down in there naomi and they she suffers and guess where she ends up back in where bethlehem [Laughter] the house of god bread and when she got back there that's when she prospered amen what about what about uh uh simone and and and and and derrick jericho when rahab ended up dating and marrying samoan and what happens where did they end up bethlehem see you've got to understand amen this message god has hidden it it's a spiritual place to be it's somewhere god has ordained for those who follow the star they end up in bethlehem and as long as you stay in bethlehem you're going to have a birth you're going to see christ being born in you you're going to see a maturing of christ and don't get afraid when god has to rush you down to a place that's uncommon you didn't know you had to run down to egypt hallelujah because when he comes and you come out of egypt you think oh well i'm going to a better place and then god sent you in into nazareth and the bible said can any good thing come out of nazareth right but he puts you in the midst of a mess to produce gold to produce frankincense and to produce myrrh amen that's what it's all about and when jesus came out of that place we find him in the temple teaching never went to school but he had the wisdom of god in him let me tell you something at the end of the day if you haven't gone through those stages of god dying out to god and let those virtues come through and letting that life die in you so you no matter what people just just confuse the devil when they curse when they scandalize your name when they lie on you and they do do it they do it you got to smile and enjoy jesus because what you're doing now is allowing god's fragrance to come through you they can't stand it they can't stand it when they see god come through you and they know you ought to be upset they know you ought to be mad they want you to try to curse they want you to and you and here is jesus coming through right it's like stephen being beaten being stoned hallelujah and all he said was lord hold not these things of their charge what was it it was those attributes of that frankincense and that mirror and that gold that was deity coming through that that vessel so much so they saw the glow of the gold [Laughter] he said he had a face like an angel huh y'all love the lord amen i i trust i there's like i said not many here but i trust that those of us who are all i understand your suffering is not in vain especially if you're suffering for christ and i want to say to you amen i don't care if your husband leave you or your wife leave you or your children leave you nothing is more precious than jesus christ understand that's your treasure and you're his treasure and so understand that when he's molding you he'll never leave you'll never forsake you but he wants you to trust him amen and if you can trust him and have faith in this word i'll see you at the end of the day you love the lord let's stand he is so wonderful to us and i just appreciate everything that he's done for me in my life i can truly say i better understand what he's been doing with me all these years i couldn't understand why he had me leave lima uh leave colombia to lima from lima to here and all of this has been a process of me of god and me producing fragrances bringing me to a place to die and rot so that the glory of god can come down and i know that many of you can testify to those things but let go and let god have his way i can recall the time when peter said oh and they want to crucify him says no turn me upside down i'm not worthy to be crucified like my lord when they were thrown in jail peter james and john they didn't say oh lord words mean they understood that they were worthy of the suffering they weren't worthy and they thank god for his grace for allowing them to suffer for his namesake i've had to suffer for his namesake but it's been a long time now that my eyes are opened let's see what happens tomorrow or the day after you understand what i'm saying god is real to us there are some things oh that i may not know there are some places that i cannot go but this one [Music] being my god is real so i can feel him in my soul church don't say no god is real yes god is real he's real in my soul yes god oh my god is real oh he had washed and
