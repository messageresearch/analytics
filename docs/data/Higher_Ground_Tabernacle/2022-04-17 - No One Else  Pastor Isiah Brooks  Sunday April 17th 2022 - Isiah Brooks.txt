foreign amen again 44 we're gonna read the sixth verse and then we'll go to revelations and it reads thus said the lord the king of israel and his redeemer the lord of hosts i am the first and i am the last and beside me there is no god eternal what israel is [Music] unto the angel of the laodicean right these things says the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation if i was to entitle this message my foreign [Music] i like to encourage [Music] [Music] pay attention to the word of god liberty [Applause] i'm so glad we [Music] [Music] and when jesus christ christopher he's not referring just to elijah here he's referring to elijah jesus christ she will be an invincible army [Music] [Music] no i understand in the scripture don't is it true where revelations third chapter said jesus christ is the beginning of of the creation of god reading that scripture you can so misunderstood what's being said but there is a purpose there's a reason why the scripture is true it's actually uh saying it the way it's being said and we need to know what is being said hallelujah he is the bride of jesus christ as we call her it's not a and now we're in the 8th but i want you to understand the principle in which i'm going to uh minister this morning and i've always used it maybe not saying it but i always use the alpha and the omega principle what it was in the beginning it's what he hears in the ending hallelujah and we're serving a god that changes god doesn't change because of our attitudes he doesn't change because of our indifferences he doesn't change because [Music] the prophet god began to explain but those words don't mean exactly as they sound to us just taking them the way they sound has made some people multitude of people get the idea that jesus was the first creation of god making him lord then god had lord and godhead and i know that some way some of us think that he is the creator he was the creator of a finished physical creation hallelujah let me keep reading here because i want you to understand if you if you can't see jesus christ as god and i'm not talking about in your mental capacity you've got to have a revelation in order to understand who you are hallelujah oh i'm so tired of seeing a weak holy ghost while on sentence prefabrication the holy ghost is not weak resentment is god [Applause] without [Music] [Music] [Music] this is a different designation people are still feeling sorry for ourselves see the bride of jesus christ [Music] you shall live also amen and he says i am the resurrection [Music] and that same i am [Music] and i know we do it sometime when we get tired but we get into sad mood and when you move into that sad mood you have literally moved out of heavenly places that we have we are now sitting in heavenly places christ jesus or jesus that means listen if you're truly born again god has moved you from the third dimension to that hallelujah oh glory to god so what are you saying brother bro you you got to stay in your dimension and the bible said in the presence of the lord there is fullness of joy at his right hand our pleasures forevermore listen that's the problem [Music] i'm going to meditate on your word both day and night [Music] because you need to tell the devil to get off your back you know i still love that scripture he makes all things beautiful [Music] oh god he says as he stand there revealing who he is in this last age [Music] this is a special [Music] he is the creator of that church somebody help me here listen the heavenly bridegroom created his own bridesmaids you know i don't know this excites me it's not him that will it know he that run it it's god who shows mercy this is true huh i don't have to worry is that right he said cast all your cares upon me because he cares for you hallelujah this has has to do with the church this is a special destination he is the creator of that church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride as the spirit of god he came down and created in the virgin mary the cell from which his body was born i want to repeat that he it was not enough for the holy spirit to simply give life to human orbit um supplied by mary uh that would have been sinful mankind producing a body that would not have produced the last adams [Music] mary some of us don't believe it i guess you don't heard it so many times but you know what the thing about it [Music] you know and it's not even right for us to take this message and put our own signature on it hallelujah and you know we do it one brother come with this revelation another come with that revelation and all of a sudden it's their revelation no no no no no it never was theirs it was always god hallelujah amen just so you understand where god is taking us when the early church came through i'm going to move on when the early church came through it was a pure church they didn't have rituals they didn't have holy days there was no such thing as of jesus christ amen amen [Music] that's why god's supposed to see jesus he said when i [Music] i don't care what church [Music] when [Music] it's all about the baby 120 pieces [Music] and the bible said it's set upon each and every one of them anyone talking about the room upstairs [Music] christ wasn't the second person in the trinity manifested in three offices holy spirit same god doing a different work all right hallelujah was he not father when he came to israel you know he was a father because he treated them like a father like a father he put his pickles on them like a father father but when jesus jesus [Music] let me move on you see one thing about god he always hides himself in simplicity [Music] i know that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and foreign i don't like church energy i never had that i don't like it when people just come to church and that's all we do it's all a ritual we come into we sing a few songs we hear the preaching and then we go back out the door that's not it it's far beyond that the church of the living god in the beginning in the alphabet was so much like call them christians the same signs the same wonders most of all the same life you will see that y'all understand me okay let's move on so when jesus christ comes and he says i am the alpha and the omega that's fine i'm the beginning and the ending says the lord which is which which is to come the almighty god now you got hallelujah he's doing exactly what brother branham said he he was or who he was identifying himself when god gave the prophet of god revelations [Music] [Music] he's the same and what we've got to get rid of is this system because it lessens you it lessens jesus and as long as you serve a week in your mind he's weak he will always be weak chose john and you know if you ever read the book of john john she god is a as a as a king an eagle he sees god is god you understand me of those living creatures he sees god it's god you see jesus christ as a word in the beginning of the word the word was with god in the world hallelujah you understand what i'm saying then john god uses who is the type of the bride hallelujah she sees him more than the sacrifice [Music] she sees him more than just like luke saw him as a physician looks good y'all my and then he declared unto you that there was only one that sat on the throne he knew god was one hallelujah and no matter how many symbolism or symbols he did see he knew that every one of those symbols you know one thing about like the artwork it shows up when they design stuff they put their signature in it that's no sense like calvin klein hallelujah that's what jesus did this he put his signature that that's just a popsicle when the when the work was finished in the book of revelation when the word was finished he said i am the alpha let's just do that and the omega and there is and this is where we go wrong make us think it's supposed to be less but that's not scripture it's not scripture elisha did twice the amount of miracles elizabeth of works but what you know what it is so we want to ride in on elijah's life you can't do it you got to have your own people who fell for somebody is that right anyway that's why elijah said to elisha see me go hallelujah a he was able to wear it he picked up the participant wait a minute gee you got to understand do they come home you know you got the power the same holy ghost remembered elijah [Music] [Applause] [Music] we don't let me get you straight on that this one if brother branham was here he could have he could do nothing for you you you said what do you mean brother there were people who came to brother branham and they wanted him [Applause] hallelujah see the alpha omega the alpha uh ministry was so powerful i know i can't go through all my notes so i'm gonna have to cut something short he said the alpha amin the alpha ministry coming out of catholicism but they're coming out of the law law law law that one and one you gotta understand the law was a stronghold the law hallelujah think about it like god is trying to get us to see junior we want to let me say it like this you see they were so locked into the law when paul said you don't have to circumcise anymore they want to kill him little trick you mean who do you think you are you understand me who do you think you are you gonna tell us and you worshipping a god called jesus who was born of fornication hallelujah that's what they had to deal with the sickies of the affair and paul went on and said you know jewish people even among the christians some of them and most of them couldn't handle the teaching of paul paul says well they all have left me even demons my best buddy what was it it was too much but it was only for a selective group within the ephesus [Music] hallelujah omega [Applause] hallelujah [Music] [Music] god allowed him to do a lot of little things but these little things were dropped in place for us to see and understand what god is requiring from us [Music] in one message well the man was talking about how he spoke to that uh fish and he said i turned quickly because they seen that god used me to speak life to a fish [Music] amen the bible says [Music] and now that sounds crazy but that's the same god it's a remembrance that spoke life to that dead possum doing that yeah but listen [Music] [Applause] see i got some things to read here he's alpha in the maker the beginning in the end he's the life see some of you also comment your thoughts oh you're thinking i'm saying you got power on your own no no no no no i'm [Music] am i right i got quotes for it but listen leo the seal was rejected but in rejecting laodicea there was a prophet had already planted seeds there's a new crop coming yeah [Music] according to the word of god could this prophecy being fulfilled she was so filthy come on somebody she had rejected the word [Music] marching to the tomb [Music] he said is this all my message has produced he said but all of a sudden another group let me say it he said laodicea went down meaning she rejected [Music] i organizations revelations 1 10 and 11. this is this is what our easter celebration is about so give me a few more few extra minutes he said i was in the spirit of the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet i am alpha and omega the first and the last jesus what thou see is write in the book and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia which are in asia so here he goes again he what's he considering what is the reason why you know god is not a person that he's got to repeat himself over and over then the alpha and omega is something different from first and last because he makes a distinction distinguishing something he's making you see that there's something that he's doing and he wants you to see what he is doing listen in the sixth verse and he says unto me it is done in my decision i am alpha and omega you see that the beginning and the end i would give unto him that is the thirst of the fountains of the water of life freely he didn't say i'm going to do it he said it's done right and so when we say okay alpha and omega zone declaring himself he is with the clown remember of who he is in the church amen remember the bible tells us that it was jesus christ walking through the midst of the golden candlesticks hallelujah he understand me he started at ephesus and he ended up where at least dude dude god would bring a bride into you know convocation the first day but let's go back to the first [Music] they were naked and didn't know it because they were clothed by the glory of god [Music] yes paul touched into that one time he says i want to make sure i'm clothed i don't he said i want to make sure i got a body and if you don't hear this message you have nobody to be clothed hallelujah even some of the earliest messages he talked about jesus christ being a to z and i'm going to read a quote to you in the message amen the seven church ages he said a voice of a trumpet saying unto me i am alpha animal maker now this is in 54. he said the first thing out he said he introduced here i am the first and then let's see what i'm saying he don't need voices of course he's pronouncing to you i'm eternal really first and last is time but really he's and he said uh god began to unfold to him things he's never seen before he was progressive in his revelation there were times he said just before the last church age which was pentecost it's the lukewarm see leo listen closely as jesus was seen in the cross standing in the seven golden candlesticks the darkest was that was the farthest away from him the [Music] that part [Music] to look upon as alpha and omega everything in between didn't look like him didn't act like him produce jesus like alpha and omega did the [Music] we cannot live without we're in between people you're gonna either be the omega oh you're gonna be left behind [Music] oh the first somebody help me here omega [Applause] god is changing us now i don't know some of us may not be i don't know but i'm trusting everybody's being changed i hope you're not the same person you used to be a year ago changes are i'm being made about those little foxes how many of y'all got little foxes all of us got little fountains and the bob said those little foxes for the vine it's good all right we gotta get rid of the little foxes that god knows the blood still covers your circle here the blood's still covered even those little foxes god can't even see the blood and see i'm going back to the old testament so i can re-emphasize this says the lord the king of israel and his redeemer the lord of hosts i am the first i am the last besides me there is no other one [Music] [Music] to but you know god is good nothing wrong with getting new stuff but i'm just saying you know when we when it comes to to to uh gospel god god listen let me read can i read another quote don't get tired because one time y'all thought they didn't eat enough of them don't get tired there was a time you thought they didn't read enough of them nobody even said amen y'all to be ashamed of yourself it's the truth so let me read them now okay now what he revealed at the very first church now watch as john saw him standing there seven golden candlesticks with his hands [Music] you it [Music] hallelujah and the devil is mad about it mad about it because after the property's been going all these years hallelujah the light rises in the east i don't believe in just putting things in the distance the world council of churches do not understand the concept is that the bride of jesus christ reacts better when she's under pressure and the pressure is coming and not only is there pressure coming from the anointing is that right it is yes it is hallelujah you tell my god doing something we don't even realize what are you doing yes yes lord the devil don't laugh that the devil doesn't lie laughs he's laughed at samson dude he's losing [Music] was see it's the covenant that god is amazing is you gotta wake up and smell the coffee like they say i understand where you're standing hallelujah and let me tell you something when you've been made free that means you're going to fight hallelujah you know your grounds now you know your place you we used to sing that little song in pentecost put the devil on the run the devil on the run yes lord let me hurry up here hallelujah well y'all y'all going to go out there and just eating all that kind of stuff i love you people i love you i love you that's that's the truth you don't have no idea i get bags under my eyes sometimes because of you hallelujah the light rises in the east and set in the west hallelujah it's been a dismal dark time the same power that raised up here on one hand at the east memphis [Music] this is this is [Music] we are so blessed [Music] to understand what god is doing he's he's changing now i said this the other day i think at iowa city are cd if jesus did not come then william branham ministry was in vain hallelujah now we know that that cloud over there was the coming of the lord people you better hurt your mouth [Music] and then if elijah who was john the baptist john the baptist introduced jesus and the elijah of our day jesus but you see he did not come the world expected him to come to the moon and right now he's a thief [Music] he's stealing away people right now [Music] hallelujah he talked about the preview of the ride he says but the church only came into view once each nation the church but the bride comes in twice see what was it not knowing it but looked at it and we got this with my message this morning but not knowing that not even the problem god knew what was happening [Music] through the process of these denominations in the middle in between which last which was the last days and he says i will restore see the masterpiece is brought up or is hallelujah that's the [Music] [Music] and life get in the grave right quickly he said oh my he said all others never appeared no more they went out never to come back again but the bride came back because she was alpha animated god the great sculpture has made him a masterpiece it is a piece of his own his his masterpiece yes but it is a piece of his masterpiece hallelujah like adam and eve i don't ever that's i'm saying that now but you understand she was a peace and that piece was smart and fail now he spent all this time building it up again he brought this masterpiece and was smitten in order that part was the smitten it was in order to bring back again the masterpiece again so the masterpiece and the sons of god the masterpiece and we're ready for the coming of the lord he's an old church of the living god bow your head in yourself before god thank you for giving us these things are true i know that it sounds like that success such a great thing is that that would be interesting would be so spread out over the nation it doesn't change he doesn't change his ways just be thankful church just be thankful that you you are where you are today if you're in christ hallelujah hallelujah let me just read this because there's so much coming from what is the attraction of the mountain we don't do it okay now you can say whatever you want to say but i know what he's doing in me and does it make it easy no no no no it does not but we have a vision brother said he saw that bride and she began to march up hallelujah what are you doing brother brooks i'm marching upwards [Music] hallelujah brother said it like this and what is the traction of the mountain he said on the other day standing there turn the pitcher to the right there is was jesus as he was in the seventh church the white wig on the shoulder supreme deity you understand me the god you serve the supreme [Music] what is he doing what did he come to do comes he's standing there absolutely to confirm the message of his house that's what it is you think all of the changes that god is bringing in you it's just to make you live tomorrow no shock there'll be a lot of moral clean living people that won't make a rapture and he said there shall be light in the evening what is it about god choosing of a pride hallelujah amen hallelujah let's stand up he said he is the only one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole word of god is christ what was that what was the ride white white a red horse rider a seal what name but you don't understand of company that seal was broken so you could see what the red house rider was doing so it's always been worse throughout the whole ages it's been christ standing in the midst but because of traditions because of means philosophies ideologies and and and and you know psychologies all of those g's they they blinded the people to truth let me say it like this this one is just to see there are there there there is no great one among us and i'm gonna say it again there ain't no none of us are righteous their son is useless the bible says no no no no no no there's only one righteous and that's jesus christ and what makes us righteous is because he became our sin that we might become he's righteous and whatever [Music] even brother branham said when you're in a denomination and you think that nobody else can be saved because they don't come to your denomination that makes you antichrist your denomination [Music] i get excited [Music] christ is the seals that was open what is the opening seals then revealing christ and the very seven angels which represented the seven churches are completed and we couldn't even see it is already done they did [Music] omega you think you just know this message is true because you intellectual wait [Music] you know i tell people i was like here with sarah and abraham sarah yep and they were changing right in front of israel why because it was veiled they can't see us they can see all our little faults but they can't see the blood y'all understand what i'm saying they can't see you you're probably but you're changing you know and i love this part because probably god said god didn't just change sarah back to you [Music] there was a dna construction [Music] [Music] [Music] are you about ready to bring him forth let me say it like this how on earth do you think you're gonna be married to him if you don't know him and you've no fellowship with him and and if in order to fellowship with him you got to have his word he is his word [Music] everything she needed to know about isaac [Music] and she saw him in the distance just like we see him in the field she saw him in the field who was that [Music] [Music] the seven church ages are completed [Music] to me this is a great easter egg if you want to say easter whatever you want to call it my point is this there's none like jesus no there's no one like jesus [Music] it can never be anybody like now you know those of us who know him [Music] we don't only just know him as a savior but we know him as a friend when [Music] yes sir he lets us fall you know it's all it's you didn't oh i didn't know they were going to fall but he does not intend for you to stay [Music] hurt your little singer and your mom or your dad said come on boy come home let me kiss that seem like that thing just healed you so well took away the pain [Music] i don't know i don't know who's all here [Music] there's anybody that desired prayer you've got a sickness or affliction in mine the god we preached this morning is here there be somebody who's still seeking the baptism [Music] we can pray for you and god god bless [Music] god is so good we'll take a moment or two there'll be anybody i know some of you may have heard these things i don't have my own personal revelation of the message this is why i tried to read as many quotes as possible [Music] you would know it's not brother brooks saying these things but god has already said that it's a security [Music] father god we come before you lord we thank you for your goodness and your [Music] representatives the omega church that anointing that is to bring the fullness of christ [Music] that the world may know you are the alpha and the omega by the way brother branham said i ride this trail again hallelujah knowing that that anointing would come again on this bride [Music] you know it's amazing how sometimes you know people eat preachers and people are so calm they think no he did he made room for him it was jesus himself you said well brother do you believe in the rapture i am the rapper will you be changed i will be changed i'm being in charge will there be a stepping into my theophany yes will there be a glorified body yes and i'm not going to make up something i'm just going to let it flow as it go and let god do what he wants to do listen as long as i walk like enoch walks with the message [Music] [Music] there's about 135 years yeah there's a song [Music] [Music] and the bible said he walked with god and it was found now [Music] because he was found not doesn't mean he was dead yeah what i'm saying brother bradley said like this and i'm closed he said they're going to be people wondering where those crazy people go [Music] don't even understand that during that time we will even have the ability capacity to transform and to be translated [Music] [Music]
