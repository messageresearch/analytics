Bible studies these are people I've never had a Bible study was before ever and it happened half a dozen or more times and I just asked the Lord to show me what that is and you know the word says a letter killeth but the spirit years life so those men that were saying that to me we're getting that as a delivery from the Holy Spirit they that's the only way they knew that cuz I'd never I've never come in witness to them before and they received it and God has been having some ministry to them as I just give God all the praise and honor and glory for that little side note as I was entering into the this area of the barnyard and Lord said to me we go there for dinner and wanted to know what I wanted for dinner now keep in mind what I told him was something I rarely ever ordered over prepare

little happier than what you came here and how you came in amen he loved the Lord we ministered on Wednesday a little thought the life we now live and I told you on Wednesday we were gonna finish it up I wanted to basically give this a second subject the most precious gift that God can give as we stand and turn to the Word of God we always appreciate that music whether it be guitar whether be piano it makes the service a whole lot better so we appreciate what God has given we're going to come to you from a familiar scripture acts 2 + 38 x2 and 38 as we said on Wednesday to come into the presence of God with a sad countenance was not lawful in the Old Testament and actually the King could put you to death for doing so you and I must realize that God is a sensitive God and we should know by God's grace that when we come to the house of God we shouldn't have to come to be fixed but we should be fixed before we got to get here when we think about or have that thought we think about the woman at the well who was customed - going to the well ever so often to get her bucket full or filled but geez said unto her if you drink of this water you never thirst again our sadness and our lack of joy is not God's I would just a fault because the Bible tells us that if we stay in the presence of the Lord there's fullness of joy and God tells us if we keep our mind stayed on him he will give us perfect peace you see what brother Brooks how do I stay there you stay there by way of prayer you stay there by way of forgiveness you stay there by way of staying in his presence there's no way that you can actually stay in the presence of the Shekinah glory and not live in his presence is life and so we are at a time that we are embracing what we call the end and we must realize by God's grace that this walk isn't way is the harder way and God is not going to make it easy for you but there's only one way to make it and that is you must be filled and I don't mean a half cup half empty and half full I mean full so as we read Acts two and 38 let us read then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all there are far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call Psalm 63 and three it reads because thy loving-kindness is better that than life my lips shall praise thee I was wondering how many people have that attitude tonight and can really see the loving kindness of God and it's better than life now I understand what brother Browns going to break it down for us in just a moment thus I will bless thee while I live I will lift up my hands in thy name let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for your goodness we thank you for all the trials tribulations and things that we have to go through to make this journey you are the Potter we are the clay we ask God that you continue to mold us and make us what you would have to be you will have us to be no matter what the pain is no matter what the struggle of struggles are Paul says I have not seen nor ears have heard all of the things that you have in store for us and father we know that it's all is worth it all many have gone before us and have suffered in greater ways than we have but Lord at the end of the road at the crossing of the river just one moment in that presence seemed to make the trials and everything else fade away blessed us here this morning grant us victory in your name Jesus it's your work Lord as your people speak through our lips those things that you would have to be said let us not restrain from saying the things that you want to be seeing but father may we humble ourselves let that perfect be done in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated you know when I think about the bride of Jesus Christ I guess my vision of it is so I have so different from everybody else and it's evident that all of us at some point in time fail to realize that there is an American spirit there's Babylonian spirit there is that Greek spirit all those great nations that once were those spirits still live and reign and you and I have been chosen by God to to live in such a horrible age brother Branham described it as the most evil age it is the age where Satan himself is God I'll call God now you say what do you mean because you can't be a god less there's someone there to worship you so in this age Satan is being worshipped and you and I have to be very careful that we don't worship Satan unknowingly I believe that if understood that when she broke the word she bowed down to the devil she was the first human to worship the devil and I don't think she realized it because you can't worship two gods at the same time the Bible says you can't serve Mammon and God at the same time you got to have one you've got to love and the other one you despise and you and I must realize a man that God has done a great work for us but I think we as the message people have have literally made this thing and allowed this thing to become common and with when something becomes common to you you were you you have a tendency to forget that is even there I don't know about you but you know I have a treadmill at the house and I got it offline and I got it for a good price and when I first got it I was so excited about it you know faithfully doing it all the time but now it's just a piece of furniture stuck in a corner and I walk by and I say sometimes I'm gonna get on you today I'm gonna get on you tomorrow and then when yesterday or the day before comes I you know what I'm saying and after a while it becomes out of sight out of mind you forget it's even there because it's become so common a lot of times or often times these things happen even in marriages individuals becomes common come on somebody y'all know how excited it was for those of us who who were first married and how great it was I've got a friend right now that'll be married next week and he's all excited and I'm thinking yeah brother keep going marriage is something that you have to water you have to give it some plant food every now and again and it works so both parts male and female and usually both of them are guilty but that's not what I come to talk about I came to talk about Jesus I was listening to the unrecognized and the unwanted and in the setting but the bottom is talking about Mary who went to Simon's house one thing I know about Jesus is that whenever you invite him he will come that's what the prophet of God says and that's what I believe Jesus is so on schedule if you tell God as we tell him I'm gonna be him prayer at five o'clock in the morning he's going to be there hallelujah and there have been so many times that I before I even got on my knees he was there and all I could do was weep coz he beat me there before I got there waiting on me and and and and so you don't tell me that if you invite Jesus he doesn't show up he always shows up and I heard brother Branham say this morning said even if you give him five minutes you ought to be faithful and giving him that five minutes cuz he's gonna be there for the five minutes you give him he said Jesus would take whatever you give him now when we talk about the most precious gift amen we know what that is if you had a million dollars what good will it do you if you don't have Christ is he David on Stewart being a king they had all of these I'm coming back to the woman because I want to show you something that we come in the church and we act just like the Pharisees you invited him here you expect to meet him here you know he's here because the Bible says so and we treat him like a man with dirty feet we don't annoy him we don't you know when do you see tears anymore but here was this woman Amen who recognized the importance of Jesus she didn't invite him but she came where he was invited and we find that we come in here amen and we love coming here in such a way with an attitude and we expect God to accept the sacrifice God loves sacrifice of fire I don't care how nicely it was laid out I don't care how perfectly the body parts were cut up there had to be fire and all the for that sacrifice to be consumed God had to send fire and in order for your church services to be succesfull before God you've got to bring fire this is the age of fire for the bride of Jesus Christ this is the age of fire you can't come in here cold and indifferent and expect God to bless you it ain't gonna happen God cannot change its mind about His Word and some of us will like the woman at the well you haven't met Jesus yet so you bring your bucket here Lord feel me I think you need to have a conversation with Jesus this morning because jesus said if you drink of this water you'll never thirst again see that's what happens what people backslide because amen they haven't drank of the water of I freely they haven't met Christ in the way that they should cuz the board cannot lie Caitlyn and the devil don't care I mean God you know how much even knowledge you know of this message and how you can tell what Jesus was born and you know how the calendar and the dates were changed after he died and he God don't care I mean the devil don't care if you know all of that he doesn't even care if you can revoke this Bible verbatim and know everything brother Branham said he just doesn't care the thing that the devil do care about is when a man can be broken when a man or a woman can be broken to the point a man that it pleases God because the Bible says amen it is a broken and contrite spirit that pleases God and when have we seen that last but when you really get into the presence of God brother Graham said a man if he could see Jesus one time he'll never be the same and as I said we don't understand what price it took and what price he had to pay to bring us to this point the Bible said we look at him you know and we see him in them you know and you know but you gotta understand that he did it all for you and I and we treat him with disrespect we always want somebody else amen to make me happy make me happy preacher make me happy bring some deep things but how are you gonna get the deep things and understand the deep things without the Christ in you the column I cannot proceed and understand those things which are of God I don't care how much you think you know you really don't know nothing until you get the Holy Ghost your Christianity is just potential it's a potential thing it ain't real until you get to God and God gets to you is that right Oh oh I don't know what God what I heard the probably God says even if you oh well what good will I do what good will it do me if I get the Holy Ghost he said I don't care I'm putting it in my own word but you can you can go listen to it amen I'll tell you what the message is but the point is and then you can he said it get what you can get if you get the Holy Ghost when you're all at least you know where you're going you may not be like Moses that apart the Red Sea hallelujah but you can be that little woman Amen bringing that little to mics hallelujah you see what I'm saying there's always a purpose for you but let us not be deceived millions died on the Moses how many died on even Joshua's ministry because they wouldn't get rid of the worldly things and you and I must understand by God's grace amen it's the life we live I marvel because the Bible said when they came on the day of Pentecost it meant that they was so drunk and brother branham goes on say they staggered like drunkards they jumped out of the windows they ran up the street but we have gotten so message crying that's my own phrase amen so we just sit here like Methodists you can't tell me there's not joy in him but if you have a mindset that I cannot enjoy this song Amen unless it's going a certain pace you need to be born again oh it it's gotta be something hey man where I can move you need the Holy Ghost because you're not moving by the spirit you're moving myself and whatever else it is you and I must realize by God's grace and then there is a life to live and God is looking for somebody to live it some who's not a shame I mean y'all know Hadi is the devil fights you in a restaurant you know when you got the prayed you know you look around and see if somebody's looking I've seen people do it hey man nobody wants to be loud hallelujah but their cackling like chickens in the restaurant and saying whatever they want to say but I hear people I even talk with Chris's when it comes to you know worshiping God all of a sudden they get quiet and they start talking about Jesus they don't want to be too loud that is the devil and the Bible said if you are saved of him in this adulterous generation he will be a shame of you why do you go to church Oh Mike this is what my church believe what an awful statement to me what do you believe then what is your relationship that's being the same of your husband your same of your husband or shame of your wife shame on you hello and if they don't like it you need to tell them this the way my husband like it you and I must understand Amen that listen the devil has no more power over you than what you give him being a brother was talking the other day and you know he willing to say you know it the one Amen that you feed the most where there's a black dog or the white dog I won't go on to say what I had to say but nevertheless the brothers say well I won't call him a back black dog no more I'll call him a Greenwood but you and I was realized by the grace of God it's the truth and he described the black dog because of the nature of the dog if you feed your nature of the world that's exactly what you're gonna get don't even expect to be a spiritual if you're gonna feed the carnal mind if you're gonna give the carnal mind whatever it thirst for don't expect to be spiritual because if that dog gets so big he will dominate the smaller when we talk about power understand Satan has no power as I said over you other than what you give him I really believe this that if a man is baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of his sins first of all if he's repented God is obligated to give him the Holy Ghost and brother Branham said if he's fully repented at the time that he in baptized God gives him the Holy Ghost he promised it and God's Word cannot come back boy what happens I was witness to a young man the other day and I said don't you know Satan only has power in this round he's lured over the dead if you want to put it that way hello the Bible says a woman who lives in pleasures already dead you can be a Jambi right now even if I use that term looking like you're live when you did the Bible says there was a church change that had the name that they live and they were dead another church a church age had the name that they lived and they were dead I wonder have that anointing in that spirit have not has it not coming to the message when you start preaching nobody gets excited anymore hardly any amens we don't worship with our mouth anymore we use our hands like it's going to cause so much energy to use your mouth to say Amen we don't holler get up out of the chair anymore when the Holy Spirit falls amen we let others enjoy Jesus while we sit back and observe shame on you the life you live you see yourself brother preacher how do you know these things because the way you come in here you come in here like you're dead no joy on your face you look at just preaching all we got to go through this again it has become a tradition I have it hello the love of God is fading away out of the people's heart and they don't even see it I don't mean to go this way I can't help in this I told my won't hold back but here David a man had a loving kindness there was something David knew that even just to get a little blessing from God he knows it was his kindness and not because he deserved it kindness God being gracious to me hallelujah I know my condition I know I'm a sinner I know I'm a rich I know where I stand with God and every one years for his loving kindness what was David said I'm a king I got people subject to me I can get what I want to judge by snap a finger and even with all that I have and all that I possess Lord my treasure is you the way you treat me the way you do me that's what I love about it heart because I realize I am wretched I am a worm I don't even deserve your loving-kindness now talking about loving-kindness this lady to church to receive of his loving-kindness for the Branham said she come in there and heard about about about Simon and and everything and knew something was going on and understood me the caliber of people that Simon associated with that's how some of us do we only associate with certain ones if they're part of me are part of my little group that's who we associate with we don't we don't break these boundary these little boundaries these little clicky things and you're wrong the Bible tells about one body and the Bible tells about stones that are knitted together a building who's who whom God is building and bringing us into a solid place you understand me I'm coming now we look at this thing we said ho she says look I know my condition and that's the trouble we have allowed ourselves to become self righteous and this woman knew her condition you'll never be able to worship God without seeing your condition you got to see what you are you got to understand who you are and because he meant you have not done a great sin like somebody else you got to realize I am still under the mercies and the grace of God that's the only way I'm gonna make it what has happened amen among the message we've gotten to them so many sweet candies and lollipops and everything else across the pulpit oh you justify this though you've never seen before so you go ahead and sing because you say I'm justified what a deception oh I was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world those things are true if you have the Holy Ghost hallelujah hey can I say that all right realize this morning Amen that Moses came to deliver Israel and all he got out of that was two all that millions that they had there two people inherited eternal life under the ministry of Moses the Bible said that all God in the wilderness guess what their complaint guess what this sends many of them many of them it was an adultery and fornication and things like that you know what it was murmuring and complaining and God look at that in a horrible way ah because you don't trust him how can you worship something who that you don't trust but look at this woman amen she didn't know Jesus but she heard of his reputation and all of the things that he had done already and she goes and gets her night wages and she realized hey men I've seen of her his desire he's right he's accurate he knows and when I get there how would we see this money see this was a prostitute this was a lady who was known as the ill-fame woman in the world but God had an elected she God had a chosen seed in that woman and let me tell you like this money it doesn't matter how badly you have sinned it doesn't matter there's that the grace of God will cause you to overcome everything many of us we still living in an hour pass on what we used to do and why we did this net I thought the man was dead hallelujah God so design man when he died he put bombs in him so the wives could get rid of all the evidence hallelujah that wanna eat you so that are the only thing that you have left as a skeleton and if it goes longer than that dust but he gets rid of it who who's who's if you didn't have a name on the corner somewhere near it you wouldn't know who that was I used to be that's the way God wants amended us to surrender so much to the word amen that will forget what we used to be because as long as the devil can bring you to a place in your mind to make you think that you still the same person he's going to do it and guess what you will continue to do the same sin as long as you believe you are the same person all right so when we come amen to this life what we're going to do about it are we going to live for Jesus or are we gonna be just church members I refuse to be a church member I refuse just to be a church member because God has given me something more than just being a church member let me go all to note let you see because I want to know when when God tells the devil stop he has to stop understand Satan amen is in the hands of God he's God tool and that devil can't do no more to you than God allows him to understand trials and tribulation I heard a brother saying Amen is basically the path platform for testimonies you have no test you have no testimony and you and I must realized by God's grace the Bible says that all things work together for the good of them that love the Lord I believe that you said everything you go through brother Bruce you feel like shouting no but there's a deep in the side of me that always speaks peace is that right now let me move on because I want you to understand that the devil he does have power in the sense of death but God has the keys he's still in his office but God has the keys and one day death hell and the grave would be thrown into the lake of fire but right now he holds his office though he doesn't have power in his office basically a figurehead is what he is and God is the head of all things is that the Bible the Bible said of all principalities God is the head of it I don't camp that demons from Hell God is the head and he says in that day every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that he is Lord to the glory of God even the devil's know how to worship and winnows Devils out of legions at all have you come to torment be us before our time what was they they were bowing they were bowing they were recognizing or confessing that Jesus had more authority and more power than they did have and when they saw that they had to come out of Legion they wanted to go into the swine and even the swine's has better sense than most people those swine's had rather die than to allow those Devils to live in them they literally committed suicide hello now you and I must realizing I'm coming I'm trying to get there this woman and I'm bringing it to worship because people say well I love God but how could you love God and don't bring him flowers how do you love God and don't bring him candy how do you love God and man and don't buy him some sweet perfume or something right come on brothers when we do love our wives we do things for them as loving kindness that's what David was talking about he was saying God you give me things and bring things to me out of your loving kindness I don't even deserve it and your loving kindness because I recognize it that's what it is it's better than this life you made me king over Israel but your loving-kindness is better than this life brother banner talks about how does this life how does all I'm party and I'm having a good time I'm drinking he said that's not life that is death when the devil said don't come to church that's death walk knocking on your door hallelujah because you go wherever you want to even if you can't open your eyes you drink a cup of coffee that's the true when you want to do something on the job it meant I gotta go to work I'm tired let me get some coffee it's a pallfy if you're gonna come to church and you want to come to church don't succumb amen to the lusts of the flesh once you break it once you start succumbing to the lust of the flesh it's gonna start a pattern Satan is working and the more you get succumb to the fresh what happens the more absentee you're gonna have in church it's true now I'm not saying they're not time that you exhausted I'm not talking about exhausted I'm talking about tired when you eyes often you need rest but I'm talking about tired so tired that when you get home see feeling so tired and don't come to church you wake up cuz you just did what the devil wanted you to do not go to church Oh Lord I didn't mean to go there but you see I've indicated listen if there's an apple tree of an orange tree or a pear tree that those trees are vindicated by the fruit it bears hallelujah there must be a vindication in your life more than just going to church more than just paying ties it goes deeper than that the Bible said you know you know that they are my disciples because of what the love they have one toward another and I find out that that is the cheapest thing the thing that very is the very most valuable among all Christian is the least is the thing that they have the least they have they have they don't they just don't have it how can you your brothers and sisters when you don't love God I hope this is okay cause I'm gonna preach it anyhow huh and you must understand by God's grace the most of the precious gift I don't care if you can speak with tongues Paul says you can speak with tongues of men and of angels you can understand all mysteries Hey and everybody thank the people because they so deep in the word they go in there help and you deceide I don't care how deep a man is in the word if he doesn't have a love for his brother or sister if he can't love the unlovable he ain't going nowhere hello is that the message that is the message were to say the bride is pregnant with his spirit is that right bearing children pregnant by spirit with his name bearing his name bear in his life bringing forth the signs of his life evidence with the preeminence as' I love that evidence with the preeminence is that means that when God is in you you have preeminence over your life because of him being in you hallelujah haha yeah it meant evidence of his resurrection come on Jelani healing is in resurrection when you talk about the man was dead it is the greatest healing you can ever get when you're resurrected that means you got life in you there's power that's eternal life in you people it must be so we have no option you either gonna get thirsty enough can you pray or fast or whatever is going to take you till you sealed with the Holy Ghost I said sealed with it you're not gonna stop because Amen you realize amen don't be an apple tree I am NOT how could I said I'm not a any man's benefit if I came there root that's the Bible the Bible says a man if that tree don't bring forth fruit it is hewn down cut down it is a tree it is an apple tree but it won't yield the fruits of God and God wants you to yield them you must bring forth the fruits of the Spirit in your life that's God hew you down and then he says I love you so much if you're not bringing forth as much as you should I'm going to do what prune you back hallelujah I'm gonna cut you a little bit I'm gonna put some pain in your life a minute it'll bring you to your knees because that's the problem with Americans and everybody in America you're just too proud nobody really wants to humble themselves oh I'm right you're wrong you're wrong I'm right let me tell you who's right God is and that's what God said if you have a halt against your brother you go to him well I didn't I didn't do it he was wrong he said you go to it even if you think your brother has an alt Word of God ain't God good now you remember I told you that Satan is the power of this life and when you come to the end of the road when you cross the river Satan has no more dominion no more power wheel when you get to heaven you don't have to worry about when I get to heaven I've made it and I don't I'm gonna be I gotta be watchful cuz the devil might tempt me and I might fall ah no such thing no such a thing when you get there it's over don't you stop til you get there don't think you dare until you get there I remember the time when you we went we had bus stops and he was almost to the bus stop well the bus stop one gonna stop for you now here in America you only he only stopped at the bus stop I don't care how much you weigh Stevie Stevie that beaucoup [Laughter] I had to kiss the bus and when you saw that bus coming what you said well he's gonna wait on me ah ah you knew you had to pick it up hallelujah and if you had a good friend he hold that door a little bit for you no hook stand there for here but most of the time many times when we weren't exactly where we should have been when the bus pass all we could do is wait hallelujah so what I'm trying to say it's not that I'm almost at it I must be there when the rapture takes place anything I almost I'm almost perfect you've got to be perfect you've got to be just like him and people this is your hour of grace this is your hour of mercy this is your hour of loving-kindness every trial and test you're going through is for you everybody going through stuff crazy stuff hallelujah if you don't realize the crazy stuff that you coming through is right out of the depths of hell then you blind it ain't your brother it ain't your sister it's demon power hello and understand this I don't care a man and woman cannot be delivered to God says so Oh Lord why would this man heal because he had epilepsy why wasn't he healed jesus said these kind come out by fasting and praying hello now I'm a message people we don't fast well that's why they don't come out because the Bible is right is that right the Bible is right you won't changes in your life you got to do it the Bible a oh come on if I have the faith love you got the faith you don't want to worry about it because they're measures of faith but there are some of us who have to fast and pray to get there hello God always vindicate truth in it I feel that that I feel like I've been feel they're dropping a little bit so I'm a hurry God where God we are always finding it he don't vindicate truth I don't care what it is he's gonna Ben de Kate true if you are a sinner he will vindicate truth whatever truth is he is going to vindicate it because God is truth hmm and your faith must be based upon the solid word that's eternal life a brother was saying I was witness he said well well who created God I said nobody created God he's eternal he said whatever I say see that's the point that's why he said faith faith is the one that can believe without evidence but once you believe it then God will manifest it and I told him I said I want you to understand I came to that point in my life to of God you know if God created god creator that's great but but who created God I said it's probably something that you'll never know because God was not not a creation God was self existent and how look peanut Minds cannot even understand that at all just like you and I cannot understand space how can space be you understand me but you got to understand God even occupied space space is never empty because God is there space is something created for us not God because the Bible said he feels all and in all everywhere God is that's what David said if I made my bed in hell God is there and I want you to understand there's nothing outside of God everything that's created was inside of him hallelujah you were there but you understand you know you still get you need the Holy Ghost you said what do you mean Jesus was a very well tired of God spoken word of God prophesied he was coming but he did not get the Holy Ghost until he was 30 years old he was trained he was tutored he was tested because God then said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell in at some point in time God stepped in and you and I must understand by the grace of God it meant that Jesus had so much faith in in his father if I could say like that he taught as a child in the temple as a child at 12 years old and you remember the first miracle don't raise your hand but I cuz I believe everybody got to know the first one hello water into wine noted miracle if there was any other we don't know about it but noted miracle he turned water into wine and Jesus said to his mother what you're trying to do get me to do something before my time but you see the faith of God was there my point is there was in his life nothing but God but God had to show you a man yielded that's why he was a man so that you can see what he requires of us as men God requires us to be yielded jesus said i could do nothing except my father show me hallelujah and when i see the father work i go and work - is that right then the prophet of god comes with that same anointing God would give him a vision because we didn't know what that mean when I see my father working I wouldn't work here the - we didn't understand that and then God comes along he mention to us a prophet in our day who's under the same kind of a ministry but brother Branham even had to operate according to the mission because the vision was what God showed him I remember the little baby that God wanted to heal and he went before God baby he acted before the baby before God before the vision was complete the old lady had to be sitting in the chair this one had to be here in there and everything before he could be healed God showed that everything he showed him had to be exactly now if that is true if God said you've got to be perfect you must be perfect oh I am NOT talking about a perfect in your flesh your flesh will never be perfect that's what Paul said I've got to die daily every day I've got a crucifying this flesh because if you don't crucify him daily he's gonna live I don't care how much holy goes you got if you do not crucify the devil if you don't take this flesh and put it on this objection that is why the devil is raining so much because we don't pray and kill him every day I don't know why I'm thinking like this because you didn't you didn't go to prayer you rose up with a new resurrection supposedly but you didn't have the new resurrection amen of the con you should have if you don't make sure that you left him in the tomb the devil has to be put to shame every day you love the Lord now imma quit now imma quit because it will finish up this this evening laws willing ah Bethlehem says Amen in the message in time sciency he said so Christians are known by the fruit of the Holy Spirit that's what dominates a Christian life proves what years and the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace faith long-suffering goodness gentleness patience in the Holy Spirit those fruits manifest themselves through Chris Christians and you know what we message people do well you know brother Branham says which he did that Christian life can produce these things the same kinds of effects who cares about Christian life Christian Science Christian Science so therefore that's your excuse for not doing it is that your excuse for not living it because you think these things will be done by psychology so it doesn't prove that I'm truly a Christian if I can do it well that's right but if the life of God is not in you you're not gonna produce it anyhow worried about producing it cuz only the life of God the lot is that right he said I am the branch yeah the vine if you abide in me right the line he said listen you can't do nothing without me that's what he said st. John 17 I'm almost done you saw our brothers what what about we talk about Old Testament and things of that nature and I'm telling you this message can unlock some mighty mysteries but my point is what is all these mysteries gonna do for you if you have not died if you haven't rotted if you haven't allowed God to come in your life what what all these mysteries gonna do for you I'm gonna tell you what they can do for you Paul said you can understand all mysteries and have not charity which is love which is divine love hmm well I'm gonna tell y'all something brother branham not only had love for people but he had love for animals his love projected even to animals why because God loved animals he had the attitude i'ma kill this bull me and the Holy Ghost come dropping in on him see that first thought the devil will allow you to think it he'll come and boom hit you with it but if the Holy Ghost is there it makes that thing surrender the Holy Ghost will always bring every even thought and imagination under under the Word of God the Holy Ghost will always cause you to humble yourself if you got it it will cause you to harm yourself why because the Bible said follow peace with all men hello holiness without no man should see the Lord follow peace with all men hello hey oh I'm coming to church today with an attitude and I ain't gonna speak to brother Brooks well you think that's gonna hurt it ain't hurting me because I'm an overcomer the person is hurting is you understand what I'm saying I use myself as an example but that could be an attitude toward anybody your own you're even wrong if you think somebody's going to hell if you got in your mind that somebody's going to hell saving them put in your mind that somebody's going to hell and I'm going to heaven you are wrong the Bible said if you call your brother a ray cut off who you are in danger of Hell fire yourself because not one of us have a right to say oh brother you so wicked you going to hell I'm just saying that attitude did not come from God they could have looked they could have looked at our what's-his-name East Jacob so you know he ain't no trouble child bad as he is he's a thief shyster he who watch him he sneaky but guess what he was the real one y'all know we do it we start pointing our fingers at things and people right like they said when you do that you got how many important that you how many how many closing on this thought that woman got down to Jesus feet I use the example last from Wednesday about David how he was caught in adultery and you know here here was Nathan saying well you know there's a rich man and he had all these you lambs and this that and the other and and and instead of taking his lamb he got somebody his friend whatever lamp and took it in killing I only had one and this lamb was so important to this man and you know he's like part of the family and yeah instead of David taking one of his own you lambs he took this lemon and he cumin a meaning prepared of and and and and then David said that man ought to die whoever he don't we do that don't we do that we rather just give a person a death sentence but when we sin we won't grace and mercy huh it's the truth when we sin we want great golden Lord Amber's and we've forgotten that we done condemned others I've heard people say well you see that's you know because they didn't follow me that's what happened to him you know they got sick God's judgment and then when they get sick they don't say is God's judgment anybody's God is judging everybody else right and then Nathan saying well I mean the prophet of God said to David Nathan said under David what now out the man I guess his distance has changed in it see when you win the winner something comes you you it somehow it changes and what is God is trying to do get rid of the self-righteousness get rid of this pretense of holiness holiness doesn't mind real holiness if I could say it like this doesn't mind being among the dirty because holiness can never be affected if you truly see what the Holy Ghost you can you can now marry to wash your feet you can go with the sinners and the publicans because you know that you being salty and you're there for a purpose and that is to draw them to Christ hmm but this woman was so about Jesus she pressed her way brother and said she elbowed herself through the crowd and sometimes you have to do that in this service specialist church sometimes you wonder you coming here you're happy me before you get here and then you get up in here and everybody all quiet and like you know and I'm like oh my I can feel it that's why sometimes I look like I come up in a little radical because I'm trying to bring the holy spirit the level of the spirit up in order here you hear what I'm saying and you and I must get rid of everything that's not like the odd people I'm preaching on me this world is cutting both ways I don't have one single person in my mind it's all about us if my body is sick I'm feeling the pain my thing is I'm gonna tell you something I'm gonna tell y'all something what you may not know you may know it in your mind but when you going through trials and you give God the sacrifice of praise I'm telling those walls gonna come down you don't just wallow like the pig or some something oh and y'all know what I'm saying you know you got your plate where you want to wallow ain't gonna help you nothing cuz you know why you're you displaying unbelief it's nothing wrong if you're gonna cry in faith but you're gonna cry with unbelief how you gonna please God we wallow in it we weren't waiting on God and God said I'm waiting on you till you get your act together it's the truth you see these little kids you know stomping and crying and falling out because you won't get him a piece of candy in the stove mm-hmm in my day when they went down on the floor my mom went down there with it she came she came with that up lifter will lift you right on up we don't whip them enough Peter don't grip your kids you don't whip them you're gonna have trouble down the road when they get older they gonna show what they really made out of because you didn't correct them you didn't get those demons out of them and so when they get older the demons gonna manifest themselves I know what I'm talking about I'm closing now well my point is this you know blessed are those who come to church and they know they were out hallelujah it's the truth there's a blessing in it when you make a sacrifice to the Lord God will bless you the life you now live the greatest life the greatest gift God can give you now you have opportunity where God is saying is yours whosoever will let him come it's yours right it's up to you to receive it to take it it is up to you to when you take it you know brother I'm said at least he said don't worry about no order that's what gets on my nerve if I could say like that my spirits are nerd you know I get to a place where you know of people don't get me wrong some people we made up differently and I and I'm not trying to say this you know you you have a certain cookie cutter way of doing things no but everybody has to come to the place where they get out of their comfort zone as long as you are in your comfort zone God can use you he can't work with you he had to take those Jews out of their comfort zone he did Jews are staunch II people but nowadays got more Liberty to him or something but my point is when it comes to worship you know anybody could you're not so brother I'd say they were starchy there was really starchy people and and and for the Holy Ghost to come in there and they stay in that room aha ten days I don't know how long and what they did and all they fasted and prayed and whatever they did and there were time they thought is this it is that here you let me tell you something when it comes you to have to worry about is that it pijo Peter and then when on the day of Pentecost he said well if death no he said this is that the manifestation of Joelle is now on display this is that and that's what we supposed to get that brother branham said to he's and I if this ain't that I keep this to that color peeps a well Bob that ain't that ain't time yeah and then they say that thing oh my god how people say I hadn't heard in a while you know that ain't they said what that ain't that ain't my style or that ain't my character or something they say you know I've heard sisters say that oh why you don't worship and praise the Lord you know and I seen God use them at times and they feel like you know they don't got out of all that pride keeps back in and said what would that ain't my how do you ever they say a character something and you know my thing is you already loud I hate to hear what a loud woman said well that that ain't my character you already loud you ought to get loud for garden oh brother you know what I'm saying I don't tell I tell you to let stay but I tell you this I used to get so spiritually upset when I would hear these brothers talking about oh did you see that game I mean oh did you see that no they played this and that in the other and I can't stand to hear Christian talk about all the star and that star and this thing and they doing this now how do you get time for that oh I'm a bull I ain't no bull if I had a mascot it would be an equal on dog or lamb but it ain't gonna be no bull and I don't know what else out there but my point is where do people get time I don't know but they find it and like I said now are you entertaining yourself with something that's not even glorifying God and God ain't even in the picture it's worldliness that's the way I see it I've always seen it that way I ain't trying to condemn you but I'm just saying somewhere in your life the Holy Ghost is gonna move that out of the way got it out to the world and everything of the world let us bow our heads here I don't know the issues there are many things I wanted to say there was something I I just feel I wanted to say but feel led to hold off for a moment for a space I'd like to be confidence in the things that I do but let's pray dear dear Jesus a lot was said here this morning I trusted I stayed with in the place you wanted me to stay I know I get excited sometimes in a project my voice in ways that I don't mean to do such a sucker can't help it art but father I pray that you would bless the people just this morning trying to get us to that place where we be sure we're gonna make a rapture that's what you said make a call an election sure and father there's not enough to allow it to be in Satan Eden but to allow Satan to break into our house and rob us of our joy robbers are from our peace robbers from our rejoicing it's just not right Lord I'm not saying the people are not safe I don't know who is but you know you know the ones Lord that needs to come up further in this place Lord and all I know is Lord is that I'm one of them I'm one of your elect I'm one of your chosen you speak to me you talk to me every day throughout the day even when I'm wrong you still you still there what loving-kindness this David talks about is so deep to me because it's true hiya I love you Lord I believe the people here love you but we have allowed Satan to distract us we have become complacent Lord we we just common Church has become traditional and father you said when it comes to that it becomes a stench in your nostril it is a very thing that Israel did Lord services had no feeling to it had no meaning to it many people dread to come to church but they come to church because of their pride because they realized that they don't come the church people will then see how backslidden they are help us dear Jesus forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from all our righteousness we are needy people this morning and I know this message was given with the intent encouraging to strengthen your people we realize how Satan has beat us throughout the day and many of us are weary fighting but may us may we find that place of rest may we find that secret place to hide Lord we ourselves are in danger even as Paul says I must be careful lest I become a castaway oh jesus help us father how we are needy people we need your guidance we need your strength this age as surely as your prophet have said that the most evil age ever demonic powers are everywhere a precedent known as dayley Lord trying to strip us from our joy because the Word of God said he would have that space where many the love of many shall wax cold let us not be one of them Lord let us be on fire for you the life we live may be a reflection of you and everything we say or do be merciful to us now grant us your loving-kindness in Jesus Christ we
