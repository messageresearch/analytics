[11:19] message tonight and perhaps we'll be
[11:21] able to finish it on Sunday evening we
[11:24] will have Sunday evening service even
[11:26] though brother brother Jesse will have
[11:27] to leave after the morning service so
[11:30] anyway let's stand and return to the
[11:35] book of Revelation the book of
[11:37] Revelation please we're living at a
[11:42] crucial time and there's there's it's
[11:47] not no time no time absolutely no time
[11:51] to allow yourself to be distracting that
[11:55] we are at a time where
[12:00] choice must be made but you know what
[12:05] you can't make the right choice on this
[12:06] dog by his grace that's given you that
[12:09] choice
[12:11] revelations 10 and I hope I can express
[12:17] God thoughts tonight as the way he
[12:20] expressed it to me was a real blessing
[12:24] by God's grace and so we're trusting
[12:27] that you'll be blessed tonight
[12:29] revelation is 10 we're gonna read the
[12:31] ninth beginning at the ninth verse for
[12:36] me your scripture and I went into the
[12:41] angel and said unto him give me the
[12:45] little book and he said unto me take it
[12:48] and eat it up and it shall make thy
[12:53] belly bitter and it shall be in my mouth
[12:55] sweet as honey and I took the little
[12:59] book out of the Angels hand and ate it
[13:02] up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[13:05] and as soon as I had eaten it my belly
[13:09] was bitter and he said unto me thou must
[13:12] prophesy again before many people
[13:16] nations tongues and kings
[13:20] then God great you'll find out that
[13:27] neither even in the Book of Ezekiel God
[13:29] was Ezekiel was told to eat the book and
[13:33] you and I must understand him and
[13:35] there's something about eating the book
[13:37] but anyway let us pray father God we
[13:41] come before you Lord Jesus and we thank
[13:44] you for your amazing grace we thank you
[13:47] for being so good to us
[13:49] you have been better to us than we have
[13:51] been to ourselves there are no words to
[13:55] express our gratitude toward you and
[13:59] your amazing grace father God there is
[14:01] none like you none before you and none
[14:06] will be after you for you all in all we
[14:09] thank you Father for allowing us to be a
[14:12] part
[14:13] of your Redemption plan so therefore
[14:16] Lord God let your word be known tonight
[14:19] give us understanding and lighten our
[14:22] hearts and we'll be careful to give you
[14:25] the praise glory and honor in Jesus
[14:28] Christ's name we pray amen
[14:30] you may be seated I know this might
[14:35] sound really strange but I like to
[14:40] entitle this message escaping the forces
[14:45] of darkness there's a reason why the
[14:52] angel told John to eat the book and not
[14:58] just part of it but he had to eat the
[15:01] whole book remember that God is the
[15:07] Alpha and the Omega he's the beginning
[15:10] and he is the ending
[15:13] John types out the bride of Jesus Christ
[15:17] I don't really know whether we believe
[15:20] or even understand how great of a people
[15:24] the bride is the bride of Jesus Christ
[15:28] were selected and chosen by God himself
[15:35] we know and understand that before time
[15:40] began we were with him and of course by
[15:45] God's grace we came in this day to be
[15:48] manifested to prove that we were with
[15:54] him God is a spirit and they that
[15:59] worship God must worship Him in spirit
[16:02] and in truth
[16:05] you and I can't remember being with him
[16:10] but but because we are here it is
[16:12] evident we came from somewhere and that
[16:16] somewhere is God because he made all
[16:20] things and according to John not not one
[16:24] thing was made that was made without him
[16:28] when we come and we talk about eating
[16:32] the book you must understand that this
[16:36] Bible is a great book and to know it all
[16:43] in my little mine I could say I don't
[16:48] but in his mind I do because Jesus told
[16:53] his disciples you know with all things
[16:57] to eat this book it means that you must
[17:01] be identified with God from cover to
[17:05] cover from jot tittle comma whatever
[17:10] everything God is in this book
[17:13] you must be identified with it if you
[17:18] were with him this is why john had to
[17:22] eat the whole book because he's the
[17:25] bride and he's he's a type of the bride
[17:27] and the bride must come to understand
[17:29] that there is no variableness in god
[17:32] there's no changing in him the bible
[17:36] says according to Hebrews 13 and 8 he's
[17:39] the same yesterday today and forever and
[17:42] one of the things that God told Israel
[17:44] he said I'm the LORD thy God and I
[17:47] changed not so eating this book you you
[17:51] find out that you must be identified
[17:53] with God in every aspect in the places
[17:59] where it seems like God was failing
[18:02] which we know that God never fails but
[18:06] we find that God and man in every aspect
[18:10] showed his glory in his power that's
[18:13] what we were created for
[18:15] he had angels they glorified him they
[18:20] worshiped him but God wanted something
[18:23] closer something that was Lord that
[18:27] could be more intimate because the
[18:29] angels were created to worship him but
[18:32] he wanted someone of his own kind that
[18:37] could love him
[18:39] and being that he's the only being of
[18:41] love he had to break a piece or two off
[18:44] of himself as the prophet of God said we
[18:47] are rotation off of God that's the only
[18:51] way you and I can love God he would love
[18:54] this fallen love is not what God
[18:58] requires
[18:59] God doesn't require filial love from us
[19:03] he require agape love and the only way
[19:08] that he could do that he himself had to
[19:10] make arrangements now the Bible tells us
[19:15] that before time began before the
[19:17] foundation of the world our names were
[19:20] placed in the Lamb's Book of Life
[19:22] because in the mind of God we always
[19:25] existed because he existed
[19:28] that part of God was us and we were in
[19:33] him God is a spirit God is male and his
[19:36] female hello but God is man y'all
[19:40] understand what I'm saying
[19:41] Amen God didn't create the feminine part
[19:43] of himself it existed when he existed
[19:47] and so therefore he was mother and
[19:49] father somebody help me here chief
[19:52] that's that's what we people don't
[19:54] understand that's why God made male and
[19:57] female a man and a beast because that
[20:01] was man was the highest image of God
[20:05] male and female and in God in Adam was
[20:08] Adam which was the feminine part she
[20:12] didn't receive her her name even till
[20:14] she had fallen but let me get to where
[20:19] we're going with this when I talk about
[20:23] escaping from the forces of darkness or
[20:27] the forces of evil God has always made
[20:30] it where it's been a choice but you see
[20:35] because he's omniscient he knows all
[20:38] things if he didn't know what was gonna
[20:41] take place he would not be God because
[20:46] he knows everything but in all in order
[20:50] to displaces his attributes
[20:53] with this Creator can create creatures
[20:55] can you imagine saying you're God and
[20:57] there's nothing to worship you because
[20:59] the word God means to worship and you
[21:02] gotta find out by God's grace Amen that
[21:05] God had all of these other things but
[21:06] they were attributes in him then he was
[21:08] a father he was a mother he was
[21:10] assisting he was a brother he was a
[21:12] healer he was a deliverer all of these
[21:14] things were in him so God in His
[21:17] brilliant life had to find a way to be
[21:24] known to fellowship and you and I don't
[21:28] fully understand him because if we could
[21:31] he wouldn't be God if we could say all
[21:34] God is this and God is that then he's
[21:37] not God because God can't be placed in a
[21:40] box
[21:40] he can't be confined he's all in all
[21:43] he's above all through all English all
[21:47] one thing I love about God is that God
[21:49] is a just God God will never do anything
[21:54] that he himself wouldn't do oh he
[21:57] wouldn't require us to do anything that
[22:00] he himself wouldn't do let me go on
[22:03] we're talking about forces of evil even
[22:06] when God created Lucifer God knew what
[22:08] he was going to do it wasn't surprised
[22:11] at all I didn't know it but even God
[22:14] said Amen - Lucifer listen I have seen
[22:18] even in your heart before you said
[22:20] anything I see that you have spoken evil
[22:24] this thing in you is not a good thing
[22:27] Lucifer because you have said in your
[22:31] heart that you're going to take what
[22:34] belongs to me in that right that's just
[22:38] the way things are I was describing this
[22:41] to a brother the other day and when I
[22:43] say the other day I think it was either
[22:44] this morning or yesterday but anyway I
[22:47] was telling him I said remember the
[22:49] parables of Jesus that there was a great
[22:52] master and he owned a lot of land and he
[22:55] said servant after servant after servant
[22:58] amen and these people who were actually
[23:01] over his property would kill these
[23:03] servants would run him away
[23:06] somehow they would bring these service
[23:08] to an the end and then one day the the
[23:12] owner of all the property sent his son
[23:15] and these men who were over his property
[23:20] says hey this one is different
[23:23] he is excuse me he is the son and so
[23:28] therefore let us kill him so we can
[23:32] inherit so we can gain his inheritance
[23:34] and Jesus was talking to the Pharisees
[23:39] he was talking to the people of that day
[23:41] showing to them that he had me who were
[23:47] over his property but instead of
[23:50] receiving the son they killed him is
[23:53] that right and that's the way it is now
[23:56] he's always those preachers who would
[24:00] kill the son and the influence of the
[24:03] Sun so that they can only his
[24:06] inheritance you have these megachurches
[24:09] and if Jesus was here he would couldn't
[24:13] do that
[24:14] the Bible says foxes have hole birds
[24:17] have nests but the Son of man has no
[24:20] place to lay his head and you see all
[24:23] presidents where you're gone would be
[24:24] just bare with me in just a moment
[24:26] because I think sometimes and I know I
[24:29] know there's a particular organization
[24:31] that don't even believe that Satan
[24:34] exists how can you worship God and not
[24:38] believe that Satan exists as well
[24:41] there's always a night just like there's
[24:45] always a day and we know that even in
[24:49] the beginning God separated the night
[24:51] from the day he did that for purpose
[24:54] because he's still separating darkness
[24:57] from light that's sacredness fear here
[25:00] and that's the reason all these things
[25:03] are happening he is still hearing all of
[25:07] his evil forces are still here where did
[25:11] these evil forces come from these evil
[25:14] forces came because Lucifer ran a
[25:18] rebellion in him
[25:20] heaven excuse me and this rebellion of
[25:23] heaven hallelujah
[25:25] is that right the Bible says according
[25:27] to Jude these were angels angels means
[25:31] ministers and these ministers left their
[25:35] first estate
[25:36] they followed Lucifer's campaign and we
[25:40] know them as demons demons because they
[25:45] left their first estate God changed them
[25:49] over and whether you want to believe it
[25:53] or not all of these little roaches and
[25:56] these pests that we call them dark
[26:00] things things of the dark is a
[26:03] reflection of demonic power hello
[26:07] somebody
[26:08] it is reflection of demonic power that's
[26:11] why we see these things we immediately
[26:13] stop them out because if you go to hell
[26:19] if you could visit him you would see
[26:22] demons in the image of these things
[26:27] people don't know how gross they are but
[26:31] I'm not gonna stay on that I just want
[26:33] to throw something out this is why
[26:35] Hollywood is bringing out all of these
[26:38] evil dark things and watch it because
[26:43] every one of these things as a
[26:45] reflection of some kind of creature on
[26:48] earth that they have magnified to bring
[26:54] to a human image but if you look in the
[26:58] in these little places where where you
[27:01] find you know these demons that look
[27:03] like you know the ground where they
[27:05] color the grandfather
[27:06] whatever but anyway they are because
[27:10] they're real and what Satan is doing now
[27:14] is he's blending this dude ah ha how
[27:21] could I said the mid dimensions are now
[27:23] blending hell and earth are blending oh
[27:28] if only the people knew the kind of
[27:33] things they are
[27:33] doing when they bring forth explosions
[27:38] they have no idea what they're breaking
[27:42] into and they are now it is man's
[27:47] functional everything that we're seeing
[27:50] is man's fault
[27:52] remember the lid was taken off of hell
[27:55] in wind World War one right and what was
[28:01] it atomic explosions bombs fighting and
[28:05] everything else and it shakes that rim
[28:07] where we cannot see it cracks it breaks
[28:12] open amen oh come on somebody what you
[28:15] think World War three is going to do and
[28:19] you and I don't see that it is man that
[28:23] is destroying everything
[28:25] it's the forces of evil it's like saying
[28:28] to notice that this is his kingdom but
[28:30] he can't do everything he wants to do
[28:33] until he gets the Christian out of the
[28:35] way once he gets the Christian out of
[28:40] the way he can have full course I do not
[28:43] want to be here may God have mercy on
[28:47] our souls that when the rapture take
[28:50] place we'll go with it because once the
[28:53] bride of Jesus Christ has left this
[28:56] earth
[28:57] it'll be total darkness and total evil
[29:01] right now we are the stars of God we are
[29:05] the very light of God and therefore
[29:08] without us
[29:08] this world would move right into chaos
[29:11] oh people of God don't you see that even
[29:15] in our political RAM how all of this
[29:18] thing is shaping up to do what bring a
[29:21] persecution on the bride of Jesus Christ
[29:23] it's becoming religious maybe y'all
[29:26] hadn't read the latest news but there's
[29:28] laws that are being put into place that
[29:32] is just wonderful because it's going to
[29:36] bring the squeeze it's going to bring a
[29:39] real desperation on the bride of Jesus
[29:42] Christ and it's what we need hallelujah
[29:47] let me finish with this that's why the
[29:49] scum and the ridiculous things that
[29:51] that's goals on the bread bloodshed the
[29:54] war the politics the sin the adultery
[29:57] all kinds of filter missus going goes on
[29:59] is because Satan is the ruler of this
[30:03] earth and this atmosphere is everywhere
[30:10] Satan is everywhere but the greatest
[30:14] thing that has ever happened to us is
[30:17] when God put light in your vessel
[30:20] hallelujah remember it was at midnight
[30:25] when the foolish and the wise virgins
[30:28] were called wasn't daytime it was in the
[30:33] night and that darkness amen is now
[30:38] growing how could I say it it's moving
[30:43] into such a place where the whole
[30:45] purpose is is to put the light but
[30:50] darkness has never been able to put the
[30:53] light out and do you think that God will
[30:57] allow his creation to conquer you
[31:01] absolutely not Satan will never be the
[31:04] way he could never be the winner but
[31:07] both the heavens and the earth now is
[31:11] contaminated with devils that can accuse
[31:15] us before God Jesus is there to
[31:18] intercede for us eat and why the
[31:20] accusers keep pointing a finger they did
[31:23] this they did this they did this the
[31:27] blood still covers he came to redeem
[31:31] that elect that he foresaw that's why it
[31:36] is so filthy today that's future home so
[31:40] you got to understand by God's grace
[31:43] amen that we are now in a warfare hello
[31:48] but you see the wall that we're fighting
[31:51] has already been won that's why you have
[31:56] to eat the whole book
[31:58] it is the whole book that shows you the
[32:01] victory has already been accomplished
[32:03] oh come on somebody a man that's coming
[32:07] a new world like you heard me say when
[32:11] God told the first Adam amen be fruitful
[32:14] and multiply replenish the earth
[32:16] he failed God he failed because the
[32:22] image of God never would never replenish
[32:24] the earth watch it because when God
[32:28] destroyed the earth in those days it was
[32:31] a world of serpents it was not God's
[32:37] seed that perished the only thing that
[32:40] was left
[32:41] you see God got Enoch out the way and
[32:43] the only thing that was left was what
[32:45] eight souls in it
[32:47] something even eight souls were saved
[32:56] hey come on somebody you got to
[32:59] understand it looked like the evil was
[33:01] conquering the good right because that's
[33:05] what devil's the devil his
[33:08] accomplishment was he said he said he
[33:10] said unto God I am going to rule this
[33:13] earth at one day I'm gonna be God and
[33:17] I'm gonna I'm going to beat over the
[33:19] stars of God he said I'm gonna do it and
[33:23] look we're now sitting in what we call
[33:27] Satan's either we wouldn't known it that
[33:31] God said God not sure there's a problem
[33:33] we didn't understand Amen that Satan was
[33:37] truly the ruler of this world
[33:39] he told Jesus that said if you bow down
[33:43] to me I'll give you everything
[33:46] hallelujah but Jesus knew that in this
[33:49] conflict he was gonna win he knew that
[33:53] one day everything was gonna be here he
[33:57] knew that one day darkness and evil and
[34:00] everything that comes with it will be
[34:02] done away with hallelujah
[34:05] is that Alright remember with God
[34:11] in Genesis 1 God for God he created the
[34:17] heavens and the earth and then the
[34:19] second verse says and the earth was
[34:21] without form and void and darkness was
[34:24] upon the face of the deep and the Spirit
[34:27] of God moved upon the face of the water
[34:29] see I love that because even though
[34:31] Satan whatever he did cause this world
[34:34] ain't there to be in a place of void
[34:37] darkness is that what's happening now
[34:39] because of his influence this world is
[34:43] void it's dark nobody knows what to
[34:47] identify themselves with a man except
[34:51] the bride of Jesus Christ but you must
[34:54] understand this darkness before the
[34:56] daybreak gets darker young it gets
[35:02] darkest before dawn why is it the
[35:05] darkness is riding against the light
[35:07] hallelujah but there is no darkness ever
[35:10] that can defeat the S you in or the som
[35:15] no matter how hail hell conjugate and
[35:20] how they gathered together to defeat us
[35:22] they cannot defeat us because within us
[35:26] is God hallelujah so you gotta
[35:31] understand God is right now separating
[35:34] the darkness from the light a man just
[35:37] like in the Genesis he separated the
[35:39] drive Allah Garland's from the water and
[35:41] the night from the day God is now he's
[35:44] alpha and he's Omega he's the beginning
[35:48] and he's the ending and right now God
[35:51] Amen just like when the earth was born
[35:55] God separated everything then he made
[36:01] Adam right he was first a spiritual man
[36:09] dust of the earth right but before he
[36:13] formed Adam out of the dust of the earth
[36:15] Adam existed Adam was a spiritual man
[36:19] Adam was in his theophany hallelujah
[36:23] and then God brought in
[36:25] amen that's what I try to tell people
[36:27] you know Adam was a tree so when God
[36:34] formed him out of the dust of the earth
[36:36] Adam stood up cuz Adam had not fallen
[36:41] Adam stood up cuz God built up from the
[36:44] earth all the way up formed him like
[36:48] that
[36:49] hallelujah loosed him from the Trump
[36:52] which we call toes hallelujah and Adam
[36:56] began to walk and talk when God breathed
[36:58] in him he became a living soul is that
[37:01] right and he was made out of the image
[37:03] of God but Adam had a head of a
[37:08] commandment Adam was to do I be fruitful
[37:12] and multiply and his children were to be
[37:14] born
[37:15] I brought forth into the earth by the
[37:17] spoken word hello now you got to
[37:21] understand this we were not to come
[37:24] forth like babies he was to speak Adam
[37:29] wasn't wasn't formed like a baby he was
[37:33] a man he came as a man and therefore
[37:37] when Adam said it is something we became
[37:41] animals and therefore we had to be born
[37:45] like animals
[37:46] and God said from this moment on woman
[37:49] you'll because you'll be smitten right
[37:51] in your womb you'll have this thing to
[37:54] remind you of what you did and sorrow
[37:59] you good you you're going to bring forth
[38:02] children you're going to bring for
[38:04] babies children like like animals but
[38:08] that wasn't the perfect way you said
[38:10] brothers you don't know what you're
[38:11] talking about yes I do
[38:13] and according to this message God is
[38:16] gonna replenish this us and he will not
[38:19] replenish this earth with babies that's
[38:23] why when we leave this earth we when we
[38:26] when we leave
[38:27] this Tabernacle poster if this earthly
[38:30] Tabernacle be dissolved he said I have a
[38:32] building I have one I have one who God
[38:36] made hallelujah and when we die we don't
[38:41] go to heaven like babies but we go to
[38:44] heaven like matured men and women
[38:46] already fallen is shaping to that our
[38:49] daughter you're not going to grow no
[38:50] more after that you are who you are and
[38:55] Satan tried to stop the Word of God but
[38:59] the Bible says God speaks arise it'll
[39:02] never come back boy God always had a
[39:05] place of safety
[39:06] God always had a place to hide his
[39:09] people hallelujah hey that's what the
[39:13] Word of God says he'll hide me Oh God
[39:16] hide me in the cleft of the rock and to
[39:19] the storm of life has passed
[39:22] hide me hallelujah kaboom the forces of
[39:29] evil continued here come no no produce
[39:34] he was supposed to be a righteous man
[39:35] but you see he was the only one left of
[39:38] his seed and then here come his boys and
[39:41] they crossbreed they greet with that dog
[39:44] as the daughters who have been caught
[39:46] y'all know then here come what they're
[39:50] spoiling again what you see was in what
[39:54] we call this body of death your body
[39:58] your natural body is a body of death is
[40:03] that right Paul says who's gonna deliver
[40:05] me from this body of death
[40:08] hello I don't care how you love it cutie
[40:12] little baby but that baby as soon as
[40:15] it's born is dying right and you and I
[40:19] must understand Amen as soon as we're
[40:21] born we're in the body of death and we
[40:23] are dying okay how much Holy Ghost you
[40:28] got you're still in the body of death
[40:31] because sin brought it hallelujah and
[40:35] this body could never reproduce because
[40:38] was me
[40:39] was serpent Oh somebody help me here
[40:42] right it's like Michelangelo right
[40:47] Michelangelo amen what he did he evoked
[40:51] roses and you can get a replica you can
[40:57] get a cheap representation of it but
[41:00] it's not the same
[41:01] see that's what sin did it gave us a
[41:04] cheap reference image of the man it was
[41:10] just a replica but it wasn't from the
[41:13] original hallelujah and God is looking
[41:16] for the original that's why God couldn't
[41:20] give you a self received from his own he
[41:22] had to give you the original seen his
[41:25] own seed somebody help me here so you
[41:29] got to understand that's why I you see
[41:32] Christians and a lot of them are just
[41:33] churchgoers Church Jonas cigarette
[41:38] smokers and drinkers him all of these
[41:40] things because they're not in the very
[41:43] image of Christ the only way you can
[41:47] become into the very image of Christ you
[41:50] must be born again
[41:52] somebody helped me here you see and what
[41:55] we must understand it's not by power
[41:58] it's not by Mike but it's by his spirit
[42:02] that's what Adam lost they lost the
[42:06] spirit they lost what we call the
[42:09] theophany
[42:10] they lost amen that glory that covers
[42:14] them hallelujah they lost their garment
[42:17] which was God himself
[42:20] hallelujah and it has taken how many
[42:23] thousands of years for God to clothe his
[42:26] people over again but the only way he
[42:29] could close them he had to bring someone
[42:32] who can pay the price that Adam couldn't
[42:36] pay hallelujah he had to bring somebody
[42:39] that would pay the price that you
[42:41] couldn't pay and that price that he
[42:43] brought that man that he brought was
[42:45] Christ
[42:46] somebody help me here this is why amen
[42:50] Jesus could not be part of Mary and he
[42:54] couldn't be a part of Joseph he had to
[42:58] be virgin born and Mary had to be just
[43:02] an incubator the very blood shell came
[43:06] from God that right
[43:08] the very air came from God everything
[43:12] about Jesus was pure it happened about
[43:23] sex his blood would have been
[43:25] contaminated and it would have been done
[43:27] us no good oh what a mighty lamb we
[43:33] serve right and throughout all of the
[43:39] ages remember the whole book eat the
[43:41] whole book
[43:42] everything you must be identified with
[43:44] everything in the back when God showed
[43:51] me Abel I'm father hallelujah
[43:56] Abel had the revelation somebody help me
[44:01] here see because when you get the true
[44:04] revelation that it is the blood of Jesus
[44:07] Christ
[44:08] whoa with the mercy of grace of God that
[44:11] saves you you got it oh yeah but Cain
[44:17] always thought he had he could work
[44:18] himself to heaven you can't work
[44:20] yourself to heaven Genesis 15 12 there's
[44:24] a man by the name of Abram God showed
[44:26] him I called you and my grace and mercy
[44:31] for you is unconditional in order for
[44:34] you to escape this darkness it must be
[44:37] the grace and mercy of God that God has
[44:38] given to you that it's unconditional
[44:41] hello you can't do it you can work it
[44:44] all you want to hallelujah it meant but
[44:48] your work and your righteousness is like
[44:51] filthy rags to God the only way of
[44:54] escape is through Jesus Christ that ride
[44:59] Oh Sun behind look at he toto the Bible
[45:02] a corner of Genesis 15 and when the Sun
[45:05] was going down a deep sleep fell upon
[45:07] Abram and lo a horror of great darkness
[45:11] fell upon him and he said it even know
[45:13] of a surety that thy seed shall be a
[45:15] stranger in land that is not theirs and
[45:18] shall serve them and they shall flick
[45:21] them four hundred years he's talking to
[45:24] Abram and it happened just like he said
[45:28] the children of Israel was in each of us
[45:37] then and you gotta watch this because he
[45:40] says listen and also that the nation
[45:42] whom they shall serve will I judge and
[45:44] athlete shall they come out with a great
[45:47] substance did not it happen four hundred
[45:51] years because God wanted it to be so
[45:55] hallelujah and you gotta understand Amen
[45:59] they were there for forty generations Oh
[46:02] somebody help me here say all
[46:06] Brotherhood's also the nation who may
[46:11] serve right and thou shall go to thy
[46:14] fathers in peace and thou shalt be
[46:16] buried in a good old age let me go on
[46:18] and say this now but he says in the same
[46:21] day so you got to understand that God
[46:23] told him says listen you gonna be placed
[46:25] in the bondage Egypt is a dark place but
[46:28] in order for you to resurrect you got to
[46:31] die
[46:32] hallelujah you've gotta die in order for
[46:36] you to come up you gotta die and we find
[46:39] out something has to die right so you
[46:42] got to understand that is why God told
[46:45] Moses at the end of the day I want you
[46:47] to take a lamb Meiko show everybody
[46:50] gotta win cuz something has to die in
[46:53] order for them to live now you don't
[46:55] practice and you don't earn a lot of
[46:56] these things but now we get ready to
[46:58] have the real communion holy noon and so
[47:02] we find out the blood has be put on the
[47:04] doorposts and the lintel right make a
[47:07] cross hallelujah
[47:13] by the blood hallelujah not because
[47:17] they've been good not even because
[47:19] they've been better than the Egyptians
[47:20] because remember when they went out into
[47:23] the wilderness
[47:23] the real Israel showed up oh I wish I
[47:27] was back in Egypt all the melons and the
[47:29] leeks in all of us they went back why
[47:32] because it is them they were not
[47:34] sanctified they come that's right by
[47:41] what the blood of a lamb oh we call it
[47:45] the pass over glory to God hallelujah
[47:47] what was that it was like defeating
[47:53] darkness that right remember I'm just
[47:57] gonna jump because I got the scripture
[47:59] it tells us in Exodus that the light I
[48:02] think was a ninth plague that fell upon
[48:05] Egypt was darkness and that darkness was
[48:09] so great you could feel it
[48:12] hallelujah and that's exactly what's
[48:16] happening now in this what we call
[48:18] spiritual Egypt you can feel the
[48:20] darkness it's everywhere you can feel it
[48:28] hallelujah oh come on somebody but it is
[48:32] now the reason that's why we must
[48:34] understand there is a third Exodus
[48:37] that's another XK coming and it can the
[48:42] only way that it can you can make this
[48:44] escape you must be covered by the blood
[48:46] hallelujah but right now death has a
[48:50] grip on so many people hallelujah but
[48:54] the bride of Jesus Christ is moving on
[48:56] somebody help me here everybody that
[49:00] came out of Egypt did not make it to the
[49:03] promised land
[49:04] why because Satan or death darkness
[49:07] still had a grip hallelujah and God said
[49:10] in his word I brought them out y'all
[49:12] better learn this because those were for
[49:15] our example to know because you come out
[49:18] of denomination in our organization the
[49:20] spiritual egypt doesn't mean you
[49:21] crossing over
[49:23] you've got to get the darkness out of
[49:25] you hallelujah and you can't do it it's
[49:28] not by power not by mine but by my
[49:31] spirit saith the Lord
[49:33] it is the only way you can get it out
[49:35] you must call on the name of God
[49:38] hallelujah so what happens the darkness
[49:42] is so great and everything else is so
[49:44] great but at the same time there was
[49:46] light and go show yes even though Israel
[49:51] I mean Egypt had such a darkness that
[49:54] you could feel there was still light and
[49:56] Goshen he meant God where was Goshen
[49:59] closer was where the people of God live
[50:04] hallelujah amen I remember the time when
[50:07] I was in Lima Ohio a tornado maybe I
[50:14] storm that's what it was and everybody
[50:17] basement was flooding and everybody
[50:19] likes was out and every time mine would
[50:22] flicker I said but there's light in
[50:23] Goshen hallelujah and my life stayed on
[50:27] praise the Lord yes because God anointed
[50:31] me to say there was light in Goshen it
[50:33] wasn't me it because he anointed me to
[50:36] say there is light in Goshen why I
[50:38] identified myself with the Word of God
[50:42] when you identify yourself with the Word
[50:45] of God you can't help but to come out as
[50:47] a victory is that right
[50:49] that's why Paul said we're loving
[50:52] conquerors I can look in the book I can
[50:55] see that will more than cover us
[50:57] hallelujah
[50:59] come on somebody one-man army invaded
[51:04] Egypt like one man invaded the United
[51:08] States
[51:09] oh come on somebody the message still
[51:12] goes on it's still live Jesus Christ is
[51:17] the same yesterday today and forever
[51:20] this message right now whether y'all see
[51:23] it or not is conquering the world yes ah
[51:29] it's bringing the people out of darkness
[51:33] death into the light because the Word of
[51:35] God said there shall be life in the
[51:38] evening time no matter how gloomy look
[51:41] how dark it look God is defeating the
[51:45] forces of Satan right now who cares
[51:52] Oh Pharaoh thought he was something and
[51:54] that's the way God does it he makes sure
[51:57] that he gets a mighty man from hell to
[52:01] fight against he don't user nobody he
[52:07] makes it sure that he gets somebody
[52:10] who's gotten a system so tight that
[52:12] nothing on earth can defeat oh come on
[52:18] now think about it here was God he meant
[52:22] coming into Pharaoh's territory and
[52:30] loosed upon us and the people escaped
[52:37] because of the Word of God but listen
[52:43] the moment you start thinking oh I wish
[52:45] I was back oh I like this oh I like that
[52:49] you will now I didn't find yourself with
[52:53] the fall of the children of Israel
[52:56] hey somebody help me here I've got my
[53:03] mind made up
[53:04] my heart is pitched and I know Jehovah
[53:08] God the still lives we're going all the
[53:11] way with the messenger is that right
[53:13] they stayed true to the message they
[53:15] stayed true to the messenger and guess
[53:17] what they ended up in the Promised Land
[53:20] Oh somebody help me here what happens a
[53:25] man the very light of God became
[53:30] darkness to Egypt but like to the
[53:32] children in Israel
[53:33] ma the very light that same pillar fire
[53:38] that became light to us became darkness
[53:42] to the Egypt Egyptians is that right oh
[53:45] yes the pillar
[53:46] cloud by day and the pillar of fire by
[53:48] night but the pillar of fire by night
[53:51] became like to the children of God but
[53:54] you look in the scripture according to
[53:55] Exodus 14 it was darkness to Egypt
[54:00] hallelujah and when the children of
[54:03] Israel began to march through the sea
[54:05] God told Moses don't you worry about it
[54:08] why cry speak your indistinct I'm in
[54:12] this thing and guess what now the
[54:15] composer and the director is on one
[54:19] Accord and when the composer and the
[54:21] director is on one Accord hallelujah it
[54:24] can't help but to work out right is that
[54:27] right
[54:30] it's when the composer is trying to do
[54:33] something and the director is doing
[54:35] something else it's when you get a come
[54:37] ask of confusion but when yet composer
[54:46] and they reverence him because they know
[54:52] no matter how much of the music they
[54:54] know they need to know how fast and how
[54:58] slow and when to break and he's the one
[55:01] that's going to direct them in this
[55:02] whole thing hallelujah because if they
[55:06] don't look at him they could be playing
[55:08] the right music at the wrong time
[55:11] you understand and the wrong timing the
[55:14] wrong beat but when they get on the car
[55:16] and that conducted hallelujah amen and
[55:21] he can see that they're looking straight
[55:24] and then walking with him he can do
[55:26] whatever he wants to he can move in this
[55:27] way he can slow it down he can do
[55:30] whatever he needs to do and they're
[55:31] right there with him that's what it is
[55:35] you can't do nothing without God you
[55:40] need the composer on the sin that's why
[55:44] we need the Holy Ghost oh we can't do it
[55:47] without in hallelujah he was Jesus the
[55:52] very word of God and he needed the Holy
[55:55] Ghost y'all help me he
[56:00] Jarman but the Bible said when you John
[56:04] this is the one whose you see that dog
[56:06] coming down hallelujah
[56:09] in the Holy Ghost coming down in the
[56:11] form of the dog and he said this is my
[56:13] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to
[56:16] dwell in what was it he was an obedient
[56:20] son and that's what God is looking for
[56:22] us to be an obedient son
[56:26] hallelujah you trying to tell me I'm
[56:30] telling you in this book how this could
[56:37] be so boring to some people when all you
[56:40] get in is his victory over victory and
[56:42] joy of a joy and you see God's
[56:45] accomplishment yesterday and you know he
[56:47] can do it today hallelujah come on
[56:51] somebody is that right millions of
[56:54] people he baptized one time in the Red
[56:58] Sea right they come on off the show
[57:01] shouting and dancing and that shows you
[57:04] you can be justified y'all hear me and
[57:07] you can shout and dance on the
[57:09] justification there had not been
[57:11] sanctified yet because the wilderness
[57:14] was their test to be sanctified is that
[57:16] right I think it's Deuteronomy said I
[57:18] brought you out here so I can try you so
[57:21] you can see what's in your heart
[57:23] Pauline ouya that's what we're here for
[57:27] every test we go through it's for our
[57:29] own good
[57:32] hallelujah and that test is to see
[57:35] what's in your heart
[57:36] is that right my mom said when he went
[57:40] when his son died in it excuse me his
[57:43] wife died and his baby died and then his
[57:45] brother died and his daddy died and and
[57:47] the devil said see you know I went out
[57:49] preaching every time you don't told
[57:51] people that God loves and here it is he
[57:53] he don't love you he look lady left let
[57:56] all these things happen to you he said I
[57:58] stopped thinking about him like yes yes
[58:00] yes but when it came down to him telling
[58:03] you telling me that God wasn't real oh
[58:04] it's true it's too late now
[58:06] he said that that party time I realize
[58:09] hallelujah God is
[58:12] he's a meant to be praised you limitate
[58:17] without the holy ghost you'll be like a
[58:19] Peter who wasn't converted you run from
[58:22] your trials your right from no test
[58:24] hallelujah
[58:25] but once Peter was converted he said
[58:27] don't crucify me my god turn me upside
[58:31] down
[58:32] well somehow they help me hit us more
[58:35] this evening so you can understand amen
[58:37] this God I'm talking to you about amen
[58:40] he's the greatest of all things and he
[58:42] humbles himself he humbles himself and
[58:45] he comes to occupy your heart ha
[58:49] so you can be great he wants you to be
[58:53] great but he want that greatness in him
[58:59] that right David was a little shepherd
[59:03] boy how a man he had a little small job
[59:07] you know working the sheep and back in
[59:10] that day was like being a garbage man
[59:12] hallelujah
[59:13] it wasn't respected at all matter of
[59:16] fact it's daddy jesse was ashamed of him
[59:19] hallelujah amen he didn't want to hear
[59:22] Jesse to come before Samuel right Sam
[59:26] you had to say don't you have another
[59:28] son hallelujah much ago say oh you don't
[59:31] look all bright you know brawny and big
[59:33] like my other brothers other sons but
[59:36] you know brother say he look like a
[59:40] hallelujah and daddy didn't want him to
[59:43] be seen and the process I'll surely
[59:45] you've got somebody else because God
[59:47] don't make a mistake where is he
[59:49] go call him I can see David coming up in
[59:55] there a man with the face of a cherub
[59:58] don't look like no King to me but you
[1:00:01] see those are the kind God uses and any
[1:00:04] what you look like from here is what you
[1:00:06] look like from your heart
[1:00:08] God knew David's heart he was designed
[1:00:13] to be a king
[1:00:15] hallelujah that's why God chose you it

[1:20:59] God like they used to
[1:21:14] they wait and you know people coming to
[1:21:19] church and they just so ready to leave
[1:21:21] the word is God has serving all this
[1:21:23] good food I understand the Bible says in
[1:21:31] the last days there be lovers of
[1:21:32] pleasure more than lovers of God and
[1:21:34] it's true it is absolutely true Satan
[1:21:38] and death has a grip on the people and
[1:21:40] they don't have no idea where he's
[1:21:42] taking them but I could tell you where
[1:21:44] he's taking them he's taking them to
[1:21:45] hell and they don't even know it hmm
[1:21:49] people understand they better understand
[1:21:52] you don't get the one chance at this
[1:21:53] and if God is in you you better run with
[1:21:56] all your heart and do all
[1:21:59] you to get God more God more God I can't
[1:22:02] get enough I want it just like David
[1:22:04] said I want my cup running over let me
[1:22:09] explain something to in closing when a
[1:22:12] man a woman has done all they're
[1:22:15] supposed to do for God two things happen
[1:22:19] they either go off the scene and death
[1:22:22] oh god just put him in a place whether
[1:22:26] it just came because the work is done
[1:22:30] and because God has a time he has a time
[1:22:34] to move people on and he's not going to
[1:22:36] jump that time and you know y'all know
[1:22:40] what I'm saying
[1:22:43] I'm really I mean I'm sincerely saying
[1:22:47] these things and then I have some people
[1:22:49] call me from all overseas and tell me
[1:22:51] how God has blessed them through the
[1:22:53] ministry blessed them through the song
[1:22:55] and is always on time hallelujah I'm
[1:23:00] looking at the last earnest of my
[1:23:02] ministry and I believe this is it I
[1:23:04] believe that what I'm doing now is
[1:23:08] basically the last and what I'm doing
[1:23:10] and when God raised up whatever it would
[1:23:12] come through what I'm doing you know
[1:23:15] y'all understand what I'm saying
[1:23:17] I just do believe that and I I just know
[1:23:22] that whatever God is doing he's gonna do
[1:23:24] it I can't look at the way things are
[1:23:26] looking
[1:23:27] you know I didn't have a falling away
[1:23:32] like Noah Noah had millions or whatever
[1:23:35] everybody was coming to see Noah come
[1:23:37] see the site y'all know how they do they
[1:23:39] treat it like a Cedar Point
[1:23:42] come see the side of this Ark yeah you
[1:23:46] got to climb the mountain to get to it
[1:23:48] you know what I'm saying and no doubt he
[1:23:50] had more believers than eight cuz that's
[1:23:54] the way it goes
[1:23:55] Jesus had multitudes and at the day end
[1:23:58] of the day he can only get a hundred and
[1:24:00] twenty in the upper room this message
[1:24:03] had thousands maybe millions follow us
[1:24:06] now look at it now and you got to
[1:24:09] understand everybody in this message is
[1:24:12] not yet
[1:24:12] the Holy Ghost there are those who are
[1:24:14] getting the marker to me oh absolutely
[1:24:19] if you don't get the Holy Ghost you get
[1:24:20] the mark of the beast if you don't you
[1:24:22] fall into a systemic way of worship that
[1:24:26] is Satan's mark and people don't
[1:24:32] understand many of them making fall of
[1:24:35] Moses and everything else and they ended
[1:24:36] up with if you want to look at the type
[1:24:38] they ended up with a mark because when
[1:24:40] you don't receive God you receive the
[1:24:42] devil when you receive a system over God
[1:24:44] you receive the mark it's spiritual
[1:24:47] that's great father we so thank you for
[1:24:50] your grace in your mercy we thank you
[1:24:52] for being so good to us
[1:24:53] you have been better to us and we have
