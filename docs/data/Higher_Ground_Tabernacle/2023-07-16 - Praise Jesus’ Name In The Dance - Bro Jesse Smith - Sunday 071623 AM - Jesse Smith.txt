Hospitality hospitality just know we love you all by God's grace there's a lot of new faces here this morning I've never met you but God knows that's what's most important as you're the Seed of Abraham amen so we let's let's look to the word of God here and we look in the Book of Psalms and the Bible said I'm sorry the Bible says let them praise His name in the dance now the word let means to allow now so the holy spirit is saying allow my people to dance the don't say and praise the Lord amen why would he say it loud because someone must be trying to stop today [Applause] someone must be saying don't dance I think we know who that is his name was first called Lucifer we know him as Satan we know the wicked word the enemy lend me [Applause] he said that's all right he's excessive yeah as far as I'm concerned foreign [Applause] hey [Applause] hey man amen God also commands us a journey to praise His name that was in Psalm 150 verse 4. the Bible doesn't say you might want to praise him you have the option to praise God just commanded it and he said praise His name [Applause] um about God's accomplishments so God is saying brag and all he said on what I've done in your life don't you know one woman came to accused brother she said I've got one thing against you you brag on Jesus too much I hope that's the only thing wrong with me but he realized that nothing's wrong with that that's what the Bible says Praise Him in the dance right on Jesus don't deal with this is your case I hope that's all I'm guilty of this bragging on what the cross is on bragging on the blood of Jesus bragging on the resurrection bragging on the holy ghost that lives in my soul it's Christ in me it's the Keystone one that's Christ in you the hope of glory we are the brag on Jesus that's glorious amen so he says brag on my car hello and the word name means fame or Glory video amen [Applause] testify his Works testify his faithfulness no you think every service we should have people come up here and give testimonies thanks you made it through another week and all Sam was that big you overcame the wicked one this week somebody with the testimony that God provided God forgave drop out donate God protected God saved God restored yeah I still ain't God heal jackity he deserves praise amen he needs recognize we need to brag on oh he's done in our lives amen we don't want to brag on the devil we know he's a good adversary brother random said the Satan is a genius at his job but don't we remember someone smarter than sex it's not us it's Jesus Christ the king of kings [Applause] [Applause] because there are no other gods there's only one God so we brag on God's rest amen amen and that other cause us to dance don't say in the Hebrew the word is it means to twist comes out please [Applause] I want to dance in church if I don't sit down again I Just Dance for 30 minutes on Wednesday night till I was sweating all over the place but I don't want to just dance they say Daddy dance with me so I put on the Praises of Jesus [Applause] dancing with their father don't say I bet you're bad when you dance for God Heavenly Father amen trouble is [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] there's a remedy today everyone on the line bring healing the oil wine bring Hillary the Holy Ghost the satisfree and the stimulation and Jesus said in the third seal it says Satan cannot touch your praise Satan cannot touch the Sea of God but you've got to protect it as well you've got to let the anointing come on you bro you've got to confess your sins [Applause] oh thank God Hallelujah that's what we need people to praise God unless people to flirt with Delilah amen think about that how much time do you spend listening to brother Branham foreign [Applause] phones they got this thing called screen time I don't know how to do it but the Holy Ghost could go on your phone you spent uh three hours and 47 minutes or you spent eight hours on Tick Tock what was that old boss no tick tock I said that's a sin it's a championship and all to say I spent an hour on the Bible says you know don't like people I spent three hours on the service we gotta run from Delilah foreign [Applause] [Applause] Hallelujah so now you know what it means I'll get back to that at the end I'm not even looking at the clock today [Applause] a man who can rightly divide the word of Truth a man who can rightly divide the word of Truth is he said it's the most important thing of today bring up faith in Christ on Kingston God anoints ministers to rightly divide the word of truth it's the most important thing amen is for the Holy Ghost to tell the truth amen hallelujah hallelujah you understand it's a five-fold Ministry Ephesians says God uses the faithful Ministry Hallelujah [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] brother Brandon said it's the spirit that brings life my brother said if the preaching can't stir you up hello Church we've got to get to a place where we're more hungry for church anything else it's nothing else amen other than the word of God yes I wonder who needs to start up today we have to have our thoughts boiling on God's all about Jesus Christ and not boiling with anger only with selfishness I say cast that down forgive others cast your cares on God amen weapons are mighty No Zombies through God about you to the pulling down of strongholds because [Music] that word means a castle or a fortress Fortress sometimes we get complexes and it's like a fortress it's a commune Fortress for Satan we fought to rest in our minds and so we we have hatred toward our brothers [Applause] and there's bitterness and there's frustration and there's negativity yeah like negativity but the Bible says we have Mighty weapons [Applause] [Applause] no [Applause] the ghost is a mighty weapon the sentence that was a man thank you to Freedom it breaks down everyone I did tweet too it sets the characters free captive we don't have some wimpy weapons down fabulous we don't have uh you know we're not left alone [Applause] we've got divine power because I want prisons Divina to break any strong who did 12 do they fall after us how many believe that today hallelujah hallelujah the weapons of our Warfare and church is as simple it's it gives the sample as going to somebody saying I'm sorry forgive me and that's all you have to say is explain yourself [Applause] let's be a brother again of the High Calling of God the mark of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus yeah hallelujah praise God hallelujah let's live a high Christian Life um yes sir Jesus said you'll know that you'll know they're my message believersity although that's fine yeah Jesus said you know they follow me because they love everybody amen love the Bible says the love is the bond of unity love is the glue love is the glue that holds us together [Applause] that's right that's right maybe he's doing that right now Hallelujah and that will lead God's child 49 verse 4. some songs now remember in verse three he said praise me in the dance but verse 4 says it tells us because the Lord is pleasure Amen in his people also on purpose [Applause] praise God so a natural example I know an example is when I give gifts to my children for either their birthdays or Christmas gifts and as a father I love to give my kids gifts in fact I always want to spend more money that's to remind me um we got to stick to the budget and their faces will explode Hallelujah it gives me pleasures if I could give them more please how much more God Allah gifts he gave you a measure he was not doing it we miss you yes eternal life little doll I give my daughter my feet it'll wear out I'll send it to the dump years later this is but God's gifts that gift never did begin God gives the best gifts so why do you dance Church you are God's beloved alone Romans 9 25 and 26. Ohama enough verses when I preach this at my church no money please I wept people in the church [Applause] and I didn't know it they shouldn't have passed out but they struggle what does God love me uh they struggle with the question does God love me I didn't know they were struggling with that they should stop it hallelujah hallelujah but I preach this message [Applause] [Applause] good enough to me brother Brandon's absence it's good enough to be mine yeah foreign [Applause] [Applause] and this shall come to pass it jump up it was said unto them ye are not my people there shall they be called the children feasts of the Living God so before the cross the Gentiles were not God's people amen they were far from the Commandments amen they did not have the Holy oracles the Bible they were far off you were far off from God but the Bible says the blood of Jesus Christ the song The Jesus Christ has brought us close to God and now you can say with your own lips I am God's child I am God's people I am God's beloved yes that word beloved it means it's a love dearly amen amen it means to be well please Hallelujah now there's a lot of nice sisters in here but none of you are my beloved she's 600 miles away right now I'll smile shake your hands but I've got one beloved Vietnamese [Applause] for you amen amen and so we have the word of God [Applause] that tells us he loves us very much and if he loves us how much do we love each other amen praise God I want you to know you are God's beloved he loves you dearly let me read this quote from Brother Branham the basis of Fellowship he's talking about the man who wrote him there is a fountain yeah his name was William Cowper so anointed William Cowper he said did you ever hear the history of it as soon as the inspiration left him when he was there he wrote the song and when he was up in such a high key where people don't know nothing about it just to sing and shout and dance people that live on inspiration but way high up in inspiration and when they come down they battle depression [Music] brother random gave numerous examples he recognized that Jesus was the Messiah when he was in prison he came down [Applause] [Applause] because he was so hard [Applause] that's what inspiration he's under hello the thoughts and the intents but I want you to notice in that quote there's another anointed you might not be a prophet potato the inspiration might not come you like this I hope the inspiration amen he said just to sing and shout and dance that's that's in the spirit all right Spirit of Joy says who many how many need the spirit of joy you know if you've been depressed I got good news for you you don't have to remain that way Hallelujah [Applause] it will plan to cry we need to give God glory brother You're Gonna Leave Here Anointed with some Spirits if you're not a prophet don't worry about that anointing the Bible says amen amen well when is the spirit of Joy going to come you're ready to receive it dude as soon as you want to cast out anything that's bothering you could you just go out how many believe that quote yes I said how many believe that question it's a spirit sit down they speak it's the Holy Spirit Glory now the first mention of the Bible it's Exodus 15 20. so don't leave cans of event Miriam [Applause] same thing I need an Akron we need some sisters who are like Miriam they know they can't preach is but they know they're called to praise and all the sisters that's what we need today who knows how to play the tambourine start praising God people can follow me scientists hallelujah hallelujah we need a Miriam but no she's not dancing for the world anymore how many believe that thank the Lord but what I'm talking about Israel crossing the Red Sea is 1950. he said Miriam picked up a tambourine and down the bank she went dancing hallelujah hallelujah yes sir we miss you she had the victory [Applause] victory means god fought your battles Christ [Applause] and that's your sins yeah if your sins she won't be ever get buried in the sea don't let man of Jesus blood you saw this yes [Applause] [Applause] [Music] did you ever get that much victory did you ever get that much I tell you if you ever get the right answer you'll start spending some time dancing let me let me be very honest when I came in the message I was so happy but I never could dance always afraid brother Brooks was my pastor I'm sitting on the front row and I'm trying to get enough curse today because I see him dancing I see other people dead but the devil's Whispering Your dances are going to look very good oh that don't forget me come on you never had any dancing rhythms you might trip you might hit somebody and sadly I believed it yeah I never danced when I was under brother Brooks it took years for me to study the scriptures listen to Brothers but then I heard when brother Branham dances most of you know the story he was preaching on New Years on the second coming of Jesus and he took a break now could you have sat through a six hour sir [Music] walked out who's that was Alexis we'll find out today [Applause] brother man took a break from riding on the chalkboard hey the importance he was teaching the second coming he said that seat it says time for a special group of young girls I love it feet um so sisters hello sir Brothers No matter how old you are tires I'm half of her age I'm 42. this is a super dancer praise God we have no excuses praise God foreign [Applause] foreign [Applause] why not victory [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] come on somebody amen we all know we can't see Visions like brothers [Applause] that's the easy thing to do and the Bible gives you permission let them praise His name with the dance the question is did you ever have that much Victory Hallelujah that's all we need to dance you need to put some enemies under our feet I'm not going to that website amen I'm not gonna lie again Hallelujah sir I'm not gonna I'm not gonna give into uh depression anymore I'm gonna put that under my feet I'm gonna get victory so fast forward hello to December of last year uh December I started preaching on dancing and as I preached it literally Set Me Free hey I remember those all those times Lord if you have brother Brooks play this song send yourself but then I got too afraid message and I feel discouraged but God had to teach me about the freedom of the Holy Spirit God had to teach me what it means today [Applause] it means to have the Victory and God wants to know have I ever had that much victory amen so priests eight sermons on dance and we really dance praise God it sure didn't look good felt like Victory and after the first time we dance 11 year old daughter my feet Cafe on his own and my nine-year-old and seven-year-olds and said Mommy those were the greatest services [Applause] amen [Applause] amen we were made to give God praise children hear me preach three times a week after week and all those Revelations Liberty [Applause] amen and then back in April yeah God had me go to an Amish church and they've come out of the Amish community I baptized 17 of them had nothing to do with me I was just there when God did it and I preached to them the revelation of this message the Seven Seals they said so the seven churches the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they received it and I said who wants prayer only one person came up well there must be no other needs [Music] yeah I said is there another need that I can't see one of the elderly brothers and said I need Victory from the fear of man yep amen amen the biggest enemy they fought [Music] they're afraid of their former pastors he was a legalist you could only wear certain colors your horses could only be a few colors if you disagree with him on anything you're threatened to get kicked out of the church and I said who else it needs Deliverance wow amen the Holy Ghost discerns the thoughts and intentions so they come up one by one hello and we prayed for them to get Victory and after that I said now that we're free I said you might not be ready for dancing and I show them how I dance [Applause] I leave as high as I can yeah David leave with all of his mouth results and so I said now that you're free let's experience a victory I said I don't expect you to dance I'm sorry brother Brooks is but it just proves messages so I so I said for the first time you are mistakes let's clap our hands and stomp our feet how would you feel brother Brook said no clapping I don't see people Brothers don't say amen I don't failures sisters don't say amen that's how they live their whole life under the fear of man thank God you got freedom here down there so for the first time I said Saints alone you should have saw their faces did you ever have that much victory was having this area comes up Hallelujah the leader comes up afterwards he said for 58 years and I've been afraid of man I thought my life would end like this oh God would just let me keep going he said but God has given us Revenue 59 years old now I'm 59 years old and now my mind is now transformed oh my God is setting people free there's 350 000. yeah Amish [Applause] because God's children Hallelujah [Music] the second reason we need to dance it's because the word finds its place in our hearts that's why David dares said the ark returned to its position as a position did you ever think about that when was the ark previous in that position [Applause] [Applause] of the believer oh and 800 years later I play David meets Christ the spirit of melchized let's pray the message today in the ark don't laugh and says the prince of God's position oh my God what does that means what was the benefit of having the Ark Church what the Bible says [Applause] he didn't want to inquire of the Arkham he didn't want to seek God for Revelations it's just like denominations today brother you know ask a denomination can I get tattoos that's because he won't even look at the ark environment but the Bible says make no cuttings in your flesh nope [Music] see the difference we've got the art Brothers slam sisters we've got the Seven Seals got the seven churches destinations [Applause] hallelujah praise God that was the difference between David [Applause] [Applause] oh yeah amen amen amen so now you got two reasons today you're baptized amen hallelujah hallelujah the word is in its place in church there's a little nugget in there the second Samuel says verse 21. look at the end of verse 21. David tells us wife who is in the seat of the scornful who is criticizing him he said therefore will I play before the Lord the word play means to Rejoice look at the next verse so he'd already dance in the spirit with all his might look at the next verse verse 22. and I'll yet be more vile than thus it is spoken of uh of them shall I be had an honor enjoy now church this verse proves and also if I said prove that you can plan out or you can know when you're gonna dance some people say it just has to be spontaneously this verse proves David said I've already danced because I don't see it but if you didn't like that message I'll do even more damage [Applause] he said if you don't like my tapes yes sir and he tells us he said because I was not dancing for you I will play I will laugh because I'm rejoicing in God Amen that's how David is I hope that helps somebody so I planted on our church I said we're gonna have a dance service I planned it out um I took out the front row seats to give everybody room but I have the victory glory to God got you that's what the Bible says foreign [Music] [Music] but Jesus said you got to have spirits and when I was eight years old my mom was dying to cancer my mom said she had big bruises on her back and I think they they they bleach she had six kids laying in the hospital bed and it is don't repeat that the doctor said you got six months the church started praying fasting and one morning a church member a moment and the Holy Ghost said in Los Angeles go tell Ruby Smith Ruby Smith She's Not Gonna Die she's gonna live if I be evil and glorified God and glorious Psalms 118. some some 118 70 sweet verse 17. I will not die amen so my mom said America's coming hello weeks later my dad prayed he rebuked the cancer the next morning the doctors foreign [Applause] that's the victory Hallelujah she's still alive [Applause] The Works of God Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Applause] basketball thousand Generations [Applause] we've got reasons about five years ago uh foreign wow Hallelujah I said brother have you confessed I said you don't have to have that it is you don't have to have surgery that Hips Don't Do not regenerate God didn't care if I didn't know I just been preaching on speaking the words that's right amen [Music] foreign We join hands I said in the name of Jesus Christ I speak life into those ships I rebuke Satan I speak to the mountain Japan of degeneration yeah and I speak

Bear and preach talking about his new ministry it's all about the third pole speaking the words get a text from the brother he said I went to the veterans hospitals and she said it's never happened before but your hips have healed themselves hey I've got a reason Hallelujah Jesus fights our battles and then he came to our church last year and my wife and my farm could hardly bend over because her knee pain she couldn't even sit like this there's a knee page she said Jesse Jesse I gotta go to the doctor I said that's fine praise God let's go to the doctor that brother the same brother who was healed remember and he said God delivered me from the Ouija board the Ouija board and he went through all these things God had given himself my wife barely gets to listen to sermons he's always in the nursery with all my babies but that day I was holding the baby baby I forgot to listen to the service and don't you know he told that testimony when I prayed for him perfectly fine and when he said that he goes my wife got up and walked up there I'm not even a believer her mom was there wasn't even a believer and the brother prayed for her she said the next day she was able to bend down and had a slight pain in her knees um we've got the victory God is giving us the victory hallelujah amen and look how the body of Christ heals itself I pray for him he prays for my wife my wife can pray for others for each other that's the victory of the church hallelujah hallelujah I got reasons to dance the house could not be told amen God is good let me move on here the third reason to dance will rebuild your life [Applause] Jeremiah 31 I thought of Vermont Jeremiah 31 verse foreign [Music] foreign found Grace in the wilderness even Israel when I went to cause him to rush is great is your found Grace in your life Satan was condemning you yeah you're lost you're useless you've wasted so many years because God's gonna let you find some Grace foreign [Applause] church God has loved you amen with an everlasting that means the love is not going to stop continue [Applause] and what Drew you to God the cross of Jesus Christ it's the greatest expression of love you and I were and Christ died for us when we blaspheme Jesus he still died when we made love to Delilah when we ran from God he loved us first let's love him back foreign again will I build thee thou shall again be adorned with thy tablets and Shout shall go forth in the dances of them that make America amen some of the people in this church you used to dance at church we don't see our vote on the Greece but you don't anymore what happened [Applause] don't speak what happened the reason you're not dancing is because you've been broken down you've gone through battles [Applause] and you and your your statue of a perfect man there it is you've struggled to show who's that big patience you haven't shown Brolly kindness who's that baby [Applause] or your sister your godliness is struggling not acting like God anymore [Music] but God says the Lord that's what the Bible says oh [Applause] God let you go through a seasons and discouragement in the dick wash Mark and difficult trials plenty situations you couldn't handle the situations Hallelujah so God will give you that dance I just gave you the verse we need some knockout punches in the contest the contest sermon don't don't itself 1962. um said we're fighting in a boxing match don't match the Bucks and he said Satan is punching you energy and you can say Satan God will build me up and I'll take my tambourine and I'll go forth and dance God will give me a new beginning season of Rejoice yes sir that's what's happened for me I went through awful Seasons battle critical Spirits I battled church people God [Applause] amen [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] put up Ecclesiastes uh don't don't leave this is the will of God it's God's will for you to have a season of Victory [Music] there's a time to weep Church there's a time to laugh yeah there's a time to mourn yeah the opposite of Dance so the Bible says you're either in one of those seasons are you in a season of mourn now someone might expect the Brotherhood in the morning no doubt yeah that's awesome and so we should more with him but God promised by his grace he'll bring us to a season of Dancing says on the doors that's how the world works every year there's four seasons when it's negative 10 degrees here you're frustrated [Applause] [Applause] the fourth reason people dance it's because I want to be like Jesus you say oh Jesus never danced preachers I beg your part go to Proverbs chapter eight in verse 22. the Bible says eye wisdom spirit of God was with God before the foundation who knows where I'm going with it verse 30. this is Jesus talking Jesus we keep out this is the low God's talk so the logos was before God the first thing that there was was light God said let there be life brother random tells us who that light was the logos that was the son of God that was the Holy Spirit invisible form those uniform and zebra and Jesus said then I was by him as one brought up with him and I was daily his delighted amen that word rejoice song so just like shouting religions started before the foundation started he's talking about the logos logos he said this little Halo comes I didn't see nothing yet just by the eyes of Supernatural we see a Halo standing here now that's the Son of God the logos so if those first three reasons [Applause] if Jesus was the first dancer then that gives me permission today repair [Applause] he dance back and forth amen I love you Daddy oh it's your damn bath he just played before [Applause] he says Watch Me dance Daddy go like this and then he'll throw himself on the floor take a video on me Daddy that's like Jesus Jesus just read that logos I'm the image and when you dance Hey Kung Fu don't say proves it's a pool nor the image Heavenly Father oh you need another witness okay one verse is enough okay Solomon [Applause] they can't take the contig two verse eight continu Ed in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word foreign he says I've come into my garden I've eaten and I've I I've opened my garden so before that they were in courtship they were courting before marriage and the bride would Daydream um [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] it comes out that's right this is a Gallop I'm not ready to teach a class here we was on sale in class you see Deja I said my son of David I'm gonna hear him he's gonna come off the mountains [Applause] God is rejoicing the Bible says God rejoices the Bible said God sings over here so why would he not dance over here just like the Angels were the first shouters like just like the Angels is the oldest religions [Applause] thank you Jesus from God did you did my dad taught me today my Mama Bear spirit amen but you know what stops dance moves go to Lamentations the elders have ceased from the gate the young men from their music The Worship stopped you stop you stop playing worship on your tablet you stop singing the god of the car we got to sing to God you got to worship every day you can't forget about God Jesus said seek the kingdom first why don't I have enough money are you seeking God first every day you hop on your phone or do you see God well here they stop the music stop putting God first verse Joy of our heart is cease our dances so they used to dance but then the next verse says almost fallen off our head woe to us now this ought to be encouraging because we all said and when we said it's as if we give in the we give into the LIE of the Devils we're supposed to be Kings and Priests like we set down our crowd say come see [Music] just like this verse and then we can't dance for God think about that then the song service doesn't move us anymore memories you don't raise our hands we can't even clap surely can't dance you can't clap or singer climb me foreign [Applause] [Applause] anything we love more than God is the idol and we become addicted and God is saying I'll rebuild you hey I'll forgive you put the crown back up and you'll get your music back music [Applause] obedience amen that's why I can dance up here don't say see don't cry Darkness as far as Darkness [Music] [Applause] praise God Roger my sins are gone Hallelujah Glory so now you got four reasons God's Gonna rebuild your life for a new season the word is in this position and you were already baptized sin will always stop the dance put this court up here from 1958. hello friends I mean dancing is not the evidence of the Holy Ghost don't say anything but it is the evidence of Joy message is that right and brothers in our lives he said we gotta have both dancing and agonizing how many kids he says we become interested in some emotions we become interested if we can dance [Music] if we can shout I believe in it if we can speak in tongues I believe in it I believe in every bit of it let me stop there someone says you shouldn't dance you can say brother Brandon believed it the prophet of God gave me permission the prophet of God live by example he gave me the examples and more importantly the Bible teaches us hallelujah hallelujah he said I believe in every bit of that but if we have that and don't have that agonizing is broke up Spirit God can never use it amen [Music] [Applause] but if you don't also have a burden for lost souls [Music] God will never use it last April uh this quote became fulfilled in my life I preach with brother Brooks over Napoleon the point in Ohio uh Napoleon Ohio and on the third service I preached the same message and I started dancing around the front nobody was dancing and finally my 11 year old daughter Haven come running up cool in church the Holy Ghost and all the kids it was a five-hour service today I'm selfish descent girl I Don't Preach two hours and with this quote in mind we dance for one hour but then it changed and two of my daughters started crying out
