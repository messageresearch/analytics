[20:30] song you didn't even see my nose did you
[20:34] yeah surely God is good to us glad to be
[20:39] in the house of the Lord one more time
[20:41] as we stand by God's grace as we stand
[20:44] let us turn to psalms 89
[20:47] oh my we've been having some services
[20:51] lately I trust everybody has healed amen
[20:57] I won't say I'm um how can I say it by
[21:00] His grace I'm healed because the Word of
[21:03] God amen is a two-edged sword and if you
[21:10] were not affected by the messages that
[21:12] we recently reached there's something
[21:15] wrong unless you've come to your own
[21:18] perfection but I believe that the
[21:21] messages that we talked about on the
[21:23] will has has been able to touch every
[21:26] soul every heart has made you think it
[21:30] has made you repented you know a Word of
[21:33] God is not a Word of God if you're not
[21:35] willing to repent and I think every man
[21:38] of every man or woman who ever you may
[21:40] be that's why we come to the church we
[21:44] come here to be corrected you know it's
[21:47] uh you know I I'm the I'm the kind of
[21:49] person and I know for certain that God
[21:52] gave me those messages there's no way
[21:57] that I would have preached a word like
[22:00] that and I say it like that because I
[22:02] was being sliced and diced myself but
[22:06] the motive behind the messages that have
[22:09] come you know the ones that brother Troy
[22:13] preached prior to the one that I
[22:15] preached have been motivated by divine
[22:18] love our interest amen tonight is making
[22:22] a rapture not just being a church member
[22:24] there are many church members that will
[22:27] come up after the white at the white
[22:31] throne judgment you and I want to bypass
[22:34] brother branham said that's one place we
[22:37] do not want to go matter of fact he
[22:40] talks about Hill not being so bad
[22:42] compared to the white throne judgment oh
[22:45] yeah so it is something to fear it is
[22:48] something that you really do want to XK
[22:51] amen
[22:52] as we stand and turn to psalms 89
[22:56] beginning at the 27th verse you love the
[23:01] Lord Amen surely God is faithful to us
[23:07] 89 we begin at the 27th verse also I
[23:18] will make him my firstborn higher than
[23:23] the kings of the earth speaking of Jesus
[23:26] Christ my mercy will keep him forever
[23:29] and my covenant shall stand fast with
[23:32] him his seed also will I make to endure
[23:35] forever and his throne
[23:37] as the days of heaven if his children
[23:41] forsake my law and walk not in my
[23:44] judgments if they break my statues and
[23:48] keep not my coven Commandments then will
[23:51] I visit their transgressions with the
[23:53] rod and with their iniquities with the
[23:56] stripes nevertheless by loving-kindness
[24:00] will I not utterly take from him nor
[24:03] suffer my faithfulness to fail not your
[24:07] faithfulness his faithfulness my
[24:10] covenant will I not break nor alter the
[24:13] things that is gone out of my lips once
[24:16] have I sworn by my holiness that I will
[24:19] not lie unto David his seed shall endure
[24:23] forever and its throne as the son before
[24:26] me it shall be established forever as
[24:31] the moon and as a faithful witness in
[24:33] hmmm that word says a lot that means to
[24:36] meditate on it isaiah 55:10 2:11 I love
[24:41] this scripture it just speaks to me
[24:43] every time I read it Isaiah 55
[24:48] in through 11 I think a lot of time
[24:54] being in this message we often forget
[24:57] that revelations the third chapter calls
[25:02] calls for repentance from the Laodicean
[25:05] Church age and and the Bible tells us to
[25:09] be zealous to repent that means amen
[25:12] don't hesitate with it because our time
[25:16] is short we are living in one of the
[25:20] shortest Church ages we're looking at an
[25:23] age that everybody is thinking about you
[25:26] know Ephesus but remember the bride has
[25:29] an age to herself for the Berlin City
[25:32] it's an invisible age where there is an
[25:35] invisible union of the bride and the
[25:37] bridegroom
[25:38] we have been smitten out of Laodicea and
[25:41] we are different kind of people
[25:44] so isaiah 55:10 3:11 for as the rain
[25:48] cometh down in the snow from heaven and
[25:51] return it not thither but watereth the
[25:55] earth and make it bring forth and bird
[25:58] that it may give seed to the sower and
[26:00] bread to the eater so shall my word be
[26:03] that goeth forth out of my mouth it
[26:06] shall not return unto me void but if it
[26:09] but it shall accomplish that which I
[26:12] please and then share prosper in the
[26:15] things where the two I sent it Oh
[26:17] now to me how can you not trust God let
[26:24] us pray father we thank you for your
[26:26] grace we thank you for your mercy we
[26:29] thank you for being so good to us Lord
[26:32] you have been better to us than we have
[26:34] been to ourselves as we hear your word
[26:38] give us grace to receive your word
[26:40] it's about receiving Lord we are the
[26:43] female order of this Union and it's
[26:47] about receiving your word give us grace
[26:50] to receive may the ground that the it
[26:53] fat be found on be a good ground to
[26:57] bring forth a hundredfold help us now in
[26:59] your name Jesus Christ we pray
[27:01] amen you may be seated I like to just
[27:08] kind of work with the promise is sure a
[27:12] lot of times if you tear down something
[27:16] it's important to rebuild understand by
[27:20] God's grace is like when God when you as
[27:23] a parent when you spank your child you
[27:26] don't just leave them you know with the
[27:28] wounds and the bruises you you've got to
[27:31] restore them by saying I love you and
[27:35] and you know when God comes along and he
[27:38] begins to tell us how much he loves us
[27:40] and how he cares for us then the the
[27:44] beating is not so bad but I wanted to
[27:48] say something because I and all of that
[27:52] I've studied and I want to just take my
[27:54] time tonight yet be short as possible
[27:57] the thing that I have studied I have
[28:00] thought about all of the impossibilities
[28:05] or
[28:06] that which is impossible for man to do
[28:09] and one of the things that we know that
[28:12] it's impossible for man to save himself
[28:16] the scripture tells us that our eggs are
[28:19] our righteousness is as filthy rags and
[28:22] and you know we are incapable of adding
[28:26] one stature one cubic to our statue we
[28:30] are a helpless creature for the Branham
[28:32] said it like this he said we were born
[28:34] failures to begin with here we are
[28:39] amen in this chaotic world I mean we're
[28:44] in that we see the coming of the Lord we
[28:47] see that God is looking for perfect
[28:50] people and and as we approach the light
[28:53] of God we see how bad we are we see that
[28:59] even on our greatest efforts we are so
[29:02] far away from God's holiness how are we
[29:07] going to get out of this situation if
[29:10] God doesn't do it you and I I think
[29:14] about
[29:15] the question that was asked Peter after
[29:18] the 70 departed and Jesus turned to
[29:23] Peter and said will you leave - and
[29:26] Peter response is like me
[29:29] and my response you know where am I
[29:32] going to go you the only one that has
[29:35] the words to eternal I we know I feel
[29:42] its presence we know that there is no
[29:50] other truth outside of the word of God
[29:55] every word of God is true and we know by
[30:01] revelation that God sent us a prophet
[30:06] the Prophet didn't preach his own
[30:09] thoughts and ideas we have coming Allah
[30:12] in this last day and we've seen how the
[30:14] enemy has come and he's actually tried
[30:17] to destroy remember the Book of
[30:19] Revelations a virus said all of a sudden
[30:21] stars will fall from heaven understand
[30:25] you know he's not talking about
[30:26] denominational stars they were already
[30:28] falling but there will come a wind that
[30:31] will cause the stars to fall and you
[30:33] understand every time you deal with when
[30:35] you're working with winds of doctrines
[30:37] doctrines of men that were calls great
[30:40] men who were once stars to fall and we
[30:43] are experiencing that right now among
[30:46] ourselves we have seen stars fall that
[30:50] people owe the booklet we are living in
[30:53] the book of Revelation you have seen by
[30:55] God's grace how that even in our day
[30:59] it's difficult to get people to repent a
[31:02] lot of people feel sorry but being
[31:05] sorrowful it's not repentance until you
[31:08] change from your wicked way and to the
[31:11] ways of God that's what true repentance
[31:14] is so I wanted to assure you tonight by
[31:19] the instruction of the Holy Ghost that
[31:21] if you have the faith to believe you can
[31:26] speak
[31:26] to this mountain and this mountain must
[31:30] move brother branham enlighten us
[31:35] through the knowledge of knowing that we
[31:38] are not only created in God's image but
[31:41] we are little creators now what you do
[31:44] with your ability is up to you but if
[31:48] God says we can speak you said well I
[31:51] didn't get no unction from God well
[31:53] let's go back to the scripture the Bible
[31:56] says Amen that Peter and the rest of
[31:59] them were on the ship and the storm came
[32:03] up and at that time Jesus was asleep in
[32:07] the boat and instead of using the power
[32:11] that God had given them to cast out
[32:13] Devils and to heal the sick they began
[32:20] to scream kind of like what Moses did
[32:23] they panic under the circumstances and
[32:26] the situation and went and awake Jesus
[32:29] and said careth thou not that we perish
[32:33] when Jesus awoke he stood on the ends of
[32:37] the boat and he spoke to the boat to the
[32:41] winds and a waving and said peace be
[32:43] still
[32:45] immediately the Bible said that the
[32:48] storm ceased and then he said to his
[32:52] disciples o ye of little faith
[32:56] sometimes you're not gonna feel goose
[32:58] bumps sometimes you're not gonna hear
[33:01] his voice amen
[33:03] to give you instructions amen but you
[33:06] must understand that he has already
[33:07] given you the instructions and you had
[33:10] the authority hallelujah is that right
[33:14] he told Adam to do everything Adam had
[33:18] the ability Adam had the authority and
[33:20] once you receive the authority you don't
[33:23] have to wait to use it in some cases of
[33:30] course but not in all cases I said this
[33:36] to understand understand when God makes
[33:41] a promise that promise is our surance is
[33:47] that right I promise
[33:50] is that our assurance Amen when when
[33:54] when it looked like God how can I said
[33:58] Israel was going to give another king
[34:01] outside of Solomon Bathsheba went to the
[34:04] king and said but but you promised that
[34:08] Solomon would set on your throne then
[34:10] what is this noise what is this this
[34:12] this stuff going on this plight this
[34:15] planter for another king she said
[34:20] Solomon I need you to show the people I
[34:24] mean seeing the king I want you to I
[34:26] want you I need you to show the people
[34:28] that Solomon is to be king did God do it
[34:33] see whenever you approach God according
[34:36] to his promises God has to fulfill those
[34:40] promises and he's going to feel them
[34:42] fulfill those promises
[34:44] anyway the reason why I love Psalms 89
[34:47] is because it gives space it gives me
[34:51] hope it gives me trust because here God
[34:55] makes a promise and he makes this
[34:59] promise to David and and and and and and
[35:03] and and his seed and says now if you'll
[35:08] see go wrong if something they do if
[35:11] they go bad he said I'm gonna spank him
[35:13] now every sin deserves our just reward
[35:18] I'm gonna spank him I'm gonna whip him
[35:21] but I will not turn my back on them
[35:26] basically why because if I turn my back
[35:30] on them then I fail and God will never
[35:35] fail I will not forget my covenant that
[35:40] I have made with David and his seed Oh
[35:45] some
[35:46] help me here he said my covenant I will
[35:49] not break nor alter the things that are
[35:52] going out of my mouth I've already said
[35:54] it and nothing can alter it nothing can
[35:57] turn it hallelujah our Father the
[36:04] spiritual I read where I read there in
[36:07] Isaiah 55 it tells us that and this is
[36:10] what I love because if you have you've
[36:11] ever farmed anything you know the
[36:14] dynamics of sowing and reaping and you
[36:19] know many people they the farmers they
[36:22] they take the seeds and they sow them
[36:24] and they can't tell you how many ears of
[36:26] corn that's going to come up they can't
[36:29] even tell you amen you know how it
[36:31] happens all they know is that they saw
[36:34] it out there and what the thing that we
[36:37] call nature makes it come to pass there
[36:40] is you know it's amazing because those
[36:44] little seeds have no mind of their own
[36:46] but there is a higher authority there is
[36:50] a God somewhere that a knows each seed
[36:54] that have light in it every seed that
[36:57] has light in it will come forth if there
[37:00] if the conditions are normal conditions
[37:04] and the Bible tells us here that how
[37:06] that when those seeds are returned goes
[37:09] out and in a broad and bring seed and in
[37:14] all of these things it just doesn't stop
[37:15] like for corn or wheat and then then it
[37:18] gives bread to the soul right
[37:22] in other words there's a purpose for
[37:25] God's showing seed the seed that God so
[37:29] it men will come back for a purpose
[37:32] hallelujah it is not just for bread but
[37:35] for sons and daughters of God hallelujah
[37:38] and it's to see that God concentrate on
[37:42] don't you understand that God didn't
[37:44] save you because he was a good boy a
[37:46] good girl but there was a seed he sold
[37:49] into each each and every one of us
[37:51] before the foundation of the world
[37:54] hallelujah and that those seeds will
[37:57] perform those see
[37:59] I will not come back board because every
[38:03] seed that God planted it was planted by
[38:06] the word because it is the word and I
[38:12] love that because he shows how that seed
[38:15] gotta go through seasonal changes you're
[38:18] gonna go through seasonal changes you're
[38:20] gonna have a mountaintop experience
[38:22] you're gonna have a valley experience
[38:24] hallelujah you're gonna have a summer
[38:27] winter spring and fall I don't care how
[38:29] long you feel a Christian you not exempt
[38:33] from the weather changes but in all of
[38:40] this you must understand that God is
[38:45] working it out for you
[38:49] hallelujah but because the Bible says
[38:52] that all things work together for the
[38:55] good as brother Richard I were talking
[38:57] about it doesn't mean that everything
[38:59] gonna work good it doesn't mean that
[39:02] everything is going to go smooth but
[39:05] doesn't matter how rough it goes God
[39:08] gonna keep his promise about his seed
[39:11] and his seed will always come out of
[39:14] willow that is the truth and right now
[39:20] in layers here you think God and I made
[39:25] a mistake by bringing you here and this
[39:28] most evilest I hallelujah he brought a
[39:32] profit into the profit off the scene
[39:35] before this time but he brought a bride
[39:38] he brought a whole bride hallelujah
[39:40] because he knew that no matter what
[39:43] hallelujah
[39:44] he knows that you and I are going to
[39:47] make it because we are not quitters how
[39:52] can we give up on God am I making myself
[39:57] clear
[40:00] you know if
[40:01] in this era you're seeing how wicked the
[40:06] people are I think he would go out in
[40:08] the woods and hide out think about it
[40:11] cause even in the 60s he could hardly
[40:14] take it he was ready to give up and God
[40:18] had to come on the scene and show him if
[40:20] you did this not only will your wife
[40:22] leave you but you will become a bomb a
[40:25] bomb right you can't do it you can't
[40:34] give up that's right because Amen I have
[40:37] sent you here for purpose and that
[40:40] purpose have not been fulfilled as of
[40:42] yet and the trashy stuff that was going
[40:46] on now cannot be compared to what's
[40:49] going on now that was a little trash
[40:51] we're in the dumpster now her meeting
[40:55] will win the garbage heaps hallelujah
[40:58] that's where we are Philippians 1:6 we
[41:07] gotta be confident you know I was
[41:09] telling the brother the other day and
[41:11] today I said you know what I cannot miss
[41:13] the rapture Oh see when we say that I
[41:17] want you to understand I'm not saying
[41:18] that I'm gonna make it because I'm not
[41:20] human efforts hallelujah I am going to
[41:25] make it because the works that work that
[41:27] it was determined and finished before
[41:29] the foundation of the law you cannot
[41:33] make it unless God has already become
[41:35] and you're going to make it I have
[41:39] confidence in this message because
[41:42] brother Branham said like this
[41:43] he said when we we are messengers of the
[41:46] message that's where we are messengers
[41:50] of the message my brother sent me that
[41:53] quote just the other day I'm like whoa
[41:54] that's powerful hallelujah and and we
[41:59] are the standard Ouma I'm almost jumping
[42:02] in it but God put us here for a standard
[42:09] we are not like those in Satan's Eden
[42:13] now God
[42:15] say cool away from Satan's either
[42:18] he said well brother ha ha how I'm gonna
[42:21] do it
[42:22] my wife will she teaches the children
[42:24] she says you know about reading and
[42:26] stuff like that you know the question
[42:28] was how do you eat an elephant one bite
[42:30] at a time
[42:32] I like that how do you defeat Satan one
[42:36] time one bite at a time
[42:38] hallelujah amen you get rid of this
[42:42] today get rid of this tomorrow get rid
[42:44] of this as the day comes on you run out
[42:46] of time focus on this thing hallelujah
[42:51] Lord how do I accomplish and accomplish
[42:54] this one at a time focus on where you
[42:58] need where you're at and what you need
[42:59] to do to get where you need to go then
[43:02] you pray Lord I need this help me in
[43:05] this help me in this ain't God good to
[43:10] us his plan remains unbroken he's God
[43:17] and the Bible tells us that everything
[43:20] was fashioned and found there is no
[43:22] alterations God doesn't come up to our
[43:25] day in time like oh I gotta alter this
[43:28] because if I don't alter like I said
[43:30] before God doesn't give curves on your
[43:34] grades
[43:35] he's not gonna law his standard he's
[43:39] perfect
[43:40] totally all the way that God can bring
[43:42] us to perfection is to bring us up to
[43:44] his standard but what really encourages
[43:52] me it's because the work was done and
[43:55] finished now he was talking to Hebrews
[43:58] and said yet I will not let them enter
[44:01] into my rest even though the works were
[44:04] finished before the foundation there
[44:06] were a lot because in the beginning in
[44:08] his mind they never could enter into his
[44:10] rest they had a different operation they
[44:12] had a different future but those are who
[44:17] are divinely chosen to enter into his
[44:22] rest there is not one thing that can
[44:26] keep them from it
[44:28] we're not working with a religious
[44:31] science we're basing our understanding
[44:36] on God promises it's not because we can
[44:42] read and we can understand and in
[44:46] studying like brother varlyn say take a
[44:48] scripture from here and a scripture from
[44:49] there he said all of that's good but the
[44:52] Bible is based upon revelation what good
[44:55] would it do you if you understand all of
[44:58] the Bible and yet you don't even have a
[45:00] revelation that you are true son and
[45:02] daughter of God what good will that do
[45:05] you you must know within your heart that
[45:09] God has made you a son and daughter of
[45:12] God oh I hope this is where it won't he
[45:15] be he says listen coming from possessing
[45:18] all things he says a beautiful type
[45:21] today unworthy worthy of death when we
[45:25] sin but God cannot kill us because he
[45:29] were we are part of Christ
[45:31] that's our grace because we are in union
[45:35] with Christ isn't that a beautiful
[45:37] thought union with Christ so therefore
[45:39] our sins when we do them we ought to
[45:42] quickly confess them that they're wrong
[45:44] because God would take our lives but the
[45:47] blood inserts in our place and God just
[45:51] can't cross the blood God can't cross
[45:55] the blood see he just can't do it
[45:59] because it's a promise that he won't do
[46:02] it so he can't break his own promise so
[46:07] God got himself as it was sewed up see
[46:14] he can't break his promise and he
[46:17] promised it through that blood whosoever
[46:19] believeth that eternal life he cannot
[46:22] break that promise so we find that
[46:25] Abraham in obedience left his home left
[46:28] his land separated from everything all
[46:30] his earthly possession a position to
[46:34] travel in the strange lands or journey a
[46:36] type of the church we've asked to
[46:39] forsake everything that's in this world
[46:42] in order to follow Christ that right
[46:45] Peter said Lord we don't we forsaking
[46:48] everything with a left family we've left
[46:50] everything what we're gonna get
[46:52] he said you gonna get family back to you
[46:55] go get some trials and tribulations
[46:56] hallelujah and you gonna get eternal
[46:59] life see you and I must understand that
[47:02] this message did not come to give us a
[47:04] hope it came to give us an assurance
[47:08] helped us a lot it right because we are
[47:12] in a place where we call Satan's Eden is
[47:16] that right we're in the zenith of it all
[47:19] we how could I say it we're in the
[47:23] culmination you know everything is built
[47:25] up amen we're in the pinnacle the peak
[47:27] amen of all of Satan's work hallelujah
[47:33] we got all kinds of demons against us
[47:37] hallelujah you gotta understand there
[47:40] was a real battle in heaven and that
[47:43] battle now has come down to this earth
[47:45] and God has saved the best for last
[47:48] who you and me hallelujah you may not
[47:52] feel like it but it ain't you that God
[47:55] is saying it's the seed that he planted
[47:57] in you hallelujah
[47:58] why because that word is rising up
[48:01] hallelujah is rising up people and no
[48:06] matter what Satan tries to do he cannot
[48:09] stop the Word of God Wow because the
[48:12] Bible said that word cannot return void
[48:17] there is somebody you ought to be glad
[48:20] that God planted seed in you hallelujah
[48:24] and God quick in that seat you said well
[48:26] brother looks I'm not where I should be
[48:28] I thought about this and been thinking
[48:30] about this I said you can plant a seed
[48:33] once he's messy to come up it has put a
[48:36] stem out here and to put a stem out here
[48:39] it'll put a still out there
[48:41] how many higher is built amen and this
[48:43] flower opened but you rarely see them
[48:45] all open at the same time we're still
[48:49] out of the same seed hallelujah still
[48:53] from the same plant hallelujah and so
[48:55] easy with
[48:56] us it's not how when we put out the
[48:59] bloom it's it's what time is what I'm in
[49:04] it's not what time you start blooming
[49:06] it's the fact that you are going to
[49:08] bloom as long as you have that same life
[49:12] in you that the first steelhead you got
[49:15] to bring forth yours it is like in
[49:20] nature he shows a man and you can plan
[49:24] all seas at the same time and they won't
[49:26] come up at the same time my wife was
[49:28] teaching the children planting little
[49:30] potatoes and stuff like that and they
[49:32] all planted at the same time and a
[49:34] little Judah plant came up like Ruth his
[49:38] plant sprouted up before anybody else I
[49:41] think a couple of them she had to change
[49:42] over sort of him because they never
[49:44] didn't come up you know and that's how
[49:47] it is hallelujah but everybody has their
[49:50] season yeah it's reachable why we cause
[49:58] we can we could not come up to him he
[50:00] had to come down to us is that right
[50:02] it's nothing but the true but humility
[50:06] is the key humbling yourself is the key
[50:09] remember brother Branham talked about
[50:11] this great painting I think notice that
[50:13] artwork and in this artwork was supposed
[50:16] to show Jesus Christ and and this man
[50:19] was really disturbed by because he said
[50:21] I don't see no agony I don't I don't see
[50:23] no pain in this man's face I don't see
[50:25] what this and and the keeper of the the
[50:28] artwork says it's because of the way
[50:30] you're looking at it he said you got to
[50:33] get down and look up once the man went
[50:37] down and looked up he like oh my god huh
[50:42] see you'll never be able to see Jesus
[50:45] Christ on this message until you get
[50:47] down you got a humble yourself
[50:50] hallelujah you got to see the beauty of
[50:53] this thing it's when you on your knees
[50:55] hallelujah not when you're standing up
[50:58] hallelujah is went on when you're on
[51:00] your knees it's so powerful because here
[51:07] you said was that the bride have a
[51:08] ministry she's got a ministry revelation
[51:11] 22:17 says and the spirit and the bride
[51:13] say come and let him that here and say
[51:19] come and let him that is athirst come
[51:22] and whosoever will let him take the
[51:26] water of life freely
[51:28] we got a ministry we just got to get on
[51:31] the job our ministry say come hear what
[51:36] God has said in this day hallelujah did
[51:39] not you know God is sent to John godess
[51:43] it's Allah and Elijah
[51:45] hallelujah we're not supposed to be
[51:47] ashamed of the name William Branham
[51:49] either American people y'all far we
[51:52] funny hallelujah and I know because
[51:55] we've had some powerful calls to come
[51:57] through this place well I think Jim
[52:00] Jones is just one of them you know and
[52:03] every time people hear of a prophet they
[52:04] talk about Jim Jones right I remember
[52:08] the time when this bandit brother rich
[52:10] job made
[52:10] mockery a rich when we had that shut-in
[52:13] you are all rich better not drank the
[52:15] kool-aid that man right now was George
[52:17] he's dead it had a horrible disease took
[52:20] him out just like that you cannot make
[52:23] mockery and think you're going to get
[52:25] away with it it ain't going to happen
[52:28] the saddest part is the man never asked
[52:31] for prayer didn't never repentant as far
[52:33] as we know uh so what do you think he is
[52:38] see no matter what people think we are
[52:41] and they could say you know oh y'all
[52:43] called y'all off the word you don't know
[52:44] where you know you don't know not see
[52:46] that they said it about Jesus they call
[52:48] him a devil the word himself they don't
[52:52] call you what they gotta call you the
[52:54] Bible said blessed is the man who's
[52:55] persecuted for my name's sake oh oh come
[53:04] on somebody see what right now we are
[53:06] here to show the power of the seed he's
[53:12] over
[53:13] week but that's kind of where God won't
[53:15] you it sometimes he because he said when
[53:18] you a week that's perfect strength then
[53:22] God can use you when you know you weak
[53:25] hallelujah
[53:26] see God don't use proud people and folks
[53:29] that think they dis that you know that
[53:30] God don't care about that but when you
[53:33] see a man that knows he's nothing and he
[53:35] knows he can't make it without God those
[53:38] are the kind of people God uses learning
[53:43] to lean Oh hallelujah I'm so week long a
[53:47] caged animal self a lawyer of lead I
[53:49] have a leader to Jesus
[53:51] hey that's what God wants he want those
[53:54] who can lean on him oh my god think
[54:00] about it we get it ready to experience
[54:02] some things people and people's over
[54:04] when the squeeze come on down low with
[54:05] y'all talking man I'm feeling some
[54:07] squeeze now yeah it may not be as hard
[54:11] as it gonna be but it's hey that's the
[54:12] birth pains going on in here and and I
[54:15] want you to know amen the pressure is on
[54:20] hallelujah
[54:21] coming from the how the message Pat but
[54:23] I said the power of the seat now how
[54:25] many I'm gonna read this because I want
[54:27] you to understand if John had it you got
[54:29] it
[54:30] hmm he said you will notice that John
[54:33] has addressed himself to the Christian
[54:35] as a brother in tribulation so don't
[54:39] worry about it folks tribulation is part
[54:42] of John's business and guess what you
[54:45] type out John think it not strange when
[54:49] you fall into divers temptations knowing
[54:51] that the trying of your faith is more
[54:53] precious than gold hallelujah amen he
[54:59] said you will notice that John had
[55:00] addressed himself to the Christians
[55:02] hands a brother in tribulation it was at
[55:05] this time that the early church was
[55:08] going through great persecution their
[55:11] religion was not only everywhere spoken
[55:14] against is it like this oh you talk
[55:16] about God sending a prophet gods and
[55:18] enlarging in America it's spoken again
[55:21] you can't find one book in a bookstore
[55:24] hallelujah but you can find
[55:26] harikrishna Allah and everybody else in
[55:29] some world right but when it comes him
[55:31] into this Amen they tried to wipe it out
[55:35] hallelujah oh but what they fail to see
[55:40] is the book wasn't wiped out the book
[55:43] was eaten hallelujah
[55:47] he meant it may not be on the Shelf but
[55:49] the Bible said they were walking in
[55:51] pistols living Ridley pistols read by
[55:53] man the devil could never destroy the
[55:57] word their religion was not only
[56:01] everywhere folks spoken against but the
[56:04] people themselves were imprisoned and
[56:06] killed John like multitude of others was
[56:10] now suffering imprisonment of the Word
[56:11] of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ
[56:14] when arrested they tried in vain to kill
[56:18] him by balling him in oil Oh for 24
[56:25] hours Oh y'all people don't know what
[56:30] they got coming is worse than that and
[56:34] the only way that you're gonna escape
[56:36] this is that you got to have the same
[56:38] thing John hand hallelujah
[56:42] oh come on sorry John had an anointing
[56:47] and a God and him that cannot be boiled
[56:53] hallelujah he enraged listen he be
[56:57] enraged and powerless officials this
[57:00] sentence him to pantless has a which
[57:03] they couldn't kill him so let's get rid
[57:07] of this winch and they put him on the
[57:09] Isle of Patmos hello that's exactly
[57:11] where God wanted him to be they thought
[57:15] of they put him out there with the
[57:16] snakes and the scorpions nature would
[57:19] kill him hallelujah but they did not
[57:21] know the promise this one John will not
[57:25] die he will see the promises
[57:30] of the coming of the Lord is that right
[57:32] not that he wouldn't God in the natural
[57:34] but the Bible said before he would he
[57:36] would see the coming of the Lord even
[57:39] though the project possible in all they
[57:42] misunderstood the quote but he he lived
[57:44] it God manifested himself huh that's the
[57:47] power of the seed you saw our brothers
[57:50] were listen in your seed you have the
[57:53] power if they would put you in a batch
[57:57] of oil John is already this difference
[58:00] demonstrated the power of the seed don't
[58:05] you know when they take our automobiles
[58:08] Ravello my gardener took my car
[58:10] come on get there hallelujah talk to
[58:12] Philip hallelujah Philip had the power
[58:16] of the seed of God in him do you think
[58:19] God put it in the Bible for you to
[58:20] entertain you he was trying to show you
[58:23] what you had in you and what he was
[58:26] yesterday he's the same today
[58:29] God don't change that's why would it
[58:32] come the evening kind of sickness that
[58:34] devil has no right and the only right
[58:38] the devil have the hold on you you give
[58:40] it to him but a man or woman that really
[58:43] believed the Word of God hallelujah that
[58:46] is your solution to every devil show me
[58:51] and we would have never known but
[58:53] brother Brennan says Jesus was sick
[58:56] every devil tried to hit him but you
[59:00] never seen him running for help it was
[59:04] the word that defeated everything for
[59:07] him you love the Lord I'm excited why
[59:13] because I don't know how far how much
[59:16] longer my journey is on this earth
[59:18] hallelujah but I believe I'm a
[59:21] translated saying if God don't translate
[59:24] me he's surely where rap to me ah
[59:26] because I've got the power in the seed
[59:29] or the seed of the power is in me
[59:31] hallelujah woo if the devil only
[59:35] understood that God's seed was power
[59:38] what was that power brother BAM said it

[59:43] something like that he said that power
[59:44] authority hallelujah that's what the
[59:48] opening of the seals did for us people

[1:00:22] is not bound
[1:00:24] nobody can bind God the only one who can
[1:00:27] bind him as him himself he binds himself
[1:00:30] to his word what a powerful man he is
[1:00:34] all right
[1:00:36] Wow because we realized that whatever he
[1:00:38] says it has to come to pass we don't
[1:00:42] need have no need to darling what my
[1:00:44] point is this what what what what can
[1:00:47] you gain by doubting God because
[1:00:50] whatever he has declared is going to
[1:00:52] happen anyhow huh it's going to happen
[1:00:56] oh I don't believe that there's gonna be
[1:00:58] a flood you believe he said it was going
[1:01:02] to have a flood and he flooded is that
[1:01:07] right he said go tell Damon told dip
[1:01:10] seven times seven times naman and if you
[1:01:13] did seven times you gonna come up home

[1:01:27] can't have de magnetic and restore your
[1:01:29] fingers but God said go tell naman go

[1:01:35] come up home Naima said I got the dump
[1:01:38] in that old nasty water hallelujah I
[1:01:41] don't care how nasty it would have been
[1:01:43] hallelujah knowing my condition
[1:01:45] hallelujah and you want to be made whole
[1:01:48] what good why do you care how God give
[1:01:51] me the Holy Ghost he may give you the
[1:01:53] Holy Ghost just sitting still he may
[1:01:55] give me the Holy Ghost run
[1:01:57] roll into whatever what good I don't
[1:01:59] care whatever it takes everybody trying
[1:02:04] to get to God did take the God how to
[1:02:06] give them the holy goes out all day I
[1:02:08] don't want that kind you don't want that
[1:02:10] kind you don't get that kind who cares
[1:02:16] or what I can tell you he totally do
[1:02:18] caught wind slipped and everything else
[1:02:19] I'd do everything I can to do it even if
[1:02:21] he said Brad was flip
[1:02:23] keep practicing can I do till I can do
[1:02:25] one just to get what his promise is you
[1:02:29] understand oh here's another you can't
[1:02:34] pray enough the Bible said pray without
[1:02:36] ceasing I you know I looked and I was
[1:02:39] talking to her brother and and say you
[1:02:40] know what really I do I that's what
[1:02:42] Satan fighting me more than anything I
[1:02:44] like to feel him you know I don't always
[1:02:47] feeling when I'm praying but I always
[1:02:50] believe it ain't by my feelings it's
[1:02:55] about what I'm believing if I come to
[1:02:57] God and prayer and ask him of anything
[1:02:58] that's what he said he said listen he
[1:03:00] said I will hear you and that's what
[1:03:03] I've concluded ain't about feeling today
[1:03:06] it's about faith hallelujah because I
[1:03:09] know one thing when your body is racked
[1:03:11] with pain you do not feel like
[1:03:13] hallelujah but when you ask God to heal
[1:03:16] you he will the hallelujah comes after
[1:03:19] the healing we can rest assure that we
[1:03:26] are people that has been handpicked by
[1:03:29] God who has a promised us eternal life
[1:03:31] and he cannot go back boy you see what
[1:03:35] brother Bruce I'm not what I should be
[1:03:37] don't you worry God will make it happen
[1:03:40] hallelujah you know you believe in one
[1:03:48] touch that's all God is one touch that
[1:03:52] later said it all but if I could just
[1:03:53] touch the heel of his garment I'll be
[1:03:57] made whole that's all one touch
[1:04:00] hallelujah a one word from God
[1:04:02] hallelujah Young
[1:04:04] stand me the man who have been blind the
[1:04:07] man who who's at the Pool of Bethesda
[1:04:09] all he had to do was come in contact
[1:04:12] with the Creator who was Jesus Christ
[1:04:15] himself hallelujah that's all you need
[1:04:18] hallelujah tonight just come in contact
[1:04:20] with him and your night will be turning
[1:04:25] today this is my family time
[1:04:31] hello when I come to church I come to
[1:04:34] see family I don't come to see strangers
[1:04:38] oh come on I don't even come to see
[1:04:41] cousins or aunts uncles or grandad is a
[1:04:45] grandpa I come to see brothers and
[1:04:47] sisters hallelujah
[1:04:54] listen it's the truth we are special
[1:04:57] class of people a special class of
[1:05:01] people you know we so worried about our
[1:05:05] failures and we forgot we were failures
[1:05:07] when we came to God then God gives you
[1:05:13] the Holy Ghost or give you ears to hear
[1:05:15] how many I believe that the Bible said
[1:05:17] blessed is the man who can hear not just
[1:05:21] read it if you can just read could
[1:05:24] there's some of us who can't read and
[1:05:25] comprehend holiday but if we can hear it
[1:05:30] so you can be blessed and cursed at the
[1:05:32] same time oh my he said you remember and
[1:05:40] this is from Revelation chapter one the
[1:05:43] revelation of Jesus Christ he said you
[1:05:45] recall that I mentioned at the beginning
[1:05:47] of this message that this book we are
[1:05:49] studying is the actual revelation of
[1:05:52] Jesus himself in the church and his
[1:05:55] works in the future ages that I
[1:05:57] mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit
[1:05:59] to give us revelation or we will fail to
[1:06:01] get it bringing these two thoughts
[1:06:04] together you will see that it won't take
[1:06:06] your just ordinary study and thinking to
[1:06:09] make this book ordinary studying and
[1:06:13] thinking to make this book real it is
[1:06:16] going to take the
[1:06:18] operation of the Holy Ghost that mean
[1:06:20] that means this book cannot be revealed
[1:06:23] to anyone but a special class of people
[1:06:26] it will take one with prophetic insight
[1:06:29] it would require their ability to hear
[1:06:31] from God it would require supernatural
[1:06:34] instructions not just from a student
[1:06:36] comparing verses with verse though that
[1:06:39] is good but a mysterious a mystery
[1:06:41] requires the teaching of the Spirit or
[1:06:44] will never become clear how we need to
[1:06:48] hear from God and lay ourselves open and
[1:06:51] become unit to the spirit to hear and
[1:06:54] know as I have already said the book
[1:06:58] revelation is the consummation of the
[1:07:00] scripture it is even placed exactly
[1:07:03] right in the Canon of the scripture at
[1:07:05] the end now you can know why it says
[1:07:10] that anyone who reads or even hears it
[1:07:13] is blessed it is the revelation of God
[1:07:15] that would give you authority over the
[1:07:17] devil well it is the revelation of God
[1:07:20] that would give you authority over the
[1:07:23] devil and you can see why they would
[1:07:26] walk would add or take away from it it's
[1:07:29] cursed
[1:07:30] it would have to be so for who can add
[1:07:33] or take away from the perfect revelation
[1:07:36] of God and overcome the enemy it is that
[1:07:40] simple there is nothing of such
[1:07:42] prevailing power as a revelation of the
[1:07:44] word see in verse 3 a blessing is
[1:07:47] pronounced on those who give special
[1:07:50] attention to this book I think this
[1:07:53] refers to the Old Testament custom of
[1:07:55] the priest reading the word to the
[1:07:57] congregation in the morning you see many
[1:08:00] could not read so the priest had to read
[1:08:02] to them as long as it was the word and
[1:08:06] the blessings was there it didn't matter
[1:08:09] if it was read or heard y'all hear me so
[1:08:14] you look at this thing where I don't
[1:08:15] know what I should do hear it or read it
[1:08:18] you got two options hearing it or
[1:08:22] reading it it may call God pronounces
[1:08:25] blessings on you whew somebody help me
[1:08:29] help me help me you and I must realize
[1:08:31] by God's grace the devil is man eat cake
[1:08:36] stop it oh he thought all I will stop
[1:08:43] this prophecy and he put Jesus in the
[1:08:46] grave for three days and put a Roman
[1:08:49] stone who put all those guards around
[1:08:53] that stone don't you let him get up
[1:08:59] hallelujah
[1:09:01] but what they found a seed it was out of
[1:09:03] their hands the world of God could not
[1:09:05] they could have put two stones three
[1:09:08] stones
[1:09:10] whatever it would have never kept him in
[1:09:13] the grave because the Bible had already
[1:09:16] spoken I will not let his body see
[1:09:18] corruption
[1:09:19] that's when I hear him when I hear the
[1:09:22] scripture say that I don't think about
[1:09:23] the one man I think about the body of
[1:09:25] Christ I will not let them see
[1:09:27] corruption there will be a resurrection
[1:09:35] that what he tried to corrupt us we
[1:09:37] can't why because the flesh is already
[1:09:40] corrupted hallelujah
[1:09:42] but that's all no matter how he tries
[1:09:46] the seal cannot be broken hallelujah
[1:09:49] amen when God put his life in you
[1:09:51] hallelujah the devil was finished that
[1:09:55] was finished this flesh already judged
[1:09:59] God gave you the Holy Ghost and put it
[1:10:03] in a flesh is already condemned and
[1:10:05] judged hallelujah God knew that this
[1:10:11] flesh was gonna give you trouble that's
[1:10:13] why I said grieve not the Holy Ghost
[1:10:15] whereby you will see you to the day of
[1:10:17] your Redemption see we look at the
[1:10:20] grieve I look at the seal to the day
[1:10:25] listen cuz you and I must understand God
[1:10:29] always does or will do a perfect work
[1:10:35] now
[1:10:37] half won't do I was there 59 19 through
[1:10:42] 21 so shall they fear the name of the
[1:10:44] Lord from the West and its glory from
[1:10:47] the rising of the Sun when the enemy
[1:10:50] shall come in like a flood the Spirit of
[1:10:53] the Lord shall lift up a standard
[1:10:55] against him
[1:10:56] somebody ought to understand what I'm
[1:10:59] saying hallelujah
[1:11:00] what was he working with this thing the
[1:11:03] enemy shall come like a flood and God
[1:11:07] will lift up a standard what is that
[1:11:10] standard oh I'll tell you there's a lot
[1:11:12] of things that went under the flood of
[1:11:14] Noah but what came out is the thing
[1:11:17] that's true at the flood was the pyramid
[1:11:19] hallelujah and the bride can take
[1:11:23] whatever flood God's allowed to come oh
[1:11:29] I'm not talking about your first time I
[1:11:32] was in you yes we use that same
[1:11:39] scripture on an everyday basis but
[1:11:41] there's coming a flood the Bible says
[1:11:45] that even when that dragon opened his
[1:11:46] mouth a flood comes out brother Balaam
[1:11:51] said that flood came out against what
[1:11:53] the bride of Jesus Christ he also used
[1:11:54] it as as a type of what's gonna happen
[1:11:57] with Israel hallelujah but that son was
[1:12:01] caught up and he used that same type
[1:12:04] working with the resurrection and you
[1:12:06] know what I'm saying it's coming the
[1:12:08] same time when that flood comes we're
[1:12:10] gone Israel gonna have to walk in the
[1:12:15] wilderness for three and a half years
[1:12:17] and there Dean shall come to Zion and
[1:12:22] unto them that turn from the great
[1:12:25] transgression and did unto Jacob said
[1:12:28] the Lord see what I'm saying as for me
[1:12:31] this is my covenant with them saith the
[1:12:33] Lord my spirit that is upon them thee in
[1:12:37] my words which I put in thy mouth shall
[1:12:40] not depart out of that mouth nor out of
[1:12:44] the mouth of that seed nor out of the
[1:12:47] mouth of that CC said the Lord from his
[1:12:51] and forever hallelujah amen a lot of
[1:12:55] times you don't even know you got it in
[1:12:57] you until something happens then the
[1:12:59] Word of God comes out hallelujah
[1:13:01] why because God has placed it in your
[1:13:04] mouth hallelujah
[1:13:05] who do you think living this Tabernacle
[1:13:07] hallelujah I hadn't told you God don't
[1:13:10] work with duplexes hallelujah it's a
[1:13:12] single room house hallelujah and Jesus
[1:13:15] Christ is sitting on his throne where in
[1:13:18] you is that the truth when the Bible
[1:13:22] tells us that think is Ezekiel got old
[1:13:24] Lucifer no Isaiah we stop it I'm gonna
[1:13:26] rise and I'm gonna excel above the
[1:13:29] throne of God and what do you think he
[1:13:31] talking about God ain't he told David
[1:13:33] what house can you build me you know
[1:13:37] here I'm saying the earth is my
[1:13:39] footstool and heaven is my throne
[1:13:42] how can you build me a house you see
[1:13:45] what I'm saying what did God God's
[1:13:46] throne in the beginning was the heart of
[1:13:48] man
[1:13:49] somebody help me here see it is the
[1:13:52] devil right now that's working with the
[1:13:53] heart - hallelujah he meant because the
[1:13:57] Bible said he was set in the house of
[1:13:59] God on the throne the throne of God it
[1:14:01] meant declaring himself that He is God
[1:14:03] he's a liar
[1:14:05] but he's already there in the hearts of
[1:14:07] denominationalism and organisations
[1:14:10] setting on their hearts declared that he
[1:14:13] is God hallelujah feed him the Trinity
[1:14:16] hallelujah but all there shall be light
[1:14:19] in the evening time
[1:14:21] hallelujah where God has come to expose
[1:14:24] who's on the throne hallelujah and the
[1:14:27] Bible said that light comes and he
[1:14:29] throws him off the throne y'all better
[1:14:32] help me come on this ain't just the city
[1:14:37] that's - but you gotta understand
[1:14:40] everything that's happening a TRO is
[1:14:42] what's happening spiritual you say well
[1:14:47] I don't know about that well explain
[1:14:49] this brother man think I said in it he
[1:14:50] said in the future home he said and he
[1:14:53] takes that scripture where Jesus said
[1:14:54] I'm gonna sit on my Father's throne well
[1:14:59] where his father's gonna be who
[1:15:03] and you got to understand God ain't
[1:15:04] talking about no chair but brother
[1:15:08] Baylor has they used types and symbols
[1:15:10] amen to show us cuz he shows us that
[1:15:12] here's the pillar of fire Jesus sitting
[1:15:14] on the throne and here's the people of
[1:15:16] God those who are redeemed halle-loo
[1:15:18] he's got to show us where the authority
[1:15:19] is the authority goes back into the very
[1:15:23] that is back to the the Elohim but
[1:15:26] brother Branham said that God will not
[1:15:27] ever to return back to that but because
[1:15:31] his throne would be his people how you
[1:15:35] go judge people because the Prophet god
[1:15:39] said to us he said God is omnipresent he
[1:15:42] said but not because he's everywhere but
[1:15:46] because of his foreknowledge he said God
[1:15:48] is a person hallelujah but all but if
[1:15:53] God got a lickin you a licking me like
[1:15:56] he had Adam out Anna who Anna was the
[1:15:59] throne of God on earth hallelujah that's
[1:16:03] why Adam could name all the animals
[1:16:05] correctly because it was God in Adam
[1:16:09] name in the animals and so when it comes
[1:16:12] him into judgment you and I must
[1:16:14] understand we're not gonna be judging
[1:16:16] the people of cause of our righteousness
[1:16:18] it will be judging the people to call of
[1:16:20] his holiness it's God in us judging the
[1:16:23] people somebody help me
[1:16:37] 23 and 29 through 29 the steps of a good
[1:16:41] man are ordered by the Lord and he
[1:16:45] delighteth in his way a good man anybody
[1:16:50] know what I'm talking about who's a good
[1:16:51] land yeah you got to realize that rich
[1:16:56] the ruler said oh good master he said
[1:16:58] hold up there's only one good and that's
[1:17:01] God hallelujah so if you calling me good
[1:17:04] master you understand this God is with
[1:17:06] me oh oh he said Jesus said he loved
[1:17:11] that he loved the boy him and then he
[1:17:15] fell let me go back the steps of a good
[1:17:17] man are ordered by the Lord and he
[1:17:19] delighted in his way though he fall he
[1:17:22] shall not be utterly cast down for the
[1:17:25] lord upholdeth him with his hand I have
[1:17:29] been young and now I'm old yet I have
[1:17:32] not seen the righteous forsaken nor his
[1:17:35] seed begging bread he is for he is ever
[1:17:38] merciful and lived it and his seed is
[1:17:43] blessed depart from evil and do good and
[1:17:46] dwell forever for the Lord loveth
[1:17:49] judgment and forsaken not his Saints
[1:17:52] they are preserved forever but the seed
[1:17:57] of the wicked shall be cut off the
[1:17:59] righteous shall inherit the land and
[1:18:01] dwell therein forever now believe that
[1:18:05] hallelujah
[1:18:06] you said well I'm not righteousness yes
[1:18:08] I am you may not be but I am he became
[1:18:12] my sin that I might become his
[1:18:14] righteousness and if he says I'm his
[1:18:16] righteousness
[1:18:17] I am his righteousness Romans 8:26 y'all
[1:18:28] don't mind do you
[1:18:29] Romans 8:26 2:30 I'm trying to encourage
[1:18:32] you oh my god I II I'm entered into his
[1:18:36] rest
[1:18:38] Hey I worried no more hallelujah
[1:18:42] yeah and what you think you gonna change
[1:18:46] something in all your prayers the
[1:18:56] perfect will of God is still will be
[1:18:58] done and he doesn't owe me no
[1:19:04] explanation
[1:19:05] I accept every choice of God Amen what
[1:19:12] he choose to do is all right with me
[1:19:14] look like I will tell her somebody I
[1:19:16] said now the point is what is it gonna
[1:19:20] profit you to disagree with him hello
[1:19:25] the Bob said can anyone instruct him
[1:19:36] anybody got some wise counseling to give
[1:19:39] him but I says you know what you have
[1:19:48] his mind is that the word he said what
[1:19:52] you have is mine that's powerful to me
[1:19:58] so let it be Lord so let it be Romans
[1:20:02] 8:26 says likewise the spirit also
[1:20:04] helpeth our infirmities but we know not
[1:20:07] what we should pray for as we ought but
[1:20:10] the Spirit itself making intercession
[1:20:12] for our groanings which cannot be
[1:20:14] uttered and live even in times when you
[1:20:17] don't pray he prays even at times when
[1:20:22] you shouldn't should be praying he prays
[1:20:26] even in times when you don't know how to
[1:20:28] pray he's praying hallelujah you got to

[1:29:04] why I wouldn't devil try to bring all
[1:29:05] the things that you you say W wrong
[1:29:06] That's not me
[1:29:08] that's the other person I'm a new
[1:29:11] creation I don't want that anymore
[1:29:13] I don't eat that garbage no more right
[1:29:15] how many y'all in here go around right
[1:29:17] now I'm gonna eat them in the garbage I
[1:29:19] don't care if their eyes and nets and
[1:29:21] worms even who know that's what we do
[1:29:24] sometimes hallelujah when you go back to
[1:29:27] the pig nature that's what you become
[1:29:29] hallelujah and but just to see a man
[1:29:32] Amen right now going there and you see
[1:29:34] the garbage in the slop and you it would
[1:29:36] make you sick
[1:29:37] ha because your nature is different it's
[1:29:40] not in a man to eat slop Bella Bevin
[1:29:43] said only when a man is really hungry
[1:29:45] will he eat out of a garbage can because
[1:29:47] I'll never say I won't get out of it is
[1:29:56] that right
[1:29:57] see he was the beginning of God's
[1:29:59] creation I thought Lord that is so true
[1:30:00] and then Jesus come out at last the last
[1:30:03] church I was telling brother Dan said
[1:30:04] what people don't see it ho my god
[1:30:07] what people don't see in this message is
[1:30:08] God's new creation it was so tired to
[1:30:13] lay on the sea and tied to all of the
[1:30:14] things that denominationalism we can't
[1:30:17] even see that there's a new creation
[1:30:18] going on this message hallelujah
[1:30:22] hallelujah Oh mate oh lord have mercy
[1:30:26] but but brother branham tells about he
[1:30:29] said when you know I've heard people say
[1:30:31] I've heard people say a lot of things
[1:30:33] and I'm not going to try to interpret
[1:30:34] but I said there was a half-hour silence
[1:30:37] and you think and I all I know is that
[1:30:40] if Jesus Christ was the beginning of
[1:30:41] creation there was something going on
[1:30:43] that he wasn't telling everybody and all
[1:30:46] of the ages harshed and see you can go
[1:30:51] throughout the scriptures and you'll
[1:30:52] never see where the heavens crushed
[1:30:56] that's why this message is so powerful
[1:30:59] and God is doing something but is
[1:31:04] dealing with creation he's working
[1:31:11] something in us that even the angels
[1:31:14] can't figure out how such a nasty people
[1:31:20] out of later see he'll come up in here
[1:31:22] who doctors generation well hello
[1:31:26] that's the word he came to the worst age
[1:31:30] ever with filth was the grain is beer
[1:31:33] raining and he chose somebody like you
[1:31:38] is that right brother branham said he
[1:31:41] just saw just like a man getting the
[1:31:43] dirty glass he picks it up a little I
[1:31:46] kind of like this class and then he
[1:31:49] washes his he sanctifies it he says
[1:31:51] sometime he might put it up on the shelf
[1:31:53] until the day of his use hallelujah God
[1:31:58] might have you on a waiting period but
[1:32:00] at some point in time he gonna use you
[1:32:02] and when he usually gonna feel you
[1:32:06] hallelujah yes sir he gonna fill you up
[1:32:10] ain't no doubt about it
[1:32:14] but the devil wish he understood what
[1:32:17] was going on because he had only one
[1:32:18] time he messed up one time word and only
[1:32:27] because his thought was impure one time
[1:32:31] but think about the river the RET the
[1:32:33] rebellion that that devil brought in
[1:32:36] heaven because of the way he thought and
[1:32:38] how many angels that we don't even know
[1:32:41] fail for his life and me and they're
[1:32:47] doing the same thing you see these
[1:32:49] people looking for glory they're doing
[1:32:51] the same thing Lucifer did they're using
[1:32:54] God's power for their glory hallelujah
[1:32:59] ain't like a real church silver and gold
[1:33:03] have I none but such as I have brother
[1:33:05] Brando say that's when you know you've
[1:33:06] got a real pillar cause the preacher is
[1:33:09] that right oh you see these people out
[1:33:12] here with all kind of Cadillacs all
[1:33:13] coming this and all kind of that day
[1:33:14] nothing but Church pimps that's what
[1:33:21] they are it brought them like in the
[1:33:23] organizations that's prostitution

[1:33:47] something this word is real I don't see
[1:33:50] the dead raised and stuff like that so
[1:33:51] nobody can tell me it's not real I
[1:33:53] haven't seen the denominational creature
[1:33:55] yet do it because not one can do it but

[1:34:38] vessel of God what I've seen hallelujah

[1:35:14] going to something like so it just gonna
[1:35:15] happen and you're gonna die she said did
[1:35:17] the Lord did Jesus tell you that I want
[1:35:20] to hear your bad news when you became
[1:35:24] God hallelujah is this okay
[1:35:27] you see we want one seed I don't care

[1:35:40] emphasis hair we got the same seed is
[1:35:45] that right it will produce the same
[1:35:47] thing
[1:35:49] and I'ma read it to you in just a moment
[1:35:51] take my shower I don't want no other man
[1:35:54] I want Yoshi it was a law that if a
[1:35:59] brother died
[1:36:00] without giving his wife children well
[1:36:02] the brother next to the brother could go
[1:36:05] and lay with her so that woman would
[1:36:07] have a see y'all hear what I'm saying in
[1:36:15] other words my brother and I carry the
[1:36:17] same seed from my daddy
[1:36:23] y'all and in that side typically Amen of
[1:36:29] course in the natural you find a little
[1:36:31] differences in the DNA you might find a
[1:36:32] little sum that traveled but when God
[1:36:34] seed is pure nothing at it nothing take
[1:36:39] it away that's why I said whatever you
[1:36:41] do with this word don't take away don't
[1:36:42] add to it the Word of God is pure is it
[1:36:45] is hallelujah and take my Amen you know
[1:36:49] I loved tomorrow

[1:36:58] Judah fell for Judah had a weakness I
[1:37:01] said a weakness but God knows my point
[1:37:05] is seem that God used in God used him if
[1:37:11] we look from the columbine and Solomon
[1:37:13] we would say you know someone was sick a
[1:37:16] thousand wives but God were using him
[1:37:21] and maybe that's all God needed him far
[1:37:24] other than ruling Israel people said
[1:37:27] well he went into a dollar tree God sent
[1:37:30] him down he did what God said and he may
[1:37:34] have come short but brother branham's in
[1:37:35] the message as I was with Moses he said
[1:37:38] God don't look at your mistakes he look
[1:37:39] at the Commission and as long as you
[1:37:42] fulfill the Commission your mistakes
[1:37:44] means nothing to God hallelujah
[1:37:47] you shall solve enough to go to hell
[1:37:50] Sodom Lane inhale Solomon is in heaven

[1:38:21] hallelujah so you got to realize him and
[1:38:26] guarding just awakened by somebody's
[1:38:28] mistake he knows you're gonna make a
[1:38:29] mistake bow before he gave you the Holy
[1:38:32] Ghost he knew it but here Amen in
[1:38:37] Genesis 30 12 through 19 amen
[1:38:40] the Bible said in the process of the
[1:38:42] time the daughter schewe Judas wife died
[1:38:45] and Judah was confront comforted and
[1:38:48] went up into the sheep he rose to Thema
[1:38:51] teen ass he and his friend Howard and

[1:39:06] off from her and covered her with a veil
[1:39:08] and wrapped herself and set in one open
[1:39:11] place which is by the way of Timnath but
[1:39:14] she saw that Sheila was grown and she
[1:39:16] was not given unto him to wife when
[1:39:19] Judah saw her he taught her to be a
[1:39:21] harlot and because she had covered her
[1:39:24] face and he turned in to her by the way

[1:47:02] met with the wrong man hallelujah ever
[1:47:05] and then we saw the dead see Jesus
[1:47:08] raised them going up amen he realized
[1:47:11] that was the Messiah I had him in my
[1:47:13] hair and he got away because there was a
[1:47:20] world that God had spoken they couldn't
[1:47:26] keep him down cain't no grave I wish I
[1:47:29] could sing that song ain't no grave hold

[1:47:43] that one though oh he was taken from
[1:47:47] prison and from judgment and who should
[1:47:50] declare his generation the question was
[1:47:54] asked who should give brother you own
[1:47:56] you own it you see who shows because
[1:48:01] generation God is my feet peel them all
[1:48:11] over me but most of all I know he's in
[1:48:14] there oh and he made his grave with the
[1:48:22] wicked that means I don't have to make
[1:48:24] my grave with the wicked and with the
[1:48:29] rich in his death because he had done
[1:48:31] that way I worried about the rich pause
[1:48:37] he had no pilot and neither was only
[1:48:41] decedent no deceit in his mouth but
[1:48:43] there was violence in us there was
[1:48:46] deceit in us hallelujah but he took it
[1:48:49] for us come on somebody y'all need to go
[1:48:51] to Calvary just for the moment and
[1:48:54] see what he did for you how so you can
[1:48:56] be appreciative of what he's done
[1:48:58] hallelujah you know God don't like it
[1:49:00] when you're not appreciating what he's
[1:49:02] done God don't like it when you don't
[1:49:04] believe what he's done
[1:49:08] hallelujah yet it pleased the Lord to
[1:49:12] bruise him you know the problem here is
[1:49:14] that we we got things we don't want to
[1:49:16] give up when you want to give something
[1:49:19] up you give it I don't care if it takes
[1:49:22] you forever to give it up you give it up
[1:49:24] when you want to give it up and if you
[1:49:28] love a pleasure more than that shows you
[1:49:30] your lover pleasure more than God when
[1:49:33] you don't want to give it up and you
[1:49:34] know it's wrong you love pleasure more
[1:49:37] than you love God you need to ask God to
[1:49:40] help you there yet it pleased the Lord
[1:49:42] to bruise him he had put him to grief
[1:49:45] when thou shalt make his soul an
[1:49:47] offering for sin he shall see his seed
[1:49:54] he shall prolong his days and the
[1:49:57] pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
[1:49:59] his hands is that right he shall see the
[1:50:03] travail of his soul and shall be
[1:50:05] satisfied by his knowledge shall my
[1:50:07] righteous servant justify many for he
[1:50:10] shall bear their iniquities therefore
[1:50:12] when I divide him a portion with the
[1:50:14] Great and he should divide the spoil
[1:50:16] with the strong because he had poured
[1:50:18] out his soul unto death and he was
[1:50:20] numbered with the transgressors and he
[1:50:22] bare the sins of many and made
[1:50:25] intercession for the transgressors
[1:50:30] foe my last Scripture
[1:50:32] now he says those things and I'm going
[1:50:35] to show you the power of the sea because
[1:50:37] in acts 2 832 38 this is my last
[1:50:40] Scripture here's this unit reading in
[1:50:42] Isaiah and he's reading the scripture
[1:50:48] let me read it to you then the plays of
[1:50:50] the scripture where he read was this he
[1:50:52] was led as a sheep to the slaughter and
[1:50:54] that's a lamb done before his Shearer's
[1:50:56] to open open he not his mouth and in his
[1:50:59] humiliation his judgment was taken away
[1:51:01] and who shall declare his generation for
[1:51:03] his life is taken from the earth and
[1:51:05] that eunuch answered Philip
[1:51:08] I pray thee of who speaking to prophet
[1:51:10] this of himself or some other man here
[1:51:15] was a see a you knock mmm you know it's
[1:51:24] just no sleep that's all he was but the
[1:51:26] point is he would see he will see wait a
[1:51:35] minute they held a revival according
[1:51:38] brother morality they having a revival
[1:51:40] and God say Phillip I got somebody you
[1:51:43] need to go talk to you ah you know what
[1:51:48] people have a hard time when I feel like
[1:51:50] a demon is trying to judge trying to
[1:51:52] challenge me I can't do nothing but I'm
[1:51:54] gonna tell you something God can when we
[1:52:00] look at these things and you say oh oh
[1:52:02] brother Brooks listen here was a unit
[1:52:06] and as they went on their way they judge
[1:52:09] now I explained these things to me see
[1:52:12] what was the declaring his generation so
[1:52:14] here was this man who didn't know
[1:52:16] nothing about God or even knew what was
[1:52:19] happening in Jerusalem or what had
[1:52:23] happened and God said but he's one of
[1:52:27] mine and he stopped the revival and said
[1:52:33] go Philip over here what it feels I
[1:52:38] don't even know how I'm gonna get there
[1:52:39] guys they don't worry about it I know
[1:52:44] chariot and he sees this this angel this
[1:52:49] fellow walking out of the desert with no
[1:52:51] chariot he ain't burnt by the Sun he
[1:52:59] don't look like he's thirsty
[1:53:00] but he's ready to preach he catches up
[1:53:04] with the man where God had already
[1:53:06] worked on the other end where he can
[1:53:09] easily preach Jesus to it now tell me
[1:53:12] that if that ain't God see what I'm
[1:53:14] saying when God needs you he needs you
[1:53:17] and God would provide away even when
[1:53:20] Jonah amen wouldn't go to Nineveh he
[1:53:23] missed his boat and God took away home
[1:53:27] why cuz nobody could do it like Jonah
[1:53:31] nobody can take your place you know
[1:53:38] answered Philip and said I pray thee of
[1:53:41] whom speaking the prophets this of
[1:53:44] himself or some other man then Philip
[1:53:46] opened his mouth and began at that same
[1:53:49] Scripture and preached unto Him Jesus
[1:53:52] and as they went on their way they came
[1:53:55] into a certain water and the eunuch said
[1:53:58] see here is water what doth hinder me to
[1:54:02] be baptized hallelujah and Philip took a
[1:54:10] cup and sprinkled him and Philip said if
[1:54:20] thou believest with all thine heart thou
[1:54:23] man and he answered and said I believe
[1:54:26] that Jesus Christ is the son of God and
[1:54:30] he commanded the chariot to stand still
[1:54:33] and they went down both into the water
[1:54:35] both Philip and the eunuch and he was
[1:54:38] baptized one more scripture in closing
[1:54:48] God's voice always calls his sheep from
[1:54:55] the big
[1:54:57] of time the Bible said when then has
[1:54:59] sinned even in Eden Adam Adam says Lord
[1:55:05] the Bible said the voice of God walked
[1:55:08] in the cool of the evening it was the
[1:55:11] voice of God
[1:55:12] it said Adam Adam where art thou you
[1:55:18] understand that's why Jesus said amen he
[1:55:21] says I am The Good Shepherd and know my
[1:55:23] sheep and I am known of mine as the
[1:55:27] father knows me even so know I the
[1:55:30] father and I lay down my life for the
[1:55:32] Sheep right so you understand the voice
[1:55:37] claims you when you hear the voice you
[1:55:41] have to follow the voice and you don't
[1:55:43] doesn't mean you understand why are you
[1:55:45] following them but something is making
[1:55:47] you follow him when he went over to
[1:55:49] Matthew Matthew long knew whoever come
[1:55:53] come come even the people who said Lord
[1:55:56] can I follow he says no I have to call
[1:55:59] you right and you look at these things
[1:56:05] and you say well what do you mean see
[1:56:06] that's what the duck voice does in the
[1:56:08] evening if it did it in the evening of
[1:56:11] Adam it doesn't and I evening it's
[1:56:14] always the voice God has a voice and
[1:56:19] that voice I don't care where you are
[1:56:22] it's going to find you that voice knew
[1:56:28] that there will be a woman at the well
[1:56:32] never have we've heard a man speak like
[1:56:34] this before but we know that when the
[1:56:37] Messiah has come eat show well something
[1:56:42] exploded in her she went to Runyon I
[1:56:47] don't know honey but you quit your job
[1:56:51] to follow this man and you don't know
[1:56:52] who he is I don't know but I know I came
[1:56:55] here myself
[1:56:56] is that different from Abraham I heard
[1:57:00] his voice you mean to tell me you ain't
[1:57:03] got no image ain't no statue that we can
[1:57:05] see that can show us what he looked like
[1:57:07] all I know is I heard his voice and it's
[1:57:10] a nun
[1:57:11] in God and I know the one I'm following
[1:57:14] he is God see that voice will always
[1:57:18] like even in this age there many people
[1:57:21] can hear the tapes and never catch
[1:57:27] because my sheep hear my voice don't get
[1:57:30] discourage if they can't hear what you
[1:57:33] hear
[1:57:34] I don't hear no Kentuckian there's
[1:57:38] something more powerful than that like I
[1:57:43] say it's a voice in a voice and you tell
[1:57:47] me that God don't want you to be saved
[1:57:49] when God didn't put that same voice in
[1:57:52] book full of an old tapes he going them
[1:57:55] farther than he's ever gone in any age
[1:57:58] to save men hmm and no matter how he
[1:58:04] tried to shut it down that voice have
[1:58:06] traveled all over the world America
[1:58:09] don't have to give it a count for what
[1:58:11] she's done
[1:58:13] but in the mystery at all there's still
[1:58:16] that little remnant that seed of God
[1:58:20] that refuses to hear someone else's
[1:58:25] voice oh let me tell you something I
[1:58:29] know everybody here all cuddled up but
[1:58:31] let me tell you something I spend my
[1:58:33] time listening to the prophets voice
[1:58:38] ain't got no idols and I just don't
[1:58:44] believe it I just feel like well I ain't
[1:58:46] gonna you know that but let me say like
[1:58:48] these people of God you have other
[1:58:50] choice you and I ought to be so happy it
[1:58:54] ain't based upon our righteousness the
[1:58:58] thing that makes me sad is when I make
[1:59:00] him sad when I know I've done wrong
[1:59:03] that's what makes me sad but when it
[1:59:05] comes to my salvation I'm not sad hey
[1:59:09] you know you know if I woulda coulda no
[1:59:12] sir
[1:59:13] I have other sure runs yeah I can't
[1:59:17] explain it
[1:59:18] all I know is in my heart that's all I
[1:59:23] know how it got that Brotherhood I don't
[1:59:25] know how he put it there brother Babel
[1:59:28] said if you can explain him he ain't God
[1:59:29] to you
[1:59:30] you can't explain God I can't explain
[1:59:33] why these messages give me joy I can't
[1:59:35] explain when God quicken things to me to
[1:59:37] say and I say oh I can't explain it and
[1:59:40] as I'm saying that I'm earned learning
[1:59:42] and understanding I can't explain it
[1:59:45] you say well that ain't right yes it is
[1:59:47] because you know when it came to the
[1:59:49] Prophet
[1:59:50] Robert God had not studied the serpent
[1:59:52] seed yet while he was on the
[1:59:55] investigation of somebody kind of
[1:59:56] critiquing or what was it what was it he
[1:59:58] said all of a sudden he said that's the
[2:00:00] serpent that was spontaneous
[2:00:04] at that hour don't think about what
[2:00:06] you're gonna say and he said the serpent
[2:00:09] being God broke it up into him like it
[2:00:11] were y'all I've never seen him here on
[2:00:16] the tape he's reading the scripture all
[2:00:18] of a sudden the revelation bright oh he
[2:00:20] said yeah that's it that's it
[2:00:23] fresh fruit fresh anointing fresh
[2:00:25] revelation to the property himself y'all
[2:00:30] let's don't listen I don't know but I've
[2:00:35] seen it I've seen things break to him on
[2:00:37] the tape and he just oh there it is
[2:00:39] there it is he had it but he didn't
[2:00:42] didn't see the scripture for you and
[2:00:46] that's how it is it's by revelation I
[2:00:49] can't prove to you that brother Branham
[2:00:51] is the prophet of this age but I know he
[2:00:53] is I can go through all the scriptures
[2:00:55] and maybe you can find out some things
[2:00:57] about him that discredit his ministry I
[2:00:59] don't know how you do that but I thought
[2:01:01] about Billy Graham and I don't mean no
[2:01:03] harm no disrespect to the man that's a
[2:01:05] bit of a wedding for brother Branham
[2:01:06] there wouldn't have been a Billy Graham
[2:01:09] but nobody mentioned his name it was
[2:01:13] that prophet that God used to spark the
[2:01:15] revival in America but nobody mentioned
[2:01:19] his name you understand me
[2:01:22] see what it is because we are not in
[2:01:24] Laodicea they put us out and they didn't
[2:01:29] understand
[2:01:29] when they was closing the door to
[2:01:30] william branham they was closing the
[2:01:32] door to jesus christ y'all hear me be
[2:01:38] assured about your salvation
[2:01:40] stop being wishy-washy and letting the
[2:01:42] devil teach you all kinds of way you
[2:01:44] know what i'm going through my my tires
[2:01:46] too but at the end of the day God
[2:01:47] brought me back up he just yeah he won't
[2:01:50] let me stay he just won't let me
[2:01:53] he's you know I you know I don't he just
[2:02:02] won't let me stay he keeps giving me joy
[2:02:06] every time it looked like it it's
[2:02:08] impossible he makes it possible
[2:02:11] oh yo y'all know what I'm talking about
[2:02:15] that's there well I'm gonna mope and
[2:02:18] groan and you know Behrman complain
[2:02:20] that's what Israel did and all of that
[2:02:23] is because of unbelief I can't make you
[2:02:25] believe you know how can we believe what
[2:02:31] Satan says and won't believe what God
[2:02:33] says huh
[2:02:37] listen listen the man who was born blind
[2:02:40] thirty years he said I've been blind on
[2:02:42] I've been blind I never seen so if
[2:02:45] you've had a demon for thirty years
[2:02:46] that don't mean you can't be delivered
[2:02:48] cuz honest is a disease a demon scuse me
[2:02:52] and he was delivered or I was I'd never
[2:02:54] seen before so what have you had this
[2:02:56] that it doesn't make no difference how
[2:02:57] long word ever been with you or demos
[2:03:00] you still ain't in the will of God into
[2:03:03] God God's Word came to deliver I don't
[2:03:07] care who you are God's Word came to
[2:03:11] deliver and if till God tell me no I'm
[2:03:15] not gonna give you that deliverance
[2:03:17] I'll keep knocking till I'm delivered in
[2:03:21] making sense there was one lady there in
[2:03:24] Brenham Tabernacle who never got out of
[2:03:26] the wheelchair and to be honest with you
[2:03:28] I don't think she wanted to because that
[2:03:30] was a testimony that even though I'm
[2:03:34] crippled I still love the Lord
[2:03:40] have been prayed for but God never gave
[2:03:42] it delivers why it was his will that she
[2:03:45] be there and at the same time he comes
[2:03:47] in here Upshaw God do it worked with
[2:03:54] whoever he wants to with people of God
[2:03:55] one thing for certain you cannot make
[2:03:58] heaven without faith you can and
[2:04:02] understand that's what happened to the
[2:04:05] children Israel they kept Merman they
[2:04:07] kept complaining kept learning kept
[2:04:08] complaining and God at one point I'm
[2:04:11] saying that's enough
[2:04:12] I wouldn't let no devil in hell
[2:04:17] make me believe I'm a devil in hell
[2:04:19] Bauer absolutely not
[2:04:21] I don't care if I stole something
[2:04:25] yesterday I'm still the son of God y'all
[2:04:28] may not understand and I know some of
[2:04:30] y'all don't understand what I just said
[2:04:32] but I Know Who I am
[2:04:35] hallelujah hey and if I was to steal
[2:04:38] something guess what it would more than
[2:04:40] likely be food because I'm stealing to
[2:04:43] be home if I'm hungry
[2:04:45] y'all homes that's what David said Lord
[2:04:46] don't make me don't make me so hungry
[2:04:48] that I gotta steal and they said David

[2:06:13] got so much to be thankful for Lord we
[2:06:16] come down to the end of the road lord I
[2:06:20] know translation is nearby but the
[2:06:24] question you ask even to your disciples
[2:06:27] when the Son of Man comes shall he find
[2:06:29] the faith that's what he's looking for
[2:06:32] Lord not so much it works that we must
[2:06:36] do but the faith in him that he can do
[2:06:38] it and I say to you to the people of God
[2:06:41] is there anything too hard for God Lord
[2:06:45] I pray father that you give us grace to
[2:06:47] die to our will so we can accept your
[2:06:51] will be merciful now in your name Jesus
[2:06:54] Christ we pray amen when I think about
[2:07:00] wheels I think about that widdle woman

[2:07:06] really don't want to be a widow and I
[2:07:07] don't even understand why God you
[2:07:11] understand me

[2:07:14] didn't why she trusted God he knew you
[2:07:21] should have a new bed out of - there
[2:07:23] people in jail save it and ones that
[2:07:25] lost saved and some of us out here got
[2:07:28] more God in them than some of us guy yet
[2:07:31] they locked up in jail telling that we
[2:07:35] look at them and old Pope fellas they
[2:07:37] still in jail hey Dana in jail if they
[2:07:40] got God they free probably more freer
[2:07:44] than us they trust in God in the prison
[2:07:47] house but they know if they don't
[2:07:49] anything could happen
[2:07:58] and thank you for all of Judah Lord
