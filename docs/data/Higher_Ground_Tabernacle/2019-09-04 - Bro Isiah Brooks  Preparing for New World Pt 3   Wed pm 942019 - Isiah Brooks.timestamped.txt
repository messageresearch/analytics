[10:40] Hey
[10:42] man just that word Reedy is such a
[10:48] powerful word we're going to get right
[10:51] into the Word of God we appreciate our
[10:55] musicians we appreciate everybody being
[10:57] here tonight West that you would turn
[11:05] with us to second Thessalonians two we
[11:15] started on preparing for in the world we
[11:19] haven't finished that thought we just
[11:21] kind of want to give a little more
[11:25] thought to that and I trust by God's
[11:29] grace that he would bless us tonight
[11:31] that we'll see basically how blessed we
[11:35] are
[11:36] second Thessalonians please appreciate
[11:43] our Lord Jesus Christ for being so
[11:47] faithful to us
[11:50] second Thessalonians a second chapter
[11:53] we'll begin reading at the first verse
[11:57] finally brethren sorry
[12:01] no chapter now we beseech you brethren
[12:04] by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[12:07] and by our gathering together unto Him
[12:11] that you be not soon shaken in mind or
[12:14] be troubled neither by spirit nor by
[12:18] word nor by letter as from us as that
[12:22] that day of Christ is at hand let no man
[12:28] deceive you by any means for that day
[12:32] shall not come except there come a
[12:36] falling away first and that man of sin
[12:39] is be revealed the son of perdition
[12:44] let us pray father God we thank you for
[12:47] your grace we thank you for your mercy
[12:50] we thank you for being so good to us
[12:54] Lord you have
[12:56] been better to us and we've been to
[12:57] ourselves we pray on tonight that your
[13:01] perfect will be done break and destroy
[13:04] the yokes of the enemy God we realize we
[13:08] are living in the last days and Father
[13:12] we see your coming as our prophet would
[13:16] say we see the dust in the distance and
[13:19] father we standing there Lord in the
[13:22] door waiting and ready because you
[13:26] promised us Lord and though others may
[13:29] not be able to understand our position
[13:33] in you father we know because you spoke
[13:38] to our hearts
[13:39] you called us individually and father we
[13:43] said yes to your proposal and the Lord
[13:46] we thank your father because we know
[13:49] that you are God that keeps all of his
[13:52] promises blessed law tonight in a
[13:55] special way in Jesus Christ's name we
[13:58] pray amen
[13:59] you may be seated as we started our
[14:07] thought by God's grace we started it
[14:13] with the the very thought in fact that
[14:18] we're living in a day that has been
[14:22] prophesied to come when this prophecy
[14:26] has been moving some four thousand maybe
[14:32] six thousand years but no matter how
[14:37] long it takes for it to come to pass we
[14:42] realized that God will always vindicate
[14:44] his word
[14:46] we're living in what we would call a
[14:49] world of death brother Branham said that
[14:53] the moment a child takes his breath in
[14:56] this world he begins to die and we are
[15:01] in ourselves physically dying
[15:08] but the thing is we die to live this is
[15:13] just not the only stopping place but
[15:18] there's another world and we are headed
[15:22] toward that world the gospel came to
[15:27] prepare us for that world
[15:30] that's why Jesus Christ told Nicodemus
[15:33] you must be born again he said that
[15:37] which is a flesh is flesh and that which
[15:39] is of spirit is spirit
[15:41] don't marvel at this new doctrine you
[15:47] must be born again and I fear that in
[15:51] our community there are so many people
[15:57] who are not preparing the people what
[16:02] good will it do you if you learn all the
[16:04] religious acts all of the doctrines and
[16:09] do everything right and miss heaven we
[16:15] have understood that there was a rich
[16:18] young ruler he came to Jesus and said
[16:22] good master how can i inherit heaven and
[16:30] brother branham said he asked in a way
[16:35] because he had been so used to rules
[16:38] laws and regulations and he was good at
[16:43] it because every question that Jesus
[16:46] asked this man he said I've done these
[16:50] things in other words he was a
[16:53] perfectionist I've done this even from
[16:56] my youth and the Bible says that Jesus
[17:00] loved him the saddest part about that is
[17:06] that when Jesus came to ask him to give
[17:10] up the thing that was most valuable to
[17:12] him he was not willing to give it up you
[17:19] see God is a discerner of the heart
[17:22] no matter how we appear to be on the
[17:25] outside God see every dark spot and
[17:29] that's one thing about the Word of God
[17:32] it goes and it penetrates and it
[17:36] separates the spirit the soul the joint
[17:40] the marrow and it goes right down to
[17:45] where something could be hiding ha ha
[17:49] he's a secret agent man you know he
[17:54] knows how to investigate he knows how to
[17:57] look in places nobody else can see and
[18:01] he can find the very problem see that's
[18:05] that's why that's why the preaching of
[18:07] the gospel is so important because the
[18:11] preaching of the gospel will we'll find
[18:13] you out even when you think you hiding
[18:17] God pulls the cover off
[18:20] the saddest thing is that a lot of times
[18:23] the people don't want to surrender even
[18:26] when God exposes them it grieves me to
[18:31] know that it's so difficult to see
[18:34] people in a state of repentance now
[18:38] crying is can be the beginning but
[18:42] because people shared tears doesn't mean
[18:45] that they are repenting I have seen so
[18:49] many times even even people just really
[18:52] booing but they're crying because
[18:56] they're like a child please don't take
[18:59] my candy from me don't take my toy away
[19:05] and see God knows that and so he knows
[19:11] that he can't give them what he desired
[19:14] to give them until they're ready to
[19:17] surrender we're preparing for a new
[19:23] world that rich young ruler wasn't able
[19:26] to give it up and he continued his like
[19:29] guess what
[19:30] and God continued to bless him one thing
[19:33] about the laws of God
[19:36] you don't have to be a Christian in
[19:39] order for those laws to be effective you
[19:45] can be a sinner and yet believe the word
[19:48] and the word will work on your behalf
[19:51] because it is a law and we find out
[19:58] because he didn't give it up
[20:01] we find him on the next side of the
[20:03] pages ready to retire have been blessed
[20:09] by God barns are full and I'm not gonna
[20:15] spend much more time on this but he he
[20:18] forgot he forgot that God had dealt with
[20:22] him before he wanted eternal life and he
[20:27] forgot he passed it by see this life
[20:30] life is temporal
[20:32] remember God even gave this rich young
[20:36] ruler a second chance
[20:38] he put Lazarus right by his steps
[20:43] hallelujah if he had only blessed
[20:46] Lazarus he would have inherit eternal
[20:49] life if you give the released of these a
[20:54] drink of water in my name see there's a
[20:58] reward and we find out that Lazarus the
[21:02] rich young ruler was so blind to his
[21:06] success he paid no attention to God's
[21:11] grace and it was Lazarus who the rich
[21:18] young ruler saw in the bosom of Abraham
[21:21] after he died and where was he see his
[21:26] religion didn't prepare him his religion
[21:30] owner prepared him how to live in the
[21:32] way of how to live in this life million
[21:37] Christians so-called ah you can't put a
[21:40] thing on their life and they've done
[21:43] everything right but
[21:47] they haven't been born again that's the
[21:50] criteria you must be born again flesh
[21:54] and blood cannot inter well always
[21:58] somebody help me here but there was
[22:00] another rich young ruler his name was
[22:04] Moses and the whole time his mom tried
[22:08] to tell him
[22:09] you're going to be a deliverer and Moses
[22:12] liked the idea of being a slaves son
[22:20] because the Bible tells us that Moses
[22:23] resists the idea of being the son of
[22:28] Pharaoh's daughter watch this now
[22:31] because his eyes was focused ejup every
[22:35] Kingdom every Kingdom and I'm telling
[22:37] myself it's got to fall there's only one
[22:40] kingdom that cannot fall and will not
[22:45] solve and that is the kingdom of God and
[22:48] the problems that the kingdom of God
[22:50] cannot ensure not ever be moved and what
[22:55] is the kingdom of God
[22:56] joy peace righteousness in the Holy
[23:00] Ghost hmm hallelujah see people if they
[23:10] just understood everything is a
[23:12] preparation things God could just snap
[23:15] it into being just like that but if you
[23:18] see by God's way of doing things in the
[23:21] book of Genesis you'll see that God
[23:23] moved at his own pace
[23:27] he could have said let there be and
[23:30] everything could just pop pop pop pop
[23:32] pop but it didn't work that way God
[23:34] moved in his own pace
[23:36] cuz garden is not of God of anxiety he's
[23:41] not he's never ancient hallelujah
[23:44] those are not attributes of God God is
[23:48] soul if I could put it this way laid out
[23:51] or laid back time is in his hands he's
[23:55] not in the hands of time he regulates
[23:59] everything
[24:00] so he he does it when he wants to even
[24:03] though it may seem like he's late to us
[24:05] God is always on time
[24:07] so anyway the Lord said I go to prepare
[24:11] a place for you the where I am there you
[24:13] may be also and he's talking to his
[24:16] disciples and it's been how many years
[24:20] thousands of years now over 2,000 years
[24:23] he told him I'm going to prepare a place
[24:26] for you that where I am there you may be
[24:29] also
[24:30] and according to the scripture of
[24:31] thousand years as one day so two days
[24:35] ago God has built a city in two days and
[24:43] he says I'm going to prepare a place for
[24:44] you that where I am there you may be
[24:47] also now understand in the future home
[24:51] where the rhythm tells us how God
[24:53] prepares the place hallelujah
[24:57] it must be justified it had to be
[25:02] sanctified it had to come to a place is
[25:05] that right because remember when Adam
[25:07] failed everything failed hallelujah the
[25:12] heavens and the earth fail we always
[25:15] look at the earth but understand heaven
[25:19] fell - that's why he's got to renew
[25:21] everything there's more than one heaven
[25:24] you know but I'm talking about the
[25:26] heaven that Adam was controlling you
[25:29] know that Adam control the atmosphere he
[25:35] controlled everything hallelujah in and
[25:39] everything that affected the earth Adam
[25:41] controlled it but the fall he lost it
[25:45] hallelujah let's go on so we must
[25:48] understand there was a preparation
[25:50] justification sanctification baptism of
[25:53] the Holy Ghost and understand the New
[25:56] Jerusalem was so homey it could not come
[25:59] down until this earth had received its
[26:02] fire baptism hello Jesus can't even
[26:08] touch the earth until this earth has
[26:12] received its fire baptism
[26:15] hallelujah therefore Jesus can't come in
[26:18] and dwell is king in your heart until it
[26:22] receives its fire baptism hello and
[26:28] there are so many people who don't who
[26:31] don't who don't want to go there but in
[26:35] order to see Jesus face in peace you got
[26:38] to go there as I said we are living in a
[26:43] world of death everything's death
[26:46] everything in order to live everything
[26:48] has to die some got a diet for you to
[26:50] live right corn wheat whatever it is
[26:54] beat it doesn't matter it has to die
[26:57] showing it is just evidence of what the
[27:02] world was it's a truth that we must see
[27:06] that God is life hallelujah and so we
[27:11] were born into this world we were born
[27:13] into what's in there I've said it a
[27:16] mother we were conceived in iniquity you
[27:21] understand me and in seeing our mothers
[27:23] can shaken iniquity excuse me and then
[27:26] seeing our mothers concede us is that
[27:29] right
[27:29] so because of what he did I'm coming to
[27:33] this because of what she did and Adam
[27:35] don't get me wrong she became the mother
[27:38] of death come on man born of a woman
[27:44] what he does what died but first you got
[27:48] to remember when God gave Adam and Eve
[27:51] her name weren't Eden it was Adam one
[27:56] body and two in one male and female and
[28:02] God to Adam Adam be fruitful and
[28:06] multiply and Adam at the spoken word
[28:10] heat and I'm going over this because
[28:12] remember I told you last the other
[28:14] service he had the spoken word and God
[28:18] gave him the Commission to reproduce and
[28:23] the second Adam wasn't even there
[28:28] but you gotta understand before we can
[28:32] ever be raptured we needed a man that
[28:37] consists of male and female he was the
[28:40] second but the first Adam was natural
[28:46] and he failed naturally the second Adam
[28:52] is what the Lord Himself a quickening
[28:56] spirit at what is Easter over Darla is
[29:00] that right
[29:01] he's Elohim and at the same time he's El
[29:04] Shaddai the breasted one hallelujah so
[29:10] that we can understand Adam was to speak
[29:13] and the children was to be formed out of
[29:16] the dust of the earth but they were not
[29:19] to be babies
[29:21] there'll be no babies in heaven there be
[29:25] no babies in the new world
[29:28] hallelujah the first Adam he meant was
[29:32] to bring them forth like God brought
[29:34] forth come on somebody
[29:37] he can't you get it but the brown said
[29:39] when God created the first Adam he
[29:42] created him spiritually and he create
[29:44] all of his children do you think God are
[29:48] creating the orphanage now or do you
[29:50] think they were there before and Adams
[29:56] job was to call for them and they will
[29:59] be fall from the dust of the earth just
[30:01] like the first Adam I'm going to prove
[30:03] I'm going to prove that Jesus Christ the
[30:05] same yesterday today and forever he
[30:07] cannot change so I was showing you by
[30:12] God's grace how are we preparing for
[30:14] this new world who feel like shall in
[30:18] the god this is why when the sons of God
[30:21] died in this body
[30:25] they can't die in the theophany
[30:28] so when they die they go back to the
[30:31] theophany
[30:33] body that the oppening body was hindered
[30:37] because of the fall when the bottom said
[30:40] when seeing came in
[30:41] we bypass our theophany and we came into
[30:46] this world to suffer death and all the
[30:52] fruits that comes with death hallelujah
[30:55] but God's Word could not come back void
[30:58] so that's why he said I have never loved
[31:01] lost one why because the theophany
[31:03] cannot be lost
[31:08] hallelujah he said when you hear this
[31:12] message you have what her from your
[31:14] theophany that means you've existed
[31:17] you were there Paul saw he is and he
[31:21] said though this earthly telling us to
[31:23] be dissolved I have what I have a
[31:25] building waiting for me so all of these
[31:32] all of the seeds yearns of God when they
[31:35] died at the beginning they died they
[31:38] died they died look like they were in
[31:39] the grave and just like can they ever
[31:41] come back will they ever come back I see
[31:44] everything come back but will these this
[31:46] man come back Joe didn't understand but
[31:50] there's a call it is hard to see what
[31:53] would happen to a man when we've died
[31:56] and God sent him through it and only has
[32:01] she as I said on the as she with all the
[32:06] sacrifices he was making all the bird
[32:09] sacrifices
[32:10] it was there God show Joel the
[32:13] resurrection the man died yet shall he
[32:20] live come on somebody in stir truth
[32:25] prove it on Mount Transfiguration there
[32:29] was Moses and Elijah who had been dead
[32:33] for hundreds of years in this dimension
[32:37] but over there even the Witch of Endor
[32:44] when she wanted to talk to Samuel saw
[32:49] had to call him up and there was Samuel
[32:52] in its prophetic robe hallelujah
[32:55] showing that there was another world
[32:58] another world hallelujah in everybody
[33:08] that was a part of that other world
[33:10] amen somehow in their day in their
[33:13] generation called the revelation of the
[33:16] blood they knew in order to get back
[33:21] over cross this chasm I needed somebody
[33:24] to stand in my place and all they had
[33:27] was Lambs
[33:28] but one day the real am the real Lamb of
[33:34] God I'm coming the real Lamb of God came
[33:38] and to show and to prove he was a real
[33:41] lamb when he died on the cross and said
[33:44] it was finished the Bible said he
[33:46] descended into the lower regions and he
[33:50] started with the days of Noah hallelujah
[33:54] come on somebody and he preached the
[33:57] gospel and his question was why did not
[34:00] you believe Noah Noah snow was very
[34:07] shocked was a type of Christ there was
[34:10] only one door one way I don't care how
[34:16] many religions they were in that world
[34:18] there was only one way in order to be
[34:23] saved you had to believe Noah's gospel
[34:26] and there was only one door God didn't
[34:30] have no back door if you got in the ark
[34:34] you had to come in the front door
[34:36] hallelujah
[34:37] if you got any off all the people around
[34:40] you had to see you go in y'all
[34:42] understand me is like that kids when
[34:44] you're baptized you're not supposed to
[34:46] do it in a secret it ought to be a
[34:48] witness day hey somebody help me here
[34:55] and when Jesus went down into paradise
[34:58] he said boys I know you waited you died
[35:02] in faith how do you know he said that
[35:04] because Hebrew says it
[35:05] they all died in faith not having
[35:08] received
[35:08] the promise but they knew the promise
[35:11] was still there
[35:12] hallelujah so the promise sir came down
[35:16] and knocked on the door hallelujah and
[35:19] said boys it's time to get up out of
[35:21] here by the blood of Jesus has already
[35:24] been shed I got a better place for you
[35:29] so paradise was done away with did you
[35:34] know that it was done away with because
[35:36] the sinner and the saint could see each
[35:39] other
[35:41] hallelujah that doesn't it hey bruh ham
[35:44] I mean the rich young ruler could see
[35:47] see our Lazarus and Lazarus could see
[35:50] and God said no no no no we got to do
[35:52] something we're going to do a better
[35:53] thing we're gonna set it so you'll never
[35:56] see this why hallelujah
[36:00] heaven must be heaven and hell must be
[36:04] hell and when the true blood of Jesus
[36:07] Christ came it's separated it say what
[36:15] are you talking about further words let
[36:19] me let me put it this way so what
[36:20] happened we preparing now but understand
[36:24] this ain't that this ain't this ain't
[36:26] the final place hallelujah is that right
[36:32] what the souls under the altar in the
[36:35] Book of Revelations is crying out Lord
[36:37] how long how long will you avenge us of
[36:42] our adversaries hello some honey amen
[36:47] brother Brown said even in you'll be
[36:48] opening he said you can you can't eat
[36:51] neither do you sleep while you say that
[36:58] brother Brooks because you don't breathe
[37:00] the breath of life was only given in
[37:03] this dimension see God don't breathe
[37:08] only when he's feeling you
[37:14] he blows because breath is time they
[37:19] don't know that time and once that stop
[37:24] your time is over hallelujah also you
[37:31] and I must understand they're in the
[37:34] theophany you don't have to worry about
[37:35] getting tired you and I get tired
[37:38] because we give out of oxygen not there
[37:43] God is your life and when you and I come
[37:49] to a place you and I must understand
[37:52] that they're there but they say law I
[37:55] enjoy eating yeah come on somebody you
[38:01] know God enjoy eating that was one of
[38:06] the first thing he taught Adam and Eve I
[38:09] want you to know there's a great
[38:11] pleasure in this thing eating Oh what
[38:19] happened when Abraham and conquered the
[38:23] first thing he did was have a feast
[38:28] every victory he said leave me some lame
[38:31] out there make when we conquer and
[38:38] overcome this world what we do we go sit
[38:42] at the Welcome Table and we eat look in
[38:47] the Book of Revelations you'll find out
[38:49] that there are fruits that would be
[38:51] eaten when Jesus rose from the dead in
[38:58] his glorified body
[38:59] he said go give me some fish and bread
[39:04] see that's why Christians like the eat
[39:06] see it's something about that oh let me
[39:10] move on my god grace there's a better
[39:13] place and God is preparing us for it
[39:16] don't miss it people don't miss it
[39:19] because every Kingdom you see here must
[39:23] fall that right
[39:26] how it was it has always been even in
[39:29] denny's that I saw stone hewn out of the
[39:32] mountain and that throw was riding
[39:34] rolling down to Babylon what was it
[39:36] doing crushing every kingdom I'm telling
[39:42] you this headstone kingdom will crush
[39:45] every kingdom who this is the kingdom of
[39:51] Jesus Christ this is the one he's
[39:54] building hallelujah
[39:58] is that right he's building that's why
[40:03] he's working on you let go and let God
[40:08] like job said if I perish I'm sorry like
[40:11] Esther said if I perish let me perish
[40:14] I'm going to see the king and job said
[40:18] though he slay me yeah I'll trust him
[40:21] why we are not of this world
[40:25] hallelujah that's what Jesus was trying
[40:27] to tell us we are not of this world we
[40:31] are of a different civilization come on
[40:34] somebody
[40:35] he made us priests and kings why because
[40:39] in the beginning we were priests in
[40:40] Kings just giving a message every
[40:49] Kingdom has to give way but the man who
[40:52] says in God's provided place of worship
[40:53] he said the woman Eve was the tree of
[40:57] death we all taste of her being born in
[41:00] this world and as sure as we're born of
[41:03] a woman will gut we've got to die and as
[41:07] sure as we're born of the man Jesus
[41:09] Christ will live forever
[41:12] see that's what I was getting o folk
[41:13] getting to to you because when God
[41:16] brought the birth of the church it was
[41:20] by a man hello woman had nothing to do
[41:24] with it
[41:25] it was by a man you're pulling again by
[41:29] who Christ Jesus hallelujah when they
[41:33] pierced him in the side it was at that
[41:35] point water and blood came out
[41:38] it was at that time when everything had
[41:41] been basically conquered she came forth
[41:43] but she had to suffer everything he
[41:48] suffered in order to overcome so don't
[41:53] tell me you can't overcome because if
[41:56] you were in him you've already done it
[41:58] you did it when he did it honey
[42:05] oh come on somebody see what we must
[42:08] understand is that the devil as long as
[42:11] he can get you to believe you don't have
[42:13] the Holy Ghost he's got you lit Wow
[42:17] it's a Pentecostal theology thing that
[42:20] you got you got a jerk you got a jump
[42:22] you got a shout all people of God you
[42:24] don't have to do none of that what you
[42:26] have to do is live the life of Christ
[42:30] all of that is good I like it but that
[42:34] is not a criteria hallelujah come on
[42:38] somebody you must realize that even in a
[42:41] day and then when Moses brought the
[42:43] children of Israel out of Egypt who was
[42:45] out there playing that Camry even
[42:47] playing the tambourine don't guarantee
[42:49] you Miriam was out there shouting
[42:54] dancing Moses saying a brand new song
[42:56] they had a glorious time and I don't
[43:02] even know the percentage they were
[43:05] Devils because that generation did not
[43:11] make it except for to the understand
[43:15] what I'm saying so that you can
[43:17] understand when God told Adam to
[43:19] replenish the earth when God told Adam
[43:25] to replenish the earth who did it the
[43:28] Serpent's that's why he could kill them
[43:31] all with God told Joshua and all of him
[43:36] go ahead and kill everything what was he
[43:38] saying they're not mine and they've been
[43:42] set here to keep you from the promise
[43:46] every ight well as Jimmy's ice here
[43:51] types
[43:52] whatever the ice are they are there
[43:55] stationed as warriors to stop you from
[44:00] making it to the promised land
[44:02] oh come on somebody you wonder how come
[44:06] you end up in places you don't know why
[44:08] you're there and so somehow some habit
[44:12] catches you
[44:14] it was stationed there it was waiting on
[44:18] you
[44:20] hallelujah but Paul said we are more
[44:23] than overcometh we're more than
[44:26] conquerors but gods facing things there
[44:30] in your life for you to battle but he's
[44:32] expecting you to overcome it halle-loo
[44:38] is that right oh he told the children of
[44:40] israil he said listen all in the
[44:42] promised land Oh milk and honey you tell
[44:44] him all the good stuff hallelujah it's
[44:48] like when you get mad you see all the
[44:50] good stuff you'll see all the bad stuff
[44:53] oh but it's there hallelujah but the
[45:00] truth of the matter is he didn't tell
[45:02] him there were giants over there and he

[45:36] school and I've got all my muscles
[45:37] struck you know I didn't know they
[45:40] understood that their God was God
[45:42] hallelujah and if God sent us here to
[45:46] defeat them we shall and will defeat
[45:48] them what was these giants compared to
[45:52] Egypt who he was the greatest force ever
[45:59] hallelujah greater than Russia
[46:03] hallelujah and God sent down
[46:05] one man invasion hallelujah that's what

[50:31] of the beast come on somebody
[50:36] remember the Lambs never had a name it
[50:42] was no name
[50:43] they were just Lambs but God gained this
[50:49] lamb thou shalt call his name Jesus and
[50:53] he shall save his people from their sins
[50:58] hey I lost somebody see people think I'm
[51:01] crazy no sir when Peter think about it
[51:04] God used a man called Peter who had the
[51:06] hardest temper of all the disciples
[51:09] ready to fight every time you look
[51:12] around he's he's in trouble and God told
[51:17] Peter he said before the crow three
[51:20] times Peter you will deny me all the
[51:22] horn no I would not I would die for you
[51:24] and all of us have that testimony but
[51:28] until you get the Holy Ghost
[51:30] you have failed just like Peter you
[51:34] can't stand up to this world and the
[51:37] pressure those demons without the Holy

[55:21] of it look where we are now God had made
[55:25] it so simple don't do this don't eat up
[55:31] this tree
[55:32] don't do it how complicated can that get
[55:35] but when you allow the devil to come in
[55:39] and just get in you what let me ask you
[55:42] something is Paul a prophet was Paul the
[55:45] prophet and Paul says you can understand
[55:49] all mysteries you can move mountains you
[55:53] can give all that you have to feed the
[55:55] poor and you have not charity you don't
[55:59] have a covenant with God
[56:00] it profits you nothing without dividing
[56:04] up you can forget it and what is divine
[56:07] love the Holy Ghost in you somebody help
[56:11] me here what do you say I'm telling
[56:13] people that we're wasting our time and
[56:16] that was the enemy's purpose he said he
[56:20] said Nathan and Cora among us he had the
[56:23] people who worship II he had to keep the
[56:25] a they were toughening what but the
[56:27] prophecy and listen
[56:29] they forgot where they were headed none
[56:32] of the characters changed hello and
[56:37] according to Deuteronomy God says I
[56:40] brought you in the wilderness to try you
[56:43] to test you so that you could see what
[56:49] was in your heart
[56:50] hmm all your tests and trials are calm
[56:54] is come to - what test you to see what's
[56:59] in your heart
[57:02] hallelujah when you find yourself
[57:05] murmuring and complaining that's not
[57:09] what God want to hear and all things
[57:11] give that
[57:13] hallelujah whether you understand it or
[57:17] not the Bible said all things work
[57:19] together come on somebody when you go
[57:24] through a trial don't you know it had to
[57:26] be God that the devil had to get
[57:28] permission he can't just do with you
[57:31] what he wants to he's got to ask cuz it
[57:36] go ahead on but I know they'll never
[57:38] deny me hallelujah no matter what you
[57:42] see them through their spear stay y'all
[57:46] understand me oh let me hurry up here
[57:49] see you must understand you got to tell
[57:51] the dealer this you got to say listen
[57:53] devil
[57:53] I didn't choose God he chose me and God
[57:57] doesn't make a mistake don't look at me
[57:59] like I'm a mistake don't you look at
[58:03] yourself like you some mistake God chose
[58:06] you there are many people who would love
[58:10] to see this and they can't see it but
[58:13] God is giving you grace to see it I'm
[58:17] not against all message people preachers
[58:19] or anything I'm not against any of them
[58:20] but I tell you what if they're not
[58:22] telling the people how they need to
[58:23] prepare themselves and what we're doing
[58:26] we're preparing the people how to live
[58:27] here what that got to do with their
[58:30] always it's about the parish is that
[58:33] right
[58:34] frustration said these denominating this
[58:36] what he said these denominational
[58:38] preachers he said they're building these
[58:40] big churches and claiming Jesus is soon
[58:43] to come what's he saying then it can't
[58:47] be in the will of God
[58:47] oh I get in trouble for that one but my
[58:54] question is this how many in their
[58:56] churches have the really the real true
[58:59] Holy Ghost because I'm gonna tell you
[59:02] something soon as you build fancy
[59:03] churches you know what happens you start
[59:07] compromising oh come on
[59:11] people gotta pay the bill you ain't
[59:17] gonna hit too hard like you're used to
[59:18] I know what I'm talking about y'all are
[59:20] gonna be like I don't know what I'm
[59:21] saying I've been around a long time I've
[59:23] seen things change
[59:24] whoo oh yeah I'm going on out that any
[59:30] part of my message but I just threw it
[59:31] in there I understand and I'm almost
[59:34] done with this portion because God is
[59:39] gathering and what people don't
[59:43] understand he's not gathering like we
[59:45] think he's gathering we're not a nation
[59:49] as such he gathered Israel by nation but
[59:53] when it came to Gentiles he called them
[59:55] one by one huh somebody when he when he
[1:00:04] with the Cherico when they went down to
[1:00:06] Jericho gray one because we have one at
[1:00:12] her house to be saved
[1:00:13] a little more was added when it came to
[1:00:17] the knees one because camellias amen one
[1:00:21] of this family say more at it you
[1:00:24] understand me
[1:00:25] he didn't goes at all I'm going to
[1:00:27] gather all God don't have respect of
[1:00:30] nobody's nation there's only one nation
[1:00:34] one people that God is interested in and
[1:00:36] and that is his own am I making sense
[1:00:40] God don't care by the way you'll color
[1:00:42] yo yo yo yo yo your profession God don't
[1:00:46] get nothing about that he's looking at
[1:00:49] one thing the seed God is looking for
[1:00:54] the seed he's looking for him is that
[1:00:56] right that great eagle has spread her
[1:00:59] wings and she's looking for home that's
[1:01:04] all she's looking for the seed that the
[1:01:06] egg of the child that she knows is out
[1:01:08] there and she's making cries right now
[1:01:11] searching for hers and guess what she
[1:01:15] don't care what barnyard you in she
[1:01:17] gonna find
[1:01:23] hmm is that right
[1:01:28] listen brother man says and that the law
[1:01:31] listen this covenant was not on not on
[1:01:34] condition but was unconditional Lee is
[1:01:39] that right so God had to make a covenant
[1:01:41] with his people and you know what that
[1:01:44] does it it throws the pride out the door
[1:01:48] mm-hmm hello you ain't nothin
[1:01:52] every gift God get you got God gave it
[1:01:55] to you you didn't earn it it was given
[1:02:00] to you before come on somebody in other
[1:02:04] words brothers y'all didn't just become
[1:02:05] piano players you were there before that
[1:02:07] way in heaven you know how to play it
[1:02:10] that's why you can play now that's why I
[1:02:12] was always a deep call for it
[1:02:14] I just singing that was given to me
[1:02:20] before I got here God knew how I was
[1:02:23] going to sound and everything
[1:02:25] come on about it and guess what God put
[1:02:29] in you a liking oh come on somebody she
[1:02:36] had all words together these gifts work
[1:02:38] together it's all to edify the Bride of
[1:02:42] Christ so what happened now we
[1:02:46] understand why God has to do a
[1:02:48] recreation you got to be recreated
[1:02:53] you can't enter in to heaven this way no
[1:02:57] unclean thing is going to enter in hmm
[1:03:01] everything has to be your new you got to
[1:03:03] be justified sanctified you have to
[1:03:06] receive the baptism the Holy Ghost and
[1:03:07] brother Branham brought us to the fourth
[1:03:09] step you gotta that baptism of the Holy
[1:03:11] Ghost makes room for Christ himself is
[1:03:14] that right it's got to be it must happen
[1:03:20] and guess what I love the fact that I
[1:03:23] ain't got nothing to do with it
[1:03:26] y'all don't like me to say it that way I
[1:03:30] have nothing to do with it
[1:03:35] it's all in God's hands whoo
[1:03:40] listen this what the property God said
[1:03:42] the great Greek word says new creation
[1:03:45] it's a new creation
[1:03:46] you have been recreated again from what
[1:03:50] you were to the image of the son of God
[1:03:52] and a daughter of God it's just such see
[1:03:55] it's the greatest miracle that ever
[1:03:58] happened when a sinner can be made to
[1:04:00] become a Christian hallelujah
[1:04:02] so you say what I mean that's why the
[1:04:04] problem God said when you born again he
[1:04:06] said that is just the beginning
[1:04:09] you've got the crime and rise higher
[1:04:13] y'all understand this without divine
[1:04:16] love they without us cannot be made
[1:04:19] perfect the pyramid is not complete
[1:04:21] without us hmm so you must understand
[1:04:26] you're pressing towards something when
[1:04:30] love is tested can I say like this
[1:04:33] almost done when love is tested do you
[1:04:36] know that you're gonna have trial after
[1:04:38] trial after trial after trial Oh y'all
[1:04:42] don't want that but it's true try a lot
[1:04:45] to try that's why we get more trials
[1:04:47] seem like than any age ever and our
[1:04:49] greatest trials are in our mind we are
[1:04:52] living in an age of insanity and you're
[1:04:55] fighting to keep yours I know what I'm
[1:05:00] talking about
[1:05:02] sometimes I del you feel Oh Lord look
[1:05:05] the day you know they don't even want to
[1:05:07] let it come out your mouth right because
[1:05:10] you you up so in your mind you've got
[1:05:12] these battles going on the old man
[1:05:16] things people say to you things people
[1:05:19] do to you and Satan is right at you
[1:05:22] every day without prayer you defeated
[1:05:28] without prayer you open the door for
[1:05:31] demons
[1:05:32] oh come on somebody without the Holy
[1:05:36] Ghost you take off that soldier's ear
[1:05:41] you know Peter he was really angry
[1:05:44] aiming for the head right
[1:05:48] hey man God promised it the prophecies
[1:05:51] and gods obligated to Kate take care of
[1:05:55] it so y'all know that when Jesus comes
[1:06:07] and he calls him from the dust of the
[1:06:10] earth he will do exactly what the first
[1:06:15] Adam should have done and we we call
[1:06:20] from the dust of the earth we will all
[1:06:24] be filled we were all you know what
[1:06:28] causes right you let me say like this
[1:06:30] you know when when Cain killed Abel Abel
[1:06:37] did did you ever hear Abel talking he
[1:06:42] wouldn't die but there's no record of
[1:06:45] his voice but Abel died and the Bible
[1:06:50] said he's crying still he still speaks
[1:06:55] meaning that he's not dead he's
[1:06:59] somewhere like those Jews over there
[1:07:01] still speaking under the altar Lord how
[1:07:04] long hallelujah so those who are
[1:07:08] listening what was the difference
[1:07:11] Abel was of the blood of Adam and Cain
[1:07:16] was of the blood of the serpent so it
[1:07:19] was still life in the blood of Abel and
[1:07:23] because of that you understand when I
[1:07:25] say life in the blood because he Abel's
[1:07:28] blood he meant was was represented by
[1:07:31] the Lamb you die you did basically with
[1:07:39] this blood but we live because of the
[1:07:43] life of the blood of the Lamb scuse me
[1:07:45] right that's why the life was killed the
[1:07:49] by said he was slain before the foul
[1:07:52] he was slain before the foundation of
[1:07:54] the world don't look at me like I don't
[1:07:55] know what I'm talking about
[1:07:56] I know what I'm saying it was a lamb
[1:08:00] that was named before the
[1:08:02] foundation in the world that represented
[1:08:04] Abel's life that's why he could still
[1:08:06] speak though he was dead because the
[1:08:09] blood covered him the land ma your names
[1:08:14] were put in the last book of life before
[1:08:16] the foundation of the world that blood
[1:08:19] that lamb that book covers you
[1:08:21] throughout all your life but the thing
[1:08:33] that gets me is because people are
[1:08:35] stopping short they don't want to go all
[1:08:38] the way that's what what what happened
[1:08:40] with Pentecost they thought were praise
[1:08:42] the Lord I could speak in tongues I can
[1:08:43] shout like a dance that's it and that
[1:08:45] wasn't it see it was another stage to
[1:08:49] come that's what God had to say another
[1:08:52] car for with the light of the hour and
[1:08:55] the Bible said if you walk in the light
[1:08:57] as he is in the light right the blood of
[1:09:02] Jesus Christ will do what cleanse you
[1:09:04] from all your unrighteousness and then
[1:09:07] you will have fellowship one with
[1:09:09] another our fellowship is another
[1:09:12] natural fellowship our fellowship is
[1:09:14] around the Holy Spirit and around his
[1:09:17] word people oh lord help me Jesus
[1:09:21] so you he said listen go back to
[1:09:25] Thessalonians I'm almost done with this
[1:09:27] portion that ye be not soon shaken where
[1:09:30] in your mind or be troubled neither by
[1:09:36] spirit nor by word nor by letter as from
[1:09:39] us as that day of Christ is at hand
[1:09:42] don't be shaken in your mind you don't
[1:09:47] have listen at the end of the day when
[1:09:50] that squeeze come on you're not gonna
[1:09:51] have a building to go to anyway so where
[1:09:54] you go to worship God hmm you ought to
[1:09:57] be worshipped him every day is that
[1:10:00] right and let me tell you something
[1:10:02] people of God I don't know whether
[1:10:03] you're doing it or not but every day you
[1:10:06] need to take a bath in the word every
[1:10:10] day there should be a circumcision God
[1:10:14] cut it off stop
[1:10:16] before it come whatever the devil has
[1:10:18] sent for me give me the grace to stand
[1:10:28] you understand me
[1:10:30] what are we here for let me see you know
[1:10:34] we are here so that this light this
[1:10:36] world can see Jesus if you're not
[1:10:39] reflecting Jesus you failing God yeah
[1:10:44] say it again if you're not reflecting
[1:10:46] Jesus Christ in your life you are
[1:10:50] failing God and the purpose for which he
[1:10:54] has you here was that tough I hope it
[1:11:01] was tough enough because it's true
[1:11:03] we're here to reflect Jesus Christ he
[1:11:05] said ye are the lights of the world
[1:11:07] don't hide this candle on the bush be
[1:11:11] the city set up on the yield where all
[1:11:13] men can see hmm it's a horrible thing
[1:11:17] when people say well I didn't know they
[1:11:19] were that's terrible if you want to put
[1:11:27] yourself in the spot you shouldn't have
[1:11:28] to tell them but if you want to make
[1:11:30] sure you keep yourself in check you tell
[1:11:32] the person when you for I'm a Christian
[1:11:33] so they can watch you don't give them a
[1:11:39] little guess but why are you so nice no
[1:11:41] I'm a Christian right God's great secret
[1:11:46] just five more minutes please has always
[1:11:50] blinded the wisdom of the world they
[1:11:54] can't get it they just don't understand
[1:11:57] it Satan don't understand it none of the
[1:12:01] rest of them understand it but the just
[1:12:04] but just those who are predestinated to
[1:12:08] understand it how God and Christ are one
[1:12:17] they can't understand it I'm lead with
[1:12:24] this quote Israel in the church part two
[1:12:29] God told Abraham I have blessed you I
[1:12:32] have made you a father not i will i am i
[1:12:37] have made you and you'll come to me in
[1:12:41] an o age let me tell you something
[1:12:44] I'm not Jeremiah but I believe God did
[1:12:47] the same for me like he did Jeremiah God
[1:12:52] could say Isaiah I knew you before he
[1:12:54] was formed in your mother's womb I call
[1:12:57] you to be a preacher my I sanctified you
[1:13:03] come on son I see you got to understand
[1:13:06] even though God didn't personally come
[1:13:08] to tell you that he did through his
[1:13:10] prophet is that right he said I have
[1:13:13] justified you as though you've never
[1:13:15] sinned in the first place now you can't
[1:13:18] get no more sanctified than that
[1:13:22] I'm almost y'all keep pulling I'm almost
[1:13:25] done I have I have made you and you come
[1:13:28] to me in an old age he's talking to
[1:13:30] Abram and you're going to be saved and
[1:13:33] I've already done it and I already said
[1:13:36] so and you haven't got nothing to do
[1:13:39] with it it's unconditional God
[1:13:42] determined how to have his church so
[1:13:45] every time he's made a covenant with man
[1:13:47] and man breaks his covenant and he does
[1:13:49] yet today man will always break his
[1:13:52] covenant with god but God can't break
[1:13:55] his covenant with man so I will so what
[1:13:59] are you saying I'm telling you now you
[1:14:01] may not be where you want to be hmm you
[1:14:08] may not be where you want to be and you
[1:14:10] might feel like you the last one in the
[1:14:12] line but you ought to thank God you in
[1:14:14] the line you may not be in spirituals
[1:14:20] you want to be but let me tell you
[1:14:21] something God will never fail you it's
[1:14:25] unconditional no matter how many times
[1:14:27] we fail don't you worry if you ever grow
[1:14:30] corn or grow some kind of wheat or
[1:14:32] whatever out there there's those little
[1:14:34] ones that comes up look like they the
[1:14:36] like they in the last place and all you
[1:14:38] need is a good rain and overnight though
[1:14:43] Stingo see that's all you need is a good
[1:14:48] rain and god's gonna bring each and
[1:14:52] every one as to that perfection y'all
[1:14:54] believe that i don't know about you I
[1:14:56] thirst for righteousness and he said if
[1:14:59] you thirst for word
[1:15:00] you shall be filled I don't like doing
[1:15:03] wrong because I don't like doing be
[1:15:06] doing wrong that means that's good
[1:15:08] brother that means I can't be of the
[1:15:10] devil the devil enjoys his evil but when
[1:15:15] you enjoy Jesus or enjoy the
[1:15:18] righteousness God will make sure you
[1:15:20] continue to have it is that right that's
[1:15:24] just a grace of God you love the Lord
[1:15:27] blessed and he's gathering us every Holy
[1:15:36] Ghost filled believer and don't you
[1:15:40] think God ain't here to fill your cup
[1:15:43] David said Lord let it run over mmm yo
[1:15:49] we need some holy we need and I'm crying
[1:15:52] out for the Holy Ghost I'm crying out
[1:15:53] for a refreshing I'm crying out for
[1:15:55] revival in this church and I just hope
[1:15:58] by God's grace that you there you hear
[1:16:00] when he comes he's coming he didn't tell
[1:16:05] me when he's gonna show up but he's
[1:16:07] coming hallelujah
[1:16:09] like I said I can't miss it cuz I'm the
[1:16:11] preacher
[1:16:14] he's gonna show up and I just pray I
[1:16:18] pray I remember brother telling me the
[1:16:21] story it was more than his doors he was
[1:16:24] actually thinking about me and he and
[1:16:26] his company and his church have been
[1:16:28] fasting and praying
[1:16:29] Darwin feeling with the Holy Ghost cuz
[1:16:33] when I went there I saw all little
[1:16:35] children worshiping God and praising the
[1:16:37] Lord and you can see it wasn't a fake it
[1:16:39] was really I think same with all of them
[1:16:41] but I knew something young kids like
[1:16:44] that
[1:16:46] and I ask myself the world dr. Church
[1:16:48] like that
[1:16:54] brother books you know what happened he
[1:16:58] said it was so strange he said we were
[1:17:01] all in the book
[1:17:03] I dismissed he says so little people
[1:17:06] left out the other group
[1:17:10] brain vision and somehow God will be
[1:17:13] just don't lock the door but he didn't
[1:17:16] work role in a fear anymore so he went
[1:17:19] in locked the door and he said we need
[1:17:22] finish locking that last door the power
[1:17:24] party
[1:17:25] he said Brotherhood to this day I don't
[1:17:27] know how I got back to the pulpit he
[1:17:30] said but the Lord fell on everybody the
[1:17:32] young and the old he said they went the
[1:17:35] scream and they went the Harland he said
[1:17:37] the people who had already left turn
[1:17:39] back around
[1:17:45] what unless what unless I'll never
[1:17:53] forget that that's how we had that
[1:17:55] revival in in Lima he can't let her to
[1:17:59] us
[1:18:00] keep us all God wait 30 minutes power
[1:18:04] God struck like that so we went all the
[1:18:07] fans to get free and I can't remember
[1:18:09] how many days how many months it's God
[1:18:12] having service more often preaching
[1:18:15] faster reaching I remember the day we
[1:18:18] was okay we've done all we could do that
[1:18:22] was a Friday that Saturday Sun Saturday
[1:18:25] and God showed up
[1:18:28] we had dinner nights with never
[1:18:30] experienced only goes running up and
[1:18:33] down that how like a man

[1:19:01] something where you say God I got you I
[1:19:03] don't know how to clean up I clean up
[1:19:05] the best I know how I would just want to
[1:19:07] be in a place where we ever get like
[1:19:11] that you'll see God do something and it
[1:19:14] no man can take it from God is deadly
