you've given a concert and a half i appreciate that by the grace of god god is good to us appreciate the atmosphere quite different from sunday uh we thank the lord for his goodness we're just going to get right on into the word of god we ask us to turn with us amen to we're going to finish ministering on a few things here um dealing with the mystery of god we in seed form we we've seen where god has done some great things for us and i just love the how simple god is the simplicity i said genesis i keep saying it but first john please first john forgive me every time i think about genesis i think about first john it's gonna be uh saint john 1 i'm sorry saint john 1. [Music] we know these scriptures i'd like to entitle this message christ the germ of life dealing with the seven-fold manifestation of god hidden in seed in his seed if we just read here in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him without him was not anything made that was made in him was life as the key word and the life was the light of men hallelujah galatians 3 16. everybody love the lord you know we appreciate god i know that uh we're in a time where people as the scriptures say it's high time to wake up out of sleep i think we've slumbered long enough and uh when we think about how satan is such a he knows how to distract us he's really good at it and uh if we're not careful he'll do the thing for us we're not going to be long but we'll make it short seeing that we have another part of the service to go into let's read now galatians 3 16 please now to abraham and his seed were the promise made he said not unto seeds as a many but as of one and to that sea which is christ let us pray heavenly father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us we thank you for being our all in all and father we just love you we just love you and we thank you for all that you do for us in spite of all our shortcomings we surely appreciate your lord and we never want to um disrespect you in any way father help us lord keep our hearts and minds on you lord in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated glad to uh have our brother troy with us amen his family we appreciate him we we thank god for uh uh all that has been done and what's done um when i think about and i've just been thinking uh really a lot about the mercies and the grace of god and how awesome god is i think sometimes when we think about life we fail to see that everything that has life is given by god there's only one life and the true life of god is what i have everything that we see live and live even when jesus said that he was able to make a rock cry out that was god speaking because god can enter into a rock and make it live he's the one who governs all the laws and especially the laws of life life in itself as we see it because of the fall if we realize uh if we we understand the death burial and resurrection of jesus christ we'll be able to see that everything in our life as we see it magnifies it uh from the creation or and from the rising of the sun to the setting of the sun you know uh we we see it as when we we think about how the wind blows nobody can see it we don't know where it comes from and we don't know where it goes i mean the whole uh creation um it's it's all about life this is what make god so great like even the prophet god said that the scientists they can do a lot of things and they can but they can't make a piece of grass grow they can't see where the life is it's in a secret place it's in a place that only god is visible to god where it is uh you know as i was speaking this morning you know all seeds though they may look alike may not be alike because there are seeds that are planted into the ground at harvest but all seeds don't come up because all of those seeds don't have a germ of life in it but for those who have the germ of life once you plant it and it dies and it rots something happens as i said even this morning you can't you can count there's seas in the apple but you can't count the apples in the seed that's the miracle and that's what's so amazing about a seed and i've never seen anybody take seeds and say oh look they're so beauties are beautiful seeds because if you've seen one seed you've seen them all and there's nothing that is so glorious about a seed most seeds are just common and sometimes they're just ugly but it's what's that what's in the seed that brings the beauty but it has to die it has to rot in order for that life to come out and for in order for you to see what god has amen in that seed you think about it how some seeds once they die they come up and they bring some of the most before before the before the fruit of the seed comes forth they used to have these beautiful blossoms of some sort to to to hail the coming of the of the fruits and and when you see those things it's like oh my you know especially a pear tree sometimes those pear those pear trees really bring some beautiful blossoms out before you see the little pears coming on them and and that's just the beginning and it does it magnifies god in such a way because those little pears stars out like that and then they get sometimes just and you say how did that tree do that it wasn't the tree it was the life in the tree it was the law that god put in the tree that every seed should bring forth of its kind and when we think about that it's just amazing because i always you heard when i talked when we spoke the last time how god hid himself in a seed he literally told us the whole bible or the the whole plan of redemption by planting a seed and he showed us there it i think he's in matthew how when a plant a sower went out to sow seed and and he sold the seed and the seed fell into the ground and and and and it brought forth but the sword didn't do anything that the soul was god it was a type of god and god sold his seed out there and the seed laid there day and night night and day that seed something made something happen that seed began to rot it died and it rot and all of a sudden out of the grave comes life and it's amazing because that's exactly what jesus said except for seed if a corn or wheat abideth alone it does nothing but think about it when he died did you understand that a lot of they didn't understand it when the true seed of god died this is what really excites me i'm getting excited because you got to realize when you can plant one seed but out of that one seed causes a multitude of seeds that would be also able at one point in time to die to rot and bring more it becomes innumerable it becomes it comes to a place where it can't be uh numbered and the seed i'm talking about tonight is the same seed that john saw but what john saw was the harvest of that seed and he said there was a number that no man can number came out of one seed and that seed was christ you see the devil thought he was going to stop god and every time god began to do something satan would always come to try to stop it even in the beginning when god brought forth and i i told y'all when when when satan when lucifer took jesus christ upon the mountain and and showed him the beautiful countries he wasn't talking oh look at new york isn't it wonderful no new york is a dump look at washington dc but what he was doing he was showing the achievements that he had achieved through man by ruling over them you understand me because when the devil said in isaiah he will exalt his throne above the stars he will become as god you see what i'm saying he'll become like god see he did not enjoy his position and the only position that was greater than his position was god he wanted to go beyond that but you see he he's not a creator he's a perverter and that was the only way he could get into the the kingdom of god existed when you look you say oh eden was so beautiful beautiful trees beautiful flowers beautiful animals beautiful everything was beautiful do you really think that's what the devil was after do you really think that's what he was saying amen i am going to exalt my throne the devil knew where the throne of room of god was and he understood if i could get into that uh into the kingdom of god it's got to come by science you understand me and what did he do he perverted see that's the that's the thing you got to be really careful in this day uh about the word of god because what satan did he twisted the word and he used science the mind deceive and he believed the devil and adam and eve they fell that's what the devil wanted it wasn't the garden of eden that he wanted that wasn't the kingdom of god the kingdom of god was adam and eve hallelujah it is the temple of god the place where god had ordained to worship hallelujah he understood the worshiping up in heaven lucifer knew that but when god made a man god stepped into that man hallelujah and his name was adam that was the kingdom of god see this is why adam was able to name the animals because god had already named the animals and adam he said i want to see whether adam can condemn these animals but what it was it was already god had named the animals read your scriptures and god and adam comes along and name he didn't rename them he named them what adam named what god named them because god in adam was one the mind of god was in adam that was the kingdom of god and when he overthrew adam he believed the devil did he believed that he could overthrow god that's why he fights so much now because he still believes that he can overthrow god because he overthrew adam but he did not understand adam was not deceived the woman was deceived hallelujah amen and adam willfully moved out from the uh from that the veil of god only to save his wife because the kingdom had been divided and a house divided cannot stand and he needed adam needed his wife like god needs you y'all understand me but they were coming a time when god was going to unite it again man and woman will become one hallelujah which was signifying that one day god and his bride will become one the second adam and his bride will become one having the same mind the same god being the temple of god [Laughter] so what are you saying brother brooks see this whole thing was no mistake god knew what it was going to be like because adam knew that eve was going to fall even when he saw her because he says you're going to leave your mother and father and cleave to your husband remember there wasn't supposed to be a mother and father they were supposed to be children the only mother and father that would have been was adam and eve but all of the offspring that would come after adam would be children hallelujah is that right you say break that down well when you get to heaven there will be no more husbands and wives there will be no more brother there will be no more uh husbands and wives there'll be no grandparents everybody will be brothers and sisters as it was from the beginning hallelujah is that right all glory to god now you say well brother brooks what are you saying what are you saying i'm trying to tell you every seed shall bring forth of its kind right and i told you i wasn't going to be long so i better get to where i'm going we must understand that every seed every time the devil god would bring forth a seed the devil always tried to kill it or destroy it so when cain was destroyed he thought he had killed uh uh abel oscar when abel was destroyed or killed cain thought he had destroyed the lineage of god but all that was still god god in his mind was going to prove amen that he can cannot be destroyed see life can't be destroyed let me say it again life cannot be destroyed there's nothing about god that can ever be destroyed hallelujah even when everything is burned all over again you still go back to whatever you was with adam whatever your natural body will always go back to whatever it was before the beginning because nothing really can be destroyed you all got quiet on me but that's the truth brother madam used the word annihilated there's nothing that can truly ever be annihilated now so i go all go back to this god in his mind saw all of you right and he never said where were the fathers and the mothers where were they job no he said where were the sons of god what were they doing you understand me the sons of god began to rejoice when they saw calvary when they saw the victory that god was going to restore them back to their proper place is that right so you say oh what do you mean even when uh they said to jesus your mother and your brother they seek you jesus said who is my mother and my brother those that do my father's will now i'm coming to this when god sowed the seed you remember now there are two seeds there was a there's a good seed and there was an evil seed and here brother branham said the germ is a life first the germ is a tiny cell with life in it and the life can come from two sources either god or the devil and you came from the germ of god the germ of life by god so what makes us different is what we were born with y'all understand what i'm saying what you were born with is what makes you different you were born with the seed of god said like this the germ of god or the let's say like this the gene of god that gene of god was put in you before the foundation of the world that's why when satan wanted to kill even your ancestors they could not kill your ancestor because you were there you understand me like levi yeah in the loins of of abraham he could not be destroyed and so you and i must understand that if god protected us for thousands of years to bring us into this day to do what manifests the fruit of the seed that was planted hallelujah so what are you saying i'm saying even when when when peter first peter comes along and says you know now we are partakers of divine nature he saw that listen it's not going to be a narrow way of entrance but there'll be a grand injury there'll be an abundance of of understanding abundance of revelation that you're going to receive to go into this place you won't scarcely go into it so when i thought about that i came can't god just showed me that here it is jesus says i am the door i am the door to the sheep folk right and so we've been taught that when a shepherd gather his sheets for the end uh before the evening he always lay in front of the door right he's there to protect that door so there's always a protection even even when when adam and eve sinned there were there were cherubims there amen protecting the door we call it the tree of life but that was the door and then we find out that even when mo noah built the ark brother branham and i you got to realize what he's saying he said noah stood in the door and he and he preached it's going to rain so he showed in order to get into the door you had to come by way of door but satan has impostors because when jesus came he told those pharisees and sadducees you stand in the door in other words you know the way to enter into eternal life say but you won't go in neither will you let your subjects go in he said you generation of vipers you see he could always take that back to uh uh uh uh cain because cain knew the way god told him the way hallelujah but cain refused to go that way why he refused he took the revelation of his mama the church he took his revelation of of of of the serpent and he moved with that and he he made it right but this is what happened so you'll know the nature of the seed the nature of the seed of the serpent is always trying to be something that he's not wanting self-glorification wanting to be greater want recognition y'all hear me that's that's right in the message people want to be recognized to be something that they're not we just don't you're not satisfied with what god has made you hallelujah it's okay to be nothing because even when you're nothing in god you're something you don't have to be great you don't have to be recognized by no man it's the man upstairs we want recognition from oh somebody help me here even in the message people want a name you know i ran from that that's why i'm here today it's not because i want a name i didn't come here amen to be a name i came here hiding running from that thing because there's only one name that needs to be glorified and that's the name of jesus christ but satan i will exalt i will exalt oh we got to make it better make it better make it better and that's exactly what david did david thought if i just put the ark on a new cart i've made it better no sir you can't improve god hallelujah like i said and we don't understand what satan has done in this day with every influence throughout all the ages through the old testament from the all all way to the new you know what he's done he's pulled all of his resources together to deceive the sons of god all of his resources and every one of his resources hinges on lust of the flesh lust of the eye and the pride of life those are the three things that satan operates to turn your thoughts away from god the word and make you believe his lie is that right he'll make a woman believe that she's not beautiful but god made every woman beautiful but he'll tell her you need to make it better you understand me hey always we're never satisfied i mean even if you lose weight you can lose weight and look just like you want to look and somebody will say man you're just getting too thin yeah that's what they say oh you don't look right but to you you look right but because somebody said you don't look right you gain a little bit of weight it don't come back a little bit it comes back a lot now you're back where you started from right yet the flesh is never satisfied we know that because we have all kinds of changes of clothes we get tired of these and they stay in the closet we get new ones we get tired of those new ones then they go back in the other part of the closet never satisfied because we're always trying to improve this outward man and by while you're doing all of this trying improvement the boy is getting old it's like trying to give a old house a faith lift painting it right but i'm what i'm trying to say these are the tactics what did he do he took the he took science and he engineered it so well like the proper guy said it once was the television then it moves from the computer then it's to the iphone and the ipad and i think randy randy verton preached on the iphone and the ipad and showed how you know everything is [Laughter] exalting yourself right now and the thing about it is like now they got it you can catch pictures you can make pictures and you can what you call it crop it or something they can make it look so good you know that ain't you but you can visit what you would like to look like right and you can make it look just like that you said who is that right but it's just what we imagine what we dream to be and all along we don't see the vanity behind it and we don't even see how satan is sneaking in like an old snake subtly suddenly and and he's moving and changing your thoughts about yourself and at the end of the day you end up becoming depressed and cast down because you know you'll never look like that right you think michael jackson was ever happy but the devil kept telling him he could improve himself and at the time at the end of the day he really looked hideous y'all know what i'm saying but something was inspired all of that money and he never was happy right hallelujah y'all see what i'm saying and then with all of that he considered himself a god and he missed god and that's what happens when you're not satisfied satan makes you worship yourself you become the god and by doing so you miss god and guess what you're doing the same thing that lucifer did in the beginning you began to worship yourself and try to put yourself above god you understand what i'm saying he's so tricky with his thoughts and his his ideas of things and and we we the church we we allow it to happen see that's what happened to the pentecostal church they allowed the world to come in and what was the world it was satan's influence and what was that influence taking them to the mark of the beast you understand me let me show so you can understand what i know you understand what i'm saying but the influence of satan what it did even in the anteluvian day it made man become beastly and because of the mixture there was always that place in that man to become a serpent or to become a son and because of the influence look what happens we know the truth of the matter is he caused them to multiply but it was caused multiplying according to their will not god's will and then therefore they the whole earth was polluted and by the serpents and and god destroyed it and as it was in the days of noah when education and all these things are flourishing just like it was in that day what's happening the the seed of the serpent is multiplying and the seed of god is diminishing because by the time it almost got to the destruction of the world the seed of enoch was one the understanding those who would make a rapture had so diminished god use one man to symbolize the bride of jesus christ you understand me so you're saying brother what what was going on i'm telling you now closing because it's much whenever satan influences you he has something to gain from you always and you and i must understand that this is a time when we must understand that god's trying to reflect himself through you the germ of life that was planted we were you know it wasn't all about g let me say it in the right way when jesus died when he rose again his life journey wasn't complete in the way i'm going to say this because he came to multiply his kind to give birth to his kind and the only way he could give birth to his kind was by himself because man was to give birth is that right we're born by christ and christ is a man god told adam to be fruitful and multiply before eve ever came on the scene the original order is that right who speaks the word where does the seed of life come from where does the germ of life come from it comes from the man it was god hallelujah and we are born of who god so we understand by god's grace always done amen for reproduction but the original was not supposed to be that's why when you get to heaven there will not be any babies there won't be any old folks everybody will be in their perfect statue everybody will be brothers and sisters hallelujah and guess what people there will not be another another lust of the eye loss of the flesh or pride of life all of that will be gone hallelujah but the beauty of who you are to go back to the statue of a perfect man like i was telling the brother of the day i used to say oh god hi there's two two messages that used to stump me every time and that was the statue of a perfect man and thinking man's filter trying to get through the filter flow trying to get through the filter and when you saw a faulty like i am you know you you you're doing your best you're doing your best and you don't understand you did i didn't understand that what makes you go through the filter you could never do it it law will never bring you to heaven it's only the grace of god and when i heard the prophet of god say on the statue of a perfect man he said you cannot add to it but it will add to you that's the life of the seed hallelujah that seed die light comes up and everything that needs to be added to that particular life adds itself yields itself as long as it stays in the sun and goes through the seasonal changes amen everything produces itself the next thing you know the tree is matured and blossoms comes on it and after the blossom comes the fruit y'all understand what i'm saying it it's the life in the seed and all you need that's the that's the whole bible that germ of life was christ that's why he had to die that's why he had to come back and baptize you quicken you which was alive to quicken the seed that was already there is that right probably god said you either got one thing in you or the other you either got the dove or a snake hallelujah you got faith or unbelief either way you go with it right but because of what the sower did you say well brother books that just don't sound fair let me say it like this god don't make foolish virgins foolish virgins make themselves because of their choices in life you understand me they chose it you see but god because of omniscient he saw that he saw what their choices would be and then he foreordained them to be that to fulfill his purpose hallelujah i know yes god will manipulate things sometimes because the bible says that all things work together for the good of them that love god when god sees you off track from his purpose he'll intervene he said brother bruce what are you saying god gave uh uh he gave uh samson an order first of all samson you are a nazarite don't you ever cut your hair this is your sign that you have become bind now watch this in all of the wicked things samson did as long as he didn't cut his hair as long as he didn't shave the thunders off y'all understand me he was still a man but he had a covenant that was given to him god was still with him but the moment he allowed the enemy to cut his head he told the secret he told the secret what was the secret he should never cut his hand obedience is better than sacrifice that's what he said i must obey the word whatever god told me to do i must do that otherwise i'll become just as weak as everybody else she is obedience to the word and what happens god use his mistake god used sam's mistake and made him greater at the end that he was in the beginning that's what god will do for his true seed amen hallelujah because remember there was only one who was truly perfect and that was god himself but the light in you you say oh god i want to be perfect well the seed is perfect that's what makes you perfect oh god that's why the bible says if that seed remaineth in you you cannot sin there is no way that god can disbelieve his own word hallelujah you love the lord uh uh my god my god i'm gonna read this one scripture then we'll go into our communion because i know we're running late and all of these things but are you seeing what i'm saying is it being clear because it takes away your struggle and brings you to a place of yielding it is not hard to yield it's not hard to humble yourself you just do it right humbling yourself is better than trying to climb a ladder right going down is much easier than getting up and once you humble yourself god will then lift you up into the place that you desire to be you say well how possible that is let me tell you what god did he took an ill-famed woman and everybody knew she was a prostitute and she comes in there in simon's house and began to weep and cry and wash his feet she was the lowest of all loaves hallelujah but when she washed his feet and cried and however she communicated to him he caught her thoughts and said woman your sins are forgiven he took an ill-famed woman and put her placed her in the hall of fame every christian in the world knows about mary hallelujah don't you understand what i'm trying to say that's all she did was humble herself before the word and the word lifted her up like he told abraham from the dust to the stars hallelujah that's what god takes you from the sand from the dirt of the earth and then make you a star of god that's what he does that's what calvary is all about is changing you and rearranging you [Laughter] hallelujah yes sir taking you and bringing you from being an old sloppy dog amen to to a great prince of god glory to god my last scripture for our gospel came not unto you in word only and this is where we're going we have allowed satan to misconstrue the word and change it so much that we feel like we're bride and we're already there and and we're mature let me tell you what a mature bride is a matured bride is the bride that has the mind of god in her right she knows what to do that's the problem a lot of people don't know what to do with the word oh we don't shout no more we don't dance no more we don't have no more gifts because we're more we're greater that's a lie everything that god put in the tree is supposed to be displayed right hallelujah it is alive from the devil oh we're beyond that well when you're beyond that amen there's no more fruit on the tree everything than fall out has fallen off the leaves have fallen off now you're in the winter and the fall and that's why you win like you do but this is a time of worship this is a time of praise this is a time when god has shown you that you were with him before the foundation of the world stop your worrying stop your fretting ask whatsoever your will and i'll give it to you see you got to know who you are you're a son of the king amen is that right you come before the ages of heaven god will hear your prayer and when you pray pray in faith when you pray in faith it is yours right i wanna you know what i'm trying to say i'm tired of seeing this you know this this so-called bride amen with no movement no nothing you're coming to the church and you feel like you're preaching to the chairs you know there's hardly nothing going on oh my god i tell you what i take this message take it to a pentecostal church and they'll run in the walls they would because they're so hungry and thirsty for revelation and the problem is we are full of it we got so much of it it's become common to us what a dangerous place to be hallelujah is that right it's the meat of the word and what happened you know it it's made us sick with vomiting it up we can't digest it lord have mercy on our soul he will one thing i love about god he's perfect he looked out for us and told us don't worry you do best under pressure and i'm going to bring it to you [Laughter] don't worry i know how you made up i'm going to bring the pressure and that pressure is gonna bring everything in you out i love it i love it i love it samson was impressed under pressure he said oh lord once more give me old pentecostal revival once more let me die with my enemy hallelujah yes sir under pressure pressure is amazing it's amazing hallelujah for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the gospel in the and in the holy ghost now that's what people don't understand he said power and in the holy ghost yeah brother was trying to well we bought his a little bit because he said he's using the term headship and i'm using the term mind of god now what's the difference tell me what's the difference see that's what aggravates me if that makes sense i hate when people use little terms like that to make a difference what is the mind of god and then the bible says let this mind be in you now if that ain't hardship i don't know what it is hardship is not some figure of speech but hardship is a state of being amen and when you have the mind of god you have headship because it's christ who leads you it is the shepherd that leads you but that's what happens that's how denominational starts you know you know you think you better because you say the word headshit well my revelation is the same even if i use the mind of god people they need to stop that nonsense oh but also in power and in the holy ghost that's like the rapture peace oh he's coming in the white house some say he's coming i don't care how he comes he's coming amen that's how they miss jesus they thought he was coming on the right white stagger of some sort and he comes on a white donkey so they couldn't see him amen what difference how he came he came and my point is god changing me he's changing you otherwise you wouldn't be here today while the world is thinking god is lost he's no longer here satan is one lucifer however you want to call it i saw something on the on on the internet yesterday where they trying to glorify lucifer and make him something he ain't nothing ain't nothing wrong with the name of loose but go ahead and name your child that then come here lucifer and i say get away from me lucifer i don't know what's anointing you right now and i don't want a part of it yeah this life now people don't call they don't mind man he ain't nothing but a little demon they call their children little demons and listen they act just like it yeah now i'm saying if the world can recognize their children to be little demons what about us what about us now even i heard brother brown say i don't call them i don't call them uh goats i called my little lambs i didn't know i thought that was something i came up with i don't know where i first heard it maybe it was that brother keith i don't know but i just know my children are lambs ah god have mercy you love the lord i trust i gave you something tonight people of god i think what hinders us is because we are working and operating by the law instead of the love of god you believe the love of god do you believe the bible says there is no condemnation of those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit that means having the holy spirit and you're trying to come to a perfection in the holy spirit the word of god said there's no condemnation to you but yet we allow ourselves to be condemned because we make mistakes well what happens while you allow yourself to be so condemned amen when when you make mistakes and and god said you're so justified as though you never sinned in the first place do you take the grace of god if you're under the blood how can how can god ever see any of your sins he doesn't and what makes it so sure is because as soon as we make a mistake we say god forgive us that shows you're under the blood listen once you give your heart to the lord jesus christ there is no way to be lost god don't save you and then loses loses you he doesn't it's not he can't do it because once he becomes your savior he said you have passed from death unto life now you determine your decisions in this life will determine on how happy you are and how free you are right because i'm going to tell you something if you are eagle in a cage the cage can never change you from being an eagle your ego you'll miss a lot of the opportunities because you allow satan to put you in a cage but it can never change who you are that was fresh from the throne hallelujah so you got to understand god is able to unl he's able to break the chains he's able to open the door is that the right the bible says that he will break the fowler's snare that's god this is why we celebrate and do what we do when it comes communion because we're celebrating our victory through jesus christ the blood of the lamb that not only washes our sins away it heals us it delivers us it gives us the right mind the right spirit the right everything that's jesus christ let me tell you something and he didn't leave anything undone this detergent this agent that washes all the way your washes your sins all the way it still works and has never lost its power never will lose its power oh jesus i tell you what i'm a little tired i feel like jumping a little bit i wish and that's what i was telling the church some of the brothers i said i hadn't seen a real holy ghost shout meeting in a long time you know what we did we left the dance with the pentecostal people and we ought to be ashamed if anybody should be dancing and worshiping and praising god like the prophet of god said don't jump no higher than you live but then you need to be jumping high because paul said it's not i that live but christ that lives in me and if you can't jump high on that when something's wrong with you oh jesus have mercy lord i'm having fun because he's here oh praise the lord i learned that in the course of this uh we we we are in a place where we must understand that our enemy is not our brother and sister i had i have to minister that on wednesday probably our enemy is it's the devil the way he influences us against one another and you know what we allow it to happen we allows it we allow it to happen we allow it to go on and when we do allow it and i'm closing if you want to stand when when we allow these things we allow satan to come in and defeat us and and you know because he knows a house divided can't stand he knows that if he can get us going at each other he's he's accomplished everything i i was even telling the church in iowa city this morning what i felt last sunday was unbelievable and i never ever want to experience that again and i hope and trust that the church will keep that kind of a darkness out of this place it was such a dark voidness as if god wasn't here i know he was because it was in me and i'm summoning some of us but my point is this that was something that we fought with when it came into the church i sensed it and didn't know where it came from where it was coming from [Music] let me tell you young people as well as the elders this is not a time to give up you you know tell you something i know you fighting because i'm fighting with everything i got to stay spiritual y'all understand me there was a time we could at least spend a whole day in the presence of the lord without any battles but now you've got to battle all day to stay in his presence it's amazing the struggles that we're going through right now and this is the day that isaiah said that that old enemy would wear the saints out and y'all know what i'm talking about you can't slack in your prayers you can't slack in your reading you can't slack in your praise nowhere because as soon as you slack you allow a crack to come through and when you allow that crack to come in here come the devil and his influence we've got to stay in prayer we've got to stay consecrated as much as possible and i know what i'm talking about i know what i'm talking about i know how i've had to battle and if i'm battling you've got to be battling too that's why i always ask you for your prayers because it's like it's like a bowling ball if that if he rolled that ball just right he'll hit that main pin and if he hit that main pin everything breaks that's who i am i'm the main pen and satan is always after me because he know if he could get me to fall many will fall with me god help me that i will not allow satan to do that to me may god help you to keep satan from bringing you to a fall but if he does guess what a righteous man falls seven times in the day and he gets up the devil is defeated he's defeated i'm gonna be reading from first corinthians we asked our brother troy to come help us with this i'll go and prepare myself let's read this first for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this dude remembers of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this to e as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of this cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many of us are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged that's the key to all that i've read judge yourself if you see something that should be taken care of take care of it something personally take care of it lord forgive me that's where the water washes you you know a lot of times people forget this portion and they walk out and says i'm not worthy to take communion oh you're not worthy because you failed to wash you fail to say god forgive me the blood of jesus christ is here to wash away all your sins right because all of us amen when examining ourselves we search deep down and we know lord i thought this lord i acted in this way lord forgive me you know it's just easy you don't have to do pencils you just confess and make things right before the lord that's all that's where it's at hallelujah right but when you are judged and are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together with condemnation and the rest i was set in order when i come amen if somebody saw me give her a song my brother will assist us [Music] do [Music] come and dine the mastical left come and die you may fist edge stable all the time he will feed the multitudes turn the water into wine to the hungry call it now come and die jesus has a table spread [Music] with his manner heat of fit and supplies our everyday oh too sweet to suck with jesus all the time at jesus table [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] turn the water [Music] [Music] all the time hungry amen amen i close my bible by mistake praise the lord those of us who are participating in the communion may come up now hallelujah [Music] thank you [Music] we used to sing that song happy happy happy happy happy happy y'all remember that i'm so happy we're gonna sing it afterwards but god is good to us amen and when he had given things he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this doing remembers of me that seat after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sup saying this cup is the new testament that in my blood this do e as often as you drink it in remembrance of me [Music] don't let me forget that the bread must be finished before leaving [Music] oh [Music] thank you jesus [Music] amazing [Music] we thank god for this portion of the service we'll return back to the auditorium [Music] you
