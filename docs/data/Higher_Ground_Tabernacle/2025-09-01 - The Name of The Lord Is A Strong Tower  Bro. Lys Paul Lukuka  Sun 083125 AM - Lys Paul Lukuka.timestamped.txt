[0:00] God has given us everything we need to
[0:02] be ready in this journey.
[0:06] I you know this morning I was even
[0:08] thinking I was like we really don't have
[0:11] an excuse anymore in our age
[0:14] because now we even have cell phones
[0:17] when you can just type a quote real
[0:18] quick. The devil is bothering you on
[0:21] something. Let me see what the the word
[0:22] says about that thing. Satan, I chop you
[0:25] off with that word. You know I chop your
[0:27] head off with that word.
[0:29] We don't have an excuse anymore.
[0:33] &gt;&gt; Everything is in your hand. What are you
[0:34] going to tell God?
[0:39] &gt;&gt; Those people that receive the Holy
[0:40] Ghost,
[0:42] &gt;&gt; they believe the same word that we are
[0:44] reading this morning.
[0:46] &gt;&gt; William Brandon, the prophet William
[0:47] Brandham, he did not preach any other
[0:50] words. Everything he preached was just
[0:53] in this Bible because he said that
[0:55] everything Paul preached I have preached
[0:58] the same message.
[1:00] So why is there no fruit in your life?
[1:07] &gt;&gt; You have to make yourself ready. The
[1:09] coming of the Lord is at hand.
[1:14] It it pains me to feel that there are
[1:18] some people you sitting here very
[1:20] comfortable
[1:22] living in sin as if nothing is like as
[1:24] if they'll keep living forever
[1:30] and this morning I can feel the spirit
[1:32] of God groaning and and crying out for
[1:34] those people.
[1:36] You know the prophet says you only go to
[1:38] hell because of yourself
[1:41] because God is going to do everything he
[1:43] can to save you.
[1:46] &gt;&gt; Because he the Bible says he doesn't
[1:47] want anyone to perish.
[1:52] You only go to to hell because of
[1:54] yourself.
[1:57] &gt;&gt; The prophet says that God doesn't judge
[1:59] you for falling
[2:02] but he blames you because you refuse to
[2:04] take his accepted way.
[2:07] What is way is the name of the Lord
[2:09] Jesus Christ.
[2:12] I I understand sometimes there are times
[2:14] that in your heart you want to do what's
[2:16] right
[2:18] &gt;&gt; and then you end up falling and you have
[2:21] this certain addiction that you keep
[2:22] falling over all the time but in your
[2:25] heart you really desire to be closer to
[2:27] God.
[2:30] You know the prophet preach on the
[2:31] message uh why are so many people tossed
[2:34] about?
[2:36] And in that message it says that there
[2:38] are some Christians. They are
[2:40] Christians.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; The prophecies they are Christians. But
[2:44] then um they keep finding themselves
[2:46] falling short all the time. No
[2:49] victories,
[2:53] weak Christians.
[2:55] The prophet says the difference is
[2:56] because they are not living in the
[2:58] holies of holies. They are not in the
[3:00] shikina glory. They are not in that
[3:03] place where God has put his name. I'm
[3:06] inviting you this morning if you are
[3:08] struggling.
[3:09] You know, don't give up. You know, don't
[3:12] give up. Get on your knees. You know,
[3:14] God say, "Lord, I surrender everything
[3:16] to you. Jesus, I've tried everything I
[3:19] can as a man. I've done everything that
[3:23] I can. You know, but now I give it all
[3:26] to you, Lord. I give these addictions to
[3:28] you. I give this fear of drinking to
[3:31] you. I give the spirit the spirit of
[3:33] laziness to you. I give the spirit of
[3:35] beating my wife to you. I want to be a
[3:37] better Christian. I want to be a better
[3:39] Christian, but I keep falling. Lord, I
[3:42] want to serve you more. I want to read
[3:43] my Bible more.
[3:45] I give it all to you. The Bible says
[3:47] after you've done all you can,
[3:51] after you've done all you can, stand.
[3:55] Oh Jesus, this morning I've done all I
[3:57] can. I'm feeling like I want to give up.
[4:01] How many people sometimes you feel like
[4:02] you want to give up?
[4:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, why is it so hard for me to live a
[4:07] life as a Christian?
[4:09] &gt;&gt; Lord, am do am I not loved? Do you not
[4:12] care about me? Brothers, I'm not just
[4:14] preaching to you. I'm preaching things
[4:15] that I've experienced myself.
[4:18] I've gotten times where I wanted to give
[4:20] up. I've gotten times where I felt like
[4:22] God didn't care about me.
[4:25] But I'm telling you this morning that
[4:27] God has your names written in the palm
[4:29] of his hand.
[4:31] &gt;&gt; He can never forget you. If you are his,
[4:34] you will never be lost. Just keep
[4:37] walking. Just keep walking in that
[4:39] stairs until you reach a higher
[4:42] dimension. The problem is that you are
[4:44] stopping. The moment he says, "Lord, I
[4:48] give up.
[4:49] Lord, I give up. I want to give up." You
[4:51] are stopping. The prophet says that's a
[4:53] mistake you make. We're talking about
[4:56] rapture. The Bible says Enoch walked
[4:59] with God.
[5:01] &gt;&gt; So why are you stopping?
[5:03] &gt;&gt; Keep walking.
[5:05] &gt;&gt; Don't let the things that you fall
[5:06] hinder you. We read that the Bible says
[5:09] the righteous run into thy name and he's
[5:11] safe.
[5:13] The
[5:15] refuge.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; The prophet tells us that the righteous
[5:16] man is that person that um when you when
[5:20] you fall, you get back up.
[5:24] Get up.
[5:26] What did you do yesterday? Don't feel
[5:27] down.
[5:29] This morning, God is telling you, get
[5:31] up. Continue your walk as a Christian.
[5:40] Psalm 34:3 says, "Oh, magnify the Lord
[5:43] with me and let us exalt his name
[5:45] together."
[5:49] Together. When we come into the church,
[5:51] we should have one purpose
[5:54] is to exalt his name.
[5:57] And then how do you exalt your his name?
[6:00] &gt;&gt; You notice your brother there has fallen
[6:01] short.
[6:03] &gt;&gt; You don't pick up the phone and you call
[6:05] someone else and be like, "Hey, did you
[6:06] hear what happened there?
[6:10] If you don't have the courage to go to
[6:12] that brother and talk to him yourself,
[6:14] then set your mouth and get on your
[6:16] knees and pray
[6:18] because we exalt his name together.
[6:22] The worst thing is there are even
[6:23] believers sometimes,
[6:26] a brother or a sister in the church
[6:28] falls short
[6:31] and you pick up the phone and you call
[6:32] someone else who's not even a believer.
[6:37] Who are you glorifying?
[6:39] Let us exalt his name together.
[6:44] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that uh there is
[6:46] therefore now no condemnation to them
[6:49] that are in Moses.
[6:57] No condemnation for them that are in
[7:00] Christ.
[7:03] So if you feeling condemnation, maybe
[7:05] you're not in Christ
[7:08] because the word cannot lie then get in
[7:10] Christ so that you don't feel the
[7:12] condemnation
[7:17] every
[7:19] don't let let us never ever take
[7:21] anything away from God for what God has
[7:23] done for us.
[7:27] &gt;&gt; I'll read this one quote real quick. The
[7:28] prophet says in the message God's chosen
[7:30] place of worship paragraph 49
[7:33] He said a man called me not long ago in
[7:36] in Texas. He said,
[7:40] "Mr. Brother,
[7:42] if if your name if your name is not on
[7:44] our church book,
[7:47] you cannot go to heaven."
[7:50] That's a that's the attitude of a lot of
[7:52] people.
[7:54] Unfortunately, even in this message,
[7:57] if you don't go to our church, you
[8:00] cannot go to
[8:02] our pastor is the only pastor.
[8:06] &gt;&gt; That's why sometimes you even go other
[8:08] places and they want to start an
[8:09] extension.
[8:12] Because only if you listen to our pastor
[8:15] that you will go to heaven.
[8:19] The prophet says, "Would you ever think
[8:21] of that?"
[8:23] He says, "Don't you believe such a thing
[8:25] as that?"
[8:27] Your prophet is telling you that they
[8:30] think you have to belong to this to that
[8:32] certain church or you cannot go to
[8:34] heaven.
[8:38] The word tells us that's wrong.
[8:41] Amen.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; To believe that is Antichrist.
[8:47] I say this, if you believe such a
[8:49] spirit, you are lost.
[8:53] It's right there. It's a prophet saying
[8:54] that.
[8:57] &gt;&gt; Why? Because salvation is not in a
[9:00] church.
[9:01] &gt;&gt; Salvation is only in one name.
[9:05] The prophet says he put it in his son
[9:10] Jesus when he and his son became one.
[9:16] Amen.
[9:18] &gt;&gt; You know, get the people to Christ.
[9:24] &gt;&gt; Don't get the people to, you know, like
[9:27] sometime I I even I heard of of this one
[9:30] song like they even talk about the whole
[9:32] song is talking about the prophet's
[9:34] weapon like the prophet the prophet's
[9:36] rifle.
[9:43] Like what are we doing?
[9:46] I don't recall in a psalm any songs in a
[9:48] psalm talking about just any other
[9:51] weapons as the main theme of the song
[9:56] [Music]
[9:57] &gt;&gt; brothers I'll read a quote where the
[9:58] prophet says that
[10:00] &gt;&gt; the devil is woripped in religious
[10:03] places now
[10:07] &gt;&gt; and we do it unaware sometimes
[10:13] you know talking about the prophet's
[10:15] weapon. And there's another song I know
[10:17] I've heard
[10:19] &gt;&gt; like those song is just William like
[10:22] just from the beginning to the end
[10:25] &gt;&gt; who is glorified
[10:31] &gt;&gt; William Prophet William Brandon wouldn't
[10:33] want that
[10:35] &gt;&gt; because he says that his purpose is to
[10:37] point you to Calvary
[10:40] &gt;&gt; and he says pointing you to anything
[10:42] outside of Calvary is a failure.
[10:47] We don't come here just to to know all
[10:48] the stories that happened.
[10:51] And unfortunately, there are some people
[10:53] they know more stories of the prophet
[10:55] than they even know of Jesus Christ.
[11:01] Sometime you go to church a church and a
[11:04] visitor comes in the church,
[11:06] &gt;&gt; they go out of the church just knowing
[11:08] more about a name William Brown than
[11:10] even Jesus.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; Nothing against them. the name William
[11:14] Brandon.
[11:17] We need the message of the prophet in
[11:18] order to make it to the rapture and we
[11:20] are grateful for God for the message.
[11:22] But what is the message?
[11:25] You know what is the message?
[11:28] You know we keep saying we believe the
[11:29] message brothers when you say you
[11:31] believe the message it's not I believe
[11:33] in William Brham. No, I believe in the
[11:36] message that he preached
[11:38] which the message is Jesus Christ
[11:42] points the people back to Jesus Christ.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; I I I did I did a research. You know a
[11:54] lot of people they like those kind those
[11:55] kind of people
[11:58] they they used to they like to use this
[12:00] statement. Oh what about Moses in the
[12:01] Bible? They used to always refer Moses
[12:03] Moses. Moses.
[12:05] Well, I did some research
[12:08] and I saw that in the Old Testament,
[12:11] the name that is mentioned the most
[12:13] throughout the entire Old Testament
[12:16] &gt;&gt; is Yahweh or Elohim.
[12:20] And to even go further in the entire
[12:24] Bible,
[12:26] including the Old Testament and the New
[12:28] Testament,
[12:29] &gt;&gt; the human name that is mentioned the
[12:31] most out more than any other name is the
[12:34] name of Jesus.
[12:36] &gt;&gt; Go do your research. You'll find it.
[12:39] Jesus comes the first place and I
[12:42] believe the name David comes the second
[12:44] and then Moses third.
[12:47] So why there's no it's not it's not just
[12:49] in vain that God kept repeating the name
[12:52] of Jesus.
[12:57] &gt;&gt; Let's put things in the proper place.
[13:02] &gt;&gt; William Brham is the prophet of God for
[13:04] this age.
[13:05] &gt;&gt; He is not to be worshiped.
[13:09] &gt;&gt; And when I say worship I don't say oh in
[13:10] the name of William. No. Sometimes the
[13:12] way you you talk about the prophet can
[13:14] seem as if you are worshiping the
[13:16] prophet.
[13:18] &gt;&gt; When you make everything seem as if it
[13:20] was the prophet himself doing that
[13:22] instead of God doing that through the
[13:23] prophet.
[13:26] &gt;&gt; The prophet says I don't he doesn't want
[13:28] to take any credit for it.
[13:32] All credits goes to Jesus Christ.
[13:36] All credits goes to Jesus Christ.
[13:40] And even in our lives, we want to make
[13:43] sure that we give all the credits to
[13:44] Jesus Christ. When the minister, all
[13:47] they talk is just me, me, me, me. That's
[13:49] not the spirit of God.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God is a jealous spirit.
[13:54] And he will not share his glory with
[13:56] anyone.
[13:59] There is security in the name of Jesus.
[14:02] There is safety in the name of Jesus
[14:04] Christ.
[14:06] It doesn't matter which church you go
[14:08] to. Imagine if you had put your trust in
[14:10] a church.
[14:13] &gt;&gt; Then what happens when you go outside
[14:14] there
[14:16] when the demons follow you there? Is
[14:17] your church with you outside?
[14:22] When you go to work, is your church with
[14:24] you at work? Is your pastor with you at
[14:27] work?
[14:29] Is the prophet William Brandon with you
[14:30] at work? Prophet
[14:36] the prophet passed away already in 1965.
[14:40] &gt;&gt; But he said, "You may kill the
[14:43] messenger,
[14:46] but you will never kill the message.
[14:49] The message will live on."
[14:52] So the me what is the message? The
[14:53] message says, "I will never leave you."
[14:58] Do you understand what I mean? Never.
[15:03] Even when you backslid, you backslide,
[15:07] I will not leave you. You know, he said
[15:09] never. He didn't put, oh, unless if you
[15:11] have this condition.
[15:14] The Bible, the prophet says once God
[15:16] saves you, he saved you all once and for
[15:18] all.
[15:20] So why put in a I want to put in a my
[15:23] trust in someone that is with me
[15:24] everywhere.
[15:30] We want to lift up the name of Jesus
[15:32] Christ.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; There's a song that says in the name of
[15:37] Jesus,
[15:40] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus, we have the
[15:41] victory. You know, in the name of Jesus,
[15:46] Satan, you have to flee.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, Satan, this
[15:51] morning, you have to flee
[15:54] in the name of Jesus. We have the
[15:56] victories. The battle that we kept
[15:58] falling all the time. The battles that
[16:01] we kept falling under all the time. But
[16:03] in the name of Jesus, we have the
[16:06] victory.
[16:08] I want you to say that with your own
[16:09] mouth. In the name of Jesus, I have the
[16:12] victory.
[16:13] You You need to start claiming that
[16:15] name. The more you claim the name of
[16:17] Jesus, the more victories you keep
[16:19] having. Why? Because when you call on
[16:22] when you claim the name of Jesus, you
[16:24] call on Jesus. And when Jesus comes, he
[16:28] says, "Oh, brother, sit down. Let me
[16:30] fight your battles for you now." And
[16:33] once Jesus fights your battle, I
[16:35] reassure you this morning that he's
[16:37] never lost the battle. Oh, Jesus has
[16:40] never lost the battle. It doesn't matter
[16:43] the size of the battle. My God is bigger
[16:45] than the battles. It doesn't matter the
[16:48] size of my problems. My God is bigger
[16:51] than my problems.
[16:52] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter the size of what I
[16:54] need.
[16:55] &gt;&gt; My God is bigger than what I need.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; You got to believe that your God is
[17:01] bigger.
[17:04] Your God is bigger than anything.
[17:07] God will only be as big to you as you
[17:09] make him.
[17:11] If to you God is small like that, then
[17:13] you will keep losing all the time.
[17:18] We have the victory in the name of
[17:20] Jesus.
[17:22] &gt;&gt; When you come in the name of Jesus,
[17:25] &gt;&gt; no weapons formed against you will
[17:27] prosper.
[17:29] No weapon, it doesn't matter if it's an
[17:31] atomic weapon,
[17:35] the the things that Satan throws at you.
[17:39] When we come in the name of Jesus,
[17:43] it will not prosper.
[17:46] It will not prosper but you will
[17:49] prosper. You know because it says I know
[17:51] the plans I have for you.
[17:54] &gt;&gt; The plans not to harm you but to prosper
[17:58] you.
[18:00] Oh I I want to prosper. I want to
[18:02] prosper in my finances. I want to
[18:04] prosper in my life with God. I want to
[18:06] prosper my the way I lead my family.
[18:10] But you got to take the name of the Lord
[18:12] Jesus with you.
[18:15] Don't never forget that name.
[18:18] &gt;&gt; There was one man in the Bible in in the
[18:20] Bible, his name is David.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; David took the name of Jesus with you in
[18:25] the battle against Goliath.
[18:28] &gt;&gt; There was a challenge that came in front
[18:30] of David.
[18:32] And all the children of Israel were
[18:34] scared of Goliath.
[18:36] I wonder if that's us this morning.
[18:41] &gt;&gt; Goliath kept on making fun of God.
[18:45] and they were all afraid.
[18:48] You know, I wonder if that's us this
[18:49] morning.
[18:51] What is that golite in in your life that
[18:54] keeps making fun of your living God?
[18:57] What is that golite in your life that
[18:59] makes fun of the God of this message?
[19:01] I know the God of this message is real.
[19:04] The God of this message is not just a
[19:06] story. He's a reality. And he's actually
[19:09] right here this morning, you know. Who
[19:11] is that Goliath that's challenging the
[19:13] the living God?
[19:19] &gt;&gt; In 1 Samuel 17:45, the David says, "Then
[19:24] then said David to the Philistine,
[19:27] &gt;&gt; that cometh to me with a sword
[19:32] and with a spear
[19:34] and with a shield." Verse 45,
[19:37] you know, but I come to thee in the name
[19:41] of the Lord of hosts,
[19:44] &gt;&gt; the God of the armies of Israel,
[19:48] the God of the armies of Israel, whom
[19:49] thou has defied,
[19:52] Satan, I'm serving you. And notice this
[19:54] morning, you know, you have challenged
[19:57] the army of God.
[19:59] You get the people of God so weary. They
[20:02] come to church tired. You disturb their
[20:05] mind. Instead of focusing on the
[20:06] preaching, they are thinking of
[20:08] something else.
[20:10] You have challenged the spirit of God.
[20:13] You may come with all the tactics you
[20:15] want. You may come with a sword. You may
[20:18] come with a spirit. But this morning,
[20:22] I come in the name of the Lord Jesus
[20:24] Christ. And I challenge you. And I say
[20:28] this morning, we will cut off your head,
[20:30] Satan.
[20:31] I believe that this morning the devil
[20:33] will be cut off.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; I believe that his head will be cut off.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; I believe that you will walk out of this
[20:40] place free.
[20:42] Satan, you better hear me.
[20:47] &gt;&gt; This day, verse 46,
[20:51] this day will the Lord deliver thee into
[20:53] my hand.
[20:56] And not my brother, but I will smite
[21:00] thee.
[21:02] So tell the devil right now, that devil
[21:05] that's been tormenting you for years,
[21:08] that devil that's been tormenting you
[21:09] forever,
[21:11] tell him that this day. This day the
[21:14] Lord will deliver thee in my hand.
[21:18] And I will smite thee. You need to stop
[21:21] saying that with your own mouth. I will
[21:24] not smite for you. You will smite him
[21:26] yourself.
[21:29] You notice he doesn't say God will smite
[21:32] thee.
[21:33] He says, "I will smite thee." But later
[21:36] on you say, he says, "The battle is not
[21:38] yours, but it's the Lord's."
[21:41] Why? Because it's not I that the says,
[21:43] "He that is in you is greater than he
[21:46] that's in the world."
[21:49] When Christ is in you, the hope of
[21:51] glory,
[21:53] you can tell the devil that this day
[21:57] &gt;&gt; I will smite thee.
[22:01] &gt;&gt; The the gospel is the demonstration of
[22:04] the gospel. I mean of the the gospel is
[22:06] a demonstration of the power of Jesus
[22:07] Christ.
[22:10] &gt;&gt; I can't I don't want to preach a Jesus
[22:12] of just a theory.
[22:15] I'm talking about the name of Jesus this
[22:17] morning
[22:19] &gt;&gt; and that that name has power
[22:23] &gt;&gt; this morning. There's nothing that can
[22:25] all the afflictions that you came with.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; You don't have to walk out the same.
[22:31] If you take the name of the Lord Jesus
[22:33] Christ, you will see that that that
[22:34] demon leave you.
[22:38] Because if you just go out the same,
[22:39] then why serve God?
[22:41] &gt;&gt; Why serve a God that won't even fight
[22:43] for me?
[22:48] Jesus is real.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus is real.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, Satan, you heard me. Jesus is real.
[22:57] Hallelujah. And Jesus is in this
[23:00] building.
[23:01] And I rebuke you in the name of Jesus
[23:03] Christ.
[23:05] I pray that you leave the hand. You you
[23:06] get away from God's people.
[23:10] In the name of Jesus Christ,
[23:14] the Bible says every knee shall bow in
[23:16] the name of Jesus Christ.
[23:19] Satan, you must bow because in the name
[23:22] of Jesus Christ, every tongue will
[23:24] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[23:30] In your life, you want to confess that
[23:31] Jesus is Lord.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; But how do you confess that he's Lord?
[23:36] It's only if he's been lo to you.
[23:40] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want you to manifest yourself to
[23:42] me. How many times have I been here
[23:44] giving testimonies after testimonies?
[23:48] But I don't say just to to talk about
[23:50] myself.
[23:51] The reason why I give testimonies is to
[23:53] help you know that God, if God can do it
[23:55] for me, he can do it for you.
[23:58] To let you know that God is not dead.
[24:00] He's alive this morning. He's alive and
[24:03] well. You know the Muhammad's grave is
[24:06] still closed over there. You know, all
[24:10] those other prophets, their graves are
[24:12] still there.
[24:13] You know, like all those gods. But we
[24:15] have a God whose grave is open.
[24:18] And you can't even you have an
[24:20] invitation to go to that grave as proof.
[24:23] There is no one there. Why? We have the
[24:26] only God who has risen from the dead.
[24:30] Jesus is not dead. He's alive and well
[24:32] this morning.
[24:34] So why continue in suffering?
[24:36] Why is my people crying?
[24:39] Why are they suffering when I've laid
[24:42] everything here in the world for them?
[24:44] Why?
[24:46] Why don't you have the Holy Ghost? We
[24:49] need to have more Holy Ghost powers in
[24:51] this building. We need to have more
[24:52] revivals.
[24:55] The We need to see the power of God
[24:57] here.
[24:59] Why are we not seeing that?
[25:02] May God be merciful to us.
[25:06] You know, Goliath challenged the spirit
[25:08] of God.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; And you notice David had five stones.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Five stones in his bag. The prophet says
[25:18] those stones represents Jesus s.
[25:22] Five stones. The name of Jesus Christ.
[25:24] David knew that you have challenged God.
[25:27] But with the name of Jesus Christ,
[25:30] nothing shall stand against thee.
[25:32] Nothing will stand against me when I
[25:35] come in the name of Jesus Christ. I know
[25:37] that I will have the victory because I
[25:40] have the name of Jesus with you.
[25:42] Brothers, take the name of Jesus with
[25:44] you. When you go out there on the
[25:46] streets, take the name of Jesus with
[25:47] you. When the temptation comes your way,
[25:50] take the name of Jesus with you.
[25:53] Temptation will come. But we fall
[25:55] because we don't take the name of Jesus
[25:57] other spirits not myself. Every time I
[26:00] have such a bad spirit come on me. You
[26:02] know every time I mention the name of
[26:05] Jesus Christ and I rebuke that spirit or
[26:07] I thought he leaves. God is my witness.
[26:10] Many times we fall because we don't call
[26:12] on Jesus.
[26:14] When you call on him he's there to be
[26:15] found.
[26:17] Verse 477. And all this assembly shall
[26:21] know that the Lord saveth not with sword
[26:24] and spare, for the battle is the Lord,
[26:28] &gt;&gt; and he will give you into our hands.
[26:33] So this morning, I'm talking to the
[26:34] devil.
[26:36] This assembly,
[26:39] they will know that the Lord saveth.
[26:44] They will know. this assembly will know
[26:47] that the battle is the Lord.
[26:51] Hallelujah. Praise God. Don't let Satan
[26:53] bother you.
[26:55] Don't let Don't let him make you fear.
[26:58] He's just a He's just a bluff. The
[27:01] prophet says he's been stripped of
[27:02] everything at Calvary.
[27:05] Satan doesn't even have anything to harm
[27:06] you. He doesn't. Jesus making noise
[27:11] &gt;&gt; and we're exposing him this morning.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; But you remember there's another place
[27:17] the prophet says that
[27:19] &gt;&gt; the only time Satan has power over you
[27:24] &gt;&gt; is when you have unconfessed sins.
[27:29] There's not the prophet says they can
[27:30] pour as much oil as they want on you. It
[27:33] will do nothing if you hide that sin.
[27:37] What are you hiding?
[27:41] You think you think you hiding it from
[27:42] me? God can see
[27:46] what you be watching on your phone. You
[27:48] think God does doesn't see that
[27:51] the text message you send to someone?
[27:53] You think God doesn't see that?
[27:57] What is that that you think that God
[27:58] doesn't see?
[28:02] &gt;&gt; But it's just as simple as you just get
[28:04] on your knees. Lord, forgive me.
[28:07] It's not that complicated.
[28:09] Why are you letting Satan still have a
[28:11] grip in your life through unconfessing?
[28:19] Verse 51 says, "Therefore, David ran and
[28:22] stood up on the Philistine.
[28:25] He took his sword.
[28:27] He drew it out of the sheath thereof and
[28:31] slew him and cut off and cut off his
[28:33] head therewith."
[28:35] And I love this.
[28:37] And when the Philistines saw their
[28:39] champion was dead, they fled.
[28:45] When the Philistines saw that their
[28:47] champion was dead, the person that they
[28:50] looked up to was dead, they fled. Well,
[28:53] Satan, I'm here to point you to
[28:55] something. Go read Revelation chapter
[28:58] 20. Your champion is dead there. The
[29:01] Bible says he's thrown into the lake of
[29:03] fire. So therefore, you better be on the
[29:06] run. Demons, you better be on the run
[29:08] already, you know, because our champion,
[29:11] the Lord Jesus Christ, you know, he's
[29:13] here fighting our battles.
[29:16] Don't fight your battles yourself.
[29:20] He's a strong tower.
[29:24] He's a strong tower. I'm going to uh
[29:26] wrap up real quick here.
[29:29] The prophet says in the message, this
[29:31] great warrior David,
[29:35] he says, "Where is the Goliath?"
[29:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "Who is the Goliath, Brother
[29:41] Brano?"
[29:43] He says, "That cancer that's eating you
[29:45] up,
[29:47] &gt;&gt; that tumor that's hanging on you,
[29:51] &gt;&gt; them cataracts on your eyes,
[29:53] &gt;&gt; that crippled arm,
[29:58] &gt;&gt; everything looks at it and says it can't
[30:00] be done.
[30:03] That thing that like it seems like it's
[30:05] impossible to be done."
[30:08] &gt;&gt; The devil says you might as well quit
[30:11] believing.
[30:12] I wonder if Satan has told that to
[30:14] anyone this morning. The prophet is
[30:16] saying it's your Goliath.
[30:19] He says you might as well settle down
[30:21] because you can never uh no more get
[30:23] well.
[30:27] He says, "But the Christ that made you
[30:29] stop your drinking."
[30:35] I wonder I'll probably stop here for a
[30:37] minute.
[30:39] the Christ that made you stop your
[30:42] drinking.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; So what is the defense of brothers in
[30:47] this church drinking alcohol?
[30:50] &gt;&gt; I mean we claim to believe the same
[30:52] message.
[30:54] Maybe come Simeon and Sime show me a
[30:56] different message than this message.
[31:00] Because we all call ourselves message
[31:02] believers. I wonder if we are believing
[31:05] a different message.
[31:08] Oh no, if I just I can't drink just a
[31:10] little bit.
[31:13] That first of all, that's a lie of the
[31:14] devil because you will stop by drinking
[31:17] a little bit and you keep drinking more
[31:19] until you find yourself drunk. Then who
[31:21] do you glorify?
[31:25] But you have to know you cannot stop it
[31:27] on your own.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; The Christ that made you stop your
[31:33] drinking.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; You got to give it up to Christ. You got
[31:37] to give it up to God. Lord, I can't
[31:39] overcome drinking. You that the prophet
[31:42] is talking about help me to make to stop
[31:44] my drinking.
[31:53] Like you actually making fun of God. You
[31:55] just I don't get that. You just keep
[31:58] drinking
[31:59] &gt;&gt; and you are people get drunk and you
[32:02] come to church, you go to like I don't
[32:06] understand what is going on.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; What is going on?
[32:17] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "I have not shown to preach
[32:18] to you the gospel of Jesus Christ." I'm
[32:20] not going to be afraid to preach the
[32:21] gospel
[32:23] because this is the gospel that will set
[32:25] you free. And if you keep living in your
[32:28] drinking way, you will not make it to
[32:29] heaven.
[32:31] If you keep going in your drinking way,
[32:34] if you die right now, you go to hell.
[32:36] Why would you want to go to hell? The
[32:38] prophet says, "I don't even want my
[32:39] worst enemy to go to hell.
[32:43] You have no idea what hell is like.
[32:47] smoking,
[32:50] &gt;&gt; lying,
[32:51] &gt;&gt; stealing,
[32:54] talking about stealing.
[32:56] You You might say, "Oh, no, I don't
[32:57] steal." No, you steal from God when you
[32:59] don't pay your tithing.
[33:03] When God blesses you, he gives you a
[33:05] job. 10% of of it belongs to him.
[33:09] So, when you don't pay your tithing, you
[33:11] are stealing from God.
[33:18] But you remember it's like God that help
[33:20] you even pay your tithing.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; I've given you an before a testimony how
[33:25] one time I I needed money
[33:28] and then I was not I started not paying
[33:30] my tithing for some time
[33:33] and then u but in my heart I was like
[33:35] God help me to I want to pay my tithing
[33:38] and I was like God I promise you I'm
[33:39] going to start paying my tithing.
[33:42] And then one day I was just praying in
[33:43] that vegetable over there
[33:46] &gt;&gt; and then um I see someone message me
[33:50] says God spoke to me and told me to give
[33:52] you this money
[33:55] and the money that he gave me was
[33:56] exactly what I needed to pay my tithing.
[34:00] I took all that money and I just paid
[34:01] right away for tithing. I didn't even
[34:03] want to wait for another day. So if you
[34:05] are struggling pay your tithing, ask
[34:07] God.
[34:09] He will help you. He will help you stop
[34:11] your stealing, your lying.
[34:14] He saved you from a life of drunkenness.
[34:19] You know in person
[34:22] you know nothing is happens but just
[34:24] like that with God. There's no hazard
[34:27] because why did the prophet mention
[34:29] drinking the first time
[34:31] and he comes back again? He saved you
[34:34] from that life of drunkenness.
[34:38] When you read this, are you able to say
[34:39] also that God saved you from a life of
[34:41] drunkenness?
[34:46] &gt;&gt; If you're not, then you better repent.
[34:49] But that's why we come to church. The
[34:51] Bible says the the church is a house of
[34:53] correction.
[34:55] I don't mean to talk bad about anybody
[34:57] here because I myself have things that I
[35:00] struggle. I myself have things that I
[35:02] need God to help me with and I need your
[35:05] prayers. You know with the Bible says
[35:07] exalt his name together. This is a one
[35:09] body.
[35:10] We pray one for another
[35:13] &gt;&gt; and then I cannot see a devil here and
[35:15] just just let him be so comfortable. I
[35:18] don't like Satan to be comfortable.
[35:21] I don't like when Satan comes to church
[35:23] cuz the prophet says Satan comes to
[35:24] church.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; I don't like when he comes and he just
[35:27] comes comfortable sitting in the church.
[35:29] No, I want to make him uncomfortable.
[35:31] And I believe every Christian needs to
[35:33] make the devil uncomfortable.
[35:37] May God be merciful to us.
[35:40] How can you get drunk as a Christian?
[35:46] And you've never even been drunk in the
[35:47] spirit.
[35:50] Why?
[35:54] Then you will never want to be drunk in
[35:56] this world again.
[36:01] You know the same God that that saved
[36:02] you from drunkenness, from riing, from
[36:04] sin, and a devil's grave.
[36:08] God can do that for you.
[36:11] He can save you from your TB.
[36:13] He can save you from cancer.
[36:16] He's a He's a Goliath.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; Don't take his boast.
[36:22] Stand in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[36:25] and challenge him to a showdown.
[36:30] The prophet is saying,
[36:32] &gt;&gt; "You are struggling with the spirit of
[36:33] lying,
[36:35] all kind of spirits, drinking.
[36:39] He's telling you that he's just a
[36:40] Goliath and it's just a boast, but come
[36:44] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[36:47] challenge him to a showdown
[36:51] positionally in Christ.
[36:53] The believer know his position, he'll
[36:55] have it.
[36:58] And he says, "God's great spirit is
[37:01] here.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; And his holy ghost is ready to fall on
[37:06] anybody that will believe it.
[37:10] How many needs the Holy Ghost?"
[37:13] The prophet says his spirit, he's is
[37:16] here
[37:19] &gt;&gt; and is ready to fall on anybody that
[37:21] will believe it.
[37:26] Hey man, I'm finding I'm looking for a
[37:28] place where to wrap it up. Um,
[37:33] I'll I'll end up with this one question.
[37:37] Sorry for being long. So, in a message,
[37:40] the patriarch Abraham,
[37:43] the prophet says, "What did he do?
[37:47] He set out and he conquered sickness.
[37:51] There could be no sickness around him.
[37:54] Wherever sickness was, he conquered it.
[37:59] What did he do after he conquered it? He
[38:01] gave us the keys,
[38:03] saying, "Whatever you bind on earth, I
[38:06] will bind it in heaven." That's the
[38:09] royal seed of Abraham.
[38:12] The Holy Ghost in us now with the keys
[38:16] holding it to sickness.
[38:19] Sickness cannot stand in his presence.
[38:24] Verse 63
[38:26] also temptation.
[38:29] He was tempted in every manner like we
[38:32] was.
[38:36] I wonder if Jesus went he was he turned
[38:38] the wine into water into wine.
[38:44] The Bible says he was tempted in all
[38:46] manner like we was
[38:51] he he would he probably got tempted too
[38:55] in all manner. Every manner
[38:58] that's how he understand us.
[39:02] Then the prophet says what did he do?
[39:05] He conquered it. What did he say to us?
[39:08] Now he told us how to conquer it.
[39:11] resist the devil
[39:13] &gt;&gt; and he will flee from thee.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; So when does like like I'm really trying
[39:21] to help you this morning. I'm not trying
[39:22] to go hard at you,
[39:24] &gt;&gt; but I'm trying to help you overcome the
[39:25] spirit of drinking
[39:29] when you see a cup of alcohol
[39:33] cuz I mean unless if in your heart you
[39:35] really don't even want to be set free at
[39:37] all, then that's your own problem.
[39:39] But if you want the Lord to help you,
[39:41] he's helping you right here.
[39:43] You see a cup of alcohol.
[39:46] You know, the prophet says resisted.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; And there's another place say, what does
[39:51] resisting means? It means to simply turn
[39:54] away from it.
[39:57] You see alcohol here,
[40:00] I'm not going to take it. But don't you
[40:02] think it's just going to be that first
[40:03] time? I'm not going to take it anymore.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; He's going to come again.
[40:09] You know, I've had moments where you do
[40:11] something and you leave. You start
[40:13] regretting. You're like, "Ah, why did I
[40:14] not do it?"
[40:19] &gt;&gt; The devil is not. He said Delilah with
[40:21] Samson. She kept going to Samson. She
[40:24] kept going to Samson.
[40:27] You see the first time you overcame.
[40:30] Don't rest. Satan is going to come
[40:32] again.
[40:34] He gives this time he gives you like he
[40:36] probably gives you to on a discount,
[40:40] you know, and your favorite alcohol
[40:42] drink.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; But every time you see that temptation,
[40:49] the prophet says, "Resist it." That
[40:51] means keep walking away from it. And one
[40:53] day you keep resisting, resisting. And
[40:56] one day you see alcohol, it doesn't even
[40:58] mean anything
[41:00] because that devil has fleeed from you.
[41:03] The prophet says that resist the devil
[41:05] and we flee from you.
[41:08] He conquered sickness for us.
[41:11] He conquered temptation for us.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; He's done it for us. He broke down the
[41:17] gate.
[41:19] He took the key away from the temper,
[41:23] handed over to the believer
[41:25] and said,
[41:27] "If now this is what God is saying, what
[41:29] Jesus is telling you
[41:32] If Satan tempts you,
[41:35] &gt;&gt; so that means he knows that Satan will
[41:37] tempt you.
[41:39] Resist him.
[41:42] Amen.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; And he will free flee from you.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Oh my. The prophet insist again resist
[41:49] him.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; So it's something that he comes the
[41:51] first time. No Satan, I don't want no
[41:53] Satan. No Satan. One day,
[41:57] you know, he's just going to be I'm so
[41:58] tired. He's just going to go to someone
[42:00] else.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; He conquered both death and hell.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Uh he he he conquered he conquered
[42:11] sickness. He conquered death. He
[42:13] conquered hell.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; He conquered the grave
[42:17] and he conquered temptation.
[42:20] Now we are more than conquerors through
