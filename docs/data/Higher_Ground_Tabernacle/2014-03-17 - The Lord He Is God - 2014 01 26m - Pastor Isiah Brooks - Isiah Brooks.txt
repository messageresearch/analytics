turn this thing on here surely we are blessed amen we're not going to prong the time we'll sing perhaps afterwards as we stand Amen in the word of God we appreciate your prayers had a wonderful time there in Arizona the weather was nice amen the services were nice and uh we appreciate everything that God allows us to do we're going to ask that you turn with us to uh uh Second Timothy 3 and 1 second Timothy 3:1 and from second Timothy we'll go to psalms 27 glad to see everybody here this morning 2 Timothy 3:1 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come okay psalms 27 and5 and it reads for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion Amen in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me amen He Shall Set me upon a rock let us pray father God we come

things that you are doing and the things that you will do all of your promises are yay for the Bride of Jesus and we thank you here this morning and we pray that you just have free course forgive us Lord of anything we may have said or done cleanse us from all unrighteousness Lord that you would have Supreme preeminence in our lives Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated amen I trust you come to have a great time in the Lord amen always know that when you come to the house of God uh you come to have a feast right it's not something where uh you know one thing about a a feast this one is that the table has already been spread amen and all you've got to do is come and Dy amen We Know by the grace of God that we are in a time uh where we must persevere amen I find out and I'm going to tell you something that you might be aware of and you may not be but there's a great cooling off Lord and I don't know whether it's a cooling or dying but I find out that among uh those of us who claim to be the message I think right now as I have gone from one Church to the other I have found amen that people seem to be losing their strength or or or their Joy oh Lord their worship uh you know and I just believe that if you're going to do something you ought to give it 100% amen ain't no use in just playing with God you might as well just do it hard wholeheartedly or or not at all amen I I just believe by the grace of God that people have confused what worship really is and and I find out that that's why they don't have no strength because the Bible said he inhabits the praise of his people amen and as I said before I left here amen that that when you come and you find that people don't have joy is because they haven't been in the presence of God Amen the Bible said in the presence of the Lord there is fullness of joy Jo amen Joy is not being happy no amen Joy is is something like Jesus described a well a well of water an aan well springing up amen it is something that can't be held down or held back y'all hear what I'm saying it is something that automatically comes up out of you without an effort amen amen now you might as well you want to put on your seat belts or you want to loose them however you want to do it but here we are today and I find out that if we don't have joy and that's not my subject tonight I'm working with joy because I find out amen that Christians are some of the most saddest people oh Lord in the world and it's it's not supposed to be that way amen it's only because you and I are not going to the god of Joy hello if we don't have peace at mind is because we did not go to get it amen because the Bible says if we keep our minds stead on him he will grant us perfect peace so we can't blame God for our situations amen now remember I said just a couple of messages ago your thoughts are the thing that brought you here in other words wherever you are in your life today is because of what you think of yourself come on somebody it doesn't matter what you think of yourself is what you are today if you are a failure because you have allowed your mind to convince you amen that you are a failure amen if you're going to be victorious you must take the thoughts of God Amen that's it it is what God thinks about you and not what you think about you amenl y'all hear what I'm saying if we would take the thoughts of God on what God thinks about us hallelujah and what he has declared by his word we who we are oh my we'll be the happiest people in the world but we have allowed Satan's gospel his poison in our minds Hallelujah his poison in our minds have caused us to be sad down depress you name it it is what you received remember your mind is a wound and you can allow your mind to receive positive seeds or negative negative seeds come on somebody hopefully this morning we will allow God to implant some perfect positive seeds in our minds I'm not just talking about in your head I'm talking about your heart's mind you've been chosen for this time am not to be defeated you have been chosen to be more than a conqueror now I don't I know about you I don't care how many mistakes I make what it looks like because God is not allowing me to get to heaven on my righteousness I am getting to heaven on the righteousness of God Jesus Christ and my life is [Applause] hid in him now it doesn't mean that we're going to go out and do whatever we want to do and expect to go to heaven but those Christians true Christians don't mean to make mistakes and immediately after they make them they make them right amen come on somebody turn with me to Psalms 143 and9 I I I don't want to take too much time this morning but I I want you to see by the grace of God uh uh what what the remedy is here we hear Jesus Christ is a double cure now I'm telling you something because the pressure that we are now experiencing will not get easier sir as we approach the coming of the Lord it is going to get greater amen y'all hear what I'm saying let me say it again so so I can get at least more amens because if the amen is in you you can amen the word if it's true the pressure in this time is not going to get lighter amen it is going to get greater amen now you the how can I say it the Bible says amen that you are the cream of the crop amen he in other words let me put it like he said it he saved the best for last amen if you were not able to penetrate a make it through this age God would have chosen you to be in some other age but because he knew you could handle this age he put you in this age Lord to be an overcomer amen oh come on somebody Psalms 143 and I'm glad to be in this age amen hallelujah I wouldn't have made it in the age amen with the knives and the swords yes I'm glad to be in this age Hallelujah come on somebody amen Psalms 143 and9 it says Deliver Me Oh Lord from my enemies I flee unto thee to hide me see I don't have no other Hiding Place from my enemies he's the only only one that I can go to and be hidden am Jesus Christ is the only one amen that I can run to hide me in the rock or in the Cliffs of the rock until the storm of Wrath be pass amen amen oh my is that all right now we look at this thing and what brother Brooks you know our shelter is in the he is our shelter in the time of storm but my subject this morning is something that you and I should know the Lord he is God Amen that's one thing that God is going to bring to you he is God I guarantee you everybody in hell can tell you that God is God Amen yes sir I don't care if they believed in Buddha I don't care if they believed in Allah hello I don't care if they believed in all these other things I can truly say to you everybody in hell knows that Jesus Christ is God Amen he made sure even in the anian day when he when he came down Jesus himself after the resurrection amen or during the during his death let put it this way I don't want to get ahead of myself the Bible said he descended into hell that's right and he preach to those souls in prison why because he wanted them to know he was God Amen Hallelujah he went down into the low region of hell and he said listen I'm the man you rejected amen it wasn't Noah you rejected I'm the one oh Lord hallelujah it wasn't Moses you rejected I'm the one amen see they were just my mouthpieces amen but I'm the one that preached to you by way of these vessels come on somebody and they knew without a Shadow of Doubt like I said everybody in hell you know knows Jesus Christ is God except a lot of believers hello so many Christians don't really know oh you believe it but I say no experience hello experience amen that he is God hallelujah if we could understand that he is God it'll make your whole world different amen it'll change you it'll transform you amen from what you are now to what his purpose is for you amen now that's the Point that's where we're going and my my theme if I was to have a theme would be breaking from under the pressure cuz all of us are under pressure somewhere somehow but you can't allow that pressure to remain amen it is there for you to break through amen and to be seen of who you really are amen coming from the message we have seen his star the prophet of God says darker it is the better the light shines sometimes just a small light where there's much light is not noticed but the darker it gets that small light was shine that much stronger am and remember that there's no Darkness can exist in the presence of light amen light is so much more powerful than Darkness let me put it hey if you can't get that something's wrong with you light is so much more powerful than Darkness it cannot stand in his presence amen amen hallelujah so if you are allowing the light of God to shine through you it makes you a conqueror of all all Darkness huh hallelujah oh come on somebody light is so much more powerful than Darkness until it cannot stand in his presence Darkness cannot stand when the Sun starts to shine because the sun is so much greater the sunlight that is just pressing the darkness out and it's no more and this Dark World some day is going to turn to all light amen when Jesus Christ the son of righteousness shall come again amen then we'll have no more Darkness amen until that time just as we look out at night time and see the moon shining is that all right the moon and the son is husband and wife amen hallelujah some so you got to realize as long as the sun is shining and the moon has nothing in between it the Sun and the Moon amen there's nothing between the moon is going to shine Amen in other words it would become visible and in the absence of the Sun the moon reflects the light of the Sun to the Earth giving it a lesser light that we can see how to get around by the Moonlight until the sun shine rises again amen now here what oh come on somebody you and I must recognize if that moon is our type we have a job to do amen and our job is to reflect the Son of God that the world may see Jesus Lives amen amen amen amen come on somebody now I I'm feeling good here this morning so I'm going to preach if you don't even want to say Amen my point is amen if God is living on the inside of us there ought to be a Victorious life amen amen hallelujah hallelujah it's not like we didn't know perilous times was coming that's been written 2000 years ago and brothers and sisters we have arrived dangerous times Harsh Times Troublesome times Fierce times Savage times that's what that word uh uh perilous times mean harsh Savage men who are now Savage as if they know God at not at all and we're living in a hard time but nevertheless the pressure has been built for you yes sir amen oh come on come on come on Amen we look at this thing and job has such a hard time he says Lord he said I would you just hide me in the grave until the hard times pass over hide me in the grave Lord but don't forget me amen don't you feel like that sometimes Lord take me until that time of the rapture oh come on somebody it's the same thing oh my God I I I don't want to be a reflector of nothing else right remember brother Brandon tells the story about the man who was drunk in the alley and he the little boy goes and and he goes into the store and says man your greatest sign is laying down on the ground right has fallen he said the man come out he look he said no no my sign still there the little boy pointed to the drug and says no that's your greatest sign right there Hallelujah why you selling alcohol this man is under a total influence of what you selling that's the best sign you can get what about a Christian who's under the total influence of the Holy Ghost hallu oh it's not enough I can tell you how you came from Glory I can tell you how you were there in the mind of God I can tell you all of those great mysteries of God I can tell you how you are the expressed image of Jesus Christ in the flesh but what good is it if the life isn't there amen amen it's like putting a false label on a bottle y'all hear what I'm saying this thing is not a feeling it's a life Hallelujah Hard Times going to come oh my God I I just don't know how I'm going to make it you know I can barely make ends meat you'll never see a sparrow worried about tomorrow sir amen amen come on somebody you'll never see a sparrow worried about tomorrow losing his feathers because it's stressed out amen hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying the Bible said Don't Take No thoughts if I take care of the sparrow don't you know you mean more to me than the sparrow now come on somebody I can see a sparrow and he can eat eating and living I said what God taking care of him he's going to take care of me amen hallelujah oh my God I tell you what we look at this thing and you and I must understand by the grace of God that no matter what amen you know Salvation is something that God gives you I wish every everybody in here could see it like like it really is you know I don't think the preacher would have to struggle at times if you can really catch a hold to what you're working with that put it this way you know what we're working with it's like the man the people who the eight Souls on the Arc versus the millions that are not amen do you think those that were on the ark amen was regretting that they were no sir no sir I don't care how the Thunder flash how the Thunder rooll and how the lightning Flash not one time did they ever say I wish I was on this boat I don't know how smooth the ride was but I still believe there were more grateful people on the ark amen hallelujah hallelujah I don't like I tell my God all the time God I don't care what I have to suffer I don't care what I got to go through as long as I know you're there and I don't have the wonder about it why cuz he promised me I'll never leave you nor forsake you I will always be with you I don't care if I don't feel him none of my sisters might declare him to be there but his word declare he is amen thank you Lord hallelujah you got to go with the word folks yes sir amen you love the Lord amen Harsh Times you know why the Bible said Matthew 24:12 says and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold look that thing up you know what waxing cold means to breathe to blow to Cool by blowing you see the devil just don't put you all out all at one time he you know he blows how many tried to put out a candle sometimes the first blow don't get it right you blow again and each time you put more force behind it more air behind it because you want that wind to reach that candle now you look at this thing and you know you know how he blows on it oh you don't have to repent right now that's it you don't have to be saved right now you don't have to give up those bad habits amen amen amen huh oh come on somebody we know how the complexes are nobody don't love me nobody cares about me amen hallelujah come on somebody oh I'm so lonely little by little he blows on you amen hallelujah come on somebody little I little he blows on you and you think oh come on somebody let me tell just like I said the other day not long ago I said you know what one of the first signs of death striking a Believer is when they stop worshiping amen when you can't raise your hand when you can't clap your hand come on when you can't give sacrifices of Praise you're dying amen spiritually you're backsliding amen oh Lord oh come on I'm going to dance in here if nobody else dance Hallelujah why because I know My Savior Lives now he's not in heaven he's in [Music] me thank you Lord Hallelujah I tell you I get so stirred up oh my God especially around message people sometime it make you want to go go oh let me say it anyway sometime the Pentecostal got a little more fire than what we have oh Lord think about it if we can get what that fire they got amen with the truth that we got we'll be an invincible Army amen you said brother you shouldn't say that well brother Brandon said it was the same Holy Ghost yes sir yes sir amen same Holy Ghost maybe they don't have the truth of it but they'll put us as shame when it come to worship oh Lord God have mercy on our souls and then we'll easily say Pentecost us they can walk in this church and say I don't want that they dead up in there come on what what a what a report it ought to be so much fire in here when somebody break through that through that curtain they ought to repent on their KN knees amen Y come on somebody amen I I like referring to hell cuz I had a dream and I done told you about that dream God took me three levels of it there were young people there too all not just old people young some of them were young because they were rebellious to their families disrespectful to their moms and their dads Hallelujah praise in a Christian Home bitterness y'all hear what I'm saying oh oh hallelujah amen think about it young and old down in there amen categorized by your behavior and let me tell you something the demon that rules you now will rule you there if you don't get rid of it amen that's right I say that again the demon that rules you now will rule you there without rest there's no rest in Hell amen it's all weariness it's all tired oh come y'all don't know what I'm talking about cuz I said if this dream that I had be true you don't want to go there I have a burden for souls and let me tell you something you're going to hear about it too so I'm going to let you you know and I know the devil going to try to stop me but I'm getting I'm getting back on the street corners I can get more result from the street corner than I can get from a lot of churches oh Lord amen hello somebody and you say oh Brothers you shouldn't be rebuked I can't help it there's a fire on the inside and I'm not going to let the devil put it out a lot of people don't even believe in missionary work no more we've got a whole city that needs to be converted and you are the ones that God chose to do it amen you're the light in this city oh come on I'm putting it on you that's right because he's speaking through my mouth you are the light in this city and every one of us will give for the souls that we miss because we were dilatory lazy cooling off H help us Jesus even if you get 99.9 resisting you you still ought to tell about Jesus Hallelujah cuz he's worthy come on you was born under pressure huh come on somebody pressure you born in pressure you born out like I said the only way you didn't get here by alien ship you were born into this world Amen and in order to get into heaven you got to be born in there amen amen born in born out that's right y'all hear what I'm saying that is the only way you must be born again come on somebody oh let me move on by the great let you know why I said it I have to put it this way amen because every birth comes under pressure when that baby's in that womb guess what that world gets a little bit too small amen I think that's ought to be the way we ought to be feeling this world is getting too small for me amen amen I got to press my way into the other place Hallelujah come on I don't know how a baby actually feel but he goes through a traumatic time amen come on trying to press him way through the the the the womb of that mother has to be a traumatic time but he's got no other place no other way to go God Amen Hallelujah God fixed it the only way he could go amen is that way for a True Believer the only way you can go is that way amen when you come a teenager you think about being a teenager a lot of us don't forgot how hard it was we done forgot how difficult it was amen trying to be a man or a woman when you weren't yet there yet amen want to make your own decisions Hallelujah come on every one of us in here thought we were right 100% right when we were teenagers come on somebody it's the truth it is a hard transition come on somebody but it is something that God ordained amen amen and guess what he put parents over us yes amen he just let us be teenagers he put parents over us why so they could be the law for us so they could be the Holy Ghost for us until we come to maturity yes am you take a child that don't know what to do with a gun he kill himself with it that's right a teenager knows better amen most of them anyway come on somebody but when you become a man you realize and understand the purpose for a gun amen y'all hear what I'm saying am I making sense amen so it is a hard time it is oh come on a lot of us I tell you what amen oh come on how many of y'all know what I'm talking about you wanted to be a man so bad oh yes I can't hardly wait till my man I can't hardly wait till on my own now you wish you could go back right you see all the bills you see all the problems you see the stress life that your parents went through because as a child you don't see it y you got a teenager you don't see it food is on the table clothes on the back you don't see the bills you don't see none of that but now you become a man you think oh my God y'all hear what I'm saying I hope y'all understand what I'm saying this is so simple but my point is the stress of it the pressure of it is the thing that molds you that's right hallelujah thank you Lord it is the reason why you are who you are amen amen y'all hear what I'm saying amen look like like the prophet of God in in in Israel at the Red Sea he says Moses was born under persecution that's how they were killing all the babies in the time of Moses Jesus when he came they were killing all the babies to get him now watch this because if that's the truth what about our time amen the prophet call is the squeeze but you and I have no idea what we're getting ready to face amen if they were killing everything then to try to get to the real Royal seed what you think the devil he he knows no other way he knows no other way how are you doing Under Pressure oh my God I just I just don't know whether I'm going to make it and oh my God have mercy upon us amen I'm speaking to the ones who are going through it there are those of us who are going through that you need to wake up you need to press through you need to break through that go you haven't reached your birth yet right come on Amen now listen what what they said in Israel Israel in Lamentations 55 our next are under persecution we labor and have no rest what an awful place to be and you know how come they got there because they went worldly every time the church get worldly God sends them another ruler amen y'all hear what I'm saying if you won't allow God to rule you he's going to let the devil rule you yeah amen you don't have no rest why because you're out of the will amen when there is no rest is because you're not in that resting place amen good word amen I'm talking about your soul now I'm talking talking about your soul questioning still whether you saved or not questioning whether you're going to make a Rapture if God didn't intend for you to make a Rapture he could have left you out there with the foolish y'all hear what I'm saying his whole purpose is to bring you to a translation but he must amen he must amen allow uh if change your mind amen you know it's so amazing how we can believe the devil come on somebody you know the devil can just say anything and we want to copy him I say we I'm talking about the people people as at large at the world whatever he produces and and you know I've used the television so many time because the television influences everybody influences all your thinking come on somebody that's why people do what they do right if they were left alone you know everybody would be in their own little world but the television makes us one Lord amen all all a star let me put it this way I don't want to stand on here too long all a star got to do is come out with a with a with a certain hairstyle and all of about everybody want to everybody want to want to want to do the hairstyle come on it's it all a star all a star got to do is wear a certain kind of clothing oh come on somebody and here in the Church of God you can't get them to dress right it got good to us amen but we said to the Lord if you save me I will be faithful how many of us said it and how faithful have we been oh Lord I got this in my notes hallelujah oh God if you save me I do whatever you want me to do but what happened pressure came amen see God has to put God ain't trying to destroy you he's trying to show us what we're lacking amen and when the Trials come when the pressure come it's not to destroy you it's not because he

showing you what the enemy has been doing to you spiritually and that's why you in the condition that you are in he's trying to blow your light out but remember the prophet of God said whatever light God when God lights a candle it can't be blown out amen if God live the fire in you it cannot be blown now amen praise the Lord hallelujah but if he can get you cold the Bible said the love of many and understand he's not talking about worldly people because they don't have love true love of God Divine Christians Christians love amen that are now amen dying being blown I would I was said like a friend of mine years ago he said the breath of Satan blowing your light blowing you cold blowing you to a place where you become stagnated come on CH Christians this is a house of correction amen thank you Lord isn't that what we come for Lord I want to be closer to you God said here it is hallelujah Romans 8:35 he he says listen who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or salmon or naked a pearl a sword you know what we do when we backslide you know what we do we said all the god the devil's been so mean to me and he's he's done these things he's done these things but I think I'll join his side so he won't persecute me and give me a hard time no more I join ins side and you let me tell you something he give you a worse time then than if you would have stayed with God H don't let that Devil he's a snake to begin with am hello somebody who shall separate us from the love of Christ your tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Pearl or swore in our day it says who or what fine dress fine House Fine car fine job Easy Living is our greatest enemy are you going to allow it to separate you as it is written for thy sake we are killed all our feel like shouting but I got to preach oh my God as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all the these things we are more than conquerors through him that love us why are we are more than conquerors it's not by your works it's not by what you do is because he did it when he was in Calvary I was in him when he went to hell I was in him when he raised up I was in him when he sat on the stone I was in him and so are you my victory is because he's Victorious amen if we can keep that he became our sin that we might become his righteousness I hold to his righteousness amen I accept his righteousness I'm going to hold to his righteousness get behind me devil I don't care what you say his righteousness because he declared it yes sir don't y'all feel his presence he's liking this Hallelujah wo Jesus thank you Lord Lord no height nor death huh listen said I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angel nor principalities nor powers nor things presentence nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature did you leave anything out brother um brother Paul he just put it out no other creature he had this he had to sum it up hallelujah amen shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord why this thing didn't start happening in the 20th century Hallelujah he loved us before the world began oo second Corinthians I believe it's the 14th for he says now thanks be to unto God which always causes us to Triumph in Christ and make it manifest the savior of his knowledge By Us in every place I love that when you falter when you fail when you come short God says uhuh uh uh you weren't ordained to be there Hallelujah you can't stay there I've got a word written for you I've got to cause you to Triumph I'm GNA push you I'm GNA put some pressure on you but at the end of the road you'll be triumphant in me see I love the god like that amen I love the god like that sir amen can see me at the at almost at the Finishing Line and I'm almost all out of my strength Hallelujah and he's my coach he's down there say get up get up push a little harder push a little harder you can make it I know you can make it got confidence in you hey I got confidence in you and that's what God has done for us in this day he's placed his confidence in usall Hallelujah prophet of God goes on and talks about it amen I'm not I'm not going to be too much longer Amen in the M the Conqueror he talks about how he was over there in Rome and how in the arena when the Gladiators would come out there and you know they would fight and everything else and this mean amen you know the man is he can Triumph to live and down this way means that he dies he said but when it came to the Christians they always pointed it down while they pointed their fingers down the Christians raised their hands Hallelujah in surrender in surrender to God come on somebody see it meant death to them but victory in Christ Jesus Hallelujah he said in the midst of he goes on and says a great uh he talks about he said and uh they would rush from on a Prayer bench a bunch of Christians let me back it up he said that's precious faith of the early church that was pure gold said the Bible tried in the fire how they would open their pits that great Arena setting like that only in a bleacher as we call it Hallelujah and the great massive PL place down here and they would burn them to the state they would open the doors and trap uh traps of hungry lions and tigers and they would rush forth on a Praying bunch of Christians and just dragged them from bone to bone and the faith of those people that stood firm in the midst of all of that the church grew mightily all the time and after con come over and liberated them from under the Roman persecution and United the church and stayed together they were they were there there's where we got cath C Catholics to begin with and when they did the church lost more grounds in 10 years than it had gained all through the persecution if there's anything that makes Christians lazy is when they're on a flowy bed of ease we don't have to persecute we don't have enough persecution we don't have it hard enough always the chain is so strong at his weakest length and a man under pressure is what he is when he's under pressure amen he's real to true Christianity will show when he's under pressure amen get them all riled stirred up and then you'll see the real man come out out if he's got a temper it'll show itself if he's Meek and gentle it'll show itself put him under pressure once and God put all his children under test to see whether there any flaws in them don't you love God ah if there's some flaws in me I want them out show me all my flaws Lord I want to see all my flaws oh some of y'all ain't happy you ought to be you ought to be thanking God for showing you your flaws one not one flaw getting to Heaven I want all my flaws to be seen now y'all y'all all right with this I won't be long it won't be long amen I you got we got to overcome this thing come on don't tell me you don't have the remnant it's the Holy Ghost it's the power of God come on somebody let oh I think about this people brother let me say it like this you know before Paul came on the scene those disciples all they had was the word of Jesus they didn't have no Scrolls a lot of them didn't understand the Scrolls until Jesus walked down the road in M us and began to open the word to them come on somebody they didn't have books like this but you know what kept them they first love that Holy Ghost amen stay in the presence of God it's a thing that kept them and as soon as they left the anointing that's when the devil was able to come in on him soon as you lose it soon as you leave it amen is when Satan comes in and convince you otherwise you love the Lord amen you see this is what I'm trying to get the people to see we have been allotted a time you and I we didn't ask to be born in this ly and age we didn't ask to be born in this Darkness it was God's choosing amen hallelujah just like you and I was not asked to be born with the parents that we got some of us might have want to choose some others but uhuh God saw the perfect will y'all hear what I'm saying you're born under the parents that you supposed to be born under and there was no other way you could have come amen hallelujah so is it with us we're born under the right parents we might have had under the chickens but we were born Eagles amen thank you Lord fear that little flock see a lot of time you preach these kind of messages devil say see you can't make it it's just too hard he's a liar he's a liar a lot of time all you got to do is stand still and let the weather take it take it take you through the you plant a seed all that seed does is it is just lay there the rain the sun whatever all the elements that needs to take care of that seed as long as that seed stay there it's going to happen amen right that seed can't see the Sun but the sun knows it's there Hallelujah that sun began to draw that seed right but you see before it could bring it up out of the ground the thing has to go through a process of rotting and dying amen amen that's right see and a lot of times you don't even realize that the things you're going through some of these things are just rotting you out dying you out thank you Lord you think you're living but that that's dying out when you can see where you are and say God help Meen God deliver me God this is not where anybody are you where you want to be Hallelujah no sir we still got to move on there's more of God for all of us you can't allow yourself just to lay there your religion ain't going to save you there's a lot of people who got religion amen better than yours oh Lord but there's only a few that got true salvation come on there's some people that this against their laws to even drink a soda pop why they take the scripture you shouldn't be drinking strong drink come on somebody there are some people that don't even believe in chewing gum that's not Sanctified you deceiving your body that you eating something y'all hear what I'm saying but the grace of God there's so many people that if you drunk coffee you were sinning it they can go down the line how many Sinners we be in here if they oh God help us Lord you know why I'm reading these things PR god listen we got something coming our way and a lot I'm I'm I'm just I'm troubled I'm so troubled because there are so many of us that are not preparing it appears to be that way because if you were preparing your joy would be greater you know you understand what I mean the fire would be hotter you know it just it's true because we don't listen it is going to come quickly do don't you know that's how it happened over there in Germany one day it was it was the streets was clear the next day the next overnight tanks were rolling through the yard that's how fast it's going to happen amen you you look at this thing why do people put such such confidence in in these we Earthly things I don't understand I I really don't it's not a good thing it's it's good to be to know where your Treasures are amen fear not little f for it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom now I'm going go this and I'mma go here so you can understand I don't sound I don't want that to sound like I'm talking now so we can understand understand this that when we God chose us he didn't make a mistake thank you Lord and don't you know you cannot see this gospel if he didn't if you don't allow you to you can want to see it and and can't see it God must allow you to see it amen he is the only one that can draw you and if God is drawing you I don't care what's around you who's around you you let God do it oh come on people now let me put it this way because I look at this thing I said Lord I said what is it that we are so prideful that we are so ashamed of him and and and and we don't even know it now that's blind when you are ashamed of God and you don't know it you say well what do you mean just a little simple test when God say jump you you look around before you jump or God said raise your hand and you look around to see who's looking first you're ashamed you want to make sure you're not the only one in the Crowd Oh Lord and don't you know he's sensitive enough to that to know that you are amen amen the Holy Ghost is sensitive that's why all the time we say well the word was good the word was good but you can find somebody in here amen who's allowed Satan to to do their minds and he grieve the Holy Ghost because perhaps the message was coming for that particular person amen huh come on somebody I'm telling you we look at this and and it's and I look at those little children and you know the you know music is going and and and they jumping and moving and and and you know we sitting up here like stiff boards and God's rebuking you and you don't even know it you must be as a little child he said they don't care what you think about them they're not even paying attention to you hallelujah oh you say that's wrong how could it be wrong if God is moving him oh come on somebody and you know I I love this part because our men we like to be macho right Macho Macho Macho nonsense nonsense because if David was a man after God's Own heart listen I'm going tell you something David was on anointing y'all hear what I'm saying you ever seen a Pulpit you a a puppet and the man got the strings he's the one that's making the movement you don't see the strings but you see the puppet oh come on that's all God was doing he was moving David so the kind of steps and kicks and whatever David was doing is what God would do amen because he was being influenced by God thoughts oh come on somebody see a lot of time we think oh this is the way oh come on E if you you afraid to be called a sister they going to call you one anyhow who cares who cares what labors people put on you when you know who you are hey come on somebody who cares amen I had somebody tell me you sing too high years ago I wish God would have made me a Bas I like the Bas he didn't make me no BAS he made me a tenner hallu but you can't you many days I wish I was a Bas every time I hear somebody just talk that's I like that you know what I'm saying but God made me a tenner am I supposed to be ashamed of being a tenner see God made you who you are you're the bride you're the bride be the bride amen be the bride amen be the bride amen not some struggling Church age member amen the bride amen Invincible Hallelujah I'm never bride be the bride he says this in letting off to pressure I'm just I'm going to close here to right here if Satan can once get you under pressure he's about got you if he can get you worrying and fretting you're going to L you're going to use bad judgment come on is that the truth am I the only one never been there I'm talking about from experience if he get you to fretting and worrying he's about got you whooped cuz you will make the wrong decision and then try to hide oh come on come on come on it's nothing but the truth am right amen because what happens is when you get under that kind of a thing and you make the wrong decision you see self and then you become in your own self ashamed of what you've done uh come on Amen but thank God Amen for the grace of God thank God that God God has a a a place where we can hide oh Hall and repent Hallelujah and say God have mercy we're at a time like I said God is God and he's trying to tell us the Lord he is our God so he's trying to show us amen that being being see we got it do good we don't even pray over our meals like we ought to amen on somebody is true now maybe I'm the only one there have been times Satan tried to get me you know to be ashamed to pray in public oh come on come on come on come on Amen in a when you come amen and you find that Spirit you know what you need to do turn up the volume stretch it a little longer amen right you turn up the volume and stretch it a little longer then you realize if he can get you to do that you you need to repent amen you need to say God have mercy on me Satan has been cooling me off I tell you what one thing about the world and and you better believe this is true when they really believe something you can't turn them they don't care whether you like it or not I've seen people dressed all kinds of ways all kind of stuff on them and oh my God I'm think what in the world and you think they blush you think you're going to embarrass them by staring no you know what they do they look at you like what you looking at and you know that's okay they they are they convicted they they they they they believe in what they doing what about a Christian amen like I said and I'm closing this and I'm closing

with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord now anybody know what Holiness is Holiness is being sealed with the Holy Ghost it ain't the way you think or dress is because if you

body to grow some wool if if if a tree can bring forth different kind of fruit right come on and I'm just saying by the grace of God we are so at the coming of the Lord it makes me nervous to see so
