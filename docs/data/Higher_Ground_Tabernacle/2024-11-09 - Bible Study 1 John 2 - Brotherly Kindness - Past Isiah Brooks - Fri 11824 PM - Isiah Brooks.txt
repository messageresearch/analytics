TRANSCRIPT
========================================
oh we give on the to avor Jesus Christ we thank everybody thank the Lord for you all being here and we know that God is with us and um we know that we're on a journey with pilgrims with strangers we're traveling through we're going to start tonight at first John the second chapter we're going to read the first 10 verses first John for our Bible study tonight we want to entitle this message um brotherly love it is something that we all need um so I appreciate the Lord for his Amazing Grace and all that he's doing for US 1 John 2 1-10 my little children the these things right I unto you that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the propit for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world and hereby we know we do know that we know him if we keep his Commandments he that saith I know him and keepeth not his commandment is a liar and the truth is not in him but whosoever keepeth his word in him verely is the love of God perfected hereby know we that we are know we that we are in him he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked Brethren I write no new commandment unto you but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning the old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning and again a new commandment I write unto you which thing is true in him and in you because the darkness is passed and the True Light now shineth he that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even to now he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is not occasion of stumbling in him let us pray father God we thank you Father for the reading of your word Lord we ask oh God that you lead us and guide us into this message or into this subject tonight many many many things could be said oh God but pray that you would open our hearts and our mouth and our minds that we might be able to receive something tonight that will further our our walk with you Lord bless us now in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated when we talk about love everybody think they know what it is but love is a very very very deep subject we have what we call ailio love which is love between man Mankind and then we have the love that we know that is just agapy love that's the perfect love by the way I don't even talk about love how that love God is love as the scripture says but as it trickles down from where he is to where we are it's almost in a place of of a perverted State when we think about the power of love you can just look around and see it's love that keeping everything together even now love is something that I believe Adam and Eve truly had when they were first formed and made by God they had a love that connected them in such a way they understood who they were and their relationship what their relationship was to each other as well as to God but because of the fall things have fallen and now mankind is in a place where God is trying to restore us to that perfect place that perfect human being that perfect Son of God and the only way that he knows that this can be done is by way of Love really the Bible said love conquers all things and when you read even in Corinthians where it talks about charity the or original word for charity is love that was kind of changed but the the definition of charity or the definition of Love Is Love and somehow when you talk about charity you think about just giving to people oh they gave that's the charitable organization they give here they give that but but love is more than just giving love is protecting love is Sheltering love is defending you know love it's it's uh how can I say it is when it's God it provides so there's so many facets to love and the world lacks it all we understand that the Bible even tells us that's in the last days that the Christians love will wax cold because of the trials because of the Temptations because of the lack of their love for God but here it says my little children these things right unto you that ye what sin not and of course we understand what sin is it means to disbelieve because if you if you disbelieve the word of God it makes the Temptation easier it makes it easier to fall you understand me but when you believe that what God has taught you uh right from wrong and you believe uh that what God teaches you in his word is right then you stay with the right and you sha the wrong brother random said before a man could ever go in error he has to refuse the truth and that's how it is before you can even fall in sin you have to refuse the truth because the Holy Ghost is faithful If any man sin we have a a advate what is an advocate anybody knows right off yes yes and and and yeah someone anyone who who speaks in favor of you or to recommend or argue or calls for you kind of like a lawyer and uh that's what he is for us he's an attorney that stands for us uhhuh oh yes okay okay so yeah that's good to know so we understand that we we have a lawyer H who who knows who that lawyer is amen praise the Lord amen thank God because he we know he's a righteous lawyer he's a a true lawyer he's a judge he's he's a a merciful lawyer I mean he's one that if you want to say shrewd when it comes to the devil he doesn't take any he doesn't play so we thank God for that Advocate that's always going before us what made him such an advocate yes brother yes yes that's exactly right that's what the scripture says we have not a high priest that cannot be touched by the feelings of our infirmities so Jesus Christ had God himself came as a man as a flesh man that he may understand Mankind and his suffering and because he can understand our suffering because the Bible said he was tried in every point but without sin yes and so therefore he can defend our case before God right because really remember brother B said we we we're failures to begin with we we came in as a failure right so he is the perpetuation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world so what does that word pritu means that's good that he satisfies the wrath of God and that's basically what the blood of Jesus Christ uh does for us because when Jesus when God sees the blood he passes over us to know that there was a real sacrificial lamb who was his dear son Jesus Christ uh and so when he sees that blood he passes over us because while as long as we in Christ as long as we are under the blood we are accepted in Christ so thank God for the blood thank God for the advocate because we need them both right and the Bible says hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his Commandments so I I have to say it like this one of the things that I I I whenu disal uh uh uh service in our country was pretty much U biblical based uh you know it or Fair pretty much fair uh they gave people mercy and Grace and one of the things that they would say to you you all right we're going to let you go on these charges but don't let me see you back in here with the same charges and and that was like Mercy that was Grace because really sometimes they even had um evidence but it all depend on uh sometimes how how mature you are or how it how influenced you were of of by some others and and the judge would always look at all the evidence and you know basically judge things by the evidence and many people went free and of course when things began to get crooked you know things change but when it comes to God you got to realize that he's as brother said he's the judge he's the jury he's the attorney you know what I mean and so you got the whole Court of in in your favor and the the verdict of the whole thing is that you never sin in the first place so and this is very important because a lot of times people don't understand why is important to have the Holy Ghost because this is a applicable only to those who have the Holy Ghost you see what I'm saying I mean potentially you're free but once God approves moves you and seals you with the Holy Ghost you are totally free and that's when that scripture come into play he whom the son set free is free indeed often Christians don't even realize how free they are I mean even some with the Holy Ghost don't understand how free they are and I'm going to read a quote down the line to to show you how free you are um and that's what you call that's what makes people love when you know God has loved you it makes you love others right and we have said it all the time I love him because he first loved me right so that love that God gives to us is not to be kept to ourselves but is to be funel out to other people because that's what people God wants the world to know that he loved them is that right St John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his own only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life and all of us should know that when the blood of Jesus Christ struck the Earth the whole earth was saved amen that's right and the only way people go to hell today is that they reject the blood all right so hereby do we how hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his Commandments he people say well I don't know I just don't want to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I've been baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost and that's good enough for me let me ask you a question is the trinitarian baptism a baptism absolutely not it's just putting somebody in the water and bringing them up God does not consider that as a baptism even though when we talk about a baptism it meanss to be covered but it's a wrong name it's the wrong formula if you had an algebra project uh problem and you just wrote down everything that the problem was and never never worked it out you wouldn't you get a zero that problem is set there on the left and you're supposed to work it out and bring the answer to the right right so that's how it is Father Son and Holy Ghost one name I'm saying this because there's so many people I got friends right now who I love dearly fellowship with them whenever I can who are denominational Christians I've shown them acts 238 and they claim to love God matter of fact they seem to have a greater witnessing you know what I mean they can tell people about Jesus better than I can but when it comes to the word because of their Traditions they love their church more than they love God right so the Bible said if here's here the way we know you if you keep his Commandments and that is commandment and they say well no no no no no I'd rather uh believe what what Jesus said than what Peter said not realizing that Peter had the revelation of what Jesus said in Matthew 28:19 right and that is a revelation it is something that God has to give to you he that say I know him and keep not his commandment is a liar and the truth is not in him and that's that's that's reality yes sir right but whoo El who but who so keepeth his word and this is what I don't understand in the book of Acts where the church the New Testament Church first started they asked Peter who is the Sportsman of Jesus Christ who is the preacher of that day because the Bible said they were pricked in their hearts when they recognized and realized they had crucified the Lord and they asked Peter what must we do and Peter never quoted uh Matthew 28:19 he said repent and be baptized in the name of of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but that was the action part of Matthew 28:19 y'all hear what I'm saying this is very important because if if if you reject the smaller part how you going to get the bigger you learn your ABCs you go to algebra that's right you know but who so keepeth his word in him verely is the love of God perfected hereby we know that we are in him anybody want to expound on that one but whosoever keepeth his word in him verely is the love of God perfected let me put it this way the love of God matures because when you Perfection is maturity on this level I'm speaking of you can add all these virtues and all of these virtues bring you to a maturity to a proper son and daughter of God that God will uh uhh adopt you and put you out there because he trust you you are matured you you're not you're not with childish things anymore you you literally doing what God wants you to do without grudging you know I look at those early Saints there in Ephesus and how they just were so obedient at the beginning you know the Antichrist did come in on them they were aimed at aimed at and what relaxed and whenever you get relaxed in Christianity Satan has his focus on you that's why God said he would that we be hot or cold right he wants us to be hot right and I'm I'm I'm crying out now for more fire you know what I mean because I don't want the fire just to exist in church I want the fire to exist outside wherever I go right so how we know that we're perfected because the love of God and understand this it is the love of God that gives you faith it the love of God that gives you virtue every step of the way has been is being led you're being led by the love of God because each one of those virtues are victories and I'm not I'm not talking about a victory with a dog I'm talking about Victory with human beings God will test you in every Way by human beings people because you in a war and you are in a war to do what conquer this land just like Joshua had to conquer the land of Jericho I mean uh the Canaan you have to conquer this land and the only way we can conquer This Land Is God put oppositions in front of us that's right yeah people and guess what you you got to love him right he that say he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked now is that complicated I I put it this way if I had a uniform let's say a duck because a lot of people put on all kinds of ducks ducks and other any kind of thing but if I'm abiding in that duck that means I got that whole uniform on and however I walk the duck walk that's right we have become one this is what he's saying now if we abide in him all alter himself also to so walk even as he walk and abideth means to stay remain and wait or wait amen so you you you you in him right and as he walk like Jesus says I can do nothing except the father show me so everything that you're doing you're being led by the spirit because the Bible said they that are led by the spirit they are the sons of God so so in this love and listen when you love someone you're willing to sacrifice and God loves the sacrifice of praise and there are times that you worship God even in sacrifice so times that God will ask you to do something when your flesh do not want to do it right but you do it anyway for an example I was going through something just recently and and I won't say that I'm completely Victorious I've gotten a complete Victory but one of the things that God said to me like a natural man and he was telling me about perfect love is living for others you know you can't you know selfishness can't be in the equation it's perfect love yes brother did you you yeah everything he yeah yeah yeah y everything he did was living for others yeah that's why he asked God never asked us to do something that he himself won't do or haven't done so this is what he's that love will live for others right and and I learn I'm learning see I'm learning that because you know when when how can I selfishness or what whatever the case may be when it's day you're not dead that's right that's right you're not quite dead yet but when you're dead and you're Rod then you know you you you you you go wherever the spirit leads you to go right Brethren I write no new commandment unto you but an old commandment which you had from the beginning the old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning again a new commandment I write unto you which things is true in him and in you because the darkness is passed and the True Light now shineth now what in Earth John is talking about I I I'll tell you darkness is passed and remember amen that uh when Jesus died everything went dark dark the moon refused to shine you know everything and you got to realize that was a that was the darkest of all ours but that same Darkness also brought forth light and you say what do you mean without Darkness you can't see light light is always there yall understand me it takes the darkness to manifest what is light what light is like the the night Stars right supposedly the Sun goes out if the sun goes out it would be what complete darkness see but here Jesus Christ is now manifested as the light he is the light am and because he is the light we say we walk in the light so what was the light what was it Jesus said father forgive them for they know not what they do Jesus said to Judas betray me with a kiss Jesus said even to the religious man he loved him right right so so no matter what the differences were of whatever anyone brought love always Prevail and that's that's the Bible love conquers all love is not selfish is is that the word love seeketh not her own love is not puffed up you know what when you love somebody you got to suffer it doesn't come easy but it's there for because God how can I say it you know I I I put it this way I think uh let's use a cow when a cow have calves that cow never complains well a real mother won't but that real mother calf will never complain about those babies even a dog sometime I I've seen dogs nursing those little puppies and just looking at them about drive me crazy and she lay there so patiently yall understand me because she knows she's there to give out now they're taking from her and she and that's her love that's her love and she's willing to lay down her life to feed those babies to feed those puppies no matter what it takes so that's the way it is with a Christian some Christians are just takers pray for those that despitefully use you the Bible says and you just have to let them do it sometimes ain't nobody going to make me a fool well I put it this way you either obey God or you don't and I want that kind of love that I could love no matter what the circumstances are because in that people will see you are a Christian I mean it's it's like this when somebody shout at you and you shout back at them you're not dead yet that's right because a dead man yes sir cannot respond that's the truth all of us need to die a little more right a dead man does not respond kick a dead man he won't even grunt matter of fact you can go over to a dead man and Rob his pocket and he still won't say nothing to you that's what a dead man does so you got to understand what God is requiring from us you say well what do you mean brother Brooks the Bible said they slapped him they spat on him they they they mocked him and he opened not his mouth he said not a mumbling word ain't that amazing and the Bible said walk in the light as he is in the light if you say you in the light you're supposed to live like he lived that's the truth help us Jesus because John knows what he's talking about the darkg has passed we ourselves can say okay we once understood God according to organizations and denomination now that Darkness has passed now we're in the light in the light the revelation of the word for our day and this is what we supposed to walk as what Sons and Daughters of God redeemed Sons and Daughters of God powerful Sons and Daughters of God right and this is what the we got to become listen people oh the Pentecost is this the Pentecost is that you and me or we must move up higher amen we our lives must we we must live higher amen than they did that's right Miracles everything else must be higher amen right because every age was a step higher sir and we can't look down back or even down at them if we're not not even living on that level and won't you you better understand those real Pentecostals were real Pentecostals and they did not even have as far as knowledge what we have but you know what they were willing to die died to the age in which they came out of and we must learn how to die to the age that we came out of again a new commandment right I write unto you which things is true in him and in him and in you because the darkness is passed and the True Light now shineth anybody need to say anything everybody any compliment okay I mean comment not compliment comment sorry he that saith he is in the light and do what hateth his brother is in darkness even until now so God don't care about your religion he don't even care how faithful you've being to church and Todd ping and offerings and all of the things that but if you have hatred in your heart for your brother or sister he said you are a liar but you don't know what he did to me hey have you suffered like Christ did what about what about I love Stephen because Stephen to me is such a powerful example here this man he's not even a preacher amen but he says Lord hold not these he had so much love he was asking God to forgive them you know he wasn't even like Abel Abel say Lord get him Abel wanted Revenge but the Bible said we have a greater we have a more word of Prophecy a greater word of Prophecy because now we are love love love does what love forgives right I'm trying to get I'm just trying to go I got to hurry up though I'm moving moving too slow all right he that saith he is in the light and hate his brothers in darkness even now he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is not an occasion of stumbling in him right so when you are in the light you're kind of like Jesus when when your brother say something that you know that is not of God of course you don't have to call him Satan but you recognize it's Satan not your brother that's right so you don't stumble you know I had something uh and I honestly I had some things said to me uh uh early this morning and that really uh had me going but but I realized you know people can and say things under the inspiration of the devil and they don't even realize they're saying it that's right you have to make excuses for people but because when people say things it doesn't mean it's not going to hurt but you got to make excuses for them love covers a multitude of sin that's right so in order to keep peace within your heart and your love flowing for that individual or individuals you must Realize by the grace of God that it was the en we ration not against flesh and blood for Spiritual wickedness in high places and Satan always have you as a Target right listen it says what you know you're not you're not going to you say you're in the light and then you're going to cause your brother to stumble you know what you're doing wrong or you know what you just said is going to stumble your brother that's not love that's right well he said it to me so I thought I'd go back at at him that's not love anytime you feel like you got to Revenge yourself you have stepped outside of what we call love right or defend yourself when you know you're right you don't necessarily need to defend yourself unless the occasion calls for you to defend yourself yes even in my situation could have been a real mess but I kept my mouth sh by the grace of God and others that heard the comment pretty much dropped their head but nevertheless let let me read something to you brother was talking about the early church and we need talk when I'm saying the early church and I'm talking about something that uh like 8033 or something I'm talking about the early church when he started it out and I don't know whether my wife remember when we went to the Pentecostal church when we first people loved each other now you had some you going always have Rebels but there were times that people did not even want to leave each other after church because the services were so great and so when I read this this kind of brought my mind back to the way it used to be brother R say they love one another till I haven't seen people people love one another that's the Lord that's what the church was established upon that Godly brotherly love for one another I seen them even shake hands with one another leaving the place and crying like babies to leave one another they loved one another that that well and I could go to their house to visit them and times the Bible was laying upon open and stained with tears come in at midnight at night time where fathers and mothers was gathered together and their little children around on the floor kneeling around and father and mothers on their knees crying and praying I'd stand at the door and wait and wait and wait and they didn't stop praying I'll just sat down on the steps and sto praying myself waiting for them see and that was what the they loved one another they loved one another we used to stand and sing that old song blessed be the ties That Bind our hearts in Christian Love The Fellowship of Kindred mind is like to that above when we are sun apart it gives us inward pain but we shall still be joined in heart and hope to meet again I say this with great joy in my heart to Christ many of them are sleeping around in these Graves mocked tonight waiting for the great Resurrection where we'll meet together again let not that let not that Spirit ever depart from this place if it ever does that I don't care how elegant you your pastor might be how well he might bring the word of God the spirit of God is grieving the way see when we can have when we can have all things in Fellowship in common and love one another then God will work with us y'all hear what he saying it means it can be restored and and only then will God work through us when the love of God is restored between us and with us and this is why Satan always divide churches because he know A House Divided can't stand and and as long as there's sin in the camp people are hating and and and begrudging one another and you know you just foolishness childish things uh you know that's that's what Paul call it he call it he says listen when you ought to be on stake or the Deep things you you still got to be fed milk and it's because people are are failing to mature in Christ see I I say it like this the way it used to be can be again what do you want I mean what do you want and I understand through history the way Revival starts was that there were people dedicated enough to pray and fast until God came on the scene brother R said many of his meetings were successful because there were women behind the curtain praying for him see Prayer Changes Things and listen it it could start out one two or three but because the Bible said where two or three are gathered in my name there I am in the midst if we want a Revival in here it has to be more than just the pastor everybody that really want Revival need to understand is stars on your knees right let me read this a humble myself uh 1963 paragraph 99 and we're keeping time that the people come by and say if you want to see a church that's really humble a church really loves God drop in us there at the Tabernacle one time in the scripture where they had in the scripture where they had just left the Revival and Jesus was in the bottom of the boat sleep sleep and a storm came up and he brother Rand describ it he says while Jesus was asleep the disciples was on top on the boat testifying of the meeting that just came out of ain't that ain't that amazing for years we've been testifying about the meeting that was and now the storm is on us and we wondering where Jesus is he's still in the boat that's right right but then the the the the the the the intensity of the storm got him so to a PL brought him into a spirit of fear and they awake Jesus and that's what he wants he wants to be awakened he awake they awake Jesus and said carth thou not that we perish Jesus rebuked them ye of little of unbelief you just seen the miraculous right and the person who did it is right here in the ship but you still have you still disbelief when I've taught you that whatsoever come your way ask in my name and you shall receive it but you see they forgot all of that seem like people when the storms come they forgot forget who to look look to right yes then yes then they come look and see what time we're living you'll see the spirit of God moving among you great signs and wonders and things will be taking place if the thing is working together it's telling the time but if it isn't working then then time is stopped it won't tell the time no more so if y'all understand what he's saying a dead Church can't tell you the time you see a time we know that brother random talks about another outpouring of the Holy Ghost on the Bride of Jesus Christ and God knows we need it but when you find a church and they don't have those five identification of a true church you understand me something's wrong and I think what it is we don't love each other it boils right back down to loving one another because God works through the church in this age by way of love so if we want to know what time we're living just start everybody working together in the gospel loving one another loving God and the hands itself will tell the time what we're living in do you believe that sure amen the Lord bless you richly right why I believe the time will soon arrive this is coming from law having having a shadow I believe the time will soon arrived that when healing will be a Mir healing will be Miracles would Miracle heal Miracle healings with a such a common thing we we got to get some rapture ing faith in the church to go away from here on one of these days so he's equating or bringing these Supernatural elements into uh the time period of the Rapture without how are you going to make a Rapture if there's no healing and deliverances and things like that the Supernatural is not working among you no no no these things must be prevalent it is a sign of the time right you say I don't know about that yes it is on the day of Pentecost what did Peter quote Joel Joel to in the last day God said he' pour out his Spirit Upon Our flesh right they were the manifestation of Joel and we must have a manifestation of this message before we leave out of here with that can't not like it is and we know it's not going to be a vast majority but I'm coming back to John I love John John knew what love was all about and I John because John understood who Jesus was he laid in his bosom even though he was his brother he took advantage of it and I think that's what we need to do start laying in the bosom of Jesus he'll tell you Secrets John knew things nobody else knew right listen listen to this quote because I want to free somebody tonight coming from the message I'm sorry having a shadow brother bandam said like this paragraph 134 he said that's right I never was any good neither was you there's nothing we could do about it that's the good part of it but when you can just recognize that that you're no good then you not then you'll not trust in your own goodness if there's one thing you could do to Merit it you have something to brag about Lord I sought you day and night but you can't say that to him right so I'm going go on paragraph 136 he said no man come to me except my father draws him and God seeks man and not man seeking God so you don't have one thing to say but God it was your grace that did it and then as long as you accepted in the Beloved how can how how can God bring you into judgment and when he's already judged Christ in your stead perpetuation right atonement right when he already judged Christ in your stad how could you have suffered for your sins when Christ has already done it God will be a two-time and an offer person that's right if you had to suffer for your sins when it was thoroughly paid by Jesus Christ and you accepted it and as long as God accepted Christ he accepted you with Christ and when he did when when he did he do it before the foundation of the world when he spoke him into existence he spoke you you redem deemed with him and your names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world then you're scared what oh if I could just keep holding on I quit that a long time ago I never did even try it in the first place I just turned loose and let him do the holding someone said when I was sick that time he said when I got over he said brother random did you keep your religion during this your sick spell I said no sir it kept me that's the difference and that's what happened see so a lot of time we think oh I'm holding on I'm keeping no no no no it's God who's keeping you it's God whose Grace save you God is The Keeper of the Soul think about how free you are and if you could see how free you are don't you wouldn't you want to see somebody else as free as you are the truth of the matter is the real gospel has not yet been preached every gospel amen is being preached according to a denominational Revelation but we have the true revelation of of what freedom is and that freedom was given to us by the love of God God so loved the world right so that same love is what God is wanting us to exemplify to our brothers to our sisters to our enemies right because he had a whole slew of enemies on the day he was crucified both Jews religious people Rome and everybody else and God says father forgive them amen for they know not what they do he didn't charge anybody right he forgave them all God wants us to be a friends friends and when he spoke that to my heart I says Lord show me some some kind of love uh between you know the the Believers you know I could see and understand you know we know you know Paul loved Timothy as his own son we know that but we see in the illustration there in Samuel 1 Samuel 18: 3-4 we see J Jonathan and David and we've heard that many times Jonathan and David made a covenant because he loved him as his own soul and I believe that was a type of the Bride of Jesus Christ that we supposed to love one another as our own Souls but this is the thing that really impressed me and Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to David and his garments even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle so what was Jonathan doing Jonathan was really stripping himself he was making himself vulnerable right and true friends hide nothing from each other you're open because he's a friend and that's the way it's supposed to be by God's grace between Believers you believe the same thing and if you understand that story Jonathan even protected him against his own father Saul and even though David was being chased by Saul David still loved Saul and couldn't kill him and when he cut Saul's garment he went back in apoll oliz isin't that something because Saul didn't even recognize that David had cut His Garment David openly confess and that's what's happened to a lot of us sometime we cut people garment or we say things and we do things that we shouldn't do not knowing those curses flow right through the atmosphere and you're the only one that can stop it because you're the only one that started it but we do that but that's not love and we see how the Bible said loving a person and you know you get men they get all scared you know no this ain't I'm not talking about some kind of perverted thing I'm talking about a real love of God between brothers sisters have the same thing sisters do what about Ruth and Naomi mother-in-law and you know listen and they loved each other and and and I'm skipping because of my time but but but understand the relationship that that had David and Saul went went down in history went down in history and and you know we find out that they even made like I said made that Covenant you know and and and Jonathan and David work together to keep David safe from who Saul's jealousy conspiracy trying to kill David right you stand in the Gap you protect your can I say it like this Jonathan became David's Shield he came he protected him right we we don't even do that I mean but we should when somebody speak evil against somebody and you know that's wrong you need to stop and say stop that that's wrong stand up for what is Right stand up for what is truth even if it means that you lose a friend or or brother or sister but you're gain God you're gain the honor and you know the respect of God when you stand for the word but we we don't do that we should do it we should do it David loved Jonathan and Jonathan loved David so much to when David found out that Jonathan was killed David even went another measure and he took care of Jonathan's Afflicted son the FIV Chef think about it it was such a family affair it didn't just St with David it it was also with David's family you can't love me and not love my wife right when you love me you got to love my wife and my children it's a package deal that's the way it works that's the way it should Works work and God Is So PR precious God stripped himself just like Jonathan and gave it his his armor to us he became naked that we might be clothed that's what love does I mean love will do that just it doesn't seek its own when it came to Ruth and Naomi that came out of Ruth 116-117 Ruth said intreat me not y'all know the story to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whether thou goest I will go and whether thou lodgest I will Lodge thy people shall be my people and that God my God right let me go it like this there was no tribal in there's no W no fences there was no walls she became what Naomi was you understand me they became one people there was nothing to divide them this is the Bride of Jesus Christ there should be no culture no color no no no no rich or poor there should be nothing to divide us we supposed to be one that's what love does that's what it'll do brother r t uh how is that a a man with Cur pans on should be able to hug a tuck seat or a man with a tuck seat and call him brother however he says that but that's the way it's supposed to be there's no greater big eyes and little use we're all one family of one blood if you can't do this in the name of Jesus Christ you like the love of God and let me say it like this you can't practice this this only comes by the change of your nature which is God in you it's no longer you working anymore is a holy ghost living his life through you and that's what we all need where thou dest will I die and there will I be buried the Lord do so me do so to me and more also it all if ought but death part thee and me oh my it almost sound like a wedding ceremony what were they doing pledging she was pledging her Allegiance to her mother-in-law as we do to the word we pledge our allegiance to the word that that good old way that old time way and we LED that way because it was that way that brought us out of Moab that way that brought us to Jerusalem you understand me so I I'll say it like this John you know he going to talk about love because John you think about he was the only disciples that didn't run when they came after Jesus he was the only disciples that stayed with Jesus all the other scattered John types the bride Under Pressure she stayed with Jesus under re ridicule she stayed with Jesus under the crucifixion she stays with Jesus she loved Jesus like John loved Jesus and you and I must understand that this love that we have is not for me and mine it's for everybody even the stranger that you don't know God is love and if you love your brother then you have the love of God in you and I'mma re re say say this again I'm not talking about filo love because filio love will quit on you love divine never faileth it never fails and I don't know about you just studying this chapter on John I'm like Lord I need I need that Divine love to be on display I believe God has worked me with a lot of Virtues but I want the fullness I want that love that never fails I want that love that's greater than faith hope right faith hope and charity but the greatest of these is Charity faith hope and love so the greatest of it all is love and I I I want this to no matter what if it takes my whatever death I must take and when I say that I mean naturally dying to whatever I need to die to God is my witness he hear me declaring this I have one focus and that is to please God in this day to come out at the end where he can say Well done my good and faithful servant and in closing for the lessons today if you could remember that all God asked you to do is to be obedient because he's taking care of all of the other things he's washed you he's Sanctified you he's freed you there's no judgment against you I mean what more can he do and all he asked for is that you have you love him he saids if you love me you'll keep my commandment let's stand we seem like it's a million miles away but it's not it's so close all you got to do is drop to your knees a lot of people don't want to Humble you got to humble yourself to get this you got to pray even when you don't feel like praying you might not even feel him but he knows you on your knees it's not like God said well I don't hear him I don't feel him no no no God sees you what inspired you to get on your knees is not the devil because the devil know that's a position that is a dangerous position for him when it comes to the Saints brother bam talks about it he said the weakest of All Saints make a devil tremble when they go down to pray so remember no matter how weak you feel the solution to your Victory is through prayer I don't care whether you feel it or not talk to Jesus and God will respond let's have a word of prayer father God we thank you for your grace your mercy we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves I trust this little lesson has been a blessing to the people of God lord as we move through the scriptures Lord uh being Inspire inspired by you and I'm just trying to relate to the people what you have given to me and I pray right now Lord God that somehow the words tonight will find good ground and bring forth 100 fold because brother Lord you said if we hate our brother we are liars and we know not the truth the only way we can be in you and you in US is that we have love one toward another thank you Father God for the reading of your word in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you're dismissed
