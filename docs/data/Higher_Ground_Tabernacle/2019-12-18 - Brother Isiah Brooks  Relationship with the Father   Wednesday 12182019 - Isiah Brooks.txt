musicians thank you for all that you do Matthew 5:48 and then we'll go to Matthew 6 9 through 15 Matthew 5:48 and it reads be eat that therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect Matthew 6 we read beginning at the ninth verse of that particular chapter at the this manner therefore pray ye our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forget our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen hallelujah yes Lord I'm gonna read the fourteen and the fifteenth verse as well for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly Father will also forgive you but if you forgive not men their trespasses neither will your Father forgive your trespasses let us pray father we thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord you have been my all in all you've been the keeper of my soul you have been my best friend you've been my leader my guide and father we just pray tonight that you would have free course in the service and will be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I like to entitle the service tonight relationship with the father you and I must understand by God's grace just being a church member is not what God is requiring us to be there are a lot of clubs you can join and have a social life but God is interested in intimacy he's interested in having a relationship with us as individuals not only do God does God know us but he also want us to know him we we know by God's grace that the God we serve is the only true and living God he feels all he knows all he sees all and there is nothing that get by him we understand by God's grace that's a system doesn't give you life you know a lot of people are in systems they are in groups thinking that you know groups are going to give you life but the truth of the matter is this is an individual affair and each man is must be for himself I always say in this Christian walk there are times where the Christian must be selfish because we sang those songs if nobody go I'm going if I gotta go all by myself and and you know it's that way when it comes to a majority normally the majority of people are wrong you can start even from Genesis all the way up and you find out that the bigger the group more than likely they're wrong it's the small it's the little group that seemed to be insane and crazy they're the ones that used to have the truth and they're the ones that usually have or walk with God remember even in a time when Paul was here he said they that the people call though this way the way of heresy which means it's the way of being crazy how can you worship a man or one who people call God or the Son of God you must understand that it takes faith to believe Christianity you can't it's no reasoning you can't reason it because you can't say I believe that in Jesus Christ if you don't even believe the virgin birth and in our minds we know that is something that is impossible with men but with God all things are possible what we God is calling for us to do and I do apologize I feel a little weak tonight but by God's grace we're gonna give it our best now we we know by God's grace that God has the way that God has chosen is a narrow way it's a hard way and God said a man that only a few be fine this way is narrow it straight it's not the way that most people will travel but when it comes to Christianity you and I must understand it's more than just reading your Bible hallelujah but you must come to know the author of the Bible because if you cannot read it doesn't disqualify you from knowing the author of the Bible because the Bible said if a man called on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he shall be saved so we realize amen that now what we I was thinking today and yesterday and maybe the day before that we have been so we have been in such a place where sometimes people don't even know that they are behind a veil in other words there are things that that keeps you from God and sometimes those veils that that we call religious veils things that are that are not so clearly seen but it's there as a wall to keep you from going further because remember now you might think this might this might sound strange but when it comes to religious veils people don't even know that they're behind a veil uh you know because God progressively moves and and if you stop and organize and and and and and set up camp then God moves on but you can say well I know God is in this place or God it used to work because in every anyway whether you start Luther Wesley Pentecostal however God used every one of those times and those men to declare his gospel but the gospel of Jesus Christ is always moving forward it never stands still and it never backs up and so we must understand that because we say we're Christians we must always be watchful that we find ourselves that we may not find ourselves in trapped by traditions Creed's or dogless where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty and because Amen you have come into what we call a message you must understand that the message is a it's a place of growth hallelujah you can't say well I believe this message or I believe that God's in a prophet or I believe this and remain there because remember even John when he was on the scene John pointed to Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ was the way and everybody did not follow John's advice some stayed with John and some went with Jesus but even then realize Amen that they had to continue in the light that Jesus was presenting to them hallelujah and even then when they saw and they had been with Jesus they still not they still did not see immediately who he was is that right because even Jesus said I asked you Peter who do men say i the son of man am some say thou art John the Baptist some say you are Elijah some say Jeremiah one of the prophets and Jesus said Ben but tell me who do you say I the Son of Man em and then John said I mean our Peter said thou art the Christ the son of the Living God hallelujah but did that that revelation change Peter he had the knowledge of who he was but at the same time he had not yet been born again hallelujah so the very revelation of Jesus Christ doesn't necessarily give you a birth is that right Paul said you can understand all things and have not charity it profits you nothing so Peter couldn't just remain there with that revelation that Jesus Christ was the son of God he had to go to Pentecost he had to continue because amen after the death burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ Jesus said oh whatever you do bring me Peter because remember when Peter when Jesus has gone through the persecution and the trials of cavalry Peter denied him three times but yet is still before then he had the revelation that Jesus was the Christ see because you got to understand the Holy Ghost inside is what gives you power to stand on the word not the revelation of just having it there you've got to have power you have to have strength and so when Peter got born again is that right because Jesus told us that Peter you will be converted but when you converted strengthen your brothers so believing in Jesus Christ doesn't mean you convert it hallelujah you got to be born again something has to take place in you that would change all of your desires not some of them all of them the system systems will cause you to appear to be holy right because remember it men the Pharisees when Jesus came they all live holy they all look good but jesus said now I know better because inside your dead men's bones you look on the outside you look clean all polished up but inside you're dead men's bones hello so what I'm trying to say where I'm going with this is that the only way that you can have a relationship with God is that you must be born again hallelujah you can't be intimate with God if you are not compatible now I say that because the Bible says be holy for your father which is in heaven he is holy now how in the world are you going to become holy hallelujah there is no man that can make you holy no school can make you holy there's no way you can make yourself holy then how are we going to become holy the Bible said we got to be perfect hallelujah how are we going to be perfect is me the only way that you and I will be perfect is that you have the perfect God on the inside the only way you can ever be holy is that the holy God is inside is that right he said listen not only will I be with you he said but in that day you'll know that I'm in the father the father is in me and I am in you a lot of times people don't understand what the Holy Ghost is sometimes people think that the Holy Ghost is a shout and a dance and they're speaking in the tongues and running and rock I mean all of those things are good but after all of that is done what is your earnest desires this is why I try to tell people if your earnest desire is to please God every day that is the Holy Ghost not how many times you fall now because you're gonna fall you're gonna come short but your earnest desire is to please God every day that is the Holy Ghost that is a new birth in you hallelujah and that breath starts off like a seed somebody help me all that you need to make a rapture is in that seed is that right but you've got to keep that seed watered and in the presence of the Sun hmm is that right but what is the Holy Ghost anybody know what is the only goal always the second person in the Trinity No the Holy Ghost is God the Father he is God hallelujah it was the Holy Ghost that made Jesus act the way he acted is that right the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily jesus even said I can do nothing except my father show me now I'm showing your relationship here because what we want from God we want God to indwell us like he indwells jesus now Jesus Christ had the measure of God he had the full measure of God but we're not weird we're just a piece of the rock yeah we're just a part of him so we get a measure of him come on but still yet that manager still have the same potential right because ocean and a teaspoon of the ocean has the same ingredients so you and I must understand that if we're gonna make a rapture there must be a relationship not only just a fellowship a relationship is that right because Judas had a fellowship but he never had a relationship so we need to be closer to Judas is to God than Judas was is that right the problem said except your righteousness exceeds the Pharisees you will in no wise make it that used to just get to me what do you mean Pharisee mean they were perfect in every way they did everything right they watched and they look just good on the outside but what happened is that their righteousness was like filthy rags because it was their righteousness and in order to supersede or exceed even the righteous of the Holy Ghost human righteousness of the Pharisees you must have the righteousness of the Holy Ghost and Jesus said he became my sin that I might become the righteousness of God well I'm coming to something because I want you to understand that this Holy Ghost in you has the potential has a variability has a very strength of God because it is God it is God and I think we fail to see that the Holy Ghost is God is that right that's what Jesus said he said I will pray to the Father that he will send another comforter hallelujah well because when Jesus in the flesh was here with his disciples he was the comforter hallelujah but he said I must die I must go away so that God Himself will send you another comforter he said that the Holy Ghost hallelujah what was God doing he was sharing himself away from the flesh of Jesus and he came down himself on the day of Pentecost it was God Himself the very life that occupied the body of Jesus was now in the body of the believers see that's why we don't we don't need no second hand thing we don't need an imposter we need the real thing right the kind of Holy Ghost had contained you from glory to glory you mean to tell me you get the Holy Ghost you are going to make mistakes absolutely but in all of that you're growing from glory to glory from a child to a fool that's you of Christ hallelujah but I read that scripture Matthew 6 only because you realize no matter how righteous and holy you think you are we we as Christians can never ever say a hold a grudge or say I will never forgive right because if you do that then all of your living is in vain only those who can forgive will make heaven hallelujah because God said if you can forgive your brethren you said what well first look what they did a look what they did to Jesus look what they did hey none of us have had clothes of clowns when I hear none of us have been beaten all night not not more than likely none of us have ever been spat in the face come on and you look and we see what he had to go through and then he gets right up there in agonizing pain they call that word excruciating and he says Father forgive them for they know not what they do right relationship you know I need a shepherd mm-hmm now I don't know about you but I need a chef but I need somebody to lead me and I can't leave myself y'all know what I'm saying you know when I when David said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want David had full confidence in God full assurance he was a real sheep though he made mistakes he knew that his shepherd knew the place or the way he was leading them and often time we tried to figure out what God is doing stop that nonsense the just shall live by faith wherever he leaves me I follow that's where we must be in order to have a relationship with God we must learn first of all how to trust him that's one of those great Commandments trust the Lord with all your heart and do what me not to your own understanding mm-hmm hallelujah God loves to get you in trouble so he can get you out it's the truth he's a warrior and the only way he can express himself is through you because no man have seen God at any time hallelujah and the Bible said except the son and he has declared him right because he told John this is the relationship he excuse me so Philip when you see me you see the father hallelujah and so you and I must understand the relationship between the father in the son if you want to put it this way or the relationship between you Jesus and you it's supposed to be when you see me you see Jesus but that can't happen until you and I allow God to take control Alleluia and we have difficult situations sometimes think about it when Jesus as a man was ready to take cavalry along he said father I would that you this cup pass from me he didn't want to do it as a man he did not want to do it God don't hold you charge it because you don't want to do it God holds you chargeable because you don't do it you understand me there's a lot of things that are God requires and asked of us and sometimes we don't want to do it but God looks at whether you do it or not hey the boss man say take out the trash you may not feel like taking it out but you're gonna take it out is that right oh you can give come up with all cosmic Europe but it's cold out there it's below zero all I ask you would take out the trash now the weather report right and you know I must understand by God's grace he doesn't what no backtalk he just want us to do it where he leaves me a relationship is a connection it is an association or an involvement a connection between persons by blood or marriage and our relation ship is by both is my blood and by marriage hallelujah because we are the bride and a wife of God is that right because the Bible said look here's the white the Lambs wife and she has made herself ready showing that there's something you and I must always do and that is surrender our will to him that's how it gets done let go and let God have his way is that right oh that's right Philip said Lord show us the father said well wouldn't you Philip what's wrong with you you say show us the father and I've been with you all this time I understand when you see me you see the father hallelujah probably because the father was in Jesus and he already had already declared I don't do nothing except he show me to do it she that was the thing that man could not pull that veil back and see the God behind the veil is that right because when he said I my father 1 those Pharisees weren't to stone him you know why you want to stone me have I not done what the scriptures say I'm supposed to do if you don't believe me for what I say what about the works believe me for the works and that's what I'm saying it's not enough to say I'm Christians without the works there must be some evidence you and I must prove that we're not from satyrs either hallelujah oh my you and I must know you know this is the way the man of God says listen he says let them people who deny the power of God said it wrong but that same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that got the Holy Ghost Oh see what it is we think we got some kind of water down Holy Ghost there's no such a thing there's no such a thing it's a pretty good Christian you he's a good Christian or you're not and if you're a good Christian that means you got God on the inside it's not either do the works but it's him that's him mean that do the words right and if there be any glory it all goes to God hallelujah listen like I was saying there's a Serie of perfection just like this world is a world of death this world is a world of unperfect right imperfection is that right it's a world of failures and everything so there's a positive the negative this is a negative so the positive must be somewhere hallelujah a place where everything is perfect we cannot even fathom that but it's real you know even even though even among scientists and science amen they have discovered these phenomenal things that that they cannot even explain you know some of them have seen what they call angels and UFOs and all of these things and they know it doesn't come from this world but they don't know where it comes from right and so you look at this thing and you said well brother what are you trying to say a relationship with God will take you there losing your mind now but you know if you read the Book of Ezekiel Ezekiel the Bible said the Spirit of the Lord lifted Ezekiel up by his hair but I want out when I see Ezekiel I want to ask him how was that man you said what what do you mean brother books listen God can move whatever he wants to move from one place to another God is not imprisoned by time you understand me God is eternal hallelujah and listen you say what do you mean God took John the John is that right who was on the Isle of Patmos and transformed him all the way to this time well cuz John saw this very United States hallelujah and Jesus remember when Satan said listen I'm giving you the whole world if you bow down to me he even sure what that was no bargain Jerusalem the way they were but he took him in time and showed him the great cities and what it would be like and you can't you could come on you're gonna you're gonna entice somebody with a horse and buggy when there's a there's a there's a car jet or something come on no sir no he showed him the future of what it would be in his Eden this is Lucifer's either this is the devil's Eden he's ruling and he's being worshipped as God and told Jesus I'd give all of this to you if you bow down he says no son I'm the word if anybody gonna bow you go to bow to the word right hallelujah well he knew that through Calvary he would purchase all of this and he renovated every demon every devil everything that Lucifer now holes would be destroy everything even Lucifer himself hallelujah read the book of Revelation 1 angels takes him and throw him in the lake you think I let me stop but you know at least I'll be on the sidelines cheering I don't know who the angel is but he wouldn't bother me none listen because I think the devil is the most coolest being ever and he's a perversion of God just as God's the divine love cannot be explained Satan's evil and darkness cannot be explained can't be comprehended it's just the opposite right y'all know what darkness according to science is the absence of light so there is no light in Lucifer even though watch this now because he used to be the that the angel of light he was the beautiful cherubim now ask tell me anything go down in the depths of the ocean where there are there is no light and all the fish look like monsters shadowing and type of hell where there is no light there are monsters come on about eight you said what are you saying I'm trying to tell you that just like God has has how could you say beautify the meek with salvation Satan has perverted men and women with darkness help us Jesus is that right see that the same power that spoke the world into existence is in the people that's got the Holy Ghost men and women and it's time that we find out who you are the devil is trying to hide you back tell you that you you some little countdown something you're not your sons and daughters of God the deity is not in heaven it's in you that's what he is guarding you not in a stable not in the Bethlehem hallelujah hey men he ain't no pain he's not just in heaven he's in you Jesus Christ our hope of glory hallelujah but until you know what you got you're gonna always be a failure you understand me cuz faith is always tried and that's all every battle you have is the devil trying your faith I say challenge but it's a challenge only when you feel like you got a real opponent but there's no challenge when you know the opponent is already whooped hello people say there was a challenge with with David no it wasn't David I said hey I'm taking your head off and David didn't even have a sword hallelujah he said not only will I kill you Brahma take your own off right by his own spoken word by his that inspiration that came upon him right and guess what he did it I don't care if David would have stumbled and fell and came up and it would have caught the Giant exactly what God warranted hallelujah why because it was God who's aiming the stone not David understand when you got obstacles and when you got enemies let the Lord fight your battle we thought our battles along knees not with our fists not with guns and swords we fight the Lord's battle on our knees that right that's why Jesus came the Bible says we have not a high priest that cannot be touched by the feelings of our infirmities he came as a man so he could feel what you're going through but I've said so he could suck her suck us so he can comfort us that right Oh glory to God this is what it's all about that relationship you know when you can trust God no matter what the circumstances are probably I don't care as a million-to-one you know you the winner huh I know that sounds far-fetched but it's true who's greater than God that's what God said listen Gideon you got too many people huh that cut this thing down thirty thousand cut it on down it went all the way down to three hundred against thousands cuz God don't need the muscle of man all God need is faith hallelujah man listen God said if you have the faith of a mustard seed you can move a mountain you speak to the mountain amount that has to be moved hallelujah you know what faith is it has it has how can I say it faith doesn't never waver if you got faith and you said oh uh I want God to do something and here you hit this way today no you just got hope faith is steadfast I don't care how it looks which way it moves God says so right and that's the kind of relationship God wants from us that when we ask of him believing that we shall receive the thing that we ask for her because we ask in faith a time is no element God will do it when he wants to do it and sometimes God you say okay you got faith let me do it when I want to do it see anyway when you want to do it faith okay witness done faith is already declared is done yeah is that right sees of Abraham is that the truth the Bob said Abraham staggered not at the promise of God twenty-five years he kept saying me and Sarah we gonna have a baby and they had it he wasn't worried and you know Oh Lord what I'm gonna do know when you got a testimony we've got a sister right now sister Karen who operation basically paralyzed her she said I walked into the hospital I'm a walk out she walked in and she walked out then after she got out the devil tried to tripped her and she fell and some other things took place and then she had the lost lost or she had to walk with a walker and everything she called my wife and I the other day says hey brother she said I'm walking not only she says not only will I walk but God is going to restore my hand to the ladies should be dead but it's by your confession is if you give up God will to come true but if you says lord I know you promise me and I'm gonna walk I don't care how y'all understand me why I tell people I said I faith is something that drops in your heart you don't go to school for it yes like when God told me to get that job I wouldn't got that job years ago and and when the man told me after I filled out my application everything he said I don't have I'm so sorry I don't have no place for you you know I didn't cry oh god well no I felt such a piece and by the time I got home to mend and already called my life tell him come on back up here well ha what happened he said no I didn't have a place for you but I made a place somebody help me you mean to tell me God opened doors how the man can shot it but God will open it if it's God's will hallelujah I've seen him work for me like that oh I could tell some stories I've got some good things some good testimonies but but the point is he calls for a relationship one of the greatest things that most Christians fail to do is make Jesus Christ their friend we make anybody else our friend but Jesus Christ is the man with the law and he's gonna condemn you know the Bible said he came with grace and truth so it's the devil that makes you think that Jesus Christ is there to cut your head off you understand me it's the devil that makes you think that the Lord is there to punish you it's God's do you think he went the Kauri just to punish you he came to save us and in that saving there's a lot of grace and mercy the Bible said he Claire do you not lose one hallelujah is that Alright God is teaching me how not to be selfish you all right brother God is teaching her you know I know he's tired I'm just missing but anyway we're not you know we selfishness be so small right separateness you know it's just just a little you know you asked me did someone ask you to do something and you prefer yourself when you know you've got time to do it those little things that that's where God is deal I told my wife that the other day I said that's what God is dealing with me on because you know somehow my time is so important but you know the thing is I forget to see what God wants me to do you see them saying see that's what I the Bible said acknowledge the Lord in all your ways and he shall direct your path that's what we I have fallen and failed many times because I don't ask God what he wants me to do just a moment time and he'll give you the answer just like that and that's what God has been doing with me he has been giving me grace to deny myself and to choose others hallelujah she and that's that that's the thing because in all of that perfection comes right you see what Brotherhood I don't understand it remember Simon he asked Jesus to come by his house and Jesus knew Simon was gonna make fun of him but he was allowed to go by Simon's house knowing he was going to be mistreated now how many of us would have done that go by some early house they know you're gonna be mistreated he did it anyway because he was led to do it why because Simon wasn't the business of his main business there was a woman that was going to stop by Simon's house and Jesus had to be there hallelujah sometimes God will ask you to do things go places and be in places that you probably wouldn't normally go but when he does if you if you have a relationship with him you'll know it is God and if it's God he's gonna make it manifest your purpose for being there that's the kind of relationship I want that's what I'm striving for I I want that kind of relationship that all he's got to do is nod his head and I don't know what he wants to be done right see you and I must understand you know we look back and we think fair to see who this created this is the Creator we talk about he made life he is life whatever bombs or bees or ducks or chickens whatever you see God made it so you saw what God the God that you claim that is in you so if he made everything wait why can he heal everything he is the healer no doctor can heal you they can put your bone back together but they can make it grow together what doctor you ever known have given sight to the blind what doctor you have known a men that was able to raise the dead I'm not talking about 2,000 years I'm talking about in this lifetime I'm a witness I've seen to twice me a woman and a man raised from the dead did it hit the papers no it didn't belong in the papers there was a children's bread when people think God is there God ain't dead I was tell her a lady the other day my battle or whatever I went through the cat we can say yeah and she said well you know God still works miracles a man so you saw what do you mean brothers I want you to understand that's the kind of God I serve you saw her brothers what does this mean why are you working with this because if there is not an intimate relationship with you and God when the rapture take place you're not going it must be intimate he must know you and you know him is that right because when there's a lord have we not cast out Devils we've done great things in your name and Jesus I depart from me you workers of iniquity because I never knew and that word new in Greek is intimate he didn't know them intimately he loved the Lord I'm almost done I'm not gonna be long tonight but I want you to see the power of the blood because you got to understand what why in the Old Testament they had lambs and goats and bulls that were sacrificed for the believer but it could only cover it could only cover the sin you know I mean like like you've heard me it seemed he Illustrated it was like a bump in the road it was still there but the blood of Jesus Christ didn't just give you a bump in the rug it took away the bump it takes away all sin and this is what people this is why for I don't know whether I won't that hole it goes or not it just don't look right that's the devil Strait is God don't you know once you get the hole I mean really get the ceiling of the Holy Ghost you are so justified as though you've never seen in the first place there is not one thing that Satan can come up with that can keep you out of heaven not one thing oh he did this he did that open up but God has already put everything you've ever done in the sea of forgetfulness and you God can't even see oh yes in all it getting the Holy Ghost is all that is its Lord Jesus coming to my heart and just letting go and let God get yourself a berth and then God to make the rest happen that's hallelujah you may feel it at that time and you may not but one thing for certain your desires will change and you keep reading your Bible because it's food for the Soul and that Bible that word will transform you from glory to glory you won't have to quit it these bad things the bad things will quit you hallelujah is right the land was just a substitute until the fullness of time when he God made flesh right to take away sin and there now that chasm was out there right but now that the blood of Jesus Christ has come there is no chasm there is no chasm between the believer and God know why because when you are united with Christ you are in Christ the one I will tell you somebody and we we all fall short sometimes God said go pray and you said Lord I in just about five minutes I got God ain't no angel in your weight on you when the God wants you to pray he want you to pray then now five minutes God is going to do whatever he else is gonna do and that's what people don't understand God don't wait on you those of us who have children when you know what says Oh bring me that book and then they stop pitting around doing everything else but break did you hear me I said bring me that book right you're not gonna go a third time well I don't write because you know that here oh there's nothing like talking to a child and you know they deliberately ignoring you come on somebody I got grandkids and I got some grandkids that can hear only when they won't do they carry on and do whatever I got to do while you're talking to them then when you raise your voice didn't like wow like no you heard me the first time you see and that's what people don't understand when it comes to the power of the blood there is nothing see we're not like God in the sense that God can forgive and forget we can we can forgive but because we're humans we can't forget but sometimes the devil says seen you remember that so you haven't forgotten oh you haven't forgiven but that's not true but when you forgive and you're earnestly forgive that means you don't have those funny feelings in your heart no more concerning that person right but you will always remember and let me tell you something memory is really good because it'll keep you from being a foolish person is that right yeah you know you don't have to tolerate a person's bad behavior you can even love him but you hate that behavior right the Bible said I'm talking about relationship of fellowship and relationship with the father now I say the father because jesus said I go to my father and he's gonna send you a comforter and who did he send himself she cuz nobody can protect you if he he was the perfection of Jesus Christ he's got to be the first perfection of you there's no other perfection there's no second holy goes the third Holy Ghost there's only one Holy Ghost and that Holy Ghost is the same one who overshadowed Mary is that right and they say God the father's is Jesus daddy but the Bible said the Holy Ghost overshadowed Mary so maybe must be the Holy Ghost and the father's the same that's what people don't understand he's not three persons it's only one but three offices right I'm a preacher I'm a husband and I'm a grandpa but I'm the same person ain't gonna handle my children my grandchildren I can't handle my wife because I'm grandpa you see the difference and that's what God did he was God Father in creation son right in Redemption and the Holy Ghost in the church today the same God changing mask now who is he and where is he now he's in his bride and if the same God is in his bride he the relationship will cause them to do the same thing Jesus did that's why we're called Christians we act like God we talk like God we do miracles like God hallelujah you love the Lord the Bible said that's what he said a little while you you'd not see me anymore but yet you shall see me right he said because what I'll be in you not only just with you I'll be in you that's what Kaveri was all about that God Himself could come down and sanctify a people clean him up change them so that he can come in and occupy your body said brother books I can't believe God can occupy your body well God Devils can do it Devils come I mean even some of the how could I say to the uh these these Orthodox churches know that demons come and living people they talk out of them they act out of them huh you ever seen a demon-possessed person I have and you say all brother words what are you saying let me tell you something oh my you and I have no idea but you ever seen anybody smoke they hide in a cold cold cold freezing but that cigarette demon that says you gonna smoke me today I don't care if it's 30 below and then get out there and you go like it like like they really enjoying it but you see they're cold but the demon is enjoying it so your demon won't stay with you if you don't let him use you come on somebody you don't that's why I try to tell people you don't even need the Holy Ghost so overcome cigarettes you just need to stop smoking if you stop smoking that's like resisting the devil and he'll flee from you he will leave you alcoholism the same way stop drinking you see what brother I'm gonna go through this and I'm gonna well if you have faith you won't I know plenty of people who never did hallelujah but so if you do then it makes you know that something else was living in your body and they don't like the idea that you didn't shut down on him what about the Holy Ghost and come on somebody the Holy Ghost in you will make you do things you wouldn't normally do mmm when I first got saved and God gave me the Holy Spirit I was on the corners beating my tambourine and preaching on the corners and everything else singing and all that huh it was what I did I didn't have to say who you mean tell me I know I was Elias to do it something wouldn't let me not do it even the neighborhood talked about because they knew how wicked I used to be now come on some party see them old people said well ooh we know you don't change the change must be seen if there's no seat a change that seen it is not something wrong how can you cut on the light and not see like I said the seed produced a tree viii con is that right and you've heard me say that many a times when you see a con that a con got so many trees in it but you can't count the trees in the a con you might have a a country and then you can count two icons in the tree but not the trees in the a con because that one a con could have thousands of trees in there hello you no until his planted y'all see what I'm saying in that one little C think about what comes up out of that and all you're going to do with the letters would be planted let it rot and the lifer come out of it it'll grow it doesn't come up become a full-grown tree in a day just like Christians don't become a full measure of Christ in the day you've got to grow into it little by little hallelujah trial at the tire test after test hallelujah but he knows the path in which he leads us that's what I love about the Lord he knows the Shepherd knows where the good grass is just like the prophet of God said if you take the right mentor out - - toward any divine promise of God it will bring it to pass and I believe that I believe just as sure if you say you know you have the right attitude about God's promised word he'll make it happen and I'm about right too close but I'm gonna tell you this in my relationship you know when you have a friend in that relationship you enjoy talking with your friend so when you can say you can't pray something's wrong with the relationship because we're good on those phones and we can just talk talk talk talk talk never think about how long we've been on the phone unless we got another engagement coming up you know what I'm saying but when Jesus get down when we want to get down with Jesus you know we do 15 20 minute prayer and you don't need you don't even give god time to talk y'all know you ever met some people I know some people they talk like they're you know getting out no time sometimes I have to apologize I sigh I say I'm so sorry you call me you could talk but you know you get so excited the person is calling you and then you jump right in there you know and but at least there's a conversation that goes on what about the conversation that you have in your prayer life you wait to hear God speak cuz he does and the more intimate you become the more you will hear his voice you should never get off your knees and not hear nothing God is not that kind of a person if you come to talk to him he's gonna talk with you but intimacy brings you to that awareness you understand me now I'm almost done I just got one month well you know I like to say it like this I tried to do something tonight tonight and as I said I feel I feel so much better now it's amazing what the anointing will do but when it comes to you knowing where you are see you got to know where you are in Christ because otherwise you won't know where you're going and the Holy Ghost in this Bible is the only one can tell you where you are and you do not please sir please ma'am don't ever say what I'm not there if the Holy Ghost has already showed you that's where you are he understand me don't claim perfection if you know you're not perfect because the perfection in which God is talking about you will know he brings you to a perfection he ain't talking about the perfection of your flesh he's talking about the perfection of your character and that character will be perfected by the Holy Ghost because it is the Holy Ghost growing up into Christ when the word of God becomes your Amen when the word of God becomes yo yo yo absolute and this is where God is trying to bring us you said will you falter in this yes because the devil knows how to trick us but when it comes to willful sinning no sir no not with God in you God will not let you willfully sin hello the devil will trap you trick you up trip you up catch you in places where you know me but you're not going to say well I'm going out drinking tonight I used that for an example but any anything you want to say you know I say by God's grace when God get ready to use you he use you you must be holy you must be perfect and you know I say these things you know why I keep saying I'm I'm working with something because if the rapture is at hand we must meet his criteria we must meet we must come up I believe that you know we can't just come to church and be church members in church this net oh it was good I enjoy that in it the life of God must be formed and trends you must be transformed changed this is what I'm working on this is what I'm asking God every day to change me and make me more like you and every little thing I do wrong I want to see what I'm doing I want to know I'm done it wrong so I can make it right this is where I'm at because I believe with all my heart my fellowship and relationship with God must get greater I haven't arrived where I want to be but I won't I'm pressing I'm moving in that direction you know what I mean I'm calling up my friend see he's my friend I'm calling up my friend in prayer I'm talking to him in prayer you understand me you know because the more you be together with your friend the more you become closer to your friend that's just the way it is and a lot of us a men are just associates with Christ God wants more than an associate he wants a real friend that right that's what he told Abraham he's at Abraham you're my friend Oh best day working hard on character denying ourselves bringing ourselves to submit to the Word of God when I say this by God's grace you see a man that's standing before you that when I when God saved me I had a lot of false had a lot of failures trying to walk his way you know I had a lot of demons a lot of people won't say that but I did I hope I did it back now just trying to keep you away does that some love it but you know we we know that God is it's good to us he's been better to me than I've been to myself I say that all the time but I don't want no trouble at the river you know when I die I don't want it to be a scary scene you know I don't want to hold I want to be on my definitely and hoping I've made it when the Bible said make your calling and election I believe with all my heart that when those true Saint Paul says o death where is your sting o grave where is your victory but thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he wasn't afraid of death he wasn't afraid to die even though he had to go to Nero's chopping block he was rejoicing because he knew he could never die he knew that this exit out here was an interest to that that land or that world to come many men who have gone home like I think to myself I said you know it's the truth education and easy living has been our greatest in it now sometimes we get so smart we feel like we don't need things get so easy easy right you know put your dye on your nipple or whatever into the Machine and you can get food when it's people out there stuff you know I mean when we go to the grocery store we get these buggies full you know it's just easy in America compared to where it is in other places and those things work against the Christian because somehow it makes us lazy but during the time doing when the Christian needed God they had to pray for the next meal they had to pray that God would bless them with shoes clothing because they didn't have did y'all know that's the way the church came up but now they rich and increased with good and now they feel like they don't need nothing and that's that's where the devil gets us don't ever feel like you don't need nothing oh I got it good uh-uh I like it I like it when I have to need I like wanting I like asking God y'all know what I'm saying I'm happy being this way I chose to be this but I think God food is loving-kindness [Music] hallelujah [Music] friend mention [Music] Jesus is a friend [Music] anything Fred [Music] [Applause] [Music] Jesus is a friend Oh covered by [Music] Jesus that's resting [Music] [Music] Jesus that's me [Music] [Music] hallelujah amen hey Lord for for the lease hear him as our new hey man he's just recently moved here mistaken praise Lord sir wolves you see for the lease more often they been so I know we've all that's a church been praying for musicians for how many years many years years you know but like I tell my little children you know one day to God is a thousand to us alright so it hasn't been that long I'm gonna stay right on [Music] and the devil beat me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] another state [Music] [Music]
