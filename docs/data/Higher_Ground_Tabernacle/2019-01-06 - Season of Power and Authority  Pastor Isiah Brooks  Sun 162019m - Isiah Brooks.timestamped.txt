[30:03] morning that you bless the service or
[30:06] not your servant anoint your people they
[30:10] have come to hear from you Lord I'm not
[30:13] even worthy to stand behind this podium
[30:15] down know it but it's because of the
[30:18] grace of God your grace and your shedded
[30:21] blood of your dear son that I am able to
[30:23] stand and I just ask O God this morning
[30:27] that you will speak through this
[30:29] servants mouth shut him down that you
[30:32] may be able to speak in your name Jesus
[30:36] Christ we pray amen you may be seated
[30:46] I believe it was brother Jasper that
[30:49] came and he spoke on seasons and every
[30:56] since he spoke I I just can't get it out
[31:00] of my mind and my system because I
[31:07] realized that everything we go through
[31:13] here in this dimension will never last
[31:16] forever
[31:18] everything is a season there's a time
[31:21] period it's a period that mark is marked
[31:27] by certain conditions or activities you
[31:32] and I know that you can't go sledding in
[31:41] the summertime at least not here in Des
[31:45] Moines and so we realized that only
[31:50] sledding could be done unless you have a
[31:53] man-made system going on somewhere in
[31:55] the wintertime where there's a season of
[31:59] snow very seldom do you find anybody
[32:05] here in Des Moines swimming this time of
[32:11] the year because of its coal and icy
[32:16] rivers but in the summertime because it
[32:23] is the season it's a season of warmth
[32:25] and and because of it people do the
[32:31] things that are comfortable to do in
[32:34] whatever season it may be in I believe
[32:38] with all of my heart that our season is
[32:42] changing 2018 was a hard year for me it
[32:50] was a difficult time full of trials
[32:55] temptations failures
[32:59] but God knows about it all one thing I
[33:07] know about God his purpose for me huh
[33:12] and its purpose for you can never be
[33:16] defeated everything was made by him and
[33:22] was created by him
[33:26] none of his word can come back void and
[33:33] the message I know my Redeemer liveth
[33:37] the prophet of God said but nothing can
[33:41] defeat the purpose of God nothing can
[33:48] therefore I rest assure upon the promise
[33:53] because I live you shall also live I
[33:58] join with Jove of old I know my Redeemer
[34:03] liveth and at the last day he'll stand
[34:08] on the earth
[34:09] it's a purpose that God has I must serve
[34:15] his purpose the whole life must be
[34:20] brought into his purpose and to his
[34:23] program each of us is that way God has a
[34:30] purpose Abraham could endure as seeing
[34:35] him who is invisible because it was the
[34:39] purpose of God that he know that God
[34:42] gave him the promise no matter how
[34:47] contrary everything seen that right now
[34:51] you and I have some contrary situations
[34:57] but he said no matter how contrary
[35:01] everything seems God gave Abraham that
[35:05] promise so God will fulfill his promise
[35:10] he did too
[35:12] brahim he did to all of his children and
[35:16] he will keep his promise so you and I
[35:22] can rest assure that no matter how
[35:27] confusing our lives may be right now
[35:32] we'll still in the plan and purpose of
[35:37] God and this is just a season that we're
[35:43] going through now we believe that we're
[35:46] coming into a season of power and a
[35:50] season of authority I believe that
[35:54] because this message is the message of
[35:58] redemption and the message of redemption
[36:02] is to bring back that which was fallen
[36:08] to its original state and I believe that
[36:14] we are now being brought back we may
[36:17] have valleys we may have seasons where
[36:21] there is a drought in our land we may
[36:25] have a time when we feel like we thirsty
[36:28] and can't find in the water but God has
[36:32] already determined the beginning from
[36:36] the air and the Bible tells us that God
[36:40] wants us to know that we ought to expect
[36:44] a happy ending of evening of prosperity
[36:52] our ending a victory and not an ending a
[36:57] purple failure I believe we should enter
[37:02] this year with bravery and power God
[37:07] love brave soldiers God don't like
[37:10] coward soldiers God don't want our
[37:14] soldiers he want bravery is that right
[37:19] sometimes we go through a season like
[37:22] Gideon God you say you
[37:26] with us but we'll be all your miracles
[37:30] see God doesn't like being challenged
[37:34] like that
[37:35] God wants us to see his miracles and so
[37:40] Gideon saw where he meant that he was
[37:44] being defeated he had heard what God had
[37:47] done in William branham's life but he
[37:52] wanted to see the same God a William
[37:54] Branham in his life and he said God will
[37:59] be all the miracles if you are with this
[38:01] bride where are you and everybody in
[38:06] this message need to have a personal
[38:10] relationship with God you ought to be
[38:14] able to see God in your life not
[38:19] yesterday today and every day God should
[38:24] be visible to you hallelujah now
[38:29] entering in this year of 2019 with the
[38:33] attitude that I'm more than a conqueror
[38:36] I'm not a failure I can't be a failure
[38:40] when he saw me I was a failure
[38:45] hallelujah but now he has made me by His
[38:50] grace
[38:51] more than a conquerer is that right
[38:55] first of all you must adapt the attitude
[38:58] is there anything too hard for God
[39:02] wait a minute of is there anything too
[39:06] hard for God hallelujah God had to prove
[39:12] it to Mary and Martha that there was
[39:15] nothing too hard for God if God can take
[39:19] a man that was dead for four days maggot
[39:23] eaten wormed eaten hallelujah swollen
[39:28] nose is falling in the stench of his
[39:32] rotting body filled the air and God all
[39:37] God had to do was cry out
[39:40] Lazarus come forth hallelujah he said
[39:45] listen Mary Martha if you believe what
[39:48] I'm telling you you see today who is the
[39:51] resurrection chick with us I am the
[39:54] resurrection I am the life oh we could
[39:58] put God in the future I know when the
[40:01] squeeze come I know when this happens it
[40:04] is God gonna do it but God don't want to
[40:06] be put in the future God is the future
[40:09] he wants you and me to see him as he is
[40:12] today
[40:15] hallelujah not just in the atmosphere he
[40:18] wants you and me to see himself in you
[40:25] right hallelujah see Paul said it he
[40:31] said if God before us you must
[40:33] understand that God is not your enemy
[40:36] God is not against you honey that's what
[40:41] Israel thought many times when things
[40:43] were going bad in the valley they
[40:46] thought with themselves can God be for
[40:48] us if God is for us then why are we gone
[40:52] through all of these trials sometimes
[40:55] it's just God's choosing sometimes is
[40:59] because of our disobedience hallelujah
[41:02] but no matter what it is which what it
[41:07] may be God has already declared in his
[41:10] word that all things work together for
[41:13] the good a bill who are called according
[41:18] to his what purpose if you're in the
[41:21] plan of God there's no failure
[41:26] hallelujah not one of us will lose the
[41:31] battle hallelujah not one of us will
[41:39] lose this battle
[41:41] because God chose you and me for this
[41:45] battle hallelujah and this battle is the
[41:49] battle that is greater than all of the
[41:55] hallelujah in this evil age this world
[41:59] will see Lucifer crown hallelujah you
[42:05] not must understand we are living in the
[42:07] worst age ever so much so brother
[42:11] Brennan call this age the God they are
[42:14] the Satan's Eden hallelujah but oh it is
[42:20] something else he not only called this
[42:22] Satan Eden but he called it the bride
[42:26] age hallelujah what a contrast Satan
[42:33] Lucifer in his glory being shaped and
[42:36] formed hallelujah and God in His glory
[42:40] in the bride of Jesus Christ being
[42:43] shaped and formed hallelujah you didn't
[42:49] come here by choice I don't remember it
[42:52] if I did have a choice but I'm gonna say
[42:55] it like brother Branham said you didn't
[42:57] come here by choice you didn't decide to
[43:00] be on human you didn't decide to be a
[43:03] man or woman God made that choice
[43:09] hallelujah God made that choice and you
[43:13] had nothing to do with it is that right
[43:18] so seeing Lord the picture is that right
[43:24] but seeing cannot stop the purpose of
[43:29] God God will not be defeated not you God
[43:36] will not be defeated and it was Satan's
[43:40] purpose to stop God he thought if he'll
[43:46] are God's creation it would stop him
[43:50] but what Satan didn't know because God
[43:54] never redeemed him if he had been
[43:57] medieval maybe he would have been
[43:58] redeemed but when he found out that God
[44:02] could not be stopped because he was a
[44:05] redeemer
[44:07] listen shot Satan at the Adam fair and
[44:12] Eve fair and he was Christ walking in
[44:16] the cool of the evening where I doubt
[44:19] him hallelujah
[44:21] he had a purpose and he allowed Satan
[44:26] through the serpent Tamar his creation
[44:29] but it was Lord because God wanted his
[44:34] creation to know that he knew how to fix
[44:36] it this is why sometimes our lives seem
[44:40] to be broken and fragmented but God
[44:45] allows it to be so so that you and I can
[44:48] understand he is a God of restoration
[44:52] he's a God that can fix every situation
[44:56] no matter how bad it looks see because
[45:02] sin came in women brought forth man
[45:05] which was secondary a perverted way God
[45:10] never could eat him out of the dust of
[45:13] the earth with his own hands but woman
[45:16] had to bring him through sex scuse me is
[45:19] that right
[45:20] so then what happened where we made our
[45:24] bodies from the dust of the earth that
[45:26] calcium that lumber that poor - that God
[45:30] had laid out there it's still being used
[45:33] one day the last bit of it will be used
[45:37] up that's right the lemma power will go
[45:40] down but God still makes me and from the
[45:43] dust of the earth and you come in on
[45:46] this earth without having any reason
[45:49] anyway you know way and all you had to
[45:53] bring yourself here God brought you here
[45:55] now wait a minute
[45:57] out of the billions and trees of people
[46:00] that could have been here God brought
[46:02] you here and if he brought you here he
[46:06] brought you here for purpose hallelujah
[46:12] Emmet everybody can't hear this message
[46:16] and if you can hear this
[46:20] God has brought you here for a purpose
[46:23] you've heard me say this before don't
[46:26] give up on God because God won't give up
[46:29] on you he can't do it he cannot give up
[46:34] on you because he cannot give up on
[46:37] himself hallelujah
[46:41] then if sin have lord it and God cannot
[46:45] be defeated then people are coming on
[46:47] the earth by a perverted way but still
[46:50] God's lumber is being used up the potash
[46:54] the calcium and the stuff he lets us eat
[46:57] uh uh till the soil and by the sweat of
[47:00] your brow you'll make your living but
[47:03] man come just exactly the same just
[47:06] exactly God still has his purpose in his
[47:10] mind your understanding I'm trying to
[47:14] bring us to something cause you and I
[47:15] must understand that we go through
[47:18] seasons but even the seasons can never
[47:22] stop the purpose of God there are times
[47:26] we feel strong we can conquer everything
[47:30] then that time we feel weak hallelujah
[47:34] and we sound like Paul some time oh who
[47:39] shall deliver me from this body of death
[47:42] every time I try to do good excuse me
[47:45] evil is there and every time I try try
[47:48] to hold myself evil is there and when I
[47:51] want to do good I can't do it
[47:55] hallelujah
[47:57] but Paul comes right around and he said
[47:59] thank God thank him for giving us the
[48:03] victory through our Lord and Savior
[48:05] Jesus Christ let me tell y'all something
[48:08] some of us Amen I don't care if you
[48:12] given all you had to feed the poor I
[48:18] don't care if you have faith to move
[48:22] mountains it doesn't matter if you visit
[48:29] the sick if you have faithfulness and
[48:32] all
[48:33] religious things those things don't mean
[48:37] one thing if you haven't seen the
[48:42] redeeming power of the blood of Jesus
[48:45] Christ somebody hit me this morning see
[48:50] because you got to realize that all God
[48:52] gave cable was a little lamb is that
[49:00] right the Alpha and Omega hello and what
[49:06] did I property and how they give us a
[49:09] lamb hallelujah because when the seals
[49:14] were broken and the way I was open the
[49:18] Bible said John look to see a lion but
[49:22] when he turned he saw a lamb remember
[49:26] there was none worthy to open the book I
[49:30] love that there was not worthy to open
[49:33] the book Paul wasn't worthy Peter wasn't
[49:36] worthy John wasn't worthy Moses wasn't
[49:40] worthy there was none of the prophets
[49:42] that were worthy to open the book but
[49:45] the lamb the lamb was worthy see you
[49:51] can't give God righteousness God gives
[49:54] you righteousness the only thing you can
[49:57] give God back is the lamb the bloody
[50:01] lamb and that is through the life of
[50:05] Christ at the end of the day if you
[50:09] think within your mind death is about to
[50:12] strike me but I've got a lot of good
[50:14] things I've done for Jesus you're lost
[50:20] hello you're lost at the end of the day
[50:24] I don't care how righteous you've been I
[50:27] don't care how holy you think you've
[50:29] been at the end of the day you know how
[50:33] you get into the gate by the blood of
[50:36] the lamb by the life of Christ what we
[50:40] call the token of a brother am coaster
[50:42] token that's the only way that's the
[50:44] only thing you can present to God Harley
[50:47] because how can i unworthy like bring
[50:50] forth worldly were worthiness you can't
[50:53] do it he was the only one running
[50:56] hallelujah and the only thing you can
[50:58] give back to God it's Lord the lamb
[51:01] because you sacrificed your life for me
[51:07] is that right
[51:08] remember I said last week you know we
[51:11] came into this world like the ugly
[51:13] dunkey ugly donkey ugly Mew whatever you
[51:17] want to call us cross-eyed it here stuck
[51:21] up one down not me
[51:25] ugly even that little doctor said you
[51:29] know I'm not even worthy they gonna take
[51:33] a hammer and hit me in that hallelujah
[51:38] but mama said don't worry about it
[51:41] hallelujah you've got a position you
[51:44] have a purpose no matter how messed up
[51:47] you look amen there has been one for you
[51:51] and because you're the firstborn
[51:55] hallelujah according to the law you must
[51:59] be saved hallelujah see that's how it is
[52:04] you and I we came in all messed up but
[52:09] we are the first born hallelujah
[52:12] is that Alright see what you must
[52:16] understand by God's grace he is our
[52:19] power and he is our strength y'all hear
[52:23] me
[52:24] 20:19 must be a better year for our
[52:29] victories hallelujah It was as if to me
[52:33] it was at least a season of failure for
[52:39] a lot of people a season for defeat but
[52:42] it was also a season of growth you're
[52:47] giving see you cannot even grow until
[52:50] you realize how much you are a failure
[52:56] wink I can show that you are a failure
[52:59] and then you can recognize
[53:01] I can't do it without you hallelujah I
[53:06] can't do this thing without your Lord
[53:08] see that's the only way you can become a
[53:11] VIP tour it's by recognizing you don't
[53:15] have the strength for the battle but
[53:19] every time you think you've got
[53:21] something to do with it every time you
[53:24] think oh I got it
[53:25] I can handle it you are in trouble cuz
[53:29] none of us can defeat Satan without the
[53:32] power of the Holy Ghost
[53:35] absolutely not hallelujah oh I feel like
[53:40] shouting this morning but I'm a priest
[53:42] in Amish I see we must realize by God's
[53:46] grace it meant that we must how could I
[53:53] say it there is no way that you and I
[53:57] can even substained from the appearance
[54:01] of evil without the Holy Spirit it is
[54:05] God who separates us is that right the
[54:09] best survival in the beginning the light
[54:12] and the day did not separate itself it
[54:17] was God who separated the night from the
[54:21] day y'all hear me it was God who
[54:24] separated is that right the firmaments
[54:29] God is the separator he's the one that
[54:33] can do it
[54:35] Abraham come out from your kindred see
[54:40] it was God who separated Abraham from
[54:44] his kindred it was God hello Abraham
[54:47] couldn't even separate himself from lot
[54:49] it was God who separated Abraham from
[54:53] lot why because God had a purpose but
[54:58] Abraham had to suffer while while he was
[55:01] with lot you know why because a lot
[55:04] likes a lot of things lot like the
[55:08] things of the world right and so you and
[55:11] I must realize that if there's a lot in
[55:14] your life and you tried to separate
[55:16] yourself from it you can't even do it
[55:18] but God will allow certain things to
[55:21] happen in your life to separate you a
[55:25] lot and one lot was separated from God
[55:30] whoo God could then bring the purpose
[55:35] and manifest the purpose for which he
[55:38] called Abraham hallelujah so you said
[55:43] abstain from all the appearance of evil
[55:45] and the very God of peace sanctify is
[55:49] you holy and I pray God your whole
[55:53] spirit and soul and body be preserved
[55:57] blameless unto the coming of our Lord
[56:01] Jesus Christ that's what we want we want
[56:04] a whole body a whole soul and spirit to
[56:08] be blameless and how we're going to see
[56:13] it happen
[56:16] God can God will do it hello some you
[56:24] sometimes you and I have to hit the
[56:26] bottom before we can go to the top when
[56:32] you've gone as far as you can go down
[56:34] the only way is to go is up it's all
[56:38] right I'm coming to something just a
[56:42] moment the Bible said he came unto his
[56:45] own what was the purpose of God if you
[56:49] could see Jesus Christ then you'll be
[56:52] able to see yourself God wanted his
[56:55] creation to know him to see him to feel
[57:02] him to embrace him right I don't even
[57:07] know how he does it
[57:10] there times I I forget one or two things
[57:13] maybe three or four things a day but God
[57:18] never forgets the only thing he will
[57:24] forget is when I'll see is a cast into
[57:27] the sea of forgetfulness but God even
[57:31] had to create a sea of forgetfulness in
[57:35] order for him to forget y'all hear me
[57:40] God hears every prayer you make even if
[57:45] it's Lord Jesus have mercy on me
[57:51] sometimes all we can say is lord I need
[57:53] you God I need your strength and it's
[57:59] not a low prayer which is okay there are
[58:02] seasons for short prayers and they're a
[58:05] season for long prayers sometimes you
[58:09] don't have he meant time for a protocol
[58:13] all you can do since I need you help me
[58:16] Lord God be merciful see but he hear
[58:20] those prayers too I'm enjoying myself
[58:26] because I know it's true x1 in a sense
[58:31] is it but but he came to his own skin
[58:33] first John 1:11
[58:35] he came into his own and his own
[58:38] received him not but as many as received
[58:41] him to do gave the power to become the
[58:46] sons of God even to them that believe on
[58:49] his name see what I'm saying so what it
[58:53] is is this in his plan God made it so
[58:57] that only his own could hear him hello
[59:04] hello right cuz you gotta understand
[59:08] snakes can't hear they moved by
[59:12] vibration hallelujah and the Bible said
[59:17] let him that have ears to hear let him
[59:20] hear
[59:20] then let you see them say so you and I
[59:24] have ears to hear the gospel you wonder
[59:29] why you see one thing about the seed of
[59:31] God amen he goes through his
[59:34] Changez but once he comes into contact
[59:36] with God he'd know who God is
[59:40] you can't ball it out it you can't burn
[59:43] it out of it
[59:43] you can't do nothing hallelujah because
[59:46] once it's in there there's no way it
[59:49] could come out of you they can crucify
[59:53] you they can chop your head off
[59:57] hallelujah and you'll never deny
[1:00:02] somebody it doesn't mean you got to be
[1:00:05] righteous and holy to do that but once
[1:00:07] the holy God comes into you once you
[1:00:10] have an experience with God there is no
[1:00:13] way even as a backslider you still know
[1:00:16] he's God boom x1 and they said but you
[1:00:21] shall receive power after which the Holy
[1:00:24] Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be
[1:00:26] witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and
[1:00:29] in all Judaea I'm trying to hurry up
[1:00:31] because you must understand that brother
[1:00:35] Branham brought the power out he says is
[1:00:36] not just like power his authority
[1:00:39] because it was Authority Authority is
[1:00:43] what we lost in the fall in the fall
[1:00:48] before the fall
[1:00:49] Adam had the authority over all the
[1:00:52] animals over the fish of the sea over
[1:00:55] the air he had authority over everything
[1:00:59] hallelujah but when he fell he lost the
[1:01:03] authority is that right brother Branham
[1:01:06] describe it like this he lost the title
[1:01:08] deed and the title deed went back to the
[1:01:12] owner her glory to God hallelujah but
[1:01:16] when God came down in as a man and he
[1:01:21] sacrificed his life and when he said you
[1:01:24] shall receive power after which the Holy
[1:01:26] Ghost has come upon you he was said I'm
[1:01:28] giving you back the authority that Adam
[1:01:33] lost in the garden hallelujah
[1:01:36] so if you've got the Holy Ghost you've
[1:01:39] got the same Authority the same power
[1:01:42] that Adam
[1:01:44] in the beginning but we must use it we
[1:01:48] must believe it
[1:01:50] the only what I'm saying you must
[1:01:52] receive it believe it and speak it
[1:01:59] hallelujah you must because it is given
[1:02:04] to us you hear me saying it oftentimes
[1:02:08] we must prove that we are not from
[1:02:12] Satan's either is this okay
[1:02:20] seasons 1-3 she will not like everybody
[1:02:24] else this is our season of authority and
[1:02:27] power I believe that I believe that and
[1:02:31] you and I must make a decree that we
[1:02:35] will not allow Satan to overrun our
[1:02:39] lives like he did last year we will be
[1:02:45] the god of Satan you must make a decree
[1:02:49] because God has sent you hallelujah
[1:02:53] think of how brother bad everybody want
[1:02:56] to be like him but brother Brandon was a
[1:02:58] brave soul he was not a coward no matter
[1:03:04] what circumstances he found himself he
[1:03:07] realized I don't have to fear me
[1:03:10] or what men can do to me because I've
[1:03:13] got God on my side and when he was
[1:03:18] challenged hallelujah he realized the
[1:03:22] challenge wasn't to him the challenge
[1:03:24] about God and when anybody in this world
[1:03:28] challenges you as a Christian they're
[1:03:31] not challenging you they're challenging
[1:03:34] the God in you hallelujah and when they
[1:03:40] challenge the God in you you can stay
[1:03:43] without fear you can spare because John
[1:03:49] said greater is He that is in us than he
[1:03:52] that is in the world and God will fight
[1:03:55] your battle
[1:03:58] every time see you must realize Satan
[1:04:01] must know in this year in this day in
[1:04:05] this hour that you have arrived we're
[1:04:09] not just a color bride will not come in
[1:04:13] the church and then just listen to some
[1:04:15] philosophy or some theologians but we're
[1:04:18] packing the power of Holy Ghost we're
[1:04:20] packing the power of this message and
[1:04:22] this message promised us a double
[1:04:25] portion of Elijah you gotta bring this
[1:04:30] in mind that's the mind of your head the
[1:04:33] mind of your heart when Satan makes you
[1:04:37] feel like you're being defeated tell
[1:04:39] them you are a liar I cannot be defeated
[1:04:42] I am the purpose of God don't you worry
[1:04:52] you got little issues with the world and
[1:04:55] you are a seed of God God is going to
[1:04:57] deliver you hello there sometimes we
[1:05:02] have things attached to us that we
[1:05:04] cannot deliver ourselves from and you
[1:05:07] think God don't know it God knows it
[1:05:12] hallelujah but sometimes he allows
[1:05:15] things to happen so you can get more
[1:05:18] thirsty for him because on the inside
[1:05:21] the inner man thirsts for holiness the
[1:05:25] inner man thirst for righteousness
[1:05:28] hallelujah and when that inner man
[1:05:31] sometimes he'd get to a place where you
[1:05:33] you done covered and smothered him after
[1:05:35] a while he said okay I'm gonna let you
[1:05:37] have the world just a little bit but
[1:05:39] you're coming back
[1:05:42] that's why the Bible said God even loved
[1:05:44] the back stylist you coming back
[1:05:47] hallelujah amen right now your mind shed
[1:05:50] is not right but I'm not worried about
[1:05:53] it because I saw you before the
[1:05:55] foundation of the world and I know what
[1:05:57] you're gonna do I know the expected end
[1:06:00] I know what's going to come forth out of
[1:06:03] you even when you don't know it
[1:06:08] blessed be the god
[1:06:10] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have
[1:06:13] blessed us with all spiritual yeah all
[1:06:27] of them you know I like I like peanut
[1:06:33] butter and jelly sandwiches I'm a grown
[1:06:35] man but every now and again I got to
[1:06:40] have me a peanut butter and jelly
[1:06:41] sandwich and I don't like it when the
[1:06:44] peanut butter is gone and to believe it
[1:06:50] believe it or not if I want a peanut
[1:06:52] butter jelly sandwich and my peanut
[1:06:53] butter is gone I go to the store and get
[1:06:55] me some more normally I get a jar that's
[1:06:59] gonna be big enough for me and the
[1:07:02] others but my whole purpose behind it is
[1:07:06] that normally I keep peanut butter and
[1:07:09] jelly in stock so that whenever I want
[1:07:15] it I can go get it
[1:07:17] now there is a season for it I don't
[1:07:19] need it every day
[1:07:21] I don't eat it every week but there
[1:07:24] comes a season when I like it and I want
[1:07:28] it y'all hear me it's already dead the
[1:07:31] blessing is already there see what I'm
[1:07:33] saying
[1:07:34] because God has blessed you at all
[1:07:36] blessing doesn't mean you gonna be
[1:07:38] having it these things happen all today
[1:07:40] but when it is need for God has it
[1:07:45] already in store for you they're yours
[1:07:49] it's there for you this is the season of
[1:07:53] power
[1:07:54] hallelujah not defeat this year we're
[1:07:58] gonna press toward that mark we're gonna
[1:08:01] come into the full sketch of Christ you
[1:08:04] gotta be determined to battle this thing
[1:08:07] it is a battle it is a war it is a fight
[1:08:09] because this flash is something you
[1:08:12] can't play with you give it an inch
[1:08:15] it'll take a mile that's the truth you
[1:08:18] give it just a crack it open the whole
[1:08:20] door is that right y'all know that's
[1:08:23] nothing but
[1:08:26] but he has chosen you and me in him when
[1:08:31] before the foundation of the world you
[1:08:34] think God don't know what's happening in
[1:08:36] your life
[1:08:37] he said Jeremiah I knew you before you
[1:08:42] were informed into your mother's belly
[1:08:44] you think God put that scripture there
[1:08:46] just for Jeremiah he knew that you and I
[1:08:48] were gonna read that same Scripture and
[1:08:50] come to the knowledge that God knew us
[1:08:52] before the foundation of the world I
[1:08:55] called you to be who you are with God
[1:08:58] ain't like brother son so he can just
[1:09:00] pray and think and happen just like that
[1:09:03] but God said I didn't call you to be
[1:09:07] like brother so-and-so I like you the
[1:09:10] way you are is that right in
[1:09:17] identification one of the sisters are
[1:09:21] told brother Branham the brother better
[1:09:24] I'd be fasting all the time and I still
[1:09:27] can't cast out Devils he said what God
[1:09:29] didn't call you to cast out Devils God
[1:09:32] called you to fast and he'll use
[1:09:35] somebody else to cast out Devils see
[1:09:39] what I'm saying and the devastation you
[1:09:41] can't cast out Devils you ain't no
[1:09:43] Christian you ain't got it cuz you can't
[1:09:47] cast out Devils hallelujah but one thing
[1:09:50] I can do is tell that devil you going
[1:09:52] everybody got a mouth and you can say
[1:09:55] Satan I bother you you coming out of
[1:09:58] here and however God choose to do it
[1:10:01] here God at the words of your mouth
[1:10:08] hallelujah
[1:10:09] one thing for certain we all got the
[1:10:11] ability to cast Devils out with our
[1:10:14] words but however God chooses to get him
[1:10:17] out there is God's business here and
[1:10:22] still he might have somebody on the
[1:10:23] other end praying and fasting hallelujah
[1:10:27] remember brother Brennan went into a
[1:10:29] intercessory prayer about this lady she
[1:10:32] was actually dying and all of a sudden
[1:10:35] he was out too he was supposed to preach
[1:10:36] before he preached he
[1:10:38] crying and crying out to God and Billy
[1:10:40] Paul says come on dad it's time to go he
[1:10:42] couldn't stop crying and praying and
[1:10:44] praying and all of a sudden he began to
[1:10:46] speak in tongues and everything else he
[1:10:48] heard somebody speaking in tongues you
[1:10:49] didn't know who it was it was him and
[1:10:51] and then he goes once once the lady was
[1:10:54] delivered at the same time he goes to
[1:10:56] the meeting and he finds out that there
[1:10:58] was a foreign lady who was near death
[1:11:01] and God had him praying for her
[1:11:05] deliverance and God healed her see
[1:11:09] that's how it works we are a body so
[1:11:13] when God moves on you to pray you may
[1:11:15] not feel like you have a need for
[1:11:17] yourself but the need is not for you
[1:11:20] it's for somebody else when somebody for
[1:11:24] God puts somebody on your heart pray for
[1:11:26] them if it's that but a short prayer
[1:11:29] hallelujah is God good to us
[1:11:31] he had predestinated us to adoption of
[1:11:34] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:11:36] according to his good pleasure and will
[1:11:38] that means God cannot fail Lord what I
[1:11:42] can be completely adopted he said you
[1:11:45] would be this whole adoption thing is
[1:11:48] because God is enjoying it
[1:11:50] it's about his will it's about looking
[1:11:54] at the devil and says I know you thought
[1:11:55] you had them but they were always mine
[1:12:00] mmm looking at the devil and saying to
[1:12:03] the devil I know you thought you had
[1:12:06] them
[1:12:08] but you don't because they were always
[1:12:12] mine is that right
[1:12:14] Malachi 4 he said I will make up my
[1:12:18] jewelz his jewels tell the devil I'm a
[1:12:23] jewel of God a man I'm a jewel of God no
[1:12:28] matter what I look like right now I'm a
[1:12:30] jewel of God and he's shaping me
[1:12:34] hallelujah that he will show me off one
[1:12:37] day y'all to know that God is gonna show
[1:12:41] you off it's the truth the whole purpose
[1:12:47] behind Keaney assure us
[1:12:51] I have solutions I can never pronounce
[1:12:52] that name but he wanted to show vastaa
[1:12:55] off right look look at this kingdom this
[1:13:00] was a kingdom of Persia right Babylon
[1:13:03] and all this man had purples and golds
[1:13:06] and silver he had all kinds of beautiful
[1:13:10] stuff everything looked majestic but his
[1:13:14] greatest treasure was his wife when they
[1:13:19] had seen everything and then drunk good
[1:13:21] wine
[1:13:22] he's a call for the king queen ha and
[1:13:28] God has done the same thing when we have
[1:13:32] gone through everything else and we
[1:13:34] banqueted at the fete at God's table he

[1:14:34] ain't what you determine is what he has
[1:14:36] already determined it's not what Satan
[1:14:39] determined is what God has already
[1:14:42] determined and God will never go back on
[1:14:47] his promise and that right oh come on

[1:16:32] your identity you either came from hell
[1:16:36] and you're going back to hell or you
[1:16:39] either came from God and you're going
[1:16:42] back to God you need to stop right now
[1:16:46] and decide who you are why am I here
[1:16:54] was it my choosing it was God choosing

[1:17:05] the more higher I would not have come my
[1:17:08] coming wasn't my choice my coming was
[1:17:11] his choice but
[1:17:16] got me here he's got you here and you
[1:17:19] and I need to make the best of it
[1:17:21] I didn't come to be just a church member
[1:17:24] I came to be one on the front line I'm
[1:17:29] on the front line for Jesus somebody so
[1:17:34] I'm not ashamed of this message I'm not
[1:17:36] ashamed of Jesus Christ
[1:17:39] I'm on the front line I came to fight so
[1:17:46] that people can see that this message is
[1:17:48] not a cult but this is the life of Jesus
[1:17:52] this is cries where Christ dwell in the
[1:17:55] people of God that's what I come for
[1:17:59] hallelujah look at the William look at
[1:18:02] William Branham if he had not submitted
[1:18:05] his life to Christ he would not have
[1:18:07] been with the scripture promise but
[1:18:10] because he was that seed that promise
[1:18:14] word that prophet hallelujah Malachi saw
[1:18:18] a man he made manifest it was God in him
[1:18:22] even when he was failing God raised him
[1:18:26] back up even when he was in a mode of
[1:18:28] disobedience God raised him back up
[1:18:31] hallelujah
[1:18:32] even when he lied God raised him back up
[1:18:35] even when he would have killed God
[1:18:39] raised him back up ba there was a
[1:18:42] purpose and nothing can defeat the
[1:18:46] purpose of God will fall will come shot
[1:18:52] we made backslide hallelujah but nothing
[1:18:56] will defeat the purpose of God God will
[1:19:00] bring it back around there will be a
[1:19:03] season of revival hallelujah
[1:19:06] God will allow his light to come into
[1:19:09] you Satan's got all hallelujah Satan's
[1:19:14] got all these traps but not one trap
[1:19:16] cannot stop the victory of God ah
[1:19:19] because the Bible said that Jesus Christ
[1:19:22] breaks the Fowler's snare I don't care
[1:19:25] what bird trapped the devil has got you
[1:19:27] in God is gonna set you
[1:19:29] free his purpose will be made halleluyah
[1:19:36] think about a number close on this note
[1:19:38] there was a man by the name of Samson
[1:19:43] God raised him up to defeat the
[1:19:50] Philistines but the Brenham locking him
[1:19:55] after Pentecost to church because he had
[1:19:58] a lot of signs and wonders that father
[1:20:01] hallelujah Samson in his days of glory
[1:20:06] killed a lion with his bare hands
[1:20:11] hallelujah he wasn't some bronze statue
[1:20:15] he wasn't some man with muscles that big
[1:20:18] hallelujah brother branham said he was
[1:20:21] just a small man kind of on your puny
[1:20:23] side halle-loo you see God God don't
[1:20:26] need our strength when he's got his own
[1:20:29] hallelujah he was just a small man on
[1:20:32] the peace but now when the anointed of
[1:20:36] God was strike him all things became
[1:20:39] possible hallelujah see Samson eight man
[1:20:45] he was doing well when they tried to
[1:20:48] capture him Samson took the job or woman
[1:20:53] asked and he slew what a thousand what
[1:20:59] was it three I can't remember how many
[1:21:01] think was a thousand right and the Bible
[1:21:05] said he slew a thousand and he put him
[1:21:09] up in pile one power two pounds three
[1:21:16] pounds
[1:21:16] he killed a thousand you try it you
[1:21:20] don't think some of us can't even beat
[1:21:23] one or less a thousand he beat and
[1:21:27] killed a thousand Philistines with the
[1:21:32] jawbone I believe
[1:21:38] hallelujah they tried to entrap them you
[1:21:41] see that's what Pentecostal people once
[1:21:43] you get under there London you do
[1:21:45] exploits you do things you really know
[1:21:47] you couldn't do hallelujah
[1:21:49] but Satan keeps us out of that anointing
[1:21:51] because he realized if you in the non
[1:21:53] tech you can do it that's your home
[1:21:57] place that's your place of safety but if
[1:22:00] he can pull you out of there
[1:22:02] he knows you got a call of mine and a
[1:22:05] call of mine can't help God hallelujah
[1:22:07] but if you under the anointing that
[1:22:10] anointing becomes the mind of Christ
[1:22:13] that anointing becomes the courage of
[1:22:15] Christ that annoying too becomes the
[1:22:17] faith of Christ and then you can move
[1:22:20] some mountains hallelujah in his
[1:22:23] glorious days is that right Sampson kill
[1:22:28] took the gates of Gaza can you because
[1:22:33] you've got to understand these things
[1:22:34] were heavy this is not you know not like
[1:22:36] our day some kind of looming them gates
[1:22:39] plastic these were real real strong man
[1:22:44] gates hallelujah and he picked that
[1:22:47] thing put about any but was it it was
[1:22:51] the anointing of God but let me ask you
[1:22:57] something did you know God knew this
[1:23:03] Sampson would fail God knew because God
[1:23:09] tested it
[1:23:11] Sampson weakness was beautiful women
[1:23:14] hello normally that's every man's
[1:23:18] weakness but this this he every time it
[1:23:24] seemed like Sampson had things under
[1:23:26] control you know I think I've got how
[1:23:27] many years it was that Sampson even was
[1:23:29] a judge over Israel so he was a
[1:23:34] prominent man and everybody knew God
[1:23:37] used him he was a Nazarite you know what
[1:23:41] I'm saying and that Nazarite was one who
[1:23:44] kept himself away from the world kept
[1:23:47] himself clean right kept himself he he
[1:23:51] had an order
[1:23:51] don't cut your hair because that is the
[1:23:54] Nazarite sign that's why women are not
[1:23:57] supposed to cut their hair because
[1:23:59] that's a nozzle right side your
[1:24:01] understanding that's why the Bible says
[1:24:03] she has power over her head because as
[1:24:06] long as she don't cut her hair she can
[1:24:07] pray to God straightway
[1:24:10] hallelujah God will hear her is that
[1:24:14] right
[1:24:14] so you don't have to go by way of a
[1:24:16] husband as long as she's got the hair of
[1:24:18] her head
[1:24:18] she's got power over her head and she
[1:24:21] can contact God woo somebody help me
[1:24:25] here right amen so you and I must
[1:24:28] realize Amen he was a Nazarite but all
[1:24:33] my Delilah I look that word up I looked
[1:24:38] up in several places Lila the last part
[1:24:46] it says it is it worse than creation he
[1:24:49] says a playful activity of a God and
[1:24:53] when when you know I thought about that
[1:24:56] because you know brother Branham said
[1:24:57] when when that pillar of fire was
[1:24:59] creating thing he was shouting and
[1:25:00] dancing around
[1:25:01] did y'all know that that Jesus dance
[1:25:03] that Diesel's get happy he said that
[1:25:06] little like just danced all around and
[1:25:08] and it's his creation he was happy about
[1:25:10] everything he saw when he said it was
[1:25:12] good hallelujah but then I thought about
[1:25:15] the lighter because that's the way she
[1:25:17] enchanted her name also come from a word
[1:25:20] of Enchantment seduction hallelujah yet
[1:25:27] delicate you know she was a song you
[1:25:30] know she wasn't one of these women you
[1:25:32] know that workout in the gym
[1:25:34] she was so Dilek she looked innocent she
[1:25:39] looked like she could be trusted but it
[1:25:43] was seduction your understanding that
[1:25:46] spirit seduced Samson and kept trying
[1:25:53] Samson if you love me oh honey you say
[1:25:57] you love me and every time you tell me
[1:25:59] these things it's never true you
[1:26:04] she walked him she walked him oh oh and
[1:26:14] everytime sounds would tell us third
[1:26:16] thing she set him up
[1:26:19] Samson broke the cards that the pins in
[1:26:22] the hair didn't do no good everything he
[1:26:25] told her would weaken him did not weaken
[1:26:28] weak him bring him to a weakness right
[1:26:32] but one thing he said if you cut out one
[1:26:35] of my virtues if you cut out one of my
[1:26:41] virtues seven locks if you cut out one
[1:26:43] of my virtues then my strength is gone
[1:26:49] hello
[1:26:50] that was the strength and is the
[1:26:53] strength of the bride the divine nature
[1:26:55] of God is your strength if your now
[1:26:58] Satan to cut your hair that's your
[1:27:02] headship that's what's on your head
[1:27:05] that's what's in your heart if you allow
[1:27:09] the devil to trim this to make you think
[1:27:14] it's not important this is what makes
[1:27:17] you a Nazarite it is the thing that
[1:27:20] separates you from the world and the
[1:27:22] churches hey somebody the Bible says if
[1:27:28] you like one of these things you are
[1:27:32] blood and did not is not that what
[1:27:35] happened as soon as Samson was captured
[1:27:40] they blinded his hey somebody help me
[1:27:46] here and soon as he was blind he became
[1:27:50] mockery that's what this devil does
[1:27:53] he'll get you to fall he'll get you to
[1:27:55] do something and soon as he plays blind
[1:27:57] your eyes out amen that's when the devil
[1:28:00] says she you thought she was a Christian
[1:28:01] see you thought you was this and look
[1:28:03] you ain't got power to do nothing no
[1:28:06] more but the Bible says at the same time
[1:28:11] they blind in his eyes his hair began to
[1:28:15] grow back
[1:28:16] hallelujah don't you worry God will
[1:28:20] never be to see that hill if God is in
[1:28:24] you he will never allow himself to be
[1:28:27] defeated it's not about you it's about
[1:28:32] God and God has chosen you to be bride
[1:28:36] that's who you are
[1:28:38] I don't care how many you have you
[1:28:41] need to tell the devil I'm bride I want
[1:28:44] you to know I'm right
[1:28:47] hallelujah and all Samson had to do
[1:28:51] hallelujah is stretch out his hands of
[1:28:54] surrender give me the dog give me where
[1:28:58] those poles are just stretch out
[1:29:01] surrender
[1:29:01] it says Oh Lord once more
[1:29:06] Lord Jesus what's more give me the space
[1:29:11] give me the power if I must die with my
[1:29:16] enemy so let it be Lord but never let me
[1:29:21] lose my purpose hallelujah let my
[1:29:25] promise be fulfilled even if it's me my
[1:29:29] death hallelujah hallelujah I wonder
[1:29:35] what the Philistines felt like when they
[1:29:37] began to see their own building began to
[1:29:40] rock and roll
[1:29:41] [Laughter]
[1:29:44] hey man shouts and brought idiot on him
[1:29:50] but it was the first time the blind man
[1:29:53] ever did see see because once you see
[1:29:58] your purpose Satan will never be able to
[1:30:02] put your eyes out again hallelujah you
[1:30:08] love the Lord this is our season a
[1:30:11] season of power and authority and what
[1:30:15] we need to do is yo Lord once more I
[1:30:19] don't know about you I'm always saying
[1:30:21] that I'm always crying out to God I need

[1:30:56] the other day and he told me he was a
[1:30:59] lady and her children going about their
[1:31:01] business on the highway and a man came

[1:31:08] was a good thing she was next to an exit
[1:31:10] she she felt it didn't kill her but it
[1:31:14] must have went through her neck I don't

[1:32:31] mean a thing I'm gonna stop here but I
[1:32:36] want you to realize by God's grace if we
[1:32:39] can't allow what what Satan did to us
[1:32:41] and some of us
[1:32:42] all but I don't know some of us went to
[1:32:45] war more than others
[1:32:46] but we can't allow Satan to do us what
[1:32:49] lucky did last year we've got to regroup
[1:32:53] the Bible says shake yourself from the
[1:32:55] dust tsiyon shake yourself
[1:32:57] that means resurrect come up from the
[1:32:59] dust realize who you are
[1:33:03] shake yourself don't let be able to demo
[1:33:09] just kick you around you know I said
[1:33:10] when when I was reading about how
[1:33:12] activity God you know you know how can't
[1:33:15] does you know do I don't know I haven't
[1:33:17] seen one in a long time but I've seen
[1:33:19] cash they're catching a mouse and won't
[1:33:22] even kill him right off they play with
[1:33:25] him throw him throw them up they play
[1:33:31] with him and then when they get tired of
[1:33:33] playing they go for the kill
[1:33:34] can you imagine the horror and the
[1:33:38] torment of that little mouse knowing
[1:33:40] that at some point in time the play will
[1:33:43] be over and that's what Satan does when
[1:33:46] he gets you out there he's playing with
[1:33:48] you he's got a time in a season he's
[1:33:52] coming for the kill
[1:33:56] hallelujah oh oh if you look at a cat
[1:33:59] and mouse when he the cats playing with
[1:34:01] the mouse it almost looked like they

[1:34:08] still live him right see that's what the
[1:34:12] Satan wants you to think you buddies he
[1:34:15] ain't joking he's come to kill you
[1:34:18] the Bible said he comes to kill steal
[1:34:19] and destroy but we're now in a season
[1:34:26] where he's afraid because we're coming
[1:34:30] closer to the coming of the law
[1:34:32] something is happening only inside of us
[1:34:35] something is awakening on the inside of
[1:34:38] us though we might be weak but something
[1:34:40] is wakening in it is that right we're
[1:34:42] beginning to see I'm Samson I'm Samson
[1:34:46] I'm the bride of cry hallelujah
[1:34:48] I came for a purpose and that purpose is
[1:34:51] to destroy the works of the devil
[1:34:53] hallelujah
[1:34:55] yes I've done wrong yes I've done evil
[1:34:58] yes I've actually but God have mercy on
[1:35:00] me once more time less tan hallelujah
[1:35:13] I'll be ministering on the other part of
[1:35:16] identity when I come back this evening
[1:35:18] because I want you to understand we must
[1:35:20] know who we are
[1:35:22] identity I was listening to probably God
[1:35:25] and I refer God there was a time in my
[1:35:27] life you did not need a Social Security
[1:35:29] card there was no such thing as a Social
[1:35:33] Security card and I remember when I was
[1:35:35] a teen somewhere up in there they
[1:35:37] started making us half Social Security
[1:35:39] card there was a time that you know
[1:35:42] there may be still living people who did
[1:35:44] not even have a birth certificate they
[1:35:49] were born and that's all they know
[1:35:50] whatever month they was that's all they
[1:35:52] know if they know that and then so now
[1:35:55] they began to register birth
[1:35:57] certificates you know and and there's a
[1:36:01] time that you you you you you you almost
[1:36:03] couldn't even get a bank account if you
[1:36:05] didn't have some identity of who you
[1:36:07] were oh god they didn't have pictures
[1:36:10] all they had was writings sometimes you
[1:36:16] had to get somebody who knew somebody to
[1:36:19] get you to help you get a bank account
[1:36:21] to say this is that person but now we
[1:36:23] got pictures we got cards we got birth
[1:36:27] certificates we got all these things
[1:36:29] that will identify us and now they're
[1:36:32] coming up with a new system you got to
[1:36:33] have a gold system as it go stuff I said
[1:36:39] it's the gold system a gold star to say
[1:36:43] that you really belong to the to this
[1:36:45] country the in order to get our driver's
[1:36:47] license or passport otherwise they're
[1:36:53] going to send you through all kind of
[1:36:54] stuff just to get out and get in but
[1:36:57] what is it doing what they're doing is
[1:36:59] now is narrowing everything down so you
[1:37:03] won't be difficult to find did you know
[1:37:06] that when you go into Walmart and you go
[1:37:08] to those
[1:37:09] Jeanne's we should call it self-serve
[1:37:13] you go to self-serve and you don't see
[1:37:15] the camera but every time you move the
[1:37:17] cameras click they got a picture of you
[1:37:22] better than than what you have of
[1:37:24] yourself at home really you can't get
[1:37:32] away right cuz they get in your face
[1:37:34] everything about you they have it right
[1:37:38] I saw it on the YouTube where they
[1:37:41] thought certain ones was stealing and
[1:37:42] instead of arresting him in the store
[1:37:44] they sent the police to their house see
[1:37:49] that's how tight the system and if that
[1:37:51] be the truth
[1:37:52] there's always unnatural that types out
[1:37:56] the spiritual God is he's taking every
[1:38:02] picture of you what you doing what
[1:38:06] you're thinking all those pictures are
[1:38:09] now coming to a place to identify you in
[1:38:12] identification brother branham said you
[1:38:16] won't once God has already stamped it
[1:38:19] and shut the door he said there's no way
[1:38:21] that you can change it once the door
[1:38:24] shut there's no way you can change it
[1:38:27] just still holy still righteous still
[1:38:29] filthy whatever you are is what you
[1:38:31] remain hmm
[1:38:34] have mercy on us and so I'm gonna I want
[1:38:37] to work with that this evening so you
[1:38:39] can understand brother Ellen said in a
[1:38:42] short term like this once the bride
[1:38:44] comes to know who she is she will become
[1:38:48] an invincible army and you and I must
[1:38:52] come to know the two spirits that lay
[1:38:56] within the framework of the church and
[1:39:00] and I work with those two things this
[1:39:04] evening but my point is this people I
[1:39:06] believe with all my heart
[1:39:07] we're here i-i-i believe that this
[1:39:10] church has a great purpose i really do i
[1:39:16] say like the prophet of god said there
[1:39:18] were millions of people who were being
[1:39:21] lost when god
[1:39:23] save him there were me as a people being
[1:39:28] lost when God said I saved you and God
[1:39:32] didn't save you to be another chair in
[1:39:36] the church you loved the Lord in moments
[1:39:45] like these I'll sing ah I'll sing out a
[1:39:53] love song to G in moment yes up I lift
[1:40:05] up my hallelujah I'll lift up my hands
[1:40:12] to sing oh my sing
[1:40:33] [Music]
[1:40:42] [Music]
[1:40:50] I see I see I lift up my hands just as I
[1:41:51] am please wait twirly but I blood wash
[1:42:09] it for me and thou bear'st me come to
[1:42:21] the lamb
[1:42:33] let's raise our hands - aah - aah - read
[1:42:47] my soul - whose blood can cleanse each
[1:43:02] spot Oh Lamb of God I come
[1:43:10] [Music]
[1:43:15] just to show you Satan tried to stop
[1:43:19] Moses Moses had been taught that he was
[1:43:24] to deliver up and Moses took it upon
[1:43:27] himself to deliver the children of
[1:43:30] Israel and he ended up killing a man and
[1:43:36] so he was exiled from Egypt it looked
[1:43:43] like God purpose has stopped and
[1:43:48] sometimes that's how it is God God will
[1:43:52] allow things that come in your life and
[1:43:53] it may look like you finished hallelujah
[1:43:58] and really it was the right season after
[1:44:04] 400 years but you see Moses messed the
[1:44:08] season up by getting into himself we
[1:44:13] mess it up when we think we can do it
[1:44:15] you can help God you can't help God so
[1:44:20] God had to take Moses out into the
[1:44:24] wilderness for 40 more years until the
[1:44:33] season would come around again Moses had
[1:44:37] to suffer hardships hard times he was a
[1:44:42] prince he didn't know what nothing about
[1:44:45] being a shepherd he learned what it was
[1:44:48] to get his hands dirty he learned what
[1:44:51] it meant to catch calluses on his hands
[1:44:53] he knew what it means now to smell Oh
[1:44:58] when he was in Egypt all he had to do is
[1:45:00] throw his hands out and they washed him
[1:45:02] and they dressed him and they did
[1:45:04] everything for him
[1:45:05] but now he's going through a hard time
[1:45:08] because you go through a hard time don't
[1:45:11] mean God has done God is a God of
[1:45:13] Resurrection hallelujah and when that
[1:45:17] season came back around Moses looked up
[1:45:21] and he saw a bush burning hallelujah
[1:45:27] God drew him back up as God says listen
[1:45:31] Moses now is your season and because of
[1:45:35] his failures Moses could not even see
[1:45:38] how God could use him he no longer spoke
[1:45:44] the proper Egyptian language he
[1:45:49] stuttered hallelujah how am I going to
[1:45:55] go back to Egypt nothing can defeat
[1:45:58] God's purpose Bride of Christ
[1:46:02] lay down your worries
[1:46:05] lay down your unbelief you couldn't save
[1:46:10] yourself if you tried it's all about
[1:46:13] Jesus Christ and if your name is in the
[1:46:16] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:46:19] foundation of the world
[1:46:20] nothing nothing absolutely nothing can
[1:46:23] defeat that purpose but it's up to you
[1:46:26] to find out who you are in the
[1:46:30] scriptures that's where it is your
[1:46:32] identity is in the word is that right
[1:46:35] and if that's the place where you'll
[1:46:37] find out who you are and once you come
[1:46:39] to see I'm bride don't look at the
[1:46:41] outward appearance don't even look at I
[1:46:43] want you to go deep down here into your
[1:46:46] heart and if you cannot see I'm a child
[1:46:50] of the devil then somewhere you must be
[1:46:53] a child of God if in your heart you love
[1:46:59] the righteous things of God even if you
[1:47:01] don't know how to perform it you are
[1:47:03] daughter of God there's nothing about a
[1:47:05] devil that want to do the things of God
