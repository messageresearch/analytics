[50:17] you can't carry your degrees

[50:23] you can't even carry your loved ones
[50:28] when each of us
[50:30] come to the end of our journey
[50:34] we come in naked
[50:37] but we leave out with character that's
[50:39] right
[50:41] and that is the character of the lord
[50:42] jesus christ
[50:44] without that character
[50:47] the gates won't open
[50:48] [Music]
[50:50] you love the lord
[50:54] thank god for our musicians amen those
[50:56] of us who are
[50:58] labored to come here this tonight
[51:08] appreciate everybody
[51:09] if you would turn with me
[51:11] to the scripture reading
[51:13] of saint john 15.
[51:20] saint john
[51:23] 15th chapter
[51:34] the 16th verse
[51:40] oftentimes we find
[51:43] christians saying that they found the
[51:45] lord
[51:47] what a false
[51:48] statement because god has never been
[51:51] lost amen
[51:53] and oftentimes
[51:55] you hear preachers say choose jesus
[51:59] but you can't choose jesus except jesus
[52:02] have chosen you amen
[52:05] even his disciples he told them i have
[52:09] chosen you twelve
[52:11] and one of you are and is a devil
[52:15] so we understand that
[52:17] it is god who
[52:19] does the choosing amen
[52:21] even though we witness and
[52:23] try to tell people about jesus christ
[52:27] if they have not been chosen they will
[52:29] never have an ear to hear amen
[52:32] st john 15 16 says
[52:36] ye have not chosen me
[52:40] but i have chosen you
[52:43] and ordained you that ye should go and
[52:47] bring forth fruit
[52:50] and that your fruit should remain
[52:53] that whatsoever you ask
[52:55] of the father in my name
[52:58] he may give it
[53:01] you
[53:02] amen what a mighty scripture
[53:05] let us pray
[53:07] heavenly father we come before you lord
[53:09] we thank you for your grace
[53:12] oh we thank you for your mercy thank you
[53:14] for those things that we do wrong daily
[53:17] lord
[53:18] thank you for the blood of jesus christ
[53:20] that
[53:20] covers us and cleanses us from all our
[53:23] unrighteousness
[53:25] what a mighty god you are lord
[53:28] truly you are the only living god amen
[53:32] we thank you lord jesus for your amazing
[53:34] grace
[53:36] for allowing us to see you and to know
[53:38] you yes
[53:40] when the world is in such darkness
[53:43] until you
[53:45] as being their savior
[53:47] is preposterous to them
[53:51] but you are to us
[53:54] our only hope
[53:56] we thank you father god
[53:58] for being who you are yes in jesus
[54:01] christ's name we pray
[54:03] amen amen
[54:04] amen
[54:06] pro
[54:07] i never could pronounce that word you
[54:09] may be seated
[54:10] don't even know why i tried it
[54:13] but the world think that serving the god
[54:15] serving the lord jesus christ is
[54:17] ridiculous
[54:19] uh they think that weak men
[54:23] serve the lord and
[54:26] most of the time they
[54:27] look at christians as being
[54:31] people who
[54:34] really has run out of choices
[54:36] in life and
[54:37] so they choose jesus because
[54:40] they have nothing else left to choose
[54:42] from
[54:45] what
[54:46] a deception
[54:51] is something about being a christian
[54:54] that we cannot deny
[54:57] and that is even when we were young
[55:00] and didn't know god
[55:02] there was always something in us amen
[55:05] that wanted us to know we wanted to know
[55:07] who he was
[55:09] and who he is and
[55:10] and and that that substance or that
[55:13] thing that i'm talking about is what we
[55:15] call representation hallelujah thank you
[55:19] lord
[55:20] amen and if there is a deep call there
[55:23] is one to respond amen
[55:27] i like to entitle my message tonight the
[55:30] realm
[55:32] that the believers live in
[55:37] and a realm is a field or domain
[55:42] of activities or interests
[55:47] and sometimes when you
[55:50] we make jokes out of it
[55:53] you might even see a person daydreaming
[55:55] and
[55:56] and you
[55:58] the comment or somebody might say man
[56:00] don't pay him no attention he's in a
[56:02] another realm
[56:04] or you might find someone that's totally
[56:07] uh just mad and upset at the world and
[56:10] there's no way that you can communicate
[56:12] with them and you'll hear that saying
[56:14] again man don't mess with him or her
[56:16] they're in another realm
[56:19] that means they're they're in a i look
[56:22] at it as being in another dimension
[56:25] a place where you're not there but
[56:27] they're there
[56:29] and to them it's just as real as this
[56:32] world
[56:34] we talk about illusions and things of
[56:36] that nature but when a person is in an
[56:39] illusion he or she doesn't know that
[56:42] they are in an illusion
[56:44] it's a real world
[56:46] and the things they're seeing you can't
[56:49] tell them they're not seeing it
[56:52] it's like when someone take acid
[56:54] or some strange drug that gives them
[56:57] hallucinations
[56:59] well you can't tell them that what
[57:01] they're looking at is not real
[57:03] amen it's a realm that we know nothing
[57:06] about those of us
[57:08] who who don't do drugs amen
[57:11] we don't know what that is but it's just
[57:13] as rare it praises fear and everything
[57:16] else
[57:17] and you can't tell them they're not
[57:19] seeing what they're seeing
[57:23] but it's so
[57:24] amazing
[57:26] this is not the kind of ram that the
[57:29] christian walk in
[57:31] this is not something that is uh
[57:34] uh imagined
[57:35] it's not imaginative or imaginary it's
[57:38] it's real
[57:40] it's something that is so real that we
[57:43] can call those things that be not as
[57:45] though they were hallelujah amen it's so
[57:48] real that abraham looked for a city
[57:51] whose builder and maker was god amen
[57:55] hallelujah
[57:57] it's so real
[57:58] until noah who had never seen a boat
[58:02] built an ark
[58:04] because what he was looking at
[58:06] was real he lived in a different realm
[58:10] and people in his day no doubt called
[58:12] him crazy you know something's wrong
[58:15] with that man in such a scientific age
[58:18] that we're living in this man is
[58:20] building a boat and what is that
[58:23] they had never seen one they had never
[58:25] rained before right but here was uh noah
[58:28] on the top of a mountain
[58:31] and they were visiting noah's place
[58:33] building the ark as though he was a zoo
[58:37] people coming from everywhere to see and
[58:41] mark this man but to see noah knew
[58:45] he had heard from god
[58:47] amen and by faith the bible tells us
[58:50] that noah built the narc amen and faith
[58:54] is not something that you presume
[58:57] it is reality amen faith makes things so
[59:01] real it is to you it's it's like you
[59:04] know your sight
[59:07] no one can tell you when you're looking
[59:08] at something you're not seeing it
[59:11] or when you feel something or when you
[59:13] smell something just like those senses
[59:15] the natural senses that we have there is
[59:18] a sixth sense
[59:20] that we call faith and that sixth sense
[59:23] moves and opens the door
[59:25] to a different realm amen
[59:28] yes sir
[59:29] amen how many of us who you believe and
[59:32] how many of us really believe that that
[59:34] we can move mountains
[59:36] jesus said it yes sir if you have the
[59:39] faith
[59:40] of a mustard seed you can say and speak
[59:43] to a mountain be mountain be that move
[59:45] and that mountain must obey you
[59:49] but you see it's not something you can
[59:51] do it's it's it's the god that operates
[59:54] in you hallelujah this is where many
[59:57] people fail christians who are justified
[1:00:02] they're sanctified
[1:00:03] but they don't have the power of god on
[1:00:05] the inside
[1:00:07] now and what god is trying to get the
[1:00:09] true christian to to to
[1:00:12] the place that he's trying to bring them
[1:00:14] to in this day is a perfect faith amen
[1:00:18] and the only way you can have perfect
[1:00:19] faith is when the perfect god
[1:00:22] is living in you amen amen i love the
[1:00:25] scripture where it says you have not
[1:00:27] chosen me
[1:00:29] and i'm so glad amen he said but i have
[1:00:32] chosen you
[1:00:34] and that makes me very happy
[1:00:36] very glad right
[1:00:38] and i have ordained you and you know
[1:00:42] what one thing about god he does he
[1:00:44] cannot make a mistake
[1:00:47] once god does something it's eternal
[1:00:51] everlasting
[1:00:53] but this realm is not something that you
[1:00:55] just
[1:00:57] walk into
[1:01:00] it is something that you must press into
[1:01:04] it is something that's real
[1:01:06] i mean even scientists know that there
[1:01:09] there are other dimensions
[1:01:12] and we know dimensions are real for the
[1:01:14] very fact that we can't see radio waves
[1:01:17] but they're there right
[1:01:19] we can't see colors flowing through this
[1:01:21] room but they are yeah
[1:01:24] we have instruments like televisions and
[1:01:27] iphones and ipads and all kinds of
[1:01:30] technology now that can tap into those
[1:01:33] rams and bring them here
[1:01:35] we know that uh by god's grace that uh
[1:01:38] uh
[1:01:39] i cannot say it there's there's uh
[1:01:43] uh
[1:01:44] scientists know amen that that when it
[1:01:46] comes to time travel we basically do it
[1:01:49] every day but we stand in one place and
[1:01:51] travel to europe by looking at what
[1:01:53] europe is doing tomorrow and we see
[1:01:55] europe yesterday and and they see you
[1:01:58] and you understand me it's it's so real
[1:02:00] and they're trying to find
[1:02:02] a way how a way to translate us
[1:02:06] to to move us physically into those
[1:02:09] places
[1:02:10] because they know it exists i mean
[1:02:13] scientists know
[1:02:14] but they just don't know how to do it
[1:02:17] and i'm gonna tell you like this you
[1:02:19] take enoch he was the first one that i
[1:02:21] know of according to the bible that was
[1:02:23] translated that's right amen
[1:02:25] so we know that there are dimensions
[1:02:27] that you can move uh uh from one to the
[1:02:30] next amen and you you go to the amount
[1:02:34] of transfiguration you saw moses elijah
[1:02:37] and jesus
[1:02:38] amen and they were all in their
[1:02:40] glorified body proving that there are
[1:02:43] there's another dimension yes sir amen
[1:02:46] that we can go into and live yes amen
[1:02:49] when the witch of endor called up samuel
[1:02:52] amen hallelujah
[1:02:54] it's a real dimension outside of this
[1:02:57] and jesus called it another world
[1:03:00] he said i'm not from this world
[1:03:03] i'm from another world amen hallelujah
[1:03:06] and what we need to know is that other
[1:03:09] that that world exists amen when people
[1:03:12] talk about oh i saw an angel understand
[1:03:15] that angel came from another dimension
[1:03:18] it came from another realm hallelujah
[1:03:20] amen amen
[1:03:22] and what we fail to see
[1:03:25] is that when we really get down to
[1:03:27] prayer or to pray
[1:03:29] we travel
[1:03:31] we call it travail
[1:03:34] when you literally get down and you
[1:03:36] begin to move into a realm you feel it
[1:03:39] but you don't understand it
[1:03:41] and all of a sudden your words are uh uh
[1:03:44] is no longer uh spoken by you but is
[1:03:48] taken over by the holy spirit
[1:03:50] and the holy spirit began to pray and
[1:03:53] the whole time you're enjoying it amen
[1:03:56] and he searches your heart he pulls
[1:03:58] things out of your heart he speaks those
[1:04:00] things and sometimes you get so lost in
[1:04:04] that atmosphere or that ram
[1:04:07] till hours pass
[1:04:10] you don't even know it seems like 10
[1:04:12] minutes that you you on your knees and
[1:04:15] and you get up off your knees and maybe
[1:04:16] you've been there for an hour or two
[1:04:18] hours
[1:04:21] and somehow you travel
[1:04:24] people don't believe that
[1:04:26] but the truth of the matter is that even
[1:04:29] when you're sleeping
[1:04:31] you travel
[1:04:33] your spirit leaves
[1:04:35] and it's
[1:04:37] search the scriptures the bible talks
[1:04:39] about your dreams being ordered by god
[1:04:43] sometimes we come to a place in our
[1:04:44] lives that we've been to in our dreams
[1:04:48] and we call them deja vu
[1:04:51] i've been here before
[1:04:52] this seems familiar
[1:04:54] only because god has ordered you there i
[1:04:57] love deja vus
[1:04:58] because whenever i have a deja vu i'm
[1:05:01] like yes sir i'm on the right track
[1:05:04] amen
[1:05:05] so but let's get back to the praying
[1:05:08] because if you look in the scriptures
[1:05:10] there were always people praying god's
[1:05:12] people pray
[1:05:14] amen whenever you really want something
[1:05:16] from god you got to get down to business
[1:05:19] and you got to pass beyond this this
[1:05:21] veil of flesh
[1:05:24] right because this veil of flesh keeps
[1:05:26] holding you amen but when you when you
[1:05:28] begin to pray and all of a sudden you
[1:05:30] get into the spirit realm amen you're in
[1:05:33] a different realm you're in a different
[1:05:34] dimension and and and time will be no
[1:05:37] more for you amen
[1:05:40] you and i remember the time that hannah
[1:05:42] wanted a child
[1:05:45] and hannah was a wonderful woman
[1:05:48] in the old testament and she was barren
[1:05:51] and i i i
[1:05:54] kevin has his name
[1:05:57] i can't pronounce her husband couldn't
[1:05:59] give give her a baby
[1:06:03] at the time
[1:06:05] but she began to pray
[1:06:08] and she prayed and she prayed and she we
[1:06:11] wept and she wept and she entered in
[1:06:13] such a dimension amen that when she went
[1:06:16] to visit he lied
[1:06:19] he thought she was drunk amen
[1:06:22] or when elijah saw her in the temple in
[1:06:24] in in in the in the place where god
[1:06:26] would be he thought he thought she was
[1:06:28] drunk
[1:06:30] and she says no my lord i'm not not like
[1:06:32] a woman of belial i'm not i'm not of
[1:06:35] that kind of a people but i need a child
[1:06:37] i want a child and i've been praying
[1:06:39] that god would give me a son
[1:06:43] and god touchy life
[1:06:47] and gave hannah
[1:06:49] samuel
[1:06:53] you see sometimes we want god to give us
[1:06:55] but we don't want to pay the price to
[1:06:57] get it
[1:06:59] we have to do something sometimes amen
[1:07:02] and those things are simple get down to
[1:07:05] pray amen
[1:07:08] faith
[1:07:09] and prayer
[1:07:11] works together amen
[1:07:15] listen when hannah hannah when she was
[1:07:18] at the temple and she was praying eli
[1:07:21] came in and thought she was drunk
[1:07:24] and he said i uh she said i am not drunk
[1:07:27] but i am praying that god would take
[1:07:29] away my reproach you see in that day not
[1:07:33] to have a baby was a reproach
[1:07:36] nowadays to have a baby is a reproach
[1:07:39] and he said the lord granted unto thee
[1:07:42] thy request amen now listen to this
[1:07:45] people and you know it's true
[1:07:47] god could have spoke that word
[1:07:50] and he could have placed that baby in
[1:07:53] hannah's
[1:07:54] arms
[1:07:56] but you know as a real woman
[1:07:58] i'm sure hannah wanted the experience
[1:08:02] of what it would feel like to be
[1:08:05] carrying a baby
[1:08:08] and god knew those things amen now god
[1:08:11] could have placed little salmon right in
[1:08:12] hannah's arms
[1:08:14] all of us know that he's a creator of
[1:08:16] all things
[1:08:18] just speak to it into existence
[1:08:21] he could have put it right in hand his
[1:08:23] arm people said no he couldn't yes he
[1:08:26] could
[1:08:27] jesus christ was the fullness of the
[1:08:29] godhead bodily he turned water into wine
[1:08:33] amen at the request of his mother right
[1:08:36] he turned bread and it multiplied bread
[1:08:39] and
[1:08:40] you know fish
[1:08:42] and was cooked bread and cooked fish
[1:08:44] sometimes you know that was the best
[1:08:46] fish
[1:08:47] fish and bread ever
[1:08:51] y'all know it was right
[1:08:53] nevertheless
[1:08:55] amen he's the creator
[1:08:58] and he could have done it any kind of
[1:08:59] way he wanted to
[1:09:02] but
[1:09:05] instead of doing that
[1:09:07] it was the regular procedure of nine
[1:09:09] months before the little baby come along
[1:09:12] he could have done it instantly
[1:09:14] but he didn't do it instantly
[1:09:16] he just give her the promise
[1:09:18] and she inherited the promise isn't that
[1:09:21] right
[1:09:22] you say old brother books let me say it
[1:09:23] like this so you better understand me
[1:09:25] god could instantly make us perfect sure
[1:09:28] amen
[1:09:29] he can instantly take away all your
[1:09:32] thoughts
[1:09:33] he could instantly take away all
[1:09:35] everything that that smears your
[1:09:38] testimony he can instantly take it away
[1:09:41] but if he would
[1:09:43] you would have no testimony
[1:09:47] see you and i must understand that god
[1:09:50] loves what he's doing amen this whole
[1:09:52] creation
[1:09:54] was created for his own good pleasure
[1:09:56] amen hallelujah and when you fall he
[1:09:59] enjoyed picking you up picking you up
[1:10:02] when you get sick he enjoys healing you
[1:10:04] amen when you have impossible tasks he
[1:10:08] makes those things impo possible y'all
[1:10:11] he makes them possible he takes the
[1:10:13] impossible and makes them possible why
[1:10:15] he takes pleasure in those things amen
[1:10:18] thank you lord as our brother
[1:10:21] isaac was saying sometimes we get so
[1:10:23] involved if we just step back
[1:10:26] and look at the whole picture we'll see
[1:10:28] what god is doing that's right amen god
[1:10:31] only meets the worshipper
[1:10:33] through the blood
[1:10:35] and under the blood
[1:10:38] you know you know
[1:10:41] god doesn't meet a man on this church
[1:10:43] banner
[1:10:44] god could care less whether you baptist
[1:10:46] methodist presbyterian catholic message
[1:10:48] whatever you want to call yourself
[1:10:50] that's that's not why god meets you
[1:10:53] god meets you under the blood of jesus
[1:10:54] christ
[1:10:56] that's the only provided place of
[1:10:57] worship
[1:10:58] the church you go to can't save you
[1:11:01] i don't care if it's a mega church i
[1:11:02] don't care if your preacher got three
[1:11:04] degrees you know doctors of divinities
[1:11:06] and dddlds
[1:11:08] that
[1:11:09] he can't save you
[1:11:11] the only person who can save you is
[1:11:13] jesus christ
[1:11:15] and you need to know jesus christ
[1:11:18] amen right and the only way you can know
[1:11:21] him is to what except the blood of jesus
[1:11:24] christ amen and a lot of times people
[1:11:27] think the blood of jesus christ is like
[1:11:29] having nails that that nailed him to the
[1:11:32] cross and you know he only had two hands
[1:11:35] and i forgot how many nails they got now
[1:11:37] 17
[1:11:39] they're supposed to be the original
[1:11:41] nails that nailed them to the cross come
[1:11:43] on somebody
[1:11:45] you see what i'm saying amen even if
[1:11:47] jesus there's nothing he can do for you
[1:11:50] now because he's already done it amen
[1:11:53] he's already shedding his blood for you
[1:11:55] amen the atonement has already been made
[1:11:58] amen hallelujah if you're healing
[1:12:01] he's already healed you amen 2 000 years
[1:12:04] ago and therefore the only way you can
[1:12:07] get healed is to accept your healing
[1:12:09] amen
[1:12:11] god's only meets the worshiper through
[1:12:12] the blood and under the blood now i'm
[1:12:15] talking faith here
[1:12:17] amen
[1:12:18] amen you understand me because a lot of
[1:12:21] times we think well i got it
[1:12:23] just like the prophet god said even the
[1:12:26] disciples didn't have perfect faith
[1:12:28] they didn't
[1:12:30] at first they did not have
[1:12:32] and jesus sent them out to heal
[1:12:35] to cast out devils amen
[1:12:38] he did it
[1:12:39] and guess what the devil defeated them
[1:12:43] they came back with details talked
[1:12:46] and they said lord why how come we
[1:12:49] couldn't cast this demon out
[1:12:51] and jesus said first of all you got a
[1:12:53] little faith
[1:12:55] secondly these these come out by what
[1:12:58] fasting and praying you got to be more
[1:13:00] sincere
[1:13:02] about what you're doing for me
[1:13:06] and a lot of times people want all of
[1:13:08] these uh miracles and things that happen
[1:13:11] but it comes by way of your sincerity
[1:13:14] and most of all they come by way of
[1:13:16] prayer and fasting amen you got to kill
[1:13:18] your old man
[1:13:20] move you out of the way
[1:13:22] so that you can hear from god
[1:13:25] israel had no no place to meet god
[1:13:28] god has got one place today he meets the
[1:13:31] worshiper she see neither the methodist
[1:13:33] baptist or pentecostal he meets them
[1:13:36] under the blood
[1:13:37] that's the only provided place god has
[1:13:40] not in an organization not in a union
[1:13:44] but the blood is where jesus christ
[1:13:46] meets his worshiper when i see the blood
[1:13:49] see that's god provided way when i see
[1:13:52] the blood i'll pass over you say well
[1:13:54] where's the blood
[1:13:55] the blood is the holy spirit
[1:13:58] amen hallelujah the blessing is not the
[1:14:02] chemistry
[1:14:03] you can go and pick up some blood the
[1:14:05] chemistry perhaps offer the ark of the
[1:14:07] covenant or something out there but
[1:14:09] that's not where the power it was the
[1:14:12] life that was in the blood amen amen
[1:14:14] this is my beloved son in whom i'm well
[1:14:17] pleased to dwell in that was a father
[1:14:20] dwelling in that tabernacle called jesus
[1:14:23] amen
[1:14:25] amen
[1:14:26] and that life
[1:14:28] will never lose its power amen because
[1:14:31] that life is god that's right it's true
[1:14:34] it was god's purpose to bring forth a
[1:14:36] people
[1:14:38] like unto himself
[1:14:39] and adam failed us we know adam failed
[1:14:42] adam and eve failed us
[1:14:45] the purpose for adam and eve was to
[1:14:47] bring forth
[1:14:48] people that would be in the image and
[1:14:51] likeness of god amen
[1:14:53] they failed us
[1:14:55] by what
[1:14:56] by sinning
[1:14:58] right
[1:14:59] but it's still god purpose because his
[1:15:01] purpose can't come back void y'all
[1:15:03] understand me
[1:15:04] if his word fails now we might fail
[1:15:08] but his word can never fail
[1:15:10] so god has to had to make a way for this
[1:15:14] purpose to be fulfilled if the first
[1:15:17] adam fell that means the second adam who
[1:15:19] was jesus christ could not fail
[1:15:22] amen that's why he was without sin
[1:15:25] and understand people of god there's
[1:15:27] only one person who was without sin
[1:15:30] and that was jesus christ amen amen
[1:15:33] even james said if you say you have not
[1:15:35] sinned he said you make him a you know
[1:15:37] you're a liar
[1:15:40] right and sin is unbelief
[1:15:43] even as christians we
[1:15:45] sometimes fall into that slot of
[1:15:47] unbelief and that's where the word of
[1:15:49] god said grieve not the holy spirit
[1:15:52] whereby you were what sealed unto the
[1:15:55] day of your redemption amen
[1:15:57] see
[1:15:58] so it was god's purpose to bring forth
[1:16:00] the people like unto himself that would
[1:16:02] be a word bride because we know that's
[1:16:04] where she fell she was chosen before the
[1:16:07] foundation of the world in him now i'm
[1:16:09] saying things and we have heard these
[1:16:11] things over and over and over and over
[1:16:14] and over and i can continue saying over
[1:16:16] and over because that's everlasting over
[1:16:21] but until we believe it
[1:16:23] not in our heads
[1:16:25] in our hearts
[1:16:28] it must be there in the temple it must
[1:16:32] be the see one thing about the holy
[1:16:34] ghost he'll never doubt his word amen
[1:16:38] amen he'll never
[1:16:40] he'll never fail in reasonable way he
[1:16:43] cannot amen
[1:16:45] because the word we speak
[1:16:48] are the words that he wrote
[1:16:50] or had written amen
[1:16:54] so she was chosen before the foundation
[1:16:57] of the world in him she was foreknown
[1:17:00] beloved before she was ever brought
[1:17:02] forth during the ages upon the earth
[1:17:06] she was redeemed by his blood and can
[1:17:10] never come into condemnation
[1:17:13] amen amen
[1:17:16] somebody help me here so why do we allow
[1:17:19] satan can to condemn us if you declare
[1:17:22] you got the holy ghost but yet you allow
[1:17:25] satan to condemn you why
[1:17:28] you can't in the eyes of god you cannot
[1:17:30] be condemned
[1:17:32] because the blood of jesus christ has
[1:17:34] covered you
[1:17:36] the bible said once and for all he
[1:17:38] shattered his blood god don't every time
[1:17:41] you make us in let me go put some blood
[1:17:42] there no sure
[1:17:44] you have the spirit of the blood which
[1:17:46] is the holy spirit in you amen and so
[1:17:49] when god sees you he doesn't see you
[1:17:53] he doesn't see your failures amen he
[1:17:56] said when i see the blood i'll pass over
[1:17:58] you amen you understand me he sees the
[1:18:00] life of the blood
[1:18:02] not only just in you but over you amen
[1:18:05] and he passes you by but it's the devil
[1:18:08] that keeps us in this rut
[1:18:11] he keeps us in this rut making us always
[1:18:13] feel condemned and we're not worthy
[1:18:15] you're right we're not worthy but thank
[1:18:17] god for his grace that makes us worthy
[1:18:20] amen
[1:18:23] amen see this is the realm we must lived
[1:18:25] in the bible says there is now no
[1:18:28] condemnation to those who walk not after
[1:18:31] the flesh but after the spirit amen
[1:18:34] no condemnation so why do we allow satan
[1:18:38] to constantly condemn us and the whole
[1:18:40] time he's doing that you believing his
[1:18:43] lie it puts you in a place of fear
[1:18:46] amen am i going to make it amen am i
[1:18:49] going to make the rapture
[1:18:51] am i really saved
[1:18:53] you see it's because you're doubting
[1:18:54] what god has already said about you
[1:18:58] she has foreign known and beloved before
[1:19:00] she was ever brought forth during the
[1:19:02] ages of upon the earth she was redeemed
[1:19:04] by his blood and can never come into
[1:19:06] condemnation she can never be in the
[1:19:08] judgment because sin cannot be imputed
[1:19:11] unto her
[1:19:12] you know what that means
[1:19:14] sin cannot be charged
[1:19:16] it can't be charged you say what you
[1:19:19] mean this is where the bible says we are
[1:19:22] accepted in the beloved amen no no no
[1:19:27] it's not our righteousness
[1:19:29] it's not our righteousness people it's
[1:19:32] because we are in him and therefore
[1:19:34] being in him we are accepted
[1:19:38] yeah
[1:19:39] he was the only one that was accepted he
[1:19:41] was the only one that could take the
[1:19:43] book out of the right hand of him who
[1:19:45] sat on the throne he was the only one
[1:19:46] that could loose the seals thereof he
[1:19:49] was the only one that bloody lamb
[1:19:51] that jesus christ
[1:19:53] hallelujah who's the same yesterday
[1:19:55] today and forever
[1:19:57] that's right romans 4 and he says
[1:19:59] blessed is the man
[1:20:01] i say that again romans 4 8 blessed is
[1:20:04] the man to whom the lord will not impute
[1:20:07] sin amen
[1:20:08] what man
[1:20:10] you man
[1:20:13] hallelujah
[1:20:15] blessed is the lord blessed is the man
[1:20:17] whom the lord will not impute sin but
[1:20:20] indeed she shall be with him in his
[1:20:24] throne of judgment
[1:20:25] judging the world even angels is that
[1:20:28] right paul says listen to courtney
[1:20:30] corinthians don't you know you're going
[1:20:32] to be judged you're going to be the
[1:20:34] judges
[1:20:35] and if you don't know how to handle the
[1:20:38] situations in the church how in the
[1:20:39] world are you going to be a judge amen
[1:20:42] everything is a training place
[1:20:44] this is your training station
[1:20:46] god is preparing us for another kingdom
[1:20:49] amen hallelujah and you've heard me say
[1:20:52] it so many times
[1:20:55] when you were in your mother's womb
[1:20:57] you had hands
[1:20:59] you had feet
[1:21:00] you had a mouth
[1:21:02] you had eyes
[1:21:03] and none of those things were created
[1:21:05] for the womb
[1:21:07] it was created in the womb that's right
[1:21:09] but at the time of that it was created
[1:21:11] you know in the womb
[1:21:13] but it was created for the world to come
[1:21:15] amen you understand me because while you
[1:21:18] were in the womb your mama fed you she
[1:21:20] saw for you
[1:21:22] she felt for you she did everything for
[1:21:24] you but when you was born again you were
[1:21:28] birthed into this dimension this realm
[1:21:31] and anybody knows everybody knows i
[1:21:33] would never want to go back there
[1:21:36] amen right amen we can't even listen we
[1:21:39] can't even describe amen what this world
[1:21:43] is compared to the mother's womb amen
[1:21:47] huh that's the way heaven is like amen
[1:21:50] once we have birthed out of this realm
[1:21:52] into the realm to come we'll never be
[1:21:54] able to compare
[1:21:56] that's what the word of god says amen
[1:21:59] amen you can't even compare
[1:22:01] the sufferings of this world
[1:22:04] to the things in which god has prepared
[1:22:06] for you you can't
[1:22:13] i believe this is the day of promise
[1:22:16] i believe this is the day of the rapture
[1:22:18] i believe because the rapture is not
[1:22:20] instantaneous
[1:22:21] the rapture is a
[1:22:22] process hallelujah
[1:22:25] matthew 25 shows us that there were ten
[1:22:28] virgins sleeping
[1:22:30] five were wise fire was foolish
[1:22:33] they heard a cry
[1:22:36] right
[1:22:37] and they all went out to meet him
[1:22:39] five had oil and extra oil five had all
[1:22:42] and they all that one five went all went
[1:22:45] out
[1:22:46] but they were in a journey
[1:22:50] and those that were wise the bible
[1:22:52] doesn't even tell you the revelation
[1:22:54] don't even tell you the day they went
[1:22:55] into the door
[1:22:58] but we do know
[1:23:00] that when the foolish virgins came the
[1:23:02] door was shut
[1:23:04] it is a process
[1:23:07] it has always been a process
[1:23:09] the problem says well what do you mean
[1:23:11] let me tell you enoch walked with god if
[1:23:14] it wasn't a process the bible would have
[1:23:16] said enoch stood there
[1:23:20] and was translated but walking is a
[1:23:23] process
[1:23:24] you're leaving point a and you're moving
[1:23:26] to point b from point b to point c
[1:23:29] whatever but you're moving
[1:23:33] that's why the bible said you know uh
[1:23:35] according to thessalonians
[1:23:38] there was a trumpet
[1:23:40] there was a voice
[1:23:41] there was a shout
[1:23:43] ah they're not all the same
[1:23:46] it was a process
[1:23:48] being given to us in the last days
[1:23:55] if it wasn't a process
[1:23:57] in the book of revelation it would not
[1:23:59] have said
[1:24:00] the bride has made herself ready
[1:24:03] amen
[1:24:06] let me ask you a question
[1:24:10] if god would say
[1:24:12] seven days from now
[1:24:14] the rapture gonna take place
[1:24:16] most of us would go insane
[1:24:20] you know why
[1:24:21] because we would not be able to do
[1:24:23] what's necessary to do
[1:24:25] in seven days
[1:24:27] amen
[1:24:28] amen how long has taken us to move from
[1:24:30] point a to point b
[1:24:34] we be fasting praying crying we'll be
[1:24:37] doing all kinds of things trying to live
[1:24:39] right
[1:24:42] you'll lose your mind
[1:24:44] if he literally told you a day
[1:24:48] yeah that's true
[1:24:50] that's true
[1:24:52] that's why it's by grace yes
[1:24:56] that's why it's by his mercy
[1:25:00] that's because he chose you and you
[1:25:02] didn't choose him amen
[1:25:05] it'll never be because of your abilities
[1:25:10] you understand me in every lick of
[1:25:13] character that you gain on this side you
[1:25:16] gain it by his grace
[1:25:18] show me somebody in the bible
[1:25:21] who who won a war
[1:25:24] against the enemy without the grace and
[1:25:26] help of god
[1:25:28] is not in there
[1:25:31] you say well oh david let me tell you
[1:25:32] something david was anointed
[1:25:36] that it was
[1:25:37] it wasn't david it was the anointing
[1:25:39] that was using david
[1:25:42] you say well oh joshua said son stand
[1:25:45] still it wasn't joshua it was the
[1:25:47] anointing the christ amen
[1:25:51] that had him speak those words
[1:25:55] oh you said but moses opened up the red
[1:25:57] sea no he didn't
[1:25:59] moses was there when god opened the red
[1:26:02] sea that's right amen
[1:26:04] no man could have done that amen
[1:26:09] every victory came by the grace of god
[1:26:12] listen at the end of the day that's why
[1:26:15] those 12 24 elders
[1:26:17] when they saw jesus when they saw the
[1:26:20] lamb they all threw their crowns down
[1:26:23] amen and fell on the floor amen because
[1:26:26] they realized that every victim they
[1:26:28] gained was by the lamb of god amen the
[1:26:32] blood of jesus the power of god that's
[1:26:35] the only way you're going to make heaven
[1:26:36] amen it'll never be because you was fake
[1:26:38] for the church and you came to church
[1:26:40] every sunday amen because i'm going to
[1:26:42] tell you something then
[1:26:43] not let me go there but the point is
[1:26:47] your righteousness to god is like filthy
[1:26:50] rags
[1:26:51] amen
[1:26:52] amen
[1:26:53] i don't help i can't help but to get
[1:26:55] excited
[1:26:57] why are we so afraid
[1:27:02] mark 4 40 says and he said unto them why
[1:27:05] are you so fearful
[1:27:08] how is it that you have no faith
[1:27:10] now he's talking to his disciples you
[1:27:12] want to turn there if you like
[1:27:14] mark 4
[1:27:16] 40. why are you so fearful
[1:27:20] hear his disciples right
[1:27:22] have seen him do so many things
[1:27:26] and yet they were fearful
[1:27:28] you and i have seen god do so many
[1:27:30] things
[1:27:32] and the devil is a boo
[1:27:34] and we get so scared
[1:27:39] it's the truth
[1:27:41] why are we so
[1:27:44] fearful listen what it says
[1:27:50] 36 first and when they had sent away the
[1:27:53] multitude they took him even as he was
[1:27:55] in the ship and there were there were
[1:27:57] also with him other little ships and
[1:28:00] there rose a great storm of wind and
[1:28:02] that wave beat unto the ship so that it
[1:28:04] was now full
[1:28:06] and he was in the hindu part of the
[1:28:08] ship's feet on a pillow and they awaken
[1:28:11] him awake him and say unto him master
[1:28:15] careth thou not that we perish i love
[1:28:17] that
[1:28:19] i so love that
[1:28:21] because christians as christians we go
[1:28:23] there yes we do amen we go there too
[1:28:26] often
[1:28:28] when things seem to overflow us over
[1:28:31] flood and you say oh what are you saying
[1:28:33] listen the bible says when the enemy
[1:28:35] comes in like a flood he'll lift up a
[1:28:38] standard but oftentimes we don't look we
[1:28:40] don't wait for the
[1:28:41] all right amen we look at the flood says
[1:28:44] carried out not that we perish i can't
[1:28:46] pay my rent i can't do this i can't do
[1:28:49] that where are you
[1:28:52] y'all we do it
[1:28:58] amen as human beings oh yeah yeah i just
[1:29:01] i think about god i said that's why i
[1:29:03] love him he's got so much patience
[1:29:06] he's got so much patience so much long
[1:29:08] suffering so much love
[1:29:11] and all we need to do is have faith in
[1:29:13] god
[1:29:14] and when you have faith in god you have
[1:29:17] something just like this and nobody out
[1:29:19] here in the audience cannot tell me i'm
[1:29:21] not holding a bottle of water it is
[1:29:24] declaring itself i feel it i see it and
[1:29:26] if i could smell it i would smell it but
[1:29:28] my point is i know all of my senses are
[1:29:31] declaring this apology and it is real
[1:29:33] amen that's what faith does amen when
[1:29:36] you desire something from the from the
[1:29:38] lord and you believe god nobody can tell
[1:29:42] you that you're not holding that bottle
[1:29:44] of faith in your arm in your hand
[1:29:46] whatever you ask for amen whatsoever you
[1:29:48] ask in my name believing that you shall
[1:29:50] receive it it's yours
[1:29:55] that's the realm god wants us to walk
[1:29:57] amen
[1:29:58] every day i got to get this cataract
[1:30:00] moved from my eye but don't you think
[1:30:02] i've given up on faith don't you think
[1:30:05] i've given up on god amen i remember
[1:30:07] when the prophet of god's wife had that
[1:30:09] tumor it was just right at the time he's
[1:30:11] in the slicer the thing disappeared i'm
[1:30:13] still looking for my miracle amen
[1:30:16] hallelujah i'm still looking for my
[1:30:18] miracle i i've seen him do too many if
[1:30:21] god can heal me for cancer you think god
[1:30:22] can't heal this
[1:30:30] no
[1:30:31] they say i can give you another lens i
[1:30:33] want my lens
[1:30:35] give me what god gave me keep me i mean
[1:30:38] you know i you know that's just the way
[1:30:40] i see it
[1:30:42] i'm believing it
[1:30:43] people say you crazy maybe i am
[1:30:46] but i still believe god is god amen
[1:30:50] amen amen
[1:30:56] oh ye of little faith right
[1:30:59] cares that not we perish and he rose and
[1:31:01] rebuked the wind and said unto the sea
[1:31:03] peace be still and the wind and sea and
[1:31:06] ceased and there was a great calm
[1:31:10] and he said unto them why are ye so
[1:31:12] fearful how is it
[1:31:14] that you have no faith
[1:31:18] and they feared
[1:31:21] exceedingly and said to one to another
[1:31:24] see this is where they their revelation
[1:31:26] why they could had so much fear
[1:31:28] though he had done so many things they
[1:31:30] didn't see god and the man they saw man
[1:31:34] that's why they say what manner of man
[1:31:39] is this
[1:31:40] that even the wind and the sea obey him
[1:31:44] they didn't see god
[1:31:46] they saw a man
[1:31:48] but if they had seen god they never
[1:31:51] would have feared
[1:31:53] amen
[1:31:54] amen
[1:31:56] even when their own confession
[1:31:58] their own confession tells us what they
[1:32:01] saw in the boat
[1:32:06] amen
[1:32:08] what man of man is this
[1:32:10] but he commanded even the wind in the
[1:32:12] water and they obey him
[1:32:15] see the bible tells us the first john 4
[1:32:18] 18 there is no fear in love
[1:32:21] but perfect love casts out fear because
[1:32:24] fear hath torment he that feareth is not
[1:32:27] made perfect in love and that's our
[1:32:29] problem
[1:32:31] perfect faith and perfect love are twins
[1:32:36] amen
[1:32:37] perfect faith you say what do you mean
[1:32:41] after your faith virtue
[1:32:43] amen knowledge
[1:32:45] temperance right patient godliness
[1:32:47] brotherly kindness amen in the holy
[1:32:49] spirit so when you add up you're
[1:32:52] literally growing up into perfect faith
[1:32:55] this is the process of the rapture
[1:32:57] that's right amen i believe it amen
[1:33:01] jesus had perfect faith
[1:33:04] he had it
[1:33:05] and it come
[1:33:06] because he was the word
[1:33:09] and you become the word
[1:33:11] you become the word as you receive the
[1:33:13] word
[1:33:14] if you abide in me and my word of god
[1:33:17] and you y'all understand what i'm saying
[1:33:18] when you receive the word you believe
[1:33:21] the world and because you believe the
[1:33:23] world you become the word amen and
[1:33:25] whatever that word is saying you stand
[1:33:27] there yes amen
[1:33:29] you stand amen you don't bow
[1:33:32] a friend of mine sent me a little
[1:33:34] capture of i don't know whether it was a
[1:33:36] movie i guess it was a movie but they
[1:33:38] were showing how the early christians
[1:33:40] were
[1:33:41] being persecuted one burned to the state
[1:33:43] and the other one you know the others
[1:33:45] ran to the lions for the lions to eat
[1:33:48] them and i it just brought me to tears
[1:33:52] because those were real christians
[1:33:55] you understand me
[1:33:57] and i'm gonna tell you this
[1:33:59] whether you look at it or not as being
[1:34:01] this way
[1:34:04] wasn't human effort no
[1:34:07] they were anointed
[1:34:08] amen
[1:34:10] that was the ox age
[1:34:12] that's right the age of sacrifice
[1:34:15] they could never have done it listen
[1:34:18] everybody that recanted were those who
[1:34:21] were not anointed for that age that's
[1:34:23] right
[1:34:26] and don't you know the squeeze and
[1:34:27] persecution that we're getting ready to
[1:34:29] face it's going to take an anointing of
[1:34:32] god for us to get through it amen that's
[1:34:35] the truth amen amen fear not little
[1:34:37] flock amen
[1:34:39] it is the father's pleasure
[1:34:42] to give you the kingdom amen and he
[1:34:44] ain't talking about heaven he taught him
[1:34:46] the kingdom himself god amen is that
[1:34:49] right
[1:34:50] the kingdom
[1:34:52] the holy spirit the fullness of the
[1:34:54] statue of christ
[1:34:55] it's his good pleasure to give you the
[1:34:57] kingdom
[1:34:59] hallelujah
[1:35:00] glory to god i hope you're enjoying this
[1:35:03] yeah i am
[1:35:05] i really believe you and you become the
[1:35:07] word and you become the word that's the
[1:35:08] you receive the word and if you abide in
[1:35:10] me and my word about in you
[1:35:12] hallelujah then ask what you will and it
[1:35:15] be done for you see if you say
[1:35:19] to this mountain be moved and don't
[1:35:21] doubt

[1:35:26] then you shall have what you've said
[1:35:29] when you pray
[1:35:30] believe that you receive what you ask
[1:35:33] for and ye shall have it
[1:35:36] it'll be given to you
[1:35:38] time

[1:36:52] i believed that i was going to get a
[1:36:54] certain scholarship

[1:36:57] and you know i kept speaking it
[1:37:00] and people said well how do you know i
[1:37:01] said i don't know how come i know but i
[1:37:04] know
[1:37:06] and i got it
[1:37:08] amen amen i got it
[1:37:12] i don't know how i got it but i got it
[1:37:15] it was revealed to me somehow i was
[1:37:18] going to get it and out of all those
[1:37:20] contestants
[1:37:21] out of all those people who were trying
[1:37:23] to get that particular scholarship i was
[1:37:25] the only one

[1:37:47] know i'm not the man i used to be
[1:37:51] but you know we look at these things and
[1:37:53] we fail to see
[1:37:55] even listen
[1:37:56] you don't even have to be a christian to
[1:37:58] have faith that's right that's true amen
[1:38:03] faith
[1:38:04] is what we operate by on a daily basis
[1:38:08] amen
[1:38:11] faith is god
[1:38:13] and that's something god gives every
[1:38:15] person everything you do is by faith
[1:38:18] a baby will never be a baby would never
[1:38:20] walk if that baby wouldn't have faith
[1:38:23] that he could walk
[1:38:25] you'll never ride a bicycle
[1:38:27] until you have faith to believe that you
[1:38:29] can ride one
[1:38:31] drive a car
[1:38:33] whatever it may be
[1:38:35] everything you do decision when it comes
[1:38:38] to achievement your faith must come
[1:38:40] there
[1:38:40] you must have a vision of it
[1:38:43] right
[1:38:44] musician
[1:38:47] you got to have a vision singers
[1:38:49] you have to have a vision
[1:38:51] and that vision is faith it's something
[1:38:53] that drives you to do something that you
[1:38:55] see you can do that you're not there yet
[1:38:57] but you're getting there
[1:38:59] and that faith that vision brings you to
[1:39:01] that place
[1:39:02] that you saw when you was way back here
[1:39:04] trying to learn to do it
[1:39:07] hallelujah
[1:39:09] what makes people get masters in
[1:39:11] doctor's degrees because they have faith
[1:39:12] they can do it right
[1:39:17] see if you are true seed
[1:39:19] you will hear the word
[1:39:21] that spirit baptized will baptize you
[1:39:24] into the body of christ filling you and
[1:39:27] empowering you
[1:39:29] you receive the word for your day and
[1:39:32] age amen see how clear the truth
[1:39:35] evidence become
[1:39:36] when the word is revealed to you
[1:39:38] again listen let me tell you something
[1:39:41] when you receive the word for your day
[1:39:43] and listen oftentimes we say well i
[1:39:45] received it i believe it but look where
[1:39:47] i'm at let me tell you something
[1:39:50] god has his own purpose amen god has his
[1:39:53] own plan yes sir hallelujah and even
[1:39:57] identical twins are not the same
[1:39:59] amen y'all understand what i'm saying
[1:40:02] god
[1:40:03] listen you go to an apple tree and every
[1:40:05] apple on the tree is not the same size
[1:40:07] that's right
[1:40:09] all of them don't turn red at the same
[1:40:11] time
[1:40:12] amen it all depends on where you are in
[1:40:14] the tree
[1:40:15] amen so is it with god all christians
[1:40:18] don't mature at the same time amen we
[1:40:22] don't go through the same trials
[1:40:24] taking for instance a tree that's going
[1:40:26] through a storm
[1:40:28] right if that storm is coming from the
[1:40:30] east
[1:40:31] the tree the apples whatever is on the
[1:40:34] east is going to get a real shaking
[1:40:36] now the ones on the back side of the
[1:40:38] tree may not get such a bad amen y'all
[1:40:41] understand me but they're still on the
[1:40:43] same tree yes amen
[1:40:45] it's good that's good that's the way it
[1:40:46] is with christians
[1:40:48] we go through storms but every storm we
[1:40:50] go through affects us differently
[1:40:52] amen
[1:40:55] hallelujah
[1:40:56] i'm not ashamed
[1:40:58] of the gospel of christ amen it is the
[1:41:01] power of god unto salvation amen how
[1:41:03] else i'm going to be saved without the
[1:41:05] gospel of christ how no there is no
[1:41:08] other way
[1:41:10] jesus was the royal seed and he lived in
[1:41:12] a human body and when the spirit called
[1:41:14] to him the word manifested thought he
[1:41:17] went to jordan and was baptized in water
[1:41:21] upon obeying the word the holy spirit
[1:41:24] came upon him and the voice said this is
[1:41:27] my beloved soon son hear ye him the
[1:41:30] voice did not say this has become my son
[1:41:34] no jesus was the son amen the holy
[1:41:37] spirit positioned himself at that
[1:41:41] as that son before them all then having
[1:41:44] been filled thus in the same pattern
[1:41:47] holes at pentecost and every after ever
[1:41:51] after he went in to demonstrate power
[1:41:54] receiving a full revelation of god and
[1:41:57] from god for that day amen and i'm gonna
[1:42:02] close here i've got more to go
[1:42:04] but i'll say it like this people
[1:42:09] it's a ram
[1:42:11] that we live in
[1:42:16] but fear is not something that we can
[1:42:18] allow ourselves to do
[1:42:20] amen
[1:42:22] it's in the book of job i believe
[1:42:25] if you fear it it's going to come upon
[1:42:27] you right
[1:42:29] here says in the book of job it says job
[1:42:32] feared and what he feared it actually
[1:42:34] happened
[1:42:36] what brought it here it is is fear
[1:42:40] whatever you fear it's coming
[1:42:43] it's not faith
[1:42:44] fear is just basically the perversion of
[1:42:46] faith
[1:42:48] but it's amazing how fear listen you
[1:42:50] remember that time i told you i was on
[1:42:51] american airline and i thought i was
[1:42:53] going to crash and such a fear uh uh
[1:42:56] gripped me i could hardly breathe
[1:42:58] fear is real
[1:43:00] it's real
[1:43:02] but it's not of god
[1:43:04] amen
[1:43:07] it brought it his fear and that's what
[1:43:09] happened
[1:43:10] it happened
[1:43:12] right
[1:43:13] his faith would have kept him from it
[1:43:15] but his fear brought him brought it to
[1:43:18] him
[1:43:18] he was scared it was going to happen
[1:43:21] and it did happen
[1:43:24] now
[1:43:25] if
[1:43:26] he knowed it wouldn't happen it wouldn't
[1:43:28] have happened see what i mean if you're
[1:43:30] afraid
[1:43:32] when you come by by the prayer line
[1:43:34] maybe i just haven't haven't got the
[1:43:36] faith sufficient
[1:43:39] it'll never happen
[1:43:40] don't worry see
[1:43:42] but if you know that it's going to
[1:43:44] happen it'll happen
[1:43:46] see it's a substance of something job
[1:43:49] had a fear that these things would come
[1:43:51] upon him and they did if you have a fear
[1:43:54] that your disease is going to leave
[1:43:59] or won't leave it won't that's right if
[1:44:02] you have faith that it will well you
[1:44:04] know
[1:44:05] see you can ask medical doctors the
[1:44:07] first thing he'll try to get you to do
[1:44:10] is to have confidence in the medicine
[1:44:12] he's giving you
[1:44:13] that's good
[1:44:15] that's the truth
[1:44:16] and if you're giving if you haven't got
[1:44:19] no confidence in it you better leave it
[1:44:21] alone
[1:44:23] amen that's good you know what i'm
[1:44:25] saying
[1:44:26] it's the truth
[1:44:27] and what we fail to see
[1:44:29] it's like when peter says lord if that
[1:44:31] be you bid me come
[1:44:34] well he didn't fear at the beginning
[1:44:36] but when the storm began to you know
[1:44:39] dash and
[1:44:40] the the man the man is walking on water
[1:44:46] amen and jesus is right there
[1:44:49] y'all know what i'm saying when peter
[1:44:51] began to sink and you've heard me say
[1:44:53] this before god just said oh so oh he's
[1:44:55] sinking he's sinking he's sinking let me
[1:44:57] no he was right in hand reach i'm reach
[1:45:01] jesus just lift him up why would you
[1:45:03] fear at the moment he's you can see him
[1:45:05] so much clearer
[1:45:07] i don't care how many waves of the wind
[1:45:09] but he right there you could see him
[1:45:14] your victory is right there right there
[1:45:16] amen
[1:45:17] and you fear it
[1:45:25] think about it
[1:45:27] folks let me tell you something
[1:45:31] we must live in faith amen
[1:45:34] and faith is our realm to live in amen
[1:45:38] when you resist the devil that means you
[1:45:39] just turned him down you you don't even
[1:45:41] have a conversation with him amen
[1:45:44] but faith is where you must the judge
[1:45:46] shall live by his faith amen
[1:45:48] i love it the scripture used to say the
[1:45:50] scripture say the just shall live by
[1:45:51] faith but there's one that says that
[1:45:53] just shall live by his faith
[1:45:55] that's when god comes in you you live by
[1:45:57] his faith
[1:45:58] and his faith will never fail
[1:46:02] this is the realm
[1:46:05] and that's why god is making things come
[1:46:07] before us look like it's so impossible
[1:46:09] let me tell you something don't you
[1:46:10] allow yourself to be so distracted right
[1:46:13] now
[1:46:14] because the most important thing that
[1:46:16] that god wants to happen in you is to
[1:46:18] build himself in you
[1:46:20] amen
[1:46:21] grow up into christ
[1:46:26] and understand what the word says
[1:46:29] you are a pure
[1:46:31] virtuous
[1:46:32] sinless bride
[1:46:34] of the son of the living god
[1:46:37] every man and woman that's born of the
[1:46:39] spirit of god
[1:46:40] and is washed in the blood of jesus
[1:46:42] christ and believes every word of god
[1:46:45] stands as though you've never sinned at
[1:46:48] the first place
[1:46:50] you are perfect
[1:46:52] the blood of jesus christ right
[1:46:55] that's right every man and woman
[1:46:59] i'm closing with that
[1:47:03] let's stop fearing amen
[1:47:05] let's start praying amen faith and
[1:47:08] prayer works together
[1:47:10] we used to sing that song in that little
[1:47:11] pentecostal church prayer and faith
[1:47:13] we'll always work together
[1:47:18] tearing it up
[1:47:22] but you see it it does
[1:47:25] always will work together
[1:47:28] because one thing about prayer if you're
[1:47:30] lacking faith it will give you a boost
[1:47:32] talking about a boost
[1:47:35] that's the kind of shot we need amen
[1:47:37] my boots of faith
[1:47:42] thank god good let's stand
[1:47:56] god is so good to us
[1:47:59] [Music]
[1:48:05] if there'll be no one that desired
[1:48:07] prayer
[1:48:08] we'll ask ourselves to come and
[1:48:11] sing a couple of them dismissions by
[1:48:13] god's grace i
[1:48:15] trust the word of god was a blessing to
[1:48:16] you tonight amen
[1:48:19] understand god
[1:48:21] god chose you he'll never let you go
[1:48:23] amen
[1:48:24] in his bible in his word he said i'll
[1:48:26] never leave you nor will i forsake you
[1:48:29] i don't know what job was feeling but
[1:48:31] one thing for certain he kept his
[1:48:33] integrity
[1:48:34] and because of that in the midst of that
[1:48:36] great trial understand every great trial
[1:48:39] reproduces a revelation
[1:48:42] more of god
[1:48:44] somehow you see god in a different way
[1:48:45] that you've never seen him before after
[1:48:48] the storm is all over
[1:48:52] it's necessary
[1:48:55] for all of us
[1:48:57] and i'll say because yours is different
[1:48:59] from mine doesn't mean that you're less
[1:49:01] of a christian than i am
[1:49:03] and vice versa
[1:49:05] we all get to heaven by one way and
[1:49:08] that's the blood of jesus christ
[1:49:15] [Music]
[1:49:26] deeper
[1:49:30] [Music]
[1:49:40] is the lamb
[1:49:46] [Music]
