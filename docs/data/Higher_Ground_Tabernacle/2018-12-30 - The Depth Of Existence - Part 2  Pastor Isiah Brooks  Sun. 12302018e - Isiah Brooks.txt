Christ my Lord amen oh well as we stand we're gonna get right on into the Word of God we'll be coming from Romans the eleventh chapter eleven twenty nine to twenty six Romans 11 for the gifts and calling what God are without repentance for gee in time pass have not believed God yet have excuse me yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief let me do it again for as ye in times past have not believed God yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief even so have these also now not believe that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy for God have concluded them all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all oh the depth of riches both of wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out who who have known the mind of the Lord who have been in his counsel or who have first given to him and it shall be recommenced unto him again for him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory for ever amen one more scripture just a portion of Ephesians the 3rd chapter we read the 17th verse down to the 19 that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God let us pray father we come before you and we thank you for being so good to us we thank you for everything you have done for us we pray father that your perfect will be done this evening father bless us as you blessed us this morning our cups Lord is empty open and ready to be filled anoint us Lord and your name Jesus Christ and give us hearts to receive your word in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated on this morning we left off with the the ugly mule and we talked about - how vast God is the scripture tells us that the ways of the Lord are past finding out the only way that you can understand God is by revelation you can study this Bible from cover to cover you can put line upon line and precept upon precept but until God unveil it to you in - God reveals it to you you will never understand it the Bible tells us also that the carnal mind cannot understand those things that be of God so therefore in order to understand God you need the Spirit of God to fully understand him if God should give you a revelation and sometimes he does give people revelation have not yet been baptized with the holy ghost but he will give them revelation he gave Peter revelation and Peter had not yet been baptized with the holy ghost but Peter understood who Jesus Christ was so God's ways are past finding out there are those who were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and they got the Holy Ghost or received the Holy Ghost and then there are those a man who had not yet been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and received the Holy Ghost before they got baptized so who's going to determine whether it's right to get it before or after God is the one who gives out the Holy Spirit is that right the Bible tells us that we're just one body with one body baptized into one spirit amen by the grace of God but we are here by the grace of God to understand what God is doing see we came in here amen because of the fall we came in here in a state of amnesia didn't know who God don't didn't know God didn't know who we were didn't know where we were going and where we were coming from but now that we have received the Holy Spirit God has given us the grace His grace so that we can come to a place to so we can comprehend get an understanding of what the depth the length of the height the breadth you know have some kind of understanding who God is we do know that God is our Father and we know by God's grace that we cannot amen be God's children unless we are full of the Holy Ghost the saddest part about this whole thing is is that when we came into this life or into this dimension you and I came into this dimension amen blind we could not see we were sinners shaken iniquities but we were all a part of God's plan when I think about how God said unto Abraham Abraham do you see the dust of the earth so will your children be now you got to understand that's a lot of faith there know that a man and a woman who cannot even have children not even one at the time God looks at the star the dirt of the earth and says now if you can count the sand grains of saying this is how many how your children is gonna be and he goes on says now if you can concoct the Stars hallelujah all of these stars are representing your offspring now that is faith but if Abraham could stand as a witness today he can truly say God has been faithful a man because since God gave him the promise God produced gave him a son and now because of that son amen the whole world has been blessed below both Jews and Gentiles is that right let me say like this because sometimes we don't realize Amen that everything that we do is record it that's why we need to blood the blood of Jesus Christ is the only one that can wash it whiter than snow look what he says Amen in Christ and revealed in his own word he said you're going to find out one of these days that when you go to heaven you don't fly off somewhere else you're still right here - just in another dimension faster than this right through this room is coming colors every color shirt dress whatever you got on is eternal laying right on records going around and around the world every time you bat your eyes it's right on record watch television will prove that that is so true right now Amen Marilyn Monroe been dead for so many years but you can still find her on record you can still see her in the movies and Elvis Presley been dead for years you can still hear his voice you can still see his face you can still see all the dirty did why because it's a record and God said just as those things are on the record of man God keeps record as well is that right so no man will be able to say what Lord I didn't do it cuz God and the day of judgment if you're not a Christian will flash it up right there and everybody will see every dirt everything you ever did that's why the blood of Jesus Christ if you need a hiding place that's where you go hide see God is amazing a man no man no man every man that faces God as a sinner has faced God as a sinner because it's been his choice hallelujah because God cannot judge a man if he'd ever gave him an opportunity to be saying but every man is judged by their own choices is that right hallelujah since when you were born God sets a record on it don't see put a record on it don't make much noise for a little while and that's a truth he said that's when you're a baby and you're not accountable for your sin that's the silent part that's little baby till it comes to accountability then the noise starts he starts saying things and doing things that he has an answer for and then when that life is that record or tape is took off and laid in the great big library of God now how you're going to get away get around it at the judgment bar it plays right back in front of you every move you made every thought went through your mind can you see that now can you see where God is see you got to realize Amen that God is like not like us he can never forget the only thing that makes God forget is his blood hey man when God forgot is because he you have given your life and your sins to him and he throws it in the sea of forgetfulness and God can no longer remember your sins and I guarantee you there's everyone everybody in here won't want God to forget some things don't we hallelujah but God is vast god is great God is in all in above all I see him in the stars I see him in the Sun I see him in the moon I see him in the trees he was well I I don't believe in God cuz I cuz I can't not see him well you don't believe in the air you breathe because you cannot see the air in which you breathe but those trees will move to indicate that God if there's a wind somewhere ha ha hallelujah and we we don't even know we don't know the last breath we take but did you know that God has already said and numbered the breaths that you're going to take it keeps a well you know our science have gotten so great too we can extend man's life that's a lie no man can know science can extend man's life the Bible said God has no beginning and ending when God gets ready for you I don't care from standing in the pulpit like me if God calls my car like a drop right now you don't even have to be sick it's when your number is called when your days are over and like I said it meant James shed is like a vapor it's such a short time you and I we were looking at Esther's pictures the other day and in how she was when she was small and how she's grown up now amen but you know it has happened so quickly I remember when we were changing Christopher I mean when he was a baby hey man and look how grown and tall he is now you see it doesn't take long it happens right in the face you know and you say well brother listen I can remember when I used when I first came the line by Iowa I was running eight miles a day 4:00 in the morning and 4:00 in the evening let me try it now I can't even run on eight eight corners almost but nevertheless it just shows you how time so quickly and so fast right now you said what what do you mean Brotherhood's this is this time I'm not talking about eternity this is just this little little I mean even even even when it came to the time you know James didn't know how to talk to say it it were the fastest thing I ever seen coming or was a vapor hallelujah it moves so quickly through came here we go it's gone amen but see even in that short period of time God keeps account of everything we do and say the saddest thing is as we said we have moved into a world where God has blinded the minds of the people see they have eyes to see but they can't see right they have eyes they maybe even even when Jesus Christ came on the scene the Jew was so blinded they did not even recognize their Messiah hmm and God could be standing right here or sitting right there by somebody and you'll never know it except you be spiritual God comes in the church and somehow they come in the church and then hear the Word of God they leave out here excited and then the another person to come out come out says well you know I found it was quite boring I didn't get nothing see is the mindset is when you come with the right mindset is when God can feed you hallelujah see the Bible said if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not is that right and that's what it is I mean psychology and all of these reasonings that people reason God out because they don't think it ought to be a certain way they feel that God going to change the book for them God won't change the book for himself not one word will fall to the ground everything that God has promised will be callaloo and guess what he's big enough to do it I don't think nobody in here can stand before God and tell him that he ain't gonna do it help us Jesus for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus sake for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness have shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ something came to me just now and I'm sure every one of us probably have experienced this and I don't know really they used to know the old folks says you know the witch was riding you last night it's when you try to get up and you can't get up when you try to wake up and you can't wake up but you know that ain't God that's doing it you having a bad dream and you need to call on Jesus and you can't get him out your mouth you can't get your mouth all you can just feel like yourself you just screaming in Holland and nobody can hear you that ought to wake people up it ought to make them see they're not in control of their lives and sometimes God puts a demon on you just to show you you are that you do not have the power over your flesh hallelujah and there are times the only way I could get out of it was to call on Jesus and I had to work at it when we see how good god has been to us we need to see show how God you know you got to understand there was a reason why God had Israel here as I said this morning no man have seen God at any time but when God wants to be seen he occupies a flesh body he shows a many people and so when God comes to occupy to show himself he comes down and such a are you aware of humility and put it this way look at God comes and we just so-called celebrated Christmas but my thing is God could have been born in a mansion but God came down and was born in a manger and I understand that that manger was a was a cave a little place where you know not not like they have it in the movies but a cave opening in the cave in the rock I like that part where they kept the sheeps and goats and whatever the ball they fed them there they kept them there and they slept in there you know some of them so you look at this thing you said well why did God do that because he wanted to let people know though he was God he knew how to Humble himself he was he wanted them to know that listen I want to be a known and I want to be understood amen that that I can I want to be I can touch the feelings or can be touched by the feelings of the infirmities of even the poor people I'm so glad everybody's so excited tonight smiles and hallelujahs and praises to God I can't hardly stand it up here whoo hallelujah but listen the the Bible tells us that people don't be selfish people are going to be you know you know they pay all about themselves and you know even when it comes to God they don't feel like it you know they have to do this you see but the Bible says this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come first men shall be lovers of their own selves I don't feel like doing it lovers have their own self I don't think it's necessary lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents world that's a big one I'm thankful unholy without natural affection trucebreakers you know what those breakers are those who break the peace hmm those who feel like is okay Amen to fuss and fight and carry oh oh bradwick brothers when you know made peace would you stir it all up again trucebreakers I looked it up I'm like I thought I knew what to speak as well till I looked it up this evening you don't call a truce you don't call for peace and then here come here come again stirring the pot all over again God said that's bad hallelujah lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness and i was hitting that today that's what having a form of godliness is looking like you got the Holy Ghost and you don't hallelujah but denying the power thereof I want it but I don't want to get it like that hmm from such turn away ooh but you and I must realize that the vast is oh I can't understand this I think about it all the time the scripture says no man can add a cubit to his statue you can't do it I can't do it only God can do it but one thing for certain we have an assurance that God knew us from the foundation of the world and we were in the mind of God and so therefore being in the mind of God even we can rest assure that whatever God has determined for me is for me whatever God has determined for you is for you hallelujah and no matter what Satan tries to stop you oh my god is the truth think about the woman a man at Jericho who was a prostitute all her life but in the mind of God she was a daughter of God and yet she didn't know it hallelujah and yet God took a whole millions of people out of Egypt traveled them through the wilderness for 40 years until Rahab became an adult terrain became up for a person Amen that that could respond to the gospel and when God saw Amen Rahab was ready God told Joshua it's time to cross time to cross over I've got a seat over there see no matter what she looked like to the public in the mind of God she was a daughter of God that's what I'm talking about it doesn't matter what what family you born in coming to this well the way we do people are evil people do evil things and your parents amen though you were born a man this he's excused there's nobody who I know of that was born into a good family they're only good family is a family of God hallelujah it doesn't matter who's a prostitute a whoremonger whatever god don't look at that God looks at once he put there in you before the foundation of the world hallelujah if the soil is not the thing is to see you said what do you mean look at brother Adam he comes in there his daddy's an alcoholic hallelujah his mama kind of looked down because you have a white and fat half Indian you know a man he's about her being a come on somebody it's the truth hallelujah he had a bet his family had a bad reputation but it wasn't that that's not what God was looking at surely he was born in a manger he was born in a mess hallelujah but God saw who we were even at the day of his birth the pillar fire come down and swept to in the window hallelujah y'all see what I'm saying it doesn't matter Amen while you got here it's what you gonna do after you get here hallelujah hey man is that Alright a little you don't even have to be educated to even do something for God cuz on didn't have no education huh Johnny meditate the twelve was out there in the will amen learning about snakes then he comes up in men and he comes to the church and he see the people hacking like snakes you say you generation of vipers who gonna win who gonna warn you to flee from the wrath that is to come you see because he saw the nature of the preachers and he he judged a man by the fruit he would see hallelujah this okay I was there 49 through 11 I tell you what I wish I could preach this message like God showed me on my bed hallelujah but revelation is quite difficult to share but if you can see what I'm trying to say that even though we we look at these chairs and these chairs one time they the wood chairs anyway used to be he was alive hmm but you know every tree is not made into a chair just like every or every little metal amen every piece of that metal was ordained to be in that particular chair right there we never think about it every screw everything that's been made to form that chair God saw that now tell me if that's not brilliant he saw that one day we would go worship in this church and we would have all kinds of colors in here of chairs he saw that hallelujah he saw exactly where we're sitting he saw everything it nothing surprises God that's just that's just so mine he knows the battles he knows every demon every devil we have to deal with and he's willing and willing to get rid of all of him yeah God like to cast out Devils hallelujah Oh funny this is all Zion that bringeth forth good tidings get thee up into the high mountains O Jerusalem that brings good tidings lift up that voice with strength lift up be not afraid say unto the cities of Judah behold your God behold the Lord will come with strong hand and his arm shall rule for him behold his reward is with him and his work before him he shall feed his flock like a shepherd he said gather the lands with his arms and carry them in his bosom and shall gently lead those that are with young come on somebody so God is doing the leadership God is doing the carrying God is to Shepherd he's the one that's protecting us not you he's protecting us hallelujah listen he's so great he's his presence his vastness like I said he's he's the creator of space hallelujah I don't know how to say it I can see it right now as I preached but he's he's all hallelujah and everything that was created was created in him because there's nothing on the outside of him he feels every crack every corner he feels all and in all who had measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and meted out heaven with the span and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure and weigh the mountain and scale in his heels in a balance who have directed the Spirit of the Lord or being his counselor have taught him anybody can anybody tell me that you can teach God hallelujah yeah God has said had you in his mind he saw you there hallelujah that's just how vast he is that's how people talk about the depths of God the depths of God can only be found in the love of God hello yeah because God is love when you began to love like you are - that's when God began to break the word he began to share things with you that he won't share with anybody else but because it's a love affair his love Plus love equals love hallelujah when God can trust you he can show you things that he can't show anyone else is that right oh yeah Paul loved God so much that he was willing to love God he died three times he was shipwrecked beaten so many times he loved God and guess what but he even counted joy is that right kind of joy right when you fall into divers temptations all those things well says listen I have learned to be a bass I've learned to humble myself hallelujah Paul says listen I've seen I've had all kinds of experiences but in all of my experiences the thing I want people to see is Christ in me not a hard to live but Christ lives in me whatever I do I want them to see Jesus not me Paul said is not hard that live but Christ that lives in me if the people could see that see you and I can't expect to stay in the King's Chamber acting like Vesta or vasty no sure yeah man Vashti was she she was arrogant she was prideful she was Queen she had a she had a queen spirit owner hallelujah the difference between Esther Esther had a servant spirit hallelujah Esther had a humble spirit she knew how to come before the King's Chamber call the humility cold in the Holy Spirit but vast ah it's like the church is like the people Amen whoo oh I'm in the message I'm in the message and they got such a prideful spirit that is not what God is looking for hallelujah in choosing of a bride brother well said God that that look that up rancher son he saw all those girls and they all deal it up and dawn up it all kind of stuff tell me what God looking for he's looking for a barefooted poor looking girl Amen who cares nothing about the well but she's got that's what God is looking for he's looking for character he's searching for somebody that's going to worship Him in spirit and in truth hallelujah he's looking for somebody that's compatible miss Jesus Christ who can produce the same kind of love oh that's what he said the prophet of God said we must pray that we're not from satan's either hmm with who Tukey counselor and who shall instruct him and taught him in the path of judgment and taught him knowledge and showed him the way of understanding as if there's somebody here who could do it hallelujah what's that man that genius that died not too long ago a man that almost became a computer himself what was his name but my point but poor hallelujah it did making a difference how smart he was he had to die and if he didn't know Jesus Christ with all that education he's lost no other way and I'll tell you what give me let me be a dummy if I gotta be a dummy to get to hell and let me be a dummy because what all what did that do for him Oh people can brag on him in this dimension but in the dimension he's in he wish he could come back one more time hallelujah and do it all over again mmm she Paul says listen up I understand things about this way like I said see that's what people don't understand they look at their flesh and they think that flesh can be saved your flesh won't be save until Jesus quicken it that old little devil gonna be hanging on you until you die or to Jesus rapture you that old devil amen after you leave him he gonna rot that old devil he's gonna ride in the grave come on somebody they ain't no skin worms in heaven but I can tell you this skin worms in hell hallelujah the Bible said there's a land which is it with your him where the worms never die fool can you imagine hallelujah think about it ooh so you and I must understand Paul says listen I sure God there are times at times I want to do good and that don't do it I mean the time when I whenever I don't want to do bad I end up doing bad you there's two laws there but they call for the law of grace he said that two laws then he said there's a law in my member and there's a law on the inside that inside law is how I serve God that's why I needed the Holy Ghost I needed a king on the inside of my heart hallelujah I needed to become a kingdom hallelujah within the kingdom hallelujah I needed a meant something on the inside that can cause me to worship God in spirit and in truth I can't do it as a natural man because my natural man is carnal don't you know God knew that he knew Jeremiah was gonna get frustrated Jeremiah said God you tricked me you don't trick me LaHood you told me I was going to be this and that you told me I preach you told me you called me before I was in my mother's womb you fashioned me Lord but you never told me they were gonna beat me up they're gonna reject me the way they did you didn't show me how I was gonna suffer for your namesake let me tell you something when you are true living son or daughter of God you gonna suffer for the namesake of Jesus ha cuz God gonna make it happen did you know that brother BAM said God loves to lead us into traps he loves to read lead us in the traps why because he want to see how you going to come up out of it he know you will it doesn't matter how big the stone that day the devil don't roll over the tomb God says hey you roll it away hallelujah you will see a resurrection boom and every man and woman has the faith to roll that stone of unbelief away I don't care louder here he said I didn't like this all my life roll away the stone ask God for the faith to roll away the stone think about it you think those few women amen could have just roll that stone by themselves Marion loved to roll away that stone a stone that would perhaps a ton of more know how heavy it was but I've been there and the stone is no way you can weigh it on the scale it was very big round stone roll away the stone the Bible didn't say they had no help it took faith Rollo for to win the roll even that they were big strong women but all I can tell you that you know it was it was so big that even the Roman soldiers couldn't easily roll it away but they rolled away to stone why because jesus said if you do that you'll see the resurrection hallelujah not in the future now hallelujah and that's why God allows certain things too late in our lives things that are just just keep us in the tube hallelujah keep us in a bad position but God says I have given you the faith to do it if you can realize I'm the creator of all these things and is there anything too hard for God if you can see that I'm the one and all you have to do is trust me and I will give to you your heart's desire that's the truth it's the truth right for now being is no more that I do it that's what Paul said but sin that dwelleth in me but I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing don't trust it don't you even trust it for to will is present it's present with me but now how to perform that which is good I find not now Paul who is a prophet is telling me he had trouble in his flesh hello Paul is telling me he failed God at times Oh a prophet you know I don't quote this so many time but remember brother Branham God told brother Branham if you don't move when that man come there cut that tree down you gonna beat him up and God gave him a vision folks that means it was in process that means it was going to happen that wasn't just a dream that was a vision and brothers hitting a man hitting and kicking down the heel and everything and the Holy Ghost says if you don't move this is just what you're gonna be doing hello I profit but you and I must realize amen if God don't keep you he is a keeper that's why I said grieve not the Holy Ghost you can have the Holy Ghost and still do wrong things they don't grieve it God is the keeper of the house hallelujah oh you sure wanna be we remember when God told brother Branham don't smoke he was getting pressure from and dad him to drink in his in women's and smoke and he said every time he tried to do that those go yeah happen that was enough for me right there I wouldn't come for a second hallelujah I would have been running Lord I'm sorry forgive me I'm sorry y'all understand me you know I'm using this for an example to show you people of God he even had a higher high calling a greater calling in his day than we have in that way you know we're called to be bright which is a higher calling but he was prophet and bride you see what I'm saying so you got to realize by God's grace that the emphasis are given to us now because to whom much is given much is required God don't want church folk God have had church folks for thousands of years you know won't you just a joint church and be something just sitting up in here amen oh praise God I go to church I mean you know that's what you want to sell it for is that what we're gonna be just just to come in here and just warm the chairs up throw this action in Christ there's so much life in Christ and that's what God see God I listened to the message amen God in His Church in God brother I'm saying God love bravery you know I'm no coward he love bravery that struck this morning I'm like we just put another log on my fire hallelujah I find in a law that when I would go do good evil is present with me for I delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see is that right he said but I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members is that right how many times you've gone to church and you've had a wonderful time just the Holy Ghost falling all over you and everything else and just write out the service or something you forgetting something happen to you say Oh Lord the devil say see what you just did ain't nothing he's alive and you you you foolish to believe that huh him and he just told you a lie God God not you will come to you without making a change whenever God comes he makes a change hallelujah now it's up to you to receive the chain but God when he comes he brings a change you just got to have faith to hold fast to that change is that right hallelujah it's just like healing and you know people don't understand healing is something that's great but healing take faith healing can look at this dimension healing is not up this I mentioned healing is a supernatural element of God and in order to handle that you must be on the supernatural mind to handle healing because the devil it'll bring you to smell to see the taste and all the feelings Amen that comes with being sick and everything else and if you it all depends on who which one of those sermons you enjoy the most you enjoy the sermon of God with His stripes I'm healed you heal hallelujah but if you just feel so sick god I'm just dissing oh I see you gonna remain that now I know I've experienced it from experience when you know especially with a headache all my headache is getting worse and when I do that guess what I just cursed myself let me move on people of God so I want you to understand this vastness the depth of existant the depth of existence because you gotta understand you're not just here you just didn't come here to be here and eat our brothers coming from Iowa City y'all just y'all I know y'all let's go let's go to Des Moines but you will understand that still an inspiration and the inspiration comes from God why are you alone and nobody else there's something for you God has something and you got to find out what it is but God has something and when I come when I say these things I don't say it to flatter you but there's a brother that comes to the church here all the way from Ames faithfully comes when he's here and then we have people right around the corner won't even come and they don't see that God one day will rebuke them now how greater the rebuke is did to the people here in the morning that did that the brothers from Iowa City comes an hour and 45 minutes to church on Sunday night don't let God using you you better believe it hey man so you and I must realize all these things God see everything is on record hallelujah and when it comes to your time God will not fail you he won't fail you people he's not going to let you down he's not a failure as I read that quote this morning the Prophet God said God don't save you no one he's gonna lose you ten days from them God don't do that he's not a tease if you come to God and accept God as your Savior God accepts you because guess what he gave you the desire come o somebody you don't have to be old Lord I might mr. wrapped if you've got the Holy Ghost there's no way you can hallelujah because that's what he's coming back for not yo fleshly but he changing that he's going to change that but that inward man posted I worship Him according to the inward man hallelujah I know there's been a change in me I'm a wrassle against this bar right here but I know there is a changing me oh not what I used to be I'm not gonna even try because I'm always missing it hallelujah but I do know one thing for certain I have changed God changed me from death unto life and what am i doing I'm climbing Ezekiel's ladder did y'all know now we got this ladder going up like a pyramid but in the DNA the ladder goes like this like a spiral hmm like a spiral still going up but you got to understand that you know you're going in a circle as you climb and what people don't understand is this when you and I that life that ladder all of that is DNA all that is showing you by God's grace that that God has everything control even in your blood he's already determined what kind of person you're gonna be he understood amen what kind of hair you're gonna have what color eyes are gonna have amen and all that stuff y'all see what I'm saying he knew that and you could not have come in any other kind of way come on you might see somebody that look really sharp and you think wow what I what that was what I would have been like if I had looked like that but you don't know the man's battles I don't care if I'm ugly as of you give me my bad I don't want yours I have I don't care if you look better than me you might have some harmful things going on on the inside y'all know what I'm saying so let's move on by God's grace you know we look at this thing because I'm trying to get us to see that God now listen if God said to brother Isaac if you have the faith to say to this mountain be thou move and believe in your heart move it shall be done now think about this now see yourself you're like a grain of sand to a mountain if that dust but in you you have the ability to move that mountain now understand is not by power nor by might but by my spirit say at the law that means that dust that little piece of dust all he has to do is speak and the end and the vastness the depth of God the existence of God will move that for you now Shiva saying it makes God even greater yeahjust it does something and make God so great just to see that God can use me and you to do his work brother I said you can't see him you can't see him but he takes a house we become his eyes we come as ears we become his mouth we become his hands amen and yet and still this world don't even see them don't see him you know we talk about the judgement bomber clothes in just a minute talking about the judgment bar because everybody believed that the bride of Jesus Christ when she'd get over there she gonna be like get to him go to him go to him go don't you know you meant you and I on this lady grace we are the mercy of God we're the feminine part of God hello look look at Jesus amen whether was it was John what was that guy that was a preacher and he and he died and he he he thought he was getting into the gates and Gaber says I don't see your name on the list he said he's gotta be on the list huh he gotta be there he said but it's not here he said the only thing I can do to tell you you got to appeal to the white throne judgment he said what he said he okay that's kept going I'd rather appeal him to go straight you know oh he said okay and he said all of a sudden he found himself traveling he was in this like traveling traveling traveling he said then all of a sudden he stopped and he was in this light that was so bright and he said he heard the voice with I can't get his name John I'm gonna say John huh what was his name ah Keene baby wait cause his name have you ever stolen yes Laura have you ever lie cuz see when you get in that light that's when your sin is most sinful and he says oh he said all of a sudden it got quiet he said I use it all of a sudden I just thought oh he's gonna he's gonna say depart from me you work of iniquity he said but all of a sudden in the back back of me he said I heard the sweetest voice sweeter than a mother's voice he's a lord John stood for me on earth and I'll stand for him now I can't think of his name right now anybody knows named Daniel Daniel Currie that's right amen and my mind was far away from Daniel but you know what God knew is so he made y'all remember so we look at these things and you and I must realize that man here was Daniel Currie and God blesses this man I wanna shake his hand when I get there but you know I look at these things I see everything you do for Christ will last you and I will never old God anything and what he doesn't pay you if he doesn't pay you here and now he'll pay you when you get on the other side in that amazing that God is gonna pay you for allowing you allowing him to use your body he gonna pay you and he's the one doing the work he's the one doing the work Oh Oh merci is this okay now listen likewise and this I'm coming to this before cold he said likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as all as we ought but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searches the heart and knoweth what is in the mind of the spirit now understand me now you got the Holy Spirit you got God and you got the Holy Spirit God steel God right he knows the mind of the spirit because it's his spirit and he knows the spirit you got here didn't didn't brother I'm said God God puts a watchman over us he puts a person he says it somebody he said the Holy Ghost reports back to God the Holy Ghost report back to himself what's really going on in you and when you don't know how to pray the Holy Ghost intercedes for you this thing is so powerful to me because let me say like this remember here Peter ordained of God to be the preacher on the day of Pentecost tells Jesus you're not gone to Calvary and Jesus looked beyond Peter and said Satan see he was in another dimension he knew that wasn't Peter that was trying to stop him to go in the Calvary knowing that Peter loved him he didn't ask Peter Peter do you love me right so he knows they meant by God's grace so you say well be sometimes even out of our own mouth comes negativity doubt and unbelief and God to bring a word from the preacher then I cut you make it right and you say thank you Jesus huh it's God it's God hallelujah all right I'm at the end of my journey but look at these things I want to say this when God comes in and he works in your behalf which he will always why for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son so if he knew you he he you already been predestinated to do what be conformed and don't you know when god conforms you or transform you there's always a lot of pain hello you can't be a Christian without paying folks you cannot be a Christian without rejection people gonna reject you you cannot be a Christian a man without battling and having fights is that right the only way you can be a you gotta suffer hmm and when I'm gonna tell you like this let me put it this way when would you rather suffer now or later you know everybody's a little slow now I didn't have the thing I knew who listened give me my suffering now whatever I got to do because I realized I'm not something for evil I'm suffering for good God is moving the evil out of me all right everything you go through it is listen cashing out devils it's not always laying their hands some Devils leave because you refuse to do what they want you to do right it's the truth y'all remember y'all remember our what was his name I can't think of his name right now brother jewel fawning your father said he got his mom a whip tell my mom and dad I don't know which one it was whipped him so good he didn't ever tell he'd never told us what he did he said hit but they whipped him they beat him bad he said he said and then that devil came back around and says let's do this he said no less they gonna do nothing you do it see cuz you get me in trouble and I get the beaten I'm not even saying it lucky you know you know how to devastate okay let's go drink yeah no no how he says it oh you know you wanna drink I don't drink but I'm just using that for an example he's all you know you want a drink oh you want a drink you go drink cuz I'm not gonna do it the deviling will keep coming to you v ain't got no drinking party he need a drinking partner you love the Horde see this is the end but the Gentile bride of Christ you weren't you see when God took Israel and I understand I can see it clearly I came in like I told you if I could give it to you the way he gave it to me you know God talked to me last night and this message came from God I know it came from God the first part in the second part but my point is I can't seem to give it to you like he gave it to give it to you the way he gave it to me but I'm doing my best because I see now why should you fear a younger state I think David knew what he's talking about the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want right and then gave us us who shall I fear the Lord is the light of my salvation he is a revelation to myself I can't save me you can't save you God is the savior of the soul is that right just like brother I'm saying even a preacher can't save you he can be under the anointing and he can preach it but God is the one that must save you he's not even a healer I'm no healer god is her healer he is the deliverer God is everything and he will not give his glory to no man the Gentile bride of Christ must prove to be a witness to the unity of God in his universe and in his people so you're not just here amen as as church members church members a dime a dozen now no I'd say 20 a dozen 20 or 20 but 24 for 10 cent to death would you find him everywhere but what God is looking for is somebody that he can use even probably God said if God can get one man in the same y'all know that's my prayer that's my prayer ah I know there are other Christians in this message I know that but you know I'm looking for a hundred percent I really want God to use me a hundred percent you see it doesn't matter how small it may seem as long as I do what he wants me to do you know I think about this woman and I'm closing now but I got a two more things I want to state this woman at Simon's house you don't yell you do y'all realize the courage it took for her to enter into Simon's house she was a prostitute she could have been readily stoned right she was a prostitute folks they could have stolen her and you know they moved out of her way but I can almost see her you know you know sometimes when people want to really brush up interior here you think you better than me huh yeah brother Mannis say she elbowed her way through the crowd and you know and that means she forcibly entered she got in there and she got the crying and weeping she had Church all by herself listen that look that an auntie was right there and all she knew is that she was enjoying herself y'all you know say that's what I said this morning until we get rid of this pride that we have among ourselves this dignity and whatever you call it Amen I uh you know you you always worried about what other people think about you as long as you think like that you ain't gonna get it you're not gonna get it the way you want it because God would come and touch you or he might say shout oh he might say say hallelujah and then if you do this you just missed him you just missed him I remember one time praying for the Holy Ghost years ago when I was really really praying for the Holy Ghost and and and I got to a place it just like I knew this was the next move I was just right there and the devil said if you're going any further you're gonna lose your mind and I for a moment like brother said I stopped for a moment and when I did the Holy Ghost now just just like that you know why because I didn't trust him I lost trust right that's what he wanted me he wanted me to push and now that I'm in the message you know what you know brother don't say you got to push through the sound barrier the devil is telling you you're you're gonna get in you ain't worthy you know that means you are wise that's been you've gone to get it he's the man there's time to stop you from God there Oh then we winning winning when he can't stop you they so you know you tied you gotta work you got to do this you gotta do that he pause all those obligations on you the moment you stop because he you're getting the Holy Ghost must be more important than your job your school your family friends and all these things has to be is that right you know I saw what brother Bennett told sister say sisters you need to you know you don't how'd he say it I can't say it verbatim but he says like if she you know she has her duties he says stop all that get with God don't worry about cooking and dishes and all that right some of these brothers wouldn't want to hear that but sometimes the sisters fear for their husbands more than they fear God and when you know you need God hallelujah move out my way I'm coming you gotta be that way fanatical is what God needs some fanatics hmm y'all come on y'all know it's the truth if we could be toward God like these football and basketball teams are a mentored to our dear God a piece of pig skin or whatever full of hair and they jump in with their shirts off and all of us all of us they got y'all don't know they doing our dance that's what where were you Joe when the sons of God jumped for joy huh it's just a devil mimicking us hallelujah and they getting out there doing all the stuff and then they come and said now you be quiet now you'd be consecrated oh ho lord have mercy ah I believe David was a man of God's own heart because david knew what god liked and wanted and he gave it to him you know all of us don't worship the same now i'm not saying it but give God whatever you have right you give him if he's got a one hand salute give it to him y'all know that man that I'm closing you know the man down and um uh uh you know a random tabernac he's going to be with the Lord and uh he go hey he's a black brother he's a black brother brother brother Tom Brown y'all he's going on the view of the Lord he said they was getting ready to sit down and their brothers in high it scared him so bad he scoot all out the chair and they went to ask brother Brandon was that the Holy Ghost brother and said you better believe it is listen from now you hear them on the take some time hi he said the holy goes to hear them at some of the strangest times it could be quiet easy Oh bless its heart you know what I'm trying to say it's whatever God wants but whenever God tells you to do something it won't be out of order all right it'll be in his order it may look out of order to some people Saul's daughter thought that David was out of order there must illustrate to the world the blessedness of serving the true God you know I've seen people and they claim to be in the word and they look like they just ate a lemon or some something I don't know they go and they got you know especially the women look like they in prison there it hadn't smile in a long time so they face look like they haven't smiled now who wants that I don't want your Yoko your religion or whatever you got if you can't ain't gonna make you smile he ain't gonna make you laugh ain't gonna let the Sun Shine I don't want it cuz you don't worry you are happy how are you gonna give me something and you ain't happy with what you have no it's the truth no it's true I go to preaching churches and you know it like everybody burn into his gates with Thanksgiving in this court with praise give me something somebody please [Laughter] it's the truth is sad focus sad but it ain't gonna get no better it's gonna get worse you know you just got to keep your joy but we suppose not always supposed to enjoy you know like I was on the plane and that lady saw something she saw a light cuz she says you know you got this a lot and she said like she didn't complete the word light but I didn't know what was hanging over me where it was she saw it she thanked me for it she knew I was a Christian before I told her I was weren't she said oh you did I mean right in front of everybody else she totally you different you're different hallelujah thank God for His grace that's what I want people to see hallelujah let me share it to you brothers listen don't ever think about listen the Word of God said all things are possible to them that believe when you realize God is God he they come to God must be first believe that he is God and that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek God don't think God is like this you did this this book is it is God but it's only in level 4 but this is only the redemption plan it's so much more know that God will spend eternity because he's so vast there's no beginning there's no ending is deep you can't get no deeper than divine love let me tell you that now when you got dibela you are peculiar people person and you are deep because you can do things nobody else can do and divine love conquers everything all things you and I the bride of Jesus Christ must produce the Messiah according to the prophets prophesy this is this is not something well you know argh you know I'm in the message and you know address right and I look right and you know I'm miserable most people look like they're miserable like what's wrong with folks even the mr. trials you ought to say hallelujah in your head you goddess think too good you're not dead and you're living you can hear the word of God you got time and space to repent y'all know what I'm saying and you're not we've got so much to be thankful for millions brother said there were millions of people lost when God saved him think about it when God saved you millions were going to hell and God saved you luh luh and it doesn't stop yet you not have no idea all the good things we've done for God yet we don't know it one of these old days God gonna roll out or listen you said Lord when did I do that is that the word that's the word you're doing things you don't even know you're doing and yet you right in line with God even sometimes people say well you know a person none backslidden oh my god done left you don't know what God is doing God used Sampson when he back slid uh-huh God used Ruth and the Naomi and all and you use them even in their backs means that God used them huh God will use you whenever he want to however he wants to I tell your story enclosing friend of mine he going on the with the Lord Jim McLean he went down there in the rough little area in near Lima waited to this club and stopped preaching in this man's club everybody dancing carrying a light brother him just went right on in there guess who gets saved the owner the owner got saved came into this message and shut the club down I think in the course of two years he died hello guess what he died on his way to church with his Bible in his hand didn't even leave out the house yet and hit the flow bet somebody help me you know I don't I have no doubt you don't tell the Lord I said Lord you know me I say God you know me I said if you take me before the rapture I said I just want people to know I made it do something to encourage the people that I made it you know manok I was a out in a Colorado California Arizona one time and a brother brother uh the pastor wanted us to go pray for this one sister and God told me don't go because this was a time now people think I'm crazy when I tell him God said if I ever say that God said you better believe God said because I don't just say that randomly or loosely and everybody so why don't you come on in God says no I said uh you know no because I had experienced that one time before brother Dorsey local brother right now in Michigan his first wife died and we were at a camp meeting and I got jumped because the people told me I well you need to come pray with us all the minister's going on says no God told me it was her time to go home oh you cursing the lady you should be saying stuff like that I said they shot me I said well what am I supposed to do God told me not to pray for cuz it was her time to go home yeah I had three two or three brothers that really got hard on me because I said dad and I think before we left Michigan that's just ahead on going home and they had prophesied saying that she was gonna rage she was gonna live thank God told me no it wasn't gonna happen same way with the lady there in in Arizona I didn't go but I heard the story they said when when they got to the hospital said all her children children was at the hospital and nobody called each other she was in a coma ready to go and all of a sudden she woke up and she saw all of our children and everything and I can't remember all she said but she was glad to see him and the late they said the lady starts talking about people who she was seeing in the room just like bars were seeing all the people in the room and stuff amen and she began to see all the people in the room all of a sudden she broke out and Amazing Grace laid back went home that's what I'm talking about [Music] all my life trying to make people know that that dimension is real so when I enter into it I want God if he doesn't do nothing else you know he don't have to do a hallelujah you know I don't know what he would like do but my point is I want people to know I made it God is good to me and I'm gonna tell you something people when when you see God every preacher no he ain't he's not worthy of this pulpit there's nothing about me that makes me worthy of this pulpit I have battles just like all of you and their days I do good in days I don't but I know how to call on God and ask God for forgiveness I know how to ask God for his cleansing power hmm when I thought it ain't always pure but I try my best to keep them that way I listen just like I said this morning I said I listened to tapes almost every day I pray every day I may not pray hour after hour sometimes I pray hours sometimes I don't I just go by the leading of the Lord however he is it's not like like talk a little or my wife sometimes my conversation with my wife is short sometimes they're low that's how it is with God don't put them in a box let God have his way I asked the people I said how many of y'all be listening to tapes you know people can sit right there and they can judge you and they think you don't even hear what they're saying or thinking and here you are in the Spirit of God and God telling you things and you preaching things and you know where it's going and and they think you don't know but see they fail to see this ain't me once I'm in the anointing it ain't me that's God is talking and they failed it's like brother said they they take that he's so bad he's so powerful yet when he when he's on the scene they don't recognize his presidency that's how come so many people miss God and we look at things and we say lord have mercy I can't tell you folks but honestly honestly and just if it's if it's just that anointing on me keep pushing and praying and fighting amen to move forward I just believe that the rapture is so close at hand I don't say that to be saying it I really do believe it I don't know what that's gonna happen in 2019 but a sister sent me a little thing about about about it happening in 2019 in May but I can tell you when I really believe it's going to happen around Easter because brother branham lean too much water one Easter morning resurrection morning it happened on our Christmas did you know that brother Branham was actually born on the same day Jesus it's in there a medium told him that your birthday was the same day of Jesus's and God gave it to you as a memorial so whenever he was born that's when Jesus was more that's why the pillar of fire come down look same scenario Jesus was in a cave brother Anna was in a shag what's the difference huh springtime hmm so I'm just sharing with you by God's grace I really believe that's when it's gonna be because if you read the sixth seal you'll find out it'll be around that time it won't be Anna in the wintertime persecution to come in right sides and season seasons work with signs you know as harsh and hard in the wintertime you know pray that your flight be not in the winter all right yeah where's God you know we we are blessed people I love spring because it's quiet when when it's blossoming nobody hear those little little flowers opening up my hitta thunderstorm we might here see the lightning but that little flower is just really enjoying everything is every other scene went a little slow for slow-moving movies when nature's blooming and blossoming there is just like like beautiful dance you know I'm getting carried away let's let's stay yeah I'm feeling pretty good myself yeah Satan anyway I'm feeling pretty good because I realized her it's difficult for my mind to grasp it though but I believe I'm a seed of God that's what inspires me that's what keeps me moving alright and I believe that nothing can take it from me no matter how hard Satan fights that's one thing he can't take away and he's amazing cuz everytime Satan tried to come in a certain way God would come right back and say say remember your mind ha ha I love the Lord don't ever think God is so small he can't handle your problems remember that sway the devil will us turn it make make us think that God is little he's small God is all that in all he hears you before you call he answers your prayer before you ask he's always there even in those little small time when you say Lord I need a little sleep God gives you sleep when you say God increased my thirst for you he increased your thirst he's always there he just you know and the thing about it I forget some time but he says I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you I will be with you always even to the end of time my god is awesome he can do anything when man fail when man stop God has that opportunity to show himself that's why the devil don't want you to know that he wants you to think God is small and he's greater than God and you know he won't to entrap you and you make you think that whatever trap he got you in you can't get out and the Bible said that God breaks the Fowler's snare he's the one that breaks and destroy the yokes God is and I know by God's grace if you depend on him he will never let you down never ever let you down let's pray father we thank you for being so good to us and forgive me Lord if I got a little carried away just bragging on your Jesus I I can't help it sometimes I get so stirred when I hear the name of Jesus no matter where coming from lord I love talking about you lord I love being a witness I love when people see you and not me oh god I struggle like everybody else Lord like Paul said there are times I would do good and I find myself doing just the opposite how so many times I get discouraged with me not you know you might ever-present help in a time of me you're my rock of ages' Lord you buy water when I'm thirsty my bread when I'm hungry father I just wouldn't even know what to do without your father keep me keep me hide me in your clips of your rocker hide me in their secret place of the stair hide us Jesus because that's what we need Lord we living in such an evil time means are lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God trucebreakers and all of that father help us cheese us keep us Lord if that's a kind of glory we love you Jesus and we appreciate you bless your people give these young men a special blessing I don't know what all you're doing with them but I know you have something special for them each and every one of them Lord you've got something special for them I know it's all I can see it don't know what it is but I know it will make manifest what you have in store keep them strong father may they continue to unite and let nothing come between them Lord bless them Lord in your name Jesus Christ we pray bless this church in Jesus Christ's name we pray oh how I love Jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
