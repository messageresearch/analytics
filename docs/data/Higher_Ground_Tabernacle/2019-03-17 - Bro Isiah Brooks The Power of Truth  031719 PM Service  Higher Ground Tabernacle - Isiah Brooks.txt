John 3 2021 from there we'll go to Matthew 13 Hebrews 13 and 8 reads Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever that means we're serving a god that cannot change st. John 3 he told Israel hear ye o Israel I am a God that change is not he is who he is amen you love the Lord st. John 3 2021 for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God one more scripture Matthew 13 Matthew 13 beginning at the 10th verse and the disciples came and said unto him why speaketh thou unto them in parables he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given for whosoever hath - excuse me for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath therefore speak to them in parables because they seeing see not hearing they hear not neither do they understand and there and in them is fulfilled the prophecies of Isaiah excuse me which saith by hearing ye ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive let us pray Lord Jesus we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us this morning father we come as humbly as we know how realize Lord God that we are so unworthy within ourselves there's nothing or God that we could present to you this morning that would give us any kind of merit but because of your grace and because of your love because of your Holy Spirit Lord you have accounted us worthy and therefore we are accepted in you lord I pray hallelujah I pray this morning that you break and destroy the yokes of the enemy that you give us eyes to see and ears to hear and are hard to repent we ask these things in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated glad to have everybody this morning at one point in time I thought church was going to be half empty but you know I think God for your pressing your way out anyway I believe in worship I really believe in giving God my all I may not be able to achieve that every time but I do believe in giving him that understand when we do come to church we come to church to worship we come to church to fellowship and to hear from God this is where God has placed his word we realize Amen this morning that I've just been troubled and so many things has been going through my mind when God gave me this message I like to preach this morning the power of truth the power of truth we are living in what we call an erotic age where everybody's nerves seem to be taking advantage of them and they are insane most of the people are insane according to the men of God for the hour he said that the bride of Jesus Christ will be the only one that will have sanity people are insane you know a lot of people that are Christians are insane I I'm insane but in the right way I am I'm crazy about Jesus but there are those who are insane because they know and they have heard truth but they figure they have so much time or whatever I don't know what the issues are but I believe we are living in the last days I believe that almost all of the prophecies are have taken place and absolutely the bride of Jesus Christ could take a rapture at any given time we're living in a time where right is called wrong and wrong is called right most people say they want truth but truth is something else you know hmm when it comes to truth it's not always what you think it should be truth is God truth is like a hidden treasure you know it's very hard to find matter of fact the Word of God said few be that find it think about truth when we talk about truth truth holds everything in perspective it never changes no matter how much we change it never changes it will always remain the same because God is truth we declare that we are in this message we declare that we know truth but truth is not something that largest in your head is resting place is in the heart until truth lodges in the heart you really don't know it in other words that which is in your head can be taken away from you but when is in your heart it cannot be taken away the world today is in chaos the families is in moral decay why because when truth is rejected then people alone know who they are and are given up to their own beastly desires without truth people forget or just do not care who they are and then give themselves over to all kinds of affections that are against the nature you can find that in Romans 1:26 and 27 if there ever was a time for truth it is today truth came to us 2,000 years ago in the person of Jesus Christ don't you know the world have heard that name for thousands of years and many have not come to recognize that Jesus Christ is truth he is the truth of God outside of the first Adam he was the second Adam and we realized that Jesus Christ is the kind of man you and I are supposed to be he is true the Bible said in the the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwell in him oh we've heard this all that was in God he poured it into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured it into his church therefore Holy Spirit because there's only one Holy Spirit and when the Holy Spirit comes into a believer he becomes the incarnated Christ on come on somebody and collectively you and I collectively with the power of God in us we become omnipotent ah come on and when to UM impotence meet something has to happen that's why even when we come to church and I see such up stillness or deadness or starchiness I know that there is something wrong somewhere we have not been feeding off of truth enter his gates with Thanksgiving interest courts with praise that's true because you recognize and then they you have come amen to assembly where the Living God is going to show up I don't know about you but I just don't want the pillar of fire and then above the prophet's head i want the pill a fire to come and be seen among us I've seen it I'm a witness of it but people of God when God when we decide within ourselves that we want to see the manifestation of truth we will decide in ourselves Amen that we must be united and we must be one there will be a people in the world of chaos that will know who they are that's true they can be told truth even if it hurts and then believe it and they will act upon it hello I said again people who are up truth can receive truth even if it hurts they will hear it and then act upon it hallelujah truth will always remain the same the truth is when God saw you and I we were sons and daughters of God truth I'm not a beast I'm not just an animal I am a son of God and so are you if you feel with this Holy Spirit is that right listen no matter I'm coming to something in just a moment no matter where and what you do you should always tell the truth when you fail to tell the truth you are allowing yourself to engage with trouble if need you even if you believe a lie you are embracing trouble so why are you going with this brother Brooks because I want you to understand the Bible said Jesus Christ was full of grace and truth truth in itself stands alone majority of the people do not follow truth truth is only found by a minority search the Scriptures the majority has always been wrong whether it be sinner or the so-called Christian think about it when Satan came to even Adam as a serpent what did he do he broke truth and he presented Allah and that is why we are living the way we're living now because of a lie is that right say God will not you will not surely die if you break the Word of God you will not surely die and that's what the devil is telling a lot of us oh you can do it the way you want to but if you break the word you will die truth never changes the only reason why we're not lying laying in the graves aware is because of grace with God have unmerited favor toward us because of election because he chose us you didn't show choose God God chose you it is okay you know you must understand that truth is not given to everybody since the fall Amen God does not give truth to everybody hello he highs truth from some and reveals it to others you understand me and you say well what do you mean brother words what are you saying I'm saying this Bible is truth from cover to cover it is the true Word of God and the Bible says that heaven and earth will pass away but the word of the Lord shall stand boom so if we're going to have eternal life we must stand on the word you know when you speak truth it'll get you in trouble truth will always get you in trouble hallelujah now you said what brother I'm a Christian and I tell truth all the time and I don't get in trouble well something's wrong somewhere because whatever you tell the truth somebody's got to dislike it somebody is going to disagree with you hallelujah and you must understand that you must tell the truth no liar we're entering to the kingdom hello no liar will enter into the kingdom till I say it again no liar will enter into the kingdom of God hallelujah I'm getting ready to go back to the fact that the kingdom of God is a mystery and only God can revealed that mystery you're Hibbing and most of the time you know God always set this Bible in such a way to knock theologians can figure it out they can have the doctors of divinity and still not know God study for eight years get that great degrees and still won't know God because the kingdom of God is something that is revealed is that all right you and I must understand that the truth has the scripture says according to st. John II will make you free see I know some of y'all don't know what truth is cuz hardly any of y'all have Amen the word when the word is true is a man the unloader has believers and don't you realize Amen that when you sit still and don't Amen the word you're not resisting me you're resisting God and that's truth don't expect to get nothing out of a service if you don't put nothing in it the chairs has a way of saying Amen better than some of these people truth shall make you free that right we are Abraham's seed that's what everybody says we are in Abraham see but and understand we've never been in bondage religious folks said to Jesus we are Abraham's seed and we never been in bondage talking to the word talking to God himself evidently they were under our illusion they were under a lie because Jesus could have gone all the way back in time and show them that even since the fall you've been in bondage not just a Jew the Gentile as well and whether we realize it or not and then when you cannot come in here and worship God you are in bondage we are please unfold your arms you and I must understand it meant that when you and I come to church and then we come to be free the Bible said where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty your body speaks that's the only reason why I'm saying it your body speaks you lockdown and you and I must understand by God's grace and then that we are here to be free how are we going to make a rapture do you think that God is going to dismiss everything is as all well they didn't live it but I love them anyway it's not going to be that way the power of the blood must make us live it and if you can't love me you cannot love if I can't love you I can't love God because God is love in this oh I'm getting ready to have a good time this morning see you because if the Sun who the Sun sets free is free indeed hallelujah you see I'm free at home I'm free when I'm out in the streets I'm free when I comes into the church I'm free my worship I'm just all worship now my worship it's not hinging upon nobody else I worship when nobody else is around I worship hallelujah help me Lord you see you and I must understand that we're living if we are the bride and I believe we are we just need to get rid of the trash we've got too much stuff in our lives and we must get rid of the trash because it is the trash that keeps us down hallelujah if you cannot come to church and get stimulated by the revelation of this word there is something wrong with you you can be a rich man a poor man a beggar man thief but if you drink the natural wine it's going to stimulate you and the Word of God amen quicken is the stimulation when that revelation strike you on who you are listen I am free the devastate urine bodies I told him tell him I am free hallelujah whom the son make free I like mate is the word that means to construct or create hallelujah set free means to put lay or stand you know I set is over there but when I make something I'm creating it he creates me free hallelujah he creates me free not that's truth hallelujah think about it God has always you're not living in a time where the delusion and the deception is so great we've got thousands upon thousands of Christians going to church thinking they're going to make a rapture and most Christian can't even take correction how dare you most Christians don't like you to tell them the truth but if you're born of truth you love to even if it hurts you love it because that's what you are all about my momma used to tell me because I know every child would lie sometimes my mama when she lives she says you know if you lie you steal and she was telling the truth if you lie you will still buy it just doesn't stop there the devil just doesn't let you do one Shin think about it I want to bring you the truth of Adam and Eve misplaced one word broke one word by believing a lie and look where the fruits of that has placed us in this day truth is rare and this world is so mixed up and then they call it right wrong and wrong right a man don't know he's a man and a woman no no she's a woman now people think is their beast and they are without the Holy Ghost that's what you are and you're gonna do whatever you feel like doing if truth is not there hello this Bible is our guide line I was telling somebody the other day a friend of mine I was talking to I said don't you know that a football game got lost a football game got rules you you can't just do what you want to do in football and expect to win you got boundaries you can't run all the way up into the bleachers get to the goal line you can't do it baseball has rules regulations things that will make you a better athlete y'all know what I'm saying that's why God had rules to make us better Christians oh come on somebody it's true the woman at the well she had been taught all kinds of things this woman a man no doubt was a backslidden Christian of some sort and she was at a place Amen where she was coming in the evening Amen to get a drink of water and who was there Jesus see one thing about truth is this if you were in the mind of God from the foundation of the world you will be with him he will find a way to catch up with you no matter where is that hallelujah I've heard of people getting saved in a nightclub cuz a backslidden Christian witness to see God knows what he's doing he said I have I have never lost one the thing that's really shaking me in minutes because I see the time I see when we're living 1963 go 1957 indictment and look at us now this ain't just the United States it's all over the world and people who are called by if you don't fight you will be left behind y'all better hear me if you don't press because the pressure is great but you realize what's been told us only a few he said maybe as many of them on one hand we'll make a rapture y'all hear me this is not playing trash it's about living it let me let me move on but here was this woman a man she comes a men and she's looking and she's coming to get a drink of water and here Jesus's woman go give me drink she's seeing that he was a Jew what's disturbed about him asking her for water because there was a segregation between the Jew and the Samaritan hello just like it is now everywhere you go there's racial walls everywhere you can be over there inherent in the narrow countries and they still got the same thing hallelujah after a while and to be skinny against that because that's the way the devil works he sees differences in people and he makes those differences laws and rules and the Bible said we are all of one blood I'm telling you knowing this message is not going to save you living this message saves you when I see the blood I'll pass over you it's the life in this message it's the life in this blood it meant that saves you not by what any man can both I've done this I've done that but have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe that power of God that makes a drunkard Amen a saint that makes a prostitute halt again that same one Amen there open the eyes of the blind is living here today I've seen it I've seen the dead raised twice I've seen cancer healed I've seen all kinds of miracles hallelujah but that just doesn't excite me the way it used to because I realized you can see all of that and still be lost the thing that excites me is when I see God taking control of me and producing faith producing virtue and producing knowledge and temperance and bringing me on up to a place where I cast out all fear because perfect love casts out all fear this okay Amen go get me the drink hallelujah jesus said if you knew stood before you you ask him ask me for a drink wanna go get your husband I have nothing she said he said you correct you've had five and the one you have is not your own hallelujah so what was he doing he was designing he was trying to let her see I'm more than just a man somebody help me here Jesus Christ was more than just a man but he was God manifested in the flesh and he's the same brother today as he was yesterday ha hallelujah that means he's doing the same thing he's always done but he needs somebody to believe it somebody to receive it is that right I wasn't just born to be a man but I was born to be a southern of God you've been born to be a son of God or a daughter of God this is what he says see that mountain over there if you say to this mountain be thou move and believe it and receive it that little mountain will move he put it there he said mountain because he knows only his kind only his kind will believe it in the natural mind you say well he was just being figurative he really didn't mean mountains he really saying well if it's a big problem no he meant mountain if he told Moses stretch out your rod and the Red Sea backed up hallelujah if the if they crossed the Jordan on dry land if he sad manner drop matter out of heaven to feed millions he meant mountain but where's the faith the Bible says when the Son of Man comes shall he find faith that means deep faith the faith that was once delivered unto the Saints that faith that believed that Jesus Christ is God and will always remain God that faith that believed that Jesus Christ imparted his own Holy Spirit into the believer and they have become his body somebody help me here because no man have seen God until he see God in you you can't we see the great picture see we're not just worms crawling around somewhere we are the attributes of God this thing is no mistake or some happening like some evolution all those evolutionists people if they just would tall's for a moment to think they'll realize how ridiculous they sound to think that you came from a Polliwog a tadpole where did the tadpole come from hallelujah like somebody said if there was a big bang two big old rocks coming together whatever they were where the de rocks come from and what made them a marvel I'm marveled at comets those comments that's been in the air in the sky how long has been they've been there and having lost speed at all they still going and going and going huh every year they come around about the same time and nobody knows where the motor is wow it's God behind it if God can keep a rock afloat evening where there is nothing but space what about you and I we need more to God than the rocks but he said if you don't praise me I will cause the rocks to cry out absolutely hallelujah see we're like a byproduct created beings by holy wedlock did y'all know that that when you receive the Holy Ghost it's a wedlock with God you married to him from that point on you are his wife hallelujah that means if I'm the wife of God I can't act the way I want to act I just can't do the things I to do I must be the wife of a holy God so everything I do and must do must be a compliment to him and his character I'm gonna say it again everything that I do and must do must be a compliment to his character did y'all know that in the Old Testament when King Ahaz aura a man called for his wife Bess died she was beautiful huh she was one of the prettiest women if not the most beautiful woman in that in that Kingdom but guess what she had bad character huh is that truth she wanted to show herself off instead of Christ instead of the king you understand me she wanted to show herself off and because she would not come when the King called her he divorced her he got rid of her hallelujah but there's a one little young girl by the name of Esther and Esther could care nothing about appearance other than what she knew the King light see that's what I'm saying we dress according to the way we know the King liked it hallelujah it's not about me it's all about him is that right r-truth and you and I must understand that if we dressed to call someone to lust it is not the Holy Spirit it is the devil because he is the one that causes people to lust hallelujah we supposed to be in his likeness in his unity in the perfect image of the Living God because we become sons and daughters not separated but the same spirit same God the same person join in well up to the Eternal Spirit right hallelujah see how God planted in had that he we should not be a different but him not some other being of some other try but a real union in offspring of the Almighty God that after truth we're supposed to be that way we supposed to be pressing into it Lord I'm not there yet but help me that's all I'm saying God help me grow up into you my brother from California called me yesterday cuz he's a very tall handsome man even in the 70s and when I was a boy they used to say you look just like your brother so it made me feel really it makes me feel really good because I knew he was a good-looking fella and I'm thinking you know I'm looking like him you know it's okay and all of a sudden my jeans kicked in my daddy jeans and my whole and if you saw pictures of what I look anyway my jeans kicked in anyway my brother says at what age he says he's yesterday and what age did you you you turn into your your father's image I said I don't know but I did realize I was looking different now I'm saying this because my genes dictate it to me on what I was going to look like and we had a good anyway it's a long story but the point is there's no way to get out of it that's why you gotta be born again if you're born again you've done just what God wants you to do and when the life of God begins to grow in you it will form and shape you into the very image of God because that seed in you is the seed of God nobody can stop it somebody help me here God doesn't give back to image ah immature babies every child of God goes through its full term hey somebody help me here that's how it is with God don't get discouraged don't let the devil make you feel like you is you oh how can I say it it's not that power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord don't come and track feeling condemned into his gates y'all understand what I'm saying don't come in here feeling down because you realize when you get here you better to get here you got here and the victory is yours hallelujah you love the Lord on the day of Pentecost when that Holy Spirit came down and broke up to 120 pieces feel the house where they were sitting I don't even know how the chairs worth feeling but you know they had to feel the presence I don't know see what we don't realize that even trees feel the presence of God the leaves clap their hair hallelujah when that breeze come by you know I love to see perishing I love to hear them sing right cuz they don't care whether you like the music or not they go up and down and no they just have a good time and look like they think you bother them when you disturb them don't you see me praising God why are you bothering me hallelujah and that's the way we ought to be in service forget about everybody else it's between you and God Oh Lord I don't even know I keep going there but my point is Amen this is true truth is in the cap hallelujah the king is in the camp and when the king is in the cap there's a lot of noise hallelujah there is somebody don't let him make you starchy not at a time like this none of us are perfect all of us make mistakes but thanks be to God that we have been accepted is that beloved it's not the power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord truth shall make you free and he whom the Sun is set free it's free indeed is that right Paul say don't even go back into the yoke of bondage hallelujah I know we want to live right but don't let the devil just condemn your minds and so because you make mistakes somebody help me here because if you let him condemn you you are entering back into bondage I'm not worthy none of us are this is the grace of God I'm talking about this is truth hallelujah and because I understand this grace and I know that His grace has personally been given to me you must know that hallelujah ha the Bible says into the straight gate for wide is the gate broad is the way that leads to destruction and many there be which go in thereat now I'm going to say some things think about all the mega churches out here that's the broad way everybody that goes to the church really goes there to be saved I'm not saying they're not saved but I will say this as long as they remain there they will not make a rapture hello the word must be unadulterated it must be pure it cannot be manhandled you understand me you and I must understand that's why God said according to Revelation come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sins yah him because what you you said Oh what when you see the fruit that's what kind of tree it is hmm now I'm gonna say this but Strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it now have you found it have you found it hmm think about it you could have been out there most of us was out there but you see it wasn't a preacher the way he preached that drew me to Christ it was something in the inside that when he would preach I heard truth it was the truth that set me free I can say all these things I can tell you you justified before the foundation all I can tell you elected in all these things but let me tell you something until that becomes a truth to you not in your head but in your heart you are to be the manifestation of the word that Malachi 4 preached manifested manifestation of Luke 17 30 manifestation of revelation 10 7 hallelujah is that all right God cannot lie how many I believe that the Bible said he swore by himself Abraham I'ma make this thing happen who Abraham and Sarah oh and God said you gonna have a baby whoo a granny is gonna have a baby oh grandma but he didn't tell him everything because he wanted to see how much they could believe what he told him see God don't tell you everything God will just tell you how faith believe what I said and I bring it to pass we didn't know he didn't know I'll say laughs you know just like some of us right now we're laugh in the sense because we said Lord I'm in such bad shape I'm old high in the world I'm gonna produce Christ hallelujah hey man another problem says why did Sarah laugh she said no I didn't she said yes you did you lied and God would have killed her right then but because she was Abraham's wife hallelujah how many times we made mistakes how many times we have lied don't tell me you haven't oh yeah I'm a Christian I ain't never lied you lying now you might have to go back and straighten it out brother Brooks have you ever lied since you've been a Christian amen the Holy Ghost get you say no go make it right hello but God cannot lie he doesn't make that kind of a spits mistake now in God chose you and elected you before the foundation of the world how can you be lost you know what the thing about it is sometimes we think that Satan got an upper hand Satan don't have the probably God said when we weakest Saint get down on his knees the devil tremble and I told the Lord the other day I says Lord I'd rather be the weakest Saint on earth than to be a non-believer hmm yeah happy though I'd rather be the weakest one then they say I don't believe it because even in my weakness huh I'm strong is that Alright it's the truth the truth is in Jesus Christ he said if you believe on me as the scripture have said out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water that is the truth that's why you can't happen to be happy sometime that's why the joy overflows because you believed on him and that water is flowing out of you living waters that means you have already passed from death unto life you know you think about Jesus brought such a truth to the Pharisees today hated him because all he did was believe in law well this is dissing dissing don't you know if you judge by the law you will be judged by it hello that's the truth I'm approving to you by the scripture they brought that woman caught in adultery and said Lord she should die we caught her in the air now here's Jesus Christ full of grace and truth he's the judge he's looking at the whole crowd and if he gets to ride on the ground huh and he said unto them let him who's who is without sin cast the first stone hmmm yes somebody anybody here without seeing the Bible said if you say you've not seen you make him a liar there's somebody somebody all come on some don't you know that even if you can't believe you or not you God as a heel if you can't believe that God can heal you you you you make him a liar God said you're healed heal me Lord you healed you're already healed I healed you two thousand years ago you are ready he'll see the devil hit me with a sickness or hit me with an affliction Amen but I know I'm healed he can't hold me there brother he can't hold me there because I know I'm healed my brother says seem like it every two years you get afflictions up go hey I said yeah it seemed to be a pattern there like something going on I said I told my wife y'all need to get prepared hallelujah it's okay I'm not afraid of death folks y'all got to know that I'm almost done I'm almost done I went a little longer than I intensive clinic but my let me move on the move on here because caught in adultery now and he writes on the ground and all the people leads all of the accusers the Bible says from the eldest to the youngest and says Jesus turned to the woman woman where is your accusers oh I go back to I go back to Isaiah 54 no weapon formed against you shall prosper hallelujah and that the day of judgment of whom he was the same one that spoke through Isaiah now he's making manifest this woman is guilty but she's mine hallelujah and that's the truth hallelujah we all are guilty but we belong to Jesus Christ hallelujah and no matter what the devil try to put on us in this day nothing hallelujah nothing is gonna home nothing is going to stay because he said woman where are your accusers she says I have nine and he says neither will I go your way and sin no more that's the truth do you think that latest at all he let me free I really believe she went hoses she said I want y'all girls to know I working with y'all Onan on the night shift but I don't change my occupation holiday Amen well what doesn't happen to you I want you to know I was caught the other night those Pharisees caught me and they brought me before men called Jesus hallelujah he's a different man he's not like the Pharisees he's not like the Sadducees he's a different man hallelujah I believe he's a messiah because when he set me free I've been feeling free every since woo and evidently Mary was there somewhere hallelujah she was there and she heard about it and she heard that she here was Jesus that same man that set her girlfriend free it's now sitting in Simon's house and she says now let me go see what's going on down here cuz whatever it is I want some of it and she goes down to Simon's house and she peeks through the through the crowd and she see Jesus over there with dirty feet they didn't welcome him you know that's how it is the Holy Spirit comes in the church and they don't welcome him no more folks are ashamed of him they don't like the loud the shouting the crying whatever that comes with it they don't like it no more they want to be sophisticated they want to be you know how among the uppity ups a lot of people holiday me but all I do is I feel a little bit I jerk a little bit hey man because I want you to understand she's now somebody told her something she said but I don't see what didn't welcome y'all know the story she runs and she goes get her alabaster box she buy take all her prostitution money and she goes and by the the most expensive box she didn't come didn't go to the ten cent store huh no sure she wanted the best they had and that's what I'm saying when you come to church give him the best oil you can give it hallelujah she started from her head Haman down to his feet and she began to kiss his feet and whop why she's feet without hair ooh I'd love to see somebody get out of control like that somebody somebody I don't need to need to wash the feet of Jesus hallelujah we come up in here and we act like we you know even the Catholic gives a little bit more they go there and kiss the statues they do their rituals I'm telling you they have my movement in action than what we have shame on us that's one thing about a Catholic when they believe they believe they earnestly believe hello and when you get one um that's earnestly believe in you mind will forget it then hear and nothing else hmm they're dedicated you can't tell me they ain't dedicated they're dedicated not all of them but they're those that are are and if at any time they make Jesus Christ their Savior God will meet them but if they think the church getting them somewhere hallelujah oh come on somebody if you think this church right here is going to take you somewhere you are sadly mistaken only Jesus Christ has the power to say he is God I'm just trying to present him I am a priest hallelujah I am a preacher and I'm preaching his word that you must take it unless receive it that's Christ in spirit form that's what changes us I have nothing to do with it I'm just being a vessel of him he is a man help me Lord I'm almost done hallelujah yeah I'm just gonna end there you and I must realize we're living at a time we got whoa Lord we're gonna be held accountable people I'm telling you with all of this word that we have and we're setting down and I think to myself how many people you witness to now you can't make them come but you ought to have you have you ought to be I don't care somewhere you ought to be witnessing to the people you can't be afraid of them and you can't be ashamed of them you're in the same of what you have humor and you know what listen I want to tell you about Jesus he is my Savior and I just love him and I would tell you you better keep that whatever that is I don't want it cuz you ain't happy knowing you're not even happy about it so why why do what I believe that you got something I don't already had come on somebody when Jesus set that woman free she ran into the city come see a man who told me oh oh she was so excited one woman in her testimony converted a whole city people love excitement is that the truth even when it's perverted man I went to that that are a concert the other night oh oh they tow it up day ya know how'd it go he said what man what did they do see they got your interest by their excitement then you want to go yeah you gotta give yeah how can you resist that kind of excitement I'm coming they're sinners you get somebody I'm telling you you can get somebody listen that's exciting you get a Christian that's really excited about being a Christian you become like a magnet people are gonna be drawn to you I know what I'm talking about do y'all really think that we just come here to say we came to be a witness a witness a newborn witness right is more to Christianity than just attending church and I'm sorry I told the Lord I says Lord I said if I've ever had in the jealousy I've never never desired to be a prophet or anything like that but I am I said Lord the relationship you had with the Prophet I do get jealous not in a bad way but in a good way you said I'm saying look at Paul even Paul says I am a prisoner of Christ how many of us can say that today that was an intimate relationship to Paul was so in love with Christ he could not disobey Him even when it came to being whooped and beaten and shipwrecked and wherever the angel call says don't get off the ship it's gonna wreck what you bought you stop you know most of us say Lord is that you don't get all if you get off the ship your dodj stay on the ship it's going direct but everybody will be saying that's when you bind when you are so connected with Christ it meant that you can hear him and know that it's his voice he said my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow listen I'm saying this in closing whatever and I the rest tonight whatever you do try to stay as truthful as you possibly can and if there are things in your life that you have lied about you need to make them right it might hurt but it'll do you good you love the Lord there were so many things I couldn't even hardly sleep last night and this morning I've been thinking about this message I said lord I don't know how you're gonna do it because there's so many things it could have been broadened so many things that have been coming to my mind and my heart not on just to preach but to me to me to me you know one thing I do not I do not want to be someone who deceives himself hello ain't no using you saying you got the Holy Ghost that if you don't see the fruits of it mmm I'm not saying you're not a tree that can bear it but you got to have it and you ought to see Christ somewhere in your life even in your failure you need to see Jesus my thoughts is by God's grace don't denied truth we're not see people said well brother books aren't you a Christian yes but we're not like everybody else and what I'm preaching is not local this is a universal message and God has preaching the same message all over the world everybody's got their little just like you had Matthew Mark Luke and John they all preach their angle of the message but when you put it all together it brings in one beautiful picture that's what people need to start seeing it ain't number one picture or one portrait and that portrait is Jesus Christ himself lest an Oh [Music] wonder-working power in the prayer [Music] there is wonderful there is wonderful power [Music] [Music] [Music] you know I want to say here there's not one person in here that I don't love as a as a as a pastor I I'm the one that has to see and when I see spirits that's what I hit spirits I just know that if you give God the right protocol you can get whatever you want from here the scripture tells us how to do it scripture tells us exactly how to get God's attention if you really want God's attention let's elevate your praise let's elevate your worship let's tell him even in the midst of trials I'm gonna praise you I'm gonna trust you you gonna get his attention there Alleluia is that right those Hebrew boys amen when they were thrown in a rock before they was thrown in the fiery furnace no doubt they prayed and didn't even get an answer forgot from God but they said to that King whether he answered me or not I'm not bowing to that image hallelujah and I'm gonna tell you something People of God amen we're gonna find out one day that G it is true that God inhabits the praise of his people we allow the enemy hit us too hard and we take what he says and if we could just listen to the gospel of Jesus Christ like we listen to what Satan tells us we'll be a pretty good people most of us anyway God loves us he didn't put us in this age to punish us he did not put us in this age to embarrass us he put us here amen because he knew that we was the answer to the devil's question you can overcome this aid now because he made us overcome it's in you it's already there like I said stir that sugar up from the bottom make the kool-aid sweet again that's all we need to do amen amen amen when I rose this morning I didn't have no I knew that [Music] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Music] I trust victory is yours come brother oh what a mighty God we serve surely victory is ours there's a lot I wanted to say but God only said what he wanted to say [Music] let's sing this last song in the sweet bye and bye there's land that is fairer than day and by faith we can see the far for the father what's over the way to prepare us it really miss their
