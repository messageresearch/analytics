[57:29] seconds
[57:35] to the message
[57:42] Hallelujah that place of rest
[57:47] as the quote goes
[57:54] to eat the children of Israel
[57:59] amen amen and they were supposed to
[58:01] follow Moses
[58:05] and Moses saw the lights
[58:11] what I'm trying to tell you is that that
[58:15] same pillars

[1:20:52] by
[1:21:02] my experience
[1:21:12] hmm
[1:21:14] because people are in the message
[1:21:17] they think they got it they think they
[1:21:19] got the Garment on them
[1:21:23] but you need the Holy Ghost comments
[1:21:27] when they came the master of the
[1:21:29] ceremony came in
[1:21:31] and he asked the man how did you get in
[1:21:33] here
[1:21:40] when they came through the door they
[1:21:44] were all given the same road
[1:21:49] is that right amen the Holy Ghost is
[1:21:53] given to everybody
[1:22:00] but a lot of people sit right in here
[1:22:05] they know what to do they know how to
[1:22:08] dress
[1:22:15] have you received it
[1:22:17] you received the Holy ghosts free
[1:22:22] foreign
[1:22:39] God has become too common to you
[1:22:42] is that right
[1:22:44] so what happens when the Morning Star
[1:22:46] goes
[1:22:47] right and the sun began to shine again
[1:22:56] because that morning star that he was
[1:22:59] there till
[1:23:00] coming of the Lord
[1:23:03] light of the sun
[1:23:08] ready to shine
[1:23:17] during that time in Isaiah
[1:23:20] they laughed at the Watchmen
[1:23:23] they say well you know he's too much
[1:23:29] gloom and doom message
[1:23:31] and the whole time
[1:23:37] cry out against sin
[1:23:41] everything that was wrong
[1:23:57] when the prophet God was here in America
[1:24:03] they laughed at him
[1:24:05] when he came to the word
[1:24:08] so he had lost his mind
[1:24:11] no that when he was killed in that
[1:24:14] accident Community
[1:24:17] felt like God it was was that was
[1:24:21] retribution
[1:24:23] but they didn't understand
[1:24:25] they didn't understand what was going on
[1:24:28] but let me say it like this
[1:24:31] we must move forward we have been in
[1:24:35] this place too long
[1:24:38] and let me tell you like this even
[1:24:41] though he's given us a land
[1:24:45] for every interview
[1:24:50] I want that Perfection
[1:25:05] not the Giants
[1:25:13] but you're allowed to get in your way
[1:25:36] that's right
[1:25:38] right right how many people I've been
[1:25:42] trying to get their relatives
[1:25:45] and it had not come to pass
[1:25:47] see that's a miracle brother same here
[1:25:50] and I'm just saying I'm just saying God
[1:25:53] has a way of doing things

[1:26:10] designing
[1:26:21] you know what I tell people tell them to
[1:26:24] go down to the Border

[1:28:47] evil as the person doing the evil
[1:28:53] Hallelujah let me move on by the grace
[1:28:57] I'm a jump song I'm a jump okay
[1:29:00] now we got to move on and I'm gonna see
[1:29:03] and this is where I'm going with this
[1:29:06] I was already spoken on that part
[1:29:10] what is your inheritance
[1:29:14] what did God leave you see
[1:29:18] as an inheritance
[1:29:22] one of the things that
[1:29:24] the Lord spoke to the children of Israel
[1:29:28] we're not just to live in Egypt
[1:29:35] [Music]
[1:29:36] and let me say it like this
[1:29:38] we know the land exists
[1:29:41] because we had a Joshua
[1:29:44] came back he said I've been there he
[1:29:49] didn't just bring back grapes but he
[1:29:52] brought back the report
[1:29:54] that your theophany was over there
[1:30:01] now I don't know how good that's the
[1:30:04] best way you could do it he said man for
[1:30:06] something you can talk about grapes I
[1:30:08] love grapes The Grapes don't excite me
[1:30:10] but when you talk about another land
[1:30:14] will you tell me that when I died
[1:30:18] when you tell me I cannot die
[1:30:32] don't worry about these fleshly Falls
[1:30:57] [Music]
[1:31:15] [Applause]
[1:31:17] if you continue to not know who you what
[1:31:21] your inheritance is
[1:31:24] I've got a big mansion for you
[1:31:27] we got to use a better place than
[1:31:29] California over in Florida well I'm
[1:31:31] sorry
[1:31:35] and they kind of give you a vision of
[1:31:39] what it looks like
[1:31:41] and you said over here in a two-bedroom
[1:31:44] house
[1:31:45] and over here you got four to five
[1:31:47] bedrooms
[1:31:55] your hand and the faucet turns on I mean
[1:31:58] come on
[1:32:00] well I'm not ready to move today
[1:32:05] today
[1:32:08] right let's let's let's make this thing
[1:32:11] happen
[1:32:12] soon as possible well see that's the way
[1:32:15] I'm looking at Heaven
[1:32:17] oh somebody I'm looking at my Heritage
[1:32:22] Hallelujah I'm looking in see if you're
[1:32:25] not my age you don't even know what I'm
[1:32:27] talking about
[1:32:29] wake up with pain
[1:32:33] you say you shouldn't confess it is true
[1:32:39] and I call on the name of Jesus
[1:32:41] and it gets better he said
[1:32:46] but there are times some people don't
[1:32:49] suffer those things but something
[1:32:52] and every time I think about a pain
[1:32:55] think about how close I am to death
[1:32:58] it's coming y'all know that I was
[1:33:03] telling somebody my whole point is to
[1:33:05] bring you to a place
[1:33:13] I don't care how rich you get here
[1:33:18] if you don't have Jesus Christ
[1:33:29] Jesus Christ
[1:33:37] this is not been this is not about I
[1:33:39] don't know how come I'm preaching this
[1:33:40] way but somebody
[1:33:43] your heritage
[1:33:47] and the blood is being applied
[1:33:50] not the natural blood but the life of
[1:33:54] the blood which is the Holy Ghost
[1:33:57] Hallelujah he said what about a Heritage
[1:34:02] connects you to
[1:34:04] to whatever that God has left for you
[1:34:10] I I I I know in America
[1:34:12] you may have a family
[1:34:15] and they may own a big piece of land
[1:34:20] nobody can just buy that land
[1:34:23] without the family's signature
[1:34:27] everybody in the family
[1:34:30] sign the paperwork
[1:34:36] one person can't do it in person
[1:34:53] because it would take the blood of Jesus
[1:34:58] but he's the one who gave it to us
[1:35:04] now you say what do you mean because
[1:35:07] you're my inheritance I have a vision a
[1:35:10] vision that was given to me
[1:35:13] because that's the way it is when you
[1:35:15] own something
[1:35:23] Hallelujah
[1:35:32] brother random said I saw them there
[1:35:35] were Millions
[1:35:37] running toward me
[1:35:39] and every one of them was saying
[1:35:45] he said they were young they have no
[1:35:49] wrinkles
[1:35:56] Hallelujah
[1:36:01] that's what Paul said
[1:36:04] miracle
[1:36:25] most of my family die young because
[1:36:30] my mother had 16 children my mama says
[1:36:33] on phone
[1:36:34] and only three of us are living
[1:36:37] because we all die young in the 40s
[1:36:43] right my brother just that just passed
[1:36:46] before he made history
[1:36:50] did you don't know that this is the last
[1:36:53] three to four months relatives
[1:37:05] is
[1:37:06] it's in your family too
[1:37:08] it's in your family
[1:37:11] nothing Remains the Same
[1:37:15] but the thing that really caught me with
[1:37:17] my knees
[1:37:20] but I'm not sure she knew Jesus
[1:37:25] she's a nice young girl
[1:37:29] but I don't know I don't know if she
[1:37:33] knew the Lord
[1:37:34] grieved me so much I got the heart
[1:37:37] coffin
[1:37:39] thought about it
[1:37:50] do I understand what I'm saying
[1:37:53] I don't know what our inheritance is
[1:37:56] but I know mine and yours should be the
[1:38:00] same
[1:38:01] God gave Israel promised land
[1:38:09] where the streets are paved with gold
[1:38:12] Hallelujah
[1:38:19] you don't need a water filter
[1:38:23] [Music]
[1:38:28] I I I don't know about y'all but I said
[1:38:30] like this I'm almost done but I should
[1:38:33] take you another hour because you're
[1:38:34] gonna stand out there for another hour
[1:38:38] you're gonna do it
[1:38:43] it's the truth
[1:38:45] you know and I'm not trying to be funny
[1:38:47] but my pain is folks what is the this is
[1:38:49] what if you should let's say like this
[1:38:51] what if all the law should come right

[1:39:24] when when you were when you inherit when
[1:39:26] we have an inherited we we also have
[1:39:30] let's put it this way inheritance could
[1:39:34] be passed or future or future is that

[1:40:03] but I'm the short guy
[1:40:05] and I used to pray to be taller
[1:40:08] but I inherited this shortness
[1:40:12] right but I'm not sure to some people
[1:40:17] I have a daughter
[1:40:23] you know but she inherited that
[1:40:27] you know and I I think about
[1:40:30] um
[1:40:31] um when I was younger I looked like my
[1:40:35] mama
[1:40:36] and my mama was a good looking lady
[1:40:39] and then one day somebody said to me
[1:40:43] more like your daddy
[1:40:48] well that wasn't a compliment to me
[1:40:52] but what can I do about it like this
[1:40:54] could spin on family it was inherited
[1:40:59] now I would love that somebody say to me
[1:41:04] bro the way you look the way you going
[1:41:07] all I can do is see your daddy Jesus
[1:41:14] Hallelujah but those things are
[1:41:16] inherited messages
[1:41:21] is that right
[1:41:25] so you say well what do you mean
[1:41:27] sometimes people are wealthy and they
[1:41:30] inherit buildings and the foreign
[1:41:37] to the people that is inheriting these
[1:41:40] things
[1:41:42] for the most part it means nothing
[1:41:47] because when the person dies
[1:41:50] they sell everything to the shoes
[1:41:54] you hear what I'm saying but the P to
[1:41:57] the person who owned it
[1:41:59] down
[1:42:01] everything to them because they kept
[1:42:05] people
[1:42:07] but to the person who's who who life
[1:42:11] wasn't into that yeah
[1:42:15] I hear what I'm trying to tell you you
[1:42:18] happy you have inherited
[1:42:21] the greatest thing that you could a
[1:42:23] person could ever have
[1:42:28] and everything that comes with it
[1:42:34] what however you treat it
[1:42:38] yeah I hear what I'm saying people will
[1:42:41] sell it out
[1:42:43] things of the world
[1:42:49] always be a daughter
[1:42:52] but don't when we get to heaven
[1:43:01] [Music]

[1:49:36] that I want you to idolize me
[1:49:41] I preach on this common level
[1:49:45] um because there are no great ones Among
[1:49:48] Us
[1:49:51] I'm
[1:49:52] but because I say that doesn't mean you
[1:49:55] got a right to disrespect me
[1:50:01] you understand me
[1:50:05] that's why brother I said call me

[1:53:23] of Jesus that's why we need forgiveness
[1:53:25] that's why we need crime
[1:53:30] and so none of us being that and also
[1:53:33] none of us at each other
[1:53:37] will be different from your fault
[1:53:40] we still have thoughts
[1:53:43] right one might lie the other one might

[1:59:35] [Music]
[1:59:36] wrote on the back wall with with
[1:59:41] markers

[1:59:56] you allow them to go back there and tear
[1:59:58] up

[2:00:21] cause you're more than welcome
[2:00:25] whether it be by physical labor or
[2:00:27] something
[2:00:33] that was not free
[2:00:37] um
[2:00:38] don't
[2:00:40] let your children go back there without
[2:00:42] supervisions Elizabeth
[2:00:45] that is not the children's playground
[2:00:49] we don't have deacons or anybody to help
[2:00:52] you control
[2:00:56] you must take take uh initiative to make
[2:01:02] sure you know where your child is
[2:01:08] right
[2:01:09] so we did Miss Bible study
[2:01:15] we're not going to be putting on the
[2:01:18] line
[2:01:19] we're not having Bible study noon
[2:01:22] I know I said I wasn't going to say
[2:01:24] nothing but
[2:01:25] yeah if the if it if you don't get a
[2:01:29] text saying Bible study is canceled
[2:01:35] that means you'll be having Bible
[2:01:38] studies
[2:01:40] now we're in the process of doing a few
[2:01:44] changes
[2:01:56] and I said like this is to the teachers
[2:02:00] or the instructors there is you know
[2:02:03] you're not going to be here
[2:02:06] and I'll teach the children
[2:02:08] but we need these children to be taught
[2:02:13] the word of God
[2:02:15] it's important they be taught
[2:02:18] God will hold us
[2:02:24] all those things being said
[2:02:30] just just uh
[2:02:33] [Music]
[2:02:35] allow the Holy Spirit to direct you oh

[2:03:38] themselves
[2:03:39] to be captured by our Antichrist spirits
[2:03:44] and when you don't listen
[2:03:46] even when you know it's the truth right
[2:03:54] because that's exactly what Cain did
