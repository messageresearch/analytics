[1:00:06] seated I would uh like to entitle this
[1:00:11] message
[1:00:13] empowered by his
[1:00:18] grace the one thing I love about this
[1:00:22] message it gives every individual
[1:00:27] a reflection of
[1:00:30] themselves uh when you look into the
[1:00:35] word you you're going to see yourself as
[1:00:37] a
[1:00:40] Believer or
[1:00:43] nonbeliever or just a
[1:00:45] sinner or a make
[1:00:48] believer however the word strikes Your
[1:00:52] Heart by way of Revelation
[1:00:57] that is who you
[1:00:58] are you understand
[1:01:00] me I have heard in Prior
[1:01:06] times
[1:01:07] how this brother was witnessing to
[1:01:10] another
[1:01:13] brother and he gave the brother one of
[1:01:16] brother bram's
[1:01:20] messages and this one brother said I
[1:01:24] don't like that kind of pre
[1:01:28] preaching he called me a
[1:01:33] buzzard and then that brother
[1:01:37] responded it's
[1:01:39] amazing when I heard the
[1:01:42] message he called me an
[1:01:45] eagle see it's your
[1:01:49] perception of this
[1:01:51] message will determine what you do
[1:01:56] if you know this message has been
[1:01:58] ordained by you excuse me ordained for
[1:02:03] you you will do your best to walk
[1:02:08] thereby you understand what I'm saying
[1:02:11] and I hope this
[1:02:13] morning the Lord will give us Grace to
[1:02:17] see that every
[1:02:20] chain everything that has you have you
[1:02:23] in bondage
[1:02:26] those chains have been
[1:02:28] broken over 2,000 years
[1:02:32] ago but as long as you don't know
[1:02:37] that Satan has a right to keep you in
[1:02:44] bondage his
[1:02:46] grace is what empowers
[1:02:49] me it gives me the strength to go
[1:02:54] on it gives me that that inner uh uh
[1:02:57] confidence and
[1:03:00] strength to never think about
[1:03:04] quitting it gives
[1:03:06] me a stand alone
[1:03:12] power that if my mother don't go if my
[1:03:17] sister don't go if my brother don't
[1:03:21] go any real it doesn't
[1:03:24] matter I'm going all the way to see
[1:03:31] him it's amazing how we spend so many of
[1:03:35] our years in this
[1:03:38] message can I say it like this dying for
[1:03:46] approval
[1:03:47] appr you know we want
[1:03:51] somebody to accept
[1:03:54] us but I'm here to tell you everybody's
[1:03:58] not going to accept
[1:04:00] you matter of fact God has ordained
[1:04:03] people in this
[1:04:06] church to reject
[1:04:11] you God put them here for
[1:04:13] that to see how you would
[1:04:17] react understand me good and
[1:04:21] evil all things works together for the
[1:04:26] good of them that love the Lord those
[1:04:29] who are the
[1:04:31] call you understand me those who are the
[1:04:37] call you understand every many are
[1:04:41] called but few are
[1:04:44] chosen but in this message there is De
[1:04:49] call
[1:04:50] individuals who know they have been
[1:04:52] called by God to live this
[1:04:58] and when you have that understanding of
[1:05:00] that
[1:05:01] Revelation Nothing Stops you from going
[1:05:06] forward we have this
[1:05:09] religious thing that we want to be
[1:05:12] accepted
[1:05:17] religiously but if you've looked around
[1:05:20] most of the people here don't care about
[1:05:22] what about your religion
[1:05:27] Hallelujah now the thing about it is
[1:05:30] religion is a
[1:05:32] covering it's not
[1:05:35] salvation and some of us we we know how
[1:05:38] to place a
[1:05:42] facade you know uh uh wanting everybody
[1:05:46] to as I go back to the to
[1:05:51] acceptance but we're not here to be
[1:05:54] approved by each other
[1:05:57] we're only here to be approved by
[1:06:01] God sometimes we do
[1:06:05] things Works which are good
[1:06:08] works but whenever you do
[1:06:10] works in the church to impress
[1:06:15] someone your works are in
[1:06:19] vain hallelujah hallelujah we work in
[1:06:22] the
[1:06:23] church as servants unto the
[1:06:27] Lord
[1:06:29] hallelujah I had a
[1:06:31] son I still have a son he's a grown man
[1:06:35] now but he and his uh uh uh buddy used
[1:06:39] to get up and do a a a Duo a
[1:06:45] du and one day he came to
[1:06:48] me and said Daddy you know I believe I
[1:06:51] sound better than so and
[1:06:53] so when we sing
[1:06:57] and I told him this you'll not sing
[1:07:03] again this is not a time of
[1:07:08] competition and to be honest with you
[1:07:10] the other guy sound better than he
[1:07:14] did but you see that's what people
[1:07:17] do instead of coming to worship God they
[1:07:20] compete each other
[1:07:27] y know it's
[1:07:28] true there's a lot of
[1:07:31] competition somebody want a better car
[1:07:34] some want better house some want better
[1:07:38] clothing God don't care about
[1:07:42] that what God cares about is a
[1:07:44] surrendered
[1:07:48] heart I don't care how fancy your car is
[1:07:52] I don't care how fancy your your house
[1:07:55] is
[1:07:56] we are all sinners saved by
[1:08:01] grace
[1:08:04] Hallelujah in this
[1:08:07] age you must understand
[1:08:11] Grace Grace is not
[1:08:15] disgrace
[1:08:17] Grace is that he's had
[1:08:21] favor and he's given that favor to you
[1:08:27] right you don't earn
[1:08:30] favor favor is something it's a choice
[1:08:33] in which God
[1:08:35] made like brother brand said you didn't
[1:08:38] CH choose him he chose
[1:08:41] you that's what favor
[1:08:44] is y'all know how that is if you got
[1:08:48] sisters and
[1:08:49] brothers somehow the parents always have
[1:08:52] a
[1:08:53] favor or a favor
[1:08:57] y'all look at me like let's not be
[1:09:00] Hypocrites y'all know that's
[1:09:03] true is that
[1:09:05] biblical
[1:09:09] absolutely right Joseph was
[1:09:14] favored Benjamin was
[1:09:17] favored y'all hear me what I'm saying
[1:09:19] when Jesus was on
[1:09:21] Earth John was favored
[1:09:26] and let me show show you understand
[1:09:29] God has
[1:09:32] favored hallelujah hallelujah and you
[1:09:35] must come to
[1:09:36] recognize that you are
[1:09:39] [Applause]
[1:09:42] favored of
[1:09:44] God see when you're favored of
[1:09:47] God you don't have to beg him in
[1:09:52] prayer all you got to do is him in
[1:09:57] prayer is that right because he is the
[1:10:01] supplier of your
[1:10:04] need oh my God you don't have to work
[1:10:09] it in order to get anything from
[1:10:13] God the favorite of
[1:10:16] God knows the
[1:10:18] scripture whatsoever you ask in my
[1:10:23] name believing that you shall receive
[1:10:27] it it is
[1:10:31] yours see that empowers
[1:10:34] me and as long as you approach god with
[1:10:40] work trying to earn his
[1:10:44] favor you won't get
[1:10:50] it maybe you haven't had a ordeal like
[1:10:53] this before
[1:10:56] but being a
[1:10:57] pastor you always have those
[1:11:00] people who wants to you to have them as
[1:11:03] a favor
[1:11:07] favorite and they just do things for
[1:11:11] you nothing's wrong with that nothing's
[1:11:13] wrong with that but my point
[1:11:16] is what people fail to
[1:11:19] see that a true
[1:11:21] Christian favors all Christians
[1:11:27] all Christians are the favorite of a
[1:11:30] Christian oh come on somebody it's the
[1:11:32] truth
[1:11:34] in let me move on I didn't mean to stay
[1:11:36] there that
[1:11:37] long this is the age of
[1:11:41] adoption this is the bride
[1:11:43] age this is the age of
[1:11:47] transformation moving from justification
[1:11:50] to
[1:11:52] sanctification to the baptism of the
[1:11:54] Holy Ghost
[1:11:55] to the complete statue of
[1:11:58] Christ Hallelujah to that man that God
[1:12:01] can
[1:12:04] adopt understand me and only those who
[1:12:08] have been chosen by
[1:12:10] God we'll be able to accomplish
[1:12:14] it not by their
[1:12:17] works but by his
[1:12:19] grace yall understand me because these
[1:12:24] people chosen before the foundation of
[1:12:27] the
[1:12:28] world Hallelujah to be the bride of
[1:12:34] Christ and y'all must understand with
[1:12:38] all that brother brandham did with all
[1:12:39] that he
[1:12:41] preached he knew and he tried his best
[1:12:45] to to to make the people
[1:12:47] see it's about Jesus
[1:12:51] Christ it's about his word
[1:12:55] so much so that his whole entire
[1:12:59] message fell under the theme only
[1:13:02] [Music]
[1:13:04] Bel if you only
[1:13:07] believe all things are
[1:13:11] possible he's not talking about
[1:13:13] believing in your
[1:13:14] head he's talking about a
[1:13:18] revelation that's in your
[1:13:21] heart that makes you know what has been
[1:13:23] spoken
[1:13:25] [Music]
[1:13:27] is the
[1:13:30] truth the grace of God was sent to this
[1:13:36] generation and only the favor favorite
[1:13:39] of
[1:13:40] God or Those whom God
[1:13:44] favor will have eyes to see
[1:13:49] it
[1:13:50] right God gave us in this message and un
[1:13:58] Covenant right
[1:14:01] only the true bride of
[1:14:04] Christ will be
[1:14:06] able to understand
[1:14:09] that right it's not only good to hear
[1:14:12] the word but you and I must come to
[1:14:16] understand what it
[1:14:18] means
[1:14:20] Hallelujah you're you're how can I say
[1:14:23] moving forward
[1:14:27] is determined by your revelation of
[1:14:32] Grace because Grace bring you
[1:14:36] power Grace makes you stop looking at
[1:14:40] you it makes you start looking at
[1:14:44] God hallelujah Grace gives you
[1:14:49] victory over every
[1:14:53] enemy what if David would have
[1:14:57] said Lord you know I haven't been a good
[1:15:00] Christian I've done my
[1:15:03] best but should I fast before this
[1:15:08] giant should I go into an all night
[1:15:12] prayer see grace gives you
[1:15:18] identity Grace will reveal to you who
[1:15:21] you
[1:15:22] are Hallelujah
[1:15:25] right it's like it's like when God
[1:15:28] identified
[1:15:30] Peter when Peter said to Jesus Thou Art
[1:15:33] the
[1:15:34] Christ and then the Christ said Thou Art
[1:15:37] Peter see that's how the word
[1:15:40] responds when you say oh my God this
[1:15:43] message is
[1:15:45] true it responds yes you a
[1:15:50] bride hallelujah hallelujah all right
[1:15:54] coming from the
[1:15:56] message no let me move on I think I read
[1:15:58] that already let's go to St
[1:16:02] John 6
[1:16:10] 3739 I know some people have gone to a
[1:16:13] wedding or
[1:16:17] something I heard that a few people are
[1:16:19] out
[1:16:21] sick but I hope by some way they they're
[1:16:24] listen listening uh uh to this message
[1:16:27] this
[1:16:29] morning I haven't gotten where I'm going
[1:16:31] but I want everybody to see
[1:16:37] this how are you going to overcome if
[1:16:39] you don't believe the
[1:16:42] word if you don't believe the word can
[1:16:44] do it how you going to
[1:16:47] overcome and God will take some of the
[1:16:49] most difficult
[1:16:51] situations and put it in your life
[1:16:56] and say speak to this
[1:17:01] mountain but if you don't believe it see
[1:17:04] you can speak to it but that mountain
[1:17:06] won't
[1:17:08] move it's amazing how the mountain
[1:17:11] respects
[1:17:15] Faith you hear what I'm saying because
[1:17:19] you you believe that the Bible said the
[1:17:21] whole
[1:17:23] creation grown amen and waits to see the
[1:17:28] manifestation of the sons of
[1:17:32] God God has ordained the
[1:17:35] creation to be able to
[1:17:39] recognize a true son and daughter of
[1:17:44] God hallelujah and when those Sons and
[1:17:47] Daughters of God
[1:17:49] speak it doesn't
[1:17:53] matter what it is
[1:17:56] it has to
[1:17:59] obey I I believe it that
[1:18:04] way St John
[1:18:07] 6:37 I believe I read it all that the
[1:18:09] father giveth me shall come to
[1:18:12] me and him that cometh to me I will in
[1:18:16] no wise cast
[1:18:18] out now you your brother I came to the
[1:18:21] word he said come to me
[1:18:26] and when he said he's speaking about
[1:18:28] that he's speaking of the anointing the
[1:18:31] Holy
[1:18:32] Ghost the Baptist got the word Methodist
[1:18:36] had the
[1:18:38] word however but we talk about the
[1:18:41] Living Word we talk about the word of
[1:18:44] the
[1:18:45] hour if you come to me I will in no wise
[1:18:50] cast you out the Pharisees had the word
[1:18:54] some Sadducees had the
[1:18:57] word but Jesus was the Living
[1:19:01] Word am hallelujah hallelujah and
[1:19:04] whether you realize it or not you are
[1:19:07] writing a
[1:19:08] script with your
[1:19:13] life and guess what in that you writing
[1:19:18] with your
[1:19:20] life God don't leave nothing
[1:19:23] out
[1:19:25] am he didn't leave it out for the
[1:19:28] Jews and he's not going to leave it out
[1:19:30] for
[1:19:31] you right but he said listen and so
[1:19:35] that's what Grace gives you once
[1:19:38] receiving the Holy Ghost and this is
[1:19:40] where I'm working with I'm talking about
[1:19:43] this doesn't even apply to you until you
[1:19:46] get the Holy
[1:19:48] Ghost potentially you're
[1:19:51] bride but God must VIs
[1:19:56] Vindicated and he vindicates it by
[1:19:58] giving you the Holy
[1:20:00] [Music]
[1:20:02] Ghost
[1:20:04] Hallelujah you know that's the truth
[1:20:06] right that's how you know weat before
[1:20:09] from
[1:20:10] tear at the
[1:20:13] harvest wheat bow their
[1:20:18] heads but in
[1:20:20] Harvest the tear stands up pridefully
[1:20:25] they look
[1:20:27] alike until it's harvest
[1:20:30] time that's when the two
[1:20:34] separate by way of their
[1:20:38] character hallelujah hallelujah I came
[1:20:41] down from
[1:20:43] heaven not to do my own
[1:20:46] will but the will of him that sent
[1:20:50] me hello somebody we say that when it
[1:20:53] comes to Jesus Jesus but why did you
[1:21:00] come what why did you
[1:21:05] come did you come to live your own
[1:21:08] life no there's only reason one one
[1:21:12] reason why you
[1:21:13] here you were born to manifest the word
[1:21:18] you were born to glorify God you were
[1:21:22] born to live for God
[1:21:25] in this lay the C and
[1:21:32] age hallelujah hallelujah and this is
[1:21:36] the Father's
[1:21:37] will which have sent me that of all
[1:21:41] which he have given
[1:21:43] me
[1:21:45] I I should lose
[1:21:48] nothing but you rise it up
[1:21:52] again at the last day
[1:21:55] Grace gives you a
[1:21:58] revelation that you are one of
[1:22:01] them let me say it again cuz some of
[1:22:05] y'all still struggling you know why
[1:22:07] you're struggling I won I won't say you
[1:22:10] you're not
[1:22:11] Christians but I will say that you're
[1:22:14] stuck you're stuck in your
[1:22:18] religion Hallelujah you're trying to
[1:22:21] approve or get
[1:22:23] approval when you fail to see that God
[1:22:25] has already approved
[1:22:28] you Hallelujah you want God to accept
[1:22:32] you but you fail to see that you're
[1:22:35] already
[1:22:37] accepted let me tell y'all something I
[1:22:40] love that story on Joseph and I listened
[1:22:42] to it a little bit this morning it was
[1:22:45] wonderful Joseph started
[1:22:48] out you know just in a terrible place as
[1:22:50] a as a a
[1:22:52] sheep keeping sheep
[1:22:55] not much to that but he was
[1:22:59] ordained for a
[1:23:02] powerful
[1:23:05] position in
[1:23:08] Egypt I believe that and I believe that
[1:23:11] every True Believer of God of this
[1:23:15] message we're not we're not
[1:23:18] Pentecostal we're in The
[1:23:21] Headstone we're bride
[1:23:24] we we have a covenant like no one
[1:23:28] else but you got to believe your
[1:23:31] vision yall understand me brother Bram
[1:23:34] didn't come to give you a vision for you
[1:23:37] not to believe
[1:23:39] it right oh you say wait a minute wait a
[1:23:41] minute because Joseph had to
[1:23:45] believe the dreams that he was
[1:23:48] receiving he had to believe that what he
[1:23:50] was seeing came from
[1:23:53] God Brothers called him
[1:23:56] crazy but because he
[1:23:59] believed persecution came and let me
[1:24:03] tell you like this when you come to a
[1:24:05] revelation of who you are you can't help
[1:24:09] but tell
[1:24:11] somebody and let me say it like this
[1:24:14] when you start boasting and bragging on
[1:24:17] Jesus you're going to be
[1:24:20] persecuted even by your own brothers and
[1:24:23] sisters the
[1:24:26] house
[1:24:28] Hallelujah I'm the only one in my
[1:24:30] family family that believe this
[1:24:34] message I had to leave my family because
[1:24:37] they didn't want to have nothing to do
[1:24:39] with
[1:24:39] me you you're insane I got one brother
[1:24:45] left living and he won't have nothing to
[1:24:48] do with
[1:24:49] me but let me put this I don't I'm not
[1:24:52] looking for sorrow or pity
[1:24:55] I'm so
[1:24:57] glad to be able to
[1:25:00] see I'm so
[1:25:03] glad that's why I couldn't help but to
[1:25:05] cry this morning I I I was so
[1:25:08] full because I see the grace of
[1:25:12] God for this
[1:25:14] man and nothing can
[1:25:17] nobody can take it
[1:25:19] away it's something God has given me
[1:25:24] and guess what Grace does it takes away
[1:25:28] all the
[1:25:32] fear it takes fear you don't fear man
[1:25:36] you don't fear the government you don't
[1:25:38] fear
[1:25:40] nobody nothing you don't fear
[1:25:44] demons come on somebody I was at a
[1:25:47] church not long ago and we were praying
[1:25:49] for somebody and the brother had an
[1:25:52] issue and here was a
[1:25:55] Pastor afraid to
[1:25:58] pray and that fear was just bouncing off
[1:26:00] of
[1:26:01] me and I thought to myself here's a man
[1:26:04] of
[1:26:05] God afraid to
[1:26:07] pray cuz he's afraid of a
[1:26:10] demon when you are afraid of a demon
[1:26:13] that means you're lacking the Holy
[1:26:15] Ghost cuz great is he that's in
[1:26:19] you come on somebody when brother
[1:26:22] Brandon was young and that woman was
[1:26:25] possessed with a
[1:26:26] devil and how she crawled on her
[1:26:29] back he ran from
[1:26:33] her because he didn't fully
[1:26:36] understand but once that Prophet
[1:26:39] regrouped Hallelujah once that devil
[1:26:43] spoke and said we have nothing to do
[1:26:45] with you will
[1:26:47] bre that devil exposed
[1:26:50] himself Hallelujah that little prophet
[1:26:54] that became that was running from a
[1:26:56] devil became the Giant Slayer Hallelujah
[1:27:01] he prayed in
[1:27:03] faith because he believed what God told
[1:27:07] him Hallelujah if you get the people to
[1:27:11] believe no devil will be able to
[1:27:14] stand before you y'all hear what I'm
[1:27:18] saying if you believe this message the
[1:27:21] way you want
[1:27:23] to will be able to stand before
[1:27:27] you hallelujah
[1:27:31] hallelujah glory to
[1:27:34] God where we fail is to
[1:27:38] see Jericho walls had to come
[1:27:41] down it had a time period
[1:27:44] though walk around seven times y'all
[1:27:48] hear what I'm saying every promise of
[1:27:50] God hallelujah has a time period
[1:27:54] and you got to wait on God and wait for
[1:27:58] God but you never
[1:28:00] disbelieve Hallelujah is that right job
[1:28:04] said I'm going to wait till my change
[1:28:07] come he wasn't afraid he knew the change
[1:28:11] was going to
[1:28:12] come I got to wait but while I'm waiting
[1:28:17] I'm going to praise God
[1:28:24] is that all right accepting your
[1:28:27] grace and accepting your position in
[1:28:31] Christ you said brother Brooks I don't
[1:28:34] have the Holy Ghost it ain't God's
[1:28:38] fault he said repent and be baptized in
[1:28:43] the name of Lord Jesus Christ and you
[1:28:45] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:48] somebody help me here so let me say it
[1:28:50] like this if you ain't got to keep
[1:28:53] waiting on it
[1:28:55] but what you need to do is said Lord you
[1:29:00] promised Hallelujah you promised
[1:29:04] me now you can't get the Holy Ghost if
[1:29:06] you didn't bring forth
[1:29:08] repentance because repentance come
[1:29:11] first you can be baptized a thousand
[1:29:14] times in the
[1:29:15] water but if you don't don't
[1:29:18] repent you still you go down as a wet
[1:29:21] sinner or you go down as a dry sinner
[1:29:24] and you come up as a wet
[1:29:26] one that's the trth but when you
[1:29:31] repent you know even the prophet of God
[1:29:33] said it like this if a person truly
[1:29:36] truly repent when they
[1:29:39] baptized God is obligated to give them
[1:29:43] the Holy
[1:29:44] Ghost right
[1:29:47] there hallelujah hallelujah you love the
[1:29:50] Lord see once once acts 238
[1:29:54] become a religion to
[1:29:56] you oh I got to do it to be accepted no
[1:30:01] no no you won't get nothing and you
[1:30:03] won't get
[1:30:04] nowhere you got to come the way they
[1:30:07] came you got to repent and be baptized
[1:30:11] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:30:14] remission of your sins Hallelujah I'm
[1:30:17] here to praise him this
[1:30:19] morning I'm here to praise him for what
[1:30:23] he's already done for
[1:30:25] me hallelujah it's not if I'm going to
[1:30:29] get to heaven I'm already there it's not
[1:30:32] if you're going to get there you're
[1:30:33] already there Hallelujah and what we
[1:30:37] need to do is get into the grace of God
[1:30:40] and let the grace of God Empower you
[1:30:44] give you the strength give you the joy
[1:30:48] because of the word speaking on your
[1:30:52] behalf Hallelujah
[1:30:55] Hallelujah you know what if a man was in
[1:30:58] jail and he's been there for what 20
[1:31:03] years and somebody comes and bail him
[1:31:06] out
[1:31:09] Hallelujah when he hear the
[1:31:11] news it's going to shock
[1:31:14] him the next question is who is this
[1:31:19] person hallelujah hallelujah said when
[1:31:22] you get out of the gate he'll be
[1:31:23] standing in
[1:31:25] there you understand me that's how it is
[1:31:28] with
[1:31:29] Jesus Hallelujah once like a
[1:31:33] birdon i y'all know how to listen it's
[1:31:37] God who set me
[1:31:39] free it must be God who set you
[1:31:43] free I was talking to somebody
[1:31:46] yesterday I said people talking about
[1:31:48] inheritance
[1:31:51] demons all of us had them
[1:31:54] you inherited being a
[1:31:57] sinner you didn't want to you you came
[1:31:59] here as a
[1:32:01] sinner you inherited from Adam and
[1:32:04] Eve Hallelujah but because I inherited
[1:32:09] that doesn't mean it has to
[1:32:12] remain Hallelujah because once you give
[1:32:16] your life to
[1:32:18] God I don't care what that inheritance
[1:32:21] brought through the bird line
[1:32:25] has to
[1:32:27] go but it'll never work for you if you
[1:32:29] don't believe
[1:32:30] it think you got to work God for it to
[1:32:33] get it you won't get it if I I I got to
[1:32:38] give something to make him favor
[1:32:40] me you are
[1:32:42] blinded blinded by religious
[1:32:46] Works Hallelujah the work has already
[1:32:49] been
[1:32:50] done Jesus Paid It All
[1:32:54] y'all hear what I'm saying but your
[1:32:56] grace is saying you're
[1:32:59] free I don't care if it's high blood
[1:33:01] pressure I don't care if it's
[1:33:04] diabetes I don't care if it's
[1:33:06] blindness Whatever It
[1:33:09] Is God is the
[1:33:13] solution let me ask you a question do
[1:33:16] you really think when it's time for the
[1:33:19] rapture we going to be sick and
[1:33:23] afflicted
[1:33:25] no brother Bram said he saw it
[1:33:28] Hallelujah he said limbs will be growing
[1:33:31] back yall understand me every every
[1:33:36] Affliction God is going to take care of
[1:33:40] it has already taken care of it but the
[1:33:44] bride must reach that Faith
[1:33:47] level and only way we can reach it we
[1:33:52] must understand
[1:33:54] it's not by power it's not by mind but
[1:33:59] it's by my spirit say the
[1:34:01] Lord and as long as the devil can keep
[1:34:04] you
[1:34:05] believing that you have not been
[1:34:09] blessed because of your
[1:34:11] failures you are
[1:34:14] imprisoned because when are you going to
[1:34:16] live a holy
[1:34:17] life a holy enough
[1:34:20] life for God to accept you
[1:34:25] impossible imposs now I'm not talking
[1:34:28] about people going out here living any
[1:34:29] kind of way doing any kind of way I'm

[1:45:53] more
[1:45:54] minutes job
[1:46:06] 31:15 those of us who are
[1:46:10] healthy we have no idea how blessed we
[1:46:12] are
[1:46:25] when I first moved to Lima excuse me
[1:46:30] Iowa I would I would run about nine
[1:46:33] miles a
[1:46:36] day 4 and a half in the
[1:46:39] morning and 4 and a half in the
[1:46:45] evening then as I got got
[1:46:48] older it it dropped down to about three
[1:46:51] and a half
[1:46:54] and now it's at
[1:46:56] zero but I do
[1:46:59] walk and I'm grateful that I can walk y
[1:47:02] understand me as you get older things
[1:47:07] changes and I said
[1:47:09] Lord I love
[1:47:11] running and sometimes I see those fellow
[1:47:14] running and I basically want to get out
[1:47:16] that doors and run
[1:47:19] too but I said Lord I want to keep my
[1:47:22] knees
[1:47:24] I don't want no knee
[1:47:26] replac so you let me know when I run
[1:47:29] long
[1:47:30] enough and once you show me that I'll
[1:47:33] stop
[1:47:34] running like I used
[1:47:37] to and he did just that you love the
[1:47:41] Lord I'm almost
[1:47:43] done job
[1:47:46] 31:15 be did not he that made me in the
[1:47:51] womb make him
[1:47:53] and did not one fashion Us in the
[1:48:04] womb when some of you have heard me say
[1:48:07] this before when you in the womb you
[1:48:12] don't need your
[1:48:13] hands when you're in the womb you don't
[1:48:16] need your eyes when you're in the womb
[1:48:20] you don't need your feet why
[1:48:23] your mother is your
[1:48:26] hands your mother is your
[1:48:29] eyes your mother does everything for
[1:48:32] you can I say it like
[1:48:34] that when you in the
[1:48:37] womb or when you're a new
[1:48:40] Christian and you you you've just been
[1:48:44] begotten is that Pastor that brings out
[1:48:47] the word for
[1:48:49] you he feeds you
[1:48:52] to Eagle is that
[1:48:55] right but you must
[1:48:57] understand he is feeding you like a
[1:49:01] mother would feed her baby when when
[1:49:03] when it's in the
[1:49:06] womb and she's going to eat healthy and
[1:49:08] she possibly
[1:49:10] can because that baby is being prepared
[1:49:13] for another
[1:49:15] world you understand me and that's what
[1:49:18] the pastor must
[1:49:20] do he's not interested in this world
[1:49:23] he's interested in the world to
[1:49:25] come so he gives you the material the
[1:49:28] food that you
[1:49:30] need Hallelujah to break into another
[1:49:34] dimension or Another World right because
[1:49:38] remember now the bodies that we have
[1:49:42] now fashioned in our mother's
[1:49:46] womb was fashioned for this
[1:49:49] world you understand me so the body that
[1:49:53] we're to to to
[1:49:56] obtain the theophany the glorified body
[1:50:01] is a body from another world you
[1:50:04] understand me and what we're using
[1:50:07] here we use things like our mouth and
[1:50:10] our
[1:50:12] eyes to touch and to feel you understand
[1:50:15] what I'm trying to say brother brandom
[1:50:17] said we'll travel like a
[1:50:20] thought all you got to do is think about
[1:50:24] it Hallelujah and understand the
[1:50:29] supernatural no
[1:50:31] Dimension will be able to hold
[1:50:34] us we'll be able to walk from one
[1:50:36] dimension to
[1:50:39] another is that the word when Jesus was
[1:50:43] resurrected he walked through the
[1:50:47] door hallelujah hallelujah and the Bible
[1:50:49] said our bodies will be fashioned like
[1:50:52] him
[1:50:55] see what I'm trying to get you so
[1:50:58] understand if you fully understand your
[1:51:01] grace what God has given to
[1:51:04] you it will Empower
[1:51:08] you cuz as long as you think I can't do
[1:51:14] it you won't do
[1:51:21] it but you need to come to a
[1:51:24] place to
[1:51:26] recognize it's already
[1:51:30] done I I find it so
[1:51:33] amazing brother said he's going to
[1:51:35] prepare a place for
[1:51:37] us and he said you know what how it's
[1:51:39] going to
[1:51:40] be he said God knows everything one each
[1:51:43] and every one of us like
[1:51:48] like and he's building this
[1:51:51] Kingdom based on
[1:51:53] that you
[1:51:56] like yeah yall understand me so I Can't
[1:52:00] Hardly Wait
[1:52:02] myself let's move on I've got a few more
[1:52:05] few more scriptures you don't
[1:52:06] mind and then afterward I'm going to do
[1:52:09] a little talking okay Isaiah
[1:52:12] 43 1
[1:52:17] 2 but now thus say the Lord that created
[1:52:22] theee oh Jacob and he that formed thee
[1:52:25] oh Israel fear not for I have redeemed
[1:52:29] Thee I have called thee by thy name Thou
[1:52:34] Art mine
[1:52:46] [Music]
[1:52:48] amen when thou passest through the
[1:52:51] waters amen I will be with thee and
[1:52:56] through the
[1:52:57] rivers they shall not overflow thee and
[1:53:00] when thou walth through the
[1:53:02] fire Thou shalt not be burned amen
[1:53:06] neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee
[1:53:21] amen forget it we oh Lord I ain't worthy
[1:53:25] to do brother said
[1:53:28] everybody that came through the a prayer
[1:53:31] line with that
[1:53:33] attitude never got
[1:53:36] healed because the prostitutes already
[1:53:39] knew they weren't weren't
[1:53:41] worthy you understand me it was always
[1:53:44] Christian people call
[1:53:47] Christians that would literally cheat
[1:53:50] themselves away from God's healing
[1:53:57] you say I ain't
[1:53:58] worthy you tell the devil that's a
[1:54:02] lie he made me
[1:54:06] worthy I don't have to work on my
[1:54:09] worthiness you don't have to work on
[1:54:11] your worthiness he made you
[1:54:15] worthy accept your
[1:54:20] grace because that's the devil he uses
[1:54:22] that to defeat
[1:54:25] you every time he can get you to
[1:54:27] disbelieve
[1:54:30] something you defeated you defeated
[1:54:33] because only faith can please
[1:54:36] God faith has no
[1:54:39] reasoning faith
[1:54:41] is and if you don't have faith says Lord
[1:54:43] give me the
[1:54:45] faith to destroy this
[1:54:49] giant Hallelujah Isaiah 54 17 which is a
[1:54:53] favorite of
[1:54:55] mine
[1:54:59] done and it reads no weapon that is
[1:55:03] formed against thee shall prosper that's
[1:55:06] right and every tongue that shall rise
[1:55:08] against thee in judgment Thou shalt
[1:55:11] condemn this is the heritage of the
[1:55:15] Servants of the Lord and their
[1:55:18] righteousness is of
[1:55:20] me say the Lord
[1:55:24] amen
[1:55:35] hallu knowing who you are by the word
[1:55:39] this is why brother BR gave us a
[1:55:42] message he said us things that he didn't
[1:55:44] give to the
[1:55:46] denominations Hallelujah in his message
[1:55:49] he basically did God showed us who we
[1:55:55] were in the message the unveiling of God
[1:55:59] he wasn't just talking about himself he
[1:56:01] was talking about all of us who have
[1:56:04] been
[1:56:06] predestinated those of us who were with
[1:56:08] him before the foundation of the
[1:56:11] world Hallelujah and as long as you go
[1:56:14] the way you're
[1:56:18] going I don't know whether some of y'all
[1:56:20] mad or just sleepy

[1:56:26] this every attitude in this place is
[1:56:28] being
[1:56:31] recorded and so you understand if I'm a
[1:56:34] preach a message and you're mad with me
[1:56:36] I don't

[1:56:43] deal
[1:56:47] with y'all have no idea what I go
[1:56:50] through sometimes with spirits
[1:56:55] and I'm not calling no names I'm just
[1:56:58] saying Ephesians

[1:57:14] chosen Us in him before the foundation

[1:58:07] because hardship come God ain't in it
[1:58:11] God is in

[2:12:21] we're keepers of one
[2:12:24] another is that right I've had uh so
[2:12:29] many different
[2:12:31] situations come up in this
[2:12:33] church and it's been quite difficult for
[2:12:35] me to even
[2:12:38] judge but some of y'all know the
[2:12:40] situation I'm going to speak of I'm not
[2:12:41] going to call no
[2:12:43] name but we've got a a situation here
[2:12:47] where where a a couple want to divorce

[2:13:26] means you sat in this
[2:13:28] church as a fornicator or
[2:13:32] adulterer and now you telling me you got
[2:13:35] a way out there is no way

[2:14:01] could do about that I was a product of
[2:14:06] sin I'm a product of
[2:14:09] sin but my way out was to become a new
[2:14:14] Creature if you did that before you came
[2:14:18] to the message

[2:14:23] live but you're not bringing that in
[2:14:27] here I'm sorry if I find

[2:15:00] divorce you want to separate go ahead
[2:15:03] and do it but show me in the message
[2:15:06] where you can get
[2:15:08] remarried only under one condition and
[2:15:11] that's
[2:15:12] fornication you said for fornication and
[2:15:14] adult is the same it is not the same
[2:15:19] fornication is before you get

[2:17:41] table no clothing on my back yall

[2:17:44] [Music]
[2:17:46] saying and how there's no leverage
[2:17:49] people say well you know most most of
[2:17:51] the you know what God called
[2:17:53] you the Lord I just said like this I
[2:17:56] believe it was the Lord I won't put it
[2:17:57] on him but I just believe it was Lord he
[2:18:00] said you got rebels in your
[2:18:03] church people who are deliberately
[2:18:08] rebelling he said but just as I took
[2:18:10] care of the rebels in Moses
[2:18:13] day I take care of the rebels in your
[2:18:16] church so I want you to know something
[2:18:19] here I don't nobody I don't know about
[2:18:21] other people
[2:18:23] ordination I don't know what they've
[2:18:25] been called to do but I have a work here
[2:18:29] and that work will be
[2:18:31] completed if it cost my
[2:18:35] life and if it come to the place there
[2:18:39] only two or three here maybe my wife and
[2:18:42] a few others that's fine with
[2:18:45] me because I know
[2:18:48] Jehovah you know what and he's Jehovah
[2:18:54] so I'm not trying to be mean but I want
[2:18:57] to be forceful enough for you to know
[2:19:01] that those of you who knew this was
[2:19:03] going on and you have known for
[2:19:07] month nobody came to talk to
[2:19:13] me and y'all always wait till the Apple
[2:19:15] get
[2:19:18] rotten CU so bad till you say here fix
[2:19:21] it
[2:19:22] brother I don't know how to fix that
[2:19:24] that just deserve trash

[2:19:34] clear I don't mean no harm I there's
[2:19:37] some things I don't understand but it's
[2:19:38] not for
[2:19:39] me but I I'll say like this God
[2:19:42] understands
[2:19:46] everything and
[2:19:49] honestly some tells me that they're
[2:19:52] Brothers I don't know where you are here
[2:19:54] there I said now Lord I hope they ain't
[2:19:57] got a second wife then I went over there
[2:19:58] and got married
[2:20:03] again if you
[2:20:04] have you're not a part of
[2:20:09] this there's another church there's some
[2:20:11] Churches who believe in that I think you
[2:20:14] need to go Fellowship
[2:20:16] there and for those wives that you got
[2:20:18] to go through that
[2:20:19] craziness you said why would you say
[2:20:22] that we didn't know the truth at
[2:20:25] first we know the truth

[2:20:45] for the
[2:20:46] brother I love the brother my heart
[2:20:50] aches for for the
[2:20:51] brother because the brother should have
[2:20:53] come to his Pastor if I was his
[2:20:56] Pastor instead of going to instead of
[2:20:58] going to his
[2:21:00] buddies who encourag him to do that kind
[2:21:02] of thing he should have come to his
[2:21:06] pastor and let talk to me about it
[2:21:10] because I'm going to tell you something
[2:21:11] about a lust Spirit a lust Spirit
[2:21:14] doesn't have a
[2:21:16] face you understand what I mean that a l
[2:21:19] Spirit don't care if you white
[2:21:24] ugly a l Spirit don't care a l Spirit

[2:21:39] about
[2:21:41] Grace but there are lines you can
[2:21:45] cross when the word of God has come to
[2:21:48] us and we choose to cross that line you
[2:21:52] you I know brother Bram talk about
[2:21:54] polygamy and
[2:21:56] marri but he started off it wasn't so in
[2:22:00] the
[2:22:02] beginning and then he began to explain
[2:22:04] to us why God allowed certain
[2:22:07] things once the word has been
[2:22:12] restored we supposed to follow the
[2:22:14] restored
[2:22:19] word now I don't know I'm getting ready
[2:22:21] to
[2:22:23] close but I remember my wife telling me
[2:22:26] a little story she hope she don't mind
[2:22:27] me saying

[2:23:01] liberal I mean
[2:23:05] that and for those of us who have have a
[2:23:08] solid marriage if you've done it already
[2:23:10] that's you've done it I

[2:23:22] me that's understand y'all looking so
[2:23:26] sad like it's
[2:23:27] you but I'm I'm just saying at what
[2:23:30] point in time you going to start loving
[2:23:32] other people like you love
[2:23:35] yourself here I am trying to produce a
[2:23:37] rapt I'm not a Rapture trying to get
[2:23:39] people into into into that atmosphere of
[2:23:43] a
[2:23:46] Rapture Desiring for uh uh
[2:23:51] uh Desiring U

[2:24:02] away you see people come and you know
[2:24:05] they're not living
[2:24:06] right I'm not talking about I'm not
[2:24:09] talking about gossip and saying things
[2:24:11] that you know you know you seen with
[2:24:14] your own eyes you know that's what I'm
[2:24:17] talking about because your first
[2:24:19] obligation is to go to that
[2:24:21] person that person don't hear you you
[2:24:24] take another
[2:24:25] person if you take two people and they
[2:24:27] don't hear bring it to the church then
[2:24:30] the church WIll judge
[2:24:36] that we've got wonderful sisters
[2:24:39] here and I I want those sisters
[2:24:42] especially those that are not married
[2:24:43] yet I pray for
[2:24:46] you brothers too I pray for you I'm
[2:24:49] going to say it like this
[2:24:51] don't you
[2:24:53] marry anybody
[2:24:55] nobody I don't care if they in the
[2:24:57] message and they
[2:25:00] Millionaires and they don't have the
[2:25:02] Holy Ghost you better leave that
[2:25:06] alone you understand what I'm saying if
[2:25:09] you marry somebody unequally
[2:25:12] yolked you going to be
[2:25:15] [Music]
[2:25:18] miserable I don't care who they are
[2:25:21] it is the holy spirit that makes us
[2:25:24] one watch the
[2:25:29] doctrine people say oh we all in the
[2:25:32] message no we're
[2:25:34] not brother Brandon said Moab and Israel
[2:25:37] had the same kind of
[2:25:40] altars seven altars seven
[2:25:43] Rams didn't they he said but they were
[2:25:47] different it was ba ba
[2:25:52] baac that caused them to
[2:25:54] sin by saying oh we all the same we are
[2:25:58] not all the
[2:25:59] same and because people got all of this
[2:26:02] up in the front of their Church don't
[2:26:05] mean their message believe
[2:26:07] us am I am I preaching the
[2:26:11] truth if you think this makes you the
[2:26:14] message you ignorant forgive me for but
[2:26:17] that's wrong you like understanding
[2:26:22] the message is the Holy Ghost the
[2:26:24] message is not the
[2:26:27] pictures some people have become Idol
[2:26:32] worshippers y'all looking at me I'm on a
[2:26:35] road so I'm as well finish
[2:26:39] it the same brass
[2:26:43] serpent that brought healing to
[2:26:46] Israel because the people start
[2:26:48] worshiping him
[2:26:51] became an idol and God had to tear it
[2:26:56] down the only thing that can't become an
[2:26:59] idol in that way is Jesus Christ
[2:27:07] himself you got to think about what your
[2:27:10] children is going to go through you
[2:27:12] can't be so
