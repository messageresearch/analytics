[23:01] good time you know and and and you know
[23:05] I think Christ as just as good a time if
[23:09] not more than we do you know and the

[23:16] during services like that amen amen
[23:20] because he's one that created rejoicing
[23:23] amen that's right so a man let's just
[23:27] bow our heads in a word of Prayer before
[23:29] we get started
[23:31] Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord
[23:34] so much for being who you are father for
[23:37] the world that you have created father
[23:39] for the way is Lord that you have
[23:41] created us to be father Laura we do not
[23:43] sit and say why did you make me this way
[23:46] or why did you make me that way Lord
[23:47] because we know that you have done
[23:49] everything for a purpose father and that
[23:52] purpose Lord is perfect father and we
[23:54] and we just think you know we were Joyce
[23:56] and everything to you have done father
[23:57] and Lord as we gather again this evening
[24:00] father I pray Lord that you would just
[24:02] open up the word once more to us Lord
[24:05] and and bring a second blessing father
[24:07] another blessing to us or we're looking
[24:10] our eyes are towards the Father Lord we
[24:13] just thank you Lord so much for for
[24:15] coming into this
[24:16] place where two or three are gathered in
[24:18] your name Lord or we just we just love
[24:20] to be where your presence is falling so
[24:23] are we turn the entire service over into
[24:25] your able hands father and we open up
[24:27] our hearts and say Lord speak to us just
[24:30] now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray
[24:32] amen amen let's just open in our Bibles
[24:39] if you'll just let me pause for a second
[24:43] here and you remember where we were
[24:46] going it's one of those days were really
[24:51] seemed to struggle to find a certain
[24:53] place to go and and then right the last
[24:56] moment and also our coming together so
[25:04] let's turn over to John chapter 15 I
[25:17] want to speak today about Christ's joy
[25:22] amen do you believe the Christ had joy
[25:25] amen joy unspeakable and full of glory
[25:30] amen amen
[25:34] so John 15 will read there the eleventh
[25:38] verse and he says these things have I
[25:44] spoken unto you that my joy might remain
[25:48] in you and that your joy might be full
[25:53] this is my commandment that you love one
[25:56] another as I have loved you
[25:59] amen now let's go over to will stay in
[26:04] John we'll go over to John 17 verse 13
[26:18] he says and now I come to thee and these
[26:23] things I speak in the world that they
[26:26] might have my joy fulfilled in
[26:30] themselves amen let's just bow our heads
[26:33] once more in a word of Prayer
[26:35] Heavenly Father we just give these words
[26:37] over enjoyable hands father and ask that
[26:39] you would come down Lord it and bring
[26:42] out the meeting Lord you spoke them the
[26:43] first time Lord and we just pray that
[26:45] you would speak them once more here in
[26:47] our presence in the name of Jesus Christ
[26:49] we pray amen you can be seated
[26:52] amen Christ had joy you know I think
[26:56] that when Christ was here he was having
[26:59] a good time
[27:00] amen you know I was a it was a lot of
[27:04] work he did more than any man I guess
[27:06] had ever done he went through a lot of
[27:09] things amen and but yet for all that he
[27:13] had a joy that was set before him
[27:16] Hebrews chapter 12 verse 2 says for the
[27:19] joy that was set before him he endured
[27:22] the cross amen and then when he comes
[27:25] there and John he starts saying Lord I
[27:27] follow I pray that they would have my
[27:30] joy the same joy that's on the inside of
[27:33] me would be now on the inside of them
[27:37] amen so the joy that he set before him
[27:40] he followed that joy all the way to the
[27:44] cross amen and so that's really that's
[27:47] really how he got to the cross you know
[27:49] there's one thing is when when when you
[27:51] have a situation that you are enjoying
[27:54] so much when you're when you're into
[27:58] something you're doing something or in
[27:59] your certain situation in life and
[28:01] you're just really really enjoying it
[28:04] one of the first things you do is you
[28:06] look around for somebody to experience
[28:08] that joy with you know a joy really
[28:10] brings fellowship it really brings
[28:12] fellowship as soon as you start having a
[28:14] good time doing something then you
[28:16] you're gonna sure the world you'll be
[28:19] looking around for somebody who can I
[28:22] enjoy this with who can I share this
[28:24] with who can I fellowship with in the
[28:27] store and so was it with Christ Christ
[28:29] came down
[28:30] to this world and for the joy that was
[28:32] set before him he endured the cross when
[28:34] you started gathering you went by Peter
[28:35] come with me come walk with me and went
[28:38] he gathered twelve men he wanted to
[28:40] share his joy with these twelve amen but
[28:43] you know it didn't really stop there
[28:45] you know because Christ's joy he's still
[28:48] still to this day has a desire to share
[28:52] that joy with you amen so the same joy
[28:55] that he shared with those twelve
[28:57] disciples could have same desire that
[29:00] caused him to share with those twelve
[29:01] that same desire still is enduring in
[29:05] Jesus Christ
[29:06] think about it that same joy is still
[29:09] enduring inside of Jesus Christ and so
[29:13] as he is enjoying right now
[29:16] fellowshipping with you and me
[29:18] amen he said that he would go and
[29:21] prepare a place for you
[29:22] amen well he's having a good time
[29:24] preparing that place amen and he and his
[29:28] desire is is that you and me would
[29:31] commune with him day by day and share
[29:33] that joy with him amen you assess there
[29:36] in Luke 10 21 he said in that hour Jesus
[29:40] rejoiced in spirit and said I think the
[29:44] O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that
[29:46] thou has hid these things from the wise
[29:48] and prudent and it was revealed them
[29:51] unto babes even so father for a seemed
[29:53] good in thy sight it says in that hour
[29:56] Jesus were joist his spirit why why was
[29:58] he rejoicing because they were beginning
[30:01] to catch the vision of what he was
[30:04] trying to get across to them amen
[30:06] the very moment that the disciples the
[30:08] blinders start coming off of their eyes
[30:11] Jesus the Bible says he rejoiced in
[30:14] spirit why because there are blinders
[30:17] are coming off the disciples eyes and
[30:18] they're beginning to see the whole
[30:19] reason why he came amen and Jesus were
[30:22] Joyce and said oh I'm thank you O Father
[30:24] that you has revealed unto these babes
[30:27] such as would learn amen
[30:30] the joy that was with them I know time
[30:32] talks about joy is in Luke 15 5 he says
[30:35] talking about the shepherd then when the
[30:37] shepherd leaves the 99 and he goes after
[30:40] the one as soon as he finds that one he
[30:42] picks it up he throws it
[30:44] on his shoulders he goes off for a joist
[30:46] him because he found that one you know
[30:50] and you know the thing of it is there's
[30:52] so many times in life we don't we forget
[30:54] that Christ is having a good time that
[30:58] we forget that Christ has done
[31:00] everything that he's done for a very
[31:02] specific purpose for a very specific
[31:04] reason amen and we are not alone in this
[31:07] world
[31:07] amen and in Christ is still desiring to
[31:11] have the same fellowship with us they he
[31:14] had with the disciples that he slept
[31:17] with they're side by side in the boat he
[31:19] slept with side by side in the fields or
[31:21] wherever they were everywhere they went
[31:23] all they always went together wherever
[31:25] they were going they were going together
[31:27] those 12 disciples in him they he
[31:29] gathered them together why so he could
[31:33] enjoy this time with his people amen
[31:37] well that that desire has not left Jesus
[31:39] Christ think about that that desire has
[31:44] not left Jesus Christ he still wants to
[31:47] walk through and experience this world
[31:49] amen not now as he endures the cross but
[31:52] as you endure the cross think about it
[31:56] we are enduring we take up our cross and
[31:59] we follow him why for the joy that is
[32:02] set before us and are we alone in this
[32:04] journey
[32:05] no amen who's with us in this journey
[32:08] Jesus Christ amen and he's having a good
[32:11] time
[32:12] amen he's having a good time now the
[32:14] thing of it is it's hard to have a good
[32:16] time when when the problem the person
[32:18] that you're with is gloomy all the time
[32:21] right wait who you know if like when
[32:25] when Peter you know and he when he was
[32:28] doubt and all sudden Jesus said get thee
[32:30] behind me Satan you know or when when
[32:33] Peter is doubting on the ways he starts
[32:34] thinking you know you know Jesus was
[32:36] looking forward to when Peter said Lord
[32:39] call out call me out of the boat to walk
[32:42] on the water I want to walk on the water
[32:44] just like you're walking on the water
[32:45] that did that sparked something inside
[32:47] Jesus's heart he's catching the vision
[32:49] you know and you know it will been a
[32:51] little bit of a disappointment yo when
[32:53] he when he started doubting you know as
[32:55] Jesus said why did you doubt
[32:57] I was calling you out to myself I wanted
[33:00] you to join with me it wasn't just I'm
[33:03] not here showing off by walking in the
[33:05] water but no I didn't want to walk out
[33:06] here by myself I wanted you to get out
[33:09] of the boat and walk with me
[33:10] amen think about it it could have been
[33:12] the story could have been that that the
[33:14] Peter and Jesus were walking
[33:16] side-by-side on the water and he would
[33:20] have enjoyed that amen think about it he
[33:23] would have enjoyed that well he tweaked
[33:25] and he can still you can still walk on
[33:27] the water with him amen that's still
[33:30] possible that's still there that's still
[33:32] available to the sons and daughters or
[33:33] not amen
[33:35] why because he enjoys being with you in
[33:39] the supernatural amen
[33:44] he's gonna listen Christ dwells in the
[33:47] supernatural everything he does is
[33:51] supernatural
[33:52] he is supernatural he thinks
[33:55] supernaturally amen he doesn't think the
[33:58] way man thinks he thinks supernatural
[34:01] thoughts he is not confined by natural
[34:04] things he is not confined by natural
[34:06] boxes or the things that people put him
[34:08] in but he is not confined by any of the
[34:10] ideas of man but he is supernatural
[34:13] amen though the wind goes where wants to
[34:15] no one knows could say where it comes
[34:17] from no one can say where it's going but
[34:19] the will of the Spirit like the wind
[34:21] goes wherever wants to go and Christ
[34:24] enjoys bringing someone along with him
[34:28] amen
[34:29] the leadership of the Holy Ghost as much
[34:31] as we enjoy being led by the Holy Spirit
[34:34] so with that same joy the Holy Spirit
[34:37] enjoys leading us the Holy Spirit enjoys
[34:43] leading us in the supernatural way amen
[34:48] amen we ought to be expecting the
[34:52] supernatural hey may why because that's
[34:54] where he is walking a man when Christ's
[34:58] walks on the earth he is not walking on
[35:00] the carpet he's not walking on the

[37:24] being with him amen amen for the joy
[37:27] this set before him
[37:29] amen amen let's turn over to Psalms 23 I
[37:39] want to create read a few different
[37:42] passages from the Psalms brother Richard
[37:51] the scripture thing right before I came
[37:52] up here Psalms 23 6 says surely goodness
[37:57] and mercy shall follow me all the days
[38:02] of my life and I will dwell in the house
[38:05] of the Lord forever it weren't amazing
[38:09] things about the scripture is you know
[38:11] King David didn't physically spend all
[38:16] this time in the tabernacle on top of
[38:20] the hill physically he wasn't always
[38:24] there but he said but here he's saying
[38:27] that he was you know sometimes I think
[38:30] that this through the verses like this
[38:32] is the very reason why God said he's a
[38:34] man after my own heart
[38:35] amen amen you know a day David he spent
[38:39] a lot of time talking about I will
[38:40] always be there you know I always be
[38:42] there in the presence you know surely
[38:43] goodness and mercy shall follow me I
[38:45] will dwell in the house of the Lord
[38:47] forever amen why because Christ is
[38:51] always with amen he meant God Himself
[38:54] told David he said that I will be with
[38:58] you and my holy spirit I will never take
[39:00] away from you so Holy Spirit was always
[39:05] with them and what else did he say there
[39:06] he said surely David said surely
[39:09] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[39:11] the days of my life
[39:12] my God's goodness and God's mercy we're
[39:17] following him all the days of his life
[39:19] hey man let's go over to Psalms 107 I
[39:27] think I read this here several several
[39:31] months ago maybe a few years ago I don't
[39:32] recall
[39:46] Psalms 107 read verse 41 what that I
[39:58] like about Psalms 107 it Psalms 107 if
[40:01] you break it down it's a it's about five
[40:04] different stories and and each story
[40:08] ends with like if you read verse verse
[40:12] seven and eight there says and he led
[40:14] them forth by the right way that they
[40:16] might go to a city of habitation he says
[40:18] oh that men would praise the Lord for
[40:20] His goodness and for his wonderful works
[40:23] of men they repeats again in verse 21 oh
[40:25] that men would praise the Lord for His
[40:27] goodness and for his wonderful works
[40:29] that ornament and that repeats again
[40:30] over there in verse 31 and and and in a
[40:35] few different places in there boy is is
[40:37] about five different stories and each
[40:39] story has its own situation that someone
[40:41] is going through and then when they get
[40:44] through the end of what they're going
[40:45] through that they praise God and then
[40:49] they wish the other men would praise God
[40:51] that like they're praising God oh that
[40:53] men would praise God because look what
[40:55] I've gone through I wish everybody could
[40:57] see how good god is you know the first
[41:00] story there is talking about the
[41:01] redeemed out of Egypt the first eight
[41:03] verses they're talking about how they
[41:05] are hungry and thirsty they're wandering
[41:06] in the wilderness then they cried unto
[41:08] the Lord in their trouble and he
[41:10] delivered them oh that men would praise
[41:11] the Lord for His goodness and his
[41:13] wonderful works the tournament and then
[41:16] the second set of verses was talks about
[41:18] those that are bound by sickness and
[41:20] they're in prison you know I was talking
[41:22] about how they how they rebelled they
[41:24] were sitting in the darkness in the
[41:26] shadow of death and then he brought down
[41:28] their heart with labor and they fell
[41:30] down there's no one to help them
[41:31] and all sudden they cried unto the Lord
[41:33] out of their trouble he saved them out
[41:35] of their distress 'as a man and then oh
[41:38] that men would praise the Lord for His
[41:40] goodness amen and then it talks about
[41:42] the fools that how even though in the
[41:44] midst of their fools and their
[41:45] transgressions they're afflicted and
[41:48] then because there are niklas their life
[41:51] is hard and then all of a sudden God
[41:53] since they crying the Lord has trouble
[41:56] and he sends his word and heals them and
[41:58] delivers them from the
[41:59] destruction that they got themselves
[42:01] into this has oh that man he would
[42:03] praise the Lord for His goodness and for
[42:06] his wonderful works to the children of
[42:07] men and it talks about those that are
[42:09] the people that live in boats and go
[42:12] down and ships to the sea and how all
[42:14] sudden the storm comes up and the boat
[42:16] goes up on the wave and then it goes
[42:18] down into the depths and then their
[42:20] their heart is crying out as they began
[42:22] to realize they were getting ready to
[42:23] sink and this says and God brings them
[42:25] back to their desired Haven to the
[42:27] peaceful cove amen and then there they
[42:30] rejoice that their Lord saved them and
[42:32] it says oh the men would rejoice amen
[42:35] and praise the Lord for His goodness and
[42:37] for his wonderful works of children then
[42:39] he get down to verse 41 it says yet he
[42:42] said a yes says he the poor on high from
[42:46] affliction and maketh them Families like
[42:48] a flock the righteous shall see it and

[43:23] have her troubles until we give them
[43:25] under the Lord you know people only have

[44:29] excited a man for the joy that was set
[44:31] before him he endured the cross a man
[44:34] what was he he was that tree of life who
[44:37] had been separated like I spoke this
[44:39] morning the tree of life was separate
[44:41] from mankind by the by the the flaming
[44:45] swords of the Garden of Eden but here
[44:46] the tree of life was restored right back
[44:49] walking amongst men again a man was a a
[44:53] brought a joy he is a net tree of life
[44:55] is still here amen he's still able to
[44:58] restore unto you the joy of your
[45:01] salvation
[45:03] amen amen
[45:08] let's turn our to psalms 40
[45:36] I meant to go to 103 but we'll read
[45:38] flurried this vs. s withhold not thou
[45:42] verse 11 says withhold not thou thy
[45:45] tender mercies for me O Lord let thy
[45:48] loving-kindness and thy truth
[45:50] continually preserve me Lord don't
[45:53] withhold I tender mercies from me you
[45:57] know the the word their tender tender
[46:00] mercies you know I went to this fry it
[46:03] was a year or two years ago I preached a
[46:05] message called understanding the loving
[46:08] kindness of the Lord coming from that
[46:10] Psalm 107 even they shall understand the
[46:14] loving kindness of Lord but these two
[46:16] were these two phrases here the Dave had
[46:18] said over and over again he was always
[46:21] talking about the loving kindness of the
[46:22] Lord and the tender mercies of the Lord
[46:24] those were really those are tooth two
[46:27] things that David loved to talk about
[46:29] love to express and when you when you
[46:32] look down and try to understand exactly
[46:34] what those words mean the tender mercies
[46:38] of the Lord that the Christ tender
[46:41] mercies towards us had to do with the
[46:44] same loving-kindness and tender mercies
[46:47] that a mother would have towards her
[46:49] unborn child it had to do with when you
[46:52] look at the root words if it had to do
[46:54] with the way a mother would caress her
[46:57] belly as she's thinking about her unborn
[46:59] child that love that she has for there
[47:02] is no ill-will there there is there is
[47:05] she's not complaining about that child a
[47:07] Misha's you know he can kick her he can
[47:10] wake her up at night he can do whatever
[47:12] he wants but that mother is gonna love
[47:14] that child and she'll do anything for it
[47:17] and she will have mercy upon it a man
[47:21] because that child when it comes out of
[47:22] the womb is completely helpless and
[47:25] dependent upon its mother
[47:26] amen and she has mercy upon it hey man
[47:29] she doesn't just leave it there but she
[47:32] grabs it up in her arms amen
[47:34] and she nurses it and she and she loves
[47:37] that she cherishes it and everywhere she
[47:39] goes that bit that mutt that way that
[47:41] baby goes with it that's the cest the
[47:43] tender mercies that David was talking
[47:46] about amen that's the tender mercies
[47:48] that God has to
[47:49] children amen the love and the
[47:52] loving-kindness when you look at the
[47:54] root words down on that it has to do
[47:56] with God takes you when you are way down
[48:00] here by his loving-kindness he takes you
[48:03] up out of the pit and brings you up and
[48:06] sets you on the same standing as himself
[48:09] amen to be side-by-side with him you
[48:12] don't deserve to be there no but you
[48:15] don't deserve to be there but he brings
[48:17] you up anyway out of loving-kindness and
[48:20] places you on the same standing it looks
[48:22] at you I died
[48:23] amen you deserved a look at him I I you
[48:26] don't deserve to you don't deserve to be
[48:29] unequal standing with him but he takes
[48:31] you places you there anywhere that's his
[48:34] loving kindness towards you he didn't
[48:36] have to do it but he condescended down
[48:39] to you and brought you up to his own
[48:41] plane and you go walking you go and join
[48:44] life through together amen so that's
[48:47] what it says there lord with not with
[48:48] hole not thou thy tender mercies from
[48:51] you O Lord let thy loving-kindness and
[48:53] thy truth continually preserve me Amen
[48:57] now let's go over to where I meant to go
[48:59] to Psalms 103
[49:09] palms 103 I'll read the first two the
[49:12] fourth verse it says bless the Lord O my
[49:16] soul and all that is within me bless His
[49:19] Holy Name bless the Lord O my soul and
[49:21] forget not all of his benefits who
[49:24] forgiveth all thine iniquities and who
[49:27] healeth all thy diseases the watch this
[49:30] verse for who redeemeth thy life from
[49:33] destruction who crowns thee with
[49:35] lovingkindness and tender mercies a man
[49:39] he gives you that loving-kindness and
[49:41] those tender mercies as a gift to you
[49:44] he crowns it with you amen a encompasses
[49:48] around about your head and encompasses
[49:50] round about your thinking
[49:51] Amen all of your thinking is surrounded

[50:40] you he wanted the fellowship to take you
[50:42] places that you could never go on your
[50:45] own and to do things that you could
[50:48] never do by yourself Amen why because he
[50:51] had a desire to experience those things
[50:53] with someone else so he grabbed you and
[50:57] brought you along by your side you
[50:59] couldn't have done it by yourself by him
[51:02] and his loving-kindness and tender
[51:03] mercies grabbed ahold of you and brought
[51:06] you with him amen and as so it is with
[51:09] Christ amen yeah we didn't deserve it
[51:12] Amen we didn't heat we were down there
[51:14] in the dirt we but he grabbed us he
[51:16] lifted us up and he has a journey that

[55:36] didn't call us to be like that
[55:37] a mess one thing to be praying a faith
[55:40] like Abraham for twenty or thirty years
[55:41] but it's a different thing to be praying
[55:43] in doubt for twenty or thirty years and
[55:46] never fully accepting that Christ has
[55:49] already
[55:51] Christ has already set you free
[55:53] a man Christ has already broken the

[1:00:07] belly of the whale he wasn't alone God
[1:00:10] was with what brought upon his mind to
[1:00:13] say Lord I don't know which
[1:00:16] I'm gonna say that your temple is this
[1:00:17] way and once more I'm gonna lean towards
[1:00:21] kneel down right here in the whales
[1:00:23] belly at the bottom of the sea and I'm
[1:00:25] gonna cry out towards your tip well like
[1:00:27] Solomon said I could and his cry went up
[1:00:30] before the Lord and Lord heard his
[1:00:32] prayer he found out that he was in the
[1:00:34] pea thought he was the most area think
[1:00:36] about him think about Jonah saying what
[1:00:38] Lord why am I such a disobedient prophet
[1:00:41] Lord you have called me to the prophesy
[1:00:43] you called me to preach the gospel you
[1:00:45] called me to preach and and you tell me
[1:00:47] to go this way instead I go this way and
[1:00:49] Lord why can't I be like Elijah oh why
[1:00:52] can't I be like Enoch why can't I be
[1:00:54] like Abraham but God didn't call him to
[1:00:57] be like you know God didn't call him to
[1:00:59] be like Abraham God called him to be
[1:01:00] like Jonah a man here he felt like he
[1:01:03] was the most disobedient person this
[1:01:05] dude this will be a prophet ever but yet
[1:01:07] when when he got down on his knees and
[1:01:09] he didn't realize that here in his old
[1:01:12] disobedience he was typing out the most
[1:01:15] obedient act that would ever happened on
[1:01:16] the earth where Jesus said as Jonah was
[1:01:19] in the belly of the whale three days and
[1:01:21] three nights so shall the Son of Man be
[1:01:23] in the belly of the earth three days and
[1:01:25] three nights Jonah had to be in the
[1:01:27] belly of the whale and the very thing
[1:01:29] that he thought was his disobedience
[1:01:31] ended up being a prophecy of the most
[1:01:34] obedient act that would ever happen on
[1:01:35] this earth a many fenton it gives us
[1:01:39] hope to realize it sure he had an
[1:01:40] understanding the loving-kindness the
[1:01:42] lord and so can we have the same
[1:01:44] understanding because he's the same
[1:01:47] yesterday today and forever
[1:01:48] there wherever we are in our Christian
[1:01:51] walk even if we are in the midst of our
[1:01:53] disobedience so we can get down on our
[1:01:54] knees and say Lord forgive me once more
[1:01:58] I am gonna look towards your temple once
[1:02:00] more I'm gonna look towards you Lord to
[1:02:02] remember me
[1:02:03] amen the thing that you mean for wrong
[1:02:05] God can turn that around and make it for
[1:02:08] right amen and when you approach God
[1:02:12] with that kind of understanding then you
[1:02:14] can understand the loving-kindness and
[1:02:16] the tender mercies of the Lord amen why
[1:02:20] cuz his thoughts towards you have not
[1:02:22] changed they are eternal thoughts
[1:02:24] because you have eternal life amen he
[1:02:28] does not change
[1:02:32] amen amen hallelujah you know the like
[1:02:41] though the woman there was a prostitute
[1:02:45] in the city and they'll say woman and
[1:02:48] when she had maybe beyond the outskirts
[1:02:51] of the meetings with Jesus there and
[1:02:53] maybe it heard a few of the sermons but
[1:02:55] knew that she couldn't enter into the
[1:02:57] crowd or knew that she wouldn't be
[1:02:59] welcome there but that one day when she
[1:03:01] walked my Simon's house and she saw
[1:03:04] Jesus sitting there with unwashed feet
[1:03:06] and she thought well that ought not to
[1:03:10] be that way that shouldn't be a man that
[1:03:15] could preach look at they're not even
[1:03:16] paying any attention to him and a man
[1:03:19] that could preach the way that he
[1:03:20] preaches and say the words that he says
[1:03:22] a man should not be treated the way that
[1:03:25] he's being treated right now and she
[1:03:27] kind of looked through the window on her
[1:03:28] tiptoes you know and she's standing
[1:03:30] there and she's like this just is not
[1:03:32] right this is just not right look at me
[1:03:37] Simon is ignoring all the Pharisees were
[1:03:40] ignoring him Jesus is sitting in the
[1:03:42] corner every way everybody that came in
[1:03:44] the door the person would greet him at
[1:03:46] the door and wash their feet and you
[1:03:48] know and make him comfortable but
[1:03:50] somehow they missed Jesus and now
[1:03:55] everybody that is there at the party
[1:03:57] everybody's there at the supper and
[1:03:59] everybody had was give him the robe was
[1:04:02] given and you know was given given a
[1:04:04] gift was given a wash feet experience
[1:04:07] you know and was clean and comfortable
[1:04:08] and there's Jesus they missed him and
[1:04:11] he's sitting off over in the corner no
[1:04:14] one's paying attention to him and and
[1:04:15] this woman who wasn't even invited she
[1:04:18] gets up there and she she gets on her
[1:04:20] tiptoes and looks through the window
[1:04:21] looks through the lattice you know puts
[1:04:23] the parts the the branches of way and
[1:04:26] looks through on the inside of the it
[1:04:27] looks at the inner court and she says
[1:04:29] well that's just not right and then that
[1:04:32] thought strikes her she's like you know
[1:04:35] maybe I can make it up to him and she's
[1:04:38] like no no no I I couldn't do that she's
[1:04:41] like no you know maybe it's
[1:04:43] possible that which is lacking on their
[1:04:47] part that I could supply the need
[1:04:49] she's like old but I can't go in there
[1:04:52] you notice but that thought was in her
[1:04:54] mind and when I thought gets in your
[1:04:55] mind it drove her to do what she did and
[1:04:58] so she went down to the to the the the
[1:05:01] the dealer of fresh appointments and she
[1:05:06] went and she said I what's the most
[1:05:08] expensive thing that you got what's the
[1:05:11] most favorite perfume that you have and
[1:05:13] and the man he brings out and he goes
[1:05:15] and he goes into the back room and he
[1:05:17] gets it comes in a special box since
[1:05:20] there's a seal on it and sealed in there
[1:05:23] so that the the fumes can't get out and
[1:05:26] and inside there as ingredients have
[1:05:28] been brought from over here in Persia
[1:05:30] and down here over in India and a little
[1:05:34] bit of this and a little bit of all
[1:05:35] these rare spices and they've all been
[1:05:37] mixed together in there and crushed and
[1:05:39] put together in a special olive oil
[1:05:42] mixture and and they're all all ground
[1:05:45] up in there and then they put a wax seal
[1:05:47] on the box and they and they seal it all
[1:05:50] in together and they're all that is all
[1:05:52] the air inside there's just percolating
[1:05:54] and and getting a basin and all the the
[1:06:00] perfume in there and she goes and he
[1:06:03] places that box on the counter and you
[1:06:05] know says that I'll be he'll be seven
[1:06:08] thousand two hundred and forty six
[1:06:09] dollars you know and and she says that's
[1:06:13] my life savings but I will I will give
[1:06:16] that over for the the ointment and when
[1:06:18] she grabs that I'm and she goes and she
[1:06:20] and she finds she goes in and you know
[1:06:23] and the same thing they don't wash her
[1:06:26] feet either you know and she doesn't get
[1:06:29] the robe either and she has to walk in
[1:06:31] there just as she is but she has an
[1:06:33] offering before the Lord all that she
[1:06:36] ever has all that she ever was she gives
[1:06:39] to the Lord Jesus a man she goes over to
[1:06:42] the corner where Jesus is being ignored
[1:06:44] and she and she looks at him and and
[1:06:47] nobody is talking and they're having a
[1:06:50] good time and they're telling his jokes
[1:06:52] I shouldn't be told and and saying
[1:06:55] things it shouldn't be said and
[1:06:57] oddly things here and there and there's
[1:06:59] Jesus Christ the most pure man ever to
[1:07:01] walk the earth and no one's paying
[1:07:03] attention to him and she goes up and she
[1:07:05] he has struggling with the box I finally
[1:07:07] she just breaks the seal and breaks it
[1:07:09] open and and that that that the the type
[1:07:12] of Weymouth that that was
[1:07:14] begins to fill the room and the the odor
[1:07:19] and that would be the air that was on
[1:07:21] the inside of the box when she breaks
[1:07:22] that seal that air begins to because the
[1:07:26] olive oil it has a certain type of
[1:07:28] moisture and humidity to it and it
[1:07:30] begins to fill the room throughout all
[1:07:32] the places where it was and it say and
[1:07:35] it covers then so everybody in the room
[1:07:38] all sudden when the conduit for that
[1:07:39] they they realized something's going on
[1:07:43] and she began to wash his feet with the
[1:07:47] tears that she's crying you know and
[1:07:50] wash the feet with her hair i anoint him
[1:07:52] and anoint it with the oil and and
[1:07:54] wiping it with her hair with her long

[1:08:05] worship service but there was only two
[1:08:08] that were on the inside of the service

[1:08:12] outside of the service let me tell you
[1:08:15] those two were having a good time amen
[1:08:18] they were having a good time a man it
[1:08:21] didn't matter who else was around it
[1:08:23] didn't matter what anybody else was
[1:08:25] thinking but those to where she was
[1:08:27] worshiping her Savior a man and he was
[1:08:30] receiving her worship he didn't stop her
[1:08:33] he didn't do anything he just set there
[1:08:35] and watched her and watched her he
[1:08:38] didn't pull his foot away from her he
[1:08:40] just let her do exactly what she had in
[1:08:42] her mind to do a man as she worshiped
[1:08:45] her Savior and he said woman thy sins
[1:08:48] which are many are forgiven you amen now
[1:08:55] everybody was on the outside of that
[1:08:57] worship service didn't receive what she
[1:08:59] received a member she gave her all to
[1:09:02] the Lord amen and and because that was
[1:09:05] her joy Amen if you're ever if you're
[1:09:08] ever going to worship the Lord ever

[1:09:22] watched the Lord's feet with the oil of
[1:09:25] joy of gladness Amen that we bring with
[1:09:28] us why are we glad why are we happy
[1:09:30] because we understand what he has done
[1:09:33] for us

[1:09:36] understanding of what Christ has done
[1:09:38] for you you cannot worship Him the way
[1:09:43] that others worship Him amen
[1:09:46] you cannot worship Him the way that he
[1:09:49] deserves to be worshiped until you first
[1:09:51] come to that realization of exactly what
[1:09:55] he has done for you
[1:09:57] LOA's down in the deep miry clay but he
[1:10:00] took me and grabbed me up out of the
[1:10:02] deep miry clay stepped me up on the

[1:10:07] has had that experience we let me tell
[1:10:09] you that man is gonna go places with God
[1:10:11] a man but there's a lot of people out

[1:10:17] into Church stopping with their dirty
[1:10:19] feet and I'll go right back out why
[1:10:21] because they because Christ has not
[1:10:23] pulled them up out of the deep mire
