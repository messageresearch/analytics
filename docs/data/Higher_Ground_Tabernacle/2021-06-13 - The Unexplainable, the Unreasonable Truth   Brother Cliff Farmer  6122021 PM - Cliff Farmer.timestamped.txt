[45:16] so
[45:31] you know when god does those things just
[45:34] makes me know that he's mindful
[45:36] makes us know we're in the right channel
[45:41] amen if we could let's just turn to the
[45:43] scripture joshua chapter 10
[45:45] verse twelve
[46:06] joshua 10 and 12.
[46:10] then spake joshua to the lord in the day
[46:13] when the lord delivered up the amorites
[46:15] before the children of israel
[46:17] and he said in the sight of israel sun
[46:19] stands thou
[46:20] still upon gibeon and thou moon in the
[46:23] valley
[46:24] of azeroline allah
[46:36] and the sun stood still and the moon
[46:39] stayed
[46:39] until the people had avenged themselves
[46:42] upon their enemies
[46:43] it it is not this written in the book of
[46:46] jasher so the son
[46:47] stood still in the midst of heaven and
[46:49] hastened not to go down
[46:50] about a whole day
[47:06] and there was no day like that before it
[47:10] or after it that the lord hearkened unto
[47:13] the voice
[47:14] of a man for the lord fought for israel
[47:22] eternally
[47:33] the unexplainable unreasonable truth
[47:38] [Music]
[47:44] and he said a paradox is something
[47:46] that's true
[47:49] but it's unexplainable
[48:06] and brother keith what made it stand out
[48:12] was not that the sun stood still
[48:16] but what made it stand out
[48:29] it wasn't so special that the sun just
[48:31] stood still
[48:48] and god was hearkening to a man's voice
[48:53] that's unreasonable
[48:56] that's unexplainable
[48:59] but it's the truth i think about abraham
[49:04] abraham god told abraham you're going to
[49:06] have the
[49:08] seed that would be uh numbered like the
[49:10] sands of the sea
[49:11] idea
[49:29] but abraham goes to the base of the
[49:31] mountain
[49:34] and he tells the man with him
[49:37] me and the lad are going to worship
[49:43] i see the picture of it back there
[49:47] he said i am the lad go to worship
[49:51] and i and the lad will return
[49:56] abraham
[49:58] [Music]
[50:10] god would raise him up
[50:13] that's unreasonable
[50:16] it's unexplainable but it's the truth
[50:21] so abraham ties isaac
[50:49] said he would walk out to preach those
[50:52] seals
[50:56] [Music]
[51:12] [Music]
[51:20] and god said i've honored your faith
[51:24] and behold the ram is in the tickets
[51:27] [Music]
[51:28] how can god create an animal
[51:33] it's unreasonable
[51:39] [Music]
[51:46] he said let's see whose god is
[52:02] is
[52:17] your sacrifice pray to your god
[52:21] [Music]
[52:22] and they began to pray and he said
[52:26] holler louder scream louder
[52:31] he said maybe he's on another hill too
[52:33] far to hear you
[52:37] and they pray louder
[52:40] they beat drums louder
[52:43] [Music]
[52:52] [Music]
[52:59] on the scene but it was not in that
[53:03] and when they could not bring the fire
[53:07] elijah said let me have a chance
[53:12] he said pour water on the fire
[53:15] [Music]
[53:16] he said pour buckets of water on the
[53:18] wood
[53:21] and the scripture says that the water
[53:24] ran down the altar
[53:39] scientifically impossible brother troy
[53:44] to light wood that is soaking wet
[53:48] [Music]
[53:51] it was it was soaked up it soaked up the
[53:54] water
[54:06] let's read first kings 18.
[54:14] hear me o lord hear me
[54:19] that this people may know that thou
[54:22] art the lord god and that thou hast
[54:26] turned their heart
[54:27] back again
[54:31] that's all right first kings 18 37 all
[54:33] right
[54:36] i thank you for
[54:57] [Music]
[55:19] and the king said we're going to throw
[55:20] you in the fire
[55:23] he he told the soldiers that's you
[55:26] make the fire hotter
[55:30] seven times harder sit for before
[55:33] it's like in our age it's seven times
[55:37] hotter than it's ever been
[55:38] [Music]
[55:40] the fire is hotter the
[55:43] darkness is darker
[55:46] isaiah
[55:52] [Music]
[55:59] he said seven times harder it is set for
[56:02] pluto
[56:03] so hot that when they threw the young
[56:07] boys in the fire
[56:09] [Music]
[56:10] killed those that threw them in
[56:13] [Music]
[56:21] [Music]
[56:29] [Music]
[56:41] fire couldn't kill them
[56:46] [Applause]
[57:06] [Music]
[57:09] looks like the son
[57:25] [Music]
[57:36] it's unexplainable it's an explicit
[57:43] [Music]
[57:51] the way the devil has tormented
[58:01] [Music]
[58:07] in the midst of the fire um
[58:10] fire couldn't hurt him
[58:13] but when they walked out the only thing
[58:17] the fire had done
[58:20] was loosed
[58:31] [Music]
[58:40] [Music]
[58:48] in the
[58:50] [Music]
[59:02] [Music]
[59:11] [Music]
[59:16] he
[59:19] [Music]
[59:28] [Music]
[59:34] satan attacked our church
[59:38] our church was split in half
[59:43] he attacked our pastor
[59:58] through
[1:00:11] the devil came to destroy us
[1:00:14] [Music]
[1:00:33] [Music]
[1:00:40] [Applause]
[1:00:53] of bringing you victory
[1:01:08] you love the lord tonight
[1:01:11] mark 11 22.
[1:01:15] and jesus answering saith unto them have
[1:01:18] faith
[1:01:19] in god jesus
[1:01:23] for verily i say unto you that whosoever
[1:01:25] shall say unto this mountain
[1:01:27] be thou removed and be cast into the sea
[1:01:30] and shall not doubt in his heart
[1:01:32] but shall believe that those things
[1:01:33] which he saith shall come to pass
[1:01:36] he shall have whatsoever he saith
[1:01:44] [Music]
[1:01:49] whatsoever things he saith

[1:02:51] he shall have whatsoever he says
[1:02:56] what do you want what do you
[1:03:00] want from god just because every zombie
[1:03:03] start saying it
[1:03:05] [Music]
[1:03:06] start speaking
[1:03:10] we don't get from god
[1:03:12] [Music]
[1:03:14] because we don't ask from god
[1:03:17] but he said ask abandon me
[1:03:21] that's your joy may be full
[1:03:24] ask for your family and believe it
[1:03:34] [Music]

[1:03:54] them
[1:03:56] and you shall have them

[1:04:07] he said if you believe the
[1:04:25] brother keith can you explain that
[1:04:30] see the world around us
[1:04:34] they can't accept the message
[1:04:38] because they can't explain it
[1:04:41] they can't accept the ring cloud
[1:04:45] because they can't explain it they can't
[1:04:48] explain the pillar of fire over brother
[1:04:50] branham's head
[1:04:58] [Music]
[1:05:04] [Music]
[1:05:20] [Music]
[1:05:34] but
[1:05:42] [Music]
[1:05:48] he said that's
[1:06:01] it's unexplainable but it's the truth
[1:06:06] john chapter 4 verse 3. john
[1:06:18] he left judea
[1:06:21] and departed again into galilee
[1:06:26] and he must needs go through samaria
[1:06:29] come in
[1:06:35] the one that turned water into wine
[1:06:42] the one that fed five thousand
[1:07:13] sometimes we put god in a box
[1:07:17] we think he can only move in this area
[1:07:21] [Music]
[1:07:23] why would god want to harlot
[1:07:30] [Music]
[1:07:36] [Music]
[1:07:42] [Music]
[1:07:53] so this woman was so
[1:08:00] [Music]
[1:08:08] one day she walks to the well
[1:08:10] [Music]
[1:08:13] and a man is sitting at the well
[1:08:15] [Music]
[1:08:16] imagine what she thought she's a harlot
[1:08:21] and there's a man waiting at the whale
[1:08:23] yeah
[1:08:23] [Music]
[1:08:25] but this man began to speak
[1:08:28] like she had never heard a man speak
[1:08:32] he told her she had five husbands
[1:08:36] and the
[1:08:50] whale and the seventh man
[1:08:54] elusive begin to discern the thought
[1:08:58] and the intent of the heart
[1:09:02] there were six church age messengers
[1:09:08] [Music]
[1:09:17] [Music]
[1:09:26] [Music]
[1:09:41] [Music]
[1:09:45] come see a man who told me all
[1:09:50] my pasts now watch this
[1:09:54] she always came to the well alone
[1:09:58] but what's in contact with jesus
[1:10:07] [Music]
[1:10:14] god
[1:10:24] [Music]
[1:10:25] but it's the truth
[1:10:40] he became smaller than a drop of blood
[1:10:46] he said he became a blood cell
[1:10:50] he said and then he wrapped that blood
[1:10:52] cell
[1:10:55] with his own blood
[1:11:01] [Music]
[1:11:08] it's scientifically impossible
[1:11:27] [Music]
[1:11:34] that a microscope would have to be used
[1:11:37] to pick him up
[1:11:43] and the scripture tells us that we are a
[1:11:46] part of him
[1:11:48] and when that blood cell was broken at
[1:11:50] calvary
[1:11:52] when
[1:11:55] [Music]
[1:12:07] [Music]
[1:12:20] it can't be uh explained by
[1:12:23] science science would tell us you're
[1:12:27] crazy
[1:12:29] but it's the truth anyway
[1:12:35] one time god needed a man
[1:12:39] he needed a church age messenger
[1:12:42] [Music]
[1:12:45] he needed an apostle
[1:12:48] to the start the work of the christian
[1:12:50] church
[1:12:54] what a great man so i'm sure
[1:12:57] god started looking in kingdoms
[1:13:02] no no he didn't look for royalty
[1:13:06] but god saw a man
[1:13:10] named saul walking down the road to
[1:13:14] damascus
[1:13:27] [Music]
[1:13:29] that killer of believers
[1:13:32] [Music]
[1:13:40] [Music]
[1:13:43] that man with letters in his hands
[1:13:52] [Music]
[1:13:57] and suddenly a light
[1:14:12] but they heard not the voice
[1:14:17] but i was reading the other day when
[1:14:20] brother branham was baptizing in 1933
[1:14:24] and the voice spoke and said
[1:14:41] enough but she heard the voice
[1:14:44] the men with paul was saul saw the light
[1:14:50] but they didn't hear the voice
[1:14:53] many people saw the light
[1:14:56] but they didn't catch the voice
[1:15:01] he saw the light and they heard the
[1:15:05] voice
[1:15:07] let me tell you there's importance
[1:15:27] [Music]
[1:15:33] [Music]
[1:15:35] does that make any sense
[1:15:38] it makes no sense but it's not true
[1:15:44] does it make sense that god
[1:15:47] the jew would pick a a man named william
[1:15:51] branham
[1:15:54] with no uh no schooling
[1:15:58] third grade to bring his word
[1:16:04] god would pick a hillbilly
[1:16:07] [Music]
[1:16:09] no word for that is there
[1:16:13] god would pick a uh a popper
[1:16:18] or
[1:16:21] i don't know there's no word for it
[1:16:26] god would pick a poor man
[1:16:29] god didn't pick a king he didn't pick a
[1:16:33] president
[1:16:35] not a senator he didn't pick a prime
[1:16:38] minister
[1:16:40] but he picked a little poor boy
[1:16:43] raised up without shoes on his feet
[1:17:00] you know what else doesn't make sense
[1:17:04] and this is the greatest thing
[1:17:09] he picked you to hear it
[1:17:13] he picked me brother troy to hear it
[1:17:18] it wasn't because i was good
[1:17:21] was it because i was without sin
[1:17:25] but by his grace by his mercy
[1:17:31] [Music]
[1:17:42] went to an insane asylum
[1:17:47] there was a young girl in there
[1:17:53] she was in all kinds of sins
[1:17:56] she
[1:18:10] in our mind she's too far gone
[1:18:15] for god to reach her
[1:18:19] what brother branham said
[1:18:22] he said don't you desire
[1:18:28] to be married to marie and have babies
[1:18:32] on phone brother brandon was not looking
[1:18:35] at where she was
[1:18:38] he was not looking at what she had done
[1:18:43] he was looking at her desire
[1:18:47] there's a brother branham uh there's a
[1:18:50] sermon not a it's not really a sermon
[1:18:53] the interview with sister bruce
[1:18:57] it's recorded in brother branham's
[1:18:59] sermon
[1:19:02] sister bruce said brother branham
[1:19:05] i don't know if i'm saved or not
[1:19:13] [Music]
[1:19:21] god is not looking at how many failures
[1:19:24] you have
[1:19:27] what's your desire so brother branham in
[1:19:30] this
[1:19:31] institution he said what's
[1:19:37] [Music]
[1:19:44] [Music]
[1:20:00] [Music]
[1:20:16] but it's the truth
[1:20:18] [Music]
[1:20:30] he said in a few moments she raised her
[1:20:32] head
[1:20:34] tears running down her cheeks
[1:20:37] she looked me in the face she said
[1:20:40] brother
[1:20:42] something happened
[1:20:49] [Music]
[1:21:05] [Music]
[1:21:11] and a prostitute
[1:21:18] [Music]
[1:21:26] he said now
[1:21:33] [Music]
[1:21:39] god takes the worst
[1:21:44] [Music]
[1:21:50] [Music]
[1:21:52] brother branham tells a story
[1:21:56] about a woman in memphis
[1:22:00] brother brandon said he was on a plane
[1:22:03] to dallas
[1:22:07] according to his ticket
[1:22:22] but a woman got sincere with god
[1:22:28] brother said desperation
[1:22:32] reaches the throne it reaches the heart
[1:22:35] of god
[1:22:38] that woman got desperate
[1:22:41] she was in prayer for her son
[1:22:47] she begins to pray
[1:22:51] and the plane begins to shake
[1:22:56] they had to land the plane in memphis
[1:22:59] [Music]
[1:23:02] oh it's unreasonable
[1:23:20] sometimes it looks like when you pray
[1:23:24] god's not answering the prayers
[1:23:27] but the wheels are turning
[1:23:31] it's in motion so that
[1:23:44] she said at three o'clock in the morning
[1:23:51] [Music]
[1:24:00] he was asleep she stood by the gate
[1:24:06] it looked like that the promise wouldn't
[1:24:09] come
[1:24:11] but he said stand by the gate
[1:24:14] the scripture
[1:24:28] [Music]
[1:24:40] until seven o'clock just got sit there
[1:24:42] at seven o'clock
[1:24:45] she still believed but the promise
[1:24:48] hadn't come
[1:24:51] at seven o'clock brother branham gets up
[1:24:54] out of bed
[1:24:55] [Music]
[1:24:56] at eight o'clock i we though she was
[1:24:59] still standing by the gate
[1:25:02] and the prophet wasn't there but the
[1:25:05] prophet begins to walk
[1:25:09] and the voice says turn this way
[1:25:16] and then the voice says turn this way
[1:25:23] he looks up and he sees a lady
[1:25:26] he's working farmer and she said you
[1:25:29] know good morning parson
[1:25:31] bonjour pastor
[1:25:34] she said i saw you in a vision
[1:25:37] i knew you were coming i said where's my
[1:25:41] elijah
[1:25:46] and i saw a preacher brother
[1:25:49] said it this way he said can you imagine
[1:25:55] god stop that plane
[1:25:59] for that woman's prayer
[1:26:03] it's unreasonable
[1:26:06] it's
[1:26:11] [Music]
[1:26:39] [Music]
[1:26:49] did he tell his testimony
[1:26:54] did that tell his testimony
[1:26:59] okay my dad
[1:27:05] [Music]
[1:27:14] but he didn't believe in speaking in
[1:27:16] tongues being the evidence
[1:27:20] and he didn't believe in women preachers
[1:27:26] so someone that worked with him so
[1:27:29] there's a preacher coming to chicago
[1:27:33] that has funny ideas
[1:27:42] so they said he's a mind reader
[1:27:57] so brother branham is preaching in a
[1:27:58] large auditorium
[1:28:01] [Music]
[1:28:02] and my grandfather goes and he sits way
[1:28:06] in the back
[1:28:09] he said i don't want anyone
[1:28:12] he said i don't want anyone to be able
[1:28:14] to hear me
[1:28:15] or to see me i'm sorry i don't want
[1:28:18] anyone to be able to see me
[1:28:21] and he laid my dad up underneath the
[1:28:23] chairs
[1:28:26] he said i don't want this man to see him
[1:28:30] and know that he's crippled
[1:28:35] and he started praying he said god
[1:28:40] if this man is a prophet
[1:28:43] then let him call my name
[1:28:46] about my son and it only believed
[1:28:52] in 1961
[1:28:59] [Music]
[1:29:07] he said you're praying
[1:29:10] about your son's feet
[1:29:14] he said your name's farmer he didn't
[1:29:16] know a farmer
[1:29:17] he said he's healed
[1:29:19] [Music]
[1:29:21] my dad
[1:29:35] [Music]
[1:29:59] [Music]
[1:30:05] the doctor said he would be on crutches

[1:31:42] but the word of the lord came to him
[1:31:46] and he said i heard you the first time
