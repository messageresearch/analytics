a great job he's getting better all the time some song he's saying tonight I'm know he's getting the American accent I mean that's wonderful God is good to us as we stand always good to see brother Neil remember the mic and all we love you appreciate all of you I am in expectation of a change a change of the body we know that by God's grace we are fighting the last battle and I'm so glad to be part of it most people don't even know that time is up and everything is winding down a winding out but Satan is a busy adversary he knows how to distract us and make us think that we have a lot of time time to spare but the Bible according to Zechariah I believe says when the vision has been made plain when it's made clear let him that read it run not walk run and this is a time amen we ought to be putting forth our best effort now we can't save ourselves but we ought to show God just how much we appreciate his salvation Romans four please we're gonna run point Romans four and then from there to Hebrews six Romans four beginning at the 13th verse we'll read down to the 25th verse and then we're gonna do Hebrews 6:13 2 through 21 we still have been studying the Hebrew series I will encourage every one of you who have access to the messages to really listen it has been a quite a next and I have not finished or completed what I've been studying I've read the book I've in the past but it seemed like God has anointed the pages or the words on these books on this book these subjects I am grateful for the grace of God Romans 4 beginning at the 13th verse for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed though the law through I'm sorry let me read that again for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith but if they which are the law be heirs faith is not is made void and the promise made of none effect because the law worketh wrath for there is no law but for that where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end of the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that which also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he plead even God who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things would be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now did when he was about an hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being full we persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform I love that and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness imputed means to be charged to him now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification that's about four or five services right there Hebrews 6:13 through 21 God is more than able I want to say that the meetings this weekend has been canceled because of the weather conditions but we're going to reschedule them so bear that in mind I don't know how bad the weekend as a whole will be but the meetings with brother Andrew has been counseled he had to cancel his flights coming because we're coming in on on Friday but we will if the law permit and weather permit we will be having Sunday service twice here all right let's start Hebrew 613 to 21 when God made promised to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessings I will bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise for men verily swear by the greater and oath for confirmation is to them and in of all strife wherein God willingly willing more abundantly to show unto the air of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which interest into that within the veil for me excuse me the forerunner is for us entered even Jesus made an high priest forever after the order of their kids are dead let us pray father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord we steal Oh God working with the man Christ Jesus Lord we know that there are so many things and so many facets that we could use Lord under this topic but I pray father God that what would be ministered tonight will be such a blessing to the people that they will walk out of here or tonight knowing that they have been set free totally free whether it be visible now our non not visible we know by faith Lord God we we obtain these things and so we thank you Father God for the finish and complete work of your salvation that has been brought to us through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ father we thank you for your grace and your mercy in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I know a lot of us were in great expectation for anticipation and expectation for the weekend but the airline's called well he called the airlines because I I called him and he called the airlines and they told him that because of the storm that was coming that he would more than likely not be able to make his flight so we didn't want him to be stranded or put in a position where he loses his ticket cuz we want him to come and so by God's grace he was able he takes me back I'm talking about brother Andrew takes me back and said that he was able to keep his tickets and he just got to make some future arrangements by God's grace we will keep it in that order in which we already presented it in and hopefully by God's grace we'll be able to follow it through when that date and time come God is good to us and all I could think about today even today because I know some of us have been really going through some tremendous battles if you haven't been going through tremendous battles well perhaps I say it like this I have been going through my battles and perhaps some of yours too but nevertheless amen we know that God is more than able I serve a God who is real and if you expect to serve God in in this light without battles without disappointments without God telling you why you are mistaken because God is not going to always tell you why things happen but we do want know one thing and that is that God has is answering our prayer we ask God Lord let us be just like you and so therefore God the Holy Spirit is working on your behalf it happen to perfect you amen Paul says one thing I love appalled Paul says I have learned how to be content in whatever state I find myself in now you gotta realize that Paul went through a lot of things matter of fact he had been killed three times and resurrected three times now I don't know about you but one time would have been enough for me nevertheless Paul says I have been dead they told me I was dead and God raised me up to kill me again and raised me up to kill me again so you got to realize hey man that we go through hard tires and hard tests and Paul had to go through those particular situations because and then God wanted to keep him down low Paul God even gave Paul a thorn in his flesh historian historian says that it was his eye because remember when he the pillar of fire on the way way to Damascus amen that light blinded him and he from that point on he had an issue with his I read according to the Word of God there were those who said to Paul listen we would give you Paul said you would have given me your own eye he would have plucked them out and who you would have given them to me you considered me as the Lord Jesus himself so you see Paul that Christ was such has such oneness amen even then that the people thought like they do today he was Jesus but Paul says listen is not I I'm not Jesus I'm just here to reflect him I want you to understand that I can I am nothing and everything that I have achieved has been because of Jesus Christ I have a subject tonight perfectly in love with us you know because a lot of times we think that that we judge God like a man and we think that God falls out of love with us God can never fall out of love with you that's why Paul said who shall separate us from the love of God see what gonna separate us who can separate us nothing can separate you from the love of Christ once you are in Christ oh come on somebody now we talked about going beyond the veil of your flesh because this is why I read our Abraham the Bible tells us that Abraham had a promise from God and Abraham was old when the promise first came and he was older when God came to fulfill the promise because when God made the promise to Abraham Sarah wounds was dead that means her reproduction system was no longer working had it even been working it still would have not been any good to Abraham because it worked when she was young but we find out that God withheld children from Sarah nothing was wrong with Abraham remember cuz Abraham was able to produce Ishmael with Hagar but when it came to Sarah how something was wrong with her so when God changed her when God brought her back amen to a young person y'all believe that Amen we know what the world says she was old 97 years old I 80 something years old you know old grandma but there was a mystery in there that God hid from the eyes of the wise and the prudent matter-of-fact Amen God showed that there's something had taken place with Sarah because there was a king in Egypt that loved Sarah at first sight and wanted to marry her and God had to interrupt the situation amen because Abraham who was the father of Nations lied to the king and said this is my sister now he there's no such thing as a little white lie a lie is a lie no matter which color it comes in so you got to realize by God's grace amen that this is a lie yes she was part his sister but he needed to say this is my wife now think about the kind of a man because I want you to understand that because you saved doesn't mean you don't make mistakes and because you are elected doesn't mean that you don't get in trouble hallelujah but who's gonna lay any charge to God's elect no one now let me go on by God's grace because some of y'all faces are scaring me you and I must realize by God's grace that we are in a position that you must learn and you must know who you are he's a God Savior or he didn't he's a God is in you or he's not right you must know because Jesus said in that day you'll know that I am in the father the father's in me and I am in you hallelujah but God so loved the world this is what I love about it because you know we're living in an age now where people say so love or so hate that's a new phrase so putting so before because there's a time when you would not have been able to get away with that type of language but in this day it's a soul and I always think is this the age that God is so loving us because this is the age that is the most wicked the most evil age of every age and there is nothing you can do to deliver yourself there's nothing you can do he meant to save yourself oh come on somebody you and I must realize by God but yaha we must go beyond this veil hallelujah you said why are you saying it like that there is a veil and we're talking about a heavenly veil but right now we're talking about a fleshly veil this veil that you're working with is the flesh this flesh a man is condemned this flesh is the flesh that keeps you from seeing in the other dimension if you didn't have this flesh you would be standing in your theophany and in your theophany you would know all things but why are you in this flesh it veils the Angels that are now sitting in this place it veils the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ you don't know that the Bible said were two or three are gathered in his name there he is in the midst but you and I can't see him because of this fleshly veil because this veil amen hinders you it stops you from being the kind of person you want to be hallelujah it stops you from being holy sometime it stopped you from being sanctified sometime it is your greatest enemy hallelujah but when it came to Abraham Abraham was ninety something years old and the Bible said he considered not his own body hallelujah he did not care about the veil that he was living in his faith was able to go beyond that veil and call those things that be not as though they were y'all understand what I'm going with this veil right now is getting older mine is it's getting older that the wrinkles and the hair is falling out and everything else but beyond this veil beyond this veil they meant there is another world Amen that has been didn't been been built for you and I but while I'm in this veil I'm not gonna live according to the veil is that right the Bible says there's no condemnation to those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit hallelujah so it is our ability there is an ability that you and I must tap into our how can I say lion let me say right there is a way for us to walk in the spirit and not in the flesh hallelujah for an example if the doctor says you've got cancer hallelujah hallelujah but your soul says I am Who I am perfect is that right even the prophet of God said if you can vision yourself as perfect or if you can vision yourself as being healed all you got to do is walk walk into the vision walk into what you see and it will come to pass hallelujah that's the world that you and I must learn how to live in the Bible says we are now living in heavenly places in Christ Jesus who you but this veil is what we are allowing we are allowing this veil to blind us to keep us from seeing the promises of God hallelujah but when a promise is made the inner man says yay to the Word of God it doesn't go by the veil or in it doesn't work amen according to this dimension it works according to the dimension that we're now sitting in which is in that sixth dimension Oh glory to God that's what happened to Abraham and the Bible tells us that Sarah receives you see because one thing about one thing about seeing somebody else stands in faith it seemed to help you pull up amen into a position where you can have faith yourself you say explain this to me David who had the faith of God not only did he have the faith of God but his faith was so alive it was anointed and here was those other Israelites who was afraid of Goliath but once they saw David defeat Goliath it quickened their faith and they ran after the Philistines hallelujah that's why it's so important to know where you're standing I love this because the Bible tells us that we have an anchor of the soul can I say it like this most of us fail because we believe that God has charged us with some kind of sin we feel defeated we feel like a hypocrite because we're forever thinking that God works according to our standard but the Bible said that in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us is that right now I'm not telling you this is what the Bible said shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid but let me ask you something when Peter had denied Christ and swore three times is there anywhere in the Bible he repented no there is not in there hah cuz God had already justified him God had already seen what he was gonna do God had already told him what he was gonna do hallelujah and God to show you that the devil had nothing over Peter when Jesus raised from the dead he told his disciples whatever you do go get him God didn't say you grabbed did you won't be the speaker on the day of Pentecost God never took away his commission he kept his commission in spite of his failures hallelujah yeah you wouldn't say look at David David you know in Bathsheba but God never took the kingship away from David and David repented so I want you to understand don't you think you're gonna do sin and I can't get away with it but the one thing about those who are chosen and elected by God when you do sin God gonna spank you just ensures your name you get it but he can't destroy you hallelujah you'll get it but he can't put you away somebody help me here here hallelujah because you gotta realize by God's grace we have an anchor of the soul what is that your faith in the work of the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ because the Bible said he has gone beyond the veil and because he's gone beyond the veil we have an anchor of the soul because when he went there you and I went there too hallelujah come on a promise oftentimes you know you feel so rejected and you know what I think to myself I says you know God can keep you in every thing he wants to keep you in but sometimes he just doesn't he just won't do it he lets the devil do whatever he wants to do sometimes right to see whether you gonna get up to see whether what you're going to do in your situation and the Bible tells us that we all say in all things give things but we have a little problem and you know what we do you understand me we fail to see that it's all under control god don't beat Satan is not perfect but God is you understand me listen it is that flesh y'all know it is it right am i right on this and your body is to think this thing that keeps you from praying from worship from serving the Lord like you want to hallelujah let's call it all-night prayer and your flesh is already says no and it gives all kind of excuses why you can't right but you see that's nothing I'm not prayers not hard cuz once you get in the spirit you don't even know your time you lose time but I'm not gonna call an all-night prayer but I just thought I'd throw that one out you and I must understand the veil is what keeps us from seeing God face to face hallelujah it's true even in this church if God is in here why can't we see him he's here the angel of the Lord is here is that right you and I must understand because you are God's property he cannot afford to leave you alone he will never leave you alone even when you're doing wrong he's standing right there watching you oh nothing but the truth he didn't come over there oh well eyes though he didn't know he was right there he saw it and God is right there you said I don't he's just as they're just as shoes is you breathing he's there hallelujah the veil is what keeps us from seeing the angels at their position this morning or this even is standing by the seats and we don't even know that when you wake up God is standing right there by your bed and he's right there when you say Lord I pray later he's right there hallelujah but this veil keep less from seeing him this veil is what keeps us from seeing him we are here behind the veil and that veil is the flesh and we are sons and daughters of God we're in the presence of God see you K you can't get out of the president of God once you in the presence of God you understand me I'm talked about in Christ when you're in college you're always in Christ hallelujah now if you walk out to the flesh he stays up on the limb but let me tell you something is he still in you he don't just leave he said he could even I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you but the anointing the election doesn't change you understand me it doesn't matter I want to say it that right way we make mistakes all the time my children make mistakes all the time but no matter how many mistakes they make they're my children so is it with the sons and daughters of God no matter how many mistakes you make amen you still God's children let me ask good question I know many times I said like this when I first got saved that's all praise God when I get the Holy Ghost I'm gonna be perfect but you know I thought I'd never make mistake and when I did it was devastating hello and I failed to see that was what the blood was all about remember I said last week that that word comforta is the same word advocate and the Bible said we have advocate with the father so the confident is that advocate he's that jury he's that georgy the attorney who stands in your behalf every time you make a mistake so that you can understand he's never lost a case so every time you make a mistake that real are true sons and daughters of God gonna say Lord forgive me hallelujah they're not gonna wait for the next day they're go right there very next moment Lord forgive me I'm sorry you understand me that's the working of the real Holy Ghost help me Jesus so you and I can understand you said well brother what are you saying maybe this is not deep enough but I'm gonna tell you something my thing is this if we can get a hold to who God is and what God has done for us here to take away your days of sadness you realize that this we should never be sad we should always be in the joy of the Lord first of all we must always trust him and when we find ourselves in situations valleys that's what David said that though I walk through the valley of shadow of death I'll fear no evil that man a man was in the Old Testament we're in the new we're here with Christ in us not just with us in us and you and I must we must understand that every time Satan takes our smiles and bring him to his foul he accuses us before God every time you love the Lord we're sons and daughters of God we're in the presence of God oh my angels of God are encamped about those who fear Him y'all believe that we're in the presence of Lord and a design kept about us it's true whether you know it or not that's why our behaviors should be different all help us Jesus I'm gonna say something in just a moment did you not know that the behavior how could I say it the behavior of Christ is this person the behavior of Christ is his person because his person has only one way of behavior and his behavior is holiness whatever falls on the holiness that is the behavior of Christ so for us to say that we Christ on the inside and the behavior is not there then we ought to examine ourselves as Paul say and see whether we be in the faith help us Lord oh we got to pray nowadays that your faith don't fail because right now that's what's happening with a lot of people their faith is failing because they don't understand that once let me say like this once saved is always saved that's the truth if God saved you you can never be lost if God saved you you can never be lost and how God seals that in you by he seals that promise of salvation in you by the Holy Ghost that's why we call it the seal of promise remember last week I think I talked about this but remember the preacher who ended up becoming a drunkard and he says oh I don't know I'm not gonna preach anymore and he started drinking over a case and he got sick and he died we in our minds what is it oh I know he back slid and I know he's going to hell no he had a Savior no he had a savior and that Savior was Jesus Christ and do you think that God didn't see what he was going to do before he saved but God saved him anyhow holy lord have mercy and just like what God does what God did when he did wouldn't we think that's what God does when he what when you won't repent is like a parent if you don't repent go in your room if you don't say I'm sorry go in your room oh I must spank you right somehow judgment is coming but it's for your own good right and so God when he can't get you to repent he puts you to sleep a lot of people don't understand I said many other righteous and how they die and God allows them to fall asleep to keep them away from the evil that is to come that means they were going to get worse right I'm so glad y'all so enthused and happy tonight I almost don't know what to do pulling on the gift praise God hallelujah but you and I must realize by God's grace that God is so good to us that you and I must understand that when God brings you into the Word of God no matter how many mistakes you make and I'm not giving you excuses I'm not giving you away but you get the Oh a praise God I might as well do what I want to do well that shows you're not saved because a real son and daughter of God's divine as Ernest will is to do the perfect will of God hallelujah you get these people and so many I'm in the message and don't understand Amen that you just can't do what you want to do it's oh praise God I got the Holy Ghost huh you can't do it you can do it but God gonna spank you if you are a son and daughter of God that's the thing now if you're not a son and daughter of God he lets you go on do what you want to do because there's nothing he can do for you if that makes sense but a real son and daughter of God the Bible said God chasing those whom he loves thank God for the chastisement of God hallelujah see that veil keeps you from the living living the way you we should and I when I heard that I thought Lord i'ma write a song Lord I want to live the way I should because you know I just want to see God and I had it in my head and I lost it but anyhow maybe gotta bring it back but my point is all of us need to live the way we should right if the holy is here and the holy ghost mean people of the age go by to live it how can we come with an excuse there is no excuse right let me move on to something here thank God for His grace talk about veiled right now we look at this thing we said when I Paul had to understand me did Paul ever make mistakes I'm sure he did Paul was a man and you think about it you say Paul calls a lot of Saints to blaspheme the Holy Spirit and yet God spared him why because the elected of God cannot blaspheme the Holy Ghost they can't do it why because they were justified before the foundation of the world you'll never hear a true son and daughter of God blaspheme the Holy Spirit Paul says nay and all these things and listen I've suffered a lot of things I've gone through a lot of things I've heard dr. something to go and come to this now we talked about going on to perfection we talked about all the doctors that we go through baptism and repentance and all of these things and understand all these things were good when we were going through them your church order doesn't save you only the blood of Jesus Christ can save you and understand all your works doesn't save you you're not saved by works you're saved by the grace of God all of your religious traditions in order to go to perfection you've got to recognize that those things are true but you've got to press toward the mark of a higher calling because none of those traditional things can save you none of it brings you to perfection you understand what I'm saying all of the do's and the don'ts all the little legalism you can be as legal as you want to you can do it all right and still be lost your righteousness must supersede the righteousness of the Pharisees you know what that is that is the Holy Ghost hallelujah and that Holy Ghost is given to those who are elected and chosen by God to receive it woo listen we have a place that God has already prepared for us to go to and if you're counting on your own righteousness to get you there you're going to miss it we can only depend on the righteousness of God can I take you back to the Garden of Eden it came to Abel we saw what Cain did Cain you know he he had all of the the flowery things and all of the vegetables and all of the farming things he had all of that in a row and it no doubt it was so beautiful you know like some of our churches out here look so beautiful and they think because they're fabulous and they're beautiful God is gonna accept him God only accept the blood washed y'all hear what I'm saying you gotta be washed in the blood and here was evil amen Abel didn't have nothing to show for nothing in fact his church service was a mess he was over there hacking the nikkor that make of the lamb he meant to sacrifice it unto the Jehovah God or the unseen God he had a revelation that there was nothing he could do to save himself and once everybody recognized that that there's nothing I can do to save myself you're in a right a good position you're in the place where God wants you to be because he's the only one that can save you hallelujah is that right the Bible says salvation is of the Lord you can't even judge a man by the way he acts because you don't know what God is gonna do for that person yet later you don't know if we would have looked Jacob and Esau we would have known listen no way Jacob could be the right one cuz Jacob was the shyster Esau was the good boy Esau I like to say like this he saw prepared a meal that his dad was all always happy with Esau wasn't the best preacher he looked good but he sold his birthright that's what I was trying to tell the people the other day some of us we don't even realize that selling your birthright doesn't have to be over Cadillac like Elvis did it could be something really small did y'all know that a lot of people will miss the rapture because of their families because they love their families more than they love God you can't love nobody more than you love God hallelujah a million will lose you said all brother it is true let's move on so when it comes to saving you the blood of Jesus Christ it's the only thing that can save you religion is good it's good to be a part of a church but the church can't save you salvation only comes by the man the man Christ Jesus he's the only one that can save you and you said what brothers what are you trying to get you get us - I'm trying to say not only am I saved but I've been saved like like Hebrew says unto the uttermost not to the almost the uttermost beyond I'm say beyond that Paul said I'm more than a conqueror you are more than a conqueror why because Christ Jesus conquers for you he's your brother Luke what are you well I'm trying to you know if we don't fall in love with Jesus we're going to miss it a lot of time we think because we can do ours our religious services to the Lord it's okay no it's not okay this thing is between you and God it's between husband and wife hallelujah her husband and bride or whatever my point is Amen I love for Jesus Christ my supersede our love for ourselves you can't even love yourself more than you love God and back to the flesh back to the veil back to this thing right here that we got to go beyond right oh come on you say ah let me say it like this you won't be the only one it doesn't justify you but Jonah says I ain't going to preach ain't gonna preach for Nineveh no I ain't goin God says okay we see that see about that you understand me and God allowed him to go the opposite way thinking thinking he was in his own mind I know what I'm gonna do and God took the very thing he thought he had control of and which that thing back around and here was now Jonah in the belly of a whale and God had to put him there just to get him to repent sometimes God has to put you in predicaments certain stack circumstances is it haha that's not where I want you I want you to go to Nineveh now imma show you how the man's disposition was way off key because we find out that when he got the Nineveh and preach he got mad with God because God saved him save Nineveh and Jonah gets mad God puts him under a place where the heat was of the day and put him on the gorge and the gorge went down and he got an attitude with God then he didn't make that gorge he God came and gave him shelter and that's what we do we have a problem with this veil because we think that this veil is something but let me tell you something when the life leaves out of it you're gonna realize it's nothing it's nothing but a hoe it's nothing but a thing that Lucifer allowed I put it this way help pervert to keep you and I from seeing heavenly things you said well old brother what are you saying you can even be on the battlefield of God and still be blind hmm [Applause] right says Lord open up gazes eyes he was in battle he seeks Amen that the enemy has a a mark more power than he does and that's what a lot of people think oh my god I just don't know what to do I can't overcome what you talking about the Bible said the aid of the Lord and kappab out those that fear and the Bible said God amen builds a wall of fire about you how can the devil touch you he can't because you're under the blood of Jesus but I'll say a flash blinds us to the reality of who we are this is why the prophet of God had to come so that we could see that we're not something other than God with rotation off of God we're piece of him hallelujah and the same power and the same ability that God has in him is within us but our vailed the sole flesh hinders us from seeing reality the doctors have no power over you nothing else power God said he whom the Sun is set free is free indeed and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty your mind blinds you blind in the mind that's where most of us are we can't believe that we're new creatures because of our veil help us Jesus but the Bible said we're new creatures in Christ I take the word I accept the word I don't have to be able to explain it I believe it because that's what he says I'm a new creature all things all things are passed away and behold everything has become new Holly I don't look back because they meant why are you looking back that man a woman's supposed to be dead by your tree is that right I think that was one of the things that Rome used to have used to punish people with thieves and Liars or whatever because what they would do is tie a dead man to his back and he had to walk with that dead man live with that dead man and eventually the dead man killed him by just inch the worms eating up a dead man and you can't get free it's like living in hell it's all right to see it that way it's the truth it's the truth and that's what happens to us when we don't have enough Holy Ghost it's like living in torment that means it a nicer way but that's the truth people say brother Brooks up but I'm trying to say that's the truth you and I don't want to be living in that position when God has made us free the joy of the Lord is our strength ha ha you gotta is his joy he gave us not that we got joy of our own he gave us his joy therefore it's our strain am i making sense oh god help us Lord you love the Lord see when the word quickens you we walk in the light it's such a beautiful light is that right but how are you walking in the light except the word quickens you the word was quicken you you can read this Bible all you want like I said the other service it lives but you what you can't read it intellectually and expect for you to get anything you gotta be prayed up you got to be in the spirit to understand the spirit you want to read this Bible hadn't even prayed you got to pray Lord open up the word give me revelation let it come off the pages live for me that's when God will open up things hallelujah but if you don't you think the con of mine is going to understand it just like a theologian trying to understand the word this is not an intellectual Bible this Bible was written supernatural and supernatural you must understand the supernaturally that's the only way right the Bible said you know if your kind of mind cannot understand those things are that of God they are spiritually discerned and therefore you've got to have the author of the book inside because the author know what is written he's the one that can explain it to you without that you're just trying to learn God in your mind and God was never meant to be learned in your mind he's the God of your heart that's why people are the way they are you know we're not even thinking about reflecting holy ego so reflecting God and that's supposed to be our walk every day reflecting the Lord Jesus and everything we do we ought to be reflecting the Lord Jesus but like I'm saying like this was in you what is being reflected right because whatever is being reflected from you is what's in you ye are the lights of the world city that sits upon a hill if the light of God is in you that light is being reflected if the light of God is not in you darkness is being reflected so you said well what do you mean brother books let me say it like this there are places where the Sun can shine and there are places where you can go and you can stay right underneath the shade right but God didn't intend for us to be under the shade he intends for us to be in the presence of the sign o Lord I know this is elementary but I've got to get it over because if we can get to this place where Paul says now there is no condemnation to those who walk not that of flesh but after the spirit is that right he goes on to say that God not only did he call us but he justified and he glorified us that shows that even from the foundation of the world God said us free and if we can't how how can I say like this it's it's just difficult for me to say what I'm trying to say because it's a revelation my point is this when we're free we're free so why would we feel how if you fearing hell it means that something's wrong with your experience a true born-again believer will not fear hell or going to hell because a true born-again believer knows that he can't go why he has an anchor his lash might be here but it's so love is behind the veil y'all understand me that's where I'm at my soul is over here and I have a anchor I have a connection amen a lot oh come on somebody I'm getting a little boo it's good to me Oh your brother looks are you crazy we're all just getting ready to go into a little bit of physics but we have a straight line a line connecting me here and there hallelujah and that anchor will always be able to pull me up when I die I don't go down I don't care how much this precious may Oh God I go up because I have an anchor there's a soul over there there's a man over there that's in my image and that image is in crisis image you understand hallelujah I'm in heavenly places right now in Christ Jesus and so are you of you born again you love the Lord I'm gonna go back to that mediator because I don't think we catching it I really don't listen you know when you go to the you got you at you you've got to go to court hey and you gonna worry you're gonna worry because I want to make sure I got the right attorney he's gotta be shrewd right right because I'm really I'm guilty and he's got to be shrewd enough he's got to know his business to get me out of this you gonna find that lawyer you're gonna find him because what he has a reputation he's got a good reputation that he whenever he becomes the attorney he knows how to work the system and he knows how to get you free you know we do have attorneys like that you can be as wrong as all get-out but they'll know how to work it to get you out free and you don't have to gamble with this attorney cuz this attorney hasn't fixed it so that he's not only the attorney but he's the jury and he suggests so we realize y'all don't y'all didn't let me tell y'all something what happened to me years ago when I was in Lima Ohio I was way down there in Amish country and an 18-wheeler got in front of me and that and the light was Green when I saw it but by the time the 18-wheeler cleared the intersection it was red and I was right behind the 18-wheeler where the police stopped me and I thought no no you can't and I mean he gave me a big ticket I said oh no I'm gonna fight this boy imma fight this T I did not know that I was going down to Mayberry y'all some of y'all in the world maybe that's when one man is the officer the office of the judge the jury what man holds all those offices and I went in there that man bout laughed at me hello did I did I win the case no you understand me and that's how it is with Jesus we're determine how it all goes out one man I think y'all get the picture now because you got to realize that's the way it is with you and when you know you've got such a system on your behalf working for you there's no way you can't get out of the situation it's already fixed y'all y'all remember Mayberry's our weight that's the way it is one of those little towns you're going this and where's the judge on the judge where's the sheriff I'm the sheriff where's the police I'm the police I gave you the ticket oh yeah so how you gonna win you can't you can't and that's how it is see the Lord had fixed that thing up that's why people to understand Calvary they think camera oh the Lamb of God he just died and hope somebody's gonna believe in him no show God doesn't run his program like that God knew before the foundation of the world who all would believe in him and the Bible said he wrote their names in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world that means I cannot be lost my name is already in the book so how do you know because I'm here now I am a vindication that my name was in the book because I'm believing the message of the hour today he knew I don't know thousands of the millions of people in this world they were gonna be one by the name of Isaiah Brooks you got to put your name in there there was one that would hear his voice because the Bible says my sheep heareth my voice and a strain that they will not follow so what what are we worried about well Oh none of us like to be naked none of us like to be destitute nobody really likes being poor but if it takes that to glorify Jesus Christ why not why not when you know that this is just only temporary when you know that when you die everything is leveled out you don't have nothing you ain't packing nothing with you when you know that your true identity is not in this flesh but in the one to come the real you this is not the real me maybe the yarn is veiled that's the real me inside but understand that the real me is sitting right now in heavenly places in Christ Jesus so when you die you ain't got a world Lord I'm seeing I've got so many things oh my god huh Lord I'm about ready to die what's gonna happen to me that's nonsense you don't have to fear death when you truly say if you really believe that his blood cleansed you if you really believe that his sacrifice was enough hallelujah it's not the blood plus it's the blood you need the blood pressure religion or blood plus your righteousness because your righteousness and my righteousness is like filthy rags y'all I can't tell you and I know some of y'all think I'm not gonna worry about what you think but i'ma say it like this you gonna need it cuz I'm telling you it ain't gonna get no easier it's getting ready to get rough far more rougher than it is now and you're gonna need where you're gonna need to know that you're standing on solid ground ain't about what you're gonna do you say well what do you mean brother let me say it like that Peter denied Jesus three times cursed about it and God still had him preaching on the day of Pentecost Moses killed the man how many of y'all would have followed Moses exile from Egypt and God used him to be that one of the greatest it's ever lived huh think about it think about everybody seem like they did something David you know what he did and David was not only a an adulterer but David a man killed people just killed him slaughter he had so much blood on his hand God says you can't you can't build my temple you got too much blood in your hand you should hold Brotherhood's what are you saying what I'm trying to say is this in order to maintain your joy you've got an already maintain your freedom you understand what I'm saying in order to maintain your joy you got to realize that this is just a whim this is something that's gonna pass this is like to say this too will pass it's going to pass but while it's here I'm gonna glorify my god huh the Peter James and John thrown into prison why me Lord whatever that's wasn't that kind of song and you know that's what we do some bad something come and guess what we do that garden failed us God hasn't failed us the trying of your faith is more precious than gold let's pray that your faith fail not let's show the devil a man an enemy miserable y'all think I don't have trials I got more stuff goin coming at me now than ever you know I felt like you know you see those old kind of movies and they know how to kung-fu or whatever they call that stuff to be doing fighting enemies they flying through the air and everything else and they still whipping them I got so many Devils coming at me it's okay cuz I got the real Superman on the inside and that's Jesus Christ you love the Lord oh it's gonna calm but right now the greatest battle ever fought you gotta know who you are in your heart in order to feed the devil in this lest an and the powers in whose name nobody named but Jesus Christ at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow every tongue shall come fast I can tell you know then I could never get tired of that name Jesus even when I hear sinister if they glorifying Jesus it makes me feel so good even when they said oh you know God has been good to me and I know I'm like oh yeah I know he has you know God is good to everybody sinner and Saint people eat at the table don't even bless their food don't even know that poisoning could be in it and God spared them lives their lives because he's protecting them you and I are so blessed we think about how God in his in his eye I don't even know whether I got the message over tonight all I know is I tried to reach it like he wanted me to preach him but you know when it comes to the simplicity of the word we have come to a place we can't can't handle it somebody said well you know I heard somebody say this not long ago said it was it was the man he he drank milk and and the lamb he drank milk but when it comes to the ego he that's all he eat is meat well Jesus was a lion in a lamb he drank milk and he ate meat and a man drank milk he eat me Embree he's a combination of all but a lot of time people just just the simplicity is the thing that's gonna get you you know you say brother what are you saying I'm trying to say like when when brother Branham came when he was here and when God used him in the way he used this is ambition his desire was for people to see Christ see Jesus more than anything don't look at me I want you to see Jesus because he's the one could save he's the one that healed he's the one that delivers and as long as you stay with the word of God you will see Jesus sir because now he's unveiled he's in a group of people right now with their intent or their desire to show that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today forever if that's not your ambition I think a lot of time we want to just live and you know get houses and cars and find clothes and all that is good the witnessed earth began to burn with fire all that's going just like in the Philippines I saw on the news the other day I turned I excuse me volcano has erupted people house is being destroyed I wonder how much money and time they put in building that house and just you know one moment and it's gone do y'all think you you understand when California goes off and we don't know whether we go to be here or not but I really believe that we will for a moment because I believe that at the time California goes off it will also be the resurrection of the dead because there was a great earthquake when Jesus rose from the dead and I believe that great earthquake that's mentioned in the back of Revelation also is the great rail our earthquake that you and I will experience when the dead is raised and you saw a brother books ha what's gonna happen when all these see when that when the world is in such a chaotic condition they'll never know who's missing they'll never know parties will be disappearing and you know you say well well I heard some I said it's gonna be a lot of I don't know how many I just know I'm one of them that's all I know and I just want to encourage everybody to know that you wanted them I'm not gonna believe anything I told the devil the other day I said you know what devil I've come too far I've suffered too many things I've gone through so many things ain't no way well I'm right here almost at the finish line and you want me to back up it ain't happening it ain't happen I don't care if I'm the only one [Music] don't make me no difference I had no heaven is real and I know health is my home and I know I don't believe late long inhale I didn't come from there and I ain't going there y'all understand me and that's the way you gotta see things it's Homecoming time homegoing time and I know right now Christians are falling everywhere you see Christians are now being so distracted they're doing everything but serving God and witnessing for God but that's the time when God come he's an icon how're you think father we come before you thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord you have been better to us too we've been to ourselves keep our eyes set on Jesus Lord let not our faith fail father thank you Father for the message and the messenger Lord what we would have done without it we know Lord Jesus is because of your plane that you sent him and you sent him for us you sent him for me and all I ask in your name Jesus is that you give us grace grace to live the way we should and the way that would be pleasing in your sight then at the end of the day there'll be no trouble at the river you'll be able to say well done my good and things Lord we realized there's nothing in ourselves we this plan is a plan of your salvation [Music] we say Lord that you're perfect the divine will be done all of that we still would give you the globe beyond into praise Jesus Christ [Music] God's grace grace died is greater [Music] this gray so loud the grace that
