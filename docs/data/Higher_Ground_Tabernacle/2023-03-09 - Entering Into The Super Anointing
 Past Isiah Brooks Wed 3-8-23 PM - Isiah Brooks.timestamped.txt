[46:22] of God
[46:24] yes sir
[46:30] God is good
[46:34] he's worthy to be praised
[46:39] as we stand we'll
[46:42] ask that you turn with us to Saint John
[46:44] 15.
[46:46] we read the fifth verse there
[46:50] Saint John 15.
[46:59] and it reads I am the Vine
[47:02] ye are the branches
[47:05] he that abided in me and I in him
[47:09] the same bringeth forth much fruit amen
[47:13] for without me ye can do nothing amen
[47:19] I just want to thank God for the reading
[47:21] of the word
[47:22] amen amen you may be seated
[47:27] you love the Lord
[47:30] amen amen we appreciate
[47:33] uh brother Keith he had the filters
[47:36] changed and
[47:38] I don't know whether you know how fresh
[47:40] you smell between
[47:41] Crystal and brother Keith is smelling
[47:43] pretty good up in here
[47:46] and all I can say is that I can please
[47:51] I don't feel this funny thing you know
[47:53] so that's where it must have been
[47:54] brother
[47:55] so I thank God for all that you do
[47:58] everybody amen every man the Lord is
[48:01] good to us
[48:03] amen I know we're going to make this
[48:05] announcement not many people here but
[48:07] you know I'm gonna make an announcement
[48:09] that uh we're not giving out no more
[48:11] water
[48:13] if people want water bring it from home
[48:18] yeah then if you leave your bottle of
[48:20] water is your bottle
[48:24] because we've been finding a lot of half
[48:26] dranked Waters
[48:29] I mean I've had reports I think six or
[48:31] seven and then brother uh different ones
[48:34] I don't want to call them names because
[48:35] we don't want to get you in trouble
[48:40] but you know it's sad
[48:43] that uh we we can be so wasteful
[48:47] and I guarantee you if we bought those
[48:49] mini bottles they're still going to be
[48:51] wasteful
[48:55] so bring your own water
[48:57] those brothers who do the musicians you
[49:00] know we know where we can hide them
[49:04] only for the musicians and the song
[49:05] leaders
[49:06] you understand me
[49:08] so if if bottles are left behind we know
[49:11] which one who it is that's Lena
[49:14] you love the Lord
[49:16] God is good to us and I want to thank
[49:19] God for his Amazing Grace amen
[49:22] my wife and I was talking today
[49:24] sometimes God heals you and you don't
[49:26] even know he's it's already done
[49:29] and uh you know just the other day I'm
[49:31] like where's the sniffle you know I
[49:34] haven't used my spray and God knows when
[49:36] and so God totally healed me and then
[49:39] I'm late on his praise but I want to
[49:42] praise the Lord for taking whatever that
[49:44] was out of my science and everything
[49:47] else and I just want to give him glory
[49:49] by the grace of God
[49:52] some of you have been perhaps seeing on
[49:54] the YouTube that there has there has
[49:57] been a great anointing
[49:59] being poured out on the worldly churches
[50:03] and everybody's saying that they are in
[50:06] a Revival
[50:07] but my question would be what are there
[50:10] being revived to
[50:13] see Revival brings you to the word
[50:17] amen it is not a musical Revival and
[50:20] it's not not just an emotional Revival
[50:23] Revival brings you to a change it brings
[50:27] you into a new life
[50:30] but we know what the prophet of God said
[50:32] he talks about it he said when the
[50:34] anointing began to fall on the worldly
[50:37] churches he said they'll believe that
[50:39] they're having a Revival
[50:41] he said and at that time that's when the
[50:44] Rapture would take place
[50:46] he said that same anointing will bring
[50:48] them into the mark of the beast
[50:51] but the anointing and I mean it's the
[50:53] real anointing
[50:54] it will take us in a rapture
[50:57] so we thank God and we praise the Lord
[51:00] uh for all that is being done
[51:04] and one thing for certain I get excited
[51:07] I really get excited
[51:09] because they are doing their part
[51:16] right
[51:17] and we've learned through the message of
[51:19] the hour
[51:20] that
[51:22] salvation does not
[51:25] depend on your organization or your
[51:28] denomination
[51:30] uh it's not your group that's going to
[51:34] go into the rapture
[51:36] we understand that God has an economy
[51:40] and in that economy he has a penny he
[51:43] has a nickel's worth a dime's worth a
[51:46] quarter's worth 50 cents worth and then
[51:49] a dollar
[51:50] and each one of those uh uh money values
[51:55] or values of money plays a part in the
[51:58] economy of God
[52:00] we don't know who's all going to be
[52:02] saved and we don't know who all will be
[52:04] bride
[52:05] but we do know that in the Book of
[52:09] Revelation
[52:11] God speaks of a number
[52:13] that no man can number
[52:15] and you know in the Book of Revelation
[52:18] the Bible says uh what are these
[52:22] uh but if it was an individual thing he
[52:27] would ask who are these or he would put
[52:30] it in a different way but we find out
[52:32] that in this this this revealing of the
[52:35] word we find out that uh the the foolish
[52:39] virgins
[52:40] uh they are from every Kindred every
[52:44] every nation every tongue but they come
[52:47] through great tribulations
[52:49] amen but the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[52:52] receiving her purging now she's being
[52:55] cleansed and and by the grace of God she
[52:59] has received the grace of God by the
[53:02] word of God of this hour amen even as
[53:06] they are being anointed I want you to
[53:08] understand
[53:09] that we know that there will come a
[53:11] Mount Zion Showdown
[53:13] even as it was in the days of the Exodus
[53:17] of Moses you had a resistance that was
[53:20] and they were called Jenners and jambres
[53:22] which represented the organizations of
[53:25] the day but understand that Janice and
[53:28] jambres had an anointing
[53:31] but Moses had a super anointing amen and
[53:34] we understand that it was his anointing
[53:36] that literally swallowed up the serpents
[53:39] of Janice and jambres so God in this
[53:42] last day has promised us a super
[53:45] anointing not just an anointing and this
[53:47] is why I have always been just somewhat
[53:50] irritated at the what I see people
[53:54] calling the anointing or the presence of
[53:57] the Lord and you know how it's so
[53:59] relaxed
[54:01] it is a mature thing but it it it it
[54:04] what comes with it I I heard uh our
[54:07] brother isai say the other day down in
[54:10] Iowa City if the Supernatural is not
[54:14] with you you're not even the church
[54:18] and I thought wow that's powerful
[54:21] yet it is true
[54:23] amen right but listen the false Vine
[54:27] they are producing the supernatural
[54:30] how y'all got quiet on that but they
[54:33] have a faith
[54:36] and the and the god that we serve is the
[54:39] same God in which they serve or let me
[54:43] put this way the god that we serve is
[54:45] literally giving Thee the response to
[54:48] their faith
[54:50] because listen only God can heal
[54:53] God can deliver amen and only God can
[54:56] change
[54:58] right but we understand that everybody
[55:01] has a place and everybody is not bride
[55:05] amen Hallelujah and you and I must be
[55:10] certain
[55:11] that we are
[55:14] the Bible said lest we come short
[55:17] of the glory of God Amen
[55:19] entering into the super super anointing
[55:25] the same super
[55:27] natural God working in his Supernatural
[55:31] Church
[55:32] and when we're talking about a
[55:34] supernatural Church we're not talking
[55:36] about a group of people
[55:38] in other words we're not talking about
[55:40] Higher Ground and Higher Ground only
[55:43] or whatever your name or your church is
[55:46] that's not what God is dealing with
[55:48] God has always dealt with individual
[55:51] woes amen hallelujah but we are called
[55:56] this evening we'll call to to to live up
[56:00] to the truth that we have obtained amen
[56:03] amen right God didn't give us this
[56:05] measure of the word for it to lay
[56:08] dormant amen amen we understand that and
[56:12] the word of God is not the word of God
[56:15] until it becomes Dynamite
[56:18] right the mechanics it's not the
[56:22] mechanics is the word it's the letter
[56:23] and the Bible said the letter killeth
[56:26] but it's the spirit that gives life amen
[56:29] amen and so therefore the truth that we
[56:31] have received that which we have
[56:33] obtained and in all of us are moving
[56:37] forward I trust amen
[56:40] amen hallelujah amen because Paul even
[56:42] said I haven't obtained it yet
[56:45] see but he was pressing toward the mark
[56:48] of a high calling which is in Christ
[56:51] amen in other words he was pursuing his
[56:54] goal amen he was Reaching Forward for a
[56:58] to a higher plane and I don't believe
[57:02] that God
[57:04] allowed this church to be called Higher
[57:07] Ground
[57:07] because I believe that it was an
[57:09] inspiration that was given to the early
[57:12] uh people of the church but it wasn't
[57:15] supposed to stop Higher Ground means
[57:18] that a level that you continue to climb
[57:21] amen and when we come to that place
[57:23] where God wants us to be amen we can
[57:28] express
[57:29] without with confidence that we are
[57:32] Christians amen who have achieved a
[57:35] higher level of God Amen amen right but
[57:39] I read that word I am the vine ye are
[57:42] the branches
[57:43] Hallelujah he that abideth in me and I
[57:46] in them the same bringeth forth much
[57:48] fruit for without meat you can do
[57:52] nothing
[57:53] amen now when it comes to abiding that
[57:57] word means to remain
[57:59] or stay
[58:02] and when you see it in the context of
[58:04] this of the scripture Saint John 5 15 5
[58:08] the vine and the branch is connected
[58:12] they're living from the same Source or
[58:15] off the same source and that source
[58:18] source is Jesus Christ or God himself
[58:21] is that right see God is God and all and
[58:26] he will always remain God Amen amen but
[58:29] if if we're connected
[58:32] to the source of life it will bring life
[58:36] into US amen right you can be an iron
[58:40] you know or any type of uh electronics
[58:44] and all of the electrical powers
[58:47] everything that is that makes the iron
[58:50] ore or or a refrigerator or a stove
[58:54] it's functionable they're working they
[58:57] work
[58:57] but if you don't plug it up
[59:00] if you don't connect it to the Life
[59:02] Source which we call electricity
[59:06] it would just sit there dormant
[59:09] and that's what's wrong with a lot of
[59:11] Christians they're sitting there they
[59:13] they're equipped to bring forth the fire
[59:16] but they are not connected to the source
[59:19] that will put them on fire
[59:22] amen so we need some connection
[59:25] and I realize by the grace of God the
[59:29] connection I'm talking about just does
[59:31] not come by just a nice church service
[59:33] no no
[59:36] Hallelujah
[59:38] the Bible says that God would rather us
[59:41] be hot
[59:42] a cold
[59:44] and to be lukewarm
[59:48] is not something that God enjoys about a
[59:53] Christian
[59:55] is that right amen I I like a hot cup of
[59:58] tea
[59:59] and I like a cold glass of water
[1:00:02] but I don't like lukewarm water
[1:00:05] it may be the same but it's something
[1:00:06] about it that just doesn't satisfy
[1:00:10] The Taste and The Thirst
[1:00:13] so is it with God God wants on fire
[1:00:16] Christians now uh you know my thing is
[1:00:18] this I have not yet attained
[1:00:22] but I'm pressing toward the Mark
[1:00:25] I'm looking for this super nothing
[1:00:28] because people of God in this age you
[1:00:31] need the super anointing amen we didn't
[1:00:34] even know that there was one
[1:00:36] man until brother Burnham taught us how
[1:00:39] that God placed him in a super anointing
[1:00:41] amen when those squares were created
[1:00:44] he said when that anointed came it
[1:00:47] almost knocked him off his feet and he
[1:00:50] talks about it how when he was there
[1:00:52] with with Hattie Wright and how that
[1:00:55] super anointing struck him again and
[1:00:58] from those times from and since uh from
[1:01:01] that time brother Branham always looked
[1:01:03] for the super anointed amen he was never
[1:01:06] a the same again because he saw God and
[1:01:09] felt God and understood God in a way he
[1:01:12] had never
[1:01:13] seen a Felton before and so he you watch
[1:01:17] it after after those events took place
[1:01:19] in in the latter tapes before he went
[1:01:21] off the scene he was always looking for
[1:01:24] that super anointing amen
[1:01:26] Hallelujah glory to God but I know where
[1:01:30] the super anointing is supposed to come
[1:01:32] on those who call themselves Elisha
[1:01:35] Elisha right she got a double apportion
[1:01:39] of the anointing and I believe that is
[1:01:43] the anointing God wants us to enter into
[1:01:47] Hallelujah
[1:01:49] amen see when God gives us a promise he
[1:01:53] can't go back off of the a promise now
[1:01:55] people it is not something you and I can
[1:01:59] manufacture
[1:02:01] it is God who gives it
[1:02:03] Hallelujah but one thing God requires
[1:02:07] and that is a Sanctified life
[1:02:10] a life a man that's sacred to you is
[1:02:13] sacred to God he looks for a life that's
[1:02:16] separated from the world is that right
[1:02:19] somebody who's giving themselves holy
[1:02:22] unto the Lord and when we give ourselves
[1:02:25] holy to the Lord God will give himself
[1:02:27] holy to us is that right and this is
[1:02:31] what we're pressing into amen
[1:02:34] Paul said I'm crucified with Christ
[1:02:37] nevertheless it's not I that live but
[1:02:41] Christ that lives in me and Paul said
[1:02:43] listen I crucify the old man on a daily
[1:02:47] basis Hallelujah I can't serve God just
[1:02:51] one day I've got to serve him every day
[1:02:53] when I wake up in the morning I have to
[1:02:57] crucify this flesh now people I'm
[1:02:59] telling you as a human being is not so
[1:03:02] easy
[1:03:04] hello but it is a laboring it is
[1:03:08] oppressing it is a pushing because we
[1:03:12] know by God's grace as we try to push
[1:03:15] forward Satan is trying to pull us
[1:03:17] backwards Hallelujah but if the Lord be
[1:03:22] on your side y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:03:24] when God is on your side All Things
[1:03:28] become possible what I'm learning is to
[1:03:32] always keep a positive attitude
[1:03:35] hallelujah look at Job the devil tried
[1:03:38] to bring job into a negative attitude
[1:03:40] but no matter what trial he went through
[1:03:43] he blessed the Lord hallelujah he went
[1:03:47] on to say the lord giveth and the lord
[1:03:49] taketh away blessed be the name of the
[1:03:51] Lord
[1:03:52] amen naked I came into this world and
[1:03:54] naked I'll leave out Hallelujah he
[1:03:57] realized God was always in control no
[1:04:01] matter how negative things became it
[1:04:03] came into his life he understood God was
[1:04:07] his God and he understood
[1:04:10] amen the blood the sacrifice of the Lamb
[1:04:14] amen hallelujah
[1:04:16] I often say to God I say to the Lord
[1:04:19] Jesus I don't care what it takes
[1:04:24] do it Lord
[1:04:25] if I've got to suffer do it
[1:04:29] whatever is takes
[1:04:31] for me to make this rapture
[1:04:34] do it for me bring it on Lord I don't
[1:04:38] want to come short Hallelujah I know
[1:04:41] he's God
[1:04:42] and he'll never change but I also know
[1:04:46] there is criteria there's a criteria
[1:04:48] there's a mandate that God is requiring
[1:04:50] of us and no man in here can do it
[1:04:54] Hallelujah because none of us can add
[1:04:57] one cubit to our stature the Bible says
[1:05:00] it's not him that willeth nor he that
[1:05:02] runeth but God who shows mercy and
[1:05:04] that's why I'll be asking God give me
[1:05:06] the mercy give me the grace of this hour
[1:05:09] to press through all of this darkness
[1:05:12] and you and I know this is the darkest
[1:05:16] we've ever seen it
[1:05:18] most Christians don't even know what's
[1:05:20] going on but those of us who have our
[1:05:23] eyes open may God keep your eyes and
[1:05:26] heart open
[1:05:28] Hallelujah don't lose sight of the hour
[1:05:30] that we're living in hallelujah it's the
[1:05:34] problem God said go ahead and plant your
[1:05:36] potatoes but always keep your eyes and
[1:05:39] looking at Jesus amen hallelujah
[1:05:43] right he told Abraham he said he would
[1:05:47] possess the Gate of his enemy think
[1:05:49] about it
[1:05:50] and so a man by the name of Shem God
[1:05:53] y'all believe that amen who look at the
[1:05:56] odds against him God only needed one man
[1:06:01] just to let him get one man in his hand
[1:06:04] and the world would think he's crazy but
[1:06:07] he would drive home the gospel when he
[1:06:11] thoroughly convinced that Jesus Christ
[1:06:13] remained the same yesterday today and
[1:06:16] forever Hallelujah unto anything else he
[1:06:20] will stand true and go on because he
[1:06:23] thoroughly convinced that God is God
[1:06:26] Amen see when you're convinced that he's
[1:06:28] God you realize amen everything is going
[1:06:32] to be all right yes sir Hallelujah
[1:06:36] if he ever was God
[1:06:39] he's still God if he isn't the God he
[1:06:42] was he never was God that's right he is
[1:06:46] the infinite God the all-powerful God
[1:06:49] Almighty omnipotent omniscient in in
[1:06:53] infinite oh my he's he is God he's the
[1:06:57] same God that opened the Red Sea he's
[1:07:00] the same God that brought Daniel out the
[1:07:02] Lion's Den he's the same God that
[1:07:04] brought the Hebrew children from the
[1:07:06] fiery furnace the Hallelujah he's the
[1:07:09] same God that raised up Jesus Christ on
[1:07:12] Easter morning he's the same God that
[1:07:14] fell on the day of Pentecost he's the
[1:07:17] same God that raised Lazarus out of the
[1:07:19] Grave he's the same yesterday today and
[1:07:22] forever and I'm convinced that this is
[1:07:24] the Holy Ghost
[1:07:27] Hallelujah that's why the devil don't
[1:07:29] want us to get the Holy Ghost hallelujah
[1:07:33] oh my you know what the Holy Ghost is is
[1:07:36] when God receives you
[1:07:38] it's not when you receive it is when God
[1:07:41] receives you amen so when God receives
[1:07:44] you he gives you the Holy Ghost
[1:07:47] Hallelujah listen
[1:07:49] you and I must understand as individuals
[1:07:52] we we're fighting
[1:07:54] and and I we're pursuing
[1:07:57] this Mark this perfection
[1:08:00] y'all hear what I'm saying we're running
[1:08:02] after it we want it
[1:08:04] you know we're like Jacob give me the
[1:08:07] birthright I need this Holy Ghost I
[1:08:10] don't care if I got a wrestle with an
[1:08:12] angel I need this Perfection law see he
[1:08:16] pursued it yes
[1:08:17] Hallelujah and how did he pursue it down
[1:08:20] on his knees he wrestled with the angel
[1:08:23] of the Lord says I'm going to let you go
[1:08:25] until you bless me and you know when the
[1:08:27] anointing of God come in your prayer
[1:08:29] life don't you leave it stay right there
[1:08:32] till he bless you
[1:08:34] take all the worldly thoughts and ideas
[1:08:36] out of my life Lord remove all the lust
[1:08:39] of the flesh the lust of the eye of the
[1:08:41] pride of life move all of this world and
[1:08:44] this out of me that I may be made whole
[1:08:47] Lord hallelujah that I might please you
[1:08:49] see God don't take an idol he takes a
[1:08:53] man and if he if a man will prostrate
[1:08:56] himself in the presence of God God puts
[1:08:59] himself in the man and the man becomes
[1:09:03] the living creature that God is living
[1:09:05] in amen not a dead Idol but a man God
[1:09:10] never use Idols he always used man and
[1:09:14] God wants to use you yes every one of us
[1:09:17] in here God wants to use you let me tell
[1:09:20] you what it may not be something like
[1:09:22] what Moses did parting the Red Sea it
[1:09:25] may be just as simple as carrying a few
[1:09:27] loaves of bread and fish
[1:09:30] Hallelujah it may be babies like that
[1:09:33] old widow woman
[1:09:38] what we call great God called
[1:09:41] foolishness Hallelujah yes but God sees
[1:09:46] the little things
[1:09:47] come on somebody Oh Glory to God is that
[1:09:51] all right
[1:09:52] yes Lord amen
[1:09:54] amen you see God uses a man and man only
[1:09:58] God doesn't use Machinery he doesn't use
[1:10:01] groups of men
[1:10:03] God doesn't use organization God uses
[1:10:07] individuals always in some reason we get
[1:10:11] into this message we think oh God gonna
[1:10:14] oh no no even in this
[1:10:18] God used individuals amen amen because
[1:10:21] everybody is not on the same level
[1:10:24] hello there's a kind of Christian
[1:10:27] there's a make-believer there's a
[1:10:29] Believer and there's the unbeliever and
[1:10:31] they all come to message churches
[1:10:33] Hallelujah
[1:10:35] it's the truth
[1:10:36] Hallelujah this message came to prepare
[1:10:39] the bride she is being tried in her
[1:10:44] faithfulness
[1:10:45] to the revealed word did you know that
[1:10:48] this is the testing ground
[1:10:51] that's why we came here God came to try
[1:10:54] us
[1:10:55] and the Bride Comes to be tested will
[1:10:58] she stand on everywhere yes she will
[1:11:02] Hallelujah why because she has a
[1:11:04] revelation in her soul that the word is
[1:11:08] still God
[1:11:10] Hallelujah I may not understand every
[1:11:13] every word of this message I may not but
[1:11:16] I believe every bit of it Hallelujah and
[1:11:19] I know that the word of God is the word
[1:11:21] of God and nobody can change it
[1:11:25] Hallelujah
[1:11:27] Hallelujah you can be ignorant as a rock
[1:11:30] but you might know Jesus if you know
[1:11:33] Jesus Hallelujah you're greater than the
[1:11:36] greatest man in the world
[1:11:37] is that right Hallelujah you look at all
[1:11:41] those great Pharisees and Sadducees that
[1:11:43] was in the days of John and John didn't
[1:11:46] hear the lick couldn't hear the lick
[1:11:47] when it came to ABCs Hallelujah he knew
[1:11:51] nothing about education but he had God
[1:11:54] that's right amen and God said by the
[1:11:57] way of Jesus Christ he said there was
[1:11:59] not a prophet greater than John the
[1:12:02] Baptist Hallelujah he was greater than
[1:12:05] Herod
[1:12:07] he was greater than the Pharisees
[1:12:09] greater than the Sadducees see the world
[1:12:12] looked down on him but God lifted him up
[1:12:16] Hallelujah is that right that's what God
[1:12:19] the world may look down on you but in
[1:12:21] the eyes of God you lifted huh amen
[1:12:25] hallelujah absolutely
[1:12:28] man that's why Moses chose not to be
[1:12:30] called the pharaoh's daughter he
[1:12:32] understood that what he was dealing with
[1:12:34] he knew that Pharaoh was just the king
[1:12:36] of Egypt but the God he met
[1:12:40] amen was God of pharaoh in the whole
[1:12:43] world
[1:12:43] is that right
[1:12:45] see we must understand that it comes to
[1:12:48] prepare us we we can't help but to
[1:12:50] suffer suffering is part of it Jesus
[1:12:53] suffered we have to suffer but we want
[1:12:55] to suffer for righteousness sake now not
[1:12:58] for either doing right preparing the
[1:13:00] bride means she learns to be faithful
[1:13:03] and obedient to the word you must learn
[1:13:06] how to be faithful that means you die
[1:13:09] out you make a mistake but now I know
[1:13:12] now Lord what I should do the next time
[1:13:13] right that's the way that's what listen
[1:13:16] abiding you know when you abide in him
[1:13:20] that means you're in him and he's in you
[1:13:23] right in that day you know I'm in the
[1:13:25] Father the fathers and me and I am in
[1:13:27] you amen right there's a union there
[1:13:29] that cannot be broken Hallelujah
[1:13:32] there's a union there yes sir abiding in
[1:13:35] him staying in there and let me tell you
[1:13:37] what we used to say that old song in
[1:13:40] that old Pentecostal Church

[1:13:48] Jesus come stay there stay there be

[1:14:09] in the word of God I've got to hide in
[1:14:13] place hallelujah amen and that's where
[1:14:17] we we hide in the word of God Amen I
[1:14:21] gotta hide in place and you know that's
[1:14:23] I'll stay there stay there
[1:14:27] Hallelujah in the word of God yes sir
[1:14:31] when when Satan brings what we call the
[1:14:35] impossible and he loves to do that and
[1:14:38] because he works with our natural senses
[1:14:40] and he tells us that this is impossible
[1:14:43] and and usually when he brings it
[1:14:46] impossible to us if we're not spiritual
[1:14:49] we'll feel overwhelmed and overcome
[1:14:52] Hallelujah but listen we cannot be
[1:14:55] overcome because he's the Overcomer
[1:14:58] Hallelujah and listen when he comes in
[1:15:01] that way the Bible says already when
[1:15:04] Satan comes in like a flood
[1:15:07] we don't know where the flood is like
[1:15:09] those let's say like let's when Satan
[1:15:11] comes in like a tsunami
[1:15:15] God will lift the standard amen
[1:15:19] amen hallelujah and you know what
[1:15:21] everybody that's escaped their tsunami
[1:15:24] usually they run to Higher Ground
[1:15:26] [Laughter]
[1:15:29] hallelujah amen a higher place where the
[1:15:33] tsunami can't reach him Hallelujah you
[1:15:36] love the Lord absolutely and so when
[1:15:39] when when the impossible is presented to
[1:15:42] her she doesn't consider the
[1:15:45] circumstances
[1:15:48] you know it's like the woman with the
[1:15:49] issue of blood
[1:15:51] she couldn't consider the circumstances
[1:15:53] and she had done tried everything she
[1:15:55] knew how to try and everything failed
[1:15:58] but she heard about Jesus see she got
[1:16:01] you hear what I'm saying you got to have
[1:16:03] the Revelation that he is God
[1:16:06] and when you call on him he will answer
[1:16:08] prayer amen y'all hear what I'm saying I
[1:16:12] know it's tough
[1:16:13] it's never been easy for a real
[1:16:15] Christian
[1:16:16] Hallelujah but a real Christian we we
[1:16:19] fight the battle
[1:16:22] brother random said it like this he said
[1:16:24] when they gonna when we get to heaven
[1:16:26] they're going to ask you
[1:16:27] what age you you were in and
[1:16:31] then he said when we tell them we came
[1:16:33] out of laity or they're going to say how
[1:16:36] [Laughter]
[1:16:38] how did you come out of the Legacy
[1:16:41] hallelujah how did you make it there's
[1:16:44] only one way I know the Bible said they
[1:16:47] overcame about the blood of the lamb and
[1:16:51] the word of their testimony you've got
[1:16:54] to have some testimonies Hallelujah you
[1:16:57] got to be tried you got to be tested
[1:16:59] Hallelujah this is part of the program
[1:17:02] you've got to go through it in order to
[1:17:05] have a testimony oh you hear what I'm
[1:17:08] saying David said yay when that lion
[1:17:11] tried to kill me Hallelujah God gave me
[1:17:14] Victory yes sir so when the bear tried I
[1:17:17] slew the Bell because God gave me
[1:17:20] victory over the lion Hallelujah Goliath
[1:17:23] and you are next yes sir yes sir I know
[1:17:28] what God can do I have a testimony that
[1:17:32] the God that I serve he is God
[1:17:35] talk about a super Dante
[1:17:38] Hallelujah
[1:17:41] yes
[1:17:43] when the impossible is presented to her
[1:17:45] she doesn't consider the circumstances
[1:17:47] no does she consider the impossibilities
[1:17:51] because we have been taught
[1:17:53] all things are possible Amen to them
[1:17:56] that believe
[1:17:59] amen God don't fail
[1:18:01] he's never failed
[1:18:03] and all things are possible amen Amen to
[1:18:07] them that believe
[1:18:09] she is she believes in so much she is
[1:18:12] honed into the word of God can I say it
[1:18:16] like this she is so hone she's connected
[1:18:19] to the headstone
[1:18:22] and The Headstone is the Cornerstone and
[1:18:25] the Cornerstone is the hair Stone
[1:18:28] Hallelujah glory to God is that right
[1:18:32] God sometimes asks us to do some of the
[1:18:34] most impossible things and some of the
[1:18:36] things that we we just cannot understand
[1:18:38] that's why it takes faith
[1:18:40] Hallelujah you're saved by faith
[1:18:45] faith in the word
[1:18:47] right Luke 1 35-38 let's talk about it a
[1:18:51] little bit
[1:18:53] and the angel said unto her
[1:18:56] he talking to Mary
[1:18:57] the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and
[1:19:00] the power of the highest
[1:19:02] shall overshadow thee now you can't tell
[1:19:04] me that wasn't a super anointing it
[1:19:07] doesn't say that
[1:19:09] but I guarantee you there was something
[1:19:13] Supernatural that made Mary known
[1:19:16] that what he had just spoken
[1:19:19] just happened
[1:19:21] therefore also the holy thing which
[1:19:23] shall be born of thee shall be called
[1:19:26] the son of God
[1:19:29] and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she have
[1:19:32] also conceived a son in her old age and
[1:19:35] this is the sixth month with her who was
[1:19:38] called barren for with God nothing shall
[1:19:43] be impossible
[1:19:46] not with God nothing shall be impossible
[1:19:49] and marriage said behold the handmaiden
[1:19:53] of the Lord be it unto me
[1:19:57] that's what I say tonight Lord be it
[1:19:59] unto me according to Thy word and the
[1:20:03] angel departed from her what was it
[1:20:07] you don't have to understand it
[1:20:11] you just need to submit and believe it
[1:20:14] I don't know how I'm going to be
[1:20:16] translated
[1:20:19] I don't know there's no record of how
[1:20:23] it's going to happen
[1:20:25] but I believe it
[1:20:27] I receive it I accept it amen I don't
[1:20:30] even know I told the Lord I said I don't
[1:20:32] even know why
[1:20:33] I said I really don't know why you use
[1:20:35] me
[1:20:37] Hallelujah and then the Lord brought me
[1:20:40] to the message as I would as I was with
[1:20:42] Moses how God told in that message says
[1:20:46] God wasn't concerned about Moses
[1:20:48] mistakes
[1:20:49] he was concerned about the commission
[1:20:51] that's right and you got to understand
[1:20:53] God knows you're going to make mistakes
[1:20:55] but you have a commission amen you have
[1:20:59] a goal and that goal is to bring Christ
[1:21:02] on the inside so he can perfect you
[1:21:06] bring you to a place of rapturing right
[1:21:09] amen hallelujah you're gonna make
[1:21:12] mistakes
[1:21:13] but in Christ I've got to hide in place
[1:21:17] is that right my life is hid in Christ
[1:21:22] so is your life
[1:21:24] right
[1:21:25] the story of the little dishwasher y'all
[1:21:27] remember that
[1:21:29] but listen this is what the Bible tells
[1:21:31] us according to Psalms 23 and 5 5-6 is
[1:21:34] his thou prepared a table before me in
[1:21:37] the presence of my enemies thou anointed
[1:21:40] my head with oil my cup runneth over now
[1:21:45] come on
[1:21:46] that cup running over is anointing
[1:21:49] that's an anointing and just not a
[1:21:52] little bit
[1:21:53] amen it's running over
[1:21:55] hello
[1:21:58] you know if that anointing is on you you
[1:22:00] just don't sit still
[1:22:03] amen it does something amen amen mainly
[1:22:06] on the inside but if it's doing the work
[1:22:09] on the inside it's surely going to show
[1:22:11] on the outside
[1:22:13] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:22:15] me
[1:22:16] all the days of my life I like that
[1:22:19] because here David says you prepared the
[1:22:22] table before me in the presence of my
[1:22:25] enemies you set this up
[1:22:30] Hallelujah you set this up amen
[1:22:34] hallelujah but in the setting up you
[1:22:37] anointed me
[1:22:39] amen David understood that he saw
[1:22:42] Goliath he was going out to give his
[1:22:44] brothers food but God prepared a table
[1:22:47] for him he didn't know he had to battle
[1:22:49] Goliath when he woke up this morning
[1:22:51] that morning Goliath was on his mind you
[1:22:54] understand me sometimes things come to
[1:22:57] us when we least expect it amen it comes
[1:23:00] like an atomic bomb Hallelujah but
[1:23:02] nevertheless
[1:23:04] under the shadows of his wings I have a
[1:23:09] hiding place
[1:23:14] surely
[1:23:16] he's certain of it
[1:23:17] goodness and mercy shall follow me
[1:23:20] all the days of my life let me ask you
[1:23:23] something
[1:23:24] with all of your failures why do you
[1:23:27] still want to serve him
[1:23:29] because he's got you locked in
[1:23:32] he's got you locked in he'll never let
[1:23:35] you go he said I'll never leave you nor
[1:23:37] will I forsake you I will always be with
[1:23:40] you see it ain't about you it's about
[1:23:43] him
[1:23:44] and whatever he's designed
[1:23:47] as a trial for you
[1:23:49] I can't do it for you
[1:23:52] and whatever he's designed as a trial
[1:23:54] for me you can't do it for me everybody
[1:23:57] have their own
[1:23:59] Hallelujah but if you look over in the
[1:24:02] revelations when all of the redeems of
[1:24:06] worshiping God
[1:24:08] what were they doing they were
[1:24:09] worshiping him for what he had done and
[1:24:13] what he will do all the victors that he
[1:24:16] got in God and all the victories he got
[1:24:19] before he was God
[1:24:22] and we come into a revelation to note
[1:24:25] because of this message we know that
[1:24:27] Jesus Christ is God
[1:24:30] amen hallelujah the Jehovah of the Old
[1:24:33] Testament of Jesus Christ of the new
[1:24:35] that's not something in your mind it's
[1:24:38] got to be in your heart amen
[1:24:42] but sometimes we fail
[1:24:45] we only fail God because we want to get
[1:24:48] ahead of God and we try to manipulate
[1:24:49] God and we try to make God do what we
[1:24:51] want him to do and God says it ain't
[1:24:54] happening
[1:24:55] right
[1:24:57] remember when when God wanted to heal
[1:24:59] that young boy he was all folded up and
[1:25:02] everything else with the little blue
[1:25:03] jeans or whatever he had on it brother
[1:25:05] Brandon went to the house told a man
[1:25:07] about what his house looked like he said
[1:25:08] Brothers you've been in my house he said
[1:25:10] yeah just a hour a few minutes ago or
[1:25:12] something I've been there but the point
[1:25:14] is
[1:25:15] he thought he gonna go in there and heal
[1:25:17] the boy
[1:25:19] no he had to wait on the vision that's
[1:25:22] right
[1:25:25] he had to wait on the vision everything
[1:25:27] had to be in his proper place
[1:25:29] before it could happen and when he took
[1:25:32] the initiative to go pray for that bar
[1:25:34] on his own the boy got sicker
[1:25:37] amen and he cried out to the Lord Lord
[1:25:39] don't let him die
[1:25:41] but what was God doing teaching him
[1:25:45] teaching him and that's the same thing
[1:25:48] God does with us sometimes we try to get
[1:25:50] ahead of God and God says not so amen
[1:25:52] amen wait I said wait on the Lord
[1:25:55] hallelujah is that right yes you got to
[1:25:59] wait on him
[1:26:01] and some waiting can be very difficult
[1:26:03] for people who need patience
[1:26:06] thank you Lord
[1:26:12] oh God help us Jesus because everything
[1:26:15] in the scientific world is so designed
[1:26:19] to keep us from having patience
[1:26:22] I know
[1:26:24] you read on a pack of a popcorn I'm just
[1:26:27] giving a a thing five minutes or less
[1:26:30] five minutes three minutes
[1:26:32] and before the three minutes open you
[1:26:33] want to pop the thing over to see if
[1:26:35] it's ready it's sad three minutes
[1:26:38] y'all understand what I'm saying but our
[1:26:40] patience right you know we have a I do
[1:26:44] this all the time you know you want to
[1:26:46] warm up a sandwich or something and you
[1:26:50] want to get a few seconds here
[1:26:52] if you're done yet
[1:26:55] won't he wait
[1:26:58] and it's not a good thing
[1:27:00] it's not a
[1:27:03] learned how to wait
[1:27:07] that's what's wrong with little kids now
[1:27:08] they saw you mature Daddy I want a piece
[1:27:11] of candy no I want to be the captain
[1:27:13] wait a minute wait a minute I get it I
[1:27:15] want you know what I'm saying that kind
[1:27:17] of attitude shows our immaturity
[1:27:19] I just had to say it
[1:27:23] yeah surely goodness and mercy shall
[1:27:25] follow me all the days of my life
[1:27:27] I love that
[1:27:30] that's my scripture
[1:27:31] surely goodness and mercy because that's
[1:27:33] what I need
[1:27:34] every day of my life
[1:27:37] and I would and I will dwell in the
[1:27:39] house of the Lord forever
[1:27:42] is that right St John 17 25 26 o
[1:27:46] righteous father
[1:27:53] is that right I think about it I think
[1:27:56] about how Enoch walk with God and nobody
[1:27:59] else knew what Enoch was doing ever
[1:28:02] didn't he not look like a crazy man
[1:28:04] right
[1:28:06] yes I don't know what he what all he
[1:28:08] preached but he preached judgment
[1:28:09] according to Jude
[1:28:11] the law of the return of the of God
[1:28:14] right he built a pyramid and I don't
[1:28:17] fully understand all of that either
[1:28:19] right but it's still standing it had to
[1:28:23] stand it had to stand until the day the
[1:28:26] Capstone come down
[1:28:28] Hallelujah but this is the hour this is
[1:28:31] the day that everything is going to burn
[1:28:33] with fervent Heat
[1:28:35] Hallelujah the pyramid might have come
[1:28:38] through the water but it won't make the
[1:28:39] it won't make the fire
[1:28:41] you love the Lord O righteous father the
[1:28:44] world have not known thee but I have
[1:28:47] known thee and these have known that
[1:28:50] thou has sent me can I say it like this
[1:28:54] let's go let's put in an hour day
[1:28:56] because everybody did not see God
[1:28:59] sending Malachi 4. that's right
[1:29:01] everybody could not see that God sent
[1:29:04] William Branham in our day
[1:29:07] amen hallelujah but I have known thee
[1:29:11] and these have known that thou has sent
[1:29:14] me
[1:29:15] Hallelujah I have declared unto them thy
[1:29:19] name what did Brother Branham come to do
[1:29:21] he came to restore the altar of God and
[1:29:25] in order to restore the alt of God he
[1:29:27] had to restore the name of God Amen the
[1:29:30] name of God wasn't Baptist it wasn't
[1:29:32] Methodist it wasn't Presbyterian or any
[1:29:34] anything like that all those Blasphemous
[1:29:37] names he had to come restored because
[1:29:40] some people didn't know he was one
[1:29:42] person some people thought he was three
[1:29:44] people
[1:29:45] three personalities is that right but he
[1:29:48] had to restore the name of the Lord and
[1:29:51] the name of the Lord is the Lord Jesus
[1:29:53] Christ amen amen hallelujah yes he did
[1:29:57] glory to God I have declared because
[1:30:00] listen he didn't cast out the Devils by
[1:30:03] the name of William Branham he didn't
[1:30:04] cast out the Devils by the name of
[1:30:07] Father Son and Holy Ghost he cast out
[1:30:09] the name of doubt he cast out Devils by
[1:30:11] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen

[1:30:32] Christ will stand and God as he declared
[1:30:35] it then will also declare it again I
[1:30:38] will declare it that the love wherewith
[1:30:41] thou has loved me
[1:30:43] may be in them and I in them
[1:30:47] Hallelujah you understand me I'm talking
[1:30:51] about a super anointing God I need it
[1:30:57] at the time of The Exodus therefore Jan
[1:31:00] is in jambres
[1:31:02] Who challenged Moses with their serpent
[1:31:04] serpent rods
[1:31:06] but Moses Ross swallowed up their rod
[1:31:10] Moses had a super anointing his
[1:31:13] anointing was greater y'all understand
[1:31:15] when I say anointing i i i i when I'm

[1:31:38] swallowed up
[1:31:42] oh Jesus help us Lord Deuteronomy 29 29
[1:31:47] it says the secret things belong unto

[1:31:53] but those things which are revealed
[1:31:55] belong with to us and to our and to our
[1:31:58] children forever

[1:32:05] y'all hear me the secret things belongs
[1:32:08] to us God said he hid it from the wise
[1:32:11] and The Prudent is that right even when

[1:32:17] of those organizations denominations we
[1:32:19] had big big big name preachers but he
[1:32:23] was a little Kentuckian
[1:32:25] who never boast of his gift
[1:32:29] but through him
[1:32:30] God raised the Dead
[1:32:32] Open the Eyes of the blind right
[1:32:35] heal all manner diseases
[1:32:38] thousands of thousands of people were
[1:32:41] healed and baptized if the holy ghost at

[1:32:51] right but then you've got all of these
[1:32:53] other people with all of these flowery
[1:32:56] organizations and I asked the question

[1:33:01] and what have they become
[1:33:05] now who are you
[1:33:09] we must live up to the the revelation of
[1:33:13] this message amen that which we have of
[1:33:16] pain we must live it
[1:33:19] you understand me and as we strive for
[1:33:22] perfection
[1:33:24] Christ must be seen in every aspect of
[1:33:27] Our Lives now I know what I'm preaching
[1:33:30] and I know what I'm saying and God hears
[1:33:34] my heart and knows every desire I have
[1:33:38] and I believe with all my heart on bride

[1:34:17] because you don't know
[1:34:21] [Music]

[1:34:25] seed but I mean Jacob looked like he was
[1:34:27] a serpent seed but it was not
[1:34:31] even president said that Esau was a

[1:36:55] amen y'all better hear what I'm saying
[1:36:58] we're free
[1:37:03] hey Matthew 11 25 and 30. he said at
[1:37:08] that time Jesus answered and said I
[1:37:10] thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and
[1:37:13] Earth because thou Hast hid these things
[1:37:16] from the wise and The Prudent and has
[1:37:19] revealed them unto pains even so father
[1:37:23] for so is seeing good in thy sight let
[1:37:28] me tell you all something before I ever
[1:37:29] knew this message I knew people who
[1:37:32] lived more holier than some of the folks
[1:37:34] in the message
[1:37:35] I know they had the Holy Spirit
[1:37:38] they lived it and I'm talking about
[1:37:40] young people who wasn't ashamed of the
[1:37:42] Gospel I'm talking about people who I
[1:37:44] when I was a sinner I Marvel at you know
[1:37:47] in school the stand they would take all
[1:37:50] of the pressure they had on them that's
[1:37:51] why people can't tell me
[1:37:53] you being young oh I'm young and I can't
[1:37:55] take it yes you can
[1:37:57] y'all know what I'm saying I think I
[1:38:00] must have been 19 when God saved me
[1:38:03] 19
[1:38:06] and I never turned back did I make
[1:38:09] mistakes yes but I never had a desire to
[1:38:12] go back into the world
[1:38:15] um
[1:38:15] even so father for let so it seemed good
[1:38:19] in thy sight all things are delivered
[1:38:22] unto me for of my father and no man nor
[1:38:26] at the son but the father you know
[1:38:28] people said well Brothers you're going a
[1:38:30] little bit too far with this I'm telling
[1:38:32] you what brother Branham said
[1:38:36] maybe I'm not quoting him verbatim
[1:38:39] but brother Brandon treated every man
[1:38:41] and woman who considered himself as a
[1:38:43] Christian as a Christian
[1:38:46] yeah he never de-christianized anybody
[1:38:49] he may have told them when they were
[1:38:51] wrong and where they were wrong but he
[1:38:53] never de-christianizes
[1:38:55] true
[1:38:56] no man knoweth the son but the father
[1:38:59] neither nor any man the father saved the
[1:39:03] son
[1:39:04] and to whom the son will reveal him now
[1:39:08] oh my God that's so powerful
[1:39:12] he just told you a great mystery The
[1:39:15] Mystery of the trinity
[1:39:18] he just revealed to you right there
[1:39:22] then he goes over to say what come unto
[1:39:25] me all ye that labor in our heavy laden
[1:39:30] and I will give you rest
[1:39:32] is that right so what is he doing he's
[1:39:35] tearing down
[1:39:37] the system of the Sabbath
[1:39:40] we got to worship on the Sabbath day let
[1:39:43] me tell you something Saturday is not
[1:39:45] the Sabbath day and Sunday is not the
[1:39:48] Sabbath day
[1:39:49] Hallelujah the Sabbath is Jesus Christ
[1:39:52] in you come unto me every day come unto
[1:39:56] me and I will give you rest for your
[1:40:00] soul Joshua couldn't give it to him but
[1:40:03] Jesus Christ did
[1:40:05] Hallelujah take my yoke upon you Lord of
[1:40:09] me that's why we don't celebrate holy
[1:40:11] days people are still oh you don't
[1:40:13] celebrate Christian oh you don't
[1:40:14] celebrate Easter you don't celebrate
[1:40:16] Thanksgiving or you don't that listen
[1:40:18] people if you want to celebrate it
[1:40:19] celebrate it
[1:40:22] but there is no law saying that I must
[1:40:25] celebrate these days
[1:40:27] because everything I need is in Jesus
[1:40:33] he satisfied y'all understand me and
[1:40:37] people follow tradition and even the
[1:40:39] tradition of the prophets and think
[1:40:41] because I do they do that make them
[1:40:42] righteous
[1:40:44] talk to the Pharisees
[1:40:47] [Laughter]
[1:40:50] accept your righteousness exceed the
[1:40:53] righteous of the Pharisees you won't
[1:40:55] make it
[1:40:57] and legally they did it right
[1:41:00] lawfully they did it right sure
[1:41:03] but they had no life in them
[1:41:06] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[1:41:08] really I'm telling you when you in this
[1:41:10] message you say oh I don't celebrate
[1:41:11] Christmas they look at you like you
[1:41:12] don't curse God
[1:41:17] you don't celebrate Christmas
[1:41:21] we ain't going there we're not going to
[1:41:23] go deep in that because you know and I
[1:41:25] know when Jesus was born
[1:41:27] in the season and the time anybody hey
[1:41:31] you know Catholic did all of that sir
[1:41:33] all of it yeah all of that
[1:41:37] yeah people don't want to acknowledge it
[1:41:39] but it's the truth anyhow
[1:41:41] take my yoke upon you oh I'm gonna get
[1:41:43] in trouble and learn them
[1:41:46] for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye
[1:41:49] shall find what rest unto your soul for
[1:41:53] my yoke is easy and my burden is light
[1:41:58] Hebrew I think the four chapters said be
[1:42:00] careful unless you all fall short
[1:42:03] you don't want to fall short he said
[1:42:06] labor
[1:42:08] to enter into his rest you know how you
[1:42:11] labor you pray you keep praying you keep
[1:42:14] praying you keep praying until God
[1:42:17] brings a rest you won't have to wonder
[1:42:19] whether you got it or not Hallelujah you
[1:42:23] don't know
[1:42:24] right you love the Lord
[1:42:26] give me a few more minutes
[1:42:30] we know the storm is coming
[1:42:33] and the Bible says according to Matthew
[1:42:35] 10 28 it says fear not them which kill
[1:42:38] the body
[1:42:39] but are not able to kill the soul
[1:42:42] but rather fear him which is able to
[1:42:44] destroy both soul and Body in hell
[1:42:47] and I'm gonna tell y'all something what
[1:42:50] y'all see in America in the system and
[1:42:52] everything that's happening I'm not
[1:42:53] going to the political thing but I'm
[1:42:55] telling you they're moving this thing
[1:42:57] into a one-world order they're moving
[1:42:58] this thing where you can't buy or sell
[1:43:00] they're moving this thing into a place
[1:43:02] and this thing gonna become Christian
[1:43:07] they're going to be a United
[1:43:10] of the Catholicism and and the World
[1:43:12] Council of church well don't say that
[1:43:14] but I got to say it why I can
[1:43:18] you know what I'm saying but you need to
[1:43:21] know
[1:43:23] that this is coming your way
[1:43:25] and when you don't
[1:43:28] accept it what are you going to do
[1:43:31] in the message my new ministry
[1:43:34] brother Branham says it somewhat like
[1:43:36] this and go read it or listen
[1:43:39] he said as God brought out
[1:43:41] the children of Israel out of out of uh
[1:43:44] Egypt and how he fed them and he clothed
[1:43:48] them he said he will do likewise for the
[1:43:51] bride
[1:43:53] sure I believe it do you think that God
[1:43:56] says whatsoever you say speak those
[1:43:59] squirrels you you think that God was
[1:44:01] just that was just a rehearsal
[1:44:05] that was just something God did to show
[1:44:08] you there's a super anointing coming the
[1:44:11] bride gets it she understands it she
[1:44:14] knows what she's got in her hands but
[1:44:17] the Bible the word of God said it's
[1:44:19] going to take strong faith amen Amen to
[1:44:21] handle the sword of this day
[1:44:23] Hallelujah
[1:44:26] oh my God I feel just like shouting John
[1:44:28] right now
[1:44:30] listen
[1:44:32] hearing this message he says
[1:44:35] talk about Samson he had seven locks of
[1:44:38] hair
[1:44:39] that hung down his back
[1:44:42] which was the sign that he was separated
[1:44:44] right see when you get those virtues in
[1:44:47] there whether you like it or not it
[1:44:50] separates you
[1:44:51] the divine nature of God in you
[1:44:54] separates you from the world
[1:44:57] things that you used to be able to do
[1:44:59] you cannot do
[1:45:01] that's when you become a prisoner of
[1:45:03] Christ Paul said I'm a prisoner
[1:45:07] I love that
[1:45:08] man and then one day he was met out on
[1:45:11] the planes without anything in his hand
[1:45:13] to fight with
[1:45:15] by a thousand Philistines think about it
[1:45:20] most of us would have just fainted
[1:45:23] those Philistines were men like men like
[1:45:26] a brass wall great heavy metal over
[1:45:29] their heads great armor up in front of
[1:45:31] them Shields and buckles and so forth on
[1:45:34] to dodge any bullet probably the helmet
[1:45:38] being an instinct upon their head
[1:45:40] Samsung had nothing
[1:45:43] but he still could feel that the promise
[1:45:48] that God made him was still hanging on
[1:45:52] his head
[1:45:53] he could still feel the anointing that's
[1:45:57] what he said
[1:45:58] he could still feel the anointing in
[1:46:00] other words he know that God was with
[1:46:03] him amen but he felt them locks hanging
[1:46:06] down around his shoulder he grabbed what
[1:46:09] he was it what he could find and it was
[1:46:11] a Jawbone of a mule and he stood with
[1:46:15] that in his hand and were persistent
[1:46:18] that it would be the Jawbone or his own
[1:46:21] arm but it could be the power of the
[1:46:24] Lord
[1:46:25] it would be the power of the Lord y'all
[1:46:27] understand me he knew it wasn't a
[1:46:29] Jawbone he knew it wasn't his arm he
[1:46:32] knew it was the power of the Lord and
[1:46:35] the power of the Lord came upon him and
[1:46:37] he beat with that Jawbone a thousand
[1:46:41] Philistines
[1:46:42] now my wife didn't know what I was going
[1:46:45] to preach but she showed me on the
[1:46:47] YouTube where this on the plane this
[1:46:50] must have been an Apostolic Pentecostal
[1:46:52] girl whatever she was she had the Holy
[1:46:54] Ghost and she was just shouting and
[1:46:55] dancing and they were trying to sit her
[1:46:57] down on the plane
[1:46:59] on the plane she cut loose
[1:47:04] she was on that plane and shouting and
[1:47:08] knocking and she was out looked like she
[1:47:10] was out of control but I learned today
[1:47:13] they said that
[1:47:15] it took two hours to get her off the
[1:47:17] plane
[1:47:19] but when they got her off the plane they
[1:47:22] realized they had an engine problem
[1:47:25] and had they taken off
[1:47:27] with that engine problem they would have
[1:47:30] crashed
[1:47:37] you know I said Lord I remember now I
[1:47:40] don't got a little over here but I
[1:47:42] remember when I had it like that
[1:47:44] thank you
[1:47:47] my God don't touch that leave that
[1:47:51] anointing alone yeah if she looked crazy
[1:47:54] let her look crazy but she's having a
[1:47:55] good time
[1:47:56] you know people used to be like that
[1:47:59] and we know what's happening Brother
[1:48:00] William said that anointing is lifting
[1:48:03] and we know it is because it's so
[1:48:06] difficult to get into prayer isn't it
[1:48:08] you got a labor to get into prayer the
[1:48:11] kind of prayer you really want you got
[1:48:13] to stay there stay there and be ready
[1:48:15] when Jesus come you got to stay there
[1:48:19] but if that Spirit of him that raised up
[1:48:22] Jesus from the dead dwells in you see
[1:48:26] we're not getting it I'm not even you
[1:48:28] know I'm looking at this thing and I'm
[1:48:30] like understand we're not talking about
[1:48:32] the second person or third person we
[1:48:34] talking about the person God in you can
[1:48:38] you imagine
[1:48:41] but we need it
[1:48:43] that's our promise
[1:48:45] the god of Heaven and Earth The God Who
[1:48:48] created all the galaxies and everything
[1:48:49] living in a piece of dirt
[1:48:53] what happens he's omnipotent and once in
[1:48:57] nippleton comes on in the inside of you
[1:48:59] you are omnipotent
[1:49:02] Hallelujah he that raised up Christ from
[1:49:06] the dead shall also Quicken your modern
[1:49:08] bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in
[1:49:11] you y'all know what I'm saying with that
[1:49:14] anointing when that word is in you when
[1:49:16] the Holy Ghost is in you it shuts your
[1:49:19] body down amen
[1:49:21] thou lust lust of the flesh lust of the
[1:49:24] eye part of life it quickens your body
[1:49:26] and your body becomes like it's saved
[1:49:29] amen
[1:49:30] amen I believe that
[1:49:33] that's what I'm striving for I want
[1:49:35] everything shut down
[1:49:39] I want everything shut down so I won't
[1:49:42] have to bother with the devil and when
[1:49:44] the Devil Comes bothering me he gets
[1:49:46] disappointed
[1:49:51] little children
[1:49:58] because greater is he that's in you
[1:50:01] than he that is in the world
[1:50:04] you have overcome who them
[1:50:07] I'm almost done
[1:50:13] I'ma stop on this
[1:50:15] first Peter one through eight I'll read
[1:50:17] this and
[1:50:19] there's many quotes I I'll finish up on
[1:50:22] this the next time I come I minister
[1:50:24] uh
[1:50:26] I'll do a part two of it

[1:50:35] weather hinders us and if it does I'll
[1:50:37] let you know but uh brother isai will be
[1:50:40] preaching here on Sunday morning

[1:50:48] amen amen
[1:50:50] amen
[1:50:52] and so they're really happy Beautiful
[1:50:56] Boy by picture I didn't get a chance of
[1:50:57] seeing myself but we went by there and
[1:51:00] and um just just a wonderful wonderful
[1:51:04] time
[1:51:05] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[1:51:07] Christ I got so happy
[1:51:10] I'm telling you it's like it's almost
[1:51:11] like my wife and I had just had a baby
[1:51:15] we were so happy because the devil said
[1:51:18] no
[1:51:19] but God said yes
[1:51:22] amen
[1:51:23] amen
[1:51:25] amen amen
[1:51:27] blessed be the God and Father our Lord
[1:51:29] Jesus Christ because his great Mercy he
[1:51:32] have given us New Birth into a living
[1:51:35] hope now this is the the revised version
[1:51:37] of it
[1:51:39] through the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:51:41] from the dead and I normally don't read
[1:51:43] it but it's wonderful and into an
[1:51:46] inheritance that is imperishable
[1:51:48] undefiled unfading kept in heaven for
[1:51:52] you you are being guarded by God's power
[1:51:56] through faith for salvation that is
[1:51:59] ready to be revealed in the last days
[1:52:03] you rejoice in this even though now for
[1:52:06] a short time if necessary you suffer
[1:52:09] grief in various trials
[1:52:12] so that so that the proving character of
[1:52:15] your faith more valuable than gold which
[1:52:19] do which which though though perishable
[1:52:22] is refined by fire may result in Praise
[1:52:26] glory and honor at the revelation of
[1:52:29] Jesus Christ
[1:52:31] we handle this message like we haven't
[1:52:34] even been born again
[1:52:36] but you know praise and glory and honor
[1:52:39] supposed to flow out of us the Bible
[1:52:41] said a river of Living Water a Fountain
[1:52:44] of Living Waters is to be daily not not
[1:52:47] just on a Sunday or Wednesday it's
[1:52:49] supposed to be a daily thing you know I
[1:52:52] can remember when I first got saved my
[1:52:54] family ran from me because everything
[1:52:56] every time I here he comes all they're
[1:52:59] going to do is talk about Jesus
[1:53:02] that's all I knew to talk about
[1:53:04] right restore Me O God restore me yes
[1:53:09] sir amen though you have not seen him
[1:53:13] you love him though not seeing him now
[1:53:16] you believe in him and you rejoice
[1:53:19] within expressible and glorious Joy
[1:53:24] let me tell you something that anointing
[1:53:26] that's anointing everybody it is the
[1:53:27] anointing of the Holy Ghost
[1:53:30] but you know what it's like this
[1:53:33] the true bride of Christ will never
[1:53:36] allow herself to be manhandled
[1:53:39] it's something about it
[1:53:42] when she sees somebody trying to control
[1:53:45] her
[1:53:47] she's not going to accept that because
[1:53:49] she's under the headship of Jesus Christ
[1:53:54] but that was the early church they saw
[1:53:56] the deed of the Nicolas and they saw the
[1:54:00] change in in positioning of the of the
[1:54:03] laity and now and and they hated that
[1:54:06] deed and they were persecuted because
[1:54:09] they hated the deed
[1:54:10] you know people persecute you when you
[1:54:13] when you really set people free
[1:54:16] of these hierarchies that are even
[1:54:19] forming among ourselves and when you
[1:54:21] begin to preach like this people don't
[1:54:23] want you to preach they don't even and
[1:54:24] listen I I I don't care but I want the
[1:54:27] people to understand everything brother
[1:54:28] Branham the Lord brought through the
[1:54:30] message is right I mean as far as I can
[1:54:33] see it you know what I mean and I know
[1:54:36] he progressed and everything else and in
[1:54:38] in his Revelation and understanding of
[1:54:40] the word and if you read it and study
[1:54:42] enough you'll see
[1:54:44] changes that were being made
[1:54:46] but everything was glorifying the Lord
[1:54:49] Jesus Christ
[1:54:50] I mean he didn't glorify himself at all
[1:54:54] and he was very careful even when he he
[1:54:57] used the term I believe that I'm a
[1:55:00] prophet
[1:55:01] and sometimes he he he he he uh asked
[1:55:05] for forgiveness or something for when he
[1:55:06] was saying
[1:55:08] so you you got to understand that this
[1:55:11] this man was so dead to himself
[1:55:14] all he wanted to to see is Jesus and he
[1:55:17] was our example
[1:55:19] our living example for today that we're
[1:55:22] supposed to be so dead to ourselves all
[1:55:24] we want people to see is Jesus Christ
[1:55:26] that's it
[1:55:30] so listen this character must be proven
[1:55:34] you can't say I got patience and I got
[1:55:36] knowledge and I you know the knowledge
[1:55:38] that we have supposed to be have
[1:55:40] is so simple
[1:55:43] the word is God
[1:55:46] God is the word
[1:55:48] that's it knowledge is that God cannot
[1:55:51] fail
[1:55:52] never will fail
[1:55:54] man that that's the word could never
[1:55:56] fail so it brings a Temperance it
[1:55:58] literally brings a patient wearing that
[1:56:02] you'll wait for God no matter what the
[1:56:04] circumstances may be amen it doesn't
[1:56:06] matter how dark the clouds are you know
[1:56:09] that there's a son behind all of that
[1:56:11] see
[1:56:13] though you have not seen you loved him
[1:56:15] and though not seeing him now ye
[1:56:18] believed in him and you rejoice with
[1:56:20] unexpressibly and glorious Joy
[1:56:25] I'm I'm gonna say I'm gonna go off on
[1:56:28] that
[1:56:29] but I'm gonna tell you by the grace of
[1:56:31] God there is an anointing and I've got
[1:56:33] I've got quotes to to back that up but I
[1:56:36] don't have time to read that tonight
[1:56:38] but I'm gonna tell you something people
[1:56:42] the the the the the super anointing
[1:56:46] is not jumping and dancing
[1:56:52] though you may do that
[1:56:56] the super anointing comes with authority
[1:57:00] it's about knowing
[1:57:02] God just spoke to you
[1:57:06] and he just told you what to say
[1:57:08] and what to do
[1:57:11] and that's why brother William said the
[1:57:13] bride won't move until she gets a dust
[1:57:15] saith the Lord
[1:57:17] because she's moved into that position
[1:57:19] well she in Christ has become one
[1:57:23] and she waits on his command
[1:57:27] before she opens her mouth
[1:57:30] and that's where God is trying to bring
[1:57:32] us in touch in such an anointing you
[1:57:36] know you know I
[1:57:37] I don't know whether this was just for
[1:57:39] the prophet but it just it it gets me
[1:57:42] when when when when when God says uh you
[1:57:46] know can I walk with you
[1:57:50] that that just
[1:57:53] oh my God you know I
[1:57:56] as a man I don't know how
[1:57:59] how I would take it
[1:58:04] I really don't know
[1:58:06] I don't know how I would take that I
[1:58:08] mean of course I would say yes I'll be
[1:58:10] my mom but I probably fall and roll on
[1:58:13] the ground for a while
[1:58:15] I don't know because of my emotions
[1:58:17] brother random kind of set up a little
[1:58:18] different from me
[1:58:20] but what I don't think there's no
[1:58:23] greater honor
[1:58:25] there there is nothing
[1:58:29] and you know I'm a crybaby anyway
[1:58:32] and there is nothing that I
[1:58:35] it's beyond my comprehension
[1:58:38] but whether he ever asked me to do that
[1:58:40] that's what I'm striving for
[1:58:43] I'm striving for that kind of
[1:58:45] relationship
[1:58:47] that God would feel comfortable
[1:58:49] walking not just with me but in me
[1:58:53] that's what I'm talking about
[1:58:55] and I know this word is changing me I
[1:58:59] have my struggles
[1:59:01] but I can tell you what I'm a better
[1:59:02] Christian today
[1:59:04] than I was yesterday
[1:59:06] and the day before
[1:59:08] you know I have I Stumble I fall just
[1:59:11] like anybody else is flesh
[1:59:14] I get attitudes just like some you know
[1:59:16] what I mean but God is always there to
[1:59:18] correct me
[1:59:20] that's what I love about it he's always
[1:59:22] there to correct me and I want every
[1:59:24] correction amen everything that makes me
[1:59:27] right and put me right I want God to do
[1:59:29] it
[1:59:30] you love the Lord amen
