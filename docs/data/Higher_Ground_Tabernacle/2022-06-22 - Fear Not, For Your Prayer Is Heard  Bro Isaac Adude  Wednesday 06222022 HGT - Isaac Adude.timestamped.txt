[0:01] so i am going with the faith that i will
[0:03] overcome and in the winding and goliath
[0:05] goes down amen you have you have the
[0:08] prophets of old amen uh elijah even when
[0:11] he was facing joseph l amen he was
[0:13] facing all those it meant persecutions
[0:15] and people wanted to kill him amen he
[0:17] had god to protect him amen you have you
[0:20] have moses amen when when you've been
[0:22] facing pharaoh and then pharaoh was
[0:24] against him and wanted to kill him amen
[0:26] he went to god he looked upon god and
[0:28] god said that why do you cry speak the
[0:30] word amen and he spoke the word and the
[0:32] reds he was divided amen you have daniel
[0:35] we met when everybody
[0:37] told him not to pray and and and
[0:39] everybody that you met there sent him to
[0:41] the dead of lions amen but daniel didn't
[0:43] fear
[0:44] because he believed in god
[0:46] and he went and started praying and he
[0:48] have the three people's children even
[0:50] when the fiery furnace was before them
[0:52] and the king told them to to worship
[0:54] that that's their true amen they're
[0:55] still there even with the faith that god
[0:58] would deliver us yes amended still there
[1:00] believing that our prayer has been heard
[1:03] amen and god would deliver that amen
[1:05] even though we died but we will not even
[1:08] one time worship this this god even we
[1:11] not even want to worship this statue
[1:13] because we we we pledge our alliance
[1:15] amen to the lamb of god amen because we
[1:18] worship only one god which is the god
[1:20] which is the god of moses amen we
[1:22] worship only one god which is the god of
[1:24] abraham which is the god of isaac and
[1:26] the god of jacob so there is no other
[1:29] god that we can worship amen they
[1:31] believed in that god amen they put the
[1:33] entire faith in that god amen and that
[1:35] god came to their rescue
[1:37] and then he was the fourth man in the
[1:38] fire amen whatever situation that you
[1:41] find yourself into amen whatever things
[1:43] that you want to take to god i mean it
[1:45] doesn't matter how small it is i mean it
[1:47] doesn't matter how big that thing is
[1:49] even when you just go to him and express
[1:51] yourself to him amen god likes it when
[1:54] we come to him and we have that
[1:56] conversation amen you go to god and you
[1:58] say lord i know that you know my heart
[2:00] amen lord i know that amen the bible
[2:02] says that before i even open my mouth
[2:04] you already know what i want to ask but
[2:06] lord nevertheless i just want to open my
[2:08] mouth and expand the situation to you
[2:11] amen and god will hear your prayer amen
[2:13] because he gave this word amen this word
[2:16] about the prophet says that this word
[2:18] has been time tested amen this word this
[2:21] bible went through any kind of test amen
[2:24] but but if it came out it came out to be
[2:26] victorious amen because the word of god
[2:29] never fails amen when god gives his word
[2:31] amen that word will not fail amen in
[2:34] that word whenever the son of god would
[2:36] take this word amen and believe in it
[2:39] and he will have the same result
[2:41] amen amen it's not it's not a time it's
[2:44] not a time for the church to be sad amen
[2:47] it's not a time for you to be sad and to
[2:49] start complaining and to start amen amen
[2:52] and going back and forth and asking
[2:54] yourself why why am i going through this
[2:57] and why why you know why god is not
[2:59] coming to my rescue and why this and
[3:01] that amen you have to be happy amen
[3:03] because god you know that there is a god
[3:05] who hears your prayers amen you may he
[3:08] might not come when you want it it might
[3:10] he might not come when you expect him
[3:11] but he'll always be there amen because
[3:14] sometimes our timing and god's timing
[3:16] amen doesn't go always the same place
[3:19] amen the god doesn't amen that doesn't
[3:21] really i mean sometimes you need god the
[3:22] most in one time and god doesn't show up
[3:25] that doesn't mean that he will not show
[3:27] up that means that amen that's not his
[3:29] time amen sometimes our time is not
[3:32] god's time amen we just have to keep the
[3:34] faith and keep believing amen that god
[3:36] will always show up amen those three
[3:39] hebrews children could have been crying
[3:40] that hey god we we we are about to go to
[3:43] that fire he meant god that the door is
[3:46] already open and the the the king they
[3:49] say that to hit that fire seven times
[3:51] god where when are you gonna show up
[3:53] amen they could have been saying those
[3:55] things amen but god was waiting amen
[3:57] until they go in that fire and then he
[4:00] will show up even god could have showed
[4:02] up god could have killed the king or
[4:04] killed everybody and and turned that
[4:06] fire off but god wanted to express his
[4:08] power amen because god sometimes wants
[4:11] to show up and to tell the people that
[4:13] he's a powerful god amen that's what he
[4:15] did in egypt egypt amen he could have
[4:18] just take the children of israel and
[4:20] bring them to the promised land even but
[4:22] he had to show pharaoh that he is a god
[4:24] and he is a one and true god amen that's
[4:27] why they had to go all through all these
[4:29] things
[4:30] amen a real believer the prophet says
[4:33] that a real believer when god says
[4:35] anything he takes it and acts upon it
[4:38] even he doesn't fast about it doesn't
[4:40] ask questions
[4:42] he says that you don't know how you'll
[4:43] get up without you out of that chair
[4:46] and get a word from there tonight
[4:48] see you don't know how you're going to
[4:50] do this and how you
[4:52] and how these other diseases are going
[4:55] to be healed
[4:57] but at that word lord
[4:59] i'm going to lay down the net
[5:01] and thy word lord i'm going to rise up
[5:04] from here
[5:05] i don't know how i'm going to do it
[5:08] but at the word lord that's it
[5:11] take god at his word
[5:13] and god's spoken word will materialize
[5:16] and produce just exactly what he says it
[5:19] will
[5:20] listen
[5:21] the right manner the right mental
[5:23] attitude towards god's divine towards
[5:26] any divine promises of god will bring it
[5:29] to pass
[5:30] you don't care it i don't care what it
[5:33] is
[5:34] if you plant
[5:35] or if you want if you want to call if
[5:37] you want corn
[5:39] you plant corn
[5:41] water corn leave corn alone it will
[5:44] produce corn is that right we will
[5:46] produce wheat the promise of salvation
[5:49] will produce a christian
[5:51] the promise of the holy ghost will bring
[5:53] it to you the promise of divine healing
[5:56] will make you well any divine promise of
[5:58] god and the bible say that in the bible
[6:01] say that the word of god is a seed is
[6:04] that right amen the word of god is a
[6:07] seed amen you just take that seed and
[6:10] and you plant it in your heart amen you
[6:12] let it there let it sit there and then
[6:14] you just keep on watering that seed with
[6:16] the word of god and with the songs and
[6:19] if we can just keep it under a good
[6:21] atmosphere amen and one day you will
[6:24] raise them and one day you will wake up
[6:25] and then you will see fruit in that tree
[6:27] amen and then you will be able to eat
[6:29] from those fruit be from that tree amen
[6:32] the word of god is a seed amen this
[6:34] bible he meant his is full of seeds amen
[6:37] amen the the promises of god amen every
[6:41] situation that you can possibly think of
[6:43] amen it's been it's been written
[6:46] somewhere in this bible it meant someone
[6:48] where someone went through all those
[6:50] things amen someone went through the
[6:52] same experience amen you just take that
[6:55] seed they meant watery baby you just
[6:57] take that seed plant it in your heart
[6:59] and let the word of god and the the you
[7:02] know those songs and water the seed
[7:04] every day day and night amen it's like
[7:06] david says it's like a tree planted by
[7:08] the water side
[7:09] amen that tree will never withered amen
[7:12] that tree will always produce fruit amen
[7:14] in every season amen that tree will
[7:16] always have fruit amen it won't be like
[7:18] the tree that jesus cursed even when he
[7:20] needed the fruit amen but but he
[7:22] couldn't find any fruit it meant by that
[7:24] tree when it's planted by the word amen
[7:26] when it is planted in the word of god
[7:29] amen who will always have fruit amen
[7:31] amen every time night and day amen
[7:34] winter or summer or spring or fall amen
[7:37] that that tree that tree will always
[7:39] have fruit amen you will always have
[7:41] fire that holy ghost will keep on
[7:43] burning amen it doesn't matter if amen
[7:46] what the situation is or what you know
[7:48] it doesn't matter the atmosphere or
[7:50] where you are amen that holy spirit will
[7:52] keep on burning amen because it's
[7:54] planted by this planet in the word of
[7:56] god amen abraham
[7:59] if you ask if you went to abraham and
[8:01] you asked abraham abraham how are you
[8:03] going to have the son
[8:05] amen i'm pretty sure abraham will tell
[8:07] you i don't know
[8:08] but i believe god said it
[8:11] so i'm not even going to ask questions i
[8:13] believe in the god and that settles it
[8:15] even you can go and ask gideon gideon
[8:18] how are you going to win this war
[8:20] amen how are you going to win this
[8:21] battle luka you have less soldiers than
[8:24] than the enemies eman gideon will tell
[8:26] you i don't know but god promised me the
[8:28] victory so i'm going with that promise
[8:31] i'm going with that word and i'm going
[8:33] with that faith and i know that i'll be
[8:35] victorious amen you can't go to moses
[8:38] you say moses how are you gonna get
[8:39] those children out of egypt amen only
[8:42] with the stick you don't even have
[8:44] an error or something stronger to fight
[8:47] this body you only have a stick and look
[8:49] yourself you're old and and you can't
[8:51] even speak correctly man you can't even
[8:53] say two words amen but moses will tell
[8:56] you they said i don't know even god when
[8:59] god told me when god recruited me he
[9:01] didn't ask me for all those in my resume
[9:03] amen he only told me to trust him only
[9:05] to have faith in him and he will use me
[9:08] so i gave him my faith in and i believe
[9:10] that god will use me amen you ask david
[9:13] david how are you going to face this
[9:14] goliath david will say i don't know but
[9:16] i know one thing i mean when i came
[9:18] across a lion it meant that i wasn't
[9:21] able to kill but by god's grace i killed
[9:23] that lion amen and i believe it's the
[9:25] same god who will help me kill this
[9:27] goliath and when you ask lazarus legends
[9:29] how are you going to get out of that
[9:31] tomb amen amen look you you you you
[9:33] starting running

[9:42] that there's a promise of resurrection i
[9:44] know that god amen is the resurrection
[9:47] amen amen your situation and someone can
[9:49] ask you about how are you gonna find the
[9:51] solution to this amen you don't have to
[9:53] know amen god amen you don't have to
[9:56] know the why you don't have to know the
[9:57] how amen but you will certainly be able
[10:00] to tell someone where that thing
[10:02] happened and
[10:03] and when that thing happened amen
[10:05] because it's an experience and when you
[10:07] tell him about being someone asked you
[10:09] about how were you
[10:11] how were you saved and why were you
[10:13] saved i'll tell you that i know i don't
[10:14] know why and how i will say save
[10:17] no i don't know i don't know why god
[10:19] saved me even but i certainly know when
[10:22] god saved me and and
[10:24] and where he saved me amen if you ask me
[10:27] why the only reason that i came i can
[10:28] come up with this because he loved me
[10:31] amen there is nothing that i did that
[10:32] made that that made my salvation amen
[10:35] correct or something even it's because
[10:37] of his love out of his love i don't know
[10:39] i don't have any other answers amen but
[10:41] i can't exactly tell you i can point you
[10:43] to the place where i will say oh where i
[10:45] received the holy spirit i can't point
[10:47] you to the time even where i was filled
[10:50] with the holy spirit amen these are the
[10:52] testimonies amen if you ask those people
[10:54] from the bible amen they will tell you
[10:56] exactly they will tell you these things
[10:58] amen they just had faith in god amen
[11:00] they just believed in the word imam that
[11:02] god gave them even they just believed in
[11:05] those promises amen and they were saved
[11:07] and they were you know and god gave them
[11:09] the victory
[11:11] amen the problem is that we are too
[11:13] afraid of our goliath
[11:15] amen the problem is that we are too
[11:17] afraid to move that mountain that is
[11:19] before us
[11:20] amen the problem is that we don't
[11:22] believe in god's word in a hundred
[11:24] percent we always have doubt amen we ask
[11:27] ourselves questions it uh uh is this
[11:30] going really to happen is this word or
[11:32] this problems really applies to me or
[11:35] maybe the bible was talking about
[11:37] someone different than me or someone
[11:39] else amen here the prophet says that
[11:42] and there he was standing there busting
[11:45] himself bragging
[11:47] it seems like the us is down you see
[11:51] don't have no blood shed
[11:54] let not have any bloodshed
[11:56] let someone let's let some men come and
[11:59] fight me
[12:00] and then if i win
[12:02] then you all just serve me
[12:05] if you win
[12:06] then we will serve you
[12:08] then we
[12:09] will serve you when the devil thinks
[12:11] he's got the ozzy on you
[12:14] see
[12:14] that's when he likes to make his brag
[12:18] but he met the wrong man
[12:21] he met the littlest man in the country
[12:25] amen little still children roddy looking
[12:28] fella
[12:29] he said do you mean to tell me that
[12:32] the army of the living god will stand
[12:35] there and let that uncircumcised
[12:38] philistine defy the army of the living
[12:40] god
[12:42] why he was shocked he was shocked at it
[12:45] why he was a believer
[12:47] the others were make believers
[12:49] see he was a genuine believer
[12:52] he said if you are afraid i'll go fight
[12:55] him see what a challenge for a little
[12:58] guy like that
[12:59] and so he was a believer
[13:02] and he done just exactly what he knew
[13:05] that god will do
[13:07] even if the devil has
[13:09] those odds on you i mean he likes to
[13:12] brag himself
[13:14] it may be maybe he will make the pain
[13:16] become you know uh but maybe that it
[13:19] will make it so painful that you you
[13:21] can't bear
[13:22] amen he will start bringing this thought
[13:25] in your mind that here this is that's it
[13:27] i have to start writing my you know my
[13:29] last you know uh
[13:31] testament and saying the goodbyes and
[13:33] all these things
[13:34] amen but god the prophet says the body
[13:36] takes a believer amen to stand there and
[13:39] tell him to stop and then it takes a
[13:41] believer amen to stand there and and
[13:44] take the challenge and go challenge him
[13:47] amen and if you have the word of god and
[13:49] if god is on your side him like the
[13:51] bible says the greater is he that is in
[13:53] me than he that is the world amen if you
[13:56] have that bible if you have that god
[13:57] inside of you in that there is no
[14:00] challenge that god cannot overcome amen
[14:02] there is no situation amen that god
[14:04] cannot overcome amen everything is
[14:06] possible even god will god will make you
[14:09] a victorious amen god will make you god
[14:12] will give you the victory amen as david
[14:15] would tell you amen all his brothers
[14:17] older brothers amen they were
[14:19] experienced in battles and man you have
[14:21] soul iman has been he's been fighting
[14:23] for almost since his entire life amen he
[14:26] was the tallest person in the country
[14:28] man he was the closest one to to go
[14:31] fight against goliath amen but he was
[14:33] there scared amen but david was a
[14:35] believer even david knew the god that he
[14:38] was serving him and david knew the god
[14:41] that he was praying to even david knew
[14:43] that we met every time he prays him and
[14:46] his prayers amen are already heard
[14:49] amen so he went up there to face that
[14:51] goliath and he come up there and he
[14:53] coming and he came back with the victory
[14:55] amen it's time
[14:57] amen the bible the prophet says again
[14:59] that faith is by hearing the word
[15:02] the word of promise
[15:04] if you don't have a promise
[15:06] then you venture out upon your own faith
[15:09] but if you can't take a promise of god
[15:13] that's god's promise to you
[15:15] the woman that touched his garment
[15:18] had no promise of death
[15:20] but her faith without a promise got her
[15:23] healing
[15:25] now if she could
[15:27] get her healing by her faith
[15:29] without the promise in what she was
[15:31] doing
[15:32] how much more are we to get our in our
[15:35] healing by faith in the promise that god
[15:38] is manifesting and vindicated before us
[15:41] and has brought it to us by his word
[15:44] come around and confirm his word
[15:47] amen if that woman without the promise
[15:49] in the bible
[15:51] amen could go there amen facing this
[15:54] facing this this challenge of being
[15:57] mocked in and and and the crowd had to
[16:00] go through that crowd
[16:01] amen but but she had that faith
[16:04] that if i only touched the hem of his
[16:06] garment i know that i'll be here
[16:08] amen without the promise she went out
[16:10] there and she touched the ham of god's
[16:12] jesus her garment and she was healed so
[16:15] what about if you have a promise in the
[16:17] if you have a promise amen you can take
[16:20] that promise and go to god and say that
[16:22] lord
[16:23] you give this promise i i didn't give
[16:26] this promise i didn't write it on the
[16:27] bible
[16:28] i mean by lord that you give this
[16:30] promise so i'm coming with this promise
[16:33] amen i'm coming it's like peter peter
[16:35] says that lord at your word lord i'm
[16:37] gonna cast the nest and now when i will
[16:39] have fishes amen amen because you said
[16:42] so lord that's why i'm going to go and
[16:45] that's what i'm going to do
[16:46] amen if you can go to god and say lord
[16:49] because you said this because the bible
[16:51] says this because the bible says that
[16:53] while you're by your scraps we've been
[16:55] healed amen because the bible says that
[16:57] at the cross you say that everything is
[16:59] fulfilled amen because the bible says
[17:01] that come unto me you are weery and
[17:03] tired i will give you rest amen because
[17:06] the bible says that if you're thirsty
[17:08] come drink for free from the the
[17:10] fountain of life amen because the bible
[17:12] says then amen if your scenes are red
[17:14] like scarlet amen if they're if they're
[17:17] read the crimson amen come to me i will
[17:19] make it wider than snow it may be lo
[17:21] because you said so lord that's why i'm
[17:23] coming to you lord with the same promise
[17:26] lord and i'm hoping and i believe that
[17:28] you will give me the same result amen
[17:30] and god will give you that result amen
[17:32] because he gave this word amen he gave
[17:35] his own word and before giving that word
[17:37] the prophet says that amen that word has
[17:39] to go through tests amen to make sure
[17:41] that every time that a child of god will
[17:44] come and apply the same word and use
[17:46] that same word amen the same word will
[17:48] still have those results
[17:53] i mean just let off the pressure
[17:56] and let jesus act
[17:58] amen because warring doesn't help
[18:01] amen roaring worrying doesn't change the
[18:03] situation
[18:05] amen the matter of fact it makes it
[18:07] makes it
[18:08] it makes it worse
[18:10] amen you will bring on you and men
[18:12] diseases heart disease and and all those
[18:14] things high blood pressure and and stuff
[18:16] like that it meant worrying doesn't help
[18:19] at all amen you can be complaining and
[18:21] worrying about the same thing days after
[18:24] days it meant you will have no situation
[18:26] amen but instead of you putting all
[18:28] those worries by you can have faith in
[18:30] god amen you can have faith
[18:33] amen god will set you free
[18:36] i mean you can have faith
[18:38] god god will give you the victory amen
[18:40] you can have faith amen you can believe
[18:42] in god and you will see the result amen
[18:45] just let off the pressure amen and let
[18:48] jesus act
[18:49] amen just let off that pressure
[18:52] and then in closing
[18:54] i'll read the prophet again it says that
[18:56] in in in providing his word approving
[18:59] his word uh paragraph 115 the prophet
[19:02] says that
[19:04] and as long as you are in the line of
[19:06] duty
[19:07] keeping god's word
[19:09] doing just what he told you to do
[19:12] marching by the orders of god
[19:16] you've got the right to say to that
[19:18] mountain be moved
[19:21] god keeps his word
[19:23] if you said to this mountain be moved
[19:25] and don't doubt in your heart
[19:27] but believe that
[19:29] that would have been
[19:30] believed that that watch and belief that
[19:33] what you said will come to pass
[19:35] you can have that what you have said
[19:39] jesus said that and jesus said that in
[19:41] saint mark chapter 11 verse 22 he says
[19:44] that
[19:45] that
[19:46] that's the truth
[19:47] i know that's the truth
[19:49] it's god's word and that proves that it
[19:53] is the truth
[19:55] we're just afraid sometimes
[19:58] we get to a place
[20:00] where we're afraid he won't keep his we
[20:02] won't keep that word
[20:04] he will keep that word
[20:07] he said he will do it
[20:09] now we find when i we find this true
[20:11] because you proved it
[20:13] amen it's it's normal together to be
[20:16] afraid amen as a as a human being a man
[20:18] you have all these five senses amen in
[20:21] your body and and telling you otherwise
[20:23] but the prophet says that if you read
[20:25] this message a super sentence amen the
[20:27] prophet says that
[20:29] if you can only let that sixth sense
[20:32] amen lead your five senses amen you will
[20:35] have result in every prayers that you
[20:37] pray
[20:38] amen because these five sentences
[20:40] sometimes they act against the sixth
[20:43] amen you pray and you've been to church
[20:45] and and you you heard the word of god
[20:48] and and and god talking to you with your
[20:50] situation amen and you believe it even
[20:53] but this five those five senses i mean
[20:55] sometimes they prove that they tell you
[20:57] otherwise amen
[20:58] you've been prayed for you were you were
[21:00] sick and they did they pray for you but
[21:03] you go home and you become again sick
[21:05] and and and so painful amen just ignore
[21:08] the fire ignore those senses amen by let
[21:11] the sixth sense in action even let it
[21:14] take place amen let it take control amen
[21:17] and you will have the answer of all your
[21:19] prayers
[21:20] and you will have the answer of all your
[21:22] prayers amen because god said so amen if
[21:26] someone asks you why you believe it you
[21:28] say i don't know but i believe it
[21:29] because god said so because he said so
[21:32] that's why i'm believing it and i know
[21:34] that he will give me the answer jesus
[21:36] said that that is so or so
[21:39] and if you just take you should just
[21:42] take it in your heart
[21:43] and don't dig and don't dig it up every
[21:46] day to see how it's getting along
[21:48] just sink it in your heart and and
[21:50] settle it that's all walk right on god
[21:54] will take care of the rest

[24:08] the result amen we're touching the
[24:09] result in that we are even
[24:12] the weakness of it it meant ourselves we
