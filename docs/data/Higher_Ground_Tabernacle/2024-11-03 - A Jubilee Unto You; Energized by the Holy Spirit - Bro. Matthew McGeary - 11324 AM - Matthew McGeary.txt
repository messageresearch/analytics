and I'll not let the devil imprison me again when you're free you're free right I'm not the preacher this morning but Matthew McGary he really the Lord used him greatly last night he's coming again with another testimony praise the Living God I'm so happy Come brother uh brother McGary is uh uh from from uh Texas his daddy Pastor David McGary his Pastor so you know he's he's familiar with the congales people too and he can do some things I can't do he can sing in lingala amen I think I might have to put brush up on that but I thank God for him surely love him the last time he came here to De Mo he came especially to see me and that made me feel real good so we thank God for him appreciate his wife if she's looking in for your standing with this man Lov wife we we knew his wife before both of them before they were were married but we do thank God for him and thank God for what I've I've seen God accomplish in I just pray that the Lord will just anoint doubt lorder am amen man it's just good to be in his presence we're thankful once again for the opportunity to minister and to be gathered together with God's people I feel right at home here you know brother Isaiah is a dear friend of mine and one thing I love about friends true friends you might not get together for five 10 years but when you get together again it's just like old time you know that should be how it is when you get together with Believers something's familiar why is there a kindred spirit why does it just feel right you know the devil tries to clog up the channels tries to make you forget where you came from but this ain't the first time we've had Fellowship because where were you when the sons of God were shouting for Joy I say we were already having a Revival back there we might as well just bring it on over I didn't come from time I came from eternity so your might as will just start praising amen let's just go before him Lord Jesus we love you we thank you you're God of Grace you're God

to needs and Lord once again again we believe we stand in a predestinated moment where you have determined with an eternal purpose to speak to your bride to reveal yourself to her in a greater way to reveal to her who she really is and the hour that she is now standing what a great hour Lord we thank you once again Lord my prayer is that you come take the word break the bread of life as only you can we surrender ourselves to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen man if you have your Bibles let's turn in to uh the book of lenus Brothers I'm going to have to have some water from somewhere Hallelujah I strain my voice a little bit but I feel like we had church last night how's everybody feeling this morning well if you ain't feeling good we pray God gonna come by your way and start to move you in the right direction once again we just brother Isaiah sister Ruby invitation and the hospitality and we bring you greetings from our pastor Brother David mcgi M let's just read in Leviticus chapter 25 verse 9 and 10 say then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and he shall Hollow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family and let's just go ahead and turn in Luke chapter 4 in verse 18 and 19 Luke says the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord amen we just pray a blessing upon the reading of the word you be seated uh uh last evening we spoke uh on the thought a jubilee unto you and we dealt with how uh the devil would try to fight against your Jubilee how a spooky spirit will try to rob you of your joy rob you of your peace rob you of your inheritance try to keep you in bondage and and and though the Jubilee trumpet has [Music] sounded he he's trying to cover up your ears he's trying to keep you from recognizing what the Jubilee trumpet really means and so last night we we were just dealing with how how Satan tries to bind you and lie to you and tries to anoint your mind and this morning I as a subject I want to preach to you a jubilee unto you but my subject would be energized by the Holy Ghost so here in our text in L Leviticus 25 it's a time of Liberation it's a time of a homecoming where where people that had found them in a in a condition where their inheritance had been lost it had either been sold or taken away but there was a law of restoration that no matter what had taken place if they had lost their inheritance they had been sold if they had been taken away there was a law of restoration telling the people that you can go back that you could return and the prophet of God would say this in return in Jubilee He would say now if somehow or another the individual lost their inheritance that was given to them by God there come a year called The Jubilee every seven years they had rest a Sabbath every seven days they had a Sabbath every seven years they had a Sabbath and seven sabbaths was 49 years and the 50th year was Jubilee and now I believe we're well taught we know there's been seven Church ages and through seven Church ages we have now come to the 50th year speaking to the church ages that this is a Year of Jubilee and he says and this Jubilee every man that had lost his inheritance by some means if he was a freeorn and true blooded [Music] Israelites no matter who held the possession it had to go back to him free he didn't have to pay a thing he didn't have to do a thing but just stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance are you hearing what the prophet of God is saying he didn't to pay a thing you didn't have to do some type of works you didn't have to come up with a diary he didn't have to come up with some means by [Music] purchasing but when that Jubilee trumpet sounded I don't care how many people told you you couldn't go back care they told you you weren't worthy you're not able there was a law of restoration that said you can go back you didn't have to do a thing but just stop what you're doing I don't care if you had a Taskmaster I don't care if you were in bondage I don't care if you're working at McDonald's McDonald but if you had a possession you stop what you're doing say I'm going home going back I don't have to be in bondage any longer the father has given me is mine Oh my he had a right to it it was a god-given right because he by Grace had inherited it and it would been given to his fathers and handed down year after year no matter what had taken place if he had lost it it must go free no matter what had taken place if he lost it it must go free it meant Grace is a way provided for each individual to return to their rightful inheritance I get maybe a touch more monitor he says uh uh and what a picture it gives us tonight of the church in this last days you see what man can do and then you see what God does oh my we we just really enjoyed preaching on these things last night see what can do man messes everything up our efforts our abilities our works we just mess everything up you see what man can do but then you see what God can do you see what God does What man does is failing and will fail and has failed and always will fail but what God does is eternal and must forever remain nothing can ever take it away I said what God does is eternal God does is forever ever nothing can ever take it away then when your name was written on the lamb work there ain't no bad works there ain't no mistakes there ain't no failures there ain't no sin what God does is forever What man does will fail but when he wrote your name L's Book of Life there was nothing that could take and that ought to be enough to make the Church of God shout be enough to make you have a juile what God does is eternal and must remain nothing can ever take it away hey I can hear myself finally God give it it's his free gift and his Sovereign foresight solid and placed it nothing can move it eternally a jubilee was God's manner of expressing Grace to his people come on what have we received in this hour this message is the grace of God I say the Capstone has come to the bride saying grace you never did it in the first place talk about Grace you never did it in the first place you mean all my sin and all my mistakes my failures when I was out there in the world the prophet of God said you didn't Express nothing you didn't Express a thing because that wasn't who you are that's not who you are you are the seed of God and the only place you are called is in Christ you are in Christ and the Capstone has come you can go back back to your inheritance back to your position Adam lost said all that Adam lost back into the I say what do you have need of this morning restoration is here this is the year of jubile you can have what you ask for you can have your family have your health that baby you can have your peace have joy deliv Hallelujah this is the hour of Jubilee the trumpet has sound you are free whom the son has made free free indeed and you hear the trumpet you can go back back to your inherit God given right hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah nothing can ever move it it's there eternally a jubile was God's manner of expressing Grace to for restoring or being brought back to their rightful position now I believe this is an hour again Jubilee I believe it's a Time of Jubilee this is the hour of restoration back to your position to your inheritance now I like this in verse n he says then that you shall cause the trumpet of Jubilee to [Music] sound and on the 10th day of the seven month it's marched by the blowing of a trumpet re7 apyp on the calendar you know in the Jewish calendar they put the the day before the month the of the seven month according to Revelations 10:7 the sounding of the seventh Angel's voice what is it a sounding of your the sounding of Malachi 4 is the Jubilee TR you can go back you don't got to do a thing what you're doing return andile Hallelujah hallu he says it's the Jubilee is marked by the blowing of a trumpet I I just want to lay this in there for a thought a jubilee is two different words it it means one of it is is the blowing of the trumpet or if I can say the breath of it it's the actual blowing of the trumpet it's the shout or the sound of it but the other the other word for Jubilee it's the actual trumpet and I just want to say no trumpet no Jubilee no trumpet no jubile now the prophet of God would show in Leviticus how there would be people who would get into a walled City and if they got all walled in and they didn't hear the Jubilee sound and they missed it they stayed there in bondage because they didn't hear the now I don't know about you but you know in in my home and growing up there will be a call go out dinner is ready it's time to eat I can't tell you how many times I missed dinner I can't tell you how many times I come out of my office from studying and the food all put up there ain't no food on the table honey where's dinner I said dinner was ready didn't I didn't hear the trumpet saying dinner's ready it's time to eat come and eat is ready but I was all walled in I was studying or I was listening to something I had headphones down and when the Jubilee sounded I didn't hear the call I wonder Church you all in you hearing the Jubilee Hallelujah there is is a trumpet of Jubilee it's marked by a trumpet blowing Revelations 107y it's a jubilee to [Music] you but the prophet of God would make this statement he would say now a man in his family could go back to their original heritance if they could hear the Jubilee and a trumpet sound and know what it meant it's not just enough to hear it you got to know what it means not an explanation too many message Believers have received an explanation they let some man tell them this is what it means I'll tell you what it means this is what Malachi 45 meant I don't see that pattern in the Bible in my Bible when Jesus said to his disciples and make no mistake this message is Jesus Christ this message is the person almighty God God's grace expressed to you for your Jubilee I ask you then who do you say I the message am who do you say I well he stood there and said some say this preacher said that brother so and so said that but who do you say I the son of man who do you say Revelations 10:7 is who do you say Malachi 45 who do you say oh yes he they gave their description some say you're some say you're a good preacher some say you're a prophet but who do you say that I am he said Thou Are the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus looked at him and said Peter Flesh and Blood I said Flesh and Blood did not reveal that to you it wasn't some preacher it wasn't your carnal mind it some theology Peter My Father which is in heaven has revealed this rock this Revelation I will build my church he's the same yesterday today and forever who do you say I the son of man do you know what the Jubilee trumpet is saying all that Adam has lost his position has been restored back oh we we we could go into countless testimonies of how the message was manifested in the prophet with the power of the spoken word you say to the mountain not if I I say if you say then I ask you if this is the Year of Jubilee and this is the hour of restoration right what's the threefold [Music] purpose what's to manifest himself in Christ Jesus then to have preeminence in his bride and then take us back to Eden we saw a man standing on the Earthen condition wind had toey toey I'm not talking about just Jesus Christ I'm talking about a redeemed Son of God had been restored back to the position that Adam had in the beginning where when he spoke he speaking that wasn't just for the prophet that was for you that was a shef wave hallelujah what is a she wave we know that Christ was the original shef wave people at is the of restoration to the faith the Pentecostal Faith thou can't believe if thou can't believe all things are possible am amen where when you speak the word when you speak the word all of Heaven backs it up do you know what the Jubilee trumpet means to restore and being brought back to your right position now I like where this word Jubilee or ju in one way it's spelled in the Bible Ju j u b i l e but the root word for Jubilee comes from it means to carry you into it means to be led now I want you to think of this for a moment when Israel was in bondage uh when when when they were in Egypt they started to get into desperation they started to cry out for a deliverance and God sent Moses but you see it was God veiling himself in a man that wasn't a man coming that was just the veil my Bible tells me I am come down to deliver I am come down to deler he didn't just deliver them he was there to to carry [Music] them come on now he didn't just come to set you free and say now I want you to find yourself into the Rapture he came here to deliver you he came here to take you and to carry you into the body change Christ is here to carry you into the rure [Music] amen oh you talk about a jubilee oh my goodness when they cross that Red Sea and all of their task Masters and everybody that had whipped them and beat them and held them in bondage when they crossed that Red Sea and all of those horse riders you can make it spiritual too themse fighers started coming after him all of a sudden the waves started to come down and they saw all of their enemy was dead you talk about a jubilee maram got the tambourine she started singing she started dancing because she knew those cast Masters bother her anymore don't you realize the Jubilee is sounding the devil can't bother you anymore you don't have to wonder if you're saved you're sa why cuz he said so you don't have to wonder if you're going in the Rapture you're going in the Rapture he said so come on what we need is a revelation because a lot of us amen the word like the word we jump and shout and scream in church how you how you acting at your job how you acting at your University I say you ought to be like maram coming in the clock in why are you so happy maram if you I'm living in my Jubilee bondage I don't care who the president is Harris Donald Trump Donal TR they ain't got nothing on me there's only one thing I'm interested in that's my that's my Christ and his arms are around me he's carrying me into body change amen I tell you what if you're getting all wrapped up in politics and all discouraged about the economy you're living in the wrong [Music] economy I said you're living in the wrong economy there's another economy it's called the economy of God my God owns a cattle on a thousand hills all you ask I Lord I need peace I need to pay my bills move out over my daughter my children Lord protect them today give them your grace God's economy and he said if you ask anything in my name he didn't say you got to work a 40 hour shift he didn't say you got to pray for two hours he said just ask just take me at my word and you shall have what you ask for I say some of us just start should start asking Health what economy are you living in he's come to deliver he's come here to take you into but you got to hear the Jubilee trumpet and you got to know what it means now down in Texas we have something we call juneth and you know I I think about this often but you know down in galvaston it's it's tucked way down there in Texas out on the coast and and though the emancipation of proclamation had been made there's a there was a group of slaves that had never heard message and we we celebrate this in Texas called juneth because on June 19th in 1865 there was 2,000 troops that rode into gston and they announced to more than 250,000 slaves you're free oh you can imagine they heard the rumors heard explanations did you hear my cousin said over there that they were set free but they couldn't believe it because there was all the task masters with their guns and their whips tell them you can't go nowhere when that Army showed up when that Army showed up they came in and forced and they said don't worry about your tasm to Proclaim you are free you don't got to be in bondage anymore there was no slave owner there was noas Master nobody could stop them slaves and history tells us history tells us when they got the message that they were free they started to dance they started to shout started to sing they started to pray started to go in Jubilee because it was there Jubilee I say what about the bride of Christ People Sing and Shout is a people that have heard the Jubilee amen amen amen no matter what had taken place Grace Grace is here to tell you you can go free back to your inheritance but you know that Old Devil he's just a squatter my dad bought some land down the street from us a house he got it for a really good price and we found out why because I had a squatter you getting that right because this is important so a squatter is somebody who stays somewhere that's not theirs okay so there's a big problem nowadays where where people don't pay their rent and they stay in the house rent free and when the owner comes to evict them out of the house they don't leave and because of our government system there's laws in place where they can't kick them out they have to go through the court they have to go through the government well we come to find out this guy was living in the house he quit paying his mortgage and he had been living there for like three or four years not paying anything and so One Bank sold the house to another bank and that bank couldn't get them out that bank sold it to another bank and the guy just he he had some uh lawyer on retainer and every time the system just started over but you see they they finally uh uh sold the the property again and and the cost kept getting cheaper and cheaper because nobody could get this squatter out so it fell our lot that that my my dad saw the house was for sale for a really good price so we bought it and then we found out there was a squatter squatter there we go we can establish that does everybody know what a squatter is now a squatter is what the devil is he's trying to stay in your mind rent free he's trying to stay in your life rent free he didn't pay for your life he didn't pay for your mind your body and your mind belongs to one person so my dad bought this land come to find out the squatter was in there he filed the paperwork five months went by a year went by but you know to that squatter's dismay to the squatter's surprise he didn't realize the Son of God bought that property and after going through the system over and over and over there finally come a day where it was time to show up at the house time had run out his squatting days were over he no longer live there rentree anymore and so we we all our whole family showed up to the house and the police showed up to the house and the sheriff showed up to the house and he grabbed the letter and he showed the squatter I have come to enforce their god-given right they purchased this land and you got to go he said well I'll call my lawyer all your days of arguing and fussing are over I said all the days of arguing and fussing are over he said you got to go so you know what we did we all went in with that sheriff we start CHP stuff out of there yeah we started bringing the couches out we started piling everything on the C why because the enforcer was there oh come on come on somebody a squatter's filled your whole life with a bunch of junk too long squatting on your life let's talk to somebody real quick are you living free in the Holy Ghost you say you've heard the Jubilee sound but do you really know what it means it means you don't have to be glued to your cell phone if
