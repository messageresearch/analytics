[27:15] I'm going to start to introduce myself
[27:17] first.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; I am your brother.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; My name is Samo.
[27:32] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm a I'm a um I go to a church to a
[27:37] church in K.
[27:39] I'm I'm a shepherd of a church in
[27:41] Katanga.
[27:44] and inumba
[27:49] and kasumba is on the border between the
[27:52] Congo and Zambia
[27:55] &gt;&gt; and that's where we serve the Lord.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; And that's how we usually come here to
[28:03] America.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; And this time it pleased God that I be
[28:10] with you here tonight.
[28:12] in Iowa.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; And then I was invited by brother John.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; And when I came here, when I got here
[28:26] because even
[28:33] the Apostle Paul says that there are
[28:35] there are elders who are highly regarded
[28:38] in a city.
[28:40] There's an elder in the city who is
[28:42] highly regarded.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; And so that's why he brought me to an
[28:47] elder
[28:51] &gt;&gt; so I could uh present to you the uh
[28:54] present to you what I have
[28:58] &gt;&gt; and it was the first time that I meet
[28:59] the pastor
[29:02] &gt;&gt; and I really appreciated him
[29:05] &gt;&gt; and I really loved him.
[29:09] because I really felt the spirit of God
[29:11] in him. Amen.
[29:16] And
[29:19] as the prophet tells us that you can
[29:21] feel the spirits that somebody has just
[29:22] by talking to him for five minutes
[29:30] and without flattering you. I can tell
[29:32] you that you have a really good pastor
[29:36] and you have to support him
[29:39] as uh pro the prophet Brandham says you
[29:42] have to support him with everything that
[29:44] you have.
[29:45] And you also have to pray for him.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Pastor, I really appreciate you.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; And may God richly bless you.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; It's the first time that I meet him.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; And the first time I meet him, he he
[30:05] allowed me to preach in his pulpit. No,
[30:08] not everybody does that.
[30:13] But I I believe that it did not just
[30:15] happen haphazardly. God knew everything.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; And that's why I bless I I I bless his
[30:23] name
[30:27] &gt;&gt; because he allowed us to meet today.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; And I also thank And I also thank the
[30:35] pastor for giving me his pulpit
[30:40] &gt;&gt; and I also thank you for coming here
[30:41] tonight.
[30:43] And so God, God richly bless you.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; So let's stand.
[30:51] &gt;&gt; I believe that I'm just going to give
[30:53] you my greetings today
[30:56] by God's grace.
[30:58] Maybe he will come back again
[31:02] and we'll we'll fellowship together
[31:04] again.
[31:06] I won't that everyone speak to the Lord
[31:11] that you tell the Lord, Lord, speak to
[31:13] me tonight.
[31:17] Don't let a man speak to me. Amen.
[31:20] But I want you, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[31:22] to speak to me.
[31:24] Because if I speak to you,
[31:27] then my words will destroy you and kill
[31:29] me.
[31:31] But if it's Jesus Christ who's going to
[31:33] speak to you, then his words will give
[31:36] you life.
[31:39] The sickness sickness will turn into
[31:41] healing.
[31:45] Problems will turn into solutions

[34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:08] So, as we as we're standing,
[34:11] let's turn our Bible in the book of
[34:13] Daniel.
[34:16] I prepared something for Daniel.
[34:21] &gt;&gt; We're going to go to Daniel chapter 6.
[34:31] I think we may have to start from the
[34:33] beginning.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; But let's start from verse 24
[34:41] of Daniel chapter 6.
[34:45] We go from verse 24 to verse 29.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; So I I'm going to read in this Bible
[34:58] Well, I'm reading a different version
[34:59] here, but we can all understand what
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Verse 22.
[35:11] Verse 22, my God has sent his angel and
[35:14] has shut up. Uh, verse 21, the English
[35:17] version. Then s said Daniel unto the
[35:19] king, oh king, live forever.
[35:33] My God has sent his angel and has shut
[35:35] the lion's mouth that they have not hurt
[35:38] me. For as much as before him innocency
[35:41] was found in me, and also before thee, O
[35:43] king, have I have I done no hurt.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; Then was the king um
[35:54] Not.
[35:56] [Music]
[36:12] Then was the king exceeding glad for him
[36:15] and commanded that they should take
[36:16] Daniel up out of the dan. So Daniel was
[36:19] taken up out of the dan and no matter of
[36:21] hurts was found upon him because he
[36:23] believed in his God.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:45] And the king commanded, and they brought
[36:46] those men which had accused Daniel, and
[36:48] they cast them into the dand of lions,
[36:51] them their children, and their wives.
[36:53] And the lions had the mastery over them,
[36:56] and break all their bones in pieces, or
[36:59] wherever they came at the bottom of the
[37:01] of the dam.
[37:03] Now, let's stand while we continue
[37:05] reading. Let's sit. Let's sit while we
[37:07] continue reading.
[37:20] Now, this is where we get our theme. Uh,
[37:22] verse 25. Then King Darius wrote unto
[37:25] all people, nations, and languages that
[37:28] dwell in all the earth, peace be
[37:29] multiplied unto you.
[37:33] Peace be multiplied unto you.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; I make a decree that in every dominion
[37:45] of my kingdom, men tremble and fear
[37:47] before the God of David. Amen.
[38:00] For he is the living God and steadfast
[38:02] forever. And his kingdom that that that
[38:05] which shall not be destroyed and his
[38:07] dominion shall not shall be even unto
[38:09] the end.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; He deliverth
[38:14] and rescueth.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; And he workketh signs and wonders.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Wonders in heaven. in heaven and in
[38:25] earth
[38:30] who has delivered Daniel from the power
[38:32] of the lions.
[38:34] And to finish to finish with verse 28.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; So so this Daniel prospered into the in
[38:44] the reign of Darius and the reign of
[38:46] Cirrus the Persian.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; May God bless the reading of his word.
[38:53] I believe it was a a lengthy reading
[38:59] but in this lecture we can find our food
[39:02] and our our drink in here.
[39:08] My title is going to be the letter of
[39:10] the king.
[39:12] We're going to talk about the letter of
[39:14] the king.
[39:18] And I believe you will understand by the
[39:20] end of the sermon what was the letter of
[39:22] the king.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; But I want that I want to get get the
[39:28] attention of everybody from the start
[39:34] because something can happen while we're
[39:36] talking.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; We're talking about Daniel.
[39:45] We talk about Daniel because there is a
[39:47] lot of revelations in the book of
[39:48] Daniel.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; And I want that every one of you know
[39:53] that
[39:57] the thunders and the and the the seals
[39:59] that we all talk about all this time.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; The first prophet.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; The first prophet. The first prophet who
[40:11] ever saw all these signs, these
[40:12] thunders, it was the prophet Daniel.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; And
[40:18] he was even ready to open those seals.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; But God told him, "No, no, it's not.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; This is not reserved for you for you."
[40:31] &gt;&gt; He told him, "It's reserved for the time
[40:33] of William Brham
[40:35] &gt;&gt; because it's the pe the people that live
[40:37] in that time. they will be the ones that
[40:39] will receive those things.
[40:42] And here we are in that time.
[40:46] And when you read in chapter 11:32,
[40:51] it says that those who will know their
[40:53] God,
[40:56] they will do wonders.
[41:00] It's not that they will do it in the
[41:02] time of Daniel.
[41:05] the wonders that he's talking about is
[41:08] today.
[41:11] It
[41:11] &gt;&gt; it said that those who will read about
[41:13] those things
[41:15] their knowledge will increase
[41:20] that means that we're not living in a
[41:22] time of ignorance.
[41:24] In this time ignorance is not is not
[41:27] allowed
[41:30] because it was promised to us that when
[41:32] we know those things
[41:34] It said that the knowledge of the word
[41:36] of God will increase.
[41:38] Amen.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen?
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Now let me tell you that the book of
[41:46] Daniel is is a is a book of revelation.
[41:52] The same way that the book of revelation
[41:54] reveals things,
[41:57] the book of Daniel is also a book of
[41:59] revelations.
[42:01] Amen. Can somebody say amen?
[42:04] &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen?
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Now you will understand what happened in
[42:10] that time
[42:13] because you have to know
[42:17] that everything we've lived up until
[42:20] tonight.
[42:22] It was prophesied by Daniel.
[42:27] Now you all remember when Nebuchadnezzar
[42:29] saw this saw a dream,
[42:34] he talked about all those kingdoms that
[42:36] had to come after him.
[42:39] In that time, the Babylonians had to
[42:40] reign.
[42:43] And then after the Babylonians, there
[42:44] was the the Meo Persians, then the
[42:46] Greeks, and then the Romans.
[42:52] And then you will see that we we're
[42:54] seeing those things being accomplished
[42:56] according to how Daniel prophesied.
[43:03] And you can see
[43:05] where Daniel saw that the clay
[43:12] when we're talking about the king of
[43:13] north you can see that all those things
[43:15] we can see those thing being fulfilled
[43:16] right now.
[43:20] But that's not our subject because if we
[43:22] have to talk about it, we can stay here
[43:23] until tomorrow. I want to stay in the
[43:25] the letter of the king.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Then you understand that everything that
[43:30] happens,
[43:34] everything that happens with Daniel in
[43:36] the beginning of the time of Gentiles.
[43:43] It's the same things that needs to
[43:44] happen at the end of the time of the
[43:46] Gentiles.
[43:48] Can some does somebody understand this?
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Now listen to me.
[43:53] Prophet really brother Brandham says
[43:55] that Daniel
[43:57] was the was the first prophet of the
[43:59] nations of the n of the gentiles.
[44:03] Now somebody will say well Paul
[44:07] was according to the church ages he was
[44:09] the first one.
[44:13] But brother Ram says Daniel was not a
[44:15] was not was not from the Gentiles but he
[44:18] was a Jew.
[44:21] But he said that the one who saw
[44:24] &gt;&gt; the one who saw the beginning of the
[44:25] Gentiles and the end was Daniel.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[44:33] &gt;&gt; I rather let's read it. I rather read
[44:35] it.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; I don't I want to complicate anything
[44:38] from the start.
[44:42] We have to
[44:46] when we when we go up with this,
[44:50] &gt;&gt; we we want to be on the same on the same
[44:52] spot in the same level.
[44:58] the beginning and the the end of the the
[45:00] Gentiles
[45:03] was preached in uh January January
[45:08] &gt;&gt; January 9th 1955
[45:11] brother says he says in reality
[45:15] he says Daniel was a prophet of the
[45:17] Gentiles.
[45:22] He says Daniel saw the the the the
[45:25] beginning and the the and the fall of
[45:26] the age of the Gentiles age.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; He says he was the first one to be
[45:33] called the prophet of the Gentiles.
[45:36] himself was not a gentile,
[45:40] &gt;&gt; but he saw the dispensations of the
[45:42] Gentiles
[45:43] from the start to the end
[45:47] starting starting with the head of gold
[45:52] and ending with the feet of of clay.
[45:56] Can somebody say amen?
[46:00] Now I want to take you to the beginning
[46:02] of the Gentiles.
[46:04] Now listen to what happened.
[46:09] When God wanted to start working in the
[46:11] in the beginning of the Gentiles,
[46:14] &gt;&gt; he was looking for a man
[46:17] because he knows
[46:21] [Music]
[46:23] because he knows that he cannot work
[46:25] without a man.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:29] God without man he's he's powerless
[46:33] for God to work he needs to use a man
[46:38] that means in the beginning of the the
[46:40] dispensation
[46:42] God found a man
[46:46] and that man was not just whatever manet
[46:49] he was a prophet
[46:53] that's that's the person he used in the
[46:54] beginning of the of the gentile
[46:58] And I want you to know that the name of
[46:59] Daniel the name of Daniel means God is
[47:03] my judge. That's that's the meaning of
[47:05] that name. In the name of in the name uh
[47:08] the name Daniel
[47:10] in that name there is there's a part of
[47:12] the name of God in that name because
[47:15] when you write the name Daniel
[47:18] the eel at the end of Daniel
[47:21] it's it's a it's a it's a form of
[47:23] Elohim.
[47:25] That means that in the beginning of the
[47:27] gentile age, God took a man
[47:31] &gt;&gt; and that man was a prophet
[47:35] &gt;&gt; and that man in his name he had a part
[47:37] of God in that in that name
[47:42] the pro the prophet says that the same
[47:44] way
[47:46] the prophet says the same way the
[47:47] gentile age started it has to end the
[47:49] same way as well
[47:52] who believes that we're at the end of
[47:53] the gentile time.
[47:57] And because we're living in the end of
[47:58] the gentile time,
[48:01] now we have to find evidences.
[48:07] We need we need to find out who is the
[48:09] prophet who needs to come at the end of
[48:11] the time of the Gentiles.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; We find we look at we look at a man and
[48:16] that man
[48:18] his name William Brham.
[48:22] is that man that God needs to use at the
[48:24] at the end of the time of the Gentiles.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; But when we notice in the beginning of
[48:30] their dispensation,
[48:33] &gt;&gt; we found that the name of Daniel had one
[48:35] part of it met God
[48:39] and to have an exact equation.
[48:44] the end time prophet as well.
[48:49] A part of his name also needs to have a
[48:52] part of God in it.
[48:55] Who believes that William Brham
[48:59] who believes that the the name of
[49:01] William Brham had a part of God in
[49:03] there. So if you believe it
[49:08] that means that he he has to be the
[49:10] prophet of the end time.
[49:14] He is the prophet that was used in the
[49:17] end the end time of the Gentiles.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; So listen to me carefully.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Now us the Gentiles, we don't know the
[49:29] importance of a prophecy.
[49:31] But if you go in Israel
[49:34] [Music]
[49:36] in Israelites can demonstrate to you
[49:37] who's a prophet.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; I was in Israel.
[49:43] [Music]
[49:45] and we had a chaperon who was showing to
[49:47] us the importance of a prophet in
[49:50] nation. He was saying that us Jews,
[49:54] he says that when we see pro prophets,
[49:57] he said that us Jews when we see
[49:59] prophets, we see a divine visitation.
[50:05] And he told us that when we see a
[50:07] prophets, that means God is speaking to
[50:09] us and he's with us. And he said that if
[50:11] we don't have a prophet,
[50:14] it means that God has forsaken us.
[50:18] If the prophet is with us,
[50:21] He said that it means that God is with
[50:23] us.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; So go ask the Muslims.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; They will also tell you who's the
[50:32] prophets and the importance of a
[50:34] prophets. Let me tell you
[50:39] in Israel. You cannot speak against the
[50:41] prophets.
[50:44] You can be stoned for speaking against
[50:46] the prophet
[50:49] because they know that a prophet
[50:52] a prophet is the is the mouth that God
[50:56] uses to speak. And I want to tell you
[51:00] that at the end of this dispensation,
[51:03] God used the prophets again.
[51:06] And so when you reject that prophets,
[51:09] you reject God.
[51:11] When you listen to that prophet,
[51:14] you listen to the God Almighty.
[51:18] Now there's a problem today.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; People are rejecting the prophets,
[51:24] &gt;&gt; but they also want revelation.
[51:27] Well, those two things cannot coexist
[51:33] because the revelation is not does not
[51:35] come through the the preachers and
[51:37] pastors.
[51:40] But the revelation always comes through
[51:42] the prophets. Now let me tell you,
[51:45] when you reject the prophets,
[51:48] you have also rejected the word. You
[51:51] have also rejected the revelation.
[51:54] But when you accept the prophets,
[51:57] you receive the prophets.
[52:00] That means you have also received the
[52:01] revelation. That means you have received
[52:04] God.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; The prophet himself is not God.
[52:10] But but he represents God right there
[52:14] because he is the mouth that God uses to
[52:16] speak. Can somebody say amen?
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen?
[52:23] &gt;&gt; If you don't know the importance of a
[52:24] prophet,
[52:26] then you can say anything you want.
[52:30] But when you know the secret of a
[52:32] prophet in a camp, then that means you
[52:35] are a strong. You're a mighty army.
[52:40] because that means there's somebody in
[52:41] the camp
[52:44] and that person he's the one he's the
[52:47] one who transmits all the words that
[52:48] come from heaven.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen?
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Now we're talking about Daniel.
[52:57] Look at the role of Daniel.
[53:00] You're going to see that.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; You're going to see that Daniel was
[53:05] deported from Israel to Babylon.
[53:09] He worked with the Nebuchadnezzar.
[53:12] Even though he was a slave,
[53:17] &gt;&gt; his prophetic quality was not taken away
[53:19] from him.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; He was the prophet of God.
[53:26] But he was above the magicians. He was
[53:28] he was the master of the magicians.
[53:31] He was above the astronomers.
[53:34] He was above he was their their boss.
[53:39] He was above all the divine divers. He
[53:42] was their boss.
[53:48] So that means that when the king wanted
[53:50] to to to wanted to get a revelation of
[53:52] something, the boss of all those divers,
[53:56] it was the prophet Daniel.
[53:59] Because the prophet Daniel had a true
[54:00] God
[54:02] while the other ones had little gods.
[54:05] I want to tell somebody this morning to
[54:07] tonight.
[54:09] Do not limit. Do not downgrade yourself
[54:12] because you think you're nobody.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Despite all the powers you can you can
[54:18] meet. Whether it's magic, whether it's
[54:21] freemasonry,
[54:24] any other spirit.
[54:26] As soon as the spirit of God is in you,
[54:30] that means that you have a superior
[54:31] spirit.
[54:33] Because when Belasar
[54:37] Because when Darius noticed Daniel, the
[54:40] Bible says,
[54:42] &gt;&gt; the Bible says that they noticed
[54:45] &gt;&gt; that they noticed a superior spirit in
[54:48] Daniel. Let me tell you, I'm going to
[54:50] tell you the spirit of God.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God has always been a
[54:55] superior spirit. When you have a spirit
[54:57] of God, you are always above everything.
[55:02] The spirit of God is not a spirit of
[55:06] &gt;&gt; it's not a spirit of crying.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God is not a spirit of
[55:12] lamentation. It's not a spirit of fear.
[55:16] When you have the spirit of God in you,
[55:19] you have a superior spirit.
[55:22] When you walk where demons are, every
[55:26] demon needs to bow down
[55:29] because the one who is in you, he's
[55:32] greater than all those magicians. The
[55:34] one who is in you
[55:36] is greater than the sickness. The one
[55:39] who is in you, he's greater than your
[55:42] ancestors.
[55:44] So when you have him inside of you,
[55:47] you can walk with your chest with your
[55:50] boss and chest. You can walk with your
[55:52] head high. Why?
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Because the one who is inside of you is
[55:59] greater
[56:01] than all kinds of spirits.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen?
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar worked with the Daniel.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; He found that Daniel was a a great a
[56:17] great man.
[56:20] his revelation.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; It was a person who was capable
[56:27] that when the king sees a dream
[56:31] and that the king doesn't know where
[56:33] where to find find himself and he calls
[56:36] all the magicians.
[56:38] He calls all the astronomers. He calls
[56:41] all those all the divers.
[56:46] asked them to remind him what he saw in
[56:48] his dream because he forgot about it.
[56:54] And the and the dividers told him that
[56:56] only man can reveal to you those things.
[56:58] Not a man cannot do it. He
[57:01] &gt;&gt; they told him when you were sleeping we
[57:03] were not with you.
[57:06] So then don't don't ask us to tell you
[57:08] what you saw in your dream because it's
[57:10] impossible.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; But there was a man in the camp.
[57:15] That man in the camp,
[57:17] &gt;&gt; he was able.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; He was able to say, "Oh king, live
[57:22] forever."
[57:24] &gt;&gt; He's what you're tell what you're
[57:26] saying, only God can do it.
[57:29] But that God is not going to do it in
[57:31] the air. I am the mouth of that God. So
[57:34] let me take some time to speak with that
[57:37] God and then I'll tell you what what
[57:40] what you have. So when the man came
[57:42] back,
[57:44] he gave the exact meaning of what the
[57:47] king saw in his dream.
[57:50] And we saw that with the prophets.
[57:53] Someone could go to the prophets. And he
[57:56] could tell him, "Oh, I saw some dreams.
[57:59] I saw when I was going down this this
[58:01] this road." Then brother Ram could tell
[58:03] him, "Stop. No, you forgot about a
[58:05] detail here.
[58:07] There was a stairs that was going this
[58:09] way.
[58:11] It means that it's the same spirits
[58:12] working.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; We have received a superior spirit.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; And when you receive a superior spirit,
[58:21] &gt;&gt; that means you also become superior. Let
[58:24] me tell you tonight
[58:26] that I'm not used to
[58:31] I'm not used to just say deity in one to
[58:33] put deity in one person.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Deity started with God himself.
[58:40] Everything that was in God,
[58:42] God put it, God poured it into Christ.
[58:47] It was a de deity that was migrating to
[58:49] him.
[58:51] And everything that was in Christ,
[58:54] God put him here.
[58:57] But then listen to what a lot of people
[58:59] do.
[59:00] And a lot of preachers make this
[59:02] mistake. When deity start got here
[59:08] and they stop it there, they they put
[59:11] the key and they close it right there.
[59:14] They say apart from Brandom, nobody can
[59:16] do anything. No, that's that that's not
[59:18] true. I came here to tell you
[59:22] that deity did not remain in the
[59:25] prophets.
[59:27] deity that was here.
[59:30] Our prophets was the
[59:34] same deity lives in me.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; The same deity is in the pastor.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; The same deity is in you.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen? Amen. Can
[59:46] somebody say amen?
[59:48] &gt;&gt; It's the same power.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; It's the same It's the same power.
[59:53] Jesus Christ is the is the great ocean.
[59:56] And when the ocean is full,
[59:59] that's that's the fullness of the gear.
[1:00:02] Brother Ram was
[1:00:06] when a um um a
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; like a like a like a bucket.
[1:00:12] When a bucket is full,
[1:00:15] it's the fullness of deity in there. I
[1:00:18] have a spoon
[1:00:20] with my spoon.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; When that spoon is full,
[1:00:26] It is also the fullness of the deity.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; So deity is not does not stop right
[1:00:31] there.
[1:00:34] If brother Brandham raised the dead,
[1:00:36] that means I can also raise the dead.
[1:00:39] Amen.
[1:00:43] The deity and the prophet Brandham,
[1:00:46] he could turn his back. He could discern
[1:00:48] the thoughts. I can't do that. It was
[1:00:50] only him who can do it.
[1:00:53] But if diet could heal the sick,
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; that means it can also heal the sick
[1:00:58] through me. Amen.
[1:01:00] Amen.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen?
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen?
[1:01:06] Amen.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen?
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Now listen to me carefully.
[1:01:12] The way that God works,
[1:01:15] he always works in a classical way.
[1:01:20] He He worked the world through Jesus
[1:01:22] Christ.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; He worked in the age through a a major
[1:01:27] prophet and
[1:01:31] he and he works in the local church
[1:01:34] through a pastor.
[1:01:36] And so if you follow that leadership,
[1:01:39] you will never be disappointed.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen?
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Can we go forward?
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Can we go forward? Amen.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar noticed that Daniel was
[1:01:54] superior.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; When his kingdom ended, it was the his
[1:01:59] grandson.
[1:02:01] Then Belazar took the kingdom
[1:02:04] and he also saw the same things
[1:02:08] because Baltazar could make a mistake.
[1:02:11] He could take
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; he used the the the instruments of the
[1:02:17] temple to use it in a pagan party and a
[1:02:21] hand of God wrote something
[1:02:24] man
[1:02:26] who could translate that. There was only
[1:02:28] a prophet who could translate it. He was
[1:02:31] the only one who could translate those
[1:02:32] words.
[1:02:35] And it was through that
[1:02:38] that's when God decided on the end the
[1:02:41] end of the kingdom of Babylon
[1:02:44] and the Meo Persians had to to start
[1:02:47] when the Meo Persians started
[1:02:50] because they were smart Darius and
[1:02:52] Sirius
[1:02:55] because Babylon was was huge.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Well, they said we're going to split
[1:03:01] we're going to split Babylon. I think in
[1:03:03] in verse in chapter six of Daniel,
[1:03:06] they said, "We're going to split the
[1:03:07] kingdom."
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; And he says, "We're going to split it
[1:03:12] into 120 provinces."
[1:03:15] And he said, "We're going to give 40
[1:03:18] provinces to each governors."
[1:03:22] And so they had to choose who was going
[1:03:24] to play the the role of the governor.
[1:03:26] They took two Babylonians.
[1:03:29] And so they saw that Daniel was above
[1:03:31] above everybody. So they took Daniel and
[1:03:34] they put him as a governor there. Now
[1:03:36] this was the beginning of the time town
[1:03:38] time of the Gentiles.
[1:03:40] Now now follow the spirits that started
[1:03:43] in the time of the the beginning of the
[1:03:44] time of the Gentiles. Those people
[1:03:48] can someone give me some handkerchiefs
[1:03:50] or something.
[1:03:53] Those people were here to to govern
[1:03:56] those provinces.
[1:03:59] And as they were um they had those pro
[1:04:02] they were leading those prophets they
[1:04:05] noticed something.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; So they noticed
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; they noticed that Daniel
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; they noticed that Daniel was was a right
[1:04:20] person.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Daniel was not stealing.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; He was upright. He was not uh pro doing
[1:04:27] prostitution. Daniel was not lying.
[1:04:31] He was not accepting corruption.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; That's the spirits that was in the
[1:04:37] beginning of the the Gentiles.
[1:04:40] And so the those other two governors
[1:04:43] when they saw that they came to to
[1:04:44] Daniel they said Daniel they said Daniel
[1:04:47] can we do some corruption. Then Daniel
[1:04:50] said the law of my God does not allow
[1:04:51] those things. Then they asked Daniel,
[1:04:53] "Can we steal?" He says, "The law of my
[1:04:56] God does not allow that." They said,
[1:04:58] "Well, this man,
[1:05:01] he's uh he's
[1:05:03] [Music]
[1:05:05] he he's becoming uh he's becoming a
[1:05:08] disturbance to us.
[1:05:11] And so, we have to to create something.
[1:05:15] We have to create something to make him
[1:05:17] leave."
[1:05:20] Those are the same spirits working
[1:05:21] today.
[1:05:25] Because the same spirits that started in
[1:05:27] the the beginning of the dispensations,
[1:05:30] it's the same spirits working today.
[1:05:33] When you see a humble man,
[1:05:36] when you see that God uses that man,
[1:05:39] when you say you say you see that that
[1:05:41] person has has gifts,
[1:05:43] the same spirits that worked in that
[1:05:45] day, jealousy will come in, hatred will
[1:05:49] come in. They're going to try to kill
[1:05:51] this one
[1:05:53] and then terrible things will happen.
[1:05:57] And we are seeing the same things
[1:05:59] happening even in our churches.
[1:06:02] Now listen to what these people were
[1:06:04] saying. They said, "Well, this man, he
[1:06:08] doesn't smoke.
[1:06:09] This man is does not cost does not do
[1:06:12] prostitution. He doesn't drink because
[1:06:14] if if he smoked, we could give him
[1:06:17] cigarettes. If he was doing
[1:06:19] prostitution, we could use a woman. But
[1:06:22] he's not into all those things. So to
[1:06:24] get him, what are we going to do?" He
[1:06:27] says, "We're going to find
[1:06:29] we're going to find something in the law
[1:06:31] of his God."
[1:06:34] And that's what the devil does today.
[1:06:38] He will not attack you with prostitution
[1:06:40] if you're not a prostitute.
[1:06:43] He will not give you alcohol if you
[1:06:45] don't drink alcohol.
[1:06:47] But he's going to look for something.
[1:06:51] He will find something in the law of
[1:06:53] your God to destroy you.
[1:06:55] Can somebody say amen?
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; They went to see the king
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; and then they see they find the king.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; They said, "Oh king,
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; live forever."
[1:07:08] Now, now you see this thing of people
[1:07:10] lifting up mankind.
[1:07:13] No, that's that those are things that
[1:07:15] have been impact start that been caused
[1:07:17] since the time of the gent gentile
[1:07:21] at home. We used to say,
[1:07:25] we used to say live forever in our
[1:07:27] language. So to say live forever did not
[1:07:31] start today. It started since the
[1:07:33] beginning of the Gentiles time. They
[1:07:35] said, "Oh, live forever." They said, "Oh
[1:07:38] king, live forever. Live forever."
[1:07:42] So then the king is like, "What
[1:07:44] happened? I'm I'm going to live
[1:07:45] forever." What's happening?
[1:07:48] So be careful with people lifting you
[1:07:50] up. Be careful with people who flatters
[1:07:53] you
[1:07:55] because behind those flatteries there's
[1:07:57] something that can bring difficulties to
[1:07:59] you.
[1:08:01] The king says, "What is this?" They
[1:08:04] said, "Oh king.
[1:08:07] We notice that your kingdom has grown.
[1:08:10] We notice that you're the best pastor
[1:08:13] among all the pastors.
[1:08:16] And so we want you to become the bishop.
[1:08:20] We want you to become like the the
[1:08:22] bishop of everything
[1:08:24] and we want to start lifting you up.
[1:08:30] We want you to to to uh to hold all the
[1:08:32] generation to control all the
[1:08:34] generation. We want you to become the
[1:08:36] successor.
[1:08:40] That's the spirits working today.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; It did not start today.
[1:08:47] It started since the beginning of the
[1:08:50] gentile time.
[1:08:53] So then the king said, "Well, everything
[1:08:55] you're saying is good. So then what are
[1:08:57] you looking for after this?" They said,
[1:08:59] "Well, king, this is what we want."
[1:09:02] Because we see that you have grown so
[1:09:04] much
[1:09:05] and because we see that everything is
[1:09:06] going well. So we want to make a decree.
[1:09:10] We want you to to make a decree that in
[1:09:13] 30 days
[1:09:17] In 30 days, everybody will not worship
[1:09:19] his God. Everyone will worship you. We
[1:09:23] will lift you up.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; And the one who's going to worship
[1:09:28] another God,
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; we want him to we want we want him to be
[1:09:32] thrown in the lion's.
[1:09:35] So, do you understand that the the the
[1:09:37] level of headship
[1:09:41] they created? They created one law to
[1:09:44] disarm the one man of God. One, only
[1:09:46] one.
[1:09:49] But those are things that we're living
[1:09:50] today.
[1:09:53] We, the brides, we are diminished
[1:09:56] at the government level, at work, in the
[1:09:59] law.
[1:10:01] They're always trying to do something
[1:10:05] to try to hurt us. Amen.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; It was already in the promise.
[1:10:12] Because what happened in the the
[1:10:14] beginning of the gentile time that is
[1:10:16] what's happening at the end of the
[1:10:18] gentile time.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; So the king said he says but you're
[1:10:22] coming two of you. There's three
[1:10:24] governors. So where's the other
[1:10:26] governor? They said oh king live forever
[1:10:29] live forever.
[1:10:31] So then he asked where's the other
[1:10:33] governor? He says no just live forever.
[1:10:36] The other one he's going to follow
[1:10:37] everything we're going to say.
[1:10:39] So the king says, "No problem."
[1:10:41] Because in the Meo Persian law,
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; as soon as as soon as the king put his
[1:10:48] signature somewhere,
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; he put his his ring on there and they
[1:10:53] seal it.
[1:10:55] The law can never be turned down.
[1:11:00] Now remember,
[1:11:03] it's the same It's the same law that
[1:11:05] that that put out vast
[1:11:09] It's the same law that put Vasti outside
[1:11:11] of the kingdom and and that's that's the
[1:11:14] same law that
[1:11:17] because the Meo Persians are are strict
[1:11:20] people
[1:11:22] and so with uh
[1:11:25] with uh the king accepted
[1:11:28] he accepted to put his ring and and they
[1:11:31] sealed it and no one could turn it down.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; So what where was the problem?
[1:11:38] That thing was done to to to hurt
[1:11:41] Daniel.
[1:11:43] They went to see Daniel.
[1:11:45] They already knew the times that he
[1:11:46] prays
[1:11:48] because Daniel was praying three times a
[1:11:50] day. As a true Christian,
[1:11:54] Daniel was always looking to the east
[1:11:56] before praying.
[1:11:58] And so they they looked at their their
[1:12:01] watch. They said, "It's in 20 minutes.
[1:12:03] He's going to start in 10 minutes."
[1:12:06] Oh, we we'll catch him.
[1:12:08] He He thinks he's the one who has God.
[1:12:11] We're going to get you. I want to speak
[1:12:13] to a child of God tonight.
[1:12:17] When you attack a child of God,
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; you have to you're going to get
[1:12:25] you're going to get a
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; they were playing with a child of God,
[1:12:31] but they did not know that a
[1:12:34] God was going to fight back.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; So they said, "Well, he's going to start
[1:12:38] in three minutes." They said, "This is
[1:12:40] the time."
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; And so they saw Daniel open the windows.
[1:12:46] He b he he got on on his knee and he
[1:12:48] started praying. Oh, the God the God the
[1:12:50] great Jehovah. They said here here he
[1:12:53] is. They got they say oh Daniel we we
[1:12:56] got you.
[1:12:58] Say what you got me for.
[1:13:01] They told they told him did you not know
[1:13:02] that they made a decree.
[1:13:05] They made a decree that you cannot
[1:13:07] worship another god but the king. Then
[1:13:10] he says well I can't do something like
[1:13:11] that. So they take Daniel and they take
[1:13:14] him to the king
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; and the king is at home and now listen
[1:13:21] people were saying oh king live forever.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Then then he tell he told them are you
[1:13:28] coming back to this? What is this? They
[1:13:29] keep saying oh king we found a man
[1:13:35] he was worshiping another god.
[1:13:37] So then the king says just throw him in
[1:13:40] the lions there. What does the law say?
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; They said, "Oh king,
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; you have to see the person that we're
[1:13:47] talking about."
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; So when the king comes out
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; and he looks at his his most favorite
[1:13:57] person
[1:13:59] and he's he's that person, the family in
[1:14:01] that tribe. Then the king says, "No, we
[1:14:03] cannot do this. I don't I don't I reject
[1:14:07] this for Daniel only." They said, "Oh,
[1:14:09] king
[1:14:11] The letter was already written
[1:14:14] and that letter
[1:14:16] that letter cannot be turned down.
[1:14:19] Daniel will be thrown in the lion's den.
[1:14:23] Even yourself cannot return turn down
[1:14:25] this letter.
[1:14:26] I want to tell every one of you
[1:14:30] that the first letter that was written
[1:14:32] condemned you. The first letter that was
[1:14:35] written
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; put you to death.
[1:14:40] The first letter
[1:14:42] condemned you in everything.
[1:14:46] The first letter even rejected eternal
[1:14:49] life from you.
[1:14:51] The first letter puts you in the
[1:14:52] sentence of the devil. But it was not
[1:14:54] over
[1:14:56] because the second letter had to come.
[1:15:00] Now let me tell you,
[1:15:02] problems can come,
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; but it's only the first letter.
[1:15:07] The story is not over.
[1:15:10] Sickness can come, but it's only the
[1:15:13] first letter.
[1:15:15] The story is not over.
[1:15:18] All the complications can happen. Cancer
[1:15:21] can come.
[1:15:23] Depressions can come.
[1:15:25] Treason can come. But it's only the
[1:15:28] first letter.
[1:15:30] And the first letter
[1:15:33] can even decide my death.
[1:15:36] But as long as the second letter has not
[1:15:40] been validated,
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; nothing will happen.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; I said nothing.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; The king said,
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Daniel,
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Daniel,
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; I've always believed
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; that you have a true God.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; So then, right now,
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm not capable. I'm I'm unable.
[1:16:05] Now, this is a time that needs to happen
[1:16:06] to every Christian.
[1:16:09] The the the umbrella that you're
[1:16:11] expecting,
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; the hope that you have that oh I
[1:16:19] I trust in somebody. God always wants to
[1:16:22] remove that that person that you trust
[1:16:26] because the hope of Daniel was the king.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; But in that day,
[1:16:31] his hope was taken away from him.
[1:16:35] So Daniel,
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; can you guarantee me
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; that the God that you serve
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; is able to deliver you from the lion's
[1:16:45] den?
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; So Daniel said, "Oh king,
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; live forever.
[1:16:52] Let me tell you one thing. My God
[1:16:57] is the one who created lions." Let me
[1:16:59] tell you that my God,
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; he is the creator.
[1:17:05] Even where there's impossibility,
[1:17:08] when my God comes down, impossibility
[1:17:11] becomes possibility.
[1:17:13] Let me tell you tonight
[1:17:16] that our God is more than able.
[1:17:20] Even where death already exists, God is
[1:17:23] able to turn death into eternal life.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; The saints say, "Amen."
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; The king was guaranteed.
[1:17:34] The king says, "Now I see the things are
[1:17:36] going to change." So they took Daniel.
[1:17:40] They took him as a as a as a as a
[1:17:42] gangster.
[1:17:44] So they threw him in the lion's den.
[1:17:47] And when they threw him in the lion's
[1:17:48] den
[1:17:50] for for Daniel's enemy, the story was
[1:17:53] over. To them, the story was over.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says they even published.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; They said, "Oh, that man His ministry
[1:18:04] was already over.
[1:18:06] His story is over.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, Daniel. Who? Who's Daniel?
[1:18:11] Go ask in the lion's den. His story is
[1:18:14] over.
[1:18:16] Now, listen to me carefully.
[1:18:18] As long as your God has not spoken in
[1:18:21] your life,
[1:18:23] anybody can say a word.
[1:18:25] Even your father can say something. Your
[1:18:28] enemy can say something. Your enemies
[1:18:31] can say something but the story is not
[1:18:34] over
[1:18:36] because when he will speak
[1:18:39] his word will fix everything.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Now listen
[1:18:45] the king left.
[1:18:48] The Bible says that in that day
[1:18:52] the king did not sleep with his
[1:18:53] concubines. He slept uh sad
[1:18:59] because because he had just lost if one
[1:19:02] his one of his favorite person and in
[1:19:03] the morning
[1:19:06] the king came
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; he he came in the lion's
[1:19:10] and when he got there he he he screamed
[1:19:14] the same way Jesus Christ
[1:19:17] cried in in the in the tomb of Lazarus
[1:19:19] he says Daniel
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; and when he cried
[1:19:24] so let tell you something first
[1:19:27] because even in the lion's den, God was
[1:19:29] still there.
[1:19:32] Even in the lion's den, God was still
[1:19:35] there.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; When they took Daniel,
[1:19:39] they put him in the lion's den.
[1:19:42] The lions came to devour Daniel.
[1:19:46] And the angel of the Lord, why the Bible
[1:19:49] says that that the angel of the Lord is
[1:19:50] the Lord himself.
[1:19:53] He stood in in the in between and that
[1:19:57] brother says it's the same way that when
[1:19:59] you have difficulties,
[1:20:01] God always sends his angel because the
[1:20:04] Bible says that the angel of the Lord in
[1:20:08] camp among those that fear him and he
[1:20:11] takes them away from every evil. When a
[1:20:14] danger you face a danger, God sends his
[1:20:17] angel and his angel always stands
[1:20:20] between danger and you.
[1:20:23] So when the angel of God stands between
[1:20:25] danger and you
[1:20:27] that means no danger can happen to you.
[1:20:30] Amen.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; You are under the protection.
[1:20:35] Disease can get you but you can can can
[1:20:37] can strike but it will not get you. The
[1:20:40] war can happen but you but it won't
[1:20:42] reach you. Why? Because the angel of the
[1:20:45] Lord stood in between you and that.
[1:20:50] So when the angel of the of the Lord
[1:20:51] stood in between the lions looked,
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; they saw the creator.
[1:20:57] [Music]
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; They said, "Oh, this is the creator."
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; And they they said, "We're going to
[1:21:04] listen to you."
[1:21:08] And those animals started even
[1:21:10] protecting Daniel from all those other
[1:21:12] animals that wanted to eat Daniel.
[1:21:17] God can even use witches in your family.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; And those witches become your protector
[1:21:27] because God used a bird to feed to feed
[1:21:31] Elijah.
[1:21:34] God can use your own enemy
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; and they he can turn your enemy into
[1:21:41] your defenders.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; He is able to do that.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:46] And so Daniel wasn't was secure. Daniel
[1:21:49] could play with the lions.
[1:21:51] He could tell the lions, "Go do this."
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Daniel Daniel could find himself in
[1:21:57] Eden.
[1:21:59] He could tell the lion, "Do this." And
[1:22:00] the lions were following. They were
[1:22:02] obeying his instructions.
[1:22:04] And when the king called Daniel,
[1:22:08] the the the king heard
[1:22:10] there was a little silence
[1:22:13] because I have to tell you
[1:22:17] the silence of God does not mean that
[1:22:20] God is not listening.
[1:22:24] The silence of God means restoration.
[1:22:28] Because I remember in in Revelations
[1:22:33] when there was a silence of of a half an
[1:22:35] hour in that silence,
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; it it was the whole deity that was
[1:22:42] leaving the heavens to come down on
[1:22:44] earth. It was a silence.
[1:22:48] I can even tell you the secret of the
[1:22:50] seventh seal is in silence.
[1:22:54] I'll tell you that when when when when
[1:22:56] Jesus when Jesus cried, "Lazarus, come
[1:23:00] out." There was a little moment of
[1:23:01] silence.
[1:23:04] That silence means a restoration is
[1:23:06] happening. The soul that left had to
[1:23:08] come back. The spirits had to come back
[1:23:12] and they had to to join the body. It was
[1:23:15] restoration that was happening.
[1:23:18] I will tell you tonight
[1:23:20] that all the prayers that she made
[1:23:23] Do not lose faith.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; You did not get it.
[1:23:28] Lose everything,
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; but do not lose your faith.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Do not lose faith.
[1:23:37] Lose everything.
[1:23:41] Do not ever lose faith in your prayer.
[1:23:44] Amen.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Even if God did not answer today, he
[1:23:49] will answer tomorrow.
[1:23:51] If he did not answer late last week, he
[1:23:54] will answer next week. If he didn't do
[1:23:56] it this month, he will do it next month.
[1:24:00] Because when God gives,
[1:24:02] he always gives in a due season,
[1:24:05] he always good gives in in a good
[1:24:07] season. God does not give in a mess. And
[1:24:10] when God gives you something,
[1:24:13] no one can take that thing away from
[1:24:15] you.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen?
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen?
[1:24:21] That's our God.
[1:24:23] The silence of God
[1:24:26] does not mean that God did not hear you.
[1:24:28] The silence of God does not mean that
[1:24:31] God is not seeing you. He's he's he sees
[1:24:34] you because he's always done that. I can
[1:24:37] see in Babylon the three Hebrews,
[1:24:40] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedne
[1:24:43] when they were under that sentence of
[1:24:45] the king, the king of Babylon,
[1:24:48] they asked him to worship the statue of
[1:24:50] Daniel and they refused.
[1:24:53] And while when they refused, they
[1:24:55] accepted to die. Brother says they
[1:24:58] prayed,
[1:24:59] they interceded.
[1:25:01] Heaven was closed.
[1:25:04] But they did not know
[1:25:06] that in that silence
[1:25:09] there was a battle in heaven.
[1:25:12] Angels were walking walking in and
[1:25:16] while while they when they thought that
[1:25:17] they were
[1:25:19] in heaven there were angels.
[1:25:22] Michael could come. He he brings his
[1:25:24] sword. He says look what's happening.
[1:25:27] God send me and I'll go I I'll destroy
[1:25:31] that kingdom.
[1:25:32] God could tell him, "No, stay right
[1:25:34] there. That's my That's my problem."
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Gabriel could say,
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; he says, "God, don't you see? Send me
[1:25:43] and I'll finish this." Gabriel said,
[1:25:45] "Stand aside. Absence could come." He
[1:25:48] could warm could come, could say. He
[1:25:51] says, "Remember that the flood I did
[1:25:54] this, send me,
[1:25:57] and I'm going to go finish that fire."
[1:26:00] God told Warmwood, "Stand right there
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; for the for the the the salvation of my
[1:26:06] children. I don't send an angel.
[1:26:09] I need to go save them myself. There
[1:26:12] won't be an angel that that's going to
[1:26:14] go there.
[1:26:16] In that silence,
[1:26:19] God was working.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[1:26:23] It's when they they they were counting 1
[1:26:25] 2 3.
[1:26:27] That's when God was already in the fire.
[1:26:30] He was in the fire.
[1:26:33] I will tell you tonight,
[1:26:36] God sent me here to tell you
[1:26:38] that in your difficulties,
[1:26:41] in your distress, God has not fors
[1:26:44] forgot about you.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; I'm finishing.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Daniel
[1:26:52] responded. He says, "Oh king,
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; live forever.
[1:26:57] The king said, "What? Daniel is alive.
[1:27:01] Daniel's alive." Then he calls everybody
[1:27:03] come. Come bring get Daniel out of here.
[1:27:06] He's alive. The Bible says that Daniel
[1:27:10] came out alive.
[1:27:15] He did not even have a scar.
[1:27:18] He was he was he was
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; he was alive. Now listen,
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; the first letter
[1:27:27] The first letter condemned in
[1:27:30] now listen
[1:27:32] about the second letter
[1:27:37] because the second letter is what your
[1:27:39] enemy is going to have tonight.
[1:27:42] He says, "Listen, Daniel,
[1:27:45] you need to write a letter right now and
[1:27:48] start writing.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Me, the king of Babylon, I decide
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; and I declare
[1:27:58] without uh
[1:28:03] all everything that happened that we
[1:28:04] wrote before. It's we're going to finish
[1:28:07] with that first article of that of that
[1:28:09] letter.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; The first letter says all other gods are
[1:28:15] no longer useful.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; The only God,
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; the only God that can be lifted up, the
[1:28:23] only God that can be worshiped,
[1:28:26] The only God that we can worship is the
[1:28:29] God of Daniel.
[1:28:32] He says, "You told me to write what?
[1:28:35] Write down. It's the God of Daniel." I'm
[1:28:37] telling you to write this down. It's the
[1:28:39] God of Daniel. It was not over. He says,
[1:28:42] "Second article. Write down
[1:28:47] from now on
[1:28:50] all the enemies of Daniel,
[1:28:53] not just them,
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; their children,
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; their wives, they will be thrown in the
[1:28:59] lion's den.
[1:29:03] I love the God of William Brandham
[1:29:07] because the one who was the God of
[1:29:08] Daniel yesterday.
[1:29:11] It's the God of William Brham,
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; he's the same yesterday,
[1:29:16] today and forever.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; What he did yesterday,
[1:29:21] he can do it today.
[1:29:23] Amen.
[1:29:25] After writing
[1:29:28] the the the king's son,
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; the the king put his his ring on there.
[1:29:33] He sealed it and the law became you
[1:29:38] could not turn it down. He wrote you.
[1:29:41] So when you play with a child of God,
[1:29:43] that's why when I when I I always tell
[1:29:46] those witches in Africa,
[1:29:49] I always tell them be careful
[1:29:52] because I tell them when you play with a
[1:29:53] child of God,
[1:29:55] You may think that it's an easy thing to
[1:29:56] do.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Playing
[1:30:00] playing with a child of God, it's like
[1:30:02] you're playing with a gun.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; You see, when someone's playing with a
[1:30:06] gun, when someone's playing with a
[1:30:08] knife,
[1:30:09] so everything can happen when you play
[1:30:11] with it. Because when you play with it,
[1:30:15] a bullets can come can get into you.
[1:30:19] That's how the bullets got into the the
[1:30:21] the the enemies of Daniel.
[1:30:25] They captured the enemies of Daniel
[1:30:28] and they put them in the lion's den.
[1:30:31] The Bible declares
[1:30:34] that there was no angel to save them.
[1:30:39] They even broke their wounds.
[1:30:41] Listen,
[1:30:43] because
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; because of the sin of one person,
[1:30:48] their children were also brought into it
[1:30:51] and their wives were also brought into
[1:30:53] it.
[1:30:55] Do you see the consequences that you get
[1:30:57] when you play with a child of God? A son
[1:31:00] of God is a thunder.
[1:31:04] You do not mess up mess with him and you
[1:31:06] just get rid of him. Get away with him.
[1:31:08] When you mess with a child of God,
[1:31:12] You you have to wait for God to fight
[1:31:14] back.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Expect God to fight back.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you one thing.
[1:31:20] Jealousy.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Jealousy is the demon that's destroying
[1:31:25] today.
[1:31:28] Because that demon started in the
[1:31:30] dispensation of the Gentiles.
[1:31:32] I'm going to read you a second quote
[1:31:34] here, then I'll finish from it.
[1:31:37] Jealousy is a is a bad demon.
[1:31:40] It's a very bad demon.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Jealousy.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; It's a It's a bad demon.
[1:31:55] You're going to see that even from the
[1:31:56] start in the beginning when God created
[1:31:59] Abel and Cain.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; You're going to notice
[1:32:05] that in that time
[1:32:11] I'm in a sermon does God change
[1:32:14] his mind about his word? Paragraph 90.
[1:32:19] I'm going to I'm going to finish.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; If that kind of spirits is in you
[1:32:26] tonight,
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; I want you to pray a lot
[1:32:33] because you find you find someone in
[1:32:35] church.
[1:32:38] Every time that person sees his brother,
[1:32:42] every time he sees his brother
[1:32:43] well-dressed, he feels bad.
[1:32:47] Every time he sees his brother pay his
[1:32:49] house, it it hurts him.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Especially on the sister's side.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; You you find a sister who tells you, "I
[1:32:59] don't like that sister right here."
[1:33:02] Then you ask her, "Why don't you like
[1:33:03] her?"
[1:33:06] Then she then she says, "Every every
[1:33:08] time I see her, no, that's the devil."
[1:33:11] The prophet says, "Hatred comes from the
[1:33:13] devil. You have to be careful.
[1:33:18] As soon as you as soon as you start
[1:33:21] feeling a little bit of hatred towards
[1:33:23] your brother, know that it's the
[1:33:26] presence of Satan in you. Brother Brham
[1:33:28] says,
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; he says, "Notice."
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He says, "Notice."
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; And it's always caused the natural to
[1:33:39] hate the spiritual.
[1:33:41] My brethrens,
[1:33:44] when you are spiritual, you will always
[1:33:46] be hated. When you do good, you will
[1:33:48] always be hated. When you are a good
[1:33:50] person, you will always be hated.
[1:33:54] Now, the problem is not hatred.
[1:33:57] The problem is to know who are those
[1:33:58] ones hating.
[1:34:00] It's those people who are carnal.
[1:34:03] Listen, brother Ram says,
[1:34:08] "It caused Cain to hate Abel.
[1:34:13] It caused Kora to hate Moses.
[1:34:17] It caused Judas to hate Jesus." And on
[1:34:19] and on.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; It causes the natural to hate the
[1:34:24] spiritual.
[1:34:27] Just as Cain in the beginning hated
[1:34:29] Abel,
[1:34:32] He says the one that God received the
[1:34:35] sacrifice and tries they tried to
[1:34:37] destroy them
[1:34:40] and tries to destroy them.
[1:34:42] [Music]
[1:34:44] Even they try to destroy the influence
[1:34:46] and destroy everything.
[1:34:49] Brother says because it's it's jealous.
[1:34:51] It's nothing but jealousy.
[1:34:55] It started in Cain
[1:34:59] and proved that it was jealousy.
[1:35:02] And it's still the same thing today.
[1:35:04] Today
[1:35:06] when the natural
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; and the carnal and the spiritual meet
[1:35:11] together,
[1:35:13] it proves it's Satan no other way.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Because jealousy
[1:35:19] comes from Satan
[1:35:23] and then causes an impersonation of the
[1:35:26] truth.
[1:35:29] Somebody
[1:35:32] somebody to try to impersonate something
[1:35:34] that he hasn't been that that he hasn't
[1:35:36] been ordained to do. He says, "How much
[1:35:38] have we seen today?" We have seen a lot
[1:35:41] of it today.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; My brother, jealousy is a bad demon. I
[1:35:47] I'm saying I insist it's a bad demon.
[1:35:50] Cain and Abel.
[1:35:53] Instead of doing like his brother did,
[1:35:56] he went to everything started by with
[1:36:00] jealousy.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Moses,
[1:36:03] God called, God anointed him. God
[1:36:08] established him as a prophet. But but
[1:36:10] Kora
[1:36:12] Kora,
[1:36:14] they started criticizing.
[1:36:18] Does Moses think he's the only one here?
[1:36:21] So look how those people
[1:36:24] they did not die by the death that
[1:36:26] everybody died of. They were they were
[1:36:29] uh uh they were um
[1:36:33] they were they were swallowed by the
[1:36:34] earth.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you
[1:36:39] jealousy is not a good thing.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; How is it that you are in church?
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; As soon as you see someone dressing well
[1:36:52] You start you're starting to feel bad.
[1:36:54] That's jealousy and you don't even want
[1:36:56] to look at him.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Now listen to what you say in your mind.
[1:36:59] You say, "Oh, he's prideful. Oh, he's
[1:37:01] prideful."
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; No, he's not prideful.
[1:37:04] You You are jealous and you and Satan is
[1:37:07] in you.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you the truth.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; We live in an age
[1:37:17] where poison is even uh in the church as
[1:37:20] well.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Assassinations happen in church. What is
[1:37:25] it?
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Satan has come in our midst.
[1:37:31] In the beginning of the dispensation, it
[1:37:33] was the same way
[1:37:35] and we have to be careful
[1:37:37] that we put those things outside
[1:37:41] because we live in the times of wonders.
[1:37:45] I'll finish by saying
[1:37:47] the letter of the king today is the
[1:37:50] message of the end time
[1:37:54] because when the king wrote
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; they wrote in in all languages
[1:38:01] you speak English
[1:38:04] they're going to write voice of God in
[1:38:05] English send it
[1:38:09] the the original seed
[1:38:12] the spoken word send it everywhere.
[1:38:14] where they send it. But they said you
[1:38:18] what language do you speak? You speak
[1:38:19] Chiluba? Write it in Chiluba. Send it to
[1:38:21] them. They said what language do you
[1:38:24] speak? Swahili. Okay. Write it in
[1:38:25] Swahili and send it to them. What
[1:38:27] language do you speak? French. Write it
[1:38:30] in French and send it to them.
[1:38:33] And as soon as you received the letter
[1:38:35] of the king,
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; if you were worshiping idols, you had to
[1:38:40] throw them away because the letter is
[1:38:42] already telling you.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; We need to know the one who needs to to
[1:38:49] be worshiped. We need to know who needs
[1:38:51] to be lifted up. We need we need to know
[1:38:53] who needs to be worshiped.
[1:38:55] And it's only the Lord Jesus Christ. May
[1:38:58] God bless you.
[1:39:06] Amen.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; We heard from the Lord tonight
[1:39:25] in such a special way.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just hope that when he returns
[1:39:31] my calendar is open.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I was blessed.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; And and that's so true because
[1:39:43] even people who follow the message
[1:39:47] still have not understood or understand
[1:39:51] that the only true living God
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; is the God that William Brandom served.
[1:39:59] That's what we
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; he brought us to true revelation of
[1:40:02] Jesus Christ
[1:40:06] and and that is definitely wonderful.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; And so when he first started, I mean
[1:40:14] where it was headed
[1:40:17] and I I I was already rejoicing in my
[1:40:19] soul
[1:40:22] because that that's nothing but truth
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; and I was so blessed.
[1:40:29] because he didn't leave everything back
[1:40:31] there.
[1:40:35] He brought it all back to us.
[1:40:39] And that is the only true sign
[1:40:43] that if you truly believe what brother
[1:40:44] Brandon,
[1:40:48] you're living
[1:40:51] [Music]
[1:40:52] and his whole message
[1:40:55] about the Holy Ghost.
[1:40:59] God bringing you into a perfection.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; I love that.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; I love that.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; And I really appreciate our,
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; you know, at the first I was nervous.
[1:41:16] I really believe God had me to ask him.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Don't get mad with me now.
[1:41:25] But I don't trust all congalles.
[1:41:30] Preach us.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; So I was nervous.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; That's what you felt earlier.
[1:41:44] But I I want to say it like this.
[1:41:47] If William Brandon was here,
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; see William,
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; he would have been so well pleased
[1:41:54] the way he brought the message.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; So we thank you.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; I'll never forget you.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. No, not prolonging the time.
[1:42:16] God has been so good to us.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Anybody need prayer?
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; You got some You got a lot tonight.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; I hope you
[1:42:32] in the soul.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:42:40] Hallelujah. Are you blessed?
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing the long he
[1:42:45] abides. Amen. Trust you believe that.
[1:42:48] Amen. Hallelujah. Oh, I'm rejoicing
[1:42:52] night and day as I walk that pilgrim way
[1:42:57] for the hand of God in all my life I
[1:43:01] see.
[1:43:03] And the reason of my bliss, yes, a
[1:43:07] secret all is this, that the comforter
[1:43:12] abides with peace.
[1:43:15] Oh, he abides.
[1:43:19] He abides.
[1:43:22] Hallelujah. He abide with me.
[1:43:28] I'm rejoicing night and day. As I walk
[1:43:33] that narrow way,
[1:43:36] Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up. I'm
[1:43:39] sorry. Pastor Elonga, forgive me. Come
[1:43:43] say something.
[1:43:46] Y'all know me.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Didn't mean to do that. It was on my
[1:43:52] mind to do it and then I totally forgot
[1:43:54] just that moment.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; So, we want him to say something. We
[1:43:59] appreciate our pastor.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Give him a round of applause.
[1:44:12] May God bless you.
[1:44:14] May God bless you.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; I have just something to say.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Just a prayer.
[1:44:27] I was uh
[1:44:30] so we were preparing to pray in the
[1:44:34] office. That's why I was going there. I
[1:44:35] believe with all my heart
[1:44:44] that there is a new letter in today
[1:44:47] today. Amen.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; And I believe it
[1:44:55] and so something was recommended to us
[1:44:57] to do
[1:44:59] to do for everyone who listened to heard
[1:45:01] this today.
[1:45:04] And it was it's something we're going to
[1:45:05] do in the office. And so we're going to
[1:45:07] go in the office. We're waiting for you
[1:45:09] in the office.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; We love you and may God richly bless
[1:45:12] you.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we miss we we don't have
[1:45:16] enough words in the pulpit to say
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; because they all they only seem to be
[1:45:21] words, but God knows the heart.
[1:45:25] May God bless you.
[1:45:29] I'm sure that we have all received. May
[1:45:32] God richly bless you.

[1:46:45] I had no peace within, till I heard
[1:46:49] Jesus died upon the tree.
[1:46:54] Then I fell down at his feet and there
[1:46:58] came a peace so sweet. Now the comforter
