[46:21] glory in the name of the Lord Jesus
[46:24] Christ Our God amen amen
[46:32] Corinthians chapter 10.
[46:36] starting verse 4.
[46:40] yep
[46:45] for the weapons of our Warfare are not
[46:48] of the flesh but
[46:54] have divine power to destroy strongholds
[47:12] we destroy arguments in every lofty
[47:14] opinions raised against the knowledge of
[47:16] God and take every thought captive to
[47:18] obey Christ in your opinions
[47:21] may the Lord blesses the word that we
[47:23] just read you can regain your seat
[47:26] thank you
[47:33] I think every one of you for listening
[47:36] to the word of God sitting here
[47:40] and I also thank Brothers
[47:45] I was not supposed to speak this morning
[47:48] brother Isaac brother Isaac was supposed
[47:51] to speak this morning he was supposed to
[47:54] speak this morning
[47:59] now he just told me at midnight that he
[48:02] was not feeling well
[48:05] and that's why he's not with us this
[48:07] morning
[48:09] and I want you to remember him in your
[48:12] prayers
[48:14] so the Lord can strengthen him
[48:20] now I would like to share this little
[48:23] topic called let's
[48:28] um let's destroy all reasonings
[48:34] brother Brown says in the that in the
[48:37] Garden of Eden uh
[48:43] when Eve was in the Garden of Eden with
[48:45] Adam
[48:49] Now Eve started reasoning with the word
[48:54] it brought death that reasoning brought
[48:57] death
[48:59] is
[49:01] now when Eve started doubting of the
[49:04] word of God
[49:06] [Music]
[49:08] that's what brought death to the human
[49:11] race
[49:11] [Music]
[49:14] and everything and it brought everything
[49:16] we have is suffering today
[49:21] and that was only because one person
[49:23] doubted the word
[49:28] and that's why Brethren says in the
[49:31] message the testimony of Jesus Christ
[49:35] preached in in 1953
[49:40] he says in paragraph
[49:43] 11. if a man is born of the spirit of
[49:47] God
[49:50] he doesn't listen to reasonings at all
[49:56] God cannot be reasoned you believe God
[50:01] God is believed
[50:03] you don't reason with God
[50:06] you don't reason on God
[50:09] but you believe God
[50:16] and brother says we don't know God by
[50:19] theology
[50:21] we don't know God by education
[50:26] we don't know God by reasons
[50:31] but we know God by by faith
[50:35] and it's beyond reasonings amen amen
[50:39] okay
[50:41] there's no education that makes you know
[50:43] Gods
[50:48] Seminary it's not a theology that makes
[50:50] you know God
[50:53] it's not all those things that make you
[50:55] know God
[50:57] but you know God by faith
[51:03] says faith is beyond reason
[51:07] you can't reason but you're sick
[51:11] that's what makes it so real to us
[51:16] believersible
[51:20] yes my brothers
[51:29] yes my brothers and sisters
[51:32] I want to tell you this morning
[51:36] that we don't know God by
[52:04] he says that Faith controls every
[52:07] circumstance
[52:09] no matter how great that circumstance
[52:14] no matter how great difficult
[52:19] Faith Masters all circumstances
[52:31] his vision is it is a vision from
[52:34] foreign
[52:37] foreign
[53:51] [Applause]
[54:01] binoculars
[54:50] [Applause]
[55:59] no my brothers
[56:17] he raised in this end time
[56:24] yes sir yes my brothers
[56:27] now I want you this morning
[56:31] I want you to see yourself
[56:34] did you see yourself as a man
[56:37] a Christian of a good reputation
[57:25] you don't have anything to do with that
[57:47] [Applause]
[57:48] he doesn't look at your circumstances
[57:53] miss my brothers and sisters brother
[57:56] Brown says
[58:08] and that the Lord has revealed that this
[58:11] thing is going to happen
[58:14] you just say it and go forward
[58:20] says don't ask questions
[58:24] see
[58:32] Elementary
[58:35] Masters all circumstances
[58:42] Faith believes that God will bring that
[58:44] thing through
[58:46] yeah
[58:49] I don't know
[58:52] the only question you can ask yourself
[58:55] is
[58:57] that I don't know how it's going to
[59:00] happen
[59:02] we know that God will bring it through
[59:15] he received them as a person coming from
[59:18] the dead
[59:21] because based on all circumstances
[59:25] based on all events
[59:30] Abraham could never ever hope to have
[59:33] ice that's why the Bible says
[59:40] as a person coming from the dead
[59:52] and just go forward
[59:56] that's what I want you to do this
[59:58] morning
[1:00:02] if you ask yourself questions
[1:00:05] if you start reasoning
[1:00:08] I'll bring you to a place
[1:00:11] where your reasoning will stop
[1:00:23] when Joshua found himself in front of
[1:00:26] the the walls of Jericho yes
[1:00:30] I want you to explain to me how how is
[1:00:35] it going to be with a scientific system
[1:00:39] how is it that just going turn going
[1:00:42] around
[1:00:43] that the wall will fall
[1:01:09] they're not kernels
[1:01:18] that's our weapon
[1:01:28] just because the people of Israel turned
[1:01:31] around seven times
[1:01:34] that wall there
[1:01:36] is
[1:01:39] now horses could have gone around that
[1:01:42] wall
[1:01:45] now just think how how uh how wide it
[1:01:49] was the wall was
[1:01:51] it was great
[1:01:54] but the power of God
[1:01:59] look at how wide was the Wall
[1:02:02] Street
[1:02:05] go around the world
[1:02:09] never never
[1:02:12] he only believes
[1:02:15] he did what God told him to do my
[1:02:18] brothers
[1:02:20] I can tell you to do something
[1:02:24] don't look at what somebody else look at
[1:02:27] what God told you
[1:02:46] he will fulfill his word
[1:02:49] amen amen
[1:02:53] now listen to this
[1:02:56] throw my number dude
[1:02:59] in the sermon don't lean do not lean
[1:03:01] unto your own understanding
[1:03:05] go home to it he says in paragraph 48
[1:03:17] .
[1:03:18] in paragraph 148
[1:03:22] .
[1:03:24] it says what would have happened
[1:03:29] if Moses leaned unto his own
[1:03:32] understanding
[1:03:37] when God told him that he would go down
[1:03:39] to Egypt
[1:03:43] or the children of Israel from the end
[1:03:46] of Affairs
[1:03:50] what would have happened if Moses leaned
[1:03:53] unto his own understanding
[1:03:55] when he was there
[1:03:58] on fire
[1:04:05] go and I'll be with you
[1:04:26] what would have happened
[1:04:32] if you were there in that time
[1:04:35] what would you have said
[1:04:47] Moses why all his noise
[1:04:52] God told Moses to tell other people of
[1:04:54] Israel
[1:04:56] stand still
[1:04:59] and see okay
[1:05:02] Deliverance that the Lord will give you
[1:05:05] this day
[1:05:06] brother Brandon says
[1:05:10] maybe Moses never even saw a vision
[1:05:12] before saying that
[1:05:48] he's gone
[1:06:47] that's when he gets into the scene
[1:07:15] [Applause]
[1:07:21] [Music]
[1:07:34] [Applause]
[1:07:49] intestine
[1:07:53] [Applause]
[1:07:59] that same power came down
[1:08:02] and it said foreign
[1:08:14] [Applause]
[1:08:33] [Applause]
[1:08:47] I give you life again
[1:09:16] tell me how that was possible
[1:09:29] [Applause]
[1:09:54] [Applause]
[1:10:00] [Applause]
[1:10:09] in the book of Exodus
[1:10:16] he explodes
[1:10:25] in the book of Exodus first part
[1:10:28] in the slides uh in 1955. but he says
[1:10:35] all of that is just a a thunder with no
[1:10:38] with no power
[1:10:40] but I'm I'm giving you an assurance
[1:10:44] that when Jesus Christ had known to you
[1:10:50] pray for free you're not made of
[1:10:53] materials that can go away in the slides
[1:10:56] that's why
[1:10:59] Moses could not run away from face
[1:11:03] because he was anointed
[1:11:06] the anointing
[1:11:08] that's why
[1:11:10] he could not run away
[1:11:12] well maybe you didn't understand
[1:11:18] when Jesus Christ anoints you
[1:11:21] material for free you're not made of
[1:11:24] materials that can run away
[1:11:28] I believe that this should raise you up
[1:11:32] because being anointed
[1:11:37] no matter what the devil can show you we
[1:11:40] can't run away
[1:11:43] we are made of materials that cannot run
[1:11:47] because everything the devil is
[1:11:51] the devil is just a thunder with no
[1:11:54] power is a liar everything he does is
[1:11:58] lying
[1:12:00] okay amen
[1:12:03] Hallelujah
[1:12:05] I'm happy this morning
[1:12:10] to find myself standing in front of the
[1:12:13] anointed Church of God brother Brown
[1:12:16] says again
[1:12:19] that the Holy Ghost comes to live in you
[1:12:24] to remove all everything that says
[1:12:33] when it comes to live in your hearts
[1:12:41] it brings your heart to believe that I
[1:12:43] can do it
[1:12:47] everything the devil makes you that
[1:12:49] makes you say
[1:12:51] but when the Holy Ghost comes to living
[1:12:54] and so that you can say I can
[1:13:02] I can
[1:13:08] I don't know how sit down in 2007
[1:13:13] I was sleeping yes
[1:13:17] the Lord showed me that I would live in
[1:13:19] the in the United States
[1:13:21] in 2007.
[1:13:25] I only met my wife five years later
[1:13:29] the Lord showed me that I would live in
[1:13:32] in the United States
[1:13:34] when I woke up I told my father
[1:13:39] I told my father this is what I saw this
[1:13:41] night
[1:13:43] the Lord showed me that I will live in
[1:13:45] in the United States
[1:13:48] and that I would receive you in my house
[1:13:54] I will make I will make you visit all
[1:13:57] the churches that you'll go sit down it
[1:13:59] was in 2007.
[1:14:03] in 2012 I met my wife
[1:14:07] with no hope that we could even get
[1:14:10] married
[1:14:11] and before I married
[1:14:14] I asked God a sign
[1:14:16] I asked Lord
[1:14:20] I don't want to go into this thing is
[1:14:25] knowing where I stand
[1:14:28] but I just need to have an absolute in
[1:14:30] whatever I'm doing
[1:14:32] and I told God one day
[1:14:36] I feel like I love this girl
[1:14:39] without having her tell me that she
[1:14:42] loves me
[1:14:45] with nothing showing that I would marry
[1:14:48] her once
[1:14:51] I usually don't tell talk about my
[1:14:53] personal stories
[1:14:55] but I want the story to help somebody
[1:14:59] because we also have young people that
[1:15:02] want that are aspire to get married so
[1:15:03] it can always help somebody
[1:15:05] now one day I pray I said Lawrence
[1:15:10] it's been long that I've seen things in
[1:15:12] dreams and sometimes sometimes
[1:15:17] I don't need a dream
[1:15:20] I'm not looking for anything else
[1:15:23] I just won
[1:15:49] and
[1:15:51] forget about her
[1:16:15] now when she got in my heart started
[1:16:18] beating
[1:16:43] [Applause]
[1:16:49] I
[1:16:56] saw her come in and then she sat down
[1:17:04] I said to myself whether the devil
[1:17:07] whether the devil likes it or not I will
[1:17:09] marry this girl
[1:17:11] and that's how things happen
[1:17:13] and a year later
[1:17:16] I heard that she was traveling to go in
[1:17:19] America then I was like
[1:17:26] I was like is this the way God made
[1:17:29] predestinated things to happen
[1:17:32] then I waited for all those years
[1:17:35] that she left
[1:17:37] puts the shores
[1:17:40] mockeries
[1:17:41] uh critic critics
[1:17:45] but I had one thing on me
[1:17:48] I was fixing my eyes on the objective
[1:17:51] that God showed me and I'm right here
[1:17:54] standing it's just so you can see
[1:17:59] when God
[1:18:04] your neighbor says it doesn't matter to
[1:18:07] you
[1:18:23] [Applause]
[1:18:25] they'll always be there
[1:18:28] those people will always be there
[1:18:33] if the devil tempted the Lord Jesus
[1:18:36] Christ himself
[1:18:41] the devil the Bible says the devil raise
[1:18:44] Jesus Christ
[1:18:45] they put him on a mountain
[1:18:49] not that Jesus Christ
[1:18:59] I don't know if you understand this
[1:19:04] now
[1:19:08] that he just took him took him the
[1:19:10] mountain
[1:19:13] he brought him on the on on the top of
[1:19:16] the table and he told him you're a Son
[1:19:19] of God throw yourself down there
[1:19:24] now what can the devil not do to you
[1:19:28] he will come certainly
[1:19:32] the devil will be following us
[1:19:35] he will follow you he will chase you
[1:19:38] every day because you're not his
[1:19:41] children
[1:19:42] and he will not play with you
[1:19:45] the principle the goal of the devil
[1:19:48] is to destroy him
[1:19:51] God Jesus told people yeah Peter
[1:19:54] certainly see that's nice
[1:19:57] the devil claimed you
[1:20:01] know
[1:20:03] he wanted he wanted to uh to to to to to
[1:20:08] sift you
[1:20:11] but I prayed for you
[1:20:12] [Applause]
[1:20:34] [Applause]
[1:20:55] because it's only the devil that came to
[1:20:58] use him
[1:21:02] now
[1:21:05] I want to say this before closing
[1:21:08] brother Brennan says
[1:21:11] that the biggest curse
[1:21:15] is to not know who you are
[1:21:18] foreign
[1:22:01] I don't know if you've ever heard this
[1:22:03] before
[1:22:11] in the water
[1:22:14] um
[1:22:15] ever present in uh
[1:22:26] he says that the children of God
[1:22:29] is
[1:22:32] if it was not controlled by the the the
[1:22:37] faith they would have created another
[1:22:40] world
[1:22:41] and they would have lived their present
[1:22:43] life there in the ever-present water
[1:22:47] I believe that it's a strong statement
[1:22:52] now we you don't don't neglect
[1:22:56] you have to recognize your place
[1:23:02] and for what God called you foreign
[1:23:44] [Music]
[1:23:45] [Applause]
[1:24:04] and
[1:24:06] all those things
[1:24:48] right there
[1:24:51] now listen to this foreign
[1:25:22] here in Jeffersonville and where you're
[1:25:25] listening to those tapes
[1:25:28] do you know where you stand said
[1:25:32] do you know that you have been called by
[1:25:35] God
[1:25:37] that the Holy Ghost lives in your heart
[1:25:44] and every word of God is real to you oh
[1:25:48] brother
[1:25:52] how is Satan going to stand again
[1:25:56] if God is called
[1:25:59] if you know where you stand said took
[1:26:02] her do you know that you you have been
[1:26:05] called
[1:26:06] [Applause]
[1:26:07] and that every word of God if it is true
[1:26:13] how will Satan stand against that no
[1:26:16] Satan no Satan cannot stand
[1:26:37] [Applause]
[1:27:11] and now
[1:27:15] in the last days
[1:27:18] with every seed sowed
[1:27:22] now I stopped it a little bit right
[1:27:24] there
[1:27:28] now I want to start again so you can
[1:27:30] understand
[1:27:32] he says whatever you do
[1:27:40] you do so they they were wrong
[1:27:44] they put they said they put them in in
[1:27:46] in the Lions
[1:27:48] they were caught in pieces
[1:27:53] he's talking about the children of
[1:27:57] goddesses
[1:28:01] by all kinds of ways they were killed
[1:28:03] now he says
[1:28:07] you can't kill it
[1:28:10] no matter how much they kill the Saints
[1:28:15] but they could never killed the power
[1:28:18] that were in the Saints
[1:28:20] you can't kill it well yeah
[1:28:23] [Music]
[1:28:24] the church that's predestinated
[1:28:28] those who he foreign
[1:28:39] glorified

[1:29:20] at the end and see yourself as a

[1:29:26] ability to see yourself as a cold
[1:29:29] no matter what the circumstances are
[1:29:32] yeah

[1:30:15] is in her position
[1:30:19] I want you to recognize your position
[1:30:23] because the church is already in her
[1:30:26] position
[1:30:28] don't don't live in the past

[1:30:34] where the church knows her position
[1:30:37] every believer knows his position
[1:30:42] ability he says
[1:30:47] the evening lights the seed
[1:30:50] less and the signs
