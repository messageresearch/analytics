[47:02] that is now uh working uh in South
[47:08] Africa in in New
[47:11] Zealand as well as the
[47:13] Congo and they have started putting
[47:16] pressure on the
[47:19] people sadly to
[47:23] say there are some Churches who
[47:27] were part of this
[47:30] message that have now succumbed to the
[47:35] pressure of the Council of
[47:41] churches uh over over even in
[47:45] Trinidad um some of the churches have
[47:51] succumbed to the pressure of of the
[47:53] Council of churches
[47:57] in the
[47:59] trinidadians it is the
[48:01] Pentecostal who is now heading this
[48:08] move and basically you can't become a
[48:10] church or be a
[48:15] church unless you be part of
[48:19] this this this
[48:21] move now brother Bram told us that these
[48:24] things will happen
[48:27] it's not yet here in the States but you
[48:29] know it's
[48:32] coming I'm going to read something uh
[48:35] this is referring to the
[48:41] Congo the Blue Print name social pack
[48:44] for
[48:49] peace and living well together in the de
[48:53] uh uh Democratic Republic of Congo
[49:01] the greater Lake
[49:04] Region is the joint work of the Churches
[49:07] of Christ in
[49:12] Congo the union of the Union of over 60
[49:17] Protestant
[49:23] denominations and the Catholic Church
[49:26] World Council of churches
[49:31] reported the United Nations says on
[49:34] January
[49:39] 24th it is Gravely concerned about the
[49:42] Safety and Security of
[49:48] civilians and internally displace people
[49:51] in this in the Eastern de Democratic
[49:54] Republic of the Congo he's on
[50:00] at the launch of the church's
[50:08] blueprint Reverend Eric
[50:12] ning General Secretary of the Church of
[50:15] Christ in
[50:19] Congo and
[50:21] fr brother brother
[50:26] sh surely General Secretary of the
[50:29] national Episcopal Conference of Congo
[50:33] said the
[50:40] secret said that the peace and the
[50:42] living well
[50:46] together were an urgent emergency that
[50:48] stood at the people's doorsteps
[51:00] in this Year of Jubilee our prophetic
[51:03] missions makes it our duty to
[51:12] exort people communities and the state
[51:15] of our sub region to fulfill the duty of
[51:18] human
[51:23] beings toward themselves
[51:30] that the peaceful coexistence and
[51:33] supportive coexistence said the leader
[51:36] in a statement we have to read it
[51:57] amen so I thought I'd read that to you
[52:00] this was given to me by a
[52:03] brother but I just want you to realize
[52:05] that we're not
[52:07] far from that
[52:12] translation we know it's going to
[52:15] work it is the Gathering of the Council
[52:20] of
[52:22] churches and like the prophet of God
[52:25] said only interested in the
[52:30] bride because we are the only true
[52:36] Protestants he used Samson for an
[52:40] example and he said before they
[52:43] presented
[52:46] Samson in the time of his
[52:50] persecution in the arena they had all
[52:52] kinds of Tricks going on
[52:58] all kind of animal tricks from monkeys
[53:00] and
[53:01] [Music]
[53:03] everything but he said the main
[53:09] attraction was
[53:12] Samson so understand
[53:14] this they
[53:16] know that the True
[53:19] Believers that follows malach
[53:22] 4 will not bow to that
[53:29] but understand this like I've always
[53:33] said the 70 has already departed from
[53:36] jesus'
[53:41] Ministry but Judas
[53:47] remain remember that and Judas was a
[53:51] part of the congregation or the
[53:55] message Jesus
[53:58] Christ you love the
[54:01] Lord now let's get to our
[54:04] subject we thank God for his
[54:09] amazing
[54:11] grace to me Grace is is
[54:15] forever it it just it just
[54:19] continues and as long as we are in this
[54:24] realm you're going to need Grace
[54:29] we understand by the grace of
[54:32] God that I I'm so happy I almost don't
[54:35] know what to do I I I actually feel like
[54:38] shouting right
[54:39] now those tears were not tears of sorrow
[54:42] but tears of
[54:45] joy that's what the prophet of God said
[54:48] he said when John saw the
[54:50] lamb he he didn't cry because he knew he
[54:53] wasn't unworthy
[54:57] he knew he wasn't
[54:59] worthy but when he saw Jesus who was
[55:03] worthy he said it was tears of
[55:06] joy and when I when I receiv received of
[55:09] the
[55:10] message any good thing the Bible said
[55:13] hold fast to that which is
[55:18] good so when I see in the
[55:21] word how God has given me a way of
[55:24] Escape
[55:28] from the Satan's
[55:30] traps I just get I just get
[55:33] excited the beauty of the whole thing
[55:37] is we know what the end
[55:42] results amen I read that
[55:46] scripture about Jesus being the
[55:49] beginning of the creation of
[55:51] God and I want to see you you you to see
[55:54] where you were
[55:57] at that time like I said it's in a
[56:00] reality it's not it's not fictitious
[56:03] it's not it's not something made up it's
[56:08] real sometime thing can be so
[56:12] exciting you have to pinch yourself is
[56:14] this
[56:16] real and and and that's the way I feel
[56:18] this morning it is so
[56:23] realen brother Adam says back in the
[56:29] making you begin with the germ of
[56:35] life when you become gerti in your great
[56:43] grandfather he said that's
[56:46] scripture Levi paid
[56:48] tithes in The Lord of
[56:52] Abraham his
[56:53] grandfather see
[56:56] all right but your
[56:58] jourm your life your
[57:02] soul began in the creation of
[57:06] God in the
[57:08] beginning didn't Jesus tell his
[57:12] disciples I knew you before the
[57:15] foundation of the
[57:18] world called
[57:20] us ordained us to be Ministers of the
[57:25] Gospel and so
[57:28] for it's the ordination of
[57:31] God all right then I'm going to go to
[57:33] another quote he said God is the
[57:38] Creator and how was he ever
[57:42] created but this is the beginning of the
[57:45] creation of
[57:47] God when God the spirit was
[57:51] created in a form of a man
[57:56] understand that that was God being
[58:02] created God the Creator
[58:05] himself becoming a
[58:08] creation hallu God who made the
[58:13] dirt made the
[58:15] calcium made
[58:17] the cosmic light
[58:22] petroleum took the thing together
[58:26] created
[58:28] himself in the
[58:30] beginning of
[58:32] creation amen am the final
[58:36] amen means to be so be it the final
[58:42] God when God
[58:45] completed in his
[58:48] creation y understand me Hallelujah and
[58:52] in that creation I read the quote you
[58:55] were
[58:57] hallelujah hallelujah I love this
[59:00] because I was in the gene of God you
[59:04] were in the gene of God I know you've
[59:06] heard this thing I know you've heard
[59:09] this
[59:10] before Hallelujah but even when
[59:14] Jesus was being
[59:17] described as MDC or in the order of
[59:22] mzc the Bible said that everything is
[59:26] being held in
[59:28] place by the power of His endless
[59:33] life Hallelujah is that all right so
[59:37] when we think
[59:39] about all of the
[59:42] prees all of the things that
[59:47] Satan is
[59:50] planning uh uh to come against the
[59:53] bride God given us a place of
[59:59] rest hallelujah hallelujah let me let me
[1:00:01] read this and know there
[1:00:05] not
[1:00:08] 65 you started back there as a
[1:00:13] seed and work down to where you are
[1:00:17] now and then you were all in
[1:00:21] Christ and when Christ died he died to
[1:00:26] redeem all of
[1:00:28] you and you and you are part of this
[1:00:32] word and he said and how can the Bible
[1:00:36] all of it precept upon precept line upon
[1:00:41] line here little there little not one
[1:00:46] jot or k shall
[1:00:48] fail Hallelujah and if you can believe
[1:00:52] it you can receive it hallelujah
[1:00:56] hallelujah is that all right also in
[1:01:01] Corinthians let me read it the fourth
[1:01:04] verse for though he was
[1:01:09] crucified 134
[1:01:13] and5 and though he was
[1:01:15] crucified through
[1:01:18] weakness yet he
[1:01:20] liveth by the power of
[1:01:23] God for we also are weak in
[1:01:28] him but we shall live with
[1:01:31] him by the power of God toward you
[1:01:36] Hallelujah so even though I might be
[1:01:40] weak I will
[1:01:42] live because Christ lives in me Christ
[1:01:46] lives in you hallelujah hallelujah now
[1:01:49] the fifth verse says examine yourself
[1:01:53] where whether you be in the faith
[1:01:57] prove your own
[1:01:59] self know ye not your own
[1:02:02] selves how that Jesus
[1:02:05] Christ is in
[1:02:07] you except you be
[1:02:10] reprobate now of us who don't know what
[1:02:14] the word reprobate
[1:02:16] means it means that which is
[1:02:20] rejected on the account of his own
[1:02:23] worthy uh worthlessness
[1:02:29] okay it also
[1:02:31] means this word is also
[1:02:35] used with
[1:02:37] reference reference to a
[1:02:40] person Cast Away or
[1:02:44] rejected because they have
[1:02:46] failed to make use of the up
[1:02:49] Hallelujah to make use of the
[1:02:53] opportunities offered to them
[1:02:56] you understand at some point like
[1:03:00] brother said if we're not careful we
[1:03:03] will cross the line and when you cross
[1:03:06] the line you become a
[1:03:09] reprobate hallelujah hallelujah I'm
[1:03:12] excited I'm really enjoying this this
[1:03:15] life of the
[1:03:17] word
[1:03:18] hallelujah Isaiah 55
[1:03:22] And1 love the Lord
[1:03:30] well I tell you like this you say it
[1:03:32] ain't deep
[1:03:34] enough but let me say it like this what
[1:03:37] deepness is going to do to
[1:03:39] you for
[1:03:42] you if you miss this great
[1:03:47] opportunity Paul said you can understand
[1:03:49] all
[1:03:52] my hallelujah hallelujah and you still
[1:03:54] can't love your brother
[1:03:57] it profits you
[1:03:59] nothing hallelujah hallelujah God don't
[1:04:03] care about how long you've been in the
[1:04:06] message but
[1:04:08] concern on how your
[1:04:12] welfare are you
[1:04:14] growing are you reing the
[1:04:18] word that has come to perfect
[1:04:21] you hallelujah hallelujah you love the
[1:04:24] Lord Isaiah 55
[1:04:27] and so shall my word
[1:04:30] be that go forth out of my
[1:04:33] mouth I shall not it shall not return
[1:04:37] unto me
[1:04:40] void but it shall accomplish that which
[1:04:44] I
[1:04:45] please and it shall
[1:04:47] prosper in the things where two I sent
[1:04:51] it Hallelujah so this message
[1:04:55] word will make you
[1:04:58] prosper you don't have to prosper on
[1:05:00] your own it will make you
[1:05:03] prosper Hallelujah now we we have our
[1:05:07] thoughts you're going to always have
[1:05:09] that time with your
[1:05:11] flesh if you're a true
[1:05:14] Christian if you're a true Christian
[1:05:17] you're going to have to confess every
[1:05:19] day Hallelujah you're in a battle every
[1:05:23] day Hallelujah but don't get
[1:05:27] confused with the battle the battle
[1:05:30] doesn't
[1:05:31] determine who you are hallelujah
[1:05:34] hallelujah what determines who you are
[1:05:38] if you can believe that the battle is
[1:05:40] the
[1:05:40] Lord hallelujah and you have you will
[1:05:43] win the
[1:05:44] battle no matter how no matter how
[1:05:48] intense the battle
[1:05:50] become
[1:05:51] [Music]
[1:05:52] Hallelujah God has already determined
[1:05:56] you are the
[1:05:57] winner Hallelujah is that right cuz I
[1:06:01] was saying last week can you only
[1:06:04] imagine what heaven is going to be
[1:06:07] like Hallelujah when all of this is
[1:06:13] over I was thinking the other day on how
[1:06:19] beautiful heav must
[1:06:22] be my wife and I heard a strange thing
[1:06:26] this
[1:06:27] morning here is
[1:06:29] January this is the month of
[1:06:32] January and there were birds singing in
[1:06:35] my
[1:06:38] tree somehow they they're
[1:06:41] confused something's going
[1:06:44] on if the birds are
[1:06:47] returning in
[1:06:51] January something's
[1:06:54] off amen
[1:06:56] you is that right brother tells us to
[1:06:58] watch
[1:07:00] nature Hallelujah and this is not the
[1:07:04] season something's coming something's
[1:07:06] coming and it's coming early whatever it
[1:07:11] is it's coming
[1:07:15] Hallelujah to God you know when birds
[1:07:19] come that's a true
[1:07:21] sign that Easter is about
[1:07:24] here life
[1:07:29] they they only return back
[1:07:31] here to lay
[1:07:33] eggs they egg in the winter oh my God I
[1:07:38] don't know what it is but I'm going to
[1:07:40] keep
[1:07:42] watching Hallelujah but I was thinking
[1:07:45] the other day there is not one
[1:07:49] city here on Earth that I have
[1:07:53] seen that would make me
[1:07:56] think about
[1:08:00] heaven it doesn't matter how big and
[1:08:04] Grandeur the buildings
[1:08:07] are it does not make me
[1:08:11] feel like I'm in heaven you understand
[1:08:15] me and it doesn't matter how Satan tries
[1:08:20] to mimic what's in
[1:08:22] heaven he can't do it is that right even
[1:08:27] brother Bram said that Babylon the old
[1:08:31] Babylon had the Hanging
[1:08:34] Gardens had the Hanging
[1:08:37] Gardens like the true
[1:08:39] City Hallelujah but in all that he tried
[1:08:43] to
[1:08:44] do where is it
[1:08:47] now but our city is an everlasting City
[1:08:53] Hallelujah there be no death
[1:08:56] there there be no pest there Hallelujah

[1:28:11] it when when people don't like you when
[1:28:14] people come against you why do you get
[1:28:17] upset God is with

[1:28:51] Council of churches if we in that and
[1:28:54] they start squeezing on us don't worry
[1:28:57] about it because once they clamp or once
[1:29:00] they come to that we're going
[1:29:03] up we're going up Hallelujah that's
[1:29:07] right that's why the Bible says when you

[1:29:37] that Hallelujah but we don't believe as
[1:29:41] creatures with big old eyes and strange
[1:29:44] looking
[1:29:46] heads our Prophet told
[1:29:49] us that they were investigating
[1:29:53] angels said one day it's going to pick
[1:29:56] you
[1:29:58] up I'm not afraid of it I don't know how
[1:30:01] they going to do it but I'm waiting for
[1:30:04] the
[1:30:05] trip Hallelujah glory to God you love
[1:30:09] the Lord people think we're crazy well
[1:30:12] why why in this
[1:30:14] day UFOs unidentified
[1:30:18] objects
[1:30:20] everywhere some might be scientific
[1:30:25] That's what Satan will do he
[1:30:28] scientifically blind the
[1:30:30] people Hallelujah to the real
[1:30:33] reality you got to understand that it's
[1:30:37] got to be
[1:30:38] real or Satan wouldn't have had nothing
[1:30:40] to
[1:30:43] copy it has to be real or Satan would
[1:30:47] have had nothing to
[1:30:49] copy glory to God they've seen
[1:30:52] things yes sir they can't explain it but
[1:30:55] they want to make it
[1:30:56] happen come on
[1:30:58] somebody if if we didn't have a prophet
[1:31:03] who told us about
[1:31:05] Dimensions perhaps they would even know
[1:31:07] about
[1:31:09] Dimensions Hallelujah but we know that
[1:31:12] this world is not the only
[1:31:15] Dimension there other dimensions Where
[1:31:17] Angels are
[1:31:19] living where the redeem are living
[1:31:22] Hallelujah there's a better world behind
[1:31:24] the
[1:31:24] Cur I
[1:31:26] believe hallelujah hallelujah glory to

[1:31:33] Lord Hebrews 8 12-13 don't mind
[1:31:38] me Hallelujah I'm having a good time I
[1:31:41] trust that you being blessed this
[1:31:43] morning stop the devil from make listen
[1:31:46] when Satan makes you
[1:31:48] sad he can give you
[1:31:50] ulcers high blood pressure make you have
[1:31:53] a attack it can make you have a stroke
[1:31:57] because worry is not an attribute of
[1:32:01] God hallelujah but I learned something
[1:32:05] remember I told you about my flowers how
[1:32:07] beautiful they were not my
[1:32:10] flowers my wife's
[1:32:13] flowers but then after a while I know I
[1:32:17] don't know how long they supposed to
[1:32:19] last but then they started drooping
[1:32:25] and I
[1:32:26] wondered because I'm G tell you
[1:32:28] something it is a scientific
[1:32:32] fact you talk and speak happy things to
[1:32:35] your
[1:32:38] flowers they will
[1:32:40] last much longer but if the atmosphere
[1:32:44] is not
[1:32:46] right that's right your flowers going to
[1:32:48] tell you how sad they are it is the

[1:52:48] before me he comes before my wife he
[1:52:52] comes before my children and he com
[1:52:54] before my

[1:53:02] hallelujah thank you
[1:53:04] Lord yeah you didn't see me but I was
[1:53:11] shouting he yeah he was doing it yeah
[1:53:14] the Book of Ruth
[1:53:16] listen just just just just to uh give
[1:53:20] you a thought
[1:53:22] The Book of Ruth is definitely a book of
[1:53:24] redemption we know
[1:53:28] that first of all you know Ruth had to
[1:53:31] make that decision I'm going I'm going
[1:53:34] with
[1:53:36] Naomi just like you had to make a
[1:53:39] decision I'm going with
[1:53:42] Christ right after making that
[1:53:45] decision Ruth had to
[1:53:48] serve and brother Bram liking that as
[1:53:51] working your working working out your
[1:53:53] own
[1:53:54] [Music]
[1:53:59] salvation but he said we got into
[1:54:03] legalism and that's what we did that's
[1:54:05] why I'm trying trying to pull y'all out
[1:54:07] of
[1:54:10] legalism legalism will always cause you
[1:54:13] to judge other people
[1:54:16] wrong Hallelujah you out there working
[1:54:18] you out there working
[1:54:20] now Hallelujah but but then after
[1:54:23] that she was introduced to
[1:54:27] Boaz and y'all know the whole story Boaz
[1:54:31] told her you know work in the field and
[1:54:33] all
[1:54:33] that Hallelujah but then there's a time
[1:54:36] that that that Boaz she had to come and
[1:54:41] wait right and see this is what where
[1:54:43] you fail to see after all of her
[1:54:46] working she didn't have to work no
[1:54:49] more Boaz did all the work
[1:54:53] he went up and fixed up Naomi's
[1:54:56] house just like Jesus say I'm going to
[1:54:59] prepare a place for you that where I am
[1:55:01] there you'll be
[1:55:03] also right it was Boaz who took off his
[1:55:08] shoe and and declared that uh Ruth was
[1:55:12] his
[1:55:15] wife right he bought
[1:55:17] her he paid the
[1:55:19] price right so what I'm trying to say is
[1:55:22] you you have no price to
[1:55:24] pay the price is already
[1:55:28] paid Hallelujah but what Ruth was to do
[1:55:33] she was to
[1:55:34] rest on the Promises of
[1:55:37] Boaz he said you rest here and I'll come
[1:55:41] back make this thing happen did he make
[1:55:44] it
[1:55:45] happen Hallelujah this is how we rest we
[1:55:49] rest in the Holy Ghost you got theol go
[1:55:53] you need to just
[1:55:54] rest stop worrying about whether I'm
[1:55:57] going to make it cuz you already done
[1:55:58] made
[1:56:00] it and maybe maybe you're not to that
[1:56:04] Perfection
[1:56:05] yet but God promis you that he'll
[1:56:07] complete the work in
[1:56:09] you it ain't you it's
[1:56:12] him right so you got to move on with God
[1:56:15] like
[1:56:17] like Hallelujah did they get married
[1:56:21] they got married
[1:56:23] on his promises she didn't have to do
[1:56:26] nothing but rest on the
[1:56:29] promise this is what he said the
[1:56:31] Ultimate
[1:56:32] Reality of this message if you have the
[1:56:35] Holy Ghost you should be at rest
[1:56:39] Hallelujah if you don't have the Holy
[1:56:41] Ghost you need to get the Holy Ghost
[1:56:44] that's the only way you're going to be
[1:56:46] at rest Hallelujah it is the only he he
[1:56:50] himself in you
[1:56:52] will make it all
[1:56:55] happen Hallelujah brother bam said it in
[1:56:58] Revelation chapter 5 part two he
[1:57:02] says paragraph 125 he said do I have to
[1:57:06] be a
[1:57:06] Methodist do I have to join the Baptist
[1:57:10] do I have to be a
[1:57:11] presbyterian he said no
[1:57:14] sir just get the Holy
[1:57:17] Ghost and rest
[1:57:22] we we we we look at all of these
[1:57:25] things and we we we doing just what Paul
[1:57:28] said told us not to
[1:57:30] do with all of the gifts and everything
[1:57:33] else and all the the the supernatural we
[1:57:36] done all perhaps have Supernatural
[1:57:38] things of
[1:57:40] God but that is not
[1:57:43] salvation Salvation is when Jesus accept
[1:57:46] you and gives you the Holy
[1:57:49] Ghost hallelujah look at the of
[1:57:53] Israelites that saw that saw the mirac
[1:57:56] happen and look how many went into the
[1:57:59] promis I don't know about you maybe
[1:58:01] you're not selfish I'm selfish I'm
[1:58:04] selfish when it comes to my
[1:58:07] soul I'm
[1:58:10] selfish I only get this one
[1:58:13] chance you say well it's really not a
[1:58:15] chance well Paul said it Paul said I
[1:58:18] have to be
[1:58:19] careful Les I become a Cast Away
[1:58:24] hallelujah oh I'm secure and I'm going
[1:58:26] hold my
[1:58:28] faith I'm
[1:58:30] secure and no matter how many times I've
[1:58:34] fallen he always picks me
[1:58:39] up let's stand

[1:59:36] it it is a reality in my life that's how
[1:59:40] love binds
[1:59:42] you and when it comes
