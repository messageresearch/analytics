[49:21] you so first the Holy Ghost comes upon
[49:24] you and then you receive power
[49:29] and then that makes you a witness
[49:30] because he says and ye shall be
[49:32] Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and
[49:35] in all
[49:38] Judea and onto the uttermost part of the
[49:42] earth so that means even Iowa you can be
[49:45] a witness of the
[49:47] Gospel all right let's uh read uh John
[49:51] chapter 4
[49:56] uh John chapter 4 let's start at the
[50:00] 25th
[50:06] verse the woman said unto him I know
[50:09] that Messiah cometh which is called
[50:11] Christ when he is come he will tell us
[50:13] all
[50:23] things and Jesus said unto her I that
[50:26] speak unto thee am
[50:31] he verse 27 and upon this upon this came
[50:35] his disciples and Marvel that he talked
[50:37] with a woman yet no man said what
[50:40] seekest thou or why talkest thou with
[50:55] her the woman then left her water pot
[50:58] and went her way into the City and said
[51:00] to the man come see a man which told me
[51:03] all things that ever I did is not this
[51:06] to
[51:16] Christ so this woman was also a witness
[51:18] that God keeps his
[51:21] word and when she realized that God kept
[51:24] his word she went to witness to testify
[51:30] and verse 30 says then they went out of
[51:34] the city and came unto
[51:39] him um May the Lord add the blessing to
[51:41] reading of his word let's bow our head
[51:43] real

[52:53] Lord and father the Bible says that this
[52:55] the letter kill us but the spirit gives
[52:59] life Heavenly Father Lord we can't read
[53:02] this just uh just because we know how to

[53:18] Lord
[53:19] Jesus father Lord because I myself I'm
[53:22] not a preacher I don't know how to
[53:24] preach but I trust you to be the great
[53:25] preacher Lord
[53:30] and I I pray that you hear through the
[53:31] congregation Lord
[53:33] Jesus and that this sermon may be a
[53:35] blessing to them Lord
[53:37] Jesus bless your word and I commit the
[53:40] service to you and may you take every
[53:42] Spirit under your control in the name of
[53:44] Jesus Christ we
[53:46] pray amen amen you may have your
[53:50] seats and I'll continue reading this uh
[53:54] verse I'll skip to verse
[53:59] 39 and he says and many of the
[54:01] Samaritans of that City believed on him
[54:03] for the saying of the
[54:10] woman which testified he told me all
[54:13] that ever I
[54:15] did so an entire city believed on a
[54:18] testimony of a
[54:23] woman and verse 40 so when the samarit
[54:27] were come unto him they they besought
[54:29] him that he would ter with them and he
[54:32] there two
[54:39] days and many more believed because of
[54:42] his of his own
[54:47] word and said unto the woman now we
[54:50] believe not because of thy saying for we
[54:53] have heard him ourselves and know that
[54:56] this is indeed the Christ the savior of
[54:58] the
[55:07] world uh the title of this of the topic
[55:10] this morning is going to be um witnesses
[55:13] that God keeps his
[55:19] word being witnesses that God is always
[55:22] faithful to his word
[55:27] because many people questions if many
[55:31] people even question if God is
[55:35] real even in this church right now there
[55:37] could be someone you prayed for
[55:39] something and you wondered if God is
[55:40] even real if he answer your
[55:44] prayer and I'm here to encourage you
[55:46] this
[55:47] morning to reassure you that God keeps
[55:50] his
[55:51] word you know and I don't even know if
[55:55] this is going to be preaching or me just
[55:57] talking to
[55:59] you and throughout the topic I'll be
[56:01] giving a few
[56:05] testimonies so we read the book of I
[56:07] preached this sermon by the way last
[56:08] Sunday in Iowa
[56:10] City and I thought it it would be a
[56:13] blessing if I preach
[56:18] it and so in the book of Acts we read
[56:21] that Jesus want us to be Witnesses
[56:26] Witnesses of what w Witnesses of the
[56:30] Resurrection what is the purpose of the
[56:32] res Resurrection is to show us that God
[56:34] is still
[56:38] alive it's to show us that that the same
[56:41] God who made himself
[56:44] flesh and died on the cross he did not
[56:48] just stay on the
[56:49] cross but he rose
[56:51] again you know and everything that God
[56:54] does there's always a purpose behind it
[56:59] you know I wonder why did God have
[57:01] needed Witnesses because
[57:04] he he could have just Rose and just let
[57:07] continue he with with his
[57:11] purpose but he told the disciples that
[57:13] he wanted them to be
[57:16] Witnesses because in every age the
[57:19] spirit of the enemy will always try to
[57:21] discredit the word of God
[57:27] Even in our generation even today there
[57:30] there's this one group of people that
[57:31] try to discredit the message of
[57:35] the they try to to to show all sort of
[57:38] proofs to to discredit the work of
[57:42] God and remember the prophet said that
[57:44] Spirits don't
[57:47] die that same spirit it's not a new
[57:49] spirit because I saw that in the
[57:52] Bible when Jesus rose from the dead
[57:57] there were two people that were watching
[57:58] over the body of Jesus in the in the
[58:02] grave and when the angel of the Lord
[58:04] came down those two people were
[58:06] Witnesses of
[58:09] it and they knew that Jesus they knew
[58:12] that Jesus rose from the dead he wasn't
[58:14] in a grave no
[58:16] more and they knew that they weren't
[58:18] sleeping the whole time they heard they
[58:20] had their eyes open so they took the
[58:22] body of
[58:26] but when they went to the high priest
[58:28] the high priest told them to make to to
[58:30] come up with a
[58:33] lie to
[58:35] discredit to discredit the word of
[58:38] God the high priest told them to say
[58:41] that uh uh that the disciples came and
[58:43] stole the body of Jesus
[58:47] Christ you know Satan is never going
[58:50] after what's what's what's fake he
[58:52] always goes after what's real
[58:56] and and the prophet says that to this
[58:59] day people still believe the
[59:03] lie it's in the message
[59:06] Paradox the prophet says that they still
[59:08] believe that and he says but we believe
[59:12] and know by his living presence now that
[59:14] he raised from the dead and is here with
[59:16] us
[59:20] now I repeat that again but we believe
[59:23] and know by his living presence now that
[59:25] he raised up from the dead and he's here
[59:27] with us
[59:31] now but my question to you is do you
[59:34] believe
[59:36] that and I'm not talking about
[59:38] sympathizing because because I say that
[59:40] God is real because brother Brook says
[59:42] that God is
[59:47] real because the Bible says that he rose
[59:50] from the dead because brother Bram says
[59:52] that God is
[59:54] real but how how do you know that God is
[59:57] real how do you know that God rose from
[1:00:00] the
[1:00:01] dead because you you you have to be
[1:00:05] Witnesses and and and the definition of
[1:00:07] a witness according to the to the US
[1:00:11] Department of
[1:00:13] Justice it says that a witness is a
[1:00:15] person who saw or heard the crime take
[1:00:17] place or may have important information
[1:00:20] about the crime or the defendant
[1:00:24] [Music]
[1:00:36] both the defense and the prosecutor can
[1:00:38] call witnesses to testify and tell what
[1:00:40] they know about the
[1:00:44] situation and brother Bram also uses the
[1:00:47] same definition in the message
[1:00:52] Witnesses he says that in order to be a
[1:00:54] witness you have to do two things you
[1:00:56] have to either um um hear about the
[1:00:59] matter or you have you ought to see
[1:01:04] that so in other words you have to have
[1:01:07] a personal experience you cannot
[1:01:10] just you can't just come and tell me
[1:01:13] that uh even if you go to the court
[1:01:15] system you cannot be a witness based on
[1:01:17] what other people are
[1:01:22] saying you cannot say that this message
[1:01:24] is real based on what I preached
[1:01:29] it has to be a personal
[1:01:31] experience because that's how you
[1:01:33] overcome the
[1:01:36] devil being a witness that's my topic
[1:01:38] for
[1:01:39] today God wants us to be
[1:01:41] witness Even in our in our community God
[1:01:45] wants us to be
[1:01:46] with because the only way the world will
[1:01:49] see Jesus is through
[1:01:52] you that's why Jesus says that the works
[1:01:55] that I do you shall do Greater
[1:01:59] Works because the the prophet says that
[1:02:02] in the in the New Testament Jesus he was
[1:02:04] just one man doing all the
[1:02:08] works but now through the Holy Ghost he
[1:02:11] he he he he he poured himself onto
[1:02:13] multiple
[1:02:15] people being a witnesses that God is
[1:02:19] real even in your schools young
[1:02:22] people and I'm going to talk
[1:02:24] specifically to the sisters
[1:02:28] like the sisters going like in in in
[1:02:30] American schools here wearing skirts
[1:02:32] every day to school is a
[1:02:39] witness because when you dress you never
[1:02:42] put makeups you always wear skirts and
[1:02:47] dresses those people will will ask
[1:02:50] themselves questions why are you always
[1:02:51] that
[1:02:54] way and I'm here to tell tell you to not
[1:02:56] be ashamed of
[1:02:57] it I'm here to tell you that that that
[1:03:00] that if you are ashamed of God here he's
[1:03:02] going to be ashamed of you on the
[1:03:05] other you need you need to you need to
[1:03:07] to take a stand for the word of
[1:03:10] God that's why I have a lot of respect
[1:03:12] for sisters when they always dress
[1:03:19] modest because I like I said I'll be
[1:03:21] giving a lot of testimonies throughout
[1:03:22] my
[1:03:24] sermon I personally went when I came to
[1:03:26] the US I I I back seed I wasn't a
[1:03:28] Christian
[1:03:31] anymore and I remember when my sisters
[1:03:34] came from the Congo they came to the
[1:03:40] US and I remember we went somewhere I
[1:03:43] think it was at the immigration place
[1:03:44] and we took a family
[1:03:50] picture and I told them um okay you guys
[1:03:54] can post this picture but don't tag me
[1:03:56] in this
[1:04:03] picture because I was embarrassed of
[1:04:05] having sisters that were
[1:04:10] dress I thought that it was
[1:04:16] ugly you know and and and I know there
[1:04:18] are some young people even you leave the
[1:04:21] house with a skirt but when you go to
[1:04:22] school you change you wear your pants
[1:04:28] you that's why I I always tell parents
[1:04:31] you need to always pray for your your
[1:04:34] children because you are not always with
[1:04:36] them everywhere they
[1:04:38] are when I came to the US my parents
[1:04:41] weren't with me I was
[1:04:42] alone I was alone in high
[1:04:45] school I could do whatever I wanted
[1:04:48] to that's why you need to pray for
[1:04:51] them because you you can you cannot
[1:04:54] control them everywhere they are
[1:04:56] but I know one person who sees
[1:04:58] everything is
[1:05:00] God so if you put it back in the hands
[1:05:02] of God he's going to take care
[1:05:05] of Amen going back to the woman at the
[1:05:10] well she was a woman you know and but
[1:05:14] she she went to convert an entire
[1:05:18] city so sisters you may not be able to
[1:05:21] preach at the pulpit but you can still
[1:05:22] be a witness
[1:05:28] because the prophet said I'll rather
[1:05:29] have a man that leaves me his sermon
[1:05:31] than preach me a
[1:05:33] sermon so a better a better preacher is
[1:05:36] someone who leaves what he
[1:05:39] [Music]
[1:05:42] preaches and PR and preacher can be the
[1:05:44] way you
[1:05:46] leave the way you carry yourself with
[1:05:48] your husband at
[1:05:51] home the way you carry yourself in the
[1:05:53] workplace
[1:05:56] you don't compromise for the word of
[1:06:00] God in this leodan church age God is
[1:06:03] looking for
[1:06:05] Witnesses this is a an age where there's
[1:06:08] a lot of evil evil in in the
[1:06:13] land and the prophet says that God has
[1:06:16] always kept himself with a
[1:06:20] witness in every generation God has
[1:06:23] always had a witness
[1:06:26] my question to you I challenge you to be
[1:06:27] that witness this
[1:06:30] morning when God speaks to you don't try
[1:06:32] to to point to other people but let it
[1:06:34] be to yourself Lord I Want To Be A
[1:06:38] Witness and this morning God wants to
[1:06:41] remind you that he's faithful to his
[1:06:45] word God wants to remind you that you
[1:06:47] can bring all your burdens and all your
[1:06:49] cares to him and he's going to take care
[1:06:54] of Amen
[1:06:58] amen and talking about the
[1:07:01] woman there was a woman um uh in the
[1:07:04] prophet talks about this one woman she
[1:07:06] was alcoholic I mean she had a husband
[1:07:08] that was
[1:07:13] alcoholic I think some of you remember
[1:07:15] that
[1:07:17] story and there was a challenge the
[1:07:20] prophet says that people were asking
[1:07:21] they were saying that there in this day
[1:07:23] and age we there there's no more
[1:07:24] Christians that
[1:07:28] and I hear that the Lord even even other
[1:07:30] sisters sometime they get so discouraged
[1:07:32] by seeing
[1:07:33] how what message Brothers call
[1:07:35] themselves
[1:07:39] [Music]
[1:07:41] brothers and they start questioning they
[1:07:43] say that I already some even say I
[1:07:45] rather marri someone outside the
[1:07:51] message and remember remember the
[1:07:53] prophet says that Satan will always
[1:07:54] point you to what's what's false but
[1:07:56] it's never going to point you to the
[1:07:58] real
[1:08:02] one there are some people out there in
[1:08:04] the world they just see you claiming to
[1:08:06] be a message believer but you behave
[1:08:07] just like
[1:08:11] them so how are they going to come to
[1:08:14] come to the message if they see that
[1:08:15] there's no difference with your life and
[1:08:17] their
[1:08:19] life they do the same thing that you
[1:08:22] do you guys get together and you drink
[1:08:24] together
[1:08:27] and yet you want a witness to that
[1:08:28] person to come to your
[1:08:32] church when even being a Salesman when
[1:08:35] you're trying to sell something to
[1:08:36] someone you got to show to the person
[1:08:38] that whatever I have is is something
[1:08:40] that you don't
[1:08:53] care the only way that even even around
[1:08:56] your friends you can only influence them
[1:08:58] if you have something that they don't
[1:09:04] have amen and God is calling you to be
[1:09:08] Witnesses so that woman she um so the
[1:09:11] the husband says that when when all his
[1:09:13] friends were saying that they we don't
[1:09:15] have any Christians in the
[1:09:18] world said but I know
[1:09:21] one I know one person who is a Christian
[1:09:25] and he said it's my
[1:09:27] wife and they decided to go test to see
[1:09:31] if she was a real
[1:09:34] Christian and every true every true
[1:09:37] witness will always be
[1:09:40] tested it's not enough to just say I'm a
[1:09:43] Christian with your mouth but you got to
[1:09:44] do that with your
[1:09:47] life it's not enough to say I'm a
[1:09:50] message believer but you got to prove it
[1:09:52] with your life
[1:09:57] so they went back
[1:09:58] home and uh they pretended to be
[1:10:05] drunk and uh when they came home they
[1:10:08] asked the wife he asked his wife to make
[1:10:10] food for
[1:10:13] him and the prophet says that they were
[1:10:15] just acting like drunk drunk people they
[1:10:17] were stering and all
[1:10:20] that and then the wife still kept her
[1:10:22] sweet nature
[1:10:27] and she went to make food for for her
[1:10:29] husband and her drunk friend and his
[1:10:32] drun
[1:10:34] friend you know so sisters it doesn't
[1:10:36] matter how your
[1:10:38] husband how bad your husband is you
[1:10:40] still have to be a
[1:10:44] [Music]
[1:10:46] wife even if your husband is not even if
[1:10:49] your husband is not a message believer
[1:10:51] you still need to be a wife
[1:10:57] because the prophet says that that woman
[1:10:59] she At first she was she was converted
[1:11:01] and after she was converted then her
[1:11:03] husband was not converted
[1:11:10] yet and when they brought the the food
[1:11:13] and then he took the food and just like
[1:11:15] threw it on the floor and he started
[1:11:20] complaining the prophet says that the
[1:11:22] wife still kep kept sweet and she said
[1:11:24] I'm sorry my husband that I didn't know
[1:11:27] you wanted the food to be prepared a
[1:11:28] certain
[1:11:33] way she said I'll go make I'll go make
[1:11:35] something
[1:11:37] else but the husband kept ridiculing the
[1:11:39] wife in front of his
[1:11:42] friends and when they were doing all
[1:11:45] that the woman started singing must
[1:11:46] Jesus carry his cross
[1:11:52] alone and then the the prophet said that
[1:11:55] one of the friends said that she's a
[1:11:57] real
[1:12:00] Christian and then the prophet says that
[1:12:03] him the husband and all his friends gave
[1:12:05] their heart to God
[1:12:09] that Jesus is the same yesterday today
[1:12:12] and
[1:12:13] forever he also want us to be
[1:12:16] Witnesses you know in this church other
[1:12:18] people need to see the don't just
[1:12:20] complain that there's no fire in the
[1:12:22] church but let the fire be you
[1:12:30] the prophet says that God will always
[1:12:31] have a
[1:12:34] witness in this church God is looking
[1:12:36] for
[1:12:38] Witnesses people are acting as if God
[1:12:40] doesn't as as if God doesn't keep his
[1:12:44] word that's why sometimes you see people
[1:12:46] they don't they don't come to church on
[1:12:48] a Sunday
[1:12:49] morning because they have other problems
[1:12:51] to take care
[1:12:53] of but they forget that God the promise
[1:12:55] that if you put me
[1:12:58] first everything else will be given to
[1:13:01] you but the problem is that we we doubt
[1:13:04] the word of
[1:13:06] God and the problem is because we've not
[1:13:08] had a personal experience with
[1:13:12] him once you have a personal experience
[1:13:15] with with God you know that if God did
[1:13:16] this for me he can do this
[1:13:21] again David had a personal experience
[1:13:24] experience
[1:13:25] he killed the the the the wild
[1:13:28] animals and when he came in in in front
[1:13:31] of another another challenge that came
[1:13:33] in front of
[1:13:35] him this time it wasn't an animal
[1:13:38] anymore but it was a a
[1:13:41] giant a giant that stood in his
[1:13:44] way but David knew that if God could
[1:13:46] deliver me from those animals he can
[1:13:48] deliver me from these
[1:13:53] giant the prophet says that if you
[1:13:55] cannot have faith for even a um a a
[1:13:58] toothache how are you going to have
[1:13:59] faith for the
[1:14:03] Rapture so those things are trainings to
[1:14:06] help us to know that if God can do this
[1:14:08] for that person he can also do this
[1:14:13] for and my sermon here is to make to
[1:14:16] challenge you to God wants to be
[1:14:20] try God the prophet says God likes to be
[1:14:23] challenged
[1:14:26] he likes for you to challenge his
[1:14:30] word because he wants to make himself
[1:14:32] known to
[1:14:34] you and this is a testimony like I said
[1:14:38] I have a lot of
[1:14:39] testimonies and um so that was a few
[1:14:43] years ago in Iowa
[1:14:45] City it came a time where I also wanted
[1:14:48] to know if God was real or
[1:14:51] not I was just going to church just for
[1:14:53] the sake of going to church
[1:14:56] I was seeing people getting in the
[1:14:57] spirit and I started
[1:15:00] question and I was like what makes me
[1:15:02] believe that they're not just making it
[1:15:07] up I was like I'm not them they could
[1:15:10] just be making
[1:15:13] this how do I know that this whole
[1:15:16] message thing I've not been put into
[1:15:18] like some sort of uh
[1:15:23] lie maybe because I was just born in it
[1:15:26] and I just think it's
[1:15:29] right so that that Friday night I told
[1:15:31] God that I was like God I want you to
[1:15:33] make yourself known to
[1:15:37] me I told God that I've always seen
[1:15:40] people get in the space but I don't know
[1:15:41] if it's true or
[1:15:44] not I told him I wanted to experience
[1:15:46] that
[1:15:48] myself remember the Bible says you have
[1:15:50] not because you ask
[1:15:52] not so when you you fall short of things
[1:15:54] don't blame God blame
[1:15:57] yourself because God because God already
[1:16:00] made his
[1:16:02] promise the job is for you to
[1:16:05] believe you know and then I prayed and
[1:16:08] and after I prayed we had a service that
[1:16:12] night and the the minister asked a
[1:16:15] called for the prayer
[1:16:18] line and a lot of people were going to
[1:16:20] the prayer I was playing the
[1:16:22] keyboard and I was hearing two I was
[1:16:24] hearing two voice voices in my
[1:16:26] head one was telling me to go to the
[1:16:28] prayer line and be pray
[1:16:31] for and the other one was telling me to
[1:16:34] just keep playing because if I stop
[1:16:35] playing then the service is going to be
[1:16:41] interrupted so this is also to your
[1:16:42] musicians you have to know what is
[1:16:46] important playing the instrument is not
[1:16:48] more important than your own
[1:16:50] soul the prophet even tells us that even
[1:16:53] in the church the music is not
[1:16:57] priority the song service is not a
[1:17:00] priority it's the word of God that comes
[1:17:03] first that is just there to set an
[1:17:05] atmosphere for the word of
[1:17:10] God so I decided to to hear the voice
[1:17:13] that told me to go to the prayer
[1:17:17] line and I was the last one in the
[1:17:19] prayer line no I was the second to
[1:17:23] last and everybody was getting prayed
[1:17:25] for and then he came to my
[1:17:27] turn and the minister asked me um he
[1:17:31] asked me what do you
[1:17:32] want and I told the minister I want the
[1:17:34] Holy
[1:17:37] Ghost and the minister was like okay
[1:17:39] raise your hand and and just start
[1:17:42] thanking
[1:17:43] God and tell him how much you love
[1:17:46] him and that's the key right there
[1:17:48] because you I started thanking God in
[1:17:53] advance because the Bible say says that
[1:17:55] when you ask anything to God you have to
[1:17:57] believe that you have already received
[1:18:01] that and then you will see that come to
[1:18:05] pass so don't twist the the order first
[1:18:09] you have to believe that it has already
[1:18:11] happened and and then you'll see that
[1:18:13] come to
[1:18:14] pass and by thanking God it create it
[1:18:16] just automatic automatically creates
[1:18:19] Faith
[1:18:21] you that's why the Bible says enter into
[1:18:24] his gate with Thanksgiving in your
[1:18:28] heart so I I had my hand my hand raised
[1:18:31] and I started I started thanking God and
[1:18:33] telling him how much I
[1:18:35] love you know so that's that's that's
[1:18:37] the key for anything you ask God In
[1:18:39] Prayer just I want to encourage you to
[1:18:41] already start thanking God for
[1:18:45] that because the prophet says that when
[1:18:48] you ask even when you pray for to be
[1:18:50] saved the prophet
[1:18:52] say start acting like you are
[1:18:57] start hanging out with people who are
[1:18:59] saved and eventually you will be
[1:19:02] saved so the prophet also used that same
[1:19:05] key to act in advance because it creates
[1:19:09] faith in you because the only way you
[1:19:12] can please God is to
[1:19:14] Faith even you you you are you are saved
[1:19:17] by faith you know anything you do with
[1:19:21] God it takes Faith to unlock the people
[1:19:25] so while I I was I was thanking
[1:19:28] God um I felt like I had an experience
[1:19:30] where I felt like it was it was
[1:19:33] a that started from here and it started
[1:19:36] going
[1:19:38] up and it's like it was a boiling
[1:19:41] water and by the time it came out of my
[1:19:45] mouth it was me uh getting in the
[1:19:49] spirit that was my first time ever
[1:19:51] getting in the
[1:19:52] spirit and remember that morning IID
[1:19:54] asked God that I wanted to know if
[1:19:55] getting in the spirit is real or
[1:20:00] not and then after that they went to
[1:20:02] pray for someone
[1:20:04] else and then the moment I I I just had
[1:20:07] a lot of people in my in my
[1:20:10] heart there's just something the prophet
[1:20:12] says that when someone is saved the
[1:20:14] first thing that he thinks about is the
[1:20:16] Salvation of other
[1:20:21] people we just saw that with the woman
[1:20:23] at the well
[1:20:26] after after she came to the realization
[1:20:27] that Jesus Christ was the Messiah
[1:20:30] she she was then concerned about
[1:20:33] others the prophet says that to know if
[1:20:36] someone truly has the holy ghost or
[1:20:38] not he refer the scripture that says
[1:20:41] that they cry and S for the
[1:20:49] Abomination so that that's what happened
[1:20:52] to me that
[1:20:53] day I started think thinking about my
[1:20:55] family and I started praying for all of
[1:20:57] them and I'm just save them too and the
[1:21:02] whole time I had my hand
[1:21:04] raised and then I got tired and I I I
[1:21:07] put my hands
[1:21:09] down and then I felt the hand of a human
[1:21:12] of a
[1:21:15] human he touched my left
[1:21:18] hand and he started slowly raising my
[1:21:20] left
[1:21:23] hand and when I went home I remember I
[1:21:25] told that to my friends and my
[1:21:28] brothers but they didn't believe that
[1:21:31] they just thought I was just making
[1:21:32] myself you know to have some sort of
[1:21:34] experience in the
[1:21:37] church you know they didn't believe that
[1:21:39] and I told them that okay let's go let's
[1:21:41] go watch the
[1:21:43] tape and we went to watch the
[1:21:45] video and on the so they were saying
[1:21:48] that there was a sister that was next
[1:21:50] that that was next to me
[1:21:52] maybe maybe she bumped into my head and
[1:21:54] I thought
[1:21:56] that and I thought all of a sudden it's
[1:21:59] like God some sort of
[1:22:01] experience so I told them let's go watch
[1:22:03] the
[1:22:04] tape so when we watch the
[1:22:06] tape we can see that my left hand
[1:22:09] started slowing and going up without
[1:22:11] anybody
[1:22:15] tou and I told people that it was
[1:22:17] someone
[1:22:19] who ra my hand I had an experience that
[1:22:23] day
[1:22:25] from that day nobody I knew that God was
[1:22:28] real I knew that God still fills with
[1:22:31] the Holy
[1:22:32] Ghost that was the night I received the
[1:22:34] Holy
[1:22:35] Ghost it didn't make me a perfect person
[1:22:38] all of a
[1:22:39] sudden I still had a lot of shortcomings
[1:22:43] afterward because the prophet says that
[1:22:45] that when you receive the Holy Ghost is
[1:22:47] just the beginning
[1:22:50] of when you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:22:52] that's when all the weapons of hell will
[1:22:54] be charged
[1:22:58] against but I'm here to tell you that
[1:23:00] don't be
[1:23:01] afraid because God says that no weapons
[1:23:04] form against you shall
[1:23:06] prosper the enemy May Point his weapons
[1:23:09] at
[1:23:11] you but God will be that barrier that
[1:23:13] protects you
[1:23:16] against so I had my own experience that
[1:23:18] God was
[1:23:21] real and then the prophet also says that
[1:23:23] to be a witness you can
[1:23:27] a weakness before the facts
[1:23:32] happen and the prophet gave the example
[1:23:34] of
[1:23:36] Noah he says that Noah before anything
[1:23:39] happened before there could come any
[1:23:40] rain Noah was a witness that that
[1:23:44] God the prophet says that Noah was a
[1:23:46] witness that there was an intelligence
[1:23:50] somewhere before the time of Noah the
[1:23:52] rain never came down
[1:23:55] but Noah still took God at his
[1:23:58] word you know he took God at his word
[1:24:00] and eventually God confirmed his
[1:24:03] word when you stand for God God is going
[1:24:06] to confirm his
[1:24:08] word remember that God does not does God
[1:24:11] doesn't come to confirm you but he comes
[1:24:13] to confirm his
[1:24:17] word because God the prophet says that
[1:24:19] God is obligated to his own word
[1:24:27] God is not obligated to you but God is
[1:24:29] God is a is not a man that he should
[1:24:32] lie if God makes a promise he has to
[1:24:35] bring that
[1:24:38] promise and the prophet says that many
[1:24:40] times we fall short of the promises of
[1:24:44] God the prophet says that we leave under
[1:24:46] our
[1:24:49] privileges it says that the Bible is
[1:24:51] full of treasures
[1:24:55] promises but we are living under those
[1:24:59] privileges Amen Let me just read this
[1:25:01] quote real
[1:25:10] quick all right I I'll go to the blind
[1:25:14] man who claimed his healing before
[1:25:19] so so the message is called I perceive
[1:25:21] that thou are a prophet
[1:25:27] remember what I mentioned earlier is
[1:25:30] that before you receive anything from
[1:25:32] God you have to start testifying that
[1:25:34] you already received
[1:25:37] that and I like every time I preach I
[1:25:40] like to back it up with an example from
[1:25:42] the
[1:25:45] prophet to show you that it's not my own
[1:25:49] words last time I preached on the
[1:25:51] message the voice of the pillar of Fire
[1:25:55] we taught that we we understood that the
[1:25:58] the ministry of Malachi 4 it wasn't a
[1:26:00] man it was
[1:26:03] God so whatever he says in the tapes we
[1:26:06] have to take it as God speaking
[1:26:10] to so the prophet talks about this uh
[1:26:13] this blind
[1:26:15] man and he had gone to the prophets to
[1:26:18] be to to be to be prayed for so he can
[1:26:23] see and paragraph
[1:26:26] 23 his name was John Ryan John Ryan and
[1:26:31] he
[1:26:32] says and the prophet told him I see that
[1:26:35] you are
[1:26:37] blind and he said yes sir I said the
[1:26:41] prophet said aren't you aren't you Cath
[1:26:44] Catholic he said I am and I said do you
[1:26:48] believe that God will heal
[1:26:51] you he said yes sir he said I hear some
[1:26:56] woman over there was screaming and that
[1:26:58] said let me skip that he says do you
[1:27:00] believe me to be God's
[1:27:04] servant the prophet says I have to say
[1:27:07] that because the angel told me if you
[1:27:10] get the people to
[1:27:14] believe you see not to believe me as him
[1:27:17] but to believe that he sent me to pray
[1:27:19] for you
[1:27:26] and the prophet says all right I had a
[1:27:28] prayer for
[1:27:30] him and I seen a vision before the old
[1:27:34] man I said now you have received your
[1:27:39] sight go and be made
[1:27:43] whole so when you read when you read the
[1:27:45] prophet you have to really pay attention
[1:27:46] to you have to meditate upon what he
[1:27:50] says pay attention to the order here so
[1:27:53] he's asking the person do you believe
[1:27:57] first so you cannot even want uh come to
[1:28:01] the prayer landine without faith because
[1:28:02] it's not going to do
[1:28:04] anything you yourself have to believe
[1:28:08] first and then he told him that and then
[1:28:12] the prophet saw a
[1:28:15] vision and the same Prophet also told us
[1:28:18] that the word reveal that the word is
[1:28:19] also an open
[1:28:22] Vision we also we don't need someone to
[1:28:25] see a vision in order for us to believe
[1:28:27] our
[1:28:30] healing our vision is in the book of
[1:28:32] Isaiah where he tells us that by his
[1:28:34] stripes we are already
[1:28:39] healed that he was bruised for our
[1:28:43] iniquities so that's your vision so
[1:28:47] first you
[1:28:48] believe and then you got to have a
[1:28:50] vision that tells you that you are
[1:28:51] healed
[1:28:54] okay so let's continue reading the
[1:28:57] story and and then um and I said now you
[1:29:01] are now you have received your
[1:29:04] sight go and be made
[1:29:07] whole remember the prophet says now you
[1:29:10] have received
[1:29:12] your but the man still couldn't
[1:29:15] see so you have to understand that God's
[1:29:17] language is different than our
[1:29:20] language that's why God says that his
[1:29:23] ways are not our way
[1:29:28] if God says you are healed you don't go
[1:29:30] by your five senses you go by his
[1:29:33] [Music]
[1:29:36] word and it's not just healing anything
[1:29:39] that you pray about you have to believe
[1:29:41] that you've already received
[1:29:46] that and the prophet says he went away
[1:29:49] in a few minutes here he come back again
[1:29:51] two men
[1:29:53] later said
[1:29:54] preacher you told me I'll receive my
[1:29:57] sight you told me that I'm
[1:30:00] Healed you know and the prophet says you
[1:30:04] are why he said I can't see a
[1:30:08] thing the prophet says that that don't
[1:30:11] have nothing to do with your
[1:30:15] healing you are already
[1:30:18] healed he said well if I was healed I
[1:30:20] could see couldn't I
[1:30:24] Prophet said not right
[1:30:26] now you might
[1:30:28] not but God said you was going to
[1:30:32] see so the prophet took him back to what
[1:30:35] to the promise of
[1:30:38] God he told you you you you may not see
[1:30:41] right now but God said that you are
[1:30:42] going to
[1:30:44] see and the prophet says I told you I
[1:30:47] seen a vision and you're going to
[1:30:48] receive your
[1:30:51] sight he said I've seen a vision you
[1:30:54] going to receive your sight he
[1:30:56] said he said well looks like if I was
[1:30:59] healed that I'll be able to
[1:31:02] see the prophet said not exactly it may
[1:31:05] not happen
[1:31:08] now it might happen a week from
[1:31:11] now a month from now a year from now but
[1:31:16] it's going to come to
[1:31:18] pass every promise that God makes in
[1:31:20] your life may not happen right away
[1:31:24] not happen
[1:31:25] tomorrow it may not happen a month from
[1:31:27] now it may not even happen a year from
[1:31:31] now brother bam says that we know it's
[1:31:33] going to
[1:31:35] happen you are seeking the Holy Ghost it
[1:31:38] may not happen right it may not happen
[1:31:42] tomorrow but you have to believe that
[1:31:44] eventually you will have the Holy
[1:31:47] Ghost but you got to start acting like
[1:31:50] you already have the Holy Ghost
[1:31:55] amen amen there are so many people here
[1:31:57] seeking the Holy
[1:32:01] Ghost and I'm here to encourage you to
[1:32:03] believe God because the prophet says
[1:32:05] that God wants to fill you with the Holy
[1:32:07] Ghost more than you want to have
[1:32:11] it in his own time he will make all
[1:32:14] things
[1:32:19] beautiful God doesn't go with our timing
[1:32:22] God has his own time
[1:32:25] that's why the Bible says that they that
[1:32:27] wait upon the Lord shall renew their
[1:32:31] strength when you ask anything to God
[1:32:34] you have to have
[1:32:36] patience that's not in vain that patient
[1:32:38] is one of the
[1:32:42] statute amen let's keep reading uh so
[1:32:45] the prophecy but it's going to come to
[1:32:48] pass and he said well I don't understand
[1:32:51] that
[1:32:54] God doesn't ask you to understand how
[1:32:56] he's going to make it come to
[1:32:59] pass God ask you to just believe
[1:33:02] it you don't need to understand you need
[1:33:04] to believe
[1:33:06] him and way he
[1:33:09] went and then he came back again and he
[1:33:13] says I can't see
[1:33:14] yet and I said well I don't have nothing
[1:33:17] to do with
[1:33:18] it he he say but you told me I was
[1:33:22] healed I said sir
[1:33:25] look you are fixing to lose what you
[1:33:28] have
[1:33:31] received the word of God is the
[1:33:34] same if that man was fixing to to lose
[1:33:37] what he had
[1:33:39] received because he started to question
[1:33:42] the word of
[1:33:44] God you are also going to lose what you
[1:33:46] have received the
[1:33:49] word if you pray for anything and you
[1:33:51] start wondering God why why is is it not
[1:33:55] happening and if you start doubting it
[1:33:59] the prophet says that you are fixing to
[1:34:01] lose
[1:34:03] that I don't I don't God doesn't want
[1:34:05] you to lose what you've been praying
[1:34:08] for so by that's why by his by his Mercy
[1:34:11] this morning is reminding you to keep to
[1:34:14] keep uh to have faith in his
[1:34:18] word to not look at the
[1:34:21] circumstance but to look at his promise
[1:34:25] word because that's why we leave by the
[1:34:28] Bible says that man shall not leave by
[1:34:30] bread
[1:34:31] alone man will leave by every word that
[1:34:34] proceed out of the mouth of
[1:34:37] God okay okay and the prophet
[1:34:41] says we fixing to lose what you
[1:34:44] received I said you told me that you
[1:34:47] [Music]
[1:34:50] believed he said I do
[1:34:53] he said the the prophet says then what
[1:34:55] are you questioning me about then if you
[1:34:58] believe me believe what I've told
[1:35:03] you uh he says I understand what you
[1:35:07] mean and the prophet says he just got it
[1:35:10] and he said what must do
[1:35:13] preacher said just go home but say
[1:35:17] praise the Lord and go on
[1:35:23] apply the same formula this
[1:35:26] morning whatever you've been praying
[1:35:29] for just go home and start praising
[1:35:34] God stop looking at the
[1:35:39] circumstances stop looking at what your
[1:35:41] eyes are
[1:35:43] seeing but go praise
[1:35:47] God and and I'll I'll continue the story
[1:35:49] so the prophet even says that the man
[1:35:52] went to the bar he he went on the
[1:35:56] street and he was selling
[1:36:00] newspapers and he was telling everybody
[1:36:03] that he's already
[1:36:05] healed to the point that even one person
[1:36:08] came to him and told him
[1:36:10] that you are bringing a reproach to the
[1:36:13] word of
[1:36:19] God because we can clearly see that you
[1:36:22] are blind
[1:36:25] but you are here telling us that you are
[1:36:28] healed so what he was doing he was
[1:36:30] applying what the prophet told him to
[1:36:34] do and he went to the barber at one
[1:36:38] time and you know he was just screaming
[1:36:41] extra extra I'm
[1:36:44] Healed he kept confessing with his mouth
[1:36:47] that he was
[1:36:48] healed and eventually one time he the
[1:36:51] prophet says his eyes open in
[1:36:55] he started
[1:36:57] seeing so God kept his
[1:36:59] word he didn't come the same moment that
[1:37:02] the prophet prayed for
[1:37:06] him but eventually God gave him his
[1:37:11] sight but why did he have to do the
[1:37:13] prophet says that he he says to in order
[1:37:16] for him to have a lot of faith the
[1:37:17] prophet told him to start confessing
[1:37:19] with his
[1:37:20] M the Bible tells us that God is a high
[1:37:23] PR of our
[1:37:26] confession the Bible says that there is
[1:37:28] power and death in the
[1:37:34] tongue so that's why you have to you
[1:37:36] have to speak things into
[1:37:40] existence you have to start confessing
[1:37:42] it with your
[1:37:45] mouth God doesn't want you to complain
[1:37:47] all the
[1:37:49] time he's already given you his word
[1:37:53] want you to believe
[1:37:54] it and not just to say that you believe
[1:37:57] it but you have to act like you believe
[1:37:59] it how do you act like you believe it
[1:38:02] you got to come you got to be you got to
[1:38:05] come with bold
[1:38:07] boldness and claim your
[1:38:09] healing claim your
[1:38:11] inheritance whatever it may be financial
[1:38:14] problems you know healing spiritual
[1:38:19] growth you have to start thanking God in
[1:38:21] advance for it
[1:38:25] sometimes even before when you when you
[1:38:27] pray about something we want to see you
[1:38:28] come to
[1:38:30] church and say I've got a
[1:38:34] testimony God did this for
[1:38:37] me even though you may not see it
[1:38:41] yet but I want to guarantee you that God
[1:38:44] will always keep his
[1:38:47] word you know the problem is you you
[1:38:51] have to believe the problem is never
[1:38:53] with the promises of
[1:38:55] God the problem is that we don't have
[1:38:57] enough Faith to believe his
[1:39:00] prom those same promises that God is
[1:39:03] making in the
[1:39:04] Bible it's the same promises that
[1:39:07] William Bram used to do a lot of
[1:39:11] things and whatever William Brenham did
[1:39:13] wasn't just for him to do it
[1:39:16] alone it was a blueprint for the brides
[1:39:19] to also be able to do those things
[1:39:23] Prophet says that that voice the voice
[1:39:25] of God he says that voice is now in the
[1:39:29] bride he doesn't say the voice will be
[1:39:32] it says the voice is now in the
[1:39:36] bride the voice of God that could speak
[1:39:39] things into
[1:39:41] existence the voice of God that that
[1:39:43] could give life to a
[1:39:46] fish if God could give life to a fish
[1:39:49] why wouldn't he give life why wouldn't
[1:39:52] he give life to your loved one
[1:39:55] is a fish more important to God than
[1:39:57] your
[1:39:58] soul the Bible says that your soul is
[1:40:01] more more than 10,000
[1:40:05] world the soul of your family members
[1:40:07] are more more than the
[1:40:11] feast the prophet says that God by
[1:40:14] giving life to the
[1:40:16] fish he was showing that he also cares
[1:40:19] about everything
[1:40:23] he cares about the little
[1:40:25] things he cares about the big
[1:40:29] things God just wants you to be
[1:40:33] happy the prophet says that God wants
[1:40:35] you to be
[1:40:37] happy the prophet says God wants you to
[1:40:40] ask for big
[1:40:42] things the Bible says in the Book of
[1:40:44] Malachi God wants you to
[1:40:47] challenge he says prove me and and you
[1:40:50] prove me and see if I won't pour out my
[1:40:51] blessings
[1:40:56] when God does his part he just wants you
[1:40:58] to do your
[1:41:00] part because the prophet says that the
[1:41:03] Bible says that all things are possible
[1:41:06] to him that
[1:41:08] believeth brother says that God did not
[1:41:10] say all things are possible to
[1:41:15] God he says that's what man
[1:41:18] say but all things are possible to you
[1:41:23] I had that quote somewhere here
[1:41:25] hopefully I'll
[1:41:27] find all let me
[1:41:33] see okay it's in the message the
[1:41:35] resurrection of
[1:41:38] Lazarus uh verse
[1:41:40] 37 the prophet says
[1:41:43] look
[1:41:44] deity I'm a part of Charles
[1:41:49] Bram because I was born from Charlie
[1:41:51] brandham my daddy
[1:41:54] I am a part of
[1:41:56] him I got a forehead like him my hair
[1:41:59] was like
[1:42:00] him I'm a small small man like
[1:42:04] him you know I'm in his nature because
[1:42:07] he's my
[1:42:09] dad and if we become in spirit sons of
[1:42:13] God then the deity dwells in the
[1:42:16] man Prophet says
[1:42:18] hallelujah hallelujah then you talk
[1:42:20] about blind eyes being open
[1:42:26] they said nothing is impossible to
[1:42:31] God this is why men say nothing is
[1:42:34] impossible to
[1:42:36] God but the prophet says but God
[1:42:39] said nothing is impossible with
[1:42:43] you if you will
[1:42:46] believe not with
[1:42:48] God but you because deity is in a man
[1:42:54] so this is in your in your
[1:42:57] control whatever you want is in your
[1:42:59] control this
[1:43:01] morning the prophet is taking it off the
[1:43:03] hands of God and he's put this in your
[1:43:07] hands and he took that from the from the
[1:43:10] uh from The Book of Mark chapter
[1:43:13] 9:23 if we can turn to Mark chapter 9
[1:43:17] verse 23
[1:43:30] and if you can go to um let's go back a
[1:43:34] little bit to the verse
[1:43:36] um the verse chapter 923 okay let's go
[1:43:41] to verse uh
[1:43:45] 16 and he asked the
[1:43:47] scribes what question you with
[1:43:52] them and one of the multitude answered
[1:43:54] and
[1:43:55] said master I have brought unto thee my
[1:43:58] son which has a dumb
[1:44:03] spirit and wheresoever he taketh him he
[1:44:05] teth him and he fth and Nash with his
[1:44:11] teeth and pinth
[1:44:14] away and I spake to the disciples that
[1:44:16] they should cast him out and they could
[1:44:22] not answered him and
[1:44:26] said oh Faith faithless
[1:44:29] generation how long should I be with
[1:44:33] you how long should I suffer you bring
[1:44:36] him to
[1:44:39] me so when they when they brought that
[1:44:42] dumb uh uh the child that that had a
[1:44:44] dumb Spirit to
[1:44:47] Jesus and the disciples couldn't cast
[1:44:49] him
[1:44:52] out where Jesus put the
[1:44:54] blame he says faithless
[1:44:58] generation so the problem was that they
[1:45:00] didn't have
[1:45:02] faith and they brought him unto
[1:45:06] him and when he saw him straight away
[1:45:09] the spirits tear
[1:45:12] him and he fell on the ground and
[1:45:16] wallowed for
[1:45:17] me and he asked his father how long is
[1:45:21] it ago since this came unto me
[1:45:29] and he said of a
[1:45:32] child so since he was a child he had a
[1:45:34] demon that that that was uh hurting
[1:45:38] him you know the prophet says that
[1:45:40] demons are torment torment torment
[1:45:45] spirits and this this young man had a
[1:45:48] dumb Spirit but you may have another
[1:45:49] Spirit that's been tormenting you for so
[1:45:51] long
[1:45:57] the problem is let's use what Jesus says
[1:45:59] bring him unto
[1:46:02] me so you need to go to Jesus because
[1:46:06] he's the solution to your
[1:46:08] problem and and verse 22 and often times
[1:46:13] he had cast him into the fire and into
[1:46:16] the waters to destroy
[1:46:18] [Music]
[1:46:21] him you see will always try to destroy
[1:46:26] you the Bible says that he's there to
[1:46:28] kill steal and
[1:46:31] destroy anything that Satan brings to
[1:46:34] your life is to destroy your
[1:46:37] life to destroy your marriage to destroy
[1:46:40] your family
[1:46:42] life that's why you need to have Jesus
[1:46:44] in the
[1:46:46] house to kick out that de to cast out
[1:46:48] that
[1:46:49] demon because in the in the in the Pro
[1:46:52] in the message then Jesus
[1:46:54] came then Jesus
[1:46:56] came the prophet says that anytime we we
[1:47:00] we go away from Jesus that's when that's
[1:47:02] when Trouble
[1:47:04] Comes so when you have problem in your
[1:47:07] workplace problem in your
[1:47:10] house call on Jesus you know bring him
[1:47:13] to the
[1:47:14] scene whatsoever problem you have he's
[1:47:17] going to find a
[1:47:20] solution and verse 23 Jesus said to
[1:47:23] him if thou can't
[1:47:26] believe all things are possible to him
[1:47:29] that
[1:47:30] believeth you see where the Prophet took
[1:47:32] it
[1:47:33] from Jesus didn't say all things are
[1:47:36] possible to
[1:47:40] God but Jesus says all things are
[1:47:43] possible to him that
[1:47:46] believeth because in you the prophet
[1:47:48] says that you have even you have the
[1:47:50] power to even create another world
[1:47:55] because you have the Creator that lives
[1:47:57] in the
[1:48:00] creation but the prophet says that it's
[1:48:02] it's controlled by the law of
[1:48:07] Faith amen I I have it somewhere in my
[1:48:10] notes here but because I'm using my
[1:48:12] phone to find it it's going to be a
[1:48:15] little bit difficult
[1:48:18] it oh okay let's continue I continue
[1:48:23] so so uh and like I said I'll give I'll
[1:48:26] be giving a few
[1:48:28] testimonies because it's not just enough
[1:48:30] to say that God keeps his
[1:48:33] word because when a minister preaches
[1:48:37] something the minister has to leave what
[1:48:39] he's
[1:48:41] preaching the prophet says that he never
[1:48:43] went to to speak on something that he
[1:48:46] never
[1:48:50] experience even you cannot go testify of
[1:48:53] God being real to you if you don't even
[1:48:54] know if he's
[1:48:57] real because the prophet says many
[1:48:59] people call Jesus God by just by
[1:49:04] sympathizing it's just because your
[1:49:06] pastor says
[1:49:08] that just because you heard someone says
[1:49:11] that but notice when Jesus asked the
[1:49:13] disciples who do you say that I
[1:49:16] am Jes Jesus asked who do men say that I
[1:49:21] am and the disciples started giving all
[1:49:23] sort of
[1:49:25] answers but Jesus brought it back to
[1:49:27] them
[1:49:28] again by you who do you say that I
[1:49:32] am because because the power is in
[1:49:36] you let me read this uh message of the
[1:49:42] expectation and I'll be wrapping up uh
[1:49:44] with the testimonies at the
[1:49:47] end paragraph
[1:49:51] 61 okay before we read that I found that
[1:49:54] let's go to uh the everpresent water
[1:49:56] from the rock paragraph 1
[1:50:00] 15 so the prophet says if there wasn't a
[1:50:03] law to
[1:50:05] that Sons and Daughters of God will
[1:50:08] create them a world out out of here and
[1:50:10] go live in a private life on
[1:50:16] it the prophet says you have the power
[1:50:19] in you to do it
[1:50:23] even if you've got just a shadow of the
[1:50:26] power of God in you you got the power to
[1:50:28] do
[1:50:31] it so if you have the Holy Ghost in you
[1:50:34] you have the power to go create another
[1:50:36] world and
[1:50:40] live so if I if in me I have that power
[1:50:43] then why should I worry about small
[1:50:45] things that happen in this
[1:50:49] world just speak it into existence
[1:50:53] the prophet says you have the Creator in
[1:50:57] you because whatever you speak it's not
[1:50:59] you speaking if you have the Holy Ghost
[1:51:01] is God speaking through
[1:51:05] you the prophet says the P the power
[1:51:08] that in you will make you could speak a
[1:51:11] world into existence and go live in
[1:51:15] it that's the power that is in the
[1:51:18] church
[1:51:20] now it's not in the future it's in this
[1:51:24] church right now that
[1:51:27] power every one of us born of the spirit
[1:51:30] of God can have the power in you to
[1:51:32] create a
[1:51:35] world so when I'm reading this quote I
[1:51:37] don't want you to think about anybody
[1:51:39] else by
[1:51:42] yourself because when you don't know
[1:51:44] your potential that's why the devil just
[1:51:45] plays with you like he wants
[1:51:49] to that's why the prophet says that when
[1:51:51] the bride will know who she truly
[1:51:55] is then the Rapture will take
[1:51:59] place you are living under your
[1:52:03] privileges you have that power in
[1:52:06] you and you are you are just to say Amen
[1:52:09] to
[1:52:10] it and um and the prophec but it is
[1:52:14] controlled by a
[1:52:16] law and the law is not keeping a bunch
[1:52:19] of
[1:52:20] commandment but it's a law of
[1:52:23] Faith Jesus says all things are possible
[1:52:26] to them that
[1:52:29] believe and if you can believe
[1:52:32] it whatever God will lead your soul to
[1:52:35] believe that is
[1:52:40] yours he he did not say some he said
[1:52:43] whatever God will lead your soul to
[1:52:45] believe it is not your
[1:52:47] neighbors but it is
[1:52:50] yours amen amen
[1:52:52] every place The Souls of your food can
[1:52:55] set upon by faith God gives it to
[1:53:01] you every place your soul even
[1:53:04] immigration because you know God
[1:53:07] whatever God does in the natural it's
[1:53:10] it's also the
[1:53:12] spiritual the children of Israel even
[1:53:14] though this also meant the spiritual
[1:53:15] aspect of
[1:53:18] it but they still had to go physically
[1:53:22] uh possess the
[1:53:26] land do you think that God brought you
[1:53:28] here in the US just in
[1:53:31] vain God doesn't do anything by by
[1:53:37] Hazard God is a
[1:53:40] perfectionist everything he does there's
[1:53:42] a purpose to
[1:53:44] it there are so many millions of people
[1:53:48] that wants to come to the
[1:53:50] US but why did God make a way for
[1:53:54] you why did God bring you here in
[1:53:57] Iowa I'm here to tell you that God
[1:53:59] brought you here to be a
[1:54:01] witness to be a witness of this
[1:54:05] message to be a witness that God sent a
[1:54:08] prophet in this last
[1:54:11] age to be a witness that God rose from
[1:54:14] the
[1:54:16] dead God did not just bring here to just
[1:54:19] be
[1:54:20] rich or to just to work 9 to
[1:54:23] 5 or to go to
[1:54:26] school those are the benefits that comes
[1:54:28] with you coming to
[1:54:31] us but that's not the main goal why God
[1:54:34] brought you
[1:54:38] here God brought you in this in this
[1:54:41] city to be a
[1:54:44] witness and let me continue reading that
[1:54:50] quote it's yours you possess it and if
[1:54:55] you can find the key to this law of
[1:54:57] faith that opens it to
[1:55:03] you you see what I mean you know if you
[1:55:06] are a son of God you are or you are a
[1:55:09] daughter of God that never leaves
[1:55:12] you that power never leaves you if you
[1:55:15] are a son of
[1:55:16] God that that power never leaves you if
[1:55:19] you are a daughter of God
[1:55:22] you did not become a daughter of God
[1:55:26] now you did not become a Son of God just
[1:55:29] today but you were Sons and Daughters of
[1:55:32] God before the foundation of the
[1:55:34] world when you came into this world in
[1:55:37] you you had that power
[1:55:40] in so so whatever obst obstacles comes
[1:55:43] in your way just speak
[1:55:48] it if you want Health just speak healthy
[1:55:53] God has already written the
[1:55:55] check he put He wrote he wrote it in the
[1:55:58] name of the Lord Jesus
[1:56:00] Christ he just gave it to you to apply
[1:56:04] it the prophet says that God doesn't
[1:56:06] heal you just
[1:56:08] today the prophet says that God has
[1:56:10] already healed
[1:56:12] you whatsoever you desire God has
[1:56:15] already given that to
[1:56:17] you that's why God puts that in your
[1:56:20] hand he says whatsoever you believe
[1:56:25] you it will be given to
[1:56:27] you so it depends on the faith that and
[1:56:30] if you don't have enough
[1:56:32] Faith ask God to give you that
[1:56:36] Faith because the this man says uh Lord
[1:56:40] I he says um uh I I don't believe by
[1:56:43] help my
[1:56:44] unbelief he say he says I believe but
[1:56:47] help my
[1:56:49] unbelief that's that's the attitude we
[1:56:51] need to have when
[1:56:54] Lord I have
[1:56:56] faith but if this faith that I have is
[1:56:58] not enough to get the blessing that that
[1:57:00] that belongs to
[1:57:03] me give me more faith because that
[1:57:06] promise is
[1:57:07] yours God did not make those promises to
[1:57:11] Angels God made those promises to
[1:57:14] you the song says every promise in the
[1:57:17] book is
[1:57:19] mine every verse every chapter every
[1:57:22] long every line belongs to you it's your
[1:57:26] inheritance Satan has robbed you of your
[1:57:29] blessings Satan has robbed you of your
[1:57:33] joy Satan has robbed you of so many
[1:57:36] things and now it is time for you to
[1:57:38] claim it
[1:57:40] back because that doesn't belong to
[1:57:43] Satan that belongs to you you know the
[1:57:46] prophet says that when man fell in the
[1:57:48] Garden of
[1:57:50] Eden Adam Adam had the
[1:57:56] title Adam had the power to even name
[1:57:58] animals to do what to do anything he
[1:58:01] wanted to the prophet says that Adam was
[1:58:04] the God of this
[1:58:06] Earth but when he se he lost that he
[1:58:09] lost that that that
[1:58:12] title you know and that that went then
[1:58:14] Satan took it that's why the Bible says
[1:58:17] that Satan is the God of this Earth
[1:58:23] but we see in the Book of Revelation
[1:58:24] that the lamb was found worthy to take
[1:58:27] back that
[1:58:31] possession he wasn't no angels that was
[1:58:33] the prophet says that Angels were worthy
[1:58:36] I for
[1:58:38] that but the problem is that he needed a
[1:58:41] man to do
[1:58:43] that the prophet said if you notice the
[1:58:46] Book of Revelation he never says no he
[1:58:49] says no man was worthy he didn't say No
[1:58:51] Angel
[1:58:55] but because of the law of redemption he
[1:58:56] needed to be a near Kinsman to
[1:59:04] redeem that's why God made himself human
[1:59:08] to be a near
[1:59:10] Kinsman and he took back that possession
[1:59:13] that key from the
[1:59:14] devil he P the
[1:59:17] price and now he's giving it back to you
[1:59:20] whatsoever you speak it be given to
[1:59:23] you now you are Gods on
[1:59:26] earth now you are the god of your
[1:59:30] circumstances now now in the future but
[1:59:33] now this morning you are the god of your
[1:59:38] circumstances you just need to believe
[1:59:40] that God keeps his
[1:59:42] word and then you take it into your your
[1:59:45] possession and you speak it into
[1:59:50] existence I'm not keeping track of of
[1:59:52] the time so I'll just give a testimony
[1:59:53] real
[1:59:55] quick I I've given this testimony before
[1:59:58] I think that was on a
[2:00:01] Wednesday so for those that never heard
[2:00:03] it I'll give it again I have like about
[2:00:06] three that I'll
[2:00:08] give so um I had an I had an issue with
[2:00:11] my school before I
[2:00:15] graduated and the school had a law where
[2:00:18] the school had a law that if you don't
[2:00:20] uh submit your assignment on
[2:00:25] time uh you get dropped from the
[2:00:29] class and you can only be dropped from
[2:00:31] the class um two
[2:00:34] times so the the third the the third
[2:00:37] time you get Dro from a class
[2:00:40] you yeah the third time you get dropped
[2:00:42] from a class you lose access to the
[2:00:46] school you won't even be able to
[2:00:48] complete your program anymore so it's
[2:00:50] just best for you to find another
[2:00:54] and I had an issue that I struggled with
[2:00:56] is
[2:00:58] procrastination always waiting till the
[2:01:00] last minutes to do
[2:01:02] things and then I um I missed my first
[2:01:05] assignment I was Dro I was dropped from
[2:01:07] the
[2:01:11] class and then I was like okay I got one
[2:01:13] more chance I can get back in the
[2:01:15] class I got back in the
[2:01:17] class and then I procrastinated again I
[2:01:20] forgot to submit my assignment and I was
[2:01:22] dropped from the
[2:01:25] class and so I couldn't I had to leave
[2:01:28] the
[2:01:29] school because I couldn't finish my
[2:01:31] program anymore and I was so close to
[2:01:33] the
[2:01:34] end I felt really
[2:01:36] bad and I came to church one one
[2:01:39] night I checked on the
[2:01:42] system to see if there was actually any
[2:01:45] possible way for me to
[2:01:47] register but the class wasn't even in
[2:01:49] the system anymore so they wouldn't even
[2:01:51] put the class so that I won't
[2:01:54] [Music]
[2:01:56] register so I came to church I I was
[2:01:58] right here and I started praying and
[2:02:02] when I was praying um I I heard um it
[2:02:05] wasn't an audible voice but it's like
[2:02:07] something spoke to
[2:02:09] me and something told me why cry
[2:02:12] speak you know and um I was like well if
[2:02:16] God tells me to speak it's not up to me
[2:02:18] to back up that that word
[2:02:23] it's up to me to be responsible to his
[2:02:25] own
[2:02:26] word so I said in the name of Jesus
[2:02:30] Christ I pray that the class be created
[2:02:32] in the
[2:02:34] system and that I can
[2:02:38] register and that's it I just went back
[2:02:40] and I contined doing my
[2:02:43] things and that's one thing about when
[2:02:45] you ask anything to God you don't have
[2:02:47] to go back to the same thing all the
[2:02:49] time you just have to believe it and
[2:02:51] move on
[2:02:54] and uh the following day I came back to
[2:02:56] church
[2:02:57] again and at night I was like oh I
[2:02:59] remember I prayed about this issue
[2:03:00] yesterday let me check if the class is
[2:03:03] in the
[2:03:04] system so I checked and then I saw the
[2:03:08] class and I couldn't believe it I was
[2:03:11] like like is this real let me see if I
[2:03:14] can actually you the register maybe the
[2:03:15] class is there but I cannot
[2:03:18] register I tried to register and I
[2:03:20] register
[2:03:23] I praised God and I came on Wednesday
[2:03:24] and I gave the testimony
[2:03:27] CH and when I gave the
[2:03:29] testimony I went back home Satan
[2:03:31] challenged me
[2:03:33] again Satan told me that are you sure
[2:03:36] that the the policy had
[2:03:40] stated instead of having two classes
[2:03:42] maybe you were supposed to fail three
[2:03:46] times but you thought it was two times
[2:03:49] and you went in the church and you gave
[2:03:51] a false test
[2:03:54] and while those thoughts are going in my
[2:03:57] head I Reed an email from the
[2:04:01] school and the school is saying that the
[2:04:05] school is going to change the policy of
[2:04:07] the entire
[2:04:09] school where it's no longer going to be
[2:04:11] two classes that you fa but it's going
[2:04:13] to be three
[2:04:16] classes but it's going to be effective
[2:04:19] it was going to be effective two months
[2:04:21] from the
[2:04:25] email so the time of the
[2:04:28] email polic stated that it was
[2:04:30] impossible for me to get back
[2:04:34] in but God Made A Way and God changed an
[2:04:38] entire school's policy because of one
[2:04:40] man's
[2:04:43] prayer you don't realize the power
[2:04:45] that's in
[2:04:47] you God can all even change the laws of
[2:04:50] this country just because of
[2:04:54] God changed the laws of the land because
[2:04:55] of
[2:04:58] Daniel and if you can do it for Daniel
[2:05:00] he can do it for
[2:05:01] you that's why I always tell people like
[2:05:05] some people when they see what's
[2:05:06] happening in the political
[2:05:08] realm they start getting
[2:05:10] agitated they're like oh Trump is uh
[2:05:14] going to deport
[2:05:16] everybody but you forget that you are a
[2:05:18] son of
[2:05:19] God the only way that you can be
[2:05:22] deported from this
[2:05:24] country is if God allows for you to be
[2:05:29] deported God didn't just bring you here
[2:05:31] in
[2:05:33] vain you can speak things into
[2:05:36] existence you are the God of this
[2:05:40] Earth but only if God lives in
[2:05:43] you the second testimony I have to give
[2:05:46] and this is while I'm wrapping
[2:05:49] up um this happened just a few week
[2:05:51] weeks
[2:05:53] ago um I don't think I'll mention the
[2:05:56] name but there was uh there was a a
[2:06:00] parent in the before that happened I had
[2:06:02] a
[2:06:04] dream and in that dream I saw that the
[2:06:07] son of this one
[2:06:10] man was in was in some legal
[2:06:14] trouble something that something that
[2:06:17] had involved a
[2:06:19] woman and he was going to go to
[2:06:23] jail and in the dream I saw that we
[2:06:26] gathered somewhere and we were about to
[2:06:27] pray for for the
[2:06:30] person and I woke up from the
[2:06:33] dream I remember I went to tell the
[2:06:35] father of that
[2:06:38] person and I was like this is a dream
[2:06:41] that I
[2:06:43] had so I told him this before even the
[2:06:45] event have
[2:06:47] happen and a few a few weeks forward
[2:06:51] uh I think she gave that the mother gave
[2:06:54] the prayer request in the
[2:06:56] church because her son is in legal
[2:07:01] trouble and after my last sermon that I
[2:07:04] preached the voice of the pillow of
[2:07:08] fire she came to see me in the
[2:07:12] office and she explained the
[2:07:14] problem and she said she explained
[2:07:16] exactly what the dream that I
[2:07:19] had and I told him I told her
[2:07:22] her that we'll pray about that and God
[2:07:26] is going to take care of it so we prayed
[2:07:30] and in the prayer I asked God to drop
[2:07:33] the
[2:07:36] charges I asked God to for for that for
[2:07:40] the that kid not to go to jail
[2:07:44] anymore and we prayed and we just
[2:07:47] believed and we moved
[2:07:48] on and I believe last week or two weeks
[2:07:50] ago
[2:07:53] she came with a praise
[2:07:56] report to say that her son is no longer
[2:07:59] going to
[2:08:00] jail that the charges have been
[2:08:05] dropped this is being a witness that God
[2:08:08] keeps his
[2:08:10] word I trusted
[2:08:13] God I didn't trust
[2:08:15] myself I trusted God and you also if you
[2:08:19] trust what whatever God say
[2:08:24] the same God who could answer my prayer
[2:08:25] can also answer your
[2:08:28] prayer and remember the Bible says while
[2:08:31] Peter yet spoke the Holy Ghost
[2:08:34] fa so when when Peter spoke the the
[2:08:37] congregation had faith in what Peter was
[2:08:40] speaking and they received Their
[2:08:43] Blessings so even you this morning if
[2:08:45] you have faith not in my words but in
[2:08:48] the word of
[2:08:50] God whatever you desire God is going to
[2:08:52] give it to
[2:08:54] you third testimony this happened last
[2:09:00] Sunday same sermon I preach in Iowa
[2:09:03] City I I challenged the congregation
[2:09:07] to to try God to take God at his
[2:09:10] word for whatever problem they
[2:09:13] need and I asked them to pray when we
[2:09:15] when we were
[2:09:18] praying and um I while I was praying um
[2:09:21] I I said that whatever you have even
[2:09:23] financial problem God can
[2:09:27] give so there was a couple there they
[2:09:30] needed some
[2:09:32] money and they called me on Monday to
[2:09:34] give me the
[2:09:36] testimony he said while I was
[2:09:39] praying they were repeating my
[2:09:42] prayer and especially the part where I
[2:09:44] mentioned about financial because they
[2:09:46] needed some
[2:09:48] money and they said when they walked out
[2:09:51] of the
[2:09:53] church not even two minutes
[2:09:55] after they received a call from
[2:09:58] somebody who said I just had you in my
[2:10:01] mind and I thought I'll give you
[2:10:05] $1,000 why because they took God at his
[2:10:09] word and I'm telling you that God also
[2:10:11] wants you to be a
[2:10:14] witness because God wants you to be a
[2:10:16] witness that he's faithful to his
[2:10:19] word you have many question does God

[2:20:54] this quote by the prophet in the message
[2:20:57] Be Be not Afraid paragraph
[2:21:00] 200 he says uh that's the way it is
[2:21:04] today friends this old Bible is just
[2:21:07] full of
[2:21:13] treasures all through
[2:21:16] there why should you be sick or poverty
[2:21:19] stricken
[2:21:23] you need money the prophet says why
[2:21:25] should you be poverty
[2:21:28] stricken you need healing why should you
[2:21:30] be
[2:21:33] sick why should you be cold and in
[2:21:39] different you want the fire of God to
[2:21:41] also be in your life the prophet is say
[2:21:43] why should you be cold or
[2:21:46] indiff why when the Bible is full of the
[2:21:49] promises of God
[2:21:53] don't be afraid it's the Lord
[2:21:56] Jesus I want to tell you this
[2:21:58] morning the same Jesus is
[2:22:01] here if he could do it for others he can
[2:22:04] do it for
[2:22:05] you don't be afraid it's the Lord Jesus
[2:22:09] Christ he wants you to be his
[2:22:12] witness God has heard your
[2:22:15] cry God has heard people questioning if
[2:22:18] God keeps his word or not
[2:22:22] and God this morning want to show to you
[2:22:24] that it's not just up to the
[2:22:26] preacher it's not just for the preacher
[2:22:28] to pray for you but you have the power
[2:22:31] in
[2:22:32] you in the message the testimony of a
[2:22:34] true
[2:22:35] witness he says and we realize as
[2:22:37] Christians that we live so far so far
[2:22:41] under our
[2:22:43] privileges we are very very far from our
[2:22:48] Privileges and he says you do not desire
[2:22:51] us to be like
[2:22:53] that tired and
[2:22:56] weary and run down and
[2:23:00] weakening always falling down to
[2:23:03] sin Temptation can get us so
[2:23:07] easy God doesn't desire you to be like
[2:23:11] that the prophet says you desire us to
[2:23:14] be filled with the spirit of
[2:23:18] God God's desire for this morning is to
[2:23:21] be filled with his
[2:23:24] Spirit he says God is true to his
[2:23:29] promise no matter what he has to

[2:31:43] friend oh I'm going to read this quotes
[2:31:46] before I pray it's in the message
[2:31:48] expectation paragraph
[2:31:52] 61 in
[2:31:55] 1961 the prophet said he he separated
[2:32:02] himself and if you'll
[2:32:04] notice what he waited for God told him
[2:32:07] to separate himself from all his
[2:32:13] Kindred and God never did bless him
[2:32:15] anymore till he obeyed him fully
[2:32:20] paragraph 62 and when we get all the
[2:32:24] little disbelieving Spirits away from
[2:32:30] us you know if you can project that so
[2:32:33] paragraph 62 and when we get all the
[2:32:35] little disbelieving Spirits away from
[2:32:40] us and just take God at his
[2:32:44] word and I don't care what so and so
[2:32:48] said or so and so said
[2:32:52] God made the
[2:32:54] promise I stand right
[2:32:56] here then God will go to answer him but
[2:33:00] remember he blessed
[2:33:02] him and he kept him and so forth and fed
[2:33:06] him and led him from place to
[2:33:11] place but he never fully blessed him and
[2:33:14] give him the promise until he completely
[2:33:17] separated himself from every little
[2:33:19] thing of the world
[2:33:24] God has many promises for you but you
[2:33:26] need to separate yourself from the world
[2:33:28] in order to see those in your
[2:33:32] life the prophet says that he let his
[2:33:34] nephew go on down to Sodom if he wanted
[2:33:38] to his father died then God told
[2:33:42] him rise and look through the
[2:33:47] land I give it all to you
[2:33:50] God had made a promise to
[2:33:52] Abraham he gave the entire land to
[2:33:57] Abraham but he had to separate himself
[2:33:59] from all
[2:34:02] unbelief and then and the prophet says L
[2:34:05] East look north west and south I think
[2:34:07] that's the
[2:34:14] way if a
[2:34:16] church a people ever comes to a place
[2:34:19] place where they completely separate
[2:34:21] themselves from the things of the
[2:34:24] world then you can look through every
[2:34:27] promise in the
[2:34:30] Bible all
[2:34:32] yours you know it's like a a it's like a
[2:34:36] great big
[2:34:40] arcade arcade and by one Spirit we are
[2:34:43] baptized into the
[2:34:47] arcade some people just come into the
[2:34:49] arced by the Holy Ghost baptism and say
[2:34:51] Well thank the Lord I got
[2:34:56] in thank the Lord I'm here the prophet
[2:34:59] says that isn't
[2:35:01] it to me what did God say to
[2:35:06] Abraham get up and look all through the
[2:35:10] land it's all It All Belongs to
[2:35:13] You church this morning this is your
[2:35:17] land full of promises
[2:35:21] I encourage you to start looking through
[2:35:23] all the promises that God made for
[2:35:26] you don't just limit yourself to One
[2:35:29] Promise this all belongs to
[2:35:31] you you know and then he says the
[2:35:34] prophet says that that's the way that's
[2:35:37] the way when I come into
[2:35:41] Christ I wanted to look
[2:35:44] around not just to know he saved
[2:35:47] me but what else have I got in
[2:35:50] there if somebody gives me a big archade
[2:35:54] I went into it and I like to examine the
[2:35:58] thing to see what
[2:36:01] God that's the way with Christians
[2:36:04] today they fail to examine the promise
[2:36:08] of
[2:36:09] God and see that there are to whatsoever
[2:36:14] [Music]
[2:36:15] will if something is a little high I'll
[2:36:18] get me a step
[2:36:20] ladder and get up to it look on the sh
[2:36:24] and see what belongs to
[2:36:27] me you Christians sometimes don't
[2:36:32] look you don't
[2:36:34] examine to find out what belongs to
[2:36:38] you healing is
[2:36:40] yours salvation is yours Joy is yours
[2:36:46] peace every promise in the Bible is
[2:36:49] yours
[2:36:51] rest is yours he said come unto me you
[2:36:54] are heavy laden and I will give you
[2:36:56] rest when a man is filled with the Holy
[2:36:59] Spirit God gives him a checkbook with a
[2:37:02] with with Jesus name wrote on the bottom
[2:37:04] of
[2:37:08] it just send it in don't be afraid to
[2:37:12] write it
[2:37:13] out whatever problem you have Don't Be
[2:37:18] Afraid even if it's it's too
[2:37:20] big you know if you believe you can't
[2:37:22] speak to this mountain and this mountain
[2:37:24] will be
[2:37:26] moved and Prophet said and he will send
[2:37:29] down his Bountiful blessings upon you of
[2:37:32] what he
[2:37:35] promised so as as I pray you know just
[2:37:38] raise your hand and and believe that
[2:37:41] whatsoever you ask to God he already
[2:37:43] gave it to
[2:37:44] you and God is going to prove to you
[2:37:47] that he's he's faithful to his word
[2:37:51] Heavenly Father Lord
[2:37:52] Jesus how good you are Lord God father
[2:37:56] you give us your word Lord to know
[2:37:58] father that we can count on your
[2:38:01] word Jesus the prophet says that in
[2:38:03] order for you to be God you have to be
[2:38:05] faithful to your
[2:38:08] word and Heavenly Father Lord you
[2:38:10] created us here to Worship You
[2:38:13] Lord and Heavenly Father Lord you I
[2:38:16] don't believe in coincidence father
[2:38:19] you brought this message this morning
[2:38:21] because you want to you you looking for
[2:38:23] Witnesses Lord
[2:38:24] Jesus Lord your word has been put to the
[2:38:28] test L the word has been put to the test
[2:38:31] and the question is that does God keeps
[2:38:33] his
[2:38:36] word father we are here to say yes you
[2:38:39] keep your
[2:38:40] word and we want you father Lord to back
[2:38:43] up your word Lord Jesus because your
[2:38:46] Prophet told us father that you are not
[2:38:47] you are faithful to your word Lord
[2:38:51] Jesus you gave us so many promises in
[2:38:53] the in the Bible
[2:38:56] Lord and we pray that you forgive us for
[2:38:58] coming for falling short of those
[2:39:00] promises Lord
[2:39:03] God and complaining all the time and
[2:39:05] acting as if we don't have that power in
[2:39:07] US
[2:39:09] Lord but you reminded us father that we
[2:39:12] have the power in us to even create the
[2:39:13] world into
[2:39:16] existence Lord your children prayed I
[2:39:18] don't know what problems they had Lord
[2:39:21] Jesus I don't know what their needs are
[2:39:24] Lord but you know their needs Lord Jesus
[2:39:27] and father you say that you are you will
[2:39:29] supply to their needs Jesus you you
[2:39:33] promise that you will supply to our
[2:39:35] needs Lord Jes and your own word you
[2:39:38] said that father Heaven and Earth will
[2:39:40] pass away but your word will never pass
[2:39:41] away
[2:39:43] Lord Lord Jesus if there be any
[2:39:46] unbelieving Spirits here Lord God
[2:39:50] I pray that you be merciful to that
[2:39:51] person Lord and that you give him or her
[2:39:55] faith to believe your word
[2:39:57] Lord because you don't want us to live
[2:39:59] under our privileges Lord and father
[2:40:02] Lord the only way we live under our
[2:40:04] privileges is when we don't have faith
[2:40:07] Lord there's so much potential in US

[2:40:13] to those that don't have faith Lord

[2:40:35] Lord
[2:40:37] Jesus and I ask these things in the name
[2:40:39] of Jesus Christ
[2:40:41] Lord because you said
[2:40:44] father that if we shall ask you anything
[2:40:47] in your name
[2:40:50] not the name of the
[2:40:52] father not the name of the son not the
[2:40:55] name of the Holy Ghost not the name of
[2:40:58] Allah not the name of Buddha not the

[2:41:05] name in this world
[2:41:07] Lord but in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:41:10] Christ because that's where our trust is
[2:41:13] Lord because some put their trust in
[2:41:16] chariots or hores
[2:41:19] verse that says but we will remember the
[2:41:21] name of the Lord for the name of the
[2:41:24] Lord is our Strong
