[7:02] surely God is good to us a they're not
[7:04] prolonging the time for those of you who
[7:08] prayed that God would turn my Bible he
[7:11] did indeed thank God for his victory
[7:15] amen praise the Lord
[7:17] I left it in Iowa City didn't know it
[7:20] but regardless I'm just glad to have it
[7:24] surely thank you for your prayers this
[7:28] is my buddy I got some friends but this
[7:33] is my buddy and these are my other
[7:35] Bibles surely God is good to us hey man
[7:39] you know this Bible when I want to find
[7:42] something he somehow it helps me
[7:43] [Music]
[7:44] sometimes it's flipped right to what I
[7:47] need we love the Lord God is good to us
[7:52] I don't know exactly so don't let me
[7:58] forget but we're gonna have brother
[8:00] Simmons come up sometime and we're going
[8:03] to have a few days of meetings Holy
[8:06] Ghost meetings just all the Holy Ghost
[8:09] whether or not whether or not we dismiss
[8:12] or get out it's up to God but that's the
[8:16] kind of meetings we gonna have and he
[8:19] accepted I just got to find out when we
[8:22] want to do that we'll invite both
[8:25] churches by God's grace and if they want
[8:31] to come they want to come we we were
[8:34] under sitting like this the Lord really
[8:37] blessed in my endeavor today so things
[8:41] are moving forward in that way yes
[8:44] so we love the Lord and we thank God for
[8:47] being so so so good to us
[8:50] amen so got a different little thought
[8:55] today we're trusting that the Lord will
[9:00] bless this thought I could still work on
[9:02] the blood is so much more to work on in
[9:05] that it's because
[9:09] I really see I see God in so many ways
[9:13] now like I never have seen him before
[9:17] but anyway let us turn the first John
[9:19] three first John three and then we'll go
[9:25] to Genesis the fourth chapter we're not
[9:27] going to be long I really appreciate
[9:31] your waiting on me I I didn't know I was
[9:32] going to get here as early as we did but
[9:35] it all worked together praise the Lord I
[9:39] was really anxious to get home so haha
[9:42] but I kept being trapped at caught in
[9:44] the office different questions and
[9:46] things up from the young people and it
[9:48] was really needed needful rather glad to
[9:52] see our brother Vincent back know that
[9:54] we always miss you always and I was just
[10:01] so happy to see that the Lord brought
[10:03] you back safely first John the third
[10:08] chapter we're going to start reading the
[10:11] from the 11th of the 12th verse tell my
[10:19] brother and friend I failed I didn't
[10:21] have dinner with him tell me the next
[10:24] time he comes amen first John 3rd
[10:31] chapter xi of the 12th verse but this is
[10:34] the message that you heard from the
[10:36] beginning that we should love one
[10:40] another not as Cain who was of that
[10:45] wicked one and slew his brother and
[10:50] wherefore slew he him because his own
[10:53] works were evil and his brothers
[10:57] righteous now watch how God called this
[11:00] man's work evil all that he had done
[11:05] didn't have a revelation but he tried to
[11:10] give God something that was not
[11:12] according to his plan which made him
[11:15] Antichrist because he wanted God to
[11:17] accept it and the only thing that God
[11:20] could accept was his word
[11:22] that which he had planned his old plan
[11:24] God cannot work according to our plan it
[11:28] must be his and just to see how God
[11:32] called his work evil brother branham
[11:37] said he was religious he was just as
[11:39] religious as Abel was worked hard
[11:43] diligently right but he failed in that
[11:48] he rejected the truth and we know that
[11:52] you cannot go into error until you
[11:54] reject the truth all right Genesis 4
[12:12] all God requires is obedience that's all
[12:17] he asked for able from a cane is
[12:20] obedience and Cain refused obedience and
[12:26] a lot of time people in the church don't
[12:28] even know that when you refuse obedience
[12:30] that's not the Spirit of Christ that's
[12:32] Antichrist doesn't make you Antichrist
[12:36] but you are being influenced by our
[12:39] spirit that is not of Christ okay
[12:42] Judas is four or five but unto Cain and
[12:50] to his offering he had not respect and
[12:54] Cain was very wroth and his countenance
[12:58] fell and the Lord said unto Cain why art
[13:02] thou wroth and why is thy countenance
[13:05] fallen if thou do it well shall not be
[13:10] accepted and if thou do it not well
[13:13] seeing lieth at the door and unto thee
[13:17] shall be his desire be his desire and
[13:20] thou shalt rule over him and Cain talked
[13:26] with Abel his brother and it came to
[13:29] pass when they were in the field that
[13:32] Cain rose up against Abel his brother
[13:34] and slew him and the Lord said if the
[13:39] Cain where is Abel thy brother and he
[13:42] said I know not am I my brother's keeper
[13:45] and he said thou has what has thou done
[13:49] the voice of thy brother's blood crieth
[13:53] unto me from the ground
[13:55] let us pray Lord we thank you for your
[13:58] grace and we thank you for your mercy
[14:01] we thank you for being so good to us
[14:03] Lord we pray O God that you would bless
[14:06] the service in a special way thank you
[14:10] Jesus have thine own way amen you may be
[14:14] seated
[14:17] we we go through the scriptures and we
[14:19] find out that Paul tells us telling
[14:22] Timothy that we ought to contend for the
[14:25] faith that means
[14:26] to fight for it but often time we don't
[14:29] and for some reason you know when we
[14:32] don't fight Satan takes more ground
[14:35] I'd like to entitle this message war on
[14:39] the Antichrist because we realize a man
[14:44] that the it is the Antichrist that has
[14:46] who has war a waged war against us but
[14:51] we realize a man that God has given us
[14:54] weapon tree and he has given us a
[14:56] warfare he has given us war garments put
[14:59] on the whole armor of God that you might
[15:02] be able to stand and withstand the wiles
[15:05] of the devil the thing that Satan has
[15:08] always done is that he always introduced
[15:12] what we call a false light and he calls
[15:15] it enlightenment something that is going
[15:18] to stir your mind something that is
[15:20] going to give you supposedly a greater
[15:22] revelation as he did with Eve he
[15:25] enlightened her amen and by enlightened
[15:28] her lighting her we find out that she
[15:32] failed God why because she listened to a
[15:37] spirit that was anti God or Antichrist
[15:42] he introduced a new plan a reproduction
[15:47] when God had already told them that they
[15:51] would produce and I'll reproduce so we
[15:54] realized by God grace that spirit is
[15:56] really slick it's closed and if you know
[16:00] much about a serpent he is really a
[16:02] slick fella a serpent can easily crawl
[16:06] next to you and you won't even know he's
[16:08] there
[16:09] because he moves so subtly and he's a
[16:12] such a creepy thing but we find out by
[16:16] God and that's how that serpent was even
[16:18] though he was like in the form of the
[16:19] land he had an agenda we don't know how
[16:24] many times he spoke with Eve before she
[16:27] really started communicating but if I if
[16:30] I have anything to think about we know
[16:33] that surely wasn't the first time they
[16:35] had talked but somewhere down the road
[16:38] be
[16:39] the serpent or the real devil I was able
[16:43] to get behind the Serpent and influence
[16:47] him to seduce even the way because
[16:52] otherwise why would God judge the
[16:55] serpent if he didn't know better right
[17:02] so he had to have enough intelligence
[17:04] like the prophet of God said the only
[17:07] thing he did not have was a soul so he
[17:10] had enough intelligence to know right
[17:15] from wrong
[17:16] otherwise God could not have been just
[17:19] the animals are not being punished
[17:22] because of us because of their sin scuse
[17:26] me but they're being punished because of
[17:28] our sins now we look at this thing and
[17:32] you say well what is it enlightenment
[17:34] enlightenment is to give intelligent and
[17:36] intellectual or spiritual light and you
[17:40] know the devil is really good that's why
[17:42] so many people think that he is God
[17:46] Satan is God because of the
[17:49] Enlightenment and whenever Satan brings
[17:53] enlightenment he's always taking you
[17:57] away from the word he never stays within
[18:03] the word he takes us from from the word
[18:06] so we thank God amen that we can see by
[18:10] God's grace that moving of the
[18:12] Antichrist then that Christ has always
[18:15] worked through out the church ages he
[18:18] worked through the history of mankind
[18:21] forever and what what were you mean
[18:24] because he that's how come the children
[18:29] in the days of Noah became so wicked
[18:32] because they were internists reasoning
[18:36] and the reasoning that they were working
[18:41] with had no real foundation you see is
[18:45] nothing wrong with reasoning because the
[18:47] Bible says come let us reason together
[18:50] as long as you
[18:55] including the word and the word it's
[18:57] become the thing that you're reasoning
[18:59] with not against with that yo-yo your
[19:03] concept is the word is right and I am
[19:08] wrong and what did the devil do like I
[19:11] said I won't be low but I want to show
[19:12] you something there like right spirit is
[19:15] such a subtle thing it comes to a place
[19:18] and I don't know why it happens all the
[19:20] time I get in the pulpit adjust but
[19:22] anyway you it is such a subtle thing and
[19:25] and it works right among us it can work
[19:29] right among us and if you're not
[19:31] spiritual you will not discern it hello
[19:37] it works in music it works in preachers
[19:41] hello it works
[19:43] amen whoever allows it to anoint them
[19:48] Satan will always take any excess just a
[19:53] little crack he'll take it because we
[19:57] realize that evil serpents can crawl
[19:59] into some very abnormal priests places
[20:02] do too even if the size of the crack is
[20:06] small so we realized by God's grace that
[20:09] when it comes to the mind of God this is
[20:13] the only thing that protects us from the
[20:17] inner Christ having the mind of God and
[20:22] when you have the mind of God you know
[20:25] the will of God you know the Word of God
[20:29] you know it's like for example when
[20:32] Peter said unto Jesus Lord you surely
[20:36] you're not gonna die you're not going to
[20:38] Calvary what did Jesus say he admits he
[20:43] may have meant it in a fatter your
[20:45] compliment at oh you know how people do
[20:47] not he didn't mean any harm but Jesus
[20:50] saw the serpent he saw the enemy amen
[20:55] using Peters lip and he says Satan get
[20:59] thee behind me alright I'll think about
[21:03] jobs wife who was a
[21:06] religious woman who loved her husband
[21:08] was there for him and at the end of all
[21:12] of the tests just about just almost
[21:15] there the devil uses her and said why
[21:19] don't you just curse God and die Joe
[21:23] being a spiritual woman didn't let me
[21:26] and didn't get upset at his wife he saw
[21:29] the Anti Christ he saw her speaking
[21:32] something that was not according to the
[21:35] word hallelujah remembered that job had
[21:39] already said he said the Lord giveth and
[21:41] the Lord taketh away blessed be the name
[21:44] of the Lord
[21:45] he was determined to praise God no
[21:48] matter what his situations were and
[21:51] whatever he fell into he was going to
[21:53] praise God right and Joel looked at the
[21:56] Wallace's woman you sound foolish I like
[21:59] this he said you don't sound like my
[22:01] wife in other words I know who's behind
[22:04] this voice so you looked and you saw our
[22:08] brother what are you saying I am saying
[22:10] that this is why is it important that we
[22:13] take we check each other we check each
[22:17] other because whenever we say anything
[22:20] that's negative that is not of the word
[22:24] of God it is not Christ speaking it is
[22:29] Antichrist
[22:30] hello the Bible said let your
[22:33] conversation be yeah yay and they name
[22:38] hi something like the Satan always got
[22:42] something going on and you have to be
[22:44] careful in this message right because if
[22:48] you watch these greater preachers they
[22:50] always have some kind of revelation to
[22:53] enlighten you and every time they bring
[22:56] something great it's not about Jesus
[22:59] Christ it's about what Christ has done
[23:03] for them you understand me
[23:06] they take it to a place where they want
[23:09] you to give them some acknowledgment
[23:12] they put themselves in a place till you
[23:15] be they become a lord and you become the
[23:19] follower
[23:20] of these leaders you don't think they
[23:24] literally in their enlightenment they
[23:27] they know how to seduce the church bring
[23:31] them to a place a man well where there
[23:34] they become the man that's worshipped
[23:36] instead of Christ himself and remember I
[23:40] read that quote to you brother Branham
[23:41] said in Easter seal he said a real true
[23:47] revelation a Mount Transfiguration will
[23:53] only worship Jesus Christ will only
[24:02] glorify Jesus Christ he said not Moses
[24:09] didn't glorify himself he larger than
[24:12] grows by himself he said no minister
[24:16] will glorify themselves the only thing
[24:20] that they're interested in
[24:22] it's Jesus Christ glorified hello
[24:29] is that okay because I'm a drop down and
[24:33] read another quote that brother gave me
[24:36] the other day
[24:37] I don't recall but you know coming from
[24:40] the absolute now in 1963 brother Ella
[24:45] preached the message absolute and when
[24:48] we say absolute that means absolute this
[24:52] is the only thing that I'm working with
[24:54] is my absolute people say well the
[24:57] message is my absolute you know what my
[25:00] absolute is Christ see because listen if
[25:05] the message is not living which the
[25:08] message is but it doesn't live until he
[25:11] lives in you hello and the reason why I
[25:18] say that is that God's people will take
[25:21] the traditions of man there take my
[25:24] brother branham did you know what
[25:25] brother told me he liked his state
[25:27] meaning where because that's the way the
[25:29] Prophet would eat here you see
[25:34] it's not an absolute and because he ate
[25:38] his steaks medium rare doesn't mean that
[25:41] I'm gonna eat mine if that's the way
[25:43] people like it go ahead on you know if
[25:46] you want me to put your one for you you
[25:48] know I might be you but my point is
[25:50] people will take things like that they
[25:54] take the traditions of the Prophet
[25:56] somebody said to me the other day our
[25:58] brother Brooks are do you is anything
[26:01] wrong with celebrating Christmas I said
[26:03] listen I said I know brother Branham
[26:05] celebrated Christmas I said I don't know
[26:07] why he did it I said but I cannot do it
[26:11] because my conscience will allow me to
[26:14] there is nothing in me that get excited
[26:17] about Christmas especially when I know
[26:20] it's a lie
[26:24] hallelujah
[26:25] Jesus was born in April
[26:30] absolutely the minute the medium told
[26:32] brother Branham that his birthday was a
[26:36] memorial to the birth of Jesus Christ so
[26:40] they were born on the same day now how
[26:43] can I go and says now my birthday is in
[26:45] January and you're gonna have it in
[26:47] March hear me I'm about truth y'all
[26:54] better hear what I'm saying because I
[26:57] think a lot of people take it too far
[26:59] you know if you're gonna celebrate Jesus
[27:05] Christ's birthday you can do it anytime
[27:06] you want to but he's not in a manger
[27:08] anymore so my point is do it your way I
[27:13] told her I said listen I said I'm not
[27:15] condemning anybody I'm just saying
[27:17] whatever you feel led to do it do it you
[27:19] know I just know i conscious won't allow
[27:22] me to do it right knowing it's you know
[27:26] dealing with Zeus and Jupiter bah bah
[27:32] all bail any help so much oh you too
[27:36] legalistic I will maybe I am all I know
[27:39] is the bride must have herself without
[27:41] spot wrinkle or blemish right see he
[27:45] goes on to me says listen
[27:48] only telling the truth friends don't let
[27:50] it pass by you I'm not claiming I'm
[27:53] nothing I'm your brother don't you pay
[27:56] any attention to the messenger you
[28:00] watched the message don't watch the
[28:03] messenger God will take it from you in
[28:10] other words if you watch the lesson jur
[28:13] God will take the message from you he
[28:20] will share his glory with no body that's
[28:26] right don't watch the messenger watch
[28:30] the message he said if a messenger came
[28:34] to you with a million dollars he said
[28:38] you take the million dollars and you'll
[28:40] forget about the messenger Allah because
[28:46] the the message a million dollars is the
[28:49] message and what we fail to see is that
[28:53] the spirit that's pushing people a man
[28:58] to glorify the messenger and they began
[29:04] to preach the messenger and they think
[29:07] they preaching the message and the
[29:10] message has always been from the book of
[29:14] Acts he's alive Jesus Christ is alive
[29:18] Hebrews 13:8 he's alive
[29:22] anything outside of that become inter
[29:27] brother branham said wants you and I
[29:29] become aware and we are able to discern
[29:32] the two spirits in the framework of the
[29:34] church we will become an invincible is
[29:43] this okay
[29:44] here's another one he says like on Mount
[29:46] Transfiguration all the prophets and
[29:51] everything else is finished all the days
[29:56] of Luther the Methodists the
[30:00] Presbyterians
[30:01] they're all right but this is my beloved
[30:05] son hear you him the word of this hour
[30:09] the hour of the seals when the mysteries
[30:12] back yonder that's been here all these
[30:15] years in them is that great period of
[30:17] time was stricken off the headstone made
[30:20] it hold down so that the Star of David
[30:22] was sold into the play its place and the
[30:26] great Church of the Living God will be
[30:29] raised like the wings of an eagle back
[30:31] out on the into the glory and now in now
[30:35] in our bodies with speaking is here in
[30:40] now in now in how body will with
[30:47] speaking the new tongues and with
[30:49] prophecies and for seeing lay hands on
[30:52] the sick they they recover the word the
[30:56] world dead and all the things of the
[30:58] world will pass from death unto life and
[31:01] we now hold the power hallelujah so he
[31:04] say all of that has passed the emphasis
[31:08] is Christ in you that's where the
[31:14] dynamite supposed to be in the believer
[31:19] hallelujah
[31:27] listen I love it
[31:29] he said they know Dane enough Devils in
[31:31] hell to keep us from doing it
[31:34] hallelujah so the battle is on but the
[31:38] victory has already been won God coming
[31:42] in trying to get us a focus focus back
[31:46] to the place where it started is that
[31:48] right Malik our fall was to come and
[31:52] turn our hearts back to the Pentecostal
[31:55] fathers and what else did they preach
[31:57] Paul said don't come preach and me
[31:59] that's what Paul said Paul said I didn't
[32:02] die for you don't baptized in my name ha
[32:05] ha the very same thing they're doing
[32:07] they tried to do it to Paul too because
[32:11] they don't nothing but one died for you
[32:13] and that's Jesus Christ hallelujah and
[32:17] that's Papa at the same battle with the
[32:22] message of that day that we're having
[32:25] right now people branching off into
[32:28] groups I am of Cephas I'm of Apollo's
[32:32] I'm up this way
[32:34] I'm the thunders and I am the Persian I
[32:37] am the two souls ha nonsense there's
[32:42] only one gospel hallelujah and that
[32:46] gospel ought to be preached Jesus Christ
[32:51] the same yesterday today forever there
[32:54] is no greater drawing card outside of
[32:57] Christ dying for you and no man can give
[33:02] you the Holy Ghost but God God is the
[33:05] author of salvation he is the one that
[33:08] accepts you not that you accepts him he
[33:11] accepts you that's why we can't see the
[33:14] power in the move of God but don't you
[33:16] be concerned be too worried God is
[33:19] beginning to open our eyes that we can
[33:22] see clearer now and you know what you
[33:26] gonna have battles you saw a lord I I'm
[33:28] doing I'm quoting the Prophet I'm doing
[33:31] just what he said but you know what
[33:32] we're getting giving him more glory than
[33:34] we are Jesus Christ he said forget about
[33:38] me he even said that in his shoes forget
[33:41] about me he even told us not to
[33:43] interpret the thunders and all that
[33:46] don't entirely interpret it will
[33:48] interpret itself that's might as well
[33:49] say tenant preachers going to interpret
[33:51] interpret it because that's what they
[33:53] tried to do and what has it brought us
[33:57] Lord division hallelujah is
[34:01] it's okay he said there ain't enough
[34:04] Devils in hell to keep us from doing it
[34:06] we were for Dean of God for this hour
[34:09] the Word of God manifests itself through
[34:12] us and we will live in the presence of
[34:15] God by the word promised of God
[34:19] Enid Evelyn Hale can keep me from
[34:21] raising in a door he can shut in my face
[34:24] at this morning the seals have been
[34:27] broken hallelujah I'm free I'm free what
[34:37] we need to do is get you know we need to
[34:39] really pray Lord let the promise of the
[34:42] word be fulfilled in me you can't tell
[34:45] me it's not the time because even Daniel
[34:48] all of them wrote at the time and Ezra
[34:51] and everybody knew that this is the time
[34:53] but somebody had to take the initiative
[34:56] to move forward
[34:59] hallelujah I was thinking about this
[35:02] this morning uh say here Indonesia none
[35:04] had this volcano erupting over there and
[35:06] then had another tsunami and over 200
[35:09] people are two hundred people and more
[35:10] they said they haven't found the rest of
[35:12] them yet hallelujah and I'm thinking all
[35:16] these earthquakes are shipping all the
[35:17] earth is shifting people why is it is
[35:20] shifting fog to bring to pass thus saith
[35:23] the Lord
[35:24] California will sink that's why it's
[35:29] moving you know the world can't get too
[35:32] much uh uh yeah it can get I won't say
[35:35] it can't buck off you know twenty years
[35:37] ago we thought it could never get this
[35:39] bad but you know it the Bible is right
[35:42] evil seduces watchwords
[35:44] it's not gonna get any better and do you
[35:47] think God gonna judge that little poor
[35:49] place called Indonesia and not come by
[35:51] America
[35:52] he ain't gonna just charge as America
[35:55] he's are judging the whole world because
[35:57] when she goes everything shifts Oh help
[36:07] us Jesus that's how late in the evening
[36:09] we are not only me but every man woman
[36:11] boy or girl sitting here that's been
[36:14] filled
[36:15] in the spirit of God is a new creature
[36:17] in Christ and you are an eco like this
[36:21] morning like the other day I preached
[36:22] veil behind the blood was what was
[36:26] behind the blood it was God God veil
[36:30] hallelujah and God behind the veil
[36:33] he always was God he will always be God
[36:37] so when we pray in the name of Jesus
[36:40] Christ we lay hands on the sick we are
[36:42] applying God if you can believe it we
[36:46] are applying God will not everybody
[36:50] never launching represents the Holy
[36:51] Spirit and we are applying God God never
[36:56] fails but he works by faith hallelujah
[37:01] if you can believe that you can receive
[37:04] did you know that God uses us according
[37:08] to the man of God he uses us we are his
[37:11] eyes
[37:12] we are his head we are his feet we are
[37:15] his body we are working according to his
[37:18] inspiration
[37:20] that's all theologian our Sun land
[37:23] like I said they take that that quote
[37:26] you know the Holy Ghost without
[37:30] sensation and leave it there and then
[37:31] kill the people everybody sitting up in
[37:34] church D it ain't funny but it's true
[37:36] dad and they didn't they left that part
[37:41] off about the about the the person of
[37:43] Jesus Christ they left that off ah yes
[37:47] it's always been to it that way but when
[37:50] it's real you can see the person hello
[37:54] when the Holy Ghost has been if he's in
[37:57] you you are going to see the real person
[38:00] of Jesus Christ living in you you become
[38:04] God in flesh that right but we just
[38:08] don't throw our power anywhere we wait
[38:12] hallelujah why because the bride knows
[38:16] what to do with the word she knows that
[38:19] the word is her headship hallelujah
[38:21] so she waits on him and when he tells
[38:24] her to rule she
[38:25] moves she is a woman of faith what do
[38:32] you mean because faith is a revelation
[38:34] God reveals to her just what to do and
[38:38] she'll do it thank God good whoo we are
[38:48] live and enjoy the resurrection

[39:07] to you Oh mon Dieu I'm telling you and
[39:10] he's always perfect perfectly pitched
[39:12] hallelujah and sometime I join in with
[39:15] it is that ride nearer my God to Dior

[39:22] in all of a sudden a song come nearer ah
[39:25] how great are I saying with him

[39:52] recognizing enjoy Jesus enjoying your
[39:55] Holy Ghost cuz so many people go down

[40:06] for system the system can't comfort me
[40:10] hallelujah you know what the system
[40:12] brings us to slavery don't do this and
[40:17] don't do that touch not this in touch
[40:19] not that that's not our salvation our
[40:23] salvation produces the works it is that
[40:29] right it produces that like any tree as
[40:33] an apple tree it produces the apples
[40:35] hallelujah you gotta understand in
[40:38] the light in us that produces the works
[40:43] that's right Jesus said when I see my
[40:46] father work I work here the two because
[40:52] he's alive we are live also
[40:55] and he's living us making us alive and
[41:01] the spirit that raised him from the dead
[41:04] dwell it in our be shall quicken our
[41:08] mortal bodies at that great eternal
[41:13] Easter glory to God who is he trying to
[41:18] tell us that we're gonna have us at
[41:20] Easter a day of resurrection hallelujah
[41:24] there's coming a rapture don't let go
[41:31] God become an intellectual because he
[41:34] wasn't even born one and he nothing
[41:37] wrong with being intelligent hallelujah
[41:40] but Paul said I had to forget it all to
[41:43] understand Christ to know him I counted
[41:46] as dog hallelujah and one thing about
[41:48] Paul he says listen I want you to know I
[41:51] want to know him in the power of his
[41:54] resurrection I want to know him in his
[41:56] suffering Paul was not afraid of
[41:59] suffering and a real Christian is not
[42:02] afraid of suffering hallelujah why
[42:07] because we know the battle has already
[42:10] been fought we know that this whenever
[42:13] we go through a battle hallelujah we are
[42:16] the ones that's coming out real good is
[42:20] that right so that you're alone that
[42:24] will we talk about the Antichrist it
[42:28] literally takes you it's so subtle it's
[42:32] so subtle and that's why what people
[42:34] didn't understand whenever you branch
[42:36] off and you name your section the
[42:39] section of your branch you are now a
[42:41] denomination and God is no longer there
[42:45] because Paul said is God divided
[42:52] I'm Perugia I'm Thunder I'm this I'm
[42:55] that no I'm the word sometimes I don't
[42:58] even like saying I'm message he because
[43:02] I've been born of the word I am of God
[43:06] right there was a time when when there
[43:10] was a thing that went out just in a few
[43:12] sir well you know God sent a prophet
[43:14] that had its space but what people did
[43:17] they got stuck there God sent a prophet
[43:21] that was not the end of the story that
[43:23] was not the end of the plan
[43:26] it moved from God sent a prophet to
[43:29] Jesus Christ is here right hello
[43:33] somebody
[43:33] John said behold the lamb of God this
[43:38] message that the Prophet brought was
[43:42] directing us and pointing us to Jesus
[43:46] Christ there is no other gospel and I'm
[43:51] gonna tell you something you know where
[43:52] you're gonna get your fight among us
[43:56] your enemy is of your household
[43:59] just like Cain was in that household
[44:03] hello that's where that's where that
[44:07] because people don't think you
[44:08] blaspheming brother you shouldn't say
[44:10] that like that I said you know what one
[44:13] time I was in I was in up there in
[44:16] Michigan preacher that Samuel Johnson
[44:20] and I was preaching the type how the
[44:23] first people that came out with Moses
[44:25] died in the wilderness yeah you know
[44:30] they they were with Moses it's all Moses
[44:32] eat bread they they saw Moses whatever
[44:35] he was doing saw him go up the mountain
[44:37] all that you know the mean and yet they
[44:40] died a brother a brother you've gotta be
[44:44] careful you called a blaspheme I said
[44:46] blaspheme I said that's a sure type that
[44:50] is a real type look at the condition and
[44:55] God through the prophet I said there
[44:57] will come a spiritual bride you can't be
[45:01] a spiritual bride without the Holy Ghost
[45:02] that means they're coming somebody of
[45:05] people that's going to come back to the
[45:08] Holy Ghost because that is the message
[45:12] hallelujah you can't make a rapture
[45:14] without the Holy Ghost call it and I
[45:18] know I know why he called it the token
[45:20] now I know why he calls it the token
[45:24] because you know people you know I got
[45:26] the whole ego cuz I spoken up but he
[45:28] called it the token because that token
[45:31] is the life literal life of Christ in
[45:34] you it goes down to the soul huh and it
[45:40] doesn't matter I said Lord just so
[45:42] ignorant man like me orbs slow to learn
[45:45] and all of these things how I'm going to
[45:47] ever learn all these deep things these
[45:49] preachers be bringing going all into the
[45:51] Old Testament and typed out what a cup
[45:53] it with a cup and they can do it and I
[45:57] think Lord how can i huh you don't give
[45:59] it to me like that so you know my point
[46:02] is that means I'm gonna miss it now Paul
[46:06] said you can understand all mysteries
[46:09] you can have faith to move mountains you
[46:12] can give all that you have to feed to
[46:15] the poor what was he saying religion
[46:18] religion it's not gonna be something
[46:21] special maybe with religion can do
[46:24] million things but there are those who
[46:27] are elected in chosen of God ah oh
[46:34] who may not understand all the mysteries
[46:38] but one thing for certain they got ahold
[46:41] of Jesus and Jesus got ahold of them but
[46:46] they make you feel stupid people try to
[46:49] make you feel stupid they got their
[46:51] little cliques in their own clans and if
[46:53] you don't belong to this and belong to
[46:55] that you're not deep enough you're not
[46:56] you're not up in the high echelon people
[47:02] I know what I'm talking about
[47:03] and let me tell you something people it
[47:05] doesn't matter what they say is that
[47:09] right there was a rancher who needed a
[47:12] wife for his son and they were all
[47:16] partying and all nee all he looked cute
[47:19] dresses and whatever more right and the
[47:23] rancher said son says I don't want that
[47:25] kind me too brother

[48:23] and everything else they could find to
[48:26] make music
[48:27] raggedy voices they didn't care about
[48:31] that stuff they were interested in
[48:33] glorifying God and seeing the Shekinah
[48:35] glory come down but now we are
[48:38] Antichrist is moving in that thing so
[48:41] slowly we are performing entertainers
[48:47] and God is not moving now hear me

[50:30] books you're gonna get in trouble I
[50:31] don't care people need to realize Amen
[50:34] that something is going wrong and this
[50:37] message is ordained to produce what it
[50:40] said is going to produce it's nothing
[50:42] wrong with the message it's we is what
[50:45] has happened to us we've allowed that
[50:48] little smooth character to come in and
[50:51] dignify the church and we're not
[50:53] supposed to be dignified we're supposed
[50:55] to be a bloody mess huh people can't
[51:01] even get the Holy Ghost cuz we ain't hot
[51:03] enough and we think it's okay is not
[51:07] okay if the rooster don't come in and
[51:13] work with those eggs they'll never hatch
[51:19] okay how many we get in here we need God
[51:23] to come in and touch some lives I don't
[51:27] believe that the all on my hands okay
[51:30] seriously let me go on let me come back
[51:32] now here sits down to make it real clear
[51:35] everybody we thoroughly understand that
[51:39] I believe that divine healing is nothing
[51:42] that any individual on earth can do for
[51:45] you
[51:46] Oh somebody help me here it's Antichrist
[51:50] when you think is you its Christ Jesus
[51:57] never healed nobody it always was the
[52:00] spirit God I can't do nothing except my
[52:04] father
[52:05] show me divine healer ain't no such
[52:10] thing
[52:11] the only divine heal is one and that's
[52:14] Jesus Christ hallelujah see the effect
[52:19] of the atonement of the blood of Jesus
[52:21] Christ at Calvary see what I'm saying
[52:23] divine healing is nothing that any
[52:25] individual in this earth can do I
[52:27] believe that is the effect of the
[52:30] atonement of the blood of Jesus Christ
[52:32] is Calvary I don't believe that any oil
[52:35] out of my hands would heal anybody you
[52:38] say I'm trying to tell you that's
[52:40] Antichrist even though people don't see
[52:42] it that way just that little thing is
[52:44] Antichrist if you're launching somebody
[52:47] with all and expect to all to heal him
[52:49] you are in in the inspiration of the
[52:51] anti I don't believe it has anything to
[52:58] do with it and I believe if I claim so I
[53:02] would be absolutely Anti Christ actually
[53:05] says taken away from Christ if there's
[53:08] any virtue in the oil for my head or
[53:11] anybody else had or from anything else
[53:15] that come for me is taking away from cry
[53:18] Calvary and it'll be Antichrist against
[53:21] Christ
[53:23] hey I do not believe that there's any
[53:27] power in the men a man to heal another
[53:31] man I believe that the only thing that
[53:33] any man can do rightfully now of course
[53:36] we have people that believe that they
[53:39] they have such things but I don't see
[53:41] how Protestant people could condemn the
[53:43] catholic old holy water then if you if
[53:47] you could go for such as that see but
[53:51] there that was really good one
[53:55] hallelujah but where there is isms
[53:58] remember friends it's only a
[54:00] kind of a real genuine healing of God oh
[54:08] yeah hey second John for 311 I told you
[54:17] won't be long
[54:18] I rejoice greatly that I found of that
[54:21] children walking in truth as we have
[54:25] received a commandment from the father
[54:27] and now I beseech thee lady not as
[54:31] though I wrote a new commandment what
[54:34] the Bible says if they say he's in a
[54:35] desert don't go see why because that's
[54:42] Antichrist if he's over here or over
[54:45] there he's done don't go
[54:46] I now beseech thee lady not as though I
[54:51] wrote a new commandment unto thee but
[54:53] that which had from the beginning that
[54:56] we love one another and this is love
[54:58] that we walk after his commandment
[55:00] this is the commandment that as you have
[55:03] heard from the gate beginning you should
[55:05] walk in it for many deceivers are
[55:08] entered into the world who confess not
[55:10] that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh
[55:12] this is a deceiver and an antichrist see
[55:16] so I was telling a brother he said
[55:17] brother books he says I wouldn't know
[55:19] whether I got the Holy Ghost I said fog
[55:21] let me say it like this brother there's
[55:23] something hollering in you I said you
[55:25] were either thirsting for the Holy Ghost
[55:27] or you got the Holy Ghost and want more
[55:29] of it I said because now I said let me
[55:32] ask you a question I said do you love
[55:34] God he said yes I said well where did
[55:36] that love come from and what is it
[55:39] that's God in you hello
[55:44] that's God in you so how did he get in
[55:47] there outside of a birth something took
[55:52] place and what you need to say brother
[55:56] but I just said listen if you want to
[55:58] pray just ask God to give you a shout
[56:00] and a dance and that's what you want but
[56:04] don't ask him for the Holy Ghost cuz he
[56:05] didn't you brother you got it
[56:11] everybody wanna feel this and feel that
[56:13] we're asking for the jump in the shout
[56:15] because if you living a life that Christ
[56:18] can only live that is the holy gold
[56:25] you've changed you turn from life unto
[56:28] death that is the Holy Ghost you say Oh
[56:38] what do me I said what brother you must
[56:39] understand the Holy Ghost must mature
[56:42] you must mature into Holy Ghost right
[56:44] brother Brennan say excuse me Paul said
[56:46] grow up into him but when you confess
[56:50] the law with your mouth and believe in
[56:52] your heart that you are saved that's
[56:55] when the seed is quickened if there is a
[56:57] seed is Quicken right there you become
[57:00] impregnated that's not a birth yet it is
[57:05] a quickening it is a life beginning you
[57:08] understand me but the real birth comes
[57:11] by water blood and spirit when that
[57:14] woman comes and she pushes you through
[57:16] that channel of birth or that depth
[57:18] Channel so that's what it is
[57:21] hallelujah and you go where that is your
[57:25] birth that's when you become a real baby
[57:29] you don't have to depend on mama no more
[57:31] from that standpoint right whoo if
[57:39] people could just see God's Word is
[57:41] perfect you come from justification to
[57:45] sanctification and all of those things
[57:47] are absolutely the Holy Ghost moving in
[57:50] you
[57:52] Allu yuh justification in his life
[57:56] justification sanctification in the
[57:58] baptism the Holy Ghost thank God for a
[58:01] prophet that came and says and yes that
[58:03] ain't the end the Holy goes to baptism
[58:06] the Holy Ghost is just enough fire to
[58:08] bring to burn everything out of you so
[58:10] Christ Himself when the Lord struck that
[58:12] thing I said oh do y'all realize this
[58:16] you personally get the fullness of
[58:18] Christ my bottle
[58:22] whoo get fool you hear them saying the
[58:27] early church changes couldn't get all of
[58:29] that not all those virtues were in
[58:34] Christ Jesus divine nature and here the
[58:39] Bride of Christ come to a place she she
[58:42] comes to a full maturity to have Christ
[58:45] in her as an individual I don't know
[58:52] whether you see it like I see it but you
[58:54] know what amen the Bible said in him
[58:57] dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[58:59] and in the bride of Jesus Christ dwells
[59:02] the fullness of the Godhead bodily that
[59:04] is a quote see the devil is trying his
[59:14] best to keep us from reaching the goal
[59:16] but he no matter what he does he cannot
[59:19] stop us okay Antichrist beard oh no the
[59:24] bride is already designed to know the
[59:26] difference I used to say to my people
[59:30] I used to say why is that brother we
[59:32] used to we used to battle all the time
[59:34] about all the time all no Holy Ghost not
[59:36] our brother don't even believe the
[59:38] message he's out there in Florida
[59:39] preaching a Trinitarian doctrine and he
[59:42] was one of the greater preachers on this
[59:43] message I don't think no I heard anybody
[59:45] that can lay it out like he did with an
[59:48] anointing whoo but we used to always he
[59:52] was another under that floors and of
[59:54] perugia and he and I would always battle
[59:56] brother you ain't got to go through all
[59:57] I said well all I know is that brother
[59:59] Branham preached several messages God
[1:00:01] provided way and he never changed
[1:00:04] he said you a baby knows how to get what
[1:00:07] he wants by way of crying whoo he say
[1:00:10] you ring a bell and it ain't gonna work
[1:00:12] cause that ain't God's design you won't
[1:00:16] you really won't it just like I told the
[1:00:18] brothers this morning I say you won't
[1:00:20] the Holy Ghost I'll tell you what you
[1:00:22] start at the beginning you confess the
[1:00:24] Lord confess your sins and let the Holy
[1:00:26] Ghost bring all the things that you need
[1:00:28] to be sanctified oh and when you come to
[1:00:31] that place that something's going to
[1:00:32] happen right because nobody
[1:00:36] anybody couldn't go beyond the veil
[1:00:37] right that was only given to the high
[1:00:40] priest and I didn't realize what was
[1:00:42] happening to me because that happened to
[1:00:44] me once or twice I was praying
[1:00:47] travailing before the God before the
[1:00:49] Lord all of a sudden of fear King and
[1:00:52] Satan said if you go any father you're
[1:00:54] gonna lose your mind didn't know what I
[1:00:57] did I would backed up and you know what
[1:01:00] God revealed to me is that I didn't
[1:01:02] trust him you gotta trust God the devil
[1:01:06] will be there to frighten you he would
[1:01:08] try his best to keep you from that place
[1:01:13] but you gotta trust God and then God
[1:01:15] brought to me my attention he said now
[1:01:17] if you ask for our bread dude I will
[1:01:21] never give you a serpent see cuz the
[1:01:24] devil make you think if I go this far a
[1:01:26] devil own kitchen is no devil gonna get
[1:01:28] you the Holy Ghost is waiting behind
[1:01:30] there oh is that right it's the true
[1:01:36] sister sisters know who had children you
[1:01:39] come to that place you feel like you're
[1:01:40] gonna lose your mind and that's exactly
[1:01:44] when the devil stay put the doctors they
[1:01:46] push that's the truth and they studies
[1:01:52] in a caterer
[1:01:53] he said push and that's what the Holy
[1:01:56] Ghost is trying to tell you push if you
[1:01:59] want to say push I say press keep on
[1:02:02] pressing lujah for many deceivers are
[1:02:07] entered into the world who confess not
[1:02:09] that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh
[1:02:11] he said this is a deceiver and an
[1:02:13] antichrist look to yourselves that we
[1:02:16] lose not those things which we have
[1:02:19] wrought but we see before reward
[1:02:21] whosoever transgresseth and abideth not
[1:02:24] in the doctrine of Christ have not God
[1:02:28] in the doctrine of what Christ's Holy
[1:02:33] Ghost gospel Holy Ghost doctrine right
[1:02:37] the Pentecostals went off on it because
[1:02:39] they tried to make everybody speak in
[1:02:41] tongues and that's all they got
[1:02:44] hallelujah but now that we got the
[1:02:47] message we got the real word of
[1:02:49] cause we know that that veil that
[1:02:52] entrance into the Holies of Holies has
[1:02:55] been made plain to us because Peter said
[1:02:58] of you these things abide in you you
[1:03:00] will never be barren nor unfruitful
[1:03:02] neither will you fall hallelujah and you
[1:03:07] and I need to be pressing we need to be
[1:03:09] seeking God amen as often as we can
[1:03:11] because listen if this thing that's
[1:03:13] coming to me is correct let me leave it
[1:03:19] but I'm gonna tell you something it's
[1:03:20] later than what most people think later
[1:03:24] than most people think when I told the
[1:03:27] people down there and say huh
[1:03:28] some of y'all ain't even sanctified and
[1:03:30] you think you're a virgin hello that's
[1:03:33] the enemy that's the Antichrist just
[1:03:34] told you that huh because the power of
[1:03:39] the blood will sanctify you he too is
[1:03:44] the power of you trying to tell me that
[1:03:46] the power who is God cannot sink to fire
[1:03:49] you that is a life-changing force it
[1:03:55] will train you if you let it
[1:03:58] Alleluia but you know what the problem
[1:04:01] is we so don't want the washing we don't
[1:04:05] we you know you don't like to hurt I
[1:04:07] hurt let me tell you something this is a
[1:04:10] painful way Institute it's a painful way
[1:04:16] there is no way you gonna make heaven
[1:04:18] without pain give me the pain let it be
[1:04:23] now because at some point in time in
[1:04:25] your cycle you going to experience pain
[1:04:29] right if you don't experience it in this
[1:04:32] world you will experience it in the
[1:04:33] underworld
[1:04:37] so suffer now curdle up the mind put up
[1:04:41] your clothes take your cross right and
[1:04:44] cross it's pain
[1:04:45] it's sacrificed like the brother said
[1:04:47] every sacrifice brain pain if I had a
[1:04:51] million dollars you ask me for ten
[1:04:53] dollars it won't hurt me none but if I
[1:04:57] had a million and you ask for a million
[1:04:59] and God told me to give you the million
[1:05:01] that's a different story
[1:05:03] it becomes a sacrifice yummy so you and
[1:05:11] I must understand listen don't let the
[1:05:14] Antichrist Antichrist spirit as a funny
[1:05:16] thing here to come right in here and
[1:05:18] cause you to be all starchy and you
[1:05:19] think you okay you walked right in the
[1:05:22] presence of the Lord and didn't even
[1:05:23] worship him you didn't even say thank
[1:05:25] you Jesus hallelujah whatever and you
[1:05:28] walk right out here and didn't know that
[1:05:30] you was under the influence of an anti
[1:05:32] demon a devil I call them no worship
[1:05:35] devils right well sometime I know we
[1:05:38] come in here and we are tired but that's
[1:05:40] alright when you tie it at home and you
[1:05:43] want to eat what do you do you like oh
[1:05:46] I'm so tired but I'm going to eat I'm
[1:05:48] gonna eat brother if I may not cook me
[1:05:51] no big old dinner but I'm gonna get me a
[1:05:52] sandwich or some sort right you gonna
[1:05:56] eat something

[1:06:03] kool-aid right it was not very seldom
[1:06:07] you that tired now for those who like
[1:06:10] kool-aid I don't drink kool-aid but for
[1:06:11] those who like kool-aid you gonna fix
[1:06:13] you something that's gonna go with the
[1:06:15] sandwich and that's just the way it is
[1:06:19] when you really want God you you do you
[1:06:24] bring forth this sacrifice I love it the
[1:06:27] way that brother saying I'm closing he
[1:06:29] said if you want God he's gonna he's
[1:06:32] gonna inconvenience you hmm
[1:06:38] now you know God could have made it easy
[1:06:40] for that woman with the issue of blood
[1:06:41] and don't you know he you know God could
[1:06:45] have said you know I'm gonna make a
[1:06:46] pathway for you and all you got to do is
[1:06:48] go straight for him but she had to press
[1:06:50] through the crowd God could have made it
[1:06:53] easy amen
[1:06:55] for the woman at Simon's house but she
[1:07:00] had to press through the crowd and
[1:07:03] that's the way it is went guarding will
[1:07:06] make it easy it's a prophet of God said
[1:07:09] God ain't gonna just pull you through
[1:07:11] some - you gotta work at it
[1:07:14] he Co told Joshua I'm giving
[1:07:16] the whole land but you gotta fight for
[1:07:19] every inch holiness comes with the price
[1:07:23] segregation comes with the price oh this
[1:07:27] flesh wanna do the flesh wanna do and
[1:07:30] you say you ain't no net and don't you
[1:07:32] know when you resist it it becomes
[1:07:35] easier and after a while the devil
[1:07:39] leaves you ah because the devil want to
[1:07:45] be seen here you're standing alcoholic
[1:07:48] alcoholic don't continue to drink if a
[1:07:53] minister I ain't smoking no more that
[1:07:55] devil ain't gonna stay there he's going
[1:07:57] to leave eventually because he wants to
[1:08:01] be seen y'all know them cigarette demons
[1:08:03] won't be seen right all out in the cold
[1:08:11] mr. truth
[1:08:13] demons they know you don't like them and
[1:08:16] some car pulled right up to you and the
[1:08:20] cigarette oh come right out of the car
[1:08:22] and come into yours y'all had it Oh many
[1:08:25] times
[1:08:26] or they come to the muffles whatever
[1:08:29] that sucks it right on in there but you
[1:08:35] see you got to understand that God is on
[1:08:37] your side if God be for you no one can
[1:08:41] be against you and I'm gonna tell you
[1:08:44] this and I'm closing so many times
[1:08:46] throughout my ministry I've gone to
[1:08:49] churches and they put such a pressure on
[1:08:51] you that you gotta say brother branham
[1:08:53] brother branham brother branham and if
[1:08:55] you don't say brother branham you're not
[1:08:56] preaching the message i've been there
[1:08:58] and now i realize what it is that is not
[1:09:05] jesus just tryin to make you say brother
[1:09:08] branham when he says forget about the
[1:09:10] messenger hello there are times you say
[1:09:14] his name only because there are times
[1:09:17] you talk about Exeter's you go say moses
[1:09:19] but it's not all through the sermon and
[1:09:23] you don't get Jesus and the Bible said
[1:09:25] that the Lord's name is jealous hello
[1:09:29] and he ain't gonna have no other
[1:09:30] God before him he is share his glory
[1:09:33] with no one be and you gotta be even
[1:09:36] careful how people preach on the bride
[1:09:38] because it will produce pride if it's
[1:09:43] not taken through the heart of a good
[1:09:46] filtered heart with the Holy Spirit
[1:09:50] people exalt the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:09:53] like she made herself I think that's
[1:09:55] what vast I thought hallelujah
[1:10:00] and you go to these churches they act
[1:10:02] just like pastor they already in their
[1:10:05] older girlish commune and having a
[1:10:08] little fellowship and when they come in
[1:10:10] the church they don't do nothing they
[1:10:11] don't show nothing before the king
[1:10:13] that's their what is that that's the
[1:10:16] spirit of Antichrist we don't know how
[1:10:19] good we have it because the devil is
[1:10:22] wanting us to deter he want us to take
[1:10:24] that glory and put it on something else
[1:10:27] even if you take the message and think
[1:10:29] the message is to think mrs. Church save
[1:10:33] you that's anti-crime there's only one
[1:10:37] saving grace and that's the blood of
[1:10:39] Jesus Christ can't be nothing else can't
[1:10:44] be nothing else you love the Lord let's
[1:10:46] have a word of Prayer father we thank
