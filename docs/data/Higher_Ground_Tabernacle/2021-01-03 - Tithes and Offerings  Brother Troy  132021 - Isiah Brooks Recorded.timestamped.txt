[44:34] still in their sins amen let's uh
[44:39] let's just stand and honor the word of
[44:40] the lord
[44:44] start with uh open up first corinthians
[45:00] late night service i don't want to say
[45:02] recover necessarily
[45:05] maybe your body let's put it that way as
[45:06] your body
[45:10] i know we slept pretty late all weekend
[45:13] long so
[45:15] but man we had a glorious time i enjoyed
[45:18] it thoroughly
[45:19] every bit of it it wasn't a long service
[45:24] to me
[45:27] five hours and yet it was just seemed
[45:29] like a city
[45:43] but this morning i want to speak on uh
[45:46] tithes
[45:46] and offerings
[45:50] i know this is we've preached this in
[45:52] times past
[45:55] history
[45:59] but uh we're going to just go through
[46:03] a lot of scriptures this morning
[46:07] i don't want you to get war out on me
[46:10] so let's just put our mind in order to
[46:13] enjoy the scriptures
[46:20] now we'll start with first corinthians
[46:22] chapter four
[46:24] seventh verse it says
[46:28] for who maketh thee to differ from
[46:31] another
[46:32] or and what hast thou that thou does not
[46:35] receive
[46:37] now if thou didst receive it why does
[46:40] thou
[46:41] glory if thou has not received it
[46:54] constituting
[46:58] verse 8 and says now you are full
[47:01] now you are rich you have reigned as
[47:04] kings without us
[47:05] and i would to god that you did reign
[47:08] that we also might reign with you
[47:10] fourth go ahead brother okay
[47:21] [Music]
[47:23] for so think that god hath set us the
[47:26] apostles last
[47:28] as it were appointed to death for we are
[47:30] made a spectacle
[47:32] unto the earth and to angels and to men
[47:47] we are fools for christ's sake but you
[47:49] are wise in christ
[47:51] we are weak but you are strong ye are
[47:54] honorable but we are despised
[48:04] foreign
[48:06] now let's turn over to the book of
[48:07] genesis chapter 12.
[48:11] what do you have that you didn't first
[48:13] receive
[48:15] if you've received something where it is
[48:29] and the lord had said unto abram get
[48:32] thee out of thy country and from thy
[48:34] kindred
[48:34] and from thy father's house unto a land
[48:37] that i will show thee
[48:46] and i'll make of thee a great nation and
[48:49] i will bless thee
[48:50] i might make thy name great and thou
[48:53] shalt be a blessing
[49:00] and i will bless them that bless thee
[49:03] and i can curse him that curseth thee
[49:05] and in thee shall all the families of
[49:07] the earth be blessed
[49:15] and so abraham departed as the lord had
[49:17] spoken unto him and lot went with him
[49:19] and abram was
[49:20] 75 years old when he departed out of
[49:23] haram
[49:24] abram
[49:28] abraham
[49:40] give our blessing unto you
[49:53] and in honor of that promised lord
[50:23] surrender our lives
[50:29] in the name of jesus christ
[50:32] amen amen amen
[50:40] abraham hello abraham we all know the
[50:42] story
[50:45] was minding his own business
[50:48] this is affair and then something
[50:50] happened to him
[50:52] i'm so glad that it did it just seems
[50:54] good i'm glad something happened to me
[50:58] what happened is that god called him
[51:04] everybody that has that experience where
[51:06] god
[51:21] and go to a place that i will show you
[51:25] and abraham was faithful to the word
[51:28] that god spoke to him
[51:31] left his father's inheritance behind
[51:36] [Music]
[51:47] that they leave an inheritance to their
[51:50] sons
[51:52] and that inheritance of abraham's father
[51:55] terror and abraham would have gone on
[51:59] down to his son abraham
[52:02] if
[52:09] but seeing that he was revealed unto him
[52:13] a greater inheritance
[52:17] it was revealed unto him that there was
[52:19] a prom
[52:20] a land of promises
[52:24] and the revelation was so great and so
[52:26] strong
[52:28] he joyfully gave up the inheritance of
[52:31] his natural father
[52:36] that god showed him
[52:39] instead of receiving an inheritance of
[52:41] his natural father
[52:50] and in abraham all the nations of the
[52:53] world were blessed
[52:56] one time abraham was in the tent
[53:00] and god said come outside i want to show
[53:03] you something
[53:05] and he said abraham look up into the sky
[53:09] look at all those stars up there
[53:12] i want you
[53:27] as many as the stars are in the heavens
[53:31] so will your children be
[53:34] abraham i have made you a great nation
[53:38] you're a great inheritance
[53:54] you have not given
[53:57] and god said to abraham i
[54:01] will give you a son
[54:05] and abraham being old stricken in age
[54:36] now my grandma is now 92 years old
[54:40] grandpa is going to turn 90 here in a
[54:42] couple months
[54:44] they're not in condition to have any
[54:46] children
[54:49] i know that they're not
[54:52] and yeah abraham here being a hundred
[54:55] years old
[54:56] abraham was holding on to a promise that
[54:58] he was going to have a child
[55:01] and god honored his promises
[55:09] become children of abraham when they
[55:12] have that same faith that abraham has
[55:15] lost for we are blessed
[55:21] [Music]
[55:29] [Music]
[55:45] with milk and honey
[55:58] we become the sons and daughters of
[56:00] abraham
[56:03] and just like abraham when he walked
[56:05] into the promised land
[56:10] looking for a city whose builder maker
[56:12] was god
[56:41] abraham has such faith was so
[56:44] great i called god down from out of
[56:48] heaven
[56:51] or in abraham met the mayor of that city
[57:06] [Music]
[57:36] everywhere you go this land is yours
[57:46] and abraham knowing that all the land
[57:48] was his abrahams
[57:51] his nephew lot
[57:55] wanted a place to take his own family
[58:00] and so he told lot
[58:03] what really had his eye upon this place
[58:06] down and it's called sodom
[58:08] lott
[58:12] now sodom was in a valley sodom
[58:15] valley blessed with a lot of water beni
[58:20] had a lot of place for their animals and
[58:22] their crops
[58:27] but this place was wicked
[58:31] there was just a spirit that dwelled in
[58:33] that earth
[58:36] and so but that civilization down there
[58:39] caught lot's eye
[58:44] now that was part of abraham's
[58:48] inheritance
[59:01] you know the whole world is my
[59:02] inheritance
[59:06] the meek will inherit the earth
[59:11] um
[59:15] but i sure don't have any desire to go
[59:17] live in las vegas
[59:18] this is the living room they call it the
[59:20] city of sin
[59:23] uh someday that'll be my inheritance
[59:29] i think i'm just gonna leave it sit tell
[59:31] the judgment
[59:34] and that was the same thing with abraham
[59:37] let's saw them sit till the judgment
[59:39] yeah how good it was
[59:42] no matter how well watered it was
[59:58] um
[1:00:09] unto him he had the spirit of christ
[1:00:10] upon him
[1:00:29] looked up to abraham it says i offer you
[1:00:31] everything
[1:00:33] oh my riches my gold medal i'll give it
[1:00:36] to you
[1:00:37] for saving our lives
[1:00:41] abraham looked at the king of sodom
[1:00:46] said i will not take anything from you
[1:00:51] even button or a shoelace
[1:00:56] [Music]
[1:00:59] because i don't want you to at any time
[1:01:01] be able to say that you are the one that
[1:01:03] made abraham rich
[1:01:08] look at the riches
[1:01:20] and my life but belongs unto
[1:01:50] of a sudden we are tempted to give and
[1:01:53] compromise
[1:01:56] but then abraham faith rises up inside
[1:01:59] of us
[1:02:02] and says i am not going to give in it is
[1:02:06] me i am going to lift my hand to jehovah
[1:02:09] man i know i can make my life easier by
[1:02:12] giving in to this temptation

[1:02:50] offered unto abraham all these things
[1:02:55] abraham to the king of sodom and abraham
[1:03:01] and abraham said unto the king of sodom

[1:05:04] lumia if we're gonna testify that we
[1:05:07] know
[1:05:08] we know jehovah
[1:05:12] the presence of the lord we ought to
[1:05:15] also know jehovah jiren
[1:05:20] we've left
[1:05:47] what do you have that you did not first
[1:05:49] receive from god
[1:05:52] everything we have came from god we
[1:05:55] surrendered our lives to the lord jesus
[1:06:02] christ
[1:07:27] melchizedek was so great
[1:07:32] abraham that caused abraham to pay his
[1:07:40] tithe
[1:07:49] see if i can just find a scripture here
[1:07:57] wrong verse oh here it is uh
[1:08:00] genesis chapter 14.
[1:08:05] verse 17 mercy said
[1:08:11] well we'll go we'll read verse 18 there
[1:08:15] and melchizedek the king of salem
[1:08:19] had no father
[1:08:35] and he was the priest of the most high
[1:08:37] god
[1:08:39] and he blessed him and said blessed be
[1:08:43] abraham of the most high god possessor
[1:08:45] of the heaven and earth
[1:08:50] and he blessed the most high god
[1:08:52] [Music]
[1:08:54] and blessed be the most high god which
[1:08:57] hath delivered thine enemies into thy
[1:08:59] hands
[1:09:03] and he gave him tithes of
[1:09:18] in abraham's life
[1:09:25] that because he had given up everything
[1:09:28] to choose god had given him an
[1:09:30] inheritance that was so great
[1:09:32] julia
[1:09:50] amen amen now that
[1:09:53] is an ordinance that god sat down on all
[1:09:56] throughout history
[1:09:58] uh uh
[1:10:03] let's uh i just want to go through
[1:10:06] the the law here in the book of numbers
[1:10:13] chapter 18. peter
[1:10:20] now we're going forward a couple hundred
[1:10:22] years to the time of moses
[1:10:26] and this revelation of abraham
[1:10:32] is now being put into allah
[1:10:44] numbers chapter 18 verse 20.
[1:10:52] now here it's talking about the levites
[1:10:57] now the levites were
[1:11:01] a chosen people
[1:11:06] and even though all the tribes of
[1:11:11] tribute israel were
[1:11:13] [Music]
[1:11:15] by by being children of abraham on it
[1:11:20] had rights to the inheritance of the
[1:11:24] land
[1:11:41] because of who they were acoustic
[1:11:43] security
[1:11:46] and being given land
[1:11:49] back then
[1:11:53] was in their minds
[1:11:57] similar to being given a way we think of
[1:11:59] being given salvation today
[1:12:05] because a jew would only be blessed if
[1:12:07] they were in the land
[1:12:11] and owning land part of the inheritance
[1:12:15] was a special thing to the jews
[1:12:32] [Music]
[1:12:34] forever and every 50 years there would
[1:12:38] be a jubilee of freedom
[1:12:42] and the land would go back to those that
[1:12:44] had lost it
[1:12:49] but even though all the children of
[1:12:51] abraham were due
[1:12:52] a land mmc
[1:12:57] god took a part of the children of
[1:13:00] abraham
[1:13:02] party the
[1:13:15] we're told you cannot inherit
[1:13:31] and the lord spake unto aaron
[1:13:35] thou shall have no inheritance
[1:13:38] in their land
[1:13:42] that's a strong statement see um
[1:13:54] that used to belong to your father
[1:13:58] abraham
[1:14:17] you're not going to have any inheritance
[1:14:18] in this land
[1:14:22] but you know he gave it up willingly
[1:14:26] why did he
[1:14:33] [Music]
[1:14:39] and the lord spake unto aaron thou shall
[1:14:41] have no
[1:14:42] inheritance in their land
[1:14:46] neither shalt thou have any part among
[1:14:48] them for
[1:14:49] i am thy part and thy inheritance among
[1:14:52] the children of israel
[1:15:00] and behold i have given the children of
[1:15:02] levi all the tenth in
[1:15:04] israel for an inheritance judan
[1:15:07] composition office
[1:15:09] on israel for their service which they
[1:15:12] serve
[1:15:14] even the service of the tabernacle of
[1:15:16] the congregation
[1:15:23] amen so amen
[1:15:26] let's go down to the uh 23rd verse
[1:15:31] but the levites shall do the service of
[1:15:33] the tabernacle of the congregation
[1:15:35] they leave it foreign
[1:15:46] it shall be a statute forever throughout
[1:15:48] your generations
[1:15:50] that among the children of israel they
[1:15:52] shall have no inheritance
[1:16:00] but the tithes of the children of israel
[1:16:02] which they
[1:16:03] offer as a heave offering unto the lord
[1:16:06] i have given to the levites to inherit
[1:16:08] therefore i have said unto them among
[1:16:10] the children of israel
[1:16:12] they shall have no inheritance
[1:16:31] is that when you look at how that is
[1:16:33] worded
[1:16:38] who gave the levites their inheritance
[1:16:46] what
[1:17:03] because god has already given your ties
[1:17:06] to the priesthood as an inheritance
[1:17:13] and if you do not pay your tithe
[1:17:21] because god gave that to you as a
[1:17:24] blessing
[1:17:26] but it was supposed to pass through you
[1:17:41] he also went into the military
[1:17:46] he went into the air force
[1:17:49] and had a right to develop that career
[1:17:55] he gave that upon at a young age
[1:18:01] to serve the lord
[1:18:04] to dedicate his life to the preaching of
[1:18:07] the gospel
[1:18:10] and through brother isaiah's ministry
[1:18:15] many in this message have been blessed
[1:18:19] and in honor of that of that dedication
[1:18:24] of leaving the things of the world
[1:18:26] behind on abandon
[1:18:28] to serve christ in the ministry
[1:18:32] god has given brother isaiah an
[1:18:34] inheritance
[1:18:37] and that inheritance is your tithing
[1:18:42] now god has already given your tithing
[1:18:44] to brother isaiah
[1:18:48] isaiah when you do not pay your tithes
[1:18:53] you are taking something that god loaned
[1:18:55] to you
[1:18:56] but was supposed to keep passing through
[1:18:58] to the ministry
[1:19:02] [Music]
[1:19:05] and you are robbing god by holding it to
[1:19:07] yourself
[1:19:12] and you can be judged
[1:19:17] now let's let's keep going to uh
[1:19:19] deuteronomy
[1:19:20] hello
[1:19:27] the next book over
[1:19:39] now i'm going to read several verses
[1:19:48] here
[1:19:55] and these are the statutes and judgments
[1:19:57] which he shall observe to do
[1:19:58] in the land which the lord god of thy
[1:20:00] fathers
[1:20:01] giveth thee to possess it all the days
[1:20:04] you shall live upon the earth
[1:20:16] you shall utterly destroy all the places
[1:20:19] wherein the nations which he shall
[1:20:20] possess
[1:20:21] serve their gods upon the high mountains
[1:20:23] upon the hills and under every green
[1:20:25] tree
[1:20:30] um
[1:20:36] you shall overthrow their altars break
[1:20:39] their pillars
[1:20:40] burn their groves with fire you shall
[1:20:42] hew down the graven images of their gods
[1:20:45] and destroy the names of them
[1:20:47] out of that place
[1:20:59] you shall not do so unto the lord your
[1:21:01] god.
[1:21:05] now this is the statutes of this land
[1:21:07] that they're going to
[1:21:08] sound when you go into the land to
[1:21:12] inherit it
[1:21:30] [Music]
[1:21:40] destroy every name of the false gods
[1:21:43] from the land
[1:21:45] uh chuck knows because you shall not
[1:21:49] serve the lord your god like that
[1:22:19] and that altar is an altar of
[1:22:21] deliverance is
[1:22:36] have no right to serve at that uh eat of
[1:22:39] that altar
[1:22:41] all right of the delivery
[1:22:48] the children's bread see le pen's
[1:23:05] let's keep going continue
[1:23:08] verse 5. but unto the place which the
[1:23:13] lord your god shall choose of all your
[1:23:15] tribes
[1:23:16] to put his name there even into the his
[1:23:19] habitation
[1:23:20] shall you seek and sither thou shalt
[1:23:23] come
[1:23:32] now here even though god has given them
[1:23:34] a land and inheritance
[1:23:39] he's telling him here that you know
[1:23:42] you're not gonna just serve god
[1:23:44] everywhere
[1:24:00] and that's where you're going to come
[1:24:04] verse 6 you're going to leave your house
[1:24:08] go to god's house
[1:24:12] verse 6 and further you shall bring
[1:24:16] your burnt offerings and your sacrifices
[1:24:18] and your ties and your heave offerings
[1:24:20] of your hand and of your vows
[1:24:22] and of your free will offerings and the
[1:24:24] first thing of your herds and your
[1:24:25] flocks
[1:24:27] select for
[1:24:38] and there you shall eat before the lord
[1:24:40] your god
[1:24:41] and you shall rejoice in all that you
[1:24:43] put your hand unto you and your
[1:24:45] households
[1:24:46] wherein the lord thy god hath blessed
[1:24:48] thee
[1:24:52] [Music]
[1:24:57] now verse six and verse seven there are
[1:24:59] no
[1:25:00] the first two words of each verse
[1:25:04] and feather and there
[1:25:11] and there it's somewhere you're going
[1:25:13] you're going somewhere
[1:25:17] and when you get there you're going to
[1:25:18] rejoice
[1:25:21] i hope this is starting to sound
[1:25:22] familiar to your family
[1:25:38] foreign
[1:25:49] now
[1:25:53] let's go down to verse 10.
[1:25:57] and when you go over jordan and dwell in
[1:25:59] the land which the lord thy god giveth
[1:26:01] you
[1:26:02] to inherit and when he giveth you rest
[1:26:04] from your enemies round about so that
[1:26:06] you dwell
[1:26:06] safely then there shall be a place
[1:26:10] which the lord your god shall choose to
[1:26:13] cause his name to dwell there
[1:26:15] further yet shall you bring all that i
[1:26:17] command you your burnt offerings your
[1:26:20] sacrifices your tithes and your heave
[1:26:21] offerings of your hand
[1:26:22] and all your choice vows which you shall
[1:26:25] bow into the lord
[1:26:34] approved
[1:26:52] verse 12 and you shall rejoice before
[1:26:54] the lord your god
[1:26:56] you and your sons and your daughters and
[1:26:58] your men servants
[1:26:59] and your maidservants and the levite
[1:27:01] that is within your gates
[1:27:03] for as much as he hath no part nor
[1:27:05] inheritance with you
[1:27:07] right
[1:27:17] and here a guy is instituting a pattern
[1:27:19] is he institute
[1:27:21] that the households would leave their
[1:27:25] houses
[1:27:27] and they would go to a place
[1:27:30] where the revelation of the name of
[1:27:32] jehovah went out
[1:27:35] and that's where they would bring their
[1:27:36] ties and their offerings
[1:27:40] and there they would rejoice in all the
[1:27:43] blessings that god had given them
[1:27:47] it's beginning to sound like church to
[1:27:48] me
[1:27:55] now verse 13
[1:27:58] take heed to thyself
[1:28:05] be careful obey this
[1:28:09] you see take heed to thyself that thou
[1:28:12] offer not thy burnt offerings
[1:28:14] in every place that thou seest
[1:28:20] don't just bring your ties and offerings
[1:28:22] anywhere well brother so-and-so needs
[1:28:23] some help so i'm going to give my
[1:28:24] tithing over here or
[1:28:26] send me
[1:28:30] [Music]
[1:28:41] and rejoice before the lord and that's
[1:28:44] where the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:28:46] is revealed to you through the preaching
[1:28:48] of the gospel
[1:28:52] then that's where you should bring your
[1:28:53] tithes in your office
[1:29:18] in the place that god shall choose
[1:29:29] now he's bringing in some ordinances
[1:29:31] about the tithing
[1:29:36] thou mayest not eat within thy gates
[1:29:41] the tithe of thy corn or thy wine or thy
[1:29:44] oil or the first things of thy hurts or
[1:29:46] thy flock
[1:29:47] or any of thy vows which thou valest nor
[1:29:50] thy free will offerings
[1:29:51] or heave offering of thine hands
[1:29:57] [Music]
[1:30:04] accomplished
[1:30:06] but thou must eat them before the lord
[1:30:10] thy god
[1:30:12] in the place the lord thy god shall
[1:30:14] choose
[1:30:15] thou and thy son and thy daughter and
[1:30:17] thy man's servant and my maidservant
[1:30:19] and the levite that is within thy gates
[1:30:21] and thou shalt rejoice before the lord
[1:30:24] thy god
[1:30:25] and all that thou put us thy hands unto
[1:30:28] me
[1:30:32] tonight
[1:30:46] take be careful
[1:30:52] take heed to thyself that thou forsake
[1:30:55] not the levite
[1:30:56] as long as thou livest upon the earth
[1:31:04] now god has given the tithes and the
[1:31:07] offerings to this church
[1:31:12] the tithing goes to the ministry
[1:31:56] um
[1:32:11] shows so that we have a nice place
[1:32:15] that is honorable to the lord
[1:32:17] comfortable
[1:32:20] and by having a healthy offering
[1:32:24] um
[1:32:39] has been here long enough
[1:32:42] you remember the time we rented a
[1:32:46] place for a church
[1:32:52] and poligis the landlord wouldn't turn
[1:32:55] on the heat for us
[1:33:00] because you remember
[1:33:03] winner progressed we had one service
[1:33:20] we left that place behind this is it we
[1:33:23] came to this place
[1:33:25] it costs quite a bit more
[1:33:29] but for the most part the offerings
[1:33:31] cover
[1:33:34] now the last three months we have been
[1:33:37] short on our offerings
[1:33:42] and at the end of the month we haven't
[1:33:43] had enough to pay our bills
[1:33:48] not to be like that he shouldn't be
[1:33:50] paying for concealer we shouldn't have
[1:33:51] to shuffle to
[1:33:53] bring things around
[1:33:58] i'm just communicating this so that
[1:34:00] everybody knows where we're at
[1:34:02] is
[1:34:15] [Music]
[1:34:16] and all the ties ought to come in
[1:34:19] totally
[1:34:21] now the tie the word tithing
[1:34:25] means
[1:34:30] it's 10 percent of the increase
[1:34:35] that god has given you if god has
[1:34:39] given you something whether it's a
[1:34:42] paycheck
[1:34:43] it's just a shake
[1:34:56] if you have left the world behind
[1:35:00] and have clung unto the lord jesus
[1:35:01] christ
[1:35:04] of christ and christ has revealed
[1:35:06] himself to you
[1:35:08] like melchizedek revealed himself to
[1:35:12] abraham
[1:35:28] and that revelation caused abraham to
[1:35:30] pay his time
[1:35:33] amen thou shalt not forsake the levite
[1:35:37] as long as thou livest upon the earth
[1:35:50] ephesians chapter four
[1:36:17] ephesians chapter four verse eight
[1:36:19] episode
[1:36:22] wherefore he saith when he ascended up
[1:36:25] on high
[1:36:26] he led captivity captive i'm glad he did
[1:36:30] it
[1:36:35] he led captivity captive and gave gifts
[1:36:38] on demand
[1:36:42] god's given us some gifts i'm glad he
[1:36:46] did
[1:36:46] it i need those gifts
[1:36:55] there's times when i listen to brother
[1:36:57] isaiah preach it yeah
[1:37:01] just sit back there in awe
[1:37:18] that was the holy spirit speaking
[1:37:20] directly to me
[1:37:24] through a gift and i need that
[1:37:29] hey man amen i respect that should
[1:37:31] respect you
[1:37:36] amen he led captivity captive and gave
[1:37:40] gifts
[1:37:44] now let's go around to verse 11. hello
[1:37:59] and some pastors and teachers doctor
[1:38:04] these are gifts that god gave unto men
[1:38:10] and they are a blessing to the church
[1:38:14] now why did god give these gifts to the
[1:38:16] church
[1:38:19] verse 12 tells us
[1:38:23] it's for the perfecting of the saints
[1:38:27] for the work of the ministry for the
[1:38:30] minister
[1:38:30] and for the edifying of the body of
[1:38:32] christ
[1:38:33] you call the christ and these gifts
[1:38:37] the men that have these gifts
[1:38:42] the right way
[1:38:45] the proper thing to do
[1:38:48] it's for them to leave the things of the
[1:38:50] world behind
[1:38:51] see he lets the shoes demand and to
[1:38:54] dedicate themselves to the preaching of
[1:38:56] the word of god
[1:39:01] you remember in the book of acts
[1:39:04] where they said there they told the the
[1:39:07] congregation
[1:39:10] it's not right for us
[1:39:13] to leave the word of god
[1:39:17] and go wipe off the tables yeah it's
[1:39:19] really taboo
[1:39:26] and i can imagine what it was like there
[1:39:29] at
[1:39:30] the early church in the book of acts
[1:39:37] act god jesus jesus christ said just to
[1:39:40] send it up on high
[1:39:41] jesus they washed him as sending up and
[1:39:45] a cloud covered him from out of their
[1:39:46] view
[1:39:49] [Music]
[1:39:52] angels came by and says why are you
[1:39:53] staring there enough
[1:39:56] you'll come back the same way
[1:40:00] let's go and do everything that he told
[1:40:02] you to do
[1:40:05] and they went
[1:40:18] the holy ghost began to fall on them
[1:40:40] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:40:42] jesus christ
[1:40:45] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:41:16] jesus christ is still alive jesus christ
[1:41:19] the kingdom of heaven has come elohim
[1:41:22] and the powers of heaven have been given
[1:41:24] unto the men
[1:41:28] signs and wonders like there is only
[1:41:29] scene without
[1:41:38] some of them were left us
[1:41:42] you imagine what it was like as a young
[1:41:44] minister
[1:41:47] the holy spirit is sinning revelation
[1:41:49] upon revelation
[1:41:52] the old testament is becoming a new book
[1:41:54] to them
[1:41:55] oh here's jesus christ
[1:42:09] but they can't even get their brothers
[1:42:10] and sisters to wait the tables
[1:42:18] and they had to go back and they had to
[1:42:20] look well how do we
[1:42:21] bring these old testament customs
[1:42:57] there ought to be a fervency in the
[1:42:59] church
[1:43:02] even if you're not called to preach the
[1:43:04] gospel
[1:43:06] that there is something that you can do
[1:43:20] to help with the cleaning of the church
[1:43:35] to be a blessing to the church
[1:44:04] this city
[1:44:19] the levites the old testament there's
[1:44:21] going to be a place in your land
[1:44:24] where god shall choose to place his name
[1:44:28] i have two or three of you gather in my
[1:44:32] name
[1:44:44] if you're using your ties and your
[1:44:46] offerings
[1:44:53] [Music]
[1:45:28] foreign
[1:46:25] and if you do not if you withhold that
[1:46:27] tithing
[1:46:30] you are robbing god
[1:46:31] [Music]
[1:46:33] amen amen
[1:46:36] we who say we have the revelation of
[1:46:38] melchizedek
[1:46:42] and say we're the children of abraham
[1:46:45] the faith of abraham abraham took his
[1:46:49] faith
[1:46:50] caught the revelation
[1:46:58] amen
[1:47:07] amen that's the we we get so spiritual
[1:47:10] sometimes
[1:47:13] i think we don't have to do the natural
[1:47:15] things
[1:47:18] but if you could really catch the
[1:47:20] revelation
[1:47:48] the one that you
[1:47:56] [Music]
[1:48:01] away from the things of the world
[1:48:04] we're enjoying the holy ghost land
[1:48:07] amen but all that was preached to us by
[1:48:10] a ministry
[1:48:12] supported by your tithes
[1:48:49] to reveal unto us how we should be in
[1:48:51] these last days
[1:48:54] so we could be the bride of christ
[1:48:57] as much as we love malachi 4 5 and 6.
[1:49:04] love malachi 3 8 and 11.
[1:49:08] amen amen malachi chapter 3 verse 8.
[1:49:26] if how is it possible that a man could
[1:49:29] rob god
[1:49:33] could one of us right now go up to
[1:49:34] heaven and take one of the
[1:49:36] golden stones
[1:49:40] after
[1:49:51] [Music]
[1:49:54] well we can rob god in one way
[1:49:59] is that god gave your tithes as an
[1:50:01] inheritance to the ministry
[1:50:06] of minister it comes from god
[1:50:10] [Music]
[1:50:23] god placed himself at weakness
[1:50:28] placed himself at your mercy plus
[1:50:32] record and that he promised something to
[1:50:34] the ministry
[1:50:35] either
[1:50:50] will a man rob god and i'm prompted
[1:50:54] yet you have robbed me but you say
[1:50:58] wherein have we robbed thee
[1:51:02] in tithes and offerings
[1:51:06] you are cursed with a curse for you have
[1:51:08] robbed me even this entire nation
[1:51:15] bringing all the ties into the
[1:51:18] storehouse
[1:51:21] that there might be meat in my house and
[1:51:23] prove me now herewith saith the lord of
[1:51:25] hosts
[1:51:26] if i will not open up the windows of
[1:51:28] heaven and pour you out
[1:51:30] a blessing that there shall not be room
[1:51:32] enough
[1:52:09] and he shall not destroy the fruits of
[1:52:11] your ground
[1:52:14] foreign
[1:52:27] for you shall be a delightsome land
[1:52:29] saith the lord of hosts
[1:52:33] a delightsome land what
[1:52:37] multiple things here yeah
[1:52:41] you see one the ties and offerings were
[1:52:43] brought in
[1:52:47] so there was a beautiful temple
[1:52:50] beautiful tabernacle a healthy ministry
[1:52:55] that is focused on the word of god
[1:53:03] and not only that the people have been
[1:53:04] healed
[1:53:07] by the preaching of the gospel
[1:53:18] and the guests don't have to worry about
[1:53:19] going and getting a part-time job
[1:53:21] somewhere
[1:53:24] on
[1:53:27] because god's people have been obedient
[1:53:29] that's because you broke the dread they
[1:53:31] will be yourself
[1:53:32] and offerings
[1:53:35] so you can be a delight some land
[1:53:38] because
[1:53:44] [Music]
[1:53:49] and cannot deny that what god has done
[1:53:52] to this truth
[1:54:06] rebuke the devourer for your sake
[1:54:11] verse 11.
[1:54:15] yo peter said be sober
[1:54:20] be vigilant
[1:54:48] but if you bring your tithes and your
[1:54:50] offerings in
[1:54:54] god will rebuke that devourer um
[1:55:13] through the preaching of the gospels
[1:55:36] he said god called me as an evangelist
[1:55:40] evangelist he said brother perry greene
[1:55:43] told me
[1:55:45] no one in the message will support
[1:55:47] evangelists
[1:55:52] if you want to eat you got to become a
[1:55:53] pastor
[1:55:58] that's a shame it is a shame
[1:56:02] i've seen the evidence
[1:56:05] as we talk about the five-fold ministry
[1:56:08] you see
[1:56:10] the the the
[1:56:24] or maybe one and a half
[1:56:29] because they'll give honor to their
[1:56:31] pastor
[1:56:34] evangelists they'll give a little bit of
[1:56:36] honor too
[1:56:39] if her brother is tries to preach and he
[1:56:41] isn't loud enough
[1:56:46] they'll say you're just a teacher
[1:56:52] and they'll despise the teachers
[1:57:08] and if anybody said they're an apostle
[1:57:12] paul they'd say he's taking being
[1:57:14] denominational
[1:57:21] maybe i shouldn't be that way those were
[1:57:24] my opinions
[1:57:30] we ought to give honor to the ministry
[1:57:34] they are the gifts that god has given us
[1:57:36] it's only donkey
[1:57:38] knee and the bible says he gave them to
[1:57:41] us for our own perfectionism
[1:57:49] every single one of us
[1:57:58] [Music]
[1:58:03] and we need to be changed
[1:58:11] when the holy spirit begins to move over
[1:58:14] the preaching of the gospels
[1:58:29] but the bulk of that happens mate
[1:58:38] [Music]
[1:58:59] in the blessings of the lord that god
[1:59:01] has given us
[1:59:03] the gift of a pastor that god has given
[1:59:05] us
[1:59:08] amen in a nice place
[1:59:12] that could be a lot nicer keep
[1:59:24] [Music]
[1:59:27] but we struggle just to pay the monthly
[1:59:41] because there wasn't enough offerings to
[1:59:43] support it
[1:59:46] but from the sound booth
[1:59:49] the chairs you're sitting in just oh
[1:59:51] there's
[1:59:52] a camera in the stands to the musical
[1:59:55] instruments
[1:59:56] the instrument
[2:00:10] because there was not enough offerings
[2:00:14] i've had brothers asked for
[2:00:16] reimbursement on things
[2:00:20] you don't know how to reimburse them
[2:00:59] [Music]

[2:01:18] all wheel is accused this year
