TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I'll try by God's grace to finish the message we started this morning we talked about faith come by hearing and we talked about the prayers of Jesus being answered if anybody can get a prayer through I believe the Lord has gotten a prayer through as we stand we're just going to read Romans 5 and 9 and then we'll read Romans 8:30 which offered me your scriptures glad to see our brothers up I was just telling the church this morning I was gonna have to hire a musician from down there I don't know how it's gonna work with God but I thought man they got more than enough so we'll see how the Lord works amen I don't know whether that's possible or not but you know we we'd love to see him come up whenever they do Romans five and nine so that we'll understand that we are saved by his life not by yours by his life it's his life we are to make manifests Romans 5:9 says but much but much more than being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life and not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by who we have now received the atonement Romans 8 and 30 we'll read all the way down to the 33rd verse moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say then to these things if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall we not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay in a charge or anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justify it let us pray father God we come before you we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord God we pray that you give us grace to move completely out of your way and we pray father that you break and destroy the yoke to the enemy anoint your service server tonight anoint the ears and hearts of those who have come to receive that when the word of God comes Lord will be able to bring forth the manifestation of a hundredfold in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated when we talk about a hundredfold some time we get a little discouraged because your hundredfold might be a thirty your hundredfold might be a sixty he said he gives some 30 some 60 and some 100 but whatever it is is that it's your full potential those whoever he's ordained to bring forth or 30 that's all you're gonna be able to bring forth and those who are deign to bring forth 60 that's all you'll be able to bring forth and those who God ordained to bring forth a hundred will but should I get jealous over 30 or 60 or if I'm a third should I get jealous of a sixty or a hundred no it's all I'm supposed to bring forth you and I ought to be thankful by God's grace that God has called us to this marvelous light we read in Jeremiah this morning I'm just gonna recap a little bit God said he hadn't expected in for us and he wanted us to know Amen that if we seek Him and seek him he said you and I will find him when we should search for him with all of our hearts and so I believe with all of my heart that God has placed that in us I said this morning that we are the call of God in other words God called us we didn't call God God chose us we didn't choose God so therefore God makes no mistakes when it's called with his call he makes no mistake it was so funny this morning in mind with the interpreter I I thought I had a French speaking interpreter and I thought about you speaking Swahili and I was wondering why some of the rich people were looking all strange and I had no idea but I thank God a man somebody got something this morning but by the grace of God Amen we made it through this morning and I trust by God's grace that God will anoint us we talked about the rejection we said by God's grace that Jesus Christ has provided a way for us we know it has always been Satan's tool to invent something beside the way of God and to get people to believe in it and we showed by God's grace that there's only one provided way as it was in the book of Genesis Cain and Abel made a sacrifice unto the Lord Abel's sacrifice was accepted because it was God's provided way and we showed that Cain built a system he watched Abel and no doubt he thought that Abel's sacrifice was a disgusting one Amen nobody likes to shout and cry and scream and holla and praise God anymore they figured that it's just not necessary but that is God's chosen way that the people of God will enjoy his presence and they would empty out and forget about themselves and came this in disgust thought he could build a system that God would accept but outside of Jesus Christ there is no other way to be saved jesus himself declared that I am the way the truth and the life if any man coming to me he hid come unto me he must first come by me I am the door is that right we showed by God's grace that what the problem he is with the people of God today is that we have these barriers of unbelief and I show by God's grace house sham God who was a judge of his time Amen slew over six hundred Philistine men with an ox gored a stick that you normally punches the ox in them and to make it go forward and he took that out scored and he literally destroyed six hundred Philistines that took faith and you and I must understand that we're not here to live off of our own faith there is a mental faith there's a faith that you're born with it comes with the territory but there is a supernatural faith and that's why the Bible said the just shall live by his faith you and I will fail every time because we as as as creatures of time we always have our ups and our downs but faith in God if God's faith is steady his steadfast is what we call the Shekinah glory it is his faith and sham God amen in the Old Testament was able enough to have faith in God see the Bible said he that cometh to God must first believed that he is God and that he has a reward of them that diligently you and I are being tested by faith hello Sumati and Brennan said faith and love are twins if you have faith you have love if you have love you have faith amen because you got to realize they are all in the same seed love is in the seed of God faith is in the seed of God but it takes watering it takes thing in the presence of the Sun in order for these virtues in order for this character amen to push his way out of you is that right the probably God said if we drink and drink and drink and drink he said the Holy Ghost will push out push out push out push out that's right is nothing we do the only thing we do is drinking it in you understand me all you do is stay in the presence of God and you will crow it ain't is ands or buts about it the reason why we don't grow or mature the way we should be maturing is because we failed to stay in the presence of God in the presence of God God the by said is fullness of joy is that right and at his right hand is pleasures forevermore so when you are in the presence of God you do not get bored oh I didn't finish like I wanted to finish this morning but hopefully I'll be able to see to do it this evening I'm gonna read this quote by God's grace coming from the message amen God's Commission commissioning Moses this is important I didn't read it all but I'll try my best to go through it you see God is good to us isn't he hmm let me back it up here sorry I read the wrong quote I was reading the wrong cool move further down you love the Lord here it is I ended up with it so we make mistakes but you mustn't look at that it's not your mistakes because you're always going to have them Superman I can say like that because we don't have no sisters tonight but we feel we feel like because of our mistakes when I'm not maturing about you you're mistaken the only man that did not make a mistake was Christ himself Paul made a mistake that right all um did all of them did but it wasn't the mistakes but you see it's because you're always going to have him but you see it's following his rules following what he said do stumble and falling doesn't have one thing to do with it a great true servant if he stumble if he gets he'll get up again if he wobbles God pulls him right back in the path as long as he's in the path of duty but if he's off the path of duty God's not obligated to him but as long as he's in the path of duty God is obligated to him knowing that he's just a man or woman he's obligated to that person as long as they're in the path of duty and that's what it is sometimes we think God don't know that we're flesh and blood he's the one that made you now the church is engaged to Christ for the wedding the wedding has never been performed yet it will be at the wedding supper of the Lamb so we see that the church is now engaged like a man engaged to his wife what does he do while they're engaged he's just be storing all kinds of things sending her presence making her feel good well that's what Christ is doing to his church he's sending us gifts of the Spirit how could we be engaged the and when you when you're denying these gifts exist it's the very love tokens is God's token to the church jesus said so these signs shall follow them that believe now keep those things in mind the church must believe every word every promise every I order and claim it for themselves and exercise themselves in it you know what exercise it means when certain things come your way you work it you work with it you push your faith hallelujah amen exercise you know you're doing push-ups they're not easy hallelujah but you're working on something to build more muscles that right that's how it is with God when trials comes and tests come you work it you keep saying I am more than a conquerer hallelujah through clothes is that right he's made me thus this this stone will not be victorious over me hallelujah it will not get the victory imma keep pressing I'm gonna keep moving that's exercising why because God is with me get you will imagine if Sam God kills 600 men do you ever think he got tired oh yes he did he had to but every moment he that Tod feeling come on here come the Holy Ghost the anointing of God was on him so much amen he didn't have time to feel tired but no doubt that was there he's a physical man you understand how many times you and I have been under the anointing and they're nodding it's so heavy on you you keep pushing you keep pushing now the moment a moment of split moment of tiredness come on you but that anointing is so great it keeps you moving hmm now Church is engaged to Christ for the wedding let me drop down alright so now those things in mind keep them in mind the church must believe every word every promise every high order claim it for themselves and exercise themselves in it if I was engaged to a girl and I was a single man I sent her some things an engagement ring and she wouldn't wear it then that shows she doesn't believe me she doesn't want to be my bride and if guys says it's Church the gifts that he promised and they refused him and say they're not so they don't want to be the Bride of Christ y'all understand me they I spouse to some other lover and not the Christ the bridegroom so the real church keep the promise and keeps all and accept the gifts that God sends them now you say what do you mean I'm saying cutting through all the unbelief we have people Amen in this message who said we don't need that anymore we are beyond that now but how can you be a lot beyond that if that's what God sent you 5 identification of a true church you must every church must have gifts in there y'all understand me we could never be beyond because when Rebecca met Isaac she wore everything Isaac sent to her and in order for us to meet Christ we must have every stone every stone in that in that that help headband hallelujah if one stone is missing we will be labeled as a prostitute so we would say I'm trying to tell you it's not what the preachers say is what the Prophet says so you can understand if the preacher is preaching the world that's not agreeable to what he said you don't believe the preacher you believe what he said you understand me if I preach something that's not agreeable with the word of the hour today you have no you do not have to receive it why because you I'm not the interpreter God has sent us the interpreter I'm just trying to resound what he sounded Lord of God it got good now the first human being he said listen now so we keep that in mind and the church says his gifts and God says his gift and empty doesn't that means she's exposed to some other lover now the first human being fellowship themselves from being a scuse me this fellowship themselves from believing God by believing his word and listening to a lie of the devil now that's the first thing that this fellowship his wonderful Union out of an e in a position to never not never die in a position to never be old to never be sick to never have a worry you said I sure wish I could be like that he said I Got News for you you're in that same position God places that to every creature on earth in the same position you understand me so we can't go back and said well I wish they would have done it better no you wouldn't have done it no better than they did why because it was all a plan of God now as sinners we have a choice we that we make to be either remain a sinner or a saint is that all right we have a sure foundation as I said this morning faith is not feeling oh I just feel it you don't feel faith faith is a dimensional thing that goes down to the soul and in the soul is either faith or unbelief hallelujah if you're waiting to feel it you don't have it why because faith is a substance faith is just as real as this tambourine I can explain this but faith cannot be explained you got it you don't know how I got it but you got it and the Bible tells that that faith is a gift so when God gives you this gift hold on to it it doesn't matter if no one else believe you know you got it y'all hear me like I said this morning when God calls you nobody can hear that call for you I don't care everybody standing next to you when God calls you only you can hear the call and therefore because you can hear the call you respond hmm think about it we here we are the bride of Jesus Christ we've got more power we got more authority and we got more assurity than any age ever we look like it's Samson and we say what a great man of God well you are in a greater position than Samson huh but the Bible tells me that Sampson with the jaw jawbone of an ass through a thousand Philistines hallelujah and in shâm god only slew 600 but the Bible tells us that one man one converted man one true soldier of God who can put a thousand to flight hey we look at men at the demons that were loosed out of the river Euphrates amen under under the world wall-to-wall excuse me and and we say oh my God look at all these demons but think about it you can put ten thousands of light so really they're not as great as they think they are think about it you said what do you mean let's take for example wormwood one wood is one angel but one would had the authority and the ability to cause the ant alluvion flood one angel through the world into chaos hello is that right he did it he moved the scientists in a way that they did it but it was wormwood the spirit behind the ant eluvian flood think about it brother madam said when Jesus was on the cross all he had to do was move one finger one finger and it would have been over now the same power in Jesus is now in us but it takes faith to cut through all of this unbelief and you said oh the unbelievers in the world know we have intellectual Giants in this message that have took taken away the very power and the authority of the world away from us in such a subtle way they tell us when we mature we don't need God in that way yet when we get sick many of them are running to the hospital many of them are seeking out doctors hello and I ain't God I don't have anything against doctors but show me in the New Testament where they ran to the doctors oh you know what they did they prayed when Peter James and John were thrown into prison what did they do they pray they didn't even go get a lawyer hallelujah they prayed and God answered their prayer he's the same yesterday today and forever holiday but we've got to get rid of his reasoning we got to get rid of all this dust there's darkness that saved in his place among us we've got to get back to the original the just shall live by his faith like I said it's not your faith you living by is his faith and his fate is the Holy Ghost his faith is God because by faith see we look at by faith like it's a thing no no no but faith is a person in the beginning God created hallelujah so by faith faith itself is a person and that person is Jesus Christ I'm not talking about the stuff you're born with at the first I'm calm at the second birth brings about a supernatural faith because it is God and we must work with it we got to exercise it that's why God let these storms come upon us he don't want us to give up sometimes you lose you you might fall you might stumble but you get back up why because it's in you to whip the devil is in you to defeat Satan God will not be satisfied till he see you defeat the devil you're his sons daughters whoever he will not be satisfied until he see you if he's Satan how did Jesus tell was tested after 40 days of fasting here the devil comes hallelujah he did signs and wonders amen afterwards but what was he to do he first had to defeat the devil before he could go anywhere else ah and how did he defeat the devil not with his feelings not with his emotions he defeated the devil with his word hallelujah he could have said be God and the begone and the devil would have vanish but he said with his words he spoke the word remember I told you the bride must be combative you must combat you must fight onward Christian soldiers marching as to war with the cross of Jesus going on before you must fight back God didn't put us in this age to fall down and faint and give up he put us in this age because he knew the bride would put the devil under his feet her feet amen that's where we are we have a sure foundation our foundation is in God it's in Christ is that right Paul said I have laid the foundation and there said no man ever lay another foundation because there is no other foundation outside of Jesus Christ you and I must build our house upon that rock hallelujah Jesus Christ himself he's the same yesterday today and forever that's what brother Branham did he sure did his foundation wasn't built on the Baptist Church nor was it about been built on the Pentecostal church it was built upon Jesus Christ being the same yesterday today and forever that means I can count on him anytime hallelujah that's why he said the bride of Jesus Christ can defeat the devil anywhere any place any time it doesn't matter where he pops up you have the ability to defeat him because if God is living in you he's not fighting you he's fighting the God that's in you and the God that's in you spells out victory but he don't want you to know that that's why that's why you know job was going through those situations and here God put him through the DES and I said to you this morning said get up from there girdle up throw mine that's what's wrong with us tighten up this mind of yours wrap it up and tangle it up in the Word of God right going up be a man stand up he said no I'm saying fight get out there to know that God is behind you is that right the Bible said the angel of the lord encamps about them that fear him not fear his enemy fear God you reverence God and God will respect you hallelujah there's not a man in the world that has ever stood on the Word of God and God let them stay hang there I don't care if they don't even believe this message if they stand on the Word of God God will come because it's his word and God is going to stand his word and he's gonna bring that word to pass if you believe it there's so many people in there that have been delivered and been healed they've been don't know nothing about God's and a prophet but they stood on the word with these stripes we are healed God will defend his word Oh somebody help me here Oh Lord listen hearken unto me according to isaiah 40:8 Oh Jacob and here Oh Jacob and Israel my called I am he I am the first and I am the last so what do we worry about anything else he's the first in the last Oh help us Jesus he said my hand has also laid the foundation of the earth and my right hand has spanned the heavens when I called unto them they stand up together he said everything whenever I call for them they stand up he's there together but because the whole heaven and earth is named after him ain't God good to us oh he said in Isaiah's cry he said what shall I cry he said all flesh is like grass you can I have no confidence in this hey don't you ever think that this thing this thing is gonna stand in the time of trouble better bad dog come your way you can try to be fearless but this flesh is going to quake and shake yeah and if that word is not in your heart as it should be you gonna get scared afraid but when that heart when that word is in you guess what happened it overtakes you it will cast out the fear is that right oh you said brother books I don't know about that brother bear said I was going to go pray pray for that sister he said I jumped that fence and I was cutting across the path for a short cut the next thing I saw was this bull he said I went for my gun what was that that was the man that was the flesh of a prophet is that right I'm sure he didn't probably oh I don't know I don't want to kill him but if he comes my way I just have to pay the man for his boo y'all understand me he said but all of a sudden hey somebody understand me see that faith will produced out a love that that better confused the ball when you believe God he listened is that right I read your quote he said when you are in line or in the duty God is obligated and God was obligated because the Prophet was on his way to to pray for that sister and God was obligated to protect him God is obligated ooh I tell people many times they're many things I don't even know how I came through and how I came out of it but God was there that's right I was giving a testimony not long ago how my wife and I were passing by way of Chicago and the speed y'all know how they go through this view you can hear the whistle amen my wife told me something I moved the wrong way and all I could see was these cars coming at me how on earth we missed each other I don't know how it happened the next thing I know me and my wife was in such a all we couldn't speak for I don't know how long we rode down the road without saying anything because there it should have been a pileup all I can say is him I don't know how they got around me they might have went through me I don't know but I know that was a miracle ha I was in the line of duty I was in the line of duty and God protected his gift Oh somebody help me here so you said what do you mean I'm trying to tell you what we call faith many people call faith his hope and hope will encode will shame you faith is when you got it you don't know how but you know it you know God has healed me you know God has delivered you know God and listen faith don't waver circumstances never makes it waiver faith don't worry faith don't stress out faith says I got it I don't care what it looks like I got it I understand me I got Victor I got it that's why people's are all I got the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost won't let you weigh more like that huh when you got the Holy Ghost you said I don't care what I feel like I don't care how I look like I don't care how many times I make mistakes I got it something makes you know you got it Oh hallelujah Oh remember now the father says the warfare is accomplished it's complete we're just going through the motions we don't already see me into the book do y'all know who won we know who won Hey Oh what are you saying Brooks I don't know all I can tell you is that when John says behold the Lambs why I was there I was in there this Sydney out of over the New Jerusalem I'm part of that she said brothers how do you know I know he battles for me he fought for me he won the victory for me he whipped the hell for me that I might not go there he went there for you I have faith I can believe that I received that and therefore I can't go there you gotta believe you bribed somehow your faith his faith must kick in and tell you you I bribed I used to wake up every morning because the Prophet God said if you don't have the Holy Ghost he said you ought to confess it every day thank you for the Holy Ghost thank you for the Holy Ghost even if you don't feel it thank you for the Holy Ghost and I'm gonna tell you something I used to say thank you Lord for being bride thank you Jesus for being bride I don't know but one day it clicked and no devil can take that from me hello no devil can take from me think the blood of Jesus Christ is powerful enough to save me he is my brother he's more than a walk and he has you think God didn't see all the mistakes I was gonna make after he saved me brother Bentham said even in our peculiar ways God still gave us the Holy Ghost he knew every bit of the things we were gonna do after you get it he do any mistake you were gonna make you heard what I said I read it you go make mistakes you love the Lord the Bible said faith is the substance of things hoped for but the evidence of things not seen for is and you know in the end those in those places we're brothers not these senses that we have we have five senses and a brother was yeah it was wonderful he was giving a testimony because I think you remember brother Samuel brother Samuel was here you said his dad always told him he has six senses and so in while he was in school they had text and the FS on the test how many senses yeah he said I knew I had five he said but my daddy taught me six so I just knew I was gonna be the only one with the right answer he was the only one that failed with O equals six I said the brother you knew you was right right Wow because faith is the sixth sense oh the Prophet couldn't have brought it no greater than that because just as you can see and you can hear and you can speak you know you you know that these senses are real do you got him you don't have to worry about it you got him that's how real faith is you work that sense like your sight like your hearing like your all of those other you work in it's there for you to work it's to exercise it are the new you ask use musicians they got gifts they can play but it didn't come overnight they had to work it they had to condition their hands craps and all they had to push over it stretching trying to reach those keys but now it's just like wow they exercise it because they knew the gift was in a godsend you storms amen in each storm one might be a lion the end the storm might be a bear but don't you forget Goliath is coming and because you whipped the bear and the end and then I lion that means I have the ability to whip the liya God promotes us as we gain ground in faith he promotes you yes you think your test is going to be over after you beat Goliath Oh David was just beginning you know the story he had all things he had to deal with right he the local ayah there's over then God brought it closer to his heart became a brother saw you understand me you might whip the devil on the outside with the world a me but now God don't bring your batter into the church now you got a fight hallelujah oh and you know what David saw that and he says oh my god I cut the non did I cut his garment love forgive me forgive me Lord David had a right he could have killed Saul but he didn't and he repented just by cuz he cut sauce garlic think about it it didn't hurt sauce flesh just his garment and we can't even repent when we hurt somebody's feelings hey is your test is what God putting you through and guess what he knows you can do it stand up Carville your minds be the bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah is that all right you and I must understand him and this warfare is complete that means God has already done it for you and me I was telling the church tonight though you know I don't like mint this morning my English ain't all that good but I trust that you understand it anyway when we come to the word God gave us God gave us a sword we don't have just the sword hmm he gave us the King sword you know what the King sword it is the revelation of this word it's a sharp sword the message that we have will divide you it will cut you up it would divide your flesh from your spirit and your spirit from your soul it will allow you to see where the devil is hiding hello it will divide your faith in your hope and your charity hallelujah it will show you if you've got hope or whether you got thing is that right a man this message is so perfect amen and it's there to operate on you and me let him operate let go and let God have his way you've got to fight your way just ain't no better ease here it is we've gone through tests and trials like it's the worst thing we ever had in our lives and nobody getting their heads cut off hello nobody's going to the guillotine nobody is Amen going in and then let me that like they did in the medieval days rose to people on the fire they snatched babies out of women's bellies and young I mean Christians were tormented for a thousand years tormented and they were tormented why to do what to make sure this gospel kept going we were in their minds because had they failed we would have not been here but because they pushed because they continued because they press through all those obstacles and that just shall live by his faith it was his faith that caused them to run toward the Lions hallelujah it was their faith about said they'd thought nothing of their lives and that's where God wants us to be we must come to a place where we think nothing of our lives then everything about us must be Jesus Christ well I'm not gonna be long just give me a few more moments few more minutes hmm you look at this thing it says all brother books are you sure listen I do not want to be like Matthew says Matthew 15 says the people draw nigh unto me with their mouth and honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me many Christians they come right here everywhere they go they come and and then oh I just oh and their mouth they sound good but then when they by themselves when they're not how well they're living it hmm in vain in vain they do worship me teaching that further doctrines the commandments of men and and I've heard this is so true look how the devil as I said this morning the devil says use the Word of God is off all you got to do is receive the Lord Jesus into your heart and you become a Christian what a lie huh oh all you got to do that they were Peter said if men and brethren what must we do he said repent cheat when you repent and that's what the problem is they say oh I got Jesus in my heart and dr. changes they don't think they have to change they've received Jesus they believe Jesus and now tell you the devil does too the Bible said the devil believes and tremble but there must come a change Oh think about it the change must come because if life is in you it will produce life is that right it'll make you bird you know how this oh I'm trying the bird I'm trying the life you just like I said keep eating keep reading keep praying keep that whatever God that'll teach you listen keep with sharing the scripture with me and I've been thinking about it ever since but let me tell you something when you fast you fast for yolks to be broken mmm you know you don't fast to get faith faith come out here in the Word of God not by fasting you fasting because of other people not yourself you fasting that God will break the yolks hmm you know what people don't understand is that it's even fasting and things like that have been misplaced hmm you know people that all communion all praise God come you communion it's not eating bread when I commune with somebody I'm talking with them I'm fellowshipping and if you come to communion and you're not fellowship with God what you're doing you're lying communion is to say me and God has been fellowship it's not bread and told I mean bread and unwind those are symbolic symbolisms of of what you've been doing with God and the body of Christ because you cannot commune with God if you can't commune with the body of Christ oh that's a big one in there you love the Lord I'm gonna closing just a bit y'all just bear with me brothers I know y'all tired too but I'm so glad you came in the message oneness the Prophet God says no one can believe here it is no man no woman can believe the devil's lies until they have disbelieved God's truth a shout somebody no one can believe the devil's lie until they have disbelieved God's truth [Music] and y'all knows the truth in order for us to believe the lie we must first push away the truth if God say you deliver and the devil said you're not delivered you must first push for where your deliverance in order to believe that you're not delivered hallelujah is this okay listen let me read this quote the Word of God is sharper than a two-edged sword even a discerner of the thoughts of the heart and what it can only be handled by one hand a sword is dominant it has nothing in it unless it's handled by a hand and when I hand of faith can pick up God's Word it'll do the same thing Jesus did the works that I do shall you do also maybe you can cut just a little maybe you got a weak hand of faith you can cut enough off to say well I can see enough daylight to see if I'm saying but choose me but what about the other promises if you got a strong hand of faith pick up the full word of God and cut right on through every darkness amen until the light of God shines in and look face to face with God standing on his word amen she had many hindrances this poor little woman did she had many hindrances but her faith didn't have any no no hello she had him but a faint didn't know no she had heard faith had took a whole she heard and her faith had took a whole now they might have said to this her you know you are Greek you know you never get nothing because there's a segregation you see and you never get nothing here but did she pay attention to that no sir she had faith and that faith was all she needed because she know that that was the Word of God standing there she had faith and some of them might have said to her but wait a minute her own nation her own church might have said now wait a minute the days of miracles is past don't you go down there there that days of miracles is past but something another about faith it has a source that don't pay attention to that it just don't notice it she had done picked up the word he is the word she had the faith to hold it she she walked on they might have laughed at her well everybody else was going to laugh at you because your daughter would be just as sick next year and she is this year she'll still have the devil she'll be just a sick but she didn't pay any attention to that faith had a whole you be you'll be put out of your church if you ever go there in one of that just remember they put you out there s communicate you that didn't mean anything to her faith on every excuse me faith went on over the top of that and she was determined to get to Jesus see that's what I'm saying they told me brother Brooks if you go to another one of your those meetings we gonna put you out I said will you put me out there just like that she gots a sane idea to forgive me long but this the truth what do I care you don't have shame I'm gonna be put out of your church and that was a that was the best thing they could have said to me and then one day I said well I'm gonna tell the bishop I say go tell the bishop you don't push me in a corner now I might look a little timid or whatever but not not not when you push me in the corner that's a different story anyhow amen and because I mean many people left that system but nevertheless it was God working God's Word cannot be questionable you can't question God's Word if God says that that's what he means don't blame God if it ain't happening is your thing hmm and if it if it ain't happening to you maybe God don't want it to happen to you at that moment because when God wants it to happen he gives you the faith for it to happen to make it happen your faith is the only thing that can do you any good you'll believe your faith in God see what I mean without faith it is impossible is that true you can't you can't please in oh I can't see him I don't need to see him with my natural eyes I can't see him but I know he's just as real as I am how do you know you saved what did God do to you did you feel a mighty rushing wind did you see the pillar fire did you see the pillow cloud did you hear the angels singing that has nothing to do with it when God saves you something happens in the heart and it never stays dormant when it happens guess what happens so you'll know you're saved you start hungry you want more of God you get disgusted when you make mistakes that means you alive something in you is living and feeding so your best bet is to take the Word of God and feed that new birth that thing that's in you you feed it till it break loose in you yeah that's when you know you got something like I said here before a dead man don't say I'm hungry a dead man is dead ain't nothing about a dead man is hungry but when you hunger and thirst guess what the best sign that that you are live when you are hungry and thirsting for what righteousness God said you shall be filled now do you believe that I believe that I have faith in Him and that's what I keep telling God I said God I trust you you know me you made me you created me you know my beginning my ending my uprising am i setting down when I go in where I go out you know me what can I do to hide from God there ain't nothing the Bob said even the darkness is like to God he sees everything he knows everything and that's what I tell him I talked to him just like that I said oh shoot know me ain't nothing I can do to hide from you but then you know what the part of my heart that won't smoke won't you more than anything else in spite of all my failures you know and I'm trusting you because he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it we worry about things that we don't we shouldn't worry about because the battles have been fought and the victory has been won before Paul even died he said thanks be to God who gives me give us what the victory he gave it to you it's already yours but you know we rely on our sisters is this the same visa five oh I gotta feel it I would tell you thing about gifted people when you got discernment it's a good thing but it could also be bad because just like you pick up on God you also pick up on the devil you understand me and guess what you say oh I want to do this up but you got to be careful because Satan can disguise himself he can almost feet and come out come to you and feel like feel oh it's the Holy Spirit who I felt goosebumps hey brother what I'm saying if a body rushing when he struck you he said you know how do you always Oh guy he said no let's see what it does for you after it struck you that's how you did it oh one more quote number let you go it takes a mustard seed faith to be with God we don't know do y'all know what perfect oneness is it's God in you that's it perfect oneness now the first man and his first woman in the Garden of Eden was in perfect harmony with God so much that God could come down at any time he desired and talked lip to ear with Adam and Eve that's what I loved about brother Branham it made no difference whether he was hunting walking whatever he was in such a condition that God could come down and talk to him now people that's the way we supposed to be it's not him that he's the perfect one in me the interest is made and he's gonna oh no no you got to become like that your communion must be that way your fellowship must be that way you understand me so it is a family I'm reading into you in just a minute so much that God could come down at any time he desired and talk lip to ear with Adam and Eve now that is perfect oneness God and His creation God speaking lip to ear with Adam and Eve and they were so perfect in harmony with God till they were one with God God and his family was one and man in his family a correct good noble obedient family is one with another any family and if there's something in the family that moves them apart then it's not right the family's broken somewhere they should all be one father with mother mother with father children with parent parent with children all in the agreement and when you see that you'll see one lovely picture the God's purpose that's God's purpose and his purpose as father supreme was to be one with his family earthly family Adam and Eve and the only way that they could be one with the family or with God was because God's nature was in them right God's nature was in them so that made them with God nature in them then with each other and God they become all one isn't that a beautiful picture God in his family father over all supreme no death no sorrow no heartache no no no nothing just joy and speak for never to be sick never to have a headache just one with God what a picture because the very nature of God was in these people and therefore what they did they fathered just just in line with God and God with them made them one that's why the devil don't want the nature of God in you that's why he's putting so many distractions in our way because he knows once the fullness of the nature of God is in you you want with him you hear from him live to hear God talks to you when he won't talk to somebody else he knows if you reach that level you become a powerhouse when that lady said to the Prophet god William burn we don't have nothing to do with you her husband said well my wife is now spoken she haven't been speaking like since she got in there he said that ain't your wife that's the devil huh it's powerful when the devil knows your name that means you didn't put her will heat him you didn't rob some havoc in his kingdom right he said that ain't that ain't your wife that's the devil and this is what he said he said he went to grab that lady he said and he was like god is great he had put his foot on one thing to snatch his hand away he said she had the power of ten men and he said that was demonic power he said what about the Holy Ghost power in you if demons can cause that what about the Holy Ghost power and no matter how tight that debt that lady grabbed him huh the devil had to come out amen that's see what you see Jesus prayed in John chapter 11 of 17 11 says to you who put down these son let's go go he says listen Jesus prayed that the church and he would be one like he and the father was one that's the church we as members of the body of Christ would be one together like that like he and the father are one and at that day we will know that he was in the father and father in him and he in us that together we were one what a union a oneness that will be to see God in his church till every member is just perfectly in harmony with each other and God now come on we got a long way to go that the church that Jesus has come that's the church that Jesus is coming from for that when his that's when his prayer will be answered that we will be one and it's the only grounds of fellowship that God has ever laid down for himself and his church is the oneness of himself in the people that's the only grounds of fellowship and the only way that you can have those grounds is by Union to be united with him forever just like when you unite with your husband the woman to unite with her husband it is a vow unto death now when then when you unite with God is the same thing that the church unites with Christ it until death we part and then if you never sinned or do anything wrong you'll be eternally United with God and the only death can excuse me and only death can take you away from God and not physical death but the sin of death sin is death and that takes you away from God so to be united with him in the spirit of his power is eternal life you're eternally united with God oh I want to get to that after a bit United eternally with the eternal God perfectly in harmony with him perfectly United together a church that all both God and His Church is one you nine it together you understand me so I say all of this John says a loud voice I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is salvation come and strength and kingdom of God and the power of Christ for the accuser of our brother is cast down which accused them before our God day and night listen they overcame by him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death they overcame no tests no testimony no tests no testimony you know God could have made your Moses put the stick in your hand say go tell Pharaoh we got an easy compare yeah we got it easy can you imagine what that you can't do that without faith you cannot do that kind of a thing without the leadership of God and to know how wicked and evil Pharaoh was and then you coming up there threatening him with all of his entourage all of his bodyguards all of his army about him and you saying let my people go that man no doubt if you had been him you were to say you know we got a nut there's something wrong with this man yeah but he failed to see that inside of Moses was a God failed God was there he wasn't dealing with Moses nor the Prince of Egypt no longer was he dealing with the Prince of Egypt here was Moses now our King that right not just the king of God I'm gonna make you God over Pharaoh and that's what I'm trying to say folks those were shadows and tights those were things that God did to increase your faith and brother man said I was there I was there I was there and if brother Brandon was there so with you and you got to take those scriptures when things come your way and you can't seem to get over fine you were get that is in here God would give you what you need for your right now circumstance and you find that word and you hold on to it if you've got to confess it every day until it happens right with the stripes I'm healed extra-extra with the stripes I'm healed because he thought he had faith he didn't have it but he had to confess it confess it confess it even though people laughed at him extra answer with the stripes I'm healed he had to confess it confessing confessing and then God came on the scene is that right look at the latest Amen that that that all infidel says are you know up on the hill we thought that the Salvation Army had that moved up in up there said oh that one had a big order and I think the other one had cancer something going on in her stomach she couldn't eat hallelujah her husband said when I come over honey you know you still believe in that said but honey that man was able to tell me things that nobody else could have told me it had to be God Jana coming and date but they had to be tested whenever you say I believe something and God is gonna send the tests and you got to hold on to what you believe cuz if you move you got to start it all over again hello you got to know no matter how strong it seems and no matter how pressing it looks you hold on to God's unchanging head if God has said so it will come to pass no matter how long it takes and the Bible said that night the angel the Lord visited the city whoa I understand faith without faith it's impossible to please God God don't do a halfway job [Music] he comes through
