[10:44] oh
[10:47] great is thy faithfulness
[11:00] good morning yesterday was a great
[11:05] day for me it was a great day for the
[11:07] house lord
[11:10] i had uh i don't know if many of you
[11:12] were here when
[11:14] david brother david six toes the
[11:16] potter's house here in town
[11:18] he ministered here and uh
[11:22] and had a marvelous testimony i thought
[11:24] it was just a
[11:25] great message he came by my office on
[11:29] uh on wednesday this past week and uh
[11:35] we uh i just laid it on my heart that i
[11:37] needed to see his grandpa whose grandpa
[11:39] has been
[11:40] very ill he took a pretty bad gash in
[11:43] the head that was
[11:44] not operable and so he's been pretty
[11:48] much laid up
[11:48] and had if you wanted to look at
[11:52] his face you'd see death in his face it
[11:55] wasn't a good situation
[11:58] but i told david i said we need to go
[12:01] pray with your grandpa
[12:03] and so he said he would talk to the
[12:06] family
[12:07] about it and they were encouraged by it
[12:09] and
[12:10] so i picked him up yesterday morning and
[12:12] we went up to perry where he's in an
[12:14] assisted living up there and uh
[12:18] we had a marvelous time at met david's
[12:22] uncle which would have been his
[12:23] grandfather's uh
[12:26] son and uh they're not exactly walking
[12:30] with the lord but very
[12:31] pleasant people birth just very
[12:33] respectful people
[12:35] and the one nurse that's pretty much
[12:39] waiting on david's
[12:40] grandfather day and night
[12:43] was there and she stayed in the room
[12:46] with us while we prayed
[12:47] and probably
[12:50] better give a little
[12:55] step-by-step or update
[12:58] because once we got back right before
[13:01] lunch time yesterday
[13:03] i told david i said you're gonna need to
[13:05] keep me updated
[13:07] and he said well it's you know we're
[13:09] just gonna stay right with this
[13:10] if we have to go back there and pray i
[13:12] said absolutely but
[13:14] i'm talking about today i said
[13:18] i think your grandfather was ready to
[13:20] walk and he said
[13:22] what i said yeah he's ready to walk you
[13:25] just keep me updated
[13:27] so the first update i got
[13:30] he and he sends this update
[13:33] internationally there's p and his
[13:35] grandfather's been here
[13:37] 40 years latino but been here 40 years
[13:41] and uh so pretty prairie americanized
[13:45] i'll put it that way
[13:47] here's david saying look everyone in
[13:50] in the family is amazing at grandpa they
[13:53] have never seen him so attentive
[13:56] they carried him there but he's holding
[14:00] his head and there's a
[14:02] photograph of him and his wife
[14:05] sitting in the family room and i can't
[14:08] read you the english caption
[14:10] beneath it but or the spanish caption
[14:13] rather
[14:15] they were having every time they had him
[14:18] up they had to prop
[14:19] his head and really give him a lot of
[14:21] support he could not let his head
[14:24] free stand and put it that way um
[14:30] yes it is i and i said glory to glory i
[14:33] said the lord is worthy of all praise
[14:34] and he said yes he is brother
[14:36] and so then they
[14:40] took him outside and they sent me a
[14:43] video of this
[14:44] and
[14:47] do you know any spanish
[14:51] you know spanish right
[14:55] but they had him outdoors and
[14:58] the caption his brother for the first
[15:00] time outside
[15:01] in five weeks
[15:05] so when he uh when he fell
[15:08] it was a little offset in the pavement
[15:11] and he tripped over it
[15:12] it was right there where his son's
[15:15] garage is
[15:16] and uh it was uh
[15:19] probably very difficult for the son to
[15:21] have that condition for his dad to trip
[15:24] and gaze his head and basically be an
[15:27] inoperable and uh when i got out of my
[15:31] vehicle
[15:32] i didn't know about this offset in the
[15:35] pavement but to
[15:36] when i got out of my vehicle to go into
[15:38] the place where his
[15:40] dad is laid up or his grandfather's
[15:43] right up
[15:45] i tripped over the gash but
[15:48] the lord caught me his angel caught me
[15:51] and
[15:52] did not hit the hit the hard pavement
[15:56] and uh it was just so
[15:59] david came out later on after we were
[16:01] done praying and he
[16:03] explained to me what was going on he
[16:04] said you tripped right where
[16:06] grandpa tripped it but you didn't fall
[16:09] and grandpa
[16:10] had hit his head and
[16:13] so as the day went on
[16:17] those continued updates
[16:22] just he basically is in a situation
[16:27] which nothing should marvelous
[16:31] i think sometimes we think of a person
[16:35] that has a affliction like that
[16:38] but god's promise is joshua rafa says
[16:41] that
[16:42] he will heal us of all our afflictions
[16:45] but we have to speak to that
[16:47] we cannot just read the bible and
[16:50] read that verse and and think that
[16:53] that's going to happen to us
[16:54] it's it's for our overcoming and uh
[16:57] to to hold up the rod the lord's rod
[17:01] and hold up that standard
[17:04] so i just tell you all that because
[17:08] nobody could have ever guessed that he
[17:10] would have been
[17:12] outdoors or setting up right he he was
[17:14] in bed
[17:16] laying flat when i got there there was
[17:19] no spark of
[17:20] him doing anything in in the near future
[17:24] so
[17:25] just give praise to god just in your own
[17:28] heart just let it be real to you i just
[17:30] think
[17:31] the lord to just give you reality of
[17:34] what
[17:35] that type of opportunity would be
[17:38] i probably a little bit more
[17:42] sensitive to it david and i have gotten
[17:44] to know each other he comes by my office
[17:46] quite often during the day and
[17:49] ministers to me and me to him and
[17:52] so hopefully one day we'll have uh
[17:55] have the opportunity to have him back in
[17:57] here and continue to
[18:00] give a testimony so let's just go before
[18:03] the lord
[18:03] as we get this morning started
[18:07] father god we come to you this morning
[18:09] humbly
[18:12] in the precious name of jesus christ
[18:14] under the shed blood
[18:17] and i thank you lord for the token
[18:20] that you've shown me lord sealed until
[18:22] the day of redemption and i
[18:24] mean i know many here can give that same
[18:27] testimony
[18:29] i thank you lord for that humble
[18:32] spirit you've given and you said with a
[18:34] humble spirit
[18:36] and contrite heart is where you will
[18:40] find your place in our hearts and our
[18:43] souls
[18:45] in that most holy place
[18:48] and we thank you that you've made a way
[18:50] that we can
[18:52] enter in under the shed of blood and
[18:54] enter in not just timidly but
[18:56] boldly entering
[19:00] to seek your face to have communion with
[19:02] you

[19:08] there be but to seek your faith

[20:06] god except
[20:09] they cannot see deceive

[20:23] pulling your words right out of our
[20:26] brother as he delivers the message

[45:00] restore amen
[45:04] and none saith restore
[45:07] that's a sad place amen let's turn over
[45:10] to john chapter 10 verse 10.
[45:14] it's not just that the people are in a
[45:15] bad condition
[45:17] but that they're in a bad condition and
[45:19] none are crying out for it
[45:22] amen john chapter 10 verse 10
[45:26] and we'll start with the ninth verse
[45:29] actually
[45:31] and jesus says i am the door
[45:35] by me if any man enter in he shall be
[45:38] saved
[45:39] and shall go in and out and find pasture
[45:42] but the thief cometh not but for this
[45:46] the thief cometh not
[45:49] but for to steal and to kill and to
[45:52] destroy

[48:03] amen amen you can be seated
[48:07] amen
[48:10] our god is a good god isn't he saints
[48:13] amen you know throughout all
[48:17] history religion has been trying to
[48:22] has been battling against the spirit of
[48:24] the living god
[48:26] and at all times in all places there's
[48:29] always those
[48:31] two trees throughout all history there's
[48:35] two trees in the garden there's always
[48:38] been two spirits in the church
[48:39] there's been a holy spirit and a unholy
[48:42] spirit
[48:43] amen and those spirits are
[48:46] here to have their way with the people
[48:49] but
[48:50] it surely it just depends on which
[48:52] direction you yield to
[48:54] amen but you know no matter what the
[48:56] condition of the church is
[48:58] god always has a plan of restoration
[49:01] he has always at all times had something
[49:03] in his mind it's a picture it's a vision
[49:06] of
[49:06] of the condition that the church ought
[49:09] to be
[49:09] that the people ought to be in that his
[49:12] bride ought to be in
[49:13] a condition that you ought to be god has
[49:16] something in his mind a condition a
[49:19] a position for you if you have ever once
[49:22] come across
[49:24] uh this th this life this
[49:27] this if you've ever been once called to
[49:29] christ
[49:30] if god's poll has ever come
[49:34] and tugged on your heart's door then god
[49:37] has
[49:37] a plan for you if he has ever once
[49:41] knocked at your heart's door he did it
[49:43] for a very specific reason
[49:45] if he has ever once tugged at your
[49:47] heart's door
[49:48] it's because he had something in his
[49:50] mind amen
[49:52] all power in heaven and earth is is
[49:55] behind making that vision come to pass
[49:58] in your life
[49:59] amen but there's got to be a yielding to
[50:01] make that come to pass
[50:03] amen at all times there's always got to
[50:05] be a call in your heart
[50:07] amen to cry out for what god has in
[50:10] store for you
[50:11] there's got to be something in your
[50:13] heart that cries out
[50:14] to to manifest the vision of god for
[50:17] this hour
[50:18] amen there's always got to be something
[50:20] in your heart that cries out lord
[50:22] i need restoration lord i i need healing
[50:26] lord i i need deliverance lord i i need
[50:30] this or i need that
[50:31] there's got to be a response
[50:34] from the people for the vision that god
[50:37] has amen
[50:39] i remember when you know for several
[50:41] years we lived at this
[50:42] uh in a town called redfield and this
[50:46] this uh town we lived there for about
[50:49] eight years
[50:50] and on the outskirts of this town there
[50:52] was a
[50:53] house that when we moved into town it
[50:56] was
[50:57] the windows were broken there was no
[50:59] paint left on the walls anymore you know
[51:01] and
[51:02] there was holes in the roof and you
[51:03] could tell it had been abandoned for a
[51:05] long long time
[51:07] and when we first moved there it was a
[51:09] nice piece of property it was down by
[51:11] the river
[51:12] and we thought you know or you know it's
[51:14] like someone ought to buy that and fix
[51:16] it up
[51:17] but you know nobody ever did and
[51:21] for the over the eight years that we
[51:22] lived there we watched the house
[51:24] get in worse and worse condition and uh
[51:27] one one year also i noticed that one of
[51:29] the the north wall of the house was
[51:31] beginning to buckle
[51:33] and then all of a sudden the the wall
[51:35] the entire wall of the house slid off of
[51:37] the foundation
[51:38] and then the the supports for the roof
[51:41] were no longer there and the roof began
[51:43] to fall in
[51:44] one day the chimney started to lean and
[51:47] and pretty soon the chimney fell through
[51:48] the roof and
[51:50] and you just knew that the house was
[51:52] beyond restoration
[51:54] you know and we by the time we moved out
[51:56] of that
[51:57] out of that town the the house had
[51:59] completely fallen down it was just a
[52:01] pile of rubble
[52:03] but you know i thought often about that
[52:05] house
[52:06] pondering about who built that place
[52:10] you know there had to be someone that
[52:11] had a vision of that house
[52:14] there had to be someone that had
[52:15] something in their mind of
[52:17] to build that house to put their
[52:19] resources to it
[52:20] to put their time and effort to build
[52:22] that place to lay a foundation
[52:25] someone had to have something in their
[52:27] mind in order to build that place
[52:29] amen they had to go down and write a
[52:31] check to the lumber company
[52:32] and say i want to purchase lumber to
[52:34] build this house
[52:35] you know and you know and they had to
[52:37] put all the nails in put all the lumber
[52:39] in put the roof on
[52:40] put the shingles on the place and for
[52:42] all of their efforts
[52:44] you know and you know the family would
[52:47] move in
[52:48] whatever family it was probably a
[52:49] hundred years ago people lived in that
[52:51] house
[52:52] but there came a time where decisions
[52:55] were made
[52:57] you know there's houses all over this
[52:59] country that are 100 years old or
[53:01] 200 years old there's even a few that
[53:03] are probably around 300 years old
[53:05] but the ones that are hundreds of years
[53:07] old have been constantly maintained
[53:10] you know and people have cared for them
[53:12] throughout the years but this house here
[53:15] there had to be someone that made the
[53:17] start to make decisions i'm not going to
[53:20] fix this
[53:21] or i'm not going to fix that at some
[53:24] point
[53:25] in that house is history a window got
[53:27] broken
[53:28] and someone decided not to fix it at one
[53:31] point
[53:32] the roof began to leak and no one
[53:36] decided to repair it you know there was
[53:38] uh there was a day when the last
[53:40] meal was cooked in that house there was
[53:44] a day when someone
[53:45] slept the last night that anybody would
[53:47] ever sleep in the house
[53:49] you know those decisions were made when
[53:51] people decided to move out
[53:53] and no longer to fix it up and from that
[53:55] point on
[53:56] no one ever cried out restore
[54:00] no one ever cried out repair this house
[54:03] no one ever cried out this house ought
[54:05] to be fixed up
[54:06] and as the years went down you know we
[54:09] could see that the house was just
[54:11] falling apart and no one ever cried out
[54:14] and said
[54:14] this house ought to be restored no one
[54:17] ever said the vision ought to be brought
[54:19] back
[54:20] whatever the people had when their mind
[54:22] when they first built the house
[54:24] that vision never came back to be
[54:26] restored back to the vision
[54:28] no one ever decided to fix it up
[54:31] and so the condition of that house was
[54:34] just returning back to the dirt that it
[54:36] came from
[54:37] you know and and there's got to be a
[54:39] people that call out for restoration
[54:42] our god is a god of restoration
[54:45] throughout history
[54:46] we've seen it throughout all the bible
[54:48] when people get in a certain condition
[54:50] that god has to give a vision of
[54:52] restoration to the people
[54:54] and if god does not bring the vision of
[54:56] restoration to the people
[54:58] then who can restore
[55:02] if the vision doesn't come who
[55:06] how can there be healing you know how
[55:09] can you think of a person you know of
[55:11] that has fallen into sin that used to
[55:13] love the lord
[55:14] when did they last sing their song or
[55:16] praise when was the
[55:18] the last time they repented for this or
[55:21] said they were sorry for that
[55:23] when was the last time they said thank
[55:25] you lord what is the last time that they
[55:27] said praise god
[55:28] but there comes a date and time where
[55:30] they quit saying those things
[55:32] there comes a date and time where they
[55:34] quit being sorry for their sins
[55:36] or they they they no longer have the
[55:39] burden of the holy ghost for lost souls
[55:41] they no longer you know there comes a
[55:43] day when they uh they miss their first
[55:45] church service
[55:46] and then they miss their next church
[55:48] service and then they all
[55:50] no longer go to church at all there
[55:52] comes a titan
[55:53] date and time where they no longer look
[55:56] anything like the vision that god had
[55:58] for their life in the beginning
[55:59] and who is going to cry out for
[56:01] restoration
[56:02] who is going to call out for deliverance
[56:05] it's not that there isn't deliverance
[56:07] there
[56:08] it's not that there isn't a god of
[56:10] restoration there
[56:11] it's not that the vision of god isn't
[56:13] there but who is going to cry out for
[56:16] restoration
[56:17] that's what we read there in isaiah this
[56:21] is a condition of the daughter of my
[56:22] people
[56:23] and this is the condition that they're
[56:25] in but there's no one crying out for
[56:27] restoration
[56:29] see it's the cry it's not that the the
[56:32] power isn't there but there's got to be
[56:33] someone that's going to cry out for it
[56:37] let's uh let's turn over to the book of
[56:39] nehemiah
[56:41] i preached a message probably a year or
[56:44] two ago on this
[56:46] on these scriptures here in nehemiah and
[56:47] i thought i'd revisit it this morning
[56:57] we'll read from nehemiah chapter one
[57:01] if you remember the the story of
[57:04] nehemiah
[57:05] it has its roots there and actually in
[57:08] jeremiah
[57:09] quite a while back because when jeremiah
[57:12] was the prophet was prophesying
[57:15] to the house of israel if you do not
[57:18] repent you will go into captivity
[57:21] if you do not repent and come back to
[57:24] the word of god
[57:25] you will be taken from this place of
[57:27] worship into captivity
[57:30] and they would not repent god told the
[57:33] prophet jeremiah you will go and preach
[57:35] to them
[57:36] but they will not repent and
[57:39] and god told jeremiah he says tell them
[57:41] you will be
[57:42] in captivity 70 years and then i will
[57:45] bring you back
[57:46] in a period of restoration in a time of
[57:49] restoration
[57:51] and as god began to restore in the book
[57:54] of daniel
[57:55] and then he continued to work there in
[57:57] ezra and
[57:58] [Music]
[58:00] zachariah and different prophets as he
[58:02] kept restoring
[58:03] amen that the the process of restoration
[58:06] was so slow amen
[58:08] amen it just seemed like the process of
[58:11] restoration was
[58:12] creeping along and god is having a hard
[58:16] time getting his people
[58:18] to catch the vision of restoration
[58:20] though the prophecies had gone out
[58:23] prophets would come and go come and go
[58:25] and people
[58:26] get inspired and they put a few more
[58:28] nails in the house
[58:29] but god still did not have a true place
[58:32] of worship
[58:33] there in jerusalem amen and you get down
[58:36] into the days of nehemiah
[58:38] the house of the lord had been built but
[58:40] they still did not have
[58:41] bought walls or boundaries this the the
[58:44] the
[58:45] land all around was still in ruins and
[58:48] and nehemiah was still living in the
[58:50] land of captivity
[58:53] and so you get to nehemiah chapter one
[58:56] and verse two
[58:58] nehemiah is living and still in the land
[59:00] of captivity
[59:02] and he has some visitors that come back
[59:04] from jerusalem
[59:07] let's read here from the second verse it
[59:09] says that
[59:10] hannah and i one of my brethren came
[59:14] he and certain men of judah and i asked
[59:17] them
[59:18] concerning the jews that had escaped
[59:20] which were left in the captivity
[59:22] and concerning jerusalem and they said
[59:25] unto me
[59:26] the remnant that are left of the
[59:28] captivity there in the province
[59:30] are in great affliction and reproach
[59:33] the wall of jerusalem also is broken
[59:36] down
[59:38] the gates thereof are burned with fire
[59:41] and it came to pass that when i heard
[59:43] these words
[59:45] that i set down and i wept and i mourned
[59:48] certain days
[59:49] and i fasted and i prayed before the god
[59:52] of heaven
[59:54] and it goes on down to the next several
[59:55] verses talking about
[59:57] nehemiah prays this great prayer of
[59:59] repentance
[1:00:00] of sorrow and as i thought about this
[1:00:04] you know nehemiah was actually living in
[1:00:07] a pretty good place
[1:00:08] there in babylon where he was he was
[1:00:11] had a job there in the king's palace he
[1:00:14] had a nice house he had food on his
[1:00:18] table
[1:00:18] he would go and perform his work and
[1:00:20] he'd get to go home and live in peace
[1:00:22] and the condition of his natural house
[1:00:25] was pretty good
[1:00:27] the condition of his natural house where
[1:00:29] he was living was pretty good
[1:00:30] but the time came in his life where he
[1:00:33] had to ask about his spiritual house
[1:00:35] amen because a spiritual house was 500
[1:00:38] miles away over in jerusalem
[1:00:40] and he's living here in peace in babylon
[1:00:43] and he's
[1:00:44] he has a pretty good life he has a
[1:00:46] pretty good he has
[1:00:47] food good food to eat he has a nice
[1:00:50] house he has a nice pillow on his bed
[1:00:53] he's living at peace he has a nice job
[1:00:55] he's serving the king of babylon
[1:00:58] and and and the king is
[1:01:01] at peace with them and on all these
[1:01:04] things and
[1:01:05] but then he comes down to appear in his
[1:01:07] life he begins to ask about his
[1:01:09] spiritual house
[1:01:10] how is my spiritual house doing what's
[1:01:13] the condition of my spiritual house

[1:04:40] moved out there was a day
[1:04:42] came when the uh the last person slept
[1:04:45] in the house
[1:04:46] and that house was just left back to the
[1:04:48] wilderness and so is it so with uh
[1:04:51] people that claim to be christians
[1:04:53] there's a day comes when they miss their
[1:04:55] first church service
[1:04:57] there's a day comes when they get sick
[1:04:58] and they don't cry out to god
[1:05:00] there's a day that comes that they sin
[1:05:03] they sin
[1:05:03] and they never cry out for forgiveness
[1:05:06] there's a day comes when
[1:05:07] when the spirit of the living god comes
[1:05:09] by their place for the last time
[1:05:11] and they and they miss out on the uh
[1:05:15] the the the presence of the almighty god
[1:05:18] there's a day comes when they no longer
[1:05:20] miss the presence of the lord jesus
[1:05:22] christ in their lives
[1:05:24] there is the day comes the last time

[1:05:28] the last time that they'll ever cry out
[1:05:30] to god for their sins
[1:05:32] the last time they ever feel sorry for
[1:05:34] the sins that they allow in their house
[1:05:36] and there comes the last time and then
[1:05:38] the condition of that house
[1:05:41] is in ruins what will that house be like
[1:05:45] when christ comes back jesus christ
[1:05:48] comes there will be a people that are
[1:05:49] alive
[1:05:50] and remain at the coming of the lord the
[1:05:53] bible
[1:05:53] jesus or paul prophesied that in the
[1:05:57] last days
[1:05:58] there would be a people that christ
[1:06:00] would come back for
[1:06:01] and that people would be a people that
[1:06:03] are alive
[1:06:04] and remain that's how he described them
[1:06:07] he said that they would be alive
[1:06:09] and that they'd still be there they'd be
[1:06:11] remaining amen it's not just that they'd
[1:06:13] be shown up at church
[1:06:14] but they'd be showing up at the house of
[1:06:16] worship where god's sacrifices
[1:06:19] their prayers are still upon the altar
[1:06:21] they're still showing up at heaven's
[1:06:23] door
[1:06:24] saying restore lord deliver lord
[1:06:27] set free they're still remaining there
[1:06:30] at the house of god
[1:06:31] they're still remaining their prayers
[1:06:33] are still upon the altar
[1:06:34] they're still saying restore and they're
[1:06:36] still alive
[1:06:38] the presence of god is still in their
[1:06:39] life
[1:06:41] those are descriptions of the church in
[1:06:43] the last day
[1:06:44] but does this description match up with
[1:06:47] your condition
[1:06:48] amen there's got to be a people that
[1:06:50] match what the division is
[1:07:00] turn over to isaiah chapter 40.
[1:07:18] isaiah chapter 40 is the same
[1:07:21] chapter that promised john the baptist
[1:07:23] would come
[1:07:25] if you remember the verse from verse 3
[1:07:27] it says the voice of him that cries in
[1:07:29] the wilderness
[1:07:31] prepare ye the way of the lord make
[1:07:33] straight in the desert a highway for our
[1:07:35] god
[1:07:36] amen and john the baptist picked that
[1:07:38] verse up and says
[1:07:40] this is me we're living in a day of
[1:07:42] restoration
[1:07:43] and i am here to make straight his past
[1:07:48] and isaiah chapter 40 was risen up out
[1:07:51] of history
[1:07:52] and brought to that present day
[1:07:55] because there's a day of restoration
[1:07:57] amen but that was the day of the
[1:07:59] restoration of the bridegroom tree
[1:08:02] the day that that tree was resurrected
[1:08:04] amen but there's got to be a
[1:08:06] resurrection of the bride tree
[1:08:08] amen just as much as christ resurrected
[1:08:11] from the dead
[1:08:12] so is there got to be a bride of christ
[1:08:15] they will resurrect from the deadness of
[1:08:17] religion
[1:08:18] amen they'll resurrect from from from
[1:08:20] the places that she's fallen down into
[1:08:22] all the church ages where
[1:08:24] the spirit of god has been left off from
[1:08:26] the church
[1:08:28] where the religion has nibbled away at
[1:08:31] the fruits of the church and
[1:08:33] the palmer worm and the cankerworm and
[1:08:36] the joel chapter two that army that was
[1:08:38] sent to
[1:08:39] uh eat the bark off the tree and the the
[1:08:42] leaves off the tree and it left a tree
[1:08:44] that was in ruins
[1:08:45] but god says there will be some that
[1:08:47] will call out for restoration
[1:08:50] amen in isaiah chapter 40 it says
[1:08:53] in verse 29 he says
[1:08:56] he giveth power to the faint he
[1:09:00] to them that have no smite he increases
[1:09:02] strength
[1:09:03] he says even the youths shall faint and
[1:09:06] be weary
[1:09:07] the young men shall utterly fall but
[1:09:10] they that wait upon the lord shall renew
[1:09:13] their strength
[1:09:14] they shall mount up with wings as eagles
[1:09:16] they shall run and not be weary
[1:09:19] and they shall walk and not faint there
[1:09:21] will be a people though they may get
[1:09:23] wore
[1:09:24] out though they may get wore down though
[1:09:27] the enemy will try to wear out the
[1:09:28] saints of god as the revelation
[1:09:30] said but there will be a people that
[1:09:32] will wait upon the lord in the midst of
[1:09:34] it all
[1:09:35] amen and god will send them their
[1:09:37] strengths and due season
[1:09:39] they though they get weary they shall
[1:09:40] mount up with wings as eagles
[1:09:42] amen though they get weird they shall
[1:09:45] walk and they will not faint
[1:09:46] they will keep going because they will
[1:09:48] be alive
[1:09:50] and remain at the coming of the lord
[1:09:52] amen why because there is something
[1:09:54] inside of them
[1:09:56] that cries out deliver there's something
[1:09:58] inside of them
[1:09:59] that cries out lord restore amen like
[1:10:03] nehemiah when he saw the condition of
[1:10:05] his spiritual house
[1:10:06] he said o lord forgive o lord deliver
[1:10:10] o lord wash and make clean oh lord
[1:10:13] rebuild my house
[1:10:14] lord rebuild my walls rebuild a place
[1:10:17] where you can be worshiped in peace
[1:10:20] and one he caught the revelation of what
[1:10:23] is the condition of a spiritual house
[1:10:25] he had drove him to repentance it drove
[1:10:28] him to
[1:10:29] a contract spirit it drove him to a
[1:10:33] a place of of repenting for his sins
[1:10:36] amen it ought to be all of us that when
[1:10:38] we see a deficiency in our spiritual
[1:10:41] house
[1:10:42] when we see a broken window over here we
[1:10:44] ought to fix it
[1:10:46] amen when we see when the roof begins to
[1:10:48] leak we ought to repair it
[1:10:50] amen when things begin to get broken
[1:10:52] down there's got to be something rise up
[1:10:54] inside you that says restore
[1:10:56] lord patch this up lord
[1:10:59] fix this up lord i can't let my house
[1:11:02] get into this condition
[1:11:04] there's got to be something inside of us
[1:11:06] that said that knows that the power of
[1:11:08] restoration is there
[1:11:10] he because he giveth power to those that
[1:11:12] are faint
[1:11:13] to them that have no strength he
[1:11:16] increases their might he increases their
[1:11:18] strength
[1:11:19] he said even the young men shall faint
[1:11:22] and be weary
[1:11:23] even the young men shall utterly fall
[1:11:25] but those that wait upon the lord shall
[1:11:28] renew their strength
[1:11:29] their house shall be restored when they
[1:11:32] cry out for restoration it will be given
[1:11:34] to them
[1:11:35] when they cry out for a time of
[1:11:36] refreshing and renewal
[1:11:38] it will be poured out upon them when
[1:11:40] they say lord fill me again with your
[1:11:42] holy ghost
[1:11:43] the holy ghost will fall upon them when
[1:11:45] their eyes begin to get dim
[1:11:47] god will reopen them amen there's a balm
[1:11:50] and gilead amen
[1:11:52] there remember he said in jeremiah
[1:11:56] uh in jeremiah 8 22 the lord says

[1:12:02] there no physician there
[1:12:04] amen if you could just put that up on
[1:12:05] the screen that's jeremiah 8
[1:12:07] 22 where jehovah was
[1:12:10] speaking through his prophet jeremiah
[1:12:13] and
[1:12:14] and he was wondering about the condition
[1:12:16] of his people
[1:12:17] and and as he said there
[1:12:20] he's he looks at the condition of the
[1:12:22] people and he

[1:13:06] deliverance
[1:13:07] hasn't he given us a message of
[1:13:08] restoration didn't he tell us by a
[1:13:11] prophet
[1:13:12] that this last day bride will be
[1:13:14] restored back
[1:13:15] to be in a condition like it was on the
[1:13:18] day of pentecost

[1:13:21] jesus christ was resurrected
[1:13:24] all those disciples they were they were
[1:13:26] sitting there in the upper room
[1:13:27] all worried and cast down they all
[1:13:30] wondered about this and wondered about
[1:13:32] that
[1:13:32] but yet they had a promise of
[1:13:34] restoration that the spirit that was
[1:13:36] upon the lord jesus christ

[1:14:02] done no matter what this religious
[1:14:04] spirit has done
[1:14:05] or what that religious spirit has done
[1:14:07] but there will be a different spirit
[1:14:09] will come upon you
[1:14:10] amen not a spirit of this denomination
[1:14:13] and not a spirit of that denomination
[1:14:15] by the spirit of the almighty god a
[1:14:18] spirit that cries out restore
[1:14:20] deliver make free amen
[1:14:24] amen there's got to be a people that cry
[1:14:27] out for restoration
[1:14:32] amen
[1:14:39] speaking about the balm and gilead
[1:14:42] if you remember from the story of joseph
[1:14:46] joseph was living there in the promised
[1:14:49] land
[1:14:50] and he was a a spiritual boy
[1:14:53] and he had dreams and visions he had
[1:14:56] contact with the supernatural
[1:14:59] amen because of it his he was hated of
[1:15:01] his brothers
[1:15:03] his father gave him the coat of many
[1:15:05] colors
[1:15:06] and inspired jealousy and his brothers
[1:15:09] and he had visions of everybody bowing
[1:15:11] down to him and it just inspired more
[1:15:13] jealousy amongst his brothers
[1:15:15] amen one day he went out to go visit his
[1:15:18] his brothers wearing the coat of many
[1:15:20] colors
[1:15:21] amen and his brother says here comes
[1:15:25] this dreamer
[1:15:26] what are we to do with him here comes
[1:15:28] this spiritual man
[1:15:29] here comes this man that has contact
[1:15:31] with the god of heaven
[1:15:32] here comes the one that here we are
[1:15:34] living here without the spirit but he
[1:15:36] has contact with the spirit
[1:15:38] and what should we do with them and so
[1:15:39] they took him and they and they uh
[1:15:43] captured him they tied him up they threw
[1:15:45] him in a pit that
[1:15:47] had no water in it on a dry and dusty
[1:15:50] day
[1:15:51] as he was sitting there in that pit you
[1:15:53] can imagine how he felt
[1:15:54] about here why am i in this condition
[1:15:58] why have i been placed here why have i
[1:16:01] been placed down here when
[1:16:03] god has cost me every time god gives me
[1:16:05] something i get persecuted for it
[1:16:08] god gives me this coat i get persecuted
[1:16:10] for it i
[1:16:11] have a dream a dream and it just brings
[1:16:13] more persecution
[1:16:14] i dream this and it brings more
[1:16:16] persecution and i come out to
[1:16:18] bring water to my brothers and they
[1:16:20] throw me in this pit and every time i
[1:16:22] try to do good
[1:16:24] it seems like evil is present and he was
[1:16:27] getting bound down he is getting bogged
[1:16:30] down upon life's journey
[1:16:31] but let me tell you the footsteps of
[1:16:33] joseph were ordered of the lord
[1:16:36] amen and no matter it seemed like no
[1:16:37] matter what
[1:16:39] good that he would do he'd get
[1:16:40] persecuted for it but you know
[1:16:42] as he was sitting there in that dry and
[1:16:44] dusty pit

[1:16:49] amen and i was reading here in this uh
[1:16:52] uh

[1:16:54] verse from the back in genesis back
[1:16:56] there
[1:16:57] that egypt had put in an order for baum
[1:17:00] from gilead
[1:17:02] and as these ishmaelites went down to
[1:17:05] gilead they

[1:17:09] by
[1:17:10] through through where joseph was in the
[1:17:12] pit there
[1:17:13] and that's where are bringing balm from
[1:17:16] gilead to egypt
[1:17:18] and they came by and and joseph's
[1:17:21] brethren

[1:17:31] what they were getting
[1:17:33] let me tell you and and and and all of
[1:17:37] israel's blessings ended up going to
[1:17:39] egypt
[1:17:40] because of joseph amen you know there's
[1:17:43] got to be someone that cries out for
[1:17:45] restoration
[1:17:47] there's got to be someone that cries out

[1:18:24] amen god had a cause and a reason for it
[1:18:27] all
[1:18:28] amen you know in every single step of it
[1:18:31] joseph ended up typing out
[1:18:33] jesus christ amen in all of our trials a
[1:18:36] lot of times we're just typing out the
[1:18:38] spirit of christ amongst it all
[1:18:41] even though we don't even know it amen
[1:18:44] let me tell you if you look down at all
[1:18:45] the types of christ in the old testament
[1:18:48] it well they had a rough time because of
[1:18:51] who they were
[1:18:53] amen from joseph down to isaiah to
[1:18:56] uh enoch and every single one
[1:18:59] they had a rough time because of who
[1:19:01] they were
[1:19:02] take jonah you know looking at lord why
[1:19:05] am i such a disobedient prophet why can
[1:19:08] i be more like elijah
[1:19:09] why can't i be more like enoch why can't
[1:19:12] i be more like abraham
[1:19:13] why is it that when you tell me to do
[1:19:15] this i go over here or i'd say
[1:19:17] you say do that and i go down here and
[1:19:19] now here i am in this belly of the whale
[1:19:21] but there in the very midst of the most
[1:19:24] disobedient
[1:19:25] prophet that god ever had he was typing
[1:19:28] out the most obedient act that would
[1:19:30] ever be done upon the earth
[1:19:31] where it just says jonah was in the
[1:19:33] belly of the whale for three days and
[1:19:35] three nights
[1:19:36] so shall christ be in the belly of the
[1:19:38] earth three days and three nights
[1:19:40] and in his disobedience he is typing out
[1:19:43] the very obedience of christ
[1:19:45] amen
[1:19:49] how could that story not end up in the
[1:19:51] scriptures
[1:19:53] how could that story god had a plan in
[1:19:55] it all
[1:19:57] and so even though he is crying out to
[1:19:59] himself you know me like
[1:20:00] well why am i like this why can't i be
[1:20:03] more like
[1:20:03] abraham why can't i be more like this
[1:20:06] prophet or that prophet
[1:20:07] why do i do this why do i do that but in
[1:20:09] the midst of it all
[1:20:10] god had his hand upon him amen but
[1:20:12] there's got to be
[1:20:13] something in you that cries out for this
[1:20:16] deliverance
[1:20:17] there's got to be something in you that
[1:20:18] cries out for restoration
[1:20:20] even though you're in a pit amen you
[1:20:22] might be that bomb that's going to
[1:20:24] gilead amen
[1:20:25] that's going to egypt you may become the
[1:20:28] bomb of gilead for someone else
[1:20:41] brother brandon preached a message
[1:20:43] called the bride tree
[1:20:47] amen and in it he took from the uh
[1:20:50] the book of joel
[1:20:54] and he went there where it says i will
[1:20:56] restore to you
[1:20:58] all of the years that the locusts had
[1:21:00] eaten that the cankerworm and the
[1:21:02] caterpillar and the palmer were
[1:21:04] my great army which i sent amongst you
[1:21:08] amen you come down to verse 28 and it
[1:21:10] said and it shall come to pass
[1:21:12] afterward i will pour out my spirit upon
[1:21:14] all flesh
[1:21:15] and your sons and your daughters shall
[1:21:17] prophesy your old men shall dream dreams
[1:21:20] and your young men shall see visions and
[1:21:23] upon the servants and upon the handmaids
[1:21:25] in those days i will pour out my spirit
[1:21:28] amen and all those things were to bring
[1:21:30] back
[1:21:31] a time of restoration and brother
[1:21:34] branham preached that message as an
[1:21:36] easter message of resurrection
[1:21:38] and he began to talk about how christ
[1:21:41] had been resurrected
[1:21:43] christ had been restored christ had been
[1:21:46] brought up
[1:21:47] amen but he says that in christ was the
[1:21:50] tree of life
[1:21:51] amen from the garden of eden but he said
[1:21:54] that and amongst all that there's got to
[1:21:55] become a bride tree
[1:21:58] amen there's got to be a bride tree made
[1:22:00] of the same material
[1:22:02] amen when christ comes back for his
[1:22:04] bride
[1:22:05] he's coming back for someone that is
[1:22:07] flesh of his flesh
[1:22:08] that is bone of his bone that is the
[1:22:11] second bride to the second adam
[1:22:13] amen and the in the first adam the he
[1:22:17] received our bride that came out of his
[1:22:19] side

[1:22:23] adam the lord jesus christ
[1:22:25] when he returns he will cut receive a
[1:22:27] bride
[1:22:28] that came out of his sight amen but then
[1:22:31] and you might look at yourself you say
[1:22:33] well i don't feel very much like i came
[1:22:35] out of the side of christ
[1:22:36] i don't feel like i am flesh of his
[1:22:38] flesh i don't really feel like i am
[1:22:40] broad
[1:22:41] bone of his bone that i am a part of him
[1:22:43] that i am his help mate
[1:22:45] but let me tell you there's god if that
