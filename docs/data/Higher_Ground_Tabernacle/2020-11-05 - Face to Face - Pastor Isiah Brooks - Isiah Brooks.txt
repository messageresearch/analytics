we're just going to get right into the word of god we thank you for musicians for all that you do amen what a wonderful song service we've been having some good ones lately so we thank god for the brethren who sacrificed themselves with their talents we appreciate that amen we're going to be coming from ii john the 12th verse from there we'll go to proverbs 27. and then from there we'll go to second chronicles 13 10 and 11. you love the lord second epistles of john the 12th verse and it reads having many things to write unto you i would not write with paper and ink but i trust to come unto you and speak face to face that our joy may be full the children of thy elected sister greet thee amen one more uh let's go now to proverbs 27 19 proverbs 27 19. i love this scripture i've read it before but i'm gonna use it again for what we're doing tonight did i say proverbs 27 okay proverbs 27 19. and it reads as in water face answers to face so the heart of man to man ii chronicles the 13th chapter i'm glad that the lord god has grace and mercy he had to place us in this day and time because otherwise we would not have survived we are in an age and where the bible said we'll be wiser and weaker second chronicles 13 will read the 10th verse but as for us the lord is our god and we have not forsaken him and the priests which ministered unto the lord are the sons of aaron and the levites wait upon their business and they burn unto the lord every morning and every evening burnt sacrifice and sweet incense the shoe bread are also set they in order upon the pure table and the candlesticks of gold with the lamps thereof to burn every evening for we charge should be for we keep the charge of the lord our god but ye have forsaken him it does something let us have a word of prayer heavenly father we thank you right now for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us lord we come in a time the world is falling apart men is calling right wrong and wrong right they can't discern between good and evil have mercy upon us lord wash us clean cleanse us from all iniquity and any wicked thing we may do what we may have done let your blood lord jesus continue to be with us let your grace and your mercy o god abide with us day and night and father we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated just the other day i was thinking on the word and i was asking the lord in my spirit what is the time and why do we need to preach something different in such a simple way he spoke to my heart and said you are composed of body spirit and soul and each one of those rams have already been made manifest luther represented justification which was the body wesley represented sanctification which was the spirit and the pentecostals rep represented the baptism of the holy ghost which is so sold and if you notice that even in the diagram of the ark of the covenant or solomon's temple however you want to put it there was an outer court there was an intercourt and there was a holies of holies the outer court was where the brazen altar was that's when you came to christ and you justified and you died to yourself and your will and then you had to move into the holy place where the seven golden candlesticks were there you were to be sanctified and of course the journey wasn't complete until you got behind the veil of god which is the holies of holies what was preached to you at the brazen altar cannot be preached to you in the holy place and what is preached to you in the holy place cannot minister to you and will not be ministered to you in the holies of holies and you and i know that we've been talking about the statue of a perfect man i had uh brother john legue could do this for me and it was just the ideal thing of what i wanted because i wanted you to see that the the crowning or the capping of the pyramid was the mighty cloud of god in 1963 at his coming we know by god's grace that the world didn't see it but it was placed in a may 17 1963 life magazine on one page it was the seven angels in their display and on the other page it was the mighty rainbow just like he says in the book of revelation i wanted to be careful i have that book if anybody ever want to see it i wanted to be careful on how i'm saying things because before coming out here the word of god spoke to my heart not to casters pearls among swines and the reason why i say that because i know a lot of people are listening i say a lot but few of them are um you know we we we we must uh revere this message greater than we have been doing you remember the time when we our bibles were so reverent and revered hallowed you know we were we were very careful with it there was a time you know uh the children in in in in the house could play with every book but the bible it was a sacred book it was a holy book and you know it was so holy to us we carried it everywhere we went would go as a christian we want the shame of it y'all hear what i'm saying you and i must understand that this bible has changed those who claim to be christians have we say we're not ashamed of him but our action speaks louder than our words one thing i want to say is that we can't stay here you see the political realm moving everything's changing the move is on for the bride and if you think it's going to get better you are deceived it's going to get worse perhaps worse than you ever thought it could get uh would be even when this seven angels came down and displayed themselves out there in arizona around in mexico going up there like that and the bible uh we've been told that when you know judgment struck struck the west coast that uh california and washington almost sunk and judgment has been moving ever since but you've heard me say by god's grace that uh even the prophet of god did not even know what was taking place until the lord told him to turn it right and he kind of go over this in the message try to do godless service without his will in 1965 where the holy spirit said turn it right he thought maybe the voice means turn it to the right and when i did you see what it is hoffman head of christ at 33. here look in here see his black beard his face his eyes his nose and everything else see the part in his hair here coming up and he's wigged with that white angel wig to show that the message of him being god is true yes sir y'all believe he's god amen he is the supreme judge of the universe supreme judge of heaven and earth he is god and nothing else but god he is god expressed in human form called the son of god which the son was a man and if that don't make our message exactly right identified by the scriptures identified in service identified by his presence the same yesterday today and forever therefore those seven seals are the truth brethren might disagree with them but just set down and study it with your open heart one time just let the holy spirit lead you from you see he was really telling us there was a changing in the time and god was moving on the domination organization that's why they're all in such a state of apostasy and many of them are serving but they're serving the wrong god because according to revelations the third chapter jesus christ is outside of the door trying to get in what it is that we have pushed uh uh uh how could i say it everything in but christ we have made our church a setting for hollywood we have our dramas we have our actors we have our music we have our dancing we have everything that's gotten so bad to people are choreographing everything just like hollywood when they film i remember the time years ago i went to ptl just to visit them and i could remember the time that the choir would be singing oh my it sounds so spiritual and then they say cut then they stop singing and the choir go over there making jokes laughing and playing and when they try to tell them okay it's almost time to come back up on the stage they get up and they get back up there and they act it out again it was a sad experience for me to see that people had made god's business a business of acting oh and they could literally cry and they would bring the drama and they'd bring in all of the money you know and things what they do but god did catch up with them right they did fall i'm saying all of this because i read that first scripture so that you understand that there's an event taking place that we must understand that god god wants to see your face and god want to see you see his face and the bible tells us you know i love the scripture because every scripture testifies of jesus christ and as in water faith answers to face sow the heart of man to man one thing about the face it tells who you are and one thing about your face you know it when you see it and all the water is is a reflection of you and this is what god wants us to see that this body of christ you understand the body the body of christ goes all the way up but the head of the body is jesus christ is that the scripture so we understand that what happened is everything can become ritualistic and this is what happened to israel even during the time of jeroboam we find out that that the priest you know aaron and all of the rest had been faithful in their duties but to the people it became common and once this message become common to you you have forsaken god when it becomes common you reject your priesthood because the bible calls us priests and kings but the priests all of them at all time had to be sanctified they had to be cleansed they had to be proper in order to handle the working of the lord because that place was holy remember the time amen before the fall adam and eve was in a holy place a place of consecration a place where they could hear from god and and they could see his face because the bible said that his voice will walk in the cool of the evening but one day his voice walked the fellowship so he got to understand like this and i i'm going to come in just a moment god has come to establish or reestablish the fellowship with his wife his bride his people and god you know it's one of the worst things you can do and i have to pray about it sometimes because when when you're talking with someone they want to see you eye to eye they want to see your face and it's so rude when somebody's talking to you and you go this way or you go this way or you go this way and then you you realize that you you you you're being disrespectful especially when someone is talking to you and that's the way it is when we come to the bot to the church is god speaking it's not me i'm under an inspiration these are not my thoughts i i can't own them they're gods and when we began to speak amen if you can really revere it reverence it you'll walk out here in a different way face to face is my topic god wants to speak face to face with you hallelujah is that all right i can remember the bible says when adam and eve had fallen of course they had been used to the voice of god they fellowshipped with him and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cooler that went of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden and isn't that what that right that's what we do many people don't come to church because they're trying to hide right and a lot of times people don't really want the preacher to be anointed to preach he they really don't want you to go into their lives they're trying to hide but when you find yourself hiding it shows that you are naked somewhere satan has stripped you but the believer you and i would should always say amen to the word so be it lord if i'm naked clothe me and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou there was a question with the young people the other day why did god ask that question if he's god god knew where he was but god wanted to know wanted adam to know where he was adam was in a place he had never been before he had always been in the presence of the lord but now he's feeling something else he's feeling disconnected and the god that was once his friend he's now afraid of him because the word of god amen went out and said the day that you eat of this tree you should surely die and god never told adam at the time that he had a remedy hallelujah god never told him so adam no doubt but thinking i'm going to die but to his surprise when he should have died completely god managed to have grace slew a lamb and the blood was shed and he took that lamb and stripped him of his skin and wrapped adam and eve around it wrapped it around adam and eve and they walked out of the garden disconnected one thing about god he's a holy god and you know we look at this thing and we say oh brother brooks you know maybe you're too strict i cannot be strict enough the bible said holiness without no man shall see god holiness is not your outward appearance but holiness produce an outward appearance amen hallelujah people say well you can't judge me by the way i wear what i wear yes i can because whatever's out on the outside is an expression of what oh what's on the inside god is a holy god exodus 25 and 20 and the we we know what god did amen he he set those cherubims there at the garden of eden but during the time when the people uh didn't want to hear god god set up a system if i could say it like that a worship and he showed moses the tabernacle and told him the bill did according to the pattern moses did just that but one of the things that in the ark there of the covenant the bible said they were cherubims and these cherubims stretched forth their wings they were there with their wings touching each other hiding their face and they were looking at them each other as they covered the and the mercy sheets and all those things those uh uh how can i say uh furnitures and things were were made of gold overlaid with gold you know wood that was things that were made of shipping wood was then covered with gold and that them wood was to identify mankind we're just dead trees but then god will cover us with that gold from heaven amen and when he covers you and covers me we become deity it says the covering the wings on high they cut their wings covered the mercer sheet and to win their wings their faces they shall look one toward another and toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the terrorists be and thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark and in the ark thou shall put the testimony that i should give thee and what was the testimony about the word of god and there will i meet with thee in our commune with thee from above the mercy seat from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony of all these things which i give thee in the commandment of the children of israel as i said these instruments and this this box and everything was made out of wood and it was laid overlaid with gold thank god for the covering and as it said it speaks of deity but it also speaks a flesh becoming word this box that was covered was also crowned with a a golden lid covering and upon that we know that even when it when they would bring in the shoe bread think about it it was like common bread but it wasn't common because it was holy bread one of the things that you might not know about shoe bread is that when the when the priest would bring in the shoe bread they would bring it in half cooked half baked and the other half would be baked by the shekinah and so you say well what do you mean what was the difference because you got to understand that shoe bread was a bread of leavening in other words this bible represents the shoe bread and in its form it's half cooked half baked so what do you mean by that i mean that you can read this bible and won't get a thing from it until the kind of glory comes down on it and quickens this word gives you the full revelation of the word that's written in this book hallelujah so it showed that bread that bread laid out there on that golden lid and and here it is amen that bread y'all believe that if this if the shekinah glory can take aaron's rod and bring it back to life don't you think there's a kind of glory a man can cook bread or bake bread and it was a way god did things because that bread never molded it was on a pure table and that pure table was because the gold was pure and it showed that the only way that you can have fellowship here in this place your heart had to be pure is that right the bible says only the pure and heart shall see god hallelujah when you come to god you've got to come with no agenda um just as i am without one plea oh god your blood was shed for me hallelujah remember there's something is something special that something's happening here even in this time and in this in this dimension this is why so many people are stuck in their revelation it's not that the message is not right it's because we're not reverencing it we're not treating it in a holy way we're trying to handle it with unclean hands you can't do it god can't speak to you that way hallelujah if you approach god in such a way and then now if you were in the outer court he could take you by the brazen order but when you come into the holy place you got to be clean and don't even try going into the holies of holies because it was death automatically hallelujah you understand what i'm saying now you and i understand that all the bible is shadows and types in leviticus 24 and 5 i'm coming in just a moment and thou shalt take he was telling them how to make these cakes bread or how we want to put it he said thou should take fine flour and bake twelve cakes thereof two tenth deals shall be one cake and thou shalt set them in two rows six on a row upon the pure table before the lord now understand what he's doing here he's taking fine flour that fine flower that had been you know uh uh uh processed or made into this meal or this flower corn brother brandon said they were all about the same size the 12 loaves of cake represents the 12 tribes of israel what we call the patriarchs now watch this because he said they're measuring by two-tenths deal amen so two tenths in other words and then he says listen i want you to put them where in two rows six on a row i like that six here six here now understand one tenth is a tithing right two tenths represents both six and six you see what i'm saying but anyway god used this and and the part that i like about it he said i want you to also put some frankincense upon each row that it may be on the bread for a memorial even an offering made by fire there that's the fire again see the offering has to be made by fire now this frankincense also works uh represents worship so everything that you're doing is about worship is that right it's about worship worshiping you god himself and this is what israel god was showing israel there's a certain provided way to worship me and here it is and you couldn't just do it the way you wanted to do it like now you can't just worship god the way you want to the bible says they that worship the lord must worship him in spirit and in truth this is the hour of spirit and truth not just truth spirit and truth amen holy ghost and fire seeing him face to face remember the time when moses brought the children to mount sinai everybody wanted to see god everybody wanted to hear god and by the time it started lightning and thundering and the mountains shaking in the earthquake they were so afraid shut him up shut him up moses we don't want to hear him see that's what people say oh let me see god you don't want to sin because if you ain't right you're in trouble hallelujah he was so holy not even the the animals could touch the mountain if they touched the mountain beast ignorant beast they died holy that's the way i saw him holy is that right he said when the year in the year that isaiah died king does i die he said i saw the lord what was it he was high and lifted up and his train filled the temple hallelujah who's the train you are amen is that right that's what the scripture says in that new jerusalem will be dressed in white hallelujah and the train which is the people of god the bride of christ filled the temple frankincense is a beautiful thing isn't it i don't know i like frankincense it's not only just a a thing that you can use as a medicine but it also produces a nice fragrance i know some people who had uh a real uh eczema eczema and they used that frankincense and it really cleared them up you know the thing is i'm trying to say it's an old herb it used to be really expensive but now you can get it you know pretty much at a reasonable price i still think it's expensive a little bottle like that but nevertheless god knew what he was doing he was trying to say you cannot come in my present stinking you must be washed you can't come in my presence smelling like sin hello you must be clean hallelujah you think god don't smell he does he smells hallelujah now remember i i basically just quoted that but i'll say it again i'll read it from exodus 33 and 80 says and it came to pass when moses went out onto the tabernacle that all the people rose up and stood every man at his tent door and looked after moses until he was gone into the temple or tabernacle this is the thing that moses did the bible said moses was a man
