[9:51] Steve nning I was invited my wife and I
[9:56] were invited to a barn party if you will
[10:00] they have it every year and and
[10:03] sometimes a little needs me not to go
[10:06] other times he says it's to go and last
[10:11] night was he commanded me steps of a
[10:14] righteous man ordered by God we know
[10:16] that don't went and I went and I've been
[10:21] going to this off and on for since about
[10:24] your 2001 been invited and the reason
[10:28] I'm telling you because the
[10:31] manifestation of the Lord Jesus saw to
[10:33] be in us when we go to those parties and
[10:36] it happened very unique throughout the
[10:41] evening got there about six o'clock and
[10:43] and off and on brother I use the one
[10:48] that's still having these Bible studies
[10:50] these are people I've never had a Bible
[10:52] study was before ever
[10:53] and it happened half a dozen or more
[10:56] times and I just asked the Lord to show
[11:00] me what that is and you know the word
[11:03] says a letter killeth but the spirit
[11:06] years life so those men that were saying
[11:09] that to me we're getting that as a
[11:12] delivery from the Holy Spirit they
[11:16] that's the only way they knew that cuz
[11:17] I'd never I've never come in witness to
[11:20] them before and they received it and God
[11:24] has been having some ministry to them as
[11:28] I just give God all the praise and honor
[11:30] and glory for that little side note as I
[11:34] was entering into the this area of the
[11:39] barnyard and Lord said to me
[11:43] we go there for dinner and wanted to
[11:46] know what I wanted for dinner now keep
[11:49] in mind what I told him was something I
[11:51] rarely ever ordered over prepare for
[11:54] myself and it was jumbo shrimp and they
[11:59] were the biggest jumbo shrimp I've ever
[12:00] seen in my life
[12:01] walked in there so God knows the little
[12:05] things and the big in the in-between
[12:06] things and just lift it up to him and
[12:10] claim the victory Amen let's just go
[12:14] before the throne of grace and honor him
[12:19] lift up your hearts to him he's worthy
[12:23] to be praised father God we come to you
[12:27] this morning
[12:28] in the name of Jesus Christ under this
[12:32] perfect shed blood of the Lamb of God we
[12:38] thank you Lord for by your grace you've
[12:41] given us the token of the Holy Ghost and
[12:46] we come to you with that token Lord we
[12:50] thank you Lord for the words of life
[12:54] that you've placed in our heart and
[12:58] you've promised us Lord if we abide in

[13:34] whatever maybe or not and just put my
[13:36] hand on that place and just Lord you

[41:30] happier than what you came here
[41:34] and how you came in amen he loved the
[41:37] Lord we ministered on Wednesday a little
[41:46] thought the life we now live and I told
[41:50] you on Wednesday we were gonna finish it
[41:53] up I wanted to basically give this a
[42:01] second subject the most precious gift
[42:06] that God can give as we stand and turn
[42:14] to the Word of God
[42:17] we always appreciate that music whether
[42:23] it be guitar whether be piano
[42:25] it makes the service a whole lot better
[42:29] so we appreciate what God has given
[42:33] we're going to come to you from a
[42:35] familiar scripture acts 2 + 38 x2 and 38
[42:46] as we said on Wednesday to come into the
[42:53] presence of God with a sad countenance
[42:57] was not lawful in the Old Testament and
[43:03] actually the King could put you to death
[43:06] for doing so you and I must realize that
[43:10] God is a sensitive God and we should
[43:15] know by God's grace that when we come to
[43:18] the house of God we shouldn't have to
[43:22] come to be fixed but we should be fixed
[43:26] before we got to get here when we think
[43:31] about or have that thought we think
[43:35] about the woman at the well who was
[43:38] customed - going to the well ever so
[43:42] often to get her bucket full or filled
[43:45] but geez
[43:47] said unto her if you drink of this water
[43:50] you never thirst again our sadness and
[43:57] our lack of joy is not God's I would
[44:05] just a fault because the Bible tells us
[44:10] that if we stay in the presence of the
[44:12] Lord there's fullness of joy and God
[44:17] tells us if we keep our mind stayed on
[44:19] him he will give us perfect peace you
[44:25] see what brother Brooks how do I stay
[44:27] there you stay there by way of prayer
[44:30] you stay there by way of forgiveness you
[44:35] stay there by way of staying in his
[44:37] presence there's no way that you can
[44:39] actually stay in the presence of the
[44:41] Shekinah glory and not live in his
[44:44] presence is life and so we are at a time
[44:49] that we are embracing what we call the
[44:56] end and we must realize by God's grace
[45:02] that this walk isn't way is the harder
[45:07] way and God is not going to make it easy
[45:11] for you but there's only one way to make
[45:16] it and that is you must be filled and I
[45:21] don't mean a half cup half empty and
[45:23] half full I mean full so as we read Acts
[45:30] two and 38 let us read then Peter said
[45:34] unto them repent and be baptized every
[45:38] one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
[45:41] for the remission of sins ye shall
[45:44] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[45:48] the promise is unto you and to your
[45:52] children and to all there are far off
[45:56] even as many as the Lord our God
[46:00] shall call Psalm 63 and three it reads
[46:12] because thy loving-kindness is better
[46:15] that than life my lips shall praise thee
[46:21] I was wondering how many people have
[46:23] that attitude tonight and can really see
[46:26] the loving kindness of God and it's
[46:29] better than life now I understand what
[46:31] brother Browns going to break it down
[46:32] for us in just a moment
[46:34] thus I will bless thee while I live I
[46:40] will lift up my hands in thy name let us
[46:46] pray Heavenly Father we thank you for
[46:49] your amazing grace
[46:51] we thank you for your goodness we thank
[46:55] you for all the trials tribulations and
[46:59] things that we have to go through to
[47:03] make this journey you are the Potter we
[47:07] are the clay we ask God that you
[47:10] continue to mold us and make us what you
[47:13] would have to be you will have us to be
[47:16] no matter what the pain is no matter
[47:19] what the struggle of struggles are Paul
[47:23] says I have not seen nor ears have heard
[47:26] all of the things that you have in store
[47:29] for us and father we know that it's all
[47:33] is worth it all many have gone before us
[47:36] and have suffered in greater ways than
[47:39] we have but Lord at the end of the road
[47:44] at the crossing of the river just one
[47:47] moment in that presence seemed to make
[47:51] the trials and everything else fade away
[47:54] blessed us here this morning grant us
[47:58] victory in your name Jesus it's your
[48:00] work Lord as your people speak through
[48:03] our lips those things that you would
[48:04] have to be said let us not restrain from
[48:07] saying the things that you want to be
[48:09] seeing but father may we humble
[48:11] ourselves let that perfect
[48:14] be done in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[48:17] amen
[48:17] you may be seated you know when I think
[48:23] about the bride of Jesus Christ
[48:25] I guess my vision of it is so I have so
[48:28] different from everybody else and it's
[48:33] evident that all of us at some point in
[48:37] time fail to realize that there is an
[48:42] American spirit
[48:44] there's Babylonian spirit there is that
[48:50] Greek spirit all those great nations
[48:52] that once were those spirits still live
[48:56] and reign and you and I have been chosen
[49:01] by God to to live in such a horrible age
[49:06] brother Branham described it as the most
[49:08] evil age it is the age where Satan
[49:13] himself is God I'll call God now you say
[49:19] what do you mean because you can't be a
[49:22] god less there's someone there to
[49:25] worship you so in this age
[49:28] Satan is being worshipped and you and I
[49:34] have to be very careful that we don't
[49:36] worship Satan unknowingly I believe that
[49:44] if
[49:44] understood that when she broke the word
[49:46] she bowed down to the devil she was the
[49:51] first human to worship the devil and I
[49:58] don't think she realized it because you
[50:01] can't worship two gods at the same time
[50:04] the Bible says you can't serve Mammon
[50:07] and God at the same time you got to have
[50:09] one you've got to love and the other one
[50:10] you despise and you and I must realize a
[50:14] man that God has done a great work for
[50:18] us but I think we as the message people
[50:21] have have literally made this thing and
[50:24] allowed this thing to become common and
[50:27] with when something becomes common to
[50:30] you you were you you have a tendency to
[50:33] forget that is even there I don't know
[50:36] about you but you know I have a
[50:38] treadmill at the house and I got it
[50:40] offline and I got it for a good price
[50:42] and when I first got it I was so excited
[50:45] about it you know faithfully doing it
[50:49] all the time but now it's just a piece
[50:52] of furniture stuck in a corner and I
[50:56] walk by and I say sometimes I'm gonna
[50:59] get on you today I'm gonna get on you
[51:01] tomorrow
[51:02] and then when yesterday or the day
[51:03] before comes I you know what I'm saying
[51:06] and after a while it becomes out of
[51:08] sight out of mind you forget it's even
[51:11] there because it's become so common a
[51:14] lot of times or often times these things
[51:17] happen even in marriages individuals
[51:22] becomes common come on somebody y'all
[51:27] know how excited it was for those of us
[51:29] who who were first married and how great
[51:31] it was I've got a friend right now
[51:32] that'll be married next week and he's
[51:35] all excited and I'm thinking yeah
[51:36] brother keep going marriage is something
[51:41] that you have to water you have to give
[51:45] it some plant food every now and again
[51:48] and it works so
[51:50] both parts male and female and usually
[51:54] both of them are guilty but that's not
[51:57] what I come to talk about I came to talk
[51:59] about Jesus I was listening to the
[52:05] unrecognized and the unwanted and in the
[52:12] setting but the bottom is talking about
[52:14] Mary who went to Simon's house one thing
[52:21] I know about Jesus is that whenever you
[52:24] invite him he will come that's what the
[52:27] prophet of God says and that's what I
[52:28] believe Jesus is so on schedule if you
[52:34] tell God as we tell him I'm gonna be him
[52:37] prayer at five o'clock in the morning
[52:38] he's going to be there hallelujah and
[52:42] there have been so many times that I
[52:45] before I even got on my knees he was
[52:47] there and all I could do was weep coz he
[52:50] beat me there before I got there waiting
[52:54] on me and and and and so you don't tell
[52:57] me that if you invite Jesus he doesn't
[53:00] show up he always shows up and I heard
[53:06] brother Branham say this morning said
[53:08] even if you give him five minutes you
[53:11] ought to be faithful and giving him that
[53:12] five minutes cuz he's gonna be there for
[53:15] the five minutes you give him he said
[53:17] Jesus would take whatever you give him
[53:23] now when we talk about the most precious
[53:26] gift amen we know what that is if you
[53:31] had a million dollars what good will it
[53:33] do you if you don't have Christ is he
[53:40] David on
[53:41] Stewart being a king they had all of
[53:45] these I'm coming back to the woman
[53:46] because I want to show you something
[53:48] that we come in the church and we act
[53:51] just like the Pharisees you invited him
[53:54] here
[53:55] you expect to meet him here you know
[53:58] he's here because the Bible says so and
[54:01] we treat him like a man with dirty feet
[54:06] we don't annoy him we don't you know
[54:10] when do you see tears anymore but here
[54:14] was this woman Amen who recognized the
[54:17] importance of Jesus she didn't invite
[54:20] him but she came where he was invited
[54:22] and we find that we come in here amen
[54:26] and we love coming here in such a way
[54:29] with an attitude and we expect God to
[54:31] accept the sacrifice God loves sacrifice
[54:36] of fire I don't care how nicely it was
[54:40] laid out I don't care how perfectly the
[54:43] body parts were cut up there had to be
[54:47] fire and all the for that sacrifice to
[54:51] be consumed God had to send fire and in
[54:58] order for your church services to be
[55:01] succesfull before God you've got to
[55:04] bring fire this is the age of fire for
[55:08] the bride of Jesus Christ this is the
[55:10] age of fire you can't come in here cold
[55:15] and indifferent and expect God to bless
[55:18] you it ain't gonna happen God cannot
[55:23] change its mind about His Word and some
[55:28] of us will like the woman at the well
[55:29] you haven't met Jesus yet so you bring
[55:32] your bucket here Lord feel me I think
[55:37] you need to have a conversation with
[55:38] Jesus this morning because jesus said if
[55:43] you drink of this water you'll never
[55:45] thirst again see that's what happens
[55:49] what people backslide because amen they
[55:52] haven't drank of the water of
[55:55] I freely they haven't met Christ in the
[55:57] way that they should
[55:58] cuz the board cannot lie Caitlyn and the
[56:04] devil don't care
[56:05] I mean God you know how much even
[56:07] knowledge you know of this message and
[56:08] how you can tell what Jesus was born and
[56:11] you know how the calendar and the dates
[56:13] were changed after he died and he God
[56:16] don't care I mean the devil don't care
[56:17] if you know all of that he doesn't even
[56:20] care if you can revoke this Bible
[56:21] verbatim and know everything brother
[56:24] Branham said he just doesn't care the
[56:25] thing that the devil do care about is
[56:28] when a man can be broken when a man or a
[56:34] woman can be broken to the point a man
[56:37] that it pleases God because the Bible
[56:41] says amen it is a broken and contrite
[56:43] spirit that pleases God and when have we
[56:49] seen that last but when you really get
[56:52] into the presence of God brother Graham
[56:54] said a man if he could see Jesus one
[56:57] time he'll never be the same and as I
[57:01] said we don't understand what price it
[57:04] took and what price he had to pay to
[57:06] bring us to this point the Bible said we
[57:11] look at him you know and we see him in
[57:13] them you know and you know but you gotta
[57:16] understand that he did it all for you
[57:20] and I and we treat him with disrespect
[57:28] we always want somebody else amen to
[57:31] make me happy make me happy preacher
[57:33] make me happy bring some deep things but
[57:36] how are you gonna get the deep things
[57:38] and understand the deep things without
[57:40] the Christ in you the column I cannot
[57:43] proceed and understand those things
[57:46] which are of God I don't care how much
[57:48] you think you know you really don't know
[57:50] nothing until you get the Holy Ghost
[57:53] your Christianity is just potential it's
[57:58] a potential thing it ain't real until
[58:02] you get to God and God gets to you is
[58:06] that right Oh
[58:08] oh I don't know what God what I heard
[58:10] the probably God says even if you oh
[58:12] well what good will I do what good will
[58:15] it do me if I get the Holy Ghost he said
[58:16] I don't care I'm putting it in my own
[58:18] word but you can you can go listen to it
[58:20] amen I'll tell you what the message is
[58:22] but the point is and then you can he
[58:24] said it get what you can get if you get
[58:28] the Holy Ghost when you're all at least
[58:30] you know where you're going you may not
[58:33] be like Moses that apart the Red Sea
[58:36] hallelujah but you can be that little
[58:39] woman Amen bringing that little to mics
[58:41] hallelujah you see what I'm saying
[58:44] there's always a purpose for you but let
[58:48] us not be deceived millions died on the
[58:51] Moses how many died on even Joshua's
[58:56] ministry because they wouldn't get rid
[58:58] of the worldly things and you and I must
[59:03] understand by God's grace amen it's the
[59:05] life we live I marvel because the Bible
[59:13] said when they came on the day of
[59:15] Pentecost it meant that they was so
[59:18] drunk and brother branham goes on say
[59:19] they staggered like drunkards they
[59:22] jumped out of the windows they ran up
[59:25] the street but we have gotten so message
[59:28] crying that's my own phrase amen
[59:35] so we just sit here like Methodists you
[59:41] can't tell me there's not joy in him but
[59:44] if you have a mindset that I cannot
[59:47] enjoy this song Amen unless it's going a
[59:50] certain pace you need to be born again
[59:52] oh it it's gotta be something hey man
[59:57] where I can move you need the Holy Ghost
[1:00:00] because you're not moving by the spirit
[1:00:02] you're moving myself and whatever else
[1:00:06] it is you and I must realize by God's
[1:00:09] grace and then there is a life to live
[1:00:12] and God is looking for somebody to live
[1:00:16] it some
[1:00:19] who's not a shame I mean y'all know Hadi
[1:00:21] is the devil fights you in a restaurant
[1:00:25] you know when you got the prayed you
[1:00:27] know you look around and see if
[1:00:28] somebody's looking I've seen people do
[1:00:30] it hey man nobody wants to be loud
[1:00:35] hallelujah but their cackling like
[1:00:37] chickens in the restaurant and saying
[1:00:39] whatever they want to say but I hear
[1:00:41] people I even talk with Chris's when it
[1:00:43] comes to you know worshiping God all of
[1:00:45] a sudden they get quiet and they start
[1:00:48] talking about Jesus they don't want to
[1:00:49] be too loud that is the devil and the
[1:00:54] Bible said if you are saved of him in
[1:00:57] this adulterous generation he will be a
[1:01:00] shame of you why do you go to church Oh
[1:01:03] Mike this is what my church believe what
[1:01:07] an awful statement to me
[1:01:09] what do you believe then what is your
[1:01:14] relationship that's being the same of
[1:01:16] your husband your same of your husband
[1:01:19] or shame of your wife shame on you
[1:01:24] hello and if they don't like it you need
[1:01:29] to tell them this the way my husband
[1:01:31] like it you and I must understand Amen
[1:01:36] that listen the devil has no more power
[1:01:38] over you than what you give him being a
[1:01:45] brother was talking the other day and
[1:01:46] you know he willing to say you know it
[1:01:50] the one Amen that you feed the most
[1:01:52] where there's a black dog or the white
[1:01:55] dog I won't go on to say what I had to
[1:02:02] say but nevertheless the brothers say
[1:02:05] well I won't call him a back black dog
[1:02:07] no more I'll call him a Greenwood but
[1:02:10] you and I was realized by the grace of
[1:02:12] God it's the truth and he described the
[1:02:15] black dog because of the nature of the
[1:02:17] dog if you
[1:02:22] feed your nature of the world that's
[1:02:25] exactly what you're gonna get
[1:02:27] don't even expect to be a spiritual if
[1:02:30] you're gonna feed the carnal mind if
[1:02:34] you're gonna give the carnal mind
[1:02:35] whatever it thirst for don't expect to
[1:02:38] be spiritual because if that dog gets so
[1:02:42] big he will dominate the smaller when we
[1:02:49] talk about power understand Satan has no
[1:02:52] power as I said over you other than what
[1:02:54] you give him I really believe this that
[1:02:58] if a man is baptized in the name of
[1:03:00] Jesus Christ for the remission of his
[1:03:02] sins first of all if he's repented God
[1:03:06] is obligated to give him the Holy Ghost
[1:03:09] and brother Branham said if he's fully
[1:03:11] repented at the time that he in baptized
[1:03:13] God gives him the Holy Ghost he promised
[1:03:19] it and God's Word cannot come back boy
[1:03:24] what happens I was witness to a young
[1:03:28] man the other day and I said don't you
[1:03:29] know Satan only has power in this round
[1:03:33] he's lured over the dead if you want to
[1:03:36] put it that way
[1:03:37] hello the Bible says a woman who lives
[1:03:42] in pleasures already dead you can be a
[1:03:45] Jambi right now even if I use that term
[1:03:48] looking like you're live when you did
[1:03:53] the Bible says there was a church change
[1:03:55] that had the name that they live and
[1:03:57] they were dead another church a church
[1:04:01] age had the name that they lived and
[1:04:05] they were dead I wonder have that
[1:04:08] anointing in that spirit have not has it
[1:04:10] not coming to the message when you start
[1:04:15] preaching nobody gets excited anymore
[1:04:17] hardly any amens we don't worship with
[1:04:24] our mouth anymore we use our hands like
[1:04:26] it's going to cause so much energy to
[1:04:29] use your mouth to say Amen we don't
[1:04:32] holler get up out of the chair anymore
[1:04:37] when the Holy Spirit falls amen we let
[1:04:41] others enjoy Jesus while we sit back and
[1:04:43] observe shame on you the life you live
[1:04:49] you see yourself brother preacher how do
[1:04:52] you know these things because the way
[1:04:54] you come in here you come in here like
[1:04:57] you're dead no joy on your face you look
[1:05:03] at just preaching all we got to go
[1:05:05] through this again
[1:05:05] it has become a tradition I have it
[1:05:09] hello the love of God is fading away out
[1:05:13] of the people's heart and they don't
[1:05:15] even see it I don't mean to go this way
[1:05:21] I can't help in this I told my won't
[1:05:22] hold back but here David a man had a
[1:05:26] loving kindness there was something
[1:05:28] David knew that even just to get a
[1:05:30] little blessing from God he knows it was
[1:05:33] his kindness and not because he deserved
[1:05:35] it kindness God being gracious to me
[1:05:40] hallelujah I know my condition I know
[1:05:42] I'm a sinner I know I'm a rich I know
[1:05:44] where I stand with God and every one
[1:05:47] years for his loving kindness what was
[1:05:50] David said I'm a king I got people
[1:05:53] subject to me I can get what I want to
[1:05:57] judge by snap a finger and even with all
[1:06:02] that I have and all that I possess Lord
[1:06:06] my treasure is you the way you treat me
[1:06:11] the way you do me that's what I love
[1:06:15] about it heart because I realize I am
[1:06:18] wretched I am a worm I don't even
[1:06:23] deserve your loving-kindness now talking
[1:06:28] about loving-kindness this lady
[1:06:33] to church to receive of his
[1:06:35] loving-kindness for the Branham said she
[1:06:38] come in there and heard about about
[1:06:41] about Simon and and everything and knew
[1:06:43] something was going on and understood me
[1:06:45] the caliber of people that Simon
[1:06:48] associated with that's how some of us do
[1:06:51] we only associate with certain ones if
[1:06:54] they're part of me are part of my little
[1:06:56] group that's who we associate with we
[1:06:58] don't we don't break these boundary
[1:07:00] these little boundaries these little
[1:07:02] clicky things and you're wrong the Bible
[1:07:07] tells about one body and the Bible tells
[1:07:10] about stones that are knitted together a
[1:07:14] building who's who whom God is building
[1:07:17] and bringing us into a solid place you
[1:07:21] understand me
[1:07:22] I'm coming now we look at this thing we
[1:07:25] said ho she says look I know my
[1:07:27] condition and that's the trouble we have
[1:07:30] allowed ourselves to become self
[1:07:32] righteous and this woman knew her
[1:07:36] condition you'll never be able to
[1:07:38] worship God without seeing your
[1:07:39] condition you got to see what you are
[1:07:43] you got to understand who you are and
[1:07:46] because he meant you have not done a
[1:07:49] great sin like somebody else you got to
[1:07:52] realize I am still under the mercies and
[1:07:55] the grace of God that's the only way I'm
[1:07:57] gonna make it what has happened
[1:08:00] amen among the message we've gotten to
[1:08:02] them so many sweet candies and lollipops
[1:08:04] and everything else across the pulpit oh
[1:08:07] you justify this though you've never
[1:08:09] seen before so you go ahead and sing
[1:08:11] because you say I'm justified what a
[1:08:14] deception oh I was in the mind of God
[1:08:18] before the foundation of the world those
[1:08:20] things are true if you have the Holy
[1:08:24] Ghost hallelujah hey can I say that all
[1:08:30] right realize this morning Amen that
[1:08:32] Moses came to deliver Israel and all he
[1:08:37] got out of that was two
[1:08:42] all that millions that they had there
[1:08:44] two people inherited eternal life under
[1:08:50] the ministry of Moses the Bible said
[1:08:54] that all God in the wilderness guess
[1:08:59] what their complaint guess what this
[1:09:00] sends many of them many of them it was
[1:09:02] an adultery and fornication and things
[1:09:04] like that you know what it was
[1:09:05] murmuring and complaining and God look
[1:09:11] at that in a horrible way
[1:09:13] ah because you don't trust him how can
[1:09:19] you worship something who that you don't
[1:09:20] trust but look at this woman amen she
[1:09:25] didn't know Jesus but she heard of his
[1:09:27] reputation and all of the things that he
[1:09:29] had done already
[1:09:30] and she goes and gets her night wages
[1:09:34] and she realized hey men I've seen of
[1:09:39] her
[1:09:39] his desire he's right he's accurate he
[1:09:42] knows and when I get there how would we
[1:09:45] see this money see this was a prostitute
[1:09:51] this was a lady who was known as the
[1:09:54] ill-fame woman in the world but God had
[1:09:59] an elected she God had a chosen seed in
[1:10:03] that woman and let me tell you like this
[1:10:05] money it doesn't matter how badly you
[1:10:08] have sinned
[1:10:09] it doesn't matter there's that the grace
[1:10:12] of God will cause you to overcome
[1:10:14] everything many of us we still living in
[1:10:19] an hour pass on what we used to do and
[1:10:21] why we did this net I thought the man
[1:10:24] was dead
[1:10:26] hallelujah God so design man when he
[1:10:30] died he put bombs in him so the wives
[1:10:32] could get rid of all the evidence
[1:10:36] hallelujah that wanna eat you so that
[1:10:39] are the only thing that you have left as
[1:10:41] a skeleton and if it goes longer than
[1:10:44] that dust but he gets rid of it who
[1:10:48] who's who's if you didn't have a name on
[1:10:50] the corner somewhere near it
[1:10:52] you wouldn't know who that was I used to
[1:10:54] be
[1:10:55] that's the way God wants amended us to
[1:10:59] surrender so much to the word amen that
[1:11:02] will forget what we used to be because
[1:11:07] as long as the devil can bring you to a
[1:11:09] place in your mind to make you think
[1:11:12] that you still the same person he's
[1:11:14] going to do it and guess what you will
[1:11:18] continue to do the same sin as long as
[1:11:22] you believe you are the same person all
[1:11:26] right so when we come amen
[1:11:29] to this life what we're going to do
[1:11:30] about it are we going to live for Jesus
[1:11:33] or are we gonna be just church members I
[1:11:36] refuse to be a church member
[1:11:38] I refuse just to be a church member
[1:11:42] because God has given me something more
[1:11:44] than just being a church member let me
[1:11:47] go all to note let you see because I
[1:11:50] want to know when when God tells the
[1:11:51] devil stop he has to stop understand
[1:11:57] Satan
[1:11:58] amen is in the hands of God he's God
[1:12:00] tool and that devil can't do no more to
[1:12:04] you than God allows him to understand
[1:12:08] trials and tribulation I heard a brother
[1:12:10] saying Amen is basically the path
[1:12:12] platform for testimonies you have no
[1:12:17] test you have no testimony and you and I
[1:12:22] must realized by God's grace the Bible
[1:12:24] says that all things work together for
[1:12:26] the good of them that love the Lord I
[1:12:31] believe that you said everything you go
[1:12:35] through brother Bruce you feel like
[1:12:37] shouting no but there's a deep in the
[1:12:41] side of me that always speaks peace is
[1:12:48] that right now let me move on because I
[1:12:51] want you to understand that the devil he
[1:12:53] does have power in the sense of death
[1:12:56] but God has the keys he's still in his
[1:13:00] office but God has the keys and one day
[1:13:04] death hell and the grave would be thrown
[1:13:07] into the lake of fire
[1:13:09] but right now he holds his office though
[1:13:11] he doesn't have power in his office
[1:13:14] basically a figurehead is what he is and
[1:13:17] God is the head of all things is that
[1:13:20] the Bible the Bible said of all
[1:13:21] principalities God is the head of it I
[1:13:24] don't camp that demons from Hell God is
[1:13:27] the head and he says in that day every

[1:22:15] exactly where we should have been when
[1:22:17] the bus pass all we could do is wait
[1:22:22] hallelujah so what I'm trying to say
[1:22:24] it's not that I'm almost at it I must be
[1:22:28] there when the rapture takes place

[1:22:52] through stuff crazy stuff hallelujah if
[1:22:55] you don't realize the crazy stuff that
[1:22:57] you coming through is right out of the
[1:22:58] depths of hell then you blind it ain't
[1:23:02] your brother it ain't your sister it's
[1:23:05] demon power hello and understand this I
[1:23:14] don't care a man and woman cannot be
[1:23:16] delivered to God says so Oh Lord why
[1:23:30] would this man heal because he had
[1:23:33] epilepsy why wasn't he healed jesus said
[1:23:36] these kind come out by fasting and
[1:23:38] praying hello now I'm a message people
[1:23:43] we don't fast well that's why they don't
[1:23:45] come out because the Bible is right is
[1:23:51] that right the Bible is right you won't
[1:23:53] changes in your life you got to do it
[1:23:55] the Bible a oh come on if I have the
[1:23:59] faith love you got the faith you don't
[1:24:00] want to worry about it because they're
[1:24:02] measures of faith but there are some of
[1:24:05] us who have to fast and pray to get
[1:24:06] there
[1:24:08] hello God always vindicate truth in it I
[1:24:12] feel that that I feel like I've been
[1:24:14] feel they're dropping a little bit so
[1:24:16] I'm a hurry
[1:24:17] God where God we are always finding it
[1:24:20] he don't vindicate truth I don't care
[1:24:22] what it is he's gonna Ben de Kate true
[1:24:24] if you are a sinner he will vindicate
[1:24:28] truth whatever truth is he is going to
[1:24:32] vindicate it because God is truth hmm
[1:24:36] and your faith must be based upon the
[1:24:41] solid word that's eternal life
[1:24:45] a brother was saying I was witness he
[1:24:47] said well well who created God I said
[1:24:49] nobody created God he's eternal he said
[1:24:52] whatever I say see that's the point
[1:24:54] that's why he said faith faith is the
[1:24:58] one that can believe without evidence
[1:25:00] but once you believe it then God will
[1:25:03] manifest it and I told him I said I want
[1:25:06] you to understand I came to that point
[1:25:09] in my life to of God you know if God
[1:25:11] created god creator that's great but but
[1:25:13] who created God I said it's probably
[1:25:16] something that you'll never know because
[1:25:20] God was not not a creation God was self
[1:25:24] existent and how look peanut Minds
[1:25:26] cannot even understand that at all just
[1:25:30] like you and I cannot understand space
[1:25:32] how can space be you understand me but
[1:25:39] you got to understand God even occupied
[1:25:41] space space is never empty because God
[1:25:45] is there space is something created for
[1:25:49] us not God because the Bible said he
[1:25:51] feels all and in all everywhere God is
[1:25:56] that's what David said if I made my bed
[1:25:59] in hell God is there and I want you to
[1:26:02] understand there's nothing outside of
[1:26:04] God everything that's created was inside
[1:26:06] of him
[1:26:10] hallelujah you were there but you
[1:26:14] understand you know you still get you
[1:26:17] need the Holy Ghost you said what do you
[1:26:20] mean Jesus was a very well
[1:26:22] tired of God spoken word of God
[1:26:24] prophesied he was coming but he did not
[1:26:28] get the Holy Ghost until he was 30 years
[1:26:30] old he was trained he was tutored he was
[1:26:40] tested because God then said this is my
[1:26:43] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to
[1:26:46] dwell in at some point in time God
[1:26:50] stepped in and you and I must understand
[1:26:54] by the grace of God
[1:26:56] it meant that Jesus had so much faith in
[1:26:58] in his father if I could say like that
[1:27:01] he taught as a child in the temple as a
[1:27:04] child at 12 years old and you remember
[1:27:09] the first miracle don't raise your hand
[1:27:12] but I cuz I believe everybody got to
[1:27:13] know the first one hello water into wine
[1:27:18] noted miracle if there was any other we
[1:27:22] don't know about it but noted miracle he
[1:27:25] turned water into wine and Jesus said to
[1:27:29] his mother what you're trying to do get
[1:27:31] me to do something before my time but
[1:27:34] you see the faith of God was there my
[1:27:39] point is there was in his life nothing
[1:27:42] but God but God had to show you a man
[1:27:45] yielded that's why he was a man so that
[1:27:48] you can see what he requires of us as
[1:27:52] men God requires us to be yielded jesus
[1:27:55] said i could do nothing except my father
[1:27:57] show me hallelujah and when i see the
[1:28:01] father work i go and work - is that
[1:28:04] right then the prophet of god comes with
[1:28:06] that same anointing God would give him a
[1:28:09] vision because we didn't know what that
[1:28:11] mean when I see my father working I
[1:28:12] wouldn't work here the - we didn't
[1:28:14] understand that and then God comes along
[1:28:16] he mention to us a prophet in our day
[1:28:18] who's under the same kind of a ministry
[1:28:23] but brother Branham even had to operate
[1:28:26] according to the mission because the
[1:28:28] vision was what God showed him I
[1:28:31] remember the little baby that God wanted
[1:28:34] to heal and he went before God
[1:28:35] baby he acted before the baby before God
[1:28:39] before the vision was complete the old
[1:28:42] lady had to be sitting in the chair this
[1:28:44] one had to be here in there and
[1:28:45] everything before he could be healed God
[1:28:47] showed that everything he showed him had
[1:28:49] to be exactly now if that is true if God
[1:28:55] said you've got to be perfect you must
[1:28:57] be perfect
[1:28:58] oh I am NOT talking about a perfect in
[1:29:01] your flesh your flesh will never be
[1:29:03] perfect
[1:29:04] that's what Paul said I've got to die
[1:29:06] daily every day I've got a crucifying
[1:29:09] this flesh because if you don't crucify
[1:29:11] him daily he's gonna live I don't care
[1:29:15] how much holy goes you got if you do not
[1:29:18] crucify the devil if you don't take this
[1:29:21] flesh and put it on this objection that
[1:29:23] is why the devil is raining so much
[1:29:24] because we don't pray and kill him every
[1:29:26] day
[1:29:27] I don't know why I'm thinking like this
[1:29:31] because you didn't you didn't go to
[1:29:32] prayer you rose up with a new
[1:29:35] resurrection supposedly but you didn't
[1:29:39] have the new resurrection amen of the
[1:29:41] con you should have if you don't make
[1:29:43] sure that you left him in the tomb the
[1:29:47] devil has to be put to shame every day
[1:29:50] you love the Lord now imma quit now imma
[1:29:53] quit because it will finish up this this
[1:29:55] evening laws willing ah Bethlehem says
[1:30:00] Amen in the message in time sciency he
[1:30:02] said so Christians are known by the
[1:30:04] fruit of the Holy Spirit
[1:30:06] that's what dominates a Christian life
[1:30:09] proves what years and the fruit of the
[1:30:15] Spirit is love joy peace faith
[1:30:16] long-suffering goodness gentleness
[1:30:19] patience in the Holy Spirit those fruits
[1:30:21] manifest themselves through Chris
[1:30:24] Christians and you know what we message
[1:30:26] people do well you know brother Branham
[1:30:28] says which he did that Christian life
[1:30:32] can produce these things the same kinds
[1:30:35] of effects who cares about Christian
[1:30:39] life Christian Science Christian Science
[1:30:43] so therefore that's your excuse for not
[1:30:46] doing it
[1:30:48] is that your excuse for not living it
[1:30:50] because you think these things will be
[1:30:52] done by psychology so it doesn't prove
[1:30:56] that I'm truly a Christian if I can do
[1:30:58] it well that's right but if the life of
[1:31:01] God is not in you
[1:31:03] you're not gonna produce it anyhow
[1:31:07] worried about producing it cuz only the
[1:31:10] life of God the lot is that right he
[1:31:13] said I am the branch yeah the vine if
[1:31:15] you abide in me right the line he said
[1:31:19] listen you can't do nothing without me
[1:31:22] that's what he said st. John 17 I'm
[1:31:25] almost done you saw our brothers what
[1:31:29] what about we talk about Old Testament
[1:31:33] and things of that nature and I'm
[1:31:34] telling you this message can unlock some
[1:31:36] mighty mysteries but my point is what is
[1:31:39] all these mysteries gonna do for you if
[1:31:41] you have not died if you haven't rotted
[1:31:45] if you haven't allowed God to come in
[1:31:47] your life what what all these mysteries
[1:31:49] gonna do for you I'm gonna tell you what
[1:31:51] they can do for you Paul said you can
[1:31:53] understand all mysteries and have not
[1:31:55] charity which is love which is divine
[1:31:57] love hmm well I'm gonna tell y'all
[1:32:00] something brother branham not only had
[1:32:02] love for people but he had love for
[1:32:04] animals his love projected even to
[1:32:09] animals why because God loved animals he
[1:32:16] had the attitude i'ma kill this bull me
[1:32:19] and the Holy Ghost come dropping in on
[1:32:22] him see that first thought the devil
[1:32:25] will allow you to think it he'll come
[1:32:27] and boom hit you with it but if the Holy
[1:32:29] Ghost is there it makes that thing
[1:32:31] surrender the Holy Ghost will always
[1:32:35] bring every even thought and imagination
[1:32:36] under under the Word of God the Holy
[1:32:40] Ghost will always cause you to humble
[1:32:42] yourself if you got it it will cause you
[1:32:45] to harm yourself why because the Bible
[1:32:47] said follow peace with all men hello
[1:32:50] holiness without no man should see the
[1:32:53] Lord follow peace with all men hello
[1:32:59] hey oh I'm coming to church today with
[1:33:01] an attitude and I ain't gonna speak to
[1:33:02] brother Brooks
[1:33:03] well you think that's gonna hurt it
[1:33:07] ain't hurting me because I'm an
[1:33:09] overcomer the person is hurting is you
[1:33:15] understand what I'm saying
[1:33:17] I use myself as an example but that
[1:33:19] could be an attitude toward anybody your
[1:33:23] own you're even wrong if you think
[1:33:28] somebody's going to hell if you got in
[1:33:32] your mind that somebody's going to hell
[1:33:34] saving them put in your mind that
[1:33:35] somebody's going to hell and I'm going
[1:33:37] to heaven you are wrong the Bible said
[1:33:41] if you call your brother
[1:33:42] a ray cut off who you are in danger of
[1:33:45] Hell fire yourself because not one of us
[1:33:50] have a right to say oh brother you so
[1:33:52] wicked you going to hell
[1:33:58] I'm just saying that attitude did not
[1:34:02] come from God they could have looked
[1:34:08] they could have looked at our
[1:34:11] what's-his-name East Jacob so you know
[1:34:15] he ain't no trouble child bad as he is
[1:34:19] he's a thief shyster he who watch him he
[1:34:22] sneaky but guess what he was the real
[1:34:30] one y'all know we do it we start
[1:34:35] pointing our fingers at things and
[1:34:36] people right like they said when you do
[1:34:40] that you got how many important that you
[1:34:42] how many how many closing on this
[1:34:52] thought that woman got down to Jesus
[1:34:58] feet I use the example last from
[1:35:03] Wednesday about David how he was caught
[1:35:05] in adultery and you know here here was
[1:35:08] Nathan saying well you know there's a
[1:35:10] rich man and he had all these you lambs
[1:35:11] and this that and the other and and and
[1:35:13] instead of taking his lamb he got
[1:35:15] somebody his friend whatever lamp and
[1:35:17] took it in killing I only had one and
[1:35:19] this lamb was so important to this man
[1:35:21] and you know he's like part of the
[1:35:22] family and yeah instead of David taking
[1:35:24] one of his own you lambs he took this
[1:35:26] lemon and he cumin a meaning prepared of
[1:35:29] and and and and then David said that man
[1:35:32] ought to die whoever he don't we do that
[1:35:40] don't we do that we rather just give a
[1:35:43] person a death sentence but when we sin
[1:35:46] we won't grace and mercy huh it's the
[1:35:51] truth when we sin we want great golden
[1:35:53] Lord Amber's and we've forgotten that we
[1:35:55] done condemned others I've heard people
[1:35:58] say well you see that's you know because
[1:36:00] they didn't follow me that's what
[1:36:02] happened to him
[1:36:03] you know they got sick God's judgment
[1:36:05] and then when they get sick they don't
[1:36:06] say is God's judgment anybody's God is
[1:36:10] judging everybody else right and then
[1:36:13] Nathan saying well I mean the prophet of
[1:36:16] God said to David Nathan said under
[1:36:21] David what
[1:36:22] now out the man I guess his distance has
[1:36:25] changed in it see when you win the
[1:36:28] winner something comes you you it
[1:36:31] somehow it changes and what is God is
[1:36:34] trying to do get rid of the
[1:36:35] self-righteousness get rid of this
[1:36:38] pretense of holiness holiness doesn't
[1:36:44] mind real holiness if I could say it
[1:36:46] like this doesn't mind being among the
[1:36:48] dirty because holiness can never be
[1:36:51] affected if you truly see what the Holy
[1:36:55] Ghost you can you can now marry to wash
[1:36:58] your feet you can go with the sinners
[1:37:01] and the publicans because you know that
[1:37:03] you being salty and you're there for a
[1:37:07] purpose and that is to draw them to
[1:37:08] Christ hmm but this woman was so about
[1:37:13] Jesus she pressed her way brother and
[1:37:15] said she elbowed herself through the
[1:37:17] crowd and sometimes you have to do that
[1:37:18] in this service specialist church
[1:37:20] sometimes you wonder you coming here
[1:37:22] you're happy me before you get here and
[1:37:24] then you get up in here and everybody
[1:37:25] all quiet and like you know and I'm like
[1:37:28] oh my I can feel it that's why sometimes
[1:37:32] I look like I come up in a little
[1:37:34] radical because I'm trying to bring the
[1:37:38] holy spirit the level of the spirit up
[1:37:39] in order here you hear what I'm saying
[1:37:42] and you and I must get rid of everything
[1:37:45] that's not like the odd people I'm
[1:37:48] preaching on me this world is cutting
[1:37:51] both ways I don't have one single person
[1:37:54] in my mind it's all about us if my body
[1:37:58] is sick I'm feeling the pain my thing is
[1:38:05] I'm gonna tell you something I'm gonna
[1:38:06] tell y'all something what you may not
[1:38:08] know you may know it in your mind but
[1:38:12] when you going through trials and you
[1:38:15] give God the sacrifice of praise I'm
[1:38:21] telling
[1:38:21] those walls gonna come down you don't
[1:38:26] just wallow like the pig or some
[1:38:28] something oh and y'all know what I'm
[1:38:30] saying you know you got your plate where
[1:38:32] you want to wallow ain't gonna help you
[1:38:39] nothing cuz you know why you're you
[1:38:42] displaying unbelief it's nothing wrong
[1:38:48] if you're gonna cry in faith but you're
[1:38:51] gonna cry with unbelief how you gonna
[1:38:53] please God we wallow in it we weren't
[1:39:00] waiting on God and God said I'm waiting
[1:39:01] on you till you get your act together
[1:39:03] it's the truth you see these little kids
[1:39:09] you know stomping and crying and falling
[1:39:11] out because you won't get him a piece of
[1:39:12] candy in the stove mm-hmm in my day when
[1:39:17] they went down on the floor my mom went
[1:39:19] down there with it she came she came
[1:39:22] with that up lifter will lift you right
[1:39:24] on up we don't whip them enough Peter
[1:39:29] don't grip your kids you don't whip them
[1:39:31] you're gonna have trouble down the road
[1:39:32] when they get older they gonna show what
[1:39:36] they really made out of because you
[1:39:37] didn't correct them you didn't get those
[1:39:39] demons out of them and so when they get
[1:39:41] older the demons gonna manifest
[1:39:42] themselves I know what I'm talking about
[1:39:47] I'm closing now well my point is this
[1:39:49] you know blessed are those who come to
[1:39:51] church and they know they were out
[1:39:54] hallelujah it's the truth there's a
[1:39:58] blessing in it when you make a sacrifice
[1:40:00] to the Lord God will bless you the life
[1:40:04] you now live the greatest life the
[1:40:07] greatest gift God can give you now you
[1:40:08] have opportunity where God is saying is
[1:40:10] yours whosoever will let him come it's
[1:40:14] yours right it's up to you to receive it
[1:40:19] to take it it is up to you to when you
[1:40:22] take it you know brother I'm said at
[1:40:23] least he said don't worry about no order
[1:40:25] that's what gets on my nerve if I could
[1:40:27] say like that my spirits are nerd you
[1:40:30] know I get to a place where you know of
[1:40:32] people
[1:40:34] don't get me wrong some people we made
[1:40:36] up differently and I and I'm not trying
[1:40:38] to say this you know you you have a
[1:40:41] certain cookie cutter way of doing
[1:40:42] things no but everybody has to come to
[1:40:45] the place where they get out of their
[1:40:47] comfort zone as long as you are in your
[1:40:50] comfort zone
[1:40:51] God can use you he can't work with you
[1:40:54] he had to take those Jews out of their
[1:40:56] comfort zone he did
[1:41:00] Jews are staunch II people but nowadays
[1:41:03] got more Liberty to him or something but
[1:41:05] my point is when it comes to worship you
[1:41:07] know anybody could you're not so brother
[1:41:09] I'd say they were starchy there was
[1:41:10] really starchy people and and and for
[1:41:13] the Holy Ghost to come in there and they
[1:41:15] stay in that room aha ten days I don't
[1:41:17] know how long and what they did and all
[1:41:19] they fasted and prayed and whatever they
[1:41:21] did and there were time they thought is
[1:41:23] this it is that here you let me tell you
[1:41:25] something when it comes you to have to
[1:41:27] worry about is that it
[1:41:29] pijo Peter and then when on the day of
[1:41:32] Pentecost he said well if death
[1:41:33] no he said this is that the
[1:41:37] manifestation of Joelle is now on
[1:41:42] display this is that and that's what we
[1:41:46] supposed to get that brother branham
[1:41:50] said to he's and I if this ain't that I
[1:41:51] keep this to that color
[1:41:55] peeps a well Bob that ain't that ain't
[1:41:57] time yeah and then they say that thing
[1:42:01] oh my god how people say I hadn't heard
[1:42:07] in a while you know that ain't they said
[1:42:09] what that ain't that ain't my style or
[1:42:11] that ain't my character or something
[1:42:13] they say you know I've heard sisters say
[1:42:16] that oh why you don't worship and praise
[1:42:19] the Lord you know and I seen God use
[1:42:21] them at times and they feel like you
[1:42:23] know they don't got out of all that
[1:42:24] pride keeps back in and said what would
[1:42:26] that ain't my how do you ever they say a
[1:42:28] character something and you know my
[1:42:30] thing is you already loud I hate to hear
[1:42:37] what a loud woman said well that that
[1:42:39] ain't my character you already loud you
[1:42:43] ought to get loud for garden
[1:42:47] oh brother you know what I'm saying I
[1:42:50] don't tell I tell you to let stay but I
[1:42:53] tell you this I used to get so
[1:42:55] spiritually upset when I would hear
[1:42:59] these brothers talking about oh did you
[1:43:01] see that game I mean oh did you see that
[1:43:04] no they played this and that in the
[1:43:06] other and I can't stand to hear
[1:43:08] Christian talk about all the star and
[1:43:11] that star and this thing and they doing
[1:43:13] this now how do you get time for that oh
[1:43:21] I'm a bull I ain't no bull if I had a
[1:43:28] mascot it would be an equal on dog or

[1:43:38] point is where do people get time I
[1:43:41] don't know but they find it and like I
[1:43:46] said now are you entertaining yourself
[1:43:48] with something that's not even
[1:43:49] glorifying God and God ain't even in the
[1:43:52] picture
[1:43:52] it's worldliness that's the way I see it
[1:43:55] I've always seen it that way I ain't
[1:43:57] trying to condemn you but I'm just
[1:43:59] saying somewhere in your life the Holy
[1:44:01] Ghost is gonna move that out of the way
[1:44:04] got it out to the world and everything
[1:44:06] of the world let us bow our heads here I
[1:44:14] don't know the issues there are many
[1:44:16] things I wanted to say there was
[1:44:19] something I I just feel I wanted to say
[1:44:26] but
[1:44:26] feel led to hold off for a moment for a
[1:44:29] space I'd like to be confidence in the
[1:44:33] things that I do but let's pray dear
[1:44:38] dear Jesus a lot was said here this
[1:44:44] morning I trusted I stayed with in the
[1:44:48] place you wanted me to stay I know I get
[1:44:52] excited sometimes in a project my voice
[1:44:55] in ways that I don't mean to do such a
[1:44:57] sucker can't help it art but father I
[1:45:02] pray that you would bless the people

[1:45:13] a call an election sure and father
[1:45:17] there's not enough to allow it to be in
[1:45:19] Satan Eden but to allow Satan to break
[1:45:21] into our house and rob us of our joy
[1:45:23] robbers are from our peace robbers from
[1:45:26] our rejoicing it's just not right
[1:45:29] Lord I'm not saying the people are not

[1:46:10] here love you but we have allowed Satan
[1:46:13] to distract us we have become
[1:46:18] complacent Lord we we just common Church
[1:46:21] has become traditional and father you
[1:46:23] said when it comes to that it becomes a
[1:46:26] stench in your nostril it is a very
[1:46:29] thing that Israel did Lord services had
[1:46:32] no feeling to it had no meaning to it
[1:46:36] many people dread to come to church but
[1:46:39] they come to church because of their
[1:46:41] pride because they realized that they
[1:46:42] don't come the church people will then
[1:46:44] see how backslidden they are help us

[1:46:52] cleanse us from all our righteousness we
[1:47:00] are needy people this morning and I know

[1:47:07] encouraging to strengthen your people we
[1:47:11] realize how Satan has beat us throughout
[1:47:13] the day and many of us are weary
[1:47:15] fighting but may us may we find that
[1:47:19] place of rest may we find that secret
[1:47:23] place to hide
[1:47:26] Lord we ourselves are in danger even as
[1:47:34] Paul says I must be careful lest I
[1:47:37] become a castaway oh jesus help us

[1:47:56] powers are everywhere a precedent known
[1:47:58] as dayley Lord trying to strip us from
[1:48:01] our joy because the Word of God said he
[1:48:03] would have that space where many the
[1:48:08] love of many shall wax cold let us not
[1:48:11] be one of them Lord let us be on fire
[1:48:14] for you the life we live may be a
