let's open our bubbles in the book of Exodus man standing open our bubbles in the book of Exodus we read the chapter 12. and verse 11 to verse 13. Exodus chapter 12 verse 11 to verse 13. amen the Bible says and thus shall ye eat it with your loins girded and your shoes and your feet and your staff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover for I will not for it I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and was Milo the first born in the land of Egypt both men and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt anyway let's go to Hebrews read chapter chapter 9 verse 11 to verse 15. Hebrews chapter 9 verse 11 to verse 15. the Bible says but Christ being by cross being come and high priest of good things to come by greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calls but by his own blood he entered in he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us amen I just love how the Bible says that Eternal Redemption I mean it's not something that that has a time limit to it amen when you're redeemed it's Eternal you're not going back to to sin amen for if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of heifer sprinting the unclean sanctifiers to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament which also means the New Covenant which is the grace the Covenant of Grace that that by by means uh uh I'm sorry and for this cause he's the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance amen that's bald heads the heavenly father Lord we just read your word father God we ask you Lord to be with us Lord this night Lord Jesus we pray father God that you come and you open this word to us Lord Lord we pray father God that you come and you teach us your word O Lord that you explain it to us Lord and you reveal it to us Lord Lord and let it be a blessing father God for everybody in here father God and those who will those who are listening father God on YouTube and those who will listen to it afterward though we pray father Lord that you continue to be with us Lord you helped me Father God to be so sensitive to the Holy Spirit father God that I can say exactly what you want me to say father Lord we pray that Lord your spirit be with us Lord in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen I mean you might be seated and when this uh evening we have a little subject that we wanted to share with you that we entirely Redemption by Blood and by power amen I will try to do a little bible study this evening so I'll pray that you bear with me because I will read a lot and amen uh a lot of you know Bible verses and quotes of the prophet and just try to explain you know a little part or a partial party of redemption because Redemption it's a it's a really huge subject and uh and it's hard to explain it all and I'm pretty sure that it's impossible to explain it all amen we can just uh take a little and you know an angle and then just try to uh to go with it amen well try this uh this evening to speak about Redemption by Blood and by power I meant because uh where we read in Exodus chapter 12 in in Hebrews chapter I'm sorry Exodus chapter 12 we understand that there is something that uh that really when I read it uh it kind of Hit me hard because you will see that when God told the children of Israel to apply the blood amen he told them to apply the blood and when he will see the blood amen it's the blood that you have to apply the token and that token has to be seen from the outside amen God wasn't gonna go inside the house to check if the blood was applied amen but he wanted to see the blood from the outside when he will see it from the outside then he will go through amen he will pass over amen it's the same thing with rehab amen one day the children of Israel told her to you know to uh uh to put that sign that token I think it was a a Scarlet thread it meant in the window amen so that from the outside they could see it that this this house can't be touched I mean it's it's a token it's something that has to be applied it meant people has to be these people has to see it from you know from the outside so by definition we know that Redemption means the action of regaining possession of something in exchange for payments or clearing the debt amen you have to regain something that you have lost amen it's just it's just it's like a a lost and found section amen you have to found something that you had before amen you have to redeem something that you had before so amen so you have you had to have that thing before Amen in order for you to read it to be able to redeem it because when you are redeemed amen it's not something new you're not getting something new remember you're just getting something that you lost before amen so the Bible teaches us different types of redemption amen throughout the Bible you have one um that I think it's called the sabbatic year which means that the children of Israel had to sow for six years in a row and and then they had to rest for the seventh year I mean on the seventh year they were not supposed to sow any seed amen because uh uh the land had to be redeemed I mean the land had to rest uh go through that part of redemption I forgot the the actual word of it uh where the land had to go uh uh rest and be redeemed so that the land can recover from all the the the chemical uh nutritions that he had lost throughout those six years and and the Bible says that you know in that sixth year it might because God told them not to sow or not to do not to work on the seventh day on the seventh year amen God was blessing them for three years in a row amen they had to have food for the sixth year for the seventh year and for the eighth year which is the first year amen and God had to supply to their needs and by the second one there's a uh the Year of Jubilee which is the 50th year of it which is the fifth year year which is uh uh after seven Sabbath a Sabbath has seven a Sabbath which means it's seven so seven times seven that's 40 49 so the next year the following year it meant it'll be the Year of Jubilee because 50 is Jubilee and then they had the Redemption of The Inheritance like for example if your brother uh uh becomes poor and he sells a property one of his skin one of his skin had to had the opportunity or had your ability the ability to redeem whatever he saw if he wanted it back and then there is the Redemption of the poor brother like also if he becomes poor and then he sells himself instead of his property so someone else or his brother could had the ability to go and and and and redeem him back the Bible also talks about the Redemption by power which is the Redemption that we will be talking about uh uh very soon and the Redemption by Blood so but the common thing about all those types of redemption is that a payment is due even some sort of a sacrifice is needed amen you had you you had either to work for your Liberty or you had to pay we had you had to pay for it amen but to redeem us the the Bible required that a blood you know the the sharing of the blood was required to redeem us because death life is the only thing that can overcome death amen you can only overcome death by life I mean there is no any substitute that can overcome death it's like for example uh you see the children of Israel when they were in uh uh uh Egypt you see that God that they were under a covenant of of the circumcision the one God told Abraham that you have to circumcise your children and and everybody you know after you you'll see that when God was sending plagues to Egypt the Covenant of circumcision was saving them from those plagues amen because they were in gulsion the first nine plagues the plagues that God sent them amen they were able to to be kept safe because they were under that that that that low or under that a covenant of circumcision but when he came but when it was about life and death it meant that circumcision amen didn't mean anything it meant something higher than that was required amen the tenth plague which was death that God said that I will kill all the firstborn Amen in that time it meant being circumcised didn't matter anymore amen you had to do exactly what God told Moses that these children of Israel had to do amen you will see that he gave them uh uh it gave them restrictions like steps that they had to follow you find it in Exodus chapter 12 I mean it's a long chapter so I'm not going to read it uh the first thing that they had to do was to take a lamp they had to find the lamb it meant the second thing they had to check if that lamb met all the requirements in my meaning that they had to check if the lamb had uh if the lamb was hurt or if the lamb had uh uh some skin colors or things like that it might because that limb had to be perfect amen and then they had to keep that lamb for I'm pretty sure for four days and and test that lamb Amen to make sure that this lamb is the perfect lamp that is supposed to go uh for uh that is supposed to be killed and then after that they had to kill the lamb and when they were killing the lamb amen God told them that no born should be broken when the lamb was supposed when the lamb was killed and then after that they had to apply the blood on the lentil they had to apply the blood and stay in the house amen they had to apply the blood on the outside but stay inside of the house that the blind that the blood has been applied amen they had to roast up Lamb with fire amen and then they had to eat the Flesh and and then take the leaven out so the prophet says here that uh uh that people are trying to eat the word of God and they take it like it was wrong they chew on it the speed on it and everything else they say oh I just can't take it I I can't stand it it isn't cooked done enough that's all he said cook it with fire fire represent the Holy Ghost so you get God in your heart first and it'll cook it for you that's right cooked it out done season then test that then it'll taste good now you can't stand off like this outside and say oh I don't know whether it's for me or not that might be for days gone by just get the Holy Spirit first and watch what Divine Healing means to you then look what a heartfelt religion means to you then when you've got the Holy Spirit here to cook the lamb as it comes amen that's right cook the lamb first cook the lamb first and you have to have fire to cook it with it should be roasted yeah amen then when they had to eat it and when God told them to eat it with the shoes on their feet amen they had to have you know they had to be dressed like people who are ready to walk amen because after eating the lamb it meant it wasn't Exodus that was coming amen they had to leave that land to go into the promised land so they were eating that lamb Amen in haste amen because they were getting ready to walk amen amen and the Bible tells us that Jesus Christ was that lamb amen amen Jesus Christ represented that lamb that lamb represented Jesus Christ amen you will see that Exodus 12 chapter 1 and and 28 it meant all about all those things amen talks about Jesus Christ amen how Jesus Christ had to die how Jesus Christ had to be captured how Jesus crossed a man after his death no born a man could have been broken and and all these things you would find out that in in John chapter 1 verse 29 amen Jesus says that he's the lamb the man the Bible says that the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and saith Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world Amen that that lamb Amen in Exodus That was supposed to die for the children of Israel amen Jesus Christ in the New Testament amen is the lamb who's supposed to die for the sin of the world Amen in this time amen is not only dying for the firstborn amen but he's dying amen for the human race amen for the people a man who was in him before the foundation of the world Amen because the Bible says they are even before the Redemption amen you have first to be in God Amen God had to foreknown God Amen the Bible said that those that He foreknew amen he also Sanctified amen before that you have he had to know you first amen so Jesus Christ is that lamb and First Corinthians Chapter 5 Verse 6 to 8 amen the Bible says that Your Glory that Christ is our Passover amen the Bible says that your glory is not good know ye not that a little living levelness the whole lump amen Purge out therefore therefore the holy the old living that he may be a new lump as you are unleavened for even Christ Apostle very Sanctified for us therefore let us keep the feast now with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and weakness but with the unleavened breath of sincerity and Truth amen Deliverance remain represents sin amen that's why you will see that after the Passover amen God told them that God told the children of Israel to keep the leaven out of their house he says here that seven this shall be shall there be in Exodus chapter 12 verse 19. seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses amen for seven days it meant no leaven shall be found in your houses amen and the prophet tells us that those seven days represent the seven Church ages amen throughout the church ages it meant no leaven that means a note sin amen shall be found in our houses amen witches our hearts amen we have to be pure you know serve God in sincerity and Truth amen Jeremiah uh uh oh I'm jumping here Jeremiah chapter chapter 29 verse 10 to 14. amen the Bible talking about sincerity and Truth the Bible says that for thus saith the Lord that after seven years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word towards you in causing you to return to this place for I know the thoughts that I think toward you saith the Lord thought of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall ye call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart Amen in other words that when you will see when you will search for me in sincerity and Truth amen because that is the only way to search God with all your hearts amen it's when your heart is sincere amen when your heart is sincere and Truth there is no any distraction there is no bitterness there is no Envy there's nothing else that can block you from it amen that's when you search God from all your heart and then when you do that the Bible says in verse 14 that I will be found of you saith the Lord and I will turn away your captivity and I will gather you from the Nations and from all the places where that I have driven you saith the Lord and I will bring you amen and I will bring you again into the place when I cause you uh to be carried away from amen daddy oh that is only when you search God in sincerity and Truth amen when in your heart there is nothing else but just that desire Amen to serve God just that desire Amen to to look for him and to serve that is when God will uh come and uh be found to him amen the Bible now what is the token that the Bible has been talking about what is the token amen the token is the proof that you have completely obeyed amen that is the token remember that God gave them those things to do in Exodus 12. amen gave them the thing that they had to respect amen they had to obey everything that God Said Amen in order for that blood Amen in order for them to apply the blood amen it wasn't that the prophet said that some some of them could come to Moses and say well Moses amen Moses uh um um I'm in the Trump from the tribe of Levi and I've been circumcised and no need to apply the blood and no need to apply the blood because I have the circumcision amen Moses we tell them well that circumcision was able to save you for the nine plagues but this one is different amen this one is the battle between life and death amen this one is the battle between amen Lo and Grace amen you have to I mean the blood has to be there you have to be identified amen with by their blood I mean you have to be identified by the blame amen that blood amen some of them could come and Moses I have the I have the token inside of me Moses I don't need to apply it Moses will tell them well I need to see that token from the outside amen because God Amen that dear future when that death angel will come amen he will not be searching amen for that token inside of you it won't be searching for it it means a lot of people are trying to find diamonds or something like that I mean he has to be something that is easy to find a man from afar him and he was will see that this house can't be touched amen because the blood is being applied amen that is the kind of token that God is asking for I mean it's not like you're saying well brother I have the Holy Spirit brother have been baptized and all of that but where are the actions amen because the holy spirit amen is not something that is supposed to be just inside of you that people have really to open your heart and search your soul to find it amen but you have to prove you have to manifest the actions amen of that holy spirit amen it's like you see a tree I mean you call it the mango tree but where are the fruits amen people have to test the fruit it may eat the fruit of that tree amen and then they will know that it's a mango tree because they tasted amen it's the same thing with the holy spirit amen you have to see it amen why was the blood required amen because life is the only thing that can overcome in my death in my life is the only thing that's why Jesus understanding that life is the only thing that can overcome death amen couldn't send any Angel to come to for our Redemption amen he had to come down himself Amen to die for us and he had to come down himself he meant to take our places amen the Bible says that he became sin amen though he wasn't a sinner amen but he became sin amen he took our place amen it was an exchange amen and he died for us I mean it was an identification of that lamb to that lamb amen you have to identify yourself amen and now in this last age amen Jesus Christ the Lamb of God Amen died for us so now we have to identify ourselves to him by the word amen we have to have a complete obedience amen that's why I'm pretty sure Samuel who said to sow that obedience is more than sacrificed I mean it doesn't matter how many sacrifices you have done I mean it doesn't matter amen how many times you have preached and how many times you have sinned for God not many times you have done many sacrifices but where is your obedience amen so where is The Obedience it doesn't matter amen if you did 95 of the job but if God required you to do exactly what he said and when that's when you will have the token it may that's when you will have that token amen First Peter chapter 1 verse 18 to 19. amen you will see that Jesus was that lamb without spot and blamers for as much as you know the you were not redeemed with corruptable things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of Christ as a lamp without blemish and without spot amen Luke chapter 11 verse 53-54 I mean the Bible says there and as you say and has and and as he said these things unto them the scrubs and the Pharisees begin to urge him uh uh I don't know how to pronounce this word uh vehemently is that right vehemently and to provoke him to speak of many things laying wait wait for him and seeking to cut something out of his mouth that they might accuse him and when that land was supposed to be without without blemish and then so they decepted the Pharisees amen they kind of was laying traps even when they were uh uh uh uh talking to Jesus amen they were saying things that so that when Jesus reaction will be like something that they will go and tell the public because he said this that's why we crucified him amen by the Bible says that amen is if Jesus was crucified not because why not because he's sinned amen Jesus was crucified not because he done something wrong amen but Jesus was crucified because of love the love that he had for us amen God wanted us to be with him amen God wanted us he meant to to be with him like the Bible says in Genesis I'm pretty sure chapter 12 that this plane of redemption that I started I'm not gonna arrest until I have done amen everything that I said I mean until I have fulfilled it amen that's why Jesus died for us amen it wasn't because he he stole something or you know he bit somebody or or he hurt somebody or he did something wrong wrong amen but Jesus died because of us because of you and me amen that's why Jesus Jesus died remember John chapter John chapter 18 verse 38 the Bible said that pilate saith unto him what is truth and when he had said this he went now that he went out unto the Jews and said unto them I find in him no fault at all it meant nothing had to be found in that lamb amen that lamb had to be a perfect image amen no mistakes no nothing I mean he has to be perfect amen and pilate pilate bear that testimony saying that I found I find in him no fault at all amen that means that there is nothing that I can accuse him to make his crucifixion worthy of amen amen it was something done with love I mean it was because of the love that he had for us amen that's why he died John 12 23 to um uh or let's read the Hebrews chapter 9 verse 22 the Bible says that uh uh and almost all things are by the law perched with blood and without the shedding of blood there is no remission amen he had to die because like we said earlier it meant only life could overcome so it can overcome death amen It's Only Life that can overcome death amen that's why that's what the Bible said that we've been Justified amen we've been Justified because Jesus Christ took our place amen he took our places and he died for us amen that's that's the thing that causes our justification amen it when because he died for us amen there is nothing else that can that they can accuse us from amen because Jesus by Dying For Us amen he took everything with him amen he took all our burdens away with him amen uh in John chapter 1 of First John chapter 1 verse 7. the Bible said that but if we walk in the light if we walk in the light as he is the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanse us from all sin amen it's only the blood of Jesus Amen that can cleanse you from everything amen you can try to to do any kind of things I mean you can try to uh uh Say the Name of Jesus how many times you like you can try to amen do those uh uh um uh uh um you can try to even go baptize yourself under the water and things like that Amen in order for you to be cleansed amen there's only the blood of Jesus that has that ability it meant to clean you from your sins I mean it doesn't matter what you try to do amen there is only that I'll be that the blood of Jesus in my dad is able Amen to clean you from from all your sins amen you can try everything that you know of you can try everything that it meant every kind of method that you can try amen that will not do any good amen because the Bible says that the blood of of of the goats amen could only clean the flesh I mean he could only claim amen the the the amen he could only clean the scene but not forgive not forget amen but whenever but when you are cleansed it may cleanse by the blood of Jesus Amen the prophet says that in other words the balance goes back to zero amen everything that you have done in the past now has been forgotten amen it's been it's now under the the sea amen so there is nowhere to find it amen that was the Redemption by Blood amen showing that Jesus Christ the Lamb of God and when he had to Die For Us Amen in order for his blood it meant to redeem us amen because the love says that amen the man that the soul that sinneth amen the soul Shall Perish amen that low amen somebody had to Die For Us amen amen that's what Jesus died for us that was the Redemption by Blood it meant by the Redemption by power amen it's when you are facing troubles amen when you are facing troubles it's like Jesus it's like the children of Israel amen after the Passover amen they had to go out amen because Redemption it's also in other words Redemption is also that connects with us amen you have to go you have to come out of a man to go into amen by the difference between Redemption and exodus I mean it's like Redemption you're not going into a new place amen you're going back to your first initial position amen bye bye next so that's amen you can come out of something somewhere and go wherever go into wherever you want but in Redemption amen you come out of something by you going back Amen to your first your initial position amen that's that's the Redemption amen but you see that when God redeemed them by his blood amen amenity he saved them from being from dying amen now he can't wear trouble came to them and then he came that they were facing troubles amen now the power of God was required and then now the power of God was required Amen to face to stop Pharaoh amen because Pharaoh a man promised them that I would set you free amen but he had no intention to set them free I mean he was telling Moses well Moses if you do this and that then I will set you free if you do this and and after this I will set you free you can go but but when they will come back again amen they will see that Pharaoh will change his mind the Bible says that Moses came to Pharaoh about nine times telling Pharaoh that you have to let my people go amen by he wanted he didn't want to let them go amen it's like the devil amen today amen he can lie to you tell you about these things that hey you've been uh uh just uh you know you've been uh forgiven and and and and you can do this just one time and I will let you go and you forget about it but the next day you find yourself doing the same thing again and again amen you can watch this today and probably tomorrow uh uh you I will let you go tomorrow you will stop watching this and and you can sing today tomorrow to more this scene today just the last time for you to sin and do and and after that you will be fine you know God will forgive you amen and if you didn't repent amen he's just a trap amen that he's telling you that you do this just for today and then I will let you go then you can forget about it amen but he will not let you go in and you do it today and tomorrow remind you will have the same desire and the same desire will become will become now a nature to you amen he will come now and have it I mean it's like uh there's a say that says um I'm trying to find it here there's a proverb that say that so a thought and you will rip an action so in action and you were ripping a habit so a habit and you will reap a character so a character and you reap a destiny it meant everything starts with the thought it meant everything starts in your mind amen you start thinking about something if you start thinking about sinning you start thinking about doing something wrong and then after the thought I mean he comes with it comes in action then then you will rip an action that thought would create will tell you we give you the strength amend to act and then after an action that thing will become inhabit if you don't stop amen it will become a second nature to you and after habit then it will become your character and then after your character amen then will become your destiny amen that's why it is good it meant to think about the word of God every time amen that's why it is good to think about God every time because when you think about him and when you think about his his word and his wonders and everything that he has done for you amen will become an action and then it will become your destiny amen you have to start thinking about him all the time amen that's why the prophet says that that our mind is in no man's land and no man's land is the place where it battles where where where soldiers fight where when there's a war between nations amen they look for that no man's land where where people will not be heard like the the city will not be hurting and things like that that will find a neutral point Amen in our neutral point is our mind amen that's why we have different thoughts flowing through our mind we have bad thoughts and good thoughts so it just depends on what thought that you nurture the most that's the thing that will overcome amen you'll see that the Redemption by power and made the children of Israel they were leaving Egypt amen because God told them God tell Moses to tell the people that to tell pharaoh to let these people go so now on their way out of Egypt amen Pharaoh promising Pharaoh would tell Moses after the last plague that you just go I don't need you anymore in here but after they left emefaro was behind them trying to pursue them to kill them amen because he just couldn't grasp that that thought of letting the the the the children of Israel go because the irritation of Israel amen worse were the key of the blessing of Egypt amen it was because they were there in Egypt that's why Egypt was a strong Nation amen because they had the promise of God that God will always provide for you amen God will always be with you God will always help you it was because of them that Egypt was blessed amen was because of Joseph in a man who went to Egypt a man who helped them amen throughout those family years is it meant to still have to still have food but when the cheese that those children of Israel left it meant nobody talked about Egypt anymore Egypt became in history amen because God's people were not there amen that's why that's why Jeremiah you will see that God told Jeremiah to go in the city amen if he finds one or two people who still fear the lord God will spare that City because God cares amen for you so God cares for his children amen Redemption by power amen God did not just stop you know redeem it by redeeming them by the blood by with his blood God did not just stop redeeming their soul I mean he also had to keep their physical being safe amen the prophecy that the deaf Angel passed over proving that God had made a way of Escape through the offering of the blood and their skin they accepted it now he's going to make a way of escape from a physical death like a black believer as soon as he gets saved may be a cancer has eaten has eaten him up or something um some uh some diseases God has Redemption also through Power the same as he has Redemption for the soul he has Redemption for the body they weren't saved and they were circumcised they were under the blood by yet Pharaoh it might the enemy was going to destroy them kill them all right there in the wilderness then God sowed and then God showed his power of redemption for their body you get it you know what I'm speaking of the congregation says amen Redemption by the power and then when the the enemy was right nearly on them the great Supernatural pill of Fire raised up from uh raised out from over Israel come over here and stood between them and death amen Redemption by power amen God had to keep them safe that's why you understand the Bible somewhere and says I'm pretty sure Exodus he says that the god that hold the pill of fire was leading them in front was in front of them leading them amen by what danger was in their back when danger was coming the Bible said that the pillow fire that was leading the children of Israel left from being before them amen went behind them it meant to become a shield it meant to make sure that they were safe amen because God doesn't only care for your soul he also cares for your body amen he also cares for your physical being that's why he's a Healer amen that's what amen he's a way out when when we Face troubles and temptations amen that's why God also cares that God had to make sure amen that those children of Israel they were also safe amen so that's why you don't have to fear even though death is knocking at your door amen you don't have to fear because the prophet says that when death is knocking amen you have the ability to choose whether to die or not to die amen you have the choice if he says that now to every believer Born Again child of God when death comes stealing to the door prematurely the angel of God stands between you and the sickness now if you want to run on to run on to it that's your business but you don't have to see he is standing between you and death amen is standing between you and death making sure that that you can't go prematurely that one was found in uh Redemption and completeness in George paragraph 63. it meant that God is standing there the angel of God Is Standing There amen amen then you have to make a choice like we we preached the last time we preached him and that life is a choice amen life is constituted by choices it meant everything that we do in our lives in many churches is all of them are choices amen you choose to wake up in the morning it's a choice you choose not to wake up amen it's your choice you're trying to be uh neutral amen is still a choice amen but when also death comes to you amen you feel sick and your body can't get well and and the doctor says that you know there is no more hope and and you're gonna die tomorrow amen the prophecy that you still have that choice to choose amen if death is coming prematurely you still have that choice to choose it may either it meant to say no to it or to go right on to run into it amen it's your choice it's your business amen you don't have to amen because the angel of God is standing between you and death amen When the Children of when they left Egypt Pharaoh was on their back coming back coming becoming with the coming behind them to kill them and when he had all the intention to kill them that's why he took all these armies all these armies he meant to kill them amen and the Reds he was before them the power of God was required then amen because there is the Red Sea before them no so that there was no way to go to uh there was nowhere to go overseas and Pharaoh was coming behind them amen the children of Israel was trying to try to panic and and and go to Moses well Moses should have left us back then and and eat our onions and and and things like that amen Moses you are rather even serve fairer than than come and die here amen because they didn't find any way out amen they didn't know where to go they couldn't go back because Pharaoh what was up wanted to kill them and they couldn't go forward amen they even said well Moses there is no boat here it meant to even take us to go through there Moses we don't know how to swim even though we tried to swim we can't make it Moses there is no there is no well that can swallow us as they did with Jonah Moses there is no way out amen they try to think amen as human being try to think their way out they just couldn't and some of them started to cry some of them started to panic I mean some of them started to to complain Moses just take us back just go and apologize to Pharaoh amen so that he can receive us back in Moses I'd rather be a slave than than to die here but when God told Moses and he said Moses why are you crying amen Moses why are you crying amen you have the ability to speak the word amen Moses why are you panicking you have the ability to speak the word stand still and know that I am God Amen Moses stand still and I know that I am God you have the ability to speak the word and to divide this Red Sea and you guys will walk in dry land amen and Moses did exactly that amen God divided the Red Sea and they walked on dry land amen because God showed them that he has the power of redemption him and he can redeem them with his power amen that he wanted to keep them safe amen so that's why when troubles come to you amen troubles come in your family amen you don't know what to do just turn your faith to God Amen just let your faith look up to him amen just turn your eyes to him and say Lord I'm just depending on you lord lord what is the next step Lord what should I do next amen what troubles come to you it doesn't mean that you have been forsaken amen try to imagine if Joseph Iman stopped amen because everything was going wrong for him amen he went to Fair first of all uh he was hated by his father by his brothers amen his life was miserable amen he couldn't he didn't feel safe when he was with his own Brothers amen they sold they sold him to fit to to uh party for arriving there amen amen he had troubles with his wife with 45 uh with his master's wife and then after that he went to prison amen Joseph could have been there complaining about God why my life is just going worse after worst and worse things are just coming to me but Joseph amen amen just could Joseph kept his faith in God Amen because right because more troubles was coming to him the closer he was he meant to fulfill it made the closer it was to to uh uh uh the closer was his Joy his Joy was on the way amen he says that amen amen amen the night amen will never last forever amen there is a time limit for a night peer amen because morning Joy shall come in the morning amen George uh uh uh Joseph had to remember God's word him and he had to remember that Joy will come in the morning amen because my life is being worse and everything is not going well it doesn't mean that God has forsaken me amen that was something that God has to eat that he had to go through so that he can be ready Amen to manage amen that the position that he was supposed to take amen before because if God just took Joseph from his father's house and and brought him to that position where where he was where he was supposed to be amen I believe that Joseph would have failed amen because he didn't have that character amen because Joseph had to go through those trials in man Jesus and Joseph had to go through all those things it meant to build that character amen because character is not a gift but character is a victory I mean he had to go through those trials it meant to build a character amen because and to build a character because when he will be blessed amen he will know exactly how to handle it amen when he will be blessed amen you will not turn his back from God because he's blessed amen when he will be blessed him and he will still be remembering amen what he had to go through and he will still be remembering God Amen God had to redeem them amen God had to save them Pharaoh was on their back the Red Sea before them amen there is nowhere to go on your left side and on your right side they're still dangerous you feel stuck and you don't know where to go just turn your eyes to God amen you have troubles before your troubles behind your troubles you know left troubles in your right there is no solution even though it says that my help comes from above my Help Cometh From God Amen when you feel yourself amen amen uh uh amen you you feel yourself in midst of troubles imagine just trust God Amen he has a plane he has a way out amen because the Bible says that God gives us troubles that first of all that we are able to overcome it but even though we are over able to overcome it y'all we always finds he always gives us a way out amen but you just have to depend on him amen you just have to trust him you just have to wait on the Lord amen Joseph had to practice his patience amen Joseph had to wait on God Amen Joseph had to wait on God because God had something plain for him imagine God has something big that was coming for him amen so he had to be patient amen until the time of the Lord was there amen Abraham had to be patient amen until the time of the of God was there amen If Abraham had Isaac after one year of marriage amen that testimony wouldn't help amen uh wouldn't help it meant uh uh uh those people who came after him amen but he had to go through that 25 years of waiting amen so that when you tell somebody about the testimony of Abraham amen that person will still know that there is a God who still care amen is still it doesn't matter how long I have to wait amen but God still hears my prayer amen because you promised me that he will give me a son and God will honor his promise amen God can never give you something that he knows that he won't do it amen whatever God says whatever that comes out of his mouth amen he's more than able to fulfill it amen God had to stand between them amen the prophet says that when they come out of on the other side here it is I want you to see it as they come out on the other side crawled up on the bank and looked back and seen all those tests test Masters who had been uh who had beaten them killed some of them just like cancer and cigarettes and tobaccos and whiskey and everything else drives the kids insane sends them to the Asylum into hospitals and a bunch of neurotics and and everything else produced in the world when they looked black and so all those things struggling helpless and dying in the sea brother you talk about the meeting they had won amen they had a good meeting Moses this dignified man as soon as he come through that experience he's seen all those test Masters dead he know he knew all of them you know all them things was gone forever then all those things that had drove them and beat them and wiped them around and and was finished he raised his hands and sank in the spirit oh my never been typed and won't be until we get the glue we get to Glory up yonder when the completion was made there he sang in the spirit and when we're redeemed in that body that was a type of the Holy Spirit coming at Pentecost when we passed through the sea it was a type of Pentacles and Moses in the type back there when he passed through that he sang in the spirit he come on that day of Pentecost and when the body is perfect redeemed now all now our soul is perfect redeemed right cannot perish God everlasting life what the Bible says oh I feel good know this why because I know it's thus if the Lord just anchor my soul there and walk on and say Satan just he saw uh he saw you want to to me don't bother me because I know whom I have believed and then persuaded he's able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day amen Moses so all God has done for him amen because Moses gave that promise to the children of Israel that these Egyptians that you sing right now amen you will see them no more amen they probably they didn't understand what Moses said they didn't understand some of them asked Moses but what are you saying because those Egyptians I'm just seeing them they're not slowing down amen they're just coming look they have the arrows ready to Amen to to kill us but Moses what are you saying Moses could have told them just trust God Amen just put your faith in God Amen that these Egyptians that you sing right now amen you will see them no more amen there is a time that is coming that you will be free forever amen that you will be free from your labor amen you will be free from sin amen those things that is bothering you right now the sickness sin and everything amen you will see them no more amen because Christ died for you amen but when they went over it that when they went over that land amended that on the other side the Bible said that Miriam amen she took her tambourine and she starts singing in the spirit amen she started rejoicing it may rejoicing because she started to think about how her life was miserable amen why she had to go through amen all the trials that she had to go through it meant all the persecutions amen how she was beaten even how she saw her brother died and the brother dying and and little babies dying and children and mothers and fathers dying and when she started to think about these things and and think about the grace of God that she was one of the few amen that was able to make it over amen that she was one of the few living Amen to testify amen the goodness of God Amen she started to give thanks to God and when she started to to sing and once she started to sing amen all those sisters and girls that was there Amanda joined her they said well Miriam let's sing now it's our time to praise the Lord amen to thank him for what he's done for us amen but when you see that everything is done it meant All the Troubles is gone amen this is time to Rejoice amen because God died for you amen he shared his blood for you amen it's the time to Rejoice because there is no sin that can Bond you anymore amen because you have been forgiven from all your sins amen for your worst nightmare that you can imagine amen the blood of Jesus Christ has washed you from it amen you have no reason to be crying amen you have no reason to be sad even you have no reason to be sad and start complaining amen you have all the reason to be to be singing for God it meant to be rejoicing man because the sins amen that Bond you now amen that we Bond you no more amen as long as you come and you for you you confess all your sins amen All the Troubles that you you enduring this in this life amen up there in glory amen there will be no more amen because you will be free from it and then you will be free for me amen is like this song that says once like a bird in prison at wealth no freedom from my for my sorrow I felt but Jesus came and listened to me and glory to God he set me free amen he set me free a man he set me free he broke the bonds of Prisons for me I'm Glory bound my Jesus to see for Glory to God he set me free amen Jesus listen to your cry amen remember he told Moses that I have listened to the Cry of my people amen amen when they were crying when they were praying to God and when they were saying Lord we need that we need you to deliver us Lord we we need you to come and save us amen God didn't forget all those prayers amen God remembered all those prayers amen God listened to all those prayers when he came and he talked to Moses he said Moses I've listened to the Cry of my people amen amen all your prayers that you do all the prayers that you do for your family all your prayers that you do for for your loved ones amen for your friends and for your neighbors amen God listens to you amen God remembers it amen there will be a time where he will come to you will say my son amen I've listened to all your prayers and now is the time for your deliverance amen because God doesn't forget that God doesn't forget us amen God always thinks about us amen that's why he gives us that's why he gave us a prophet amen that's why he gives us his word amen he gave us the Bible amen he gave us the word he meant to keep reminding us amen that he's always there by our side so amen there is no time it's not a time to be worrying amen it's not a time to be complaining amen it's not a Time amen amen to be asking yourselves questions amen without we like does God care for me it's not a time to do that amen but it's a time to to trust God the song that we sing that my faith looks up to my faith looks up to him amen you have we have to put our faith in him say the Lord I believe in your word Lord amen I believe in everything that you have said amen your Bible the Bible is true and your word is true and Lord here I am I give you my heart I give you my soul lord I want to be washed Lord I've done so many things that I'm ashamed of Lord I've done so many things that I'm not proud of but Lord here I am I need you to wash me I need you to cleanse me amen he will redeem You by his blood and when troubles come when sickness come amen his power is always there Amen to make sure it meant that you are safe amen the Bible close with this the prophet said that God vindicates that that's always been right God vindicates it to be true so plainly the predestinated is the only one that's considered in Redemption did you get it let me say it again let me say that again the predestinated is the only one that's considered in Redemption people might be making people might be making like think they are but the real Redemption is those that are predestinated because the very word redeem means to bring back is that right redeem the redeem to redeem anything is to bring back to its original Place Hallelujah it's only the predestinated will be brought back because others didn't come from there see to bring back amen you came from God and you're going back to God Like Jesus says in John chapter 16 that I came from God I came from my father and I'm going back to my father amen you're only going back where you came from amen you're not going back to you know for something new and when the devil was the person who had the right to redeem us amen the devil was the first person who had the right for our Redemption remember he didn't have the price to pay amen he couldn't pay the price that was required amen only the blood was required for our Redemption so the Devil Couldn't die for us that's why he lost his place and Jesus had to become the closest Kinsmen Amen in other words he had to become his son he had to make a body to become to come here on Earth he meant to to feel the pain that we feel it meant to be sick like we are sick amen to be hungry like we are hungry to be tried and to be tempted Amen to go through everything that we go through in our daily lives Amen to understand our pains to understand what we go through then the Redemption will make sense that then Redemption amen will become more valuable that's why he didn't send his angels amen because Angels couldn't sin amen Angels Angels they don't Angels they don't they don't they don't have that thing that take they don't have that thing that takes to pay the price I mean it was only his blood amen That was supposed to redeem us amen he who was not a sinner amen here who did not commit any sin amen he became sin amen for you and me so that today you can say praise the Lord I'm free amen so that today you can sing that amazing grace that saved the rich like you amen said that today you can sing all the wonders of God Amen because that day on Calvary amen he died for you he took your place amen so you don't have to you to take it very lightly amen because Grace as I always say grace as has a period amen Grace is not something that is giving you Eternal amen there is a period for Grace because when you reject Grace that same Grace becomes a judgment for you so if you have the grace of God Amen you better take it because the prophet says that a pardon is a pardon when it's when it's received coming when it is received as a pardon so if it's not received the grace is also a Grace when it is received as a Grace so if you reject that Grace that same Grace will become a judgment amen don't make the same don't make the mistake that the children of Israel made it meant to reject Jesus Christ when he first came amen but you have to receive them he meant to say Lord come in My Heart Lord I need you inside of me Lord I want you to save me if the musician can come and sing that that Amazing Grace Lord I want you to come inside of me Lord I need you to save me I know Pharaoh doesn't have the Pharaoh doesn't want to let me go I mean he's just giving me things and and trying to make me happy for a while but then he will come and put the time for me to go he will say no but Lord I want you to set me free but I want you to break all the bonds if the bondage Lord I want you to take me from this prison I mean if we can stand and and sing this Amazing Grace amen you who was once rich and man you was once a sinner and when you did bad things in the past and and Jesus Christ died for you amen he shared his blood for you I made this Amazing Grace let's sing this song [Music] Amazing Grace Glory was Grace that brought My Liberty [Music] I do not know just why he came to love me so beyond my fault and he saw my knees [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] he looked beyond my soul is Almighty Amazing Grace shallow with me be my soul the praise that bought my Liberty [Music] thank you I do not know [Music] just why he came to love me so he looked beyond I fought and he saw the Monies [Music] to view the cross where Jesus died for me come over [Music] he looked beyond my fault and he saw my knees Thief enough for Grace My Soul would be or drifting sheets with no sin

heads father Lord we come to your father God tonight Lord just to say thank you Father Lord thank you for the word Lord Jesus says how broken it was father God in the heart to explain it father Lord

Lord Jesus let your word O Father God be with us Lord and as we're going back home father God we pray that your traveling mercy be with us Lord let us O Father God take this word and and think about this word that Mary did oh Father God and and this word we create an atmosphere father God that will bring Angels down to Father God the atmosphere father God that will make our way father God for you to act in our lives Lord so we thank you Father God for everything that you did for us we thank you for everything that you are doing for us right now and then father God we thank you for everything that you would do for us in the future Lord we pray that you bless us Lord in Jesus Christ and we pray amen amen God bless you [Music] how many were blessed this evening amen we thank God for that Redemption amen redeeming us when God redeems you you can never get lost again amen he redeems and redeems you for good Pastor to come forward amen I just want to thank God for the word of God because you know Redemption is something I feel like the whole church needs to hear there's so many people amen now that think they've been redeeming have not been redeemed and you know when it comes to the blood of Jesus Christ I love the way the word of God came God wasn't having the token inside and and you couldn't see it from the outside everybody claimed to have it but it must be seen it can't be something um that you know God has to go search for uh that's what I loved about that I just love the word of God I appreciate everything that was said by the grace of God I appreciate our brother Isaac for ministering the word of God it was wonderful I enjoyed every bit of it and just want to keep may the Lord keep you encouraged because I I just know by God's grace the Holy Ghost doesn't change God doesn't change and you know that's what I'm talking about when you come to a church and you can't see the token something is wrong thank God for the life itself Hallelujah I mean you're grateful to God for saving them let us sing this song that the Minister was quoting during the service he set me free amen how many can say I've been set free once like a bird
