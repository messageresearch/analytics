TRANSCRIPT
========================================
every praise is to our God and you know uh I I say I I enjoyed that one brother Brook you know I can see him sweat a little bit you know I tell you you know every praise that means everything you go through that means every trial every tribulation it says everything it brings forth a praise and the Bible said the Lord inhabits the Praises of his people it's not any kind of praise you want but Troy you love the praise of your wife you say why because she means something to you and you say when when you just tell her oh sweetie thank you for that meat Lo she say well praise the Lord amen and then you say well sweet I like them biscuits well praise the Lord and next time she in the kitchen it just it does something to her you know what I'm saying it's like oh it makes it sweeter see that's why Proverbs it said it's better that you basically it talks about the ox it's like you rather not have a fatted ox and you get a plate of food and the person don't love you I'm paraphrasing but go back to Proverbs 15 it says you rather have something seasoned with love so that's what you know I just say when God hears the Praises of his people it shows brother Kei that you still can go through trial you still can have the unadulterated word it still can mean something to his people and they're still praise there still praise then it says every praise every praise is to our God and it says Sing Hallelujah to our Glory Glory Hallelujah to our god oh every praise brother every praise is to our God can you sing sing Hallelujah Glory Glory Hallelujah is to our oh every pra oh every praise is to our God and it says oh God our savior God our healer God I it's come on somebody say yes he is come on no yes he is oh God I say God God I he oh yes God I and it says what oh yes he is y'all almost there y'all ain't there yeah it says God our glory glor god our healer and he said God I now you ready come on say yes he is oh yes it yes he is you see it's a different yes he is oh come on now amen yes he is yes he is the I said that the redeem of the Lord say so say so the redeem of the Lord not anybody but those that know that he paid a price those that know you've been bought with a price and your worship is not your own but the worship you give unto God it goes back to him who deserves all the praise that's because why the Bible says in Psalm 47:7 send You Praises with understanding God is our savior amen now he says my My Savior and then he said God is my healer so if you're sick get your healer tonight see it's easy to call a doctor but what about your healer come on now and then K say and God is my deliverer so he's my everpresent help in the time of trouble you might not be there brother Adam but Brother Richard he said he'll be there so he said he's my deliverer and then all I can say is yes he is yes he is oh GL hey I just y'all a want to preach something just preach something else you know I said that means something to you you see it means something he said to see what God has done for you and you see when he see that when you can see what God done for you it may mean something to somebody else because they may need a savior they you think like tonight think as a Healer how many people go to the doctor and the doctor they may say have a problem whatever right and they say doctor like s r is talking he says Doctor I'm having issue say with my skin right and I had this skin issue and the doctor say well if you don't get this skin issue fix in 30 24 hours you going to die first thing a person eyes they swell up I'm going to die oh doctor said I'm GNA die call brother Brook call somebody call somebody in the church brother ke we got to get the prayer line up now you ain't been to the prayer meetings in a long time but now it's time to get the prayer meeting up but you need a help right so the doctor gives you something he says you got he writes on piece of paper and if you were to show somebody you say this is what you got man he said I'm G to die in 24 hours but you don't even know what that mean and you get in your car and you drive it all the way across town you tell the person if I don't get this in 24 hours brother he says but you I'm gon to die just give me this right here and you don't even know what it is like come on now and it's written seem like in a language but you say I need it come on now and then the person they go and they fill it out right they say well you can't really let me see your insurance card oh come on I'm G to die in 24 hours give me the medicine now you start thinking if I don't get this medicine and after that you see that after the person who knows how to divinely interpret what is on the paper yeah yeah they come and they read it and they say oh you need a little bit of this a little bit of that and then next thing you know the pill is about the size of this envelope and they said you got to swallow it now in 24 hours in one Lo and you just like sweetie help me you ain't helping help get my mouth open I need to get this pill down and you don't even know what the pill is come on now so it means that now guess what you're doing something by faith amen so if God tells you that in his word that he's your healer and he made a very plain and he raised the dead and he and he said he touched your body he can heal the common cold and now I'm asking you does it not mean the prescripture means something so it only means something if you apply it you got to take it back and say Lord help me understand and just help me swallow your pill on the gospel the gospel it's gospel oh Lord God lord I don't want to keep you standing amen just getting the word but God is God is real and I tell you boy if I wasn't croing so much you know it says that song brother B

let get in the word amen I said Lord help us amen I said Lord he you know it's it's something in your soul when he's good te and you just maybe just driving and you think about it you walking and you think about it he says in the good times of times you got to think about it because he dropped down in your soul it means something to you it used to not mean nothing to you it used to be a thought it used to be something you know maybe talk about something and go through your brain but now it mean something to you now it's a self check it's to keep it in the middle of the road oh I don't want to keep it standing but I said that uh you know uh Lord you're so good Lord and and it's something I tell you you know wish got here early uh but uh these are the days of the Liv he says the people of God he said that people been called by his name and he said we're trusting in every promise of God and it's it it is a time and he said this is that time where it's an eagle anointing and it's anointing that now you see when you look at the four beasts that go around the throne it says you have what the ox the lion he says the um what else the man face of the man and then you also had the eagle and you look at it the eagle is the only one that can fly it's the only one that can lift above you know all the pressures of life and God knew that being getting buried for a Rapture he said now come on we getting ready for a Rapture and that's see that see every age ain't the same promise and he said those that overcome in this age will sit with me in my Throne so now we we supposed to be Overcomers now he says in order for Eagle to fly you must know how to ride the currents you must let the Holy Ghost lead you and you must take every word in the book every word to be able to go through all the storms of light that's where we're at tonight surrounding the throne oh Lord let me help me Lord get get in here oh just turn with me to not to keep you standing uh I said Lord um just want to read a couple make it kind of quick make I want you to St long let's just read I tell you what first 1 Corinthians 10:17 I'll kind of jump back and forth here I got bunch of little scriptures scribbl down here and then and then we'll read uh um Exodus uh Deuteronomy let's see let me read this first Corinthians 10 uh I'll just start even at 16 he saying it's talks about leaving a adultery adultery and the cup of blessing which we bless it is not the communion is it not the communion of the blood of Christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ for we being many are one bread and one body and we are all partakers of that one bread behold Israel after the flesh are not they which eat of the sacrifices on partakers of the altar let's just turn over with me to uh uh Deuteronomy 8 and Deuteronomy 8 uh let's see save a little time I drop I'm going drop down to verse two and thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God LED thee these 40 years in the wilderness to Humble thee and to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou wouldest keep his Commandments or no and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with Mana which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man does not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord does Man live Amen Let Us bow oh Lord gracious Heavenly Father we just come before you again Lord Lord God and we know Lord Jesus that we are here to gather around your bleeding bloody word Lord God and Heavenly Father we have sung the sons of Zion Lord we thank you for all you've done to us but Heavenly Father we just also ask if you would just oh Lord remain and father come and just break the bread of eternal life to our hearts Lord God and that Heavenly Father we may see you on the throne Lord tonight may you come down each and every aisle Lord God and may you touch every heart Lord Jesus and may Heavenly Father you get all all the praise honor and glory for Heavenly Father Lord move us out the way that you would Heavenly Father speak to our hearts tonight in the name of Jesus Christ Lord we just say amen amen amen I'll just saying uh just want to read it you may see it if you like I say I was going to look at Matthew 4 and just read this to you Matthew 4:4 I'll just read F three when Jesus chapter 4 verse3 when Jesus thank you Lord when Jesus it says when he was come out out of uh Jordan Remember Luke 4 it says that straight way the spirit took him up into the Wilderness and he was tempted of what the devil and it says he was after he had fasted 40 days 40 nights the level the devil came to him at his lowest point and remember when he tempted him Jesus showed us as a Believer we could defeat the the devil on any ground any place any time if we could only just say what he said if we could only just speak the word of God if we could only believe the word of God then now it shows that we had victory in the word of God so now it looks as though remember the Bible says the the prophet the spirit of the prophets must be subject to the Prophet The Prophet subject to the spirit of the Prophet so it shows us that everything is moving as he sung the song by the power of God that the prophets couldn't say nothing than what the other Prophet had said before and even when Jesus was here when he spoke and they asked him questions he would go back and he would say what he'd go back to what the prophet is said when he told the parable of the Lazar being in hell what did he say he lifted up his eyes in hell when he lifted up his eyes he said oh he said Lazarus he said the rich man said let Lazarus come forth and just give me a cool drop of water in my tongue and then he said my brother he said well there's a great Gulf between us Lazarus can't get there and the Very person that he walked by he wouldn't help on this side of the river was the first person he was asking help from now we must be careful so but think about this now that's what this Rich Young Ruler saw so now as he's now sitting up across the gulf he said they can't get there and Lazarus who on this Earth who was a seed of God what was what was Lazar like life like Lazar like he was actually getting sordes licked by dogs a seed of God yeah uh you know a man of God he said God on y but but he was getting now God was using dogs to take care of but God was taking care of but the man that had now he said all the the big Barns and he had all the wheat and he had all the you know like nice fixtures and nice home it says when he lifted up his eyes and Lazarus couldn't help him then he asked for Mercy for his family when he asked for Mercy for his family he saw what he said just let somebody go and warn them of this place and he says what did he say to them he said they have what Moses and they have the prophets so they have people on Earth even in 2014 that if they would he with a word that God is still delivering to his people that there you are going to have to receive the same thing that the one we talked about earlier that's God manifested In the Flesh that's all she had to see God if you look from Genesis all with the Revelation people they struggle with seeing God In the Flesh it's easy to go back and point and say I would have done this and I would have done that and the Bible says no you wouldn't yeah he said because your spirit now is halty now then it be halty then remember the Bible says that the rock that followed them in the wilderness was Christ and he say they were all baptized unto Moses and the cloud that followed them by day and the fire by night he says that was Christ now revealing himself to the people every day and every night but they still didn't believe now you say why so you mean Brother Kyle you mean that it's happened before that people who pray and really want to see the pillar fire yeah he said people that see it can still see it and not believe yeah well it's in the Bible amen every brother Brown made a comment he said now he said now that light that was over his head he said light was over head that happened in 1950 when they took that picture he said this what this is what they said about it he said now it to the people he said it could have been an optical illusion but he said it wasn't now he said now perfect you could have saw with your eyes even though you saw with your eyes he said now your eyes can play tricks on yeah right but then he said but those who are living now who can see this picture they have a greater witness come on now that means for the people that believe that means you believe that God now was trying to what a vindicat a voice he was trying to show that now I'm with him now a man can't vindicate himself come on now you cannot vindicate yourself so you see now it takes God to now vindicate that he sent you yeah it takes God to show that he's the one keeping you so you see when when Jesus was temp to the devil he went all the way back in Matthew 4:4 and what did he do he went back and he spoke the very word that was spoken by who Moses now Moses he says he let's just read what Jesus said let's go back to Deuteronomy Jesus said he said if this is Satan first Satan says to him if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread so now look but he answered and he said it is written now you see Satan got hit with a 10,000 bat battle he didn't know who wrote it he didn't know really who he was talking to and you see if you can say the same thing and you know that he's trying to tempt you with the lust of the flesh that you can say Satan it's no reason for me to cheat it's no reason for me not to go all the way with God why because I cannot live while bread alone but the only way I live Jesus said as it is written is by every word that is spoken out of the mouth of God you see so what did he do he said so since you had a problem with Moses he said go back to Deuteronomy let's look at this real quick see he had took him all the way back to Deuteronomy so he was backing up his servant even though his servant wasn't there and you see he said when when Moses spoke this in the wilderness he said that was speaking to a group of people who he told he said that that you walked in the wilderness for 40 years and the only reason you were in the wilderness is because God had to Humble you now remember Moses could speak this very clearly because he knew that God had him on the backside of the desert for 40 years before he could start his ministry so you remember so now when he left Egypt the man that couldn't take over when now God met him on the backside of the desert now he turns back 80 years old a man going to take over the world going to see Obama with a stick in his hand and say Let My People Go CNN is on the helicopters are on but he said let my people go now you see see it wasn't see y'all got to see what that see that was kind of crazy and you say uh baby can you keep the baby kind of uh quiet over there she's like I'm trying I'm on she on the back of the donkey all the way down now come on now like this that's the Bible right see it happen yeah and now you says he's there he said now but he has all of Heaven backing him up now brother Troy and all now he says he speaks a word to Pharaoh let my people go but God hardened his heart and is he hardest heart we know God did all these T signs and wonders all in the land of Egypt just to prove that he was with his people yeah so now when they finally came out they still had some people that had little bit of the world in their heart because see some things came up in the wilderness they've been out there like three days and he said you know the Bible says that when they crossed to the Red Sea that Miriam grabbed a tamarine she started playing and it didn't say some of the women in the church but it said all the women got all around them so that means it wasn't no different Spirit yeah it wasn't no no you knew what time it was when me and gra that tamarine and you saw them big walls of water you knew what time was you well you know I'm a little reserved n it was none of that the Bible says oh the women got behind them so they start praising with the tambourine and when God brought them out now they're sitting there and now they start thinking about man MOS we been here three days we've been in bondage 400 years but you know now it's we've been out here three days and I tell you what you you ever heard that the church before he was oh when I was a Baptist I was the man oh watch out now he said when I was a Catholic but hold on now but what about now what about now what that Jesus has done something in your life it says you can't go back to thinking about the melons the onion and the garlic how they start thinking about the foods in the room just how good the food was and you know the Bible says taste and see the Lord is good and God was trying to get them to taste something but in their heart they were still feasting on Egypt so when he pulled them out then he said you know what God is going to do something God is going to have you out here 40 years because when he went over to the land it was time to receive the Holy Ghost time to receive the promise and they got up there and when they could have just taken the word of two good servants Joshua came they took the majorities internet stuff they look at what most people were saying on the internet negative that's what they looked at mostly and they couldn't see nothing positive they couldn't see nobody coming to Christ they couldn't see nobody know going front they couldn't see nobody off dope they couldn't see nobody off crack they couldn't see nobody now having off off alcohol and liquor now having more prayer in the home they used to just fuss and fight they don't see they don't talk about that but all they talk about now is well they tell you what you know you need to take Moses side a little bit I think he killed two people in the sand down there you know I think he's a murderer you know that they look past the signs and one they couldn't see it now and you know what now he's trying he said this be a land of promise yeah and it's two guys with g this big it take two men to carry these grapes and they saw everything that Moses said was true yes sir but then now they'd rather believe the 10 and the two yeah walk with God despise people you see they didn't want that so when it was time to go get the Holy Ghost what happened they said oh we be like Grasshoppers and they said now they were talking about now in their own eyes not in the eyes of the Giants so they put themselves down they thought that everything of healing of salvation everything couldn't apply for them because of the people that was in the land but they looked past the promise and when they did that now he said now you're sitting here and God wants to give you everything you have need of but you're sitting there in your heart you're causing your own self to now step back and not get what God has for you so he said they said well you know what we we can't go and the Bible says the people's heart didn't know and they wanted to Stone Moses why are you doing this Moses it's all your fault so they started blaming him but it was two people with a different spirit that said when you blame Moses you don't realize you're talking about God so you see they had a revelation of God being manifested in the flesh that he was a friend of God and you see as he's sitting there it says now they look at him and they say please don't do this and now guess what happened the people now face the next day when God uses Moses say you should have just listened to my you should have Whi when I told you now they try by their own effort by their own means and say now he said it'll be a closing a away time people will still in 2014 be going on thinking they're receiving the Holy Ghost and he said but there'll be a Rapture there's going to be a Rapture after a little while you see now the Rapture takes place and now you see people are still thinking they're sealed in but they're being sealed out because it was a time that they didn't want to to the boys now God loved Israel but he said because for every day that they was in the land that you doubted it's a year you going to spin so God keeps up with every time we die amen he said these 10 times he said to these people Harden their heart toward my Miracle he said now for every day so he was counting the whole time don't think God don't count and he said when you going to reap what you going to S I said oh Lord please Lord please please you see please because if he keeping up I say oh no I can't take it you see what I'm saying you can't so when God says he throws your sin into the sea of forgive remember we ain't preaching a message of forgiveness we preaching a message of justification that means he said you never even did so God now you see it means something to really know that you're Justified to know you see when a man in prison and he received he said Christ he knows one thing is that yes I did what I what I did was wrong and he said I may be here for the next 10 15 years but he said but As Long As I Got King Jesus as long as he could just come and reveal himself to me then it means something to them that they can continue to walk on well I bring this to the place where we're at when they were out there being humble what happened was Moses is speaking to them and he said he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger he caed you to have those stomach pains yes he wanted you to now know what it was like to be thirsty he wanted you to know what it's like to be hungry for a reason brother Isaac because in him humbling he wanted to prove what's in our hearts the only reason was 40 years because the Bible says they didn't mix the word of God with faith so the son of man said when the son of man returned said what Jesus said should I find faith on the earth Faith now yeah Faith now I want you to catch this tonight because if you really believe believe that God is real then where is our faith he says for a rapture we must know that God can heal a tooth you must know that you must know beyond a shadow of a doubt that if you take what God Said at his word that he is faithful he who promised amen my brothers and sisters you see many people don't believe that that's why we were talking about with the envelope I said with the envelope what happened well I don't know where he went but the envelope you can see that if you get a p this big and you don't even know how to get it in your mouth but if your faith is in the doctor you try yeah yeah think about it now you try cuz in 30 24 hours you dead but now if you got faith in God yeah and he just says just humble yourself amen get on your knees yeah he says now are you have you repented yeah have you bought fruit meat worth repentance and do you know he said I'll forgive you and and look you see when non came to meet the prophet of God there it says that he never met him because God knew was still pride in his heart so Pride being in his heart he thought that the man of God should come to him a certain way he said the preacher should talk to him a certain way the pastor or this person they thought that he should be a certain way so this Mighty Man in order for him to receive his healing he had to Humble himself down to the mind of God and come Jesus said I am the way so he had to come the way of the Prophet which is the way of God to now say look he said I'm not even going to go out to meet him this is the word of God tell him to go down there and join the dip s time now that was a real humbling experience am I say the Lord I get to 7 I'mma tell you why because when he was down there I want you to see every time he went in this mud this was a muddy river yeah and if you ever been a muddy river when you go under the water where's all that same it's in your ears it's up your nose it's in your eyes it's in your mouth you got sand all in your hand but now look he went down there the first time and he went down there he still got the same skin condition and he still got sand he got sand in his ears he got s on in his nose and his teeth he try boy and there some better River than is it is some holy water you can sprinkle on me could you done something different could you just sprinkle it now what what mean why I rather you spit my eyes but now he had a wall and all down so now the servant had to tell him is it such a hard thing go down there one more time oh he coming up now it starting to look crazy because you seen a man just dabbling down here in the mudit but every time he went down you see his faith had to get strong amen and his faith he said now if I did it once I might as well do it twice and if I did it twice I might as well go three times and now if I go four times I might as well go a fifth and then he didn't he say dip seven times I might go all the way now and by the time he went all the way when he came up they said his back his face was like baby skin like baby Johnson that Johnson and Johnson stuff skin to it was just now look now you can you imagine how he felt come on now so you see the muddy word the muddy water was worth it it's worth it but you see sometime it's hard for us to just cut loose and say Lord have your way CU you say oh Lord you know I might cry a little bit I might you know oh I see something coming out my ey but you see that's what Christ may do to you he may humble you in a certain way just to show you how much you need him so what Mo God had Moses tell the people he said that what God did in the willness God gave you certain Manner and the manner he gave you was special and I want you to think a matter of fact take for night the hidden man the hidden man and in this Old Testament as we know in numbers as they kept walking it says when they were walking with the Lord that what happened to them that one day they got to complain a little bit and when they got complaining a little bit what happened God they said Lord you know we we hungry lord it's nothing to eat and the manner that this tells us in numbers when God sent forth he says now these little little like wafer looking thing like coriander SE when he put them he said he placed them when they came out in the morning it was like all covered everywhere and the Bible says that when they came out they said what they said is this mana and Mana means what is it so he didn't even know the very thing that God was going to provide for and it took a prophet of God to show them what the Mana was you see they didn't know what it was so the prophet had to now with his with his his staff now show them he says this is God's provided way and he showed him that the very thing you need go ahead and need it but he said just get enough for it today don't go sticking in your tent and think you ain't got to come to church till two more months till next Easter come on now no he said that you got to get up every day for this food you got every day to eat this stuff and he's telling it'll be good every day cuz it's going to be fresh from Heaven see this was angel food this stuff came down from heaven that God sent for his people and you see they didn't know what it was but God said to just keep it as a testimony and he said I want you to take this Cor in the seat and I want you you to put it and I want you to take a armor of it and an eper and he said that's just an amount I want you to take amount of this a ten and I want you to put it in the ark of the testimony and he said I want this to be a testimony for all generation to see what I did for you how I fed you I want your children's children children to know how I fed you in a dry and ly land amen so you mean that God said and guess what in the in the Tabernacle congregation in the wilderness it says that now that you know you had a holy Place Mo out of court in a court and the most holy and it says as you went all the way in past the BR and Laver and you know and the um the Altar and everything you went all the way into the Tabernacle when you went all the way in which only the high priest could go and you went all the way into the most holy place it says in this place it says it was beautiful when you went past these curtains you couldn't even tear them with your hands and when you went past it says now when you go in this place that this is where the sh glory of God would come and it says he had two Cher rooms that everything was outlaid in gold and the two CH on would face each other with their arms outstretched and with their arms outstretched this place was called The Mercy Seat and on The Mercy Seat this is where he would come in and he would have the blood and he said he would come and sprinkle seven times Eastward he would sprinkle now the blood and apply it to the mercy seat and the mer mergency seat now in this place it says now in here they kept in this Arc of the Covenant they kept also now the two stones that was written to Moses they also kept it says a rod and you know what kind of Rod that was right it was an almond tree and it had because when it was in the presence of God it brought forth almond that's the only reason we know what it is by the fruit that it bear oh come on so he said when God would come down we could see that's an Al and it was aon's Rod but it said but it was something also in this place it was something hidden it was something now where you could Feast on forever that would be in the heart of the believer for he says for generation and generation to come and he said it would be now the very testimony of now Angels food that God would keep fresh that would not spoil that would be in the heart of man for ages to come and it will be a testimony saying that God now made away and you see this was that hidden bread in there and Jesus came and he said now he said that man cannot live by bread alone am but you would have to in your heart have bread you can Feast on day after day after day just to know that he lives I hope you see this tonight so you see it was a hidden thing it was a man tucked away with God tucked away in a place that he was hid one him and God now having Fellowship but it was bread he was feasting on it was anointed bread so I let me just read something to you I I made a little I made a little I made a little uh note here and I want to read it was something there was something the message I wanted to read to you but look at this with me uh Lord Lord help me yeah let me just go ahead and read it to you now look that's the way every believer throws himself on the outside and this is talking about the in and out of Courts it says it says out of the courts into the veil in the Holy Place into the veil where Christ is and you hide your life away and you'll be refreshed budded Blossom and bear fruits of the spirit amen you'll be a worker in your community you mean an hour you'll do something hold on I believe he said you should Blossom where you planted yeah so you see it makes no good you see now for me to he says well I do this over here I do this over here but what about here yeah you see God if God have me here God means that it must be a work for me to do here he said maybe not in Texas maybe not in he said uh Korea but he says it must be something here it must be people that now are feasting on the word of God remember he said believing from the heart he said that God has to furnace the audience God has to do it he said God pulls people from here from there and he puts them here for a certain place for a reason so now here we are you'll be a worker in your community you'll do something for God and he says you'll be a soul winner for Jesus come on now let's not let down the promise you will be brother you'll be a soul winner for Jesus brother you'll be a soul in that's what it said so now you must just walk into brother Troy and know that now it's not because you said so is because God said I vindicate that I have you here for a reason and you will win soul for the kingdom that's why we're here that's that's the only reason we're here you are not your own so we're we're living our lives for others and he says here he says and you'll be a new person old things will pass away tradition of men will fail but your heart will be burning with the love of God your heart now let's talk remember what that heart is that mercy seat and he says inside this place where they took this old rod and L it in the presence of God God living in the glory over the chams that Rod all happened at once brother and sister to A Life That's consecrated and lays before God it'll change them as certain as I'm standing on this platform tonight it'll take all the fight out of you it'll take all the difference out of you it'll take all the isms out of you it'll make you a real Christian if you'll just get into his presence amen you see that bread would spoil outside of his presence that bread meant nothing outside of his presence but now in his presence in his presence Hallelujah that bread was even a testimony you see when you think about bread a lot of us today if you meet people it ain't many people you'll ever meet in your life that don't eat bread now you I like bread and you see think about now it ain't many people you meet how many people you know in your family allergic to bread see a people allergic to bread so God said we all we need bread I get so you need bread don't think you don't need bread but it says now bread is something that most people in the world eat and you know that oh let me I me f I just wrote something down you know it's eating by all and the breaking of bread as Jesus did is a symbol of International Peace it means peace when you break bread and he said and the person if the the the going thing if you were sitting at a table if you eat the last piece of bread the S is you're supposed to go kiss the cook if you eat the last piece of bread so I want you to think about that now the last piece of bread oh let me just jump ahead you see how you treat the bread shows your attitude toward God Amen I hope you see it's all about how you treat the bread oh Lord we get there I say oh Lord It's All About The Bread God now Jesus said I am the bread I am the life now I want you to see remember when it came down to the time of now it was time for him to go to crucifixion and they had the Passover remember you could see of how Jesus said they said who is going to be the one that's going to do what going to deceive you going to lift you up who's going to betray you and he said it'll be the one in whom I take and give stop to so Jesus now when the Bible says when he they took communion and when it came down to when he took the bread yeah he dipped it in and it became soof yeah and when he gave it to Judas it was all about now how Judas took that bread yeah and it says after he took the bread what happened Satan entered into his heart you see now it he had an issue with Jesus because now he couldn't really digest that bread Oh Glory to God you see the bread is Christ and it had no part in here remember John 8 the word had no place to abide in Judas so you see now it came to a place that God was going to show the world what the bread really was when they had issue with Jesus Jesus didn't back up Jesus said he said ah he said unless you eat my flesh and unless you what drink my blood you have no part of me so he says until you know and realize that I am that bread then you're going to have problems you're going to have issues but if you know how to treat the bread when he saw his two disciples and he walked on the road to the ma they sat in his ministry he was their pastor and after three and a half years they had the wrong Revelation and you let me tell you you can have the wrong Revelation and Jesus be your pastor because it's not until the Holy Ghost comes down amen and he said then you can really understand what's being said then now you might go off and say something that the pastor ain't say yeah you may go some and say read say something that you ain't really read yeah you see why because in your heart something hasn't dropped down yet so God when see when they had issue Jesus never backed up that's why he said unless you eat my flesh and my blood until you you may see the son of man ascended and descended and he said now everything he told him as he kept moving he kept given him more Revelation and he asked to dis offend you and then when he turned he only had 12 yeah and you see he never backed up giving them Revelation because he knew even his disciples didn't understand but it was how they treated the bread am they couldn't walk away from because they knew it was life in they knew it was sustain him they knew would keep them now I hope you see this morning is this the same bread that we have the bread don't rot the bread don't it don't die but the bread is eternal oh somebody hope you see it the living bread you see this is what we're feasting on now he said whatever he says the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together and tonight when Jesus came down here and I just want to read when Jesus came down here and he tried to show the Breen how important it was he was only trying to give them example so that then they wouldn't deter because see if you don't have understanding of something it takes God to really come and Quicken it to you but you must sometime be patient you must sometime wait on the Lord and you see if you in if you in the kitchen and you making a cake it says you can't just put it in there okay I tell you what 10 15 minutes you got 15 minutes if I don't get them 15 minutes H we got to move on we going a little de no you say you got to sit there and wait on it right and you put that cake on there and they say what you better not be jumping in the house right come on y'all s up make you better cuz what my cake going to fall you going you going to hurt my bread come on now so you see it's all about how you treat it even when it's in the oven you must be gentle oh you see you got to it's good bread now nothing wrong with him but you want to come out right so that's why he says even John said I must decrease so he can increase why because he's the living bread it wasn't John so God now he's coming and he's trying to show that all throughout the ages this bread was hidden and and you see in the Old Testament that everybody couldn't go in and see this Omar but only the high priest so over time you see as it's hidden away you had to believe that now when that high priest went and settled the price for sin when you brought your sacrifice that the atonement would be paid for you had to believe that this man of God would could do the work because of because of what God Said what he told Moses so now you look at this now through the Bible if you go back and look every man of God they had even Fellowship around bread the Bible says when God met Abraham on the plains it says that when they had a little foot washing he went and slew a fatted cal that he went and he made bread also and we read this morning remember it says that the whole offering that when the when Elijah came to the widow woman it was now go fetch me a morcel of bread amen so you see God was trying to show man that yeah you need to eat but you can't that's the substance of bread alone is not going to keep you it's got to be something spoken over that bread it's got to be some life in that bread amen he told him in the Old Testament Deuteronomy he said now 16 he said that you must keep all the leaven out of the bread so the bread wasn't derise it was supposed to be pure all the way from gener genis to all the way to Revelation supposed to be pure bra now and you look now look at this I want you to turn with me just want to take a h h just a little a subject for for a second and flip for remember time with me to roof and remember Jesus said in Luke 3 remember Luke um remember Jesus said Luke 11 Jesus made a comment he said which of you he said seeing that your your son is hungry he said and he asked you for bread do you give him a stone he said none of you right because you know a stone is not something he can assum assum is not something that he can digest and in John remember John Revelation he said when you eat the book John it'll be like honey in your mouth but it'll be bit in your stomach because in order for you to keep this bread down you must love it you see if you don't love this bread it come right up you throw it up everywhere because it has to be something keeping it down because your body wants to now fight what what you eat amen but the enemy it wants more of that bread amen so I want you to see just an example here as we reading look at this right here remember a little story and we know the stories go back to Ruth and Ruth now being a moabit woman remember it was uh IMC and you had Naomi right and it says now as they were down there it says that they were walking with the Lord and elomi means you know pleasant but she lost herb husband she lost her two sons and she had only had her daughter-in-law because her two sons died they left Bethlehem Judah which is the house of God's bread and it was praise in there it was blessings and promise if they would stayed in the land but because they left now it said a famine came when the famine came things started to dry up and they left their position in Christ and so as they're here elim like Naomi's husband as they died it says remember they had orah and roof and you look at here these two women these two women now they had the same in-laws they saw the same testimony but even though they saw the same thing it says now they looked at it differently and now or now it came to a place that they said when the son-in-law died Naomi said look girls y'all might as well go back to where you come from I mean even if I have a son even if I get married and I have a son you gonna wait till you raise up and get old for you to you know basically have a family with him and they thought about it and the Bible says they both cried orer cried roof cried and as they both cried they were both because they both were faced with the same decision but now orah and then she says now look she says why w't you go back why don't you just go back and Oprah maybe looked at it again and she thought about it Ru looked at her again and thought about it and opa came and opah said you know mother-in-law I love you but I got to go get me a man I need me a man so she went back to what she said her own Gods let's drop down and read it it says what was that it says uh oh look at verse 15 and she said Naomi said to Ruth Behold thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people and unto her Gods return after thy sister-in-law so she wasn't just going to get a man but what she was going she was going back to her gods and she thought it was just going to get you know somebody to bring her Comfort she had every right but he says when she left Naomi she was leaving off something but I want you to see now but there was this Dove woman and this Dove roof she could not leave Naomi a dove likes Pleasant things but what she saw was a woman that lost her sons lost her husband was out of position was suffering but she looked at this woman and she said I cannot leave she looked at her and she says no she says I'll go where you go amen and she said your people will be my people and your God will be my God so now Ruth goes and she starts following her mother-in-law now you can't say that mostly in our day you know like mother-in-law I tell you what we got to go but you see but this is what she did so it was really something just to see that her mother-in-law God was God so as she went to follow this path now look what happened now the Bible says that if you just drop down to let me drop down to chapter let's just say uh oh let's go to chapter let go to chapter two real quick and look at verse two so Ruth said to Naomi let's go to the the field and let's glean ears of corn now you know to make bread you got to have corn and you see that you see she was at a time that it was gleaning time and she was in a land that she had no representation but she goes back and she's gleaning now the stubble and she finds favor in the eyes of a man named Boaz now look at this now and look it says in verse 10 why have I found Grace in thine eyes that thou should us take knowledge of me seeing I'm a stranger and Boaz says because brother keing because I've seen your labor of love because I've seen how you treated Naomi because I've seen how you watched over her because I seen how you lifted her up I seen how you said that her God was God and he said that it says it's just something about you and Boaz says he says it's just something about you so you find Grace in my eyes so as he tells it this now let's keep looking it says now in verse 14 Boaz says and at Meal Time come hither and eat of the bread and dip thy mors so in Ben so now you see in the Book of Ruth that here is God and as the kingsman Redeemer Boaz he's trying to show in his Redemptive plan that now Ruth needed something and what she was searching for was she was looking for bread and she was sitting this CLE looking for bread looking for bread and now it even says that she was invited to eat bread with the kingsman Redeemer to now to eat at his table to be like just like he was so she was pulled in because of the grace of God and as she's sitting there he said now he tells his servant he said now let in verse 16 let some handfuls of purpose just let it fall I don't know how you want to do it but just just maybe do it and just do like this you know just do like this and he says whenever you drop it leave that roof because it was already picked so she didn't had to glean this way all she had to do was praise the Lord glory to God so she knew how to treat the bread cuz she knew she didn't glean for this and you see as she's working and look oh Lord God as she's working now she's being noticed and it comes to a place now I want you to see this that then as she's keeping her mother-in-law look what happened in verse in chapter three that Naomi her mother-in-law said to her he says I'm just read my daughter shall I not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee so Naomi now is moved one day spirit of God moves over brother and says to her you've been working so hard you've been gleaning the field you've been taking care of both of us and the bread that you get that's some good bread it's some sweet bread and he says and now it says why don't you let me find a little rest for now here is the pleasant mother-in-law telling this sweet Dove that God has rest for you and it says if you would just allow him he said this is what you need to do he says Boaz is a close Kinsman to us and what you need to do is you need to go and I'm going to tell you exactly what you need to do you need to go and lay at his feet as he tells him go lay at his feet and when you lay at his feet he said just be covered up you go out like you know secret like you're you're wrapped up because is a catching away and you just go and lay at his feet and just rest cuz you've done everything you could do and you see now that you done everything you do all you can do is lay at his feet and the Bible say I got to read it to you and the Bible says that in verse n at midnight when he woke up it says now he saw her laying at his feet and he said who art thou and she answered I am rof thine handmade spread therefore thy th skirt over thine handmade for thou are a near kin Redeem Me Oh Lord Redeem Me Oh Lord now he said redeem me you're the only one that can do it I'm laying at your feet and I've been getting all this corn because we need bread and I've been doing it because it's not just but eat because I see God in it so just let me lay at your feet at midnight a cry was made and she had enough oil just to lay at his feet everybody couldn't lay at his feet but she could and she says he says blessed be thou of the Lord my daughter for thou has shown more kindness in thy latter end than at the beginning oh Lord in as much as thou has followers not rich young men not young men but whether poor nor Rich so you wasn't looking for a poor you wasn't looking for a man that's the three bees buff got a Bentley in a big bank account he said you w looking for that you was looking for now somebody you could lay at his feet he didn't care whether he was young whether he was old all you wanted was a man that loved God he said and now you has it's something more sweeter about you now than even when you first started come on now if something sweeter this is what Boaz is telling because he brought came to the Plan of Redemption brother ISAC he was bringing her to something special with his own special bread with his own special feed this was God bringing his wife because he said she'd be without spot wrinkle blemish she'd be glorious she'd be set apart and she lay at his feet she's precious in His sight and he says now he says look T the night and it will be in the morning that I will perform that if he will perform unto thee the part of a Kinsman well let him do the Kinsman part so look at this now oh Lord God if you turn over look and I'll just read in verse 15 she lay his feet till morning and it comes in verse 15 it says bring the veil he said that thou H has upon thee and hold it and when she held it he measured six measures of bar and laid it on her and she came she went into the City and when she came to her mother-in-law she said who art thou my daughter and she told her all that the man had done to her and she said these six measures of barley he gave he me for he said to me go not empty unto thy mother-in-law so he didn't send her away empty hand but he gave her something so she could continue to make bread now he gave her only six measures because he couldn't complete it until he comes back my brother he only gave us six he gave enough all the way to the journey but when he comes he said you prophesying part you KN him part but when that which is perfect is come when it's perfect is come then now you got some rising in your oven it's your oven you are the place where God now puts the bread oh God God oh hope you see so he comes and my brothers he's there and now she tells her mother-in-law she said this is all he did but she says sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he have finished this thing so now the thing was finished and she said he will not rest oh come on somebody do you know it's him that walketh among the seven golden candlesticks is him and as he keeps walking the Bible say he's not sitting he won't rest no day or night because he said behold I come quickly and my reward is with me so he's sitting there he's walking brother he's looking over looking at all the Candlestick looking at all the lights and he wants to make sure the light don't go out this is what he said oh Lord God look at how she treat this bread and now here's a woman a moabit who now God now brings into the Plan of Redemption and now she called Brother Andy here she is is now and she takes on as you know the story she marries Bo and remember when she found him she knew it had to be good times because remember when she went and laid on the threshing floor he was sitting on a big thing of of corn a big thing a week so she knew that now God was going to take care of everything look at his position he was a man of the bread he was the Baker and you say this everything was in Christ everything is in Christ and it's God in Christ reconciling world to himself and he says now here we are through the ministry of reconciliation we're sitting here and now look as he's here we know the story as you keep going down further it says that then they go and they get married and now Ruth and Boaz they have a good time and now they say oh Lord let me just let me just read this to you it says now look they they give her all the blessings and the Bible says so Boaz took Ruth to be his wife and when he came into her the Lord gave her it says what conception and she Bears son and you look back at it you look at it clearly read all the generation it said they had OED and when OED came it said then OED beg got who Jessie and he said when Jess came he begot David and you see the 10 Generations it talks about from Fair ass to all way to David God had now removed the curse and now it was rejoicing again in the temple of God because now he says the wedlock thing had been done with it was now the bridegroom had taken his bride am and you see you see you think about it you see Boaz must have known something about Redemption he had to my brother because you see remember he say when see when he came about remember he probably thought about you know he said I wonder you know mama always talked about Redemption and you know who mom was it says remember when they went into Jericho there's a woman who he said was on the wall and the woman on the wall the Bible say she had faith when she did a good thing before the Lord and she hid two spies in order in the Flax on a roof and the Bible says when the house C when the walls came down that her house was on the wall well for some reason I don't know how but I can't explain it to you I'm sorry but her house didn't Crut Brother Rich her house was still you mean the whole house it wasn't the whole house it was the house with the scared thread Oh Glory to God and when it came down remember now it says she went and she married what a general in Joshua's Army named salon and he said now he said he could see that oh you know my whole family tree is all about it says what Redemption it's all about Redemption and so he knew exactly how to move into that thing because he could see if now if God could use her how come God can't use this more amen look at it now oh look at it look at it so you see here she knew how to treat the bread and now if we could just see tonight I want can't read all these to you not to keep you but I want you to look at this one with me turn with me to Mark 7 look at this what Mark said and I oh Lord God it says remember I just read to you in verse 24 when Jesus was walking the Bible says he rose and went into the boards of Ty and City and entered into the house and would have no man know but it could not be hid for he was famous and there was a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit and said unto him and heard of him and came and she fell at his feet now it said when she fell at his feet the woman was a Greek s phenician Woman by nation and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter but Jesus said unto her let the children first be filled for it is not me to take the children's bread and to cast it to the dog so this woman she had a problem and she needed God to come and move but when she fought her way all way to God it wasn't for herself it was for her daughter and when she got all the way to him the Bible says she fell at his feet y'all and Jesus said it's not me for me to cast the children bre so imagine that being you tonight and you think that you search high and low far and wide it says for the true revelation of the Gospel but you're at the feet of Jesus and Jesus tells you he say it's not a good thing it's not the best practice it's not it doesn't make good sense for me to take the children's bread and give it to a dog why would you take a steak from your baby a hot dog and give it to your dog why would you do that he said no the children going to eat so now here's a woman saying I'm at jesus' feet this is God himself and he's saying that I'm a dog and he's saying that you know he's not even GNA feed me and he's telling me that you know he can't do nothing for me but yet he's God now she could not change her name she couldn't change where she was born she couldn't change her parents she couldn't change nothing about how she was raised but she could follow this and she did all she could Lord brothers sisters she did all she could and at his feet when she heard this hard sing that Jesus comes and he looks and he tells her this and the woman stops and I don't believe the woman ever moved but at his feet listen how she answers him and she answered him and said yes Lord yet the dogs eat the table eat the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs God how could God move on that come on now how could God move how where could he go come on somebody how could he go anywhere he said if I got to get under these chairs she says if I I still want that same bread and she said don't give me no other bread but the children's bread if I just get a little crumb and all I get is a little crumb if it even hits the ground it'll bless me Amen to God bless me because she knew what the bread meant yo she knew what the bread meant to her the bread was a real bread she said if it's good for the children it's got to be good for me amen and Lord if I'm a dog let me sit under this table but Lord just bring on the crumb and you know what see if you get enough crumbs get a whole Lo if you get them crumbs you might get a sandwich you say look at this if if you just get enough crumbs you see it was all about the bread that people were overlooking the Pharisees and Sadducees they said there's nothing to it they say it's no good they said it's rotten it's spoiled it didn't come from God but now this woman they had an issue God dropped down and said no this is some good bread this is some mob bread there's some garlic bread there's some cornbread it's better than any other bread you've ever taken amen it's the real bread so Lord God and he said to her for this same so now because of her faith and attitude toward the bread that was hidden to most of the world remember Jesus said a little while he says what the world shall see me but you shall see because now Lord Jesus because he's hiding he's veiled behind flesh is the same bread it's the same spirit he's doing the same thing but he's hiding and it's only for those that got faith it's only for those that got faith that say Lord just give me a CR and here here she is now here she said look for this sake go thy way and the devil is gone out of thy daughter because of what she said so what about us tonight do you know what you said you see brother Adam if you want quiet and peace God will give you quiet and peace but it's what you say that's what he told Moses he says speak Moses why cry because he wanted Moses to see now remember when he said they put the when he was getting tired and they they were B they were going they were having the battle and the sun was going down in the valley and her and Aaron lifted up his arms right and it says as his arms was lifted that they won the battle as the battle was in Array but now as it came it says go and Whisper this in the ears of Joshua when he whispered this in the ears of Joshua he said you might not mean nothing to you but one day Joshua was in a tight Jamis him and he was fighting the same kind of battle and all that came to him was a spoken word of God with a keep and before he knew he just said Son stand still see it wasn't whispered in everybody's ear but it was in Joshua and it meant so much to him because he saw it was God PR and I ask you this not to keep but where is that bread today where is that bread today you said if he got to be somewhere and if it's if the bread is Jesus and it's still good then where is he oh Lord let's let's read this I had some couple scriptures John 6 John 6 not the way y'all keep it but I hope you see this my brother my sister how good it is it says look at this Jesus in verse 35 let's look at verse 3 3 well let me just start 31 I'm just going to read it our fathers did eat manner in the desert as it is written he gave them the bread which from Heaven to eat then Jesus said unto them verely verely I say unto you Moses gave to gave you not that bread from Heaven oh hold on hold on when I read my Bible Jesus when I read my Bible when I pick up the Torah and I look at the testimonies of what God did for our fathers that was Angels food that came I think I think you all from your doctr little I'mma listen to you go ahead on see that's the spirit in the L is are you listening or you just here are you just opening your ears or you opening your heart you see they said for verily I said to you but my father giveth you the true bread from Heaven Jesus told them the truth but now it was changing their hearts a little bit changing their mind mind trying to show him that look no no no that was natural food that but he says but my father giveth you the true bread from then said they unto him Lord ever more give us this bread and Jesus said to them I am the bread of life he that hung he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst so he's a whale and he's a bread Bast born in Bethlehem now look Oh Glory to God and he said I'm just going to drop down and he says in verse 45 and he says that it is written in the prophets they shall all be taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and have learned the father cometh unto me not that any man ha seen the father save he which is of god he ha seen the father verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life I am that bread of life and he says your fathers did eat man in the wilderness and are dead so what they had it was good for them it sustained them but remember he said they didn't have eternal life he said now they all die but he said now but this bread that I'm trying to tell you about he said I am that bread of life and this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die now look what he says in verse 51 Jesus says I am the living bre which came down from heaven Jesus is now showing us very clear that he's not just any kind of bread y'all he's not the bread you buy in the supermarket he's not the bread you can just go get on any shell he's not the bread that you can just hear any preacher preach he's not the bread that any Theologian can just know how to make he's not the bread that anybody could come and give you that will sustain you he says no but God said when he ascended on high he gave gifts unto me and he appointed some prophets evangelist pastors teachers he says what for the working of the ministry for the edifying the saint he said it would be perfecting of the Saints so God is now doing something and he's showing that now when he ascends that everybody don't know how to handle this brein and when Jesus came down he says clearly in verse 51 that I am the living bread now living bread is something that don't die living bread is something that's etal living bread is something that you Feast on day after day my brother hour after hour moment after moment living bread because it's always hot you see Jesus see Jesus worked the grill too remember when he was sitting there on the coast and he said have you found any meat my children and he said cash your nest to the other side and when they did they said oh Peter it's Jesus and G Peter jumped into the water he swimmed as fast as he could to the shore he didn't try to walk on one this time it was his faith just moving and when he got all the way there he said they found their heart's desire bread and fish he was sitting there working the grill giving them some hot bread it's nothing like Sister Sister Ruby hot bread that that to God y'all know I'm talking about that real bread anybody like Red Lobster bread come on y'all been a Red Lobster oh now you ain't raising your hand Lord see you that when you go when you go there let me tell you they put the cheddar in the biscuit my brother it's so hot and so Mo that if you hungry and you ain't got but $5 you can go there and get food you can get water and you can get bread and you be full and I mean you think it's so it's really nice so see bread I'm telling you something people love bread but something that's living it's not even compared to that God now I'm telling you it's something it's it come from Heaven y'all now this bread he say If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I give what for the life of the world so now he said if you want the very spirit that is on me if you want the same very word manifested in your life he said you must be partakers of the same and you must now believe that you come out of his side you must believe that you are very you are in his mind before the foundation of the world you must know that you were on the land book of life even then and now everything that happened in your life good and bad God knew it would be just so you could be in this point right now so if you're at this point now amen then that means that what we are what we are by the grace of God and now God is trying to now do something in our lives and the people he has us effect or influence in our Liv to bring them closer to him remember he said you will be a worker in your community especially in your home see that's where it starts and then now in this house as y said as for me in my house then his wife then his children then now his church then you see it says as for me in my house will serve the Lord and it said because he was living on that living bread now I just say this to you kind of just in just in closing it said look at this uh oh Lord look at look at this with me uh oh Lord I ain't G I ain't gonna read it but let me just finish this he said how can this man give us this flesh to eat and Jesus said to him verely verely I sayto you except ye eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you so eating this bread partaking of the body of Jesus Christ is so important and you see if we partake of the body then it shows that now we are partaking of him it will only manifest through our life that we are his and he is ours as we as we say this as we say this and we close let me read something to you and said said uh now he said this is the gift this is the gift it says I'm going to tell you a secret as I leave brother Brown speaking once more it says you've been sweet and kind and I've never exactly expressed this I know of public before well Brandon what is that gift he said it's a gift of knowing how to get William brand eyes away so Jesus Christ can live through a vessel just getting yourself out of the way I don't know you I don't know nothing about it but he does he's the one now have faith and believe say Lord that man doesn't know me but yet you said a little while the world Babylon Solomon won't see you but ye shall see me you shall see me for I will be with you all the way to the end of the world let us stand you believe that you see that you see my brother and sister the Bible say he that abideth under the shadow of the almight you see when we come into the secret place of Christ we are feasting on the body and I I would like just to see just in close the feasting on the body is an eternal thing it's a thing day by day where God is strengthening you and the Holy Ghost feeds off of the word so eating now on the body of Christ is very important because you go through up you go through down you'll have struggles you'll have trials and and tribulations but now if you could just feel Feast on that bread you see sometime you can come to church it says remember it says oh Lord I'm tired it's Wednesday but just ask God for you know what you say Lord if I'm feasting on your bread he said oh that's right son I give you he says and he you get to read you know your theophany is a little closer to you can maybe God just lay his hand on yourself and lay his hand on your shoulder he strengthen your body because you've done all you can do and that's what it was for her rof ran laying at boaz's feet she did all she could and when you're doing all you can we said this morning to stand stand as we just Clos I just I just said to you that remember we're only partakers of of one bread only part take us of one bread this is favorite kind of Bible verse read to you as we close it's uh Philippians and this what he says in verse seven six be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving and you remember when every time you go to eat you say grace you say Lord thank you and it says let your request be made known unto God and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and your minds through Christ Jesus finally my brother whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are good of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me Jesus says do and the God of Peace shall be with Brother come I say God bless you I tell you my brothers it's good you see if you have anything any need I want you just see tonight that remember he says the end time message is all about deliverance and it's now because we know there's a going home time and every chain of the devil is trying to keep you from now going until the final AR the final Ark which is Christ and now as we close this service I don't know if there's any needs any pray but if anybody has any need it says just let the Lord know by just raise your hand if you have any need
