turn with us to Psalms 23 please simple but powerful the Lord just gave me a little wisdom the other day I was just thinking basically what is acceptable before God what is acceptable it has nothing this has nothing to do basically with what I'm getting ready to preach what I was thinking about music and everything else and he took me back to the Word of God where it says that that will be done in earth as it is in heaven so everything that we do in an earth is supposed to be accepted if it can't be accepted in heaven we're not supposed to do it on earth if it's movies music dance whatever it is if you don't see where that can fit or be accepted in heaven you should not do it that's simple but it's powerful I was talking to a Christian the other day and I asked him because of the music that he was playing I I said is it supposed to be Christian music and I said well let me ask you a question do you really think they're gonna be singing that kind of song at heaven and he had to be honest and he said no I said well then if it's not gonna be accepted in heaven you shouldn't be doing it we are here to do the Father's will Psalms 1 I'm sorry 23 we're gonna read the whole whole of Psalms here through the 6th verse I just thank God for His mercy Psalms 23 1 through 6 the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou prepareth the table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever let us pray father we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us Lord that we have been to ourselves father there are times oh lord where we don't even know how to pray but lord you said your spirit will intercede for us and perhaps there are those here tonight Lord that need you to intercede for them Lord I need you all the time help us Lord that will seek not our own will but that will seek your will father and that will die to our old self I all will Amen that your will may be glorified father we're here just to say thank you for being the God that you are and in our name Lord Jesus Christ we pray thanking you for all things amen you may be seated I know this is just how I was thinking you know as God was giving me this message and I'm always seeking the Lord on what he wants me to do sometimes I'm just perplexed because I don't want to get up here and say what I want to say I really just want to say what God wants to say and you know something said we'll just brag on him tonight you know I really believe when I read Psalms here when I was reading it I thought you know David is not only talking about the goodness of God but he's literally bragging on because David said when he says I shall not want why because he's my shepherd and I thought about it like who is David talking about you know we a lot of people say they know God and they they really don't make Christians and all like I said it's one thing to know me my wife and I I think we were talking about this just this morning or last night everybody don't mind Savior but nobody wants Lord and then when it comes to God being your friend many people don't know him as a friend but you know what friend when you got a when you got God as your friend think about it the Bible said that God called Abraham friend and when you think about a friend that that the Bobby said a friend a real friend sticks closer than a brother well I can truly say this that God is above all friends right amen because when I need him he's always there I'm bragging on him because I realize who he is you know we're talking about not a secondary God or third we're talking about V God right in the message of Dobson brother Bell says let me before we go further he said I pick it up he says listen when God before he made man he called himself lol ah hello him that means he was the self-existing one I want you to understand this now because when you talk about Jesus Christ all you're talking about is that your Savior your Lord your friend your family is that right Oh sake Jesus ain't my family yes he is he's my mother he's my father he's my sister he's my brother he's my all and all Oh hallelujah think about it he's a self existing one Amen when there was nothing he was there listen we must understand that when we talk about the word when we talk about God we're talking about the word and the Bible said in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God that same word is still God hallelujah and the Bible tells us according to Psalms 33 and for for the word of the Lord is right and all his works are done in truth hallelujah so we don't have to worry about God leading leading us in error whatever God says he's gonna do that's what he's gonna do is that Alright we know that hey man he is the only according to the Bible he's the only you know III don't know how Timothy felt when he was writing that but Timothy say Amen he when he writes this he says when in in first Timothy 6 and 15 says which in his times he shall show who is the blessed and only potentate king of Kings and Lord of lords now he says now if he goes right back cuz you know Timothy you know he's he's how could I said he's one of those ones a man that know the grace of God hallelujah amen and he was taught by way of Paul Paul called him his son hallelujah so you and I must understand that Paul our Timothy knew God as God by Oh here ye o Israel the Lord thy God is one so here Timothy is right now the inspiration and he's telling a man he's bragging on him right he's the only potentate he's king of kings is that right I don't care how many kings Amen Rome has Herod Pilate it doesn't matter Amen we know by God's grace that all King his king of that King is that right the bouncer who talked about when he talked about this God he's not just talking about Ella him because he's bringing Ella him to us by way of Jesus Christ is that right the Bible said in the in him throughout the fullness of the Godhead bodily right amen and that means God the full God every attribute of God was in the vessel Jesus Christ that's why in John 10:10 one he's excuse me 10:30 he said I and my father are one he said to Philip when you see me you see the father so understand by God's grace he wasn't talking about his physical he was talking about the attributes hallelujah even that's what the bride is being formed into the attributes of God that's the image we won't hallelujah listen he says who had only have immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man have seen nor can see to whom be honor and power everlasting amen hallelujah Jesus Christ the one who dwelt in the light come on somebody in mortality you said what God is like want you wish you must understand that God is a spirit the light is just a clothing of God hallelujah cuz you can't see a spirit hallelujah but God clothed himself in the light and we call it the pillar fire hallelujah that same pillar fire is eternal hallelujah amen it is God what God my god is your God I want the devil to know that I can brag on him yes all what do you mean brother was you going through a hard time but he's still God hallelujah he's still God and no matter what times I go through he will always be God in my life hallelujah if God chooses never to bless me again he's still God hallelujah he will always be calm hallelujah doesn't matter how much Satan try whatever kind of tactics he has and then trying to destroy me I Got News for him my god shield me before the foundation of the world and I cannot be destroyed by time because before time was I am somebody help me here you and I must understand him and we were in him before the foundation of the lair and because we were in him before the foundation of the where he was eternal and eternal is greater than time hallelujah he got good to us yes sir the Elohim the self-existing one hallelujah nothing else existed for him there was no air hallelujah debris there was no light there was no stars there was no world there was nothing else it was God and God alone lolol him hallelujah well somebody help me you I don't know how he does it rich I don't know how he does it but he created air hallelujah God don't need Antony hallelujah he's a spirit but God knew we were gonna need ah but before the air was created I was there hallelujah you were there hallelujah he knew you were going to need that to survive in this well but when the breath of life is taken out of you hallelujah you'll never see in heaven amen those be up in his breathing I gotta have some air hallelujah why because the word lives alone Oh somebody help me here that's why they don't get tired they don't need to go to sleep hallelujah oh come on somebody they don't have to eat up there oh my listen you know David he's a good brag I like the way David brag on God he'd love to tell God all what God is and you know I don't know what the he's and God's thought about it you know but David you know was seeing his songs amen and David says and the heavens shall praise thy wonders hmm Oh Lord that Satan is also in the congregation of the Saints that had to be eating the devil up every word that came out his mouth had to be tearing that devil kingdom up cuz the devil he know he's jealous you know use me he's jealous and he wants to be God he cannot be God think about it he is such a great God this is his kingdom this whole slop this whole ruination right maybe this old this old ruin world hallelujah this thing that's fallen apart hallelujah come on this is the best the devil could do hallelujah the greatest kingdom he got is in hell hallelujah he many smells a stench huh come on somebody but my god I tell you what over there streets of gold oh there is no pollution hallelujah Oh over there where no shoes use it when I get all the other get go to the play no go to slippers hallelujah will be barefooted won't have to worry about nothing cutting our feet won't have to worry about stumping out toe hallelujah oh come on somebody well is it my god oh you and I have not policies I'll tell you what this God that we serve is so great eyes have not seen nor ear heard nor can enter into your heart what God has restored and has prepared for you is that right oh my goodness you need to tell me that having the Holy Ghost ain't just it no sir it's just a down payment what it's just a 10% hallelujah I don't know what the foot percentage is but the Bible tells me it meant that winners all over he meant God's grace will make us just like him hallelujah we will be in his very image and it's very like this it's okay I like bragging on him tonight hallelujah Amen O Lord that fakemon is also in the congregation of the Saints for who is in heaven can be compared unto the Lord Gabriel Micah wormwood one of the seraphim's what about the chair nothing can be compared hallelujah he so great is all all that's there is that right oh my who's among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the Lord hallelujah see that's what it is you know the devil think he could pull something he made me become a more mightier than God a man he can't do it hallelujah he pulled out Goliath Amen that time thought he was gonna scare ya he scared the church well he did hallelujah all Israel was afraid a man of that Goliath a man but that anointed bride by the name of David he wasn't afraid of it hallelujah him and then had the role songs he wrote this song Twitter card hallelujah Haven then I already talked about how to Lou you how God is great hey man it wasn't time for him to calm down let me tell you right now it's not time for us to card Oh hallelujah in the midst of all these things we need to stop praising God and freakin God for all that he's done all that he's doing amen he's worthy of our praise hallelujah oh my hey the Bible said God made it so that they overcame by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony I said if you don't start talking about Jesus what are you talking about ain't enough to be blood wash but somebody need to brag on him tell somebody Amen how good God's been to you brag on Jesus Amen because the Bible tells us every time we talk about him it's written in the book hallelujah he might brag on the name of the Lord hallelujah and what God has done for you and me God is greatly to be feared in the Assemblies of the Saints and to be had in the reverence of them of all them that are above him about him see if you reverence the name of Jesus it'll work for you hallelujah you got a reverence you got to realize that name of Jesus is above every name hallelujah and at the name of Jesus all every every knee shall bow did y'all hear me if it doesn't bow and this world is going by in the world to come hallelujah what are you saying and you saw all brother books I don't know see if you realize that you are literally cloaked in the name of Jesus Christ yeah the Bible said the whole family in Earth of heaven and earth it's named after him hallelujah so when I come into trouble all I got to do is call on the name of Jesus yes sir think what we don't understand faith works in so many ways hallelujah sometimes people think well I gotta find a scripture in here to vindicate my faith no shock hallelujah that woman with the issue of blood she didn't have no scripture hallelujah she didn't have a promise hallelujah amen but the Bible tells us that she said but if it's almost like she made her home promise if is that right that's fresh from the throne she said but if I could just but touch his girl hallelujah I will be made whole so she made our all promise and then fulfilled it by the grace of God will you make your old promise and God allows you to feel it and he's not he'd only have it written hallelujah what about the written promise somebody help me here what about the written promise huh is that right she had no promise of that but her faith without a promise got her healing hmm now if she could get her healing by her faith without a promise in that she was doing now how much oh we get our healing by faith in a promise that God is manifesting and vindicating before us and has brought it unto us by his word hallelujah and then come around and confirm it hallelujah is that true oh come on there's another group of people there was Shadrach Meshach and Abednego hallelujah there was no scripture said God Jehovah is going to deliver you out of the fire hallelujah but they made a promise they made a covenant that no matter how terribly get I will not bow my knee amen - the devil hallelujah hey man I don't care what kind of image the image of a beast the image of a man the image of a church he image of a woman I will never bow down to that image hallelujah not when I am the image the image of Jesus Christ come on car they men working himself through us huh can you hear me okay hallelujah God good to us I just got to brag on him tonight I won't even know I appreciate it all we show her brother when she's going through so much yes I am but at the same time he's still God though I walk through the valley in the shadow of death I fear no evil see you just that little poor man that just that little thing that he wrote there there's they're full of faith he's full of faith hallelujah and that's what you need amen that garden dis dis dis dis of abandon you nevel about you he never abandons up we are the ones who abandon him you're not getting in heaven without suffering hallelujah a lot of us want to owe you a thank geez oh I'm gonna sweep through the city you know we don't sweep with that cross that's what you don't sweep through you have a Christian grant bears across hallelujah it's good alright Amen you know them sweet times when God says time to grow up it's time to grow up and that's what it is right now we're going through some maturing times now what we have what's happening with us now where our eyes are being open to those things which are important even for us to make heaven in those things which are not and we are now being pushed to make choices will I continue to walk in the kola' mind and miss heaven or whether I will continue or will I repeat if my people they which are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways hey you can't seek his ways and don't do no turning you got to turn yes that's the sure evidence of a true repentance you must turn from your wicked ways and then when I hear from heaven and heal the land hallelujah were Lord you hadn't done well you hadn't done either the Lord to say you got to do something hallelujah you gotta turn hallelujah he didn't say I'm gonna turn you he said you must turn turn from your wicked ways when the Lord just delivered me you got to give it up something you got to do God don't just think about your okay you need sanctify and no you got to give it up that's your portion and don't tell me you can't do it the Bible said you can that same Holy Ghost power that feels you it's the same Holy Ghost power that sanctifies you and if you don't have the faith that the Holy Ghost can sanctify you how you gonna have the faith that God gonna feel you Alleluia amen like I heard about hallelujah it's all right yes all right amen ain't got good to us I just gotta brag on him you know we got we don't understand that sometime the devil be destroying our enemies at night we don't pray Lord you know how we do we shaking and shivering you know don't know how to outcome gonna be a man we want to believe but we're struggling hallelujah and God sees you in your weaknesses that don't worry about it I got it all covered hallelujah is that right we remember with the king of Assyria a man was going to kill we're coming and it was during the time of Hezekiah and everything else in there no Syria King was saying oh this is what I want to do I want to do this and I'm going to do this and God said don't you worry about it before this can't get any way I'm gonna take him out go read it how's that 37 33 to 38 is that Alright this is what God said for I will defend this city to save it for my own sake not yours his sake hallelujah and for my servant David shake hallelujah if you trust in the Lord the Lord would defend himself he defending you is only because you trust him you trust his word he will beef in his word you're just good to be there for my own sake he saying sometimes we thank God doing it because o God you know God you know he favors me he favors you only because you believe in love you trust his word hallelujah being the angel the Lord went forth and smoked in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and four score and five thousand and y'all think God can't take care of one wait a minute is he the same he's the same Paul said that's the same pill of fire that led the children of Israel out of me hey come on where where was he he was in Jesus oh and Jesus was in him listen overnight let me go of the let me read that again the in the angel of the Lord went forth and smote in the camp of the Assyrians hundred a hundred and four score and five thousand and when they arose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpse hallelujah hey man come on somebody think about it God watch even when you're sleep that's what I'm bragging on hallelujah even when I'm asleep God is working on my behalf he's working on your behalf why for his name sake what name sake the same name that you and I have the Bible said the whole are heaven in that we are we are his family and we are named after him because you're named after him he protects you oh Lord I just don't know when it's gonna happen don't you worry God the Bible said the God here is the prayer of the righteous the lujah amen I love the Lord you love the Lord you lie to me 1046 behold they haven't in heaven behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD thy God who the earth also with all that therein is so there is a heaven there's another heaven and there's a heaven in heaven it keeps going up hallelujah see the thing about it is you and I must learn how to trust God our problem is ain't God it ain't the word that were I've been standing before we were born and it's gonna continue to stand the Bible says the grass withers and the flowers fade away but what it is we don't like to get nervous we don't like to get out our comfort zone we don't like Amen to get to a place and then we feel like am I going too fast we can't we feel like you know we lose control thank you that's what he wants he wants you to lose control hallelujah now he said what do you mean look at look at Moses here's the man Amen man of God Amen Moses was a king did you know that God don't call him a king but he was God just don't take a peasant Amen and have him come up heat he make that he make them that he make the thing right right he bring the paddle together Amen in and you know he don't have this thing where if anything he's he appears to be the lesser hmm he appear to be the lesser but in reality he's the greater y'all known him saying he takes a little shepherd by the name of Moses who was a murderer right a refuge Iran Iran but with refugee a man running away brings him back a man and here Moses can't even talk right now the poor done won't worked him over hallelujah Haman and here he is standing up there in front of the Pharaoh and you know Pharaoh you know he you know he can see you can see Pharaoh not puffing his chest out let my people go you don't even have a donkey or horse you don't have nothing you coming here all dirty y'all notice a and you telling me the king of Pharaoh hallelujah but you see Moses was not trusting in his ability he was entrusting Amen that same God he met up on the mountain hallelujah and see Pharaoh didn't know that it was Kingdom against Kingdom Oh Lord that's what it is now you don't look like much but God chose you to go against Satan's Kingdom oh come on somebody think about it out of all the ages you have been chosen to bring down Satan's Kingdom in Satan's Eden think about it ha because it's not you it's him in you hallelujah we don't quit no sir ain't no quitting in us hmm is that right that's the Bible the Bible said a just man falls seven times in the day and get up say say you getting up again hallelujah yeah I'm getting up again that's right why there's no quitting in me think about it if the Sun was not rising and all of a sudden quit where would the world be great is our faithfulness it's not me it's not you it's him who's great in us that makes us faithful y'all know his goodness spitting everywhere hey man listen what he says only the Lord had a delight in the fathers to love them and he chose their seed after them even you above all people as is as it is this day right Oh y'all think y'all somebody else y'all more than everybody else here the truth of the matter is it's true I didn't do it he did it you gonna get mad with him he did it right that's what the Bible says even you all above all people nothin righteous about us but God look at us and says hey I want you he told me that before I knew about Elka Sam hallelujah I won't you hallelujah and I'm like glad you won't me Lord because I need you hallelujah amen yes I'm gonna brag on him why cuz a man that was so messed up like I was messed up and now God got me preaching his gospel explained it to me even if I wasn't preaching he give me grace to sing for he give me grace to come to church he give me grace amen just to be in his presence we don't realize God takes time and come down here in Linda's little church and we are feel his anointing hallelujah what a privilege people we are I'll never leave you know what I forsaken he said oh the devil want to break this relationship he cannot hallelujah some time he try to break the fell oh but he couldn't never break a relationship this is blood-related hallelujah this is blood-related car aw too late for this this is not some playing God making up as he goes hallelujah the Bible said he may he he had already thought of he and I already finish the Bible said this thing was finished before the world began hallelujah like I was telling somebody how ain't got time to think where I am I saying I'm sorry not because I feel it not because I've speaking tones hallelujah why because it's wild I am and I trust his word oh is it a lot of people they need going to hell because they can sing in breach and a lot of singers and preachers are in here right now hallelujah come on somebody but when God favors you hallelujah and when God favors you there's nothing that Demma can do about it hallelujah we're privileged we're blessed that God favors us but made in favor of us his own will his own choosing hallelujah and the Bible said God cannot deny himself a man circumcised therefore the four skiers of your heart and be not no more stiff neck don't be stiff necked what do you mean don't want to believe it is that right remember Peters that you stiff neck hard to believe why it's so hard for you to believe that you bribed why is it so hard for you to believe that God chose you what I'm so hard to believe I don't understand what people are doing the point is you stop looking at yourself and look at Calvary hallelujah that's where the victory is not in you it will never be in you hallelujah how do you think Thomas must have felt Florida God I like Thomas a lot of people don't don't care for him you know they think we're doubting Thomas well the one thing I love about dr. Thomas he was real he wasn't faking it cause everybody else said I hadn't seen him I know he Thomas it ain't believin none of it until I put my hand in his side and it's where the wounds are that's when I you know yeah God didn't tell him he wasn't blessed the Lord said but blessed are those who don't have not seen but he never told you Thomas you're not blessed because you didn't believe what happened God he didn't have to do it but God knew Thomas thought before he even walked through the wall hallelujah before I got out of his mouth Jesus and let me go show this guy hallelujah amen so he is a committee to become a believer he's a believer but he need to feel something that's how some people are then still they're believers but he got to feel something and God makes provision for them hallelujah ain't the Lord good mmm yes sure you know this is you know you think about how blessed you and I are amen because we have ears to hear yeah I tell you what sometimes I think about it this is the Bible said listen this is one of my favorite scripture John 10:27 236 my sheep hear with my voice and I know them and they follow me wait a minute my sheep hear my voice it doesn't say voices says voice that means whenever there's one boy for every age one voice hmm those people who wouldn't follow Luther guess what they were lost cousin it went Luther's voice it was God in Luther those who you said all brother Brooks those Lutheran's who did not follow Wesley they were because they not what they normally do is like the Pentecostal like when the Westley saw the pillar call shows a man guess what they said that's of the devil when you say such a thing is that be careful because when you say such a thing like that in this age you blaspheme the Holy Ghost and that's what the Luther's the West is they couldn't see that shot when speaking in tongues and all of that it was right in the word but because Luther didn't teach them that they thought it was wrong and the same thing with the Pentecostals they blaspheme themselves away from God you say they shouting in desert is bigger than thumbs and the Bible said that's the strong illusion delusion they will believe a lie what oh yeah brother and lean unto Him you know we you know he he wouldn't he wasn't of God you know God used him but you know when he got into that serpent seed that was over devil see they signed themselves away no matter how much shouting how much dancing how much running how much faith today the church how they pay ties Jesus said that's one thing they will not be forgiven when you call that thing that is of God of the devil that in my preaching to earth and it doesn't matter whether we believe that or not it doesn't believe it like so many people didn't believe Noah's Ark the rain no are you crazy did it rain it rain why cuz no say-so hallelujah y'all gonna hear me she we're blessed because he the Bible says my sheep hear my voice that's why we can't follow other people ministry because the Bible said and a stranger they will not follow I can't follow TD jakes in all of the mothers being got nothing you said brother well you can say that but it's the truth what what what in this age what trinitarian gonna make a rapture you don't even know who God is I'm not saying they're not saved I'm saying how many gonna make a rapture you look this is a wedding ceremony going on and you don't even know who you were married you don't even know whose name you're supposed to take you're gonna take Pentecostals and Baptist and Methodist and Catholic and even message people doing the same thing but because you belong to mrs. church don't make you rapturing material it's when you marry Christ Union night with Christ and that's when you are become not just bride but wife hallelujah there's got to be a uniting with you and the Holy Ghost and I ain't talking about in your lips in your tongue you can you can speak in tongues all you won't if it ain't in your heart you wasting your time and we ain't got time to wait that's what I'm saying God has been faithful to us by cuz we had a prophet God sent us a voice that were y'all sure why you keep getting known that it's like I try to tell people how you going to talk about uh uh how God delivered Israel out of Egypt with out talking about Moses are you going to talk about even how God travel took the children of Israel into the Promised Land and leave out Joshua you can't do it that's God's provided way mmm I don't know what y'all enjoying is like I am but I got a I got a brag on and I hadn't even come to my part yet second Corinthians 11 21 through 23 I love the way Paul brag on him cuz Paul didn't bag on him and just saying oh you know God been so good to me I can just tell you gave me a new car a new house and I knew this that I knew that didn't know what Paul said Paul should I speak as concerning reproaches though we've had have been weak howbeit we're in so ever any is bold I am bold also hallelujah now we're gonna have a praise and worship we're gonna battle up in this place hey man we're gonna see what you got versus what I got posted I'm speaking like a fool but let me say it any hair he said are they Hebrews so am i are they Israelites so am i are they seed of Abraham so am I and what is Paul fighting against false brethren who's boasting himself to be something when they're nothing that's what Paul says I'm speaking like a food because I'm not trying to be nothing he said I only know Christ and him crucified hallelujah I'm not here to glorify myself but if you're gonna go there let's go there are they ministers of Christ I speak as a fool I am more Oh Paul knew what he was a man you see that this message is the only message that really identifies Paul as a prophet everybody else he said though he's an apostle so when you say he's a property where you get that from I'll tell you where the Bible said that the word of the Lord comes to the Prophet and Paul wrote almost all the New Testament did God bring the word to him hey man hallelujah yeah man it Labor's more abundant in stripes above measure in prison more frequent in deaths oft Paul says listen I didn't testified about Jesus I don't proclaim his name everywhere they don't imprison me they don't beat me they don't kill me three times and I'm still standing hallelujah hey Paul you're doing real good here of the Jews five times received my farthest right save 100 my prize was out beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice I suffered shipwreck a night and a day I have been in the deep in journeys often in perils of waters in perils of robbers in perils by my own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils among the false brethren he said I I tell you what I meant y'all don't know what y'all talking about but I've been suffering hallelujah but I brag on it hallelujah I go cry my tears I ain't gonna show Oh Lord why me I want you to know by God's grace amen I considered this honor to suffer for the name of Jesus hallelujah in weariness and painfulness and watch watching often a hungry and thirst in fastings often in cold and ignis it's shame us how we can't even go Amen without one meal a day and thought oh god why am i suffering you ain't suffering let's go a couple of days let's do a week and then they've called Nepal you still ain't there yet y'all hear me Amen and weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness besides those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the cares of all the churches who is weak and I am NOT weak who is offended and I burn not Paulson I'm I'm preaching to you now but I'm not mad at you I'm not I'm not angry I'm just telling you it meant because you're making yourself something I want you to measure yourself to what I've done and let's see how much you come up if I must need glory our glory of the things with concern Lyon Furman oh I'm gonna glory I'm gonna glory in the things that are concerning my infirmities right the God and Father our Lord Jesus Christ which is blessed for evermore northern that I like not pulses and what I'm saying to you is not alive and I got guard it's my witness hallelujah is that right sometimes we just gotta call God on the scene we forget he's here we think I think I think we think God has just locked up in this on his pages but God is a spirit folks hallelujah don't you understand without the holy God we wouldn't have this holy book hallelujah God washed over his word Oh I don't care how many virgins they got going on around here a man we know they're named virgin I don't care how many books they got around here call this some kind of new something new that and new that I said dad never knew it he knew in order to see the whole church as a large he had to change this and he's done a good job but the real seat of God give me the King James Version I try to tell somebody about that I said listen if Luther and Wesley and those Pentecostals saw God move in such a miraculous way with this book then that's the kind of book I want hallelujah because in this book is the real recipe y'all give me somebody man but Paul says listen but I certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for I neither receive of a man neither was I taught of it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ in other words I'm founded on the foundation that Jesus said I ought to be founded on and that is the revelation of Jesus Christ hallelujah nobody taught me Jesus I repeat he it was revealed to me I met him he could say hallelujah oh when I said whoever our Lord he says I'm Jesus going to God he Paul is giving a real testimony amen but you have heard about conversation in time past in the Jews religion for how that beyond measure I persecuted the Church of God and wasted it posters I wasted it a minute and profited in the Jews religion about many of my equal in my own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my father's hallelujah but when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by His grace you mean to tell me that God allowed me to persecute those people he allowed me to call some of the blaspheme and all along I was still on his book hallelujah it's just that my appointed time had not come yet nor to God let me tell you something we've done a lot of evil hallelujah we've done a lot of wrong hallelujah but one thing for sure God call us amen even when we would come out of our mother's womb our names we're already written on the Lamb's Book of Life hallelujah and we've been called for purpose hallelujah yeah million I thank God that I am NOT just something floating through the air but you and I Amen we are part of his word you couldn't get away from it if you wanted to girl ain't looking at your weakness God is looking at the word if you've been part of your part of the word God I gonna say oh my god it just look like they ain't catching up I didn't catching it ordained don't you worry about it God will lead you like a lamb oh he's gonna drive you like a cattle he gonna get you there and at the end of the day you're gonna still say hallelujah amen you go still say crazy Lord hallelujah you know I think off every battle I'm going through you said well why brother because I see his love and mercy for me you know that's the truth gray if I had to deal with myself I would have been long known if I had to be the judge of somebody like me I'm a judge no judging you and I'll here boy right you know but God look we are he see that representation in your heart that is something you cannot mimic it is not something you can thank for something like a magnet keeps drawing you hallelujah what is it that little thing in you oh can I say like that that little baby haha being impregnated by the Holy Spirit oh that's what it is it ain't your mind your mind you crazy up there hallelujah that's why God said let this mind be in you garden already asked your mind out hallelujah yeah I'm glad about that one now praise the Lord hallelujah I'm feelin so good tonight I even feel drunk I neither received a man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ for you have her and this is what I'm saying once you're taught by the revelation of Jesus Christ amen nobody can take it from you you'll be willing to give you a head on the chopping block because you know Jesus Christ is God but he kisana God let me put it this way he's God he's the son of God he's king of kings he's Jehovah Jireh he's all these things you said well how can that be because He is God y'all looking at the flesh part yes by flesh he was son that brother Wednesday when he went down to Lazarus and he stood then well he said that was a minute he said but when he said come forth he said that was more than a man and that's all I'm saying hallelujah it's the same with you Amen wewe heard we have pain but when God is speaking he let you no more it's called hallelujah and it's at that moment you and God are one lelou you man people don't understand it's like this you know how many times you lost something in holy places over there tell you exactly where is that and when you go what's happening now God could have got that thing and blew that thing to you but he wanted to be a part of it he wanted to rejoice with you that you trusted him to believe that it was over there you went over there and you got it and now you and God are one at that moment he don't leave you out is that right you think God could not have told uh uh Paul what he needed to do no God uses men like I was telling somebody the other day y'all heard me say I said here all these years amen we see Phillip talking to the eunuch and all of a sudden they come upon water like Abraham came up upon a a ram where did it come from they in the desert hmm the same God as Jehovah Jireh huh sometimes gotta hide money from you because he knew you're gonna need it down the road I mean anotehr hallelujah you go in your pocket and you feel like it instruct go cuz the $20 bill is in there oh I needed that maybe I'm the only one but if you Hey ha ha ha I found money in my own pocket in at the right time y'all believe that it's true I told you my mom was a Christian I done told you this testimony I'm not gonna be too much longer but I gotta brag on him even when I was a child I used to my brothers and sisters you take my money from me i i'm the worker you're not go working i had to hide my money one time I hid my money from me couldn't find it and one day my wife my mom would say judy was just Buddha's refrigerator for me I'm just changing around I don't know what inspired her to look under that carpet that would know him she looked under one shade of you the Lord blessed me I said mama that's my money she said the Lord hallelujah she cheek I lost that money for her she never gave it up y'all hear me it was okay oh lord have mercy you said what brothers would you say how many times people have lost money you found it they lost it for you because there were no way around with no way you can turn it in hallelujah see that sounds very strange brother we'll talk about it you know he says listen he's i'ma brag on God he said because I won't and that's what he did the whole time he never bragged on himself he I didn't do it he did it right remember the little Mexican baby a man that had the cancer and everything you know hallelujah then there was one a man that died this young lady died at the day before so and she ran and went to the meeting you'll because she had heard so many great things that went on and had they had all the Deacons and preachers had to fight this lady she was climbing all over their backs and everything trying to get in the prayer line then all of a sudden while he's looking out somewhere here is this Brown looking baby a man standing in the midair what is he saying I didn't do it well in fact I really he said I sent or King David's name he said I said what are the brothers there to go pray for him because we kind of the same size and everything else she would have known it then God stopped the show I love it hallelujah he stopped the show he said hold it wait a minute bring me that later in Tracy hallelujah what happened God took a baby that had been dead the day before and raised him up hmm that's my god that wasn't 2000 years ago that's my god that's your God and if he did it then he can do it now but we let our sisters control our faith sisters ain't got nothing to do with faith faith they call those things that be not as though they were I'm almost done people just just a little while longer Amen when we need help we got to call heaven ah hey man the scripture says Amen God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble any like like they say can I get a witness hallelujah Amen everybody ought to know that God helps in time of trouble yeah man therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed let me tell you something you and I we have not seen anything yet we're sheltered in it in this IO right now everybody have the earthquakes and everything else and we just I suppose you say holy you stay holy and as long as we don't lose our salt this place will be protected now I believe that I truly believe that but if we lose our save if we lose the effect and we get out and start doing all kind of stuff that we God judges not only you'll judge us but he'll judge this whole state because uh we are the Church of the Living God we're like Jerusalem hallelujah y'all understand me to Israel when Jerusalem held her salt when she hurled her strength as as a witness for the Lord they were blessed but when she did what she did and lost that strength she loved everything she suppose the hand was taken from he's the same God is that right look how bless I look at you you look at look at California when California the city of the Angels when California held that holiness and that righteousness you heard nothing about earthquakes but when God saw judgment because when tongs came did you know when the Spirit of the Lord fell in the zuzo street they had a massive earthquake and what was happening now tongues came in and tongues is a sign of the judgment people think the tongues is see that's what Babylon did Babylon when they were death that King and that Kingdom was getting ready to move out guess what was happening god handwriting on the wall was spoken in tongues and need an interpreter right the Gentile Age came in that way and it goes out that way that's how we know this is the end of the day cuz now everybody say it's the evidence of the Holy Ghost and it's not some Paul said that's the least of all the gifts they take you in the room and say ha yeah that make you say something and you call it the Holy Ghost and Cainan live it the Holy Ghost make you leader hallelujah he ain't gonna force you but he will make you yeah it calls it if you really want to live right the law to keep working with you therefore we're not fear though the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling there are there's a river the streams thereof shall make glad the City of God the holy place of the tabernacle of the Most High God God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved wait a minute you think God talking about a city made by hands he talked about you we are the city that cannot be moved oh the world I said God has a kingdom that cannot be moved you are in the kingdom and the Kingdom is in you I'm almost done amen you gotta realize and this is what I'm saying I'm bragging on Jesus tonight why everybody's making a mockery you know Jesus walked on the water he sho did why is that so difficult to really believe he rose from there yes he did well how do you know cuz he's living in me and people don't know God doesn't change God doesn't change people if only he not made a rapture was not no say he would say but he had to go through the Great Tribulation we don't even know how many people there were in Enochs name but one thing he not was smart he walked with God what about Elizabeth and her husband who house was so so holy today were visited by an angel doing everything they can do to do right God comes along said Elizabeth you haven't had a child yet but I'm gonna give you a special one mmm gave them John the Baptist so you got to understand there's always rewards when you live circumspectly through the word when you circumcise yourself to that word you might look like a fanatic you might have to walk by yourself they're mad but God will vindicate you hallelujah is that okay now let me get you know here it is 8:39 hmm let me I mean this is Bobby says wherefore God has highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every wait a minute God is bragging God highly exalted him and given him a name wait a minute wait a minute CEO you mean God has highly exalted him and given him a name above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth that includes angels demons the fallen ones and all of earth they that's why you said oh I'm closing that's my last know my last scripture and I got one more scripture in Revelation let me tell y'all something this is you heard me say this before that's why the devil don't like us and Jesus or Jesus Christ especially in public when you say God nobody pays you attention but when you say oh I just love Jesus the name of Jesus everybody look at you cuz this Satan's Eden and all them demons packing them people look at you like you had a place huh and that's how he's hushed the religious world you know it's not politically correct to be talking about religion in public hello that's a lie from hell what did God do on the day of Pentecost he had him preach it out it probably didn't have no building everywhere they went the Bible said they declared the Lord amen amen throughout the cities we're in public that's how they got caught now they don't want you to see it in public revelation 17:14 I'm closing I ain't brag on him like I really wanted to mmm these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them wait a minute what lamb you the land you are the lamb they talking about God in you the lamb that means you ain't carrying a sword naturally and you ain't gonna fight with that air mine but we fight with the world the sword hallelujah for he is Lord of lords king of King world that's greater than inhibition greater than any elder greater than any presbyterian amen and they that are with him are called and chosen and it's the word faithful I love it I you know I I just been saying to myself Lord it ain't about my feelings Gideon felt like he was a loser failure Samson surely was boring whether he felt like it or not he had made so many mistakes here it is now he's he's a spectacle they have a laughing at him I was all blinded poked out or whatever walking around that same wheel grinding for the for the Philistines but he was chosen he was elected and God had an appointed time hallelujah you wait on God I don't care how difficult it get you wait on God God has an appointed time and when they least expect it I love that see they didn't date they thought all the Christians they scared now they gone ain't nowhere no that you can't even find him not even one on the street no more brother Oh in all ways that they came a sound from heaven like a mighty rushing wind and the vows didn't feel the house set upon each of them made me like cloven tongues have to Wow Wow jumping out of the window running up the street I can see the devil running behind him shut him up shut him up but you can't put out a fire not like that one how you gonna put out a fire a man when the winds are high I love it hallelujah that's the kind of fire that kept over a pedagogue 120 people lit the Fate place up and was it five thousand three thousand I forget which one was first but it kept multiplying and it still lives today and that's why the devil soul man because out of all of his programs he still cannot shut to believer the true believers mouth it'll never shut up it will never die the Pentecost experience will never die there's no end to it it just takes us higher you love the Lord less than I heard brother Branham say this morning he said I'm a Pentecostal Baptist I'm a Pentecostal message people that's that's why I was a then from now on i'ma tell them that I'm not just message I'm a Pentecostal y'all better believe in protocol that's the only power that's gonna get you out they can say whatever they want to say let them say it you got a lot of demons that are preachers you know when Jesus came they were all in the churches everyone I was blocking away for G from Jesus and say yeah you would had a cloak at not icon and that's why the meant people the organization they don't like you they don't you talking about William Branham or you talking about a message they don't like you they know you got the truth they know you gonna expose something and they don't like you they'd rather call it a devil and a coke because they won't Day money they want their popularity hmm and Bobby says you know come on silly women you know those churches they know what they do it easy to say they'd rather have it that way they'd rather preach to be a lie yeah I want you to preach a lie to me now yeah that's what I want it cuz everybody's writing their own eyes they don't want correction you said well I you know they don't want correction you can't tell me what to do and all that kind of stuff but you know what what people who understand your past I have to give an account for you that said that one time before with some people I say you know what I'm gonna tell him to Lord there wasn't a beach in Holly come to church I have to keep records you know I'm an angel y'all know that I'm considered the angel of this fellowship and just a messenger people think well I can treat the Pat you can't treat me any kind of way can't do it you can but there's responsibilities and we re at a time where we don't understand that every church every angel of the church which is the pastor God has anointed him to anoint you by way of the Word of God to bring faith and then whatever is necessary it's true and you and I must understand that each position has to be reverent I'm not a reverence you understand I'm not a reverend but understand I must Reverend you I must respect you you must respect me because what else brother brute but brother Brooks has an office and you and I must understand that office is what God ordained I didn't I was telling the brother of the day as in any close and I said do you understand what I had to go through every day if I could quit being a pastor if I could have run I would but don't you understand I've tried it before and I've been spanked and one thing for sure you don't want God to spank you there's no fun I've been chasing many times just thinking that way let's let's pray father we so thank you for your grace and your mercy I thank you for being so good to us Lord you know it's my desire to be what you want to want me to be help me dear Jesus yes help us Lord we realize to squeeze the press and father as a man I know there's no way I could make it of myself but I need you I need your grace I need your mercy Lord I just want my love for the people to forever be on fire those who love me those who hate me those who despitefully use me lord I need that I want the kind of love for all that you would have helped me father to the Dinan I myself that your will will live in me you're perfect in the vine we Lord bless each and every heart give us understanding strengthen us Lord because we need your Lord in this day and your lovely name we thank you for the word I didn't say enough Lord there's so much could be said the father you know my heart in Jesus Christ's name we pray so Jesus set me free
