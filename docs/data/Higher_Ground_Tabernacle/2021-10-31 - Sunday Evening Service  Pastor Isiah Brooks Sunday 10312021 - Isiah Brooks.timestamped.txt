[49:36] we ask us to turn with us amen to
[49:39] we're going to finish
[49:41] ministering on a few things here um
[49:44] dealing with the mystery of god we
[49:47] in seed form we we've seen where
[49:50] god has done some great things for us
[49:53] and i just love the
[49:55] how simple god is the simplicity i said
[49:59] genesis i keep saying it but first john
[50:01] please
[50:02] first john forgive me
[50:06] every time i think about genesis i think
[50:08] about first john
[50:09] it's gonna be uh saint john 1 i'm sorry
[50:14] saint john 1.
[50:16] [Music]
[50:23] we know these scriptures
[50:27] i'd like to entitle this message
[50:30] christ the
[50:32] germ of life
[50:34] dealing with the seven-fold
[50:36] manifestation
[50:37] of god
[50:39] hidden in seed in his seed
[50:43] if we
[50:45] just read here in the beginning was the
[50:47] word
[50:49] and the word was with god and the word
[50:52] was
[50:52] god
[50:54] the same
[50:57] was in
[50:58] the beginning with god
[51:00] all things were made by him
[51:04] and without him without him
[51:06] was not anything made that was made
[51:09] in him was life as the key word
[51:12] and the life was the light
[51:15] of men
[51:17] hallelujah
[51:20] galatians 3 16.
[51:28] everybody love the lord
[51:30] you know we appreciate god
[51:33] i know that uh we're in
[51:36] a time where people
[51:39] as the scriptures say it's high time to
[51:40] wake up out of sleep
[51:43] i think we've slumbered long enough
[51:46] and uh when we think about how
[51:50] satan is such a
[51:52] he knows how to distract us he's really
[51:54] good at it
[51:55] and uh
[51:57] if we're not careful
[51:59] he'll do the thing for us we're not
[52:01] going to be long but we'll make it short
[52:03] seeing that we have another part of the
[52:04] service to
[52:06] go into
[52:07] let's read now galatians 3
[52:11] 16 please
[52:16] now to abraham and his seed
[52:19] were the promise made
[52:21] he said not unto seeds
[52:24] as a many
[52:26] but as of one
[52:28] and to that sea which is
[52:30] christ
[52:31] let us pray heavenly father we thank you
[52:33] for your grace and your mercy
[52:36] we thank you for being so good to us
[52:38] we thank you for being our all in all
[52:40] and
[52:41] father we just love you we just love you
[52:43] and
[52:44] we thank you for all that you do for us
[52:46] in spite of all our shortcomings we
[52:49] surely appreciate your lord and we never
[52:51] want to um
[52:54] disrespect you in any way
[52:56] father help us lord keep our hearts and
[52:59] minds on you lord in jesus christ's name
[53:01] we pray amen amen you may be seated glad
[53:05] to
[53:06] uh have our brother troy with us
[53:09] amen his family we appreciate him
[53:13] we we thank god for
[53:15] uh uh all that has been done and what's
[53:18] done
[53:19] um
[53:20] when i think about
[53:21] and i've just been thinking uh really a
[53:24] lot about
[53:25] the mercies and the grace of god
[53:28] and how awesome god is
[53:32] i think sometimes when we think about
[53:34] life
[53:35] we fail to see that everything that has
[53:38] life
[53:39] is given by god there's only one life
[53:44] and
[53:45] the true life of god is
[53:48] what i have
[53:50] everything that we see live and live
[53:53] even when jesus said that he was able to
[53:55] make a rock cry out
[53:57] that was god speaking
[53:59] because god can enter into a rock
[54:02] and make it live
[54:05] he's the one who governs all the laws
[54:08] and especially the laws of life
[54:11] life in itself as we see it because of
[54:13] the fall
[54:14] if we realize uh if we we understand the
[54:17] death burial and resurrection of jesus
[54:19] christ
[54:20] we'll be able to see
[54:23] that everything in our
[54:25] life
[54:26] as we see it
[54:28] magnifies it
[54:29] uh from the creation or
[54:32] and from the rising of the sun to the
[54:34] setting of the sun
[54:36] you know uh we we see it as when we we
[54:39] think about how the wind blows nobody
[54:41] can see it we don't know where it comes
[54:43] from and we don't know where it goes
[54:45] i mean
[54:46] the whole uh creation
[54:48] um it's it's all about life
[54:51] this is what make god so great like even
[54:54] the prophet god said that the scientists
[54:56] they can do a lot of things and they can
[55:00] but they can't make a piece of grass
[55:02] grow they can't
[55:03] see where the life is it's in a secret
[55:06] place it's in a place that only god is
[55:10] visible to god where it is
[55:12] uh you know as i was speaking this
[55:14] morning
[55:15] you know all seeds though they may look
[55:18] alike
[55:20] may not be alike
[55:22] because there are seeds that are planted
[55:24] into the ground
[55:26] at harvest but all seeds don't come up
[55:30] because all of those seeds don't have a
[55:32] germ of life in it
[55:34] but for those who have the germ of life
[55:37] once you plant it
[55:39] and it dies and it rots
[55:41] something happens
[55:44] as i said
[55:45] even this morning you can't you can
[55:47] count there's seas in the apple but you
[55:50] can't count the apples in the seed
[55:53] that's the miracle and that's what's so
[55:55] amazing about a seed and i've never seen
[55:58] anybody take seeds and say oh look
[56:01] they're so beauties are beautiful seeds
[56:04] because if you've seen one seed you've
[56:06] seen them all
[56:07] and there's nothing that is so glorious
[56:10] about a seed most seeds are just common
[56:12] and sometimes they're just ugly
[56:15] but it's what's that what's in the seed
[56:19] that brings the beauty
[56:21] but it has to die it has to rot
[56:24] in order for that life to come out and
[56:27] for in order for you to see
[56:29] what
[56:30] god has
[56:32] amen in that seed
[56:34] you think about it how some seeds once
[56:36] they die they come up and they bring
[56:38] some of the most before before the
[56:40] before the fruit of the seed comes forth
[56:43] they used to have these beautiful
[56:46] blossoms of some sort to to to hail the
[56:49] coming of the of the fruits
[56:51] and and when you see those things it's
[56:53] like oh my you know especially a pear
[56:55] tree sometimes those pear those pear
[56:58] trees really bring some beautiful
[56:59] blossoms out before you see the little
[57:03] pears coming on them and
[57:05] and that's just the beginning
[57:07] and it does it magnifies god in such a
[57:09] way because those little pears stars out
[57:12] like that and then they get sometimes
[57:14] just and you say how did that tree do
[57:18] that
[57:19] it wasn't the tree
[57:21] it was the life in the tree
[57:24] it was the law that god put in the tree
[57:27] that every seed should bring forth of
[57:30] its kind
[57:32] and when we think about that it's just
[57:34] amazing because i always you heard when
[57:36] i talked when we spoke the last time how
[57:39] god hid himself in a seed
[57:43] he literally told us
[57:45] the whole bible or the the whole plan of
[57:48] redemption
[57:50] by planting a seed
[57:52] and he showed us there it i think he's
[57:54] in matthew how when a plant a sower went
[57:56] out to sow seed
[57:58] and and he sold the seed and the seed
[58:00] fell into the ground and and and and it
[58:03] brought forth but the sword didn't do
[58:05] anything that the soul was god it was a
[58:07] type of god and god sold his seed out
[58:10] there and
[58:12] the seed laid there
[58:17] day
[58:18] and night
[58:20] night
[58:21] and day
[58:22] that seed
[58:24] something made something happen that
[58:26] seed began to rot
[58:28] it died and it rot and all of a sudden
[58:32] out of the grave
[58:34] comes life
[58:36] and it's amazing because that's exactly
[58:39] what jesus said
[58:41] except for seed if a corn or wheat
[58:43] abideth alone
[58:45] it does nothing
[58:47] but think about it when he died did you
[58:50] understand that
[58:51] a lot of they didn't understand it
[58:55] when the true seed of god died
[58:58] this is what really excites me i'm
[58:59] getting excited because you got to
[59:01] realize when you can plant one seed
[59:05] but out of that one seed
[59:08] causes a multitude of seeds
[59:11] that would be also
[59:13] able at one point in time to die
[59:16] to rot and bring more
[59:20] it becomes innumerable
[59:22] it becomes it comes to a place where it
[59:25] can't be uh numbered
[59:27] and the seed i'm talking about tonight
[59:29] is the same seed that john saw
[59:33] but what john saw was the harvest of
[59:35] that seed and he said there was a number
[59:38] that no man can number
[59:40] came out of one seed
[59:43] and that seed was christ
[59:46] you see the devil
[59:48] thought he was going to stop god
[59:50] and every time god began to do something
[59:56] satan would always come to try to stop
[59:58] it
[1:00:00] even in the beginning when god brought
[1:00:02] forth and i i told y'all when when when
[1:00:05] satan when lucifer took jesus christ
[1:00:07] upon the mountain
[1:00:09] and and showed him the beautiful
[1:00:11] countries
[1:00:12] he wasn't talking oh look at new york
[1:00:15] isn't it wonderful no new york is a dump
[1:00:19] look at washington dc but what he was
[1:00:22] doing he was showing
[1:00:25] the achievements
[1:00:28] that he had achieved
[1:00:30] through man
[1:00:32] by ruling over them
[1:00:35] you understand me
[1:00:37] because when the devil
[1:00:39] said in isaiah he will exalt his throne
[1:00:42] above the stars
[1:00:44] he will become as god
[1:00:46] you see what i'm saying he'll become
[1:00:48] like god see he did not enjoy his
[1:00:51] position and the only position that was
[1:00:54] greater than his position was god
[1:00:57] he wanted to go beyond that
[1:00:59] but you see he he's not a creator he's a
[1:01:02] perverter
[1:01:04] and that was the only way he could get
[1:01:06] into
[1:01:08] the the kingdom of god existed
[1:01:11] when you look you say oh
[1:01:13] eden was so beautiful
[1:01:16] beautiful trees beautiful flowers
[1:01:18] beautiful animals beautiful everything
[1:01:19] was beautiful do you really think that's
[1:01:21] what the devil was after
[1:01:24] do you really think that's what he was
[1:01:26] saying amen i am going to exalt my
[1:01:28] throne
[1:01:30] the devil knew
[1:01:32] where the throne of room of god was
[1:01:36] and he understood if i could get into
[1:01:39] that uh into the kingdom of god it's got
[1:01:42] to come
[1:01:44] by science
[1:01:45] you understand me
[1:01:47] and what did he do he perverted see
[1:01:49] that's the that's the thing you got to
[1:01:51] be really careful in this day
[1:01:53] uh about the word of god
[1:01:55] because
[1:01:56] what satan did he twisted the word
[1:02:00] and he used science
[1:02:03] the mind
[1:02:05] deceive
[1:02:07] and he believed
[1:02:10] the devil and adam and eve they fell
[1:02:12] that's what the devil wanted
[1:02:16] it wasn't the garden of eden that he
[1:02:18] wanted that wasn't the kingdom of god
[1:02:22] the kingdom of god was adam and eve
[1:02:26] hallelujah
[1:02:27] it is the temple of god
[1:02:29] the place where god had ordained to
[1:02:32] worship
[1:02:33] hallelujah
[1:02:35] he understood the worshiping up in
[1:02:37] heaven lucifer knew that
[1:02:39] but when god made a man
[1:02:42] god stepped into that man
[1:02:46] hallelujah and his name was adam
[1:02:50] that was the kingdom of god see this is
[1:02:53] why adam
[1:02:55] was able to name the animals
[1:02:58] because god had already named the
[1:03:00] animals
[1:03:02] and adam he said i want to see whether
[1:03:04] adam can condemn these animals but what
[1:03:07] it was it was already god had named the
[1:03:11] animals read your scriptures
[1:03:13] and god and adam comes along and name he
[1:03:16] didn't rename them
[1:03:18] he named them what adam named what god
[1:03:21] named them because god in adam was one
[1:03:24] the mind of god was in adam
[1:03:27] that was the kingdom of god and when he
[1:03:30] overthrew
[1:03:32] adam he believed the devil did he
[1:03:35] believed that he could overthrow god
[1:03:37] that's why he fights so much now because
[1:03:40] he still believes that he can overthrow
[1:03:42] god because he overthrew adam but he did
[1:03:46] not understand adam was not deceived
[1:03:50] the woman was deceived hallelujah amen
[1:03:54] and adam willfully
[1:03:56] moved out from the uh from that the veil
[1:03:59] of god
[1:04:01] only to
[1:04:02] save
[1:04:04] his wife
[1:04:07] because
[1:04:08] the kingdom
[1:04:10] had been divided and a house divided
[1:04:14] cannot stand
[1:04:16] and he needed adam needed his wife
[1:04:20] like god needs you
[1:04:23] y'all understand me
[1:04:24] but they were coming a time when god was
[1:04:27] going to unite it again
[1:04:30] man and woman will become one
[1:04:33] hallelujah which was signifying that one
[1:04:36] day god and his bride will become one
[1:04:40] the second adam and his bride will
[1:04:42] become one having the same mind
[1:04:46] the same god
[1:04:49] being the temple of god
[1:04:51] [Laughter]
[1:04:53] so what are you saying brother brooks
[1:04:55] see this whole thing was no mistake
[1:04:57] god knew what it was going to be
[1:05:00] like
[1:05:01] because adam knew that eve was going to
[1:05:03] fall
[1:05:04] even when he saw her
[1:05:07] because he says
[1:05:09] you're going to leave your mother and
[1:05:10] father
[1:05:12] and cleave to your husband
[1:05:14] remember
[1:05:16] there wasn't supposed to be
[1:05:19] a mother and father
[1:05:23] they were supposed to be children the
[1:05:26] only mother and father that would have
[1:05:27] been was adam
[1:05:29] and eve
[1:05:31] but all of the offspring that would come
[1:05:33] after adam would be children
[1:05:36] hallelujah is that right you say break
[1:05:39] that down well
[1:05:41] when you get to heaven
[1:05:43] there will be no more husbands and wives
[1:05:46] there will be no more brother there will
[1:05:48] be no more uh husbands and wives
[1:05:51] there'll be no grandparents
[1:05:54] everybody
[1:05:55] will be brothers and sisters
[1:05:58] as it was from the beginning
[1:06:00] hallelujah is that right
[1:06:03] all glory to god now you say well
[1:06:05] brother brooks
[1:06:06] what are you saying what are you saying
[1:06:09] i'm trying to tell you every seed shall
[1:06:11] bring forth of its kind
[1:06:14] right and i told you i wasn't going to
[1:06:15] be long so i better get to where i'm
[1:06:16] going
[1:06:17] we must understand that every seed every
[1:06:20] time the devil god would bring forth a
[1:06:23] seed
[1:06:24] the devil always tried to kill it or
[1:06:26] destroy it so when cain was destroyed he
[1:06:30] thought he had killed uh uh abel oscar
[1:06:33] when abel was destroyed or killed cain
[1:06:36] thought he had destroyed the lineage of
[1:06:38] god
[1:06:38] but all that was still god
[1:06:41] god in his mind was going to prove amen
[1:06:44] that
[1:06:45] he can cannot be destroyed see life
[1:06:48] can't be destroyed
[1:06:50] let me say it again life cannot be
[1:06:52] destroyed
[1:06:55] there's nothing about god that can ever
[1:06:57] be destroyed
[1:07:00] hallelujah even when everything is
[1:07:04] burned all over again
[1:07:06] you still go back to whatever you was
[1:07:09] with adam
[1:07:10] whatever your natural body will always
[1:07:12] go back to whatever it was before the
[1:07:14] beginning
[1:07:16] because nothing really can be destroyed
[1:07:19] you all got quiet on me
[1:07:20] but that's the truth brother madam used
[1:07:22] the word annihilated
[1:07:25] there's nothing that can truly ever be
[1:07:26] annihilated
[1:07:28] now so i go all go back to this
[1:07:31] god in his mind saw all of you
[1:07:34] right
[1:07:35] and he never said where were the fathers
[1:07:38] and the mothers
[1:07:42] where were they job
[1:07:45] no he said where were the sons of god
[1:07:49] what were they doing
[1:07:51] you understand me the sons of god began
[1:07:54] to rejoice
[1:07:58] when they saw calvary
[1:07:59] when they saw the victory
[1:08:02] that
[1:08:03] god was going to restore them back to
[1:08:05] their proper place
[1:08:07] is that right
[1:08:09] so you say oh what do you mean even
[1:08:13] when uh they said to jesus
[1:08:16] your mother and your brother
[1:08:20] they seek you
[1:08:22] jesus said who is my mother and my
[1:08:24] brother
[1:08:25] those that do my father's will
[1:08:28] now i'm coming to this
[1:08:30] when god sowed the seed you remember now
[1:08:33] there are two seeds
[1:08:35] there was a there's a good seed
[1:08:37] and there was an evil seed
[1:08:40] and
[1:08:41] here brother branham said the germ
[1:08:43] is a life
[1:08:45] first the germ is a tiny cell with life
[1:08:49] in it
[1:08:50] and the life
[1:08:52] can come from two sources
[1:08:55] either god
[1:08:57] or the devil
[1:09:00] and you came from the germ
[1:09:04] of god
[1:09:06] the germ of life by god
[1:09:09] so what makes us different
[1:09:11] is what we were born with
[1:09:14] y'all understand what i'm saying
[1:09:17] what you were born with
[1:09:20] is what makes you different
[1:09:23] you were born with the seed of god said
[1:09:26] like this the germ of god or the let's
[1:09:30] say like this the gene of god
[1:09:33] that gene of god was put in you before
[1:09:36] the foundation of the world
[1:09:39] that's why when satan wanted to kill
[1:09:42] even your ancestors they could not kill
[1:09:44] your ancestor because you were there
[1:09:48] you understand me like levi yeah in the
[1:09:51] loins of of abraham he could not be
[1:09:54] destroyed
[1:09:56] and so you and i must understand that if
[1:09:58] god protected us for thousands of years
[1:10:03] to bring us into this day to do what
[1:10:06] manifests the fruit of the seed that was
[1:10:10] planted
[1:10:11] hallelujah so what are you saying i'm
[1:10:14] saying even when when when peter first
[1:10:16] peter comes along and says you know now
[1:10:19] we are partakers of divine nature he saw
[1:10:22] that listen it's not going to be a
[1:10:24] narrow way of entrance but there'll be a
[1:10:26] grand injury there'll be an abundance of
[1:10:29] of understanding abundance of revelation
[1:10:32] that you're going to receive to go into
[1:10:34] this place you won't scarcely go into it
[1:10:38] so
[1:10:39] when i thought about that
[1:10:42] i came can't god just showed me
[1:10:45] that here it is
[1:10:47] jesus says i am the door
[1:10:50] i am the door to the sheep folk
[1:10:53] right and so we've been taught that when
[1:10:55] a shepherd gather his sheets for the end
[1:10:58] uh before the evening he always lay in
[1:11:01] front of the door right
[1:11:03] he's there to protect
[1:11:05] that door
[1:11:07] so there's always a protection even even
[1:11:10] when when adam and eve sinned there were
[1:11:12] there were cherubims there amen
[1:11:13] protecting the door
[1:11:16] we call it the tree of life but that was
[1:11:18] the door
[1:11:20] and then we find out that even when mo
[1:11:23] noah built the ark
[1:11:25] brother branham and i you got to realize
[1:11:27] what he's saying he said noah stood in
[1:11:30] the door and he and he preached
[1:11:33] it's going to rain
[1:11:34] so he showed in order to get into the
[1:11:37] door you had to come by way of door
[1:11:44] but satan has impostors
[1:11:46] because when jesus came he told those
[1:11:49] pharisees and sadducees you stand in the
[1:11:52] door
[1:11:53] in other words you know the way
[1:11:57] to enter into eternal life say but you
[1:12:00] won't go in
[1:12:02] neither will you let your subjects go in
[1:12:05] he said you generation of vipers
[1:12:08] you see he could always take that back
[1:12:11] to uh uh uh uh cain
[1:12:15] because cain knew the way
[1:12:18] god told him the way
[1:12:21] hallelujah but cain refused to go that
[1:12:25] way why he refused he took the
[1:12:28] revelation of his mama
[1:12:31] the church
[1:12:32] he took his revelation of of of of the
[1:12:35] serpent and he moved with that and he he
[1:12:39] made it right but this is what happened
[1:12:42] so you'll know the nature of the seed
[1:12:44] the nature of the seed of the serpent is
[1:12:47] always trying to be something that he's
[1:12:49] not
[1:12:52] wanting
[1:12:53] self-glorification
[1:12:55] wanting to be
[1:12:56] greater
[1:12:58] want recognition
[1:13:00] y'all hear me
[1:13:01] that's that's right in the message
[1:13:04] people want to be recognized to be
[1:13:06] something that they're not
[1:13:08] we just don't you're not satisfied with
[1:13:10] what god has made you
[1:13:12] hallelujah it's okay to be nothing
[1:13:16] because even when you're nothing in god
[1:13:18] you're something
[1:13:20] you don't have to be great you don't
[1:13:22] have to be recognized by no man it's the
[1:13:25] man upstairs we want recognition from
[1:13:29] oh somebody help me here even in the
[1:13:31] message people want a name
[1:13:33] you know i ran from that that's why i'm
[1:13:35] here today
[1:13:37] it's not because i want a name i didn't
[1:13:38] come here amen to be a name i came here
[1:13:42] hiding running from that thing because
[1:13:44] there's only one name that needs to be
[1:13:46] glorified and that's the name of jesus
[1:13:48] christ
[1:13:50] but satan i will exalt i will exalt oh
[1:13:53] we got to make it better make it better
[1:13:55] make it better and that's exactly what
[1:13:57] david did
[1:13:58] david thought if i just put the ark on a
[1:14:00] new cart
[1:14:02] i've made it better
[1:14:04] no sir
[1:14:05] you can't improve god
[1:14:07] hallelujah like i said and we don't
[1:14:09] understand
[1:14:11] what satan has done in this day with
[1:14:14] every influence
[1:14:16] throughout all the ages through the old
[1:14:19] testament from the all all way to the
[1:14:21] new you know what he's done he's pulled
[1:14:24] all of his resources together to deceive
[1:14:28] the sons of god
[1:14:30] all of his resources and every one of
[1:14:33] his resources hinges on lust of the
[1:14:36] flesh lust of the eye and the pride of
[1:14:38] life
[1:14:39] those are the three things that satan
[1:14:42] operates to turn your thoughts away from
[1:14:46] god
[1:14:47] the word
[1:14:48] and make you believe his lie
[1:14:51] is that right he'll make a woman believe
[1:14:54] that she's not beautiful
[1:14:56] but god made every woman beautiful
[1:15:00] but he'll tell her you need to make it
[1:15:01] better
[1:15:02] you understand me
[1:15:04] hey always we're never satisfied
[1:15:07] i mean even if you lose weight you can
[1:15:09] lose weight and look
[1:15:11] just like you want to look
[1:15:14] and somebody will say man you're just
[1:15:15] getting too thin
[1:15:18] yeah that's what they say oh you don't
[1:15:19] look right but to you you look right but
[1:15:22] because somebody said you don't look
[1:15:24] right you gain a little bit of weight it
[1:15:26] don't come back a little bit it comes
[1:15:27] back a lot now you're back where you
[1:15:29] started from
[1:15:31] right yet the flesh is never satisfied
[1:15:34] we know that because we have all kinds
[1:15:37] of changes of clothes we get tired of
[1:15:40] these and they stay in the closet we get
[1:15:42] new ones we get tired of those new ones
[1:15:44] then they go back in the other part of
[1:15:45] the closet
[1:15:47] never satisfied because we're always
[1:15:50] trying to improve this outward man and
[1:15:53] by
[1:15:54] while you're doing all of this trying
[1:15:55] improvement the boy is getting old
[1:16:03] it's like trying to give a old house a
[1:16:05] faith lift
[1:16:07] painting it
[1:16:09] right but i'm what i'm trying to say
[1:16:11] these are the tactics what did he do
[1:16:14] he took the he took science
[1:16:17] and he engineered it so well like the
[1:16:20] proper guy said it once was the
[1:16:22] television
[1:16:23] then it moves from the computer
[1:16:25] then it's to the iphone
[1:16:27] and the ipad
[1:16:29] and i think randy randy verton preached
[1:16:31] on the iphone and the ipad and showed
[1:16:33] how you know everything is
[1:16:36] [Laughter]
[1:16:38] exalting yourself right now
[1:16:41] and the thing about it is like now they
[1:16:44] got it you can catch pictures you can
[1:16:45] make pictures and you can what you call
[1:16:48] it crop it or something they can make it
[1:16:49] look so good you know that ain't you
[1:16:53] but you can visit
[1:16:55] what you would like to look like
[1:16:58] right and you can make it look just like
[1:17:00] that you said who is that
[1:17:02] right but it's just what we imagine what
[1:17:05] we dream to be and all along we don't
[1:17:08] see the vanity behind it and we don't
[1:17:10] even see how satan is sneaking in
[1:17:15] like an old snake
[1:17:17] subtly
[1:17:18] suddenly and and he's moving and
[1:17:21] changing your thoughts about yourself
[1:17:23] and at the end of the day
[1:17:25] you end up becoming depressed
[1:17:28] and cast down because you know you'll
[1:17:30] never look like that
[1:17:33] right you think michael jackson was ever
[1:17:35] happy
[1:17:37] but the devil kept telling him he could
[1:17:39] improve himself
[1:17:42] and at the time at the end of the day he
[1:17:44] really looked hideous
[1:17:47] y'all know what i'm saying but something
[1:17:49] was inspired all of that money and he
[1:17:51] never was happy right
[1:17:54] hallelujah y'all see what i'm saying and
[1:17:56] then with all of that he considered
[1:17:59] himself a god and he missed god
[1:18:04] and that's what happens
[1:18:06] when you're not satisfied satan makes
[1:18:09] you worship yourself
[1:18:12] you become the god
[1:18:13] and by doing so you miss god and guess
[1:18:16] what you're doing the same thing that
[1:18:19] lucifer did in the beginning
[1:18:23] you began to worship yourself and try to
[1:18:26] put yourself above god
[1:18:29] you understand what i'm saying he's so
[1:18:31] tricky
[1:18:32] with his thoughts and his his ideas of
[1:18:35] things and and we we the church we we
[1:18:38] allow it to happen see that's what
[1:18:40] happened to the pentecostal church they
[1:18:42] allowed the world to come in and what
[1:18:44] was the world it was satan's influence
[1:18:47] and what was that influence taking them
[1:18:48] to the mark of the beast
[1:18:51] you understand me let me show so you can
[1:18:54] understand what i know you understand
[1:18:55] what i'm saying but the influence of
[1:18:57] satan what it did even in the anteluvian
[1:19:00] day
[1:19:01] it made man become
[1:19:04] beastly
[1:19:09] and because of the mixture
[1:19:11] there was always that place in that man
[1:19:14] to become a serpent
[1:19:16] or to become a son
[1:19:19] and because of the influence look what
[1:19:21] happens we know the truth of the matter
[1:19:24] is he caused them to multiply
[1:19:27] but it was caused multiplying according
[1:19:30] to their will not god's will
[1:19:34] and then therefore they the whole earth
[1:19:37] was polluted and by the serpents and and
[1:19:40] god destroyed it
[1:19:42] and as it was in the days of noah when
[1:19:45] education and all these things are
[1:19:47] flourishing just like it was in that day
[1:19:51] what's happening the the seed of the
[1:19:53] serpent is multiplying and the seed of
[1:19:56] god is diminishing
[1:20:00] because by the time it almost got to the
[1:20:03] destruction of the world the seed of
[1:20:06] enoch
[1:20:08] was one
[1:20:11] the understanding
[1:20:12] those who would make a rapture had so
[1:20:15] diminished
[1:20:18] god use one man
[1:20:20] to symbolize
[1:20:22] the bride of jesus christ
[1:20:24] you understand me
[1:20:27] so you're saying brother what what was
[1:20:28] going on i'm telling you now
[1:20:32] closing
[1:20:34] because it's much
[1:20:36] whenever satan influences you
[1:20:40] he has something to gain
[1:20:42] from you
[1:20:44] always and you and i must understand
[1:20:48] that this is a time when we must
[1:20:50] understand that god's trying to reflect
[1:20:53] himself through you the germ of life
[1:20:56] that was planted we were you know it
[1:20:58] wasn't all about g let me
[1:21:00] say it in the right way when jesus died
[1:21:03] when he rose again
[1:21:05] his life journey wasn't complete
[1:21:09] in the way i'm going to say this
[1:21:11] because he came to multiply his kind
[1:21:16] to give birth to his kind
[1:21:18] and the only way he could give birth to
[1:21:20] his kind was by himself
[1:21:23] because man was to give birth
[1:21:28] is that right
[1:21:29] we're born by christ
[1:21:32] and christ is a man
[1:21:37] god told adam to be fruitful and
[1:21:39] multiply before eve ever came on the
[1:21:41] scene
[1:21:43] the original order is that right
[1:21:46] who speaks the word
[1:21:48] where does the seed of life come from
[1:21:51] where does the germ of life come from it
[1:21:54] comes from the man
[1:21:56] it was god
[1:21:59] hallelujah
[1:22:00] and we are born of who
[1:22:02] god
[1:22:04] so we understand by god's grace
[1:22:07] always done
[1:22:09] amen for reproduction
[1:22:12] but the original was not supposed to be
[1:22:16] that's why when you get to heaven there
[1:22:18] will not be any babies
[1:22:20] there won't be any old folks
[1:22:23] everybody will be in their perfect
[1:22:24] statue
[1:22:26] everybody will be brothers and sisters
[1:22:29] hallelujah and guess what people there
[1:22:32] will not be another another lust of the
[1:22:34] eye loss of the flesh or pride of life
[1:22:38] all of that will be gone
[1:22:40] hallelujah but the beauty of who you are
[1:22:44] to go back to the statue of a perfect
[1:22:46] man
[1:22:47] like i was telling the brother of the
[1:22:48] day
[1:22:49] i used to say oh
[1:22:50] god hi there's two two messages that
[1:22:53] used to stump me every time
[1:22:55] and that was the statue of a perfect man
[1:22:58] and thinking man's filter
[1:23:02] trying to get through the filter flow
[1:23:03] trying to get through the filter
[1:23:07] and when you saw a faulty like i am you
[1:23:09] know you you you're doing your best
[1:23:11] you're doing your best and you don't
[1:23:13] understand
[1:23:14] you did i didn't understand that what
[1:23:17] makes you go through the filter you
[1:23:18] could never do it
[1:23:21] it law will never bring you to heaven
[1:23:24] it's only the grace of god
[1:23:26] and when i heard the prophet of god say
[1:23:29] on the statue of a perfect man he said
[1:23:32] you cannot add to it
[1:23:35] but it will add to you
[1:23:38] that's the life of the seed
[1:23:40] hallelujah that seed die
[1:23:43] light comes up
[1:23:45] and everything that needs to be added to
[1:23:48] that particular life adds itself
[1:23:51] yields itself as long as it stays in the
[1:23:54] sun and goes through the seasonal
[1:23:56] changes amen everything produces itself
[1:23:59] the next thing you know the tree is
[1:24:01] matured
[1:24:04] and blossoms comes on it
[1:24:06] and after the blossom comes the fruit
[1:24:08] y'all understand what i'm saying it it's
[1:24:11] the life in the seed and all you need
[1:24:14] that's the that's the whole bible
[1:24:16] that germ of life was christ that's why
[1:24:19] he had to die that's why he had to come
[1:24:22] back and baptize you
[1:24:24] quicken you which was alive to quicken
[1:24:27] the seed that was already there is that
[1:24:30] right
[1:24:31] probably god said you either got one
[1:24:32] thing in you or the other you either got
[1:24:35] the dove or a snake
[1:24:37] hallelujah you got faith or unbelief
[1:24:39] either way you go with it right but
[1:24:42] because of what the sower did
[1:24:45] you say well brother books that just
[1:24:46] don't sound fair let me say it like this
[1:24:49] god don't make foolish virgins
[1:24:53] foolish virgins make themselves
[1:24:57] because of their choices in life
[1:25:00] you understand me
[1:25:02] they chose it you see but god because of
[1:25:05] omniscient he saw that
[1:25:08] he saw what their choices would be and
[1:25:10] then he foreordained them to be that
[1:25:14] to fulfill his purpose
[1:25:17] hallelujah
[1:25:20] i know
[1:25:21] yes god will manipulate things sometimes
[1:25:24] because the bible says that all things
[1:25:26] work together for the good of them that
[1:25:28] love god
[1:25:29] when god sees you off track
[1:25:33] from his purpose
[1:25:34] he'll intervene
[1:25:37] he said brother bruce what are you
[1:25:38] saying
[1:25:39] god gave
[1:25:42] uh uh
[1:25:44] he gave uh samson an order
[1:25:50] first of all samson
[1:25:52] you are
[1:25:54] a nazarite
[1:25:56] don't you ever cut your hair
[1:25:59] this is your sign that you have
[1:26:03] become bind
[1:26:04] now watch this in all of the wicked
[1:26:07] things samson did
[1:26:10] as long as he didn't cut his hair
[1:26:15] as long as he didn't shave the thunders
[1:26:17] off
[1:26:18] y'all understand me
[1:26:20] he was still a man but he had a covenant
[1:26:23] that was given to him
[1:26:25] god was still with him
[1:26:28] but the moment he allowed the enemy to
[1:26:31] cut his head
[1:26:33] he told the secret
[1:26:37] he told the secret
[1:26:39] what was the secret he should never cut
[1:26:41] his hand
[1:26:43] obedience is better than sacrifice
[1:26:47] that's what he said i must obey the word
[1:26:50] whatever god told me to do i must do
[1:26:52] that otherwise
[1:26:54] i'll become just as weak as everybody
[1:26:56] else
[1:26:57] she is obedience to the word
[1:27:00] and what happens god
[1:27:02] use his mistake
[1:27:04] god used sam's mistake and made him
[1:27:07] greater
[1:27:09] at the end that he was
[1:27:11] in the beginning that's what god will do
[1:27:14] for his true seed amen hallelujah
[1:27:17] because remember there was only one who
[1:27:19] was truly perfect and that was god
[1:27:21] himself
[1:27:22] but the light in you you say oh god i
[1:27:24] want to be perfect well the seed is
[1:27:26] perfect that's what makes you perfect
[1:27:29] oh god
[1:27:31] that's why the bible says if that seed
[1:27:33] remaineth in you you cannot sin there is
[1:27:37] no way that god can disbelieve his own
[1:27:40] word
[1:27:41] hallelujah you love the lord
[1:27:43] uh
[1:27:44] uh my god my god
[1:27:48] i'm gonna read this one scripture then
[1:27:49] we'll go into our communion because i
[1:27:51] know we're running late and all of these
[1:27:53] things but
[1:27:55] are you seeing what i'm saying
[1:27:57] is it being clear because
[1:27:59] it takes away your struggle
[1:28:02] and brings you to a place of yielding
[1:28:05] it is not hard to yield
[1:28:08] it's not hard to humble yourself
[1:28:10] you just do it
[1:28:12] right humbling yourself is better than
[1:28:15] trying to climb a ladder
[1:28:18] right going down is much easier than
[1:28:20] getting up
[1:28:22] and once you humble yourself god will
[1:28:25] then lift you up into the place that you
[1:28:27] desire to be
[1:28:29] you say well how possible that is let me
[1:28:31] tell you what god did he took an
[1:28:33] ill-famed woman and everybody knew she
[1:28:36] was a prostitute
[1:28:37] and she comes in there in simon's house
[1:28:40] and began to weep and cry and wash his
[1:28:42] feet
[1:28:43] she was the lowest of all loaves
[1:28:45] hallelujah but when she washed his feet
[1:28:48] and cried and
[1:28:50] however she communicated to him he
[1:28:52] caught her thoughts
[1:28:54] and said woman your sins are forgiven
[1:28:58] he took an ill-famed woman and put her
[1:29:01] placed her in the hall of fame
[1:29:04] every christian in the world knows about
[1:29:06] mary
[1:29:08] hallelujah
[1:29:12] don't you understand what i'm trying to
[1:29:13] say
[1:29:14] that's all she did was humble herself
[1:29:18] before the word and the word lifted her
[1:29:20] up
[1:29:21] like he told abraham from the dust to
[1:29:24] the stars
[1:29:25] hallelujah that's what god takes you
[1:29:28] from the sand from the dirt of the earth
[1:29:30] and then make you a star of god
[1:29:32] that's what he does
[1:29:34] that's what calvary is all about is
[1:29:36] changing you and rearranging you
[1:29:39] [Laughter]
[1:29:41] hallelujah yes sir
[1:29:43] taking you and bringing you from being
[1:29:45] an old sloppy dog amen to to a great
[1:29:49] prince of god
[1:29:52] glory to god
[1:29:53] my last scripture for our gospel came
[1:29:56] not
[1:29:57] unto you in word only and this is where
[1:30:00] we're going
[1:30:01] we have allowed satan to misconstrue the
[1:30:05] word and change it so much that we feel
[1:30:08] like we're bride and we're already there
[1:30:11] and and we're mature let me tell you
[1:30:12] what a mature bride is a matured bride
[1:30:16] is the bride that has the mind of
[1:30:18] god in her right she knows what to do
[1:30:22] that's the problem a lot of people don't
[1:30:24] know what to do with the word oh we
[1:30:26] don't shout no more we don't dance no
[1:30:28] more we don't have no more gifts because
[1:30:29] we're more we're greater that's a lie
[1:30:33] everything that god put in the tree
[1:30:36] is supposed to be displayed right
[1:30:39] hallelujah it is alive from the devil oh
[1:30:42] we're beyond that well when you're
[1:30:44] beyond that amen there's no more fruit
[1:30:47] on the tree
[1:30:48] everything than fall out has fallen off
[1:30:50] the leaves have fallen off now you're in
[1:30:51] the winter and the fall and that's why
[1:30:52] you
[1:30:54] win like you do
[1:30:57] but this is a time of worship this is a
[1:31:00] time of praise this is a time when god
[1:31:03] has shown you that you were with him
[1:31:06] before the foundation of the world stop
[1:31:08] your worrying stop your fretting ask
[1:31:10] whatsoever your will and i'll give it to
[1:31:12] you see you got to know who you are
[1:31:15] you're a son of the king amen is that
[1:31:18] right you come before the ages of heaven
[1:31:21] god will hear your prayer and when you
[1:31:23] pray pray in faith
[1:31:25] when you pray in faith it is yours
[1:31:29] right
[1:31:31] i wanna you know what i'm trying to say
[1:31:32] i'm tired of seeing this you know this
[1:31:34] this
[1:31:35] so-called bride amen with no movement no
[1:31:39] nothing you're coming to the church and
[1:31:41] you feel like you're preaching to the
[1:31:42] chairs you know there's hardly nothing
[1:31:44] going on oh my god i tell you what i
[1:31:47] take this message take it to a
[1:31:49] pentecostal church and they'll run in
[1:31:50] the walls
[1:31:53] they would
[1:31:54] because they're so hungry and thirsty
[1:31:56] for revelation and the problem is we are
[1:31:58] full of it
[1:32:00] we got so much of it it's become common
[1:32:02] to us what a dangerous place to be
[1:32:05] hallelujah is that right it's the meat
[1:32:08] of the word and what happened you know
[1:32:10] it it's made us sick with vomiting it up
[1:32:13] we can't digest it lord have mercy on
[1:32:16] our soul
[1:32:17] he will
[1:32:20] one thing i love about god he's perfect
[1:32:23] he looked out for us
[1:32:25] and told us don't worry
[1:32:27] you do best under pressure
[1:32:30] and i'm going to bring it to you
[1:32:31] [Laughter]
[1:32:33] don't worry i know how you made up
[1:32:38] i'm going to bring the pressure and that
[1:32:40] pressure is gonna bring everything in
[1:32:42] you out
[1:32:44] i love it i love it i love it samson was
[1:32:48] impressed under pressure he said oh lord
[1:32:50] once more give me old pentecostal
[1:32:52] revival once more let me die with my
[1:32:55] enemy hallelujah yes sir under pressure
[1:32:59] pressure is amazing it's amazing
[1:33:03] hallelujah for our gospel came not unto
[1:33:06] you in
[1:33:07] word only but also in power and in the
[1:33:10] gospel in the and in the holy ghost now
[1:33:12] that's what people don't understand he
[1:33:14] said power and in the holy ghost
[1:33:17] yeah brother was trying to
[1:33:19] well we bought his a little bit because
[1:33:21] he said he's using the term headship and
[1:33:24] i'm using the term mind of god
[1:33:26] now what's the difference
[1:33:29] tell me what's the difference see that's
[1:33:31] what aggravates me if that makes sense i
[1:33:34] hate when people use little terms like
[1:33:36] that to make a difference
[1:33:41] what is the mind of god
[1:33:43] and then the bible says let this mind be
[1:33:46] in you now if that ain't hardship i
[1:33:47] don't know what it is
[1:33:49] hardship is not some
[1:33:51] figure of speech
[1:33:54] but hardship is a state of being amen
[1:33:57] and when you have the mind of god you
[1:34:00] have headship
[1:34:02] because it's christ who leads you it is
[1:34:04] the shepherd that leads you
[1:34:07] but that's what happens that's how
[1:34:09] denominational starts you know you know
[1:34:11] you think you better because you say the
[1:34:13] word headshit well my revelation is the
[1:34:15] same
[1:34:16] even if i use the mind of god
[1:34:21] people they need to stop that nonsense
[1:34:24] oh but also in power and in the holy
[1:34:27] ghost that's like the rapture peace oh
[1:34:28] he's coming in the white house some say
[1:34:30] he's coming i don't care how he comes
[1:34:33] he's coming amen
[1:34:37] that's how they miss jesus they thought
[1:34:40] he was coming on the right white stagger
[1:34:42] of some sort and he comes on a white
[1:34:43] donkey so they couldn't see him amen
[1:34:47] what difference how he came he came
[1:34:52] and my point is god changing me he's
[1:34:54] changing you otherwise you wouldn't be
[1:34:57] here
[1:34:58] today while the world is thinking god is
[1:35:02] lost he's no longer here satan is one
[1:35:04] lucifer however you want to call it i
[1:35:06] saw something on the on on the internet
[1:35:09] yesterday where they trying to glorify
[1:35:11] lucifer and make him something he ain't
[1:35:13] nothing
[1:35:17] ain't nothing wrong with the name of
[1:35:19] loose but go ahead and name your child
[1:35:20] that then
[1:35:22] come here lucifer
[1:35:25] and i say get away from me lucifer i
[1:35:28] don't know what's anointing you right
[1:35:29] now and i don't want a part of it yeah
[1:35:31] this life now people don't call they
[1:35:33] don't mind
[1:35:35] man he ain't nothing but a little demon
[1:35:36] they call their children little demons
[1:35:39] and listen they act just like it
[1:35:42] yeah
[1:35:43] now i'm saying if the world can
[1:35:45] recognize their children to be little
[1:35:47] demons what about us
[1:35:49] what about us
[1:35:50] now even i heard brother brown say i
[1:35:52] don't call them i don't call them uh
[1:35:54] goats i called my little lambs i didn't
[1:35:56] know i thought that was something i came
[1:35:57] up with
[1:35:59] i don't know where i first heard it
[1:36:00] maybe it was that brother keith i don't
[1:36:02] know but i just know my children are
[1:36:04] lambs
[1:36:07] ah god have mercy you love the lord
[1:36:10] i trust i gave you something tonight
[1:36:13] people of god i think
[1:36:14] what hinders us is because we are
[1:36:17] working and operating by the law instead
[1:36:20] of the love of god
[1:36:22] you believe the love of god do you
[1:36:24] believe the bible says there is no
[1:36:25] condemnation of those who walk not after
[1:36:27] the flesh but after the spirit that
[1:36:29] means having the holy spirit and you're
[1:36:31] trying to come to a perfection in the
[1:36:33] holy spirit the word of god said there's
[1:36:34] no condemnation to you
[1:36:37] but yet we allow ourselves to be
[1:36:38] condemned because we make mistakes well
[1:36:41] what happens while you allow yourself to
[1:36:43] be so condemned amen when when you make
[1:36:46] mistakes and and god said you're so
[1:36:48] justified as though you never sinned in
[1:36:49] the first place do you take the grace of
[1:36:51] god
[1:36:53] if you're under the blood how can how
[1:36:55] can god ever see any of your sins
[1:36:58] he doesn't
[1:37:00] and what makes it so sure is because as
[1:37:03] soon as we make a mistake we say god
[1:37:05] forgive us
[1:37:07] that shows you're under the blood
[1:37:11] listen once you give your heart to the
[1:37:14] lord jesus christ there is no way to be
[1:37:16] lost
[1:37:18] god don't save you and then loses loses
[1:37:20] you he doesn't it's not he can't do it
[1:37:24] because once he becomes your savior he
[1:37:26] said you have passed from death unto
[1:37:29] life
[1:37:30] now you determine your decisions in this
[1:37:32] life will determine on how happy you are
[1:37:36] and how free you are
[1:37:38] right
[1:37:40] because i'm going to tell you something
[1:37:41] if you are eagle in a cage
[1:37:44] the cage can never
[1:37:46] change you from being an eagle
[1:37:49] your ego
[1:37:51] you'll miss a lot of the opportunities
[1:37:53] because you allow satan to put you in a
[1:37:55] cage
[1:37:56] but it can never change who you are
[1:38:00] that was fresh from the throne
[1:38:05] hallelujah so you got to understand
[1:38:09] god is able to unl he's able to break
[1:38:12] the chains
[1:38:13] he's able to open the door is that the
[1:38:15] right the bible says
[1:38:16] that he will break the fowler's snare
[1:38:20] that's god
[1:38:22] this is why we celebrate and do what we
[1:38:24] do when it comes communion because we're
[1:38:25] celebrating our victory through jesus
[1:38:27] christ
[1:38:29] the blood of the lamb
[1:38:30] that not only washes our sins away it
[1:38:32] heals us it delivers us it gives us the
[1:38:36] right mind the right spirit the right
[1:38:38] everything
[1:38:39] that's jesus christ let me tell you
[1:38:41] something and he didn't leave anything
[1:38:43] undone
[1:38:45] this detergent this agent that washes
[1:38:48] all the way your washes your sins all
[1:38:51] the way it still works
[1:38:53] and has never lost its power never will
[1:38:56] lose its power oh jesus
[1:39:00] i tell you what i'm a little tired i
[1:39:02] feel like jumping a little bit i wish
[1:39:06] and that's what i was telling the church
[1:39:08] some of the brothers i said i hadn't
[1:39:10] seen a real holy ghost shout meeting in
[1:39:13] a long time you know what we did we left
[1:39:16] the dance with the pentecostal people
[1:39:18] and we ought to be ashamed
[1:39:20] if anybody should be dancing and
[1:39:23] worshiping and praising god like the
[1:39:24] prophet of god said don't jump no higher
[1:39:26] than you live but then you need to be
[1:39:28] jumping high
[1:39:31] because paul said it's not i that live
[1:39:32] but christ that lives in me and if you
[1:39:34] can't jump high on that when something's
[1:39:35] wrong with you
[1:39:38] oh jesus have mercy lord
[1:39:40] i'm having fun because he's here
[1:39:44] oh praise the lord
[1:39:46] i learned
[1:39:49] that in the course of this
[1:39:53] uh we we we are in a place where
[1:39:58] we must understand that
[1:40:01] our enemy
[1:40:02] is not our brother and sister i had
[1:40:05] i have to minister that on wednesday
[1:40:07] probably
[1:40:09] our enemy is
[1:40:13] it's the devil
[1:40:17] the way he influences us against one
[1:40:19] another and you know what we allow it to
[1:40:21] happen
[1:40:23] we allows it we allow it to happen we
[1:40:25] allow it to go on and when we do allow
[1:40:28] it and i'm closing
[1:40:29] if you want to stand
[1:40:31] when
[1:40:32] when we allow these things we allow
[1:40:34] satan to come in and defeat us
[1:40:36] and and you know because he knows a
[1:40:38] house divided can't stand
[1:40:41] he knows that if he can get us going at
[1:40:43] each other he's he's accomplished
[1:40:45] everything
[1:40:49] i i was even telling the church in iowa
[1:40:51] city this morning
[1:40:54] what i felt last sunday was unbelievable
[1:40:58] and i never ever want to experience that
[1:41:00] again and i hope and trust that the
[1:41:01] church will keep
[1:41:03] that kind of a darkness out of this
[1:41:05] place
[1:41:06] it was such a dark voidness
[1:41:09] as if god wasn't here
[1:41:11] i know he was because it was in me
[1:41:14] and i'm summoning some of us but my
[1:41:16] point is this that was something that
[1:41:19] we fought with
[1:41:21] when it came into the church i
[1:41:23] sensed it and didn't know where it came
[1:41:25] from
[1:41:26] where it was coming from
[1:41:27] [Music]
[1:41:31] let me tell you young people
[1:41:33] as well as the elders
[1:41:37] this is not a time to give up
[1:41:40] you you know tell you something i know
[1:41:42] you fighting because i'm fighting with
[1:41:44] everything i got
[1:41:46] to stay spiritual
[1:41:48] y'all understand me
[1:41:49] there was a time we could at least spend
[1:41:51] a whole day in the presence of the lord
[1:41:54] without any battles but now you've got
[1:41:56] to battle all day to stay
[1:41:58] in his presence
[1:42:00] it's amazing
[1:42:02] the struggles that we're going through
[1:42:04] right now and this is the day that
[1:42:06] isaiah said that that old enemy would
[1:42:10] wear the saints out
[1:42:12] and y'all know what i'm talking about
[1:42:15] you can't slack in your prayers you
[1:42:17] can't slack in your reading you can't
[1:42:19] slack in your praise nowhere because as
[1:42:22] soon as you slack you allow a crack to
[1:42:26] come through
[1:42:27] and when you allow that crack to come in
[1:42:29] here come the devil and his influence
[1:42:32] we've got to stay in prayer we've got to
[1:42:35] stay consecrated as much as possible and
[1:42:37] i know what i'm talking about
[1:42:40] i know what i'm talking about i know how
[1:42:42] i've had to battle and if i'm battling
[1:42:44] you've got to be battling too
[1:42:47] that's why i always ask you for your
[1:42:49] prayers because it's like it's like
[1:42:52] a bowling ball if that if he rolled that
[1:42:55] ball just right he'll hit that main pin
[1:42:58] and if he hit that main pin everything
[1:43:00] breaks
[1:43:02] that's who i am i'm the main pen
[1:43:06] and satan is always after me
[1:43:08] because he know if he could get me to
[1:43:10] fall
[1:43:11] many will fall with me
[1:43:14] god help me
[1:43:15] that i will not allow satan to do that
[1:43:17] to me
[1:43:19] may god help you to keep satan
[1:43:22] from bringing you to a fall
[1:43:25] but if he does
[1:43:27] guess what
[1:43:29] a righteous man falls seven times in the
[1:43:31] day
[1:43:32] and he gets up
[1:43:35] the devil is defeated he's defeated
[1:43:39] i'm gonna be reading
[1:43:42] from first corinthians
[1:43:45] we asked our brother troy to come help
[1:43:47] us with this
[1:43:49] i'll go and prepare myself
[1:43:52] let's read this first
[1:43:54] for i have received of the lord that
[1:43:56] which also i delivered unto you
[1:43:59] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:44:02] which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:44:06] when he had given thanks he break it and
[1:44:08] said
[1:44:09] take eat this is my body which is broken
[1:44:12] for you
[1:44:13] this dude remembers of me
[1:44:16] after the same manner also he took the
[1:44:18] cup when he had stopped saying this cup
[1:44:22] is the new testament in my blood
[1:44:25] this to e as oft as you drink it in
[1:44:28] remembrance of me
[1:44:29] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:44:32] drink this cup ye do show the lord's
[1:44:34] death till he comes
[1:44:38] wherefore
[1:44:39] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:44:41] this cup of the lord
[1:44:42] unworthily
[1:44:44] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:44:46] the lord but let a man examine himself
[1:44:51] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:44:53] drink of this cup
[1:44:54] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:44:56] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:44:58] to himself not discerning the lord's
[1:45:00] body for this cause many of us are weak
[1:45:04] and sickly among you
[1:45:06] and many sleep
[1:45:07] for if we would judge ourselves
[1:45:10] we should not be judged
[1:45:12] that's the key to all that i've read
[1:45:15] judge yourself
[1:45:16] if you see something that should be
[1:45:19] taken care of take care of it
[1:45:21] something personally take care of it
[1:45:23] lord forgive me that's where the water
[1:45:26] washes you
[1:45:27] you know a lot of times people forget
[1:45:29] this portion and they walk out and says
[1:45:31] i'm not worthy to take communion oh
[1:45:32] you're not worthy because you failed to
[1:45:34] wash
[1:45:35] you fail to say god forgive me the blood
[1:45:37] of jesus christ is here to wash away all
[1:45:40] your sins
[1:45:42] right because all of us amen when
[1:45:44] examining ourselves we search deep down
[1:45:47] and we know lord i thought this lord i
[1:45:50] acted in this way lord forgive me you
[1:45:52] know it's just easy you don't have to do
[1:45:54] pencils
[1:45:56] you just confess and make things right
[1:45:57] before the lord
[1:45:59] that's all that's where it's at
[1:46:02] hallelujah
[1:46:04] right
[1:46:06] but when you are judged and are
[1:46:08] chastened of the lord that we should not
[1:46:11] be condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:46:13] brethren
[1:46:14] when you come together to eat tarry one
[1:46:16] for another and if any man hunger let
[1:46:20] him eat at home
