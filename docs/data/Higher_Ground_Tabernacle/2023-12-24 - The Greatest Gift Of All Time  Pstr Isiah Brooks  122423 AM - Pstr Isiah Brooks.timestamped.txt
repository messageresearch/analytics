[14:32] done only the true bride of

[14:39] the
[14:41] understanding revelation of the birth of
[14:49] Christ but we
[14:51] know without a birth There Is No
[14:54] Death and when there is no death there
[14:56] is no
[14:57] Resurrection

[17:40] remember ever having to preach on what
[17:43] we call Christmas
[17:47] Eve yes that's what it is amen I get
[17:50] mixed up
[17:53] sometime but I trust by the grace of
[17:56] God that the message this morning will
[17:59] be a blessing to
[18:01] you I'm not here to uh criticize
[18:06] anyone because we've been we've been
[18:08] taught by Malachi 4 how to
[18:11] worship how to celebrate this time so
[18:15] I'm not against any of you who are uh
[18:18] doing and being
[18:20] led by God to to celebrate during this
[18:25] time but we also know
[18:29] uh that he Jesus wasn't born in the
[18:31] winter
[18:32] [Music]
[18:34] time and we also know that he was born
[18:37] in the time of the
[18:38] spring when when Lambs are
[18:42] born and we also we also
[18:45] know that the
[18:47] Magi came brother and told him that
[18:52] birth was the
[18:54] memorial of the birth of Jesus
[18:56] Christ we don't
[18:59] when it
[19:01] happened God has given
[19:06] us is that all right he was born in a
[19:09] time when people could
[19:11] [Music]
[19:13] travel as we could recall the scripture
[19:17] he was born at a time of
[19:20] taxing Hallelujah and we know by God's
[19:24] grace as brother Bram teaches
[19:27] us that the the the
[19:30] uh
[19:34] churchan or the
[19:36] churches was not
[19:39] included in the celebration of his
[19:42] birth uh because when the wise men went
[19:46] to
[19:47] Jerusalem looking for
[19:50] him and looking for the
[19:52] star he was not there and
[19:57] Jerusalem presented the
[19:59] organizations
[20:01] denominations Hallelujah but God
[20:05] Amen uh chose three wise
[20:09] men
[20:11] Hallelujah and we know that these
[20:14] Magi represented ham sham and
[20:17] Jeff Hallelujah which are the the three
[20:21] pure
[20:22] races that was on the earth at that
[20:25] time it represented all people
[20:29] the blood of Jesus Christ
[20:32] represented it was a representation for
[20:34] all people hallelujah anybody that wants
[20:38] to be
[20:39] saved could be saved through the blood
[20:42] of Jesus
[20:43] Christ it doesn't matter your
[20:46] inheritance where you came from how you
[20:50] got here the blood of Jesus
[20:53] Christ still
[20:55] works Hallelujah we've learned in this
[20:58] last
[20:59] day look look
[21:02] around oh it's it's a real hard
[21:05] time it's a it's a difficult
[21:08] time Hallelujah but we find out that
[21:12] when the world celebrates
[21:14] Christmas they they celebrate Christmas
[21:17] as
[21:18] if they're worshiping
[21:20] ba Hallelujah and we
[21:24] know that when the when the three wise
[21:26] men came
[21:28] bearing gifts to
[21:31] Jesus Hallelujah they didn't have no
[21:34] Creeds they had no
[21:36] dogmas all they had was their
[21:39] hearts and their hearts were pure
[21:42] Hallelujah when the M men came to
[21:45] worship him as I said there was no
[21:48] distraction there was no organization of
[21:53] they were all Left Behind in
[21:56] Jerusalem guess we found out that in
[21:59] Jerusalem they wanted to kill him as a
[22:02] baby Hallelujah and in
[22:05] Jerusalem they killed him as a man
[22:09] Hallelujah They Crucified him in the
[22:12] most holy city on earth Hallelujah is
[22:16] that right but in the midst of all of
[22:20] that there were
[22:22] those who had a
[22:25] revelation who the Christ child
[22:29] was Hallelujah you see God never leaves
[22:33] himself without a
[22:36] witness Hallelujah he was born in the
[22:40] natural in a place called
[22:42] Bethlehem I'm not going to just preach
[22:45] on the Christ child I'm going to preach
[22:48] on
[22:49] you amen because you and I according to
[22:53] the brother Bram must be
[22:56] born in

[23:32] me and cut a hole through this line of
[23:36] unbelieving

[23:44] world trying to make it Creed and feed
[23:48] the people there's a world there's a
[23:51] fountain opening the House of
[23:54] David Bethlehem for sin and
[23:58] uncleanness brother sin is unbelief in

[24:32] Warrior that can see the Millennium
[24:35] coming what Warrior can see this great
[24:38] Holy
[24:39] Spirit come in the form of Jesus Christ

[25:03] a Pentecostal
[25:05] Waters original Pentecost not a bunch of
[25:09] carrying on screaming and holling
[25:12] Hallelujah here I mean a
[25:15] genuine Holy Ghost baptism that produces
[25:18] the life of Jesus Christ back into the
[25:21] person Hallelujah now that's what the
[25:24] birth of Jesus was all about to bring
[25:27] The Life of Christ back to the believer
[25:31] Hallelujah and every true Saint or
[25:36] Christian must be
[25:38] born Hallelujah you must have an
[25:42] experience in the manger of your
[25:45] heart Hallelujah is that right there
[25:49] must be a birth Hallelujah is that right
[25:54] now as I

[26:00] know that the Messiah was being
[26:03] born
[26:05] Hallelujah only those shepherds in the
[26:08] field and the wise men who still seeks
[26:12] him Hallelujah as I said we had ham and
[26:15] Sham and
[26:17] Jeff the three pure nations of the world
[26:21] and everything else is a
[26:24] mixture Hallelujah come on somebody car
[26:29] Calvary removed all the curses of man so
[26:34] much so that the blood stood for for
[26:37] every
[26:38] tongue and Nation Hallelujah that's why
[26:43] the devil has tried to kill him
[26:45] Hallelujah the devil killed uh killed uh
[26:49] Abel thought he was killing Christ
[26:52] Hallelujah you understand me but then
[26:55] come there came
[26:58] one in the image of ad by the name of
[27:03] Enoch who beat
[27:05] Death beat
[27:07] hell beat the grave
[27:10] Hallelujah and that's the day we're
[27:12] living in Hallelujah in the day that the
[27:16] Bride of Jesus Christ will defeat
[27:21] Satan death hell and the grave
[27:25] Hallelujah this is what the birth was
[27:27] all about out to restore Fallen Adam

[30:18] gift God ever gave
[30:22] man was locked up in
[30:25] Christ amen
[30:27] when they saw
[30:29] Jesus many of them thought he was a son
[30:32] of
[30:35] fornication when many when many of them
[30:37] saw
[30:38] him they saw a Nazarite a nazarine
[30:42] excuse me and they thought can anything
[30:45] good come out of
[30:47] Nazareth some saw him as
[30:50] be Hallelujah the prince of the Devils
[30:53] Hallelujah the y'all understand me but
[30:56] then there were
[30:57] those who had a
[30:59] [Music]
[31:00] revelation like
[31:03] Hannah and and and and the other Prophet
[31:06] amen who stood there in the
[31:09] temple waiting for the coming of the
[31:13] Lord hallelujah y understand me when he

[31:49] got to mature we got to go through some
[31:51] hard trials we've got to go through some
[31:55] tests and this is why Jesus J said if

[47:27] was for Jesus to to go up
[47:31] Calvary the pain that he had to
[47:35] endure Hallelujah and all the while he
[47:40] had you in
[47:43] mind you understand

[48:26] had to come pay for your
[48:28] word and the devil will tell you you're
[48:31] not worth
[48:33] anything he's a
[48:35] liar because God came down you

[51:35] scattered Hallelujah and when he went to
[51:39] Calvary he went there as a
[51:42] man all by

[1:00:02] on a
[1:00:03] shelf you you cultivate

[1:00:09] Holy
[1:00:10] Ghost when you're reading your
[1:00:14] word that's where you get your strength
[1:00:17] he quickens that word to you and your
[1:00:20] strength comes through the
[1:00:22] word hallelujah
[1:00:26] first
[1:00:28] verse therefore we ought to give the
[1:00:31] most Earnest heed to the things which we
[1:00:33] have heard lest in at any time we should
[1:00:37] let them
[1:00:42] slip
[1:00:45] for for if the words spoken by Angels
[1:00:48] were
[1:00:49] steadfast and every transgression and
[1:00:52] Disobedience received a just recompense
[1:00:54] of
[1:00:58] reward brother brand says that these
[1:01:01] Angels were
[1:01:03] Messengers you know every
[1:01:06] word and understand it says you know
[1:01:09] when you transgress there that
[1:01:12] word when you become disobedient to it
[1:01:16] there's a just recompense of
[1:01:18] reward hallelujah what shall we escape
[1:01:22] how shall we
[1:01:23] escape if we nect so great
[1:01:27] salvation which at the first began to be
[1:01:29] spoken by the Lord and was confirmed
[1:01:32] unto us by them that heard
[1:01:36] him Hallelujah god listen when brother R
[1:01:40] was preaching and all the others were
[1:01:43] preaching under thato that was
[1:01:47] God right god with skin on
[1:01:52] him God also be bearing them
[1:01:56] witness fourth verse God also bearing
[1:01:59] them witness both with signs and wonders
[1:02:01] and with diverse Miracles and Gifts of
[1:02:04] the Holy Ghost according to his own
[1:02:09] [Music]
[1:02:12] will when when Peter was at the gate of
[1:02:16] beautiful Silver and Gold Have I
[1:02:19] None such as I have give I
[1:02:22] the that was God God speaking through
[1:02:26] Peter because Peter can't heal nobody
[1:02:29] you can't heal nobody I can't heal
[1:02:33] nobody there's only one Healer and
[1:02:36] that's Jesus Christ
[1:02:37] himself
[1:02:39] Hallelujah every believer must produce
[1:02:43] gold every believer must produce
[1:02:48] frankincense did you know that that that
[1:02:50] the incent before you get into the
[1:02:52] holies of holies
[1:02:57] Saint it's your prayer so my question is
[1:03:02] is your bottle
[1:03:04] empty if there's no prayer there's no
[1:03:09] incense so if there's no incense you
[1:03:12] have stopped the order of
[1:03:17] God
[1:03:21] Amen yes and M which is
[1:03:26] bitter he must die to himself in order
[1:03:30] to produce
[1:03:32] Christ in other words we must die to
[1:03:35] ourselves in order to produce
[1:03:38] Christ I have another quote I'm almost
[1:03:41] done coming for little Bethlehem
[1:03:46] 19 Prophet God says Jesus was
[1:03:50] God not a
[1:03:53] Jew remember the blood cell come from
[1:03:56] the male
[1:03:59] sex and he was not a
[1:04:01] man or
[1:04:03] Gentile he God created in
[1:04:08] flesh we're not saved by the blood of a
[1:04:11] Jew or the blood of
[1:04:14] Gentiles we're saved by the blood of
[1:04:17] God he was God nothing less he wasn't
[1:04:22] Jew nor Gentile created blood in
[1:04:27] him God created blood in
[1:04:30] him he was a Jew he a Jew or
[1:04:35] Gentile he said if he was a Jew or a
[1:04:39] gentile we're all
[1:04:41] lost he was God in
[1:04:45] flesh now let me say this I know we've
[1:04:49] thought about it many
[1:04:50] times this is why Satan does whatever
[1:04:54] ever he can do to keep us from breaking
[1:04:57] through into that Holy
[1:05:00] realm because he
[1:05:02] knows the life of the blood is the Holy
[1:05:06] Ghost and once that life is in
[1:05:09] you it's not the life of a Jew it's not
[1:05:13] the life of a
[1:05:14] gentile but it's the life of
[1:05:18] God that's what it keeping us
[1:05:21] away well brother brother I believe that
[1:05:24] message you know I follow brother
[1:05:27] brand but I'm going tell you
[1:05:29] something everybody that followed
[1:05:33] Jesus didn't make it to
[1:05:39] Pentecost many of them saw the healings
[1:05:42] many saw the
[1:05:44] deliverances and all of this stuff and
[1:05:48] and you know it's so amazing how people
[1:05:49] have brought cre and dogmas into the
[1:05:53] message
[1:05:55] and some men will tell their wives you
[1:05:56] don't need the Holy
[1:05:59] Ghost they told you a
[1:06:02] lie are you going to make it because I'm
[1:06:04] going to make it How am I'm going to
[1:06:07] rest on you making
[1:06:09] it you I'm going to put my salvation in
[1:06:13] you yeah come
[1:06:17] again you understand if Mary had to get
[1:06:22] there who was called the mother of
[1:06:25] Jesus she had like the prophet of God
[1:06:27] said she had to go to
[1:06:30] Pentecost and she staggered like a
[1:06:34] drunkard that's another
[1:06:36] thing we don't mind dancing in our
[1:06:40] form but we have a problem when God
[1:06:44] wants you to dance like he wants you to
[1:06:47] dance have you ever
[1:06:49] danced without a
[1:06:52] beat Hallelujah
[1:06:54] glory to God I mean really dance the
[1:06:57] Holy Ghost got you moving and you don't
[1:06:59] know which way you're going to
[1:07:01] go
[1:07:03] Hallelujah I was at this church
[1:07:07] in I was at this church in
[1:07:11] Arizona and I was really jumping and
[1:07:14] everything and I almost
[1:07:16] tripped and I said Lord if I
[1:07:19] fall they going to see for the first
[1:07:21] time a Holy
[1:07:22] Roller
[1:07:26] cuz I'm going to fall and I'm going roll
[1:07:28] and have me a good
[1:07:31] time brother R said he' never seen a
[1:07:33] Holy Roller I've seen him I've seen
[1:07:36] him yes they were those who did roll on
[1:07:38] the
[1:07:39] floor scared me half to death during
[1:07:43] that time I wasn't a
[1:07:45] Christian now let me move on I'm almost
[1:07:48] done
[1:07:50] see I I love this message he said now
[1:07:54] that is the
[1:07:56] Revelation Jesus Christ is God this is
[1:08:00] the
[1:08:01] exposition the Jehovah of the Old
[1:08:05] Testament is the Jesus of the
[1:08:09] new and no matter how hard we
[1:08:13] try you can't prove that there are three
[1:08:17] Gods but it also takes a
[1:08:20] revelation by the Holy Spirit to make
[1:08:24] you
[1:08:25] understand the truth that he is one y
[1:08:28] yall hear what I'm saying it takes a
[1:08:31] revelation for you to understand that he
[1:08:34] is one it takes a
[1:08:37] revelation to see that Jehovah of the
[1:08:40] Old Testament is Jesus of the
[1:08:43] new Satan crept into the church and
[1:08:47] blinded the people to this
[1:08:50] truth and when they were blinded to it
[1:08:55] it wasn't long until the Church of
[1:08:57] Rome stop
[1:08:59] baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:09:03] Christ hallelujah what are you saying
[1:09:05] brother those who are not baptized in
[1:09:09] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ have
[1:09:11] been blinded by the
[1:09:15] age
[1:09:17] Hallelujah we
[1:09:20] must keep our eyes on the
[1:09:22] cross see the greatest gift that God
[1:09:25] could ever give
[1:09:28] you was
[1:09:31] himself right those of us who
[1:09:35] married and you get all these
[1:09:38] gifts from everybody you love those
[1:09:42] gifts but the greatest gift is your
[1:09:46] husband or your
[1:09:48] wife you understand me and none of us
[1:09:53] would tray our our husband or our
[1:09:55] wives any gifts
[1:09:58] given y'all hear what I'm saying that's
[1:10:01] why brother brandham said out of all the
[1:10:05] gifts if I had to make a
[1:10:07] choice he said I would choose Divine
[1:10:11] love I choose Divine love over speaking
[1:10:13] in tongues I
[1:10:16] choose over
[1:10:18] prophecy I choose Divine love over
[1:10:20] healings I choose Divine love over
[1:10:23] everything
[1:10:25] why because love conquers
[1:10:29] all and love is the only thing that will
[1:10:32] not fail
[1:10:34] div is the only thing that will not
[1:10:42] fail yeah I got to read this and I'm
[1:10:44] closing this is true I am
[1:10:48] closing I've said that several times
[1:10:50] don't mean to be a li but this is true
[1:10:54] when a fellow receive Christ as his
[1:10:59] savior everything is on the
[1:11:04] housetop but but before this man can
[1:11:07] come into the baptism of the holy
[1:11:11] spirit this person he must first have a
[1:11:15] sanctifying
[1:11:18] process he must have a testing time in
[1:11:21] his
[1:11:22] life
[1:11:24] all of you had
[1:11:26] it he has this testing
[1:11:29] time every Sunday cometh to God is first
[1:11:36] scored
[1:11:38] chased and if we cannot stand the
[1:11:42] chastisement then it shows we're not
[1:11:44] children of
[1:11:45] God we are bastards and not children of
[1:11:49] God the Bible says but if we can stand
[1:11:53] and the
[1:11:55] chastisement knowing that all things
[1:11:57] work together for the good of them that
[1:12:00] love God then we are Sons and Daughters
[1:12:04] of
[1:12:05] God then he seals us with the Holy
[1:12:08] Spirit until the day of our
[1:12:11] Redemption Hallelujah he says see that's
[1:12:15] that's the
[1:12:16] chastisement The Strain the things we go
[1:12:21] through Hallelujah is that all right
[1:12:23] with you is what we must go
[1:12:27] through you see what I'm getting at if
[1:12:31] you believe
[1:12:32] it then let let's live like
[1:12:36] it let's produce what we're talking
[1:12:39] about that's what I'm talking about
[1:12:41] right there let's produce what we're
[1:12:43] talking
[1:12:45] about because that we keep our minds on
[1:12:48] the
[1:12:50] church and on this organiz ation on this
[1:12:55] group and this woman and that man he
[1:12:59] says take your mind off of
[1:13:04] them they'll
[1:13:06] fail put your mind on
[1:13:09] Christ on his
[1:13:13] [Music]
[1:13:15] word he say let him be your
[1:13:19] example not a
[1:13:21] man amen
[1:13:26] brother Brooks ain't my
[1:13:28] example Jesus Christ is my
[1:13:40] example I hope you got the
[1:13:43] point you got to cut through all of this
[1:13:49] stuff the message is
[1:13:51] right but there's God there to be
[1:13:53] somebody
[1:13:55] here besides
[1:13:57] myself that want to see this thing
[1:13:59] produce what it
[1:14:02] says I'm tired of the
[1:14:05] religion I'm tired of the
[1:14:08] facade I'm tired of Christians who know
[1:14:11] they need the Holy Ghost too
[1:14:14] Pride to Adit
[1:14:17] it hallelujah it's a it's amazing that
[1:14:21] many of us followed this message
[1:14:24] and you still don't know
[1:14:27] him Hallelujah but that's why God
[1:14:31] came we celebrate
[1:14:34] Christmas but just like the prophet of
[1:14:36] God
[1:14:36] says he talked more about his
[1:14:40] resurrection than anything Hallelujah
[1:14:44] and you and I must
[1:14:46] understand that the very Life of
[1:14:49] Christ is now being
[1:14:52] transferred to the
[1:14:54] believer Hallelujah that's how we see
[1:14:57] him not in some other man but know that
[1:15:01] he's on the inside of you Hallelujah
[1:15:05] remember brother
[1:15:07] Bosworth when he was about ready to
[1:15:09] die brother brandom asked him when is
[1:15:13] your greatest moment of of
[1:15:17] time he said right down brother BR said
[1:15:21] you know that you're dying
[1:15:24] he said I cannot
[1:15:25] die
[1:15:27] Hallelujah I've been I've died long time
[1:15:30] ago but he said this is the best moment
[1:15:33] of my
[1:15:35] life because I know that in just a
[1:15:37] moment's
[1:15:39] time Jesus is going to walk through that
[1:15:44] door see that's the kind of assurance we
[1:15:47] want that's the kind of assurance we
[1:15:50] need and I said Lord I says Lord
[1:15:54] whatever you do don't let me die in
[1:15:57] shame Hallelujah don't let me die
[1:16:01] naked but let me be clothed in your
[1:16:06] righteousness Hallelujah listen what the
[1:16:09] prophet of God said in my I'm and I'm
[1:16:11] closing he said I know you get up from
[1:16:14] the
[1:16:15] altar crying and
[1:16:18] boohoo squealing and
[1:16:21] slobbering he said but it brings
[1:16:24] life it takes the starch out of
[1:16:27] you it makes you something that you
[1:16:29] ought to
[1:16:31] be it takes all the world and stiff neck
[1:16:34] out of
[1:16:35] you and today we just walk up and say I
[1:16:39] take Jesus for my personal savior he
[1:16:43] said that will never take the place of a
[1:16:45] new
[1:16:46] birth and women come to the Altar and
[1:16:50] forget where they are who and who's
[1:16:52] around them
[1:16:55] until they really die out and are born
[1:16:59] again all night prayer meetings and the
[1:17:02] power of the Holy Ghost back get back
[1:17:05] into the church again that's what we
[1:17:08] need today is good old time St Paul
[1:17:13] Revival the Bible Holy Ghost preached
[1:17:16] back into the
[1:17:18] power theity
[1:17:22] PR in the power of the
[1:17:25] Resurrection Hallelujah that's what he
[1:17:27] said Paul said I didn't come to you with
[1:17:31] words to wisdom your faith will be built
[1:17:34] upon the wisdom of men but I come
[1:17:37] preaching the power of the Holy
[1:17:39] Ghost be buil upon the holy
[1:17:42] spirit church needs that
[1:17:45] today and when the subtit and and when
[1:17:48] we

[1:17:55] starchy and
[1:17:57] stiff we're losing the very
[1:18:00] secret and our locks are being shaved
