[13:23] do things and as our brother Troy said
[13:27] this morning where two or three are
[13:28] gathered in his name there he is in the
[13:32] midst let's find a word of Prayer
[13:36] dear Jesus how sweet and lovely is your
[13:41] name there is none other like you and
[13:46] father we thank you for those who gave
[13:50] those who've had a desire to give bless
[13:54] them both Lord bless your ministry Lord
[13:57] here anoint your people break and
[14:00] destroy the yokes of the enemy Lord we
[14:03] ask these things in your name Jesus
[14:04] Christ we pray amen you may be seated as
[14:12] we were saying it's good to see our
[14:17] sister God is so good to us man we're
[14:22] glad to see everybody here today amen so
[14:33] I won't forget brother Maurice we'll
[14:34] speak with you after service you're not
[14:37] in trouble
[14:40] no brother Maurice that's okay
[14:46] yes okay God is good to us amen and we
[14:50] just love the Lord they were supposed to
[14:56] be baptism today
[15:02] I don't see the sister but God knows and
[15:09] we're praying for the sick afterwards by
[15:12] God's grace before I get into the
[15:18] message I'd like to say that we're
[15:21] getting ready to embrace a new year and
[15:25] I don't know about you but I want to be
[15:28] a better Christian this coming year than
[15:30] I was the year before I want to get to a
[15:34] place where there's no difference
[15:36] between me and my lord
[15:38] so I desire your prayers pray for me and
[15:45] I'll pray for you that God's perfect
[15:48] will be done the reason why we're having
[15:51] the New Year's Eve service down and Iowa
[15:55] City only because I asked I told them
[15:57] last year when we traded up that we we
[16:00] had it here last year and I told him we
[16:03] would switch it up and so they'd brought
[16:04] that to my memory and that's the reason
[16:08] why we're having the service down there
[16:10] but from this point on if the Lord Terry
[16:15] we'll just have it here and they would
[16:17] have to migrate this way because it's a
[16:19] bigger place so those of you who can
[16:23] make it on the 31st down there for the
[16:25] services they start the service start at
[16:28] 10 have testimonies if you like whatever
[16:32] God places on your heart songs but we
[16:36] come to have a glorious time and this is
[16:41] it won't be a funeral service we're
[16:44] coming to have a glorious time and we
[16:47] want people to have their Liberty like I
[16:50] told them you could shout dance and
[16:51] whatever more you want to do because God
[16:54] has brought us a mighty long way coming
[16:58] from the scripture you may stand now
[17:10] I'd like to read three passages of
[17:12] scripture and I come from
[17:19] first Timothy 6:15 see that our sister
[17:28] they all missed you hanging in there I
[17:37] think we should be the most happiest
[17:40] people in the world and but the Frank is
[17:48] going to pass out some headsets someone
[17:53] would assist him especially seeing the
[17:59] time that we're living in I believe that
[18:03] we are at the closing of everything I
[18:07] believe the message I believe the seven
[18:11] seals is opened and I believe time shall
[18:16] be no more we have come to a time where
[18:21] everything is ending fast and quickly we
[18:29] know by God's grace that our prophet
[18:33] told us years ago that America is a
[18:35] woman's nation and we can see that
[18:39] coming into play clearer now than ever
[18:41] before but at the same time we're when
[18:47] everything else is falling apart there
[18:49] is a uniting of the bride of Jesus
[18:50] Christ
[18:52] we're not united by a church that we
[18:57] attend the Bible says by one spirit are
[19:02] we baptized into the body of Christ so
[19:07] by God's grace were trusting that
[19:09] everybody has received that baptism
[19:15] because it's important we won't make a
[19:18] rapture without it it doesn't say that
[19:22] you're not saved
[19:24] but you won't make a rapture without the
[19:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[19:31] first Timothy 6:15 first Timothy 6:15
[19:39] everybody loved the Lord this morning I
[19:43] will try my best to keep these thoughts
[19:49] the Lord has been so gracious to me in
[19:54] these last last few days we have had
[20:02] tremendous mind battles but one thing I
[20:08] know for sure through it all God has
[20:14] given us the victory
[20:16] first Timothy 6:15 which in his time he
[20:27] shall show who is the blessed and only
[20:34] potentate the king of kings and the Lord
[20:41] of lords if we would then go down to
[20:52] Romans the 11th chapter Romans the 11th
[21:01] chapter
[21:08] we all are going through tremendous
[21:11] battles but we don't have to worry if
[21:22] you are in the cleft of the rock the
[21:28] storm will pass over
[21:32] Romy's 1132 well God have concluded them
[21:39] all in unbelief that he might have mercy
[21:43] upon all I love that oh the depth of the
[21:52] riches both of the wisdom and knowledge
[21:56] of God how unsearchable are his
[21:59] judgments and his ways past finding out
[22:06] for who have known the mind of the Lord
[22:10] or who had been his counselor or who
[22:16] have first given to him and it shall be
[22:20] recompense unto him again for of him and
[22:27] through him and to him are all things to
[22:31] whom be glory forever amen
[22:43] can we go to another scripture let's go
[22:45] to another scripture if you don't mind
[22:47] standing first corinthians the second
[22:51] chapter we'll begin reading at the sixth
[22:57] verse 1st corinthians 2 6 howbeit we
[23:08] speak wisdom among them that are perfect
[23:11] I like that
[23:14] yet not the wisdom of this world nor of
[23:20] the princes of this world that come to
[23:22] naught
[23:24] but we speak the wisdom of God in a
[23:27] mystery even the hidden wisdom which God
[23:34] ordained before the world unto our glory
[23:40] which none of the princes of this world
[23:43] knew for had they known it they would
[23:50] not have crucified the Lord of glory but
[23:57] as it is written I have not seen nor ear
[24:03] heard neither have entered into the
[24:06] heart of man the things which God had
[24:10] prepared for them that love him but God
[24:14] have revealed them unto us by his spirit
[24:18] for the spirit searches all things yea
[24:23] the deep things of God but the natural
[24:28] man receiveth not the things of the
[24:30] Spirit of God I've jumped down to the
[24:34] 14th verse I'm sorry down to the 14th
[24:37] verse of the same chapter but the
[24:40] natural man receiveth not the things of
[24:43] the Spirit of God for they are
[24:46] foolishness unto Him neither can he know
[24:51] them because they are spiritually
[24:53] discerned
[24:55] but he that is spiritually judgeth all
[24:59] things yet he himself its judged of no
[25:03] man 16th verse in closing for who have
[25:10] known the mind of the Lord that he may
[25:14] instruct him but we have the mind of
[25:20] Christ let us pray father God we come
[25:26] before your Lord as humbly as we know
[25:29] how we thank you for being so good to us
[25:33] you have been better to us Lord than we
[25:36] have been to ourselves I thank you for
[25:40] your presence Lord I'm so unworthy Lord
[25:44] but I thank you because you have made us
[25:46] worthy you have caused us to be accepted
[25:49] in your dear son Jesus Christ and we're
[25:53] grateful for that
[25:55] words cannot express our gratitude this
[25:58] morning and we just pray right now Lord
[26:01] that you bless the service I pray for
[26:05] our sister Janina who's standing in the
[26:08] need of prayer Lord that you would touch
[26:11] her lord coz you are the healer you're
[26:15] the one who can change things transform
[26:20] make something different into something
[26:25] else lord help us now as we commit this
[26:30] service into your hands in Jesus
[26:33] Christ's name we pray amen
[26:35] you may be seated I'll try my best to
[26:41] counter go at this pace so that those
[26:46] who are interpreting may be able to
[26:51] relate the message to those who need to
[26:53] listen or to hear I thought about God
[26:59] and I've been thinking about God and
[27:01] just thinking about how powerful he is
[27:07] often time we we forget just how
[27:11] powerful God is sometimes we worry in
[27:17] places where we shouldn't worry we often
[27:21] forget what's only inside of us because
[27:26] we're so used to feeling things seeing
[27:30] things tasting things we seem to just
[27:34] want to classify God or or how can I say
[27:38] a character arrives God's presence by
[27:42] our natural feelings but your natural
[27:45] feelings can arm sometimes be wrong so
[27:51] it's not wise to declare God's presence
[27:57] by hid your feelings because God
[28:01] declared that I will be with you I will
[28:05] always be with you
[28:07] I will never leave you and we must
[28:11] believe that and that faith doesn't feel
[28:16] you don't feel that you must come to
[28:19] know that I was telling brother Troy
[28:24] this morning Jesus never complained
[28:28] about being lonely when the seventy left
[28:34] him he never complained matter of fact
[28:39] he even asked his disciples will you go
[28:42] to when Judas left him he never
[28:47] complained the only time that he ever
[28:53] complained I would say complain but he
[28:57] asked God is his father why has thou
[29:01] forsaken me and brother Troy brought out
[29:05] that one scripture when Jesus says that
[29:08] God is always with me I was talking with
[29:15] a brother the other day and he made a
[29:19] statement that just
[29:22] echo through my soul is that when you
[29:27] are in the Shekinah glory you are never
[29:31] lonely and that was the difference
[29:36] Christ Jesus was always in the Sakana
[29:40] and the Shekinah was always in him and
[29:44] so therefore he did not know what it
[29:47] would feel like for the for the Almighty
[29:51] God to not be there but sometimes in our
[29:56] daily walk we question whether he's
[29:58] there or not but I want to say by God's
[30:03] grace that everything in the universe is
[30:08] connected yet there's only one God and
[30:14] the Bible declares that he's the only
[30:17] potentate in other words he's the only
[30:21] ruler he doesn't have to have counseling
[30:25] with anyone he doesn't have a board that
[30:29] regulates anything he's a regulator he
[30:34] Almighty God he is the one that we claim
[30:37] that's in us and I think about the
[30:42] majesty of the majestic part of God how
[30:46] that God
[30:47] connects everything and nothing moves
[30:50] until it will he wills it to move I
[30:54] think within my mind how that the world
[30:58] in itself can rotate around the Sun spin
[31:02] in the air and never miss a beat
[31:05] always the same time never gets behind
[31:09] in time why because our God is eternal
[31:14] and we understand that everything is
[31:18] moving by the power of God everybody's
[31:23] life is connected you may not think so
[31:26] but it's true we know that when someone
[31:30] passes on we always feel that some
[31:35] is now missing we can't explain it
[31:39] especially if it is a loved one someone
[31:44] we've been connected to someone that we
[31:47] knew and you know what is so funny
[31:48] because I used to wear funny but I mean
[31:52] it's strange that even those people who
[31:56] you may not even you may not have known
[31:59] but if they should pass away you miss
[32:03] their presence we're connected the world
[32:08] call it a circle of life it life is a
[32:13] circle it is eternal but not the way
[32:17] they defines it because you got to
[32:20] realize Amen that God does things in a
[32:24] way that sometimes I would say like this
[32:28] most of the time God's Way demands for
[32:34] us to have faith faith in God because
[32:40] his ways of past finding out even the
[32:45] prophet of God tells us that sometimes
[32:49] when we see what we call at night a
[32:51] shooting star he said it's not a star
[32:55] falling it's just light because if a
[32:59] star would move out of his orbit it
[33:02] would probably influence everything in
[33:05] the circle in the whole universe things
[33:10] will move will it will affect now you
[33:14] think about it what I'm saying because
[33:16] you got to realize that when Adam fail
[33:20] it affected the entire universe so much
[33:27] so that everything must be renewed
[33:30] everything must be done over a new
[33:33] creation had to be formed because of son
[33:37] of God got out of position so we must be
[33:43] in our place we must be as sons and
[33:48] daughter
[33:49] of God if we never fallen back there the
[33:54] thing would have been turning there have
[33:57] been no death and not nothing else but
[34:01] things be to God there is coming a
[34:04] paradox when God Himself was set her
[34:09] back in place where she should be is
[34:13] that right remember the ant alluvion
[34:16] world when they exploded the water and
[34:19] the water came in front of the earth the
[34:22] earth spun out from God out from the Sun
[34:26] and that's what we call the Ice Age but
[34:31] it was an instant freezing an instant
[34:35] cold is that right and every time we
[34:38] move out of the presence of God there is
[34:40] a chill there is a coldness that come
[34:43] upon us but when we in that presence God
[34:48] does something for you
[34:51] hallelujah most people don't even
[34:53] believe in a paradox why because it's
[34:56] unexplainable here we are we breathe in
[35:01] God's air every day and we can't even
[35:04] explain we don't have a motor and if we
[35:08] had a motor what's powering it up it's
[35:13] all invisible is that right it's all
[35:17] invisible and you and I must understand
[35:21] there are so many things that we cannot
[35:23] even explain but the Bible tells us
[35:26] trust the Lord with all of your heart
[35:30] and lean not to your own understanding I
[35:35] want to say it like this when sickness
[35:39] falls upon us we would have never known
[35:43] it was a bad spirit that causes the
[35:47] sickness hallelujah it was the Bible
[35:50] debt that are described what sickness is
[35:57] afflictions that it was demon power that
[36:02] caught
[36:02] all these things that happen to us is
[36:04] that right and all of those things came
[36:08] by the fall but think about it just at
[36:15] the speaking of a word by the authority
[36:19] of the word can make that devil leave
[36:23] now you can't explain it
[36:26] you and I don't see it when it happens
[36:30] we see the effects of it but when the
[36:34] devil leave we don't normally see the
[36:35] devil but the effects of his leaving
[36:40] brings our healing bring something about
[36:45] that we can see with our own eyes
[36:48] hallelujah the Bible said in the
[36:51] beginning was the word the Word was with
[36:53] God and the Word was God
[36:55] you know that's what I don't understand
[36:58] why people will allow demons to enter
[37:02] into their spirit and they have a hard
[37:04] time letting the Holy Ghost in I just
[37:10] got one amen
[37:12] you understand what I'm saying
[37:14] somehow the devil in our minds have
[37:21] deceived us because it is amazing how we
[37:26] will allow a spirit that's not of God to
[37:30] occupy when we've got the power to cast
[37:35] it out where two or three are gathered
[37:40] in my name the Bible said they can ask
[37:43] what they will Condon ask you to try to
[37:46] figure it out and all of us have to deal
[37:50] with spirits you understand me and I say
[37:55] this by the grace of God I'm trying to
[37:56] build your faith because brother Bruce
[38:00] can't do a thing but the Lord Jesus
[38:03] Christ can do all things and all things
[38:07] are possible to them that believe
[38:12] now sister came here for help
[38:16] if she can't get help from us where can
[38:19] she go you understand me
[38:22] I'm talking to a church this morning
[38:23] because I want you to realize by God's
[38:26] grace it's unexplainable but it's
[38:30] possible though what we need to
[38:39] understand that if the Shekinah glory is
[38:42] in you that's life everybody looks for
[38:48] that Fountain of Youth but that Fountain
[38:51] of Youth is God himself then he said he
[38:54] did not say he said to the woman at the
[38:57] well if you believe on me as the
[39:00] scripture has said out of your belly
[39:02] shall flow rivers of water you'll never
[39:06] thirst again that's the God we serve our
[39:14] God is not an organization our God is
[39:17] not a denomination our God is the word
[39:24] hallelujah you love the Lord we must
[39:27] realize that he is the only authority we
[39:31] cannot allow ourselves to believe that
[39:34] Satan has authority when we know he's
[39:37] been stripped Jesus Christ defeated the
[39:42] devil at Calvary hallelujah and it has
[39:47] been proven to us through this day by
[39:51] Malecha for cuz no man could have done
[39:55] what he did that was Jesus Christ openly
[40:00] showing us that what happened at Carey
[40:05] was a finished work hallelujah and what
[40:11] God is doing in you is a finished work
[40:14] there is nothing you can do to save
[40:18] yourself salvation is of the Lord hey
[40:25] somebody help me here do what
[40:29] God did for you and that's the thing we
[40:33] keep looking at ourselves and yes the
[40:36] Bible said examine yourself to see
[40:37] whether you be in the faith but when you
[40:39] find yourself not in the faith all
[40:41] you've got to ask God for is forgiveness
[40:44] and restoration hallelujah because not
[40:49] one man have ever stayed with the word
[40:53] like they should hallelujah when the
[40:57] book of redemption was open when those
[40:59] seven seals were opened by God's grace
[41:02] amen
[41:03] it revealed God's purpose his plan and
[41:08] his victory for all of us
[41:13] Tom by going to a new city you must
[41:17] become that new city before you go to
[41:19] the new city hallelujah you are really
[41:23] miss Teresa lung hallelujah a city of
[41:27] what peace hallelujah and if you
[41:31] represents peace you must reflect peace
[41:35] that right hallelujah
[41:39] Jerusalem was conquered by David and his
[41:42] band they gave Jerusalem a new name and
[41:47] the only way that you can ever receive
[41:51] that name is that you must be conquered
[41:53] by David not a David D David the God
[41:58] that was behind David Jesus Christ
[42:01] Himself the son of David
[42:04] hallelujah who have known the mind of
[42:08] the Lord and you and I must understand
[42:10] we don't understand why we go through
[42:11] all these things but understand we go
[42:16] through these things for a divine
[42:17] purpose the Bible said we were created
[42:21] for his pleasure and his will hallelujah
[42:25] my brother ever said that if you please
[42:27] God for him for God to send him to hell
[42:29] he won't God to do what's going to
[42:31] please him now you got to have a great
[42:34] low level of love and understanding
[42:38] hallelujah to say that cause when you
[42:40] say that you realize there is no way
[42:42] that you can go
[42:44] but if that's what he would choose for
[42:47] me so be it
[42:50] hallelujah ah you won't be able to
[42:53] change it anyway
[42:55] ha little come on somebody you must
[42:58] understand that even in this day what
[43:02] you do doesn't change the fact of who
[43:05] you are and where you're headed Oh
[43:09] somebody help me here you see I ain't
[43:12] trying to be saved because I was saved
[43:15] before the foundation of the world so
[43:19] were you and if I was saved and you were
[43:22] say before the foundation of the world
[43:24] what is the problem the problem is that
[43:29] we got mental situation here God is
[43:36] either God or he's not God Jesus Christ
[43:40] is either God or he's not God is that
[43:43] right God told a brother Barry said
[43:46] listen Jehovah of the Old Testament is
[43:50] Jesus Christ of the new how many I
[43:53] believe that oh I believe that then
[43:57] whatever Jesus Christ did in the Old
[43:59] Testament he can do it again because
[44:03] Hebrews 13 and eight said that Jesus
[44:06] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[44:08] forever did you know that even in the
[44:14] Old Testament people were being healed
[44:17] hallelujah is that right look at the
[44:21] leopard naman right dip seven times a
[44:28] leopard nobody put no oil on him that
[44:34] water didn't change him but obedience to
[44:38] the word Oh somebody help me here
[44:41] it was the obedience to the word that
[44:44] literally healed him and obedience to
[44:47] the word right now today works in the
[44:50] same way if you have faith you can say
[44:54] to a mountain be thou move
[44:57] hallelujah I don't care if you say Lord
[45:00] Jesus Christ I believe that I'm healed
[45:05] this moment and you never ever say or
[45:10] give a negative report after that God is
[45:15] obligated to heal you now I just got
[45:19] that off the tape God is obligated once
[45:22] you say Lord I believe this I ask of
[45:25] this I receive of this and you never
[45:27] give a negative report after that
[45:29] because that negative report will erase
[45:32] everything but when you hold fast that
[45:36] do the words that have been spoken
[45:38] there's an angel that must bring it to
[45:42] pass that's God's will that's God's Way
[45:45] and who's gonna change it they ask that
[45:49] man and I'm just going the way that God
[45:51] wants me to go they asked that man who
[45:54] did sin the man who was born blind
[45:55] thirty years never seen eyesight before
[46:00] now Mateus I'm let me let me let me say
[46:03] this to you if you've never seen before
[46:07] how can you have faith for something
[46:09] you've never seen you don't even know
[46:15] what light is you've never seen light
[46:18] you've never felt light you don't know
[46:22] what it is but God said you can have it
[46:25] somebody help me here you've never seen
[46:28] heaven you've never been you understand
[46:31] me
[46:31] in the natural but something tells you
[46:34] it exists and you have prayed to know
[46:38] that is yours
[46:39] it becomes yours Abraham looked for a
[46:42] city whose builder and maker was God
[46:45] never been there before but he knew he
[46:48] was going he knew it existed brother man
[46:51] said where where where where Abraham
[46:53] stopped he said the city was right above
[46:56] him hallelujah see what we don't
[47:02] understand is that this is what we call
[47:05] a faith gospel hallelujah we
[47:10] a faith civilization everything we do
[47:14] must come by faith my faith must be
[47:18] applied and faith is something that God
[47:21] gives you it's not hope it's beyond hope
[47:25] it's when hope has no hope Faye says
[47:29] it's possible faith still says it's mine
[47:32] it's not what the doctor say I wish I
[47:36] had been there I would say hey if there
[47:39] was a doctor
[47:40] let him go examine Lazarus hallelujah oh
[47:43] my you understand me a situation that
[47:47] seems out of control a situation that
[47:50] seemed like it was unrepairable
[47:56] but then jesus said it to Mary and
[47:59] Martha if you believe you'll see the
[48:02] resurrection somebody help me here you
[48:07] see ah you must understand once God set
[48:10] you free and Jesus Christ has set you
[48:12] free the devil has no right to
[48:15] reimprisonment Eve the slave driver who
[48:23] was the devil you do not have to go back
[48:26] ha because your Jubilee has sounded
[48:30] you're free and he whom the son have set
[48:33] free is free indeed think about it God
[48:37] allowed us all to be unbelievers at one
[48:40] time I love that not some of us all of
[48:45] us all of us were unbelievers and God
[48:51] did that so that he could show his mercy
[48:54] toward us oh I believe well if you
[48:58] believe is because of the mercies of God
[49:01] it's the grace of God that causes you to
[49:04] believe hallelujah
[49:06] I'm so glad that I'm saved
[49:13] who can know the mind of God did you not
[49:18] know all of us this morning was
[49:21] predestinated to be here before time
[49:27] God saw you here the very color dress
[49:30] and color pants the color everything God
[49:33] saw you here you was ordained to come
[49:36] here you was ordained to hear this
[49:39] hallelujah because God cares whoo Jesus
[49:44] help us Lord talk about a paradox I
[49:48] don't know why I believe other than he
[49:54] gave me the faith you understand me
[49:58] something holds me I don't hold it it
[50:02] holds me and it's unexplainable it
[50:08] wasn't that I was a good person I was
[50:11] just as wicked as everybody else maybe a
[50:14] little more exceedingly but God's mercy
[50:18] and grace family why God ordained you to
[50:24] see this message and others can't see it
[50:27] why can your eyes see this when others
[50:31] can't see it that's the mercy and grace
[50:35] of God I feel like shouting the thing
[50:41] that I love about this message because
[50:44] we realize by God's grace that we've got
[50:48] more of God coming you say well brother
[50:52] books the bride is already in our
[50:54] revival yeah but when the revival is
[50:58] over what comes next because revival
[51:02] means getting all the trash out God
[51:06] coming alone getting all the trash out
[51:08] of it I wanted to get everything don't
[51:10] leave a speck of darkness in me get
[51:13] everything out of me and when everything
[51:17] is gone he brings down that anointing
[51:19] whew
[51:21] then it's going home time
[51:25] but don't reject the anointing you know
[51:29] God's anointing is not always you know
[51:31] you got to feel the wind blow you ain't
[51:34] got to feel cheers all the time when God
[51:38] comes to anoint you
[51:39] it's just anoint you to do right huh
[51:43] when Jesus stood up there in that pulpit
[51:45] and he said this day this scripture is
[51:48] fulfilled
[51:49] he was so anointed because the presence
[51:53] of the Lord was not only over him but in
[51:56] him and when you get that anointing like
[51:59] that you don't run and jump there's
[52:01] something serious about it how old
[52:04] somebody help me hallelujah you and I
[52:10] must understand that God says and I read
[52:15] this last week I was out of Isaiah 30
[52:18] and 26
[52:20] moreover the light of the Moon shall be
[52:24] as the light of the Sun and the light of
[52:29] the Sun shall be Sevenfold you
[52:33] understand me how many fools do you have
[52:38] when the Bible says 7 oh that means that
[52:43] revelation of this message is supposed
[52:46] to cause a Sevenfold effect on the
[52:50] believer so what they did yesterday
[52:55] cannot be compared to what God wants to
[52:58] do today but we sitting back as if
[53:02] there's nothing for us to do when the
[53:06] whole creation is groaning and waiting
[53:11] for the manifestations of God but God is
[53:15] looking for somebody with a made of mine
[53:22] Sevenfold light of seven days in the day
[53:27] that the Lord binded up the breach of
[53:29] his people is that right we're still
[53:31] living in that day where the bridge have
[53:34] been bind
[53:36] is that right with that lamb took the
[53:38] book somebody help me here when the lamb
[53:42] took the book when that when that it
[53:44] came to a place it was a matter of life
[53:47] and death because no man was fine worthy
[53:51] that bloody lamb he came and took the
[53:55] book out of the right hand of him that
[53:57] said on the phone it was at that time
[53:59] the breach came back together man and
[54:03] God became one again that's why Jesus
[54:06] could pray father I would that may be
[54:09] one even as we are one did you know the
[54:14] Bible says if all the miracles that
[54:18] Jesus wrought on earth would not be
[54:22] contained in a book he did too many
[54:25] things you understand me
[54:28] and likewise if he's the same today as
[54:31] he was yesterday
[54:32] God is still doing things hallelujah is
[54:36] that all right now I'm bringing this to
[54:39] you because I just believed not only
[54:41] just in a supernatural God but I believe
[54:44] in a supernatural people who's being
[54:47] formed into the very image and likeness
[54:50] of God hallelujah God
[54:53] interested in your failures as I was
[54:57] with Moses he says Moses I'm not
[55:00] concerned that your failures I'm looking
[55:02] at your commission and you and I must
[55:04] understand God ain't looking at your
[55:06] failures he's looking at your commission
[55:09] at the Commission and the bride supposed
[55:11] to be bone of his bone and flesh of his
[55:13] flesh there is a work to do but we must
[55:18] wake up come out of this dust that we've
[55:21] been laying in shake yourself realize
[55:25] that who you are hallelujah you either
[55:29] born of God or you're not born of God
[55:32] you either up God or you're not of God
[55:34] you must say who you are you must
[55:38] recognize that that's who I am you know
[55:41] what do you mean one thing I say I love
[55:44] Samson
[55:44] you hear me call him and say things
[55:47] about him all the time because
[55:49] to remind me him I'm Neal he reminds me
[55:53] of me yeah
[55:59] and you come to that place in your life
[56:01] and you say Oh Lord once more well how
[56:05] would he say Oh Lord once more if he
[56:07] didn't know who he was he was among the
[56:10] Philistines was Samson knew he was a
[56:13] Nazarite he understood he was chosen of
[56:16] God but look at Samson he looked like a
[56:19] wreck he was a mess everything God told
[56:23] him to do he failed at it
[56:25] hallelujah all he had was history I
[56:28] remember we in God don't know God wants
[56:31] you to be Jesus today hallelujah is that
[56:35] right
[56:36] God want us to be Jesus today Jesus
[56:39] yesterday K help you Jesus today is that
[56:44] right we can look in the past at all
[56:46] that's what he used to do oh that's what
[56:49] he's gonna do in the future but he won't
[56:51] let Jesus today that's what this message
[56:54] is about when the prophet of God was
[56:57] here he was the Jesus of that day
[57:00] somebody help me here not just him there
[57:03] were other believers who reflected Jesus
[57:07] Christ in a man in their right mind know
[57:12] that we don't have the power to do
[57:13] nothing but all power in heaven and
[57:20] earth is given to Jesus Christ
[57:21] hallelujah
[57:23] are you the body you know I think
[57:26] sometimes we like I said we let these
[57:29] feelings get in our way
[57:31] uh-huh oh god don't worry about that he
[57:35] worked with faith faith and feelings are
[57:38] two different things two worlds apart
[57:41] you understand me feelings is a
[57:44] scientific hallelujah that's what the
[57:49] scientific church worked with hallelujah
[57:51] but the church that is born of God she
[57:56] only moved by faith in God am I making
[58:00] sense
[58:02] you and I must understand that this word
[58:04] come to transform us and I don't know
[58:07] about you but I look for changes every
[58:09] day I get discouraged when I don't see
[58:12] changes in me positive changes moving
[58:16] closer to God hearing God's voice more
[58:19] often you understand me
[58:21] being able to talk with him and he talks
[58:24] back to me now I don't know whether
[58:26] y'all experience those things but he's
[58:27] real God talks back did you know that
[58:31] hallelujah
[58:32] it ain't just your mind sometimes your
[58:35] mind can't even come up with that good
[58:36] stuff like that God talks is this okay
[58:43] give me a few more minutes you and I
[58:46] must understand that the bride she's
[58:50] recognizing who she is
[58:52] little by little she's coming into play
[58:55] she's coming into her position now to be
[58:58] honest with you we should have been
[58:59] there long time ago but we got too many
[59:03] distractions we got too many worldly
[59:06] interests hallelujah but don't you
[59:10] understand God calls for a total
[59:13] separation from underneath oh I've got
[59:17] some good quotes but I better move on my
[59:19] point is sometimes you have to move on
[59:24] and say bye-bye
[59:26] to even friends in order to do the
[59:33] perfect will of God there's a transition
[59:39] Rebecca had to say mama I'll see you
[59:43] later daddy I'll see you later brother
[59:47] sister I'll see you later I'm going to
[59:51] meet the king she had to separate why
[59:54] they wanted her to stay you can't stay
[59:58] in one place when God calls you got to
[1:00:01] move hallelujah you've got to move you
[1:00:05] got to go forward because I'm going to
[1:00:07] tell you something you you you you until
[1:00:09] you circumcised away everything that's
[1:00:13] not like God he cannot
[1:00:21] John the Baptist had to do it Jesus had
[1:00:26] to do it brother Branham had to do it
[1:00:29] and you got to do it
[1:00:31] we all must separate ourselves you love
[1:00:36] the Lord it's a transition because you
[1:00:40] must realize that that book of
[1:00:41] Revelation 21 9 the Word of God says I
[1:00:45] will show you the the bride the Lambs
[1:00:47] wife so she transitioned she's not she
[1:00:52] changes from bride into wife you can't
[1:00:56] just Phaedra I'm the bride no there's
[1:00:58] got to be a transition there's gotta be
[1:01:01] a marital affair there's gotta be an
[1:01:04] invisible union between you and God you
[1:01:08] in Christ
[1:01:09] oh yes the great ceremony will be
[1:01:12] celebrated in heaven but there is an
[1:01:14] invisible union right now between Christ
[1:01:18] and the believer and God will not be
[1:01:23] unequally yoked love the Lord just give
[1:01:29] me a few more minutes you and I must
[1:01:32] realized that the pressure is on God is
[1:01:35] expecting things out of you hallelujah
[1:01:40] God is expecting things out of you and
[1:01:44] guess what you can't even do what he's
[1:01:47] expecting you to do and the thing about
[1:01:51] it is he didn't ask you to do it he
[1:01:57] promised he would do it
[1:02:00] he that begun the good work in you he is
[1:02:04] faithful to completing but if you don't
[1:02:07] trust a word what's gonna happen to you
[1:02:09] you're not gonna be happy you're gonna
[1:02:10] be sad because oh you're trying to work
[1:02:13] it out Jesus on already worked it out
[1:02:16] the Bible says that the glory of this
[1:02:19] latter house shall be greater than of
[1:02:21] the former you know that was the longest
[1:02:23] that was the reason why didn't get saved
[1:02:24] at the beginning when my mom would say
[1:02:26] come on go to church come on big you
[1:02:28] know Christ and got another but you know
[1:02:30] what I cuz in my mind I thought I had to
[1:02:32] do it I thought I had to stop this stop
[1:02:35] that stop this stop that and I didn't it
[1:02:38] quit me when I made up my mind to serve
[1:02:42] the Lord Jesus it quit me y'all hear me
[1:02:47] I don't get a lot of emails on that one
[1:02:50] but it's the truth the prophet of God
[1:02:52] said you don't have to quit nothin
[1:02:54] if you eat and you read and you pray it
[1:02:57] will quit you if you resist the devil he
[1:03:01] will flee from you the devil don't want
[1:03:04] to be around you if you came manifesting
[1:03:07] y'all know that's the truth if you said
[1:03:11] hey I try to tell people you don't need
[1:03:12] the Holy Ghost to quit smoking you don't
[1:03:15] need the Holy Ghost to kick quit

[1:03:30] gonna do what I wanted to do what is an
[1:03:33] alcoholic demon or a cigarette Dean come
[1:03:35] on

[1:03:36] smoking but you know what the devil do
[1:03:38] he'll put them out there in the cold
[1:03:40] cold weather on the side of the building
[1:03:45] and they go like they so enjoying it
[1:03:51] what is that demon that was to be seen
[1:03:57] hallelujah
[1:03:58] oh the man walking down the street
[1:04:00] whatever he's doing it's a demon in him
[1:04:03] that makes he you know right and if a
[1:04:07] demon wants to be seen what about the
[1:04:09] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost wants to be
[1:04:14] Sene he wants to be on display you can
[1:04:19] call it the token of your life but he
[1:04:21] wants to be on display he wants the
[1:04:24] world to see you as the redeemed that
[1:04:30] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:04:32] and forever he wants to be singing
[1:04:35] Hallelujah is that Alright come on
[1:04:40] somebody I will keep saying that I
[1:04:42] believe that a person if you really want
[1:04:45] to quit
[1:04:46] you gotta want to quit and when you want
[1:04:52] to quit in God see that your mind is
[1:04:55] made up
[1:04:56] he will then come in and do it but you
[1:04:59] can't fake it when it comes to God
[1:05:01] hallelujah
[1:05:03] the moment you say this is gonna be my
[1:05:05] last drink

[1:05:17] compromised when you say Lord I'm not
[1:05:19] gonna do it that's it you don't go back
[1:05:22] oh come on didn't I tell you the
[1:05:27] universe and everything is united is
[1:05:29] that the truth did you not know that
[1:05:32] even the Prophet says when he was ready
[1:05:35] to cast out Devils according to whatever

[1:08:32] gonna give it to you you gotta wait some
[1:08:36] time but is yours
[1:08:41] hallelujah understand you didn't bring
[1:08:47] yourself to God God called you and some
[1:08:50] of us who've been raised in the message
[1:08:52] you just raised in the message until God
[1:08:54] called you that's what made the
[1:08:57] difference cause you was in there but
[1:08:59] you didn't can feel the call like
[1:09:00] everybody else
[1:09:01] oh I'm raised in the message what that
[1:09:02] means until God put a desire in your
[1:09:07] heart you were just raised in the
[1:09:09] message but God has to put something in
[1:09:13] yo huh and then we put that in your
[1:09:17] heart you call
[1:09:18] it's an assurance you elected and now
[1:09:22] God is gonna do great things for you I
[1:09:25] know you said what brother what are you
[1:09:27] saying I'm so thankful that the seed
[1:09:30] that I have in me is incorruptible
[1:09:34] hallelujah it cannot be corrupted what
[1:09:38] are you saying brother Brooks oh yes
[1:09:40] listen because we do bad things we have
[1:09:44] bad little habits doesn't mean we're not
[1:09:46] saved oh that's the truth remember the
[1:09:51] preacher who died and I call it brother
[1:09:54] Baron said he was their God spanked him
[1:09:57] and put him to sleep right so God don't
[1:10:01] lose one but you see when I get there
[1:10:05] hallelujah whatever will walk that is
[1:10:07] and that look chest I want something I
[1:10:12] want some rewards
[1:10:14] I want to be able to go in there and
[1:10:16] find all kinds of stuff that God then
[1:10:18] gave me I don't want to just go through
[1:10:19] a big old chest and all I could find is
[1:10:21] one thing big ole chance and you ain't
[1:10:27] got number one reward in there huh y'all
[1:10:30] did y'all know that everybody's gonna
[1:10:33] receive different rewards everybody's
[1:10:38] going to receive different rewards some
[1:10:42] gonna receive more than others because
[1:10:45] some worked harder than others some did
[1:10:48] more than others
[1:10:50] somebody help me here hallelujah
[1:10:54] one brother said at least give me a
[1:10:56] crown so I could throw it at his feet
[1:11:01] hallelujah give me something to the
[1:11:03] heart that I can say God because of your
[1:11:05] grace and your mercy is that right your
[1:11:09] grace and mercy brought me through is
[1:11:12] that right that's all we'd be able to
[1:11:15] see how God I've got a lot of stuff here
[1:11:19] but by God's grace trying to find
[1:11:22] something here I want to be totally
[1:11:27] transformed and I'm closing on these
[1:11:30] thoughts now if God saw a world that was
[1:11:36] void without shade you and I don't have
[1:11:41] no idea what that was like before God
[1:11:44] moved upon the water and before he spoke
[1:11:46] and said let there be light
[1:11:47] we have no idea I edges probably was a
[1:11:51] catastrophic mess everything was
[1:11:55] rearranged y'all believe that if you
[1:11:59] don't look around the world is void is
[1:12:04] out of cadence it darkness cover the
[1:12:08] whole place you understand me
[1:12:11] upon the waters the people look at him
[1:12:13] look at him look at him they look like
[1:12:15] creatures of the dark of the night is
[1:12:18] that right oh come on did you go down
[1:12:21] into the ocean where there is no light
[1:12:22] and bring up a fish and it looked like
[1:12:24] something from another planet why
[1:12:29] because there is no light to transform
[1:12:31] it you know what perhaps before the fall
[1:12:34] it looked differently because remember
[1:12:39] cactus is only came by the fall the way
[1:12:43] we see cactus was not the way it was it
[1:12:47] was after the curse thorns and thistles
[1:12:49] came into existence bro Isaiah said that
[1:12:55] they're coming a day that even the
[1:12:56] deserts have blue God at the rising of
[1:13:01] the Sun is going to cause all
[1:13:04] those things that have been perverted by
[1:13:06] the darkness to change oh I'm coming to
[1:13:10] something God want to transform us from
[1:13:14] a tadpole right
[1:13:19] you know tadpoles are transformations
[1:13:22] they start off like a little fish then
[1:13:26] the tail drops off then they grow legs
[1:13:29] yeah the tap one might be a bad example
[1:13:31] for some of us cuz I ain't calling
[1:13:33] nobody a frog but let's go to them to
[1:13:37] the world right to the butterfly what a
[1:13:41] transformation
[1:13:44] hallelujah but when that butterfly is
[1:13:47] transformed from that worm they look
[1:13:49] nothing alike and God wants that kind of
[1:13:54] transformation in us that the Holy Ghost
[1:13:57] can change you so much
[1:13:59] till you look nothing like you used to
[1:14:05] even the world can see you've been
[1:14:07] transformed
[1:14:10] Alleluia hey that right I'm gonna read
[1:14:17] this quote in I'm a clothes for this so
[1:14:19] and pick it up this evening because
[1:14:24] we'll be chewing on this for a little
[1:14:25] while because I won't understand that
[1:14:28] the that Aaron's rod bloomed I used to
[1:14:35] wonder for years how did that Manor stay
[1:14:38] fresh in the Holies of Holies I did not
[1:14:47] understand it for a long time until I
[1:14:49] heard brother Brown say because of the
[1:14:50] Shekinah glory was always there you
[1:14:55] understand me
[1:14:56] it took a day rod don't tell me you in
[1:14:58] the challenge that kind of glory and
[1:15:00] there are no changes when you in the
[1:15:03] Shekinah glory there must be changes and
[1:15:06] these changes comes by the Shekinah
[1:15:08] glory and not just the stick you
[1:15:11] understand me
[1:15:13] it wasn't the rod that changed itself it
[1:15:15] was where that rod was playing
[1:15:18] behind the veil behind the curtain when
[1:15:21] you are behind the curtain of God amen
[1:15:24] your life will change and the prophet of
[1:15:29] God said that's the greatest of all
[1:15:30] mysteries God warning us back behind
[1:15:33] that veil into the shikhandi said we
[1:15:36] should live in as a kind of everyday
[1:15:38] everyday he loved the Lord you're
[1:15:43] brought with a price and you're not your
[1:15:44] own right that's why the Bible said
[1:15:48] therefore glorify God in your body and
[1:15:50] in your spirit which are gods now you
[1:15:54] and I must understand that God owns us
[1:15:57] I'm so glad he bought me I'm so glad he
[1:16:03] bought me I don't have when you buy
[1:16:06] something you got it in your house you
[1:16:07] don't have to worry about that thing
[1:16:09] you'll sit there that little job
[1:16:11] whatever fly it you know you don't take
[1:16:13] it doesn't take care of itself
[1:16:15] the owner take care of it when I want to
[1:16:18] come and see that that look that Jah got
[1:16:20] a little dust on a tea dust is it
[1:16:24] hallelujah
[1:16:25] we're not only season that John needs
[1:16:27] some washing or whatever it the owner
[1:16:29] washes it that's how I am when dust gets
[1:16:34] on me he dust me off when I get dirty he
[1:16:38] washes me you understand me it's all
[1:16:42] God's doing and I'm so glad about it God
[1:16:47] has called you but what God is what is
[1:16:52] God doing transforming you from what you
[1:16:55] was maybe a daughter or son whatever it
[1:16:58] is from a lovely family sometimes places
[1:17:02] you somewhere else because it's his way
[1:17:05] of doing it see by the renewing of your
[1:17:08] mind to obey the Word of God regardless
[1:17:12] of what the price is our redeemed
[1:17:18] emption wasn't a cheap thing it
[1:17:25] the son of God had to die for us things
[1:17:32] of value comes of great price we can't
[1:17:39] handle rose a message like his cheap it
[1:17:42] took a lot the price was great the value
[1:17:49] of it amen
[1:17:51] we can't even put a value on it because
[1:17:55] it's priceless and you and I must
[1:17:59] realize because of this message we
[1:18:01] cannot allow this message to look like
[1:18:04] some denominational thing it's priceless
[1:18:07] this is the word and the Word of God
[1:18:10] will not come back void won't do it
[1:18:15] can't happen God's will will be done in
