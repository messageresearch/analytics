[42:34] oh
[42:35] [Music]
[42:42] [Music]
[42:57] up
[43:01] [Music]
[43:24] heaven
[43:30] [Music]
[43:53] let us open our bibles
[43:56] to the book of genesis in chapter one
[43:59] read from verse one
[44:02] amen
[44:10] genesis in chapter 1
[44:15] in the beginning god created the heaven
[44:17] and the earth
[44:19] and the earth was without form and void
[44:22] and darkness was upon the face of the
[44:24] deep and the spirit of god moved upon
[44:26] the face of the waters
[44:28] and god said let there be light
[44:31] and there was light amen may the lord
[44:33] add blessings to the reading of his word
[44:34] we might take our seeds
[44:38] whilst we're there if we can open our
[44:40] bible to the book of john chapter one
[44:42] and verse one
[44:45] the bible says in the beginning was the
[44:48] word
[44:49] and the word was with god and the word
[44:52] was god
[44:54] the same was in the beginning with god
[44:58] all these things were made by him and
[45:00] without him was not
[45:02] anything made that was made
[45:04] even in the
[45:05] scriptures that we read
[45:07] it is telling us god
[45:09] created the heaven and the earth but he
[45:11] did this creation with the spoken word
[45:15] by speaking the word
[45:17] he says let there be light and there was
[45:20] light
[45:21] amen
[45:23] so for a short time this evening i want
[45:25] to speak on
[45:26] this title recognizing the authority of
[45:29] the word amen amen
[45:32] and here we see that
[45:35] it does not matter
[45:37] what the universe looks like
[45:39] it doesn't didn't matter what it looked
[45:41] like but when god spoke that word
[45:45] that word had no option but to make sure
[45:47] that things were created
[45:49] amen
[45:52] he created everything by the spoken word
[45:56] so we see that
[45:58] the word carries any word carries the
[46:01] same authority as the person who speaks
[46:03] it that's right
[46:05] if you hear someone sends you and they
[46:07] say
[46:08] go do this the first thing you ask you
[46:10] say
[46:11] who's who say that
[46:13] depending on who said that word will
[46:15] determine how quickly you will do it
[46:18] because you attach the authority that
[46:20] the word has to the person who is spoken
[46:23] at amen but here we see that it was the
[46:25] almighty god who was speaking amen the
[46:28] almighty god with all power so when he
[46:30] spoke
[46:32] that word had the same authority as god
[46:34] himself amen amen and the prophet uh he
[46:38] talks to us about how the earth was
[46:40] created about how
[46:42] there was an explosion
[46:44] out of the sun and all the planets were
[46:46] formed that was just
[46:48] because god had spoken
[46:50] everything came from the word amen amen
[46:53] today if
[46:54] president biden say something
[46:57] and say something into law
[46:59] all the law enforcement agencies
[47:02] have to enforce that
[47:04] why because he has the authority amen
[47:07] when a man of no authority says the
[47:10] exact same thing it has different value
[47:13] because you attach that to say the
[47:15] president has said this amen so
[47:18] all the policemen all the law in face
[47:21] all the law enforcement agencies have to
[47:24] act on that word to make sure that word
[47:26] comes to pass to make sure that law is
[47:29] followed why because it's the president
[47:31] who has said so
[47:33] if p if law enforcement can do that to
[47:36] the prayer to the word of the president
[47:39] what more about the word of god
[47:41] amen when god speaks the prophet tells
[47:44] us that the holy ghost is the enforcer
[47:47] amen in isaiah the bible says that
[47:50] so my word shall
[47:52] be that god fought out of my mouth
[47:55] it shall not return unto me void but
[47:58] after it has accomplished that which he
[48:00] has spoken
[48:01] amen we know when herod ordered the
[48:04] killing of all those babies who were two
[48:06] years and under the soldiers had to go
[48:08] do it it did not matter how much of an
[48:11] atrocious act that was
[48:13] they did that because they were carrying
[48:14] the king's orders they were carrying the
[48:17] king's command amen but we know we have
[48:20] a greater king the king jesus christ
[48:24] when he speaks a word
[48:26] oh heaven has to back it up the prophet
[48:29] of god tells us that god is willing to
[48:31] make heaven bankrupt before his word
[48:34] fails because he has a reputation
[48:37] that my word never fails amen
[48:41] so when he spoke and said let there be
[48:45] all the elements had to move
[48:47] everything had to fall into place the
[48:50] grand canyon was created mount everest
[48:53] was created by that word let there be
[48:57] because it was god almighty god who was
[49:00] speaking so everything was created by
[49:02] the word of his mouth
[49:04] everything was created by the spoken
[49:07] word amen
[49:08] so the word is
[49:09] was responsible for every valley every
[49:13] mountain
[49:14] every nature everything of nature that
[49:16] we admire today
[49:18] because it was god who had spoken that
[49:20] word
[49:21] and that word is the same as god himself
[49:25] because in john chapter one he says in
[49:27] the beginning was the word and the word
[49:31] was with god and the word was god so the
[49:35] word that god speaks
[49:37] is as good as god himself
[49:39] when we look at the bible and we read
[49:42] the word of god it is the same it has
[49:45] the same authority as god himself that's
[49:47] why we stand upon the word amen amen
[49:51] so isaiah tells us that
[49:52] his word never goes back to him void but
[49:55] after it is accomplished that which he
[49:58] has spoken it for amen so when god
[50:01] speaks when he says let there be that
[50:04] word couldn't get back to him until
[50:06] light was there
[50:07] until he had created all those trees to
[50:10] come up
[50:11] that word could not go back to him until
[50:14] he had spoken about it amen
[50:16] so if
[50:18] nature can respond to the word of god
[50:20] like that
[50:21] what more about you and me
[50:23] sons and daughters of god
[50:25] created in the image of god amen
[50:28] when you look at each and every
[50:30] scripture in the bible when you listen
[50:33] to each and every word of god
[50:35] you know that that will never return to
[50:37] god void
[50:38] it will only go back after it has
[50:40] accomplished that which he has promised
[50:42] amen
[50:44] we know
[50:46] of abraham
[50:48] he was given a promise that he was going
[50:50] to give birth he and his wife they were
[50:52] they were of age
[50:54] it did not make sense
[50:56] that all the people were going to give
[50:58] birth to a son
[51:00] but they did not abraham believed it
[51:02] anyways
[51:03] because he believed the word of god he
[51:06] knew that the word of god would not
[51:08] return unto him void but after that
[51:11] promise was had come to pass
[51:13] so he didn't care he didn't look at his
[51:15] infirmities he didn't look at the
[51:17] barrenness of sarah he looked at the
[51:20] word
[51:20] so that word was responsible for
[51:24] transforming abraham
[51:26] that word was responsible for
[51:28] transforming sarah
[51:30] because
[51:31] that was god's promise
[51:33] so when you look at the promise of god
[51:35] don't care what the situation looks like
[51:38] it's not
[51:39] up to me or i shouldn't worry how that's
[51:41] going to happen that word is responsible
[51:44] itself to make it come to pass
[51:47] that word is responsible to condition
[51:50] you to be able to receive your promise
[51:53] there are so many unclaimed promises in
[51:55] the bible but if you stand upon the word
[51:58] and you believe it it will happen
[52:02] you see believing is the atmosphere
[52:05] where the impossibilities are changed to
[52:07] possibilities
[52:09] believing is that atmosphere where faith
[52:12] can work
[52:14] you know when you have a chicken and um
[52:16] when it lays its eggs that egg will
[52:19] never hatch until it's under a certain
[52:22] atmosphere a certain temperature that is
[52:25] what will make it uh
[52:28] will make that egg to hatch
[52:30] believing is the same atmosphere that
[52:34] faith works in so the word of god is of
[52:36] no effect to you until you believe it
[52:39] so you better keep that atmosphere
[52:42] around you the angel of the lord
[52:44] gave the prophet he always had this a
[52:46] theme only believe all things are
[52:49] possible that was the theme of his uh
[52:52] revival meetings why because when you
[52:54] believe all things are possible why
[52:57] because you are believing in the word of
[52:59] god and the word of god never fails amen
[53:02] it's in that atmosphere when you believe
[53:04] that lay men walk
[53:06] blind eyes are open
[53:08] cancers disappear
[53:10] tuberculosis is healed the dead people
[53:13] are raised
[53:14] why because you are in that atmosphere
[53:16] of believing
[53:18] amen
[53:19] so we better look at god's promises each
[53:22] and every one of them claim them for
[53:25] yourselves there are so many unclaimed
[53:27] promises in the bible that you ought to
[53:29] go and claim and say this is mine it
[53:32] applies to me
[53:35] many times we get jealous of one another
[53:37] you get jealous over one brother who has
[53:40] claimed the promises for himself but do
[53:42] you know
[53:44] when you get jealous
[53:46] you're getting mad at god to say what
[53:48] you did for that person you cannot do it
[53:50] for me
[53:52] you think god does not have enough
[53:53] blessings to give each and every one of
[53:55] you amen but have you ever seen those
[53:58] little kids after service when brother
[54:00] brooks goes to the office
[54:02] when you give
[54:03] one kid
[54:04] candy
[54:05] and they go to show the other ones
[54:07] they're not gonna start fighting for it
[54:09] to ask where did you get it
[54:12] then you see all of them running into
[54:14] the office because they know where the
[54:16] candy came from there is a lot of them
[54:18] they will start rejoicing you see smiles
[54:21] on their faces because they know
[54:22] wherever this candy came from there is a
[54:25] lot of them so when you see your brother
[54:27] being blessed start rejoicing because
[54:30] you know you are next in line amen
[54:32] hallelujah so take each and every one of
[54:35] his promises
[54:36] stand upon it and you know it will come
[54:39] your way you see another brother
[54:41] claiming their promise know that that is
[54:43] evidence that that can happen to you too
[54:46] so you are supposed to rejoice stand on
[54:48] the word of god and believe that it will
[54:50] happen to you too
[54:52] hey man when you see your brother healed
[54:55] start rejoicing and you say my healing
[54:57] i'm next in line hey man because when
[55:00] the angel is in the neighborhood he is
[55:02] coming right next to your door to give
[55:04] you your healing to give you the desires
[55:07] of your heart amen
[55:10] so we know we are not supposed to
[55:12] diminish god because when you get
[55:14] jealous you're making god of a lesser
[55:16] value you're diminishing him you are
[55:18] saying lord you are not able to do this
[55:21] again
[55:23] but we got to know that look into the
[55:25] scriptures
[55:26] claim each and every one of the promises
[55:29] that god gave to us
[55:31] and he will come he will come through he
[55:34] will come through for you whenever you
[55:36] need him amen
[55:39] the word of god has authority
[55:42] when god speaks
[55:44] everything has to happen
[55:46] god has a reputation of not failing
[55:50] so you can call him on his word you know
[55:53] how god feels when you don't believe him
[55:57] many times we hop onto planes
[56:00] before you get onto a plane you don't
[56:01] ask
[56:02] who's the pilot can i see his resume how
[56:05] many flights have you flown you don't
[56:08] even know you just go in there you
[56:09] believe them
[56:11] you believe in a man you don't even see
[56:13] but you fail to believe god who has
[56:15] proved his word over and over again
[56:19] probably the pilot is even sleeping you
[56:21] don't even know but you know i'll get
[56:23] there safe
[56:25] what more about god
[56:26] god has never failed he has never failed
[56:29] to heal
[56:30] i dare you to come and bring one promise
[56:33] of god that has never come to pass
[56:36] so if you take god in his word
[56:38] you believe him
[56:40] he will make it come to pass in your
[56:42] life
[56:44] many relationships fail i was looking it
[56:46] up the number one issue why
[56:48] relationships fail is because there is
[56:50] no trust
[56:53] when you tell
[56:54] someone that
[56:55] you are lying they say
[56:57] you don't believe me
[56:59] that's a heartbreak that's a hot
[57:01] that's heart shattering right there
[57:03] so when you don't believe god he has
[57:05] that same reaction amen my son does not
[57:08] even believe me
[57:10] my daughter does not even believe me you
[57:12] are not believing god to heal you
[57:15] you are not believing god to take you
[57:17] out of that trial
[57:19] but he is more than able amen
[57:22] god is able
[57:24] more than able to do what he said he
[57:26] will do in his word
[57:28] and you need
[57:29] that ear of faith that makes you hear
[57:32] that word
[57:34] because when you don't have faith
[57:36] you're not going to recognize the
[57:37] authority that's in the word so you need
[57:40] ears of faith you got to pray for that
[57:43] revelation the prophet of god says faith
[57:45] is a revelation so when you have that
[57:48] faith and you listen to the word of god
[57:50] god will reveal to you the authority
[57:53] that's in the word and you will know
[57:55] that this is able to come to pass so
[57:57] whenever you see any of god's promises
[57:59] you know that this will happen in my
[58:01] life
[58:02] when you see the scripture that says the
[58:04] angels of the lord in campus around them
[58:07] that believe the lord
[58:08] you know that wherever you go
[58:10] god has a hatch of protection around you
[58:13] you know that satan cannot touch you
[58:15] unless god allows it to come and when
[58:18] god allows it to come he knows that
[58:20] that's a show of victory
[58:22] i heard the story of this one sister
[58:25] she used to walk from church uh every
[58:28] wednesday night after service and she
[58:30] was walking on this dangerous there was
[58:32] this dangerous bridge where everyone who
[58:35] walked on that street or on that bridge
[58:37] who crossed that bridge always got
[58:39] robbed or got murdered but she was going
[58:42] for years and nothing was happening to
[58:44] her
[58:46] then some men those robbers decided to
[58:49] ask her they confronted they said
[58:53] people were asking her friends actually
[58:54] her friends were asking they say why do
[58:56] you never get robbed she says i don't
[58:58] know i just walk then those robbers came
[59:01] to confront and they asked he says who
[59:04] is the man that you're always walking
[59:05] with when you cross that bridge
[59:07] she says i'm walking by myself they say
[59:10] is no
[59:11] every time you are walking there is a
[59:13] huge giant that's walking right next to
[59:16] you she says i don't know about that
[59:17] i'll be by myself what was that that was
[59:20] an angel why because she was believing
[59:23] she was standing on the promises of the
[59:25] word of god when you stand on the
[59:27] promises of the word of god he is always
[59:30] able to make it come true for you amen
[59:32] so you know you have a hedge of
[59:34] protection around you
[59:35] satan cannot touch you unless god allows
[59:38] it stand on the promises of god because
[59:41] that word has
[59:43] authority
[59:44] to heal authority to deliver authority
[59:48] to break chains amen
[59:51] if we open our bibles to the book of um
[59:53] luke chapter five and verse one
[59:57] the bible
[59:58] says
[1:00:00] now when he had left speaking he said
[1:00:02] unto simon
[1:00:04] launch into the deep and let down your
[1:00:06] net for a draw
[1:00:07] and someone answering said unto him
[1:00:09] master we have toiled all night and have
[1:00:12] taken nothing nevertheless at thy word i
[1:00:16] would let down the net you see peter
[1:00:19] simon he was still simon he didn't even
[1:00:21] know who jesus was
[1:00:23] but when jesus came there and said you
[1:00:26] drop your nets
[1:00:27] he realized that this man was speaking
[1:00:29] with authority
[1:00:31] amen
[1:00:33] the prophet of god says well the
[1:00:35] apostles said lord we have fished all
[1:00:37] night we are fishermen
[1:00:40] we are fishermen we know our business
[1:00:42] and there's just simply no fish out
[1:00:44] there he says i would imagine he would
[1:00:47] say in his heart now we fish through
[1:00:49] these waters and we know there's no fish
[1:00:52] there you see
[1:00:53] peter and them that was their business
[1:00:57] fishing that was their occupation he
[1:00:59] would have said i know the position of
[1:01:02] the moon when the moon is at such and
[1:01:04] such a position you will never catch any
[1:01:06] fish but when god jesus walked right
[1:01:09] there and says
[1:01:10] throw your net right there you see the
[1:01:13] bible says he says
[1:01:16] simon answering said unto him master we
[1:01:18] have toiled all night and have taken
[1:01:20] nothing but nevertheless
[1:01:22] at thy word i would let down the net he
[1:01:25] recognized the authority that was in the
[1:01:27] man who was speaking and he said i don't
[1:01:30] care how much i've tried to fish all
[1:01:32] night and i didn't find anything let me
[1:01:34] try what this man of authority is saying
[1:01:37] and he says and when they had done this
[1:01:40] they enclosed a great multitude of fish
[1:01:43] and their nets break and they beckoned
[1:01:45] onto their partners you see their nets
[1:01:48] broke which means they had never come
[1:01:50] across they never had such pressure
[1:01:52] before but they had such a yield because
[1:01:55] they listened to the word of god
[1:01:58] they listened to jesus he realized i'm
[1:02:01] listening to a man of authority so if i
[1:02:03] listen to his word and act upon his word
[1:02:07] i know it will happen amen and he saw
[1:02:09] his nets their nets almost broke because
[1:02:13] he listened to almighty god hey man
[1:02:16] you see so it doesn't matter how much
[1:02:18] you've tried how much you have suffered
[1:02:21] how much you have tried all you can
[1:02:25] it doesn't mean that the word is not is
[1:02:26] going to fail you
[1:02:27] it doesn't matter everything you have
[1:02:29] tried go to the word there is a solution
[1:02:32] for you
[1:02:33] in thy word the prophet of god says now
[1:02:35] maybe you've gone went to every doctor
[1:02:38] in the city maybe you've come through
[1:02:40] every clinic every doctor's office maybe
[1:02:43] the man with honesty has exam examined
[1:02:46] you and said
[1:02:47] i don't know what's wrong with you and
[1:02:49] maybe he's found what's wrong with you
[1:02:51] and says it's not in medical realms to
[1:02:53] kill you but and there's nothing in the
[1:02:56] world that we can do for you
[1:02:58] and maybe you've gone through all the
[1:03:00] prayer lines you've done
[1:03:01] everything that you know to do you're
[1:03:03] still sick and getting worse
[1:03:05] why just like the apostles you say
[1:03:08] i don't know how it's going to happen
[1:03:10] but at that word lord i'm going to let
[1:03:12] down thy neck
[1:03:14] and thy word lord i'm going to let down
[1:03:17] that doubt
[1:03:18] if that word i'm going to believe amen
[1:03:20] it doesn't matter how much i've tried
[1:03:22] i'm going to lay down and believe with
[1:03:24] all my heart that you're going to heal
[1:03:26] me tonight and he says you will go away
[1:03:29] from here a very well person
[1:03:32] and thy word lord i'm going to let down
[1:03:35] the net that's a problem we have
[1:03:37] nowadays we are afraid to take god at
[1:03:40] his word
[1:03:41] you are thinking what if it don't work i
[1:03:44] have another opinion tonight what if it
[1:03:46] works
[1:03:47] just try him and he will never fail you
[1:03:50] amen
[1:03:51] all you have to do is recognize who is
[1:03:54] speaking if his word was able to create
[1:03:57] the whole earth then what is it what is
[1:03:59] that small sickness that he cannot heal
[1:04:02] what is that small affliction that he
[1:04:05] cannot deliver you out of
[1:04:07] what is that small depression that he
[1:04:09] cannot deliver you out of just go and
[1:04:12] look what is the word saying
[1:04:14] believe it that word has authority to
[1:04:16] bring you out of that problem it is the
[1:04:18] authority to bring you out of that
[1:04:20] situation
[1:04:22] let us open our bibles to the book of
[1:04:23] matthew chapter 8 verse five
[1:04:26] it says
[1:04:28] and when jesus was entered in into
[1:04:30] capital
[1:04:32] they came unto him a centurion
[1:04:34] beseeching him
[1:04:35] and saying lord my seventh light at home
[1:04:38] sick with the parsy
[1:04:40] grievously tormented and jesus said unto
[1:04:43] him i will come and heal him
[1:04:48] the centurion answered and said lord
[1:04:51] i am not worthy that thou should has
[1:04:53] come under my roof but speak the word
[1:04:56] only and my servant shall be healed
[1:04:59] this centurion recognized the man who
[1:05:02] jesus was
[1:05:03] he sold the track record of all the
[1:05:06] miracles that jesus had done and he knew
[1:05:09] that this is a man of authority he
[1:05:12] probably didn't know what kind of
[1:05:13] authority he had but he said i know if i
[1:05:16] go to him and he just speak the word
[1:05:19] my servant will be healed he says you
[1:05:21] don't even have to come to my house but
[1:05:23] just speak the word
[1:05:26] the next verse says
[1:05:27] for i am a man under authority
[1:05:30] having soldiers under me and i say to
[1:05:33] this man go and he goes and to another
[1:05:36] come and he coming and to my servant do
[1:05:38] this and he'd do with it
[1:05:40] i was baffled when i looked at the first
[1:05:42] line of verse nine he says for i am a
[1:05:45] man under authority and i tell all these
[1:05:48] people to do that he did not say for i
[1:05:51] am a man
[1:05:52] in authority or i'm a man of authority
[1:05:56] but he says i'm a man under authority so
[1:05:59] how does a man under authority have
[1:06:02] authority
[1:06:03] and i looked at this
[1:06:05] this man knew that he was under the
[1:06:08] authority of the roman government so he
[1:06:11] realized because he was under the
[1:06:13] authority of the roman government
[1:06:15] that gave him the authority
[1:06:18] to speak to his servants so
[1:06:21] when you are under the authority of god
[1:06:24] that gives you the authority to have
[1:06:27] power over every situation that's around
[1:06:29] you that gives you power over all the
[1:06:32] demons gives you power over each and
[1:06:35] everything why because you are under
[1:06:37] authority it is that supreme authority
[1:06:40] that gives you the authority that you
[1:06:42] have and jesus said unto the centurion
[1:06:45] in verse 13
[1:06:46] go thy way as thou has believed
[1:06:49] so be it unto thee and his servant was
[1:06:52] healed the ver in the self same hour why
[1:06:56] because he was a man who realized the
[1:06:58] authority of jesus he realized the
[1:07:02] authority of the word because jesus was
[1:07:04] a word walking on two feet
[1:07:07] he was the manifestation of a virgin
[1:07:09] shall conceive
[1:07:10] he was the manifestation of emmanuel all
[1:07:14] the prophecies that were they he was the
[1:07:16] word that was walking so he realized the
[1:07:19] authority that this man had
[1:07:22] in the queen of sheba the prophet said
[1:07:25] he said i'm a man of authority he was a
[1:07:27] centurion which means that he had a
[1:07:29] hundred men under him and he said i'm a
[1:07:31] man under authority and i say unto this
[1:07:33] man go and he goes this man comes and he
[1:07:36] comes he has to he's under my authority
[1:07:38] and i didn't even thought myself worthy
[1:07:40] to come to you
[1:07:42] none of my nation he was of a different
[1:07:45] race altogether he was roman jesus would
[1:07:48] have simply said you are oppressing us
[1:07:50] i'm not going to do that for you
[1:07:53] but this man realized that he the
[1:07:56] authority jesus had was above the roman
[1:07:59] government the authority that jesus had
[1:08:02] was coming from on high so everything
[1:08:05] every knee had to bow
[1:08:07] everything had to be dissolved under the
[1:08:10] authority of jesus
[1:08:12] and what did he recognize there that
[1:08:14] every sin
[1:08:16] every disease and everything was under
[1:08:19] his authority it says just go
[1:08:22] and it will go you see what he did he
[1:08:24] says now that's what i'm trying to get
[1:08:26] the american people to see
[1:08:28] that
[1:08:30] you don't have to wait for a special
[1:08:32] time you don't have to wait for a
[1:08:34] certain evangelist to come through to
[1:08:36] pray for you your pastor is sufficient
[1:08:39] if the pastor isn't there your neighbor
[1:08:42] is sufficient
[1:08:43] if the neighbor isn't there your husband
[1:08:45] or your wife is sufficient
[1:08:47] if there is no none of them they just
[1:08:50] raise up your hand he is sufficient
[1:08:52] always amen
[1:08:53] is that word it is sufficient by itself
[1:08:57] it does not need any mixing any
[1:08:59] hybridizing with anything
[1:09:01] god's word is sufficient enough amen he
[1:09:04] is put around you everyone you need he
[1:09:06] has put around you everything you need
[1:09:09] for you to get through whatever you are
[1:09:11] going through
[1:09:12] just wherever you are believe it it is a
[1:09:15] finished work
[1:09:18] amen
[1:09:19] so if you know that the word has
[1:09:21] authority
[1:09:22] there is nothing that should worry you
[1:09:25] when you are walking you know who you
[1:09:28] are you know the author whose authority
[1:09:31] you are under so you know that demons
[1:09:34] tremble when you walk why because you
[1:09:36] are under god's authority and when you
[1:09:40] trust god's authority you know that
[1:09:42] whatever you are going through he can
[1:09:44] pull you out of it you remember when
[1:09:46] peter was on that boat jesus said he
[1:09:49] said lord if it is you tell me to come
[1:09:51] then jesus said come
[1:09:54] he had never heard of a man walking on
[1:09:56] water but why he realized the man was
[1:10:00] speaking that that word
[1:10:02] come
[1:10:03] was enough to defy the laws of
[1:10:05] turbulence the to defy the laws of
[1:10:08] buoyancy and he was going to be able to
[1:10:11] walk so he just took him at his word and
[1:10:13] he said if you say come i know that has
[1:10:16] word has authority to make me walk on
[1:10:19] water and i know i will not sink amen
[1:10:22] that's why he went out of that boat and
[1:10:24] he started walking towards christ
[1:10:26] although he started sinking you know
[1:10:29] that word was still able to deliver him
[1:10:32] amen because that word had authority
[1:10:36] jesus has a reputation
[1:10:38] he's got a reputation to keep and his
[1:10:41] reputation is he never fails so if you
[1:10:44] call him on his word he is going to be
[1:10:46] right there on time hey man when you are
[1:10:49] under authority even hell knows that
[1:10:51] this man is under authority do you
[1:10:53] remember the sons of skiva
[1:10:56] will they try to pray for a man the man
[1:10:58] said
[1:11:00] this demon say the poor we know
[1:11:02] jesus we know but who are you they
[1:11:05] didn't know who that who they were
[1:11:07] because they didn't have any authority
[1:11:10] but they knew paul because paul was
[1:11:12] under the authority of jesus christ paul
[1:11:14] was under the authority of god so when
[1:11:17] you submit yourself to god
[1:11:19] that authority is transferred to you
[1:11:22] you have that authority amen
[1:11:27] the prophet of god tells us that when
[1:11:29] mary was walking
[1:11:30] she was coming from the temple she was
[1:11:32] coming from the synagogue and she was
[1:11:34] meditating
[1:11:36] upon the word
[1:11:37] and then that's when gabriel appeared to
[1:11:39] her and says
[1:11:40] you are going to give birth
[1:11:42] to a son and you shall call his name
[1:11:44] jesus
[1:11:46] this was never heard of
[1:11:48] but she knew that the word that was
[1:11:50] spoken by the angel
[1:11:52] had enough authority to defy logic
[1:11:56] that word was good enough to create that
[1:12:00] baby in her in in in a in a warm
[1:12:04] if she did not believe this word this
[1:12:06] was not going to happen god's word will
[1:12:08] not come to pass in your life unless you
[1:12:11] accept it unless you personalize it and
[1:12:14] say be it unto me according to thy word
[1:12:18] and the prophet of god tells us that she
[1:12:20] was meditating on the word
[1:12:22] she was drawing herself to god the word
[1:12:25] of god says if you draw night to me i
[1:12:27] will draw i will draw night to you so
[1:12:30] keep yourself in that atmosphere god
[1:12:33] will be sure to visit you
[1:12:35] god will always come through because
[1:12:38] when you realize the authority that's in
[1:12:40] god's word you know that there is
[1:12:42] nothing that can come against it there
[1:12:43] is nothing that can stand against it god
[1:12:46] will come through look at mary and
[1:12:48] martha
[1:12:49] when their brother had died
[1:12:52] they knew that jesus had healed the sick
[1:12:55] and they knew that if jesus spoke
[1:12:58] it did not matter how long the situation
[1:13:00] was
[1:13:01] lazarus was in the grave for four days
[1:13:03] and he was rotten
[1:13:05] but
[1:13:06] they said lord
[1:13:07] even though it doesn't matter our
[1:13:10] brother has been dead for four years
[1:13:12] four days but even though we know that
[1:13:15] you can still heal him what where was
[1:13:18] that faith coming from they recognized
[1:13:20] the authority that jesus had
[1:13:22] they had seen him walk on the shores of
[1:13:25] galilee walked those streets of
[1:13:27] jerusalem and they knew that if jesus
[1:13:29] spoke it doesn't matter how far gone the
[1:13:32] situation was how far gone the death
[1:13:35] process had gone he was able to to
[1:13:38] reverse it
[1:13:39] when jesus stood there and he called
[1:13:41] lazarus and says lazarus come forth
[1:13:44] lazarus was already in heaven
[1:13:46] and we know the prophet tells us that
[1:13:48] when he had gone to to to um when he had
[1:13:50] gone to the sixth dimension he didn't
[1:13:52] want to come back
[1:13:53] no one goes there and want to come back
[1:13:56] but lazarus heard that voice he says it
[1:13:58] doesn't matter how good this place is
[1:14:01] that word has authority i have to go i
[1:14:03] have to listen and go back
[1:14:05] and he came back
[1:14:07] the decaying process that had gone for
[1:14:09] three days four days it was reversed and
[1:14:12] he came back to stand why because the
[1:14:15] authority that was in the word that
[1:14:17] jesus spoke
[1:14:19] that word come forth had the same
[1:14:22] authority as god himself because in the
[1:14:25] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:14:27] god and that word was god so that word
[1:14:31] could not come back to him until lazarus
[1:14:34] was risen until lazarus was standing
[1:14:39] so you gotta know
[1:14:41] that when god's jesus speaks the word
[1:14:44] every verse from genesis chapter one to
[1:14:47] the last verse in revelation
[1:14:50] that word never fails
[1:14:52] that's
[1:14:53] the word and you have to
[1:14:55] believe it for it to come out of these
[1:14:57] pages and made manifest in your life
[1:15:00] look at the sarah phoenician woman
[1:15:03] she went to jesus and she says lord
[1:15:04] please heal my daughter and jesus called
[1:15:07] him he says
[1:15:08] we don't give our children's bread we
[1:15:10] don't give our children's bread to dogs
[1:15:12] she was called a dog
[1:15:15] if you and me was called a dog that
[1:15:17] wasn't that wasn't gonna sit well
[1:15:19] you're gonna you're gonna fight back
[1:15:21] but she had the right mental attitude
[1:15:24] towards the word of god
[1:15:27] and even though she was cursed even
[1:15:29] though she was called a dog she knew the
[1:15:32] man whom she was talking to and the
[1:15:35] prophet of god says
[1:15:37] and i'll say this that god keeps
[1:15:39] everywhere that he said and every
[1:15:42] promise that he says if you take the
[1:15:45] right mental attitude towards any divine
[1:15:48] promise
[1:15:49] that god ever made he will bring it to
[1:15:52] pass
[1:15:53] if you can just take the right attitude
[1:15:56] and believe it with all your heart it
[1:15:58] will happen to you
[1:16:00] just like that woman it doesn't matter
[1:16:02] what the word is saying you just believe
[1:16:04] it sometimes it might be so ridiculous
[1:16:07] you remember neyman was told to go wash
[1:16:09] in a in a muddy river but he went
[1:16:12] anyways because he was having faith he
[1:16:15] was believing that whatever the word of
[1:16:17] the lord says
[1:16:18] it will make
[1:16:20] me come to maturity it will make me come
[1:16:22] to my healing it will make me come to
[1:16:24] the place that i'm willing to be
[1:16:27] so all you just have to do is know
[1:16:29] have that right mental attitude on the
[1:16:31] word of god and stand right there
[1:16:34] if god says it that settles it
[1:16:37] that's all you need
[1:16:38] a word from the lord that settles
[1:16:41] everything
[1:16:42] when you hear that word you rest that's
[1:16:45] why we sing it he's so sweet to trust in
[1:16:48] jesus amen
[1:16:49] just to take him at his word
[1:16:52] just to take him at his promise
[1:16:55] just to know that that says the lord
[1:16:58] because we know it never fails
[1:17:00] when the word of god is spoken
[1:17:03] just take it right there it will never
[1:17:06] fail
[1:17:07] remember this one testimony of this
[1:17:09] brother who had gone to hunt with
[1:17:11] brother branham
[1:17:12] he was told that you are going to get
[1:17:14] your your your back what was the back or
[1:17:16] dear i can't remember his name
[1:17:18] and he said the prophet told me that i'm
[1:17:20] going to get my uh
[1:17:22] my dear
[1:17:24] that's that's all i need
[1:17:26] this brother he didn't start going to
[1:17:29] search in all the bushes and take his
[1:17:31] binoculars to start looking around
[1:17:33] he went and slept under a tree he took a
[1:17:36] nap he says if the prophet has spoken it
[1:17:40] is settled
[1:17:42] he was seated right there the deer came
[1:17:45] and started sniffing on his feet and you
[1:17:47] opened his eyes his dear was right there
[1:17:49] why because the word was spoken he
[1:17:52] didn't have to stress about it he was
[1:17:55] resting that word came and brought that
[1:17:58] deer to him so when you know the that
[1:18:01] god has spoken his word
[1:18:03] just rest
[1:18:05] thus says the lord never fails amen he
[1:18:08] will bring it to come to pass
[1:18:10] that promise he will bring it to your
[1:18:12] doorstep
[1:18:13] if you believe in him
[1:18:15] he says
[1:18:17] nearly everyone that really truly saves
[1:18:20] god means them kind of times
[1:18:22] sure you do
[1:18:24] sometimes you wonder how you're gonna
[1:18:25] get those kittens some shoes for schools
[1:18:27] how you're going to make this bill and
[1:18:29] that bill don't worry there's only one
[1:18:32] thing you got to do is rest on his
[1:18:35] promise he says i've never seen the
[1:18:37] righteous forsaken no his seed begging
[1:18:40] for bread so it doesn't matter amen you
[1:18:44] just rest on his promise god will take
[1:18:46] you through out of it
[1:18:49] god's word never fails amen so if you
[1:18:52] are
[1:18:52] come across difficulties if you have
[1:18:55] come across a situation you don't have
[1:18:57] an answer for be bills you're trying to
[1:19:00] pay be it sickness you're faced with
[1:19:03] just look back to the word of god rest
[1:19:05] upon that promise he is able to make it
[1:19:08] manifest come out and make it fulfilled
[1:19:11] in your life hey man because you and me
[1:19:13] we are supposed to become the word
[1:19:16] mary had the privilege to carry the word
[1:19:18] in her womb but we the bride in this
[1:19:21] last day
[1:19:22] we have the privilege to become the word
[1:19:25] you are not supposed just to carry the
[1:19:27] word but you are supposed to become the
[1:19:29] word
[1:19:30] that's why in revelation 10 8 the bride
[1:19:33] was told go take that book and you eat
[1:19:36] it
[1:19:37] hey man we know we we become what we eat
[1:19:40] so if you eat that book
[1:19:42] you become that book you gotta eat that
[1:19:45] word for you to become the word amen
[1:19:49] and that book had authority the other
[1:19:51] time we preached about how the jesus
[1:19:54] went back to the cross of calvary to
[1:19:56] restore the the the abstract to the
[1:19:58] title deed which was the authority that
[1:20:00] was in the word amen and that's the same
[1:20:03] book that was handed to the bride to say
[1:20:06] take this book and you eat it up that
[1:20:09] book had authority in it so when you
[1:20:12] take god at his word when you eat the
[1:20:15] word when you eat that book you are
[1:20:17] taking that authority within you hey man
[1:20:20] and we know that authority nothing can
[1:20:23] stand before it
[1:20:24] and he went back
[1:20:26] took that abstract title did and place
[1:20:28] it back into the hands of the bride so
[1:20:31] you and me we have access to this book
[1:20:34] we have access to each and every
[1:20:36] redemptive promise that god had for us
[1:20:38] that is this book is now unsealed
[1:20:41] the seven seals were opened for you and
[1:20:43] me we are in this last generation they
[1:20:47] are for you and me they are to bring us
[1:20:49] back to our original position
[1:20:52] for us to know who we are for not us to
[1:20:54] stand in our original authority that god
[1:20:58] had for us before the foundation of the
[1:21:00] world
[1:21:01] so you go take that book the authority
[1:21:04] that adam lost is yours to use because
[1:21:07] god jesus came to restore it back into
[1:21:10] our hands
[1:21:12] he gave us the secrets he gave us access
[1:21:15] to the secrets of this book he gave us
[1:21:17] secrets to all the mysteries that were
[1:21:20] being revealed so everything that we
[1:21:22] need in the bible is given to us
[1:21:24] everything we need in the word was given
[1:21:27] to us that's why you gotta constantly
[1:21:29] listen to that voice
[1:21:31] constantly listen to that message so you
[1:21:34] hear the secrets that will make you and
[1:21:37] bring you to maturity into the position
[1:21:39] that you were supposed to be amen
[1:21:41] because we are promised an adoption
[1:21:44] and this is not the adoption that we
[1:21:46] know of
[1:21:48] getting taken from someone being placed
[1:21:50] in a certain family but the adoption is
[1:21:52] official placing of the sons of god so
[1:21:56] that word is supposed to bring you to
[1:21:58] the maturity of you being placed into
[1:22:02] being a son of god and in your rightful
[1:22:05] position where you have the authority of
[1:22:07] your father jesus christ your father
[1:22:10] amen
[1:22:11] so you better know that if that book
[1:22:14] that authority is coming to you amen
[1:22:18] we're officially placed
[1:22:21] everything that was in god was poured
[1:22:23] into christ
[1:22:25] everything that was in christ was poured
[1:22:27] into the church the pastor was preaching
[1:22:29] the other day the other day if you go to
[1:22:31] the sea and you put the sea water in
[1:22:33] this bottle i can come back and tell you
[1:22:35] that i have sea water
[1:22:37] it might not be in the sea it might be
[1:22:39] in this bottle but i can tell you i have
[1:22:41] sea water why because the same chemical
[1:22:44] composition of sea water that's in this
[1:22:47] water in the sea is right in here it's
[1:22:50] just in a smaller quantity amen
[1:22:52] everything that was in god was poured
[1:22:54] into christ and everything that was in
[1:22:56] christ was poured into you and me so all
[1:23:00] the attributes that was in god were in
[1:23:02] christ and they are in you and me today
[1:23:05] we might have the limitations of these
[1:23:07] three dimensions but you gotta know the
[1:23:10] same authority god had you have it to
[1:23:12] your disposal you have it to use
[1:23:16] hey man
[1:23:17] in 1963
[1:23:19] when the cloud came down
[1:23:21] it was coming in
[1:23:23] god showing his supreme authority
[1:23:26] you know the prophet of god says
[1:23:28] then later on when we go through this
[1:23:32] and when the angels of the lord appeared
[1:23:34] out there for the seven seals it went up
[1:23:37] in the air
[1:23:38] which we have the picture of it right
[1:23:40] there and around over the country
[1:23:42] and he was standing
[1:23:44] there still wigged with that supreme
[1:23:47] authority he says that's the face of
[1:23:49] jesus right there you can see the eyes
[1:23:52] you can see the nose you can see the
[1:23:54] mouth why it was christ coming down
[1:23:57] coming down onto the earth to vindicate
[1:24:00] his message
[1:24:02] and in isaiah the bible in isaiah
[1:24:04] chapter 9 verse 6 he says for unto us a
[1:24:07] child is born
[1:24:08] unto us a son is given and the
[1:24:11] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:24:15] and his name shall be called wonderful
[1:24:17] the government shall be upon his
[1:24:19] shoulder was the government
[1:24:21] government is authority
[1:24:23] so the authority of god is upon his
[1:24:27] shoulders
[1:24:28] and when he came in 1963 he came in as
[1:24:31] the head
[1:24:32] where was the body the body was on the
[1:24:34] earth tonight i'm looking at the body of
[1:24:36] christ
[1:24:38] he says he is the head of the church he
[1:24:41] is the head of the body there is a
[1:24:43] nothing like him so when he came down he
[1:24:46] was not coming as a headless body but he
[1:24:49] was coming down as the head of the body
[1:24:52] of christ and the authority the
[1:24:54] government is upon his shoulders the
[1:24:57] authority is on the shoulders the
[1:24:59] shoulders is not on the head the
[1:25:01] shoulders is on the body so the
[1:25:03] authority is on the bride hey man
[1:25:06] so that makes you and me omnipotent
[1:25:09] god's word never fails amen his supreme
[1:25:12] authority is on you and me we gotta
[1:25:15] exercise it amen
[1:25:18] everything that was in god he poured
[1:25:19] into christ and everything that was in
[1:25:21] christ he put it into his body which is
[1:25:24] you and me
[1:25:26] and he did not mean to leave us back in
[1:25:29] the first and second pool but he made us
[1:25:32] to move into the third pool ministry hey
[1:25:34] man which is where we are supposed to
[1:25:36] move to we are not not supposed to
[1:25:39] remain behind
[1:25:40] we are supposed to go
[1:25:42] we need those healings we still need the
[1:25:45] first pool we still need the second pool
[1:25:47] but we don't stay right there we keep on
[1:25:50] going to the third pool ministry why
[1:25:52] because the bride has a ministry
[1:25:55] all the testimonies we enjoy talking
[1:25:57] about that the prophet had that was just
[1:26:00] not for him
[1:26:01] that was for you and me to see to say if
[1:26:04] god can do that he can do it in this day
[1:26:08] amen
[1:26:10] jesus christ was the sheaf waving that
[1:26:13] was waving in his prophet for you and me
[1:26:16] to see that inasmuch as this one has
[1:26:19] come to maturity so is you and me
[1:26:22] supposed to come to maturity
[1:26:25] inasmuch as god was exercising he's
[1:26:27] himself in his prophet he's supposed to
[1:26:30] exercise that in you and me
[1:26:33] the prophet of god says this is going to
[1:26:35] come a time when people i have to say i
[1:26:38] give you rain
[1:26:40] i give you healing
[1:26:42] today 2022 we cannot keep on saying
[1:26:45] there's going to be a time
[1:26:47] when you can say i will give you rain
[1:26:49] the time is now amen because you are the
[1:26:52] bride the ministry is on you whatever
[1:26:55] you saw being done is for you to
[1:26:57] continue doing
[1:26:59] that ministry that you have where we can
[1:27:01] stand and you speak and things happen
[1:27:04] why because the word has authority
[1:27:08] the word has the same authority as god
[1:27:10] himself and the word has the same
[1:27:12] authority as jesus had and that same
[1:27:14] authority is in you and me so if we are
[1:27:17] to become the word we are to become that
[1:27:20] exact same authority that was in the
[1:27:23] beginning so when you speak it should be
[1:27:26] the same as god says let there be when
[1:27:30] you speak things has to happen why
[1:27:32] because god has invested his authority
[1:27:35] in you
[1:27:36] the prophet of god says don't fear john
[1:27:38] don't fear little flock and we know john
[1:27:41] is a representation of the bride john
[1:27:44] was representing you and me he says all
[1:27:47] that i am you are heir to
[1:27:49] all my power is yours my omnipotence is
[1:27:53] yours as i stand in your midst i have
[1:27:56] not come to bring fear and failure but
[1:27:58] love and courage and ability he says all
[1:28:02] power is given unto me and it is yours
[1:28:06] to use
[1:28:07] you speak the word and i will perform it
[1:28:11] he don't end there he says that is my
[1:28:14] covenant and it can never fail
[1:28:16] god has a reputation of not breaking his
[1:28:19] covenant so if he says you speak i will
[1:28:23] perform it you just go ahead and speak
[1:28:26] because he will do it hey man that's why
[1:28:29] the prophet was there when god told him
[1:28:31] to speak those queers into existence
[1:28:34] he didn't kneel down and start praying
[1:28:36] to say lord may you please bring them no
[1:28:39] he knew that he was being open to the
[1:28:42] third pool ministry and it was for him
[1:28:44] to speak and he says
[1:28:46] he spoke those squirrels from his own
[1:28:49] mouth and those squirrels were created
[1:28:52] why because god has a covenant with you
[1:28:55] and me speak and he will do it
[1:28:58] so you just go ahead
[1:29:00] don't care about the consequences don't
[1:29:02] care what's coming right after that you
[1:29:04] just go ahead and speak and you know
[1:29:07] that god will perform it so long you are
[1:29:10] in the word of god so long you are under
[1:29:13] his authority you know that you are go
[1:29:16] you go ahead
[1:29:17] go ahead little bride
[1:29:19] speak that word and your savior your
[1:29:22] lord will perform it hey man
[1:29:24] that's what we've been promised in these
[1:29:26] last days
[1:29:28] that same spirit that gave jesus the
[1:29:30] authority to walk out of that grave on
[1:29:32] that sunday morning if that spirit is in
[1:29:35] you it's going to give you the same
[1:29:37] authority as well to burst out of this
[1:29:40] body to defy death to overcome death
[1:29:43] hell and the grave
[1:29:45] that same authority is going to bring
[1:29:47] your body to subjection to be translated
[1:29:50] into the rapture it doesn't matter if
[1:29:53] science cannot describe it or people
[1:29:55] don't know how that goes but simply
[1:29:57] because the word says it and you believe
[1:30:00] it and it has authority that has to come
[1:30:03] to pass these 16 elements has to burst
[1:30:06] wide open and you have to come out why
[1:30:09] because
[1:30:10] god's word has authority over your life
[1:30:13] you just believe it
[1:30:15] go ahead you speak it
[1:30:17] god will perform it let's stand up on
[1:30:19] our feet amen

[1:37:12] we are moving forward in in our personal
[1:37:15] lives
[1:37:16] so i thank
[1:37:17] god for sending that message to
[1:37:21] our brother samuel
[1:37:23] we thank god for all of the ministering
[1:37:25] brothers that are here
[1:37:27] have worked so diligently with us by the
[1:37:30] grace of god
[1:37:31] we trust by the grace of god that we'll
[1:37:33] continue on moving forward
[1:37:37] as our brothers say into that third pool
[1:37:41] and the only way that we can continue is
[1:37:44] that we must continue to receive more
[1:37:46] power
[1:37:47] than we have in the past
[1:37:50] and i want to encourage everyone here
[1:37:52] tonight to
[1:37:53] find time to go listen to the messages
[1:37:56] countdown there are two of them
[1:37:59] and they are both uh excellent
[1:38:03] uh but in order to hear what's being
[1:38:05] said you're going to have to be in the
[1:38:07] spirit you can't be
[1:38:08] in your corner mind to hear what brother
[1:38:10] branham is trying to tell us
[1:38:14] especially the one i think it's uh
[1:38:18] 11 25 62.
[1:38:21] that one is really really a blessing and
[1:38:25] and by the grace of god i trust that you
[1:38:27] can really listen to it and if if you
[1:38:29] can really hear what the spirit is
[1:38:31] saying to the church then he will
[1:38:33] it will bring me to a place where i
[1:38:35] won't have to labor so hard
[1:38:37] we thank you once again brother brother
[1:38:39] samuel for
[1:38:41] allowing god to use you
[1:38:44] it's very difficult when you don't have
[1:38:46] a lot of amens
[1:38:48] but by the grace of god i felt like the
[1:38:50] anointing of the lord really caught you
[1:38:51] when you really brought forth what god
[1:38:53] wanted you to bring forth
[1:38:55] i also have one more announcement and um
