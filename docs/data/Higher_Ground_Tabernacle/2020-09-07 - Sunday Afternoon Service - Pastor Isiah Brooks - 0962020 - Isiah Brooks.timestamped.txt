[34:10] we just want to do a part two from this
[34:11] morning won't be long
[34:14] just a little bit of things that i have
[34:15] a few things i left without i was out
[34:18] of what i wanted to do and uh we
[34:20] appreciate god we appreciate
[34:23] his amazing grace that's what it is
[34:28] it's truly his amazing grace sometimes
[34:30] we minister
[34:31] and it seems like we're going or headed
[34:33] toward the law but i believe
[34:35] by god's grace that if you love god
[34:38] you'll keep his commandment
[34:39] it's all about loving jesus because he
[34:43] first love
[34:43] us amen we thank you lord we thank you
[34:48] lord we thank you lord okay let us turn
[34:51] by god's grace to
[34:53] scripture here let's go to colossians
[34:56] uh the first chapter
[35:05] i'm sorry let's go back back to first
[35:06] john please first john the fifth chapter
[35:21] 19 first
[35:24] as we can see many people heard and
[35:26] didn't hear this morning
[35:29] but it has to be this way uh it has to
[35:32] be this way
[35:33] there is there is no way around it uh
[35:36] all of us are fulfilling scripture
[35:39] right now all of us
[35:42] at all times we're playing a role
[35:47] uh yes first john 5 19-21
[35:58] and we know
[36:01] that we are of god this is where i got
[36:05] my subject this morning and the whole
[36:08] world lieth
[36:09] in wickedness and we know that the son
[36:12] of god has come
[36:15] and have given us an understanding i
[36:18] love that
[36:20] that we may know him that is true
[36:24] and we are in him that is true
[36:28] even in his son jesus christ
[36:32] this is the true god and eternal life
[36:38] little children keep yourself from idols
[36:41] amen let us pray father god we come
[36:45] before you right now we thank you for
[36:46] your grace and your mercy
[36:49] we thank you for being so good to us and
[36:51] father we pray that you would
[36:53] cleanse us from all our unrighteousness
[36:56] if there be any thoughts
[36:58] desires or anything that we may have
[37:00] entertained we ask that you forgive us
[37:02] in cleanses of them
[37:03] all bless the servants in a special way
[37:06] bless those who have sacrificed to be
[37:09] here the musicians and
[37:10] the song leader and others oh god we
[37:13] thank you father
[37:14] for the small group because you
[37:18] said fear not little flock is the
[37:20] father's good pleasure to give you the
[37:22] kingdom
[37:23] so we thank you father for being mindful
[37:25] of us
[37:26] and therefore we are mindful of you have
[37:28] thine own way
[37:30] in jesus christ's name we pray amen you
[37:32] may be seated
[37:37] just looking at the scripture and as we
[37:40] said you know we're living in an evil
[37:41] age
[37:43] so much so that god called this age
[37:46] uh evil and wicked
[37:49] it is a age that have been prophesied
[37:51] throughout the scripture
[37:55] but we find out that this age is the
[37:57] worst of all ages
[37:59] i mean we could say in the days of noah
[38:01] was bad we can say that in the days of
[38:03] sodom it was bad but
[38:05] now we got two put together it's a
[38:08] manifold
[38:09] manifestation of demonic power
[38:13] and god put us here the bride of jesus
[38:16] christ
[38:19] and he tells us amen according to
[38:20] corinthians that love conquers all
[38:24] so we realize by god's grace he placed
[38:26] divine love in us to do what conquer
[38:28] everything that satan can put out
[38:30] amen the old the now
[38:33] and the new we have the ability to put
[38:36] satan on our feet
[38:39] it's not by powers not by might but by
[38:41] my spirit saith the lord
[38:43] and we realize by god's grace that god's
[38:46] spirit is with us and within us
[38:49] it is god's spirit that has protected us
[38:51] because you know even when we were
[38:53] sinners the bible said christ died for
[38:55] us
[38:56] we had no idea that we have been
[38:58] predestinated for this
[39:00] hour but i would not have wanted to live
[39:02] in no other age
[39:04] i believe this is the age that god has
[39:06] ordained me for
[39:08] and i am have i have confidence in his
[39:10] word that he that begun the good work in
[39:12] us is faithful to complete it
[39:15] listen what john the fifth chapter said
[39:17] he says for we know that whosoever is
[39:19] born of god
[39:20] sin is not that means that you you you
[39:22] don't continue to sin
[39:25] and that word sin means to disbelieve
[39:28] you believe all of the word
[39:30] whether you understand it or not you
[39:32] believe it
[39:33] there was an incident long time ago amen
[39:36] this young man or this man was talking
[39:37] to this young lady
[39:39] and was telling her about how he did not
[39:41] believe in god
[39:43] and she was carrying her bible and he
[39:45] asked her whether or not she believed in
[39:47] it and she said yeah
[39:49] and he asked her uh say uh
[39:52] and you believe that old story about
[39:54] jonas while falling swallowing
[39:56] the whale she said yeah i believe that i
[39:58] believe all of it
[40:01] and he said well the only way you can
[40:03] believe that is by faith
[40:05] and said uh what if you get to uh
[40:08] heaven and jonah is not there
[40:14] she said didn't you ask him how did he
[40:17] swallow
[40:18] he said and and i said like this even if
[40:21] if god wrote the word and say jonah
[40:24] swallowed the whale i would believe it
[40:26] amen now you and i must understand that
[40:29] god's word is not
[40:30] something that you can intellectually
[40:32] figure out
[40:34] every son of god comes to god by faith
[40:38] faith is a substance hope for any
[40:40] evidence of things not seen when you
[40:42] have faith
[40:43] you cannot even explain it you know that
[40:45] you got something you
[40:47] you got you got a hold of something and
[40:49] you know that it's real the
[40:52] word of god goes on to say and we know
[40:54] that the son of god has come
[40:56] and have given us an understanding
[41:00] that's powerful to me because a lot of
[41:02] people even in the days of jesus christ
[41:05] had
[41:06] no understanding of who he was so much
[41:09] so that he asked his disciples
[41:11] who do men say i the son of man am
[41:14] we've heard this story we've heard it
[41:16] preach and peter said
[41:18] you know some say you are a liars some
[41:21] say that you're john the baptist
[41:23] some say you're a jeremiah but then
[41:25] jesus made it a point to ask him
[41:27] directly who do
[41:28] who do you say i the son of man am now
[41:31] understanding
[41:33] those jews understood the terminology of
[41:35] son of man
[41:36] son of man meant a prophet and we know
[41:39] that the word of the lord comes to the
[41:41] prophet
[41:42] it is a man he is a man whom god speaks
[41:45] through
[41:46] and so he says now i am a man that god
[41:48] speak through i am a prophet but who do
[41:50] you say this
[41:51] prophet is so he wanted to refine or
[41:55] he wanted uh uh uh peter to define what
[41:58] he meant to give me understanding give
[42:00] me
[42:01] give me a your revelation of who who i
[42:03] am
[42:04] and of course peter said thou out the
[42:06] christ
[42:07] the son of the living god and for jew to
[42:11] uh proclaim that and to announce that or
[42:14] even make
[42:15] such words come out of his mouth he
[42:16] better have it as a revelation
[42:19] because the jews only believed in one
[42:21] god so what he was trying to say or what
[42:23] he did say
[42:24] was that you are god in flesh
[42:28] hallelujah so understanding came
[42:31] and jesus said you know being with me
[42:34] did not teach you that
[42:36] flesh and blood i didn't teach you that
[42:39] i didn't sit down on the on on the side
[42:41] of the mount
[42:42] of olives and i didn't teach you that in
[42:44] my studies
[42:46] and basically said flesh and blood has
[42:48] not
[42:49] revealed this unto you peter but my
[42:52] father which is in heaven
[42:54] he took it higher he has revealed this
[42:56] truth unto you
[42:58] and that's what we must understand amen
[43:01] we can read this word we can study this
[43:03] word
[43:04] we can meditate on this word we can we
[43:06] can we can compare
[43:07] scripture to scripture all of these
[43:09] things are good
[43:10] well unto god the spirit the holy spirit
[43:13] comes
[43:14] and unfolded to us we don't know we
[43:16] don't know him
[43:18] amen and so we realize there's only one
[43:20] god
[43:21] and this is why the word of god tells uh
[43:24] and john
[43:25] little children keep yourselves from
[43:27] idols
[43:29] because we realize that idols can come
[43:30] in every form there is
[43:33] hallelujah you can even make yourself an
[43:35] idol
[43:36] in this day many men worship themselves
[43:40] hallelujah amen ii corinthians i'm
[43:43] saying all of these things i'm going
[43:45] somewhere with it
[43:46] ii corinthians 1 20 says for all the
[43:49] promises of god in him are gay
[43:52] and in him amen i love that
[43:55] because we have promises of this age
[43:58] god promised to perfect us he promised
[44:02] to
[44:02] to to bring forth out of this wickedness
[44:05] a bride without spark wrinkle or blemish
[44:10] it doesn't matter how dark it gets god's
[44:13] promise
[44:14] will always prevail amen
[44:17] and the bible says for all the promises
[44:19] of god in him are gay
[44:21] and in him again unto the glory of god
[44:24] by us
[44:25] now he which establishes us with you in
[44:29] christ
[44:30] and have anointed us is god
[44:34] who who have also sealed us
[44:37] and given the earnest of the spirit
[44:41] in our hearts so to understand we know
[44:44] that
[44:44] even the saints of god then were sealed
[44:49] hallelujah that's what the bible says
[44:52] they were sealed amen and and and they
[44:55] understood their position
[44:56] amen because he said listen now he which
[45:00] establishes us with you in christ
[45:04] and have anointed us is god
[45:08] not that christ and god is two separate
[45:10] beings
[45:11] just positions the way they position
[45:13] themselves
[45:15] they're just one god in different
[45:18] positions
[45:19] hallelujah he's still god the father
[45:22] he's still god the son
[45:24] he's still god the holy ghost hallelujah
[45:27] father in creation
[45:28] son in redemption holy ghost in the
[45:30] church today
[45:32] one god with three main manifolds
[45:36] uh manifestations of himself
[45:39] this is what the early church believed
[45:41] and in order for us to be part of that
[45:44] that early church is that right
[45:47] we know by the message if the if the
[45:49] early church was a pentecostal church
[45:52] and if that tree would bring forth
[45:54] another branch
[45:55] it would bring forth the same church
[45:58] that went down or started in the day of
[46:00] pentecost
[46:01] it would have the same fruit and
[46:05] the same life hallelujah the difference
[46:08] is
[46:09] is that this tree is a mature tree now
[46:12] hallelujah
[46:13] it's a tree that have come to maturity
[46:16] to bring forth mature fruit
[46:19] now ephesians 1 10 says that in the
[46:21] dispensation of the fullness of time
[46:23] he might gather together in one all
[46:26] things in christ
[46:28] both which are in heaven and which are
[46:30] on earth
[46:31] even in him so what is god
[46:35] doing not only did he save us
[46:38] he he died he rose again and from that
[46:42] point on he have taken those who are
[46:44] believers
[46:45] and when they die they go live under the
[46:48] altar of god
[46:50] and and and his dying was to gather
[46:53] all things everything that was in him
[46:56] from the beginning
[46:58] now christ has the ability to gather all
[47:01] things
[47:02] hallelujah everything both which are in
[47:05] heaven
[47:05] and which are on earth even in him did
[47:08] y'all know that
[47:09] there's a coming of time when everything
[47:13] will be in one position or one place
[47:18] hallelujah because earth will become
[47:21] heaven
[47:22] is that right and jesus christ who was
[47:25] the invisible
[47:26] image or with the image of the invisible
[47:28] god
[47:29] excuse me he was the firstborn of every
[47:32] creature
[47:34] so if he was the firstborn that means
[47:36] some some others must come after
[47:38] him same creature now one creature
[47:41] right same image same reflection
[47:44] in other words if i was to have a child
[47:46] my wife and i we're not going to produce
[47:48] a horse or a dog is going to be a man so
[47:52] god in his creation amen brought forth
[47:54] christ because he was the first
[47:57] it was the beginning of the creation of
[47:59] god according to the book of revelation
[48:01] and we come to understand that this is
[48:04] what the message is all about
[48:06] to bring us back to eden
[48:09] before the fall hallelujah
[48:13] amen and so you and i must understand
[48:16] that
[48:16] even as christ was the image of god we
[48:19] must be the
[48:20] image of christ hallelujah for by him
[48:23] were all things created
[48:25] that are in heaven that are in earth
[48:28] visible and invisible
[48:29] whether there be thrones or dominions or
[48:31] principalities or powers
[48:33] all things created by him and for him
[48:36] he is before all things and by him
[48:40] all things consist and he is the head of
[48:43] the body the church
[48:45] who is the beginning the born from the
[48:48] dead
[48:48] that in all things he might have
[48:51] preeminence
[48:53] hello so it is christ's duty
[48:56] it is his purpose to have preeminence
[49:01] over all things like god told the first
[49:04] adam
[49:04] to do all things the first adam fell
[49:08] the second adam did not why because the
[49:11] first adam was the
[49:12] atom of of the earth he was fleshly he
[49:14] was caught you understand
[49:16] me he was an earthly man but the bible
[49:18] said the second adam
[49:20] is the quickening spirit he is the very
[49:22] lord of heaven
[49:24] hallelujah so now the lord of heaven
[49:26] comes to
[49:27] produce himself to multiply
[49:30] himself and understand by god's grace we
[49:34] are the first fruits
[49:36] hallelujah god is so good to us
[49:39] so therefore what god comes as he did in
[49:43] the beginning
[49:44] to embody human flesh to
[49:47] to use us as tabernacles because the
[49:50] bible said that god is a spirit
[49:52] and no man have seen god at any time yet
[49:55] it's still jesus said unto thomas of the
[49:57] disciples
[49:58] when you see me you see the father
[50:01] hallelujah
[50:02] is that all right yes philip
[50:05] so we understand we ought to be an
[50:07] expectation of the change
[50:10] i just wonder how the caterpillar ever
[50:12] feel
[50:14] uh you know it's pretty pretty rough
[50:16] being a worm
[50:18] but it's beautiful being a butterfly
[50:22] and you can see the transformation one
[50:25] looks
[50:25] nothing like the other and that's how it
[50:28] is it'll be in glory
[50:30] when this earthly tabernacle be
[50:31] dissolved the bible said we have a
[50:33] building
[50:34] we have one maid a man who was building
[50:37] and make it was god
[50:38] and it was made not by human hands but
[50:41] when we talk about
[50:42] expectation usually uh situation comes
[50:46] in a place
[50:46] or a time when things have cooled off
[50:50] you know how many of us have desired and
[50:53] i've heard it many times and i think
[50:54] looking back
[50:55] sometimes is not always good because
[50:57] especially when some god has promised
[50:59] you something that's greater than what's
[51:01] behind
[51:02] we look at azusa street as though it was
[51:05] the greatest thing ever happened but
[51:07] that was just the beginning of it all in
[51:09] this day
[51:11] because we are in a greater expectation
[51:14] we're not talking about the baptism of
[51:15] the holy ghost we're talking about
[51:17] the full measure of christ occupying
[51:19] human bodies
[51:21] like peter said the statue of a full man
[51:24] christ
[51:24] in you the hope of glory
[51:28] as i said this morning god devil leaves
[51:30] himself without a witness
[51:31] even in this wicked age even in the age
[51:33] of
[51:34] of the flood we know that noah was a
[51:36] witness even in the age before them we
[51:38] know that enoch was a witness
[51:40] god always raises up a witness
[51:44] someone who declared that he he is god
[51:48] there's been a time according to this
[51:50] quote where the church has gotten real
[51:53] low but god has never been without a
[51:55] witness since the world began
[51:57] he's always had some body that he could
[52:00] put his finger on
[52:01] and say that's my servant and i can send
[52:05] him anywhere
[52:06] i want him to go and he'll go
[52:09] aren't we happy for that god's ministry
[52:12] that's the day
[52:13] that and that day had got very
[52:16] dull in those days there were hundreds
[52:20] of people
[52:21] thousands of them that had turned away
[52:23] the tradition of
[52:25] and and away from faith going back
[52:27] lukewarm and
[52:28] you'll see where i'm going with this in
[52:30] a minute there was a little remnant who
[52:33] looked for the
[52:34] consolation of israel that was john the
[52:37] baptist and simeon and anna
[52:39] the prophetess at the temple and many
[52:41] more uh
[52:42] more weighted uh excuse me constantly
[52:45] believing that god would fulfill his
[52:47] promise now understand
[52:48] they hadn't had a prophet in how many
[52:51] years
[52:53] right oh yeah they got they got john the
[52:55] baptist
[52:56] out there but understand john the
[52:58] baptist and jesus
[53:00] were babies i they didn't know they
[53:03] didn't have any idea
[53:04] what they were looking for but think
[53:06] about since malachi
[53:08] there was no vision and understand the
[53:10] bible say without a vision the people
[53:12] perish
[53:13] and you can't get a vision without a
[53:15] prophet is that right
[53:17] he is what we call the seer so they had
[53:19] no see and
[53:20] understand that's when god moves he'll
[53:23] let something last for a long time he'll
[53:26] stretch it out
[53:28] till to there's nobody almost left
[53:31] that will believe or even remember the
[53:33] promise
[53:34] remember when god brought forth mary
[53:37] everybody had forgotten about it what
[53:40] isaiah said a virgin shall concede
[53:43] huh but we can understand when isaiah
[53:45] first said that everybody all the
[53:47] virgins were hoping it was them
[53:49] but she gotta stretch it out
[53:52] just like in this day we're looking for
[53:55] the rapture
[53:56] and so many people say it ain't going to
[53:58] happen oh i've been heard
[53:59] hearing that for years people have said
[54:02] god is going to come and he hasn't come
[54:04] yet
[54:05] that is the time the bible said god will
[54:08] come when you least expect
[54:10] him is that right that's what happened
[54:13] when jesus turned up
[54:16] at the temple and here was these
[54:20] old folks waiting on him
[54:25] hallelujah simeon and anna
[54:28] believed that god was going to show them
[54:30] who the messiah was
[54:32] before they died did god did god
[54:36] make his promise true he was the one who
[54:38] inspired them
[54:40] that they would see the messiah and
[54:42] because of the inspiration
[54:44] they believed it and when no one else
[54:47] could see him coming
[54:49] it was simeon and anna prophesying
[54:52] this is the one to come and to be honest
[54:55] with you
[54:57] you can see nobody believed him
[55:01] nobody believed them jesus came in the
[55:04] temple the prophecy was made
[55:06] they went out nobody followed
[55:09] nobody said ah where are y'all leaving
[55:11] where are you going
[55:12] none of that they didn't believe they
[55:15] were not in expectation
[55:17] you see what i'm saying that's just how
[55:19] easy and simple the rapture is going to
[55:21] take place
[55:23] the rapture will only appear to those
[55:25] who are in expectation of
[55:27] it doesn't matter if you're still in
[55:30] church
[55:30] doesn't matter if you're among a group
[55:32] they were having church service
[55:34] lambs and animals different ones were
[55:36] being slain and made sacrifices
[55:38] and jesus and mary and joseph they
[55:40] walked right into the temple
[55:42] hallelujah and this great sacrifice
[55:45] this great blessing was was given you
[55:48] know circumcision and all of that
[55:50] and they missed it hallelujah
[55:53] it was the eighth day
[55:56] hello it was the eighth day that he
[56:00] showed up to the temple
[56:02] and they missed it
[56:05] hallelujah why they were wicked
[56:09] church had become a system it had become
[56:13] a program
[56:14] it was a stench in god's nostrils that's
[56:16] the bible
[56:18] it became a ritual but there was only
[56:21] two
[56:23] in expectation hallelujah isn't that
[56:26] funny
[56:27] the same kind of thing happened in the
[56:28] days of moses only two crossed over
[56:32] because they were in expectation of the
[56:34] promises that were made to them
[56:36] hallelujah oh glory to god is that all
[56:39] right
[56:40] they were what they were waiting for the
[56:42] messiah
[56:43] who are you waiting for we must wait in
[56:46] expectation
[56:47] the world as a whole the church world as
[56:49] a whole
[56:50] they've given up on it they won't say it
[56:53] with their mouths
[56:54] but their actions prove it now the
[56:58] waiting of
[56:58] the messiah have been 4 000 years think
[57:01] about it
[57:02] ever since the garden of eden god
[57:05] promised
[57:07] that the messiah was coming he would
[57:10] bruise the head of the serpent
[57:12] and the serpent would bruise his heel
[57:14] yet there was still
[57:16] somebody looking
[57:19] being able to discern the times of the
[57:21] signs of the time
[57:24] and in every generation they had looked
[57:26] for the messiah to come
[57:27] but that didn't stop simeon he was an
[57:30] old man in his eighties but still he
[57:34] believed that he would see the messiah
[57:36] and he had a long white beard and a can
[57:38] i can imagine
[57:40] white hair and he was a great man among
[57:42] the people
[57:43] he had a great prestige but he had a
[57:46] testimony besides that
[57:48] that was what i like besides all of the
[57:51] scholarships and all of the
[57:53] popularity he had a humble heart before
[57:55] god
[57:57] come on somebody amen
[58:00] he had a humble heart before god
[58:04] that's what we need that's what we need
[58:07] a receptive heart that god could deal
[58:09] with him
[58:10] and he had a testimony by that he was
[58:12] going to see the lord christ before he
[58:15] died
[58:15] think of it god reveals himself to the
[58:19] humble heart
[58:23] it's not about being great it's a it's
[58:26] about being humble
[58:28] and that's what we must understand you
[58:30] know we got too many different kinds of
[58:32] hearts
[58:33] and uh anyway great men david solomon
[58:37] elijah elisha
[58:38] isaiah jeremiah a string of prophets and
[58:41] and righteous men had looked for the
[58:43] coming of the messiah for
[58:45] 4 000 years great men but yet this man
[58:48] even 80 years old approximately he was
[58:51] an elderly man believed by the
[58:53] theologians
[58:55] he was in his 80s an old man
[58:58] and yet went around and said i am not
[59:01] going to see depth before i see the lord
[59:03] jesus
[59:04] the lord christ and you know they
[59:06] thought he was crazy
[59:08] hallelujah hey man you know we heard the
[59:11] brother preachers
[59:12] i got a testimony and they said oh my
[59:14] head comes again
[59:16] but i'm not gonna die nowadays they said
[59:19] don't don't say that brother brooks
[59:20] you're gonna make the rapture don't say
[59:22] that you're not gonna die i don't heard
[59:23] a lot of people say they weren't gonna
[59:24] die and they died i can't help what they
[59:26] said
[59:27] but when the inspiration is upon you and
[59:29] you know that god is going to keep you
[59:31] into the changing of the body
[59:33] that's why i'm here today i believe that
[59:36] i really do believe that you know i told
[59:39] the lord when i had cancer lord i don't
[59:40] mind dying if that's what you want me to
[59:42] die
[59:43] want me to if you want me to die i'll
[59:44] die i'm not afraid of death but lord
[59:48] if i could just live to see the changing
[59:50] of the body
[59:52] if i could see the mount zion uh uh
[59:55] showdown lord if if it's okay with you
[59:57] let me live for those purposes
[59:59] that you might be glorified cancer
[1:00:02] disappeared
[1:00:04] that's all i'm saying it's a reason i
[1:00:07] wanted to live
[1:00:08] and sometimes i know i was under the
[1:00:10] anointing because sometimes i feel like
[1:00:11] i should have took the ticket
[1:00:19] i mean you know what i'm saying oh the
[1:00:22] devil said see that you should have went
[1:00:23] on
[1:00:25] but god is good hallelujah that's right
[1:00:29] he at least give me confidence that i'm
[1:00:31] going to see a rapture
[1:00:32] i believe that with all my heart because
[1:00:34] the holy ghost revealed it to me
[1:00:37] and i'm not going to see death until i
[1:00:39] see lord christ
[1:00:40] see i ain't the only one right
[1:00:44] and i believe that what he says is true
[1:00:46] amen
[1:00:47] and on mine that's gets us feeling real
[1:00:51] religious right away wanted now listen
[1:00:54] we're talking about
[1:00:55] the third pool we've seen the first pool
[1:00:58] right the healing and
[1:00:59] the discernment of the second pool and
[1:01:01] everything when god said okay you're
[1:01:03] going to even come to a place
[1:01:04] amen you'll know the very intent of the
[1:01:06] heart we know that's jesus christ
[1:01:08] the bible said the word is uh sharper
[1:01:11] than a two-edged sword is the only thing
[1:01:12] that can divide the soul in the spirit
[1:01:14] it is the only thing that can discern
[1:01:16] the intents of the heart that was not
[1:01:18] william branham that was god in william
[1:01:19] branham
[1:01:20] the same god that was in william branham
[1:01:22] want to be the god in us
[1:01:24] right so we understand that the third
[1:01:27] pool
[1:01:28] was not just the uh the the
[1:01:31] i put it the way the attraction can i
[1:01:33] say it like this
[1:01:34] understand that even prophets
[1:01:38] that god uses who don't even know their
[1:01:41] prophets
[1:01:42] god has to do something to attract them
[1:01:46] for example when it came to william
[1:01:47] branham god used to peel the fire
[1:01:50] he used a whirlwind in the bush he used
[1:01:53] various things to attract him
[1:01:56] to make him know that he was different
[1:01:58] from everybody else
[1:02:00] hallelujah and once he got his attention
[1:02:02] then the angel came
[1:02:04] and said listen you got a special
[1:02:06] ministry don't defile your body
[1:02:08] don't drink don't smoke don't run with
[1:02:11] women you see
[1:02:12] amen but it was until till god got his
[1:02:16] attention even at that time
[1:02:17] he still didn't understand
[1:02:21] he still didn't understand and even when
[1:02:23] it came to john the baptist
[1:02:25] god got him his attraction by why
[1:02:28] when you see the the light descending
[1:02:30] upon him
[1:02:31] still the pill of fire god had to
[1:02:34] attract moses by what
[1:02:36] the pill of fire you see so we realize
[1:02:39] amen that even god attracts the prophets
[1:02:41] now
[1:02:42] when god did what he did in 1963
[1:02:46] it wasn't to attract the prophet because
[1:02:47] the prophet was already there
[1:02:50] but that was done for the bride of jesus
[1:02:53] christ
[1:02:54] remember when brother branham was out
[1:02:56] there west and god told him to pick up a
[1:02:59] stone and throw it in the air
[1:03:00] and he told those brothers now you run
[1:03:02] go hide
[1:03:03] all of a sudden the whirlwind came down
[1:03:05] and blast those rocks
[1:03:07] out of the mountain right and the one of
[1:03:10] the brothers said brother
[1:03:12] what was that for he said well it wasn't
[1:03:14] for me he said because i believe and you
[1:03:17] don't
[1:03:18] so those things came to attract their
[1:03:20] attention
[1:03:21] that this man that you call bill is not
[1:03:24] just any man
[1:03:26] but he has a special calling from me
[1:03:30] and it was a dust said the lord and only
[1:03:33] that prophet comes with thus said lord
[1:03:35] you better know is thus said the lord if
[1:03:38] you're going to say thus says the lord
[1:03:40] hallelujah but anyway the cloud came and
[1:03:43] and what was the cloud
[1:03:44] 4 to show us that we have come to the
[1:03:47] end
[1:03:47] and time would be no more it came to
[1:03:50] tell us
[1:03:51] amen that the rapture is on see a lot of
[1:03:54] people don't know what the rapture is
[1:03:55] because
[1:03:56] they don't understand what what it's all
[1:03:58] about or the manifestations of it
[1:04:00] everybody looking at this change at the
[1:04:03] moment of a twinkling of an eye
[1:04:04] but they don't understand that there's a
[1:04:06] shout and there's a trump
[1:04:08] there's a preparation to make us ready
[1:04:10] for that
[1:04:11] snap that tweakly number not change
[1:04:15] right and the bride of jesus christ
[1:04:17] right now
[1:04:18] is moving into that change what is she
[1:04:21] doing
[1:04:21] the holy spirit is recreating her
[1:04:27] this is why you need the holy ghost it
[1:04:30] is a recreation it's a changing of you
[1:04:33] amen from the old man to a new it is the
[1:04:36] changing of your character
[1:04:38] from earthly to heaven hallelujah
[1:04:41] and when you come to a place
[1:04:45] of you say well brother brooks i don't
[1:04:47] know about this but remember
[1:04:50] adam said to eve you came from me
[1:04:55] like jesus christ said we came from him
[1:05:00] like adam said to his to eve which was
[1:05:03] adam at the top first time
[1:05:04] you're born in my bone and flesh of my
[1:05:06] flesh like jesus christ have said

[1:05:11] flesh we're joined as together

[1:05:17] the foundation of the world
[1:05:19] and it took calvary to bring you out
[1:05:22] but now we're at the end where there's
[1:05:25] going to be a real ceremony
[1:05:27] because remember adam and eve was just
[1:05:30] potential
[1:05:31] married there was no great ceremony
[1:05:34] because the serpent interrupted
[1:05:37] but in this scene the serpent has no
[1:05:40] dealing
[1:05:41] this bride of jesus christ will not thaw
[1:05:44] to the serpent's lie

[1:06:11] mentions right he said i go to prepare a
[1:06:14] place for you that where i
[1:06:15] am there you might be also is that right
[1:06:18] he asked he said father in saint john 14
[1:06:22] he said i asked lord one thing that she
[1:06:24] would be with me
[1:06:27] hallelujah that's all he didn't ask for
[1:06:30] no jury
[1:06:31] he didn't ask for nothing no riches he
[1:06:34] asked that
[1:06:34] you the bride be with him eternally
[1:06:38] hallelujah that's all he asks father i
[1:06:41] just want them to be with me
[1:06:43] oh praise god thank god for the blood of
[1:06:46] jesus

[1:06:50] so
[1:06:50] when the seals were open as you heard me
[1:06:53] say
[1:06:54] and god began to to bring forth those
[1:06:56] seven angels with the seven thunders and
[1:06:59] breaking the seven seals and showing us
[1:07:00] all the mysteries of redemption

[1:07:04] reason why it happened hallelujah
[1:07:06] and how god threw all of that brought
[1:07:09] all of his kind through it
[1:07:10] right some through the water some
[1:07:12] through the flood some through the fire
[1:07:15] but all through the blood hallelujah he
[1:07:18] showed us by god's grace
[1:07:19] amen where we came from where we're
[1:07:21] going amen and now he's giving us our
[1:07:24] identity
[1:07:26] hallelujah and he said his bride will
[1:07:29] not
[1:07:29] doubt one word she'll be a full
[1:07:32] birth a full word bride
[1:07:35] hallelujah and now she's come he's come

[1:07:52] first adam couldn't do
[1:07:54] he came and he stood one land on the
[1:07:56] land one foot on the land
[1:07:58] one on the sea and he swore by heaven
[1:08:00] hallelujah
[1:08:01] y'all understand me he was standing
[1:08:04] there as a second adam

[1:08:09] things
[1:08:10] are under my feet now
[1:08:14] hallelujah where is she
[1:08:17] hallelujah i have gone to prepare and
[1:08:19] did you know
[1:08:20] that he's already prepared it he's
[1:08:23] finished
[1:08:24] now he's waiting on us the city of
[1:08:27] jerusalem the new jerusalem
[1:08:29] is waiting on us
[1:08:33] hallelujah when that last one comes in
[1:08:37] we're going up we're changing dimensions
[1:08:41] hallelujah
[1:08:42] you talking about a shouting good time
[1:08:45] hallelujah
[1:08:45] like that song say i can only imagine
[1:08:48] hallelujah
[1:08:50] oh my god to even have a body that will
[1:08:52] not ate will not get tired
[1:08:55] nothing of this of that nature i can't
[1:08:57] imagine it
[1:08:59] listen what he goes on to say amen in
[1:09:01] spiritual food in this season
[1:09:03] a due season paragraph 83 he says then
[1:09:06] back
[1:09:06] out there at the beginning of the seven
[1:09:08] seasons y'all remember when brother
[1:09:10] brown began to when god began to deal
[1:09:11] with him and
[1:09:12] and show him where his position was
[1:09:14] because you know before
[1:09:16] the seals were open he was just working
[1:09:18] working in a ministry
[1:09:20] you know do the work of the evangelists
[1:09:22] and those kind of things and that's what
[1:09:23] he did even though he was a prophet
[1:09:25] he was doing the work of an evangelist
[1:09:27] but understand when
[1:09:29] time for the seals came that position
[1:09:31] changed he changed from an evangelist
[1:09:33] into a prophet
[1:09:34] hallelujah amen when he took the book
[1:09:38] or when god gave him the book is that
[1:09:40] right remember i told you excuse me
[1:09:42] when the lamb took the book out of the
[1:09:45] right hand
[1:09:46] of him that sat on the throne the bible
[1:09:48] said there was silence
[1:09:52] there was silence what was it the throne
[1:09:56] had changed position the word had now
[1:09:59] changed position
[1:10:00] it was no longer in the in the hands of
[1:10:02] the invisible it was in the hands of the
[1:10:04] one that was seen
[1:10:06] and john saw him and john was thinking
[1:10:09] he was looking at a a lamb
[1:10:11] and he turns and he sees a lion
[1:10:14] hallelujah
[1:10:15] so you got to understand by god's grace
[1:10:17] what was this lamb
[1:10:18] this lamb had the appearance of one that
[1:10:20] had was slain
[1:10:21] before the foundation of the world so
[1:10:23] this book was a bloody book
[1:10:27] hallelujah why because the lamb was
[1:10:30] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:10:32] and your name and my name was put in the
[1:10:34] book
[1:10:35] before the foundation of the world
[1:10:37] understand
[1:10:38] there's only one book hallelujah
[1:10:42] but listen when john took the book
[1:10:47] nothing happened
[1:10:50] when the lamb took the book i'm gonna go
[1:10:52] back there i said that wrong when the
[1:10:53] lamb took the book
[1:10:54] there was worship elders fell
[1:10:58] down and threw their crowns right
[1:11:01] because the lamb and the one who took he
[1:11:04] took the hand
[1:11:05] the book out of the hand of was the same
[1:11:07] they were god
[1:11:09] but when john took the book nothing
[1:11:12] happened
[1:11:14] there was silence because the angels
[1:11:18] can't worship god worship
[1:11:19] john the angels only worship god
[1:11:23] hallelujah remember when that cloud
[1:11:27] formed out there in arizona
[1:11:30] scientist says that that
[1:11:33] that that cloud formation lasted about
[1:11:36] 28 minutes about the space of a half
[1:11:41] hour
[1:11:44] and that that that john took did he do
[1:11:47] he said listen because god now telling
[1:11:50] brother branham
[1:11:50] you've got a part with these seven
[1:11:52] thunders you didn't know it
[1:11:55] but i need a body
[1:11:58] i need somebody to speak it for me
[1:12:01] come on and here was the prophet of god
[1:12:04] on the scene
[1:12:06] and those angels caught him up whoo
[1:12:12] into the constellation and he'd come
[1:12:15] back
[1:12:15] a different man but i'm gonna tell you
[1:12:18] when it really happened
[1:12:20] when the sword struck his hand
[1:12:23] god was saying i'm now
[1:12:26] changing positions
[1:12:30] i'm giving you my sword that's what i
[1:12:31] fight with not us or a king sword
[1:12:34] it wasn't two swords it was one sword
[1:12:36] and that sword was the word
[1:12:38] i'm finna give you the word that i've
[1:12:40] been using and what i use to defeat the
[1:12:43] devil
[1:12:44] in this last battle y'all hear me that's
[1:12:47] why we need the shields
[1:12:49] we need the thunders hallelujah and
[1:12:51] people say well it's a mystery i'm gonna
[1:12:53] tell you something now i'm gonna show
[1:12:54] you something what brother branham said
[1:12:56] because a lot of us still you know we
[1:12:58] remember when he first started he
[1:13:00] thought it was on the back of the book
[1:13:02] those thunders those you know the seas
[1:13:03] and all he thought it was something on
[1:13:05] extra it wasn't that natural because you
[1:13:06] can't add no take away
[1:13:08] but let me read it let me read it so
[1:13:09] you'll know where i'm coming from
[1:13:11] excuse me he said then back out there at
[1:13:14] the beginning of the seven seals
[1:13:16] when those seven angels come down in
[1:13:19] that pyramid
[1:13:20] stood there and told me to return back
[1:13:22] here
[1:13:23] and speak on those seven seals and he'll
[1:13:26] be with me
[1:13:27] he showed me what they were the lost
[1:13:30] things
[1:13:31] i always thought it was sealed on the
[1:13:33] back of the book
[1:13:35] and it'd be something wasn't wrote in
[1:13:37] the book
[1:13:38] but it turned out that it was made known
[1:13:42] that it cannot do that it isn't
[1:13:45] something that's written
[1:13:47] in the book it's something that's been
[1:13:50] hid in the book it has to be in here
[1:13:57] hallelujah for whosoever shall take one
[1:14:00] word from it or add one word to
[1:14:03] it you know brother bam said one day
[1:14:05] you'll find out where it's written
[1:14:07] it's in there but it's been hidden
[1:14:12] you say it can't be well acts 2 38 was
[1:14:14] hidden for what
[1:14:15] six uh uh 2 000 years it stood right
[1:14:19] there
[1:14:19] in the face of all man but the
[1:14:23] but the words were shut up
[1:14:26] there was no revelation being given to
[1:14:28] those
[1:14:29] that particular scripture at that time
[1:14:31] so it is a mystery that's been in the
[1:14:33] book in these
[1:14:34] seven church ages each one of them
[1:14:36] produced a mystery
[1:14:38] all about water baptism and these other
[1:14:40] things that they
[1:14:41] fumbled about so long then when that
[1:14:44] went up the big
[1:14:45] observatories from way down in
[1:14:48] california plumbed down in mexico
[1:14:50] over tucson everywhere taking the
[1:14:52] picture of it
[1:14:53] it was a mysterious sight brother fred
[1:14:56] salmon
[1:14:56] this sitting right back there and i and
[1:15:00] brother
[1:15:00] gene norman standing right there present
[1:15:04] when it went up they took the pictures
[1:15:06] still they don't know what
[1:15:08] what about what's about it here some
[1:15:10] time ago
[1:15:11] everybody's saying look here this look
[1:15:14] like this and
[1:15:15] and the angel swings and how they fold
[1:15:17] folded in there and y'all know you look
[1:15:19] at the pictures
[1:15:20] and you see all kinds of figures in
[1:15:21] there you see people with faces and
[1:15:23] all these kind of things and that's what
[1:15:25] gene norman was doing people were coming
[1:15:27] to look at brother branham there's more
[1:15:28] in this and more in there
[1:15:30] and even the prophet god didn't see what
[1:15:33] he saw later on
[1:15:34] two years everybody's examining that
[1:15:37] picture
[1:15:38] and still did not see who was standing
[1:15:41] there
[1:15:42] and one day turning one day
[1:15:47] turning it to the right looking there
[1:15:50] was jesus christ
[1:15:52] just as perfect as the hoffman ever
[1:15:54] drawed him
[1:15:55] remember i told you brother adam had
[1:15:57] seen it twice before
[1:15:58] once he saw jesus in the field y'all
[1:16:00] remember that
[1:16:01] and then he saw it at a brother's house
[1:16:03] one of the ministers saw
[1:16:04] that picture in a frame and now he's
[1:16:07] saying look
[1:16:08] look look oh my goodness three witnesses
[1:16:12] that really is him
[1:16:15] yeah hallelujah it was standing there
[1:16:18] with a white wig on looking back down
[1:16:21] toward the earth
[1:16:22] showing that he is supreme authority
[1:16:26] hallelujah
[1:16:30] with the white wig on you see his black
[1:16:33] beard
[1:16:34] under many of you have seen the picture
[1:16:38] we got it now understand that
[1:16:41] the pillow fire appeared to brother
[1:16:43] branham in 1933
[1:16:45] when he was baptizing in the ohio river
[1:16:48] and did you not know
[1:16:49] that that this hoffman head is painted
[1:16:53] or pictured
[1:16:54] uh jesus at the age of 33
[1:16:59] hallelujah and then later on after that
[1:17:02] in ohio it took 33 years for jesus to
[1:17:05] show up in the cloud
[1:17:09] and at what age did jesus go on be in
[1:17:12] glory
[1:17:12] 33. so anyway i thought that would be
[1:17:16] nice to hear
[1:17:18] the heavens declared it the bible
[1:17:19] declared it
[1:17:23] women it was just it was standing there
[1:17:26] with a white wig
[1:17:27] on looking back down toward the earth
[1:17:31] showing that he is supreme authority
[1:17:34] with the white wig on you see his black
[1:17:36] beard under
[1:17:37] many of you have seen the picture we got
[1:17:40] it back there
[1:17:40] just turn it to the right sideways look
[1:17:43] at it
[1:17:44] there he is just as perfect as he was
[1:17:47] if it had been a photograph of him
[1:17:51] they're looking at it from the wrong
[1:17:53] angle
[1:17:54] you got to turn it right to the right
[1:17:58] angle and only the lord god
[1:18:01] can reveal which is the right angle
[1:18:05] because of the picture only god can tell
[1:18:07] you the right angle
[1:18:08] hallelujah turn it to your right and
[1:18:11] look at it
[1:18:12] there he is just as perfect had it been
[1:18:15] photographed up there what was he saying
[1:18:19] he was doing the same thing i said this
[1:18:21] morning john the baptist
[1:18:23] identified jesus behold the lamb of god
[1:18:27] the same god with the elijah spirit on
[1:18:30] william branham
[1:18:31] identifies jesus christ but he's no
[1:18:34] longer on earth
[1:18:35] he's in heaven
[1:18:39] what was he doing as a headship called
[1:18:42] showing that the gospel have traveled
[1:18:44] from the east to the west
[1:18:46] hallelujah and now amen that the church
[1:18:50] has taken his full cycle
[1:18:52] and now it is his retire time to return
[1:18:56] hallelujah so this this uh christ
[1:18:59] coming amen in the clock is that right
[1:19:01] he said what do you mean brother books
[1:19:03] just like he did when he before he
[1:19:05] descended
[1:19:06] the bible said our sin excuse me before
[1:19:08] he ascended he sold his disciples why
[1:19:10] the angel said
[1:19:11] why are you gazing up why are you
[1:19:13] looking up
[1:19:14] he's going to return in the same like
[1:19:16] manner
[1:19:17] he ascended in the cloud right and
[1:19:19] therefore he descended in the cloud
[1:19:22] hallelujah is that the bible only he who
[1:19:24] will sin
[1:19:25] shall descend and that's what jesus did
[1:19:28] and it was a coming it was the beginning
[1:19:31] of the
[1:19:31] what we call the rapture and he's now
[1:19:34] amen producing himself
[1:19:36] making himself what transforming himself
[1:19:39] in you jesus christ
[1:19:42] in bright form
[1:19:47] oh but one of these old days
[1:19:50] we shall see him as he is and at that
[1:19:54] time
[1:19:54] it's over it's totally over
[1:19:58] there'll be a changing of the body
[1:20:00] hallelujah for mortal immortality
[1:20:03] this is what the message of you said
[1:20:05] well why why brothers why
[1:20:07] has it been so long because of the
[1:20:09] season
[1:20:11] hallelujah the way the word of god
[1:20:14] opened
[1:20:14] to us in 63 had to slow up
[1:20:18] it had to slow down for the events to
[1:20:21] take place
[1:20:22] they had to catch up with us and now we
[1:20:25] can see them already
[1:20:27] y'all hear what i'm saying they're
[1:20:28] caught up
[1:20:31] all that the prophet has preached is now
[1:20:34] the world is now the condition is now
[1:20:39] the world council of churches is now all
[1:20:42] of these things is now
[1:20:43] and what is it doing moving and if you
[1:20:45] have never seen it before
[1:20:47] you ought to see it now how the world
[1:20:49] one world order
[1:20:50] is about ready to take his position
[1:20:54] hallelujah and if that be the case the
[1:20:56] bride is about ready to take
[1:20:57] her position thank god for the grace of
[1:21:00] god
[1:21:01] and god is not going to just leave us
[1:21:03] this way there is a fresh
[1:21:04] anointing coming for the bride of jesus
[1:21:07] christ
[1:21:08] god won't leave you helpless
[1:21:11] hallelujah you love the lord now i'm
[1:21:14] going to quit with this
[1:21:15] because we got communion
[1:21:19] jude says in uh 124-25 now to him
[1:21:23] that is able to keep you are we seeing
[1:21:25] what i'm saying
[1:21:26] what i'm saying is that he's already
[1:21:30] come in such a mighty way
[1:21:33] and what he's done already should get
[1:21:35] the attraction attraction it should
[1:21:36] attract the bride
[1:21:38] is that right because when rebecca saw
[1:21:41] isaac from afar
[1:21:43] she leaped from a horse
[1:21:46] i mean a camel and i made it a horse and
[1:21:51] oh leap from her camel amen which
[1:21:53] brother bam said
[1:21:54] was a type of the rapture so you've left
[1:21:58] your
[1:21:58] and you're moving that same holy ghost
[1:22:01] brought you to see the face of isaac
[1:22:04] hallelujah and when when you got close
[1:22:07] enough either took you
[1:22:08] and what did you do showing you're
[1:22:10] submissive to the word
[1:22:11] you took your veil
[1:22:16] you understand me and then isaac took
[1:22:18] you into his mother's tent
[1:22:21] the old time way hallelujah
[1:22:25] oh glory to god we're getting ready for
[1:22:27] have a god hallelujah time
[1:22:29] now to him that is able to keep you from
[1:22:31] falling and to present you faultless
[1:22:32] before the presence of his glory
