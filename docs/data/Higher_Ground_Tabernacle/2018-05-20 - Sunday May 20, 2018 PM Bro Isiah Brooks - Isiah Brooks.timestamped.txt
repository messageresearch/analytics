[19:38] st. John one please I'm gonna have to
[19:42] preach this from the heart cuz my iPad
[19:46] went out on me never have I had it do
[19:53] that in the beginning I looked at like
[19:57] what no just a red line in the battery
[20:02] so by God's grace starting the first
[20:06] verse st. John first chapter in the
[20:13] beginning
[20:14] was the word and the Word was with God
[20:19] and the Word was God the same was in the
[20:24] beginning with God all things were made
[20:28] by him and without him was not anything
[20:31] made that was made
[20:33] in him was life and the life was the
[20:38] light of men and the light shine it in
[20:42] darkness and the darkness comprehended
[20:45] it not st. John 10:30
[21:00] I and my father I won then the Jews took
[21:09] up stones again to stone him and jesus
[21:13] answered then many good works have I
[21:15] showed you from My Father for which of
[21:18] those works do you stone me the Jews
[21:22] answered him saying for a good work we
[21:25] stone thee not but for blasphemy and
[21:28] because Dow because that thou being a
[21:33] man makest thyself God let us pray
[21:37] Heavenly Father we so thank you for your
[21:41] grace and your mercy we thank you for
[21:43] being so good to us Lord we need your
[21:47] guidance we need your anointing and
[21:51] father we just pray that you would speak
[21:55] to your people what you would have them
[21:57] to speak Lord we thank you right now
[22:00] have thine own way in Jesus Christ's
[22:02] name we pray amen you may be seated I
[22:10] like to entitle this message this book
[22:15] called the Bible when we think about
[22:19] what the devil is done and what he's
[22:22] trying to do throughout the ages we
[22:26] realized that the devil has tried to
[22:28] always stamp this out he has tried to
[22:33] render his own thoughts he's tried to
[22:38] add to it and he's tried to take away
[22:40] from it but God even stated in his word
[22:44] the grass may withers but the flower and
[22:47] the flowers fade away but the word of
[22:49] the Lord shall stand this Bible that we
[22:54] read is not just any book it is God in
[22:59] expression by word now we realize a man
[23:05] that God is so vast in his intelligence
[23:10] in its presence in his being he
[23:13] he does things that you and I can't even
[23:17] comprehend my fact the Bible says who
[23:21] knows the mind of God
[23:23] is there anybody that can instruct him
[23:27] because you see God Himself is the only
[23:31] potentate he is the only rule up he's
[23:36] the only authority and there are no one
[23:40] there is no one a man that can compare
[23:43] or compete with him when we think about
[23:50] this book called the Bible the about the
[23:53] people the intellectuals they they they
[23:57] want to reason with it but in this Bible
[24:01] contains such great mysteries that you
[24:04] and I would have never known about had
[24:07] not God mercy decided to unfold them to
[24:10] us you and I realized by God's grace
[24:14] amen that God as I said last week will
[24:18] exist it he listed he didn't exist by
[24:22] breathing because if he had to breathe
[24:24] he could die because perhaps he would
[24:27] run out of air hallelujah and then if
[24:30] there was air before God that means the
[24:33] air was God so we know that before there
[24:37] ever was anything God created it you and
[24:40] I in our minds we can't even comprehend
[24:42] it but the Bible tells us so you know
[24:46] what I dollar beer we have In God We
[24:48] Trust and the more we trust him dollar
[24:52] bill the less it becomes the worth of it
[24:55] seemed to dwell know him to disappear
[24:58] but one thing we really know that in
[25:01] this book we can trust why because the
[25:05] Bible tells us that in the beginning was
[25:08] the word the Word was with God in the
[25:11] Word was God
[25:12] this word is God but think about it at
[25:17] the same token you could burn and
[25:20] destroy this book but you could never
[25:22] burn and destroy God
[25:25] because the Bible tells us that God is a
[25:27] spirit hallelujah and the Bible tells us
[25:31] that no man have seen God at all at any
[25:33] time except the Sun hallelujah
[25:37] and you said well what do you mean
[25:39] brother Brooks let me say it like this
[25:41] God is such a spirit he is son he is so
[25:45] vast in his being I often think how can
[25:50] this great God come down in such a
[25:54] humble way he's always tried to make us
[26:02] know him and in this book in his mind he
[26:08] found a way hallelujah and in this way
[26:12] he lived that I could make my creation
[26:16] know me is that right - God always
[26:20] wanted to be known hallelujah and he
[26:25] always wanted his word to have
[26:27] preeminence over all of his creation is
[26:32] that right because remember Adam was uh
[26:36] an amateur god he was the one that God
[26:40] placed on this earth in this place
[26:43] called Eden and the Bible tells us that
[26:45] God told Adam this is yours and I want
[26:48] you to subdue if there be anything that
[26:52] get out of order you put it back in
[26:54] order is he God knew that the serpent
[26:58] would be in the garden so God told him
[27:01] listen I want you to be in policeman of
[27:03] this place I want you to be the supreme
[27:06] authority over this place and if
[27:09] anything get out of order you put it
[27:11] back in line
[27:12] says listen I've given you the power to
[27:15] speak I'm giving you the power of
[27:17] intelligence I've given you the power
[27:19] the same power I have I've given it unto
[27:22] you you are God I am God of heaven and
[27:25] you are God of the earth
[27:28] what's in this book hallelujah
[27:33] in this book it tells
[27:37] where we came from and where we're going
[27:40] hallelujah and that's one of the things
[27:43] that never don't want us to know he
[27:45] don't want us to know our origin he
[27:47] doesn't want us to know where we're
[27:49] going after we leave here why because he
[27:53] carried the keys he was carried the keys
[27:57] hallelujah
[27:58] there was a time to devil could tell if
[28:00] I'm in just by way of death hallelujah
[28:04] but after Jesus came that's what's in
[28:07] the book every answer to the devil's
[28:10] questions is in this book
[28:12] hallelujah we realize he meant God
[28:16] greatest mystery wasn't Adam it may have
[28:21] been to the Angels they may have been
[28:23] shocked when God formed Adam but
[28:27] remember the prophet of God said Adam
[28:29] first was formed spiritual man and he
[28:32] was out of in the spirit leaving me
[28:34] animals like the Holy Ghost means us but
[28:37] God amen wanted to have fellowship with
[28:40] his creation he never wanted to be an
[28:43] invisible God he wanted to be visible
[28:45] and God knew that the only way that he
[28:48] could ever make the animals know Adam
[28:50] and she adamant asked Adam
[28:52] he had a big atom man hallelujah but
[28:57] your illumina he was first created in
[29:00] the image of God which was spirit
[29:02] hallelujah and then God came and formed
[29:06] Adam out of dusty earth hallelujah
[29:08] like I was telling everybody now I said
[29:10] you know people think that when God a
[29:12] man for man he just bent over and began
[29:15] to form him out of the dust but no show
[29:18] hallelujah when God saw a man a man he's
[29:21] dead Adams good man hallelujah amen and
[29:26] there God began to form the man
[29:28] hallelujah he was a tree and the tree
[29:31] don't go down he grows up hallelujah he
[29:34] said well what do you mean out of your
[29:36] tree tree now don't you know that in
[29:40] this book tells us that we are trees
[29:43] hallelujah now Israel is the fig tree
[29:47] right
[29:49] and you hear about Lebanon this tree in
[29:51] that tree hallelujah in the garden there
[29:53] was a tree of knowledge good and even we
[29:55] knew who know who that is
[29:56] that was Satan but man in the in the
[30:00] garden there was another tree and that
[30:03] tree colony was an odd other that tree
[30:06] of life hallelujah now if there was a
[30:09] tree of life there had to be another one
[30:11] somewhere hallelujah
[30:14] because remember before Eve seeing she
[30:17] was a tree of life because Adam was a
[30:19] tree of life Alleluia and because of sin
[30:22] she the woman became the tree of death
[30:24] you said what do you mean because by by
[30:28] the woman every man died hallelujah oh
[30:33] come on somebody but this is the part
[30:36] I'm saying like I said the other day
[30:37] that little tree that tree of life had
[30:41] to produce his own kind hallelujah
[30:45] so there had to be another tree and we
[30:49] had a prophet coming in our day because
[30:51] we never knew that there was a bride
[30:53] tree hallelujah we never knew that there
[30:56] was another another tree somewhere that
[30:59] had the coming to him us to state in
[31:02] order to produce her children
[31:05] hallelujah it's in the book that's
[31:09] what's in the book the mystery of the
[31:12] Gentiles the place they play of the part
[31:16] they play in this great drama hallelujah
[31:19] you see it is a drama you know Luda is
[31:23] God acting himself out hallelujah what
[31:26] do you do
[31:27] oh I said to myself amen in this book
[31:30] called the Bible shows us that in our
[31:34] bloodline which is 100% victorious
[31:38] hallelujah
[31:39] we are conquerors and Paul said we're
[31:42] more than conquerors in this book called
[31:45] the Bible that's why the devil don't
[31:48] want us to read this but David said I'm
[31:51] gonna meditate on him both day and night
[31:54] hallelujah because when we meditate on
[31:56] God you begin to collect God's talks
[31:59] hallelujah
[32:01] you begin
[32:01] you you move out of this ramp into
[32:04] another Ram hallelujah and you began to
[32:07] see and hear what God wants you to hear
[32:09] on earth hallelujah is that right that's
[32:13] why David I love it I tell you what
[32:15] David well think about David he
[32:18] understood who his God was hallelujah
[32:21] when David was in a pit he said Lord
[32:24] deliver me from this horrible pit when
[32:26] David had enemies he said Lord deliver
[32:29] me from my enemies amen David knew where
[32:32] to turn - the answer to your problems is
[32:36] in this book hallelujah you don't have
[32:39] to turn to a man you turned to the man
[32:41] that's higher than the man hallelujah
[32:43] and that's Christ Jesus it's in the milk
[32:46] hallelujah like I said they say In God
[32:49] We Trust in god we trust'
[32:52] hallelujah man all glory to God you say
[32:58] well brother Brooks I'm gonna tell you
[33:00] something I am a warrior I was born a
[33:05] warrior hallelujah
[33:08] what do you mean sometime and just take
[33:11] god to push you push you in a corner so
[33:15] that you can come out fighting
[33:16] hallelujah
[33:18] think about sham God sham God Amen was
[33:21] just a little fellow who was tired of
[33:24] the Philistines coming and just stealing
[33:26] stealing all of their crops and all that
[33:28] kind of stuff kind of like a Gideon you
[33:29] know remember the Bible says that sham
[33:32] God took an ox gore y'all know the odds
[33:36] glorious it's just a stick wood upon it
[33:40] into it hallelujah
[33:42] so when that onto that cow whatever one
[33:44] movie just punch him a little bit with
[33:46] him he's no mean it kind of moving move
[33:48] a little right Amen but this same God
[33:52] Amen took her ox gored y'all believe it
[33:55] do you really believe him in what we
[33:57] call a paradox that's what I am I am a
[34:01] paradox
[34:02] how God can take a sinner like me and
[34:05] make me a saint
[34:06] oh it's unexplainable but it's true
[34:10] hallelujah how God can take a ranch at
[34:13] heart like mine and
[34:15] aegeon in a moment i'm hallelujah
[34:17] scientist can't explain it but is true
[34:22] hallelujah that's what's in the book
[34:25] this book called the Bible it's the
[34:28] greatest book ever written hallelujah
[34:31] tells the greatest love stories ever
[34:33] written hallelujah
[34:35] oh come on y'all know it Romeo and
[34:37] Juliet somebody been reading their
[34:39] Bibles hallelujah I don't care what the
[34:44] fairytale is the foundation of all love
[34:47] stories is in this book
[34:49] hallelujah and the greatest love story
[34:52] ever is with E
[34:56] Adam Towey I don't want to live in
[34:59] Paradise without you hallelujah
[35:04] Donna Regan sings a song like that I
[35:06] don't want to live in Paradise without
[35:09] you hallelujah
[35:11] even though I've got all of this
[35:14] I got trees that beautiful birds I got
[35:18] everything and you messed up you sin but
[35:22] I don't want to live in Paradise without
[35:24] you hallelujah and you gotta realize him
[35:27] and that's exactly what Jesus did help
[35:30] him gave everything up because he didn't
[35:33] want to live alone he did not want to
[35:36] live in Paradise without his wife
[35:38] hallelujah and though Jesus was king of
[35:41] kings and Lord of lords he owned
[35:43] everything he still came insane on
[35:47] Calvary I don't want to live in paradise
[35:50] without you heaven will never be heaven
[35:53] if you're not there that's my god think
[36:01] about it a paradox how god that's what
[36:06] I'm saying we talk about paradox you
[36:08] think about how God said amen to
[36:10] turtle.turtle Moses Amen why are you
[36:13] crying I want you to speak to me
[36:15] hallelujah
[36:16] here it was a paradise see that's what
[36:19] I'm saying because once you see who you
[36:21] are you stop looking at the natural and
[36:24] look into the spiritual that's what
[36:26] meditating on God will do for you
[36:29] attention from this human element and
[36:32] bring you into heavenly places in Christ
[36:35] Jesus and once you see who you are
[36:39] everybody gets what you began to think
[36:41] differently hallelujah o Moses don't be
[36:46] calling down it's not time to be coddled
[36:49] it's time to cross over hallelujah all
[36:52] you've got to do is speak the word
[36:55] hallelujah hallelujah and guess what
[36:59] Moses and I has this we've got the same
[37:02] DNA hallelujah oh man
[37:05] so if Moses in his DNA is his makeup he
[37:09] had the power and the strength amen to
[37:11] connect with the Heavenly Father and
[37:13] bring forth the division through the Red
[37:17] Sea
[37:18] I often wonder I often wonder when Moses
[37:23] said stuck out his rods I don't know how
[37:27] to fish knew but they had to back it up
[37:32] whatever was crossing between that
[37:35] dividing line they had to spend steal
[37:37] holiday no doubt in my mind
[37:41] amen as those children of Israel was
[37:44] crossing the sea they probably seen
[37:46] little fishies in all kinds of stuff
[37:47] honey
[37:49] standing behind that wall amen it was a
[37:52] paradox hallelujah but God did it
[37:55] hallelujah and how did he do it through
[37:57] a man mallalieu yo that the prophet of
[38:01] God said it wasn't a mystery of God
[38:03] wasn't that God was making man was
[38:05] making himself from a God but it was God
[38:08] making himself a man hallelujah and in
[38:11] the beginning we know though that the
[38:12] word became flesh hallelujah little bee
[38:16] Indians that the flesh is becoming word
[38:18] the devil understand Amen that he knows
[38:21] this book is not only telling our past
[38:25] present but our future hallelujah Jesus
[38:29] caught the same yesterday today and
[38:31] forever his bride to see yesterday today
[38:35] and forever
[38:36] why because she and him they are one
[38:40] when Jesus said that hi my father won
[38:42] Amen it was true hallelujah he did
[38:45] everything the father told him to do
[38:47] come on salat it he said now listen I
[38:49] have done all these works and you still
[38:53] want to stone me they said no no no no
[38:56] we don't want to stone you because you
[38:57] can work we know you've done good things
[38:58] but now you just crossed the line boy

[39:03] evil

[44:30] times but I gave Peter the key and

[44:50] you say wait a minute brother how can

[45:00] my two sons one of them sit on the right
[45:03] hand and one sit on the left and you say

[45:26] you mean to tell me I can be healed I am
[45:29] healed ain't know if I can be I am
[45:32] healed because if I would tells me two
[45:39] thousand years ago he died for my shares
[45:41] and the Bible said with this strike I am
[45:44] here what about my liquidy i/o he's
[45:48] forgiven me of my iniquity and what is
[45:51] iniquity when you know to do good and
[45:56] you don't do it when you willfully sin
[45:58] I'm covered by the blood hallelujah is
[46:04] in the book
[46:05] I believe it and in God We Trust y'all
[46:09] hear me I have nothing else to do but
[46:11] trust this book the hidden things that
[46:17] ever just didn't well you know we would
[46:18] call Gentile dogs one time hallelujah
[46:21] but it was damn dogs that God loved
[46:25] hallelujah he took a gentile dog and
[46:28] made him a king in priests hey it's a
[46:32] paradox you can't explain it but it's
[46:38] true in it how hallelujah why how in the
[46:42] world
[46:42] Amen that you can be who you are because
[46:45] he was always in the book hallelujah
[46:49] Amen is that right oh we can't get away
[46:52] from it you cannot get away from it
[46:55] that's why brother Bama told me he said
[46:57] even if a man down drunkard he's got the
[46:59] Holy Ghost he say because God would
[47:03] never give it to you and didn't take it
[47:05] from you cuz that seal is a seal to the
[47:11] day of your Redemption hallelujah and it
[47:14] cannot be broken
[47:18] lower the God ain't God good to us
[47:21] hallelujah I said that because people
[47:23] think because you got the Holy Ghost you
[47:25] not tempted and you don't fall and you
[47:26] don't have shortcoming that's a lie from
[47:28] the devil hallelujah the only time we
[47:31] will work
[47:32] all completely perfect is when this body
[47:34] have changed from water to the
[47:36] immortality and then we'll see how
[47:38] fooling completed option hallelujah oh
[47:42] but it does not give you excuse to sin
[47:45] so we can send that shall we send that
[47:48] grace made about God forbid we do with
[47:52] the best we can by his power and by his
[47:55] life hallelujah some of us are weak
[47:58] some of us are strong some of us a
[47:59] feeble some of us got all kinds of
[48:01] conditions but only inside of the heart
[48:04] Oh God is in there hallelujah I love it
[48:08] I love it I love it who is in the book
[48:12] and in god we trust'
[48:16] [Applause]
[48:19] don't you realize Amen what God is doing
[48:23] and what God has done hallelujah we say
[48:27] what do you see them brother listen the
[48:29] Bible says that in whom are here all
[48:32] treasures of wisdom and let me just read
[48:34] it
[48:34] listen uh I'm gonna say it let me see
[48:39] where I want us to hide for I would that
[48:42] you know what great conflict I have for
[48:46] you I'm from them at Laodicea and for as
[48:49] many as have not sent seeing my face in
[48:52] the flesh you know every time I read
[48:53] that I think about our day now there was
[48:55] a layer to see you back then but I
[48:57] always think about our day that Paul is
[48:59] literally writing this this thing to us
[49:03] that their hearts might be comforted
[49:05] being knit together in love and unto all
[49:08] riches of the full assurance of
[49:11] understanding to the acknowledged of the
[49:14] mystery of God and of the Father and of
[49:16] Christ no other age could have seen that
[49:19] hallelujah it is this age that God has
[49:22] given us this understanding hallelujah
[49:25] he may have wrote it but we got the
[49:26] revelation of it certain things could
[49:29] not be understood but they had to
[49:31] believe it in how when when Isaiah said
[49:34] behold a virgin cooks care will conceive
[49:37] he didn't understand it but he believed
[49:40] it because he realized he was not the
[49:42] one that spoke it it was God speaking
[49:44] through him
[49:45] oh come on somebody if God said he's
[49:48] gonna have a perfect Church his church
[49:50] is perfect you see what brother books
[49:52] I'm perfect not over yourself
[49:54] no man is like there is no man that's
[49:58] holy uh-huh what holy man
[50:01] if the Pharisees the Bible said our
[50:04] righteousness must exceed the righteous
[50:06] of the Pharisees how are we gonna make
[50:08] it there was nobody who practice and
[50:10] live like those people did hallelujah
[50:13] they jot every that they got every tired
[50:16] and crossed every T come on somebody
[50:19] they were so sanctified amen they stole
[50:22] everything that looked dirty remember
[50:25] the man that was from Jericho that the
[50:28] Samaritan when they saw him they walked
[50:31] all the way on the other side of the
[50:33] street hallelujah but the brother said
[50:36] our righteousness must succeed that when
[50:40] I was in the Apostolic Church because
[50:42] that's the way we will we worked our
[50:43] salvation we had to do this and do that
[50:45] and do this and do that and I didn't
[50:46] understand them like Lord ain't no way I
[50:48] could've helped do them Pharisee
[50:49] but then when I realize what
[50:52] righteousness he was talking about
[50:53] earlier the Bible said he became sick
[50:57] that I might become the righteousness of
[50:59] God ha ha that's the only way we could
[51:02] ever supersede him is that we put all
[51:05] the righteousness of God with you so
[51:08] Holy Ghost
[51:11] hallelujah it's in the ball with the
[51:17] devil trying to make you give up don't
[51:18] give up I know sometimes we want to quit
[51:20] you know like Samson Samson the lusts of
[51:24] the flesh never they had him so hard and
[51:26] so bad a man he just went on crazy
[51:28] because of Delilah at the end of the day
[51:33] like Delilah had an appetizer hallelujah
[51:37] that was a wake-up call now he sees his
[51:44] condition but sometimes God has allowed
[51:47] things to happen to you to see your
[51:49] control you can see your condition and
[51:51] then when you do see your condition you
[51:53] don't get mad at God you described Oh
[51:56] Lord once more
[51:59] that's what you got have mercy on me
[52:02] Lord once more is in the book did God
[52:07] come on the scene when he cried out if
[52:10] you cry out to God God or come on the
[52:13] scene whoa but you can't be shame about
[52:17] it you got to cry out that's why I love
[52:21] this Bible because when the unknown and
[52:23] fell all those people in the New and Old
[52:26] Testament went blind Bartimaeus heard
[52:29] that Jesus was coming by the Holy Ghost
[52:31] had not even put being poured out yet
[52:33] huh is that right you know those few say
[52:43] shut up or blind whatever you know I
[52:46] would usually do if the food word but
[52:48] not but you know that's what they say
[52:50] huh and he didn't care he cried them all
[52:57] the old me and do you think that Jesus
[53:01] heard him in all that noise he didn't
[53:04] hear that a man but up there the God of
[53:08] heaven heard him and all of a sudden he
[53:13] was another man who stopped the Sun
[53:15] [Laughter]
[53:18] Joshua stopped the Sun and so did blind
[53:21] Bartimaeus hallelujah but by the man
[53:24] stop the soe in hallelujah oh my and he
[53:28] turned around and said what would you
[53:31] have them me Oh see that's what I'm
[53:34] saying
[53:35] when you get into that place you don't
[53:36] care who you are I don't owe the Lord so
[53:38] many time when you ready to refill me I
[53:40] don't care if it's in a grocery store
[53:41] they don't think I'm crazy anyhow do
[53:43] whatever you need to do but just don't
[53:45] let my pride get in the way
[53:46] hallelujah if I feel you're nodding and
[53:49] you want me to do so I don't care what
[53:51] just don't let my pride get away
[53:55] hallelujah
[53:56] that's what happened I think was that my
[53:57] screw that time there we didn't know
[53:59] nothing about homelessness but they said
[54:01] that girl had a fit in the hall it
[54:03] wasn't even have no fear she got the
[54:06] holy God filled with the Holy Ghost
[54:10] while she was going down the hallway
[54:13] taking on the Lord and the rumor went
[54:18] out she had a fear later when I found
[54:22] out what happened hallelujah I don't
[54:25] care where he wants to do it do it at
[54:27] all
[54:28] y'all know why I'm crying out like this
[54:30] because we got to trust this we got to
[54:33] trust a word with every every every part
[54:35] of our hearts because you see this
[54:38] earthquake I mean these things happening
[54:40] in in Hawaii and everybody's looking
[54:45] back like it's just just another thing
[54:48] but don't you know where her why he is
[54:51] Hawaii is out there with the Ring of
[54:53] Fire
[54:54] and now 383 one volcano has turned into
[54:57] three outlets and it's spilling out lava
[55:01] not a little bit either I understand me
[55:04] and if there's this lava coming what am
[55:07] I trying to say there's got to be
[55:09] pressure somewhere pressure somewhere
[55:12] because this pressure is causing this
[55:15] volcano to let the pressure off

[59:51] land now the scientists call it
[59:53] continental drift
[59:55] but the Bible says in the day when the
[59:58] continents divided it's in the book
[1:00:02] hallelujah who divided them God did
[1:00:06] hallelujah
[1:00:07] are used to understand I didn't have no
[1:00:09] boats and all of this stuff how do these
[1:00:11] people get here and how these people
[1:00:12] because when it does the contantly
[1:00:14] divided the people are stuck like child
[1:00:17] they couldn't do nothing but stay where
[1:00:19] they were
[1:00:25] Miriah what was God doing forming
[1:00:28] Nations he was forming nations
[1:00:33] hallelujah because in his mind he knew
[1:00:37] that he was gonna choose a nation that
[1:00:40] nation was going to be Israel and he had
[1:00:42] to have enemies hallelujah somebody said
[1:00:49] well America is not in the book yes she
[1:00:51] is revelation the third thing she was
[1:00:54] always there hallelujah chuckles a
[1:01:00] prophet to tell us who she was how it
[1:01:03] became why you see the way she is
[1:01:06] hallelujah
[1:01:07] but as long as we bless Israel no matter
[1:01:10] how bad we are God will have mercy on us
[1:01:14] but the very day we turned from her the
[1:01:17] bomb will drop is that right because
[1:01:22] every time we do evil to Israel God
[1:01:24] comes right back and do the same to us
[1:01:27] we made Israel give up certain lands
[1:01:30] with their burial sites and everything
[1:01:31] else and God calls that hurricane to
[1:01:33] come in here
[1:01:34] what was hard Katrina or whatever it was
[1:01:37] whatever was the name of us and they'll
[1:01:40] tell you in Louisiana they had coffins
[1:01:42] floating down the river more than one
[1:01:47] could we up made them uproot them
[1:01:50] they're dead and God came in uprooted
[1:01:52] ours feel like shouting it's in the book
[1:02:01] you tired of that devil huh you and I
[1:02:06] must understand that devil gotta end he
[1:02:08] knows it but we don't have an ear is in
[1:02:13] the book the devil will be destroyed one
[1:02:16] of these old days that same old guy a
[1:02:21] man like me in a brother say are you the
[1:02:24] one I'll be right there with you brother
[1:02:28] Marshall are you the one you the one
[1:02:35] they called me all that trouble
[1:02:39] can y'all matter that I don't know who
[1:02:42] that one angel is that throws them too
[1:02:45] late maybe it's Jesus I don't know who
[1:02:47] it is
[1:02:47] I don't know who it is but can you
[1:02:50] imagine the great honor that is for that
[1:02:53] angel to take the devil and throw him in
[1:02:57] the lake of fire you think it's gonna be
[1:03:00] weeping and wailing it might be weeping
[1:03:02] and wailing but it'll be for chalky for
[1:03:07] joy you said but it ain't in the book
[1:03:09] yes it is
[1:03:10] even in the book of Esther Esther it's a
[1:03:13] powerful book Esther Esther Esther
[1:03:15] exactly tells us where we are today
[1:03:18] because if you read after you find out
[1:03:21] that God is not mentioned in that book
[1:03:25] it's a age of progress for me we're men
[1:03:29] a glorifying themselves hallelujah now
[1:03:34] Israel isn't it which is tied to the
[1:03:37] bride but she's got no play really other
[1:03:40] than she's got the Queen you know think
[1:03:43] about this now it's a paradox that God
[1:03:47] would take this little woman uh I can
[1:03:54] adesso
[1:03:55] it mean that God would take adesso and
[1:03:58] not only change her from that name of
[1:04:01] bring her back up to what we call Esther
[1:04:03] which is a style y'all heard that the
[1:04:05] other night but look at this God is
[1:04:07] showing you that there's a
[1:04:08] transformation that will take place and
[1:04:10] a change of position from a proper to a
[1:04:15] queen hallelujah
[1:04:17] shows us that and not only that it shows
[1:04:20] us our part that we will be the cause of
[1:04:23] Satan's defeat because Haman represented
[1:04:28] Satan and all of Satan's children
[1:04:31] hallelujah was destroyed and who did it
[1:04:36] Esther Esther say
[1:04:42] listen King we don't got rid of Haman
[1:04:45] but it ain't done yet as long as we
[1:04:47] leave it leave his offspring living
[1:04:49] hallelujah we gonna always have trouble
[1:04:51] I think we need to kill them too
[1:04:53] hallelujah and the Bible said all none
[1:04:57] of the evildoer do is with prosper the
[1:04:59] seed of the evildoer will be destroyed
[1:05:04] and we'll have our hand in it but
[1:05:08] because we judge Haman we judge the
[1:05:12] devil did Esther judge the devil
[1:05:14] hallelujah and winning told God who was
[1:05:17] the king this guy ain't no friend he's
[1:05:21] he's he's conniving behind your back
[1:05:25] he's plotting he's doing this he's doing
[1:05:27] that he just plan it out because he want
[1:05:30] to destroy the raw your seed that's what
[1:05:32] it's all about is in the book oh god we
[1:05:40] trust'
[1:05:42] hallelujah God said he's gonna have a
[1:05:45] church without spot wrinkle or blemish I
[1:05:51] was wondering I says now I understand a
[1:05:53] spot and a wrinkle is when you're
[1:05:56] sitting down on God see when you sit
[1:06:00] down you get wrinkles you're not doing
[1:06:03] that you just sit but this church ain't
[1:06:05] got gonna be like that she won't just be
[1:06:06] sitting down relaxing and resting she's
[1:06:09] about her father's business y'all hear
[1:06:11] me no spot wrinkle or blemish hallelujah
[1:06:17] closed out on this Scripture Hebrews
[1:06:23] 10:14 for by one offering he had
[1:06:28] perfected forever them that are
[1:06:31] sanctified it's a paradox so it's really
[1:06:44] hard to get this mind to really digest
[1:06:47] that I'm not asking you this I'm saying
[1:06:49] take it a minute that's right all you
[1:06:52] have to say amen so be it law letter B
[1:06:55] according to thy word
[1:06:56] hallelujah that's what we're doing he's
[1:06:59] your brother
[1:07:02] that's the scripture the Lord saved me
[1:07:05] when he saved me he took me to Psalms 32
[1:07:08] amen
[1:07:10] blessed is the man whom God will not
[1:07:12] impute sin you know cuz many times now
[1:07:16] I'm telling you I know he's proven
[1:07:18] himself God has never dealt with me
[1:07:23] according to my iniquity ever ever and I
[1:07:31] always forget he told me that and then I
[1:07:34] heard brother brother said that's the
[1:07:36] bride I say whoo but there's a brother
[1:07:43] in in South America he gets so excited
[1:07:45] he say is that good you got to give a
[1:07:53] sorry sound
[1:07:54] oh my and when you think about how good
[1:07:57] God is to us all we got to do is
[1:08:00] patiently wait patience is a virtue of
[1:08:08] God and that's what he tries to teach
[1:08:11] his children to wait listen people if
[1:08:15] you don't wait what you're gonna turn to
[1:08:18] even if you go back you still gotta wait
[1:08:21] if you decide I'm not serving God no
[1:08:24] more what are you doing wasting time
[1:08:27] because you can't do it God has to do it
[1:08:30] but those who wait upon the Lord it's in
[1:08:35] the book if you wait upon the Lord the
[1:08:41] Bible said he will renew your strength
[1:08:45] so it's good to wait hallelujah your arm
[1:08:50] may be broken but i'ma wait on the dark
[1:08:52] man your leg may be broken but i'ma wait
[1:08:54] on the doctor
[1:08:55] you understand me ain't gonna try to fix
[1:08:57] it myself because I don't know how to I
[1:09:00] am gonna wait to the physician get here
[1:09:03] to do it so if my heart is broken I'm
[1:09:07] gonna wait because
[1:09:10] promised to give me a new high if my
[1:09:13] mind is corrupt if my mind has no peace
[1:09:17] the Bible said I will grant you perfect
[1:09:22] peace those whose mind is stayed on me
[1:09:26] so when I have in trouble
[1:09:29] in my mind it's messing with me I'm
[1:09:33] gonna turn to one scripture there's many
[1:09:36] I could turn to
[1:09:37] but there is one scripture that always
[1:09:40] stands out in my mind Psalms 23 let us
[1:09:44] read it over there God Dave is telling
[1:10:01] you something here
[1:10:02] beautiful people alien he's telling you
[1:10:06] something the Lord is my shepherd let's
[1:10:11] see that all together the Lord is my
[1:10:13] shepherd I shall not want he maketh me
[1:10:17] to lie down in green pastures he leadeth
[1:10:20] me beside the still waters he restoreth
[1:10:23] my soul he leadeth me in the paths of
[1:10:26] righteousness for his name's sake
[1:10:28] yea though I walk through the valley of
[1:10:30] the shadow of death I will fear no evil
[1:10:32] for thou art with me thy rod and thy
[1:10:36] staff they comfort me now prepares the
[1:10:39] table before me in the presence of my
[1:10:41] enemy now I've known it's my head with
[1:10:44] oil my cup runneth over surely goodness
[1:10:47] and mercy shall all the days of my life
[1:10:51] and I will dwell in the house of the
[1:10:54] Lord forever what comforts me huh what
[1:11:01] comforts me thy rod and thy staff this
[1:11:04] is where we supposed to gain our
[1:11:06] conference when we go any other place to
[1:11:09] be comforted you will not receive the
[1:11:12] conference you're looking for this is
[1:11:15] the encouragement this is the conference
[1:11:17] you must find scripture to comfort you
[1:11:20] it's in there
[1:11:21] he wrote it especially for you
[1:11:24] every moment of distress or whatever you
[1:11:28] go through you say God just showed me
[1:11:30] where to turn give me a word to
[1:11:32] encourage me I guarantee you gotta do
[1:11:34] just that and when you read it don't get
[1:11:38] shocked like oh he's talking to me
[1:11:40] yeah he's talking to you know In God We
[1:11:46] Trust in closing brother Branham says
[1:11:52] you ought to read a chapter every
[1:11:56] morning every night that's your
[1:12:01] relationship and he said when you read
[1:12:03] it he said you read it like God is
[1:12:06] talking to you
[1:12:09] now don't go somewhere amen in the Bible
[1:12:12] where they got all this genealogy and
[1:12:14] say love because that's history is
[1:12:21] history
[1:12:22] you need something that's going to work
[1:12:23] with you today hallelujah you know that
[1:12:27] was one of the reason why I didn't read
[1:12:28] the Bible for a long time because
[1:12:31] somehow the devil had me turn with all
[1:12:33] that gee lividity didn't understand that
[1:12:36] but every now and again uh and ah yeah
[1:12:42] didn't know didn't know we could just oh
[1:12:45] I can't understand I say that I can't
[1:12:48] understand cuz I was reading Amen 12th
[1:12:53] grade level and I hear I was not even
[1:12:56] kindergarten right so you look at these
[1:13:00] things and you said lord give me a word
[1:13:01] you do you really believe that he's your
[1:13:03] father
[1:13:04] do you believe that God is your headship
[1:13:06] with this book this word is your head
[1:13:08] chef so you go there and just Lord teach
[1:13:12] me I gave it to you if you follow the
[1:13:15] formula a chapter in the morning in our
[1:13:18] chapter at night and pray while you're
[1:13:21] doing it I guarantee you your love for
[1:13:23] the word will increase and your love for
[1:13:26] God will increase and you'll begin to
[1:13:28] see things change in your life you got
[1:13:30] to feed yourself and sometimes the devil
[1:13:33] discourage us because we try to read a
[1:13:35] whole book
[1:13:36] no read one chapter I don't care if it's
[1:13:39] like this in Psalms that's all you got
[1:13:42] to read read it and meditate on it and
[1:13:44] say Lord speak to me he'll do it here do
[1:13:50] it and maybe
[1:13:52] Amen maybe when you while you're doing
[1:13:53] it you know you don't feel nothing you
[1:13:55] don't have to but eventually it's like
[1:13:57] anything right you know you take a baby
[1:14:00] when you when you work with a baby
[1:14:01] you're taking that baby off of that off
[1:14:03] of that formula or that milk and giving
[1:14:07] the table food on you know what they got
[1:14:09] in the jar now that baby normally spit
[1:14:11] more out of the mouth than you didn't
[1:14:12] want you you put a spoonful in and they
[1:14:14] put they they spit about two or three
[1:14:17] two-thirds of the schools were back out
[1:14:19] now what you do you take that thing and
[1:14:21] rip around loves me get it get it get it
[1:14:24] and you keep pushing it in there till
[1:14:26] they learn how to grab the whole spoon
[1:14:29] that's how God is right he'll give you a
[1:14:32] scripture and sometimes you spit it more
[1:14:34] out than the end but that little bit
[1:14:36] still worked but he don't want you to
[1:14:38] just have a little bit here keep I love
[1:14:41] it I still love taking that spoon around
[1:14:42] it just looked like others like that
[1:14:44] amen feeding babies I like that
[1:14:47] but you know it's amazing by God's grace
[1:14:50] that's how he works
[1:14:51] he's patience with us and He loves us
[1:14:55] but he wants you to trust this and make
[1:14:58] this become like I was telling somebody
[1:15:00] tonight today and the closing I said
[1:15:02] yeah they tried to destroy this they
[1:15:03] don't hybrid it they done gave it every
[1:15:05] kind of version there is but the bride
[1:15:08] of Jesus Christ is the original version
[1:15:10] of the word God wrote his own word in
[1:15:14] our flesh on tables of flesh he said I
[1:15:19] put my laws in their heart whoo that's
[1:15:24] dad I know I have kept you
[1:15:26] I tried not
[1:15:30] call people's names out when people help
[1:15:32] me only because two things I don't want
[1:15:35] in experience it's all about God and not
[1:15:38] about individuals you love the Lord and
[1:15:42] like I try to tell my friends when me
[1:15:44] and brother Craig's talking I said well
[1:15:46] it's mine now or vice versa he said well
[1:15:50] it's mine now I said that's what the
[1:15:52] Bible said we supposed to do yeah our
[1:15:55] conversation is supposed to be around
[1:15:56] the word and when we give each other
[1:15:59] thoughts about what God has done it's no
[1:16:01] longer yours you just gave it to me God
[1:16:04] talking to God amen boom I feel good
