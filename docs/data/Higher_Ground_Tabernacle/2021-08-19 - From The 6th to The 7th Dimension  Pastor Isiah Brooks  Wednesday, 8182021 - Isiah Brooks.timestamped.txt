[12:43] [Music]
[12:50] needs challenging a couple weeks
[12:56] in my body
[12:58] with it but
[13:00] to walk from there to there just a
[13:02] straight line was not an
[13:04] easy thing to do like
[13:07] god
[13:08] reminded me
[13:10] every step of the way that
[13:12] he's a high priest of my confession
[13:15] and i i depended on
[13:17] that so much it was uh

[13:24] now

[13:57] body and my blood i
[13:59] never had it before and
[14:03] but that's just a simple explanation
[14:08] god loves me so much

[37:43] word of god
[37:45] thank you i feel like singing but i
[37:46] don't have much voice
[37:49] maybe after the service by god's grace
[37:51] after the preaching
[37:53] uh we uh had a wonderful time up in
[37:56] in the uh michigan camp meeting and
[37:59] i did a lot of screaming and a lot of
[38:01] holiday
[38:02] a lot of dancing and a lot of shouting
[38:06] and uh so it was really wonderful it was
[38:08] far more than
[38:10] uh
[38:10] why what i expected even the people said
[38:13] that they had not seen the move of god
[38:14] like that in a while so
[38:16] god was refreshing everybody there was
[38:18] such a love
[38:20] that god
[38:21] gave many people were filled with the
[38:23] holy ghost young and old
[38:25] uh those of you who don't believe in
[38:28] being slain there were some slain in the
[38:29] spirit and
[38:31] it was a wonderful wonderful wonderful
[38:33] meeting and
[38:35] i just wished everybody here was there
[38:38] that's all i could think about this
[38:40] church being there i just wish
[38:42] it wasn't possible but uh
[38:45] who knows maybe next year if the lord
[38:46] terry
[38:48] because i know that the news will go out
[38:52] i i know uh sister mckayla has a
[38:55] testimony but i don't want to take it
[38:57] from her
[38:58] whenever she feel led to tell us she can
[39:00] so
[39:01] we love the lord
[39:03] and uh we're going to ask that you turn
[39:05] with us
[39:06] to the book of revelations the third
[39:08] chapter we appreciate
[39:10] uh our visitors and those of us who are
[39:13] here we want to make sure that you make
[39:16] yourself comfortable
[39:17] i was telling somebody the other day i
[39:19] said i'm i'm
[39:20] i'm of that noisy crew
[39:23] i like to make a lot of noise when it
[39:25] comes to god
[39:28] uh
[39:29] you know and i know that uh
[39:31] earth is probably the quietest place
[39:34] of the three of hell in heaven
[39:37] we are more quiet here than any other of
[39:39] the other two
[39:41] they're screaming and hollering in hell
[39:43] and
[39:43] they're screaming and hollering in
[39:45] heaven
[39:46] amen
[39:47] so
[39:48] i hope and trust that the message will
[39:51] be a blessing to you i preached this
[39:52] message
[39:53] um
[39:54] there at the camp so it's kind of like a
[39:56] conglomeration of kind of pulling
[39:58] together of some things i have already
[40:00] dealt with and i trust by god grace
[40:02] should be a real blessing to you
[40:04] uh revelations the third chapter and
[40:06] then we're going to go from there to
[40:08] first corinthians the eighth chapter
[40:11] revelations the third chapter
[40:14] and we're going to read the
[40:15] 21st verse
[40:17] of
[40:18] that particular chapter
[40:21] we love the
[40:22] lord oh my god i tell you
[40:25] i don't know about anybody else but uh
[40:27] seeing the coming of the lord the way
[40:29] things are happening
[40:30] it has put me in such a desperation a
[40:33] frenzy however you want to put it
[40:36] because i realized that
[40:38] that the only ones who are going to make
[40:40] a rapture are those who have prepared
[40:43] themselves
[40:44] amen and a lot of people don't know how
[40:47] to prepare themselves and of course we
[40:49] can't do the work
[40:51] uh he does it
[40:52] but we must be aware of what needs to be
[40:55] done
[40:56] you know you can't tell a man to come
[40:57] fix your house and not tell him what
[40:59] needs to be fixed
[41:00] so we trust that somehow the word of god
[41:03] will search us tonight search our very
[41:06] hearts and maybe we'll be able to see
[41:08] some things that god needs to help us he
[41:10] is the builder you know
[41:12] he's the potter and we are the clay we
[41:15] want him to mold us
[41:16] and make us revelations 3 21
[41:21] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[41:24] sit with me
[41:25] in my throne
[41:27] even as i also overcome
[41:29] and am set down with my father in his
[41:32] throne
[41:33] he that have an ear let him hear
[41:36] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[41:39] always good to see brother josh
[41:42] he's
[41:43] not only a friend and a brother but
[41:45] i don't know anybody that can fish like
[41:47] this guy
[41:50] fish love him
[41:53] we love the lord for it you know it's
[41:56] amazing uh first corinthians 8 6.
[42:00] you
[42:00] know when god pulls on your heart that
[42:03] means he's not through with you yet
[42:06] as long as there is a pull on your heart
[42:09] uh no matter what condition you may find
[42:11] yourself in
[42:13] we must always remember that this is not
[42:15] a message of law
[42:17] but a message of grace
[42:19] and as long as we can understand that we
[42:22] can keep moving forward
[42:25] it's a beautiful thing
[42:26] because the the headstone came down
[42:29] shouting grace grace
[42:31] so let us always keep grace because once
[42:34] you
[42:35] lean into the law god will respond to
[42:37] you in that way and that's not a good
[42:39] thing
[42:41] amen uh first corinthians 8 and 6
[42:47] but unto us there is but one god
[42:51] the father
[42:52] of whom
[42:54] are all things
[42:56] and we are in
[42:58] him
[43:00] one lord jesus christ
[43:03] by whom are all things
[43:06] and we by him
[43:08] how be it
[43:11] there is not
[43:13] there is not in every man
[43:16] that knowledge and i'm going to hold it
[43:18] right there
[43:20] there is not in every man
[43:23] that
[43:24] knowledge and if you read on down it
[43:27] tells you about how people
[43:29] find themselves worshiping idols
[43:32] and things of that nature because they
[43:34] lack the understanding
[43:36] of who they are and what they were
[43:38] created for
[43:40] let us pray
[43:42] heavenly father we come before you we
[43:43] thank you for your grace
[43:45] we thank you for your mercy and your
[43:47] love we thank you for being so good to
[43:49] us
[43:50] father you have been better to us than
[43:51] we have been to ourselves there are no
[43:54] words in the english language that can
[43:56] express our gratitude
[43:58] but whatever we have to offer by way of
[44:01] praise
[44:02] and thanksgiving we give it to you
[44:04] tonight
[44:05] father because you're worthy of every
[44:07] praise bless the service lord
[44:10] by your grace and your mercy
[44:12] bless us forgive us of our sins our
[44:15] shortcomings
[44:16] anything we may have said or done
[44:17] throughout the day that haven't been
[44:19] pleasing in our sight
[44:21] we pray that you would cleanse us by the
[44:23] washing
[44:24] by the water of the word
[44:25] and father we'll be careful to give you
[44:27] the praise
[44:28] glory and honor in your lovely name
[44:30] jesus christ we pray amen
[44:33] you may be seated
[44:36] i i titled this message from the sixth
[44:39] dimension
[44:40] to the seventh
[44:43] uh reason being we we
[44:46] we must understand that uh
[44:49] god has gone to prepare a place for us
[44:52] according to saint john 14.
[44:55] he said i go to prepare a place for you
[44:57] that where i am there you may be also
[45:00] if you don't mind we'll just turn there
[45:02] quickly saint john 14
[45:04] we'll begin reading at the first verse
[45:06] there
[45:09] so that we can see exactly where where
[45:11] my thoughts are coming from
[45:14] let not your heart be troubled
[45:19] he believe in god believe also in me
[45:24] and what people did not understand is
[45:26] that the jewish people understood god
[45:29] they knew god was one they understood
[45:33] the god of abraham isaac and jacob
[45:37] because he wasn't in a physical body
[45:41] but when god came down to dwell in
[45:43] christ
[45:44] this was christ's
[45:46] uh message to his followers
[45:49] if you believe in god
[45:52] believe also in me
[45:55] and what was he telling them at that
[45:56] point in time he was telling him that
[45:58] god dwells in me
[46:02] you you this is not anything theology
[46:04] that you've had before
[46:06] but this is a real realistical point of
[46:09] view now this is what has happened in
[46:11] your day
[46:12] god dwells in me
[46:14] and he goes on to say in my father's
[46:17] house
[46:18] are many mentions
[46:20] so even to call
[46:22] god his father
[46:24] in the way that the jewish thought
[46:27] jewish people thought
[46:28] would have sound like blasphemy
[46:31] you know because when he said that
[46:34] that he was the son of god
[46:36] they really tried to kill it
[46:38] because the orthodox jews could not
[46:40] comprehend god in a man
[46:43] that was the mystery of god
[46:45] god in christ
[46:47] but the mystery of god now is christ in
[46:50] us
[46:51] you see
[46:53] so in my father's house are many
[46:55] mansions if it were not so i would have
[46:58] told you i go to prepare a place for you
[47:02] and if i go and prepare a place for you
[47:04] i will come again and receive you unto
[47:06] myself that where i am there ye may be
[47:10] also
[47:11] and whether i go ye know and yeah and
[47:13] the way you know and that's the thing
[47:15] that really caught my attention
[47:18] when i was studying and looking through
[47:19] the scriptures the lord really blessed
[47:21] me to see you know when god receives you
[47:24] now understand we're working with
[47:26] a bride and a bridegroom is that correct
[47:29] because remember that's what john said
[47:32] john said you know when he likened jesus
[47:35] christ as the bridegroom
[47:37] and he said when the bridegroom comes
[47:39] then i must depart and get out of the
[47:41] way so we understand that what we're
[47:43] talking about is something that can be
[47:46] compatible
[47:47] male and female have you ever want to
[47:49] look at it but here he says i receive
[47:51] you unto myself
[47:53] and remember when jesus in saint john 14
[47:56] you find out that jesus the only thing
[47:58] jesus asked the father was that
[48:00] lord
[48:02] let them be with me
[48:03] those who follow me those who believe in
[48:06] me
[48:08] let them be with me
[48:11] so you understand where this thing is
[48:13] all about god is talking about reunion
[48:17] and fellowship
[48:19] see we've come through genesis all the
[48:22] way to the book of revelation and right
[48:24] now we're living in the book of
[48:25] revelation the world knows nothing about
[48:27] it
[48:28] but god is preparing a place for us just
[48:30] like a woman when she has a baby or
[48:33] getting ready to have a baby she
[48:35] prepares the things that she knows that
[48:37] would be suitable for the baby if it's a
[48:40] boy she has the room painted blue blue
[48:42] clothes blue this blood whatever you
[48:44] know but prepare before the baby ever
[48:47] comes and get here there's a place
[48:49] already prepared
[48:51] so you got to understand this is what
[48:52] jesus was saying once we're born out of
[48:55] this world into the world to come
[48:57] there's a place that's already prepared
[49:00] he knows exactly what you like he knows
[49:03] what you need and you and i must
[49:05] understand
[49:07] this body we're talking about entering
[49:09] in because paul said if you destroyed
[49:11] this earthly body he said i have another
[49:14] one he said i have what we call a
[49:17] theophany i have a body that was not
[49:20] created by the hands of man
[49:22] right
[49:23] and and he said he said if this earthly
[49:25] tabernacle be dissolved god has prepared
[49:28] one for me already
[49:30] so we understand that there will be
[49:32] houses and mansions and everything but
[49:34] the greatest of all mansions is the
[49:37] housing that god is preparing for you
[49:39] which is a body amen
[49:42] okay
[49:43] because this body is an eternal body
[49:46] this is a body that we
[49:48] can't even fathom
[49:49] a body that has no pain no sicknesses no
[49:52] aches no nothing a place where there's
[49:55] no sorrow no no nothing that in that
[49:58] world to come
[50:00] there will be nothing that will remind
[50:02] us of this one
[50:04] will be no automobiles no cars no trains
[50:08] no planes
[50:10] no nothing that that that uh how would i
[50:13] say it uh nothing that the science has
[50:16] produced
[50:18] because remember science didn't come
[50:19] into focus or to view in view until
[50:21] after the fall
[50:23] so all of these creative things that
[50:25] we've seen you know musical instruments
[50:28] and all of that kind of stuff started in
[50:30] genesis after the fall
[50:32] but in heaven they didn't need any music
[50:34] instruments
[50:36] but anyway let's move on by the grace of
[50:38] god i'm trying to tell you something
[50:40] here and i want to say it in a nutshell
[50:42] we look at
[50:44] you know uh peter where it says about
[50:47] the nature of god and and add to your
[50:49] faith virtue knowledge and temperance
[50:51] and you must understand there's a
[50:53] building here and there's a building
[50:55] there
[50:56] there's a there's a person and a
[50:58] personality that is god is building in
[51:01] you
[51:03] that will be suited for the for the
[51:05] building he's prepared for you there
[51:07] you understand what i'm saying
[51:09] and so you must understand there's two
[51:11] pulls
[51:12] and there are two things that are
[51:14] working in this world today that's evil
[51:16] and good
[51:18] that which is of the devil and that
[51:20] which is of god and remember amen what
[51:23] brought us into this state of being is
[51:26] what we call evil
[51:28] what yes
[51:30] because we know we came by way of sex
[51:34] which started in an evil way right
[51:36] okay and you know that we came in with
[51:38] the nature
[51:40] of this world
[51:42] which is evil you don't have to teach a
[51:45] baby how to lie
[51:46] you don't have to teach a baby how to be
[51:48] jealous
[51:49] right you don't have to teach a baby how
[51:51] to steal
[51:52] because they are born with that nature
[51:55] which we call a fallen nature
[51:58] and it took jesus christ
[52:01] to come to die
[52:02] right to resurrect
[52:04] and to send back his nature which we
[52:07] call the holy ghost
[52:09] right and this nature is to take
[52:13] you
[52:13] and transform you
[52:16] in other words let's say it like this
[52:18] first of all you can't live again until
[52:21] you die
[52:23] and i mean naturally i mean spiritually
[52:26] you must die and rot to the old nature
[52:29] in which you were born in
[52:31] right because the bible says that when
[52:33] you put on christ you put on what a new
[52:36] creature
[52:37] that means a new creation
[52:39] all things old things are passed away
[52:42] god
[52:43] uh dealt with the tree of knowledge of
[52:46] good and evil for 6 000 years
[52:51] since the fall
[52:53] but jesus says in this day you've got to
[52:55] make the tree good
[52:57] or make it evil
[53:00] salt water and bitter water can't come
[53:02] out of the same fountain
[53:04] so we we must understand the importance
[53:07] of why god has us
[53:10] working or why god is working
[53:12] to build himself in us
[53:15] right the bible says like this paul said
[53:18] we need to grow up into christ
[53:21] right so therefore the nature that we're
[53:24] baptized with you're baptized when you
[53:26] get the holy ghost you're just a baby
[53:29] right but that baby must be formed that
[53:32] baby must it may be nurtured and the
[53:35] only way that baby is going to grow up
[53:38] healthy is that
[53:40] you feed it the right nourishment
[53:43] which is the word of god
[53:46] right because you know how it is when a
[53:48] woman is pregnant
[53:50] she may not in her natural self she may
[53:53] not like pickles and ice cream but when
[53:56] she get pregnant
[53:58] the baby needs whatever nourishment
[54:00] vitamins or whatever and she might find
[54:03] herself eating some of the strangest
[54:04] stuff ever
[54:06] like pickles and ice cream
[54:09] together
[54:11] and so but that is what the baby calls
[54:14] for and and you want that baby to be
[54:16] healthy this is where mothers fail
[54:19] because listen they worry about being
[54:21] fat
[54:22] when they should be more concerned about
[54:24] feeding the baby
[54:27] right
[54:28] because that baby knows what it needs
[54:32] and if you don't feed the baby while
[54:34] it's in the womb
[54:36] something will go wrong
[54:39] with that child even in the mental the
[54:42] mental part this is why some of the kids
[54:44] are just coming out the way they are
[54:46] because you know a.d.d and whatever they
[54:48] call it it's because the parents weren't
[54:50] feeding in the proper foods
[54:53] folks it makes a difference
[54:57] and this junk food really makes wild
[55:00] child children
[55:02] and that's what happens
[55:04] kids come out and you can't even control
[55:06] them because they hype with in their
[55:08] genetics by the foods you gave to them
[55:12] i'm not preaching just want to preach on
[55:14] that but my point is
[55:16] you are what you eat
[55:20] you must understand why it's important
[55:23] to feed to to eat the very
[55:26] word for your day
[55:29] because we're here to express jesus
[55:31] christ in a different way from the age
[55:34] before us
[55:37] in a better way
[55:39] we are to express christ and we're
[55:42] coming to a time in the fullness of
[55:44] christ where christ is pouring out his
[55:47] spirit in individuals
[55:50] to the brim
[55:54] we're no longer children
[55:56] we've come through luther we've come
[55:58] through wesley we've come through the
[56:00] pentecostals and now this is the capping
[56:02] off of the pyramid
[56:04] this is the maturing of god's bride this
[56:07] is why the bible says the bride made
[56:10] herself ready
[56:13] hallelujah
[56:14] and so you and i must understand
[56:18] evil nothing evil will go up
[56:22] when you die it doesn't change your
[56:25] character
[56:26] it only changes your dwelling place
[56:29] if you lived evil here whatever darkness
[56:32] in you will pull you down
[56:34] but if you have light in you
[56:37] it will take you up
[56:40] see and that's why it's so important
[56:42] listen the church world don't know how
[56:44] to prepare themselves because they say
[56:45] oh i'm a christian
[56:47] but they think they're christians
[56:48] because that's because they say they are
[56:51] christian it is not some kind of cliche
[56:55] it is it is a a being a transformed
[56:59] person
[57:01] the bible said they called the
[57:02] christians called them christian first
[57:05] and eria why they walk like christ they
[57:08] talk like christ they did miracles like
[57:10] christ everything jesus did they were
[57:13] doing
[57:14] and this is why i'm against systems
[57:17] because systems amen engages you it
[57:20] entraps you it's like a fish in a bowl
[57:23] you feed him but he's got nowhere to go
[57:26] it's like a parrot in a cage right oh
[57:29] you give him all the nourishments you
[57:30] give him all the things he needs to
[57:32] survive but he'll never know how to fly
[57:34] because he's still in the cage
[57:38] see that's what a system do it can give
[57:40] you a but the bible says
[57:43] he whom the son is set free is free
[57:46] indeed and where the spirit of the lord
[57:48] is there is liberty
[57:57] just coming
[57:59] by way of paradoxical 64.
[58:03] he says now the father
[58:05] now dwells in us
[58:07] by his death he sanctified
[58:10] a church
[58:12] that absolutely the church the clean the
[58:15] unclean
[58:16] filthy see we once was that that's what
[58:18] we were but god
[58:20] condescending from a pill of fire
[58:24] down to a man
[58:26] and
[58:27] then the holy spirit
[58:29] that's right in us
[58:31] see this holy ghost is not just a shout
[58:34] it's not just a dance it's not just to
[58:37] speak in tongues or run up and down the
[58:39] aisle or you know what i mean no it
[58:41] comes to change you
[58:44] listen
[58:45] christianity is a way of change
[58:49] and it's little by little
[58:51] but is god working in you
[58:55] till you come to a place that you are in
[58:57] his very image his very likeness
[59:00] where you come to that place where jesus
[59:02] said if you say to this mountain be thou
[59:05] move
[59:06] it has to move
[59:08] it's in that place that we're not moving
[59:10] into where the word of god said
[59:12] whatsoever you say
[59:14] see we're not just
[59:16] uh uh what we call it uh uh
[59:19] facsimiles of christians
[59:22] we we're the real deal we're the the
[59:24] reality of of crisis death burial and
[59:28] resurrection we are to reflect him
[59:32] and not creeds and dogmas
[59:35] we are supposed to reflect him
[59:38] right
[59:39] you know it's like a drunk man i mean
[59:41] you see a drunk man staggering you know
[59:43] he's full of something
[59:46] right he ain't staggering off water
[59:49] right but it's whatever he's drinking
[59:51] that makes him act the way he acts and
[59:54] look the way he looks hallelujah so is
[59:57] it with a christian
[59:59] when you eating the word it will
[1:00:02] transform you it'll take the worldly
[1:00:05] desires out of you it will quit it would
[1:00:08] make you quit now you quit it it will
[1:00:11] make you
[1:00:12] quit right
[1:00:15] because as long as you say oh i'm giving
[1:00:16] up this and i'm giving out that most of
[1:00:18] the time you're going to go back to it
[1:00:20] hallelujah but when god takes it away
[1:00:23] that's what james said when god when he
[1:00:25] said when j james said when god removes
[1:00:28] that he's because we're understood
[1:00:29] you're you're only tempted when you're
[1:00:31] drawn away with your own lust enticed
[1:00:34] and enticed because god does not tempt
[1:00:36] any man
[1:00:37] hallelujah
[1:00:39] this seems just like a deja vu but i
[1:00:42] like those
[1:00:44] see he come down what from a pill of
[1:00:46] fire down to make a man and see what
[1:00:50] people don't understand when god came
[1:00:51] down to make a man
[1:00:53] he said and then the holy spirit right
[1:00:55] in us
[1:00:57] you see
[1:00:59] it's not enough to say oh i got the holy
[1:01:01] ghost and nobody can tell it
[1:01:05] it's evidence that something has
[1:01:07] happened
[1:01:10] right and you don't even have to
[1:01:12] broadcast it people will begin to see
[1:01:15] the change in you
[1:01:17] just by observing you
[1:01:21] listen
[1:01:23] we have an obligation to jesus christ
[1:01:26] himself and i'm gonna get to the
[1:01:27] dimensions in just a moment
[1:01:29] he said listen brother sisters
[1:01:32] you and i he says
[1:01:34] and and and in this this world that we
[1:01:37] live he says let's conduct ourselves as
[1:01:41] sons and daughters of god
[1:01:44] and most people don't even know what
[1:01:47] that means
[1:01:49] do you know first of all you'll never
[1:01:52] know how to consult
[1:01:54] how you how to conduct yourself as a son
[1:01:58] and daughter of god until you know who
[1:02:00] god is and what god is
[1:02:05] right how can you conduct yourself like
[1:02:07] god if you don't know the way he behaves
[1:02:12] right you remember the little story
[1:02:15] about the man amen in the snow and he
[1:02:17] had just come uh um from the uh the bar
[1:02:20] and he was going like this and he's
[1:02:22] going like this and he's going like this
[1:02:25] and
[1:02:25] and his son was behind him
[1:02:28] so his son was following his trail
[1:02:30] daddy went this way
[1:02:32] he went this way and the daddy
[1:02:35] looked around and said well what are you
[1:02:36] doing
[1:02:37] he said i'm following your footsteps
[1:02:42] that statement converted the man
[1:02:49] because he at that moment he found he
[1:02:51] saw what was happening his lifestyle was
[1:02:55] now influencing his son
[1:02:57] and eventually his son was going to
[1:02:59] become like him
[1:03:02] hallelujah if we can see the power of
[1:03:05] god and see the holiness of god
[1:03:07] and just mock god as he is whoo
[1:03:12] yes sir
[1:03:15] you love the lord
[1:03:18] listen
[1:03:20] but our behavior ought to be according
[1:03:22] to the commandments of god
[1:03:25] that we are sons and daughters of god
[1:03:28] listen our behavior
[1:03:30] we should act and do
[1:03:33] any and everything according to what the
[1:03:36] laws of god or god has laid down amen in
[1:03:39] other words god says don't lie don't lie
[1:03:42] god say don't steal don't steal
[1:03:44] right
[1:03:45] you say but listen that's works no no no
[1:03:47] no if you've got god in you
[1:03:51] god will obey his word
[1:03:54] amen it is you say you see what i'm
[1:03:56] saying
[1:03:57] because you and i understand now we know
[1:04:00] and you've heard me say that this this
[1:04:02] dimension that we're in
[1:04:05] of course it's the third dimension right
[1:04:08] do you know what is air light and things
[1:04:10] like that
[1:04:11] and then you got the four fifth and
[1:04:13] sixth
[1:04:14] and i just used to wonder how oh what
[1:04:16] was going on you know paul says listen
[1:04:19] whether i'm kind of quoting he says i i
[1:04:21] don't know whether i was in the body or
[1:04:23] out the body
[1:04:25] he said but i know a man that was caught
[1:04:27] up into the third heavens
[1:04:31] mathematically i couldn't figure it out
[1:04:33] until the other day oh yeah
[1:04:35] that's the sixth
[1:04:37] because
[1:04:39] everything else is earthbound
[1:04:43] hallelujah but you go all the way up now
[1:04:46] it's it's heavens
[1:04:48] i was caught up in the third heaven he
[1:04:50] said i saw things that was not lawful
[1:04:52] for me to see
[1:04:54] hallelujah you understand me
[1:04:57] in other words amen when you die
[1:05:00] when you this earthly tabernacle when
[1:05:02] this fades away
[1:05:04] what's ever in you
[1:05:06] will make its journey home
[1:05:10] you understand me
[1:05:12] wherever home is
[1:05:14] it's going to make its way and connect
[1:05:17] to wherever home is
[1:05:20] if you came from god
[1:05:22] and you the life of christ in you is in
[1:05:25] you you go up
[1:05:28] but if you're feeding on the things of
[1:05:30] the world the darkness of the world
[1:05:32] because remember the prophet god and the
[1:05:34] word said it like this if you love the
[1:05:37] world and the things of the world the
[1:05:40] love of god is not even in you you
[1:05:42] understand that he's not saying you're
[1:05:44] not a christian but he's saying the holy
[1:05:47] ghost
[1:05:48] is not in you because the holy ghost is
[1:05:51] the love of god god so loved the world
[1:05:54] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:05:56] whosoever believeth in him shall not
[1:05:58] perish but have everlasting life
[1:06:01] right
[1:06:02] this is what paul was saying it's no
[1:06:05] longer i that live but christ that lives
[1:06:08] in me
[1:06:09] that's what takes you up
[1:06:12] right the gates are not going to open
[1:06:14] for you if the character is not at the
[1:06:17] gate
[1:06:19] you understand what i'm saying
[1:06:21] the character of christ is the only
[1:06:23] thing that opens up the gate
[1:06:26] it was during the first resurrection
[1:06:28] when the old testament saints rose
[1:06:30] right and they said who who is this king
[1:06:33] of glory he said the lord mighty in
[1:06:36] battle he is the king of glory and the
[1:06:38] gates swung open and the old testament
[1:06:41] saint marched in
[1:06:43] right
[1:06:44] oh people of god so now we're at the
[1:06:46] same place
[1:06:48] but you see what what's so wonderful is
[1:06:50] this that whatever sin put oh how can i
[1:06:54] say it
[1:06:55] heaven and earth will be recreated
[1:06:59] you understand me
[1:07:00] why
[1:07:01] because of the sin
[1:07:03] that adam and eve did
[1:07:06] it loosed the devil
[1:07:08] and gave him a right to a sin
[1:07:11] because remember he was cast out
[1:07:14] he was earthbound
[1:07:16] but when aaron eve forfeited their
[1:07:18] rights
[1:07:20] it gave the devil rights
[1:07:23] and you know everywhere he goes he
[1:07:25] pollutes
[1:07:27] it becomes
[1:07:28] contaminated and so therefore god is
[1:07:31] going to have to renovate the heavens
[1:07:32] and the earth
[1:07:34] everything is going to be changed this
[1:07:37] world is going to be changed the
[1:07:39] atmosphere is going to be changed why
[1:07:41] because satan is the prince and power of
[1:07:44] the air he is the ruler
[1:07:49] when i heard somebody
[1:07:52] say
[1:07:52] you know if he's a prison powder we must
[1:07:54] be breathing in that ain't what he's
[1:07:56] talking about
[1:07:58] he's talking about that dimension
[1:08:00] he rules it he calls us the storms
[1:08:04] he causes the tornadoes and things of
[1:08:06] that nature and people say well how
[1:08:08] would god do that they only say it
[1:08:10] because they don't know that's not god
[1:08:13] i can prove it
[1:08:15] when jesus was and was he in the boat
[1:08:17] sleep
[1:08:18] and then and then the winds and the
[1:08:19] waves began to boast itself
[1:08:22] that wasn't god causing that storm
[1:08:25] the bible said jesus stood up on the
[1:08:27] realm of that boat said peace be still
[1:08:30] he rebuked the devils that was causing
[1:08:32] the storm
[1:08:35] so it's the devils that's in all of this
[1:08:37] stuff
[1:08:40] right
[1:08:41] so we understand amen that this
[1:08:43] dimension it was messed up
[1:08:46] this is let me say it like this whatever
[1:08:48] took place in genesis 1
[1:08:51] and after that genesis 2
[1:08:53] it caused the earth to be void
[1:08:56] that means amen something shook up the
[1:08:59] dimensions
[1:09:01] and then god began to reset the
[1:09:04] dimensions put things back in order
[1:09:08] and when he put things back in order the
[1:09:10] devil was bound
[1:09:13] he was kicked out of heaven
[1:09:15] so that means he couldn't be in the
[1:09:16] sixth he couldn't be nowhere but he was
[1:09:18] bound
[1:09:19] so he's walking around in the garden of
[1:09:21] eden trying to get back in and ascend
[1:09:24] back up
[1:09:25] and avon e broke it
[1:09:28] gave him the rights to it
[1:09:31] is that right he's a god of this age
[1:09:34] is that right he's the god of politics
[1:09:38] how did he get this
[1:09:40] when adam was made god of the earth
[1:09:43] god gave him the authority
[1:09:46] hallelujah but when he forfeited his
[1:09:49] rights satan became the authority and
[1:09:51] that's why he's ruling everything right
[1:09:54] now
[1:09:56] you say these people are crazy but
[1:09:57] they're being ruled by the devil
[1:10:00] all of the countries every nation amen
[1:10:03] in this world is now being ruled by him
[1:10:07] but know you not that his days are
[1:10:10] numbered
[1:10:11] hallelujah god is getting ready to tear
[1:10:14] his kingdom down
[1:10:17] hallelujah
[1:10:19] glory to god and what is he doing
[1:10:22] he's creating an army
[1:10:29] he's creating a bride um
[1:10:35] oh yeah
[1:10:38] that message speak to the mountain
[1:10:40] brother adams talks about
[1:10:43] what god is getting ready to do
[1:10:45] and what he's going to do
[1:10:48] with this bride
[1:10:50] with this church
[1:10:52] see it's a mystery
[1:10:54] because people think it's all over
[1:10:57] it's not all over
[1:11:01] and one thing for certain we will leave
[1:11:04] out of here
[1:11:05] victoriously
[1:11:07] hallelujah is that right we try out in
[1:11:11] christ
[1:11:12] it's not us but the god in us that
[1:11:15] causes us to triumph thanks be to god
[1:11:18] paul said that gives us the victory
[1:11:20] hallelujah and causes us to triumph
[1:11:23] i love that
[1:11:25] try out
[1:11:26] that needs to celebrate
[1:11:29] that's when we come to church we're
[1:11:30] supposed to celebrate
[1:11:32] don't come in here like some losers and
[1:11:33] old woes me and all that kind of stuff
[1:11:35] listen let me tell you what god came to
[1:11:38] save those well that was saveable
[1:11:43] right he didn't come to sale he didn't
[1:11:44] come to save the well
[1:11:47] those that didn't need a physician that
[1:11:49] he didn't come to save those he needed
[1:11:51] though he came to save those that needed
[1:11:53] help
[1:11:57] and i don't know about you but i needed
[1:11:58] help
[1:11:59] still need help i'll need help till i
[1:12:01] leave this place
[1:12:05] see we are made partakers listen it is
[1:12:08] not
[1:12:09] you did not just come to christ it was
[1:12:12] christ who came to you
[1:12:14] you you was lost he wasn't lost you were
[1:12:17] lost
[1:12:18] hallelujah now how are we going to get
[1:12:20] back to where we used to be
[1:12:22] because remember everybody that dies now
[1:12:25] that's in christ they only go to the
[1:12:27] sixth dimension
[1:12:30] hallelujah
[1:12:31] that means they're not complete
[1:12:35] amen yet because seven is complete
[1:12:39] and so they go there and they're waiting
[1:12:41] to come back and we're waiting to go up
[1:12:46] they want their natural bodies
[1:12:48] because when they're in the theophany
[1:12:50] they can't they they don't sleep
[1:12:53] they don't breathe
[1:12:55] they don't get tired
[1:12:58] they're in a body that we can't even
[1:13:00] comprehend
[1:13:02] hallelujah
[1:13:03] have you ever heard of a
[1:13:06] choir from heaven
[1:13:08] they don't even take a breath
[1:13:14] because understand now
[1:13:15] the breath of life was only given to us
[1:13:19] as men
[1:13:23] that's why when we die we give it back
[1:13:25] up
[1:13:28] but there
[1:13:30] they didn't need it in that dimension
[1:13:34] the breath of life was here
[1:13:36] but understand when this is over
[1:13:40] we'll be just like jesus
[1:13:43] [Laughter]
[1:13:47] but we are made partakers of his
[1:13:48] holiness
[1:13:50] see we're in his image
[1:13:52] we are living images of the living god
[1:13:56] hallelujah
[1:13:58] then dead to self
[1:14:00] this is what we're fighting to to do
[1:14:02] what die to ourselves
[1:14:05] you know what that means to die to your
[1:14:07] will
[1:14:08] so much so that god's will be done
[1:14:11] at all times
[1:14:13] lord destroy my will
[1:14:16] don't let it be what i got to do this
[1:14:18] and i got to do that no i want to do
[1:14:20] what you want me to do see when we come
[1:14:22] to that place to recognize that we are
[1:14:24] the final
[1:14:26] you know how it is in the race they put
[1:14:28] the best
[1:14:29] in the la the last
[1:14:32] right
[1:14:32] they put a fast with it first now don't
[1:14:34] get me wrong but that last runner in
[1:14:36] that relay
[1:14:38] he has a history
[1:14:40] because they want to put that fast one
[1:14:42] there so that if there's somebody that's
[1:14:45] already overtaken their group this guy
[1:14:48] can surpass them
[1:14:50] so god did what he saved the best for
[1:14:53] last
[1:14:54] hallelujah so understand it's not what
[1:14:57] we think we can do we must understand
[1:15:00] what we can do and the bible says
[1:15:03] whatsoever if you believe it you can
[1:15:05] have it
[1:15:07] is that right that's the truth
[1:15:09] you can have it whatsoever you believe
[1:15:11] you can have it it's yours
[1:15:14] listen as christians we've got all of
[1:15:16] these blessings i mean so many the bible
[1:15:19] said you know
[1:15:20] uh god has blessed us with all spiritual
[1:15:24] blessing all
[1:15:25] and we just take these little things and
[1:15:28] we praise the lord i'm blessed
[1:15:30] do you realize amen the depth of that
[1:15:34] it goes beyond amen what you and i think
[1:15:37] that's why the bible says that god jesus
[1:15:39] christ is able to bless us and to give
[1:15:42] us
[1:15:43] what we ask for
[1:15:45] above
[1:15:47] above whatever we
[1:15:49] ask or think
[1:15:51] so he's unlimited
[1:15:55] think about it your father who created
[1:15:59] the heavens and the earth decided to
[1:16:02] live in you
[1:16:06] is that right
[1:16:07] the old testament says don't think god
[1:16:09] is in heaven
[1:16:11] don't think he's far off somewhere in a
[1:16:13] far-off country the bible said he's
[1:16:15] naughty
[1:16:16] even in your mouth
[1:16:21] but without faith
[1:16:23] it's impossible to please him
[1:16:28] you can say a lot of things you can
[1:16:29] speak it
[1:16:30] but if your faith is not backing it up
[1:16:33] and faith is solid
[1:16:35] faith is not afraid
[1:16:37] faith is don't scare
[1:16:39] and faith never says no
[1:16:42] huh it goes for it even when every all
[1:16:46] obstacles and all odds are against it it
[1:16:49] stands on the word of god because it
[1:16:52] knows the word of god is god and it
[1:16:55] cannot fail
[1:16:57] how do you think you're gonna make a
[1:16:59] rapture if you don't even believe you
[1:17:01] can be translated or resurrected
[1:17:06] this is what we're doing now
[1:17:08] this is what the holy ghost is doing now
[1:17:10] he's working this miracle in you
[1:17:12] and you're the greatest of all miracles
[1:17:15] right oh it's the truth it's good to see
[1:17:17] blind eyes open it's good to see the
[1:17:19] lame walk it's good to see cancer healed
[1:17:22] it's good to see all of those things
[1:17:24] happen but the greatest miracle is
[1:17:26] christ in you
[1:17:29] hallelujah when you know that you know
[1:17:31] that you know that you have passed from
[1:17:33] death in the life you can't even explain
[1:17:36] it but you know it happened because you
[1:17:38] see the results of it
[1:17:40] hallelujah
[1:17:43] hallelujah
[1:17:44] right he's oh no now listen listen now
[1:17:47] the word made flesh again in us do you
[1:17:51] know what that means
[1:17:53] when the word was made flesh in christ
[1:17:57] everybody was able to see what it was
[1:18:00] even the pharisees says
[1:18:02] nicodemus came to jesus by night says
[1:18:04] rabbi we know
[1:18:06] you are you are a teacher that comes
[1:18:07] from god because no man can do these
[1:18:10] kind of things except god center
[1:18:13] that's what the bride is the bride is
[1:18:15] that that these the people you know who
[1:18:18] are literally living the word of god god
[1:18:21] in flesh and whatever he says they do it
[1:18:25] they don't do anything on their own but
[1:18:27] when he said pray they pray
[1:18:29] when he says amen say to this mountain
[1:18:31] be moving move if god says speak to this
[1:18:34] and speak to that you do it
[1:18:36] you don't question him
[1:18:38] he's your husband
[1:18:41] you just obey
[1:18:43] and see that's the problem
[1:18:45] we're disconnected because we're not
[1:18:47] consecrated
[1:18:49] you must become god's not going to give
[1:18:50] you what i just preached just now that
[1:18:52] doesn't come to people who are not
[1:18:54] consecrated you have to be consecrated
[1:18:57] huh
[1:18:58] sold out to god
[1:19:00] right you must have a relationship with
[1:19:02] him
[1:19:03] right god is not going to let you use
[1:19:05] him as an errand boy
[1:19:08] there must be a connection
[1:19:10] you love the lord
[1:19:12] so what we're talking about running from
[1:19:14] the moving from dimensions to you heard
[1:19:16] me preach about elijah and elijah the
[1:19:18] bible says you know everybody says i'm
[1:19:20] just preaching so i'm off on those so
[1:19:22] elijah says oh oh uh uh elisha says lord
[1:19:26] you know give me a uh give me a double
[1:19:29] portion right you know how the story go
[1:19:31] and i said that's a hard thing
[1:19:34] but if you see me go up
[1:19:37] i'll give it to you
[1:19:39] now watch this because the bible talks
[1:19:40] about a fire and a whirlwind and a
[1:19:43] chariot and every painting in every
[1:19:45] drawing we see amen a world uh where our
[1:19:49] fire uh a chariot in a whirlwind with
[1:19:51] fire
[1:19:52] but if you pay attention to the
[1:19:53] scripture the bible said it was the
[1:19:55] whirlwind that separated the two and
[1:19:58] understand the chariot of fire and the
[1:20:01] fire represents
[1:20:02] god and god in the whirlwind
[1:20:05] is that right because that's what elijah
[1:20:07] said i've seen you in the thunder i've
[1:20:09] seen you in the whirlwind i've seen you
[1:20:10] in the earthquake i've seen you in
[1:20:11] different things but now you come to me
[1:20:13] in what a small still voice
[1:20:16] so god comes in the way that he chooses
[1:20:18] to come
[1:20:20] but understand it was the whirlwind that
[1:20:22] took him up
[1:20:24] and what did he see he saw a portal
[1:20:29] he saw the way out of here
[1:20:32] you understand me elisha saw elijah get
[1:20:36] out of here
[1:20:37] he saw dimensional change
[1:20:40] you hear me he didn't say well he just
[1:20:42] floated all the way up and he just
[1:20:43] disappeared no
[1:20:45] it's like enoch who had the key
[1:20:47] he walked with god
[1:20:49] and the bible said he pleased god how
[1:20:52] did he please god he must have been
[1:20:54] tried and tested just like we are
[1:20:57] because the prophet god said that enoch
[1:20:59] is a type of the bride and so he had to
[1:21:02] move from virtue of faith and knowledge
[1:21:04] and tempers and godliness all the way up
[1:21:07] the same character otherwise he wouldn't
[1:21:09] have been able to get in
[1:21:11] no unclean thing will go into this city
[1:21:17] it doesn't matter how long you've been a
[1:21:18] christian
[1:21:20] you might have to you know at the
[1:21:22] rapture we're talking about rapture now
[1:21:24] you might get in afterwards
[1:21:26] hallelujah
[1:21:28] but you're going to have to be purged
[1:21:30] you don't want to go to the white throne
[1:21:32] judgment or if i miss the rapture i'll
[1:21:34] take my chance oh no
[1:21:36] i don't want to take no chances
[1:21:39] hallelujah oh my you don't even know
[1:21:41] what how holy he is
[1:21:44] glory to god you know what i'm saying
[1:21:45] what we call holy that's just this
[1:21:47] perverted thing that we see but god is
[1:21:50] far more holier than you can imagine
[1:21:54] hallelujah he's so holy those angels
[1:21:57] who's never sinned before has to cover
[1:21:59] their faces
[1:22:00] where will you stand as a sinner amen
[1:22:07] may god help us
[1:22:08] and let the holy spirit work on us
[1:22:11] we need these these
[1:22:13] the dark every dark speck in us we need
[1:22:16] it out
[1:22:17] because jesus said amen there is no
[1:22:20] darkness in me
[1:22:22] hallelujah and so therefore we in this
[1:22:25] day we don't have much time that's the
[1:22:27] thing
[1:22:28] the time is far spent and the bible says
[1:22:30] you and i must redeem the time
[1:22:33] you know what i mean all that time we've
[1:22:35] been idle all that time we've misused
[1:22:37] god time for the crazy things of the
[1:22:39] world we need to be taking that time and
[1:22:41] says oh god make me desperate
[1:22:45] put me in a place amen that you mattered
[1:22:48] and only you
[1:22:49] that's where we are
[1:22:52] because the foolish virgins missed the
[1:22:54] rapture
[1:22:56] because she was dollatory
[1:22:59] she was lazy
[1:23:02] you can't be lazy christians right now
[1:23:06] and if you are you need to ask god to
[1:23:07] take that spirit off
[1:23:12] oh i know you think i'm a holy role and
[1:23:14] of course maybe i am but oh brother do
[1:23:18] you see it
[1:23:19] triumph over every denomination triumph
[1:23:22] over all paganism a living god made
[1:23:26] manifest in a living temple and the word
[1:23:29] of god which is god is made flesh in you
[1:23:33] let me tell you the greatest idol that
[1:23:35] you have to overcome is yourself
[1:23:39] because anytime you put yourself before
[1:23:41] god you becomes an idol
[1:23:44] anything
[1:23:47] make no difference whether it's your
[1:23:48] wife your husband your children no
[1:23:50] matter what it is if you put them before
[1:23:51] god they have become your idol
[1:23:56] but you got to understand that the least
[1:23:58] the least
[1:24:00] of his believers no matter how long and
[1:24:02] how long or who little or how little
[1:24:05] whatever you are the least of his
[1:24:07] believer in him has all evil under them
[1:24:12] so i'm helping you here
[1:24:14] because right now you might be thinking
[1:24:16] about how bad you are
[1:24:18] but understand you got to be you got to
[1:24:19] realize you're under the blood
[1:24:22] right
[1:24:23] we're saved by grace so let me say it
[1:24:25] like this even if you're the foot
[1:24:27] you're the feet of jesus
[1:24:29] you still above the devil
[1:24:32] if you just the skin of the feet
[1:24:36] the devil is still under you
[1:24:38] right and so you must understand amen
[1:24:41] your position is higher than the devil
[1:24:43] so you don't allow him to bring you down
[1:24:47] i understand we're condescending
[1:24:51] we're not descending
[1:24:53] we're going up you say well what do you
[1:24:55] mean remember the preview of the bride
[1:24:57] as she marched she was marching and
[1:24:59] began to go upward
[1:25:01] this is what's happening to us now
[1:25:03] we're going upward you say what what do
[1:25:05] you mean because the character of christ
[1:25:08] is taking us upward and the more we the
[1:25:11] closer we get to perfection the closer
[1:25:14] we get to that dimension
[1:25:17] oh wait a minute now
[1:25:20] the prophet god was laying on the bed
[1:25:24] around 50 or so he was
[1:25:27] and he said
[1:25:28] my
[1:25:30] i haven't done nothing for god
[1:25:33] if i don't get up and do something
[1:25:35] and i'm thinking to myself
[1:25:37] if he didn't do anything for the lord
[1:25:39] then where is going to put me
[1:25:42] and won millions of souls to jesus
[1:25:44] christ and
[1:25:45] man i have to think about it
[1:25:49] when it comes to counting
[1:25:52] and he said all of a sudden he felt this
[1:25:53] little funny feeling
[1:25:55] and he found himself
[1:25:58] in that sixth dimension
[1:26:00] because the angel that spoke to him said
[1:26:02] no this is under the altar which is the
[1:26:05] sixth dimension
[1:26:06] he saw all of these people he says ah
[1:26:09] all these branhams he says no no no no
[1:26:10] no these are your converts to jesus
[1:26:13] christ
[1:26:14] hallelujah y'all remember the story of
[1:26:15] the old woman and she comes when she was
[1:26:17] 97 years old when you led her to christ
[1:26:20] and she was one of the most beautiful
[1:26:21] women there
[1:26:23] y'all understand me so what are you
[1:26:24] saying brother brooks i'm saying if you
[1:26:27] can fully understand
[1:26:29] time and dimension he was able to go
[1:26:32] into the
[1:26:34] future because on the bed he says i must
[1:26:37] have died but he wasn't dead
[1:26:40] hallelujah
[1:26:41] but he saw god took you said that ain't
[1:26:43] possible yes it is god took ezekiel and
[1:26:46] the bible said god lifted ezekiel up by
[1:26:48] the hairs of his head
[1:26:52] he saw cherubims and seraphims he saw
[1:26:55] angels and all kinds of stuff and then
[1:26:58] that was in that dimension
[1:27:01] can you imagine the people that how they
[1:27:03] thought he was totally insane when he
[1:27:05] came back and tried to share his
[1:27:07] experience
[1:27:11] think about it
[1:27:13] you know you say well what do you mean
[1:27:14] let me say it like this that dimension
[1:27:16] is real you say ah brother brooks let me
[1:27:19] ask you something i'ma bring it down to
[1:27:20] you because this is the truth how many
[1:27:22] of y'all can see radio waves
[1:27:24] anybody can see those television uh
[1:27:26] pictures that coming through here
[1:27:28] through by way of ether
[1:27:30] no but it's real has always been
[1:27:33] we as scientists have learned how to tap
[1:27:36] into it and bring it into a box that we
[1:27:39] can see it
[1:27:40] our today is somebody else's yesterday
[1:27:44] hallelujah but we can get on that
[1:27:46] television and we can go eternal on them
[1:27:48] [Laughter]
[1:27:50] right we can see in a dimension and a
[1:27:53] day that's already passed over there and
[1:27:55] now it's just coming to us
[1:27:58] and then the people a man that's a
[1:28:00] father on the east coast can see our day
[1:28:03] our hour when their day is in the
[1:28:05] morning and hours in the evening
[1:28:08] see that's the dimension
[1:28:11] scientists know that that's why they
[1:28:13] built that collider trying to break into
[1:28:16] another dimension
[1:28:17] the same thing they did in noah's day
[1:28:20] that caused the flood
[1:28:23] the same thing it was scientists that
[1:28:25] destroyed the earth
[1:28:27] and then they go up there amen in in uh
[1:28:30] in the north pole and and everything up
[1:28:33] there and they said well you know we
[1:28:34] found some willie mammoth with grass in
[1:28:37] their mouth and how did it get here i'll
[1:28:39] tell you how it got there there was an
[1:28:42] explosion
[1:28:43] and that explosion literally
[1:28:46] knocked the world out of orbit
[1:28:49] and it was an instant freeze
[1:28:53] and the world came back upside down
[1:28:58] so who's to say the north is south and
[1:29:00] the south is north
[1:29:02] y'all understand me
[1:29:04] you say what do you mean because of the
[1:29:06] anteluvian flood this is why we have
[1:29:09] continents
[1:29:11] before the flood came it was one land
[1:29:14] one mass
[1:29:15] but everything began to drift
[1:29:18] because of the water separating some
[1:29:20] going this way
[1:29:22] and it broke up the earth
[1:29:24] but god knew it
[1:29:28] hallelujah you understand me that's
[1:29:31] science
[1:29:32] but even in that day when they were so
[1:29:36] educated amen and so scientific god
[1:29:39] pulled one on them
[1:29:41] what do you mean he took a man who never
[1:29:43] went to astronautical uh a university of
[1:29:46] any kind and translated him amen
[1:29:50] hallelujah he took an old farmer by the
[1:29:53] name of noah and built a boat that was
[1:29:56] more powerful than the titanic amen
[1:30:01] god did it
[1:30:03] the same god that turned water into wine
[1:30:06] hallelujah the same man that raised
[1:30:09] lazarus from the dead
[1:30:11] they say he ain't alive i said you are a
[1:30:13] liar he is alive how do you know brother
[1:30:16] brother because he's living in me
[1:30:19] and the same things he did yesterday
[1:30:21] he's doing them today
[1:30:23] hallelujah say what do you say i've seen
[1:30:26] the dead rays
[1:30:28] i have
[1:30:29] naturally and spiritually
[1:30:32] hallelujah yes sir
[1:30:35] he said what do you mean let me tell you
[1:30:37] something
[1:30:39] when i was in lima ohio
[1:30:42] normally people don't even come to the
[1:30:44] communion y'all know how it is
[1:30:46] so we had baked a little piece of bread
[1:30:49] and then the church filled up
[1:30:52] folks from everywhere
[1:30:54] we well we didn't worry about the wine
[1:30:56] because we had enough of that
[1:30:57] we didn't have enough bread
[1:30:59] but i got sister karen and others who
[1:31:02] still living who saw that bread multiply
[1:31:06] so you can't tell me he's not doing it
[1:31:08] he's still doing it
[1:31:14] if he did it yesterday he can do it
[1:31:15] today
[1:31:17] how many of y'all have ever driven off
[1:31:19] of air
[1:31:21] your gas tank is empty
[1:31:23] the needle says it's empty
[1:31:25] and you're still driving
[1:31:32] i can tell you things y'all might think
[1:31:34] i'm crazy but i'm gonna tell you to tell
[1:31:35] you this anyway one time i was trapped
[1:31:37] and i was so tired
[1:31:39] i really wanted to sleep
[1:31:41] and i know i could knew i couldn't
[1:31:43] and all of a sudden my my van lifted
[1:31:46] you don't have to believe it i literally
[1:31:48] looked down it lifted and took me all
[1:31:52] the way home
[1:31:56] and we got home faster
[1:31:59] that's all i'm saying
[1:32:01] you don't have to believe that but but
[1:32:04] god knows i'm telling you the way i saw
[1:32:06] it and and i'm telling you the truth the
[1:32:07] way i see it
[1:32:09] hallelujah glory to god
[1:32:15] oh my goodness i i wish i had a witness
[1:32:18] here because the one woman that i she's
[1:32:20] deceased already
[1:32:23] and i needed some money
[1:32:25] and it was an important
[1:32:26] not a whole lot of money you know i
[1:32:28] needed some money and all of a sudden i
[1:32:29] wasn't even in the message i was in an
[1:32:30] apostolic church all of a sudden i saw
[1:32:32] this light in the corner and this corner
[1:32:34] went that light came this way and began
[1:32:37] to roll and roll and roll and when it
[1:32:39] came to
[1:32:40] boom
[1:32:41] there it was
[1:32:43] the amount of money i needed i picked it
[1:32:45] up scooped it up and did what i needed
[1:32:46] to do with it see what people don't
[1:32:48] understand god is not a system
[1:32:54] huh
[1:32:55] oh you said well what do you mean what
[1:32:57] about that auntie she wasn't even a part
[1:32:59] of nobody's church that we know of
[1:33:02] hallelujah but she was praying because
[1:33:05] her son amen had a venereal disease and
[1:33:08] he was dying
[1:33:12] and she prayed
[1:33:14] is that right
[1:33:16] yes
[1:33:16] and god broke her into a vision what is
[1:33:19] a vision nothing but a dimensional thing
[1:33:23] took her into the future
[1:33:24] and she stood at that gate waiting for
[1:33:27] the elijah
[1:33:29] is that right didn't know who he was
[1:33:31] didn't know his name
[1:33:33] but she saw him she saw him even
[1:33:35] carrying a briefcase and then when he
[1:33:37] didn't have the briefcase she said
[1:33:38] where's your briefcase he said i left it
[1:33:40] back there
[1:33:41] walked by the lady and she had been
[1:33:43] standing out there all morning had you
[1:33:45] on her back
[1:33:47] when he walked up he says how she says
[1:33:49] howdy parson he said how do you know i'm
[1:33:52] a person because god doesn't show me
[1:33:56] that's all i'm saying see when you
[1:33:59] consecrate yourself and get in tune with
[1:34:02] god god don't care who you are where you
[1:34:04] are god answer prayer
[1:34:08] but you got to be in a consecrated state
[1:34:10] you can't be like a loose loose like we
[1:34:13] are we've been that but people i'm
[1:34:15] telling you it is an urgency you and i
[1:34:18] we must do what we can do to be more
[1:34:21] consecrated that comes by prayer that
[1:34:23] comes by reading your word listening to
[1:34:25] your text whatever it takes and
[1:34:27] separating yourself from all unbelief
[1:34:32] only those kind is going to go in the
[1:34:33] rapture i'm telling you
[1:34:36] that's it
[1:34:40] and i'm praying
[1:34:42] lord have mercy
[1:34:44] every day i pray lord have mercy
[1:34:47] direct me lord have mercy when i falter
[1:34:51] lord have mercy
[1:34:53] right
[1:34:54] because i want to see every dark spot
[1:34:57] everything that's not like god
[1:34:59] i want to see that temperance and that
[1:35:01] patience and that right i had a brother
[1:35:03] preach that a little bit the other day
[1:35:05] up there and then he preached on
[1:35:06] temperance and everybody we had to hear
[1:35:08] it down lord have mercy
[1:35:10] because that's where the devil get most
[1:35:12] of us
[1:35:14] right with that temper
[1:35:16] you know we fly off the handle we get
[1:35:18] all upset and blow up listen that ain't
[1:35:20] jesus
[1:35:22] that ain't god that's making you do that
[1:35:25] and you know what whether the devil is
[1:35:26] in your spirit or outside on you on your
[1:35:29] right or left hand side it don't matter
[1:35:31] it doesn't matter because you just
[1:35:33] allowed him to break whatever god was
[1:35:35] trying to seal up
[1:35:38] now you got to start it all over
[1:35:41] god help us
[1:35:43] i know i preached i broke my watch i
[1:35:45] shouted too much
[1:35:48] i did i really did
[1:35:51] my watches can't take i that's why when
[1:35:53] i lost my other watch my other watch was
[1:35:55] the better watch but anything that
[1:35:57] the electricity can kill
[1:36:00] i kill it
[1:36:03] hey
[1:36:07] ain't god good
[1:36:09] see christ is the head of the body is
[1:36:10] that right
[1:36:11] and wherever the head is the body is
[1:36:14] with it you understand me now how many
[1:36:17] y'all believe y'all the body of christ
[1:36:20] if you believe you're the body of christ
[1:36:22] that means jesus will always be with you
[1:36:25] the prophet god said the when that
[1:36:26] scripture says that the angel of the
[1:36:28] lord in camp about you know it means
[1:36:31] what do you know that he he put stakes
[1:36:33] down
[1:36:34] yeah he doubt he never leaves you
[1:36:37] he's that man or that he's that spirit
[1:36:40] that you can't see but he's always there
[1:36:43] and he said the angels he said they all
[1:36:45] are camp you know what i mean that that
[1:36:47] means they circle you
[1:36:50] they encamp they know what you're doing
[1:36:51] they know what you're thinking and all
[1:36:53] of that oh god amen and they're always
[1:36:57] there for you
[1:36:59] but we don't use it
[1:37:01] we don't use the power that god has
[1:37:03] given us
[1:37:04] is that right and that's the way it was
[1:37:06] with elijah amen when the syrians were
[1:37:08] all around them and and and and and
[1:37:11] the servants of them
[1:37:14] were saying lord
[1:37:17] they're more of them than us
[1:37:20] elijah's
[1:37:21] knowing god
[1:37:24] says no it is not
[1:37:26] it's more of us
[1:37:28] than them
[1:37:30] that ever got nothing he has nothing on
[1:37:33] us we should never leave live a defeated
[1:37:35] life
[1:37:36] it's our choosing to do it because we
[1:37:39] fail to believe god's word
[1:37:42] hallelujah they are encamped they put
[1:37:45] they stay listen
[1:37:46] and nothing can come through you
[1:37:49] if you're under the blood satan can't
[1:37:52] come through the blood
[1:37:56] he can't do it
[1:37:58] so they are encamped about you
[1:38:00] ready for battle
[1:38:02] for your battle
[1:38:05] and elijah says lord open get hazel's
[1:38:08] eyes
[1:38:10] and then what did he see those fiery
[1:38:12] chariots
[1:38:13] they went from this world he opened the
[1:38:16] portal he saw he let him see what was in
[1:38:20] the other dimension not far from him but
[1:38:23] there
[1:38:25] that's what we fail to see it's not
[1:38:27] millions of miles away it's right here
[1:38:30] it's just spinning at a faster speed
[1:38:34] i'm almost done
[1:38:36] because you and i got to realize hey man
[1:38:38] we're getting ready to change dimension
[1:38:40] we say that song one of these mornings
[1:38:42] it won't be long they'll look for me and
[1:38:44] i'll be gone that's true
[1:38:48] hallelujah
[1:38:50] right
[1:38:51] and understand if you're not consecrated
[1:38:54] more than likely even if you saw the
[1:38:57] dead rays you wouldn't comprehend it
[1:39:01] because the many of them saw the dead
[1:39:04] raised when jesus raised from the dead
[1:39:06] and the graves were open the bible says
[1:39:09] many
[1:39:10] saw 500 i believe it was
[1:39:14] but how many showed up to the upper room
[1:39:17] you understand me they saw it but
[1:39:20] couldn't comprehend what it really was
[1:39:24] y'all understand me and if you're not
[1:39:26] consecrated that's why the bible says
[1:39:28] you've got to be careful you could be
[1:39:29] entertaining angels on the west
[1:39:33] you got to be mindful in the spiritual
[1:39:36] things
[1:39:39] but if you're all upset all the time and
[1:39:41] frustrated and everything that is not an
[1:39:43] atmosphere from heaven
[1:39:46] you got to rebuke that
[1:39:48] i'm talking to all of us we love just
[1:39:50] whether yesterday or whatever
[1:39:52] forgive me i i got a little upset and
[1:39:54] what it was the devil poor one
[1:39:56] because i i've been trying my best to
[1:39:58] pray first
[1:40:00] right
[1:40:01] but i had taught i had eve texted
[1:40:03] brother about a haircut that i had
[1:40:05] gotten to my
[1:40:06] grandson today and that's what the devil
[1:40:08] used me check the phone to see what he
[1:40:11] right so i did that i listened i always
[1:40:13] listen to her messages
[1:40:14] i mean when i say brother branham's
[1:40:16] message i listen
[1:40:18] every day something every day but but
[1:40:21] here i just i was listening to that and
[1:40:24] anyway
[1:40:26] there's a girl in my neighborhood who
[1:40:28] brings her dog by my house just to use
[1:40:30] the restroom in my yard
[1:40:40] and i'm irritated
[1:40:42] because she see me on the porch
[1:40:44] and she's smiling
[1:40:46] i don't care if you got a bag in your
[1:40:47] hand
[1:40:49] pull him on the other side
[1:40:52] these are my thoughts i'm just letting
[1:40:53] you know i i had to confess make it
[1:40:55] right
[1:40:56] but then my wife told me she had to pick
[1:40:58] up some stuff
[1:41:02] and all i could do is see this girl
[1:41:06] because i'm mowing the dog lawn in the
[1:41:08] back and i'm like she must have left
[1:41:10] because we was out of town i'm thinking
[1:41:11] she must have left her dog loose because
[1:41:13] what this doing in the backyard
[1:41:16] so the devil's working on me
[1:41:20] i wish i had a tape recorder so you
[1:41:22] could hear what i said and how i said
[1:41:24] what i said
[1:41:27] and then my wife said what you gonna do
[1:41:30] i said i'm gonna report
[1:41:33] that's after i calmed down
[1:41:37] it didn't stop their brothers and
[1:41:38] sisters after god had given me victory i
[1:41:41] confessed my wife and said lord forgive
[1:41:42] me see but god allowed that to happen
[1:41:45] to let me see
[1:41:47] exactly where my temper was
[1:41:50] you see
[1:41:51] it's not in line yet
[1:41:53] because see that's stupid
[1:41:55] those things shouldn't even bother you
[1:41:58] you understand what i'm saying
[1:41:59] i mean it's not that you don't notice it
[1:42:01] but it shouldn't get you upset
[1:42:04] and i was upset
[1:42:05] and it's hard for me to get upset it
[1:42:07] really is but when i do
[1:42:09] y'all so i'm trying to get that to a
[1:42:11] place where i'm completely dead and rot
[1:42:14] right till nothing moves me
[1:42:17] that's what i want
[1:42:19] then i go to my chiropractor and i'm
[1:42:20] telling him about the story and he says
[1:42:22] well yeah my neighbor get irritated with
[1:42:24] me because i take my dog and i'm like
[1:42:30] i said sir if i wanted to do that kind
[1:42:32] of stuff what people are doing with bags
[1:42:34] i'll get me a dog
[1:42:39] i haven't had about five of them already
[1:42:41] and i said then you fall in love with
[1:42:42] them and then they die
[1:42:44] i'm i said five or six dollars i can't
[1:42:47] do it no more
[1:42:49] so anyway i know i'm off the message but
[1:42:51] y'all forgive me i want to confess that
[1:42:53] to you
[1:42:55] because i want you to understand that
[1:42:57] all these little things remember solomon
[1:42:58] says
[1:42:59] it is
[1:43:01] the little foxes that spoil the vine
[1:43:05] don't tell me that the bird of blood of
[1:43:07] jesus christ cannot perfect him
[1:43:10] that's what we're saying
[1:43:12] if we're saying oh god i can't overcome
[1:43:14] you're saying that the blood of jesus
[1:43:16] christ is not powerful enough to correct
[1:43:19] that error
[1:43:21] and that's definitely a lie from the
[1:43:23] devil
[1:43:25] that is a lie oh you mean to tell me my
[1:43:28] god your god can hold the moon in place
[1:43:31] bring the sun up every day
[1:43:34] makes the birds sing and whatever song
[1:43:36] they're singing and you know all of
[1:43:38] these things everything is moving by the
[1:43:40] power of god and all of a sudden he
[1:43:42] comes to you and can't do nothing
[1:43:45] that's nonsense
[1:43:47] you mean to tell me god can raise a man
[1:43:50] jesus can raise a man from the dead that
[1:43:53] has been rotted four days dead four days
[1:43:55] and rotted bring him back about the
[1:43:58] grave with brand new skin
[1:44:00] and he can't heal you
[1:44:02] he can't deliver you
[1:44:04] he healed the leopards
[1:44:06] young i mean nose and fell off and hands
[1:44:09] off and whatever limb that was off and
[1:44:12] restored them back to normal you mean to
[1:44:14] tell me my god can't do
[1:44:17] see what it is we've allowed science to
[1:44:20] blind our minds
[1:44:22] with reasoning and processing you can't
[1:44:25] have processing
[1:44:27] with the word it comes by faith you
[1:44:30] believe god
[1:44:32] only believe and when you only believe
[1:44:34] all things are possible
[1:44:38] hallelujah what's going to happen to you
[1:44:39] when you get into a state and the
[1:44:41] doctors say i can't do no more because
[1:44:43] oh well i'm dying no
[1:44:46] when they can't do it i know the man who
[1:44:48] can
[1:44:53] listen no matter how little if you're a
[1:44:55] little washed woman if if you're just a
[1:44:58] a brother
[1:45:00] that don't have don't know his abc's and
[1:45:03] don't make any difference who you are
[1:45:05] you are in christ trump over all things
[1:45:09] and you and your authority is over every
[1:45:12] demon and every power that the devil has
[1:45:16] you're in christ
[1:45:18] you need to triumph
[1:45:20] you love the lord
[1:45:22] now i i got a lot more but i'm not going
[1:45:23] to i'm not going to go on because i feel
[1:45:25] like i've done enough enough let me read
[1:45:28] this one scripture and then i'm going to
[1:45:29] close
[1:45:30] because i want you to understand that
[1:45:32] we're not talking about a time nobody
[1:45:34] knows how the rapture is going to take
[1:45:35] place
[1:45:36] but we know one thing that will be
[1:45:38] changed
[1:45:40] from this mortal to immortality
[1:45:43] and we know that by god's grace when we
[1:45:45] see those those loved ones that's going
[1:45:48] on
[1:45:49] right they'll be here to be between 30
[1:45:51] to 40 days is that right
[1:45:53] come on somebody that's the truth
[1:45:55] you know i was i i meant to list look up
[1:45:57] something i have to look it up later but
[1:45:59] nevertheless when it comes to god you
[1:46:02] must understand that
[1:46:03] we'll be missing
[1:46:05] and they won't know it
[1:46:07] so it can't be something that's so
[1:46:10] monumental that the world can see
[1:46:13] it ain't gonna be thousands of people
[1:46:16] and everybody's looking at them
[1:46:18] you understand me it's a secret
[1:46:21] catching away
[1:46:23] it's a way that people will never know
[1:46:26] we're gone and so when the tribulation
[1:46:28] period strikes they're gonna say i
[1:46:30] thought just like they thought in john
[1:46:33] the baptist day
[1:46:34] here was john the baptist
[1:46:37] preaching
[1:46:38] and some of his own disciples
[1:46:40] didn't even know he had the spirit of
[1:46:42] elijah because they said to jesus jesus
[1:46:45] we thought that before the tribulation
[1:46:47] come elijah would show up and jesus said
[1:46:50] but elijah has already come
[1:46:52] and they've done to him exactly what
[1:46:54] they wanted to do
[1:46:56] right and what they did not understand
[1:46:58] is that
[1:46:59] you understand what i'm saying
[1:47:01] elijah didn't have to pray for john the
[1:47:04] baptist didn't have to pray for the holy
[1:47:06] ghost he was born with it
[1:47:12] you understand me when he came out of
[1:47:14] his mother's womb he had god in him
[1:47:19] and jesus at the age of 33
[1:47:22] is when the holy ghost came and fielded
[1:47:27] this is my beloved son in whom i'm well
[1:47:29] pleased to dwell in
[1:47:32] he was the word
[1:47:34] but his anointing came at his baptism
[1:47:37] y'all understand me and that anointing
[1:47:39] led him into the desert
[1:47:41] 40 days and 40 nights to be tempted of
[1:47:44] the devil
[1:47:46] there in the devil in the desert he
[1:47:48] whipped the devil
[1:47:50] hallelujah he whipped him in the lust of
[1:47:53] the flesh he whipped the last the pride
[1:47:55] of life
[1:47:56] right
[1:47:59] every three all three of them thus to
[1:48:01] the eye listen to the flesh and the
[1:48:02] proud of life he whooped the devil he
[1:48:04] became lord and he told the devil he
[1:48:07] says listen
[1:48:08] you worship the lord your god
[1:48:11] what are you saying i'm your god you
[1:48:13] worship me i'm not going to bow down and
[1:48:15] worship you
[1:48:16] right the word do not bow
[1:48:21] we don't bow to no circumstance
[1:48:24] we do not bow
[1:48:27] we control
[1:48:29] hallelujah is that that's not wrong to
[1:48:31] say that word
[1:48:33] god told adam in the beginning so do
[1:48:36] bring everything under your control
[1:48:39] you're the head of all of this
[1:48:41] hallelujah and jesus christ has brought
[1:48:44] us as john is with christ we are the
[1:48:47] head of our situation
[1:48:49] what we need to do is begin to pray seek
[1:48:52] god and see what he wants us to say
[1:48:55] concerning our situations whatever he
[1:48:58] says say it say it and move in faith
[1:49:01] with it
[1:49:03] that's what this message has come to do
[1:49:05] put the bride of jesus christ in her
[1:49:07] position so when he comes
[1:49:10] we'll move out of this dimension with
[1:49:12] him
[1:49:14] people is closer than what we think
[1:49:17] it's praying time
[1:49:19] it really is praying time and you know i
[1:49:22] look at a lot of people who are in the
[1:49:24] message and they think because i i know
[1:49:26] the message god sent the prophet that
[1:49:28] ain't it
[1:49:29] when that became the message
[1:49:32] hallelujah
[1:49:34] you got to go beyond that
[1:49:35] the message has always been jesus christ
[1:49:39] is that right john said listen i'm not
[1:49:42] even worthy of losing the shoe lashes
[1:49:44] him that come after me he's greater than
[1:49:46] i
[1:49:47] john whole ministry was to point to him
[1:49:50] brother manner's ministry was to point
[1:49:51] to him
[1:49:52] 1963 he pointed to him and said that's
[1:49:55] my lord
[1:49:57] and the word that came with that is
[1:49:59] unfolding constantly unfolding and the
[1:50:01] whole point is it's about you
[1:50:05] it is about you
[1:50:07] so you can see who you are and to see
[1:50:10] that you've been redeemed and you have
[1:50:11] been predestinated not to fall
[1:50:16] people of god we got is so good we don't
[1:50:18] know how good we got it
[1:50:22] i'm serious because when you really
[1:50:24] understand election and predestination
[1:50:27] it'll have you almost out of your mind
[1:50:28] screaming i scream all the time in my
[1:50:30] mind
[1:50:31] i really do
[1:50:33] if i was to really let it lose people
[1:50:35] say you know he's crazy yeah because i
[1:50:37] am
[1:50:40] you know i i realize my perfection is
[1:50:42] not me it's of him
[1:50:45] i came through every faith there was
[1:50:47] baptism
[1:50:48] i went to the methodist
[1:50:50] catholic apostolic
[1:50:54] you name it searching for god
[1:50:56] and one day i says lord where are you he
[1:50:58] says i'm in my word
[1:51:01] and when he said that
[1:51:03] things began to change
[1:51:05] and the message found me
[1:51:08] lester
[1:51:20] in the morning when i ride
