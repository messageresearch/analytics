e okay you one and Savior Jesus Christ we thank God for his goodness and his Grace thank him for his mercy and all that he has done for us amen we thank the Lord for allowing us to be here today in his name because the Bible says whenever we gather we should Gather in his name and when We Gather in his name there he is in the midst of us so we want to thank God for his Precious Blood and his great Mercy in moments like these I'll sing out a song I'll sing out a love song to Jesus in moments like these I lift up my hands I lift up my hands to you Lord singing I Love You Lord singing I Love You Lord singing I I love you Lord I love you once again in Moment Like This I'll sing out a song I'll sing out a love song to Jes Jesus in moments like the I lift up my hands I lift up my hands to

mercy in your grace we thank you Father for allowing us to be here tonight though we be few in numbers Lord that's okay because you said where two or three are gathered in your name there you are in the midst and I pray Lord God that you bless this little bible study that we're going to do tonight I believe that we've been inspired Hallelujah to go this way and we pray father for those who are here that we may uh not only hear the word but receive receive the word and be blessed by the word in your name Jesus Christ have mercy upon us and give us your divine grace in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen may be seated I'm sorry we're going to start in Ephesians tonight and uh by the grace of God I think it's so important that we know our position uh we know what brother brandom says uh uh about Ephesian paralleling or Joshua paralleling uh Ephesians because it was the time of in Joshua not only crossing over into the promised land but coming to that adoption and We Know by the grace of God that uh the book of Ephesian is amazing uh because it's not just uh milk but it's truly meat it's deep and I trust by the grace of God that through our study um the Lord will broaden our understanding of the revelation of who we are and why we are here uh in this uh time and daytime okay so anyway uh we can stand and we'll read a few verses of Ephesians beginning at the first chapter and it reads Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen us Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of s according to the riches of his grace wherein he have abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence amen father we once again thank you for the reading of your word we pray that you would give us Grace to follow through in the way that you would have us tonight that each and every one of us would leave out here with the blessing Lord in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated when we think about uh the Ephesians Church age we must understand uh what it's all about and understand when Paul came along to teach or to write to the Ephesus Church the prophet of God said Ephesus was a mature church it was a church CH in which uh God could speak to on a higher level than he could to Corinthians not that God didn't speak great things to Corinthians but if you remember the Corinthians were very connal in mind they were always fussed and carrying on like the church in galatia they always you know they had a difficult time in the in the transition in which God was trying to bring them through I'm going to read something here coming from the Ephesian Church age and uh bear with me with these in my mouth so that's where you getting this funny sound Christianity at Ephesus was where the Jews lived at Ephesus and it was founded about ad 53 or 55 Christianity was planted there by St Paul later St Paul spent three years at Ephesus Paul teaching uh bored great influence to the believer at Ephesus next you had Timothy was the first Bishop of the Church of Ephesus Paul wrote to the church at Ephesus in Paul's time it was a great church now I want to say that using that word Bishop because a lot of time people uh don't understand here brother R said he was the first bishop and what he's saying is that uh uh he was the first a pastor or Elder however you want to say it he was young man but yet and still when it came to the gospel he was of age you see so it's not the natural age this little thing here that God is concerned about he tells us not to be a novice and a novice is somebody who's just learning but Timothy had been under the schooling of Paul for so long I mean he was Paul called him his child or his son in the gospel so you see he was well understood uh U used by God in in this uh Ephesus age and no doubt Timothy stayed with the teachings of of of Paul Paul wrote to the church at Ephesus in Paul's time and it was a great church I love that it was a great church in the time of Paul uh Ephesus means the very name Ephesus mean let go relaxed backsliding called by God God now ain't that amazing how that Spirit of backsliding was with such a powerful church because you see if Ephesus had remain as strong throughout all the ages you know I don't know where we'd be maybe the Rapture would have taken long uh Place long time ago because as I said to you before in in in some of the messages Ephesus had all the gifts you know the only thing they did not have was the Capstone the because that was for our age you had to have seven Church ages uh because there were seven angels because there were seven Mysteries and each Church age you you you can't uh say that Paul didn't have because Jesus Christ is the Alpha and the Omega so the fullness of God and of of the beginning of the church and the ending of church amen was the same and this is why the prophet said I preach everything that Paul preached see so it's an important that we stay amen with the word word and and and with uh how can I say it God's way of bringing us to Perfection right Ephesus mean very name means let go relax backsliding God called by God the backsliding church God acknowledged first their Works their labor and their patience God rebuked their living live leaving their first love for backsliding and for no longer bearing light oh that's amazing Ephesus was not a deceived Church it failed Itself by not continuing in perfect love isn't that amazing and we wonder you know how we can become a great church is by the way of love God's love it has to be it can't be uh filio love it has to be agape love and to return back to your first love is to return back to the love that you had for God when he first saved you see and that's that's the thing a lot of times Things become so common to us we fail to see if that that's exactly what the enemy wants to do to us make it common make it simple make it dead you know without life because he knows that God doesn't like that kind of atmosphere God is a fire and God loves fire amen I I I love that listen Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ this is what I like by the will of God and we know that our our prophet in our day was by the will of God right it wasn't by man man didn't make him that and no man made Paul matter of fact Paul wasn't even in the equation till after Jesus Christ had died uh was buried and resurrected he came at a time when the church was persecuted or being persecuted and by our knowledge of the message we understand that Paul was the uh not only the angel to the Ephesus age but he was an apostle yeah and we know by God's grace he he prophesied so he was a prophet as well I mean many things Paul has prophesied uh when he was here uh we're now living through and seeing the words that Paul by inspiration spoke and wrote to the Church of Ephesus can you imagine that church not knowing but I'm sure Paul knew something more than he told them but one of the things that Paul had them he kept them on fire with the fact that God can return at any time see if they had thought God was going to it was going to take 2,000 years for God to return the fire would have died instantaneously but no they kept in their heart the Lord Jesus Christ could could come at any time and remember now uh what we call really really bad what they called bad was bad but not like this bad you understand me so when they saw worldly things we look at it as almost like it it was it was it was all right that's Holiness but they saw little things that we couldn't see because it was the seed that was to spring up later on right Grace be to you and peace from God our Father from the Lord Jesus Christ now like like I was saying to the other day a man has to understand what Grace is if you don't know what Grace is if you you're going to struggle between law and Grace Grace and law you're going to be tossed to and fro like a double minded man because you got to understand Grace and because in Grace when you understand it Satan cannot accuse you well he can and he will try to accuse you but you understand your your life is hidden in Christ and that you're under the blood of Jesus you can't be under the blood and not under the blood you either under it or not under it and thank God that we are we are under the blood of Jesus Christ this is what gives us the peace of God to know that our Salvation is unconditionally unconditional right blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us and I love this particular part of the scripture with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ and like I said the other day on Wednesday there are more than one kind of a blessing God is rich in blessings I mean if you if you read psalms uh 103 it says you know it talks about all the blessings and don't forget all the benefits that comes with your salvation their spiritual blessings their material and financial blessings Their undeserved Blessings and their unsolicited blessings amen so you got to understand that God is just a blesser and the Lord the Lord says uh you you know a lot of time people don't understand how blessings come blessings come when God has determined them to show up right he is the controller of all things and uh I tell you it's so amazing uh just the I was telling our brother how I I uh I can tell you I went to to borrow some money uh from the bank and I had my reasons for doing that uh uh not that my pocket is empty but I wanted to do something but the very thing that that I was denied with God had a sister called me and gave it to me so God didn't want me to borrow the money God wanted to bless me yall understand me so by the grace of God this is how God blesses people when they really keep their hearts and mind on God and don't get me wrong let me say it like this I understand Grace I'm not talking about disgrace I understand Grace and I understand that the only way I'm going to be saved is by way of Grace I I I make mistakes how often every day I ask for God forgiveness how often every day brother brandom said a man backslide every day so we do it's like without the blood of Jesus Christ without the blood we'll be miserable creatures right now the thing that I love about this is because God has chosen Us in him and we've gone through that so many times but I think a lot of times people don't fully understand what election is but I'll read that fourth verse and I'm going a little bit too fast according as he have chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world now I want you to think about what we just read according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world what makes you believe that you have been chosen it's not in your head it's in your heart and you don't understand why or how but there's something that amens it when you say he's been chosen you've been chosen and that's what I'm talking about it's something that you cannot explain because it's supernatural can I say it like this it's really the seed of Faith that's really what it is it's the seed of Faith right and you've been chosen him before the found foundation of the world that what that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love now my question is how are you going to be holy oh I'm not going to steal I'm not going to kill I'm not going to lie you can go through the Ten Commandments live them all and steal be filthy Holiness doesn't come by your Deeds Holiness come by the Holy Ghost if you're going to see a Holy Mountain it's because God is on the mountain if you're going to see a holy person because God is in the Holy person that's it in our minds we can't even comprehend Holiness we can't and if you if you if God is moving you up up the the the statue of a perfect man if you're moving up that ladder the closer you get to the top the more filthy you see yourself being right because you know why because you see more light the closer you get the lighter the brighter right and and you and I must understand is because what he elected us if we just get that in people's mind like I I I asked a question how many of y'all believe y'all serpent seed raise your hand nobody raise it so that that shows something that you're agreeing with that you're not serpy there's something in you that will not allow you you to admit that so there's only two seeds people and if you can acknowledge you're not serpent seed that means you're seed of God and if you are a seat of God that means you ought to be about your father's business we don't have much time left but I believe that we in this in this evil time y'all know I know it's difficult to press isn't it amen it's not easy this is a this is like like the prophet of God said you know Darkness covered the Earth and he says oh my God he says he said there's such a pressure of Darkness on people they can't help but to do what they doing am the darkness make us do the evil right but greater is he that's in us than he that is in the world we must you can't survive this age and this day without reading bread reading your word every day give us this day our daily bread you're going to either read the word or listen to the message you got to feed your soul is that right because brother bandham said that's the the soul of the Holy Ghost feeds off of the word and listen if you don't have one scripture that you can remember remember it it took one stone to kill the giant right so you got to understand by the grace of God that his election and uh um we're dealing with amen has is something God did himself now I ain't talking about having in head I'm talking about having it here right as long as you got it in your head you can be lost until it drops into your heart you see what I'm saying Upon This Rock I'll build my church what you talking about the gates of hell not prevailing where because Jesus sits on the throne in your your heart Satan's in your head Jesus in your heart election within the Bible is that is the favor of God to what to some individual or some group or another and and you say well what do you mean now now I'm going to add some more to it because everybody's elected whether you're seat of God or whether you're not because when you get Judah Judah Judas was elected he was in the word but he was the negative seed he was a seed of of of discrepancy or if you want to say it like this he was the opposite he was Satan's seed but he was in the word see but the positive seed the seed that comes out of God is who we are there we were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world we quote that all the time W Hallelujah and as soon as the Storm come boom it's true we so easily forget but you know we must understand we're egos egos have a different mind they know how to uh Fly Above the storm right they know how to do all of that so I'm saying this and even even you think I think I this is what I think about sometimes and and I think about these Apostles and Prophets I just uh saw a little clipping where they were saying this one died this way this one died this way this one died this way I mean horrible deaths and these people encountered their deaths with joy you understand what I mean I don't think they were just laughing but inside there was no fear to go all the way with God right and that's how it is in this day you say oh I'm bride I'm brde people of God there's a difference you know what I'm saying you might even be a fig tree but you got to have some fruit on it you got to you got to show something because the Bible said if if if if a branch doesn't produce anything God cuts it off and guess what it just Withers away it's good for nothing right so when it comes to this church I don't care if 99% of the people are not on fire for God you got to contend for your faith amen you got to be on fire for God because you recognize who you are is that right I can you know we we know about the the African brother that was you know knew his father was a king you got to remember see if you don't renew your mind you got to renew your mind every day to to understand to con constantly say I'm bride I'm chosen I'm elected you know when you start feeding yourself confessing yourself like the prophet of God said there's an angel that has to make that confession come to pass but if you don't confess it if you don't announce it if you don't you know you spend time you know thinking oh I'm not this I'm not that somehow the vision of who you are will disappear don't get me wrong no matter what you go through nothing can take away your election to be bride nothing can take away that predestination now I'm going tell you something about predestination predestination will carry you to where you supposed to be at the end of the day you will have accomplished everything that God predestinated you to dojah and the reason being is because he how you say I I got it here I said what is it because God has a purpose in election God just don't throw his hat up or throw a coin down and just where it lands no God as I said the other day he prepares the table he sets everything in order and nothing can break that order right and if something should try to interfere with that order God comes around and move it right back into place right because let let's say how the word of God tells us that Israel was sojourned in Egypt for 400 years well Moses messed up the people messed up and so they had to stay there a little longer right but nevertheless it still came to pass what seemed to have thrown uh something off it could not defeat the word because the word can never come back void so who are you who are you you are the word that's right that's right brother bam said Mary was a carrier of the word but now you are the word right if you and God has joined together by the baptism of the Holy Ghost by the infilling of God in you you and the you and Jesus Christ are one right see purpose in election that's why I try to tell people God didn't bring us to this message just to be another church he he didn't bring us here to be dead and you know he didn't bring us here to to keep quiet you said well nobody want to listen to me nobody listen if Jeremiah can do it we can do it Jeremiah didn't have one convert amen and those that was Christians already Believers already you know what I mean but who who repented maybe I skipped something in the scripture I never saw one but he preached to a hard-hearted people right and everything that he I can't get through I get over Jeremiah because I see the day of Jeremiah we're living it that's right the inspiration the the the the the spirits that was in that day has now caused the people to be hard hard hard-hearted uh blasphemers you know they don't take God's word seriously but those of us who are elected you know what's happening to us we're watching amen that's right we're praying amen understand me so understand that there's a a thing going on and and you're going to either fulfill the purpose of God in the foolish part or the wise part right and so God's purpose in election is that he alone Be glorified and that that that your that you will most certainly be saved in other words he he knows that you're going to glorify him I mean come on even when it came to uh Ahab when he messed up God say see how Ahab repented and see you and I must understand that even God gives repentance ain't nothing you're doing on your own so you can say well Lord God you know I helped you in this no you didn't help him do nothing now the beauty of this thing and I'm I know I'm moving fast the beauty of this thing is that with a full understanding of who you are in Ephesus that's where we are we're starting the Bible study in Ephesus the first chapter of Ephesus for those of you who weren't there when I when I started reading when you understand the the the the power of Ephesus or the power of Ephesians understand with with the church ages brother bandam basically showed us though this was the age where the word was full because you can't produce a Al Omega without the alpha being right right so the word of God that that came through Paul was the full word of God right now and so brother banham through his ministry had to come back and restore that he had to store everything that Paul preached but then were things that Paul couldn't say that brother Brandon was able to say Paul said I was I was into another dimension whatever whatever place I was I can't and it's unlawful for me to speak it so what was he saying it's for another day it's for someone else you see what I'm saying so we now know that brother bam didn't add anything to what Paul said he just it was open to him what Paul couldn't preach right the Alpha and the Omega so you and I must understand that there's a purpose for you being here not just to sit still to you going to live it like and I'm going to say it like this the life is the most important thing it's not whether you're a preacher it's not whether you sing it's not whether you're a musician or anything like that God want to see his life in The Believer and you know what that life is I'mma to cap it all off it started with Divine love it ends up with Divine love right but you say oh it it it started on faith faith is the bottom but brother say faith and love is are twins he so you got to understand that by the grace of God we must come to the same place because the Cornerstone has become The Headstone right and if they were able to do it we can do it it's God in us anyway election and predestination by the election of Grace we mean this true that all those who by the grace of God God alone right for Christ's sake through the means of Grace are brought to Faith are Justified and Sanctified and preserved in faith here in time that all these have already from eternity been endowed by God with faith and justification in other words all that we gain in this time in this third dimension all that we gain has already been given that's right we're just now working it out manifesting what God has already done right it's like he gave us everything let the prophet of God said every thing you need to make a Rapture is in the seed is already there and if we understand the Rapture we're already part of it and there's no way of turning it back or turning it off because God has already chosen you to be that right so I that's where the joy comes in you don't look at this you don't look at your failures what what what what in the preview of the church when that bride was was marching what was she looking at she wasn't looking at herself she was looking at the cross the bloody cross right and we said so many times and I'm guilty I'm guilty I'm guilty we so examine ourselves the way we do is quite wrong quite wrong and the reason why I say it like this because the priests never examined the man who brought the lamb that's right he examined the lamb and our lamb has been examined Hallelujah I'm getting a little excited our land was examined amen before he was crucified they thoroughly searched him out and tried to find fault in him and pilot said I find no fault right so Paul picks it up now predestination what is the Divine fore ordaining of all that will happen especially with regards to Salvation of some and not of others right for an example Jesus was pred predestinated right to be the Son of God and he was Judas was predestinated to be the son of predition and he was right both were spoken of in the Old Testament both were spoken spoken of in the New Testament and everything God said that would happen it happened you understand me so everything in the will of God for you to accomplish and the will of God for you to do whether you see it or not God will make it happen amen now I often think about that young boy with a few Fish and Loaves right no scripture said he was coming but he showed up and he did exactly what God wanted him to do at that moment and you never hear of him again like the woman with the issue of blood she's in history never have you you didn't hear no more after that just one thing the woman who moved up amen and gave those little two pin she was ordained to do that then after she did what she accomplished that's it and that's what a lot of time people don't understand a lot of times you accomplish the things you God wants you to do already and you looking who what else I'm what else remember brother Brandon what he said he said now I'm sitting here 56 whatever it was and he says listen I've done nothing for the Lord what if I don't get up from here and I'm thinking oh my God if you haven't done anything with the Lord where oh God where's my stuff where am I at in this picture so you got to understand it's something about us being saved truly saved cu no matter what we do we've never done enough never be able to do enough for God do what you can but you can't make it happen he has to make it happen but be in a place where if he wants to use you you'll be used right how is it done all of this is done by the full knowledge of God what a mighty God we serve right that God can create and I I still Marvel I Marvel at all of the creation of God and you see them every day don't you everything he's there sometime when I forget he'll send a robin on my porch or something you know I mean he always remind me he's there and and the point is this is why I say what are you what are you trying to hide for like like you know like like like like AEL or something you you know you done you done you know uh I'm sorry not able but uh know Adam like Adam you're trying to I'm sorry you're trying to hide why you trying to hide God see you not only God angels do too they're just in another dimension the Bible say we are encompassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses how you going to get rid of it oh nobody sees me oh yes he does the all see and I see everything guess what he knew you was going to do it huh is that wisdom that's just the word right that's the word to show you how so predestinated you are oh will I fail oops did God see that he saw am but he gave you the Holy Ghost anyhow because you got the Holy Ghost it doesn't mean that you're going to long as you got this you going to struggle with this thing Paul said kill it every day but it doesn't take away from your election right it doesn't take away from your predestination now don't don't get me wrong if you sin you're gonna pay for it God Ain going to just let you do anything and say okay I'll put you in heaven no you do sin you you going to pay for for cuz God cannot change yeah yeah people say well I just got saved and you know what about all of the stuff I had a brother-in-law who God saved just short PRI prior to his his leaving here and he died because of the wrong things he did he was an alcoholic but you know what he has such Grace God revealed to him you're saved but this is all about what you've done you know and he he encouraged me anyway you love the Lord just just trying to show you how so many people can you can you can take you can take this message and and you can use it in the wrong way right like people say whoa I'm so Justified as though I've never sinned in the first place and then you just do whatever you want to see that's wrong a true Christian is going to always try to live correct and right before God one thing I love about a true Christian a true Christian love to be corrected amen because you don't want to be wrong you love correction now your flesh don't but your soul do right Isaiah 431 one and two please Paul talking about election and all the things uh that's pertaining to Salvation trying to prove to us that you had nothing to do with it you didn't have nothing to do with it then and you got nothing to do with it now right uh they asked Jesus what are the works what what must what must we do when it comes to works and Jesus said believe on him whom God has sent y'all understand me just like I said last uh Wednesday you know the Eagle's Wings right and brother brandham was the type of that eagil that God used and as long as you hold fast to the wings he you saw through the gate you know what I'm saying you saw to those Heights that right because he said that Moses was the Eagle's Wings that brought Israel out of Egypt and so we know by the grace of God Amen that what God has sent to us is truly the way of escape the real Third Exodus right so Isaiah 431 through2 but now thus say the Lord that created thee oh Jacob and he that formed thee oh Israel fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have called thee by thy name Thou Art mine see this is the part now I'm going to protect you he's saying when thou passest through the waters I will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee and when thou walth through the fire thou shall not be burned now God did it all he's done it all he did it with Israel in the water right he did it with Shadrach mhach in the B AO in the fire I mean you know he he has proven himself throughout the out the years or the ages amen that he is God when th walth through the fire Thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame Kinder upon thee now who come on now that's nobody they says oh shadra me and I often wonder many times where there were all the other Jews when when when they were said if you don't bow Into the Fire you go where were all the Jews when Danel was caught you understand Jews were everywhere but evidently many of them were just Pretenders or something because God never mentions them it's just these few and let me say it like this this is why brother brandom said only a few is going to make a Rapture because you go to a message Church don't make you a Believer right sixth verse to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he have made us accepted in the Beloved right the glory of his grace accepted in the Beloved how what kind of terms I mean the terms of of these words that that really makes us feel safe you know when when somebody call you beloved they means you know you're my favorite you know there's a deep pleasure in that word or you you dear to my heart that's what beloved me dear to my heart or I I greatly love you so we are what accepted in the great I love you we are accepted in that place that you know God nothing Paul said and Paul had that Revelation who who because I most of the time we we say what but it ain't what is who shall separate me see because remember it was a who that separated Eve and Adam it's a who it's always people Devils behind flesh that literally throw people off or to backslide or to leave God you know but like I was telling somebody today I was telling my granddaughter I said there's nothing in me to leave God I don't care what I must go through I may not be walking as perfectly as I desire but there is nothing in me to ever leave God you know in 2013 you could ask people down in Lima the Lord showed me how people going to fall away and they did and I said that I said the churches going to change I said there'll be dead people sitting up in churches I'm not talking I'm talking about message churches the Lord showed me that and guess what since then what you see what do you see and they don't even see it they don't even see the death Angels attacking people only because they failed to go all the way to get that Holy Ghost in power you got to go all the way and this is what this is what you I want you to understand God said if you have that desire he gives it to you he count it as done it's the people who don't desire it right but if you got that desire to have the the fullness of God in you into a statue of a per man God count that desire as done because you couldn't have that desire without God right so that's that's his favor anybody ever favored anyone before somehow they get away with a lot of stuff don't they and that's where the other children say see you favor that one that means if I was to do that you would spank me but you're not going to spank that one so God has a favor and we are in the favor of God that's why he blesses us the way He blesses us he chasing us away and I tell you what I want to be chastised if I'm wrong I want that chase that's that's part of the adoption you got to spank the ones you you love and when he spanks us and corrects us that it don't think it's strange when you fall into d d Temptation knowing that the TR of your faith is more precious than gold yeah you need that I need that to get all of the darkness out of me how many of y'all want all the darkness out of you absolutely because see that is adoption when the light and the Shadows flee away in your life right you now you and God won right to the day break and the Shadows F flee away all your shadows are gone right no matter which way the Sun hits you they see God and that's how brother B said there in in Egypt we went there he said listen when the sun hit that pyramid he said there's no Shadows right I'm I'm I'm I'm trying to make it seventh verse in whom in whom we have Redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sin according to your Works no according to the riches of his grace wherein he have abound he have abound toward us in all wisdom and Prudence that mean he's poured it out you know he's you know when you pour something out you're not leaving not even a drop in the cup you're pouring everything out and listen you know and I know living in this most evilest age the way things are where would we be without Grace where would you be without the mercies of God and listen if God would pull back the blood none of us would be worthy and the only worthiness that we have is through Jesus Christ that's it it ain't your works even though we work we work to because we we want to show God our appreciation we live right to show him our appreciation and you know we we live right to to to to make him pleased but let me tell you something what pleases God no one pleases God but Jesus Christ that's why we have to be accepted in him he was the only one that was able to take the book not Moses not Elijah not nobody it was Jesus Christ Christ that's why Paul said my life is hi in Christ that's the only way you accept it you're not accepted any other way your laws your rules your bogs your culture no nothing can actually give you the give you place you in a place to be accepted it takes the blood of Jesus Christ it takes the holy spirit is that right because brother Bram said when God gives you the holy spirit it's his choosing amen that's right it's his choosing you you don't choose God God chooses you and he accepts you with the Holy Ghost right having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he have purposed in what himself and that goes right back to what God multiplying himself that's all it is God multiplying himself by birthing himself in you and me right we understand God gave that order to Adam and Eve in the beginning right and Eve messed up but think about it in this age in this time it's God who's giving birth amen Jesus Christ is giving birth to himself in you amen oh help us Lord that in the dispensation of the fullness of time I love this I'm a CL on this particular one that the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him listen what the prophet says Amen in the message um adoption for he says you think cancer is something and this is why we have to get be uh adopted because we know that there things coming on the Earth you know going to look make Co look like a toothache if you want to say it like that he said you think cancer is something the Bible said there's coming a time when men will rot right in their flesh and the Buzzard will eat off their carcasses before they even die cancer is a tooth toothache to what's coming but remember that horrible thing was forbidden in that day to touch those who had had the Seal of God that's what we're striving for now to get in in and be positionally placed in the kingdom of God before these horrible plague strikes oh how good this dispensation of time fullness of time The Inheritance in whom we also obtain inheritance and being predestinated see when no seals were open when God opened the seals that was the beginning of buing of time you said well everything hasn't come to an end but brother brandham described it he say it's a like a rocket goes up boo five and five then it keeps unfolding keeps unfolding and that's how the ending of time the fullness of time ends little by little by little by little by little but it's bringing everything to an end look at the world now everything is in chaos everything is falling you know why because everybody's moving by the spirit of destruction politics all over the world moving by destruction it they must they they can't even resist they don't even know why they doing what they doing but because the word said they would they have to do it right listen let me move on predestination is is for knowledge how did God know he could trust you to be a preacher his for knowledge he not not he that willth or he that runneth or he see it's God that showeth Mercy that's right predestination he knew what was in you he knows what in you before you even come on the earth he knowed what was in you before there was an an Earth for you to come on see that's him that's the infinite God infinite we're finite we can't only think finite it's been it's been so much to me since that what happened to me I don't know when I think there when I stood there for those few joyful moments and thought there's no Tomorrow there's no yesterday there's no sickness though there's no sorrow there's no little bit of happiness then a whole lot of Happiness it's all happiness oh my oh when I stood there and I said what is this and the voice said this is perfect love and everything that you ever loved and everything that ever loved you is here with you now and your presence and your present present us and you'll present us to the Lord Jesus Christ y'all heard this is what I was trying to say the other night you'll present us to the Lord Jesus Christ when he comes as trophies of your ministry I seen those beautiful women standing there all grab grabbing me and screaming my precious darling brother seeing those men and that shaggy hair around their necks and running grabbing me and saying oh our darling brother and I thought what do does this mean he said they're your people and I said my people there couldn't be that many brandom they Millions he said they're your converts Hallelujah they are your converts re you know why we forget these things we forget they're the sons uh they're the ones that said you see that one standing there the most beautiful woman I ever seen says she was pass 90 years old when you led her to God no wonder she's crying my darling brother said see she she'll never be old no more she passed from that she's in the Splendor of her youth she's standing here she can't she can't drink a cold a cold drink of of water she don't need it she can't lay down and sleep C she don't she don't get tired there's no tomorrow no yesterday no nothing every where where're eternity we're in the eternity now y'all heard him we're in eternity now but some Glorious Day the Son of God shall come and you will Jud you will be judged according to to the word that you preach to them oh brother I said will Paul have to bring his group see yes sir I said I preached it just exactly like Paul said it I never divide divide I never took into my Church Creeds or anything else I stayed the same and all of them screamed with one Accord we know that we're resting with Assurance said you will present us to him and then we'll go back to the Earth again to live forever oh my right so you say that's adoption folks you you he can't present to you uh uh him without the adoption right the dispensation of the fullness of time start started at the opening of the word like a candle exploding it would continue until all that sin all that sin call ceased right and so you you got to understand that now we're in a place uh God Gave Me a Song years ago I'm living in eternity and I didn't even know I didn't even fully understood what I was saying at that time but listen once you once the Holy Ghost is in you once God is in you and you're growing into that statue of Christ and once you are adopted and and and all I can tell you is like this God will complete the work he promised it whatever he started he will complete it and like brother Rand said he stays with it he stays with it you think well how I think about some of the the the Old Testament Saints and I know it's my hour up and I think sometime boy that was rough but you know what God had a purpose and I'm thinking about Samson no matter how much he messed up God had a purpose for Samson and he never fell short of what God called him to do and God is a warrior he'll set you up he'll put you right in that position and then expecting you to come fight you gonna fight your way out of this one right now I say it like that so you understand God said he always make a way of Escape always do you love the Lord then my hour is up but I trust that something was said to you tonight to rekindle the fire re Quicken that Spirit within you uh because right now Satan is doing everything he can to tear you down to tear your character down to make you feel bad and listen if you don't understand the scripture say it anyhow the joy of the Lord is my strength because soon as you lose your joy you lose your strength stand our gracious father God we thank you Father for this Bible study Lord we just starting uh the the lesson but oh my I I feel so good on the inside Lord I feel so good oh God about the word Lord because I know it was your word that quickened me I wasn't looking for you you came to me and Lord I just believe Lord God that these Brethren and sisters uh that are here tonight represent you Lord and represent the kingdom that we're we're all being baptized and born into and Lord we realize Lord God that these brothers and sisters are not just temporal but they're Eternal and may God may may may we see that so that we know that we we we should love one another here on Earth let thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven we must love we must forgive we must push and press amen into the will of God help us now that we we be vessels of honor and not vessels of Dishonor Lord that we may honor your word and honor your name in all things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen goodness I meant to ask some questions that iot second
