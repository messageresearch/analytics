[25:38] verse Ephesians 3 8-
[25:44] 21i and it
[25:46] reads unto
[25:48] me who am less than the least of All
[25:51] Saints is this given this Grace given
[25:54] that I should preach among the Gentiles
[25:57] the UN searchable Riches of
[26:08] Christ and to make all men

[26:15] mystery which from the beginning of the
[26:18] world have been hid in God who created
[26:22] All Things by Jesus
[26:26] Christ
[26:31] to the intent that now unto the
[26:34] principalities and powers in Heavenly
[26:36] places might be known by the church the
[26:40] manifold wisdom of God I
[26:50] think according to the Eternal purpose
[26:53] which he purposed in Christ Jesus our
[26:56] lord
[27:01] in whom we have boldness and excess with
[27:05] confidence by the faith of
[27:12] him wherefore I desire that you think
[27:15] not at my tribulations for you which is
[27:19] your
[27:25] glory this part I really love
[27:28] for this cause I bow my knees unto the
[27:31] father of our Lord Jesus
[27:37] Christ of whom the whole family in
[27:40] Heaven and Earth is
[27:44] named that he would Grant you according
[27:48] to the riches of his glory to be
[27:51] strengthen that's important amen with
[27:54] might by his spirit in the Inner Man
[28:04] that Christ May dwell in your hearts by

[28:38] Saints what is the breath and the length
[28:42] and the depth and the
[28:50] height hey this what he's writing here
[28:53] and to know the love of Christ not think
[28:57] about it not think you know
[29:01] it but to know it which passes
[29:05] knowledge that you might be filled with
[29:08] all the fullness of
[29:14] God hallelujah now unto him that is able
[29:18] to do exceedingly abundantly above all
[29:21] that we ask or think according to the
[29:25] power that worketh in us all

[32:03] a place where all the world may

[32:10] heaven in Jesus Christ name we amen amen
[32:15] you may be
[32:17] seated I am uh uh uh um almost without
[32:24] words but I want to thank God for his
[32:26] good
[32:28] goodness I thank him for his
[32:32] grace all that he he he he does for
[32:35] me uh I'm sure you can
[32:38] witness with me the love of
[32:41] God uh without it uh where would we
[32:46] be you see we're not like the
[32:49] hog who's constantly eating under the
[32:53] tree and never looks up to see where the
[32:56] apples are falling
[32:59] but we know where our blessings are
[33:01] coming
[33:02] from Hallelujah when he gives us life
[33:05] every
[33:06] day Hallelujah when he gives us a lip
[33:09] and tongue not to
[33:13] complain when he gives us a
[33:16] spirit to say Lord not my will but thine
[33:20] be
[33:21] done what an honor that is what a
[33:24] privilege that is what a blessing that
[33:26] is Amen to walk in the light as he is in
[33:30] the light amen because there are so many
[33:33] people who declare that they're walking
[33:36] in the light but the Bible said if you
[33:38] can't love your brother you're not
[33:41] walking in the light you are in darkness
[33:45] Hallelujah because the True Light Of God
[33:48] will not only give us a light to love
[33:50] each other like to fellowship with one
[33:54] another my message tonight
[33:58] concerns the
[34:00] heart and you know we've been talking
[34:02] about the
[34:04] heart and just the
[34:06] mind uh brother brandom says that is
[34:10] Satan who aims at the mind he aims at
[34:13] the head he don't mind giving you a head
[34:17] religion but Jesus Christ aims at the
[34:21] heart it is in the heart where the
[34:25] Throne of God is
[34:27] in the heart where the holies of
[34:31] holies takes
[34:34] resident the Bible says know ye not that
[34:38] ye are the temple of
[34:41] God often times we
[34:45] forget sometimes I
[34:47] forget uh if I if I would always
[34:51] remember I will never fall
[34:55] short but Satan makes us forget
[34:59] sometimes the how can the the the the
[35:03] worth the the value of having God on the
[35:09] inside I want to encourage you
[35:13] tonight and I want to reflect on the
[35:16] life you
[35:18] live because the life you
[35:21] live declares what kind of life you're
[35:25] in that's in you let's say the life you
[35:29] live will declare the life that lives
[35:33] within
[35:34] you Hallelujah you love the Lord I want
[35:38] to also encourage you
[35:41] tonight because the message cannot
[35:45] fail the word is open the book is open
[35:50] and and we who are the
[35:51] remnant of
[35:54] Leia We Are The Remnant we are the ones
[35:57] that God has pulled
[35:59] out and and and has opened this word To
[36:02] Us by the revealing of the Seven
[36:06] Seals and coming to see the seven Church
[36:09] ages and actually coming to understand
[36:13] the messenger of the
[36:15] hour Hallelujah and We Know by the grace
[36:18] of God that our time here is
[36:22] limited we come at the very end of
[36:25] itall the the drama is almost
[36:29] over Hallelujah we we're
[36:33] expecting at any time to see a
[36:37] translation Hallelujah because we as a
[36:40] bride we have heard the voice we heard
[36:45] the cry at
[36:47] midnight and we gone out to meet him
[36:51] Hallelujah and when we came to the door
[36:55] Hallelujah we would
[36:57] dressed by Malachi
[37:00] 4 y'all hear what I'm saying because the
[37:03] road was given to us by the prophet of
[37:07] the hour now you you got to understand
[37:10] what I mean he wasn't the Rob but he was
[37:15] responsible he was the one at the door
[37:18] handing the Roes out he was the only one
[37:22] that showed us and taught us what true
[37:27] Holy Ghost is hallelujah we know that
[37:31] the Holy Ghost is not just speaking in
[37:33] tongues of we know that the Holy Ghost
[37:37] is not just shouting we know that the
[37:39] Holy Ghost is not just amen having any
[37:43] kind of gift Hallelujah but the Holy
[37:46] Ghost is the gift that God gives you
[37:50] Hallelujah so what do you mean he said
[37:53] if you repent and be baptized in the
[37:57] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[37:59] of sins you shall receive the gift of
[38:03] the Holy Ghost but what is the gift of
[38:06] the Holy Ghost except the Holy Ghost
[38:10] himself justification May Ru for
[38:13] sanctification sanctification may ro for
[38:16] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[38:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost makes room for
[38:21] the person himself and that person is
[38:25] Jesus Christ himself
[38:28] hallelujah hallelujah that's right thank
[38:32] you
[38:35] Lord excuse me excuse me more just
[38:39] getting a little
[38:41] juicy but you
[38:43] see there was a
[38:47] question where would you rather be
[38:50] standing in heaven or the
[38:55] world and the answer answer to that
[38:57] question is the
[38:59] word because heaven and Earth shall pass
[39:04] away but the word of the Lord shall
[39:08] stand I thank God for the
[39:11] word one thing that we fail to see is
[39:16] that Israel was committed to the
[39:19] word they didn't understand it but they
[39:23] were committed to the
[39:25] law
[39:27] and they were
[39:29] instructed to learn the word to obey the
[39:33] word read it in the morning read it in
[39:37] the evening read it at night I want you
[39:40] to commit this word to your to your
[39:43] life I want you to write it upon here I
[39:46] want you to have something in your
[39:49] face so you can understand and see the
[39:52] word on a daily basis I want you to wear
[39:56] the word on your clothes I want you to
[39:59] wear the word
[40:00] everywhere what were they they were a
[40:03] shadow and a of the Bride Hallelujah
[40:08] because we of all ages are the only age
[40:13] that dresses
[40:15] completely in the full word we have the
[40:18] alpha we have the
[40:21] Omega understand me it was what the word
[40:25] brought prophet of God brought to us in
[40:28] this last day and if he wasn't the
[40:32] prophet we should look for another but
[40:35] the scripture doesn't show us another
[40:38] the only one that comes next is Jesus
[40:41] Christ
[40:42] himself Hallelujah but El has comeing
[40:47] gone but he has left a
[40:51] message Hallelujah for the
[40:55] bride
[40:57] Hallelujah let me say something to you
[41:01] it's easy the burden is
[41:04] easy and the burden is
[41:07] light Hallelujah all Israel had to
[41:11] do to make it to the promised
[41:15] land was to follow
[41:18] Moses they didn't have to do nothing
[41:21] else because Moses had the
[41:24] word hallelujah
[41:26] and Moses stayed with the word he broke
[41:29] the word one time when he was
[41:33] disobedient when he smoked the rock
[41:36] instead of speaking to it Hallelujah and
[41:40] God punished him for
[41:42] it Hallelujah is that right the Bible
[41:46] says even Jesus said if you follow
[41:52] me Hallelujah you follow me
[41:56] you will have eternal
[41:59] life you understand me why because it is
[42:02] a
[42:03] Shepherd that feeds the
[42:06] sheep and he is the great
[42:10] Shepherd let me go on let me go on to
[42:12] say
[42:13] this because I want you to see how easy
[42:16] it
[42:16] is God took us out of
[42:20] Le because Leia was all about dos and
[42:24] dunks you can't do
[42:26] you can't do that you can do this you
[42:29] can do that and all it did was make us a
[42:33] two child of
[42:35] hell because we were trying to work our
[42:39] way into heaven and you cannot work your
[42:43] way into
[42:44] heaven Jesus explained it he told
[42:48] Nicodemus in order to make it you must
[42:52] be born
[42:53] again hallelujah it's not about power
[42:57] it's not by mind but it's by my spirit
[43:00] say the Lord hallelujah you got to have
[43:03] the token you got to have the blood
[43:06] applied you got to have the life of God
[43:09] on the
[43:11] inside on the outside it must be on
[43:16] display
[43:18] hallelujah it's like a it's like a
[43:21] cattle or a lamb hallelujah what the
[43:24] farmers did
[43:26] in that day they would
[43:29] brand brand the uh
[43:32] cows when they were thorough breads is
[43:34] that
[43:35] right they were brand the cow the th
[43:39] bread the cow didn't do
[43:42] nothing the cow was the
[43:45] cow was under the right
[43:47] Shepherd in the right
[43:50] field bought with the right
[43:52] price Hallelujah the shepher bought the
[43:55] cow
[43:56] so it was it was the
[43:58] shepherd or the
[44:01] herdsman duty to Brand the
[44:05] cattle and whatever brand it was no
[44:09] matter how lost that cattle would
[44:12] be that owner would know that was his
[44:16] cattle by the brand Hallelujah and the
[44:20] Holy Ghost has done the same thing to
[44:24] the believer Hallelujah he sealed you
[44:29] and no matter how you
[44:31] wonder the Bible says God loves the
[44:36] backslider Hallelujah the brand is there
[44:40] and it cannot be
[44:43] removed see God's plan and purpose was
[44:47] to create man in His
[44:50] image and
[44:53] likeness that's why the devil hates you
[44:57] because when he see you he see the image
[45:00] of
[45:01] God because when Moses saw the image of
[45:05] God he saw the backside of a
[45:08] man
[45:09] Hallelujah and so God is a
[45:13] man he's not just a spirit anymore he's
[45:17] more than a spirit he has a body and
[45:21] that body was Jesus
[45:24] Christ Hallelujah but it doesn't stop
[45:28] there he had
[45:32] children amen he said I make them in my
[45:36] image and
[45:38] likeness not just good enough to be in
[45:41] the image because Fallen man is in the
[45:45] image but they're not in the
[45:48] likeness the likeness represents the
[45:51] character Hallelujah the
[45:54] quality the divine nature of God
[45:57] hallelujah and as long as man was in His
[46:00] image God could not be satisfied because
[46:04] he made Adam in His image and likeness
[46:07] so men had to be
[46:09] restored back to the likness of God and
[46:13] Peter tells us how to be restored he
[46:16] tells us there been an interest made for
[46:19] us an entrance made for us hallelujah
[46:23] into God by what the divine
[46:27] nature Hallelujah and the Bible says if
[46:31] that divine nature be in you you should
[46:34] not be Barren you'll never fall neither
[46:39] will you be
[46:41] unfruitful hallelujah thank you Lord
[46:45] hallelujah amen one thing about God he
[46:48] doesn't give you something and take it
[46:51] back once it's given it's
[46:53] given Hallelujah
[46:56] come on somebody you think about it the
[47:00] names were put on the L's Book of
[47:02] Life foundation of the world not only
[47:06] just your name your occupation what you
[47:10] will be in this world Hallelujah that
[47:15] woman at the
[47:16] well Jesus saw
[47:19] her the foundation of the world
[47:22] Hallelujah and when he called her unto
[47:25] himself
[47:26] he did not call her prostitute he called
[47:29] her
[47:31] daughter Hallelujah because in the mind
[47:34] of God you will always be Sons and
[47:37] Daughters no matter what this world
[47:39] formed you to be God has another plan
[47:43] for you and the Bible says that God has
[47:46] an expected end I don't know about you
[47:50] but I have an expected end and my
[47:53] expected end is perfection
[47:56] Hallelujah to be in His image and his
[48:01] likeness Hallelujah hallu no matter what
[48:04] I've got to do I'm like the psalmist
[48:07] Lord if you find anything that shouldn't
[48:10] be take it out and straighten me you are
[48:15] the part and I Am The Clay Mo me and
[48:20] make me
[48:22] Hallelujah yes sir but we got to
[48:26] continue to feed the ourselves the
[48:31] word your flesh doesn't like the
[48:34] word there's a war going on between your
[48:37] flesh and your spirit or your
[48:39] soul Hallelujah one is against the other
[48:42] is that right even brother brandham said
[48:45] your greatest enemy enemy Hallelujah is
[48:49] yourself that's that natural man
[48:52] Hallelujah but by the grace of God is he
[48:56] that is in us than he that is in the
[48:58] world Hallelujah you said well what do
[49:01] you mean brother Brooks I'm not trying
[49:04] to overcome I've already overcome
[49:07] Hallelujah that's why Paul said we're
[49:11] more than
[49:12] conquerors in Christ Jesus Hallelujah
[49:16] I'm going to take Paul's stance
[49:19] Hallelujah Paul was able to look at
[49:21] death and he says oh death where's your
[49:26] oh grave where is your Victory
[49:29] Hallelujah I love this portion he said
[49:32] thanks be to God who G us the victory
[49:36] through our Lord Jesus Christ I'm not
[49:39] looking to get the victory I already got
[49:43] the victory Hallelujah why because our
[49:47] lives are
[49:48] heal in Christ
[49:50] Jesus hallelujah oh we can't even
[49:54] comprehend it but I'm trying I'm trying
[49:57] to get it when the word said we are his
[50:03] offspring a lot of time people don't
[50:05] even think when they get the Holy Ghost
[50:09] they just think they get a good
[50:11] feeling oh man it made me cry it made me
[50:15] feel
[50:17] good but don't you
[50:20] understand when you get the Holy
[50:22] Ghost
[50:24] birth into eternal
[50:29] life eternal life just doesn't come into
[50:32] you you go into
[50:36] it you literally go back to where you
[50:40] were before we started in this time
[50:44] space Hallelujah that's why the Bible
[50:48] says we're setting in Heavenly
[50:51] places in Christ Jesus hallelujah
[50:55] hallelujah you may not see it you you
[50:58] may can't you probably can't comprehend
[51:00] it but the Bible don't ask you to
[51:03] understand the Bible said have
[51:06] faith believe it hallelujah oh my God is
[51:12] nothing but the
[51:14] truth hallelujah birth into eternal
[51:19] life
[51:21] someone God needed
[51:24] someone to
[51:26] abide with and throughout
[51:31] eternity with
[51:34] him
[51:36] amen don't faint hold on till you
[51:40] see we we don't understand this but we
[51:43] believe
[51:44] it not only do I believe it I'm
[51:48] receiving
[51:48] this Hallelujah so when I receive it no
[51:53] matter what Satan tried to make me

[52:31] sickness or whatever it may be he'll try
[52:35] to scare you with
[52:37] death why would you be scared of death I
[52:40] don't know about you but my God and your
[52:45] God whipped the devil on his ground
[52:50] Hallelujah the Bible says when Jesus

[53:16] to Noah Hallelujah because you didn't
[53:20] realize it but when Noah was preaching
[53:23] that was me preaching through no
[53:26] Hallelujah therefore if you didn't
[53:29] believe Noah then you won't believe me

[53:39] keep feeding the word people when we
[53:42] slack I'm raising my hand when you slack

[53:51] advantage Hallelujah he he you know one
[53:54] thing about the devil

[1:04:13] journey Hallelujah I was

[1:04:29] finished though I be a man child I had
[1:04:33] to gr I had to mature I had to Sher I

[1:04:47] Hallelujah and like I've said to you
[1:04:49] many of times to most
[1:04:53] babies
[1:04:56] it is the
[1:04:58] father who is a
[1:05:01] revelation every baby that's
[1:05:03] born automatically knows their
[1:05:08] mama but it takes a
[1:05:11] revelation for that child to know the
[1:05:15] father cuz sometime those baby don't
[1:05:17] even like
[1:05:19] Daddy at the
[1:05:21] first but as they learn
[1:05:24] that this is the
[1:05:26] guy that's
[1:05:28] responsible for you being here then a
[1:05:31] love for the father comes y'all hear
[1:05:33] what I'm saying so we come to this place
[1:05:37] you might been you may have been birthed
[1:05:40] by way of a
[1:05:41] church Hallelujah an eagle under a
[1:05:44] chicken egg or eag under a eagle
[1:05:49] egg but it doesn't stop there you got to
[1:05:52] come to know the father
[1:05:55] Hallelujah and Jesus says when you see
[1:05:59] me you see the
[1:06:01] father I'm so glad I know who I
[1:06:05] am let's move on
[1:06:08] Hallelujah acts 1
[1:06:13] and8 because we've got to come to a
[1:06:15] place where we put away child this
[1:06:20] things that's the
[1:06:22] word when that which is perfect has come
[1:06:26] the head stone has come the revelation
[1:06:29] of the the the pure word has come the
[1:06:32] perfect word has come so you put away
[1:06:34] childish
[1:06:36] things your aim is to bring come into
[1:06:40] Perfection we played with the toys we
[1:06:43] played with all of the good things all
[1:06:45] of those things were good Hallelujah but
[1:06:48] we we need to
[1:06:51] focus on
[1:06:53] perfection you understand me and God is
[1:06:56] the only one that can bring us to
[1:06:58] Perfection no man can add one cubid to a
[1:07:03] statue it's not him that willth no he
[1:07:06] that run it but it's God who shows Mercy
[1:07:09] he is the only one that could add a
[1:07:12] cubid to our statue so if you want the
[1:07:15] statue of a perfect man if you want the
[1:07:18] divine nature of
[1:07:20] God I tell you how brother Bram said it
[1:07:22] in short
[1:07:24] humble
[1:07:27] yourself let go and let
[1:07:32] God
[1:07:35] humility he said you can come right into
[1:07:37] the face of
[1:07:39] God and it won't do do you no
[1:07:42] good sometime the presence of God can
[1:07:46] hinder you more so than bless
[1:07:49] you because if you don't recognize it's
[1:07:51] the presence of
[1:07:52] God
[1:07:54] you'll leave out worse than you
[1:07:57] came Hallelujah you understand me look
[1:08:00] at the Rich Young Ruler he came into the
[1:08:03] presence of God but he he didn't take
[1:08:06] advantage of the
[1:08:07] presence Hallelujah the presence
[1:08:09] whenever God comes into your presence
[1:08:12] he's always offering you
[1:08:15] something he's bringing
[1:08:17] gifts he's bringing something to you and
[1:08:20] it's up to you to receive
[1:08:22] it but if you come to church and you
[1:08:26] leave out here not receiving
[1:08:29] anything find yourself
[1:08:32] worse because when God comes he comes to
[1:08:36] see to your
[1:08:38] need he comes to see to your
[1:08:41] need Hallelujah we was talking I think
[1:08:44] this with a brother how God can preach
[1:08:47] one message and feed
[1:08:51] everybody now that's that's super
[1:08:54] natural
[1:08:54] itself but let's move on acts 1
[1:08:57] and8 you shall receive power after that
[1:09:01] the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye
[1:09:04] shall be Witnesses unto me both in
