another speaker uh by way of sound audio uh this brother uh i've known him for years uh recently he went on to be with the lord his name is stephen francis uh his son sent me this tape of him today i don't think he knew i was preaching on prayer but the message that it was so good i thought to myself there's no way that i could recapture this the way he is bringing it forth and it's just it's so good until i ask uh liz to um play this tape for me and if you would excuse me today i believe you'll be blessed uh by the service for those who are listening and and everything i trust the name itself don't bother you i trust that you will listen to what god is saying through the brother and by doing so i believe that you will really really really be blessed because it helped me a great deal and i know that without doing what is being spoken on this particular tape we won't be able to go forward i believe that prayer is the key of going forward into the things that god has prepared for us and everybody in here knows that prayer doesn't come easy and i'm not going to say too much because i don't want to say anything that's going to take away from what god i believe it's god so if you let's just have a word of prayer our gracious father you know i've never done this before you know i was prepared i prepared to preach tonight but i feel like there's a this gift of what god has done and i i don't know i was just by chance going and looking i could have listened to something else but i thought to listen to this and it was such a blessing to me i feel like it would be a blessing to the church i want to pray for our precious brother's son and his family and all of them that perhaps have heard this before but for me it was my first time and i pray lord god that you bless the service even those of us who are not here tonight but you're listening by way of the youtube please stay and listen to what is being said i believe it will encourage you it will give enlighten you it's not difficult to understand but it's it's so real until i i know that uh this plays an important key to our going forward uh as a as believers lord bless the service in a special way in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen amen we are grateful to the lord tonight that we could be once again in the house of the lord just to make our requests known amen we have a few prayer requests

and also for estelle that's traveling back from hilton pray that god will be with her and also brother jonathan would like to thank the lord for caleb's operation which was successful and is

bring these requests before your throne i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ when you meet these requests these needs we pray or we just want to thank you tonight oh god for we believe you've already answered our prayers but i pray that you'd help us to believe oh god as our brother prayed in the beginning oh god that we should wholeheartedly believe your god i pray father may that be real in our lives may your word oh god just be our strength all the days of our lives forgive us we pray of our unbelief we pray god may you come among us once again and give us strength as we draw from thy word for we humbly pray and ask these mercies in jesus name amen amen you're going to go to the book of acts chapter 12. we can read from verses 1 to 17 acts 12 verses 1 to 17. and our title tonight is believe when you pray acts 12 1-17 now above that time herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church and he killed james the brother of john with the sword and because he saw it pleased the jews he proceeded further to take peter also than were the days of unleavened bread and when he had apprehended him he put him in prison and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers that 16 of them to keep him intending after easter to bring him forth to the people peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto god for him and when herod would have brought him forth the same night peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and the keepers before the door kept the prison and behold the angel of the lord came upon him and a light shined in the prison and he smote peter on the side and raised him up saying arise up quickly and his chains fell off from his hands and the angel said unto him gird thyself and bind on thy sandals and so he did and he saith unto him cast thy garment about thee and follow me and he went out and followed him and was not that it was true which was done by the angel but thought he saw a vision when they were past the first and second ward they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city which opened to them of his own accord and they went out and passed on through one street and fortworth the angel departed from him and when peter was come to himself he said now i know of a surety that the lord had sent his angel and had delivered me out of the hand of herod and from all the expectation of the people of the jews when he had considered the thing he came to the house of mary the mother of john whose surname was mark where many gathered together praying and as peter knocked at the door of the gate a damsel came to hearken named rhoda excuse me and when she knew peter's voice she opened not the gate for gladness but ran in and told how peter stood before the gate and they said unto her thou art mad but she constantly affirmed that it was even so then said they it is his angel but peter continued knocking and when they had opened the door and saw him they were astonished but he beckoning unto them with a hand to hold their peace declared unto them how the lord had brought him out of the prison and he said go show these things unto james and to the brethren and he departed and went into another place you may be seated so tonight just for a little while we're going to speak on believe when you pray and we know that constantly these things are being spoken and read in the bible and we see the examples but tonight we want to pick on this particular example where you have to believe when you pray and like i said many times prayers become so common that it becomes just a habit sometimes just to satisfy our conscience and maybe just when we go to work in the morning we just try and say a little prayer and when we come back from work sometimes we tie it before we go to bed we say another little prayer so it has just become sometimes just a habit like i said just to satisfy our conscience that we are praying because the bible said we should pray or because brother branham said if you want to get close to god pray and read your bible but prayer has to be sincere secondly it's got to be intense and above all prayer must come from your heart and not from your lips when prayer comes from the heart it means the holy ghost is helping you when prayer comes from your lips it means you are just doing it on your own so even though we might be sincere even though we could even be intense and even though we may even pray from the heart we must believe when we pray because that is what brings prayers to pass now like i said you know sometimes we go through the motions like even the motions of christianity we just come to church and do whatever we have to do and go back and then we get very satisfied we've done our duty for the day and i want to just say that coming to church is not a duty for the day you come because there's an intense desire in your heart to come and worship god that's why we come to the house of the lord so and that's how it has to be with our prayer life it's got to be really sincere it's got to be intense you got to pray from your heart amen like our brother prayed and said wholeheartedly you got to just completely surrender to god and be caught up in this atmosphere the spiritual atmosphere where you actually find that you actually lost in your thoughts you are lost in prayer you are not aware of the time and and you just pray and pray and you know and and you know that when you've risen up from your knees or whatever posture you've occupied in your prayer you know that you've made contact with the almighty god and that's what prayer should be like and that's what we should be doing when we pray now jesus said in mark 11 24 remember he said have faith in god and he said if you say to this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the sea it shall be done and so on but in the 24th verse he said what things soever you desire when you praise it believe when you pray and believe that you receive them and ye shall have them but let me say this also that even some with the holy ghost at times they pray and don't even believe their prayers i'll prove it to you from the word of the lord in just a little while that even though we might be baptized with the holy ghost sometimes we don't even believe what we pray now in the message believing god brother abraham says when a divine promise is made watch this now when a divine promise is made god is solely under oath and obligation to take care of any of his promises then he said god is worth no more than what his word is worth is that if that word is not effective then god is not effective he said that is god and is it an i'm worth no more than my word and you are worth no more than your word so which means when you speak something make sure you do it if you promise something make sure you keep that promise amen because you are no more than your promise because if you make a promise that you cannot keep you cannot be trusted nobody is going to believe you anymore and if god makes a promise and he doesn't keep his promise then who is going to believe god so notice brother branham said god is under oath solely under oath an obligation to take care of any of his promises and i want to say this that god always keeps his promises amen and god made promises but yet he said we must ask it's not just like god said okay i'm the lord that healed thy diseases so whenever you sick it's just going to heal you he said you must ask and then when we ask he said we must believe so you see it's a kind of a little process he made a promise but you've got to ask him and when you ask him you got to believe and when you believe then god is solely under obligation to make that prayer effective and make that promise come to pass you believe that tonight amen that's god's promises and he never ever fails in his promises now he says in paragraph 83 he said and then this is god his word and when that word anchors down in the heart i said oh if i could just get you to see it is it when that word anchors there it'll produce just what it said so in other words it's not just you reading the bible it's not just you reading the promises not just you're coming and hearing what the word of the lord has to say somebody preaching it to you but you've got to let it anchor in your heart and brother branham said when that word anchors there it will produce just what it said amen is it but until you can anchor that and say yes lord that's for me then something is going to happen it has to is it until that is just a written word that's right but when it's once anchored so notice now if that word is not anchored in your soul it's just a written word like he said any man can turn the pages of this bible and read it but when that word anchors in your soul it until it anchors in your soul it remains just a written word but when it anchors them then ask what you will then the written word becomes manifested when it is spoken so it doesn't matter how long you pray you just have to believe from your heart in other words the length of your prayers is not going to bring this promise amen it doesn't mean like if i prayed for half an hour one hour for a need or something like that and being on my knees for about an hour or so like that it doesn't mean because i prayed so long god heard me it doesn't mean because i prayed so long then certainly the answer is going to come amen it's got nothing to do with the length of our prayers but it's got to do with whether you believe your prayer you can pray for five minutes and believe what you pray and when you believe what you pray then god is surely going to bring you to pass and in paragraph 107 branham says he says so that's the reason that the prayer of faith shall save the sick an individual's prayer and he quotes a scripture the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much he said oh if you only knew that in your hand christ gave us the authority with his name by being christians is it the most powerful weapon the world has ever known prayer it even changes everything you said it will even change the mind of god he said well he did do it after death was pronounced to a man he prayed and god told the prophet go back and tell him i heard him right remember king hezekiah when god's in isaiah the prophet and told him sit down house in order for this day you shall die and not live and then the man now that was what god said you're going to die tonight you're going to die set everything in order but then before as isaiah left the palace the man began to pray and he said lord i i've been up i've been upright and perfect which he was the bible said there wasn't a king like hezekiah and judah a great king a godly man and when isaiah was still in the culture out of the palace the word of the lord came to me said go back and tell him i've seen his tears he once more time tell him okay i'll give him more time another 15 years so now brother branham is using this to show how prayers can change things prayer can change any situation amen and as we see here from the scripture it even changed god's mind at one time and if we can believe when we pray then i do believe that god can do the same for us also amen just pray with all your heart just believe when you pray and whatever you ask for and if you really believe in your soul then i believe that god is going to give it to you amen now you see the problem is many times we i'll bring that in just a little while you see sometimes we limit god that's the big problem because of our human nature and character now watch what he says here and if god he said if you are an offspring of him and god is in you he will believe his own word though it can't be seen felt taste or anything you will believe it see you see what i mean for god in you will believe his own word he said is that right then you don't look at things you see you look at things that god said in other words circumstances and symptoms are not going to deter you because god is living inside of you then god is going to believe his own word that's if you let god speak it from you amen you see sometimes we just speak it ourselves but let god speak just one time and you will see it's going to come to pass notice god in you believes his own word watch what brother braham said don't look at things you see it sounds a little incorrect don't look at things you see look at things that god said amen what he means is don't worry about the circumstances don't worry about the problem don't even consider the symptoms amen just take god at his word believe what he has said and let god pray for you from inside god will use your vocal cords amen did not the bible said that the holy ghost himself shall make utterance for you the holy ghost himself shall make intercession for you with groanings that cannot be uttered didn't jesus say one time when you come to a situation he said don't even think about what you say he said for the holy ghost himself shall speak for you but it's going to be your voice it's going to be your body amen and but the whole now sometimes you say things and and when you see the situation eases up and then you see the problem being solved and you say my i didn't know how i said that i didn't even know why i said that i didn't even think about it you know why because it wasn't you it was god just using your faculties amen and when god speaks then something's got to happen when god speaks and situations have to change demons will have to flee sicknesses will disappear amen let god just speak from you and then you got to believe what you pray but you see that's the problem with us it's because we look at things we see and you know why because we believe some things are too hard and that's why when we pray we don't even believe it's going to happen so we decide within ourselves what is possible and what is impossible you understand what i'm saying like sometimes there's a situation and it really looks impossible for any human being and it looks really impossible for anything natural to do it but what did jesus say all things are possible to them who believe watch to them who believe in other words you've got to believe what you pray it doesn't matter how hard it is it doesn't matter what a big problem it might be and and you may think well you know what i just got to go through this on my own there's no way i'm going to get out of this well if you're going to think like that is true you won't get out of it didn't god one time ask is anything too hard for me amen and so one time elohim came down to abraham in genesis chapter 18 amen and then you see when he came down and remember now sarah which brother branham said a woman in the bible types of church was asked at that time to believe something that never happened before and therefore in her heart she felt it was impossible because she was looking at things she saw she looked at her body she looked at people around her and she looked at medical science and in the light of all those so-called facts and they were facts it was impossible not virtually but it was completely impossible for her to have a child everything was against her she was past menopause past menopause means he was past being able to bear amen and the bible says so that her body now being dead the bible said her body was dead and now she was asked to believe something that never ever happened before never before did god ever make an old person young and never before did he ever change the atoms in anybody it never happened before and now we was asking sarah to believe that amen so she went with that promise for a number of years with her husband and when she began to see that a body was not going to be able to take the strain then she brought a hager and then as time went on and she believed that now it was really impossible so when it was actually impossible then god came down now when it was beyond medical science it was beyond a man's intellectual uh feelings or you know his his thoughts that's when god came down and i really like that one time when this brother and his wife went to the hospital and their child was dying the daughter was dying they had the oxygen tent and everything out there and and the heart was going on and and then brother branham came out there and wanted to pray and they said no you can't go in there because you're going to catch the infection and things like that so brother branham said to the doctor well you know if a catholic priest came out here wouldn't you let them do the last right he said yeah we'll have to because the catholic priest they said well can't i go and give my last rights too can't i just go and pray amen then eventually they agreed and brother branham went then he began to pray and he said thus saith the lord she is healed and then the man and his wife they were just rejoicing and and and praising god and the nurse came and the nurse said what's the problem why are people behaving like this don't you see you're going to affect the sick child and then they said no but our child is healed and then she said that's not true according to medical science according to the doctor that it's impossible and the man said to her he said nurse sister whatever it was we appreciate you and we know that you are looking at medical signs is it but we are looking at a promise that god made at the same time the child was healed why because the impossible becomes possible to those who believe so here was sarah now and i want you to notice sarah was not an unbeliever and yet when god himself came down and personally confirmed the promise i mean can you imagine elohim coming down in human flesh and god speaking out of his own mouth and saying according to the time of life thy wife sarah shall conceive and bring forth the child even though god spoke it personally previously she had it from a husband when abraham said god told me this god told me that and so on she was yelling from a husband amen and now it came to a point where she was too old and she decided no that's it but now almighty god came in person and she still laughed in unbelief and yet she was not an unbeliever you see is the church with the promise of god if god makes a promise don't worry how long is going to take he's going to keep his promise but all you've got to do is just believe when he speaks now you know you can have a little bit of sympathy for sarah because you know that thing had never happened before so she was actually asked by god to believe something that never ever happened but in the new testament the angel comes down to zechariah and elizabeth and tells them that elizabeth is going to bring forth the son and you and he even gave the name john but they never believed but these people should have believed because they know from the scriptures that happened once before they could look back at abraham and sarah and see what has happened and now they were supposed to believe that so even though this happened before they still could not believe it now brother and sister even though faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god yet we have to see before we believe we like to see whereas we should be taking god at his word and believe that his promises are true amen we have to believe from the heart when we pray in the message belief from the heart prophet says this it's impossible well let me just read from there is that after 25 years of ministry for the lord are you hearing me after 25 years of ministry for the lord in his work and in his word and after this being coming in my 12th year of international evangelism and by the grace of god meeting tens of thousands of people and seeing our lord in our campaigns win now as i have seen to him right in towards 2 million people or a million 500 000 somewhere along in there in the meetings i was talking about how many people got saved in those meetings is after all these things i've come to this conclusion and after all of our efforts and so forth is that it's impossible now watch the conclusion it comes to it's impossible for god to do anything for the people until the people first get settled on whether it's truth or not in other words you've got to believe you've got to know it's truth all right he said to get now you see to get settled now brother bran says it's impossible for god to do it he said you got to get settled to get settled means you have to believe is the truth in order for your prayers to be answered now getting to our text here tonight the new testament church was blazing the trail because the holy ghost came down in the second chapter of the book of acts in the dear pentecost and a mighty power came into the church people were getting saved in the thousands the sick were being healed the dead were raised the cripples walked but there was also severe persecution you see because when god moves satan moves now why did satan bring persecution because he wanted to stop the church but the more i persecuted them the more the church grew and that should be the testimony of even individuals the more satan buffets you the closer you get to god the reason why he buffets you is because he doesn't want you to believe god amen but the more trials he brings the closer you get to god amen so the persecution of the church caused them to grow even more when they were chased from one place to another wherever they went they testified they preached the word and wherever they preached there were people believing amen like i told you one sunday before there is a message that god will send there have to be people there to receive the message otherwise he won't send a message there's no people so in the midst of this great revival in the new testament church king herod was being threatened he felt threatened by this great move of god so what did he do the bible said he killed james the brother of johnny killed him with a sword and when he did the bible says in verse 3 he saw that it pleased the jews and so because it pleased the jews he went ahead and took peter as a prisoner too and he was going to do the very same thing because an easter egg was going to present peter to the jews and of course what you think the jews would have said kill him so peter was in death row amen judgment was already passed arrested but i want you to notice also the bible says in verse number five prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto god for him so the church was praying for peter without ceasing means nonstop they were just praying now that doesn't mean there were 24 hours on the knees so praying without ceasing means i have your mind always on the things of god so here were the believers praying for their brother and i want you to notice the bible says that herod brother quaternion which is four quarters means four times four there's 16 people to god one man who never even had a weapon in his head because he wanted to make sure that this guy's not going to escape he was all out on easter easter morning to present him to the to the jews and he was waiting for the jews to say kill him also like you killed james he was going to take his head off too and besides those who guarded the prison the bible says there were two of those soldiers who slept on either side of peter and he was chained making it impossible for him to escape amen but from verses 7 to 11 the bible says the angel of the lord came upon him and a light shined in the prison even though the light shone everybody was fast asleep including peter and he smote peter on the side and he said rise up amen and as peter rose up the chains fell came off his hands and the angel told him get dressed god thyself put your garment over you and let's go well of course peter didn't believe that this was physical he thought he was in a vision so here the supernatural comes to release peter from this prison and notice verse 9 he went out and followed him and was not that it was true which was done by the angel but thought he saw a vision notice when they were past the first and second ward they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city which opened to them of his own accord and i'm sure the man who had invented automatic doors when you go to the bank and go to other shopping centers as you step in there the doors open he must have thought my this is wonderful but god did that 2000 years ago in the book of acts when the gauges opened automatically peter and the angel just walked with the gauges opened so god had done that before our modern scientists even invented those things amen you see because nothing is impossible for god so notice and they pass on through one street and fought with the angels departed from him in other words the angel went with him up to a certain distance all right now you're free just go ahead now what i want you to see is the church was praying for peter and year god came supernaturally and he came and he delivered peter from the prison so in verse 12 the bible says when he had considered the thing he came to the house of mary the mother of john whose surname was mark where many were gathered together praying the prayer meeting was still on so peter went to the house and when he came to the gate and he knocked one girl heard him her name was rhoda she heard the voice of peter at the gate when she came out she heard the voice of peter so what did she end up opening the gate she got so excited she ran back into the house everybody was praying and said my she said peter is here and what did those holy ghost-filled prayer warriors say to this girl in verse number 15 and they said unto her thou art mad now they prayed for peter to get released but they couldn't even believe their own prayers they said you man what's wrong with you you're beside yourself but yet they were praying so what i'm telling you brother and sister sometimes holy ghost-filled christians can pray prayers but because it doesn't come from the depth of your soul you just begin to pray but sometimes you don't even believe your own prayers because you look at certain things you say my this is not even possible can't happen as it is james got killed the other day so peter is going to go but we pray anyhow so they prayed but they were expecting news that peter is dead amen brother and sister believe when you pray believe with all of your heart don't you ever think that anything is impossible for god it doesn't matter what the situation might be just believe when you pray and when you ask now when you bring your requests and we read out those requests and you write it out and tell the brothers could you just put this request down and when the request is being read you better believe what you're asking for and when you believe that we're going to see the testimony next week thank god for answer to prayer maybe not next week maybe next year too but whenever it is god is going to answer it remember last week we spoke about our prayers being a memorial going unto god now notice they sat to her initially thou art mad and he thought well okay she's mad so she'll just gonna keep quiet but the bible said but she constantly affirmed that it was evil she was like going on and on counseling nobody's here peter's voice i heard his voice he's there then said they it is his angel see they still couldn't believe he was there but yet they were praying then they said well maybe this girl is not mad after all she did see somebody but that must be just peter's angel amen and in verse 16 but peter continued knocking and when they had opened the door and saw him they were astonished why could you why astonish for what you've been praying for it what you so shocked about amen wasn't the church in prayer without ceasing for peter that god would do something for him and we're not talking about just any run-of-the-mill christian we're talking about people that were filled with the holy ghost praying this prayer and when the prayer was answered they were shocked they were astonished why must anyone be astonished when god is answering prayer amen god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham amen if we don't believe somebody else will so when you pray believe in your heart that god is going to do it brother brahm said believe from the heart he said his works cannot fail his character cannot fail and his works declare his character so he's arisen today and he's here in our midst the same yesterday today and forever and we are witnesses of his character amen notice now his works cannot fail and his character cannot fail and his works declare his character so god is here to answer your prayer god is here to meet your needs but again let us not think or even believe that god is like some little servant or an errand boy you know you just call do this for me do that for me no that's not the kind of god we serve we don't order god around the word prayer means to implore it means to beg it means to ask amen so you see how you got to put these things together how you got to see that even though god made a promise and we can read the scripture and we can say well you know the wor bible says i am the lord that healed of thy all of thy diseases or with this christ we were healed past tense but yet he said in his word ask and you shall receive knock and it shall be open seek and you shall find amen he makes a promise he tells you to ask and then he says in mark 11 24 when you pray believe so can you see this is just a a little illustration i'm bringing to you to show that because james was there and already killed by the sword and then peter gets arrested they actually think the same thing is going to happen to them in other words if god never saved james from death then how is he going to save peter from death amen and i was reading a quote while i was studying today in the future home brother branham was praying he said oh lord there are some he said in his prayer he says sama headed he said the sick people there's someone headed he said to a premature death he said but heal them so that they could go in the allotted time so which means god has already allotted a time for you and we don't have to die no premature death amen so here they were thinking well james got killed so peter is going to get killed too but it wasn't peter's time yet peter was going to die but it wasn't this time so they prayed and when they prayed now sometimes we see a situation we think well you know this person had cancer and this person died so this other one got cancer same thing is going to happen too it doesn't work like that amen when god is allotted the time he closes the book but until then the book is still open amen so notice here was the church in prayer and here is this church tonight we when we pray can we believe with all of our hearts when we pray that god is going to give us because we are not praying from our lips it's not you and i praying but that is it is god that is within us crying out and when god speaks that word he believes his word and let me say this i do believe with all of my heart that those that church which was praying there i believe because they were baptized with the holy ghost they were praying from their heart and god heard that prayer but the only thing is when it happened they got a shock they thought it couldn't happen amen so what things so ever you desire when you pray believe when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them that's what jesus says not maybe not perhaps believe that you receive them and you shall have them so here we are tonight believers of the word filled with the holy ghost believing in all the promises of the almighty god seeing that word become flesh and now the flesh is becoming word seeing all the great promises that god made for this end time and seeing the way in which the word is continually unfolding to our hearts amen i believe that we should be the greatest believers in the earth today and i do believe we are amen in the face of all the evidence of all that god has done how can we not believe amen so tonight and even those who have put in a request here whatever the request might be i want you to believe when you pray tonight believe from your heart believe that it's going to happen amen and when you believe i believe you are going to receive it because it's not you it's god inside of you but of course sometimes we pray for some things we shouldn't be praying for you see sometimes we ask amiss and that's why we don't get it sometimes we pray for what we want and not for what we need and god gives you what you need not what you want amen so according to your needs god is going to let it come to pass let us stand together so here we see tonight the new testament church believers filled with the holy ghost wonderful believers clean lives in the midst of all the great miracles that were happening around them i believe they prayed absolutely sincerely i believe the prayer was intense because the word of the lord says they prayed without ceasing and calling out to god on behalf of their brother that was in prison when it happened they couldn't believe the reason why they were astonished the reason why they accused rhoda of being mad the reason why they said probably it's his angel is because even though they prayed so intensely so passionately but yet they looked at the circumstances and they thought within themselves because james was killed surely peter's going to die also they were expecting a funeral message but god wasn't about to give them no funeral message because the devil cannot take anybody until god is finished with him god will not call you home until he knows it's time to close the book until the time when you pray believe with all of your heart and believe that you will receive it and you shall [Applause] have what you ask for you believe with all of your heart tonight so we're going to pray tonight and when we pray together as a church i want you to lift up your voice cry out to god for the needs of your brothers and sisters the requests that came forth not only that but pray for one another maybe there is no request but
