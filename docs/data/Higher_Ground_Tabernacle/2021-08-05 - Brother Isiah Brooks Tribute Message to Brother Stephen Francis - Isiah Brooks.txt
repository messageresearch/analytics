========================================
god bless you we thank god for his amazing grace we want to give our tribute and our honor to our precious brother stephen francis and his lovely wife sister jenny and family we just thank god for you we we we really can't express ourselves uh enough to say how much we love you and have always loved you we met you so many years ago i think it was in the 90s when we came to your place and you treated us like family brother steve was such a kindred spirit and i just know by god's grace that i came to love him with an eternal love truly going to miss him i just know that many times that i did come to south africa my goal was to visit there and just at times times did not allow it to happen but i can remember see also meeting uh brother steve i believe it was the first time at brother isaac norriega church there in tucson arizona and i got to meet brother alistair as well there and we became family it was just uh something that automatically happened we thank god for uh you brother allison as well uh for being such an example and a reflection of brother steve's character and the character of jesus christ um we love you we've had numerous times of fellowship and especially around the word brother steve was a very intra instrumental in helping me to learn how to study this message and so i thank god for him will always remember him i was very saddened about his leaving because it was my earnest desire to see him again i have been planning to come to south africa and uh as soon as possible so hey the plan still is on as soon as the lord opened the door we we're coming but we just want to say thank you once again thank you for being a part of our lives and i thank god for the true example that our brother steve left and um i saw him live not through only through himself but i saw him live through you all as a family it was i think maybe the one of the first families i had ever seen uh that loved and respect one another so much and i know we must contribute that to the word of god in the way uh brother steve taught all of you uh so in this time of bereavement we say by the grace of god it's just a little while longer and we'll all be united we thank you for your love and your fellowship and you will always be in our hearts no know this that if there anything that we could help you with please don't be hesitant let us know god bless you love you all in jesus christ's name we thank you
