[44:52] three are gathered in his name they're
[44:56] right there in the midst of them that
[44:58] he'll be right here so he is here this
[45:01] morning he is walking up and down every
[45:04] aisle the same God that created the
[45:08] heavens and the earth this morning has
[45:10] come into the room to enjoy a time of
[45:13] fellowship with you and with me
[45:15] amen at a time what could happen at a
[45:18] time like this we have entered into the
[45:21] very promises of Jehovah amen we've
[45:24] began to rely when we begin to realize
[45:26] who we are
[45:28] amen we're not just natural being
[45:32] amen but we have been called here by a
[45:35] promise amen and when you begin to
[45:38] realize who you are in the position
[45:41] you're standing in then you don't come
[45:43] into this room I have this tradition but
[45:46] you begin to realize I am stepping into
[45:49] the promises of God amen and the sworn I
[45:53] wanted to speak on what is faith
[45:55] every person is given a measure of faith
[45:58] amen and we all have a responsibility to
[46:01] develop that faith amen when you first
[46:05] come on the road as a Christian
[46:08] the very first step you take on that
[46:11] road is by faith you have to believe on
[46:16] the Lord Jesus Christ have to believe
[46:19] that what the Bible says about him is
[46:21] true Amen that he is the son of the
[46:24] Living Almighty God that the very God
[46:28] that created the heavens and the earth
[46:30] created the heavens and the earth with
[46:33] his word and not just his word but with
[46:36] the faith behind that word to believe
[46:39] that the word that went out of his mouth
[46:41] would create everything the we're
[46:43] enjoying today amen so God created the
[46:47] heavens and the earth by faith in his
[46:49] own word amen and was a very first step
[46:53] that you take as a newborn Christian as
[46:57] a newborn believer in Christ you step
[47:01] into that same position by saying I
[47:04] believe the word that I have heard I
[47:07] believe that Jesus Christ is the son of
[47:10] the Living God
[47:11] and you're entering into becoming a son
[47:14] or a daughter of God because you're
[47:16] stepping into the very thing that God
[47:19] used to create the heavens in the earth
[47:22] amen was it God is trying to to bring
[47:26] you to give you power to become the sons
[47:29] and daughters of God amen
[47:32] a little Creator amen because you're
[47:34] stepping into the same it's the same
[47:37] nature that he has because God is a
[47:40] creator he loves to create things he
[47:43] likes to create something out of nothing
[47:45] amen amen when he takes something that
[47:48] is barren now if you could go back to
[47:50] Genesis 1:1 and Genesis 1:2 the way that
[47:54] it reads there and the King James it you
[47:57] could actually read it a little bit
[47:58] differently because it says not just
[48:00] that the world was formless and void but
[48:04] that the world became formless and void
[48:06] amen
[48:07] and so just like us we and the backing
[48:11] gods and gods thinking before the
[48:13] foundation of the world
[48:14] you were not formless and void amen
[48:19] look back before the foundation of the
[48:21] world and God's thinking you are not
[48:23] acting in doubt in God's thinking before
[48:27] the foundation of the world you were not
[48:29] bound by sin and unbelief Amen so what
[48:33] so hot so but we come here on this earth
[48:35] and we find ourselves bound by sin and
[48:38] unbelief so so just like the earth was
[48:42] bound by darkness and waters were
[48:44] covering the deep amen the light
[48:47] couldn't penetrate through that
[48:49] atmosphere and through those waters to
[48:51] get down to the dirt
[48:53] amen but God in faith spoke out and
[48:56] believed and he said let the dry land
[48:59] appear amen let there be light and light
[49:03] came in the grew dry ground rose up and
[49:06] the light hit that ground and God and
[49:08] that God caused to come out of that
[49:11] ground the very things that he had in
[49:13] his mind a man so does every Christian
[49:17] when you take your first step as a
[49:18] Christian you step out in faith you say
[49:21] I believe that Jesus Christ is the son
[49:27] of the Living God amen and I submit my
[49:30] life to him you are taking the first
[49:32] step amen of the pyramid there as you're
[49:35] getting that very first foundation there
[49:38] of faith you are becoming a little
[49:40] creator
[49:41] amen amen what is it that let there be
[49:44] light in your life
[49:45] the draught you who are once formless
[49:48] and void now the dry ground is a period
[49:52] Amen what is it now the fruits of the
[49:54] gospel are ready to start springing up
[49:56] in your life why because the
[49:59] you and him are into fellowship amen he
[50:02] is giving you power to become sons and
[50:04] daughters of God amen your beginning
[50:06] power to become the son or daughter God
[50:08] why through faith you are creating a
[50:11] world and living in Amen by faith a
[50:17] world is being created in your own life
[50:20] that's what happens what a man first
[50:23] becomes a Christian that faith is
[50:26] setting into action a chain of events
[50:28] and that chain of events will go from
[50:31] glory to glory into glory amen and that
[50:35] chain of events will keep going out
[50:36] through all of your Christian life so
[50:38] when you first become a Christian how do
[50:40] you become a Christian you first have to
[50:42] recognize that Jesus Christ is what he
[50:44] says he was he is the son of God and
[50:47] when have faith rises up and you say I
[50:49] believe that Jesus is the Son of the
[50:51] Living God that starts that faith right
[50:54] reaction amen
[50:56] now when that faith starts moving on
[50:59] down through your life that now God has
[51:02] something in his mind from before the
[51:05] foundation of the world there was a
[51:07] picture of how you're supposed to be
[51:09] amen and let me tell you what all of
[51:12] heaven and earth is behind you to make
[51:15] sure you fulfill exactly what that
[51:18] picture was Amen God has a picture of
[51:22] what you are supposed to be from before
[51:25] the foundation of the world because you
[51:27] weren't supposed to be without form you
[51:29] weren't supposed to be without void you
[51:31] weren't supposed to be living in
[51:32] darkness Amen you were supposed to be
[51:34] living in doubt you weren't supposed to
[51:37] be living in unbelief you were supposed
[51:39] to be living in your sins
[51:40] amen so what God has a picture of you
[51:43] from before the foundation of the world
[51:45] amen and and and what is it and when and
[51:49] wouldn't that little personally thing
[51:51] strikes you and you begin to realize and
[51:53] you catch the revelation of what that
[51:55] picture is God sets a chain of actions
[51:58] and events now it's not going to be an
[52:01] easy path amen there's going to be a lot
[52:05] of trials along the way amen every son
[52:08] that comes to become like a little
[52:11] creator
[52:12] every son and daughter of God that comes
[52:15] to this earth when you become a
[52:17] Christian you're signing up to be tried
[52:20] in the trials of the enemy amen you're
[52:23] signing up to be to be tested you will
[52:26] be shot it you will be confused at times
[52:30] Amen you'll be you have all kinds of
[52:33] trials and deep fiery times come about
[52:36] you amen
[52:37] you'll come to times where you or Satan
[52:39] will try to tempt you to doubt this or
[52:41] doubt that you'll come to areas where
[52:43] you don't know where you could even take
[52:45] another step forward amen by God sill
[52:48] that picture no matter what happens in
[52:50] your natural life that picture is always
[52:53] there amen because nothing can can't can
[52:58] contradict nothing can come against the
[53:01] photo that God took of you from before
[53:03] the foundation of the earth and what God
[53:06] had it in his mind for you that you were
[53:09] predestinated for him before the
[53:11] foundation of the world the the nothing
[53:13] and nothing of Satan can can't can't
[53:17] come and get set now he can come against
[53:19] it but nothing can he cannot frustrate
[53:22] God's purpose to the point of it not
[53:24] coming to pass Amen because God's will
[53:27] will come to pass you know what Amen you
[53:30] know like I said you know the the better
[53:32] the manure are the better of the plant
[53:34] amen amen so all hell's against us
[53:38] fulfilling God's own word Amen I know we
[53:43] have lost children here today so I just
[53:44] really wanted to take kind of a just a
[53:46] real simple gospel message thing what is
[53:49] faith so just for all the children I
[53:52] just I really want you to grasp this
[53:54] this morning that how do you become a
[53:56] Christian how does someone become a
[53:59] Christian you know we grow up in church
[54:02] you think well at what point do I become
[54:04] a Christian well if God has called you
[54:07] to be his then the moment that he starts
[54:13] moving upon your heart what do you do
[54:15] you stand up you accept him you say Lord
[54:17] I believe like we read there I want to
[54:19] read that book of Acts again
[54:26] we read that there at the beginning act
[54:29] 16 here's this man he's a he's a jailer
[54:40] Paul and Silas have been thrown into
[54:42] jail there's a responsibility to us to
[54:45] make sure that Paul and Silas stayed in
[54:47] jail but God had something else in mind
[54:50] amen and so in so in this jailer began
[54:54] to realize that a supernatural angel
[54:57] what will happen Paul and Silas were in
[55:00] prison which let's read there from verse
[55:04] 25 Paul and Silas were in prison and
[55:09] Aaron if you could put this up on the
[55:10] screen and if verse 25 there says that
[55:13] as they were in prison
[55:15] it says and at midnight Paul and Silas
[55:17] prayed they sang praises unto God and
[55:21] the prisoners heard them now at this
[55:23] point Paul and Silas were already way up
[55:26] on the church way up on they're on
[55:28] they're on they're on their journey of
[55:29] faith they meant they've added to their
[55:32] faith virtue
[55:32] they've add to their virtue knowledge
[55:35] amen they've add to their knowledge
[55:36] temperance and patience and godliness
[55:38] amen they are now a living tabernacle of
[55:41] the Living God's dwelling place
[55:43] that's what Paul and Silas work but this
[55:45] jailer here amen he is not in that
[55:49] position amen he doesn't have faith yet
[55:51] he doesn't have the very bottom of that
[55:53] pyramid there amen
[55:55] so but but now watch this but Paul and
[55:58] Silas and the jailer are all made of the
[56:01] same material amen
[56:03] they're all made of the same material
[56:05] and they all have a call of God upon
[56:07] their life amen but now now what
[56:10] happened is is that one thing that faith
[56:12] does is it removes the effects of time
[56:16] okay and I'm going to get into that a
[56:18] little bit later but faith removes the
[56:20] effects of time on your life amen
[56:23] so so that time is not you're not bound
[56:26] by time amen
[56:28] so we're getting to a little bit later
[56:30] but so Paul and Silas and the jailer
[56:32] what they all have been before the
[56:34] foundation of the world called by God
[56:36] God has a picture of them before the
[56:38] foundation of the world
[56:39] of what they're supposed to look like
[56:41] but the jailer doesn't look like that
[56:43] yet but Paul is Silas are already all
[56:46] the way up the road on the way to be in
[56:49] a statue of a perfect man but the jailer
[56:51] is not there amen so the jailer begins
[56:54] to look upon these temples of the Holy
[56:57] Ghost Paul and Silas were temples of the
[57:01] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost was in them
[57:04] and they've been thrown in jail but yet
[57:06] the Holy Spirit was on the inside of
[57:09] them and couldn't be taken out of them
[57:11] amen so that the same Jesus that they
[57:13] believed in had now entered down inside
[57:16] of them amen these men were Christians
[57:20] amen Christ was living on the inside of
[57:24] them so Impala and Silas were thrown
[57:26] into jail even though they were in jail
[57:29] that Christ could not be taken out of
[57:31] them and so they're in jail and they're
[57:33] singing praises unto God they're
[57:35] worshiping God no matter how many times
[57:38] they've even beaten no matter if their
[57:40] arm was broken no matter how much they
[57:43] are bleeding
[57:44] they had stripes upon their back they've
[57:46] been whipped but for all the pain and
[57:48] the abuse the the Holy Spirit down the
[57:51] inside was quickening them because Jesus
[57:53] Christ was living down on the inside of
[57:55] their lives amen and now now that's
[57:58] because they had accepted Christ and had
[58:01] followed his footsteps the jailer was
[58:03] getting ready to become a Christian I
[58:05] hadn't accepted Christ yet but God
[58:07] conserves them all the same the only
[58:10] difference is time they meant amen Paul
[58:15] had not become a Christian yet but in
[58:17] God's mind he always was a Christian
[58:19] amen was that what was lacking then just
[58:23] the faith amen our God had faith but God
[58:28] needed the jailer to have faith well
[58:32] what caused this faith to rise up in the
[58:35] jailer by seeing the attributes of the
[58:39] Living God down on side somebody else a
[58:42] man so let's read about this somebody
[58:44] else here verse 25 and at midnight Paul
[58:47] and Silas prayed and sang praises unto
[58:51] God and the prisoners her
[58:53] them and suddenly there was a great
[58:55] earthquake so that the foundations of
[58:57] the prison were shaken and immediately
[58:59] all the doors were opened and everyone's
[59:02] bands were loose and the keeper of the
[59:04] prisoner wakened out of his sleep and
[59:06] seeing the prison doors open he drew out
[59:09] his sword and would have killed himself
[59:12] supposing that the prisoners had been
[59:14] fled but Paul cried out with a loud
[59:16] voice saying do thyself no harm for we
[59:19] are all here so then what happens the
[59:23] jailer he calls for a light he sprang in
[59:27] and he came trembling he fell down
[59:29] before Paul and Silas and brought them
[59:32] out and they said look this what look
[59:35] what happen he said sirs what must I do
[59:37] to be saved
[59:43] had it ever happened in the history of
[59:47] the world that a prison keeper asked his
[59:52] own prisoners to save him now it should
[59:59] be the other way around that the
[1:00:01] prisoners are asking the jailer save us
[1:00:03] deliver us out of this place
[1:00:05] but the thing of it was is that Paul and
[1:00:07] Silas they were actually free and this
[1:00:11] prisoner than the jailer here the prison
[1:00:13] keeper he was the one that was bound he
[1:00:16] was the one that was in prison amen and
[1:00:18] what but what happened a faith something
[1:00:21] sprang up down on the inside that was
[1:00:24] pre destiny before the foundation of the
[1:00:26] world was on the inside this jailer and
[1:00:28] by seeing the the attributes of the Paul
[1:00:32] and Silas of Jesus Christ on this side
[1:00:35] it drew up a faith within him there's a
[1:00:38] possibility there's a chance that I
[1:00:41] could be saved that I could have the
[1:00:43] same thing that these men have a man saw
[1:00:47] what Paul Silas do they said the jailer
[1:00:52] said in verse 30 and brought them out
[1:00:54] and said sirs what must I do to be saved
[1:00:57] and and they Paul Silas said believe on
[1:01:00] the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
[1:01:03] saved and thy house a member sir three
[1:01:06] and he took
[1:01:07] the same hour of the night and washed
[1:01:09] their stripes he was baptized he and all
[1:01:12] of his straightaway amen that man became
[1:01:16] safe amen
[1:01:19] now the jailer is experiencing faith
[1:01:22] amen the very power that God used to
[1:01:26] create the heavens and the earth has now
[1:01:28] entered into the heart of the jailer and
[1:01:30] now he is becoming a son of God amen he
[1:01:34] is on his road to becoming exactly what
[1:01:36] God had in his mind before the
[1:01:38] foundation of the world amen
[1:01:41] now what could stop that process God's
[1:01:44] already called him amens like I had I
[1:01:47] had someone was really being hard on me
[1:01:50] wants about the way I believe and the
[1:01:52] doctrines that I believed in it and he
[1:01:55] didn't the man didn't believe in
[1:01:56] predestination or anything like that and
[1:02:01] and I so I asked him I said so when do
[1:02:04] you think Abraham was saved you know
[1:02:08] when was Abraham saved you know God when
[1:02:12] when when God flooded the earth within
[1:02:15] the days of Noah he needed a restoration
[1:02:19] on the earth amen God had promises he
[1:02:23] had a lot of promises that need to be
[1:02:24] fulfilled upon the earth amen and he
[1:02:27] needs someone to be an inheritor of
[1:02:29] those promises amen so God in his mind
[1:02:32] had already predestinated Abraham to be
[1:02:36] the heir of those promises amen and so
[1:02:40] Abraham here he is he he marries his
[1:02:42] cousin amen and she is barren a man and
[1:02:47] God calls him and his wife to come out
[1:02:50] of her and to go wander around in a
[1:02:53] desert place so here he is he's
[1:02:55] childless his wife is barren he's left
[1:02:58] all that he owns and he's wandering
[1:03:00] around in the desert he doesn't have
[1:03:01] very much to speak of but what but he
[1:03:04] does have because he has faith he's
[1:03:06] believed God's Word and because he's
[1:03:09] believed God's Word the very power that
[1:03:12] that created the heavens and the earth
[1:03:14] he has everything a mint when you first
[1:03:19] become a Christian that and you have
[1:03:20] that
[1:03:21] faith let me tell you that is yours as a
[1:03:23] possession and that faith you know we
[1:03:25] think we think all that's down at the
[1:03:27] bottom of the pyramid no it's that is
[1:03:29] the very fabric of everything that is on
[1:03:33] that pyramid because it is all by faith
[1:03:35] you have to add every bit of it to your
[1:03:37] faith amen that's why Satan when he
[1:03:41] comes he has to he always attacks your
[1:03:43] faith first amen
[1:03:46] if I could just stop right here for a
[1:03:49] second when we last was it last time if
[1:03:54] there's last Sunday we preached on the
[1:03:58] armour of God I got suffusion six isn't
[1:04:02] it
[1:04:05] amen I just kind of want to go through
[1:04:07] that real quick the armour of God
[1:04:10] now when you become a Christian you are
[1:04:12] given armor amen
[1:04:14] armor belongs to every Christian amen
[1:04:17] will you cut why because you were given
[1:04:19] this faith because the moment you were
[1:04:21] given faith you're all sudden signing up
[1:04:24] to be attacked by the enemy amen so
[1:04:27] you're given certain things to do to put
[1:04:30] on to protect yourself from these
[1:04:33] attacks amen and so when a when you when
[1:04:36] you come to a Christian you're given
[1:04:39] there in Ephesians chapter 6 it says to
[1:04:42] put Jesus 613 says wherefore take unto
[1:04:46] you the whole armour of God that you may
[1:04:49] be able to stand in the evil day and
[1:04:51] having done all to stand amen stand
[1:04:55] therefore having your loins Girt about
[1:04:57] with the truth having on the breastplate
[1:04:59] of righteousness and your feet shod with
[1:05:02] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[1:05:04] and above all take the shield of faith
[1:05:07] wherewith you should build to quench all
[1:05:09] the fiery darts of the wicked and take
[1:05:12] the helmet of salvation and the sword of
[1:05:15] the Spirit which is the word of God amen
[1:05:18] man praying always now these the this
[1:05:21] armor Satan as soon as you sign up Don
[1:05:23] this Christian walk Satan is gonna go
[1:05:25] after your armor amen he does not take
[1:05:28] this armor from you he convinces you to
[1:05:31] lay it down
[1:05:34] amen if you ever find yourselves in
[1:05:36] trouble upon life's Christian walk upon
[1:05:40] life's journey if you favor find
[1:05:42] yourself in sin doubt or unbelief after
[1:05:45] you become a Christian it's because
[1:05:46] Satan comes to to disarm you and take
[1:05:49] the armor from you
[1:05:51] Amen so what does he do if when you're
[1:05:54] standing there he always comes up and
[1:05:57] tries first he always wants to see how
[1:05:59] you react so he always gives you
[1:06:01] something little to do right Satan
[1:06:04] always tells you gives you something
[1:06:07] small and if he sees you react to that
[1:06:12] then he knows he's got you
[1:06:14] amen if he sees you react to the little
[1:06:17] thing that he knows that he can work
[1:06:20] with you amen
[1:06:22] once Satan gets you to sin and the
[1:06:25] little things now he can get you to do
[1:06:27] the bigger things right so what does he
[1:06:30] do he first he gets comes up to you and
[1:06:32] he and he gets you to do a little thing
[1:06:34] and then he has a chain once you go the
[1:06:36] first inch he has a long chain of
[1:06:40] actions for you to take from that step
[1:06:42] on a mint
[1:06:44] once you stumble the first time he has a
[1:06:46] chain of events for there was one thing
[1:06:49] after a bigger thing after a bigger
[1:06:52] thing if you tell one lie Satan has
[1:06:55] another lie for you tell after that one
[1:06:58] if you do one thing wrong he has two or
[1:07:01] three other things wrong for you to do
[1:07:03] right after that a man and so once you
[1:07:06] start doing those wrong things now he
[1:07:09] tells you now you take off your
[1:07:11] breastplate of righteousness and you no
[1:07:14] longer have faith that you are righteous
[1:07:15] he's attacking your faith because all
[1:07:18] those things are put on by faith binds
[1:07:20] it all up amen and so one now that you
[1:07:23] are no longer can put trust in your
[1:07:26] righteousness now you have to take your
[1:07:28] shoes off because here it says your
[1:07:31] shoes your feet are shod with the
[1:07:33] preparation of the gospel of peace but
[1:07:35] you can no longer share the gospel
[1:07:37] because look what you just did he's
[1:07:42] taking he's disarming and you're the one
[1:07:44] taking it up you're the one taking it
[1:07:47] off they
[1:07:48] and so then once you do that now what
[1:07:50] you you you now you put down your shield
[1:07:53] of faith why because you've already
[1:07:55] taken off your righteousness you take
[1:07:57] off your shoes now you have to put down
[1:07:59] your shield because you can no longer
[1:08:01] blitz a shield of faith you can no
[1:08:03] longer believe how can you believe look
[1:08:06] what you just did Amen what is he doing
[1:08:09] he's disarmed and you slowly but surely
[1:08:11] amen and so then he so then you now you
[1:08:15] can no longer use the sword of the
[1:08:17] Spirit because you're so convicted how
[1:08:20] do you know that God will ever act on
[1:08:22] your behalf if you're to pick this world
[1:08:24] up
[1:08:25] amen the sword of the Spirit is the
[1:08:27] weapon that the Spirit uses is the Word
[1:08:29] of God amen but how do you how can you
[1:08:32] say that God will intervene on your
[1:08:35] behalf if you take the sword up when you
[1:08:39] look what you've done
[1:08:40] amen so so Satan is now you've now
[1:08:44] you've lost your you've lost your shield
[1:08:46] you've lost your breastplate you've lost
[1:08:48] your shoes amen you've lost your sword
[1:08:51] amen and so as he do he comes down he
[1:08:54] comes to attack your salvation and he
[1:08:56] says well maybe you're not even a
[1:08:58] Christian in the first place and that's
[1:09:00] where you take off your helmet of
[1:09:02] salvation amen because you can no longer
[1:09:04] believe that you are even safe amen but
[1:09:10] for all of that God still has this
[1:09:14] photograph back here amen that was taken
[1:09:18] before the foundation of the world and
[1:09:20] the very reason that God called you in
[1:09:23] the first place is still there amen he's
[1:09:26] just waiting for you to come back to
[1:09:29] that point because when you first leave
[1:09:31] the path you always have to come back to
[1:09:34] that very own path amen where you left
[1:09:36] it amen and you do that through
[1:09:38] repentance when you cry out to God now
[1:09:41] remember we know we cannot we cannot
[1:09:43] give ourselves repentance amen amen and
[1:09:47] you know we cannot be sorry for our sins
[1:09:49] by ourselves that's a gift
[1:09:52] amen that's a gift and we have to sow it
[1:09:56] and if you do not have that gift
[1:09:58] uf asks for it
[1:10:00] amen if you cannot find yourself to be
[1:10:03] in a position where you're sorry for
[1:10:05] your sins then you have to ask God to
[1:10:07] restore that Amen because if he never
[1:10:10] restores that you're in a bad case
[1:10:12] Amen because the only way back is to
[1:10:15] have godly sorrow for your sins
[1:10:18] Amen but if God does not know God if he
[1:10:21] has that picture of you from before the
[1:10:23] foundation of the world all of heaven is
[1:10:25] behind you to bring you back to
[1:10:27] restoration amen amen and that's what
[1:10:31] faith does and when you take that faith
[1:10:34] you say Lord I believe everything in
[1:10:37] your Christian walk is by faith
[1:10:39] everything has to be done by faith down
[1:10:42] on the inside
[1:10:43] you either have faith or unbelief it's
[1:10:46] only one or the other faith or unbelief
[1:10:49] amen and if you have faith in there then
[1:10:52] faith is what operates everything else
[1:10:54] you do this because I believe I do this
[1:10:57] because I believe I believe in the Lord
[1:11:00] Jesus Christ therefore I am safe amen
[1:11:04] amen
[1:11:07] so we believe that the God same God that
[1:11:10] calls us is the same God that has that
[1:11:13] picture of us Amen that all of heaven is
[1:11:15] behind us making sure that we attain to
[1:11:18] the adoption amen
[1:11:20] to being exactly what God had in his
[1:11:22] mind for us before the foundation of the
[1:11:24] world Amen God had in mind that we would
[1:11:28] be his son his daughter that we'd be
[1:11:31] little creators a meant that if we saw
[1:11:34] something that the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:11:36] needed amen that we could speak it speak
[1:11:38] it into existence by our own our oh man
[1:11:41] amen amen amen
[1:11:48] so Abraham when he first had when he
[1:11:51] first caught the revelation that the
[1:11:53] Almighty God the creator of the heavens
[1:11:55] and the earth was calling him he left
[1:11:59] everything behind and he started walking
[1:12:01] and God supplied all of his needs amen
[1:12:05] and he believed and he believed and he
[1:12:08] believed and he just kept believing all
[1:12:10] the days of his life amen so when God
[1:12:13] came down to him
[1:12:14] I'm going to restore my relationship of
[1:12:18] God to the people of the earth and you
[1:12:21] are going to be the father of those
[1:12:22] people
[1:12:23] he says you Abraham are gonna be the
[1:12:25] father of many nations he said your seed
[1:12:28] shall possess the gates of every in amen
[1:12:32] and you who are barren are gonna bear a
[1:12:34] son you will call his name Isaac and
[1:12:36] Isaac will possess the gates of every
[1:12:40] enemy amen and so when when he know in
[1:12:48] now when he was given that when Abraham
[1:12:50] was given the promise of that son he had
[1:12:53] to wait 25 years and yet he believed the
[1:12:57] entire time now 25 years is a long time
[1:13:02] amen it's a long time we got there
[1:13:04] something down on the inside of Abraham
[1:13:07] that no matter what it was that no
[1:13:10] matter what came upon life's journey
[1:13:12] that when God first says something that
[1:13:15] God means exactly what he says Amen and
[1:13:19] we'll bring it to pass in your life and
[1:13:21] there's a faith down inside that says I
[1:13:24] believe that what God said it's true and
[1:13:26] you'll not just that way not just for
[1:13:28] somebody else but for you Amen that's
[1:13:32] what faith does then that the promises
[1:13:34] are not just for others but faith grabs
[1:13:37] a hold of the promises and brings them
[1:13:40] to you yourself so they can operate in
[1:13:43] your life amen so that you can be a
[1:13:45] possessor of all things amen that's what
[1:13:48] the promise was to Abraham that he would
[1:13:51] be the possessor of all things on heaven
[1:13:54] and earth amen Melchizedek had it right
[1:13:57] amen Abraham met milk his neck the
[1:14:00] possessor of heaven and earth that
[1:14:03] possession of Earth there was given over
[1:14:05] to Abraham as the heir of all things
[1:14:07] amen and so and so there was a sea that
[1:14:11] came out of Abraham that was Isaac and
[1:14:14] that I Isaac was to inherit all the
[1:14:16] promises but what happened was as God
[1:14:18] told them to take Isaac up on the
[1:14:22] mountain amen and he said I want you to
[1:14:26] take your son that I promised
[1:14:28] to you I told you that you're the
[1:14:30] Isaac's sons and daughters would take
[1:14:32] over the earth and that all this land
[1:14:34] will be theirs right and that the meek
[1:14:36] shall inherit the earth
[1:14:37] amen but now I want you to take this 12
[1:14:39] year old boy Isaac and I want you to
[1:14:41] take him up upon them all altar on the
[1:14:43] pond the mountain where I will show you
[1:14:45] and I want you to kill him as a
[1:14:47] sacrifice unto me and to do and to
[1:14:51] basically destroy the very promise that
[1:14:54] he'd just given to Abraham and so
[1:14:57] Abraham so I'm gonna do exactly what God
[1:15:00] calls tells me to do so he goes up upon
[1:15:03] the all up up on the mountain and and he
[1:15:06] goes he binds sea ties Isaac up with his
[1:15:09] hands by his back he lays Isaac upon the
[1:15:12] altar and he gets the wood ready and he
[1:15:16] takes out his knife to kill Isaac before
[1:15:19] he burns him an angel comes down God
[1:15:22] comes down and says stop what are you
[1:15:26] doing
[1:15:28] Abraham I did this now I know that you
[1:15:32] have given yourself entirely over to me
[1:15:35] now I know that the faith that you have
[1:15:38] is not just an act
[1:15:41] Amen now I not just now that I know but
[1:15:45] now you know amen now not Abraham and
[1:15:48] Jehovah had come to an agreement that
[1:15:52] they both knew that Abraham had faith to
[1:15:55] believe God in all things but now things
[1:15:59] can really begin to happen now now
[1:16:03] what's now see God already believes who
[1:16:07] you are
[1:16:07] amen he's longer took the picture of you
[1:16:10] before the foundation of the world God
[1:16:12] knows what he has in mind for you but
[1:16:16] from a Ford Foundation world but he
[1:16:17] needs you to know God knows but he needs
[1:16:23] you to know and until you know you
[1:16:28] cannot see maybe even start on the
[1:16:30] journey amen but once you can come to
[1:16:34] realize who you are
[1:16:37] amen once you begin to realize who you
[1:16:40] are then that faith
[1:16:41] can rise up and realize I am a son or a
[1:16:45] daughter of God amen
[1:16:46] I am the one that the entire Earth was
[1:16:48] created for I am the one I am the reason
[1:16:52] the Bible was written I am the one that
[1:16:54] Jesus died for on the cross I am the one
[1:16:57] that he I am the one that when Jesus
[1:16:59] said that ask what serve you will he
[1:17:03] wrote that scripture just for me
[1:17:05] amen now faith is beginning to move now
[1:17:08] faith is beginning to act now faith is
[1:17:11] beginning to believe Amen because you're
[1:17:13] beginning to realize who you are so now
[1:17:16] when Abraham did that then he beasts he
[1:17:19] took Isaac he untied him sent him off
[1:17:23] and he realized that God had created a
[1:17:25] substitute and he went and he grabbed
[1:17:28] the sheep and the RAM in the bush and he
[1:17:31] put him up on the altar and he slew the
[1:17:33] lamb God had substituted Abraham's son
[1:17:37] for his own son
[1:17:40] amen amen and and and in Abraham called
[1:17:45] the called that mountain Jehovah Jireh
[1:17:48] in the mountain of God God Jehovah will
[1:17:52] see to it
[1:17:53] Amen God will provide all of my needs
[1:17:57] amen
[1:17:58] George ire means God is my provider amen
[1:18:01] but it also means that God will see to
[1:18:04] it has to do with the scene Amen that
[1:18:07] whatever it is God will see it amen
[1:18:11] Jehovah whatever God had him in his mind
[1:18:15] God will now have in his vision Amen and
[1:18:18] he will see it provided on the earth a
[1:18:21] man so God has seen you standing in
[1:18:25] priests completely all your sins wiped
[1:18:28] away goddess has thought in his mind now
[1:18:32] by your faith he is seen it God is
[1:18:34] providing an amen amen God has already
[1:18:38] seen you completely restored and healed
[1:18:41] amen God has seen you now how did
[1:18:45] Abraham and Isaac have a son in the
[1:18:47] first place remember the Bible said they
[1:18:50] were well stricken in age a meant they
[1:18:52] were ninety and a hundred years old they
[1:18:55] well stricken in age say how could they
[1:18:58] have a son Amen there was just no way
[1:19:01] you think of your great-grandparents or
[1:19:03] your grandparents how could they have a
[1:19:05] child they're old they can't have their
[1:19:07] past the age of bearing children they
[1:19:10] can't have children anymore but God
[1:19:12] because Abraham and Sarah were believing
[1:19:16] on God they say no matter what happens
[1:19:18] we believe God's Word we believe God's
[1:19:21] Word we believe God's Word and God all
[1:19:24] sudden their bodies began turning back
[1:19:29] to a young son or a young woman in
[1:19:32] madigan and Abraham and Sarah who are
[1:19:34] ninety and a hundred years old all of a
[1:19:36] sudden now they're looking more like
[1:19:39] they're 80 and I look like the 70 60 50
[1:19:44] 40 and they go all the way back to
[1:19:46] looking like they're 20 years old again
[1:19:48] amen like my brother and sister right
[1:19:51] here look like an Abraham and Sarah they
[1:19:54] meant what happened God was restoring
[1:19:57] their bike because their body had to
[1:19:59] testify of what was going on on what God
[1:20:01] was seen a man God had it in his mind
[1:20:04] now
[1:20:06] now Abraham and Sarah have it in their
[1:20:08] mind amen but now their bodies had to
[1:20:11] produce exactly what their faith was
[1:20:14] testifying amen and so is it for every
[1:20:17] single person that is sick Amen or every
[1:20:20] person that has a neat amen and when you
[1:20:23] when you when your faith grabs a hold of
[1:20:25] that then after you once you believe now
[1:20:32] faith removes time just out of the way
[1:20:34] altogether time doesn't matter Amen it's
[1:20:37] just once you believe it's got to happen
[1:20:40] it's just got to happen amen it's just
[1:20:44] like that jailer once he first believed
[1:20:46] now he might have been separated from
[1:20:48] being in the same position as Paul and
[1:20:50] Silas by time but he's going to get
[1:20:52] there
[1:20:52] a man once he believed taya was moved
[1:20:55] out of the way he meant and he was just
[1:20:57] there amen you know you say well you
[1:21:00] know well maybe he'll be baptized at
[1:21:04] this time fill with the Holy Ghost at
[1:21:06] this point and then you know
[1:21:09] seeing God act in his life at this point
[1:21:11] but once he believed God already see God
[1:21:14] already had in his mind all those things
[1:21:17] were available right then because God is
[1:21:21] eternal right God is eternal what
[1:21:25] so what prevents it it's our faith MOOC
[1:21:29] stepping guests to get up to that
[1:21:31] position God right now has promised us a
[1:21:34] rapture amen now do I have a rapture all
[1:21:39] right now my time is testifying I don't
[1:21:42] have a rapture right now a time is
[1:21:45] testifying that that there is no rapture
[1:21:48] because I don't see a rapture record but
[1:21:52] God has already testified of it and
[1:21:54] because I believe it time has been taken
[1:21:58] out of the way I have my rapture amen
[1:22:00] now you say no brother I don't see that
[1:22:02] you're a raptured but I already believe
[1:22:06] amen I are I already accepted it amen
[1:22:10] it's our I have already possessed it
[1:22:11] it's mine
[1:22:12] amen I believe in it amen you say Troyer
[1:22:16] you can be turned back to young man I
[1:22:18] have already accepted it I've already
[1:22:21] believed it my faith is already grabbed
[1:22:23] ahold of it it's mine it belongs to me
[1:22:26] now a time might say that I can't have
[1:22:28] it you know but but faith takes time out
[1:22:32] of the equation amen it's mine right now
[1:22:35] I believe it amen amen I have a need of
[1:22:40] it amen amen you know it's it's not just
[1:22:46] a rapture sounds like a neat thing to go
[1:22:49] through or a neat experience or
[1:22:51] something you can try out it's no it's
[1:22:53] something I need
[1:22:55] amen I need to get out of here amen why
[1:22:59] because I know I I need to get rid of
[1:23:01] this body of flesh Amen this body flesh
[1:23:05] causes me to stumble a man it causes me
[1:23:08] a lot of trouble it causes me to fall I
[1:23:10] gotta get rid of this thing
[1:23:11] well God's so before the foundation of
[1:23:14] the world took a picture of me and idea
[1:23:17] wasn't living in this sin born flesh
[1:23:19] amen I didn't I wasn't bound by a cynic
[1:23:22] I wasn't bound by temptations I wasn't
[1:23:25] bound by the weaknesses of this flesh
[1:23:27] the weaknesses of my mind
[1:23:29] the weaknesses of my eyes the weaknesses
[1:23:31] of my mouth I wasn't back before the
[1:23:33] foundation of the world
[1:23:34] I wasn't bound by that amen so what so
[1:23:38] what is preventing me time time is
[1:23:42] stopping me from being what I ought to
[1:23:45] be but faith takes time out of the
[1:23:49] equation moves it out of the way so
[1:23:52] right now I can be in heavenly places in
[1:23:54] Christ Jesus right now I can be an heir
[1:23:57] of all things right now the wet sweat I
[1:24:00] can be perfect a mint right now I can be
[1:24:02] healed right now I can be delivered
[1:24:04] right now I can be set free right now
[1:24:07] all the promises that God has in his
[1:24:10] great Bible are mine right now it's not
[1:24:13] tomorrow it's not yesterday he's the
[1:24:16] same today right now amen
[1:24:18] time has no bearing on it we have
[1:24:21] entered into eternity
[1:24:22] amen we are why because we've been given
[1:24:25] eternal life a man so we draw from
[1:24:28] things from eternity or living in
[1:24:30] eternity now down here this body of
[1:24:33] flesh is testifying that we're living
[1:24:35] down here in time but ultimately were
[1:24:38] not lower sitting in heavenly places we
[1:24:40] have entered into eternity everlasting
[1:24:46] life never failing eternal life we've
[1:24:50] entered into eternity amen and all the
[1:24:53] promises are ours amen and we look at it
[1:24:55] and we say well time says I can't have
[1:24:58] this
[1:24:58] why because you asked for it and it
[1:25:02] doesn't show up right away plus time
[1:25:05] that's doing that yeah but don't but and
[1:25:08] time creates doubt right but you have
[1:25:12] faith and that faith who takes time out
[1:25:16] of the equation and realizing that
[1:25:18] because a son a daughter asked for in
[1:25:21] prayer amen that's there it's already
[1:25:27] there it's yours I possess it it belongs
[1:25:30] to me I own it I am a possessor of
[1:25:32] heaven and earth
[1:25:33] a man I've been given all things amen
[1:25:36] so don't don't let time create doubt in
[1:25:39] your life we have entered into eternity
[1:25:41] amen what is faith it's believing God
[1:25:46] believing his word constantly faithfully
[1:25:50] saying I don't care what time says I
[1:25:52] don't care what the devil says I don't
[1:25:54] care what my flesh says I believe God's
[1:25:57] Word I believe God's work I believe
[1:26:00] God's Word no I don't care where time
[1:26:02] says I don't care what my flesh says I
[1:26:04] don't care what the devil says I believe
[1:26:07] God's Word Satan says that I am a sin
[1:26:10] born man Satan says that that I've done
[1:26:14] too much I've sinned too much I I can't
[1:26:17] get over this
[1:26:18] I can't need to learn from that you know
[1:26:20] Satan says all those things oh I've been
[1:26:22] delivered from the words of Satan amen
[1:26:25] I've been delivered from things that he
[1:26:27] said amen I have entered into eternity
[1:26:31] amen by faith I received that amen I
[1:26:37] believe it amen amen
[1:26:41] you say brother is that true
[1:26:43] can I really can I be like that God
[1:26:46] ordained you from before the foundation
[1:26:48] of the world to believe like that that's
[1:26:53] when you take it personally to yourself
[1:26:55] that's when you now have faith there's a
[1:27:01] lot of people out there in the world and
[1:27:02] you know in all the different churches
[1:27:04] and denominations that talk about faith
[1:27:07] oh you know he's he's a man of faith or
[1:27:11] he's a man of this but let me tell you
[1:27:13] fit faith is a lot bigger and more
[1:27:17] beautiful than most people can imagine
[1:27:18] because by faith God created the heavens
[1:27:22] and the earth and now he's called you to
[1:27:26] have the same thing that's not a
[1:27:29] different faith it's not a different
[1:27:34] faith it is the exact set in the same
[1:27:36] faith that God used to create the
[1:27:38] heavens and the earth he possessed that
[1:27:40] faith right he believed his word he
[1:27:44] owned that possession
[1:27:45] he owned faith it was his it belonged to
[1:27:48] him he knew that he
[1:27:50] use it he knew they whatever he had in
[1:27:53] his mind that he could speak out of his
[1:27:55] mouth and gods own faith caused it to
[1:27:59] happen and the earth that we stand on
[1:28:02] was created and now we come along and we
[1:28:05] become sons and daughters of God having
[1:28:08] the faith of God that Wes whoever we ask
[1:28:11] will be performed by the sacrifice of
[1:28:13] Calvary amen we've received God's own
[1:28:17] faith amen so by faith we are saved from
[1:28:20] our sins by faith we are saved from all
[1:28:24] the attributes of sin amen by faith we
[1:28:27] were saved from all the sickness which
[1:28:29] is an attribute of sin by faith were
[1:28:32] saved from doubt which is an attribute
[1:28:34] of sin Amen you know if I stumble and
[1:28:36] temptation I say Lord you said I would
[1:28:39] be saved for my sins and I stumbled and
[1:28:42] fall which is contrary to what you said
[1:28:45] lord I pray deliver me from this set me
[1:28:48] free from this event why because he said
[1:28:51] I would be delivered for my sins Amy
[1:28:54] let's turn over to John chapter fourteen
[1:29:06] amen when
[1:29:08] is up and a believer nothing can stand
[1:29:10] in his way
[1:29:11] why because he believes I believe this I
[1:29:15] claim this for the Gospels sake hey man
[1:29:17] there's gotta be something down on the
[1:29:20] inside they just grasped it it grabs a
[1:29:22] hold of it and says this is mine
[1:29:26] amen John chapter 14 read from the 13th
[1:29:32] verse and whatsoever ye shall ask in my
[1:29:37] name that will I do that the father may
[1:29:40] be glorified in the son if he shall ask
[1:29:43] anything in my name I will do it amen
[1:29:47] now is that now that's written in God's
[1:29:49] Bible is that true or false it's true
[1:29:53] a man so faith can grab ahold of that
[1:29:56] because it is truth and we know that it
[1:29:58] is true a mass go to John 15 verse 7 it
[1:30:04] says if ye abide in me and my words
[1:30:07] abide in you you shall ask what she will
[1:30:10] and it shall be done unto you
[1:30:12] a hearing is my father glorified that
[1:30:14] you bear much fruit and so she you be my
[1:30:17] disciples now is this true or false this
[1:30:21] is true amen so faith can now rise up
[1:30:25] that up from the inside of you the same
[1:30:27] faith that caused you to become a
[1:30:29] Christian the first place can now come
[1:30:31] out of your lips and say Lord I have
[1:30:33] knee to this
[1:30:34] amen amen let's turn to John chapter 16
[1:30:39] verse 23
[1:30:48] says and in that day ye shall ask me
[1:30:50] nothing verily verily I say to you
[1:30:52] whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my
[1:30:55] name he will give it you a meant
[1:30:57] hitherto have yes nothing in my name ask
[1:31:00] and ye shall receive that your joy may
[1:31:04] be full
[1:31:05] amen so God had a desire that their joy
[1:31:08] will be the full amen now what and now
[1:31:11] what makes a Christian joyful amen every
[1:31:15] single Christian in this room can
[1:31:18] testify that when they're living in
[1:31:20] communion with God there's joy
[1:31:23] unspeakable and full of glory now let me
[1:31:26] tell you for if you're not there right
[1:31:28] now what is preventing you the lack of
[1:31:32] faith you have to believe amen
[1:31:37] somehow Satan has allowed a doubt to
[1:31:40] rise up in your mind amen because all
[1:31:43] all sin comes from doubt some type of
[1:31:46] unbelief in your mind
[1:31:47] Amen something that is for something
[1:31:50] that Satan is saw slipped down there on
[1:31:53] the inside of you to cause you to
[1:31:54] disbelieve amen but it doesn't have to
[1:31:56] be that way you can repent of that and
[1:31:59] come back to faith once again amen and
[1:32:02] then what so what your joy can be full
[1:32:05] yeah every Christian knows that when you
[1:32:07] repent and you realize that God has
[1:32:10] forgiven you of your sins
[1:32:11] it brings out joy like you've never
[1:32:13] experienced before when you've been
[1:32:15] washed and made clean amen there's a joy
[1:32:18] that is given unto you that is the it's
[1:32:22] a freshness a cleanness it's like the
[1:32:24] world was just created all over again
[1:32:26] all things are possible
[1:32:28] you've been restored back to right-foot
[1:32:30] fellowship with God amen Christ and you
[1:32:33] have become one you can talk together
[1:32:36] you can walk together you can sing
[1:32:38] together Amen why because God and his
[1:32:41] child have been reunited amen why
[1:32:43] because now you believe in him again
[1:32:46] amen amen and there's nothing between
[1:32:48] your soul and your Savior amen when you
[1:32:51] truly believe amen amen so so what
[1:32:57] prevents it God or Satan has little
[1:32:59] little things he always tries to get you
[1:33:01] he's always attacking the faith amen
[1:33:05] why is he get you once he Istanbul in
[1:33:07] descent when he knows that you were
[1:33:10] saved because he wants you to prevent
[1:33:12] you from this convenient that's a
[1:33:14] perfect get this doubt and are on the
[1:33:16] inside he meant
[1:33:19] amen amen
[1:33:26] it's like when you come into communion
[1:33:30] with God and brings all a love up on the
[1:33:33] inside if you believe that your brother
[1:33:35] is just as forgiving as you are it
[1:33:39] creates a deep love for him down on the
[1:33:42] inside a man when you can believe that
[1:33:45] your brother or your sister or your
[1:33:47] husband or your wife is just forgive
[1:33:50] just as forgiving as you are what kind
[1:33:53] of church would we have a man we
[1:33:56] wouldn't be holding grudges against one
[1:33:58] another we wouldn't be holding to
[1:34:00] keeping our brother in prison for the
[1:34:03] sentence that he's done or the sins that
[1:34:05] she has done a mint why because when we
[1:34:08] have forgiveness one for another amen we
[1:34:11] have faith that the same forgiveness
[1:34:13] that God has given to us we have that
[1:34:16] same faith for somebody else that God
[1:34:19] will forgive them also amen amen amen
[1:34:34] so there is just here as we get ready to
[1:34:38] close when when Jehovah substituted
[1:34:48] Isaac for the slain lamb that's set in
[1:34:53] forth a pattern Amen so that every every
[1:34:59] person that can ever substitute their
[1:35:03] life for the life of that lamb has now
[1:35:07] become an heir of all things amen and
[1:35:10] now you stand now it's not Abraham
[1:35:13] staying here on the mountain now that's
[1:35:15] you standing on the mountain amen it's
[1:35:18] to Abraham has already stood on his
[1:35:21] nothing but now you stand on the
[1:35:23] mountain amen
[1:35:25] now you have to two to kill your own
[1:35:28] nature and kill your own self
[1:35:31] amen as you go to kill yourself off what
[1:35:34] does God do he comes down and brings the
[1:35:36] substitute and sub-sites takes your life
[1:35:39] up off the altar amen places his life in
[1:35:43] your place amen amen you lay yourself
[1:35:46] down upon the altar and what does he do
[1:35:49] and as you're dying out to yourself he
[1:35:52] comes along and takes your life off the
[1:35:54] altar and lays his life on the altar his
[1:35:58] son the righteous seat amen and Jesus
[1:36:01] Christ died in your place amen and now
[1:36:04] the royal seed of Abraham not just the
[1:36:08] natural seed which was Isaac but now the
[1:36:10] Royal Sea which was Jesus Christ he has
[1:36:13] become yours now you have stood upon the
[1:36:16] mountain in abraham's place amen and
[1:36:18] then and the Lamb of God has come and
[1:36:20] stood in your place amen and now now no
[1:36:25] it's not just Abraham that his possessor
[1:36:29] of all things
[1:36:31] now you through Jesus Christ had become
[1:36:34] the possessor of all things by the same
[1:36:37] faith to Abraham hat and you have become
[1:36:39] a son or daughter of God
[1:36:41] maybe we're standing in the same place
[1:36:44] and now the same relationship that got
[1:36:47] you believe God had a relationship with
[1:36:49] Abraham he did Amen all those years they
[1:36:53] Abraham walked on this earth he was
[1:36:55] walking with Jehovah amen and now
[1:36:59] the time has come for you to have the
[1:37:02] same relationship amen whatsoever you
[1:37:05] ask now when Abraham was walking on the
[1:37:08] earth he was given a city his whose
[1:37:12] whose builder and maker was God right he
[1:37:16] was given a city he met the mayor of
[1:37:19] that city whose was milk hesitate right
[1:37:21] as so as he was walking in that city and
[1:37:25] he said that city is around here
[1:37:27] somewhere he couldn't find it with his
[1:37:29] eyes right Abraham was looking for a
[1:37:34] city whose builder and maker was God and
[1:37:37] as he walked around the Israel he
[1:37:40] couldn't find the city with his eyes but
[1:37:44] he believed in that city Amen the the
[1:37:48] now God did show him the natural city
[1:37:51] right because the Bible says that when
[1:37:53] Jesus Christ died on the cross the great
[1:37:57] earthquake this is Matthew 27 I believe
[1:37:59] a great earthquake shook the the temple
[1:38:03] the curtain was written - amen and the
[1:38:07] graves of the earth were open and the
[1:38:10] Saints of old except up out of their
[1:38:12] graves and resurrected and walked in the
[1:38:16] city and Abraham was one of those saints
[1:38:19] and he was walking around in the same
[1:38:21] place that he'd walked 2,000 years
[1:38:24] before that but now there's a city there
[1:38:26] but God says now I have shown you this
[1:38:29] city first I showed you a barren land
[1:38:32] now I'm showing you a natural city I see
[1:38:35] you there in the time of Christ 2,000
[1:38:37] years later and then he goes up in a
[1:38:40] resurrection and he's waiting for a holy
[1:38:43] city to come down and the book of
[1:38:45] Revelation says that 2,000 years after
[1:38:47] that that guy I John I saw the holy city
[1:38:51] descending as relationships eighteen or
[1:38:54] twenty-one
[1:38:55] I joined saw the holy city descending
[1:38:58] down from God out of heaven and Abraham
[1:39:01] will see that city also Amen so the
[1:39:04] faith of Abraham walked around a barren
[1:39:07] place first couldn't see it with his
[1:39:09] eyes but he believed it was true
[1:39:11] amen
[1:39:12] and then he he died his own natural body
[1:39:16] died right
[1:39:17] it was buried it weighed their laid
[1:39:20] their in faith because time could not
[1:39:23] prevent the promise right so his body
[1:39:27] testified as his body rot away in the
[1:39:30] grave and became nothing but bones is
[1:39:33] even that corruption could not take away
[1:39:36] what the promise of his faith said his
[1:39:39] faith was greater than that corruption a
[1:39:41] man so he resurrected 2,000 years ago in
[1:39:44] the time of Jesus saw a natural city
[1:39:46] built by the hands of men but God says
[1:39:49] now you've seen this this is just a
[1:39:50] partial of it right amen and then he
[1:39:53] goes up in a resurrection and waits and
[1:39:55] now he's waits another 2,000 years and
[1:39:58] then he sees a city coming down from God
[1:40:02] out of heaven and it was built wide who
[1:40:04] Jesus Christ who was himself said do not
[1:40:08] fear I go to prepare a place for you I
[1:40:10] will come again and receive you unto
[1:40:12] myself amen now we are standing here in
[1:40:15] the same place our eyes do not see that
[1:40:17] city right our eyes do not see that city
[1:40:21] but we have received the city amen and
[1:40:24] time has been removed out of the way and
[1:40:26] we know that that city that he has gone
[1:40:29] from where for us it's already art amen
[1:40:32] it's just time that gets in the way
[1:40:35] amen but God has removed time out of the
[1:40:38] way for us amen
[1:40:40] we're entering into eternity amen amen
[1:40:46] why that's why we can draw from eternal
[1:40:49] things amen if you have need of a home
[1:40:53] draw from eternity amen why because he
[1:40:57] went to prepare a place for you if you
[1:41:00] need if you need health restored draw
[1:41:04] from eternity amen because that's you're
[1:41:08] not supposed to be living here you're
[1:41:09] supposed to be living in eternity you
[1:41:11] are born to be living in eternity
[1:41:14] anyway so you draw will turn how do you
[1:41:16] get saved from your sins how do you get
[1:41:18] watched you're drawing from eternity
[1:41:21] what drew that your faith drew it well
[1:41:25] you take
[1:41:26] same faith that drew your forgiveness
[1:41:29] from your sins to bring you back to
[1:41:32] right standing like you're in the Garden
[1:41:34] of Eden before the fall take that same
[1:41:36] faith that drew your forgiveness and
[1:41:38] draw your health amen
[1:41:42] just to take that same that same faith
[1:41:44] and draw your daily food your sustenance
[1:41:47] amen
[1:41:48] take that same faith apply it to your
[1:41:50] family draw your children amen amen
[1:41:54] if that take that same faith that you
[1:41:56] you believe that your sins are forgiven
[1:41:58] and draw a piece for your home amen all
[1:42:02] things have been given unto you amen
[1:42:05] amen having nothing and yet possessing
[1:42:08] all things we are walking in this world
[1:42:13] like we have nothing but yet we possess
[1:42:16] all things I think that's Philemon or
[1:42:19] Philippines or somewhere in there
[1:42:20] Philippians I believe we possess all
[1:42:23] things it's been given to us I'm an heir
[1:42:25] of it amen God chose me from before the
[1:42:29] foundation of the world to be an heir of
[1:42:31] all things I receive it my faith down on
[1:42:35] the inside of me rises up and accepts it
[1:42:37] it's mine and I know that if I need
[1:42:40] anything up on this life's journey I
[1:42:42] just reach out with my hand of faith and
[1:42:45] grab it it's mine I need it I need it
[1:42:48] for the kingdom of heaven's sake and I
[1:42:50] am a part of his kingdom
[1:42:51] and if his kingdom has a need my faith
[1:42:55] reaches out and grabs that for God's
[1:42:57] kingdom because I'm about my father's
[1:42:59] business isn't that what Jesus did when
[1:43:02] he when he when they are he's 12 years
[1:43:04] old and they're telling him that you
[1:43:06] should be with your father he said I
[1:43:09] must be about my father's business his
[1:43:12] faith reached out and drew the title
[1:43:15] amen of who his father really was a ment
[1:43:19] why because that was more real to him
[1:43:21] than what they had told him in the
[1:43:24] natural amen amen
[1:43:28] so we also have to believe the same
[1:43:30] thing Abraham who walked in that dry
[1:43:33] land believed that that city was there
[1:43:35] amen so we walk in this dry land we
[1:43:39] believe forgiven
[1:43:40] here we believe health is here we
[1:43:42] believe our restore body is here a man
[1:43:45] we believe the rapture is here we
[1:43:46] believe perfection is here
[1:43:48] amen we believe that all the attributes
[1:43:50] there are here
[1:43:51] amen that the statue of a perfect man is
[1:43:54] right here it's mine he paid for it
[1:43:57] amen and my faith says it's mine
[1:44:01] amen amen faith brought down the walls
[1:44:04] of Jericho amen faith created the
[1:44:06] heavens and the earth faith brought
[1:44:08] Lazarus out it was a great amen
[1:44:12] Faith's brought that in the dead back to
[1:44:14] life again faith did all those things
[1:44:16] and still working in the sons and
[1:44:18] daughters of God today amen faith will
[1:44:21] restore you back to the right
[1:44:22] relationship with him amen because he
[1:44:24] had a picture of all these things in his
[1:44:27] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:44:29] but now Jehovah Jireh will see to it
[1:44:32] what he thought he will see amen amen
[1:44:35] let's just an amen the very power that
[1:44:41] God used to create the heavens and the
[1:44:43] earth that power has now been given unto
[1:44:46] those that believe and we have been
[1:44:49] saved from being natural beans and to
[1:44:52] mean supernatural means a man let's just
[1:44:55] grab our heads and word prayer Heavenly

[1:44:59] great faith or that you've given us Lord
