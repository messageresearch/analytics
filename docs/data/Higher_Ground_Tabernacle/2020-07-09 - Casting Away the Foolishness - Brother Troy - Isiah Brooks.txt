known how to ask all the things he's done for us amen hey man let's just get right into the message this morning or this evening well as we stand we'll open our Bibles to book of Nehemiah chapter 13 wanted to speak a message this evening called casting away the foolishness from Nehemiah chapter 13 verse verse 4 through 9 just everybody's had a good week it's always nice to come in the midst of the week and you're dealing with everybody that's out there we gathered together one place one people one Accord believing the same thing expecting trusting in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we know in whom we've believed it and we're not here in doubt we're not here wondering who we are we're not here hoping we know who we are we're here because we believe we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ he has called us to be his bride and because of that we came to this place came to this room not to hear from me not to hear from any one of us but to hear from the Most High God and I believe that that expectation they're coming into this place with that expectation putting our trust in that that he made for us there wherever two or three here gathering in my name I will be right there in the midst of them that by that divine appointment that by that divine promise that he gave to us that we put our trust in that promise that he will have respect unto his word and come down into this room what kind of people aren't we to be what kind of a hearts ought we to have the seeming to not come out of tradition to not come out of just being tired we're coming out of but to lay all those things down and Leila sings outside and I say Lord I ain't coming in the one faith that you gave unto me to cast my burdens down at your feet to trust in you as the Most High God and to cast away all my foolishness and to look forward towards the cross towards then dwelling of the holy spirit that he has given unto us amen that's the only way we can live in this day let's read law as I said Nehemiah chapter 13 we'll start with the fourth verse read on down to the ninth verse and you remember this is when the children of Israel that left the Babylonian captivity behind they've gone back to Jerusalem they have a commandment to rebuild the temple and this is a little of the things we're going on trying to rebuild that place where God could be properly worshiped and it's an interesting to see how this little glimpse of all the trials you know something like this when God is turning a corner does not come without trials and this is a time when God was turning a corner and with that corner came trials came tests and a test is always to see what you're gonna do with it and that's what God was happening to the children of Israel is here right now a God was testing them and trying them to see what they would do with that test was that trial verse 4 says Nehemiah here he's talking he says I'm before this alaya should the priest having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God it's quite a position it's quite a responsibility he had the the position of having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God but he was allied on to Tobiah and he had prepared him now it's not saying he prepared to God but he prepared unto Tobiah a great chamber where before they had laid the meat offerings and the frankincense and the vessels and the ties of the court and the new wine and the oil which were commanded to be given to the Levites to the singers to the porters and the offerings of the priests but all this time was I not in Jerusalem for in the two and the thirtieth year of our taxes a king of Babylon came I into the King and for certain days I obtained leave of the King so he went 500 miles back to Babylon to take care of these matters and he comes back to see what condition the temple is in after coming back so he travels 500 miles back to Jerusalem and he and this is what he comes back to to the sea the man has the oversight of the house of the God to see what condition the house of God is in and it says when I came to Jerusalem and I understood of the evil that Elijah did for Tobiah and preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God and he grieved me sore therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber and then I commanded and they cleansed the Chamber's and thither I brought again the vessels of the house of God with the meat offerings and the frankincense and I perceived that the portion of the Levites had not been given to them for the Levites and the singers that did the work they had fled everyone unto his field and then I contended with rulers I said why is the house of God forsaken and I gathered them together and I set them in their place then brought all of Judah the tide of the corn and new wine in the oil and the treasure and the Treasuries Amy let's just let's just stop right there let's just bow our heads in winter prayer heavenly thought we just approach unto you this evening trust in a new lord the one that called us here the one that gave the promise that when we did come you'll be with us that that same God is able to make provisions for us tonight Lord that a message might go forth Lord not a message of my own lips Lord but a message from you to the people Lord I pray we come in that expectation Lord that you will meet the people here at their hearts door so therefore Lord let us prepare our hearts right now Lord for we didn't come in and just any old way but we came in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we came in the one that shows us that called us that has delivered us from sin and shame and and as cleansed us and prepared us for your ownself Lord that's to you that we came Lord then Lord let us be worthy of this great high and holy calling and prepare our hearts to receive Christ in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen he could be seated you know I can only imagine that when Nehemiah is going through he knew his calling was to leave the things of Babylon behind to go back to Jerusalem and to rebuild the house of God but in order to rebuild the house of God they had to go back to the ways of Moses to go back to the law of Moses beforehand and to set everything back in order the way that it ought to be so they had to take the first you have to evaluate the condition of the place and he came when we came to Jerusalem he found that the temple was in ruins that there the place had been burned down there was unclean animals were milling in and out and going in and out of the holy place and and so the first thing you had to do was begin to set a boundary a place where knowing clean thing will cross this threshold that we I set a boundary here that this place will be reserved and sanctified for the for the Most High God and what's he big set that boundary he lived back to the the law of Moses to see what ought to be inside that place and he began to see it they there's little rooms in the place and this room was reserved for this and this room over here was reserved for that and so the the ties and the meal offerings and the offerings unto God and all these places had little rooms and and he began to fill up those rooms with the the items that ought to be in those places so that God could be properly worshiped so that God could have a place of rest upon the earth so that God that went so if God ever came to come to visit by that place that God would be drawn to that place then be the house of God's rest that that be a place where you know I think we all know the condition that we all know that revivals come we all know that there are times of revival we all know that there are times when the Spirit of God comes through the city and comes through the place but he always comes to the houses that are prepared he always comes to the houses that been made clean he always comes to the people that are been praying to the keep people have been waiting the people who have been crying out for the sins that are done in the city and the Holy Spirit is always drawn to those places and so there in Jerusalem they began to make Jerusalem back into that kind of a place back into that kind of place where the Spirit of God would be welcomed where the Spirit of God could have room to move and live and have his beat and they'd begin to make the the Temple in Jerusalem that type of a holy place but then they remember that they were there that that Babylon still had oversight over the region and Nehemiah had to go back to Babylon to see about some matters in some business and so he he assigned a man to have oversight over the house of the Most High God and and Nehemiah was gone in those two years he came back to see how the revival was going on how the house of God was being built how the place was being persevere to maintain and that the house see if the spirit God have been visiting on a regular basis to see if God was still being worshipped and he found out that the man that had the oversight over the house of God had had allied himself with the enemy had to make a an alliance with the enemy and had taken one of the the rooms of the house of God one of the rooms in the temple of God and had given that to the enemy just that little room this is the enemy's place a little house where the enemy can come in and live and rest and have peace you know let me tell you one thing is God is a jealous God and God does not like to share his house but be assured that if God ever calls a house back to himself again if a house ever gets cleansed and sanctified and reserved unto God that house belongs to God and to God alone and he's not there to share he's not there to just give a little bit of real estate to himself and a little bit of real estate over to the enemy no that place is theirs to be dedicated unto the Lord so when you read that those verses their communities all almost imagine Nehemiah is heartbreaking you know he that that verse Sara says that Elijah cheb the priests having the oversight of the chamber of the house of God was a lie done to Tobiah and prepared him a great cheat prepared him a great chamber the thing of it is as Nehemiah knew the vision he knew the corner that God was turning he knew what God the expectation that God had the vision that God laid out and just assured if God ever lays out a vision God has an intent that that vation will come to pass and then there are going to be a people upon this earth they will recognize that vision and when they recognize that vision they have respects under the word of God and the Spirit of the God begins to move upon their life and they dedicate their lives unto that vision and let me assure that God will not until that vision is manifested in their lives but when the man that has the vision in his mind begins to look at the house of God and all sudden begin to see the men over here men over there are beginning to reserve their hearts chambers and give them back over to the enemy it breaks as blood iran says it breaks you see what makes a minister's heart break amen let's turn to Hebrews chapter 10 read a few verses there from Hebrews 10 verse 11 Paul here he's speaking he says talking about the duties of the of the priests and of the house of God he says and every priest you Paul must have seen something I don't think Paul could have written this without permission I think Paul had to that here's our you know Paul is a prophet and I think he had to have seen something he had just seen about how the priests year after year would offer these sacrifices I think come right back around the next year and go through the whole process all over again why they have to go through it again if the year before if it didn't it's like the year before it didn't work what but they're just going through over and over again offering the same sacrifices offering the same sacrifices but never quite paying for the sins the sins were never paid for the debt still remained a man there's still an imbalance upon the earth a man where he have man's God's expectation and God's law over here and then our sins over here and the scales were tipped way against our favor and the sacrifice is over and over again we're just drawing the sheet over the scales of God's justice but if that sheeters ever pulled off you just see that the imbalance still remained a man but but now you come down to verse 12 but this man Paul had you seen that but this man after he had offered once you in the midst of your day's work you don't sit down wait cuz you have still have work to do but but this man sat down why because his work was finished she sat on the cross it is finished and in verse 30 says from hits forth he was expecting until his enemies be made his footstool you but instead he gave and prepared a chamber for the enemy in the house of God but not this man Lord Jesus Christ because Lord Jesus he has an expectation that this house of God will once forever be preserved for him and for him alone and he knows that all of his enemies will be under his feet now God has a house and he as this house will be preserved however you remember as I preached a long time ago in Ezekiel chapter 43 if you remember the story I'm not going to go through it but in Ezekiel chapter 40 the prophet Ezekiel was leaving Babylon and he is walking down by the river Chebar and all of sudden he begins to see the presence of God coming down along both sides of the river and it's just big flaming whirling fire and he says you know that's the same thing you know I saw years and years ago now I know that's the presence of God in this place coming down to visit me and is that worldly got closer and closer all of a sudden he took him far away back 500 miles over to Jerusalem in the spirit and began to show he began to show Ezekiel the the condition of the of the temple of the Lord the house and roots vahana was destroyed how how the true Israel sins had destroyed the city but then he took them off he says but let me tell you I want to show you another tabernacle I want to show you another temple that will never be broken down I want to show you a tipple that will never be destroyed and he spends three chapters Ezekiel 41 42 43 three chapters describing a perfect temple it'll be it'll be so many cubics here it'll be so I'll be this wide it'll be this tall will be this deep it'll have this many pillars the pillars will have pomegranates here and and carvings there and and there'll be an archway over here and and he had every single single thing already deal to detailed out because God had a vision of what his house was going to look like and he spends three chapters describing the vision to the prophet Ezekiel and then when he's all done he tells prophet Ezekiel take the description of this house to the elders of the house of Israel and let them know that the house of Israel that the temple is in ruins because of their sins and I want you to make them jealous and show them the vision of what the house is supposed to look like and what the condition mean he says that we can let them know that one of these days there will be a house there will never be defiled again there will never be have any defilement the enemy won't come in though the unclean things won't come in anymore it'll never be a place but a place where I can come and live permanently and that will be the condition of us and make them jealous for what they have done to them of the house of my god I have to imagine it if the men had any spirituality left in them at all they would have to feel about this tall so realizing what their sins had done to the house of God but God still had in his mind a vision of perfect house of God that has no foolishness and you know and God still has the same thing today you know God has in his mind the image of an overcoming bride God has in his mind the image of a bride that will overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony then they've got God has a vision of a Bride of Christ that marches underneath the power of the Holy Ghost a bride that just one little nod from the Lord will go off over here and beam out her father's business and go off over here and be bound her father's business over there and over here a place that where when God wants to move in the city that he can whoa shall I choose this my son over here my daughter over here and he has so many choices because to work through because his bride has made herself available for the moving of the Holy Spirit and then because we know that one of these days the Holy Spirit's going to move we know that it's going to come when the bride has made herself ready Lord Here I am today I am requesting Lord cleanse me of my sins wash me of all the foolishness I've done wrong Lord cleanse me make me ready for the day father so Lord that if you want to move Lord if you want to witness to anybody if you won't be a comfort comfort or anybody if you want to bring healing to someone Lord they I'm here Lord I am available father no I'm not saying here oh woe is me woe is me but Laura I'm saying Here I am Lord Sid me Lord send me to the plate to the people to have the need and God has his people that have made themselves ready for the work of the Lord so that when the holy spirit against begins to move the yeren condition your heart is prepared for you to be instantly dispersed instantly sent to me about God's work and when when and the way that we're revival comes upon the church you have like oh we make this right oh I got to repent for this oh I got it repent for that no but when the holy spirit begins to move on the church your heart is clean your heart is prepared your heart is ready why because you've been about your father's business Amen you're already you're prepared and you're ready for for the movement of the Spirit well because we know that the Spirit of God is going to come into this place we know what the Spirit of God is going to come into your prayer closet we know what the spirit God is gonna visit you and you're in your car but what condition are you gonna be when the Spirit of the Lord God comes will you be ready to move out or will you be like oh let me get this right oh let me get this right let me get all of the the stuff out of the chamber let me bring the stuff back in there's supposed to be in there and give her the son oh no no no no see it's not time for that we got to be ready and about our father's business why because we're not back there in the time of those sacrifices but we're in the day of Hebrews 10 11 10 12 but this man offered a sacrifice one time so that we might be cleansed of our sins washed and made ready so that the Holy Spirit can come and live and cleanse us and let me tell you once he cleanses you that heart will be clean forever because he is here ceil you so will no more be defiled ever again that was the promise amen that you be a ray to move instantly about her father's business you know we might have our little trouble in the flesh here and there but it doesn't touch that heart amen amen God set down Jesus Christ offered once and he sat down expecting expecting you know we got to have that same expectation where we have that knowledge we just know you know you know it's interesting you know sometimes you know I don't we like tonight you know I just didn't really feel ready to be up here hardly you know I somehow miss the schedule and I open up the email around three o'clock and I was like oh brother Troy's preaching well that's me and I'd missed the memo and I don't know how I missed it but I did and I'm like lord I don't feel ready I don't feel prepared but lord I know it's you have a message for the people and it's not that I wasn't ready but it's just sometimes you just don't you just like Lord Who am I who why am i that type of person you know why should I be up amongst all the people why not my brother so-and-so or my brother so so Who am I but then all of us have that same condition who are we to be the witness under the city who are we but we are the one that God chose every single of us from the least of the greatest we are the ones that God chose to get on our knees and pray for the city we are the one that God chose to be filled with the Holy Ghost and who are we we can't say woe is me woe is me but we need to get up and say Lord here am I send me amen and have trust he set down as expected and an expectation then we gotta get to that place where we can also sit down but you know there's only one way to do that and that's by trust you know the Holy Ghost brother branham he had a quote there from how can I overcome he preached in 1963 he was talking about Noah's Ark I just want to read this quote there he's talking about Noah's Ark he says now think hard now if you're laying around getting Dodi getting soft get in get into the ark hurry quick because the door might close at any time he says there has always been an ark in God's economy at all times God has always had an ark in his economy a place for God's people to get on the inside and there's always and when the time comes the door closes and those that are on the inside or inside those are on the outside or outside amen and there's an ark in the days of Noah for the saving of his people and there was an ark in the days of the law there was an ark of the testimony and in the days of the law they followed the ark and there was a third dispensation right now like Noah's time like lots time and now this time there is an ark right now and that Ark is not in a denomination Amen not is it good works that you do but it's by one spirit that is the ark Romans 8:1 we are all baptized into one body in the domain of that kingdom one spiritual baptism no matter how good or how bad whatever you're in that kingdom by the Holy Ghost baptism see that's the only way you overcome you know every single one of us we just read that sermon title how can I overcome your own many of us he's sorry it always makes you look down in your life am i overcoming just now and in the temptation is always to think about your own mental condition you know many people there's many a good legalist can say I have overcome ayuh strived my whole life and I have lived pure and clean and I have overcome but that's not gonna do you any good many a good legalists will call themselves a good overcomer but it's not by legalism see you're just that blackbird put it in the peacock feathers you can't do it no no no no you don't do that hey man brother man says and that's the message he says the same thing he's talking about the Holy Spirit baptism he owned the title the message was how can I overcome and I command everybody sitting there in the audience that day what's taking wallet oh that's good I want to find out how can I overcome this is Rea I want to see where he says I'm gonna write this down in my notes how can I overcome and brother branham he's getting ready to get out the secret right here and he says see that's the only way you overcome and it's all that is under the shed blood is overcomers because you cannot overcome yourself it's he that overcome for you you are resting you are resting how will I know then brother brother branham that I'm in there he says watch what kind of life you're living just look around see if it's just lived out of you automatically or do you have to strain and pull see then you're doing it don't try to do it did you ever try it yeah don't I like that the Jarrett right don't that's not our business we're here to do the same thing enter in a sit-down with him on his throne and rest amen but you could only do it by getting on your knees and wait for him to do the work for you amen repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he will come and bring the promise to you and fill you with the Holy Ghost amen amen that's how you overcome amen and what will he do then he will prepare the chamber but let me tell you if you are just reserving these little rooms for the enemy the Holy Spirit can't see love that doesn't matter the revival can come and they say oh the places already go and then evangelist Sami go away for two years like Nehemiah did I'm gonna go away for two years I'm gonna come back and the Evangelist comes back two years later well two years ago you came right to the altar right here and you laid all this stuff down I know I come back two years later I found out that you've just you kicked out all the ties you kept out all the offerings you kicked out all the good things you gave to God and you brought back in all this stuff to the enemy he put it right back in and Nehemiah says yeah we get down to the to the end of the chapter and Nehemiah you know what it says he says and I laid hands on him and then one he wasn't praying for him he grabbed him by the shirt coat and he threw him out of the temple he laid hands on it he says Oh Lord remember me for good because I have had a zeal for the house of God I love that well that last chapter in Nehemiah he's like you can just see he's wore out he's tried he's tried he's like the Evangelist he's tried he's preached he's tried to keep the house clean and he's gotten all the junk out of the house he's tried to prepare a bride for for jehovah and he says remember me at the end he says remember me O Lord for good and every single one of us wants to be in that same condition Lord I've tried to keep the house clean Lord remember me for good remember me for the sealing of the Holy Ghost I remember me that when the Holy Spirit comes into the city remember me Lord that that when you are here to do a work in the city that I am here Lord I am available I've tried to keep my heart clean my lord and I've realized that my own trying is faulty my own trying is worthless as hard as I try I just can't keep myself clean enough I can't see keep myself worthy enough I can't keep myself good enough Oh Lord I'm just laying it all down Lord forgive me Lord cleanse me Lord fill me with your spirit Lord put a wall fire around about me Lord keep the temptation away from me Lord keep the deceiver away from my heart's door I am preparing my house Lord for you Lord and for you alone Lord I'm casting away all the foolishness Lord I'm casting away all the the wickedness out of my house Lord all the things that I've done wrong Lord I'm laying them down once more Lord come and fill the house Lord put up the wall of fire around about me Lord fill me and make me clean Lord oh I'm casting away my foolishness Lord because I know that the Holy Spirit is coming to the house and I want you to seal this place and I want you to cleanse this place and I want this to be a place as prepared not for the enemy but for a God himself to come and live and dwell and move and have his bean let that be the place why because we know that the Spirit is coming well Oh Lord what condition will we be in when he comes God has made an appointment for this - an appointment for this church God has made an appointment for every one of us there will be a time of refreshing for every person amen and when that time refreshing comes what condition will you be ain't it when when revival comes and strikes to church when everybody starts jumping up as shouting and praised in the Lord will you be like oh I shouldn't have done such and such today oh I wish I had been more clean cleaning and sanctified today oh I wish I had done this and that know when the Holy Spirit begins to move upon the bride don't be in that place don't be the one that has to make excuses don't be the one that has to wonder oh I wish I hadn't done this wish i under that I wish I'd been more ready for the moving of the waters I wish I'd been more ready for the move to the spirit no but be that one that comes into the house of the Lord ready you got your lick of fire ready upon the altar you've washed away your sins and the blood of the Lamb you're you you've carried yourself on the side of the righteous you set down your expecting that all of your enemies will be placed under your feet why because you're underneath the blood of the Lamb and you're sitting with Christ in his throne and you know where you stand why because you've made thing ready you've made things right and you're not harboring little places in your heart for the enemy amen casting away all of our foolishness why the Holy Spirit is coming amen amen but we ought to be a people as prepared and ready so when the Holy Spirit does come that he'll have a place a house to move in amen Nehemiah knew that that was the time of restoration he knew the vision he know he knew what was coming because every time throughout the Bible every time God restored his house he was restoring it so the pillar of fire could come down to the house a man he knew that was coming but the by Elijah was not having the same vision think about it if that man Elijah should have had the oversight of the house of God if he had signed up if he is in tune with the vision he wouldn't have done such a thing but there's always two different types of people in the church amen but we're not here to be that other type of person we're here to live ourselves live our lives clean for the Gospels sake amen amen Matthew 18 for jesus said verily i say unto you that except you be converted and become as little children is she not enter into the kingdom of heaven you and how good we've done this and that but let me tell you if the Holy Spirit is not doing it it's all in foolishness it's all envy amen but if you can just let the Holy Spirit have his work in you when you're on your knees when you're in your prayer closet all alone and God is preparing your heart and working in through you and then all of a sudden you who put yourself in secret God will begin to reward you openly amen I'll never forget that time in Brazil we were at a a convention and there was probably a hundred and 150 different churches people from different churches had gathered to one place for this convention there's I think two or three thousand if I recall maybe five thousand there at the Billings with another twenty five thousand watching over the Internet huge convention and had a huge auditorium there was enough room in the auditorium it was bigger this entire building the were in and could probably fit almost ten in these little buildings inside that one and I had been told that that evening that we were invited to eat and everybody they were going to feed all the thousands of people but we were invited to not eat with all the rest but we were actually invited to eat with the pastor of that church at his state and he had a little room with about two tables in it and room probably thirty people to sit out of those five thousand and and I me and this other brother were from Brazil we were gonna we were an expectation that we were going to sit in that room but then when the time come we didn't know exactly where that room was there was a big place and we got separated from the group and it was time to eat and we didn't know how to get there and so my brother was a little upset or a little perturbed I suppose he felt like he should have been there and yeah we didn't have anything else to do we were hungry so we went and got in line about time the line was already you know three city blocks long or whatever and and so we were standing in that line and he was I could tell he was just a little bummed a little put out that we weren't where we were supposed to be we had to eat with everybody else and I was just so inspired and I says don't don't ever worry about taking last place always let God exalt you because you put yourself in the last place and then you give God the chance to exalt you you don't have to lift yourself up just put yourself in the last place and take your place willingly and then give God room to exalt you he's like okay I can do that brother and just within a minute of saying that some man comes walk up to us and says what are you doing here you're supposed to be over there you know the room and he came and he took us out of the line and came and put us at the pastor's table and as we were eating their eyes like brother do you realize what I said there was a prophecy God was speaking teaching us both a little lesson we don't have to push we don't have to try but relax keep your house clean before the Lord let him exalt you let him do the play see main will generally be doing what they're called to do why because God is leading them as they pray and read their Bible amen God is leading them and they'll be worried no should I be this or should I be doing this and worry about this and all the time God is just leading them God is leading them a lot of times they don't even know it a lot of times God's people are already doing what God called them to do and they're over there worrying about what God is calling them to do I see it over and over again it's throughout Christendom god has his people all over the place and half of them are worrying about what they ought to be doing the Holy Spirit's already leading them right where they're supposed to be relax settle down let God place you where you ought to be because you just trust in the Lord sit down and expect until your enemies become your footstool because that's what your Lord is doing and you are you and him or we're flesh of his flesh and we're bone of his bone right amen amen amen everybody wants to be and believes that they are brought to believe that way that there are overcomers but overcoming has nothing to do with your physical or mental ability to keep yourself but it's your ability to surrender to the holy spirit of the Living God amen amen so you got a humble yourself and come as a little child in order to enter into the kingdom of heaven and that's how you become the greatest in the kingdom of heaven every child must be tested tried chastened why God wants to see what direction you will run when things get rough and find out if deep down inside your heart in those little chambers if nir is faith or unbelief and when the trial comes that's going to find out whether that little chamber it has faith in there or unbelief faith in there or fear faith or doubt I have someone that I know that is on the fence between atheism and Christianity they don't know way to go there on the fence and they know it and they were complaining about the Christian Church to me and saying well why do churches do this and why do they do that and I say well you know there's really only two kinds of churches for people in the church its believers and unbelievers make believers you know and they're all going to be divided out in their times you know there's only two spirits in the church and but really the people in the church are either operating by fear or faith and a lot of the wicked things you hear about going on in the churches that cause people to think they have an excuse to go towards atheism is caused by the see people operating by fear and it's like someone I know someone that recently passed away they were they took I had heard once that when they were a child that they had gone to a Baptist sunday-school and the minister took all the children in a back room and had him whole out their hands he burned them all with the lighter and says this is what hell will feel like and tried to and he tried to get them to heaven through fear you know and pain and torment but let me tell you I don't think that's a witnessing tool you know but in reality think about what was going to that that ministers mind to do such a thing he was afraid that he couldn't get the children to believe the way he believed and so and because he couldn't convince them with his words he thought he'd convince them with a lighter and so he's operating through fear but let me tell you we're not here to operate through fear and you can see that throughout the church there's really two different ways a minister can operate fear through fear or through faith and any when you when you spot people operating through fear then just well that's about all they can do but let me tell you we're not here to operate that way we're here to operate through the faith with all of thy God why because that's what is dwelling on the chambers of the heart amen every child must be tested and tried and chastened because it will see what direction you run to when the pressure comes when you are tested and tried where are you going to go into which direction are you going to go we're in the tough when the turn when the going gets tough would you trust in the Lord you place it on the Lord or you begin to wander or fear do you begin to think well Who am I am I really saved or am i this I my that well you ought to have that old cell before the tests comes amen amen brother Ram said once he says what is that little thing that comes and takes away the first little difficulty that comes your way what is that little thing that comes and takes it all away from you well first they'll try out Austin yes God finds you sitting back down on the floor first little a trial or test comes by all sudden you're just defeated what cause is that it's because faith isn't in there in that little inner chamber amen amen let's turn over to 2nd Kings here in closing I preached on this a long time ago it was last year sometime about making room for the Word of God at second Kings I love this story story of Elijah and and this shunammite woman and in second Kings chapter 4 verse 8 it says you the thing about it is is this prophet of God Elijah you say he lives over here at point eight and God would tell him I want you to go over here and do this once you go over here and do this always being led of the Holy Ghost you know God's children love to be led of the Holy Ghost it's one of the greatest joys in our life is when we can look back at a situation and realize that God was leading us all the way through there let me tell you there's nothing like it in the world there is absolutely nothing like that in the world there is almost no there's no experience like it when you look back and you realize oh my god had me do this and I turned to the right and I realized God had me do that now you look back he realized that God was just leading you all the way but the jesus said the Holy Spirit was like the wind nobody knows where he comes from nobody wears knows where he's going but and so are those that are led by the Holy Spirit or the same way they aren't know what people you can't tell where a Holy Spirit led man is gonna come where he's gonna go why because he's led by the Spirit of God and so was this man Elijah this prophet Elijah led by the Holy Ghost and frequently when he left his left his house he would go for a little why's down the road and he had passed by this woman's house and so he kept passing by and she realized that he was a righteous man and he was a holy man and and she had respects unto Jehovah so she began to invite him into her house to eat what a blessing to have a prophet of God coming eating at your house but then he would eat his meal and he would say well I got a keep on going down the road before the Sun sets like I have a place to go and rest so he would keep moving on down the road so he can get to his place that evening where he could sleep and the woman said yeah after a while seeing that she's like said to her husband she said you know I think we could get him to stay a little bit longer because you know if he didn't if he it'd be more of a blessing to us if we can be a blessing to God surrett we want to be a blessing to god's servant if we don't give him a meal but we also gave him a place to rest and so they she told her husband let's make an opening in our wall right here get out the saw and cut this little hole in the wall we're gonna make a little chamber add on to our house and we're gonna make this little room here and we're gonna put a little cot in here and and make a little table and we'll make a little stool for him to sit there at and a little lamp so he can sit and study by the by the fire and then he can go and I mean if he has to scroll with them or a few swans to pray there or wherever he wants to do and then ways gets tired he can rest on the cot and he can be at peace upon his journey and so it cut and they got everything all ready they they they prepared the stool and the cot and they made a little lamp there and they and they made the table and got everything ready and the chamber prepared and sure enough it wasn't that much longer that they heard the prophet of God walking down singing hymns unto Jehovah or joy seenin and praising God and on down the road and and then they and they saw him going by whistling or whatever he was doing it and he they invited me to supper and they said we've made you a little room so you don't have to stay just any old place under a tree somewhere but we want you to come in here and be comfortable and and in ear and welcome here anytime at all just come in here and be comfortable and they made a room for the Word of God to dwell in and so the Prophet he he goes into the little chamber and he lays down on the cot and the Bible says that in verse 11 there and it fell on a day that he came thither and he turned into that chamber and he laid down he laid there and is the Word of God as the prophet of God was resting there the whole sudden something came upon his mind and he called him to gaze a servant he says call this shunammite woman you often a God in your house in your heart a meteora it's good a good place for us to have room for the Word of God let me tell you when the Word of God comes into your heart what happens to it does it does it it doesn't maybe just come for a meal and you enjoy it and it keep on going or have you prepared a place for the word to come and stay to where you are in full agreement with the Word of God then whatever the word says you say yes and amen yes the name it yes that's nothing but the truth Lord not Lord that's the truth that is nothing about the truth I believe that I say yes the name into that is that your attitude towards the word you know are you or are you in the word a stranger you know what condition what what what have you laid up in the chambers of your heart well this woman here she she she made room for the word for the prophet in her heart and the Word of God enters into that chamber and as the word was resting all sudden he began to speak ask what you will whatever you want it should be done unto you whatever you want now that didn't happen when the word was just eating his meal and going on through but once she had made a room for God for God's servant upon the earth God's representative on the earth to come and dwell then it was asked whatsoever you will is that what happened to sister Hattie right when when when she heard about the acts of the Holy Spirit and the Prophet the things that the Holy Spirit had led him to do and she said that's nothing but the truth and there was God's representative right there in her house and she was giving him a meal and and he had been there with him so many times and he said she said the right thing let her know ask what you will it'll be unto you and she said well what should I ask he's ask whatever you want to ask anything right now million dollars ask you'll be right here he says that's that third Pole and let me tell you we are still living in those days God's representative is still on the earth it's the Holy Spirit of the Living God and we're not here just to enjoy a fine meal of the word in this church service then walk right out and let the Holy Spirit go as Mary wait but no we got to make a room in our heart for him and we're here we got to make room in our heart for the Holy Spirit maker all the Chamber's got any fill with the Holy Ghost and we're not here to reserve rooms for the enemy we're not here to resume reserve this little space this little thing for Tencent over here but we're down on her knees say O Lord God here oh my lord have mercy upon me from our sins Lord Lord I can't do it myself I can't keep myself clean well or it's here it's me I'm standing in need of prayer O Lord or come move upon my heart Lord see lord I am preparing my heart right now for you come and dwell in this place I am offering my heart upon your altar as a sacrifice so I could be a prisoner of the righteousness of the Almighty God or come and live and move on me and have your being or be mighty in me live in me one little nod Lord and I want to be about to your business Lord come and live in me I don't want to just enjoy you when the word is going forth over the pulpit Lord I don't want to just enjoy the sermons of the Most High God but then go off and do my own thing but Lord I want to be in partnership flesh of your flesh bone of your bone Lord I know the Holy Spirit is coming but when he comes I want my my spirits are already prepared for the revival are you repaired for the refreshing because the final revival is coming one of these days and that revival will not be just a rejoicing in the church not be just a powerful act amongst us people the city but it'll be a catching away when we are revived renewed and then transformed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye to come exactly and be transformed according to the vision because the day is coming but what condition will your heart being when that comes will you be trying to live your own life or will be the Holy Spirit pushing out from you a man prepare your own heart cast away all your foolishness I'm a crew for the Holy Spirit amen remember the sermon you know digging the ditches you know and brother Ram we preach that sermon I already member what the name of the sermon was but but uh but uh he's talking about that time when the Prophet I think as in jehosophat's day when they were fighting and in the in the dry valley in the desert and they were in the valley and they were didn't have any water and they were getting faint and they were getting ready to lose the battle because they had no water and and the Prophet said Allison had a vision he says water is coming through the dry Valley and they went to Jehoshaphat and he said water will come rushing down to this valley for a short period of time but the only way it will stick around is if you dig this valley full of ditches and he says if you dig this full of valley full of ditches when the water comes they'll fill them all and you'll have water for the rest of the battle the rest of this month while we're here and so they went and they dug and however deep they dug that's how much water the head and sure enough after they dug all the ditches your brother Brandon who hate the little drama movie he says they would hit a little rock of unbelief and they would just picked that rock up and throw it off to the side yeah this little rock here of this little pet sand and this will that and this little trouble and they get it out of the way why because the water is coming and as soon as the water the time of refreshing has come however they dug their ditch that's the water they got and the time of refreshing come is sure enough the ditches were filled amen and they were refreshed and renewed I believe that God's time or refreshing is going to come and and we those that are already filled with the Holy Ghost will be the ones and going to the inner chamber with it amen but those that are keeping their hearts chambers trying to split the fence their folly will be made known amen let's just stand we all of us ought to be making room for the Spirit of God in our lives so every time the spirit has a desire to move and live and have his being in the city in the place and the home wherever he has someone to work through someone to live through and that person is us so we can become the people of God we can become God still has Bible characters upon this earth a man there's still Timothy's and Mary's and Martha's they're still Saint Paul's and and Peters upon the earth they're still in Oxon and Elijah and Elijah's upon the earth amen and it's me it's you it's us and it's the people that the Holy Spirit has the ability to move in and live in and have a place foxes have dens birds there's the nests jesus said the Son of man has no place to lay his head but there is coming a pyramid that is prepared throughout all the ages and she is preparing for the capstone come down as we see the little drawing on the wall our brother Isiah preached Sunday and when that cat stone comes down upon the pyramid the bottom of that capstone the capstone is Christ but the bottom of that capstone has to match up perfectly with the top of the pyramid and the top of the pyramid that church and the last days will be honed and prepared and cleaned and that this corner of the top of the pyramid will meet up with this corner of the capstone in each corner meeting up with this corner and she will look so much like him it should be sealed and she'll pull down God out of heaven amen and then and the two will be made one United awaiting supper will take place but let us speed not those that are weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth blessed be those that are filled with the Holy Ghost because we made room for the Most High God in our heart he meant let's just power has no word prayer Heavenly Father we trust me we know who you are we've heard the sermons have been preached we've heard the evangelists that come and go we've heard MIT so many find messages Lord we've heard so much work we've heard so many messages father we've heard what your prophet said about this last day we've heard all these things father but lor with all the abundance of hearing Lord Lord I want to make sure Lord that we are also not just hearing Lord but we're doing fulfilling we are being exactly according to the vision we are living our lives according to the vision that whatever you saw Lord before the foundation of the world that were coming to that place whatever the vision was that brother Branham had when he saw that that bride marching to the tune of Zion look or when she saw that bride marching in step were come to be that vision their feet right and stepped with the vision Oh Lord let it be unto us according to thy word Lord we've made a little chamber Lord right here father so that when you come into this this little tabernacle here and you preach a fine message to our brother Isaiah or through our brother Ben or odd or whoever it might be but every time you come to this place you preach this fine message or that we know you enjoy it Lord but we know which is just to come and go we've prepared a chamber or Lord in our heart father so you can come and live here so that you can come and rest so that you can come and live for foxes have dens the birds have nests and the Son of God now has a place to live upon this earth and it's right here it's in the heart of the Bride of Christ let it be Lord unto us according to thy work Lord we've heard your work the Lord must be in a condition according to your vision we believe in you Lord we've heard the vision the Lord let us now be exactly matching up to what the vision showed because we trust it Lord for you Lord you entered into the throne once you sat down one time if from henceforth you've ever been believing your enemies we made your footstool and Lord we're now sitting with you and your throne row we're coming by the blood of the Lamb by the word of our testimony the Holy Ghost let us also sit down and trust all doubt is gone it's been filled with faith the Holy Ghost where you believe we trust or if there be anybody here under the sound of my voice wherever you might be listening to a recording on the internet or listen here in this place wherever you might be if you hear this and this is not the condition of your heart if you're not living according to the vision if the Holy Spirit was to flow through the house you know that he would come and then he would go because there was nothing in your heart to receive him and right now you need to get on your knees we don't know how much time we have left and I asked you to get down on your knees and receive Christ receive The Anointed One they'll receive the Lutheran Jesus don't receive the Baptist Jesus don't receive the Pentecostal Jesus but receive the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ that's been revealed in this last day he's still the same yesterday today and forever he's still alive andreita fill his people with the Holy Ghost if you'll open up your heart believe in his work repent of your sins he will fill you with your Holy Ghost baptized in the name of the Lord let it be I had done unto us according to thy word god bless Saints come here to live our lives according to the vision the vision has been made plain let's run we know the Holy Spirit is coming but will he stay will he live in your heart or will he just keep on going not find a place he came by your hearts door but was he able to stay that's [Music] Jesus breaks every federal [Music] spray [Music] Jesus friend [Applause] [Music] better for
