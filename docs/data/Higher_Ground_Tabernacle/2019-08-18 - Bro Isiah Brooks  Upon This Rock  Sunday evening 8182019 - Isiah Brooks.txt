the door heavenly lover let thy precious cover Shekinah on Nene is all No oh you love the Lord he's sweet I know as we stand gonna get right into the Word of God thank you brother Marsha we appreciate you I so marvel how God can bring such a message as he did on this morning and yet we find that the message didn't fall in the right places had it fallen in the heart it would have been more people here tonight but that's what the Word of God says and here God's be call on diligent being more diligent in in the things that we do for God and Christians have become so weak and so how would I say it you just can't depend on them anymore like it used to but nevertheless amen we are here tonight and I want to speak a little message and hopefully it'll be a blessing to you I was going to continue on that thought I had last week on escaping the evil in the darkness but I'm gonna save that I'm working I got some more to come and so I want to give another little thought tonight so that you can see that you've got more than what you think you have because only the real true revelation of God in your heart will cause you to press through every how can I say it it would cause you to to push through every obstacle every hindrance everything that Satan places in your way it would cause you to go forward and not backwards so as we stand we're gonna ask that you turn with us to Exodus I'm sorry let's go to Matthew 15 16 please Matthew 16 we are thankful for the Word of God that came today real blessing what what the Lord brought forth last night in Iowa City was a blessing as well but I find out that having a good service it would either set you free or place you into more bondage you could never hear the word of God and remain the same it either sets you free or places you more into bondage Matthew 16 please a real simple message I believe that's the way God likes it he likes it so we can understand what we need to do and what he's saying Matthew 16 beginning at the fifteenth verse he said unto them but whom say ye that I am Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it let us pray Heavenly Father we come before you and we thank you for your amazing grace Lord you have been better to us than we are have been to ourselves and we thank you God we ask you now Lord to be with us in these trying times and the times that we find very hard but yet you ordained us for this time and so therefore we thank you Father bless the service bless those who are here tonight we ask these things in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated there are things that I have seen in this message which I don't know whether many people see it's right before us I really believe that the enemy has caused us to stress ourselves in knowing greater and deeper revelations and there's nothing with deep revelations matter of fact I love it it's good but there is a process in which we come through in order to secure our place in heaven deep revelation and knowing all the plans of God will do you no good if don't follow the pattern in which God has laid out for us to make a rapture to know what the seven thunders are to know what the seven seals to know that God sent a prophet all those things are great it is necessary it is something that we should know it is the children's bread but Paul who was the first angel first messenger in this great salvation of God has told us to know all the mysteries to understand all the mysteries and not have charity it profits us nothing it took the seventh angel brother branham Elijah to come in this day God took us a man who had only a seventh grade education he suffered he learned obedience through the things in which he suffered at times when he would let go wayward and in and make his own decision about things God spanked him and several times he almost died even though the ministries and the places he would go would explore with miracles yet he still was not in the perfect will of God because he chose to do it his way and I said all of that because God had a greater plan for him at the end time God would open up those seven seals and he needed a man who would not inject his own thoughts in his own feelings because he understood God knew that that that he did not need an interpreter of the word God needed someone who could bring the interpretation in otherwise the message is about the interim of william branham it is God speaking the interpretation through brother branham why are you saying all these things because we know in order to make a rapture in our age we must first be obedient by way of the spokesman who we know as Peter on the day of Pentecost they said what must we do to be safe he said repent and that's where that's one word you rarely ever hear preached across the pulpit is repentance what is repentance what good will it do for man to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ without repentance the baptism is of no avail it doesn't profit them anything because repentance must come first you understand what I'm saying so I'm trying to say these things I'm saying these things because my subject tonight is upon this rock because you got to realize that it's a revelation that God gives you it doesn't matter how much education you have you can have a doctor's divinity or DDL D of literature but if you don't have the revelation of who God is you'll never know who you are you'll never know you'll never come to understand where you come from and where you're going revelation as brother Brennan said it is so important to the bride but we have been listening to revelation at the revelation of a revelation it meant and most of the revelation that we have been listening to is basically who brother Branham is all the shadows and type of who he is who right is and all the shadows and types of who the bride is but we have not seen yet men preaching the Word of God to show the bride of Jesus Christ how to become bride hmm how do you become Ryo I just believe I'm right no it's more to it than that first of all a man must be born again you can cannot even understand this message until you born again because the carnal mind cannot understand the spiritual things that are of God you look right at it you can quote it and still not understand it because the Word of God because it is spirit it must be spiritually discerned that's why we see people over said gross darkness to cover the people but it's not it's not people are just out in the world they're lying darkness but it is the church they are the ones that are walking in gross darkness and they can't even comprehend that they are in darkness somebody help me here see a revelation must be given to you by God because that's what the Word of God said Peter who do you who do men say that I am then he goes up but who do you say I am we must know the I am and the I am must know us hallelujah you got to understand the bride of Jesus Christ is not a mail-order bride she didn't come by UPS no sir she is ordained of God she is a woman that is redeemable she was the thought of God in God's mind she was the thought she was the very existence of God in a feminine form it's amazing because the answer to Peters to Jesus question was you Dow are the Christ the Son of the Living God in other words you're not just a prophet you're more than a prophet you are the Living God that's what he's saying because Israel didn't believe in to gods or three gods they only knew one and they understood that when the Messiah would come he would be God is that what brother Adam said Jews know that when the Messiah comes he will be God in the flesh so in order to understand God you say why are you saying these things because Jesus could have used some other type upon this water but he said upon this rock I'll build my church in other words the rock was the revelation you understand me a rock of defense is your revelation of Jesus Christ okay if we can understand that the revelation of Jesus Christ is the very rock of defense it is your shelter hallelujah it is your buckler it is your shield it is your everything hallelujah just that one revelation as simple as it is boom he said the of Hell shall not prevail against this the revelation that Jesus Christ or God has come into the flesh that right remember even John said except a man believe that Jesus Christ is coming to the flesh he is Antichrist upon this rock upon this rock I build my church and let me understand when you working with bricks you lay those bricks and you build brick upon brick with the same kind of brick in other words the substance of the house must be of the substance of the foundation it must be of the same material hey he's my rock so when we hear the word rock you must understand it's not talking about some stone you throw or some natural granite or some kind of thing that nature put together when they talk about a rock they talk about their defense they're talking about the God who defeats all of their enemies remember there's always a saying let me stand on the rock where Moses Stewart you see because the rock in itself is what revelation not only is that right God the same rock that Jesus was talking about he says not not not not not like brother Brennan said not just Jesus is himself but the revelation of who Jesus is is that right who do men say I am listen it's the revelation of who he is that will bring us through this evil age we know he's not denomination we know he's not a Trinitarian we no he's not a to God we know he is one God and not like the oneness you must understand that because that will be the only way you understand your oneness with God Father I would that they be one even as we are one hallelujah and once you understand the oneness of Christ and God you understand your oneness upon this rock I build my church hallelujah he is my god and i'ma say it like this Amen that rock that Moses stood on it's the same rock that was in the rock right come on somebody remember when when when God took Marion mops and all they took he took him to her tomb a tomb that was in a rock but inside the rock was a rock in otherwise there was a revelation laying there hallelujah how can I say it I said Mary Martha but I'm saying when Mary went down to the tomb hairy man and saw a man that there stone was no longer there she says who stolen my lord hallelujah you don't have to steal him he's a gift going to God hallelujah she looked for him and he was right there it was only when God Himself Christ himself that great Rock opened her eyes and called her by name that's one thing about the revelation of God it calls you by name hallelujah when you think about today and the evil that is now lurking among the people of God among the Churches of God amen among what we call the bride it is amazing that people know all kinds of things about the message but they don't know the true Messinger but all of you understood the revelation the Word of God is out of any private interpretation so even William Branham could not privately interpret interpret the word it was Christ in him bringing the revelation of the word you understand and when you see that you can take those words as ah that's me when I hear the message of God I don't put it on somebody else I pray sit here I eat that word I take it in because I realize it is what I live by it is my protection Oh somebody help me here when I think about Amen the church built upon the rock and I think about the gates of Hell everybody think the gates of Hell Amen is some Clubhouse out here some kind of this is some kind of that out there no sir the gates of hell is church organization it is the systems that are offering life and the Bible tells us amen a call according to proverbs Amen I think seven if you go in there ain't nothing in there but death and you know I must understand Amen they say by seven oh my god let me move on we talk about life brother Balaam said you must have the token wonder what people think the token is you think the token is just a piece of cloth what is the token what is the token it's Jesus Christ when I see the Blood I pass over you it wasn't the chemistry of the blood it was the life that it represented that made that enemy pass over it we talked about heaven we must apply the token that means we must come up with the goods he said the Boxcar must be sealed every box must be in tightly fifteen right it can't rattle or shake win-win-win-win-win been going through troubles it must be solid that's how those virtues must live within us it must be a solid one spirit displaying seven attributes eight with with divine love the rainbow not worn on the outside like Joseph but worn on the inside it's an inside garment because this common here will die this is what we call the body of death hallelujah Paul said who shall deliver me from this body of death my rock my revelation hallelujah and that's when he took Mary and Martha it meant to the tomb of Lazarus he said I want you to know something me about Bob me Mary and Martha I'm not just a prophet hallelujah but I will give you another step I am the resurrection hallelujah he was teaching them they'd seen him do a lot of miracles they've seen him raised the day they've seen him open the eyes of the blind but now he was teaching them something else I am not just that I'm more than that when I told you though a man be dead he shall live again that's what I'm saying if you believe in me don't you be dead you'll live again ha I am the resurrection in other words I am the power that quickens the dead hallelujah the Lord will always fight our battles that rock that revelation you understand me I love the Lord so much you know why because he allowed himself to be separated from his creator for a moment time he was left alone as a sinner like you and I I would have been left alone had not we had a redeemer but he knew that what sin did was separate us from God himself so he became sin therefore he had to be separated brother Aaron said he had never been separated from God or the Jehovah God before but he with the cavalry as a man and there on the cross he said my God my God why is thou forsaken me why did he do that he did that so when he would overcome he can say and and they could come to pass I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you in all your dark hours I will always be there when you come to death and though you may look like a sinner it's the truth Paul said this body it dies it comes incorruptible but it leaves out incorruptible hallelujah we we come in model but we leave out immortality huh amore excuse me and then you say well what do you say that is a revelation that is a rock and you never you gotta have this revelation what you're saying Brigham's you've got to know that you know that you know that you know that you came from God and you go back to God you got to know that you are the seed of God in this day and hour you came faced death with the hope you must face death with faith the Bible said they all died in faith and when they died and they guess what when Jesus rose again they rose with him Wow because they died in faith they died with that revelation even though I had to accomplish everything I want to accomplish I did not come to the place I want to come but I traveled by faith I journeyed in faith they all died in faith what is faith revelation that only God can give you is that right Joseph died in faith he said I'm dying over here needs you but don't leave my bones here take me to the place I know the resurrect are will come to resurrect hallelujah take me to that place where the resurrection is going to happen don't eat me over here in Egypt hallelujah think about it four hundred and something years or however long it was later amen they win and they believe Joseph report they pack his bones with them when they left out of Egypt hallelujah y'all love that think about it it's a revelation of who Christ is to you when you can see these things no man's Dogma or doctrine can be feature hallelujah because you know you're not saved by doctrine you saved by grace hallelujah anyhow what you do for Christ is what Christ has done for you the reason why we live holy the reason why we live righteous is because we want to show him our gratitude for what he's done for us is that right the Bob said all men have sinned and come short of the glory of God hallelujah I don't know about you but I want to love him so much I want to love him so much I can't explain what I'm trying to say but I want the love of God in me so much that when he looks at me he smiles yeah that's what am i you know it's like God thinking the message he longed for the RAM said this young boy his daddy it died and all he had was this big brother one day he asked his brother about Daddy do you know much about daddy well yeah well he was he was just kind of man he was nice it's good to mama he was good to this that's there he said but that's all you know he said well they tell me I got his mannerism I kind of act like him and and I look just like him did yeah that's what I want to know he said so when I see you I see my daddy see and that's what God wants with so that people that's what I'm saying how many people you know that are trying to press so into the image of God that when people see you they see Jesus see this is the message that's what they brother branham different because he wasn't gonna shadow a man for the mark of the beast he wasn't gonna settle for system he broke he went beyond the cap he wanted to look like him talk like him act like him everything he could be he wanted to be just like Jesus he knew himself he wasn't Jesus but he wanted to be just like him he want to be a carrier of him think about it I don't know how that donkey felt brother that carried Jesus for that distance into the gates of Jerusalem but he must have felt pretty good you know we go meet him right we don't see that donkey kick hallelujah he had to feel pretty good here was a master of the universe the Great Creator and then the all is alright know me the poor little donkey ha ha yeah chosen by God is that right he was so chosen God had him tired up in a certain place and that's how it is with God when God choose you he tie you up he puts you in a certain place you can't get away when he's ready to ride you he's ready to ride you hmm you look at things and we look at things and we fail to see that this one revelation is the thing that defeats the devil you don't need the whole book though the whole book is good y'all understand what I'm saying but let me make myself clear you may not come even out her brother BAM said I may he may not understand everything in the book he said but I know the author you may not understand everything but you know the after that's your rock that's your revelation and doing the devil knows when you know that you know who Jesus is when you understand Jesus is not a secondary God he doesn't take second place to not matter of fact she said if there'd be another God I don't know him you understand me so when death comes on your door he just can't come knocking down your door and take you you have a right to ask him did Jesus send you any sickness or whatever that comes across your path you have a right to kick him out you have a right to make the lead except you get a word from God Jesus himself could have got out of the crucifixion we didn't know they did God left it up to him did y'all know that it was left up to him he had to make a choice on whether he would go to Calvary or not and he had a battle with the devil the devil no doubt perhaps put all kinds of thoughts in his head and you know probably tried to overcome with fear buddy and didn't understand that was love in that body yeah amen love repels fear fear would come will come but love repairs fear there was Jesus as a man brother branham said when he when he got to that place the Holy Spirit left him he went down into the Garden of Gethsemane and he's asking his fellow man come pray with me in our rock kneeling on a rock praying on a rock you what's your time I see Jesus knew who his father was he knew his father and who we laid on that rocky is that right you lay on the rock of the rock will crush you you fall on the rock of the rock will crush you he fell on that rocket is his father I would that this cup pass from me but this is the part I like nevertheless not my will but thine be done are you talking about Brotherhood your sacrifice we don't give enough credit to our sacrifice not him that willeth know he that running but God that shows mercy hallelujah we don't give enough credit to our sacrifice you shall have power after which the Holy Ghost is come upon you that's how you live when the power of the rock is living in you the revelation of the rock come from somebody if you can just get what I'm saying here tonight it will make you a different man a different woman when you realize that the very creator of all things is the revelation of Jesus Christ living in you if I've said the demons shake and tremble at the name of Jesus sometimes we just hope to make him shake and tremble just to do it I'm saying Jesus make him shake call on the name of Jesus he hates that because he knows that name has defeated him every time hallelujah at the name of Jesus that right it will defeat every time when you in pain call on the name of Jesus oh mercy Jesus cheated that's all you can say Jesus Jesus Jesus hallelujah stir truth I remember when I first got saved in the enemy me to go out and do some winter things and I could feel that anointing all over me and I'm like Lord you have sanctified me and I do not want to go back hallelujah you know what I did I said Jesus Jesus Jesus that's one thing about the Pentecostal church they're they teach you how to call on Jesus message people need some Pentecostal apostolic or something in when you're in desperation you call him we had that man that man last night he is inspired by oh but I can feel the fear mounting up on the people you know what they were thinking this BAM I come here with a gun some people they were thinking that I caught the thought and I said you know that's a shame hallelujah that we would fear even when I sang this up I sang the next song everybody had to tone it down a little bit because that fear entered into the service and people captured it and now they were afraid come on so what it's a great testimony if he come as a boom boom boom what you afraid of you can't die and I guarantee you he wants you to translate it into the next Kingdom you goes oh ha ha what was I waiting on yeah why do we do what we do when you don't fear death he can't take you and brother who said that death is what hearing that but a little horsing but he's asleep he's your flunky he's the one that you ride all the guid where you go to your next station but you don't ever feel the enemy I don't care what it is you don't fear him because you realize by your revelation greater is He that is in us than he does in the world I don't care what listen I when I got sick that time with all that pain because of that eye situation and the pain was so excruciating and everything else and I thought to myself Oh God I didn't know how to act I didn't know what to say you look like I got frustrated in my fresh and anger angry and I don't know whether oh spend those kind of unknown things were right but they were there you know Nemean but who was out gonna get angry at all I wanted was the pain to stop you understand me and then when I thought about Jesus I thought about Calvary I said Oh Lord you sent me through this just to learn this lesson if that's what it is is okay with me because I've from that moment on I have loved my god more to know that he could I've stopped the pain he could have said it's enough but you know what at times when he looked like he was gonna be defeated he pushed himself up for more pain because he realized that the pain that he was being inflicted on him was what B was deserving hallelujah the Bible said that God has not dealt with us according to our sins thank God for Calvary thank God for the rock thank God for the revelation of Jesus Christ that His grace and His mercy endureth forever hallelujah and His mercies amen I renewed and this is what I get I can hardly stand it when we allow Satan to make us think we're suffering because of some evil deed you either justified or you're not brother branham said when you're justified as though you never sinned in the first place that's the way God does it when you when you're suffering you're going through lessons hallelujah and God is trying to get something out of you that's in you because you said father I want to just like you hallelujah God is not a woman Peter he doesn't beat his wife for pleasure but you know what he does he corrects her because he loves her thank God for the correction thank God that's why it says in everything give thanks how many I'll believe that all things work together I believe that with all of my heart that's my rock that's my revelation I don't care whether it's naturally financially whatever and spiritually I'm going through this and it's gonna work toward my good something God is doing even though I don't understand that it's gonna work for my god and guess what the Bible said when you're tried in the fire you'll come out like pure gold hey that's what I'm saying I'm gold now I may not look like it from here but gold tried in the fire I heard this message I received this message and so the message has identified all of us as gold go try it in the fire come on I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna purify you I'm gonna bring the fire hallelujah but at the end of it all I'll be able to see my image in you that's what I'm saying thank God for the gold haha thanks God for the fire everything I go through I'm gonna take him I'm gonna praise him hallelujah um listen you love the Lord we're not here to kill to be just anything I might read a quote coming from Christianity versus idolatry here the Prophet God says we are made partakers of his holiness we're in his image we are living images of the Living God and you know i I've always thought now was the bride of Jesus Christ 61 moving up to her perfection but brother Branham is not saying we're going to be he says we are he's using the present tense the way God would speak you understand me he's not looking at your Falls he's not looking at your heirs because whom he justified he is also glorified so he's looking at the glorified state of the bride of Jesus Christ and telling her listen in your glorified state this is who you are and so therefore you must be as you are now right be this now listen we are made partakers of his holiness we in His image we are living images of the Living God then dare to self raised with him now listen listen to this his word made flesh again in us look what it is not the mystical imaginary God sitting out there but the Living God what is the Living God the world in you making itself real don't tell me these signs shall follow them that believe your signs are not following you signs are following they'll believe oh hello the word living in you that means you move from justification to sanctification to the baptism of Holy Ghost to the sealing of God himself in other words to the very full image of God in you is that right brother Balaam said all that was in God he poured it into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured it into his church every one of the virtues you see that's what may make us different hallelujah Ephesus had faith Smyrna virtue it went that way but in this day we have them all faith virtue knowledge temperance patient godliness brotherly kindness all the way up we must be what the fullness and Paul Saturdays like this they cannot be complete without us the very capstone of God is in the pride of Jesus Christ you say well that's what brother Berman said he said the voice of the resurrection is in the bride what is the voice of the resurrection Jesus Christ hallelujah here a choked voice it's the voice in you Jesus Christ himself mmm this okay but all brother do you see it triumph over every denomination triumph over all paganism a living God made manifest in a living temple and the Word of God which is God is made flesh in you why you're seated in heavenly places triumphed over all things in Christ Jesus amen not tomorrow now and you must be that's your revelation that's your revelation hmm the same powerful God is a humble God clothed in humility hallelujah is that right the same Jesus Christ one day became a foot washed flunky oh come on somebody yes what he did he humbled himself and washed his disciples feet let me tell you something that was more than symbolism it was reality because Jesus told Peter if you don't come to this level you won't make it if you and I can't wash our brother's feet forgive them of their sins their fears their shortcomings and we can't do that don't you even expect that you're getting to heaven that way you can't forgive your brothers neither can God forgive you hallelujah what stop healings unforgiveness what stopped the resurrection I'm from give this what stop your growth in god unforgiveness when you can't forgive God cannot mature you that's that little devil sitting right there will stunt your growth every time but when you find yourself in a situation you cannot forgive that's when you go to the rock oh I run through the rock of my salvation that's what the song says that revelation to know that His mercy endureth forever see this old Bible is so dark and I said it's juicy it's full of stuff it's wonderful stuff don't tell me it can't be juicy God said go over there and bring me some of them giant grapes they would you see hallelujah in man David said he's like honey in the honeycomb it's sweet this message is sweet I don't understand it what people are getting bored with it can I can I move on this resurrection guarantees their true believer a resurrection hmm you say what do you mean I got the scripture 2nd Kings here was naming a Gentile a leopard and what is leprosy it's a type of sin and he was a well respected man but he met a prophet by the name of Elijah not alike job he likes y'all and he like shock represents the bride of Jesus Christ and Elijah says navin in order to be cured you must dip seven times in the Jordan and nemesis wait a minute out of all the rivers in this country you want me to go down there and drop you no dip you want me to go underneath that I can't even see my feet it's gross you could have let me go in India born on the inner and the fire power and you know the rivers of Damascus and you know that all got better waters in this hallelujah but you ain't a leopard for nothing hello you got to die and I want to show you by the way of the Jordan how muddy and nasty you have been somebody see you see what I'm saying when you die when you buried in this water you go dip seven times and I didn't say five I didn't say I didn't even say four I said you got to dip seven times see that's what I understand what people don't understand in order to see the resurrection come to life in your life you got to follow these steps hello faith virtue knowledge you got a deal you got a humble yourself because each one of these victories come by use of rendering and being humble oh I'm gonna tell you the one that the devil works on most of the time it's temperance now let's take something to Humble the temperance come on somebody and somebody just got on your nerve as we say right you can't know you just broke it just by the raising of your voice when you know you you got every reason to get mad every reason to be upset and that sweet Holy Ghost is saying peace o your peace sometimes I think you need to stop preaching to yourself peace be still peace be still hey is that right when that old she began to reel in drop that old atmosphere and everything when you begin to reel and lock you need to speak to it and said peace be still that's what people need to do see we fail to see by our revelation of who Jesus is we know who we are we are little create us we are messiahs and God is looking for himself to be on this plane come on when I see the token what is the token Jesus Christ on this plane now you it's the light of the blood on this play that's my revelation that's my rock hallelujah he's my shield he's my buckler he's my shelter he's like that's what David was trying to say he's my all true is true naman you got a deal that little girl said now wait a minute now I might be speaking out of turn I don't know how she said it but she then now master if they do ask you to do something great and grand dude that would have gotten some attention from the people you would have done it why not do this hmmmm that's why a lot of time people didn't get their hearts to the Lord him to the churches fool they want everybody to see them come down the altar down to the altar you'll be amazed how people think when listen if anybody ever come to the altar time I giving their lives to Christ and you want people to see it you missed it you missed it it's not about the people around you it's between you and God illusia is that Alright I'm gonna worship God look what brother Branham says in the message ordination see I'm gonna tell you when the Bible says and all things give thanks when you can do that you've grown spiritually grown you come to a level and a place in your life amen and that that amateur Christian comes to because I'm mature Christian can say thank you Jesus no matter what the pain is even when people don't understand that the true Christian you say hallelujah thank you Jesus you understand me brother mem says in order ordination is I think our expressions that we should constantly long to be in worship anywhere to worship the Lord when we come together to worship Him worship him at home worship him while we're driving our cars worship wherever we are worship the Lord just pray is that right the Bible says let everything that has breath praise the Lord and then he says praise ye the Lord that you got practice and praise ye the Lord you got a right to praise him even if you haven't got any breath see praise everything that has breath praise the Lord him and he says praise ye the Lord and see that's what people don't understand God loves praise you want God to come on the scene praise Him the Bible said he inhabits the praise of his people that's my rock that's my revelation that when I praise Him is that right brother man said the more you call him his name the closer he comes the nearer he be and not that's what I'm saying he's not in heaven he he's here he's in US ninety even in your mouth hallelujah that's the problem we've got too many feelings floating it ain't about your feelings it's about the word brother Branham says Amen here in the message Shalom he said a director always point you to the word the prophets of old pointed to the word they was the word they lived the word and what did they do it manifested God see so to say I'm the word and you don't live it there won't be a manifestation you got to live the word in order for there to be a manifestation hmm so don't blame God for the failures oh I prayed in Jesus name and ain't nothing happened well you're already living it the token the life of Christ must be applied it meant to every situation and all things acknowledge him and he shall direct your path hallelujah they was the word they lived the word and what did it do it manifested God that brought the written word for that day to life they lived it you understand me they were obedient if you want to say it like that because it come to them and it was revealed to them see when that word is revealed to you no body can take it from you Alleluia amen who gonna tell you heaven others it doesn't exist it's revealed you've not bid me you don't remember it if you did had been true it's by faith you even believe heaven exists if except for a few who's gone and come back is that right brother Branham you didn't even know what it was all about he said you know I he said that not that I I was afraid of death he said I I wasn't afraid to die he said I didn't want to become what I thought it would be he said I thought it was gonna be a little cloud some sort up there you know no body shape or anything said hey how you doing brother man and he couldn't shake his hand or anything like that but when he went over there across the curtain of time he said that were millions I shook their hands I hugged him hallelujah it's real he said whatever you do don't miss it hallelujah but I believe with all my heart Amen brother Branham went cross the curtain of time and God gave him the report to come back like that like those those prophets Joshua and Caleb came back in and said the land is good there's some good grapes over there amen he went over there to show us it's good everything that Jesus Christ died for it's over there I seen it with my own eyes I saw a woman who was in 90s how to do it when she got saved and she was like 27 years old beautiful one of the most beautiful women there she's there I've seen her there think about it when he told brother never I saw you there hallelujah Ted McKinney who I pastored before he died pastor netiquette McKinney there who was a deacon in banham Tabernacle brother Branham told him that he saw him over there hmm and the man was still living think about it and this man when he was passing on and I was gone to pray for him you know what he was calling me brother Branham I don't know what he was looking at but I felt so good hallelujah amen because I want you to understand Amen day is a real land there brother Ned gone over now somebody help me oh I couldn't hear I can't hold a candle to the prophet of God but I thank God that God sent him flushin flesh and blood never revealed it to you but my father which is in heaven you talk about deep this is what I'm saying everybody you know what I'm I'm not cutting down the D what I'm trying to say is what good is it gonna do you if people are so deep they don't even know how to worship mmm they can't even say thank you Jesus the Word of God is coming and people don't know how to even respond to the word you understand me how can the word be your husband and he's wooing and flirting with you and you won't move you won't respond to his kisses or however in the natural I could relate this to you that when that word of God is coming in God is preaching and he's throwing out his love kisses to you and you sit there like your dead corpse or something something's wrong when a woman loves a man and really loves that man and he maybe he don't even know it when he speaks to her she blushes he did giddy right true she just don't know what to do with myself I'm teaching y'all young boy something watch the body language that's how you know oh my god it's the truth and that's what I do when I'm preaching the word I watch the body language he says helpless Lord what is it he is the word and in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word is still God just he the same today manifests himself as he was Moses and Elijah and down in Jesus just you understand me we can live oh look what God did in Moses look what he did in Elijah the question is what is he doing in you what is God doing in you your rock your revelation and I'm gonna tell you something you cannot live like brother and say you can't live no higher than your revelation if he ain't all in all to you he in your revelation is he's all and in all it's gonna come testing time and you're gonna fail hmm oh he's my deliverer okay testing time coming he's my comfort oh okay testing time coming he's my best friend okay testing time coming that revelation must be proven and when the devil come with you to you and make you think you all by yourself you ought to put that revelation at this rate you did de spectable deceived enemy he'll never leave me no will he forsake me look at this he'll never leave me why he knows what it feels like to be alone he was lonely back there he was lonely on the cross but he says never when I leave you alone in st. John 17 he says father I ask of you one thing that they be with me then ask for riches he wanted his redeemed he wanted his bride to be wherever he was hallelujah never again will we'll leave his side hallelujah we'll always be with him y'all love the Lord my rock always hears me he can hear prayers he may be a rock but he has either see here hallelujah is that right remember you know Jacob he layed on that rock he went to sleep on that rock and all of a sudden he saw a vision staircase come on leading up to heaven what did he see hallelujah angels descending and ascending that's angel that same God that gave Jacob that revelation told his disciples if you believe what I just said you'll see angels ascending and descending who was it the same God that met Jacob is now leaning his disciple and telling them the same thing hallelujah have you seen it I've seen that by faith I've seen I've seen them come and go hallelujah what are you talking about yeah Paul has come and go don't all the angels they've come and go I've seen him he said and I've seen him us in you say well how come you say they're decent because before they came here there were somewhere else and I can tell you where they were the Bible said they were in the head the stars of God was in his hand whenever his hand is wherever it is that's where they were and that's where they went back to seven stars in his right hand come on whoo but where were you brother books I'll tell you where I was I was in the cleft of the rock I didn't know it at one time brother hitch but when they pierced him inside that was a clef that's what David said Lord hide me in the class of the rock hardly in the womb of Christ where the blood was shed I'd be there give me the revelation that I came from him and I'll go back to him I'm almost done because I'm gonna tell you something we'd better understand what I'm trying to say when everything comes down go go listen to the message Shalom 1964 brother Baron say something's coming and he's telling us it's going to be rough he said that's the reason why I'm telling you alone because peace that mean peace to you because it's coming and you're gonna have to have some substance you gonna have to have something that's gonna be able to endure the storm that's coming he said it's gonna get so table it'll be just like that little girl he meant in the darkness got so dark she starts screaming and her little boy said don't worry little sister there's a man here who can turn on the light see he said listen listen what we don't understand when the scripture says in our patience possess he household that's exactly what's going to happen because when that Council of Churches begin to move and I'm gonna tell you something everybody look at that Trump and all the things that's going on let me tell you something you know why all of the staging is being made brother Brennan said is to come against the bride she's not even in the picture right now but in the mind of these demons she's in the picture they going around all about this here to put laws and everything in place so they can come after us you can believe it or not but it's coming he said you watch the history watch what God did throughout the age everything he said the same thing the devil did to Israel and what happened they trusted in their church instead of the voice because the voice told him when you see these city encamped about with soldier get up out of here but you know oh I'm in the message we gonna hide in the church and they die in the church you understand me escape down how do you escape make sure you in Christ this is the time amen like the brother saying don't be foolish yeah you're either wise on your foolish but the wise version had all and extra and how did you get that I had a prayer life I kept crying out to God even now the Bible says in Brisbane tells us and then those who sigh and cry for the abominations done in the city y'all think you're talking about are you out now in the church you are a city that sits upon a hill you're the city the prophet of God said God didn't come to shake the world this message didn't come to shake the world he said he said this message came to shake the church I'm not telling people they're not saying but you got to know what you possess him this message came us came to do what feel us with the divine nature of God don't you sell it for nothing less Paul said I Buffett my body every day I put it under subjection every day my body your body everybody's body is against the Word of God this flesh is the enemy that you have to fight every day I tell people if I didn't have this flesh I'll be perfect because of the inner man it's the flesh that brings me trouble every day it's the flesh that will allow the flesh and lust of the eye it's the flesh that want to lift itself up hallelujah but that intimate said homeboy is a new one here and I'm the man in control now see that's the inner man must come to a place it controls the body not that the body controls you you is that right I think I who was I talking to possess in the land you got to possess it but the key you got to possess the land you got to do the land in my last statement thought remember I said this the other night there is a replenishing I didn't finish it because Adam Commission was to multiply and replenish the earth and he failed because of sin but the second Adam his generation would be spiritual a quickening generation Oh God have mercy so you got to understand why a rapture must take place there must be a coming of a grand people see because what we fail to see is that we would have come into this world by spoken word and it would not have been babies babies came by the fall hello come on the creation when God created Adam and Eve he did not create them babies they were grown spoken word was not going while you think won't be no babies when you get there hello why won't babies be over there why when babies die and they go behind the curtain of time they're not 21 in 19 or whatever because that was the original plan and when god replenish the earth he's got to get rid of all the contamination that the first atom brought by way of seeing then God brings back the real sons of God when all evil is done away with they'll never ever ever again will be another tree of knowledge of good and evil ever it'll be the Tree of Life you said what do you mean look in the book of Genesis all you see is that real life you do not see the tree of knowledge good and evil it's not bad it was only placed in the Garden of Eden to serve God's purpose once the purpose is served God can now come back and replenish the earth because his word can't not come back on that right if Adam had stayed true he would have produced Jesus see y'all don't know that but it's true because he would have been see oh is that right brother Baron said all the seeds of adam's that's why he had to be a virgin because if Eve had remained a virgin if she had remained a virgin all the seeds that was in the first Adam would have come forth hello God had the job that's right because what happened when God when the devil allowed able to be killed guess work for the man said it was like a resurrection when he brought forth Seth but still self could not produce the Christ hello Mary couldn't produce the Christ Joseph couldn't produce the Christ only God could produce the Christ he needed a virgin and he needed none of Mary genes or none of Adam's genes he had to come by way of creation and guess what the very voice of God had to create the egg and the seed in their spoken word okay yes sir you love the Lord that's how God gonna replenish he replenish the redeemed that means you was here before him he replenished the world with redeem seed somebody ought to shout let's stay in joint Jesus I am enjoying Jesus you know I look and i'ma tell you something how can I say this I'm marvel and I'm sure I have gone haven't going through some storm maybe you may have gone through worse trials and storms that I have but I'm gonna tell you something God has done a perfect job with me oh we couldn't have done no better and I'm still not what I will be father does not yet appear what we shall be but when he shall appear we'll be like it just like it don't you want to be just like him I'm so glad it's not in my hands I'm so glad that that that God predestinated me I don't know how to explain it he never made me do anything it was by my choice but I thank God I don't know all I know is that I love holiness and I love righteousness and I love when I read this Bible I read it and and I just love it it's the stories and the things in here they never get dead and boring they always live I look at characters in this Bible and I think oh I just wish I could be just like them but the man that I want to be like most of all is Jesus himself because Joshua was just a piece of him Moses was just a piece of him David was a piece of him but Jesus Christ was all of him and to think that we've got him inside of us moving and growing and maturing amen into this Christ I am so excited it's like a a woman who's pregnant right she doesn't had that baby for about three months all of a sudden he started kicking she get excited come feel come on and feel it you gotta hear you gotta feel him kicking every now and again now the only girls moving in you it has to move in you for you to feel it for you to know he's living you got to see some shine he's living you can't be like Elizabeth I've been pregnant so long and he said made a move no sod that's not good you need to call in the name of Jesus the Bible said at the name of Jesus amen John came to life I tell you what maybe I'm a crazy man but one thing I know is that what I'm seeing and I'll say this and you don't have to believe it but I was in prayer right here in church by myself I can't even remember what I was praying but I was just praying praying just praying sighing and crying I do know that not just for myself but for others and all of a sudden I saw all of these people I didn't see the it was they were just standing like they was waiting for something we tell you it's more to this message than what people think all I could scream at it was that I see him oh I see they waiting one word from him and it'll be all over that was just something he gave me I know that we don't we're not far and you don't understand but I said like this I just want to hear him say well done we get tired we get weary but just like Jesus the Bible said that Jesus was acquainted with grief hard disappointments heartbreaks it comes with the package but it's okay when you know who you are Oh God trying to get the people to see and God sent a man all the way from Ohio tell us that we need to be more determined to produce Christ in us I am able to lose all my friends whatever this one boy who is determined to make a rapture I came to this message because in 1977 I saw what I call UFOs and I remember screaming right in the middle of the street lord whatever you do don't let me miss the rapture at that time I knew nothing about this message it's just so many little places God had stopped me and made me pay attention to things and I know it's because of Who I am I didn't make me who I am he made me who I am I've tried to tell people even in my earlier stage of ministry what you see things and and I told the Lord I says lord I want to produce what your message say I'm supposed to reduce I don't care about all these other teachers that have come and gone and make every for you justified as though you've never sinned in the first place and don't tell the people they still got to clean up their lives you've gotta have a clean life you gotta have a clean life God will see action what's it used to buying bleach if it can't wash or clean right why does the blood is a bleach you mean to tell me the bleach of Christ the blood of Christ came wash away all your sins no it washes everything he gets a rake get rid of every stain everything I trust in the blood of Jesus cuz that's all I have Oh Lord I know I'm a crybaby I can't help it every time I think about how good he's been to me and just to see how things are maybe I'm not explaining it like everybody else can explain it but I do know one thing God didn't drop the divine nature in our list and I'll out for us to sit there and watching it observe it break it down and dissect it no he wants to see it live the purpose of the blood of Jesus Christ is to see it live right hallelujah when Abel died that layer gave him a right after death to speak the Bible said the blood of Abel spoke still living and the blood of Jesus Christ was greater than in Abel must still speak through human vessels it must prove it's ears the blood it lives through us that's the way he chose it to be that's one thing I love about God you know we need predestinated us what he brought us to this place and I'm almost done good or evil he came and he suffered at all he made a right he's a just God and he gives everybody the right to choose whatever way they want to go he can't help he's God he's God and he knows everything he understands everything but one thing I know there'll never be an excuse because God has given us everything if every man in this world he has given us all we need like Jesse said whosoever will let him come he's given us everything we need to make heaven with most of all he's given us his life and brother brought him in this closing statement said he's more willing to give us a Holy Ghost then we desire to have can you sing that song for me brother I like it but I don't know yes sir [Music] yes it that's right I'm amazed [Music] oh I stay away can you
