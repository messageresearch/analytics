[24:54] place Lord
[24:55] is anyone here that doesn't know you
[24:58] father you would reveal yourself
[25:00] Lord you'd make your word clear north as
[25:03] we preach Lord and as to hear us here
[25:06] you bring understanding in the name of
[25:08] Jesus Christ
[25:09] the father there's no God like you no
[25:13] other God ever went in the grave and
[25:15] rose again and father with celebration
[25:18] celebrating the resurrection every day
[25:20] of our lives Lord and we pray father you
[25:23] will forgive us our trespasses lord
[25:26] areas in our life Lord that no one else
[25:28] sees but you keep us under your atoning
[25:31] blood and all gotta let your word go
[25:33] forth today empowering and demonstration
[25:35] in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ we
[25:38] pray that church say Amen amen you have
[25:42] your Bibles let's turn to Genesis the
[25:44] fifteenth chapter Genesis 15
[25:56] Genesis 15 I want to start reading at
[26:03] verse 1 and then we're gonna go to
[26:14] Hebrews the sixth chapter Genesis 15 and
[26:20] 1 if you have a say man
[26:22] the Bible says after these themes the
[26:25] word of the Lord the word of the Lord
[26:29] came unto Abram in a vision saying fear
[26:31] not Abram I am thy shield and thy
[26:36] exceeding great reward and Abram said
[26:40] Lord God what will thou give me seeing I
[26:43] go childless and the steward of my house
[26:49] is this Eliezer of Damascus and Abram
[26:53] said Behold to me thou has given no seed
[26:58] and lo one born in my house is my hair
[27:03] and behold the word of the Lord came
[27:07] unto him saying this shall not be thine
[27:10] hair but he that shall come forth out of
[27:14] thine own bowels shall be thine heir
[27:18] amen let's go to Hebrews 6 chapter
[27:35] Hebrews six and I want to start at verse
[27:42] 13 Hebrews 6 and 13 the Bible says
[27:49] fooling God may promise to Abraham
[27:52] because he could swear by no greater he
[27:55] swear by himself saying surely blessing
[27:58] I will bless thee and multiplying I will
[28:00] multiply thee and so after he had
[28:03] patiently endured he obtained the
[28:06] promise for me and verily swear by the
[28:09] greater and an oath for confirmation is
[28:14] to them the end of all strife wherein
[28:18] God willing more abundantly to show unto
[28:21] the heirs of promise the immutability of
[28:25] his counsel confirmed it by an oath that
[28:28] by two immutable things in which it was
[28:32] impossible that God impossible for God
[28:34] to lie we might have a strong
[28:37] consolation who have fled for refuge to
[28:42] lay hold upon the hope set before us and
[28:46] maybe the Lord bless reading of his word
[28:48] you can have your seats amen and as you
[28:56] see it I want to turn over to Matthew
[28:58] the 13th chapter and I want to read a
[29:04] couple verses out of there Matthew 13 if
[29:10] I can start at verse 10 saying the
[29:16] disciples came and said unto Him why
[29:18] speakest thou unto them in parables he
[29:20] answered and said unto them because it
[29:23] is given unto you to know the mysteries
[29:25] of the kingdom of heaven but to them it
[29:28] is not given for whosoever hath have to
[29:32] a barbarous program for whosoever hath
[29:36] to him shall be given into him shall not
[29:41] shall have more abundance but whosoever
[29:43] hath not from him shall be taken away
[29:45] even that he has therefore speak I to
[29:49] them in parables because they seeing see
[29:52] not and hearing they hear not neither do
[29:56] they understand and in them is fulfilled
[29:59] the prophecy of Isaiah which saith by
[30:02] hearing ye shall hear and shall not
[30:05] understand and seeing you shall see and
[30:07] shall not perceive for this people heart
[30:10] is waxed gross and their ears are dull
[30:13] of hearing in their eyes they have
[30:15] closed lest at any time they shall see
[30:19] with their eyes and hear with their ears
[30:21] and she'll understand with their heart
[30:24] and should be converted and I should
[30:26] heal them amen
[30:28] you know Church I want to preach today
[30:30] by the grace of God on a subject the
[30:34] heritage of faith you know the heritage
[30:37] of faith when you think of a heritage
[30:40] you think of something that's passed
[30:42] down from generation to generation and
[30:44] normally that's how God works God has
[30:48] been passing down his word from
[30:50] generation to generation you know it a
[30:53] marvel act you know the Bible that the
[30:56] disciples they were listening to Jesus
[30:59] and while Jesus was talking to you know
[31:02] the Sadducees and Pharisees and
[31:04] different ones they could understand
[31:07] what God was saying but the people he
[31:09] was speaking to he was speaking to them
[31:11] in parables and they asked the question
[31:13] they said why do you speak to them in
[31:15] parables and Jesus was simply saying you
[31:18] know it is given to you to understand
[31:20] he's inherited an ear to hear that God
[31:24] is saying he was saying that these
[31:26] people can hear me preach and they don't
[31:29] understand nothing they can look at the
[31:31] Word of God and they have no
[31:33] understanding he said but as for you
[31:35] it's been passed down as for you you
[31:39] were born with the gift to understand
[31:41] God Hey and sometimes church you know we
[31:45] run their words God doing sometimes we
[31:47] just need to step back and let God work
[31:50] oh yeah because the Bible says hiya that
[31:53] I cannot hold it he cannot change his
[31:57] ways he cannot fall back
[31:59] whatever God said it had to come to pass
[32:02] you know it looks in the scriptures like
[32:04] sometimes God is wavering you know God
[32:07] told Adam and Eve the day you tempted
[32:10] them for being food you don't die and it
[32:14] look like it didn't happen but they
[32:16] didn't hire you our bodies are suffering
[32:19] from what Adam and Eve did in the
[32:21] beginning honey
[32:22] we are experiencing a natural death
[32:25] because of what they did
[32:26] showing that God word will come to pass
[32:30] but you know when I look at the word
[32:32] heritage I look at something being
[32:34] passed down you know I'm from the south
[32:37] and then and you know if this real
[32:41] touchy in the south there's something we
[32:44] have and I hope I don't mean to put you
[32:46] on the edge of your seats but in the
[32:48] south we have something called racism
[32:51] honey by the grace of God those were the
[32:55] holy days that don't bother you but you
[32:59] know our South Carolina is known for its
[33:02] heritage is known for something retired
[33:06] a conservative side but I said like this
[33:09] before they acknowledge or they may know
[33:13] that the Confederate flag was homeless
[33:15] big house we in our heritage we remember
[33:19] back reason there was up there so we may
[33:23] begin to bring it out this time to talk
[33:25] about your a meeting over there where to
[33:27] come from it didn't mean a thing to me
[33:29] because from our heritage our parents
[33:32] did not pass down on the hurt and all
[33:34] the things that took place during the
[33:36] time of a silverware or or what the flag
[33:40] meant so when they begin to fight over
[33:43] this floor then you got one group writer
[33:45] where our parents were in the world and
[33:47] you got a little room saying well our
[33:49] parents were slaves so you got one sled
[33:52] with two different meanings of hair
[33:54] Oh matters and you got you got one God
[34:00] we're all use different meanings of
[34:02] heritage holy whatever God said in his
[34:05] word is true
[34:06] hello the wages of sin is death
[34:10] oh yeah he said you don't reap what you
[34:12] sow hey man
[34:13] and if you so give me good the Bible
[34:17] says hungry then a good team came brave
[34:20] for evil fruit and a bad tree came rain
[34:23] from good food amen
[34:25] that's God's Word it's in your seed
[34:28] that's most pass down hey
[34:31] and you know as I look and I begin to
[34:32] think you know just in our own state you
[34:36] know racism is like you know what I
[34:38] don't believe nobody's racism here I'm
[34:40] just making a point
[34:42] racism is something that's passed down
[34:45] it has to be talked you know it has to
[34:49] be given to a child or to a person from
[34:53] somebody else's understanding but really
[34:56] I love about God whenever we learn about
[34:58] God God wants us to personally know
[35:02] ourself he wants us to personally
[35:05] understand him now even ever mama a
[35:08] daddy passed down their knowledge of
[35:11] Christ but you have to get to a place
[35:13] where you know Christ for yourself
[35:16] oh yeah we're not I'm not gonna make it
[35:18] a heaven on the merits of my parents
[35:21] God is gonna ask me what have I go with
[35:25] this Christ heritage and when I looked
[35:31] at whenever you look at our state and
[35:34] they begin to boycott because they
[35:36] looked at the flagon what the Frog meant
[35:38] all the hatred and all these things and
[35:41] I thank God for the way I was raised I
[35:45] wasn't raised with my parents passing
[35:48] down the knowledge of slavery or the
[35:50] knowledge of all the things that happen
[35:52] in all the generations before me what
[35:55] they taught me was you can be anything
[35:57] you wanna be
[35:59] hallelujah shishi
[36:01] they think they tap into a heritage that
[36:04] was fruitful amen
[36:05] they tap into a hare
[36:07] there can be all things in Christ you
[36:09] didn't tell me you know what the one
[36:12] thing I don't identify with as a black
[36:14] man I don't identify what people say
[36:16] we're still in the struggle hey I gotta
[36:21] go
[36:22] God is on my side I wanna deal with the
[36:26] struggle at all with the struggle of the
[36:28] 19 bills in the nineteen that I'm in the
[36:31] year the TV and you know oh yeah
[36:37] when you think like that you're not
[36:39] you're not looked upon good holier
[36:42] because the man said is in a different
[36:45] place oh yeah it's the old boy it's hard
[36:48] out here for the black man if you don't
[36:51] know God that's why I love going to the
[36:57] ranch a holy you can see a black man
[36:59] down a bit Lee huh huh hey everybody
[37:07] stay with me now I'm talking natural
[37:10] saga make a spiritual point what I'm
[37:13] saying is holy what's being passed down
[37:17] to you with a secular present-day life
[37:21] it affect the way you live you know
[37:24] affect your children honey you know
[37:26] young man can watch how his daddy treats
[37:30] his mom and he'll treat his wife the
[37:32] same way that will become a part of his
[37:34] heritage and his dad is filled with the
[37:36] Holy Ghost that young boy learned
[37:38] holiness how to love his wife he learned
[37:41] how to take care of family he learned
[37:43] how to provide that becomes his heritage
[37:46] that becomes something that's passed
[37:47] down but if his father is a deadbeat he
[37:50] got to meet God personally and that God
[37:53] teach him honey
[37:55] they can be done he can be raised in a
[37:57] fatherless home but God you still get

[38:05] day now where there are no more excuses

[38:16] because of you what you said to me what
[38:18] you did to me everybody makin excuses
[38:20] when I really want to take higher
[38:22] responsibility for the decisions we make
[38:29] cuz we can we can truly say ujin every
[38:32] one of us right now nobody else put a
[38:34] gun to our head and said I want you to
[38:36] come to church tonight we've made that
[38:41] decision so Church when we look at God I
[38:45] know how the Bible says that there is no
[38:49] greater than God no one else could do
[38:52] what needed to be done so God said I'm
[38:55] gonna swear by myself I'm gonna make
[38:58] sure Abraham you have this child I'm
[39:02] gonna make sure to see the life that
[39:05] you're deciding what you want to pass
[39:07] down I will make sure it happens by my
[39:10] oh yeah and that's the greatest thing
[39:13] about being a Christian your life does
[39:16] not belong to you your life belongs to
[39:22] come do you think me your man young man
[39:26] born in the South raised in the Sun we

[39:31] degrees up it snow everywhere
[39:35] can you walk to the car like you want to
[39:38] you got to be no church I'm here because
[39:46] of the calling of God I'm here because
[39:49] there was something passed down to me
[39:51] that I have no control of touch when I
[39:54] was born God put a gift of evangelism in
[39:57] my life
[39:58] Baga were a gift of faith in my life
[40:01] holy God put a praise
[40:03] inside of my seat doctor worshiping me
[40:05] holy God put a fight in me put something
[40:08] holy
[40:09] they said you were born a cop I didn't
[40:13] make myself that way holy that's in the
[40:18] genes in church holy we inherit death
[40:21] and all he says God is He that is in me
[40:25] then he led us in the world I didn't put
[40:28] God in me God regarding me choosing the
[40:36] life of Christ we have to take her for
[40:38] something Prosser
[40:39] oh yeah it's too many times we don't
[40:42] take God serious but just we're in a
[40:45] time when we should be expecting to see
[40:47] more of God in our lives you know and
[40:51] you know from the rails point of view
[40:55] people think they're getting away
[40:57] they think everything is alright because
[41:00] they everybody's looking at this person
[41:02] they said well and then happen to them
[41:03] yet
[41:04] and then happened to this person they
[41:06] were God cannot lie whenever he said
[41:11] he's too happy he's gonna be a
[41:14] tribulation it's gonna be a binding of
[41:17] the son he's gonna be a role is known is
[41:20] gonna be a nuclear bomb he's God happens
[41:23] hurts just like the Bible says
[41:25] just as show as we have a pump we don't
[41:27] have it come the Bible I already said
[41:31] hurry that she was priceless
[41:34] she was shipped on the heel and members
[41:36] of 666 is written in the Bible and just
[41:39] the show is I can see that I can see her
[41:41] your judgement is on the way home just a
[41:44] show
[41:45] God said in the last days honey it's
[41:48] gonna be whales and weasels are where
[41:49] they will be getting mad and giving man
[41:52] it's gonna be homosexuality times we can
[41:55] see it it's been passed down from
[41:58] generation to generation and now we had
[42:01] the part of the pinnacle with the part
[42:06] of the fool is sometimes the
[42:09] manifestation of God is here and we can
[42:12] see the devil in his fullness we ought
[42:15] to be able to see God in its full
[42:18] but speaking on the heritage I'm gonna
[42:21] be loan don't get nervous but y'all know
[42:23] I'm like a 747 I need a little room
[42:26] while I'm up there I can't just bring
[42:29] Julian I'm the helicopter I go up and
[42:30] down no I just can't go up and down I
[42:33] like the girl didn't stay up there a
[42:35] while Haley but you know church when I
[42:39] think about the heritage what we inherit
[42:42] like I was saying about racism you know
[42:44] you took her
[42:45] you took a young man or young woman that
[42:48] grew up in a Christian home the example
[42:50] is set before them you young ladies you
[42:52] want to know what kind of life you
[42:54] should live look at your Christian
[42:56] mother
[42:57] you don't mean you want to know what
[43:00] kind of life you want to live look at
[43:02] your Christian father
[43:03] that's the hatches that's being passed
[43:05] down to you but he got to accept it by
[43:08] faith faith is the heritage that we are
[43:12] receiving anything and we are the
[43:14] children of Abraham we receive holy life
[43:17] by faith hallelujah Jason when I look at
[43:21] this you're Abraham he told God he said
[43:25] Lord he said I don't have any children
[43:28] he said all I got is this Eliezer of
[43:32] Damascus in my house all I got is a
[43:34] servant to give what I got oh I got a
[43:38] remain that's not even connected to my
[43:40] bloodline to pass down all these riches
[43:43] and all his greatness he says god I want
[43:47] my own seat and then God comes back and
[43:58] sometimes you got to stir you problem is
[44:04] we have our own desires so we don't go
[44:07] to the size the size it's a lot I'm
[44:11] gonna wait do you speak to me and don't
[44:15] let nobody put you under pressure to
[44:17] move when you don't want a new honey you
[44:19] stand still and wait on God sometimes we
[44:24] too busy following one another wait oh
[44:26] god that's what I level by
[44:30] the heritage of david dave' you take
[44:34] David you take Solomon there for them
[44:36] serve the same God but but but the
[44:39] Solomon was a little bit different than
[44:42] David even though he was the same
[44:45] bloodline Solomon handle things
[44:48] different from the way David held
[44:50] Solomon he would reason Solomon had a
[44:55] thousand lives some of those can make
[44:59] one happen how you go made a thousand
[45:00] happen you got this one said I will
[45:03] agree temple the air temple some of you
[45:07] got the money I want to go on temple
[45:08] Maddie you got all them lies in you here
[45:11] and you got to make somebody happy
[45:14] and then God huh who so rich in mercy he
[45:17] told Solomon stay away from him strange
[45:19] women they go turn no heart from me huh
[45:22] God nobody talking about you tell you
[45:25] something he's talking about he wasn't
[45:32] trying to keep songs from prison when he
[45:34] returned news not song Samuel Solomon
[45:36] from prison he was trying to keep
[45:38] Solomon from his heart being touched
[45:41] from him but Solomon caught up because
[45:46] he watched a you know everything I got a
[45:49] gift for wisdom I got a gift like no
[45:52] other man I can see what other people
[45:55] can't see but he couldn't see very
[45:58] simple thing God told him stay away from
[46:00] them women God talking to somebody today
[46:06] honey
[46:07] God might be telling somebody stand away
[46:09] from that thing that you want so bad you
[46:13] think is all right though we want it so
[46:20] bad
[46:21] we like bingo one is open go to God go
[46:25] to God and prayer
[46:26] so no what should i do these cheaper
[46:29] easier God said man you can't curse was
[46:31] blessed
[46:31] what kind of company you in
[46:34] stay away from a man who people blessed
[46:36] Balaam said oh yeah okay deep let's go

[46:49] money I can buy you things you know they
[46:52] got a new Maybach coming out spin around
[46:55] in it yeah I could hook you read wound
[46:57] up so bingo he started to think about
[47:01] rubbers Devon think about Godhead
[47:04] already spoke to Gino and he think about
[47:12] reason about God is already spoke the
[47:21] problem is the Bible says honey a person
[47:25] can think that they write in a way and
[47:27] be just as long as two left shoes but
[47:32] they looking for their own self
[47:34] justification and Baylin was looking for
[47:37] his own self justification he said you
[47:39] know what I'm gonna go back to God again
[47:42] God came out and he said the people were
[47:46] blessed they were blessed I want you to
[47:50] understand this church Balaam is now
[47:53] going back to God like God started like
[47:58] God didn't like gossip we were bailiffs
[48:03] I ain't quite sure can you imagine
[48:09] speaking to God and God Himself is not
[48:12] sure do that sound like a God do you
[48:15] regard speak that's what he mean we

[50:50] truths on it haruya thick white walls he
[50:52] made some real rock rock on the back
[50:54] just
[50:55] know that role that I felt like I was an
[50:59] elevator just bad the next car hurry was
[51:04] a 69 Impala hardtop this is why you
[51:08] little man like me go cause I said
[51:10] because I'm driving the car that I'm
[51:12] driving me you know the nothing that I
[51:17] had a 79 Pontiac Bonneville a man follow
[51:20] hey man electric all the way to what a
[51:23] man just there's the steering wheel how
[51:26] you drop down and drop up oh yeah if you
[51:29] get the right one when I was worried
[51:34] those kind of people that little classic
[51:36] cars but you know God knew that was my
[51:41] joy so one day God let my joy get stolen
[51:48] one morning I woke up and my 79 was gone
[51:52] huh
[51:54] my sending now with the pretty wheels

[52:35] was hurt too bad I wasn't here you know
[52:40] sometimes things happen and you say I
[52:42] ain't gonna never let this happen again
[52:46] and a lot of times that's the wrong
[52:48] attitude because you ain't in control
[52:50] God is in control and what God was
[52:53] teaching me he was teaching me humility
[52:55] because it was all about me being seen I
[52:59] loved the heritage of glory and
[53:01] everybody checking me out when I ride
[53:03] down away but it came my name and I just
[53:08] do like this
[53:09] it can go ride self-glorification God
[53:16] say you know what this my son just my
[53:18] child but I'm gonna humble his behind
[53:20] I'm gonna humble his behind honey
[53:23] he liked to be seen so you know what
[53:25] happened my car got stolen and you know
[53:28] my dog I stole it I ain't got no car and
[53:30] the only car around that could be driven
[53:33] was a car that my brother was gonna get
[53:35] me a s10 Chevy pickup truck they had
[53:39] been hit by deer one thing you don't
[53:49] want you don't want God to have to
[53:54] Humble you he will do it but why God is
[53:59] giving you warning take the warning
[54:02] hurry stop to operate this different
[54:05] because God can bring you down so low
[54:07] make you feel like nothing but all he's
[54:11] doing this building you back up he
[54:12] building you back up right but that's
[54:14] what you had to do to me truck Church
[54:16] the trip got hit by deer the deer ran
[54:20] right into the driver side door so the
[54:23] whole day was smashed in some of the bed
[54:25] was smashed in the winner was bust out
[54:28] and this guy my my brother job was a
[54:30] tool and die maker so what he did he
[54:33] made a fiber glass window and drew a
[54:35] man's face on so for me to look out the
[54:40] door I had to open that face and look
[54:42] out the window like that he told me
[54:45] about being mean but I was God are you
[54:49] passing down his heritage of grace to me
[54:53] amen he was building me back up honey
[54:55] and one day I pull up to the light the
[54:58] stop sign and some of the guys on the
[55:00] job saw me and I heard them laughing
[55:03] from the Nick from it from I heard them
[55:05] laughing from the stop sign they were
[55:07] laughing so loud you know that made me
[55:13] do that made me fast and pray
[55:17] that made me go to God in prayer holy
[55:20] and sometimes we go through things in
[55:22] life because God is trying to get you to
[55:25] have a closer connection he's passing
[55:28] down Holly his heritage of faith things
[55:31] happen because God is trying to expose
[55:34] himself in a greater life Holly but
[55:36] sometimes because we wrote what we won't
[55:38] we misinterpret God's grace hallelujah
[55:42] you know church when I look right here I
[55:44] heard God told Abraham you're gonna have
[55:46] a son you have a child and then Sarah
[55:48] gets in the way says okay you and hey
[55:51] Tom get together cuz I'm too old we def
[55:54] just defecate him for me see she hadn't
[55:56] tapped into the heritage of face she
[55:59] hadn't tapped into it she was looking at
[56:01] our own human ability and God was not
[56:04] gonna get us by their ability it was
[56:07] gonna be by his Spirit says the whole
[56:09] holy wheel so he was trying to get them
[56:11] to move out of the way but if we look at
[56:14] this church holy if we look at the
[56:17] heaviest look at heritage look at this
[56:19] word amen heritage it means something
[56:24] that comes something that comes or
[56:27] belongs to one about reason a birth
[56:32] somebody say Amen
[56:34] test the God in you you were born with
[56:37] hallelujah
[56:39] you're born with like I said this
[56:40] morning when you were in the car you
[56:42] were born with the grace of God amen we
[56:44] are in it watch the stuff you impo to
[56:47] watch you were born with the grace of
[56:48] God that's give you his child now
[56:50] he'll hear amen the attributes of God
[56:53] they're already in us at birth sometimes
[56:59] I look at the pictures in your office
[57:01] and I look at your boss and I say
[57:02] boredom boss just like they did just
[57:05] like they did you couldn't deny that
[57:07] y'all was the last people worse you can
[57:12] you could you couldn't do like Abraham
[57:14] did he walk up there eliminate looking
[57:17] at his wife
[57:17] he's on I'm his brother I'm her brother
[57:20] you ain't ready to do that there wasn't
[57:22] no you a daddy I see you are Lyndon boys
[57:26] what happened that was the heritage of
[57:28] know Jesus honey
[57:30] hey yo geez inside them boys and whether
[57:33] they like it or not hey do but hey
[57:36] there's a pot o see inside of
[57:47] junior/senior just comes out of there
[57:52] like your daddy
[57:54] we move back your daddy you even talk
[57:56] like your daddy and then you can do
[57:59] better you inherit that huh that's my
[58:04] momma say sometimes we do stuff she say
[58:07] boy you act just like me you know we'd
[58:13] be in denial stage but it's passed down
[58:15] to you from birth that's why it's
[58:18] important to get the Holy Ghost because
[58:21] there are things in your family genes
[58:23] that will be passed down to you that you
[58:26] don't need that you don't want honey
[58:29] spiritual holy spiritual imperfections
[58:32] passed down from your God oh he told
[59:11] Abraham he said you're gonna have a seed
[59:14] but it's gonna come from your very own
[59:17] bowels hug so it's what I'm really
[59:20] saying when we think of our heritage who
[59:24] think of our lives we come from God
[59:30] this ain't just saying about the
[59:32] denomination and just poking the Bible
[59:34] and we say oh wait there's no I come
[59:37] from God it should have been more than
[59:41] saying amen
[59:43] you go you go and claim your natural
[59:46] brain stuckness I stated by Darwin now
[59:49] we're gonna come to the end I want
[59:53] something that's gonna make me live
[59:54] forever
[59:56] this faith I inherited it's gonna make
[59:58] me live for help
[59:59] you told Abraham is coming out of your
[1:00:02] own very own bowels and chance this God
[1:00:05] that we live for we come out of the very
[1:00:08] bowels of God the love of God come out
[1:00:13] of the bowels of God the faith of God
[1:00:15] come out of the bowels of God amen and
[1:00:18] if you don't believe that
[1:00:19] oh yeah apples produce apples anyway all
[1:00:24] just oranges grapes grapes Eagles Eagles
[1:00:27] Lions Lions and if all that is still
[1:00:29] producing like God created so should we
[1:00:34] go predict this more God let's look at
[1:00:41] the Heritage let's look at a little bit
[1:00:43] closer he says - I want you to catch the
[1:00:46] thais before I close he says to God he
[1:00:49] said hey the only one I got the pass
[1:00:51] down is just a leader of Damascus you
[1:00:53] know really reason when you do it when
[1:00:55] you dealing with a heritage it's like
[1:00:58] the reading of a will you know is being
[1:01:00] once what's left behind from that person
[1:01:03] who's no longer there but he's already
[1:01:05] put things in place for different people
[1:01:08] to get his prized possessions amen and
[1:01:11] at the rear of the wheel there's one
[1:01:13] person honey
[1:01:14] dividing everything and they call that
[1:01:17] person the power of attorney he has the
[1:01:21] power to give out everything that that
[1:01:23] person left behind but he's been
[1:01:25] instructed who to give it to hardly do
[1:01:28] you might walk the car but he didn't owe
[1:01:30] somebody else to get the car to that
[1:01:31] person you might want the house we
[1:01:33] didn't tell her to get a house - and the
[1:01:35] only one that has the power in starting
[1:01:37] to do is the power of attorney
[1:01:39] and Abraham said to God I don't want any
[1:01:43] either to be the power of attorney Hey
[1:01:45] he said he's I want him to be my heir
[1:01:48] he's the power of attorney and you know
[1:01:50] what brother Brennan with the power of
[1:01:52] attorney he was a power of attorney
[1:01:58] but what he was passing out he was
[1:02:00] passing out to us he's passing out the
[1:02:02] guards children honey he passed it out
[1:02:05] and now we're the recipients of it
[1:02:07] that's what I love about a wheel you
[1:02:10] know like I said I'm I'm from Carolina
[1:02:13] South Carolina you know just imagine the
[1:02:18] wheel was being reared up here one day
[1:02:19] brother H and this whole southern boy
[1:02:22] come up to come up to the willing of the
[1:02:24] wheel the reading of the wheel and you
[1:02:27] might look at me and all the other kids
[1:02:30] are sitting at the table and then
[1:02:32] there's a little illegitimate club daddy
[1:02:37] got a secret daddy got something I
[1:02:42] didn't nobody else don't know Bob but
[1:02:44] father and son has established a
[1:02:46] relationship so much of a relationship
[1:02:49] they meant that daddy said I don't know
[1:02:52] system brothers don't know you we don't
[1:02:54] get the same reward huh your name is
[1:02:58] gonna be written down on the document a
[1:03:00] man and some of us may have felt like we
[1:03:02] were illegitimate but we go steal
[1:03:04] something though
[1:03:05] and nobody can take that away then you
[1:03:08] look at you outside and all you want but
[1:03:11] your name is on the document oh yeah oh
[1:03:14] yeah my father made sure he left me an
[1:03:18] inheritance we might not have the same
[1:03:22] mama but we got the same daddy oh yeah
[1:03:24] and I'm gonna get what God has for me
[1:03:27] amen and you know your system Rose can
[1:03:30] dislike you they can look at y'all side
[1:03:32] I think he don't belong in this family
[1:03:34] ain't worried about that my name on the
[1:03:37] book talked about me as much as you
[1:03:40] please from the name on the book huh I
[1:03:43] come out of the same bowels of God holy
[1:03:46] and this heritage this appearances of
[1:03:50] faith has been passed down you know like
[1:03:52] I said brother
[1:03:53] he was the power of attorney he was
[1:03:56] there
[1:03:56] how are you giving us and you know that
[1:03:58] the deduction of this and adoption of
[1:04:01] that he was laying it all down because
[1:04:03] we were the only ones who could receive
[1:04:05] what the father was saying hallelujah
[1:04:07] but gee they got to a place to where God
[1:04:10] did what he said he was gonna do he told
[1:04:14] Abraham you're gonna have a son
[1:04:16] they took 25 years but he inherited what
[1:04:21] God said he was going in happy and
[1:04:23] that's what I want to get you today
[1:04:27] don't fall back on the promises of God
[1:04:30] whatever God has said in his word it
[1:04:33] shall come to pass you know I think I
[1:04:37] think of the prodigal son as I'm closing
[1:04:41] the prodigal he knew he had an
[1:04:44] inheritance a man church he knew he had
[1:04:48] an inheritance but he got a little too
[1:04:50] fast he got a little too fast he saw an
[1:04:54] accumulating maybe one day he walked in
[1:04:56] the room he saw his name his part of
[1:04:59] inheritance he said all that man why I
[1:05:03] gotta wait I won't mind right now so he
[1:05:06] went to his dad hey Dad I want
[1:05:08] everything I want my stuff not so dad I
[1:05:11] said okay
[1:05:11] you want it i'ma go ahead and give it to
[1:05:14] anger hold it back from you so daddy
[1:05:16] gave him his inheritance Church he went
[1:05:19] out there he wasted he wasted everything
[1:05:21] he had plenty of friends he was living
[1:05:24] it all up but why he was doing all that
[1:05:26] he couldn't enjoy how many people today
[1:05:31] hungry have left God they living in the
[1:05:33] world and their life is miserable cuz
[1:05:37] you can't enjoy you know why you can't
[1:05:39] enjoy because of where you come from huh
[1:05:43] y'all heritage real follow you who you
[1:05:49] are tell the god damn they gonna let you
[1:05:51] go easy then I imagine one day this boy
[1:05:56] was dying in a pigpen bodies from shock
[1:05:59] and then the real meaning of his
[1:06:02] heritage came to light
[1:06:04] all his money go he was thinking that
[1:06:07] was his inheritance but didn't click he
[1:06:10] said man my dad got service that lives
[1:06:14] better than us he said you know what I'm
[1:06:18] greater than a servant
[1:06:19] I'm a son so he's time to realize what
[1:06:23] his heritage was a church our had Jesus
[1:06:25] not the material things of this world
[1:06:27] our hands he says that we sons and
[1:06:29] daughters that's our heritage our
[1:06:31] heritage is that we're children of the
[1:06:34] king we were just holier not cause we
[1:06:37] can cast out the devil that we were
[1:06:38] taught cuz our name is written in heaven
[1:06:41] casting out demons just abolish hello
[1:06:46] and you can imagine earlier that father
[1:06:49] knew one day that son would really catch
[1:06:53] what it's inheritance is about all this
[1:06:56] money go and then one day
[1:06:58] what's the coincidence of that father
[1:06:59] standing out there that particular day
[1:07:02] and I saw that father knew one day was
[1:07:07] gonna click and a real father he's
[1:07:10] waiting on that child come to them sense
[1:07:12] come to their senses you may think he's
[1:07:14] hard you may think that he don't know
[1:07:16] what he talking about but all you want
[1:07:18] to do is see you catch it that's all you
[1:07:20] want to see he want to see you catch you
[1:07:22] inheritance honey catch it amen and once
[1:07:25] you catch it you realize your value
[1:07:28] that's what happened to that prodigal
[1:07:31] son he realized his value her his value
[1:07:34] what is natural money his value was his
[1:07:37] inheritance
[1:07:37] his name his family hug where he came
[1:07:41] from he realizes value and he went back
[1:07:43] home his father gave him a rock and put
[1:07:45] a ring on his feet he thought all his
[1:07:48] possessions was gone but God begins his
[1:07:50] father beginning to show him I got
[1:07:52] something greater for you then some
[1:07:55] money huh hey man I'm gonna put you in
[1:07:58] position just that's what it's about
[1:08:02] God is positionally placing us by faith
[1:08:06] hurry just faith that we're having hey
[1:08:09] man is that God may positionally place
[1:08:11] us so he could show the world that he's
[1:08:14] still living sutures the denominational
[1:08:17] world
[1:08:18] they couldn't tap into the heritage of
[1:08:20] faith they couldn't tap into it you know
[1:08:23] they said I'm about close don't get
[1:08:25] nervous they said you know we don't
[1:08:28] crucify you because of the good things
[1:08:31] you do we don't crucify for you we
[1:08:34] crucify you because you being a man say
[1:08:37] you God
[1:08:38] make yourself to be God Church they
[1:08:40] couldn't understand the heritage they
[1:08:43] couldn't understand he wasn't a man he
[1:08:48] was God for God I'm not a human being
[1:09:09] trying to be a child of God I'm at our
[1:09:12] God first living as a human being

[1:09:22] it will be God and his children God his
[1:09:26] children so he wouldn't I want you to
[1:09:31] catch this go see he was God first

[1:09:47] gone God had to be real of breast milk
[1:09:52] God had his diaper change any man but he
[1:09:56] did that to show us holy that we can
[1:10:00] live abroad this flesh cuz we are God's
[1:10:03] first so tap into your heritage tap into

[1:15:43] get my attention at the age of 15 yeah
[1:15:46] 15 years old and you know what he's
[1:15:49] still getting my attention Church the
[1:15:56] greatest thing I ever did in my life was
[1:15:59] when I repented when I said god I need
[1:16:04] you I can't do it on my own I still do
[1:16:08] that I still do I get I get along with
[1:16:11] God and I said lord I don't know what to
[1:16:13] do I need your help those are some of
[1:16:16] the best prayers honey when you can stop
[1:16:19] trying to do you know sometimes we we we
[1:16:22] would we take advice that we want to
[1:16:25] hear we go to people we know gonna favor
[1:16:29] us you know it's like it's like a
[1:16:32] husband garden told him I just put
[1:16:35] myself in God and told him to give me
[1:16:37] $1,000
[1:16:40] God didn't told him man two birdies
[1:16:42] $1,000 and he quite don't want to do it
[1:16:45] so what'd he do he put it all on his
[1:16:48] wife no one she got things in the house
[1:16:51] she won't done and
[1:16:54] you showed us you know we got there we
[1:16:59] got that we need to do that we need you
[1:17:00] so yeah that's kind of what I thought I
[1:17:02] thought I wasn't supposed to do
[1:17:06] but God didn't tell him what to do now
[1:17:09] and he blaming it all on his wife we do
[1:17:11] that all the time
[1:17:12] God didn't told us what to do and we put
[1:17:14] it on someone we go back somebody garden
[1:17:18] told you already
[1:17:19] step into the heritage huh you can never
[1:17:21] go wrong trusting God huh
[1:17:25] but remember what I say amen whatever
[1:17:28] God is doing in your life it won't
[1:17:31] produce chaos if God is doing it it
[1:17:35] won't produce chaos because the Bible
[1:17:37] says God is not the author of confusion
[1:17:40] hilarya and if this producing confusion
[1:17:43] is not of God honey
[1:17:46] that's why sometimes I take a step back
[1:17:48] and I said lord I need you to direct me
[1:17:51] that don't mean for me to do nothing I
[1:17:54] mean for me to wait and let God open
[1:17:57] doors that God direct let God show me
[1:17:59] listen show me that that's what we need
[1:18:01] church
[1:18:01] that's the heritage of faith wind in
[1:18:04] Abraham get the Sun when he completely
[1:18:07] yielded and let himself lean on God
[1:18:10] that's when the Sun came when he didn't
[1:18:13] know no way out but he had to trust God
[1:18:15] that's when he got son Hurley so church
[1:18:19] let's trust God let's tap into this
[1:18:21] heritage of faith honey
[1:18:23] everything about God is in his
[1:18:26] supernatural seed and all we got to do
[1:18:29] is believe and walk into it still church
[1:18:33] is here let's pray musicians come let's

[1:30:56] us
[1:30:57] as we stand let us take our scripture
[1:31:03] reading from first Corinthians the 11th
[1:31:07] chapter
[1:31:21] we'll begin reading by God's grace at
[1:31:24] the 23rd verse
[1:31:30] I have received of the Lord that which
[1:31:32] also I delivered unto you that the Lord
[1:31:36] Jesus the same night in which he was
[1:31:39] betrayed took bread and when he had
[1:31:44] given thanks he brake it and said take
[1:31:47] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:31:51] you this do in remembrance of me after
[1:31:55] the same manner also he took the cup
[1:31:58] when he had supped saying this cup is
[1:32:01] the New Testament in my blood this do ye
[1:32:04] as often as you drink it in remembrance
[1:32:06] of me for us often as you eat this bread
[1:32:11] and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's
[1:32:14] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[1:32:17] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:32:20] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:32:23] of the body and blood of the Lord but
[1:32:27] let a man examine himself and so let him
[1:32:30] eat of that bread and drink of that Cup
[1:32:33] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:32:35] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:32:37] to himself not discerning the Lord's
[1:32:40] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:32:44] sickly among you and many sleep for if
[1:32:48] we would judge ourselves we would not
[1:32:50] should not be judged but when we are
[1:32:53] judged we are chastened of the Lord that
[1:32:56] we should not be condemned with the
[1:32:58] world wherefore my brethren when you
[1:33:01] come together to eat tarry one for
[1:33:05] another and if any man hunger let him
[1:33:08] eat at home that you come not together
[1:33:11] unto condemnation and the rest will I
[1:33:14] set in order when I come let us pray do
[1:33:20] you have any father God we so thank your
[1:33:22] father for your mercy and your grace
[1:33:28] such a wonderful Savior as we break this
[1:33:33] bread Lord we break it in your name and
[1:33:37] we pray father God that in so doing we
[1:33:41] will see the real meaning and real
[1:33:43] purpose behind it bless those who are
[1:33:47] sick and afflicted bless those who are
[1:33:50] cast down in spirit we pray father God
[1:33:53] that your word will excel above all
[1:33:57] problems in situations that we are faced
[1:34:01] with Lord we thank you for the work that
[1:34:04] has been done we give you honor we give
[1:34:07] you glory and we give you praise in
[1:34:09] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
