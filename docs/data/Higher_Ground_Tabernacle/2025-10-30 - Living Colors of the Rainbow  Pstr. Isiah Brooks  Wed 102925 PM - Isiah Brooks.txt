Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Surely God is good to us tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're just going to get right into the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Ask that you turn with us to Romans the 8th chapter. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We're going to start reading at the 33rd verse. We'll read extensively to the verses 39th verse. &gt;&gt; And yeah, we'll just leave it there. Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifith. Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ that died, gave rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercessions for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or pearl or sword? As it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long. &gt;&gt; We are counted as sheep for the slaughter. through him that loveth us. For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principality, nor power, nor pres nor things presence, nor things to come, &gt;&gt; nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. our Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us pray. Dear heavenly father, we come before you, Lord Jesus. As humbly as we know how. We thank you for this lovely time of day. Forgive us for anything we may have said or done that may not been pleasing to your sight. Bless the service this evening. Let your grace abound in our lives, Lord, and we'll be careful to give you the praise, glory, and honor. &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; We just want to thank the Lord God for his grace and his mercy. We thank you for your prayers uh during our time of absence here. &gt;&gt; Uh the funeral service of brother Bobby WZ &gt;&gt; on Thursday what went well. I was in Minnesota &gt;&gt; and then my wife and I flew out &gt;&gt; on Friday down to South Carolina &gt;&gt; to uh our pastor's wife funeral. It It was amazing. It truly was a homegoing. It truly was a celebration. And it so many people spoke so highly of her. Another thing that was really wonderful. It was more like a reunion got to see people whom I had never hadn't seen in a long time. Even some even some denominational friends and brethren. &gt;&gt; It was a beautiful situation. And so we thank you for your prayers. &gt;&gt; We did get a chance to see my sister-in-law &gt;&gt; is struggling or I don't know how to say it. Uh because the time prior to that our visitation it seems as though she only had a short time to live. &gt;&gt; And then when we return this time God had touched her body and she was still in the bed, but she had so much strength. She was talking. She was laughing. And it was a glorious time with my brother as well as with his wife. Her name is Adrian. So, if you can remember her in prayer, she is truly a woman of faith. So, we appreciate everything. This is going to sound like a strange subject for a message, &gt;&gt; but by the grace of God, &gt;&gt; I feel like I was really inspired in such a strange way. And I'm not sure if I'm going to bring this message the way God gave it to me. Sometimes God talk to me in my dreams &gt;&gt; and in my dreams. Sometimes I don't get up like I should to write things down like I should, but I pray by the grace of God that that I did get the most of what he wanted to say. And it dealt with rainbows. the rainbow. &gt;&gt; And um it was beautiful. &gt;&gt; Everything I saw was beautiful. &gt;&gt; But something I saw in the dream I had never seen. And the rainbow was not outside of me, but the rainbow was inside of me. Amen. But before I go any further, &gt;&gt; it wasn't colors. &gt;&gt; It was character. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I I was just amazed. I'm still amazed at what I saw and what I was able to comprehend. So my subject tonight is the living colors of the rainbow. And so that you understand all of these things, I trust I'll be able to tie in &gt;&gt; because there's another thing that produces the colors of a rainbow outside of water droplets and climate. &gt;&gt; The diamond &gt;&gt; the diamond also produces the color of the rainbow. And brother Brandham said that the there is a great diamond &gt;&gt; and that diamond is the diamond of God who is Jesus Christ. This diamond had to be cut. It had to be shipped. And brother Random said the pieces of or the chips of the of that diamond was given to you and I &gt;&gt; as gifts. So if I had a sub a sub a subtopic I would call it the covenant people. I read the scripture in Romans because when I read that scripture, I think to myself, &gt;&gt; there's no way a true believer can ever be lost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It it's so amazing to me how we have struggled so many years with ourselves with doctrines. &gt;&gt; And when it comes to your salvation, doctrine has nothing to do with it because you're not saved by your doctrine. &gt;&gt; You're saved by grace. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Remember when brother Brandham &gt;&gt; saw those three powerful rainbows? I think he said they grew up to about 30 foot tall. And then then he took his hat off &gt;&gt; and he spoke to those rainbows and said, "God, what would you have of your servant?" Out of the rainbow, the spirit of the Lord spoke in the message of grace. Paragraph 26. Brother said, "Just then the spirit of the Lord came in and said Jesus of the New Testament &gt;&gt; is Jehovah of the Old." &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Came by me. He said came in and said Jesus of the New Testament is Jehovah of the Old. He only changes mask from spirit to man that was confirming of course my message of him. letting me know assured that these 31 years hasn't been in vain. Now, perhaps that doesn't mean much to you, but to just ordinary preacher, we like to be right on the word. But when God comes and vindicates it and speak to you directly that your message have been correct for 31 years and I think about this is in 1961. Give him two more years in 1963 right at the age of what? Jesus Christ leaving the earth right at a time of transition. &gt;&gt; The seals were open. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 2,000 years later, &gt;&gt; Christ comes in such a secret way that the world could not catch it. They couldn't understand it. And here was this man talking about things like John the Baptist would talk about. He came talking about squirrels and you know and eagles and things of the wilderness where he learned God through nature. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you see, by the grace of God, &gt;&gt; even in brother Brandham's uh days, &gt;&gt; he had to come to see what true grace was. &gt;&gt; He was a man just like we are. And he had to take the journey just like we all did, right? But when you come to know that the grace of God is sovereign, &gt;&gt; that means he doesn't need anybody else's pos uh permission. God will do whatever he wants to do. That's why we can't just judge each other any kind of way. And brother Brandham talks about it like this. He said, "As long as a man has a pull in his life or desire to have more God, &gt;&gt; no matter how bad they are, God is not finished with that man. So we have no right to write anybody off regardless to how it appears to us because we don't know what God is doing. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Remember the time &gt;&gt; when brother Brandham saw the woman &gt;&gt; with purple hair, purple nails, tattoos. &gt;&gt; I mean, she had everything that a harlot would wear. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But behind all of that, &gt;&gt; she was a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And in brother Brandham's judgment, judging as a man, he said, "God, how can you put up with such a thing? Why don't you just wipe it off the earth?" And God said, "Let's have a conference. Come on behind the door." And behind that door, God told showed brother Brandham, &gt;&gt; not somebody else's sin. He showed brother Brandham his own sin. But one thing he did show brother Brandham is that the whole world was covered by the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that blood, &gt;&gt; that veil &gt;&gt; gives the the most vile sinner &gt;&gt; a chance to repent a chance to say be saved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then the Lord told uh showed brother Bham who this woman was. &gt;&gt; She was just a backslider. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Did y'all hear what I said? I said a backslider. &gt;&gt; She once was God. &gt;&gt; And so you understand when you once was God, &gt;&gt; you will always be God no matter your condition. So we find out. Amen. The prophet of God &gt;&gt; nailed kneelled with that woman &gt;&gt; in that restaurant that looked like a juke joint joint. U how could I say it? Look like a potty house and led her back to Christ. Guess what? You will see her there. &gt;&gt; Let me read a quote. coming from the message of grace, &gt;&gt; paragraph &gt;&gt; 130, I believe, &gt;&gt; it says, "Soverevereign grace can only be given by one that's sovereign, &gt;&gt; and God is sovereign." &gt;&gt; So, he can give sovereign grace. Therefore, being sovereign, &gt;&gt; grace don't have to ask anybody. It don't have it don't have to. It does it want does what it wants to. Isn't that wonderful? It don't have to ask. Can I do this or shall I do this? Can I? Must I will I? Nothing to it. It does it itself. Grace is sovereign. Therefore, he can save the violence. &gt;&gt; He can save the worst. &gt;&gt; He can save the impurist. He can save the immoralist. He can heal the sick. Hallelujah. He can save a wretch like me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AND HE DID. &gt;&gt; What is it? &gt;&gt; Grace. &gt;&gt; William Brandham. a drunker's son. &gt;&gt; That don't make any difference. &gt;&gt; The grace of God saved me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. Me, &gt;&gt; I'm a I'm a woman's daughter. &gt;&gt; That was no good. Don't make any difference. The grace of God saved you. It's sovereign. Has to ask nobody nothing. Amen. And I'm so glad of of that. Yes, sir. Can take the violent sinner &gt;&gt; and make him white as snow. Hallelujah. Don't has to ask anybody about it. OH, IF I can do it because it's sovereign. Listen quickly now. That was proved at the cross when there was a violent thief. He deserved to die. God had never God had never come across his mind. He never thought nothing OF IT. THERE WAS there on the cross when though those bloody through those bloody lips in between the groans there came a sound. [Music] be merciful to me. &gt;&gt; I love that deep call to the deer. Hallelujah. And there came another one back through blood. Tears agony. &gt;&gt; Grace took a hold and said, &gt;&gt; "Today, SHALT THOU BE WITH ME in paradise." GRACE DID THAT. &gt;&gt; HOW COULD THAT thief help himself? No more than Adam could help himself. No more than Eve could help himself. No more than you can help yourself. No more than I can HELP MYSELF WITH. No more. We could jerk ourselves up to the Milky White way &gt;&gt; with our bootstraps. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. &gt;&gt; We couldn't do it. But the grace of God &gt;&gt; can do something about it. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. &gt;&gt; But the grace of God can do something about it. &gt;&gt; And it does it. &gt;&gt; The grace of God. &gt;&gt; The sovereignty of the grace of God. Come to that dying thief. today thou shalt be with me IN PARADISE. OH, THINK OF IT. That's wonderful. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, I want you to understand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That &gt;&gt; a rainbow just can't be formed. It takes certain conditions. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that right? But with it all, we understand that love and grace are twin sisters. If you say you have grace and you can't love, then you don't have you don't have grace because grace and love comes together. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They are the same according to the prophet. &gt;&gt; You can't have one without the other. Love is grace. &gt;&gt; You can have you can't you can have any and every gift cannot be saved. &gt;&gt; You are saved by grace alone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Turn with me to Revelations 10, please. Why are you preaching this? &gt;&gt; We worry too much. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We make some mistakes &gt;&gt; and we think we're hellbound. &gt;&gt; Not if God's grace has captured you. Do you understand &gt;&gt; to actually hear this message &gt;&gt; is the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Let me define this. Let me say it clear. &gt;&gt; You are pieces of the diamond. You came from God and you go back to God. &gt;&gt; All diamonds are not the same. &gt;&gt; You got black diamonds. You got white diamonds. &gt;&gt; You got emeralds. &gt;&gt; Just various diamonds. It all depends on how the light strikes it. Hallelujah. I love this. One of the things I love about music. It takes a chord to make a beautiful sound. One note by itself is it just don't make it. But you put certain notes together and get a little chord going, &gt;&gt; then we call it music. &gt;&gt; That's how it is. The body of Christ. You're not here just for yourself. YOU'RE here to make certain sounds so God can put it all together and we can bring some music in here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A rainbow is not OF ONE COLOR. SEVEN DIFFERENT colors and it's beautiful, right? And when you see it, guess what you think? Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Isn't that A BLESSING? IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT a rainbow that literally spells bound you, especially when you see a double one. Hallelujah. Now, I don't know about you, but I've had two I've had it more than once. double rainbows over my house. I can see it in the back and I can see it from the front. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when I see those rainbows, you know what I think? He's alpha and omega. Hallelujah. Revelations 10 beginning at the first verse. &gt;&gt; We can't help what this perverted generation has done with the rainbow. But we can't be ashamed of ours either. &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; And right now sometimes you're so afraid to wear certain colors because you think somebody going to think you something wrong. But you must understand &gt;&gt; everything is given to you. &gt;&gt; All yours. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When God created all those colors. &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, wait a minute, brother." Well, let me tell you like this. The beauty of the peacock &gt;&gt; bird is the male. I'm just saying &gt;&gt; we're the ones that been brought in a perverted way. &gt;&gt; You hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; But I don't want to get into that. Let's move on. And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun. and his feet as pillars of fire. &gt;&gt; Now, when I saw this, &gt;&gt; I thought about how it was a clothed with a cloud and a rainbow. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So, we realized by the grace of God that God identify himself with the rainbow, &gt;&gt; right? and even in the stature of a perfect man. Now, those colors ain't quite right, but we have a rainbow. But what I did not know is that when all those colors blend together, they produce a white light. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'M SAYING? AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY JESUS SAYS, "Yeah are the light of the world." &gt;&gt; Because you are now carrying &gt;&gt; the virtue &gt;&gt; and the rainbow OF GOD &gt;&gt; ON THE INSIDE. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE HE sits on YOUR THRONE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And on the throne &gt;&gt; WAS A CLOUD. COME ON, SOMEBODY. LET ME SAY WHY WASN'T it just a pillar of fire? &gt;&gt; Because the cloud came by day and the pillar of fire came by night. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there in heaven there'll be no night. &gt;&gt; OH, come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; IT'LL BE THE GLORY OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; LIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THE BIBLE SAID THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR THE SUN. WHY? Because the LAMB IS THE LIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND WHERE DOES THE lamb sit? &gt;&gt; On the top of the pyramid. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, brothers, what are you saying?" When we saw the pillar of fire come down, the Bible said there shall be light in the evening time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so we realize by the grace of God how many times brother Bam have said it while he was preaching. The cloud came down and he said it's so milky in this place. What was it? IT WAS THE GLORY OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT was the CLOUD OF GOD FILLING the room. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This this message is real. &gt;&gt; It's real. &gt;&gt; And uh it doesn't matter what anybody says. &gt;&gt; I was telling the brother today, I I know he he believes differently from me. But I wasn't trying to, you know, I was just telling him, I'm free. I can go wherever I want to. &gt;&gt; And nobody's doctrine going to bother me because I know what I got. I know what I have. You see what I'm saying? Even if they disagree with me or I disagree with them, I can still love them without HAVING AN ATTITUDE. [Music] EVERYBODY DOES IT DIFFERENTLY. Sad to say, but brother Bradom said not even two men can agree. The more preachers you got, the more division you got. That's why he said if we can get 10 believers or one accord, he said the rapture take place. &gt;&gt; You hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; So we realize by the grace of God, I say all the time, everything's moving by the power of God. And what you may have your opinion about somebody will never change God's mind about that person. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They didn't even like John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; But God loved him. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? You might look at somebody says, "Man, that sister boy, she ain't nothing but a hypocrite." And that may be true at in in her life at that point, &gt;&gt; but she's here for some reason. &gt;&gt; She's serving a purpose. Y'all hear what I'm saying? EVEN IN THIS CHURCH, EVERYBODY HAS A PURPOSE. It has to be this way in order for God TO GAIN GLORY. NOTHING'S OUT OF ORDER. BUT YOU MUST THANK GOD THAT YOU SEE THE GRACE OF GOD AND GOD HAS KEPT YOU &gt;&gt; FROM MAKING HIS grace disgrace. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You heard I said I said you ought to thank God &gt;&gt; because God has made you &gt;&gt; to see and to know the difference between grace and disgrace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's move on. And he had in his hand, &gt;&gt; let me explain that a bit. &gt;&gt; You mean you mean you remember David &gt;&gt; and Basheba? &gt;&gt; And David &gt;&gt; judged his his himself. &gt;&gt; He didn't even realize it. &gt;&gt; And he said, "The man who did this thing &gt;&gt; is worthy of death. And then the prophet said, &gt;&gt; "But you're the man." &gt;&gt; Amen. He desire he deserved, brother said, "He deserved to die." &gt;&gt; BUT GRACE, &gt;&gt; grace stepped in. DID HE SUFFER? HE SUFFERED. HE WENT THROUGH BATTLES THAT HE WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE THROUGH. HALLELUJAH. BUT HE NEVER LOST HIS SOUL. &gt;&gt; AND GOD STILL HONORED HIM. &gt;&gt; SEE, you you what you think about people don't mean a hill of beans. &gt;&gt; It's all about what God thinks about. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, now, now move on. And he had in his hand a little book open. And he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth. And he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared. And when he had cried, even seven thunders uttered their voices. And when the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write. And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, "Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not." And the angel with their salt stand upon the sea and upon the earth, lifted up his hand toward heaven, and swear by him that liveth forever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that there are in are. And the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time NO LONGER. BUT in the day of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin TO SOUND THE MYSTERY of God a lot of time we say mysteries it doesn't say that it SAYS THE MYSTERY one mystery &gt;&gt; that's why I said the God of &gt;&gt; Jehovah of the Old Testament &gt;&gt; is Jesus Christ of the Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Hebrews 13:8 says &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is saying yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; He's a God that changes not. &gt;&gt; He may change his mask, &gt;&gt; but he never changes his character. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; The mystery of God should be finished. Have he declared to his servants the prophets? And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and say, "Go and take the little book which is which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth." And I went unto the angel, and he said unto him, "Give me the little book." And he said unto me, "Take it, eat it up, &gt;&gt; and it shall be bitter. Amen. It &gt;&gt; It shall make thy belly bitter, &gt;&gt; but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. And I took the little book out of the angel and ate it up, and it was it was in my mouth sweet as honey, but as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy again before many people and nations and tongues and kings." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So just understand as the prophet God said, this message wasn't done in a corner. Hallelujah. We're living in we're living in an evil time. And many people have come to America and they say, "Well, what is it that people don't even um know brother Brandham?" The Bible says a a prophet is without honor in his own country. Hallelujah. And if you don't believe it, go to Jerusalem and find out who how many people know Jesus there. Y'all understand me? So we realize by the grace of God that God did a a thing &gt;&gt; in our day. Amen so simple. Majority of the people missed it. Now I can't preach on every point in this particular scriptures. So just just bear with me. Revelations 4 Revelations 4. After this, I looked, &gt;&gt; and behold, a door was open in heaven. And the first voice which I heard was as it were a a trumpet talking with me, which said, "Come up hither, and I will show you these things which must be hereafter." And immediately I was in the spirit. Behold, a throne was set, and one sat on the throne, and he that sat &gt;&gt; was to look upon like jasper and sodas. There was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like an emerald. Now when we look at this remember brother Adam says the book of revelation is a book of symbols. &gt;&gt; So understand whenever you see things or read things it has a different application right? So you must understand that it who represented the sing stone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because we talking about the children of Israel too because remember the seven church ages also included the Jewish people as well. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Even though God was dealing with the Gentiles, the seven candlesticks was of the Jew first. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then we find out &gt;&gt; that Jesus Christ walked in the midst of the golden candlesticks. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And in the midst of the golden candlesticks, &gt;&gt; he had a rainbow above his head. &gt;&gt; It was a covenant, unconditional covenant. &gt;&gt; What are you saying? When God promised uh Noah it wasn't going to rain anymore. Noah did nothing to gain the covenant that God gave him. That was grace. It'll never flood again. Noah, but the next time it would be fire. Hallelujah. So what was he saying to Noah? your uh your uh how could the world in itself &gt;&gt; was destroyed &gt;&gt; temporarily. Amen. &gt;&gt; But this time, I'm going to cleanse it &gt;&gt; and purge it forever by fire. Y'all hear what I'm saying? We come through justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost, right? And then the prophet OF GOD TELLS US NOBODY ELSE HAS THIS. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T YOU DON'T HEAR THIS among denominationals that we've got to grow immature into Christ. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU DON'T HEAR THESE THINGS ABOUT being a diamond that has to be cut and shaped. We don't hear these things. We hear WE WE UNDERSTAND OUR TRIALS. WE UNDERSTAND OUR TEMPTATIONS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT SCRIPTURE THAT ALL THINGS WORK TOGETHER FOR THE GOOD OF THEM THAT LOVE THE LORD. WE UNDERSTAND THAT. HALLELUJAH. AND BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND that we see AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT NO WEAPON FORMED AGAINST US CAN PROSPER. IT DOESN'T PROSPER. IS WHAT YOU HAVE ON THE INSIDE THAT WAS GIVEN TO YOU BEFORE YOU EVEN CAME HERE. And if God LOVED YOU THEN, HE LOVE YOU NOW, EVEN THE BIBLE SAYS IN THAT WHILE WE WERE YET SINNERS, CHRIST died for us. &gt;&gt; What a mighty God. &gt;&gt; What a covenant. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let let's move on. Immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne the second verse &gt;&gt; was set in heaven and one sat on the throne. And he that sat was to look upon as Jasper inside his feet. Brother said that was Reuben and Benjamin. Reuben and Benjamin, &gt;&gt; the alpha and the omega &gt;&gt; was able to produce that light above his head, &gt;&gt; the emerald. &gt;&gt; And what did that include? &gt;&gt; Everything in between. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO GOD KNOWS EXACTLY what he's doing. &gt;&gt; Why wouldn't he know? &gt;&gt; He's God. And around about the throne were four and 20 seats. Upon the seats I saw four and 20 elders sitting &gt;&gt; clothed in white raignment. And they had on their heads crowns of what? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which was the seven spirits of God. &gt;&gt; Now, we were taught that the seven spirits, &gt;&gt; it's the same spirit just used in seven ways. Starting with Paul, the seven church ages, seven ministries, &gt;&gt; by the same SPIRIT IS THAT RIGHT? ONE BODY, MANY MEMBERS, MANY FUNCTIONS, one spirit. HALLELUJAH. BUT IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT, you think that God has seven spirits. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE'S ONLY ONE DIAMOND THAT REFLECTS SEVEN COLORS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; But what I didn't understand in my study &gt;&gt; is that in the rainbow &gt;&gt; there are millions of different colors in between. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But we see only the seven major with everything coming together. Hallelujah. IT PRODUCES THE SEVEN. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, BROTHER BROOKS? &gt;&gt; IT MAKES SENSE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAID THERE WAS NO NO NUMBER. NOBODY COULD NUMBER IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE YOU GOT TO REALIZE THAT ALL OF US IS PART OF THE RAINBOW. You say, "Wait a minute, brother. I don't know about that." So, I'mma jump a little bit. &gt;&gt; I'mma jump a little bit. Guess what happened to Joseph? &gt;&gt; His daddy gave him a co a coat of many colors. And guess what he did with it? He wore it. [Laughter] That's why brother B said you got to see the token. See these attributes in you. &gt;&gt; They must must reflect itself outward. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You understand me? It must be a RAINBOW OF CHARACTER, flowing through you that other men's may see you or see him and glorify God. You hear what I'm saying? When you see a rainbow, what do you do? You glorify God. Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; I love this. &gt;&gt; Let me let me uh So, Joseph, &gt;&gt; we know how it was with Joseph, &gt;&gt; his brothers hated him and everything when when they took the coat from him, you know, and you know, killed the little goat or whatever it was, put the blood on it, the coat went back to the father. But on the day of Pentecost, He dropped the coat back. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; It was like an Elijah and Alicia, &gt;&gt; right? I got to wear the same mantel that Elijah wore, we must wear. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THE SAME ROBE THAT Jesus wore, we must wear. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. NOW YOU HAVE BECOME PART of his what? &gt;&gt; DIVINE NATURE. &gt;&gt; That was his robe. &gt;&gt; His divine nature &gt;&gt; was his robe. &gt;&gt; That's what brother Bham came to do. He said, "I I I TRUST THE LORD HAS GIVEN ME THE GRACE &gt;&gt; TO DO WHAT? DRESS THE BRIDE." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND HOW DID HE DRESS THE BRIDE? BY TELLING US AND EXPLAINING TO US WHAT PETER WAS SAYING, HELLO, &gt;&gt; right the divine NATURE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AND HERE PETER SAYS, IF ALL THESE THINGS be in you, you shall not fall, neither will you be barren. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you what you're saying? What is that? &gt;&gt; Y'all got to understand Enoch. &gt;&gt; He built the pyramid. &gt;&gt; He didn't put the capstone on it. &gt;&gt; He wasn't, "Oh my goodness, they're not going to accept the word." He knew Noah. He knew that Noah was going to only have a few people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; ENOCH. HAD TO HAVE PREACHED JESUS. In order FOR THEM TO REJECT HIM, ENOCH had to have a message. THINK ABOUT IT. HE PUT THE THE pyramid and there was no headstone. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND ALL NOAH COULD DO &gt;&gt; IS PREACH AND SAY, "COME IN THE ARK." BUT ENOCH'S MESSAGE WAS DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; IF YOU WALK WITH GOD, &gt;&gt; YOU'LL BE TRANSLATED. &gt;&gt; You just have to read through between the lines. That's right. Hallelujah. Because when Noah came, all he had was his eight, his family and himself, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And Enoch was one, &gt;&gt; showing there was only going to be a fewer saved. Let's put it this way. Red is the strongest color of the rainbow and it's number one. And it has the longest vibration wavelength. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because it represents the blood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the last one &gt;&gt; is what we call purple or violet. It's the shortest. Hallelujah. Oh Lord have mercy. This is good to me. &gt;&gt; It's the shortest. because it types out the bride royalty. &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. THAT'S WHY WE KNOW &gt;&gt; IT'S going to be a few. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S ALL IN THAT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; God is so perfect. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm gonna jump a little bit because I can't do it all. But while you turn with me to Zechariah, I'm going to read St. John 15 16- 17. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ye have not chosen me, &gt;&gt; but I have chosen you and ordain you that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that whatsoever you shall ask of the Father in my name, he shall give it you. These things I command you, hello, that ye love one another. NOW HE TIES ALL OF THAT &gt;&gt; into loving one another. I command you. This is a commandment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; IT'S LOVE BECAUSE LOVE and grace are twins. &gt;&gt; Zechariah. &gt;&gt; I know some of y'all know this. &gt;&gt; Zechariah the 4th chapter. beginning at the fifth verse. &gt;&gt; Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, &gt;&gt; Knowest thou not what thou these be? And I said, no, my Lord. Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel. saying, "Not by might, not by power, but by my spirit, said the Lord of hosts." &gt;&gt; Now, we we've seen that, brother talk about not by denomination, not by organization, but only by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who art thou, oh great mountain before Zerubah? Thou shall become a plain, and he shall bring forth the headstone therewith, shouting, crying, &gt;&gt; grace, &gt;&gt; grace unto it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Have you noticed one grace is capitalized &gt;&gt; and the other grace is not? is a deep call. &gt;&gt; He's crying grace &gt;&gt; and the bride is responding grace &gt;&gt; unto it. Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, &gt;&gt; the hands of Zerubable have laid the foundation of this house. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And I'd looked up Zerubabel and some people say he should not have existed. I forgot the name of the king which would have been his grandfather or his father that messed up so bad. The God said, "I'm finished with the house of David." And if you know the story, Zeruma helped build the temple. He helped build the altar. He was literally acting like a king and a priest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then all of a sudden, he disappeared. &gt;&gt; And nobody really know where he's coming from. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; His whole movement, everything he did, but understand where he showed up at when they were exiting Babylon. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN THEY WERE COMING out of Babylon, &gt;&gt; Zerubbabel showed up &gt;&gt; and you know, I've read where Zerubable mean born in in in in Babylon. &gt;&gt; But years ago, I looked it up. It meant it in wherever. I tried to find it. It meant to be disperse all confusion, &gt;&gt; but I couldn't find that definition anymore. You know, they changed things. &gt;&gt; So, anyway, Zerubable. &gt;&gt; And I I forgot how many years it took. What? 15 years they held him up. Held up the building and the of the wall and everything. 15 years. But Zerubable never gave up. Hallelujah. Is that right? Listen. It says, "The hands of Zerubable have laid the foundation of this house." &gt;&gt; And one author says, &gt;&gt; one author says, Jeruba was a true type of Christ. Jesus. Hallelujah. Because Jesus was the laid the foundation. He was the cornerstone. And Jeruba said, "Not only will I lay it, but I'm going to finish it." And we know that the CORNERSTONE BECAME the headstone, which we CALL IT THE CAPSTONE. AND HE IS THE ONE THAT FINISH IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAID that the WORK THAT JESUS STARTED IN YOU, HE IS FAITHFUL TO COMPLETE IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; LIKE ZERUBBABEL, HE WAS THERE TO BUILD A SECOND TEMPLE. BUT JESUS HIMSELF CAME TO BUILD A THIRD TEMPLE WHICH YOU AND I ARE. WE ARE THE TEMPLE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAID NO MAN CAN ADD A CUBID TO HIS STATUE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT JESUS WHO IS THE MASTER BUILDER. COME ON SOMEBODY. THAT'S WHY IN THE STATUE OF A PERFECT MAN, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID YOU DON'T ADD TO IT. IT WILL ADD TO YOU. HALLELUJAH. SO YOUR PERFECTION IS NOT EVEN IN YOUR HANDS. IT IS GOD WHO PERFECTS YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE IS THE GREAT SHEPHERD. HE'S THE ONE THAT LEADS AND GUIDES YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. JUST FOLLOW AS THE PROPHET said the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts &gt;&gt; have sent me unto you. For who have despised the day of small things, for they shall rejoice and see the plummet of uh in the hand of Zub with those seven eyes. Is that right? &gt;&gt; All of Brother Bon's messages, everything that God gave him, I'm jumping had to be tied in &gt;&gt; with all the others to make a complete seven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All the way from from from from from Paul up to the last day of Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and said they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me read this to you. &gt;&gt; One day on that day, said the Lord of hosts, &gt;&gt; I will take you Zerubel of Sheiel, my son. Sir, &gt;&gt; and wear you like a signate. &gt;&gt; You know what a signate is? It's a ring of a king. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was like Joseph &gt;&gt; when when the king gave Joseph the signate. &gt;&gt; The only thing that was greater than Joseph was the king himself. So here was here was here was Zerubo with the signant. Oh come on somebody. In other word he had the authority of God. the authority of the king. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For it was you whom I have chosen. &gt;&gt; And this is the word of the Lord of hosts. And you can find that in Hi 2:23. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me read a few things. Y'all bear with me to you on Zerubo. &gt;&gt; Jerubo was the restoration and hope. Jerusalem led the Jews in rebuilding the second temple after their exile in Babylon, &gt;&gt; signifying a return to worship and restoration of God's presence at the period of judgment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you got to understand that's what God did in our day. God's power over human human might. &gt;&gt; And this is what the prophet was telling us. It ain't you. &gt;&gt; You can speak in tongues. &gt;&gt; You can be a preacher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can be a musician. You can shout. You can do all the things. And that doesn't mean you're saved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because salvation is of the Lord. All right. The prophet Zachchariah messages Zerubu. &gt;&gt; Not by power nor by might but by my spirit. Hallelujah. Emphasizing that God work is accomplished through divine power and not human strength or might. Y'all hear what I'm saying? That's why you got to stay right there on it. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. The more the the moment you switch to the law, &gt;&gt; you have you have excommunicated yourself from grace. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WE DO NOT live the way we LIVE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE'RE AFRAID TO go to hell. We live THE WAY WE LIVE BECAUSE IT'S OUR NATURE &gt;&gt; to live it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AND OUR NATURE COMPELS US TO LOVE GOD. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And Zerubbabel &gt;&gt; was a a messianic over foreshadowing. of David. &gt;&gt; Zerubable leadership of the temple rebuilding was seen as a fulfillment of Messiah prophecy. He did everything that the Messiah was to do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What did Jesus do when he first saw the temple and saw them trading and selling? In his indignation, &gt;&gt; he got he whipped him out of the temple and he said, "My house shall be called the house of prayer, &gt;&gt; but you have made it a den of thieves." &gt;&gt; Excuse me. By the grace of God, &gt;&gt; we need that whipping to come back through. &gt;&gt; God is good. And I showed you about the signant ring. &gt;&gt; It symbolizes authority, honor, and value in God's eyes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that all right? Understand the faithfulness with leadership. The rubable story encourages believers to trust God's plan and have faith that can can be accomplished what God has called them to do through his spirit. Hallelujah. Even when faith, even when faced with challenges. &gt;&gt; Now, there's no way I'mma finish everything, but I do want to read a few things &gt;&gt; coming from the message. Children of Israel, &gt;&gt; paragraph 31, &gt;&gt; paragraph, &gt;&gt; excuse me. Wow. They're going down in there, &gt;&gt; how perfect it was with the scripture. How Joseph, the younger son, &gt;&gt; rejected of his brethren. Christ rejected of his brethren. He wore a coat of seven colors. Joseph and the seven colors of course represented seven colors in the rainbow which was a covenant and God always has his covenant people. You hear that? He always has his covenant people. And then this one, young Joseph, was killed supposedly by his brethren, and his coat was to be returned to his father. I want to see another thing that he was thrown into the ditch &gt;&gt; and was supposedly be dead, &gt;&gt; but he was taken up from the ditch and was taken into the greatest commercial city of the world and was made the right hand man that no man could either enter into the gate or come into the courts without first coming through Joseph. a perfect type of Christ. They thought they had killed him and throwed him in the grave, but God raised him up. And today he sits at the right hand of medicine and no man can come to God except he come through Christ. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, let me move on. I'm almost done. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So the seven colors of the rainbow &gt;&gt; in order is red, orange, &gt;&gt; yellow, &gt;&gt; green, &gt;&gt; blue, &gt;&gt; indigo, &gt;&gt; and violet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'mma read these things so you can understand. &gt;&gt; They tie right into the virtues. &gt;&gt; Red symbolizes sacrifice and redemption. sacrifice, &gt;&gt; right? And I said that was the first. &gt;&gt; So that's that's faith. Faith in the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Often associated with the blood of Christ. Orange assoc associated with endurance, strength and fire of God, &gt;&gt; virtue. Yellow represents the glory of God and his presence as well as joy and faith and that comes under knowledge, &gt;&gt; right? Faith is knowledge because once you have knowledge who he who he is, you can't help but glorify God and represents joy with faith. Green civilizes life, renewal and growth, often connected to eternal life through Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I could keep going, but let me get to Violet associated with royalty, priesthood, majesty, and the sovereignty of God, which is grace. And so you see by the grace of God, Amen. We are a royal priesthood. Y'all hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Amen. So the last color of the rainbow is violet. This color is associated with royalty, priesthood, majesty. Hallelujah. And sovereignty of God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; So, let me say something to you. &gt;&gt; Moving on. &gt;&gt; The only compass we need is the word. The wise men, they didn't have a compass. &gt;&gt; They followed the star. And everybody couldn't see the star. Only those who were elected to see the star saw the star. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Did you know that light over brother Brandham's head &gt;&gt; is considered a star? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Everybody can't see it. But the point is when you reject the light of God, you are plunged into complete darkness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm trying to get to a particular quote. Let's read this. Uh, coming from the message of grace, &gt;&gt; paragraph 56. &gt;&gt; I'm going shorten this because of the time. But did you not know &gt;&gt; that brother Brandham's ministry &gt;&gt; was a type of Zubable? Amen. And what people don't understand &gt;&gt; is that God gave him that signal &gt;&gt; because he told him &gt;&gt; even if you can get all the people to believe &gt;&gt; they could have what they will. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there were times when brother Baron said, "I give you your healing. I give you this. I give you that." Why? Because he had the signant. &gt;&gt; He had the power of the almighty God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to say this to you. Brother Brandham said, God slipped his wedding band on our finger &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. So, what you don't understand is that you have the same kind of authority of a queen. Amen. But now according to the prophecy, &gt;&gt; there will come the headstone. &gt;&gt; Listen what he says. I want you to notice that. &gt;&gt; When the headstone comes, &gt;&gt; the prince that's going to cry out the message will cry grace. Grace, &gt;&gt; he said the prince. Hallelujah. Amen. For it's by grace are you saved. That's not works, lest any man should boast. &gt;&gt; And the message of grace &gt;&gt; has been tramped under the feet of men until it becomes a disgrace. Some of them run out into eternal security, some out into everything. But the true message of grace remains the same. And there's where Satan tries to knock it out from the church. But the grace of God that we are all saved by. But it's the grace of God that we are all saved by. So in the deity of Jesus Christ, if the Lord God could come there and confirm that this is truth, not only that, but by his word he confirms it's the truth and by signs and wonders he confirmed it's the truth. Then also grace is the truth. Then why could anyone criticize and say that grace is wrong? That we're saved by works. We are saved by grace that through faith, not of works. Works shows that you have been saved. But what grace gives what? But what what saves you is the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Grace saves you. Grace is God. Grace is what God what Grace is what God does for you. Works is what you do for God &gt;&gt; to show appreciation of what God did for you. By grace you are saved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're just going to stop right there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We'll finish this. We'll finish this the next time we see. I don't know what that heat, homeboy, but I'm high. &gt;&gt; God is good. &gt;&gt; So, let's stand. &gt;&gt; Our gracious Father God, &gt;&gt; we thank you for your grace and your mercy. We thank you for your beautiful way of salvation. Surely the natural man could never have seen this. But we so thankful that by your grace and your revelation, &gt;&gt; you have shown to us &gt;&gt; the power of Calvary, &gt;&gt; you have shown to us the power of your love. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We can't even fathom it, Lord. &gt;&gt; But we truly thank you, Lord. And we ask, oh God, that you give us a love &gt;&gt; for you like you love us. &gt;&gt; By doing so, &gt;&gt; I know that I could love my brethren. I can love my sisters and Lord, give you glory in doing so. Grant it, Lord. Let the virtues of God reflect through us like a rainbow in the sky that all men will be able to see it and glorify you, Lord. Let the virtues of Christ, the divine nature of God, &gt;&gt; fill this temple that when they see it, they'll see the white light which is you, Lord, &gt;&gt; and they'll glorify you. &gt;&gt; In your name, Jesus Christ, we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, brother. [Music] So God [Music] God like me. I once was low but now was blind but now I see. It was grace ador my heart to fear and grace my fear. [Music] How preciously [Music] the grace appear.
