like the way it was preached long ago I believe by the grace of the by the grace of God the holy spirit is going to speak in particular way these two scriptures that I want to add before I enter into my message this morning I'm going to read in uh Psalm [Music] 45 I'm I'm reading these scriptures and I'll go straight into preachings some chapter 45 the Bible is going to talk to us something

Casia from the luxurious Palace palaces came the music of string instrument that makes you happy and the last scripture uh I'm going to go a little bit slower I know there will be this message is a special I believe there some people and we going to go slow slow so that we we at least get those that are coming to read read in Isaiah 61 chapter 1 I'm going to read Isaiah chapter 6 61 vers 1 to3 the spirit of The Sovereign Lord is upon me because the Lord has chosen me he has commissioned me to encourage the poor to help the broken broken brokenhearted to decree the release of captive and the free and the freeze freeing of the prisoner to announce the year when the Lord will show his F the day when our God will seek Vengeance to conso all who mourn to strengthen w w w mourn in Zion by giving them the Chan instead of Ashes o ashes oil symbolizing Joy instead of morning a garment symbolizing praise instead of dis discouragement they will be called h of righteousness tree planted by the Lord to reveal his spender God bless these scriptures we are going to talk about the subject about uh what God uh about the question which God asked hadam in G and then the question was where are you theam that I'm talking about now it's not the was in I'm want to make you travel through the thoughts so that we understand why God called you this morning when God called you to this message in this hand time the belie the Believers of this word in this time the thought of God in this same time is to see Adam back to the way he the way he was God wants wants to see Adam get back what he lost at the beginning and that has to happen in the Believers of this time we are living in a time when whatever was given to hadam that time is given back to him in this time I want us to see who was hadam and what was given to hadam by that time before I go into the deepest of this message I want to make you I want to let you see why God uh lead me to this message I'm trying to see like uh the the conscience that God wants you to see it's like it's kind of fed away God when God called you you are seated here you've got a great miss that God gave you it's like you don't see exactly that responsibility that you've been given I saw some good preaching through three weeks ago was preached here brother in the corner there God uses him I don't know if he noticed that but God uses him in special way he came here with the message which makes my heart start beating he said it's the time for you to be put in your in your place in your right right the spirit of adoption that has to come right after God bring again another preacher here and he seated right there I was trying to look around and see where he is and he's right so I was I I was I was I I was listening to him he came here quite slow he came with the with the problem of ano anointing he went slow slow but the OS did not go further but I don't know if he really listened to what the spirit was telling it was a a greatest message that I I I listen to that after him I saw somebody else I was listening what is the spirit trying to speak and he said now is the time that we got the right to eat the our right to eat those M that message was because there's hidden man that is not for everybody that is reserved for those uh uh the the the priest oh those for the priest that is reserved for the priest that are being anointed those those those priests they have to eat those maners in a in a holy place now what am I observing my sisters brother you might see God do something for you but you don't understand what is going on we are in the AG where our brother Bram said God God is is badly is badly heard it's like people they don't understand really what God is really trying to do it's like he said we are in the Hedge where God is trying to move every gift that he has to make people understand but people is like they are looking in the v those message they they had something that God brought to us and this morning I just came to get those message and try to make it clear Isaiah said God your God anointed you he anointed you with the anointment of Joy those anointment it put you above all the all your colleagues now listen listen to this word oh God your God anointed you which God again God anointed another God he said that's why he said oh God your God anointed you now you are seated here you don't know if you don't know whether you God or not now I want to tell you this morning God who people he calling you God now put you in the position of God he anointed you with an special ano those anointment come upon you above all the above all your all the all the positions of this world it's the anointment of Joy it's not anointment of suff it's not anointment of you are not like any other man this world God called you Heaven the heaven you Heaven called you God it's not a pre the Creator he called you God what is going to differ between you and this people of this world difference God anointed you everything in this world you are the person who has Authority this world if if God anointed you it's not this lotions it's not anointment which is like a lotion now the problem which is here the big Spirit the spirit of God is upon me what what spirit is etal that eternal spirit that eternal spirit anointed that anointment is nothing else but the eternal spirit God in form of desend upon human and that human anointed by God heaven and you are not the same as everybody from this morning from this morning I want to walk like God on this earth when God created the first man this world his name wasen now look at what God did it was the first time when God anointment and and put upon now you can see was anointed with nothing else but the anointment of God now now for God he needed to Adam spes to obey he can he can speak something and that thing happens when God created you cannot give you cannot give me the spiritual di when God called lion is lion when God called leard now in things of it's God of this Earth Adam who gave the names God amen was part to God in in Divine God God his part in Divinity andem also at his own part in Divinity so those divinity when we put them together it makes the whole divinity through so he created H he created hadam ham had his had Divinity in him that led him to name the to name everything he said this is a man this is a leopard this is lion and that was Divinity which was connected connected to God himself when God created the first man at the beginning the message fundamental of the fath of the faith okay okay and he said when God created the first man created him above everything on this Earth gave him the jurisdiction of this Earth he gave him the authority of everything he control he control he control the fish he he control the ha and the Wis that's where the spirit want us to be anointed you and they restore you like head you are you are above everything on this Earth you see look he said he he can he control everything created a he was he was created a God on this Earth he was given the power to control everything he was controlling even the stuff of this world God give had given a big uh big Authority not small Authority but big Authority he had even the authority to make choices when God created him he was he was superficial you see brother say when you see these people out there uh we call them like Sinners they can do whatever they want you see they can even go further with sciences and trying to make some create make something create something out of nothing what made them to do that is the same Authority see that was given by God unto them like Gods so they had that ability to create something and that was coming from God now look at everything was obeying even every nature was obeying the was obeying the human when you a man fall down that he has he had on this he became unconscious of reality the sin that made it make him become unconscious of the authority that he was given he did not have that reality again in his life the relation the relationship between him and God was was no more [Applause] there the the communion which was between Adam and God because Adam could talk and God answer him back now today you can see there even believers who does not know does not know that God answers m now brother say today if you are a Believer who does who does not speak to God and let God answer you back don't call yourself a Believer lost that communion between him and God those those let me say those word ways which was in Adam the ways in which Adam could talk to God and God answer him back those ways were are closed now look at that situation and that state of what was Adam in God at the beginning God sent Jesus to come and die on the cross for Jesus has to become a redeemer who has to die and redeem us now look at this all look at these churches in the world all the churches they worship Jesus Jes because Jesus in our places Jesus died because he want to redeem us and return us back to the position the position of Adam in the in the garden of no there's two things in the first thing is Jesus was supposed to pay the price of sins now the second thing is Jesus has to take us back to the position where we are supposed to [Music] now when now I come back to the message which brother spoke last time he wanted to speak about the inheritance and he spokes about inheritance about his mother the price of those uh those the price of those things things is something else now getting those things now to possess those things is something else again his parent bought those things and pay for him to go and get those things Jesus already paid the price cry is about to go and get those things and the resurrection of Jesus Christ is something that you have to share Jesus died because that anointment which was on him has to come let me tell you good news since the beginning since the Genesis until today today when God now is getting those to us the title of the Hors of this world because Adam was God on this he lost those author now those Authority went back to God in order to wait for the men who are supposed to get it back again we go through the old those titles were not given given Jesus came and died those title were not given given back now if you you the place Seven Seals Dimension it's the authority it's the adoption it's not

the uh the the white light the white light it was light that is the light you called the pillars of fire and I'm asking question now I'm asking you a question do you believe that the same God who

the beginning the same realize that that's the the one US is he can cre something us here the healing and creating the power that God is giving us back is it can create let me give you another good news sat he cannot create Satan can per given to you to that shame to devil he has no no Authority no ano he doesn't have the attribute as a Creator if you just recognize or realize your position you can see the devil running away from you you can chase the devil like a small dog you can chase the demons like small dogs not like the son of Adam who's there being shaken by demons I see I see that being being stabilized in the life our brothers and sisters the message is the message is the challenge challenging the the devil and everything which is demonic now when I'm talking like this he's listening and I know what what I'm fighting brother I'm giving you the it was a part of something which they called of Eternal and this the Great Space of Eternity that great space of Eternity is

name was is in the book of but Judas did not have the Holy there don't sit there God speaking to you trying to reveal something to you but you there like you don't see anything I'm always someone who now when I'm going to get out of here and when my colleagues come back again because we want to see the Believers in their POS have ours because we are going to fight [Music] him I'm reading paragraph you see there were a first man he was called God were were called him a light now what I want you there that person who was resembling the the the cloud the White Cloud the first thing we see coming out of Eternity was God as a spirit the second man and brother called them the men the second man who went out of Eternity was a Legos it was just the pill of fire and the third man I want you to observe it was like a white cloud that third person is what is called the S of the man that is eternal and thus God the thir man the White Cloud went out and became part of the Adam that was in the saw of Adam to invest him as a God on Earth but abam said I want you to observe that de man who went out of Eternity like a white cloud and diamond is the soul Eternal one amen aded man is what is called the Holy Spirit I'm reading the message that thir person is what is called the holy spirit amen I want you now to observe that third person amen I can see that Holy Spirit coming down and he is all man that is the S of a man Eternal then the book of the life of the possessions of that it has the form that the heart and that is the only spirit it's not the baptis spirit of the spirit it is anointing not what I'm talking to the Satan we are not we are God Amen when I'm talking about this it is the revolution of my fa it does change has to give us some Victory and today God called us this position is anointing those position when you just get those you are not a man oh God what good message etal spirital spirit anointed me so that I I Proclaim good news to poor there's a there's a there's a day of Vengeance who you is going to to receive that Vengeance because you are untouchable president America is being guarded by Immortal and put a lot of things above there security see those angels when says if those Angels Came they go back no they just came forever they never went back to to Heaven around here you even the devil cannot do anything to you when the the cloud came even the the Angels Came also so those Eternal Angels if there's a man there there's a man stand on the on Earth and this cloud of Angel the the cloud coming and the the Eternal Angels Came and they went you think that is a is just a a normal from period of time every man like is just like every man no from that period of time man already abam said he had a soul of the The King The Sword of the king and said when he pronounce d word that went out within him he did not hear any voice outside of him but the voice came out of him with the sword of the the king in other dimension living dimension in human bar yes and we saw Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen the restoration ofen all the demons they knew that if you don't know what the message is we are going to are who God who among us if you like personal experience that is that is the where are you the one who's inside the voice is is saying oh God your God anointed you person seen he he darkened like is the soul which was in him is it becomes dark thatness enter into him that's why God sent Jesus for that blood of Jesus that has to remove all the the sins that was in heart of a person that is the redemptions of a man the blood of Jesus by the blood of Christ who cleanses us from the sin we become Sons Daughters of God and the Holy Spirit comes into man and drives the Blackness the sin away from him amen amen that's God today is redemption why I'm a holy when the spirit upon me I I fall down I begin rolling rolling like that we see we we we see that when Adam when Adam sinned you realize that he is not in the presence of God again he went and make some leaves and he tried to cover himself with those leaves instead of Adam go back to his father and ask father where are you hide himself and tried to make a religion and failed to keep that presence of God that's the word from my brother much attention to the way you are keeping that presence of God Adam did he he went and make a religion hide in that religion you here not to make a religion pay much attention you are trying to live in the presence of God you have some sin that you haven't conf yet you are living in the way contrary to the word and you came here trying to I'm a Believer I believe the message I believe I am the member of the church that is nothing for God God want the he wants to seees your he wants to see in your life he wants to see the Holy Spirit your life where are you ahead that voice has to follow you where wherever you go if you've worked hard for the Holy Spirit the other voice has to follow oh God your God now do not remain in that position and do nothing I'm reading two scriptures and I finish by by upon those scriptures me I I've got an habit of repeating what brother Bram so that no man can say that preacher said this no I don't want that it is something come from God I'm in the message the God of this evil H these two scriptures they touch my heart all night the God of this evil H listen to The Prophet how many service do you have this today two I'm going to stop because there's another service so I'm going to stop after St and give you some time to go and think something that we can do two the first one is God of this H paragraph 70 I beginning from if there's germination of Life natural life and having life inside you're going to see that life is going to trans transmit itself from from father to a son I want to go straight the point if you you have the germination of which was in Christ you must see the trans transmission the transmission that was into you [Music] what what we are seeing here it means had germination from my father that that that life has transmitted so that I may be seen like if you are a chosen one you must have that germination etal germination that you have has to be something that the same our our Natural Life there some there some way where our life is is trans that came out of our fathers and that was transm through our Natural Life the same way for the spirit of God in in his in his fullness [Music] come it has come to an elevated point when he manifested in a body called Jesus through that body God paid the the price of my sins and I was in him when Jesus died the chosen one were inside Jesus when he rose again when he again and I was him when he rose again now realize how the resurrection came there was a body on the cross of Calvary inside that body there was a a soul and that Soul move out of that body and enter into the called that is the it went into the H I may try to have some image like Satan was in me demons and they were trying to re Victory Jesus Jesus on the they are feasting we during the same time they having fath in there was a captain of the army of God entering that place when the devil is trying to have meeting they didn't they did not they did not that key which is the key for uh to control life and death he went in the [Music] hell K the he KCK the door now it's like Satan not out all now in the days of P given to the church now we because were taken away from Satan all the holies of were there in Paradise they saw a person Daniel jump and say look at there's a there's a hand without the the hand person saw that stone that went on the top of mountain without any of any man and I saw that man also he the person who to visit us he saw the message of he fre waiting there at that time it was part of hell what did that that anointing that Resurrection Jesus come out of res The Same Spirit which it's the same spirit that open the now if that spirit is going toise no listen first there you were when he he got now today God has given that transmitted that to you so that you live that that Authority because you have to be in that body now we are seated in him we have that we have that authority over every demon I'm repeating we are seated in him having Power Authority every demon everyon every demon you haveth everyon whatever this anointing you have this it's not future now it's now if you can realize kind of authority God if you can believe what God has given you if you are SE there and you don't have that you are sit there and you don't believe that it can't do anything if you are SE there you don't believe that if you are SE there and you don't have it can't do anything amen and he if you have that and you are afraid of acting you are not going to use that any anyhow you may have that and you are afraid of using that and then it's going to [Music] pass I want to use that God has given me reive and we should have that that's where we are that Holy Spirit but they don't use it they don't have it they just sited there mess to make sure that we use that given us if you don't this is a chance given to you that you you search for it you look for it look at look at was there was was reasen when God inp of magic Magan and there was a anointing coming in the in the Moses I'm going to send you so that he sent Moses to far so that the power which anointed Moses Pro in the world a God above all magic our life God so that you what God [Applause] you you don't use it there are them to you you what given in [Music] my I'm telling you this anointing send me to free witchcraft all things God us that israelit he said let There was Magan who's God who's God now he said I'm going to prove you not go to read the Bible he start reading like God says God says no he had something I say look at your hand what do you have in your hand what do you have in your hand you see a snake that is snake and it was magic here that look at that he don't worry we going and they also the same there were small snakes one the snake swallow swallow all the powers of devil we have the power which which swallows we we have the power which swallowers of Satan yes sir we can swallow the of sat when look at that said we are at that point we are also in that position God wants to put us in that position now the last scripture confirmation and the evidence 4 I'm I'm going to tell you one one before I read it when I was in Africa God told me I I haven't I haven't called you so that you mixed up with the other what other people [Music] doing a lot of churches that I saw that country he has a church but he's fighting with the other Pastor in that church that other Pastor he has a church but he's fighting with other Pastor in that other church that's the thing I saw and God told me don't enter those kind of thing now I looking looking for for the of I want to know what position should I have in in God now now there was something that God told me I had some ministers and preachers who were gu how to pray how to look for the of God how to listen to the the voice of spirit now God told us I I don't want you to enter into the destruction of this church and the religion this time here is time of adoption of sons now what I want to do on this Earth those people who are in those who are who is mine I'm going to put something in his life which is going to confirm my be the son you are not going to see there some people there there says I'm going to are and that has to happen in adoptions of the son that's what I'm talking about listen to me now it has to come
