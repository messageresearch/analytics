offerings god is good to us amen we'll move on by god's grace victory in jesus 255 and then we'll go right on into the word of god continue to pray for brother isaac he called in this morning not feeling so well and i really appreciate [Music] his calling and allowing us to know that he's not doing well and he thought that he should come as it as it were by god's grace and we'd like to say that to everybody you know if you got if you got symptoms of any kind that's that that's like covet stay home because there's a brother won't call his name ministered up there in a church i better not say the area but he came in he brought the kovic everybody got sick right it's real and one person died so i say those things that you know so you'll know let's love one another if you can't get us on be here catch us online because i i do believe with with everything going on and i don't believe any of us would do that i just don't but i'm just throwing that out there so you'll know that everybody don't have the faith that you have some people are weaker and so we want to protect the church and protect ourselves and and know by god's grace that uh that we're just gonna do uh basically uh what god would have us to do um like i said we don't want to make anybody sick and god has been good to us as far as i know none of us have had it and if you did have it praise the lord you're still here so just uh knowing how god is so good to us and i guess uh we thank god for his grace let's sing the song and we're getting right into the word of god [Music] is [Music] yes gonna speed it up a little bit that's a little bit too slow for me some of y'all still sleep it's too slow for you two [Music] uh [Music] is [Music] me [Music] [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] me [Music] hmm [Music] and all that love now that first tempo was the right tempo but i wanted to speed it up feed it up a little bit you love the lord we'll get right on into the word of god amen you love the lord god is so good to us we uh have our brother blake here but he won't uh speak until after i'm done he um he's a friend of mine brother and uh some of you have seen him once or twice but he has uh something he wants to make known to you all after a minister and we'll have him come up during that time so anyhow let's go right into the word i'm glad to see everybody here to this morning we started on a message the other night face to face uh we'll be ministering something different this evening we also will be having communion and so uh this evening against well for those who like to have communion but anyway we we want to start uh the service off uh with the 2nd john the 12th first 2nd john 12 1st where we started uh wednesday wednesday sometimes i get mixed up with the days because of the way things are going but nevertheless amen i really believe that we're getting ready to embrace the greatest thing ever on earth uh a translation of a bride and um with everything's happening the way let me say it like this and some of y'all might not even realize it but in america we don't we've never had a coup but we just experienced one and um but it was done in such a intellectual way many people don't even realize what have taken place but nevertheless god's will be done um you know it's amazing i i could say some things but i don't want to go political here but i want to say by god's grace nothing happens by chance everything is ordained of god and it's never what we desire to be is it's what god has already planned to be and i'm happy you know because we've got a prophet who told us uh what this thing was going to evolve into and now we have by god's grace uh uh a woman who could possibly become the president eventually so and if you if these things don't stir you i don't know what will you know we're living in the last days and and you better understand by god's grace god ain't waiting on nobody the bride has got to make herself ready and if you don't make yourself ready it's nobody's fault but your own and it's not according to your knowledge that god don't care about knowledge that's what got us in trouble from it from the beginning knowledge god is looking for born again believers people who are filled with the holy ghost who's looking and loving his appearance you love the lord you know we look at these things and we i think to myself at what point in time is it going to click in our minds at what point in time we're going to get on fire for god uh because you know it's evident that we're not there yet but don't worry the squeeze will come and that's the part that's the part that i'm afraid uh if there is nothing in you when the squeeze come there is nothing that will come out of you you know peter didn't have it and he followed jesus for three and a half years right and when the squeeze came he came up void he wanted to fight and jesus told peter after you are converted strengthening your brethren i'm so sorry there's no one to come uh okay you're gonna do it okay well we need somebody that's going to interpret a little something you may not be really good at it but some people still need to know what i'm talking about i could see that look on your face like what is he saying so by god's grace amen we'll try our best to take it slow so so uh brother isaac can catch what i'm saying i'm really excited i'm ready i'm really ready to preach but we'll do our best trying to keep it slow mode because having many things to write unto you having many things to write unto you i would not write with paper and ink but i trust to come unto you and speak face to face that our joy may be full okay proverbs 27 19. those of you who brought your bibles feel free to turn sir um even if you don't read it at least you'll show the devil whose side you're home as in water face answers to face sow the heart of man to man come down lowly visit upon visas and see the current the lord upon occurred alone let's read the 20th verse hell and destructions are never full so the eyes of man are never satisfied the members you're the long son insatiable let us pray father god we come before you we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so real to us that have not been pleasing in that side please please forgive us lord cleanse us from all unrighteousness and anoint us with your holy spirit with it on this week in your name jesus christ amen as we were saying uh on wednesday we cannot stay where we are and when i say uh that concert i am speaking spiritually we know that god is coming for a bride without spot wrinkle or blemish for god to in order for you to go farther with god because christ has done everything and now it's up to you the bible tells us the [Music] what city are you talking about heaven hallelujah hallelujah only though blood washed silky jointed the holy ghost filled i'm pretty sad saints of god descended you will make a translation you're all on the left hallelujah hallelujah we have come up through the seven church ages and now the capstone grace grace because the word of god tells us in the 23rd psalm let's turn them down psalms 23. you love the lord let's go who's in medicine yeah god is doing something but we're going to start from the first verse of the 23rd song the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the steel waters he restores my soul he leadeth in the path of righteousness for his name's sake according to so now he is doing the leading his namesake though i walk through the valley and of the shadow of death no evil thou art with me thyroid and thy staff that will let you know with me why does david work when he says i feel no evil because it is the word that comforts me this is where we're going right here now preparing a table before me to dress the one more in table in the presence of mine enemies on first measure versus thou unknown with my head with oil she won't do it in my tent my cup run it over the board this is where we're going just alone now prepare the table to address it one more time before me divorce in the presence of my enemies in other words god is set a table and when you go to commune it goes and when you go to fellowship with anyone a comfortable community and you're sitting at a table it is it is a communication communication between two or more people uh the entrepreneurship person face and that's why i don't like text messages because i cannot see your face see your face tells the story you can't lie to people if a person knows how to read he knows how to read your face he said your body language gives you away every time you tell a lie a tumor but when you're talking face to face one of the rudest thing for a person to do when you're looking for an answer from them right the moment they look away when a man or a woman is speaking in your it is a discussion description it is something that god has prepared you got to understand this david said you prepared the table before me told us [Music] and you see you say well what do you mean brother brooke if we did uh this is my best artwork that's it that's it more now if it's if it's more detailed than this i'm in trouble i am not an artist the holy spirit can fall in your spirit the sentence we pray the son that is preached and you're still not converted [Music] that is why so many of the pentecostals could have all of those sensations and still reject the message of the hour hallelujah but now we are in the soul of something somebody help me here recommend we are now coming into the place of the throne room is that right it's your soul that god is concerned [Music] the one who says in his heart god in the supernatural [Music] it was no longer [Music] it's the age of perfection because when god strikes the soul what's it called with that gene seed in the soul [Music] glory to god you're perfect [Music] don't even hear it right some of y'all make more god or you're going to doubt god oh hallelujah the pressure that's getting ready to come on the earth will cause you to either believe god god who do men say i the son of man jeremiah jeremy elias one of the one of the prophets let the prophet but who do you say that i am and peter said thou art the christian hallelujah is that right because when the pressure came on you on the sentence you have no power by the force to fight the pressure that's coming on the earth do you understand that what we have elected what is now in our solution [Music] of the politics has come to destroy christians hello hello they come to destroy you evie you are the hold up you and i are the hindrance to what they want to believe you me they are coming after you if you don't have the power of the holy ghost you said you're going to do just like peter did that you're going to deny it that you ever knew this message that's why it's important that's important is that right that's invite hope told brother branham uh hope idea you continue to preach the holy ghost do i continue the process through the sentence that is the message hallelujah paul said you can understand all mysteries you could have faith to move mountains you can give them body to be burned okay god is good to us isn't he jerry born face to face and and this is why the bible tells us that we shall see him as he is the word of god according to first john 3. we're going to read the first and second verse the truth of the matter is a lot of us have been a part of a system unfair proud dance system and you don't want to acknowledge it but it's true anyway so many of us believe that if we believe brother branham is the prophet that guarantees that's a ticket in heaven millions believed that moses was a problem and in hell they lift up their eyes even though we needed that ma'am based on this they give us understanding of the day that we're living in god don't care about your traditions hallelujah who can outdo the jews fair much when it comes to traditions they're still faithful to their traditions it was their traditions that made them miss christianity and your traditions if you're not careful jesus christ oh my is that true even paul says i've got to be careful i become a cast away first john behold wait what manner of love the father had bestowed upon us that we should when you call the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not in resolve because [Music] men who suffer when he shall appear lost he shall be like him as he is hallelujah hallelujah you know even to this day [Music] tradition and that tradition will send you straight to heaven he said tradition god don't care about where we came from he don't care who your in here who's never been born again all kind of jews now did they clarks on the street y'all understand what i mean by that for this question if you are born a jew you got jewish blood hallelujah you still ain't related not to god jesus christ jesus christ was the blood of god until his son did you and mary and joseph israel had nothing to do with it very yet i feel i've accepted so even if you're a jew see memphis it was a dream it doesn't guarantee you haven't seen it many jews are in hell right now are we must not allow ourselves to be did i finish reading that yeah oh let's let's read the second verse beloved now we the sons of god may not concern and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know when jesus christ came conscious in 1963 in the clouds what did he show guess you know he did not come in the form of his body in a bathroom it should have formed this one he came in the form of his headship he lived reduced to that form the image of the cloud the masjid was the face of jesus christ now it was the beginning of the translation come on smart did i left hallelujah people said well i'm waiting on the rapture but i'm in the rapture just sweetie why because god is changing me from glory to glory to glory and one of these old days this mortal shall put on immortality and the word of god in the holy of holies of transformation turned aaron's rod into a living and not being we are living in a time people are not taking this message seriously you're supposed to lay in the presence of the sun are you supposed to pray you're supposed to fast you're supposed [Music] [Music] you understand me complaining the bible says amen when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is he what is it he's the same yesterday today and forever word of god hallelujah and you must become the world if we avoid it todd you you know we don't know when the gentile door is going to come out you don't know but once it's shut fulfillment that means there's no more entrance specifically hello i don't understand where i have to i'm not speaking politics but let me let me say this do you know that's good even israel is shaking in her shoes because they know ask yourself that this let me say that this regime amen it's going to come after them everything that has been established this is the last administration will be undone you see what it is the devil is coming after the raw you'll see yeah yeah that's the most not only the jews and where are you you need to change the relationship you need to stop this carnality that we got going on focus and refocus every one of us know how difficult it is right now is that right three things you're battling twice yourself lust of the flesh and the pride of life i and if god can't lead you like a lamb he's going to drive you like cattle i'm not saying you're not bride it's in deepak but i'm going to tell you something measure proof of deacon if god spewed laodicea out of his mouth it seems like he said a church that once was on fire legally involved you become lukewarm you literally become detrimental to the body of christ is that right you affect the body of christ and on judgment god will judge you oh yes is that what what happened to eight cans this is us he came was a part of the bride he was a part of joshua's ministry and joshua says don't you take nothing of the inhabitants don't you add nothing hallelujah and what did he do he thought he could have some secret sins most people don't see what you're doing god sees what you're doing that's the anointing of this church hallelujah hey the song leader can't make you come up to level you and i are supposed to come in here with joy coming here with victory are we coming here all sad times that didn't take much energy praise the lord oh i feel like i'm so tired it doesn't take much the amen always amen the amen god is good y'all don't i'm gonna keep on preaching just just hold on now i'm gonna go here at least to genesis 32. face to face don't you want to talk to him face to face nobody has ever been able to do that moses did it the bible william branham had a ministry where he talked to god william i mean he said god is now here he'll remember him at night and god's intention is for us to talk to him hallelujah amen by the holy spirit in the sentence god wants us to talk to him face to rebellion face of us let me ask you a question how many of you come here have been laid by god i take only about you not by scripture but god told you exactly what he wanted you to do my jeopardy exactly and you did it and it happened what is that that's a space-to-face encounter god talking to you and you talking back to god those are the kind of experiences we need to be experiencing hallelujah glory to god jacob the 24th verse earlier and jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day a long number and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the howl of the stars of jacob as he wrestled bless me hallelujah we knew esau was coming inside was coming [Music] you know the thing is yeah we allow ourselves be imprisoned by the enemy a bad habit is demon empowerment oh i wish i could stop the problem is the devil has you enslaved the poem on his club hello the devil have you enslaved hallelujah listen equity this message it's a messiah came to break and destroy all changes [Music] change chains of slavery every kind of perverted chain god is here to destroy it says to chant perverted this message service has come to do that it's a very new affair am i speaking truth yes hallelujah hallelujah that's the kind of one i'm not looking for that's it hallelujah i was trying to see whether you had your eyes open or what but nevertheless move on i'm not gonna be much longer this is this is just part two but i i've got something different this evening so you can come if if you feel led only god knows but anyway usually it's just a few of us in the in the evening time um hallelujah hallelujah 26th verse and he said let me go for the daybreaker and he said i would not let it go bless me get your name and jacob said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob jacob did i say that right yes and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob jacob and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob jesus prayer please as the in other words you've got to prevail over god no not that yeah when do you want me to get rid of the frogs the uh couple you know frogs is an unclean spirit and you know what you're saying you know what the egyptian says but in your spirit you know what you say i'll be to deliver tomorrow you know what the speakers because we did it it's already delivered and you know what tomorrow is not promised there are young people are dying just like old legends you know why i'm preaching like this i feel an urgency your and if i didn't care i wouldn't be here this is but i feel an urgency look how long you've been christian regardless let me rephrase that let me rephrase that that where are you what in your christian war and how long have it taken you a community where you are now poor it took them 40 years [Music] sanctification is a process sanctification is a template you understand me and some of us are still holding on to things that we should not be holding on to well he said on some supposing hallelujah you know and the 30th first let me drop there and jacob called the name of the place peniel jacob i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved hallelujah hallelujah what was it met god and god had a direct channel to him how many of y'all never had direct channels that's what you hallelujah how many times have god awaken you committed don't you have salvation and say get up and pray for you heard his voice and you say to god everyday give me five more minutes you think god is gonna be put on hold on do you really think god is going to be put on hold on foreign and then when you take your five minutes it takes 15 to 20. it comes whenever and you expect god to be just waiting there till you get up it was expected god is perfection god is am i is this too simple that's it though but here we are in the message for translation and we're not even sanctified help us lord hey new senior we need the shekinah glory like i said the other day when i was preaching it is the outer court in other words when you're on the out when you're on the outer court let me approach that right not talking about the flesh i'm talking about the holy place when you're in the holy place that's your spirit that's about to speak that's your spirit i see what's expected i know i'm holy well i just watched you hello hello peter said lord i'll not deny you i'll stand for you i'll die for you and when the pressure came peter did not take away peter's position but you must be born again don't let oh well i'm justified as though i never sinned in the first place that's what the devil used on youtube just like he used the scripture jesus on each that justification doesn't fully come in justification do you get the holy ghost uh uh on plane um hello you just want to be but you need the holy ghost y'all better listen to me i don't care whether you like me after the service or not i'm looking at him right now i'm trying to help you my point is amen we're we're getting ready to have a body change and you're still he gave us these iphones and these ipads and these dances his iphones his ipads and and we just oh my god all right no no no no no i'm not whirly no but you're looking at all these worldly things it shows one day nobody sees you yeah but god made you y'all understand what i'm saying the devil is so smart like they say he took the movie and he shrunk it he put it in the box he took that box and he shrunk it because he wanted more people to have it so he put it into a phone hallelujah and now your phone number for the telephone y'all don't know what i'm talking about when the first phone came out it was twice the size it did differ did you all know that let's go for this we used to have it on our shoulder right we thought we was cool cool you know flash the phone it's the truth so what the devil does he says i got to get these christians because i feel secretly i can't get them to look at what i want them to feel if you ain't got the holy ghost you shouldn't have one sentence well i'm going to give give them to my children to keep them from going out into the world and they in the world in your house on the phone if you constantly eat ice cream what's going to happen to you let's see this ice cream you're going to get that throw some cake in there too right brother i should tell you guys it's going to check i know this is simple but i'm trying to get over to you you can't say i'm in the third pool everybody like living in the second or the first it was a manifestation it was yeah beyond what they saw in pentecost this is no joke and it's really happening but it's just a small group of people a small number of people that this thing is happening to and a lot of us don't even know what's happening this is why the rapture takes place there'll be a lot of people so called in the message won't even know it's taking place in back to my thought and i'ma let you go how do you know how do you know that god is in your soul because in your soul there are no feelings there are no emotions so how are you going to know [Music] god was behind the veil even the priesthood remember to the people they thought the ark of the covenant was behind the man but when jesus died and the veil was written from top to bottom there was no ark to see because the ark had already been taken away from israel [Music] history tells you that when when the veil was rent there was no ark that's where it was hanging on the cross even the replica of the ark of the covenant was not behind the curtain in jerusalem but they faked it they don't uh just like the pentecostals and all of the rest of these religions they're faking it like jesus is dead hallelujah somewhere you must come to see him face to face hallelujah i i'm trying to close this thing but when rebecca mcconnell she was on she she she was on that camel amen and brother brown said that camel represented the holy ghost hallelujah hallelujah and i got a real quote i want to quote before i stop but when she saw isaac that means when she met isaac ridiculously the only face she saw on you search for his face hello hello why do you think jesus came in this last day we shall see him as he is the word and you are the body of christ which must be the word as well unadulterated unhybrid it has to be the real word all right i'm gonna close on this there's no way i can finish what is what is the shekinah glory guess girl i grew up this is what i love about balakai's a minute malachi's foreign ministry he preached but he waited on him but i thought he was inside he was insane amen but he was looking for the very person the manifestation of god himself the elohim the father call him the spirit whatever you want to call him he was waiting on that mighty angel right there were times he couldn't even remember what he said he was so yielded to the holy spirit until he had to go back to find out what he had said hallelujah he was so yielded to the holy spirit that god was able to use his mouth his mind and his spirit take a public jesus this is where god wants us to be that's the secret so yielded to his holy spirit that we're dead to ourselves brother said it like this what is this glory to god to break beyond the veil see who god is standing before you see who god is standing here before us we'll walk you to jerusalem of fire on the first he is veiled in human flesh he's so foreign but what does the kinda what did it do i guess god finished it seed the word that we're to live on in this day by these promises the kind of glory ripens like brothers that's your bread families brings it to me bread to the believer elephant the show bread ripen the show bread you must understand that the show break when it was brought in by the priest constitution was half this that's why the prophet god said it like this you cannot read this bible like a newspaper in order to get the revelation of this bible that's why you got theologians right now who still believe that god is three and not one can i finish this let's go put down this one the shoebread seed word let me let me not yet shoe bread brings it to pass that amen let me let me start back for brother by these promises the shekinah glory ripens to show bread and brings it to pass makes it bread to the believer that lay in the pages of the bible year after year the word for this age the denominations like they do nominations stumbling block to the denomination they stumble jones knox all stumbled at it dude but what it is to be done in the last days what is to reveal get get scared it means to bring forth see i'm in it what malachi fought to do to turn back the people from the stumbling block to break down the traditions and to reveal the bread with the shekinah glory watch it ripens regardless and produce just exactly what is said it will do exactly do you understand what he's saying the ripened bread the bank of malachi 4. we'll produce what is said it's going to produce but if you read it without the anointing without this kind of glory will not produce everything must be mixed with fire exactly every sacrifice had to have the fire sacrifice the bread had to have the fire everything has to have the fire hallelujah i'm almost done just this last quote watch it ripens and produced just exactly what he said it would do exactly the shoe bread for this age to the denominations a stumbling block a bunch of fanaticism fanatics but we who believe menu but now amen as revelation 10 is promised all the mysteries of god that's been hidden in the pages down through them would of the seymour right on two years now out to tucson be north of tucson what would take place the seals would be open the seals that revealed these things back just as he said what is it it shows it cannot be man it hits perfectly perfect just as
