grace [Music] because amen [Music] amen would go right on into the scriptures thank God for the song service we are appreciate the word of God and all that God is doing we understand by God's grace that we're nothing within ourselves but it's the grace of God that makes us what we are and Who We Are we're going to ask that you turn with us to Psalms the ninth chapter and we'll begin to read the 9th and 10th verse that ninth chapter the ninth division of Psalms and then from there we like to go to Isaiah 40 29 and 31. Psalms 9 9 through 10. the Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge in times of trouble and they that Know Thy Name will put their trust in thee for thou thou Lord has not forsaken them that seek thee Isaiah 40 29 31. he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength everybody there yet my apology Isaiah 40 29 31. I just read it again he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increased his strength even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as Eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint let's pray our gracious father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us words cannot express our gratitude for Lord we know our daily walk and we also know that it was it without your grace we're nothing and we would all perish your Holiness beyond anything that we can comprehend and therefore Lord this is why we cry God give us more of yourself because the only way that we could ever be holy is that the holy God is living in US it's not by power not by might but by your holy spirit says the Lord bless this service Lord as we cry for you as we yearn within our hearts to have more of you to come to that completion in this last hour we ask oh God that you look beyond our faults and see our needs granted Lord in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated one thing I I'd say about the Bible since the fall I believe every generation has had trouble before the fall everything was beautiful perfect Sublime beyond that but since the fall of Man has been Wars and wars and rumors of wars I thought about the time that we're living in now many people are saying you know uh we almost ready to have world war three but I want to Enlighten you tonight we are already engaged I know many of you don't look at the news and that's perhaps good because your hiding place is not in a building or a shelter you're hiding places in Christ and we know that the whole world is turned upside down politically economically show sociably everything is out of whack and it's all the result because the world refused and turned down Jesus Christ who was the only answer to all of their problems we know that in the last days many people even today don't believe that the the this is the last days these are the last days they can't comprehend it because they don't want to believe the Bible and they've taken God out of school and God out of churches and God out of everything everything has become a social some kind of social political lodging but God didn't come to give us that he came to give us life and I don't know about you I think about death and life every day I'm aware that my God sees everything he knows everything about me and and so therefore I don't try to lie to him or myself I am what I am but I realized by God's grace that out of all the people in the world billions trillions I don't really know how many people there are but I do know one thing God has had favor on us when God show you himself and reveals himself to you you are above the richest man in the world because everything is going to perish everything that you lose now that may seem to be beautiful it may seem you know to be something that will endure well history has proven to us nothing endures but the word of God we had a great Egypt we had a great Babylon we had a great role we had a great Greece my question [Music] is tonight where are they now but out of all the kingdoms that Satan has tried to destroy this Kingdom that God has established cannot be destroyed he has tried to separate us divide us and Conquer us and by God's grace we realize that his work is in vain because no matter what trick he tries God is still in control and God Is predestinated Us and elected us and chosen us to be victorious but dealing with all day many people don't realize the time that we're living in is trouble sometime and I don't know I guess people think it's going to get better that's not what the word of God says I'm not to hear to preach to you doom and gloom I'm coming to encourage you because what we're getting ready to face we cannot face these things alone you need God we've told we've been told and we understand the parable of Matthew 25 about the five wise and the five foolish and one of the things that these virgins had to do was trim their lamps that means to take away everything that will hinder the light of God from being seen we know the story fire was wise and fire was foolish five of them represent church people who allowed the cares of this world to choke the life of God out of them and at a time when they should have been shining or the lamps should have been burning we found out that they it went out understand what that means when your lamp goes out that means you are in darkness like Peter said amen if these virtues one of them if they don't abound in you if they don't live in you 'll continually forget that you've actually been saved but we find out by God's grace Jesus was going to come in a way that they themselves wouldn't be able to see theologians doctors of divinity and all of the church World everybody's saying that God is coming Jesus is coming but if you watch Matthew 25 you'll find out how he was going to come and the Bible said that he would come as the son of man son of man means Prophets and when the prophet came they failed to see that it wasn't a man but was God fulfilling his word god interprets his own word and when the son of man would come it would be a time of lap trimming not a time of Revival but a lot a time of mourning a time of prayer a time of getting rid of all of the junk out of your life a time of sanctification a time of feeling yourself with the Holy Ghost so much so that when it's all said and done the Bible said the wise virgins had all an extra oil where did they get the extra off from the Bible also tell us that at midnight there will come a shout and we know that the shout is the message that's the extra oil see they had the Holy Spirit but they needed more of him because this was the time of perfection this is the time that God will incarnate himself in people called them bride called them the word amen he would take his nature and put his in these people that is the extra oil let us know let us not be deceived brother William said he has already come and they did to to him what was listed talking about Jesus but understand he's the same yesterday today and forever see but they think there's a Revival it is happening no it's done and dead is over uh-huh notice this is left trimming time coming out and going in going in where into that holies of holies going into the Shekinah Glory Hallelujah but you got to trim your lamps right because remember in the Holy place the labs could be smogged up they could get dirty with all of the you know all of the smoke and soot and everything else and if those priests weren't careful those lamps could go out but they had to periodically trim those lamps so the fire would burn Hallelujah understand that Ministry was the ministry of men but in the whole years of holies it's the ministry of God and you and I must understand by the grace of God that troubles and times are here and it's going to get worse people say oh I can't The Squeeze when the squeeze folks we're in the squeeze the only part we haven't seen yet is the political squeeze but everything else social uh squeeze uh look at the finances look at everything that's happening around you it's literally pressuring you to a place you're gonna either accept What God Says or deny him but when the political squeeze come that is when you're going to see the bride blew me in her fullest of Blues but right now amen she's now taking the time and the opportunity that she has right now to make sure everything's right everything is in order everything is going the way it's supposed to be and we would not have known what order would we that we had need to follow had not God sent us a messenger with a message right and the Bible tells us that in the time of trouble he said listen midi is going to faint to all the young Hallelujah but they and he says also fall and the young men shall utterly fall but there's still another group they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength and they shall Mount up amen with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint see it doesn't matter how much Satan puts on us God is already ordained us to be victorious why because we're not relying Upon Our Own Strength like the Bible says not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord this is the Holy Ghost this is why the bride says Lord give me more of you not this just to shout not just a dance not just speaking in tongues God I needed you your person your character your strength listen most of all your faith and that's what the Bible says the just shall live by his faith not your own Hallelujah there's a condition and this is the stairs of the enemy because the Bible said that in the last days amen that many uh will be choked and the life will be squeezed out because the cares of the world and you know we can see it among believers everybody want to work and become this and become that but what good would it do you like I was preaching the other day what good if you was on the Titanic and a real estate man was on that boat says I can sell you an island and I can give you a cheap prize and it's beautiful all kinds of birds and trees and everything what good would it do you and you could see that the ship is going down y'all understand me and if you can't see that the world is falling apart something is wrong with your sight God need to open your eyes this is not just a situation with America this is all over the world oh my we've already engaged ourselves and brother Benham didn't tell us but one thing he didn't tell us how much we were going to suffer he said you'll suffer but you overcome he didn't go into detail about a lot of things but he did say before the final when that before the bomb dropped that's it but you see the bomb dropping is the end what about that from the beginning up to that point this is where we are people we're headed toward the bomb drop and this is why God is saying make yourself ready it's coming Hallelujah and we know who's going to drop the bomb right and everybody say oh Putin's crazy let me say it like this he's ordained hey just like Nebuchadnezzar was ordained Amen to conquer Israel because of her backslidden condition God has set a man that has been ordained to bring judgment on the world because of their vaccine condition we're talking about the church Luke 12 29-34 says and seek not ye what ye eat or what you should drink neither be doubtful mind for all these things do the nations of the world seek after and your father knoweth that ye have need of these things huh but that's what we're doing got to get a better house got to get a better car got to get a better job got to get a better food got to get a better what are you doing you you all focused because now this is the time to focus on heaven the future of translation of his coming Hallelujah and not be caught with your work undone we know the parable the lady lost a jewel out of her out of her band and in the tradition of the Jews to to misplace a coin because that's what happens when a woman amen when she's married she has a certain band a certain corn band and to and every time she commits adultery the priest takes one of those coins away to show her husband when he returns your wife has been unfaithful and so she knew it was about time for her husband to come back amen and she saw where she had one coin missing so she gathered all of her sisters and all of her friends they helped me find this coin you see what I'm saying we've got some coins that's missing add to your faith virtue knowledge Temperance right patience goodness godness brother kindness you know the whole thing we can't allow any of those coins to be missing or we will be accounted as a adulteress how can you help me find you get on your knees and pray that God will establish you as a perfect man before Christ comes you understand me all these things the word Nations seek after for the father knoweth that you have need of these things but rather seek ye the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added get the Holy Ghost let God seal you first and everything else is coming and if God should take anything away from you you it wouldn't matter to you because you know you sealed with the Holy Ghost and you got a better Kingdom coming he said fear not and y'all know it's the truth I have to be careful because I I can get into a a nervous condition because I see God coming I see his moving I see politically I see everything moving and I keep searching myself every day Lord do I have it do I have it like the Bible says see why you say that because in this day this is the most deceptive age ever millions of people thinking that God the Holy Ghost and living any kind of life but yet they got the Holy Ghost because they spoke in tongues no sir speaking in tongues is okay God speaks in tongues but what God is looking for is the Life of Christ in you that's what we need more than anything but rather seek ye the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you fear not Little Flock Don't Be Afraid trust God if God said he's going to give it to you he'll give it to you I try to tell people the Bible says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and God shall give you the Holy Ghost that's a that's a direct quote and a direct promise and you need to pull it up on God sometime if you feel like you don't have it you ought to say Lord I have obeyed I have repented I've been baptized in your name and Lord you promised me the Holy Ghost I want it God can't break his word for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom huh sale that you have give arms provide yourself bags which wax not all a treasure in the heavens that fail is not where do thieves approaches neither does moth corrupt you know there was a lot of people that's how they died and saw them you know when they went preaching they had just got a new house a new vote read the scripture that they had summer houses and winterhouses and they were rich and you telling me that Judgment of God is going to fall down yeah they were so into their possessions till they couldn't believe the gospel and they got caught you understand me this is not a time to store up things on the earth it's good to have what you can have but make sure you got God first you could be a millionaire God don't care about that because the least person in heaven got more than that God don't care about these frivolous things God cares about one thing and that's whether you're giving him your all he won't take second place with no man nobody sell that you have give our arms provide yourself bags which wax not all a treasure in Heavens in the heavens that fail us not where no Thief approaches neither both moth corrupts for where your treasure is there will your heart be also so you see these people brother Isaac even as they claim to love God wherever their treasure is wherever the heart is that's their treasure because when God is your treasure you're here you love the word you love to hear the word we're not talking about flesh sometimes we flip the flesh fight you he's supposed to he's it's inventory enmity between God and this flesh he's a mule he's a hybrid he doesn't like to come to church nor does he want to worship God but the inner man must learn how to bind this thing the inner man is supposed to be the strong man bind him and let go and let God have his way psalms 27 1-14 we all know this scriptures but this is beautiful the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat of My Flesh they stumbled and fell now we're looking at the scripture and no doubt it means to partake or to kill or to however devour you amen I don't know but one thing for certain to eat up your flesh it needs to devour you to consume you to what destroy you but the Bible said they stumbled and fell now that sounds familiar because when they went to take Jesus and he says I am he they came close to him and what happened they fell backwards so he's proven to us that the anointing of God will do just that y'all remember that it's in the scripture the gospel there was a time they went to capture him and the Bible said he walked straight through the crowd say it like this when the pressure and the squeeze come we don't have to fear they could look right at us and not see us it all depends on what God determines come on somebody I remember the time sister Karen talked about and y'all don't some of y'all don't know her but she was in the world and and she was not a good girl and she had to run for her life and this man said I'm gonna kill you and when I catch you I'm gonna cut you up in pieces she ran and then she ran into the backyard of this house where a light was and then she thought oh my God there's no way out she was fenced in and the Lord said stand in the light she stood right there the man's man never did see her what if she had of disobeyed him Lord I can't stand right here over here there's a shadow she would have been caught but God says stand in the light she stood right there in the light she said that fella came so close to her and never could see her that's the kind of thing that made her a Christian she saw God in in his glorious ways leaving her and guiding her and that's something you can't take from her the whole ceiling Camp against me okay when the wind yeah yeah yeah when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though hoes would encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war shall arise against me in this will I be comforted y'all understand me do you understand that there is a war there's something that's moving even in the United States against Christians how many of y'all know that we're becoming enemy it's rising up and you know what that is the Bible and all of these people are going to unite against the Lord and his Christ just like they did Jesus hello and guess what even the religious people will persecute the true bride try to anyway though a hosting Camp against me who persecuted Jesus the Pharisees in the sadduce you see under the head shall be wrong that right one thing I desired of the Lord one thing I don't care about Golden Slippers and all these things people sing about I have one desired of the Lord that will I what seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life I behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple think about it for in the time of trouble he shall hide me y'all better go home and memorize this screen but in a time of trouble he shall hide me where in his Pavilion that's the rapture in the secret of this Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me what upon a rock let me tell you something the name of the Lord is the name it's the it's the character of the Lord Hallelujah is that right let me say it again the name of the Lord is the character of the name Lord his name used to be Jehovah Jireh the Jehovah shalom why did his name change because he was then what uh a reflecting another part of his character now in this day he's reflecting more of his character and it's being reflected through the Bride of Jesus Christ and what are you saying he's showing us a Grace like he's never shown any grace before we're living in the most wickedest age ever but we've got more grace and the Bible says his grace will abound Hallelujah set me upon a rock what rock the Revelation Upon This Rock I build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against what rock that Jesus is God Jesus of the New Testament is Jehovah of the old figure it out but the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily Hallelujah so much soul is Saint John 10 30. Jesus said I and the father are one hello somebody now should my head be lifted up lift up your heads all your Gates and be lifted up Hallelujah above my enemies round about me that's right why should I let my enemies have my head hung down I know who I am you got to know who you are you're not just anybody or any person God has chosen you and elected you to be bride you're the Queen of Heaven the real queen therefore without offering his Tabernacle what sacrifices of joy y'all know what that means I don't feel like it but I'm gonna shout anyhow I don't feel like it but I'm gonna praise Him anyhow I don't feel like him but I'm gonna glorify his name in the Ohio it's a sacrifice he plays it that way because Lord lost sacrifices Hallelujah is when you lay down your feelings and you give him praise Glory and Honor I will sing yeah I will sing praises unto the Lord people don't want to hear but I'm going to tell you something people of God if people somebody gonna make this Rapture they must have the revelation of Jesus Christ of this day I'm not saying they're not saved but to make a rapture you got to know who Jesus is he can't be some denominational Jesus everybody says he's a word but let me tell you this what is the word the word is God but God manifests himself in so many ways one age knew him as justification another age knew him has sanctification another age renewing him as at the restoration of the gifts so what is he is today he's the fullness of the word god comes down to fill the Bride of Jesus Christ with his character Hallelujah all that was in God he poured it into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into his church that's it it ain't how well you sing and all how good you preach a lot of preachers will end up in hell singers too musicians name it you got to know Jesus and he's got to know you right the most important part is that he he he you know him he know him knowing you how you say it it's knowing you right he's got to know you because remember when they said Lord we cast out devils in your name we did wonderful Miracles we did all of this he said depart from me you workers of iniquity that means you need to do good right many people know amen that the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is right but because of their organizations and their Charters and all of these things they won't don't want to be put out I don't care the Bible is right and I don't care how many miracles and how many signs and how many wonders they do when they fail to do the word knowing what it says God Cuts them off that's what happened the only way you can know God in this hour you got to go all the way you know how that song well I'm going all the way just to see him the one who suffered and died for me maybe we're saying that when thou seek you understand me when he came in this day what did he do he Vindicated himself by showing his face in the clouds and those who seek his face the revelation of what that was all about my heart said unto them thee thy face Lord will I see see this word is prophecy you got to understand David perhaps didn't even know what he was all writing but he was writing under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and this word is for you it's for me hard not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in Anger thou has been my help lead me not neither forsake me o God of my salvation when my this is part of life when my father and my mother forsake me then the Lord will take me up y'all hear that family against families that the Bible he said your greatest enemies of your own household they will turn against you he said but even in that time God Will Take Me Up teach me that way O Lord and leave me in a plain path because my enemies deliver me not over to the unto the will of mine enemies for false Witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty and that's what's happening even now people hate Christians and they will make up lies they did it on Jesus he said listen you gotta this is a serious thing I know I'm preaching but I'm gonna tell you something what I'm talking about is more serious than anything that I personally have encountered as of yet in my Christian walk because here the word of God David said I had fainted in other words I would have faith I would have given up unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thy heart wait I say on the Lord you can't change yourself but we know the man who can Hallelujah you love the Lord we're living in a time and I'm gonna hurry up we're living in a time where the church age is blind and I hate to use this word insane all of that and more the whole world Hallelujah and to be means to a less Advanced and mental physical or Social Development then is usually for one age one's age now you know people are not thinking good anymore it just seems like and I don't know it seemed like the people that I know that smoke dope whatever you call it Reef or whatever and they continue seeing like they lose something they remain like children they don't know how to handle um mature things they always like children and you expect them looking at their age and looking at what they should be but you know they might be 40 50 years old acting like 20 year old something happens there don't tell you that that thing mentally walks your way of thinking it slows down your maturity or maturing something happens to them because everybody I know like that is like that I told you listen what he says I told you the other day they were taking an analysis Because by the way I'm speaking they have the schools in Arizona where I live and 80 percent of the children in school is mentally what will their children be we can't have another generation we're at the end Jesus said these things would come look at all the televisions and things getting these uh fictitious things in order it'll come a time I predict he didn't say thus the Lord he said I predict that people will be completely totally insane the world will be the Bible speak of such hideous sights as they show in movies today of some prehistoric creatures eggs that lived in the Earth for so many thousands and millions of years hats and come forth to some that's just a minor thing to what's going to happen when hell is open and the Devil comes out with all of his mysterious things of women of locusts with hair like women and teeth like lions why the world would be completely totally insane it's not just but but I just about one he says listen it's not just but just about one degree from it now he said but oh listen he said but all is for the glory of God oh for the coming of Lord Jesus Oh for the for the Holy Ghost see for the no soul for the living presence of the Living God all of these things that happening now is because God told all them Saul they disobeyed God and this is what is happening why do this generation think that they can escape destruction when in the days of Noah they did not search your history Every Nation every group of people that ever refused God they end up somewhere in the fire or the flood y'all understand that he says certainly we are certainly living in the last days they are breeding different things together Crossing up and it makes a product that's no good is that all day I mean you can go get cotton candy grapes cotton candied grapes grapes that taste like cotton candy I've tried them but you know they're not doing any good for you on that sweet hybrid corn that tastes so delicious It ain't giving you nothing almost everything you buy out of the regular stores is hybrid and that's why people are catching cancer and everything else your body don't even know how to digest it that's why God said pray over your food don't take the hybrid protect me from this poison right somebody brought it to my mind the other day said you know what people we hardly ever had diabetes one day one years ago some countries never get it because they eat the right stuff but what has happened to us you know why we get sick because we don't do nothing anymore we used to eat we don't even we even our risk is is weak you know we used to turn the faucet on and turn it off now we yeah almost get an attitude when it don't come on when you want it what's wrong with the soap machine you see what I'm saying we used to walk everywhere we don't walk and no matter how many gems you get we still repeating the same thing over y'all understand what I'm saying it's science it's science and they've been mad because we got more people living but they're the reason right so let's kill them all folks let's kill them off we got too many people living and I'm telling you something y'all better y'all better understand the people in in the early church age like you know Herod and and and and all of those rulers of Rome they were insane go go read go read stuff the stuff they did to Christians and for some reason we don't forgot yeah we've forgotten and we know history repeats itself this time Jesus said it won't be water it'll be fine through doing this this is causing up everything I'm almost done through doing this I was reading in a medical journal I believe it was and then in the Reader's Digest of how that has changed the course of life for people it's even perverting men and women that men are becoming more like women and women like man men are becoming sissies and women are becoming masculine it's hybrid stuff you see that cell that we eat from these animals that's hybrid is actually not not right sells for us therefore in doing that uh see that cell from the animal or self from the wheat or sell from the corn is not right sell in order to let this grow like a like like look like a bigger it has to be sprayed with all all the time now a genuine plan a good healthy plan does not have to be spread hate it all no bugs would bother it because it has a repellent itself that it puts out that keeps all the bugs off of it now that's God's way what brought sickness into the world was sin and when man dropped away from God's provided way he opened himself up to every devil there was to sickness and so forth because he has to keep medicine and sprayed and it's just each generation in breathing into another now inbreeding into another now you might be a Christian and your wife might be a Christian but the genes of your body is still the inheritance from your father and your grandfather and on down see and Daniel said each generation would get weaker and wiser and it's got the whole race a whole human race dying hmm I know time wise we can't finish but I'm gonna read this one scripture that I'm going to preach it but I want to read this because Psalms 91 1-8 he that dwell in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadows of the Almighty I will save the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God and him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snares of the Fowler and from the north North some pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wing shall thou trust his truth his truth shall be thy shield and Buckler Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for The Hour That flyeth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasted at some Noonday A thousand shall fall at that side and ten thousand at that right hand but it shall not come nigh thee Only With Thine Eyes shall thou behold and see the reward of the wicked what generation is he talking about the the 13th verse says thou shall tread upon the lion and the Adler the Young Lion and the dragon shall thou trampled on the feet because he hath set his love upon me therefore will I do I therefore will I deliver him I will set him on high because he has known my name you know and that's that's that's the thing you know we've got so many Christians you know they think they know his name he shall call upon me and I will answer him I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him and honor him with a long life will I satisfy him and show him my salvation we have no idea what God has done in this day and when God sent us the eagle and with us amen taking this message and reading and studying it and loving and falling in love with this we hide ourselves under those eagles wings Hallelujah the bride receives an unconditional Covenant and I I'm Gonna Leave You with this if I only uh uh it is only given to the bride and she stand Justified sealed by the Holy Ghost because a lot of time we understand that God is is not just a man he's God Jesus wasn't just a man he's God he was born a man but in the in that man it was God he said brother but I said I have always preached that he was deity not just a man he was God manifested In the Flesh God the attribute of god of love the great attribute that comes down in this play here on Earth of God Jesus was God's love which built a body that Jehovah himself lived in he was a fullness of the godhead bodily what God was he manifested through that body that body had to die so he could wash the bride with his blood and notice not only is The Blood Washed forgiven but she is Justified see did you ever try the word justify to see what it means see that's the thing we don't have to worry oh I'm not going to make it no get the Holy Ghost you made it ceiling of the Holy Ghost now for instance if brother green heard that I have been drinking and I have been doing bad things then he found out that I didn't do it then he said come and say I forgive you brother Branham you forgive me I never done it what you forgive me about see but if I'm guilty then I can be forgiven but if I but still but I'm still not just because I did it but the word Justified is though you've never done it at all justify y'all see what I'm saying that's what the blood of Jesus Christ come to do for you he washes away all your sins put them in the sea of forgetfulness as though you never see it in the first place and the blood of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ cleanses us from a soul from sin until it puts the book of God it puts in the book of God's forgetfulness see he's the only one can do it we can't we can forgive but not forget I could forgive you but I always remember you've done these evil things then you're not just you're forgiven but in the sight of God excuse me the bride is Justified she never done it in the first place amen standing there married to The Virtuous Son of God never sin in the first place now you can't even comprehend it but you got to believe it you gotta hide underneath the shadows of this wing Hallelujah why she was for ordained she was trapped into this and now when she heard the truth and come forth the blood cleansed her as she stands there virtuous she she no sin on her at all for in a time of trouble you need to remember this because I'm going to tell you when trouble came and because Peter wasn't didn't have the Holy Ghost he fought flesh with flesh Jesus said put the sword up if you fight with the swords you'll die by the sword but after Peter was converted the Bible said Peter after you are converted strength in your brother and when they came God revealed to Peter this is your day to die and when they came to get Peter he didn't fast he didn't fight and when they took him and they were going to crucify him they were going to crucify this is this is under Josephus this is history Peter says no no no no no no I'm not worthy to be crucified like my Lord turn me upside down so he was crucified upside down y'all understand me he didn't fight he didn't argue he didn't go no no he was a lamb led to the slaughter and God looking for lambs and only God can give us give you that Lamb's nature that's what we need to pray father fill us with your Lambs nature that will be Obed into the word of God and will follow you even if it means unto our death let's stand he's going to protect you you say oh brother because I can't go through that all I know is this day when Stephen was being stoned God was there and the Bible open up to Stephen a vision and he saw the Son of God standing on the right hand of God and they Stone him can you imagine we don't know what we don't have no idea what that's like but you know what he didn't get mad you know what he said father hold these things not to their charge he was so full of the Holy Ghost love prevailed and he conquered the devil with his last words ain't God good and God ain't
