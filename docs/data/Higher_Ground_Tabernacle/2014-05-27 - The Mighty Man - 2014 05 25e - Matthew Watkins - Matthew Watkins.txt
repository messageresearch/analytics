church and the ties and everything and the second one will be specifically for the visiting Brothers as just a token of appreciation for them sacrificing you know it's not about money but by the grace of God that's how sometimes we have to show affection in this day and age but praise the Lord that so that's the second one so you're not thinking we're going around just asking for something just for

you thanks Lord blessed be his name amen you love the Lord Jesus amen certainly been uh I'll use this good American word it's been awesome it has been awesome Amen to be here this weekend and I told Brother Isaiah and I really uh meant it when I said it that you know you go some places and I'm a full I've been full-time now evangelist traveling for about five years almost six years now you go some places sometimes and and just unfortunately you you give you give so much you give so much virtue and you feel when you leave so empty sometimes but I love going somewhere Hallelujah and feeling so full amen that you don't just give but you get amen and that's not just been just from the ministering but just the atmosphere and the the presence of the Lord you create that remember you're not a responder God didn't make you to respond to his atmosphere God said you create the atmosphere amen hallelujah amen brother Brandon said you could create a world and go live on it I believe we've created a world this weekend amen and we're living eating amen hallelujah thank you brother Isaiah again for having us certainly just enjoyed myself so much you love the Lord amen you love one another amen amen I feel so full from this morning and just as uh uh just was so blessed by the word amen what a 12 course meal we had this morning amen my my my just so appreciated that and just soaking it all in and if you could if you could give me a CD of that I want one for when I go amen that was just the meetings have just been so good amen we're going to turn to the word tonight 2 Samuel chapter 23 three if you have your Bible 2 Samuel chapter 23 amen I'd like to minister and and we're going to continue just not it not exactly in the same way that we ministered on uh the morning service yesterday amen but uh but along the same characters and and I believe that the word is so rich amen and and we could uh we we we just want to be blessed by it tonight I'd like to minister to you tonight on the making of a mighty man and when I say man I don't mean it in the sense of gender but I mean it in the sense of Sons and Daughters of God the making of a Mighty Man 2 Samuel chapter 23 verse 8 these be the names of the Mighty Men whom David had the taconite that sat on the seat Chief among the captains the same was adino the eite he lift up his spear against 800 whom he slew at one time that's awesome my goodness we could stop right there is this a fairy tale is this Disney some artificial movie no this is real these were real things that happened in Sons and Daughters of God's lives amen and if I pronounce some of these names wrong you forgive me you might pronounce them different but it says in verse n and after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the ahite one of the three Mighty Men isn't that something you can be the son of a Dodo and still be a mighty man hallelujah amen it says he was one of the three notice the language here when it says one of the three now to catch you up to speed David is going to have an army we can say that in this Army to be in David's Army you were in the Under the Umbrella of the army of David and it would be an awesome thing to be a soldier in David's Army but within that Army there's going to be categories of men now notice this this is how the writer of Samuel puts it we're going to bring this in a type in the new test Testament but he was going to have an army but within that Army he was going to have 37 what the Bible denotes in their life and calls them Mighty Men not just ordinary man not just an ordinary Soldier but for some reason the character in these Men's Life the Bible records that they were 37 Mighty Men and then within that 30 mighty men that David is going to have there's even a deeper class of Excellence called the top three amazing now we know all these things were types and examples as brother John so clearly laid out tonight to this uh this morning that there would be types and examples that the that we could bring today you believe that you can extrapolate things in the scripture and they have a manifold purpose and meaning what's amazing is that he has this top 30 then within that top 30 he's going to have the top three Mighty Men now notice what elzer was it says he was one of the mighty one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle and the men of Israel were going away he arose and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary and his hand clav unto the sword the Lord wrought a great victory that day and the people returned after him only to spoil and again and after him was shama the son of age the herit the Philistines were gathered together into a troop where there was a piece of ground full of lentiles the people fled from the Philistines but now who fled Israel this is the rest of the army they're retreating they're running the Bible says but he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it you see when everybody else is running and retreating a mighty man says I'll Stand My Ground Hallelujah you see brother bham said you have to fight for every inch of ground that you gain but you also have to fight to keep the ground that you gain sometimes the fight is not gaining new ground it's holding what God's already given you the Bible says that While others were fleeting verse 12 says but he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it and slew the Philistines and the Lord raw a great Victory three of the 30 Chief went down and came to David in the Harvest Time unto the cave of aulum the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of refraim and David then was in a hold and the Garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem David long and said oh that one would give me drink of the water of The Well of Bethlehem which is by the gate and the three not the 30 not everybody but there was a choice that was made by three the Bible says that the three Mighty Men broke through the host of the Philistines and Drew water out of the well of Beth that was by the gate and took it brought it to David nevertheless he would not drink thereof but poured it unto the Lord and said be it far from me oh Lord that I should do this say it's not this the blood of the men that went in Jeopardy of their lives therefore he would not drink it these things I love that these exploits these accomplishments these things did these three Mighty Men neishi the brother of joab the son of zeruya was Chief among three he lifted up his spear against three UND and slew them and had notice a name among three but he wasn't in the top three verse 19 was he not most honorable of three therefore he was their Captain how be it he attained not unto the first three it didn't say anything about his last name or because he was unfortunate because he wasn't born in a certain family or his daddy wasn't a pastor or this but it was a personal decision and a personal choice that God said this man attained and this man did not notice he says and he attained not unto the three notice what it says in verse 20 and benayah the son of jodia the son of a vant men of cabil who had done many acts he slew two lionlike men of Moab he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in the time of snow and he slew an Egyptian a goodly man now goodly if you look that word up in the Hebrew it doesn't mean good in the sense of good or bad it actually means the English word huge he slew a huge man and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand and he went down to him with a staff and pluck the spear out of the Egyptians hand and slew him with his own spear these things did benayah the son of Joda and had the name among three Mighty Men He was more honorable than the 30 so he was in a deeper class than the 30 but he attained not to the first three David sent him over his guard ashel the brother of job and it goes on down to list these men here if you have your Bible just one more scripture we'll have you turn to Mark chapter 4 you love the Lord I hope you're not sleepy tonight Mark chapter 4 a man we'll just begin reading and go through this and have you be seeded Hark and behold verse three there went out a sewer to sew it came to pass as he sowed some fell by the wayside and the fouls of the air came and devoured it up some fell on Stony ground where it had not much Earth and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of Earth but when the sun was up it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away some fell among thorns and the Thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no fruit now fell on good ground and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased and brought forth some 30 and some 60 and some 100 verse 13 and he said know ye not this Parable verse 14 the S Seth the word these are they by the wayside where the word is sown but when they have heard Satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts these are they likewise which are swn on Stony ground who when they had heard the word immediately received it with gladness so sometimes reaction is not enough many people react to the word it says and he had and he have no root in themselves and have no root in themselves so endured but for a Time afterward when Affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake immediately they are offended these are they which are sown among Thorns such as hear the word and the cares of the world the deceitfulness of riches and the lust of other things entering in choke the word and notice what it says and it becometh unfruitful these are they which are sewn on good ground notice such as hear the word and receive it and and bring forth fruit some 30 fold some 60 and some 100 amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we just stand here again tonight in in need of you Lord and in in need of you father Lord how we need you tonight God it come and break the word Lord to these people to meet their need Lord for father you're their father you're not a Shepherd Lord on the hillside who's not concerned about your people Lord but you're concerned father and you care Lord may you feed them great Shepherd of the sheep Lord you and you'll feed them Lord because that's who you are you're the shepherd you're the great Shepherd Lord and I pray that you would just take every life Lord may we consecrate oursel just now father to be used in your service Grant it Lord Jesus we ask in your name amen you can be seated the mark s of a Mighty Man Mark chapter uh 4 as we've just read is such an an an amazing thing and I believe that there's a word that you keep reading about and you keep hearing in this Parable and it goes throughout uh this entire example that he he keeps repeating this word fruitful or not fruitful I believe that one of the most essential parts of a Christian in a believer's life is that we bear fruit from our life not the fruit of our opinions what we think or or what we want but that we can bear the fruit of the word and what's amazing that of all these grounds that we have we have different classifications we have the good ground then we have the Stony ground and the thorny ground and and God gives these different examples and what's amazing is that all the Earth received the seed all the Earth heard the word all the Earth even some had a reaction to the word and reacted and the Bible says a non with joy received and and was glad and rejoiced but you know what was so amazing out of all of these types of Earth there was only one difference between the good ground and the rest of the ground is that while the other types of Earth or Humanity had the ability by cognitive understanding to hear the word and reason with the word and sympathize with the word and rejoice in the word the difference was is that the good ground didn't just hear it but they had the ability to produce produce what they hear in their lives and God says this is the good ground that that is fruitful friend there is nothing more satisfying as a Christian that your life Bears the fruit of the word Jesus said every branch that beareth not fruit he purges it and every branch that beareth fruit he purges it that he may bring forth more fruit and he takes away the branch that doesn't bear fruit what is the the the symbol that we keep hearing that our lives are fruitful as Christians and God says there are different categories that some bring 30 fold and some bring 60 fold and some bring 100 fold and friend let me tell you tonight I'm afraid so many people have settled and been content bringing 30-fold Christianity in their lives but I believe I am preaching to somebody tonight that says oh God I don't just want to stop with 30f I don't want to stop with 60 fold but something inside of me says God I want be a h hundredfold i want to be a mature Christian a fruitful Christian Hallelujah I believe I'm preaching to people that can say like Paul this one thing I don't speak as though I've attained or that I'm already perfect but this one thing I do I forget yesterday I forget what happened last week and something inside me is pressing me and he said I must press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus not just a calling not just to be called but he's going to say there was something special that God while he called some and while some came on the race and while some received the word there was going to be a generation of people that wasn't satisfied with just a calling but they said I have something inside of me that presses towards the High Calling you set a goal and say Lord I I just want to be here I I want to find myself in this place but what's amazing is when God gives you that Victory you're not satisfied there and you set a greater goal and say I want to go deeper Lord and when I find myself in that place I'm not satisfied there I want to go deeper Lord I want to go higher Lord oh friend listen to me there have been men who have literally shook their generation there have been men throughout the ages that we could say were Mighty Men of God they were extraordinary they were special something about their lives they made an impact on people there are some people if I could say this tonight and and I I want to say it this way that there's some people who are in a greater class of a Christian now now let me say it so that you understand it more correctly there are certain Christians who are more effective yes and their life than others certain Believers that something about them they have an impact on the world around them and listen friend this isn't by any many Mighty Mo and God chooses and blesses some but I want you to understand that the High Calling is a choice that the individual has to make themselves it is a personal choice that that person chooses not just to be glad with salvation not just to be glad with justification and filled with the Holy Ghost but something in them says Lord I want to be a weapon to tear the devil's Kingdom down I want my life to be a tool in your toolbox oh god oh I can't stress this enough this is a personal choice the prophet of God said the voice said listen to me William brandom you chose you chose he keeps stressing that this was your choice you chose the harder way this isn't something I forced upon you this isn't something I pressured you into but something in your heart said I'll choose to take the way with the Lord's despised Feud this was your choice and because of that a great portion of Heaven awaits you oh this is the victory in love divine it is a personal choice that you must make and it's not the easy way the High Calling is not the easy way let me say when you see what you would term a successful believer that didn't come just by coming to church and listening to the word oh that's good and that's okay but I'm afraid so many times we are umbilically attached to a pull pit and we never see the vision of God for our personal life I'm going to preach tonight whether y'all want to hear it or not I believe that God is calling men and God is calling women to say God use me if you can use anything Lord you can use me oh take my hands and my feet Touch My Heart Lord speak for me if you can use anything get Glory out of my my life get Glory out of my life Lord hallelujah character is not a gift the prophet said it's a victory and that's why some have it and some don't because some choose to fight the harder way and some don't amen I believe that there is a difference in the kingdom of God and what you can inherit and what you attain what must we do to inherit eternal life you see there's nothing you can do that is a free gift of God it is something God says freely you have receed so freely give salvation is the free gift of God but that's not the same spiritual Excellence is attained amen if by any means I might attain until the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already attained Paul says or or or we're already perfect but I follow after if I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I count myself not to have apprehended but I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus let me say this and when it start simple it is an awesome thing to be justified have we forgotten how awesome it is just to be saved oh I know that's not enough and you've got to press on into the Holy Spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost but have we forgotten how awesome it is to know my sins which were many have all been washed away have we forgotten how awesome of a thing it is for God to justify oh friend justification is not and I'm afraid so many people have only got the mental intellectual understanding of this you see brother Ram said justification is not when you you take a man who's accused of murder and he's a murderer and you take that man and he goes into the courtroom and the justice system looks at him and says yeah you did it yeah you're a murderer you committed the crime and you know it yes sir yes sir I know I did but I'm going to choose to have mercy on you and I'm going to forgive you forgiven now listen so many people this is is their model of justification and it doesn't work you know why because while the court says that man's Justified why the court says that man has been forgiven when the man walks out of the courtroom he's plagued with the conscience because he knows who he is and he's plagued with the guilt and he's plagued with the sin and though the court says you're free and you're Justified he won't walks out with the guilty conscience of a murderer and he knows he committed the sin and he knows he's condemned and though they gave Mercy to him friend this is not justification the Bible says that the worshipper in the Old Testament though he would all for the sin sacrifice yet when he left there he was plagued with the Consciousness that he was not a different person he was he was forgiven he was atoned for but he knew that there was a nature in inside of him that Comm allowed him to commit the sin in the first place and the Bible says for if the sacrifice of Bloods and goats could have atoned and freed this man they would have continually been offered today but it could not but the Bible says that the worshipper under this atonement the worshipper once purged is free from the conscience of his sin Hallelujah because that man doesn't get looked at what happens when God justifies that man is when the court system looks at a man who the devil says is a murderer and the judge says you're not a murderer you were trapped into it you never did it in the first place Hallelujah and brother random said a revelation drops inside that man's soul and something tells him I am righteous through the righteousness of Christ something tells him I'm I wasn't born to be a murderer I wasn't born to be a drunk man I was born to be a Dwelling Place of almighty God oh friend listen to me you weren't born to be on a bar stool that's not who you are you weren't born to be a sports star that's not who you are you're a pilgrim and a stranger you're not from here oh let me preach that t tonight this is not your home you're from above you speak a different language you thirst for different things the world can't satisfy you let me say You're an Alien here and there's a burning desire in your heart view the land oh I'm longing for thee and someday on thee I'll Stand hallu oh but what happens when you came into this world separated by sin you were you were called a a failure you were called a drunk you were called a drug addict but you know what's amazing is this was the exact condition of Shadrach mesach and abedo in the Bible yeah did you know this you know Shadrach mesach and abedo those weren't their names you know what those were those were those were names that Babylon which is the world had given them Nebuchadnezzar took those Jewish boys and he renamed them at a very young age because your name speaks of your identity and your name speaks of your origin your name speaks of who you are and who your daddy is and where you came from and where you come from reveals where you're going and a name had power in it a name brought that person to adoption to realize who they were these boys had been renamed Shadrach mesach and abedo you know what Shadrach means Shadrach means command of the Moon God imagine this these were Babylonian Gods meak meant what is who Aku is Aku was a Babylonian God who is like Aku abendigo is a corrupted name it means vant of nebu my goodness this is what he named them because he tried to misconstrue who they were he tried and they had forgotten their identity they had forgotten who they were Shadrach you weren't Shadrach originally me Shack that wasn't your name a b too Shadrach your name was Hanah and hananiah means Jehovah who is gracious mishel that was your name mesach your name was mishel Michel means who is like my God abedo your name was not abedo it was Azariah which means Jehovah has [Applause] [Music] helped but the world had tried to rename them oh friend the world named you failure and no good and drunk and drug addict but God said said that's not your name your name is Overcomer your name is Washed by the blood of the Lamb your name is bride of Christ Hallelujah because that's who you are don't let the devil rename you and try to tell you your name is failure your name is depression your name is addicted your name is free Hallelujah Hallelujah that's what happens when God justifies a man a revelation that only God I want to stress that only God can give that Revelation you can mentally try to get your hand around it and say I'm forgiven I'm forgiven I'm forgiven Lord I believe your blood and I accept your blood I accept your blood but that conscience always bother you brother Brandon said when God justifies a man you're justified by faith and he said it's a revelation that drops in your heart and listen to me friend when the preacher sermon couldn't help you and Mama's praying couldn't help you and it seemed like nothing was going to stop anything nothing was ever going to get your attention and when your friends and your loved ones were praying for you and nothing seemed to move you but when God said it's time to reach down and save you let me tell you nothing in Hell could stop it from coming forth because Christ looked at you and said Lazarus come forth and a man who had been dead in sins and trespasses something pulled him out of the Grave oh nothing can stop the plan of God let me say that again nothing can stop the plan of God no weapon formed against you shall prosper no device or plan of the devil that he can put on your life if you're an elected son or daughter of God Jesus said all the father has given me will come to me and I won't lose one cuz they're in the palm of my hand oh you love the Lord am oh it's an awesome thing to be justified it's an awesome thing to be saved it's an awesome thing to be Sanctified because what does San what is justification do when you're Justified you realize you're not from here you're a King's son you're you're from another country and so what does it cause you to do causes you to say if I'm a King's son I want to dress like a Kings son and I want to live like a King's son and I want to sanctify my vessel to look like where I'm from because I don't speak the same language as the world I don't speak ESPN I don't speak all these things that the world chases after those things don't satisfy me they don't move me but I say like David you're my portion Lord David said in the Book of Psalms chapter 82 I think it is all my Springs are in you Lord imagine that David said all my Springs in other words everything that I thirst for in life I find it in you Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah it's an awesome thing to be Sanctified but it's an even greater thing when God fills that vessel with his own Zoey life and you become what Paul called a new creature I said a new creature whoever is in Christ is a new creature Jesus Christ was the beginning of the new creation and when a man is Born Again by the spirit of God he is the continuation of that new creation of the same life with the same power let me tell you something when you're in Christ you're not an American you're not a Canadian you're not black you're not white you're a new creature Hallelujah and you're not subject to the spirit of the country you're from you're subject to the spirit of Christ hallelujah oh we got to get to our sermon tonight what separates these men as the Bible says if I could go through some things tonight and I would call them you can write these down if you want the marks what are the marks of a mighty man what denoted these Men's Life as we said David had 30 and then on top of the 30 in a deeper category he had the top three but what made these men what denoted their life what was the characteristics we could say what were the marks of a mighty man one mark of a mighty man is that his core and his center of his being is the presence of the Lord his core and his center of his being is the presence of the Lord turn to Psalms chapter 51 quickly if you have your Bible here we go back to David right where we left off Psalms chapter 51 you love the Lord Jesus oh his word just so awesome my his coron is Center notice what David says and David is going to be a mighty man he's going to be the captain of this host of Mighty Men and their King and notice as we as we see this characteristic in David's life we're going to find something out about who David was as a person and it says here in Psalms chapter 51 David comes on down and we know he's been exposed by Nathan as we've ministered and David starts to pray this prayer and then David in the middle of this prayer says something very interesting and don't skip over it and and think of the song and we we can sometimes make things cliche and lose the purpose and meaning of why he said it but he says here in verse 11 cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me now we know David was not born again in the sense that we are born again Jesus said in Mark 7 John chap 7 he that believeth on me shall out of his belly flow rivers of Living Water but he spoke of the spirit which had not yet came yet this is Elementary Jesus had not yet ascended his he had not sent the comforter so David was not born again in the sense that he had the Holy Ghost living in his soul but David knew what it was like to commune and fellowship and speak to God he knew that that he knew about the the spirit he knew about the presence of the Lord Lord and David at a very young age experiences this presence and David comes to this area in his life and he prays and he says cast me not away this word cast is the same as we would take as when a father kicks a child out of their house and this is actually the term that David is using because of what he's feeling and David says cast me not away from thy presence oh Lord and take not your Holy Spirit from me now why would David even fear this in his life why would David pray cast me not away from thy presence and don't take your Holy Spirit as we said on the Saturday morning this was not a poem that's right this was a cry of desperation it was like a child begging his father Oh Daddy please don't kick me out that's what David was saying I know I've sinned I know I've fallen but you don't understand please don't do that to me please don't cast me away from your presence please don't take your Holy Spirit from me you know why because David starts remembering back in his mind and David's memory goes back to when he was a little boy and now David is realizing that God put David in the house of Saul for a reason because David was going to have the unique ability to grow up in the house of Saul and spend many many many weeks in Saul's house watching how Saul operated as a king watching how Saul was as a person watching how he handled the Affairs because God had a man in training and David remembers all this in his memory and he goes back in his mind and God is training said David in this time of his life because God is literally telling David David I want you to learn what you're never to become you're not to ever become a soul because you're David he never said Saul was a man after his own heart but something about David God said he's a man after my own heart and David goes back in his memory as he's there confronted with his own guilt and his own failures and his own mistakes and David remembers Saul and David says I remember another time and there was another king and his name was Saul and here's the prophet Nathan and there was a prophet to Saul his name was Samuel and David saysi remember in my mind watching and it seemed like it seemed like Saul you know he Saul s Saul Saul lived such a very different life as David watched you know to Saul the presence of God didn't really mean that much you know for some people the presence of God really doesn't mean that much the presence of God to them and to fill The Spirit Well yeah if I can then good if I don't it's not that important it's not a IAL to my life David was very different and it seemed like you know it didn't really bother Saul seemed like David could remember Saul and I remember Time and Time Again David said when we'd go to battle and and Saul would would leave he he'd get you know 80% Victory and leave 20% and it seemed like he was always content and that was always okay with Saul to get some victory but not all Victory you know live half in the world half in church you know for some people they're comfortable here brother said they live in very in degrees of sanctification they never press on friend I don't know there's not a more uncomfortable place to be than sitting on the fence and some people are uncomfortable because they're on the fence brother random said many come out not many go into amen and David remembers as Saul so many times Saul would go to battle and Samuel would come and say why have you disobeyed the voice of the Lord didn't he tell you to destroy everything then why do I hear the bleeding of Sheep amen if I told you to kid to get rid of everything and to kick out everything why do I still h a television in the background why do I still see those Hollywood films and movies in your life come on Saul isn't it important to you you know this is the amazing thing and I would have stopped to say this this is the amazing thing I'm read realizing as as I grow in Christ is that no matter how hard you preach to some people they'll never change let me say this the ultimate sign that my body will change in a body change is that I have the ability to change now my life under the preached word and these people that are unmovable and unchangeable I fear for you in Rapture time and it seemed like sa was always content with this and he was was always okay and he would always come up with and he would always come up with this excuse and this reason oh me and the people you see there safety in numbers he had the attitude of oh lord it's all of us are guilty you know I mean don't blame don't don't single me out Lord and then when God would be displeased and the presence of the Lord would depart you notice what Saul would always say Saul would always say Samuel pray for me isn't it amazing his entire experience was only through a prophet and he never had an experience for himself are you with me tonight and David said I remember I remember time and time and time and time again I watched and Saul would just go on and on and Sam would come and samel would rebuke him and he would tell him Saul get right Saul you don't understand but this was the Saul Center always came with half Victory and the problem was he was okay with it David says but I remember it didn't always stay that way it didn't just go on and on and on and on and on and on David says Lord I remember after you warned him time and time again there came a day when Saul sat out of his own mouth the presence of the Lord as part pray for me he goes to the witch of indor he can't speak to the Lord because the spirit has left him David could not imagine a more terrifying thing and for the believer there is nothing you fear more than the presence of God there's nothing you fear more than the presence of God because you love it so much and you thirst for it so much it is who you are you can't be satisfied by the world it doesn't quench your thirst there's only one thing that quenches The Thirst of the believer and that's the presence of God he is your portion he is what keeps you going day by day by day oh the drunk man he takes his alcohol the poe head he takes his pot the drug at it takes his drugs because brother Isaiah that's all he's got that's all he's got that his all his joy and all his happiness is contained because that's all he's got so he is going to get everything he possibly can because it's the only joy and the only happiness do you realize friend this is all you've got Oh Glory this is all we've got this is who I am I love coming to church I love worshiping the Lord I love talking to the Lord because it's all I've got and if it's all I've got I'm going to give him everything that I have you see Saul this didn't really bother him and Saul David says I remember and eventually eventually left him but David says Lord please don't do that to me because I'm different than Saul Saul could live without the presence of God but for David David said it's my life you see the mighty man of God is marked because his core and his Center is the presence and the communion with Christ David revealed who he was in Psalms chapter 27 when he said one thing have I desired of the Lord in other words David could say if if you're seeking to to build a nice home and and I have riches in this world well that's okay but but I can't relate to you cuz that's not who I am if you're seeking to you know to be some celebrity or or to be known in the world or to have some social status David could say you know if you're chasing Hollywood and chasing Beauty and chasing women and chasing all these other things if you're chasing a life of worldism David could say I I just can't relate to you because there's only one thing I want out of this life oh does anybody feel that way tonight there's only one thing I W Lord one thing have I desired and David said and that will I seek after to dwell in the presence of God in the secret of his Tabernacle all the days of my life this is what marks a mighty man as we said on Saturday morning one of the marks of a mighty man is that he has victory in his private life not just his public life but God had to get victory in David's private life are you awake tonight he had to get victory in David's private life because God said David it's not so much who you are on the outside but I want truth to dwell on the inside amen you see a lot of people can shout and a lot of people can sing at church but they're a very different person when they're all by themselves but you are who you are when nobody else is watching The Mark of a mighty man is that he is a giant slayer one of the marks of a mighty man is that he's a giant slayer you see David was not the only Giant Slayer oh y'all didn't know that we love the story of David and Goliath but you see David was going to have men that surrounded his life and these mighty men would be giant Slayers notice this in 1 chonicles 20 you don't need to turn but it says it came to pass after this there was what there arose a war at gazer with the Philistines at which time saachi the hasite slew sypon that was of the children of the Giant and they were subdued oh yall preach on that right I mean that was some probably Sunday school lesson this morning was probably teaching on saaki and cpii right we all got pictures of saaki killing CPI there was war again verse eight for the there was war again with the Philistines and elhanan the son of jir slew Lami the brother of Goliath Lami not llama Lami he slew Lami the brother of Goliath who spash spear staff was like a Weaver's beam and yet again there was where gath there was where there was a man of great stature whose fingers and toes were four and 26 on each hand that guy had a lot of fing fing and Toes six on each foot he was also the son of the giant but when he defied Israel Jonathan the son of shimya David's brother slew him you see courage breeds courage amen and these men had to catch a revelation for themselves that if David could do it and if God could use David God can use me Hallelujah if God could use David to kill a giant he could use my life too you see what I'm afraid of is that we have a tendency in humanity to raise up a hero in our mind but fail to see the reality of God in our own life I'm going to be real careful when I say this but I think so many times we have gods and heroes of our own imagination and we Crown a minister or some spiritual person and they win all of our battles and they have all the victories and we watch all the Miracles and in the message so many times this has been the problem we have crowned Kings and heroesall and we fail to see that God has a vision for us are you with me here tonight there's a natural tendency inside of humanity towards idolatry that's why a little boy wears Superman pajamas and Batman pajamas and he wants some Superman or some Batman some of y'all might still have him on tonight Lord help us but there's something inside of him when he's even young that he wants a hero he wants someone he can look to brother bandam says this in the Ephesian Church age uh let me find my place here he says Paul saw it coming notice listen very close I wish I could have put this on the screen Paul saw it coming but he warned them about this subtle priesthood that would come in and take over with this false Doctrine he knew they would implement a way of worship that excluded the people from any part in the Holy Spirit Ministry and even right today among those who claim to be free and full of the spirit there is not too much freedom in the Ley and the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flock just sits there and tries to absorb it I thought that was my job brother man I thought I come to church and you know the minister he waits on God and he speaks to God and he carries God in his briefcase he comes out here and he gives us God and we all rejoice and say amen and we absorb it I'm telling you what sippi and and Lami learned a different lesson they learned that while there was great men like David that courage Brad courage and there was other men who said if God could use my king he can use my [Music] life brother renom said this is a far cry from Paul who said when all come together all have the leading of the spirit and all participate in spiritual worship oh give the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight [Applause] hallelujah oh Hallelujah brother Ram says the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching oh friend what you must pray tonight is to say God take that inspired preaching and Inspire my life Lord if you can use anything Lord you can use me you see it's a complex leader that will squash the other giant Slayers in his ministry it is a complex man who wants to squash the other gifts because they intimidate and challenge his own position and we have seen this over and over and over again but I believe I'm preaching to men and to women tonight that say God you have a plan for my life where's my giant where's my giant I don't need to wait on a man of God or a sermon he is greater he that is in me is greater than he that's in the world I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength hallelujah hallelujah verse 20 turn to second Samuel if you have your Bible still open there turn back there 2 Samuel 20 you love the Lord amen 2 Samuel chapter 20 we're just skipping over a lot of this just to save time knowing it's the evening service and some of you are tired but we want to get to this 2 Samuel 20 and notice what he what he talks about here and I'm sorry it's uh second Samuel 23 the Bible says in verse 20 and Ben bah the son of jhoda the son of a valiant man of cabil who had done many acts he slew two lionlike men man I've seen some big guys in my time but I don't think I've ever called anybody lion likee ever looked at him said man that guy's lion like he's so big he's lion likee but there was something about this man that the Bible said he was like a lion and notice who they're from the Bible says they were lion like men of Moab who is Moab children of Moab ancestral Affair between lot and his daughters brother brandom typed and the Bible types the entire through the scriptures is a type of the flesh this is the flesh he says he slew two lionlike men of Moab he went down also and slew a lion man he had it out for Lions he slew a lion in the midst of a pit in the time of snow I know some some of y'all are looking like okay this is not your ordinary Bible verse but let me present something to you tonight unordinary men don't create ordinary Bible verses but you see there's something very off something very different about these Mighty Men they're very different than everybody else you see when other kids when David was a little boy and other kids were playing Xbox and p uh Playstation and all these other things David didn't find any interest in that David was praying as a little boy teach My Hands to War David was wrestling Bears and Lions as a as a teenager because there was something different about his life he knew he was unique and the Bible says that he goes into a pit in the time of snow and he slew he slew a lion in the midst of a pit and the time of snow could you imagine when this man goes into a pit now now what's what's amazing is that uh he comes before this great pit and there's this great Lion now this this lion is one of the most fearsome creatures in the world I actually read a book a man wrote about about all this with with this man B it was so good that the lion is one of the most dangerous creatures and bayah goes before this pit and he sees this great big lion and he decides to jump in you see normal people go the other [Music] way I can imagine some of y'all in a testimony would come to church and say oh I've got a testimony to tell brother I got to tell a testimony I was out in the woods and and I walked across this great pit and there was an African lion in there reaching for me and he couldn't get to me praise the Lord he delivered me but you see a mighty man is very different a mighty man thinks different he acts different he loves a good challenge and the Bible says this mighty man of God look down at that lion and jumps inside the pit I heard the man say you can tell when he comes out of the pit of Bah comes crawling out and he's got blood dripping from him and he's got marks all over him and flesh hanging from him and he's Victorious and he looks his clothes are tattered and torn and oh he just looks busted up and someone says if you think he looks bad you should see the LI cuz he tore that lion from one side to the other because he believed that if God could take David who was my king and David said with his bare hands he slew a lion then God can use me too and he goes down into this pit he kills this lion in a time of snow and the Bible says that God makes him David made him his bodyguard I'd imagine that a man who goes into a pit in a time of snow and kills a lion I'd want him to be my body go too heard the man say imagine when when David was going through resumés this man says oh I can bench press 900 pounds this man says oh I can lift a car and throw at 30t this man he comes to the next resume and this man says oh you know I can shoot a gun and hit a Target at 700 yard he comes to bayah I went into a pit and killed a lion in a time of snow and David said that's my man you see he had a choice to walk the other way he had a choice to take his fear in his life that he had from when he was a little boy he had a choice to always run from it his entire life he had a choice to be like everybody else around him and live like everybody else but there was something he determined in his heart and said I'm not going to be like everybody I'm not going to be the normal I am unnormal and I'm going to jump into my pit and face my fears word hallelujah because this man was a mighty man of God he slew an Egyptian verse 21 look in your Bible he slew an Egyptian a goodly man which means huge so he kills a giant and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand he went down to him with the staff plucked the spirit of the Egyptians hand and slew him so he had Victory I love this a mighty man of God has victory in three categories he had victory over Moab which is the flesh he had victory over an Egyptian which is the world and ultimately they'll have victory over his adversary the Bible says your adversary is like a lion going to and fro the Bible says but they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and notice by the word of their testimony not what God did through a prophet not what God did through a preacher but they overcame him by their own personal testimony David finds himself in 2 Samuel 23 look over there just just a few verses back we're not going to be too much longer I'm do I still have your attention tonight 2 Samuel chapter 23 verse 9 11 says let me let me find my place David was in a hold verse 14 David was then in a hold and the Garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem and David longed and said oh that one would give me drink of the water of The Well of Bethlehem which is by the gate and the three Mighty Men broke through the host of the Philistines and Drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David you know what's so amazing about these men's life because one of the marks of a mighty man is that he has the ability to discern the anointed man of his age now listen very close this was not King David this was not David the accepted this was not David the worshiped this was not David the exalted this was David the Renegade brother bam called him a renegade he was on the Run running for his life had just a few men he's living in a cave running for his life and the Bible says that is at this time that David starts to long now notice he doesn't go out and broadcast this to the whole Army he doesn't walk out and go man my mouth is dry I wish somebody would give me a drink from the water of Bethlehem hint hint he doesn't broadcast the desire because the king doesn't broadcast the desire of his heart to everybody but there are certain people who are living close enough to David that they know what he wants done with his word there is certain men these three men something about them knew this was the desire of the king's heart and these men stood for this Renegade not when he was accepted you see brother John there was no reward in standing with David when he was King David when when everybody accepted him when everybody loved him when God had Vindicated him when God had proved him there was no Victory saying oh out I'll stand right by your side King David but there was Victory when God when when you looked at a man who was hated and despised and rejected and said I'll stand by that man amen let me tell you something friend there's only a reward and those who stand for the truth because the truth is rejected by the world but I choose to say I discern that God sent an anointed vessel in this age and though he's a renegade and though this message is hated by the world I'll take the way with the Lord's despised [Music] Feud cuz the Mighty Man discerns the anointed vessel for his age before he's publicly made known one of the marks of a mighty man and I'm going to I just I've been waiting to get to this part because it's so close to my heart one of the words of a mighty man is that he isn't Fearless I know you think that that's so strange you know I would think a mighty man you know a great mighty man of God he would be Fearless he would be so courageous a mighty man of God is Not Fearless but he faces his fear d uh David says even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for you with me your rod and your staff they comfort me second Timothy 1 God has not given us the spirit of fear but of Power of Love of a sound of mind the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the stronghold of my life of whom shall I be afraid you see the mighty man of God depends on the words fear not can I have just about just 15 more minutes sometimes a preacher preaches and he's just trying to get to something this is where I wanted to get to the mighty man of God is marked by this that he depends on these words child fear not I seen a video and just was so profound what this man put together in some of the with sayings and I and I think he had audibly and I just wrote him down most Christians listen very close I'll repeat this twice most Christians never have the luxury of hearing the words fear not because they never attempt anything great enough in life to Merit the command are you here most Christians never hear the words fear not because in their life they were satisfied with mediocris they never attempted anything in their life that challenged them to a place to where they needed to hear the words of their father don't fear most people spend their life fearing the wrong things I'm not telling you to be a man without fear but you're to fear the right things that Solomon said uh that the beginning of of the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom you're to fear the right things let me say this Don't Fear the attack of Satan you say oh brother Matt that's so opposite I mean you know I'm just praying Lord oh protect me God I'm so afraid the devil's going to attack my life I'm so afraid he's going to attack my family you're fearing the wrong thing as a mighty man of God Don't Fear the attack of Satan are you ready but rather fear that you never make Satan's hit list amen I know your brain just shifted around like what did he just say Don't Fear the attack of Satan but what you should actually fear is that you live a life so small the devil don't even know who you are Matt Watkins who's that he ain't disrupting nothing I've never even heard his name you're to fear a life that you so depend upon others and you never attempt anything for the kingdom of God you're friend I'm trying to inspire somebody tonight this isn't about a message that's just filled with ministers but there's a body there's a Ley that has a position and they have a place and they have a role and God needs you in action fear that you never make the devil's Hit List Don't Fear The Unknown but rather fear that you never get to find out what's beyond the unknown don't fear a life of dark trials don't fear a life of dark trials tests but actually fear a life of complacence fear a life easy fear of life that's just normal don't fear dark tribes you know I just came through last August the darkest trial I've ever been through in my life without unparalleled to anything I've ever faced thought I'd faced dark trials till last August last August we were having special meetings at our church and we had uh Friday Saturday Sunday meetings there with brother Donnie Reagan and different ministers were coming through and and uh I in my life only 30 years old 30 years young and I've never had health issues uh blessed by Health entire family no hereditary issues of health or any major complications always could see well could smell well could feel well could hear well but on August uh right at the end of August I woke up uh Friday morning on the beginning of the meetings and something was different I felt like something was in my ear and my right ear and I and I and I I felt like maybe something was stopping up or maybe like a you know like a coat or something and uh and so it just seemed like I almost like something was clogged in there so I kept you know fill in my ear to feel if there was anything in there and it seemed like as the day went on it got worse and it all it got to the point to where if you take your hand over over your ear do that right now just take your hand over your ear and talk you can actually hear uh it sounds muffled you sound the muffling that's what it sounded like but without my hand of course and and it just felt like you know it just got worse and I told my wife I said you know I got something I don't know what it is so I'll go in and I went to the GNC and got those anybody ever took those ear candles anybody ever done that man it is amazing what can come out of your head I mean it's amazing and so I took this ear candle and man I did one and all this wax came out and I thought oh there was the problem and then I I did another one and all this wax came out I mean it was so much not to gross you out but I actually took pictures of it I just I couldn't believe it I I could not believe it I thought for sure you know that was the that was the deal well that didn't help it seemed like it just got worse went to service that night and led songs and well when I got out uh uh there at the from leading songs it I had such a such a piercing uh uh sound like a a a ring just a loud sharp ring tonius and and and and you know the the hearing just seemed like it was real muffled and and could barely hear you know and so we have two doctors for in our church and I I texted one and said can you meet me after the song service and he had is you know the thing they look at in your ear and so he sat me down in the back and he looked and he said oh it's probably something you know uh I think he said conductive or something in your ear that's actually blocking he looked and he said he said you know that's strange he said there's nothing in there said your ear just as clean as a whistle he said um he said you know um he said I don't know uh that's from that ear candle he said you know there's nothing in there any he said um he said can you can you hear this and he took his he took his finger and he went like that and just rubbed it together and if you do that right beside your ear you could hear it and he said can you hear that I said yeah I can I can hear it but it's muffled said okay he said I don't know what it is he said but I'm going to put you on steroids and on uh three or four different decongestive things and he said just on Monday go see the ENT and and I'm sure you'll be fun well Saturday uh I woke up and it was worse um Saturday night after the song service when I got got done all I heard in my ear was a loud ring I went totally deaf couldn't hear nothing just couldn't could do this and couldn't hear nothing I could take my finger and stick it in my ear and you could hear your finger I couldn't hear nothing like it was like I was almost numb and so I you know I begin to just um worry and that night um at about 3:00 in the morning or so whatever time it was woke up to use the restroom and when I got out of out of bed I literally put a foot on the floor and the next thing I know I I thought I hit a wall because I just came to an instant stop and I realized I was on the floor and I looked up and I could see in the dark there in the ciling fan and the entire world was just moving just as fast as it could and I I tried to think man what is happening I tried to stand up and when I stood up I would fall back over on on the floor and I was just rolling around started to becoming fearful I thought I was I be honest I thought I was passing away I have some heart attack or something this is what it feels like and I almost screamed out to my wife to yell out but then I I realized it's dizziness it's vertigo and so I I crawled and I crawled to my living room and I crawled up on the couch and as I was looking everything was just spinning around and spinning around and I just would close my eyes and I'd open it and still be spinning around listen friend if you've never experienced that I promise you have no idea no idea you could only imagine what what it's like this extreme vertigo it's just like the feeling when if you ever been spunner around and spun around and when you first stop you the world is going like this it's that same exact feeling but it never gets straight again and I began to get nauseous like seasick and and and vomit like I was on a boat because everything was just moving and rolling around and my I just laid there for hours finally fell back to sleep thinking you know you sometimes you think you wake up and feel better woke up and it was just as bad my wife walks in and I said I've got to tell you something something's different I don't know what's happened I don't know if I need to go to the ER so I called the doctor he said that's vertigo you know um there's nothing really you can do about it so anyway it got worse and and and and actually on Sunday morning service I uh my wife drove and I couldn't drive of course and and I just uh was helped into the the sound booth and I laid down on the back floor because that's all I could do just to be part of the service no one knew about it from my family my dad and mom they had prayer for me brother Donnie had prayer for me seemed like you know that the devil was just so fighting and and and it and it just seemed like it would it was getting worse and I can't even explain to you how I'm not doing this to have pity by no means I know people have have had a lot worse than that but uh but it just got worse and then by that night I had totally lost my balance and there I don't know how to explain that to you other than I lost my balance and you know it's amazing the things you take for granted in your life that work on autopilot and you don't even think about taking a step and and it working but when you lose that and you and and you and you stand somewhere and you fall from one side to the other and you can't stay upright it's very scary and so you know the night wore on and and and and we did a my wife did a maneuver called the hallpike maneuver that can help with vertigo and you take your head and lean yourself back and you look at an object and when she did that and she laid my head back and I looked at our piano she jumped backwards and she said are you doing that on purpose and I said doing what she said you don't know what you're doing and I said no she said it looks like you're having a seizure I said I'm not having a seizure she said your eyes are going like this just as fast she said I can't even make them out they're just moving that's where the vertigo comes from everything's moving so the next Monday I uh that Monday I went to the uh the ear nose and throat doctor and and just got helped in and he took me to the back and they did a hearing test anybody that's ever done a hearing test will be familiar with this but they take you into a soundproof room and the audiologist uh is in the the back and he's he's in the room and he speaks to you audibly and and they put on these almost like earbuds uh very different but like earbuds in your ears and they give you a clicker and they give frequencies of sound like a uh like w you click every time you hear the sound the frequency goes higher and it goes less and lower and lower so my left ear man I'm just click click click click click click click click he says okay I'm going to say 20 words in your left ear repeat what I say I said more 20 for 20 said okay Mr Ro I'm going to test your right ear and click when you hear a noise no clicker couldn't hear nothing not one he comes back on and he says uh Mr Watkins said I'm GNA say 20 words if you can say anything even if you think you hear what I'm saying I never heard nothing I almost thought the machine wasn't working and so he comes in and he opens the door he says um he says the doctor will see you just in room three so I went in there all the doctor comes in and he says well I have good news and bad news he said um the bad news is is that you have sudden sensored neuro hearing lws affects 5,000 humans in the uh United States of America and he said um it is an uh idiopathic which medically speaking that means that they don't have an explanation it just happens they don't they can't explain it they think he said what we believe is you have an audio nerve that goes from your brain to your ear and he said and that nerve sits in a bone and he said in a virus attacks the nerve and the nerve swells because it's in a bone it dies nerves don't regenerate you're deaf in your right ear you'll never hear again and he said um he said you have what's called we have we have bad hearing loss we have devastating hearing loss then we have profound hearing loss and he said then we have just no hearing at all he said your decimal chart on my left ear was very good the right ear was just a flatline he said you're deaf and he said and it's incurable there's no remedy there's no surgery no amount of money he said uh there's nothing we could do he said he said it's a it's a virus nerves don't regenerate he said um you know he said there's he said the good news is that people live can live mostly a normal life with a bilateral hearing which was hearing on one ear he said a hearing aid wouldn't do you any good hearing aids only amplify bad sound you don't have any sound and he said for some reason uh we've had studies and tests and he said he said when a person has vertigo and they have worse than 60 60 I think it's 60 decimal you could Google gole this it's all over the I had already Googled a lot of this before I went and he said when it's worse than 60 decimals and there's vertigo he said the recovery is zero we don't have a statistic he said sometimes when you have maybe 40% hearing loss you can through steroids and a trial of steroids he said you could over you know a few weeks you can get some hearing back he said nothing we could do he said we could put you on a trial of steroids you know just to do it he said and then you'll come back in 3 weeks and basically that'll be for us to tell you there's nothing else we can do for you we release you as a patient makes us not liable blah blah blah and you know uh he said you know so we're going to do that I was devastated can I speak honest can I be transparent I was real low as low as I can get anybody that studies personalities I'm a very uh optimistic person a popular sangin and and very upbeat takes a lot to get me down and I remember laying there on my couch and the vertigo he said the ver vertigo would go will go away he said you may have to do Rehabilitation for your balance and to learn how to basically walk again and walk correctly he said that'll go away he said but everything in Balance happens in the ear it's amazing what you hear is what gives you balance and he says that he says that um you know that that you know we'll see you again in three weeks so I go home and you know I was laying there on my couch and just that's about all I could do was confine just totally debilitating and I was praying and praying just asking the Lord you know not understanding you know you you sometimes go through these things and you just don't understand say you know life was so normal and life changes just like that wow it's amazing how quickly you just take something for granted and you know the devil starts attacking your mind and you'll never hear your kids' voices again correctly and how you should hear them and you know you'll be this that and the other and he told me he said socially your life is going to be be worse and I knew that that was true we went to a men's meeting there and brother Barry had there in Tennessee and I hated going to the cafeteria because I couldn't hear anything when I got when I was oneon-one I could hear but when I got into a room with a lot of people people would talk to me and and the other thing is that you lose is you lose sound localization you only localize sound in other words if you hear something a phone would ring two ears is required to know where that's coming from so my phone would ring and my wife would have to tell me go get it she would tell me where it's at and CU I didn't know I would walk walk in and I would call for my wife and she'd say she'd have to tell me she learned learned to say I'm in the girls' room because for me it sounded like she was here in the in the bathroom in the kitchen in the dining room I couldn't tell where anything was coming from I sat down on the table with six brothers and a brother said Hey Brother Matt and I literally went like this and I looked at every single one till I found the person looking at me I said hi did you say hi he said yeah okay because I didn't know honestly who said it and uh and it was so just so depressing and and I laid there on my couch and I remember I was just praying and and asking the Lord have read some you know uh some things brother brandom had a healing thoughts book and just some things I was reading and read some little devotional from Spurgeon and and you know and a brother had called me and I I don't want to be too much long is this okay just a few minutes so I I I was laying there and I do one thing I do on the side is I help churches when and not just churches but different businesses do Media Solutions so I'll go in and set up the live stream and video cameras and different things so I did this for a church and uh and the church had called me the brother called me I wasn't there in church being Wednesday night I was home and uh and he said brother mat he said you know he said can you get on and look at our stream make sure everything looks good if there's any suggestions for adjustment so I said sure I could do that I was laying there on my couch and and as soon as I tuned in the pastor uh was up there and the pastor right when I tune in the first words out of his mouth he says well you all know brother Bill here at the church so he's a very quiet brother and assuming he doesn't Minister he doesn't speak he said you know and he and he he just comes and he goes and he says but the Lord has used him and you know that this church knows how the Lord has used him and given him something uh from the Lord a message from the Lord and it'll be for somebody in a specific situation and he said and and you know we've seen that happen he said brother Bill approached me three months ago and he gave me just a little sticky a notepad and he said it had a message on it so I took that message back and I read it and I thought well Lord you know thank you for whatever that is and what it's for and he said I just put on my back office and he said I just committed it to the Lord he said well brother bill came to me tonight and said brother I don't want to offend you but that note was not for you the Lord told me tonight that note's for somebody else they may not even go to this church but you must read it tonight my one ear was listening I was tuned in and and he said so I'm going to read it he said for whoever use for he said I'm going to read it then we're going to go to our scripture we'll leave it at that' this is what the note says when you don't understand what's happening and you can't control it don't fear don't move don't be Hasty just be still and wait on the Lord he's moving and you know you hear things like that but something about it spoke directly to my soul I begin to weep and cry and and just cry and just think Lord thank you that I feel like that message was so for me yeah and my wife you know I called her and I called her crying and tell her and she said well you know what's wrong I said no I said I'm having Joy I said that it was just accident you know I happen stance I don't believe it was it was the Lord and I and I happened to tune in and this pastor says this and I said honey I just believe that's for me my wife began to weep she said did you not read what I put on the refrigerator last week before all this happened said no she said you didn't read it said no she said just listen real close she said or said just listen real close let me go get it she says this is from a a streams in the desert Charles Coen a 19 1800s writer write a little devotional book and she would read it she took it and she put it on the fridge she said I'm going to read it to you when you don't understand what's happening around you and it seems your father has a most cruel and horrible fate don't be Hasty don't move God is moving only wait [Music] hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God I begin to rejoice and I begin to cry and oh friend if I'm uh this is so close to my heart tonight it's hard for me to talk about because this was so emotional for me and I begin to pray and I said Lord you care something so small but you care so much yes and you spoke so directly time goes on and and we wait and I go back from my 3-we visit and I knew something had changed something's better than it was didn't seem like much but it seemed like something was better I go in there and and uh and and and and I go to the the doctor for my follow-up visit which is them to say we can't do nothing you know goodbye you know and and live life be happy with one ear and so I I go and and the audiologist takes me back to the room and he says Mr Watkins this is just standard we have to test you you know before you go in you know it's going to cost you but we have to do it I said okay do it so we go back there we do the same hearing test we're going to test your left ear here comes the noises beep beep beep beep say the 20 words 20 words said now we're going to test your right ear and when I test my rer I closed my eyes I knew something I was going to hear something and there it was beep beep Hall Hallelujah Glory [Applause] hallelujah amen it wasn't as loud and I didn't click as many times as I was my left ear but I could tell something was different and the man the a all just came back on he said that's amazing he said Mr Watkins you heard some of those noises you didn't hear them all it's not as good as your left ear he said but but it's incredible he said I want to try something I'm going to coming loud he said but I want to try I'm going to speak those 20 words it's called your discrim your your ability to discriminate a sound from a word he said what people don't understand is that you have tiny little bitty hairs not the hairs you see but inside your inner your middle ear he said you have tiny little hair follicles that are microscopic sound waves actually pass over those hairs and they vibrate send vibrations to the brain and that's what turns sound a whoosing of noise into discernable a bird a person speaking a sound of a car and he's said when this happens to people those hairs die he said so even when people get noise back he said I want to make sure you can discriminate words I said okay he said I'm going to say 20 he said if you can hear anything even if it sounds like you you hear a word and it may not be correct say whatever you think it is he said 20 I got 18 hallelujah praise the Lord my God is awesome he can and move Mountain keep me in the valley hide me from the rain you know what happened I go from that and and and I go back into the doctor he said the doctor's going to be excited he's going to want to see this I go to the doctor he walks in he says well you proved me wrong he said amazing he said now Mr Watkins he said I'm going to be honest with you he said your hearing is not great he said it's it's better than it was he said in fact if we were to put a hearing aid in your ear you'd have perfectly normal hearing like anybody else he said it's it's amazing he didn't call it a miracle of course being a doctor uh he he just said he said it's amazing he said he said it's quite amazing he said that you know these things don't regenerate he said somehow you have some hearing back he said you have about 40 decimals back which sounds like a lot but it wasn't that great through the grace of God through since that visit my hearing's gotten better and better better and better amen to God is God's awesome and today I I still have a very slight tontis ring that I live with at all times I believe God who started a work can finish what he started and I don't have I don't have perfect hearing so if you've said something to me over this weekend in my right and I didn't respond it was simply because that I it's hard for me to hear a whisper still on this side but I can hear and I'm so thankful it it it it it it it calls me to come to this place in my life as I close I'll close on this that you're not to fear a life of dark trials and let me say this so many times we because we believe in a rapture we believe in a body change but sometimes if we're not careful we disconnect from this life's reality don't fear dark trials don't fear tribulation don't feel sorrow you know why and I hope this doesn't disturb you it's only a matter of time before it comes your way I know that's a stark reality but that's life Jesus said in this world you will have tribulation but fear not amen I overcame the world I overcame this world Hallelujah don't fear a life of dark trials and tests because it's only a matter of time before they come a mighty man of God doesn't spend his life fearing the wrong things but he fears the right things he doesn't fear a life of dark trials and tests but actually he fears a life of ease and complacency and spiritual laziness one of my greatest fears in life and I'll say this as we're closing one of my greatest fear in life as I thought on this and I begin to think of the Gospel that we have and the truth that we have and let me say this friend as brother bam said and I'll repeat it this is a bloody gospel it is there have been lives whove literally stood and gave their entire life for this Truth for this truth that we have there have been people burned at Stakes there have been people ran over there have been people torn asunder there have been people torn apart the Bible says torn asunder of whom the world is not worthy when I begin to think about this that there have been people who have literally given as the prophet said some will be given a crown on that day because they have given their lives but some will be given a crown because they have striven for everything in their life I don't want my life to be named as a life who sat on the sideline and watched everything go by but I want to say Lord let me strive let me press let me run this race with patience that you've set before me don't let me be a complainer and a grumbler and a mumbler and oh Lord why does this happen and why does that happen let me say like job though you slay me yet I'll serve you oh you're better than life oh Lord there have been people who have literally been burning a steak for this gospel deny Christ or I'll take your child I'll take your husband I'll take everything you have and I'll burn it down with you inside of it you say brother matth that sounds so harsh that was a reality for your brothers and your sisters and my greatest fear in life my greatest fear in life is that I run my entire race and I come before that day and those people and I hear the story of Jon of Arc and I hear the story of polycarp and I hear the story of these Martyrs of the faith who stood the test of time and who stood their trial of death there Gethsemane what I'm afraid we in the message fail to realize is that every age came through a Gethsemane yes there had to be every age had to come through the pressing of the olives every age had to come through their trials and we say oh I'm so glad I didn't live in that age of Jon of Arc and of polycarp and of all these Martyrs I'm so glad I didn't have to give my life what you fail to realize is that the spirit that attacked them is a Confluence and a mixing of all those Spirits together that are in this age to attack you and the only way they overcame was not by human ability but because God released an anointing for the believer that met the challenge of their day let me tell you friend this word is enough to meet the challenge of the [Applause] devil hallu every age had their Gethsemane and every gay age had their dying out and we think somehow we've slipped and missed ours and then somehow we'll be spared and we'll just live lives and live happy and get rich and you know get everything and be raptured and all live happily ever after my greatest fear friend is to stand before polycarp to stand before those Martyrs and they tell me their story and then they look at me and they say what do you do tell me your story what did you overcome my greatest fear is that I'll have to look them in the eye and think over my life and think really what have I done all I've done is Grumble and complain and argue with my brother and my sister and fight and fuss complain about bills and complain about little things that don't mean I have any value at all oh life seems so small sometimes my greatest fear is that I have to that my entire life has been crowned as the prophet said with a crabby Spirit upset and and mad about everything and fly off the handle over everything oh friend it ought to shake us tonight God has not called us to be normal God is looking for a unique class of people that will be to say I'm not as satisfied to be the top 30 something inside of me says I am an elected family member of God and I want to press towards the Mark of the High Calling oh I have heard of Christians long ago they were brought before a tyrant's throne they were told that he would spare their life if they would just renounce that wonderful name of Christ but one by one they chose to die That Wonderful Name of Christ they would not deny and like like a great Angelic choir sing can you almost hear it friend can you almost hear their voices ring I pledge allegiance to the Lamb with all my strength with all that I am I will seek to honor his command I pledge allegiance to the lamb I refuse to Live Like a Lady of sin I refuse to live defeated

throne let me face my giant let me face my lion give me my Mountain as Caleb said not what God did for somebody else in another age or another time but let me stand before those Martyrs and say by his grace by his Mercy I made it oh Lord Jesus our hearts are heavy Lord father as I think of this those men and those precious women those precious sisters and brothers elected family of God who sealed their life with their own testimony who chose they didn't it wasn't forced upon them but they made a choice they made a conscious choice to say I'm not going to be like everybody else I've been
