shelby till we die Amen or til we going to rapture amen amen let's just stand in honor of the word of the Lord we'll go right into the message this morning we'll go to John chapter 4 I want to speak a message this morning called the fountain of living water amen the fountain of living water this has been a wonderful message to go through the Scriptures on I've just had a good time last night as I was thinking about this and this morning as I got up came here and it's going through the scriptures is just all the scriptures say when they just start meshing and flowing together you know there's nothing like it in the world amen so let's read from John chapter 4 we'll read from the 13th verse remember this is the woman at the well amen and Jesus is speaking to her and he says jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life Amen Lissa Speier has a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just want to thank you Lord for your gospel father for Laura has given us light all the day long father it's your gospel Lord that you used to change us Lord to lead us into you father and for that we thank you Lord for giving it unto us Lord and as we read from your gospel this morning father all the verses that we've written down and whatever you make quicken to us Lord we pray father that you would open the hearts of every person father flora when their people come into this room they come to have their hearts searched father and I pray Lord that you would do that this morning faithfully like you always do and we just submit ourselves unto you this morning father in the name of Lord Jesus Christ for you to take control and we just think you father for all things in your name we pray amen amen you can be seated hey man I think you all remember this is a very familiar scripture a familiar story about how Jesus was traveling and he told his disciples I have needs to go by Samaria amen and I just I love the way that's written because Christ had a neat you know it's nice to think about what Christ has needs up and when you think about he had needs to go by Samaria there was someone down there that had a neat Amen there was a seed down there that was thirsty amen and he was gonna go down there and give that seed that was thirsty give it some living water amen because I give that seed some living water amen so what'd he do he went down and he met her at the very place where she was getting her natural water amen so if she would go and she was like you know I need to a little thirsty I need to get some water for the next day for cooking for all the things I have Nita for the next 24 hours or whatever I go down to the well and get some water amen the water will supply all my needs for the next day and then when it runs out I'll go back down to the wat well again the next day and I all gather more water for the next day that was her daily habit to go down there and get water but on this day was unlike other days amen because when she went down to get water to supply her needs for this day there was a need that was in her heart that was not being met by the daily water that she was getting amen because she had a need to be saved she had a need to be filled with the Holy Ghost she had a need that the promise of Jehovah would come upon her amen why because there was a seed deep down on the inside of her that was crying out for water amen and no matter how much water should get it out of that well that water that she drank could never touch the seed that was within her heart amen because that that seed will only grow by the everlasting water from Jehovah amen that that seed can never grow by any natural water there's nothing that we can do to make that seed grow but once that seed ever comes in contact with the living water from Jesus Christ then that seed will begin to grow amen and so if you are in this church this morning amen and you a seed within yourself if it hasn't grown yet if it hasn't borne any fruits yet if you're not doing anything in the kingdom of your father let me tell you that seed needs to come in contact with the living water amen their Christ has a water that seed will only respond to one type of water it won't respond to anything natural this world you can do it won't respond to you the habits of this life or the things that we enjoy won't respond to our cell phones they won't respond to our jobs or our careers they won't respond to our schooling or anything else that we might do but there is a seed that God gave us that's deep down the inside of us that will only respond to the water that Jesus Christ can give a man once it come brings it into contact with that water then Christ will give you water and you will never thirst again that's quite a promise I have water to give you and if you drink of this water you will never ever thirst again and the woman when she heard that promise she said I come I have to come to this well every single day amen only I can only carry out so much just enough to last for the day and you could make me so I don't have to toil and come here every day this is amazing this is gonna give me so much time but you don't know what he is doing was he was offering her rest a mint he was offering her rest from all the foolishness that she had going on in her life amen you know what I mean so when Jesus got there he got down to the well he had a purpose in his heart he sent his disciples away amen and he's because he knew that he had water they had to bring into contact with the seed amen so the seed that was deep down inside of her heart in order to get access to that seat he just sat down and just waited for her to come amen as soon as he came the the spirit of Jesus Christ began searching her heart what was he doing he's looking for that see he's looking to find out what is stopping the water from getting to the seat I mean what what is preventing it what why is there a drought here what what's going on that the water is not getting to the seat because he could see that there was no fruits of his life in her life amen there was no fruits of the the seed that he had given her before the foundation of the world was not bearing any fruit amen and so they began to talk to her and began to get a sense of what her spirit was what her nature was what her habits were what she did right what she did wrong and throughout all that he couldn't find any evidence of the fruits of the seed that he had given her a man named now God has given all of us the opportunity to have the seed amen amen if you're here in this building this morning amen you are brought here because of a thirst inside of your heart amen and there is a thirst why is there a thirst because there's something inside of you that needs to come to the well to come to living water amen and all of us come here why because there is something inside of us this thirsting for living water amen well God has that living water for you amen and when as soon as you bring that seed into contact with the water it begins to bear fruit it begins to grow amen God has a water for you that if you drink of that water you will never thirst again and by never thirst and again that means that that seed will grow and grow and grow and will push out fruits and branches and leaves you know keep growing because there is a everlasting supply it's like a tree that is planted by the rivers of living water amen why because they continually thirst if that tree is never thirsty because I can never thirst again because it is tapped into the mainspring the river of flowing water will to where there can be no drought that's to be the description of every Christian amen so when Jesus Christ got down to the well and found out that that was not the description of this woman amen then he sat down and he began to search her heart you know the Holy Spirit still does that you know that is a process that has never ceased Jesus Christ will still meet you wherever it is that you're trying to fulfill these desires amen whatever you're doing to fulfill your natural thirst he'll meet you right there and he'll just search your heart amen whatever it is you're doing to fulfill the natural desires of your life you think you're going there to to fulfill some natural thing in your mind and Christ will just sit there and begin talking to you amen the Holy Spirit what's he doing he searches your hearts let's just I want to read a couple scriptures here let's turn over to Romans chapter eight Romans eight and 26 he says likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God amen and that is happening right now that is happening right now you have come to the well this morning amen and the Holy Spirit is here to search your heart he is here to find out exactly what you have need of amen and as he searches your heart he is finding out what you have need of what do you have need of what are you lacking why are you not bearing fruit like you're supposed to bear fruit why are you not rejoicing the way you're supposed to rejoice Amen why do you know I have a revival the way you're supposed to have revival it is they begin searching and searching what does he do he knows the every single thing about your heart amen amen so and then what what is he doing he discovers the knees it says in verse 26 likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities because we don't know how we should pray the spirit we you know we don't always know exactly what's wrong with us amen we don't always know why we're not living the way we ought to live but this spirit helps us by praying for us by discovering why is the seed not getting the water like it's supposed to why is the tree that was supposed to be planted by the rivers of living water why is it not bearing fruit like it's supposed to amen what what is the matter here and I will help your infirmities I will pray for you I will meet you at the well amen and I will pray for you and I will bring you and I'll give you this water and if you can ever get in contact with this water you will never thirst again what a promise that was that promise wasn't just to the woman at the world it wasn't just that Samaritan this wasn't a one-time thing no God is still doing that today and he will do it for you God will search your heart you know who's else heart he searches let's go to 1st Corinthians 2:9 the Holy Spirit searches the hearts 1st Corinthians 2:9 as it says but as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard nor have entered into the heart of man the things that God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of God amen so there's somewhere no that means there is a divine purpose beyond God visiting us the well because the Holy Spirit has searched the heart of God doesn't just search your heart he goes he searches his own heart he finds out what the will of the father is for your life and he comes down to you and he wants to give you that eternal will amen to get our minds off the blinders of this age get our eyes away from just thinking about these natural things but let me tell you my father has prepared something for you a man from before the foundation of the world is he said I've I believe here I go to prepare a place for you and I will come and receive you again unto myself but if I leave you I will go and prepare a place for you a man saw was he done he is gone and he says no man I is not seen the ear is not heard neither have it entered into the heart of man the things that God has prepared for them that love him amen that's those that have met him down at the well those that met him down at the well at the river living water they partook of the living water they'll never thirst again and he has prepared something for you the eye has not seen it neither has the ear heard of it it hasn't even entered into your heart the joy that it could be a meant but God has revealed them unto us by his Spirit for the spirit searches all the things yea the deep things of God and when God begins to reveal this eternal purpose to you it gives you a steadfastness that you're not here to further your career you're not here just to raise a family you're not here just to build your house you're not here just to grow up and get a good job amen but you're here because you will never ever die amen now think about this body is just a temporal body this body that we are living in right now is just a temporary body it was given to us to meet our needs for the time being while we learn these things down here through the things that we suffer amen amen and we learn these things but there's a spirit down on the inside of us that must have a body amen and it has a body but one of these days we will trade this body in for another body and in a moment in a twinkling of an eye of an eye at that last day this body will begin to disappear and we'll be given a body like his glorious body I will be changed and when we see him we will be like him hey man it will be flesh of his flesh bone of his bone amen so our soul has changed to be like his soul our spirit has changed to be like his spirit and then our body gets to be changed like his body it's a process that we were going through why why why all that because in the very beginning we had a seed that was like under his seat a mint and the seed must have a body amen amen but I remember this body is only temporary but God has prepared a body for you God has prepared a tabernacle for you to live in amen amen you know the Jews typed it out in so many ways through all our feasts and all those things you know you think about how the rejoicing that they had all the day long their harvests you know the land of Israel was dependent upon the ring of God they had their their crops the eating the God told them when they were leaving Egypt and they're coming into the Promised Land he told them in the book of Deuteronomy he says the land that you're going into is not like the land of Egypt and he tells them he says in the land of Egypt you had irrigation channels and you would have to dig these channels and then the water would come down through the river and and they would go flow through these channels and you'd always have always have water for your crops and God told them by the prophet Moses the land of Israel is not like the land of Egypt amen you know that's true the land of this of this Holy Spirit life is not like that natural life it's not like the life that we live back there amen but he told them by the prophet Moses he says the land of Israel is not like the land of Egypt you're not going to water your crops through irrigation you're not gonna dig channels for the water to flow through he says how you're going to get the water for your crops is you're gonna pray to me for a rain and I will bring you rain as do season four they even itch her into the land he told them he says if you listen to me and you obey my Commandments I will bring you the latter rain and the former rain is due season if you want your crops or grow good just pray to me I will send you the rain I will be your source of water you don't have to dig no channels you don't have to trust in your own Labor's you don't have to trust in this or in the river all you got to do is just trust in me and I will provide you water see God has been doing this for a long long long time amen he has always been the fountain of living water he's always wanted to make sure that his people understood thoroughly that if you need water you come to me whatever you have need of in this life's journey you come to me and I will be your source I will be I will provide for all of your needs I will be Jehovah Jireh to you and I will be providing for your needs don't go off over here and look to this don't do the way of the Egyptians don't trust in your own self itself but just trust in me and I'll provide for you hey man he came to the woman at the well and he found out that she was trusting and some man made well that was made thousands of years ago hey man it wasn't changing her it wasn't do anything for her she is still living in her sins she had a seed of God but it wasn't doing anything for she wasn't she wasn't it wasn't producing anything she had a seed there so he met her and said you need to get this water from me amen you don't need to beasts going over here to the well you don't need to be going over here but just come to me I'll give you water when you will never thirst again amen he is the fountain of living water amen you will never thirst again you know this fountain of living water is a flowing fountain a man it's not a stagnated pool it doesn't just sit there but it's always refreshed you know of a while back our dishwasher was broken and my kids were having to remember how to do dishes by hand and they were you know and sometimes you know you do you have so many dishes to do and pretty soon your dish water when you started was a dish as a sink full of clean water and it's full of soap suds but you know after you washed so many dishes all of a sudden the water will used to be clear is now turned gray all your soap suds are gone and there's grease in your water and you look at that and you know and you have to kind of remind your children you know you cannot use this water to clean anything when the water gets to this condition Amen it will no longer clean anything amen now when the water was clear and there were soap suds in it you could have somewhat kind of a faith that if you put a dish in there and you scrub it on all around it then when you pull back up all the grease will be gone all the dirt and crumbs will be gone amen you could run your finger across it with those squeaks please do you think why cuz it's squeaky clean amen but when you but when you try to but when your water turns gray and the soap suds are gone and it's full of grease and you put your greasy dish in there and you scrub it for a while and you bring it out and scrubber on the other side you pull it out and you rub your finger across it it just slides roll it why because it's already greased amen why because that water couldn't get the grease off amen it's become a stagnated pool of water amen let's throw her to Jeremiah Jeremiah chapter 2 God's been talking about water for a long time a mine jerem and jeremiah chapter two in the third and the twelfth verse he is commanding the heavens to be astonished he's speaking to the heavens and he's just basically commanding all of creation look at this amen verse 12 Jeremiah 2:12 be astonished Oh II heavens at this and be horribly afraid my god is speaking no it's a strong language Jehovah God the fountain of living water is speaking to all creation and he's telling it be astonished and be very afraid know what could bring creation into the sphere be astonished oh he heavens at this and be horribly afraid be very desolate saith the Lord for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters and have hewed them out cisterns broken cisterns that can hold no water and when the people fall all creation suffers a mint my people have committed these two evils I was the fountain of living water when they enter into this land I commanded them this land is not like the land of Egypt Amen you won't get your crops through irrigation but you'll get your crops through praying to me and you'll get water for your crops by praying to me amen and when they quit serving the Lord it says if you ever forsake me and go to your to the other gods or the gods of your neighbors then I will speak to the heavens and I all the heavens will withhold their rain from you amen and that is what is happening in this in this very thing because their sins were caused it so the heavens were now becoming unreliable amen amen they were trying to live in the land of Jehovah but not trust Jehovah for the rain so they forsook Jehovah the fountain of ever flowing water a man they forsook him the one that would provide them with water and when they began to run out of water they dug themselves cisterns holes in the ground and they would try to hold over water from another age aiming and that water would get stagnated amen I'd have things growing in it it was leaked out amen and run out at the worst time amen if they had anything all be left to be a little pool with bugs in it amen and then and God says commands to the heavens oh heavens be afraid be astonished at this I used to command you o heavens to rain down upon my people but look at them they are no longer living according to my plan they're no longer living according to my laws so be afraid you will no longer be providing water for my people because they're trying to live if I get their water through sisters or some other way they may you know some people try to live this life without pre hey man some people try to live this life without reading their Bible a man some people try to live this life and come to church and call themselves a Christian yet inside themselves they just have this cistern where they're trying to hold hold this little bit of water from when they read their Bible two months ago the last time or were the last time they met Jehovah was three months ago and they're trying to hold this a little bit of an experience inside of themselves because it's been a long time since they've met the Lord Jesus Christ and God calls to the heavens stop the rain my people are no longer seeking after me the one true God but they've went off and they sought the gods of the people around them amen and so what does he do he calls to the heavens stop the rain amen remember about six weeks ago we preached a message when Iced preaching on the return to righteousness and where we read that verse in Haggai chapter 1 let's just turn over to it Haggai chapter 1 verse 11 I found out in Iowa City and French it's pronounced AG AG hey guy second-to-last book in the Old Testament and just kind of recap what we preach on I think it's about six weeks ago or so we read this verse here but we only read the first six words of it Haggai 1:11 and we read it and it says there in verse 11 says and I called for a drought and the basis of the message was is here the people the children of Israel were living in a day of restoration they are living in a day where they come out of the Babylonian captivity they had come back into the promised land they had been given everything they had need of to restore their national life to restore the temple they've been given gold and silver and money by serous the king of Persia amen when he gave out the game in the commandment leave Babylon or Persia go back to Jerusalem build yourself a temple there and worship the God of your father's you can't get much better than that amen and when they and when they got back there and that they when they got back there that they had everything they had need up to restore to have a restoration and instead they just built their own houses and instead they took all the money that they had a head up and in because Haggai chapter one takes place sixteen years after Ezra chapter one so Ezra chapter one they're the Kyocera Sims them back they have all the goal hold the money the silver the HR into Jerusalem they're there they're going to rebuild their temple they can restore their national life they're gonna pray to Jehovah again they're gonna build their crops again they're gonna do all those all these things and they're gonna live life like they used to before the Babylonian captivity amen but they can in this day of restoration amen God 16 years later God sends a prophet knocking at their door why because sick after 16 years of living in this day of restoration God sends a prophet at their door and he says Jehovah is calling for a drought that at the very time of the restoration of all things God's chosen people living in God's chosen land in the day of restoration of all things God is calling and speaking to the heavens I'm calling for a drought why is he calling for a drought because this time at this point I have given you everything you have need of to restore yourself to restore the temple and instead of restoring the temple as a place to praise me you went and you built your own houses and trim them out and now it's been 16 years and you haven't done anything and so God sent a prophet you know God sends his prophets to get his people whipped back into shape hey man when God's people are living in a day to where they should be doing one thing and he needs him to turn a corner and so he sends a prophet to get them to turn the corner amen those that turn that corner live along with God and live in live with him in peace joy and righteousness amen but those that ignore what the Prophet says they go keep going straight off into destruction amen and that's what it is God always sends his prophets at those Junction times where you have to turn a corner amen that's what God has done in our day he sent her prophets so that we might turn the corner so we could live in a day of restoration but I want to warn you that just like in the day of Haggai there it's now been long enough we've been living in this day of restoration because day event restoration for them was Ezra chapter one Amen but here in the book of Haggai it's been 16 years and they still hadn't done anything a man I think that God has a message for us that we need to need to be fulfilling what the Prophet told us to do amen amen we've already had our Ezra chapter one experience amen amen but it's time for us to get her getting gear amen amen and Haggai chapter 1 verse 6 it says you've sewn much but you bring in little you eat but you have not enough you drink but you're not filled with drink you put on your clothes but there's no one that's warm and he the earth wages earth wages to put it in a bag of holes and he says thus saith the Lord of hosts consider your ways go up into the mountain bring down the wood and build the house build the house of Jehovah do the first things you did the last things first and you left the first things undone I want you to come here and build my house you know these things are types for us every single one of us has a house amen he cares for you but do you care amen he is the fountain of living waters but are you drinking Amen because he has provided us the fountain but if we don't drink then how can he transform us you know my dad told me that some of the best medicine you can ever have is water some of the best medicine you can ever ever take is water hey man you know because there in reality your body knows how to heal itself God put it in your DNA that your body will be self-healing amen and really just to eat the right foods and drink enough water and your body will know how to heal itself amen amen let's turn it over to Deuteronomy chapter 11 your body knows how to heal itself why is it knowing because God told it to God put it inside your body that if you get a scratch on your hand that your body immediately goes to work taking water and the things that you eat a mint and begins rebuilding according to the pattern that's written in the DNA in your body there's a DNA in your body that it was exactly what your body is supposed to look like amen it's that DNA that created your body the first time it's God's Word from the foundation of the world it's inscribed there in the DNA in your body amen and that DNA knew how to make your body the first time amen and when your body gets sick the DNA knows how to recreate your body the second time a man so God just has to speak and give you the see the DNA on the inside and make sure it has everything it has need of the water and the raw material to recreate it the second time amen but in Deuteronomy chapter 11 verse 10 so the verse that we were speaking about it says for the land that our goal is Enterprise s it is not like the land of Egypt from whence you came out of where thou so acai seed and water sit with thy foot that's irrigation digging irrigation channels as a garden of herbs but the land where you go to possess it is a land of hills and valleys and it drinks the water of heaven it drinks the water of the rain of heaven amen this water is not like the land of Egypt but it needs to get us water from heaven and let me tell you this or you you are not like the Egyptians out there Amen you were not like the heathen out there but you are like you are the children of the Most High God and you drink the water of heaven amen and if you don't do that you will get sick amen look at verse 12 it's a land which the LORD thy God cares for for the eyes of the Lord are always upon it from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year why now he's talking about your body your body is a land that God cares for and his eyes are always upon it his eyes are upon the sparrow remember amen and it shall come to pass verse 13 if you shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day to love the Lord your God and to serve him with all your heart with all your soul now I will give you the rain of your land in his due season the first rain and the latter rain that thou may us gather it in my corn and thy wine and 9 oil and I'll send grass in thy fields for thy cattle and now that thou may us eat and be full mine verse 18 says look therefore you shall you lay up these my words in your heart and bind them these should lay out these words in your heart and in your soul and bind them for a sign upon your hand that they may be as frontlets between your eyes he shall teach them your children and speak of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou liest rises up and thou shalt write them upon the doorpost of thine house and upon thy gates God wants you to know this he wants you to remember this this land that he has given you is a land that his eyes are caring for it's his own land this your spirit your body your soul is a land that was given to you and God cares for it his eyes are upon it it's not to be water with the things of the world if you love the world or the things of the world God's not even in you amen but you're not called to be like that you're called to bring your seed that God has given you you're called to bring that seed to the fountain of living waters amen if you don't do it you're being dilatory and God will speak to the heavens and call for a drought until you come back to your senses a man some people say boy I'm just so dry it's been a long time so I had an experience with the Lord well this is why you have forsaken him for the fountain of living waters and hewed yourself out sisters of living on a past experience my you know these things are types for us to remember you know I was reading about the the Feast of the Tabernacles how many members that in sermon the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride the brother branham during that sermon he began to speak about the Feast of Tabernacles he said this is the last great feast this is the last of the Feast of the year this is when they've already they've brought in all their crops their harvests are over the last crop those to be harvested has been brought in and they come in and they are there to rejoice that that God provided them reigned throughout all their seasons amen from the barley crop all the way to the olive crop to the nuts every single crop got its rein in its season amen and all the device crops of the olives and everything was brought in and they were successful and when you come to the end of the year you were to have this eight-day feast and you were to rejoice that God had provided you everything that you had Nita and now you were to enter into his rest and enjoy the fruits of the harvest amen amen and when he called this feast he says I want you to be this to be a feast of tabernacles and he says go and build little booths outside your house and be a temporary dwelling place amen and you live in this temporary dwelling place during the eight days of this feast and on the eighth day on the seven days of the feast and on the eighth day everybody gathers together and there's a time of rejoicing it's a time of great joy amen so and brother Branham we typed that out of how they would live in their booths those seven days of the feast amen there was the seven Church ages a man you've already brought in the crops God's giving you rest the Holy Ghost amen and you're living in your Holy Ghost rest amen but on the eighth day there is a gathering a holy convocation amen on that 8th day when they everybody gathers together amen there's going to be a meeting in the air amen and the sweet sweet by-and-by we're gonna meet him up there and we're gonna be changed from this temporary dwelling place from the booth from the tabernacle this tabernacle to live and hid in a body like his glorious body God typed it out in the Old Testament so we would have faith for it in the New Testament so at the beginning they had all live in their little booths but it's just a temporary feast and throughout the church ages we all spent our the days of our lives 50 60 70 years wherever it is 80 years in these temporary booths these bodies but what we did is during the during this feast we enjoyed the fruits of our harvest with great joy everything that the reign of God brought throughout the whole year we enjoyed we enjoy the book of Genesis we enjoy the book of Deuteronomy we enjoy the book of Malachi we enjoy every word that God brought us we enjoy we enjoy all of the Bible every promise in the book is mine amen amen so we're living here in these temporary bodies these booths amen and we're enjoying every promise of God amen because every promise of God has been given to the Bride of Christ she is here to enjoy every little bit of it and throughout all the church ages every church age was to have the fullness of the whole is have the Holy Ghost in their in their age amen and here in the last day amen on the seventh day of the feast the bride comes out and she is to enjoy every promise of God every every crop everything that's been brought in amen the rains have come in her due seasons the former and the latter rain and we're to enjoy every little bit of it or enjoy every single word of the Bible hey all the full gospel amen hey we're supposed to believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we're supposed to believe it and experience it and enjoy it amen but in the last day of the feast and the eighth day there's supposed to be a day of great joy rejoicing unlike any other day a man is supposed to be a day of rejoicing where you leave your booth you go back into a house that was prepared for you a mend and leave the temporary dwelling behind and you going back into your house and you go to the temple and you rejoice or the crops and everything that God has provided for you amen I was reading I wanted to read as reading on a Jewish website they're talking about some of the some of the ceremonies that they did back in the time of Jesus during the Feast of Tabernacles amen I want to read this little quote here and this came from about 2000 years ago said he was talking about the water libation ceremony during the Feast of Tabernacles so in the Feast of Tabernacles every day the priest would take a jug of water a jug he would go down to the base of the mountain Zion and at the base of the Zion there was a spring there that spring water would come up out him and he would take that jug and he'd fill it up with water and he go up and he pour it out while they're rejoicing on the top of the mountain Amen that God was and they were supposed to do it with great joy amen and so that's what the ceremony they do that every day of the feast so they on the last day of the feast they take seven jugs of water and pour him out in a circle around the altar while they're dancing and rejoicing amen it says here in in these old Jewish writings he says whoever has not seen the celebration of the water libation has never experienced the feeling of true joy he said great lamps of gold were hoisted up they have these great columns with bowls on top and they filled with oil and they are light him on fire and they'd be on top of Mount Zion and there would be like great torches on top of Mount Zion amen and he says great lamps of gold or who stood with four golden bowls at the top of each lamp for young priests and training would climb to the top carrying immense oil jugs which they would fill which would fill these bolts and once they were lighted there was not a courtyard in all of Jerusalem that did not glow with the light that emanated from the celebration in the temple courtyard every house in Jerusalem we all sudden be filled with light from the soul of the celebration amen and the people's as the people saying the righteous and pious men would dance before them while juggling flaming torches the Levites standing on the fifteen steps that descend from the court of Israel to the women's Court would play on the Lear's and the harps and the trumpets and many other instruments two priests who blew the silver trumpets stir at the top of the stairs on either side of the entrance of the great gate of the court and this was done to honor the commandment of the water libation what the purpose of the water is is they were celebrating that every time they needed water God provided throughout the entire year all of their crops came because God provided the water amen and when they would and see if the if the what the spring at the base of Mount Zion was there because when it rained on Mount Zion the water would filter down through the mountain and pressurized the mountain and when it spring out as a little spring at the base of the mountain a man sofa quit raining the spring would go dry if it quit raining that spring would go dry but here at the very end when God had provided them everything they had need of in this life's journey that they go down with jugs of water at the spring and they would carry it up because it was a sign that God had provided them so much rain that Mount Zion in the mountain itself was filled water and it was overflowing and coming springing out at the bottom and they come out and they pour at the at the poured out on the top every day of the feast and the last day of the feast the great day they pour out seven jugs of water because God provided them water every single each of all the church ages amen God provided and then you need to take jugs of oil which came from the olives that grew from that water amen and they take the olive oil and they pour it in the lamps a man they light it on fire as giant bowl of flaming oil and they light on fire and the light would shine throughout all Jerusalem what a sign can your spiritual mind grasp this with that picture in your mind let's go over to John chapter 7 I give out three more scriptures here just want to end with John chapter 7 verse 1 after these things Jesus walked in Galilee for he would not walk and jury because the Jews sought to kill him they're trying to kill the fountain of everlasting water now the Jews Feast of Tabernacles was at hand his brethren therefore said unto Him depart hence and go into Judea that thy disciples may see the works that thou doest but there was no man that do us anything in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openly if thou do these things show thyself to the world for a neither did his brethren believe him and Jesus said unto them my time has not yet come but your time is always ready the world cannot hate you but me at hate ahthe because I testify that the works there ever evil go ye up unto this feast I go not yet I go not up yet under this feast for my time is not yet full come look at verse 10 but when his brethren were gone up then he went then he also went up unto the feast but not openly but as it were in secret amen so here comes the Feast of the Tabernacles the Jews are beginning to celebrate all that God has done for him throughout the last year God has given them their reign and due seasons he has provided them water from heaven amen all their crops grew but in the midst of this here is Jesus Christ the fountain of living waters the one that provided them all this water for their crops and they are rejecting him at the very time that they're celebrating God's providence amen and that's the situation that we're going to now when during this water ceremony where they would bring the water up they would bring it up chanting Psalms 113 through 118 so I want to turn back here to psalms 118 solves 113 and 118 were sung at all the major feasts and at land of Israel amen so Psalms 118 is the very end of what they would be singing as they would go up let's read from verse 19 as they're singing all this and they said their singing was they pour out the water they say for the 19th verse open to me the gates of righteousness I will go into them and I will praise the Lord this gate of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter I will praise thee for thou has heard me and arn't become my salvation amen they sing that they're carrying their waters up from the spring they're entering into the gates into the court and they pour him out at the altar amen I will praise thee for thou has heard me and art become my salvation the stone which the builders refused has become the headstone of the corner this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day that the Lord has made we will rejoice and be glad in it amen now we get to verse 25 he says save now that we're safe now as hosanna Amen remember when they laid down the palm branches in Jerusalem Jesus went in on a Colt of a donkey and they are going Hosanna Hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord amen then later on he told the Pharisees you will never see me again until you say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord so let's read verse 25 there again saved now I beseech thee O Lord O Lord I beseech thee sin now prosperity blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord we have blessed you out of the house of Lord amen God is the Lord which has showed us light bind the sacrifice with cords even to the horns of the altar there entering into his gates with Thanksgiving there entering into the courts with praise there bringing the water from the fountain amen there saying Hosanna you will save us you will give us deliverance Jesus is there in secret watching all this my he was the cornerstone that the builders rejected and they're singing about it as they're carrying the water up as they sing about as they finish this chapter then they had pour out the water around the altar and where the sacrifice was laid for the forgiveness of their sins and Jesus is standing there watching all this it's incredible amen now now with that in mind let's go back to John chapter 7 John chapter 7 verse 37 let's let's read from the 33rd verse right there in the midst of the Feast of Tabernacles then jesus said unto them yet a little while I am with you then I go unto him that sent me he shall seek me and shall not find me where I am thither ye cannot come and then Jesus then said the Jews unto themselves where shall he go that we should not find him let's go down to 36 there what manner of saying is this that he said ye shall seek me should not find me and where I am thither you cannot come where is he gonna go amen then in the last day this is the eighth day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried this is when they pour out the seven jugs of water on the altar Jesus stood up and cried and said if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this spake he of the Spirit that they which believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified he's giddy ready to enter into the Gentile age we would be the Feast of Tabernacles the seventh days living in our temporary Tabernacles amen the fountain of living waters there at the base of Jerusalem the Mount Zion water would reign on Mount Zion it would pressurized the mountain now at the bottom was spring a well of living water and Jesus said I am the fountain of living water if anyone thirsts let him come to me and drink and you will the Holy Spirit will come in and dwell inside of you you will become Mount Zion and out of your belly will flow the fountain of living water just like out of the base there amen you will become Mount Zion God is turning a corner and no longer will you worship here in this mountain but you worship Him in spirit and in truth hey God it's just what he told the woman at the well that no longer will you worship God at the Mount Zion or at this mountain but you I am the spring of living water coming to me and drink and I'll give you water and you'll never thirst again let me tell you if you are not ever lasting well springing out water of living water and that's because it's not raining in your life amen Amen if you do not have the fruits of Zion if you cannot rejoice before the Lord with great extending joy for the things that God is doing for you it's because you don't have any fruit amen the the Feast of Tabernacles is where they rejoice what God had done for him throughout the entire year God provided of them all from Passover all the way through God provided them everything that they had need of and now was the time to rejoice that God's water had provided everything God's water provided for the Sheep for the sacrifice provided for all the fruits and the crops and they celebrated the fountain of living water amen but jesus said the fountain of living water will now be the Holy Ghost that will dwell inside of you and if you have that Holy Ghost you will never thirst again come unto me and drink and I will give you water the Holy Spirit and you will never thirst again amen and he who celebrates this feast feast of the Tabernacles on the eighth day there'll be a holy convocation there will be a gathering if you under hear about it listen to the tape the future home of the earthly bridegroom or of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride and one brother rent that's what brother Rams talking about the Feast of the Tabernacles we are leaving the seventh day behind going into the eighth day it's he back into eternity where we leave our temporary booth behind because God has given us reign throughout all the ages God's given us the Holy Ghost and we go into a place that gods aren't prepared for us the body the house that we were supposed to live in all along a man they live in their booths the seven days of the feast the temporary houses now on the eighth day they go back in to the houses that they came from amen and then they would rejoice with great joy and the Holy Ghost amen that is where we're supposed to be living as we go into the eighth day the great gathering in a moment in a twinkling of an eye in the rapture were to be rejoicing over the things that God has done for us but in this last day if you do not have the Holy Spirit reign in your life then you're living in a dangerous hour amen amen God will provide you his reign and do seasons and you will rejoice for the things that God has done for you but when you were seeking other gods the rain will be withheld for you that's what he said hey guy and I called for a drought amen because my people for suck me the fountain of living water and hewed after them sisters which hold no water a man let's just an amen he is the one that searches the hearts a man it was a lot there was larger than that message amen but just to show you the pattern of the Bible amen he is the fountain of living water and it is the Holy Ghost and he has provided for you amen it's been the pattern for thousands and thousands of years and it's all come up to this moment so that you would know that you were supposed to be you were always supposed to be a fountain of the Holy Ghost and if you're missing out on that he's got it for you amen Heavenly Father we just want to thank you Lord for the message this morning father your Holy Spirit that was provided for us none of us should be a dry tree Lord none of us should be a tree those wilted Lord but all of us should be trees they're planted by the rivers of living water Heavenly Father famed by in this room is lacking that right now Lord I pray unto you Father the one who searches
