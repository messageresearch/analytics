time we live in you know but there won't be any more there it won't be any more tears let's sing childhood a child of the king you know I know I've told you this before but that's a song that's very near and dear to me because sister Kathy I don't know something happened with her the Holy Ghost came down on her one time when she was singing that when she was when she sang that line his royal blood now flows through my veins no she just praised the Lord so I think of that every time I sing it oh yes oh yes I'm a child of the king royal blood now flows through my veins and our who's Richard

time I used to say Lord I just want to make it I don't you know you don't have to give me a lot or name your Lord but you know and then I got to think I know I'd like to have some crowns to lay back at his feet because that that's going to be our privilege to do that it's going to honor him let's let's sing as pastor gets ready to come let's sing wherever I go wherever I go I'll praise him

[Music] surrender now I feel the secretly woo the joy of salvation glory glory to the ring Oh amen hallelujah as we stand those of us may know brother Keith is out of town for his job and show his brother Isaac I think brother Isaac got the better deal he's in Florida and I think Canada so quick somewhere he's up there somewhere he's north and the other one is south amen praise the Lord we love the Lord turn with us the idea of the 14th chapter oh I just pray that God would give me the grace to give to the church this evening what he showed me it's it's a revelation I shared it with the brother the other day at the time of the inspiration and he really was blessed by it I is something that I've seen that I'd never seen before it's simple really simple but it's powerful once you see it just given by God and I trust it somehow he would bless you and he blessed me and I know by God's grace I'll never be the same simple simple simple but really powerful Isaiah 14:13 through the 15th first love the Lord everybody there 14 starting at the 13th verse for thou have said in thine heart I will what you didn't take notes that I will a sinner to heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit upon the Mount of the congregation in the side of the north I will ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the Most High I think that's five times Satan said these things in his heart yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit it's so amazing what these scriptures are saying or this particular scripture is saying to us and by God's grace I trust the Lord will give me the grace to bring it out that is very father we come before you we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and your father I pray that somehow you would reveal yeah I can't do it Lord it's you that bring revelation to your people help us now Lord as we minister this to your people I believe it feel will for us to do this otherwise we would not even attempt to be sober so God have thine own way in Jesus Christ's name we pray you may be seated I am titled this message the will of man versus the will of God when the Lord showed me this thing I just couldn't believe that I've been reading so many things about the will of man what we choose to do you know and never thought about where it all began we know that God put us on a free moral agency and evidently all of the angels are that way too but when I thought about the will when we talk about will it means the power of choosing one's own actions or they act a process of using or certain one's choice wish or desire or to submit against one's will it is a purpose or determination even holiday or stubborn determination a willfulness to have the will to succeed and we understand that when we talk about a will you know a lot of time we say you know that person is stubborn you can say whatever you want to say to him or her and they still will not do what you asked them to do and what it is they've made a choice to assert their will over yours and when we think about the wheel we understand that Lucifer had a will and we don't know how long he served God until this evil was found in him but I want you to understand that his will to do evil was carried on to a third or whatever more angels of heaven and they all began to refuse to do what God's will was whatever it was now my thought was that Satan introduced what we call selfishness the angels in heaven all was one family was one church was one body if you want to see it like that and they always concerned about God's will not their own and we understand that when Satan's began to think of what he wanted to do versus what God wanted him to do it literally polluted heaven and there in heaven only the Word of God is exalted we understand by God's grace that when Lucifer began to do what he did as I said was like Lebanon 11 amen a portion of heaven and God had to cut that piece of leavening out and and well and they these angels that were will for self will became angels of disobedience and they were cast down to earth now selfishness is when one devoted is devoted to or caring only for oneself remember me said I will I will I will and maybe he thought about this or not I don't know of the other angels but one thing for certain God caught it in his heart before it was ever expressed now God was not ignorant God knew exactly what he was going to do before God created the angel we understand that God created vessels of Honor and vessels of dishonor or the venom basically talks about Lucifer in the sense that he really wasn't part of the family remember the scripture says if they would leave out from you they were not of you in the beginning now we're not talking about like I said a little SETI when somebody left us you know no we're talking about if they would leave the Word of God then that declares that they really were not part of you now we look at this day and it comes right on down and Lucifer comes and he's working with Adam and even he works with eat because a many understand Adam was the very word he was the original net it couldn't be hybridized and we know by God's grace that here Lucifer comes down and let me say like this before Lucifer thought came out in in how can I say it Lord Hawk in Lucifer when he thought these things as I said but before he thought what he thought there was no other thoughts available with but God and nobody knew of a rebellion nobody no angel in heaven ever thought about disobeying God in the no angel he was the first one that disobeyed God and and and and now he's contrary to the word and and he's spreading his lie among the Angels and God allowed it ha because God knew that those fallen angels would be used for this day and other days but here we find out by God's grace that here the devil comes along and not God tell Adam and Eve whatever you do this is my thoughts stay with my thoughts do my will and you'll be okay the day that you eat of this tree you shall surely die don't touch it and others don't even have fellowship with it and see you and I we thought for a long time that this tree of the knowledge of good and evil was just a tree and we didn't know that that word the tree in Genesis was just symbolic it was a symbolism of a person that God created was raised up himself and we realized Amen that when Lucifer in the form of a serpent and when I said like that he he possessed the serpent he talked to the serpent and the serpent was an intelligent being brother Adam said the only difference between that serpent and Adam was that the serpent did not have a place for the soul and we really had he didn't he had a place for the so but he had no soul so we realized by God's grace that this devil was able to talk to this being amen and we find out that this being was able to talk to Adam and Eve now you got to realize a man that he talks to Eve and he gets eat to think off of the word I'm gonna bring it he gets Eve to think off the word and when she began to think off the words she did what began to process her thoughts and her thoughts became reasonable see that reasoning is something else her thoughts became reasonable surely and that's why the devil says surely you will not die when God had already said to her the day that you eat of the street you should surely die right and so now she he's doing the same thing to her that he had done to others and and you know he himself believed his lie he believes it to this day and we realized Amen that he he said well what do you mean brother burrows understand that here was he Adam as well who stood face to face with the Tree of Life talked to the Tree of Life walk with the Tree of Life in the cool of the evening fellowship with the Tree of Life you got to understand that the tree of life was not a tree as we look at as the oak or pine the Tree of Life with Jesus Christ himself because you'll find out a man like I said the Bible said the voice of God walked in the cool of the evening you've never seen a voice walk unless the person that divorced is walking a man so we find out a man that Eve stood face-to-face with the tree of life he fellowship but for whatever reason that day she listened to the serpent right and we find out because she listened to the serpent she now leaned to her own understanding and her own understanding brought death right oh you said well that was he what about Judas who fellowship with Jesus what about three and a half years face to face the same tree of life and he leaned to his own understanding why because it was selfishness selfishness was the thing that made Lucifer fall he only considered himself he only thought about himself he only was concerned about himself whether you realize it or not he's still the same way he has not changed he will cause you to lie steal cheat to promote himself it's not you but he will use you to make his program work it's all about Lucifer he has no love he has no care it's all about the devil all right because remember even in the book of Revelation he raised up all these nations and everybody's looking at this man say is this the man now you don't use me in devil and a I'm going I'm lost hallelujah now I realize that God's Word is true right you know the scripture said if the blind lead the blind they both should fall in a ditch I'm bringing this because we realized that every deed where this lying cheating stealing it's based upon selfishness hello it's a selfish thing and you never think about nothing else at that point in time but yourself you're not in concern or considering him in the harm and the danger and everything else and then it brings a punch someone else you're just trying to protect yourself hallelujah is that right that's what Jesus said if a man tries to save his life he shall lose it it's only when we're willing to lose our life we can gain it back is that Alright well you saw it what about Ananias afar who supposedly was at one of the greatest if not the greatest because that's when it all started Pentecost to revive or when people raised from the dead rise in divine or anything else and then they stand before the Apostles and said you know we show this thing for this is such-and-such money and so we given you such and such money and God says why did you lie to the Holy Spirit she it was selfishness and then Peter said was it not yours you could have sold it for whatever prize you could have kept the whole thing you didn't even have to tell me you know you sold it and you didn't have to give me anything why would you and your wife said about and conspired to lie see what it was selfishness and it was silly forgive me it didn't make any sense had a nicer fire doesn't make sense to me because they meant they didn't have to do anything but you see they wanted to be in the light of men as doing a good deed right oh they gave so much money you know but in the eyes of God they lied because they said they sold it for that's $100 but they took 21:24 get him 87 no this is how we this is how much money we got forward they wanted the appearance of giving all when they did not give it off you understand me so we look at this thing as your what do you mean brother it's your will that's in your way and that's how come you and I must die to our will well whose will are we going to live by the Word of God the Word of God is the will of God and we must never allow ourselves a men to override the will of the word whenever we allow ourselves to override the will of the word it becomes sinful right because we want we understand listen what John 8 and we didn't understand harm how could I said I was talking about origin and we understand Amen that Lucifer was at the beginning he was up in heaven right he was wherever God was but then he was cast out of heaven all him and his angels that followed him right they were cast out so now they're in a place that is beneath right so Jesus explains to us and he said ye are and he talking to the Pharisees and Sadducees in John 8 23 24 he said unto them ye are from beneath I am from above ye are of this world I am not of this world I said therefore to you that ye should die in your sins but if you believe not excuse me that I am he you should die in your sins and I was thinking about that and I thought isn't that right no wonder the prophet of God said God will stand with us now because we stood with him being everybody did not believe but Lucifer put out everybody did not see it the way Lucifer saw it there were many angels that believed that God was God and His will was the perfect thing to do hallelujah and because he men they believed that his will was the perfect thing to do they did not fall huh have a choice just like you and I have a choice right but they knew that this was correct the Word of God whatever Elohim say do it right listen Jesus goes on and it talks about our kingdom our kingdom you must understand that this is why we are here today and that is to do the will of God for today right not build an ark right you know you know what we're here to do the will of God for today no matter what we must go through we must do his will right jesus answered in john 18 he said My Kingdom is not of this world if if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence he said now it is not from hints and so therefore I must be delivered unto the Jews otherwise my kind would defend me Pilate therefore said unto Him art thou a king then and jesus answered now say it that I am a king to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth every one that is of the truth heareth my voice hallelujah so now Jesus is trying to explain and he's trying to tell these people there is a truth and there is a lie right the the lie came from that one that is be me the truth comes from the one that is from above and we realized by God's grace Amen you sure what do you mean because Jesus even explained my words are true Oh as I think about Jesus enough I don't want to get ahead of myself because I really want you to catch it just meditate on this I can't explain it but I'm trying by Scripture what this means to me because I realize when we say I surrender all we're literally saying I surrender all my will I'm surrending all my will if I find that my will is contrary to the word I surrender hmm that's what I want I want I want to surrender all my being to to the will of God for this day right listen the Bible according to Philippians 2:4 thrace's look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others what is the scripture telling us that we are so we are not to live for ourselves we are to live for others and I thought about that us and how many Christians are really living for other people we're so concerned about our selves and what it what's going to make us right or comfortable or whatever the case may be and that's not what God wants I'll go to that in just a minute let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God this is what I look at looking at but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man God God humbled himself to his own will he was a god man he really could have turned the stone into bread huh he could have done a lot of things amen but his will God's will for him was not to perform for others he came to do one thing and that was to prove that he was from the truth and to prove to mankind this is what you should be but because of Satan's lie you have passed your theophany and now you are in the situation you're in now because of a lie a lie that was believed by Eve hallelujah you understand me the reason why we are who we are right now is because somebody told a lie and was not willing to obey God Lucifer himself because he believed the lie could not affect mankind until he made mankind believe the lie what was the lie surely you will not die you break one word you're not going to die oh that scene ain't so bad huh and that's the way the devil makes us reason when God says is bad the day you should sin the day you will die did they die absolutely they die is that Alright but it was God's will amen to show what a man's purpose for for him in this world and that was they know you be a God I made you that I made Adam a god of this earth amen but God being that he was a god he was to be my servant huh yes and Adam was perfect until he allowed the light to take him and when I say this he loved his wife so much so he purposely did what he did plunged us all into what we call a life of lies everything you see around you is a lie Satan takes education and he blows it up why why he pushes that that reasoning in a new to process this and process that and come up with your own conclusion about certain matters and that's death leave Matt to your own understanding is that right that's what I did she leads her own understanding and when she did the by say listen we all take knowledge to the Lord in all our ways yay you may not even know how to read all right but if you acknowledge God he will direct your path huh that's the only way we are supposed to live it's not by education in science is by the will of God who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient to death even the death of the cross we look at the sting as well what are you saying you and I have no idea the battle that Jesus had in the Garden of Gethsemane the Bible said it was so intense the sweat of his brow was like blood drops of blood hallelujah he was really doing what moving himself out of the way because I'm gonna tell you something God left him with his own wheel God will give you the Holy Ghost but God will give let you still have your own will mmm and what happened he understood his purpose for coming and he wanted to do the purpose listen even Jesus declared I can do nothing except I see my father doing it I'm not gonna get out of that man listen he went to the the Pool of Bethesda hallelujah and we don't know how many people were there sick and the Prophet God said the man with the bed he wasn't he wasn't the sickest of all of them but God told him this is the one what was that a test this is the one I want you to pray for he prayed for the man take up your bed walk hallelujah he didn't look like a great Messiah then when hundreds of people no doubt was sick there and only one man got healed that day hallelujah what about Lazarus when last when he found that lad was sick and he was a prophet of God Jesus Christ deep prophet amen hearing about Lazarus dying all these things and you know here he was he couldn't move he couldn't move and you you don't think as a man his heart went out philosophers Oh did but he knew though the power healing was in him he could not move until he seen it till he heard it right you know we wouldn't have understood that until God sent us a prophet and we saw how he moved out of the will of God is that right remember when he healed that baby or he God told him where the house was and you know what the wife was wearing but the man's wife was wearing with the look Baal would be wearing everything else and he got ahead of God he got ahead of the vision and then when he prayed for that baby amen being ahead of the vision the baby got sicker and looked like he was going to die the probably God had to ask God to forgive him from moving so fast you see no man gets the glory hmm so that's why I believe that the third pole is God alone nobody will get the glory right you know how we do all brother so-and-so pray for me and when you do that as a prophet of God said most people look at the brother instead of God hallelujah lean not to your own understanding that's what he's gotten I listen to you today and we find out amen but this thing that God is doing now no man will be able to get the credit because it'll be God alone Satan won't imitate this one hallelujah but when a man is involved Satan can duplicate it he can make it look right hallelujah oh my when God began to work and he is working why because I thought to myself Lord how simple how simple this is seeing that the will of man is the thing that's really hindering the bride of Jesus Christ God say get down on your knees and pray and your will say I don't feel like it hallelujah or your will might say you know I'm so tired I sleep I pray I'll sleep a little bit now wake up and pray mmm you said brother ones how you know that I've said it I've done it hallelujah amen I'm a man and I've seen my will when God began to deal with this I'm like oh my god how many times have my own wheel got in God's Way hallelujah think about it God will always test you in your will because he told Nathan go tell Dave now Nathan has already told David David you want to build this temple do what so ever that's in your heart God comes back to Nathan said nah uh-uh David has too much blood on his hand now you go back and tell David that no he won't be the one to build the temple it'll be his son Solomon now you know the scripture tells us that they said now for promised prophet prophesied something and is wrong you don't have to believe him and you know the devil was fighting Nathan but guess what he humbled himself went back to Nathan and begged back to David and told David listen I was wrong I prophesied I said David whatsoever I don't hard do it and God says not so mmm that's a real man of God when you can submit to the will of God no matter like brother Brown said even though if you feel like you're skinning yourself do what's right what about John when God told John you go tell Herod over there you don't got your brother's wife and that's not your own y'all knew he was gonna be killed how many of us would have done that but you see when you see you have to do with the shepherds they do what about Jeremiah who preached all those years to do Israel and no one is really one gonna repair look at his Iike what he had to do and disease that I looked in the wall and what did I see you know you you understand me what I'm trying to say is that God would test your will huh he told Peter listen Peter said Lord if that be you you said that's me made me come he said come he tested his will don't ask God for something if you're not willing to go all the way with him right always allowing your will to the Word of God and you will always come out right proverbs 3:5 through asia's trust in the Lord with all thine heart lean not unto thine own understanding in all that ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths you know how this message came I was talking to a brother I said brother I am trying my best to serve people to get out of the way so that I can live for them not not realizing what I see I had just that's it and then thoughts start coming he's all my good you don't know what you just see huh trust in the Lord right be not wise in their own eyes fear the Lord and depart from evil see what it is Lucifer was wise in his own eyes oh I believe that he could turn back the hands of time and change the things he would probably try to do it but you know what he can't he was literally made and God knew he would do it and he had all was appointed to be the adversary of the Living God it really blesses me I don't know what I'm getting it over to you all I know is that your will in my will must die Matthew 6:9 through ten said after this manner therefore pray ye because they wanted to know how to pray why didn't Jesus say well I tell you what the story you pray Lord blessed me with a million dollars he never said nothing about these things because he realized that God is gonna automatically give you the things that you need in this world is that right considered a lily he said consider the sparrow he said those are the things that the father do you know and we find out amen that he gets this and he says after this manner therefore pray ye our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name see that's positionally placing God thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven huh Lord I want to do what you want me to do in earth as I would do in heaven what were you do in heaven if God says say jump fifty times you jump into time before you know it Wow there ain't nobody in heaven no angel disobeying God God give God got rid of all the troublemakers and now he's given us the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is the thing that caused I don't know how can I said Jesus Christ the God in him may him completely obedient how can God fail his own word he came he lived it and that's the thing Adam would not Adam willfully sin there was no temptation he willfully sin and when you got the Holy Ghost it is to kill your desire that God's will will be done throughout your life that's what we got it for we didn't get it to jump shout and do all these things we came to live the word to make the world see that God is still God and then a people a man who's still living the word hallelujah we'd rather die hallelujah then the break the word that's the way it should be we have to die to our what's up will I think about Peter Peter was self-willed before he got the Holy Ghost he was ready to cut that man's head off hallelujah good thing he ducked and Peter got the ear right but look at the will of God the will of God says no Peter puts it back on look like that man with the file downs the old Lord thou art God he didn't he didn't I often think is that the same soldiers said that they said it at the foot of Jesus this is truly the son of God if that be him I don't know he may have been the same one that God put the ear back on and then he saw Jesus and heard him say Father forgive them for they know not what they do y'all understand me this whole world is alive and God who is Jesus Christ can he's the only one that could bring us to truth and the bow ended and we realized what is truth thy Word is truth his word is truth the truth about us is that we're fallin sons of God we were not created for this we were created for the world to come you say well brother books what are you saying I'm being recreated you're being recreated into the image and likeness of God hallelujah to me amen this what we're now experiencing it's the greatest creation of all you saw what do you mean the Bible said the first Adam he produced his own image that image brought about a death hallelujah but the Bible said the second Adam who's Jesus Christ and then he comes around and he's a quickening spirit and guess what he produces himself that's why God stepped out of the church ages hallelujah this is a new creation hallelujah this is Jesus Christ creating him if you want to put it that way the Bible said God Jesus Christ the beginning of creation huh we God men he saw what do you mean this creation is greater than the first Adams creation because this creation will will bypass death who eternal life brother branham saying is living for others you said well what do you mean think about it ruth types us out Naomi and Ruth and Ruth says unto Naomi your people is my people your God is my God where you die I'll die where you're buried I'm buried I want to die yourself she was willing to die to all of her more bite his teachings her family was dead to her her culture was dead to her her City was dead to her she died to everything to follow Naomi and this is what we must understand we must die to all our Crees died to all our fears died to everything that will hinder you from following Jesus Christ everything amen it's just your will you got to say lord help me here I need to die to this I need to die to that I need to die and as you as you die to yourself then what happens they meant didn't you see a real rotting come in then what you mean then after a while there will be no desire to do those things anymore help me Lord but the Rebbe said he died to reveal himself to us now let us die to self to reveal him to others now you can't have your own wheel cairn on a man and call yourself a Christian people see that ugly side of yourself if that's the Christian I'd only have nothing to do with not having a Christian that's just your wheel they don't understand the battle that we have but one thing for sure God will test your will so how was Peter change Peter was changed right because we realize we saw Peter when Jesus was being betrayed Peter and the restaurant ran and Peter did not in three times why he did not want to die but we find out when Jesus come back to Peter and said Noah Peter you got to go back Peter immediately went back why because he didn't want his will to be seen he only wanted the will of God Lord if it's my time to die I'm going to die in that powerful that's powerful it's all will it's all what you will to be right and I earnest desire is to be like Jesus so we're going to be tested people we've got to be tested and listen I want you to think from now on after tonight I want you to think when something is required of you to do or to say Lord move my will I don't care you got to say it to a brother say it if you gotta say it to a sister say it whatever you need to do to fulfill the will of God do it well I will get my feelings hurt who cares about your feelings he that's selfishness that's not God selfishness because the Word of God must come first not your will selfishness we're all guilty hello I know this ain't okay I got to everybody else it's the truth I know you said it inside but it's okay none of us like I said the pot cake called a killer black cuz we are in the same condition we need the mercy and grace of God now the first thing in this message he goes now the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life huh when your life is spent for others when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when it come in the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others someone said how can you stand letting some anybody call you such bad names you don't live for yourself you you you live for others that you might redeem that man you become sons and the trouble of it is the church has been forgot they were sons you're a son you're taking Christ's place you're a son so don't live for yourself live for others oh my he said well brother branham I can live for this brother because he sure is a nice man that's not it live for that man who hates you live for that person who would kill you if they could that's what they don't that's what they done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them that's eternal life when you that's in your bosom your faith in heaven then but you sacrifice your own things give them up like the Sheep gives up wool you look off to water Calvary I hope this helps you to get in place that's what the tabernacle that's what all people has to God got to do is find out what you are and what's the purpose see Church isn't going to church just to play music sing songs church is a place where correction judgment begins at the house of God we must reckon ourselves dead and alive to Christ then he made the way that we could sacrifice ourselves to his service to follow him if we follow him we lead the life that he lived that's wonderful jesus said and spoke of it let me just give you a few quotes quotations on it listen close don't miss it Jesus said at that day he would separate the people like the sheep and the goats he would say to the ghost stand on the on the left side and to the Sheep stand on the right side and he said to the goats depart from me because I was hungry you didn't feed me I was in prison you did not visit me I was naked and you clothed me not I was thirsty and you gave me no drink I was sick and you didn't visit me so depart from me see what I'm saying see what your will would get you your will gets you in trouble with God when you don't listen to him then what happened why just like I said one time up a long time ago I think it was I had like $50 of whatever God said give that man $50 I said that's all I have and he responded that's all I asked you to give God tells you to give something you're not gonna get something in return you ought to know the voice of God by now now you're not giving it to get nothing in return but understand brother Brennan said God will not old any man anything if God tell you to do it don't worry about it he gonna come back you'd be surprised I've seen him do it many times and on the ship he said I was hungry you fed me I was naked and you gave me clothing I was sick and you missed you ministered to me and notice don't fail to get this church keep this in your heart forever it was so unconsciously done the people don't do it for line-of-duty a man that gives you something another because he ought to do it a man that feeds you because he ought to do it he's got a selfish idea it should be your very life your very action it was so surprising to these sheep that they said Lord when you when were you're hungry and we wouldn't feed we feed you and when were you hungry and we fed you when were you naked and we gave give you clothes when were you thirst and we give you drink when were you sick and we gave we minister you he said it was so automatic out of love just your life lived in them God let the people see what Calvary did for us so automatically when you win were you Lord we never knew that she'd look what Jesus turn is saying in so much as you've done it unto the least you did it unto me she unselfish life not the second thought not to think about it but you are so dead to the things of this world and so live in Christ and so walking on the highway that these things are just an automatic thing you just do it not saying well now the Lord would Lord want me to do that it's not that you just put just part of him his life is in you and you act the way he acted do you get it see it's the way he acted he never even thought about his reputation we went down the Simon house and a woman a man was there even coming here Fame woman came he goes oh my god I can't let her touch me they know they looking at me I'm trying to win nice old but you see he knew that was the will of God he said still and let that woman do what she needed to do regardless to what the others thought all right it was automatic that message is dead that day on Calvary she that's what I just read from listen but the Bible said according to John 1:12 2:13 but as many as received him to them gave he the power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name so what is it to become the sons of God to become a son of God is to become a man or woman that is now transformed from selfishness from cell to Jesus Christ servant unselfishness is where we come from selfishness to unselfishness right even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of God or of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God born of God that means in you must become God you borning him your son of God you act like him you walk like if you talk like him most of all obedient like you hope you being blessed see the first act of sin was by the will of man that write Genesis 3 a says and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in their art garden in the cool of the evening of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden and the Lord God called him to Adam and said unto Him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked has thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou should not eat and he and the man said the woman he never answered the question correctly the woman whom thou gave it to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat let me go back where of I command is he and he said who told you that I was naked has doubt oh you say yes but one lie leads to another right it was his will that woman didn't make him do what he did his will he could have told her no I'm not going to do it but you see his will right and the woman dog gave me she gave me to eat and I did eat so he he roundabout confess it and the law said that the woman what is this a dog has done it and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat what she was honest he tricked her but she listened right and so therefore he walked with her intelligence because she is and so is the man and he work with that intelligence so much so that they thought that God didn't mean what he said and that's how a lot of Christians will end up in hell because their hear this message and they say to themselves but I've been a Christian all my life and I mean I could go back in the scriptures and the Jews could have said the same I've been at you all my life ever since Abraham coming in Moses gonna tell me I gotta kill the lamb and put it on a blood on the doorpost and little I have been on you I've been doing all those sacrifices before the Lord and everything else a million why do I have to put blood on the doorpost of the little but if you had did not put blood on the doorpost a little guess what your firstborn died Jesus came back and said the same thing to the Pharisees except you believe that I am he you should likewise die in your sin mmm that's the truth but he he was born this in Galatians 4:23 says but he who was a of the bonds woman was born after the flesh but he said another free woman was born by promise right see that's the only way we are born again it's not about your wheel it's not by the will of you all I want to be saved only God can give you that desire to be saved the Bible said Jesus said no man can come unto me except my father draws him right so you got to understand that predestination and promise goes together a little bit brother amen uh you know I love that because when you predestinated to a promise there is no way you can get outside of the promise God promised it you said what do you mean brother Brooks the Bible said Jacob I love and II so I hate huh was there anything that was going to change that and God said no it'll be the younger son amen that will actually be the one that I'm going to bless did it happen absolutely it meant God promised that Jacob was going to get the birthright did it happen absolutely it was a promise before the boys were even born he had already promised the one who was going he was going to bless hallelujah I don't care how what kind of family you came out of I hope y'all know what kind I came out of you but your mouth would be you know a man but nevertheless amen we know that in all that love and Mauri that I was born under God saw a seed hallelujah and that sea was promised a man to come to life in this day that you with me that's you and I in you I you now must understand predestinated and promise is by the will of God oh my god even with my mom and dad had me and they birthed me that was the will of God hallelujah see coming all the way up here amen in doing what God when we knew is the will of God there's no way in my thoughts I could've ever thought about Iowa hallelujah uh-huh I always got Iowa and Idaho mixed up I thought this is the land of potatoes huh but God knew what he was doing I can't make nothing happen but he can but now I realized that my will has hindered a lot of things I'm blaming nobody but me hmm hallelujah Philippians 1:21 of mine give me a few more minutes according to my earnest expectation in my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it is - whether it be by life or death oh my god for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain oh that's Paul's attitude you know Paul how many times they thought he was dead three times Paul got right back up and kept working in the work field uh-huh Oh stoned to death commotion oh my god you talking about a real warrior amen and he didn't care he was determined to do the will of God hallelujah and then when Paul could have got out of his situation Amen when they were gonna take in the wrong Paul says uh-uh the Holy Spirit has shown me I gotta go preach to this man and you're not going to deter me no sure they look Paula like a insane man and they took Paul to Rome it as a oh death where is your sting see he was so confident in me that he was in the will of God he had no space and no place to fear death hallelujah first Peter for once and for say for as much being as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh arm yourself likewise with the same mind for he that have suffered in the flesh have ceased from sin that he no longer would should live the rest of his time in the flesh of the lust of men but to the will of God hallelujah ye would him say Paul says he Peter said listen this is the key your wheel vs. God's will and you will to the realtor to live amen for God and not for yourself hallelujah is that right look at the rich young ruler the original ruler was called to preach call to follow Jesus but he was selfish because God said go sell all that you have and follow me hallelujah and God didn't require you do no more than what he asked his other disciples to do they left everything because people said Lord we've left everything we've never family what shall we get huh so God is requiring the same we gotta leave everything to follow Jesus right and look at the risk of roulette beginner today he got what he wanted he got more than he ever had his old ma let me kick my legs up I'm gonna retire this year I got bonds and everything else filled up and everything else I'd be looking pretty good stock market is looking good everything is looking good and God came to you food yo so is required of you today see so all of this you know you fall in your own wielder team all this thing someone said what will again what it was a prophet of man I think I saw him if you gain the whole world and lose your soul what will it profit a man well it's probably you and me why because you gain it and that's what that's what the devil thought if I disobey if I go my own way I'm going to gain I'm gonna sin I going to do this I'm going to do that see what your will would take you your will will always take you out of the will of God it's alright to suffer you think because you do the will of God you're not gonna stop you who suffer especially in your mind cuz your devil gonna say well you know you want to do I'm not following your will your will is the problem today and you're not going to will your will on me I'm following Christ that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to what the love of me loves of the flesh let's see i proud of life all of that came from the devil but to do will of God for the time pass of our lives may suffer for the time passed of our life may suffice us to have brought the will of the Gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness lost excess of wine reveling and banqueting and abominable idolatries wherein they think it's strange that you run not with them through the same excess of riot speaking either of you that's what people saw ain't none to him he lived such a boring life he's a Christian all he does is go to church turn shirt Church you know em I got my days though neighbor sailor to me one day you going back to church again yes and you're watching me you watching me do the will of God yes I'm going to church again and I said why don't you come go with me haven't heard another peep hallelujah you see people are watching they always watch hallelujah beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial Willis to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice in so much as ye are partakers of Christ's suffering but then when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy if he be reproached for the name of Christ happy are ye for the spirit of Laurie and and if God rested upon you on their part he is he was spoken up but on your party is glorified but let none of us of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evildoer or as a busybody in other men's matters yet if any man suffer as a Christian that him not be ashamed but let him glorify God on this behalf for the time has come that the judgment of must begin at the house of God and if it first began at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God what is the gospel of God it is the Word of God and if the righteous scarcely be saying where shall we share the ungodly and the sinner up here is this okay we must die to our will folks and he and I Paul says listen I die daily you got the Holy Ghost I believe but it's dying to your will on a daily basis and how do you do that you go to the man who can change it you go to the one who could kill it and this is what I say if God led Jesus the Calvary and slaughtered him there God can scroll to you every day amen you love the Lord one more spirit I believe I got a few more things I want to say and it won't take too much longer but I want to read it and then I try to hurry through it Matthew 26 36 446 then come of Jesus with him into a place called Gethsemane and Senators disciples sit ye here while I go and pray yonder and he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy then said he unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry here and watch with me and he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying O far o my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as doubt will he see god never took his will from him he could have said no I don't I don't want to go I'm not gonna do this but he submitted to the will of God because that was his purpose we must submit to our his will in our day and the only way you could none as noise well you got to study his word and understand what God is doing in this hour there's no other way how you gonna know what God want you to do if you don't read it study his word is that okay listen and he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying O my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as thou wilt let me come and he cometh unto his disciples and finding them asleep and said unto Peter what could you not watch with me one hour and that's what's happening to the people now at a time that we ought to be praying with sleeping alright what is that you will fight it fight it he went away again the second time and prayed saying O my father if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it thy will be done except I drink it thy will be done and he keeps saying this because he understands this Cup is built it's gonna be rough right and you now must understand by God's grace this is not the easiest age my favorite Brown said this is the worst age ever don't you know that God Satan is really the god of this evil age it is called an evil age because the now Satan is gone getting ready to be crowned look at our politicians you can't tell me those guys are got the Holy Ghost or anything nothing close to it I don't care how religious they had you know King was religious and a lot of the things that they're doing they don't even know that God is making them do it God said even the leaders of the world God would put a spirit of surrender when they were surrendered to the Pope willfully I think big broadcasts ongoing now talk about you know the Pope being the greatest man and I think the Catholic Church got 1.8 billion a million people I don't know what it is being in the weather I don't know what it is but my point is is that not the scripture the Bible said he would cause all whose names are not written on the land book of life to worship Him there is no greater Church in today's world the Catholic Church let's be real is the greatest and the biggest church in today's world put all the Protestants together they still came out number the calories hmm these are all brother birthday no Kelly yes I used to date a girl who was Catholic and when I told her mama that Peter was not too rough you know she did she went in her kitchen with a not got her knife ran me chased me out of the house who real Catholic mm-hmm yeah did I get out I got out I know how to see in the first hand and it wasn't even is message yet mm-hmm oh lord have mercy see people have no idea was locked up right now because of the law they don't know it never repented that's the mystery of her because it's the same old Roman spirits raised up in a church they people they ignore the history and think that that sleeping giant is no longer and she's so peaceful in that look at it the Bible says she's gonna win the kingdoms by flattery oh you're my brother why don't you come back home how long follow he's the most the man god help us I'm just saying it only because God has given me eyes to see and this so-called girl I did not marry because I was against that way back when before I knew this message I saw that I studied those things and I didn't know the fullness of it like I know now but I see and I see even clearer now what that's all about she controls everything you see these old great countries like they big and bad let the Pope go over there and they settle down you said how do they settle down you gotta understand he has the most powerful spirit of darkness in him he said it can't be so sweet and nice but so was the serpent to Eve he was sweet and nice and he calls death y'all see I hope they'll be up there looking down not here here but anyway let me move on he goes on and he says listen he watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation this indeed is a The Fearless indeed willing but the flesh is weak now he tells us that the flesh is weak you can't think that your flesh is going to stand under pressure it will not without the Holy Ghost your fret your flesh is not going to stand hallelujah is that not what God tells the devil tells you all God said God let me try let me try job let me try them I know that every man loved his flesh hmm let me just touch it and I'll tell you what I get him to turn from you hmm and that is nothing but the truth if you're not a to seat of God your flesh is going to be touched is that right oh yeah brother Bela said doing that trial in the tribulation a period he said there will be humans people walking and walking around alive with flesh-eating diseases huh the Bible said death will flee from them what putting on the only movies about zombies oh it's real we've not seen that but it's real and what's happening now is those Hollywood movie stars are tapping into that RAM and basically showing us how wicked is going to be who want to live and stay here amen who want to write oh my god no take me long you may have we said that when brother BAM said that hell is blending into this dimension it's nothing but the truth these little toys and things that these kids are playing with one time which scared me half to death hallelujah I remember that if a baby I had not seen brothers Barney and saw bugs bunny hopping around it was scaring them now they got all kinds of creatures out there and these kids they won't know why because the seed of God is becoming spares scarce who's ruling this world this is Satan's Eden and you must understand there more serpents now than ever before when God said he's going to destroy this earth and only a few make a rapture that means we back in the days of Noah and all eight souls were saved all the rest of them were surplus hallelujah two million perhaps came out of Egypt and to me all of them were serpents except to Joshua and Caleb I'm telling you problem people hear the word they cannot hear but we still have to do his will we still gotta preach it as if they would receive but we know the Word of God like Jeremiah knew it they ain't gonna hear you you're gonna preach all that time and ain't gonna hear because they've gone beyond mercy and grace anyway let's move on I read where life is living for others and I'm just gonna go ahead and move on that's got one more quote and I'm gonna read that he says listen now the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived himself himself he's his life spent four others that's perfectly I think I had that quote already eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life eternal life is living for others it proves if when you come to the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others see and that's the whole key to eternal life but it's not something you can do well this is what I ought to do it's not a duty I got to do this I gotta do that it's not a duty it's so automatically done and that's what I'm praying for Lord let it be automatically done don't let me think about what I gotta do just let me do it and you said what do you mean a situation arose in my house the other night and my wife was already in her she said I don't know but I saw something that clicked and it helped me understand that you know sometimes when things are asked of you to do it may sound really stupid and ridiculous it makes make the person there's asking you a question like why would you ask me to do it but you never know that's just a test well what what is it that you wouldn't do for a brother and a sister how are we supposed to do all those things that we're comfortable with that's okay no sacrifice comes in there hello remember the parable about the man he's not knock knock his friend knock knock knocking knocking knocking open up I need some things from you and the man finally got up because it was a friend and the Bible said this man didn't feel God he just did it because it was friend this man was knocking and he needed something and he gave it to him right he said but what about God how many how much God willfully give us he doesn't say any more if you do this I'll do that this unmerited love this is grace I'm gonna do for you even if you don't do for me and that's the way we are to be when God said do this we do it don't think about it people just do it you find out it'll work out better right oh I've done things a man just so sporadically I mean just automatically if I say it like that and then after I do it the devil say you so why did you do this and why did you do that when you know you're gonna need this what I'm not tomorrow is not promised to me ten days down the road is not promised to me I might die before then let me take every day we'd stayed by you know day at a time huh oh it's the truth because I tell you what you'd be so concerned about thirty days down the road and you may not live 30 days just do and serve God day by day is not God a supplier well I got situation now financially and I don't say this ain't asking and all I'd say just pray for me but I'm not worried you know why because I know God is gonna fix it he's done it every year y'all know what I'm talking about now thanks ty my mom you know never had their times before I was worried Oh God we're and just say how you're not worried but I can't sleep right but now when you know that you've done the will of God you rest all you can do is ask God and believe God is gonna supply it and he'll do it I've seen him do it too many times is that right I've seen him do it and you know I look at things in us as you know what I said even even uh this thing that God showed me about his will I came to explain it I'm trying to tell you now just trust that your militate and ask God what is brother Brooks saying if you don't fully understand because it's such a powerful revelation it should change your heart it did mine you know and it's like okay no I'm not too tired to do this this brothers in need the sisters in need why did God have them call me you understand me it's like okay I'm a part of the body and I can't function because I don't feel like it you know I mean it's just like okay now Lord what is this it just it just be of service be of service when God calling you move at his request one of the things that I'm up close on this and I will always remember or the colony when one of the sweetie kids got sick you know he didn't raise his hand say brother Brooks can I do this or you just oughta bet I saw a man and just at the elder just move you know never thinking about himself being sick or getting sick I don't know what but whatever that was in him that drove him a man to clean up it was driving everybody else to get out [Laughter] it was I'll never forget it I saw God in action that's all I'm saying simple as it was I saw God and I think that's the way God wants us to respond when we are finding our brothers and our sisters in need don't question don't ask just it just do that's the Holy Spirit lead you to do it just do you love the Lord I I don't know where I got it over I just pray that God gave me this and I think to me is one of the greatest messages I've ever came across yet is so simple but it's God's will his will is the reason why we say today because he connected his will with God's me if that makes sense those gospel you look at brother Branham all of the licks he had get through this ministry he tells us about it on the snow white dove he said yes the dove is wounded but the message got home Oh every time I hear that it makes me want to cry because he had to go through so much and you think that this man didn't have his own will he proved it to us many times but one thing I know about him he was he was so willing to to make things right when he made things wrong and just to say how he allowed us to see that God's will come first in spite of friends because you know how his friend preaches they convinced him to go preach in India or Africa when he should have been India forgot which way it went and he caught of me but almost died the age of the Lord told him Billy Paul said the angel the Lord told you daddy you better do what they the Lord say do he did just the opposite and he almost died he paid for it even though God blessed see God may still bless you but his purpose is to teach us how to obey his regardless to the circumstances or anything that may come upon us what's going to happen is if the law tarrying we're right under the squeeze and and they says you deny this message oh I'm gonna shoot you I'm gonna blow your brains out what you gonna do throw my brains out I can't die anyhow I know who I am I know who I am you must know who you are that's the only because if you know who you are then you can press toward that mark you can push forward amen and ask God cuz see when you came to it you gotta ask him he's the only one to do it no man can add a cubit to his stature lastania but you know God can do it and I am depending on the Lord and I can't eat I just I just know that something took place in my life the other day and I'm like all the Lord I've seen this thing I've read about this thing and I'm now just seeing what it was all about God's will versus man's before it was God's will versus Lucifer now it's God's bill man's glue Lord I'm praying that somehow the word has gotten crossed to the people that making ponder it Lord father you know that the message didn't come to rebuke us but it did come to correct us and to help us we all fall short lord I do I can remember many times like Lord the phone is ringing God I don't want to answer this and yet a whole bag they hang up and I called back because I want to do your will Lord the Lord should never be that it should be automatic father where my thoughts and my desire is to help and to to serve yo people as you would serve and serve your people and help them father I just know that you said that when we serve each other we are serving you and I know father many times we come short the father please help us give us grace to die daily to our will when we don't want to pray or don't want to read your word and whatever the case may be you know sometimes we just get in our selfish ways and we don't want that anymore lord I want to be completely surrendered to you lord I want to surrender all I have regardless of my thoughts and the way Satan moved me I I'm tired of it father I know I am true son of God I'm Yours Lord but I've allowed my will to hinder my progress in my growth Lord I am to blame for my condition that I stand in now but you showed it to me Lord you showed me what I need and what I need to do your father I pray that your mercy be with me give me grace I know you didn't show it to me in vain but your purpose is to help me and to build me into a perfect statute help us now as I believe Lord if we could catch the revelation of this what was preached tonight and others what it is the Lord we will grow in a great way as a church be merciful to us now let your perfect will be done in our lives in Jesus Christ's name we pray [Music] [Music] - Dima oh I surrender I surrender I surrender - Dima oh let's say it one more time before this missing ah ooh - Dima listen to me did you have a song in your heart
