right the bubble says zechariah chapter 4 verse 1-7 and the angel that talked with me came again and worked me as a man that is breaking out of his sleep lord [Music] and behold the candlestick of gold with a bow up on the top of it if i see two dolls on vines and his seven lamps there on set slump and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof sets lump avex set conduit and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the ball and the other up on the left side of the office so i answered and speak to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord i took with me answered and said unto me no worse doubt not what this beat and i said no my lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto jeroboam saying not by my nor by power but my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art thou o great mountain before zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with in other words that when the headstone is coming it's coming with the message of grace grace amen let's go to um second corinthians chapter 12. we'll read the first portion of verse 9. second corinthians chapter 12 verse 9 the first portion it's uh verse nine the bible says enough bibliography and he said unto me almighty my grace is sufficient for thee but my strength is made perfect don't laugh at it don't have fabulous amen amen my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect amen can be seated amen this morning i will try to bring by god's grace a message preached this message once and i will see you soon from where foreign grace started in the bible you know the but the god when god came to abraham contributing he made to a covenant of grace you know in other words that covenant that god made with abraham had no conditions unconditionally because remember if you go back to the garden of eden you know when god was giving you know conditions where god was giving you know promises to adam and eve especially those promises had conditions see promise you know you remember god told him that you will not eat you know from this tree if i pray i don't have the power to sit down and the day you will eat from this straight that's the day that you will die that this covenant with me and abraham you know it doesn't depends on your failures you know it doesn't depends on your strength send the pope to the false or it doesn't depend on your work santi you know it's a grace that i swear by myself citrine glass because you know that i have already done it amen and and adam and eve yeah i don't want to add you know we'll see that from the bible that they didn't keep the promise god you know god gave his grace for them that you know in other words that the grace of god was projected god told them that the very same day that you will eat from this tree that's the day that you will die you know it happened that one day that day came and eve you know ate from the tree i have happy mother's day and she instead of keeping his promise even though the blessings of god were not fully given to them because they sin you know but nevertheless god didn't care of them made you in your life you know god gave them grace you know god showed them their his mercy and then you know after abraham you know years went by some pastors you know you have the the birth of isaac you know jacob and all the the 12 tribes and then around one time you know moses came emojis you know and then when moses came if you read in exodus chapter 19. you will see that that was the day where the chin of israel rejected the grace of god amen they rejected god's grace you know they because it was by god's grace that those people came out of he came out of egypt israel he was by god's grace that the mind was provided to them amen it was by god's grace that they were fair he was by the grace of god that they had you know the head healing of their bodies you know it was by the grace of god that they could walk and not wash their clothes like like glass to jerk you prove him outside you know like what about god's grace that they could walk and not fear and not be tired but arriving at exodus 19. those people say you know they wanted to be as other as other people you know they wanted to be as the philistines and other other other other people if you really calmly you know they wanted to have the law instead of grace the request of the law and you remember that moses went to the mountain for 40 years if you read from exodus 19 to exodus 30 i'm pretty sure 32 you will see it civilization it meant moses you know but went to the mountains and four for 40 years and if you see the number 40. number 40 means judgment you know because or temptation oh savage you know he told them that 40 in 40 days and 40 days that god will overthrow the the the the see uh you know in numbers 14 33 34 amen god cursed the children of israel telling them that you will wander in the desert for 40 years 40 days and then after that no i had to wait for 40 days in the inside before before going out hey you know what i know i don't count you i want to shorten you know that amen because god the the number of god or the mathematics of god doesn't lie pastorally mathematic amen those people requested those people requested law said what and when moses went up in the mountains those people when they stayed they created to themselves an image of god and they started to worship that image and when moses came and the bible said that 3 thousand people were dead in person amen that was lo but if you come back to the new testament you will see that in chapter two why don't act amen jesus spent with the disciple for 40 days with the disciples and then he promised them to wait until you know until that spirit from that power from one heart will come back amen and the bible says that they waited for another 10 10 more days which makes it 50 keep faith the totality 50 amen and because that god couldn't judge them or in other words god couldn't do that 40 days alone because it will be against it will be against the world you know that's why he had to wait for that why they had to wait for another 10 days to the bible said that after the first sermon of peter 3 000 people were saved but back in exodus after god gave the table of laws to moses three thousand people were dead twenty percent but in igbo in acts but made all these believers you know when god wrote those table of of of those into the heart of congress amen that's saved for uh 3 000 people you know not included the 120 that wasn't who were in the upper room so someone said uh in other words that without law we would know that stealing was bad without the law we will not know that lying is bad you know without the law we would not know that killing your brother is bad so low became to magnify those scenes amplification came to to put in our conscience that doing that the stealing is wrong but allah could not get us from those law couldn't bring us pardons couldn't bring us forgiveness you know that's why jesus had to die you know to bring that grace to man you know to offer the grace to man the prophet says in uh in the the book of law or grace the message little grace but then when law came in mcconnell he made the man realize he can't steer he can't lie honduran realized and he can't commit adultery and all of the commandments that are just magnified a truly common monster so an amplitude but yet that law didn't take away sin luanna you know to tell that the law required a blood for for the cleansing of sin you know that's why you will see that from the garden of eden you know to the death of jesus jesus jesus you know for forgiveness of sin the word giving the blood the blood has to be shed you know they had to kill a lamb for it you know in the old testament people were giving uh sacrifices and offerings sacrifice but you would notice that those blood would do again the same scene and then go home you know the the blood of animals couldn't get that person couldn't get the desire of seeing out of the place prophet explained it second prophetic it says that the soul of a man before being saved there's a snake inside of him and the more he's reading the the more he's reading the word and praying god you know the more is being justified the priesthood person is justified you know that snake is being killed and when the snake is dead it comes to sea you know that means that you know something else can replace him you know it can be another snake or another animal that person will have to go to to receive the holy spirit you know to make sure that that snake is completely completely dead and the dove is now the dove took place but the desire of the sins will not be will not be taken away changed in other words that the sin that you commit before doctor you know you will no longer have the desire to go do the same things you have the family membership because now you will be and that you will have a new nature you will be a new person you know you will be a new man you will be a new husband for your wife no you will be a new children for your parents on the phone happen uh surpass you know you have to claim the lottery of of justification sanctification and baptism you know because then after that you will be uh um justification scientific sanctification a priya precipitation that will kill the snake that certificate yourself you know in other words that place will be empty sit down you know but you have to go to the baptism of the holy spirit to bring that down for to get inside of you poor i mean this is it's columbus and when that dove will come because it's it's cold it may not work that you will be filled with the holy spirit hopefully you sent it then you will have a change of nature you will be a new person you know you will be a new walking pistol you know we saw god amazing grace in the garden of eden you know when adam and eve sing i don't have a picture you know god had to pronounce judgment due to the apollo situation god had to judge them for it but you will see that god didn't judge themselves graceful amen because he's the god of mercy masculine amen in the old testament you know we will see that when god was in the mountains if i could contribute on a mountain you know nobody could touch the mountain person a bird if the bird landed on that mountain that bird had to beat you know had the presence of god basketball you know about god in his mercy you know who was separating who that's you know the holies of holy to the the you know the the the the holy place you know so that you know so that he can open to us you know so that we can be and you know so that we can have a personal relationship with him [Music] in other words that that god in the old testament you know who couldn't be seen kinder you know but he accepted will accept you know to dwell in the man to people you know to die on the cross you know to give us that liberty to and then so that we can have the forgiveness of ourselves amen amen the the god you know we see in the bible when it was in moses calling it you know moses after coming from the mountain people couldn't see his face died oh jesus died on the cross jesus christ so that we can have the personal relationship with him in other words that same god don't know the old testament you know now has given us the grace you know to be in contact with him contact him you know that god has given us a grace to be in contact with him contact any place and don't and then any time and then pulse can't honor any circumstances so that we can have that axis to the holies of holy don't listen the son amen amen amen the book of if we go to hebrews chapter 10 verse 20. you know that's where the bible is talking about the the rendering of the veil so now jupiter do to be in contact with him that you can go to [Music] to enter into the holiness of the holiest by the blood of jesus the the the follow the holiest the only sentence sir by the blood of jesus paul dioxa amen the new and living way a nouvelle person was open for flesh for all believers for two times for two people it meant to go to the presence of god darlene presents to you you know with no other sacrifices needed avec occur sacrifice because himself pastor remember you know he rendered the veil you have a division of one he offered himself as a sacrifice he said to fame he said to fair pokemon in any time we need him we can go to the holy senate you know go straight to him and and rest are kissed in his in his faith amen amen because in the holiness of holy pastor donald sanders son you know that was where the sacrifice had was offered amen god transfer god transfer all our sins upon him hey man as the prophet says only prophet he says that now it isn't what i can do may not say pastor because you're perfect it isn't whether i'm good or not that's isn't you stand in the merits of of jesus christ and because he died he had co-passed kill him and because he died a sinner but he lay more picture the bible said that his soul went to hell the bibliotheque because he died as a sinner basically more commonplace you know he had to go to hell he developed party on unfair that's right and while he was there he passed he preached to those who were in prison that repented the long suffering of days of nowhere quincy ponti don't don't donate jewel to knew it but it wasn't possible that he would leave his body see corruption as our faith is confessed to him and we've been born a new of the spirit that is sure as he had come from the grave we will rise also new zealand in the second coming oh what a perfect one what a perfect hope can perfect hope uh amen he transferred our sins upon him only because he died as a sinner he had to he had to go to hell in our place and being there as the prophet saying don't come to prophet he had to preach those souls that were there in in prison you know he had to preach the message of repentance to give them the chance of the ability to repent from their sins you know opportunity you know to be preached the message of grace to him so they can receive the grace of god and when it was coming up you know the prophet says that that morning the prophet that sunday morning no the morning of resurrection and the bible gave testimony that a number of people were seen in the city amen in that moment that morning of resurrection and the same thing that he did back there about him and he would do it again you know for those who died in christ you know as abraham and all the others you know all of them requested their souls or their body to be to be burned uh to be buried in jerusalem [Music] you know to be buried there where the resurrection will happen that typifies the soul of a believer lamb don't don't quiet if you're buried in christ amen where the where the resurrection will happen and that morning of resurrection even though you go before us that morning of resurrection the grace of god will be given to you gracious and you will rise up again and you'll be changed in the question amen and we will go up together and use that on montana and grace he'd have a mountie he said that sarah was was her uh uh was his sister amen that was a lie monsoon amen he should have been punished for it you know by the grace of god was projected because he repented you know it doesn't matter what sin you have coming post communication with you it doesn't matter what sin you have done perhaps come you can't picture as long as you repent the grace of god will be projected you know you see moses why maui's moses when moses when god told him to give the children of israel water jewish jesus christ being crucified for the second time and he didn't even stop by there he told them that he was the one who provided the waterfalls that was a scene that was something wrong it meant moses was supposed to be punished you know but then he went and repented and then the last day of his life appeared to him jesus gave him the keys julia donald clinton you know jesus gave him the ability to you know to open and to bound do you have a donation like liability the the the duvry and i defend me but you see the same peter with the foreign the word of god was revealed to him how old did you have a television you know peter had to deny cross three times he didn't even stop only by denying christ and when the angel gave the message to the three uh uh the three women and called you have done you know to go tell them but the bible says that god told them to god told them to go tell his disciples and then the bible mentioned and peter and peter in liberia you know that was after peter you know you know why because he took his time to repent grace of god the grace of god was projected you know you see the different crowd on the cross [Music] you know he acknowledges he done portuguese it doesn't matter how many times you have done this come here the fourth live effect i mean it doesn't matter how many times you have gone straight compared to fox italia and it doesn't matter how many times you have done something wrong playing fox the folks have a fake amen as you take your time and repent from your sins as long as you take your time you know and and i know that you've seen amen he will wash you from your sin if you love your heart devops amen he will give you a new role he will donate he will give you a new life if you don't have a new venue amen he will bring that day off inside him but only amen even though you had that day off before memphis was having said columbus promised that death can come back as long as you repent you know the prophet says the prophet you know where that death flew la who said you know that would be where he will come back that means that you have to repent for him and you have to ask god for his forgiveness the same sin that you have done that made that deal fly away from the video it will be when you will repent from those sins say confess that will bring that day off your home because in order for that they have to stay in you focus you have to have the nature of the land they're not true [Applause] you know you do something wrong who fetched questions you will notice that you did something wrong you know as long as we do something wrong oh see we will fetch but as long as you're keeping you know you're keeping yourself you know from from listening to that little voice message still [Applause] no because god knows what you did what could you sex recognizing amen god knew before even you committed faith knew it before you even commented i mean god knew before you even did your free comment your first we see that god gave you know those to the children of israel he gave them the conditions for their blessings as long as you obey my word as long as you keep my judgments my blessing will follow you as long the everything that you would do will be blessed amen those blessings were under condition and the condition was to obey god and to keep his commandments in the goddessic commandment but you will see that the chin of israel there was any this opponent amen they didn't keep all gods coming back out they didn't come on monday but nevertheless they didn't keep god's commandments you will see that god kept god bless them and he got delivered there it got durian by the blessings that god gave them benediction was not in the in the fullness don't say don't say it don't say don't save don't don't don't don't have plenty truth you know in other words that the blessing that they were supposed to receive benediction if they kept god's commandments see god did it you know you know he's not compared to the blessing that they received you know because they didn't keep god's commandments you know i'm gonna give you an example an example you know it's like in the family say call me don't you know you have a family you have parents and and children the dad tells he tells his wife you know as long as you're being a good wife to me you know [Music] as long as you're being respectful you know as long as you you know i would wake up every morning and go to work today you know to give you something to eat and then if the wife is all the children two days on phone you know they don't obey or they don't do they don't do uh uh uh as the promise to the to the dead see this the fourth part of power you know you will see that the grace of god will be required so that they are there and keep his communications so that he can stand up wake up every morning you know even though even though they're not keeping his commandments they're not keeping their promises that's exactly the same thing that happened with them amen god gave his word god gave his commandments that we're supposed to follow can you pose history but we didn't do it but nevertheless he provided his grace to us you know he went he laid party he died on the cross like what did to give us afford the forgiveness of our sins you know he went party you know he died on the cross the man like what you know so that we can be forgiven poconos but one thing is that my own shows we're not supposed to you know to step out we're not supposed to uh throw those sacrifices away in because the bible says in john chapter chapter 3 verse 16. that's crazy like bieber d don't don't john chapter 3 verse 16 is it for me john says john chapter 3 verse 16 the bible says so jean-claude says that okay for god so loved the word and the gospel of the world and that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believer i thank you should not perish but have everlasting life amen you can know this scripture you can't memorize the scriptures where but as long as you don't believe in him deceiving the quiet boundary amen this scripture will not be applied to you may god as long as you believe in him you know verse 7 verse 17 the bible said that for god sent now his son into the world to condemn the world but the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son and this is the condemnation and his son died on the cross a man his son died on the cross sufficient and the death on the cross you know this is now the opium amen for our sickness that's why we call him the lily of the valley and the opium is taken from the lily don't don't don't release and the and the opium is a shot say say l'hopium says it's it could be curious that when you're in pain cause have it comes the man they will give you that shot or that will pick it and that shot will come the pain donated when people sin they call his own pesh amen when you seek confiscate peace when you're worried hey man when you're going through that you know those times a sacrifice for a minute amen whenever you confess you see a shack confessive appreciate amen that bad smell sits moves but as long as that's that you know that that prayer is going to god she said amen that rose of sharing said oh oh shout out amen we'll bring that will bring that sweet smell velmness it's born amen so that your prayer will be listen to god whenever we sing you know when whenever whenever we need whenever you know our sacrifice smell bad sacrifice amen amen that we share little rules of sharing because it's wholesome the works of calvary many people has neglected that works of course and they are regretting now as long as you have the grace of god to come and then come to calvary video calvary and then in closing i'll read the prophet on confess the prophecy that let let me say this you may be here this morning a prostitute situated you may be here this morning a woman chester they actually see you might be here as a as an impure husband an impure wife coming from imperial you might be the violet sinner of sinners you or in other words if you pass that stage of redemption is if you just accept it she will accept it adam had to be willing to accept it i don't the way the way uh i accept this so do you ever fail you know if you accept it she will accept it you know whatever your condition is the parts uh common condition you know grace says grace has been provided grace is projected to you again you just have to accept it with a visual acceptance you know the grace of god is so powerful like has to do a type we saw you know if you read the story of redemption you will see that the grace of god is any that has to do cause the family to backslide affection for you know who was serving a peg who was serving you know out of god understood the the the cell there's the salvia man he calls naomi and his family to backslash amen to go get the lost soul and you'll see that the grace of god was given to ruth and her sister amen it doesn't matter if you know that jesus died for your sins for impossible you know it doesn't matter that you you know that you have the forgiveness of your sins come up with services it doesn't matter if you know the word of god and you know by from genesis to revelation imports when he gives when he gives his grace so he don't say gosh and if his grace is not acceptable that grace becomes the judgment set grass and none of us will we will we will accept the judgment of god because the judgment doesn't so it doesn't save us that's just wanting to serve perhaps judgment has no mercy jesus said the judgment of god will judge us all everybody will go to hell will send everybody to hell you know don't don't take that work of calf with that lightning the panic passes since it's attached to you you know when the grace of god is clear here uh you know it's time for you to repent it's time for but as long as that door is still is still open for me that door will not be open that door has appeared six parts imperial because in other words you will not be because if you're not in taipei amen we saw those examples in the bible because i haven't reached this example you know of all those people who see the two says amen they did things that couldn't be that shouldn't be pardoned his own
