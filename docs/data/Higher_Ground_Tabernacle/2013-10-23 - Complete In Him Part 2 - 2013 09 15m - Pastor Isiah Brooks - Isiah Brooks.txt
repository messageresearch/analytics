TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so let us turn the second Peter the first chapter y'all love God Amen amen amen second Peter and uh people of God I'm working with rapturing material not just salvation but those who will make a rapture second Peter amen the first chapter beginning at the first verse sorry second verse Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as he has divine power have given unto us all things that pertain and unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us a exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature haven't escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to Virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance to Temperance patience and to Patient godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness into brotherly kindness charity but if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall need to be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lack of these things is blind and cannot shift far off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather and brother give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall or stumble is that all right let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you Lord as humble as we know how we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy Lord you've been so good to us Lord there are no words to express our gratitude father give us our Earnest heart that we may seek you every day o God until all these characteristics and qualities are sealed completely up in US Lord manifest it Lord we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated and uh my service a subject amen this morning is still on completion and what house will you Bill me uh we uh basically shared amen that uh we coming from the message uh why are people so tossed about uh we're coming from the message um uh uh statue of a perfect man uh you know we we just by the grace of God want you to understand that we're living in a day that you and I amen must understand what God has come to do remember amen we read the scripture amen where the word of God said that there will be a Ministry of administered amen unto us and that was the 11th verse for so an interest shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and we showed you by the grace of God on last Wednesday how that God is calling us to a higher calling for those of us who have uh received the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother Branham said that is just the beginning we are in a maturing uh our maturing stage of our life and remember by the grace of God God we read there in Hebrews where the Bible says that they cannot be complete without us and brother Branham said that we are the age that will come into the perfect Capstone amen so coming through these uh stages in life amen we recognize amen that there is nothing that we can do uh to make these things happen you either are or you're not but the Bible tells us that God's word of how hard was saith my sheep Hearth my voice and a stranger they will not follow is that right so you and I must understand amen that it is all about hearing the voice of God that was one of the things amen that we studied this morning amen what made Abraham know that the God he had heard who hadn't he had not seen amen with his own eyes how did he know amen that that voice was God's voice it was by election amen if you have been elected to hear the voice of God then you will follow the voice of God is that right understand brother Branham said it like this he said that he did not come Amen to build uh uh uh uh uh uh excuse me he did not come to build an organization that's in the message statue of a burger man he said we're not building an organization he says I'm not here this morning to build an organization Christ never sent me to build an organization so I tied that into II Peter amen I mean yeah the first chapter the 11th verse he said Christ sent me to build individuals to the statue of Jesus Christ that they might be the powerhouse Dwelling Place of his Spirit by his word by his word built up the individual to that place not built an organization to a greater denomination but the individuals to Sons and Daughters of God he said that's the idea he said and to your faith virtue to virtue of knowledge he says well you're coming to a place when you begin to say well we don't have to accept that today you do have to it must be and the reason why I brought that out because there are so many ministers Amen in this message who are literally cutting this portion out and they're basically saying once you've got the experience it's finished but really the problem that God said when you get the experience of the baptism amen you're just beginning it is a work that God is doing in you I I jotted some thoughts down today this morning uh because uh it's not an evil place it's not an evil person or evil thing it is the devil if the devil is on the mountain the mountain is evil right if the devil is in the tree the tree is evil y'all understand what I'm saying amen like it is with God what makes God plays holy is because God is presently there is that right so whenever the devil is somewhere and I'm saying this because as long as you can catch this it's no longer your brother or your sister is that right it is the devil that's moving them or making them or causing that's the word I want causing them to do the things they do so your enemy is not your brother it's not your sister it's not your job or the people on your job it's the devil oh come on somebody that inspires them because of your prayer you said Lord I want to be just like you God said come along and take the trip with me right because he's building you he's making you he's creating you and he is the only one that knows where the darkness is in your life nobody else knows the heart like God does hallelujah and once you begin to look at the calls the calls you can take a better attitude with all of your trials with all of your tests you can have a better attitude and you can say thank you Jesus in the midst of all the storms how often have we ever heard how often we've heard where Satan can't even try you without going by God God must give his permission for you to be tested and tried oh the devil did the devil did know your prayer did and the will of God because it is his good pleasure is that all right see we're talking about coming to a place of completion and I said by the grace of God we looking at the Raptor win it's going to Rapture going to take place looking at all the historical things in the world that ain't what's holding the Rapture back was holding the Rapture back as you and I God can't Dave that went on before us of the the seven churches can't even get up out of the ground until this bride reach her potential her expectancy amen amen she must come to Divine love and when she comes to that place then the other ones can get up because brother Branham said God built the church through seven Church ages right emphasis was Faith right come on all the way up to brotherly kindness which was the Philadelphia age he comes all the way up to the Pentecostal y'all understand what I'm saying amen so you and I must understand what God is doing each age had a virtue that's brother Branham amen come on Amen each age had a virtue going all the way up after your faith virtue and he said that's the way God builds the individual now we can just say oh praise God I've arrived but if you still got a temper you haven't arrived come on somebody if you still got places in your life that's dark there and it's ruling you you have not arrived you might be on a journey but you're not there yet I'm talking about Rapture material what are you saying the Bible said be perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect I think that's Matthew 5 48 but nevertheless and you and I must understand Amen to God is saying be perfect and brother Randall said if God requires you to be perfect he has to make a way Hallelujah and he is the only one that was perfect so in order to be perfect you must have the perfect one where in you see now listen he said so see he don't have to and I want you I don't want you to worry about because I want you to understand that what I'm working with is a seed see the seed of God first of all must be in you in order for God to work it he germatized that seed when you said Lord Jesus I receive you as my personal Savior and you confess it with your mouth and believe in your heart at that point brother random says you have passed from Death unto life but that's just the beginning when God's life comes into that seed now it's ready to grow so amen like he said in the second coming he said I give you a Akon and you have an in-country potentially but it isn't but it's in the sea form you can say you have actually got a tree right you can't say you have actually a god of tree until the seed has produced a tree see so this message didn't come just to identify that you are the seed of God it also came to Quicken the seat and to mature the sea is that what brother random said he comes along right and now he says listen I come to build individuals to the statue of Jesus Christ Paul said it was going to come it came Hallelujah and if these things be in you the Bible says you will never fail you'll never falter amen you'll be perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect oh my right it goes on he says listen it's only for the bride this is not for denominational churches amen is that all right he says listen Amen in the message token he says I have obtained this faith and I'm addressing this this to them that has obtained the life that precious faith I'm not to to the outside world this is to the church those that are in Christ Grace and P be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and remember brother Graham said it can't be just any kind of knowledge this knowledge got to be God sent and if you listen to the message amen a statue of a broken man brother man said I said outside I was out there in the woods I waited for him this is what came to me he sent this to me I had a jubilee time he said I was so loud and I had such a shouting time he said I probably scared the squirrels away so this man wasn't giving you an us he wasn't giving out his thoughts he was literally relaying the thoughts of God to us and this is not something that is optional this is a must now don't feel bad the Bible tells us that when Sarah a man heard that she was going to bring forth a child in her old age the Bible said that she laughed up her sleeve brother Brandon brings that out she laughed and God said you know has she not been Abram's wife he would have slayed her he would have killed her but it didn't stop there because an unconditional it was an unconditional listen the true seed of God I won't I don't want you to worry I want you to press it's not a word I'm not trying to scare a tactic I'm trying to tell you the the entrance had been a ministered to you in abundant way and this thing is about the grace of God to you multiply I showed you last week amen that you have not because you asked not is that nasty statue of a person he said you ought not to stop seeking God he said seek him every day until all these things be in you go listen to it oh but listen to what I'm going to say here you don't add to it it adds to you because everything you need for the Rapture is in the seed amen and all you got to do is eat and pray Eat and Pray water the seed and it will take care of itself is that all right oh thank you Jesus amen so you and I must understand amen amen God does things he he worked with us amen like you said well you know he has out in the book of Isaiah he said the heaven is my throne and Earth is my footstool where is the house that you build unto me and where's the place of my rest and then he goes on he said oh but thou has prepared a body what was the body it was the temple of God and the Bible says know ye not that ye are the temple of God 's desire is the final rest in your soul and in order for him to find rest in your soul you must find rest amen that's the rest Joshua was talking about God coming down living amen into your into your souls is that right like Hebrews listen it ain't about just you the Bible said they cannot be made perfect they can't even come up out of the Resurrection until you and I get in our minds that we're going to do the will of God hello somebody amen so you and I we're holding up the process as I said it's unconditional so what is the lacking the thing that's lacking your faith to believe it can happen me be perfect yes you just as perfect as God is for my show brother man I'm saying like this he said God will make you a shell yes sir hallelujah oh Jesus was was a shell a housing because he said I can't do nothing except the father showed me see that's a total surrendering to God a total surrendering to God and that's our goal when is it going to happen at the squeeze like I said God will either lead you like a lamb or he'll drive you like cattle listen he goes on and I was working with Sarah because the Bible he created recreated in Sarah a womb that will accept seed is that right it's the same thing Ezekiel said amen in the 26th 27th verse a new heart also I would give you and a new spirit within you and I would take the Stony heart out of the Flesh and I'll give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statues his Spirit In You causes you to walk in his statue and ye shall keep my weight my my judgments and do them so you you and I can't even do it except God comes in you to do it that's why he said in Beethoven is in you you do the works of Beethoven right so Ezekiel ties right into what took place at Sarah's life Sarah laughed at it but God had to give her a new spirit he had to create something in her uh uh like brother I said a new spirit to receive his spirit and he said that new spirit amen is given to you so you can be agreeable with the word and yourself is that all right I showed you all you got to do is travail he says Amen in the scripture before she travails she brought forth and for her pain came she was delivered of a man child and that's the thing is a lot of us don't like to prevail you know we want that our little soft cry you know you know just one tear like Hollywood gives you know amen God wants some real travailing like I said you know if Jacob had the Rapture with the angel you will too Hallelujah you got to get out of your comfort zone God God sent a prophet the devil know that believes it the devil got more faith than God than some of us the Bible said that Satan believes and tremble he tramples at the word of God because he knows the word of God the word of listen the devil knows the word of God so much he knows at the end time he'll be destroyed he said prove that those Legions amen that was in Legion said Lord did you come to torment us before our time did I know that Tom is coming and if demons know their time coming the bride knows her time is coming oh Lord hallelujah I'm so excited even because I can see God working on the inside working on the inside amen bringing out a transformation in this place amen is that all right it means so we realize by the grace of God Amen the Bible said except the Lord builds the house they labor in vain that build it except the Lord keep the city The Watchmen wake it but in the night now here brother Banner goes on and says listen he said a lot of you guys oh I can't do this because I might get caught I can't do this because amen I might hurt somebody feeling oh I know no no no no no no no as long as we're doing it that way it's only law there is not listen I don't care amen you can take alcohol and remember I used to be addicted to it you can take it and you can put it all to my face and everything else amen it doesn't bother me I don't go out drinking it's gone see once the demon is gone there's no desire remember I showed you the Bible said if you tempted and you're drawn away you according to James it's your own lust and desire that means you got company in the house demon power is on the inside of you that's calling for that but if there's nothing in you that's gonna call for it no no as much as I used to dance out there in the world and I mean I used to dance there ain't nothing in me no more whatever demon was in me that had me all on the floor it's gone there's no temptation I don't care if it's a rap Boogie Woogie whatever it may be there is nothing that pulls me to that and that's the way it's supposed to be with everything amen of the world totally dead to everything of the world is what God is looking for In You and I hello amen remember I told you denominations cannot produce a bride not in this age every age has produced their bride but not this one what I mean denominations God has already selected those come out of her my people be not partakers of her sin you're part of that group that God has selected Amen to be his bride and I showed you about the grace of God Amen that how Amen in the Book of Revelations the third chapter you have been invited as gold tried in the fire you're going to be tried but you accepted the invitation because you believe your gold come on your gold tried in the fire so the fire is coming and the prophet of God said in this age the fire is heated up seven times harder telling me in Hebrews 10 please is that all right it's a good thing that this message has come to us to bring us to a perfection and as I said amen it's just communication God allows us to see what's wrong in us and it's up to us to do something about it brother Bruce what could I do nothing other than pray the Bible said you have not because you ask not amen come on somebody your your efforts all these things are going okay but you don't want it to remain there you want the complete nature to be changed you'll never find a dove associating with the crow they're two different kind of birds that eat two different kinds of diets amen so you and I must understand the dub nature amen has nothing to do with the world you can be a dove like he said you know you can be a peacock a crow trying to put peacock feathers in you and anybody looking at you know the difference amen because the Seal of God is Not only on the outside but it's on the inside too y'all hear what I'm saying people are busy you're visible amen even demons know you when you don't even know you they know when you don't fit is the light that you carry with you you come on somebody amen I'm trying to take it slow but I'll tell you what I'm not too far from preaching now my point is amen by the grace of God that you and I were blessed if we could get the people to see we're blessed amen and not cursed no matter what Satan says you're not cursed right if God can comes around and and sanctify uh hadessa and comes around and sanctify amen uh uriah's wife come on somebody God can come and sanctify you but understand you can't get into the king's chamber without the process of sanctification did you catch that you cannot get into the king's chamber without the process of sanctification it has to be so you got to come to the grips and say Lord I really want this to be delivered from because you're the only reason why things still exist you have to make the choice of giving it up man you have to make the choice of wanting it to be cleansed come on somebody whosoever will let him come come on this is not a forceful issue but if you are true see you thirst for the Living God with such a intensity brother Banner said million times Millions amen you have such a thirst in your heart to be just like him right Hebrews 10 meaning at the 19th verse having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus that's your privilege this is your privilege with a boldness not a pride now not a pride a boldness humility amen but knowing it's yours by a New and Living weight that's why so many people don't get nothing from God because I'm Brian oh yes I'm right oh I'm such a pride about it right but that's not the wrong kind of pride you should be thankful that God has chosen you to be that but understand what's not by your own works it was by the grace of God but a New and Living Way which he have consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith remember because none of these virtues will ever operate in you without faith having our heart sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold faster profession about faith what without wave ring and he is faithful that promise sound like the same kind of way God worded that thing with Abraham and in the book of Hebrews the 11th chapter by faith is that all right so amen by the grace of God just give me give me a little more time amen I'm not going to be too much longer I'm trying to recap and at the same time I'm trying to get to where I want to go to this morning now God you must recognize you know how can I put it I said it this last week Wednesday I said listen uh uh a chain is as strong as his weakest link and y'all who ever seen little beads if you pull that cord tight wherever the weak point is it'll break and what happens a lot of times you think you don't have the Holy Ghost you think you don't have God in you because you let the chain be broken or the bees pop and come on somebody and that's what the prophet of God said when you when it does happen that means you got to start up again is that right you get those same bees and you line them right back up the way they supposed to be until that one point that's weak becomes strong he called it Vulcanizing when that thing one level strengthens the other amen until you become a Powerhouse oh well brother Brooks how I'm gonna do it you can't do it that's the point I'm trying to tell you you can't do it but God in you will do it if you're willing to let him do it say brother Brooks what are you saying you're gonna have to suffer yeah people gonna get all in your face call you names mistreat you you speak to them and they'll turn their heads and you gotta love them come on somebody amen there's a real sleepy Spirit everywhere in this place but you know by the grace of God Amen we rebuke that devil amen because you know that's he's trying to keep and it's a lot of y'all so don't think it's just you on it I can see everybody that's fighting it so I want you to understand some of y'all are just tired I understand that we're not saying that but God is still able to rejuvenate you that's what we're asking for now we're coming in at five time but here you got to recognize you're recognizing every one of us know Divine love most of us if I could put it that way it's still our goal how many of y'all guided in this all on display come on we know by the grace of God you won't leave out of here in a Rapture without it brother random said that's the only thing that makes it how you gonna get to Divine love if you don't have temperance long-suffering come on somebody's true you gotta have all of this not potentially on display the token was something that even Egyptians could see it ain't about oh I'm in the message it's whether the message is in you on display right brotherly kindness we can use a lesson in that one right we ain't got it like we ought to have right the reason why I say that we're two clickish to clanish every family separated to themselves that's wrong we are the family of God Hallelujah and when your natural family means more to you than your your spiritual family you are out of the wheel why because even Jesus said who is my mother my father my sister and my brother but those who do my father's will oh but listen listen your mama and your brothers come to see you he wouldn't even stop service to serve D hello yeah it's true anyhow listen I want you to know there's a war but let me go to Deuteronomy 8 2. y'all love that Deuteronomy 8 2. none of us are exempt we all learning you love God we all learning and listen that's how I know the Holy Ghost ain't working in our lives like it ought to because it's evident not just in this church it's everywhere but the Bible said amen the love of many shall wax cold it's going to happen if you don't keep the fire burning everybody in here will begin to look faulty to you everybody you look at will become a hypocrite but you um hey and I don't know Divine love thinketh no evil so that's the Bible Revelation 7 24 I'm sorry excuse me Deuteronomy 8 and 2. amen he says what and thou shall remember all the ways which the Lord thy God LED these 40 years in the wilderness to Humble thee to prove thee to know that was in thy to know what was in thine heart whether thou would keep his commandment or no and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and Faith thee with Manna which thou kneweth not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man does not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord does Man live so that is one of the lessons that you and I in this as I said you can't have knowledge knowledges means that God's word is amen amen no matter what anybody else says God's word is amen there is no contradictions in God's word every bit of it is amen and if your reasoning take you away from that you'll never come to a full ceiling of knowledge in you and listen what brother Brandon said y'all know it's the truth he said character is a victory so that means you gotta fight um I know y'all love this kind of preaching don't you I do I love something that's going to go to my heart hallelujah amen that head stuff is okay too but I I like it I like it to go right here amen so when I after the service is over I can say hallelujah God help me I ain't putting no fingers here that blade go both ways here y'all hear what I'm saying amen so you and I we and I must know that he come to Humble us and to try us and you're going to suffer forget it they're gonna be times your bills ain't gonna be paid or or you know something gonna happen you might hunger you might have to go without changing of clothes all these things gonna happen to you and you know what the devil says to you how can you be in the will of God never have I seen the righteous forsaken nor seed begging bread he loves that scripture but when he brings that scripture to me I said well then if that be true you tell me about the man Lazarus who laid at the rich man table he was hungry come on somebody but God's will amen who is the rich man God was proving something who was the rich man was it the man with all the natural wealths or was it the man who had God you're the rich man you got God you got everything oh Paul said there's a war and don't you think you're gonna just walk on easy through this thing Paul said oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from this body of this death I looked that up who's going to deliver me from the power of death because that's what you're living in that's your house your house is a body of death your house is a body that don't want to serve God it doesn't want to pray it don't want to worship it don't want to give Thanksgiving it just don't have nothing to do it it hates God your body that's why it's been condemned don't even think your body want to serve God you have to bring this thing into subjection Paul said I have to Die daily I got to do it every day and that's where we fail we wake up and think well yesterday going to take care of us tomorrow no sir you are died last night and you Rose up this morning for a new day therefore you got to kill the same inning me you killed yesterday you think the devil's gonna give up on you he hadn't given up yet he still think he's going to win the war huh he still thinks he's got a chance and he's got all these people believing he is God yeah yes yes yes listen is this okay amen you got to understand there is a cause turn with me to Isaiah 14. you love the Lord Isaiah 14. I'm going to show you there's a cause here and y'all we got to stop blaming folks and people and places and all this stuff understand you say Lord I want to be just like you God said I'm going to take you there amen amen and you and I must understand and then all of these trials amen what are they doing now I want you to understand I want you to think about this right now every trial coming in you right now is testing your love is testing your love nothing else now you're the of divine love and it makes you he comes to a place where he's trying to make you not love somebody the way God would love him and you got to love your enemies come on somebody we struggling with each other we gotta love our enemies and if you don't see like you can love your enemy or even love your brother in the church you need to get at the altar somewhere in your house in your closet somewhere I'm talking about Rapture material I'm talking about being translated I'm talking about having to Elohim on the inside that's the only way to make make Heaven remember they tend will call five were wise and five foolish so it shows that there's a percentage who will call will not go because they're idolatory they didn't think it was good enough to have the extra oil come on somebody but you and I you and I must have the extra oil and brother random come in this last day he says listen I didn't come to build an organization I came to catch up people away bring them out of an organization and then build them like they did the old Jerusalem like they did over in Ezra Hallelujah we come to build Hallelujah not to tear down when we came it was the church was in Ruins Hallelujah and we had people like Sam Ballard and all of them who tried to stop us from building but they can't stop it's predestinated designed by God Amen to bring a church to Perfection and I'm so glad to be part of that from the wall I can't come down Hallelujah I've got a service amen that I've been anointed to do and so is the Bride of Jesus Christ she's anointed Amen to come into the full statue of Christ she'll cry out she'll close she'll cry out until everything is completed Hallelujah Isaiah 14. see it ain't whether you got the Holy Ghost is whether you're going to continue it's whether you're going to mature huh and listen God is not in a in a hurry how we all Lord help me please do it quickly no God ain't no microwave person he he takes his time he's a slow cooker that's how God works and you and I must understand you're we're blessed we're so I wish I could get the people to see this how blessed we are you know what I was telling somebody I said you know what what really makes me want to feel so good because God give me Grace to repent you see he gave space for Jezebel repent she didn't she wouldn't right if she wouldn't hurt her children will right but those who've been called by God they under the inspiration of Revelation the third chapter be values to repent use values to repent your zealous to get it right Hallelujah that's the inspiration we're under Hallelujah ain't God good Isaiah 14. now we know this is talking about Lucifer I even hate calling his name but it's there amen now yes amen you know that's what brother Brown said he said I can't be no devil I love God too much that's the way I feel I can't be no devil I love God too much see they listen he said listen in the 16th verse y'all y'all can read that at home they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider these saying is this the man that made the Earth the terminal that did Shake kingdoms he's the cause of it he is the call that's why the prophet of God said when that those seals were broken he said all of your sins go back to the one who caused it who is Satan himself if there's trouble in your life Satan is to blame if there's trouble in your family Satan is to blame is there trouble in your heart Satan is a blame that made the world as a Wilderness and destroyed the cities there are right that open not the house of his prisoners thank God he don't even have the keys No More so no matter what prison house he might have you in he ain't got the keys Christ got the keys of death hell and the grave and he's waiting for you so he can open it up and let you go free I don't care what demon has had you and how long it's been in your life God is able to set you free oh that's the cause of it is that all right listen Ephesians 6 12. I got to go here quickly Ephesians 6 12 we're trying not to be too much longer but you know I'm trying to get this thing in us I'm not even nowhere near listen but I want you to understand by the grace of God thank the prophet of God said like this he said God want to see through your eyes he want to speak through your lips he want to walk in your steps he want to be that so connected to you amen that you you no longer he said like Paul said it's not I that live but Christ that lives in me see that's where we're headed we've got to come to that place I said we from the pulpit to the back of the door we must come to that place don't y'all desire to be perfect I do I do I get tired of coming short um somebody and it ain't nothing ain't nothing as fast as I ever thought right it comes so quickly you know whether it be by your brother your sister you you know it comes wherever you may be something comes and it's up to you to accept it or reject it and the Bible said perfect love thinking no ill it thinks no evil but we'll let it come right on through right you can't stop it from coming to the head but when it goes to the heart you need a hard operation thank you Lord all of us got to start getting down to prayer and that's the problem with the prayer that the message church is now they so they they are so how you say elected and predestinated they don't even pray no more that's nonsense hmm it's unconditional yes but you got to understand that unconditional also brought some things through there right oh it's true you can't you see that's what I'm saying this is what you and I must understand we can't make it happen but he can I look towards to hear from which cometh my help my health coming from the Lord hallelujah the Bible said in the name of the Lord is a strong child and the righteous running and they are safe you need and I need to turn more to God that's the only way it's going to happen I'm telling you if you're trying to do it on your own you're gonna you're gonna mess up you're gonna mess up and Satan always that's how he discouraged so many Christians he got you working it out working it out working it out you know what the scripture said your works of the Lord is is to believe on him whom God hath sent that's your work because once you believe on him whom God has sent amen you'll do the things that's right he said if you believe Abraham was my father he said you do the works of Abraham amen that's right and if you believe that William Branham is the seventh Church age messenger you you'll do the works it comes with it just like uh uh I was listening to uh what message is that um why are people so talked about he goes on I believe he said amen where he was talking about uh uh uh uh uh pharaoh and and Moses and and he and and and he was telling the people except you do what I say do you gonna perish that thing hit me so is it with our Angel our messenger you know brother Bradham God told him that your your ministry was greater than Moses and Elijah and all the other Ministries that have come greater greater and if you believe on him you must do as he say oh I got you quiet now that's all right it's true anyhow amen I ain't missing the Raptor for nobody Ephesians 6 12. for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take on the whole arm of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand what is the whole arm of God he feeds you I mean excuse me second Peter we just read that after your face virtual knowledge to Allah that's the whole armor amen Hallelujah glory to God Amen Colossians 1 please the whole armor the devil will shake at you oh I gotta say it I gotta quote read that quote in just a moment ah Colossians 1 16. for by him we were all things created that are in heaven that are in Earth visible invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things created by Him and what for him so if he created principalities don't you know he's got rule over him whew he's got all power I'll rule all without that time principalities I read that so that you can go to me with me to Colossians 2 8 15. 2 15. is that right having and having spoiled principalities and power he made a show of them openly triumphant over them in it so he'd try out and the prophet God said every Victory Jesus won we won it every victory I'll tell you what ah I forgot that brother the Indian brother the Navajo what's his name brother brother Mark when brother Mark came in he prophesied something you know about my daughter and I tell you what it happened just like he said two days it was done now with that same restoration my daughter who's been married eight years is pregnant Hallelujah come on he whispered in my ear and it came to pass in two days Gibson callings without repentance now we don't know where all he's going to lead and I believe God going real men he said he'd turn he'll return so we'll see see what God is going to do with it but you know what if I had shot on him because he was a little different I would have never got what God had for me hello somebody we don't forgot how messed up we were until we came into this message but one thing that man got a testimony of that the property God preached at his tribe Hallelujah brought the message hiya come on somebody now you and I must understand God is still God I refuse to be in denominational organization I'm so sorry If Abraham said the lot was his brother then I've got a brother too and Abraham was willing to die for his brother I'm willing to die for mine too come on somebody Colossians 2 15 did I read that he spoiled it is that right he brought an open show he on Calvary he said listen oh he said all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me and then he comes along and said I'm giving you that I'm giving you that same power is that all right let's turn him into Romans 8 38. you love God I'm enjoying this I hope you are amen because this is wonderful to me that God is building us I got five minutes God is building us Amen to a perfect place in him and I'm enjoying it I am enjoying it I can see now when the Devil Comes it's the devil whether it comes to a a daughter or a a a lamb a neighbor it doesn't matter I know who I am and you must know who you are and that God has come to try you and test you amen so that you can be that kind of a sheep that won't open his mouth while you're being persecuted it's a higher calling is a higher calling 8 38 is that all right for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor power nor things present nor things to come no height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to watch separate us he didn't say separate me he said separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord nothing your attitude toward the word of God will bring things to pass so no evil formed against me shall prosper come on somebody you love the Lord I'm gonna jump here because I hadn't even gotten to the virtues again I stopped at I think uh patience was it a whichever it was but we'll start there this evening but let me read just a portion of this quote uh and I'll start that off uh this evening he said he said what we need in in in in in Jeffersonville and brown Tabernacle he said thousands of lived voices thundering of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled living walking around in the Earth today without a blemish he said yes sir real Christians there's Thunders against the enemy the devil don't care uh how loud you holla uh jumping shop but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated unto God Amen and then he goes on and said that's the Thunder that shakes the devil and y'all hear that that's what gets him upset when he see he can't move you You Like a Rock of Gibraltar Hallelujah when he see a man that your faith is so steadfast amen that you're not wondering or am I saved today or am I lost Hallelujah well I'm gonna make a Rapture whether I'm not gonna make a Rapture Hallelujah Abraham how do you know you're gonna have that son 25 years because God Said So how do you know you're gonna come to Perfection because God said so that's how I know not my work not by power but by my spirit said the Lord let's stand yeah so what we gonna do this evening we'll go through the the we'll try to go through the uh those virtues again all of them uh as briefly as we possibly can just to give you an idea what you you must be watch for love Watch and Pray right watch and pray I showed you how the other day I was running you know I do not I just do a little jogging but you know I was jogging down the road and of course I was crossing over and here I was amen still in the street and I knew the guy was going to say something you get out of the street and I didn't say nothing but I said move over you see what I'm saying I shouldn't have said anything that was a test I failed y'all hear me y'all hear what I'm saying hey man I heard listen I I don't I hope y'all don't nobody take this bad I'm running in my neighborhood and and and and these people said hey you black and I'm thinking I know it hello that must have been a divine revelation to somebody I know what color I am you know but I could have got upset right and then it's just the same then there was a group of boys and they heard of something out of the car too and you know the devil said you're gonna take that and I kept running like I ignored him old fella like me gonna take on four boys come on somebody and you know if I had said something they're going to turn around huh so you say you got to have wisdom and you know right because remember Satan it takes two to tangle and you can't argue with without somebody that's going to follow it up through right a person when they're screaming and hollering at you and you ain't saying nothing feel really stupid y'all hear what I'm saying one of the worst one of the best things you can tell somebody when they get all messy with you is to say you know I really love you it just messes them up yeah see it from the heart you know I really love you and you know you'll be surprised it just makes the devil shake you know that normally when you do that to a person they feel so bad they come back and ask for forgiveness people you got to be that example you can't let the devil just toss you to and fro and make some kind of puppet out of you and you know what I'm saying you just gotta just start saying God help me and when you see I'm gonna tell you something if you in the spirit you can almost feel it coming before you even get there you can feel it y'all know what I'm talking about it's like a dimensional thing you cannot you I can feel it coming because I I would feel it most of the time when before things come I can feel it coming my way don't know what the person might say or do but I know it's coming see that's walking in the spirit that's literally walking and that's where God wants all of us to walk in the spirit right can I share one more thing and I was just a young Christian wisdom in school you know I learned that when you're in school you learn how to save all your test papers don't ever assume your instructor is going to be fair to you y'all hear what I'm saying now I say that and I don't know who is it for but you better remember what I'm saying because amen I was at that time a little arrogant didn't know it but I anyway should have gotten an a out of the class right at the end of the day at the last test I knew I scored good on it I knew I did and I walked out that room said to that teacher I know I got my a H I'm supposed to be I'm a Christian now supposedly anyway what happened when it came through the mail in the summertime I had a c but you see I didn't keep all my paperwork I didn't keep all my test exams I couldn't even argue with this man and I really was so broken I cried and went to my past in the church told him about he says listen do you have this this man again for uh another uh time I'm saying all of this because remember whether it be your boss whoever it is is uh is superior at work at school wherever you are you have to be careful what you say don't ever get into a place where you think that you you got it all together and you could be arrogant in your stand just as soon as you get proud and puffy God bringing you down you see because that's what happened to me God brought me down now when I came back to that after the summer the first thing that instructor said to me to let me know he purposely did what he did he said Isaiah you might get an A this year but what I'm going to do swell up like a frog you see what I'm saying it would have caused more trouble but I learned through a wise man keep your mouth shut and guess what I got that Aid am I making sense well no matter where it is you've got to be careful on how you say and do things in this world because first of all the world only love their own and you've got to remember you're not of the world and I don't care how much they smile in your face they are not your friends huh I'm telling telling it comes to standing with a sinner versus standing with you they're going to stand with the sinner even though they know The Sinner is wrong and you're right that's the word you love God just giving you some wisdom somebody gonna need this somebody's gonna need it listen amen because I'm telling you now we've come to be a standard and the world is not worthy of us let's pray father God we come before you Lord as homeless we know how we think it for your grace and your mercy Lord we appreciate you Lord for being so good to us Lord we pray that you bless the servant in a special way Lord let the word be anchored into the hearts of the people father that their change will come about in our lives we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
