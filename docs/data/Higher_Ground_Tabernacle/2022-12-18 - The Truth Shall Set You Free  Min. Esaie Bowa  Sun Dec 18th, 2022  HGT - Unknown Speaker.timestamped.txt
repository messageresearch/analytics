[43:37] [Music]
[44:49] we've been condemned by Representatives
[44:52] Christ
[45:41] 1955
[45:49] it is a scene he says this is love
[45:58] he said notice in the time when the
[46:00] slaves now be being sold
[46:06] and we were all sold out to sing by
[46:10] Adams foreign
[46:58] Glory of of God

[48:27] he came to deliver them from Spirituals
[48:31] the slavery of sin we may face Esther
[48:34] yes
[49:00] [Music]
[49:02] but Jesus identifies himself
[49:09] he said I am the way the truth and the
[49:13] lies

[49:34] truth the way and the life

[50:10] and that was Jesus
[50:19] in the doors

[50:29] 32
[50:37] it is
[50:40] you see now

[50:52] second is
[51:01] I told you that my subject is you will
[51:04] know the truth and the truth
[51:08] and Jesus was the truth in his time
[51:15] to me it's absolutely
[51:19] that's what we're looking for is true
[51:26] Jesus said You shall know the truth the
[51:28] truth shall set you free
[51:32] and he is the truth
[51:39] he is Jesus Jesus Son of God is the
[51:42] truth of the world
[51:45] because he was the world made flesh
[51:50] in the beginning was the world
[52:00] and the world was made
[52:07] [Applause]
[52:09] then that made him
[52:13] Jesus was the truth
[52:18] then that made him the truth
[52:22] because the word is the truth
[52:26] he was the world
[52:43] we have to repeat
[53:10] this great move of God
[53:13] of all moving across the nation
