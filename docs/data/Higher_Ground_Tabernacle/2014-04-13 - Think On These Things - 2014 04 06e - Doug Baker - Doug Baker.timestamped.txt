[2:00] we have so many positive wonderful
[2:03] things to think on and we are living in
[2:06] the we're not in the lip age or the nose
[2:08] age or even the eye age we're at the
[2:10] mind now where the thoughts are coming
[2:14] and and he wants us to think on his
[2:17] thoughts and his thoughts are good

[2:22] hopeful they're encouraging they're
[2:25] uplifting how many believes that amen
[2:28] God wants to lift you up tonight
[2:30] he wants you to be encouraged I believe
[2:33] that amen he's not beating his bride he
[2:36] he wants her he's not a wife beeter he
[2:39] loves her hallelujah amen let's bow our
[2:42] heads heavenly father thank you once
[2:45] again for this opportunity to stand
[2:46] before the purchase of your blood and
[2:48] father I tremble as I as I stand
[2:51] before my my precious brothers and
[2:54] sisters because I I realize Lord if I I
[2:58] I think just how precious that blood was
[3:01] the very blood of God that was created
[3:03] you wrapped yourself in a blood cell how
[3:06] precious that blood was but father you
[3:09] I'm looking here this evening at at what
[3:11] you exchanged it for Lord a hidden
[3:15] treasure father we we just we we we
[3:19] think about that blood and how precious
[3:20] it is and we think my if I could just
[3:23] have a few drops of that how precious
[3:25] that blood is the very blood of God not
[3:27] not blood of men not tainted but the
[3:30] very blood of God where you took off
[3:32] your Royal robes and wrapped yourself
[3:34] you made yourself so small that we
[3:36] walked right over you Lord that we we
[3:39] got telescopes where we're looking out
[3:41] in the the far reaches of the universe
[3:43] trying to find you and really we need a
[3:45] microscope because you made yourself of
[3:47] no reputation you you became less than
[3:50] one of us you you became a footwash
[3:53] flunky so to speak Lord we don't mean
[3:55] that in disrespect but Lord you you
[3:58] humbled yourself and it was a choice
[4:00] that you made you made yourself so small
[4:02] so that there's no way we could miss you
[4:05] and but yet Lord we find that we walk
[4:07] right over our head is up looking for
[4:10] Grand things and we don't realize that
[4:12] you've came so low that we wouldn't be
[4:14] able to miss you father it just humbles
[4:16] us to think of how almighty God took
[4:19] that place that you took our place Lord
[4:22] so that we could take yours but we just
[4:25] hard for us to Fathom but that's what
[4:26] you wanted at first plan and just want
[4:29] to line up to it Lord least we could do
[4:31] is take advantage of what you've
[4:33] provided for us bless my brothers and
[4:35] sisters here tonight Lord as I look at
[4:36] what you exchanged your blood for father
[4:39] I I tremble because I realize the what
[4:42] these brothers and sisters Lord the the
[4:45] The Germ of life that's down in their
[4:47] souls what it's worth to you that you
[4:49] would forsake all and and Lord and
[4:53] exchange your very own life for them
[4:56] bless them tonight Lord guide our words
[4:58] our thoughts Lord just may your
[5:00] blessings remain on this Fellowship oh
[5:02] God as your word Goes Forth search our
[5:05] hearts Lord we're not looking for you to
[5:07] beat us up for that's not your way and
[5:10] that's not what you're trying to do but
[5:12] father a conviction come if there's
[5:14] anything that we need to confess Lord we
[5:17] want to zealously do that we want to
[5:19] eagerly and
[5:21] enthusiastically uh take advantage of
[5:23] the opportunity that we have to repent
[5:25] and draw closer to you Lord so bless
[5:28] your people Lord as your word goes go
[5:29] forth quicking it Lord Make It live
[5:32] father we give you the praise and honor
[5:33] and glory in Jesus Christ's name amen
[5:36] amen you may be seated we could just say
[5:38] amen and finish the service and and go
[5:41] right into communion but uh I do have
[5:43] something on my heart here to try to try
[5:46] to behave if I
[5:48] can just you know such a wonderful poll
[5:53] on the word of God and as your pastor
[5:55] and I was discussing here the other day
[5:57] it's not about noise it's not about
[5:59] volume level it's not about whether you
[6:01] move or you don't move it's whether or
[6:03] not you're pulling on that word and you
[6:05] can pull on it loudly you can pull on it
[6:07] quietly but if you're pulling the
[6:10] preacher's going to preach amen praise
[6:13] His wonderful name so I'd like to title
[6:15] the thought here for just a few moments
[6:16] here tonight think on these things think
[6:20] on these things so I'd like to read from
[6:23] Jeremiah chapter 29 I'm going to read
[6:25] starting from the eth verse very
[6:27] familiar scripture once again I trust
[6:29] for not bringing any Strange Fire or
[6:31] anything that your pastor hasn't hasn't
[6:33] brought it's not our motive our
[6:35] objective that we're we just want to put
[6:36] our shoulder behind what we believe
[6:38] God's doing and and
[6:40] encourage amen as as we're encouraged
[6:42] when your pastor comes out our way
[6:45] Jeremiah chapter 29 and verse 8 for thus
[6:47] saith the Lord of hosts the god of
[6:49] Israel let not your prophets and your
[6:51] divers that be in the midst of you
[6:53] deceive you neither hearken to your
[6:56] dreams which he caused to be dreamed for
[6:59] they prophesy falsely unto you in my
[7:02] name I have not sent them sayeth the
[7:05] Lord so forget about what the Dooms ders
[7:07] and the soothsayers and the you know
[7:10] well you must have done something
[7:11] because you know life's happening to you
[7:13] and God's expressing his displeasure
[7:16] towards you you know because uh you know
[7:18] you're going through trials I'm going
[7:19] through trials because I'm a I'm a Son
[7:22] of
[7:24] God for thus sayeth the Lord that after
[7:28] 70 years be accomplished lished at
[7:30] Babylon I will visit you and perform my
[7:33] good word towards you in causing you to
[7:37] return to this place for I know the
[7:41] thoughts that I think toward you sayeth
[7:44] the Lord and the thoughts that I'm
[7:46] thinking toward you are thoughts of
[7:48] peace and not of evil to give you an
[7:52] expected end now friends you have an
[7:55] expected end here tonight God knows your
[7:58] end he he for or danger and he sees the
[8:01] end and you're walking towards that he
[8:04] knows your end and it's not an
[8:07] unexpected your life does not have a
[8:09] surprise
[8:10] ending amen your life has an expected
[8:15] end God won't be surprised and I hope we
[8:18] get to the place where we're not
[8:20] surprised Hallelujah he says then shall
[8:23] you call upon me and you shall go and
[8:24] pray unto me and I will hearken unto you
[8:27] and you shall seek me and find find me
[8:29] when you shall search for me with all
[8:31] your heart and I will be found of you
[8:33] sayeth the Lord and I will turn away
[8:35] your captivity and I will gather you
[8:37] from all the nations and from all the
[8:39] places whether I have driven you sayeth
[8:41] the Lord and I will bring you again into
[8:43] this place whence I cause you to be
[8:45] carried away captive may the Lord add
[8:47] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[8:49] here tonight so God wants his children
[8:52] to know I I know my thoughts concerning
[8:56] you and friends he's not a wife beater
[9:00] he's not a uh you know if we're not
[9:02] careful we get this picture of a a God
[9:04] that's wanting a punishing God he's a
[9:07] god of Mercy he's a god of Grace well
[9:10] you know he's an Angry God and he's look
[9:13] what happened in the garden when Adam
[9:15] fell that Adam did not cease to be a Son
[9:17] of God but God came looking for him God
[9:22] Ran screaming through the garden looking
[9:25] for his son and immediately immediately
[9:29] after after pronouncing judgment because
[9:31] sin has to be judged things have to be
[9:33] dealt with but he didn't curse his son
[9:35] amen he cursed the Earth and all these
[9:37] different things and and The Serpent and
[9:40] and talked about pain and childbirth and
[9:42] all that but then he immediately began
[9:43] to say how he was going to
[9:47] restore Hallelujah you know we're not
[9:50] careful not not here per se but if we're
[9:53] not careful in christiandom we're trying
[9:54] to make this so hard when God is trying
[9:57] to make it easy you you got to reject
[10:00] his Mercy you know judgment is just the
[10:04] ab absence of Mercy that's all it is and
[10:06] you have to reject Mercy before you fall
[10:10] under judgment so you've essentially
[10:12] brought it on yourself it would be like
[10:14] me standing here tonight and saying all
[10:16] right I'm going to turn on the light you
[10:17] say I don't want the light on it so I
[10:18] turn it off you say I don't want to be
[10:20] in darkness so I turn on the light you
[10:21] say I don't want to be in the light you
[10:23] can't have both ways right you turn on
[10:25] the light that's Mercy you turn it off
[10:28] that's that's judgment amen you turn off
[10:30] the light it's the absence of light amen
[10:33] so so judgment is what's left when you
[10:35] reject Mercy somebody say praise the
[10:38] Lord praise the Lord so we can argue
[10:40] with this we can wrestle with it or we
[10:43] can accept it as his word to us God
[10:47] knows his thoughts tonight concerning
[10:49] you and they are not evil but they are
[10:52] of peace and he has an expected end for
[10:57] each and every one of you God wants you
[10:59] to know his mind is made up you know we
[11:02] sing that song I Got My Mind Made Up and
[11:05] I won't turn back and you know I want to
[11:07] see my Jesus one day we sing that song
[11:10] well he made his mind up long before you
[11:11] made yours up his mind was settled
[11:14] before you showed up his thought
[11:17] concerning you is settled
[11:20] amen hallelujah so God's not in the
[11:22] process of making up his mind but he's
[11:26] he's thought it all through he's not
[11:28] surprised by anything that's come along
[11:30] the way the devil has not once gotten
[11:32] over God he hasn't once thwarted him he
[11:35] hasn't once defeated him he's a tool
[11:38] tonight friends so according to the
[11:41] scripture this was a time as as we're
[11:43] reading here in the Bible in this text
[11:44] this was a time that Israel was about to
[11:46] go down into bondage they were about to
[11:48] be carried off into Babylon this is the
[11:50] chosen uh uh uh children of God which
[11:52] are actually foreshadowing the true Sons
[11:55] and Daughters of God that would come
[11:56] forth in the New Testament
[11:59] they were about to lose everything that
[12:01] they had they were about to lose their
[12:03] homes they were about to lose their jobs
[12:05] they were about to lose their Vineyards
[12:07] they were about to lose their place of
[12:09] worship they were about to lose
[12:11] everything that was dear to them but
[12:13] Jeremiah as a as being the voice of God
[12:16] among them he began to comfort the
[12:18] people and he began to assure them that
[12:20] God was completely in control of this
[12:23] situation even in this great and
[12:25] terrible time and it was friends he was
[12:28] able to come them and he was able to let
[12:30] them know before they even left into
[12:32] captivity that God had already prepared
[12:35] a way to bring them back into the land
[12:39] again you see God knew the exact number
[12:41] of days that they would be gone he knew
[12:44] exactly when they would come back and he
[12:46] knew exactly how he would get them back
[12:48] into their home again there was nothing
[12:50] he wasn't making it up a as he went
[12:52] along so when we look at this we see
[12:55] that God was comforting his people
[12:57] before they everl just as he comforted
[13:00] Adam and Eve before they walked out of
[13:02] the
[13:03] garden he said I'll send another seed
[13:06] amen I'll come myself Hallelujah I'll
[13:10] give you another seed Hallelujah so when
[13:13] we look at this we see God comforting
[13:15] the people before they ever left and he
[13:17] wanted them to know that there was a way
[13:20] already made for them to come back they
[13:22] had an expected
[13:24] end so it's a beautiful story and we
[13:27] find this very same story as I said we
[13:29] find it starting in the Garden of Eden
[13:31] we find it uh uh ending in the end time
[13:34] of the Gentile dispensation thousands of
[13:36] years later which we are living in now
[13:38] so the children of Israel they were
[13:40] carried into into captivity into Babylon
[13:43] and their Temple was destroyed their
[13:45] place of worship was destroyed and we
[13:48] read in the book of Zachariah chapter 4
[13:50] where God told him he said go tell
[13:52] zerubabel I will restore sayeth the Lord
[13:56] not by power not by might but by my
[13:59] Spirit sayith the lord and there was
[14:01] nothing that could keep that from being
[14:03] restored and God told Zachariah to go
[14:06] tell zerubabel because zerubabel was
[14:08] worried he was concerned here's a big
[14:10] job and and the thing has to be done it
[14:12] has to be completed and it looked like
[14:13] they had a long way to go and he had all
[14:15] these people you know well I don't think
[14:17] that's right here and I don't think
[14:18] that's right there and I I think you
[14:20] ought to do it this way and people
[14:21] wanting to help him and he was just so
[14:23] you know he knew it was beyond his own
[14:26] ability to finish this Temple to bring
[14:28] it back to restore it and so God told
[14:32] Zachariah go tell him not by might nor
[14:36] by power but by my spirit sayith the
[14:39] Lord I will restore and that's just a
[14:42] shadow friends of what he's doing in the
[14:45] body of Christ here in the end he said I
[14:47] will restore and this time it's not a
[14:50] it's not a building made out of marble
[14:52] and gold and stone but it's a living
[14:54] Tabernacle he said I will restore I will
[14:56] have a body I will have preeminence in
[14:58] it
[14:59] and he is having that and it's not by my
[15:02] mind it's not by this one saying well I
[15:04] think it ought to be this way it's not
[15:06] by a group saying well here's what I
[15:08] think the seven Thunders are it's it's
[15:09] the Seven Virtues and here's what the
[15:11] virtues are like you know some
[15:13] intellectual version of the virtues amen
[15:16] uh but but it's the spirit of God coming
[15:19] down and doing in you what you can't do
[15:22] Hallelujah so it's a beautiful
[15:25] story so uh there was uh uh we find in
[15:29] the book of Isaiah that before the
[15:31] temple was even destroyed God had
[15:34] already determined the man that would
[15:35] restore it and we find that Daniel told
[15:39] Nebuchadnezzar about about his dreams
[15:41] and and and he tells him uh you have a
[15:44] kingdom now talking to neb
[15:46] Nebuchadnezzar but the kingdom that you
[15:48] have now it's going to be taken away and
[15:51] given to the mes and to the Persians and
[15:53] Isaiah had already spoken of a Persian
[15:56] king and his name was Sirius that would
[15:58] come and would destroy Babylon and set
[16:00] at Liberty the children of God to
[16:03] rebuild the Temple so this was hundreds
[16:05] of years before the temple had ever even
[16:08] been taken down and had ever been
[16:10] destroyed so God tells him you will be
[16:14] you will be destroyed but I will re I
[16:16] will rebuild again and it won't be by my
[16:19] it won't be by might it won't be by
[16:21] power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord
[16:24] somebody say praise the Lord so God sent
[16:27] this King by the name of syrius in to
[16:29] destroy Babylon now imagine here he
[16:32] comes in and he's he's he's riding in
[16:34] over the walls that the uh the Persian
[16:36] army had brought down and and and the
[16:39] priest sees him coming and a priest
[16:41] looks out he runs back in he goes and
[16:43] gets some Scrolls and uh he's thinking
[16:47] you know I think I've read something
[16:48] about this somewhere and so he runs over
[16:50] to this great king he with his Scrolls
[16:53] he asks him what's your name and he says
[16:56] my name is Sirius so he opens the scroll
[16:58] go to Isaiah and he says oh yeah here
[17:01] you are in this 600y old letter written
[17:05] by one of the prophets so this king's
[17:08] name was already put here because he was
[17:11] to be a Shepherd Of God for the sake of
[17:13] the Jewish people so these things were
[17:15] already known of
[17:17] God and so that's why Jeremiah could be
[17:19] so comfortable in the word of the Lord
[17:22] to the people and he tells them I know
[17:24] my thoughts toward you and they are
[17:26] thoughts of peace and not of evil and I
[17:29] know your final destination I know your
[17:33] end so everything that is happening was
[17:36] only happening to bring them to the
[17:39] expected end that God had already
[17:41] ordained for them now listen closer
[17:45] tonight friends the destruction of
[17:47] Israel was not for the destruction of
[17:50] the seed of God but it was to destroy
[17:53] the idolatry that had moved in and had
[17:56] wormed its way among the children of
[17:58] Israel God knew that he could uh he
[18:01] could take all of that idolatry out
[18:03] renew the temple and still not lose one
[18:06] of his children amen isn't that
[18:07] wonderful hallu you know in the flood we
[18:11] look at the flood and we uh you know I
[18:13] this used to trouble me and just forgive
[18:16] me for this but I wasn't questioning God
[18:18] I'm just trying to rightly divide and
[18:19] try to rightly place and you know you
[18:21] read in the scripture where it says uh
[18:23] God God repented that he had made man
[18:26] and he wiped out you know men off off
[18:29] the face of the earth except for eight
[18:30] souls and then one that went before
[18:32] right but God never it see what I
[18:37] injected in there was my own thought
[18:39] what I injected in there was that God
[18:41] had repented of making Sons he never
[18:44] said that he never repented of making
[18:47] Sons and Daughters not one of his
[18:49] children were
[18:50] destroyed he destroyed flesh he he
[18:53] repented that that he allowed this uh
[18:57] permissive way yeah to come in human
[18:59] flesh amen but he never repented about a
[19:02] son or daughter of God and not one of
[19:05] them was lost
[19:06] amen I want the devil to hear that not
[19:09] one of them was
[19:10] lost neither will they ever
[19:16] be so think of the grace of God here
[19:18] friends as Paul shares it we're going to
[19:20] go back to Romans 8 here for just a
[19:22] moment we were reading from it just as
[19:23] we were closing I want to pick up on it
[19:25] again here for a moment Romans 828 and
[19:27] we know that all things work together
[19:30] for good to them that love God so I want
[19:33] you to recognize here tonight I know you

[20:24] a way that a lot of people want to teach
[20:25] it you know they want to hold your heel
[20:27] over the Flames of hell have you run to
[20:29] an altar every service when are we going
[20:31] to experience the love of God yeah where
[20:34] he forsook everything to come down paid
[20:37] the ultimate price now he's going to do
[20:39] that because he's gambling or because he
[20:41] wants to lose you or condemn you or call
[20:44] your names no that's what that's what
[20:46] uncalled preachers do but that's not
[20:50] God
[20:52] Hallelujah for whom he did for new for
[20:56] no he also did predestinate to be be
[20:58] conformed to the image of his son that's
[21:01] your that's your expected in he's
[21:03] telling you right now that he might be
[21:05] the firstborn among many Brethren
[21:07] there's going to be Brethren just like
[21:09] him moreover whom he did predestinate
[21:12] then he also called that's him doing the
[21:14] work whom he called them he also
[21:16] Justified whom he justified them he also
[21:19] glorified so he's telling you about your
[21:21] glorified condition amen you see God
[21:25] actually forew his sons and daughters
[21:27] that make his bride body before this
[21:31] awful thing ever happened here on the
[21:33] earth when man fell in the garden and
[21:36] and and sin entered into the picture God
[21:38] knew how many believes that Hallelujah
[21:41] before all the troubles before all the
[21:43] problems God knew that he had a bride
[21:46] and he knew what the conditions were
[21:48] that she would come into he knew the
[21:50] conditions that we would be living in in
[21:52] this age God already before we ever left
[21:57] his mind he knew how he was going to get
[22:00] us back to his mind if you will he knew
[22:03] how he was going to put us back into the
[22:05] place that he for knew that we would be
[22:09] it God knows his thoughts concerning you
[22:11] and I tonight you believe that
[22:14] tonight so the problem with us getting
[22:17] back to this dual being here again the
[22:20] problem with us as human beings is that
[22:22] we're we right now are living in a
[22:24] shadow world and because we're living in
[22:26] a shadow world we have limited sight yes
[22:29] and we have limited Vision that we walk
[22:31] in amen our vision in the natural it's
[22:34] limited and it's shaped by our birth
[22:36] it's shaped by our home life it's shaped
[22:39] by our circumstances it's shaped by
[22:41] Fellowship it's shaped by uh uh uh our
[22:44] past the different things that we've
[22:46] gone through now friends this isn't an
[22:47] opinion you didn't choose this this is
[22:49] just how it works amen amen so we are
[22:52] limited and our vision is so narrow
[22:56] because we often can only see and hear
[23:00] uhh uh what's now and we can only see
[23:03] and focus on the problems that we're
[23:05] facing at the moment and that becomes
[23:07] the whole picture to us is that right
[23:10] and then our vision becomes so molded by
[23:12] our troubl so molded by our issues so
[23:15] molded by our experiences so molded by
[23:19] life
[23:20] circumstances but the scripture is
[23:22] telling us here tonight that our lives
[23:24] are so much bigger than our condition
[23:29] so much bigger than our home life so
[23:31] much bigger about than how we were
[23:33] raised so much bigger than what has
[23:36] befalling us along the way you see this
[23:39] picture goes all the way back to the
[23:42] mind of God and God already knew he sees
[23:46] your expected end
[23:49] Hallelujah whom he did for know he also
[23:52] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[23:54] image of his son that he might be the
[23:57] firstborn among many Brethren amen
[24:00] somebody say praise the Lord praise the
[24:02] Lord so that means that there's a people
[24:04] that are predestinated to be the very
[24:06] image of the Son of God Amen you believe
[24:09] that tonight do we realize the full
[24:12] meaning of
[24:13] that you know you weren't just born at
[24:16] any
[24:17] time or or in any age you couldn't have
[24:20] been born in Luther's age you know when
[24:23] God formed the Earth he formed your body
[24:25] in the earth amen but there was a
[24:28] certain age there's there's a certain
[24:31] light that would wake you up and the
[24:34] light that's waking you up tonight is
[24:36] evening light the Morning Light didn't
[24:38] do it you know you can study in botney
[24:40] and you can see that there are seeds
[24:41] that won't be woke up by Morning Light
[24:43] there it takes us you you'll find that
[24:45] there are seeds that it takes so many
[24:47] hours of daylight and so many hours of
[24:50] darkness and that balance has to be just
[24:52] right or that seed ain't coming
[24:55] forth you couldn't have come forth in
[24:57] any other day brother uh brother Brooks
[25:00] I I I beat myself black and blue and and
[25:02] I finally God took that stick out of my
[25:04] hand here and uh this is last year you
[25:07] know and I've been walking in this for
[25:08] 20s something years now just this last
[25:10] year I've been beating myself up Sister
[25:12] Brooks because I didn't come sooner you
[25:15] know why did I why was I 28 before I
[25:18] came to the truth then it finally dawned
[25:20] on me how could I I never heard the
[25:25] truth I came when I was supposed to come
[25:29] when the light came across my path I
[25:32] responded I didn't go I didn't go 30
[25:34] years to figure out whether I believed
[25:35] it or not I responded right then but
[25:38] then I've I've allowed the devil to beat
[25:40] on me for years because I didn't you
[25:44] know you know I I served the devil for
[25:46] you know 10 15 years Liv like a a dog
[25:49] you know instead of glorifying God and
[25:51] and you know you just wish you could I
[25:53] do that I couldn't have come any sooner
[25:55] amen I came when I was supposed to come
[26:01] Hallelujah so we've been brought forth
[26:03] in a time when the Son of God will be
[26:05] alive again in humanity and the image of
[26:08] the Son of God will come alive again in
[26:10] a body that's where we're at we aren't
[26:14] here in the stock time we aren't here in
[26:15] the in the tassel time we're not here in
[26:18] the in the time of the husk but we're
[26:20] here with in the grain time where the
[26:22] life is back in the graen so Jesus said
[26:25] father glorify thy name and he said I
[26:28] have glorified my name and I will
[26:31] glorify it again we're living in that
[26:34] time so here we are in the time when the
[26:37] name of the Lord is being glorified
[26:39] again in a many membered body amen so
[26:43] you see that that very same life that
[26:46] was in the bridegroom is now in another
[26:48] body and it it it has found its power it
[26:52] has found its reality it has found its
[26:55] body that is willing to surrender to the
[26:57] powers of of Christ it's not up to us to
[27:00] make anything happen it's up to us to
[27:02] surrender and he'll do it so think about
[27:05] where we're at today friends I'm not
[27:07] going to keep you too long here tonight
[27:08] think of where we're at today Jesus said
[27:10] in Matthew chapter 16 verse 18 Thou Art
[27:13] Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my
[27:16] church and the Gates of Hell will not
[27:18] Prevail against it what a powerful
[27:21] statement what a prophecy who's going to
[27:24] stop him he declared that he's building
[27:27] it by his Spirit not by might not by
[27:30] power but over 2,000 years by my spirit
[27:34] sayeth the Lord so the word himself is
[27:37] telling us what he's going to do in the
[27:40] end time and the prophet of God picked
[27:42] up on the layout picked up on this in
[27:44] the Le and age and he said he's the
[27:47] author of the creation of God i' like to
[27:50] read that if you don't mind page 336
[27:52] paragraph 4 he says he calls himself the
[27:55] author of the creation of God he says
[27:58] this is another creation this is another
[28:02] creation this has to do with the church
[28:05] this is a special designation of himself
[28:08] he's the creator of the church the
[28:11] Heavenly bridegroom created his own
[28:15] bride what a time to be living friends
[28:19] it's a it it's good to be in the hands
[28:21] of the Lord tonight and there's no
[28:23] better place to be he says I will build
[28:25] my church and nothing's going to stop me
[28:28] I will have she will be this way and
[28:30] that way she'll be absolutely this way
[28:33] and I'm going to do
[28:35] it Hallelujah no wonder the prophet said
[28:39] God never changes his mind about his
[28:41] word and he has thoughts concerning you
[28:44] and I and he hasn't changed his mind you
[28:46] know the devil wants you to doubt that
[28:48] the devil wants you to to he wants to
[28:49] whisper in your ear and say yeah you
[28:51] know you knew that you were one of his
[28:53] children at one time but you know maybe
[28:55] you weren't maybe God's changed his mind
[28:57] well why don't you let God tell you that
[28:59] he ain't said it I won't show me chapter
[29:01] verse line where he said it and I'll
[29:03] quote that that's the devil talking to
[29:05] you friends you don't serve a
[29:07] wishy-washy God you don't serve a
[29:09] temperamental God you don't serve a God
[29:12] that that Welches on his promise he said
[29:14] he's going to do it he told you what
[29:16] your end is walk in it tonight confess
[29:19] it rest in
[29:22] it oh
[29:24] Hallelujah listen to this Israel and the
[29:27] church paragraph 178 let me tell you
[29:29] something brother listen to this and I
[29:31] say this with respect Hallelujah all
[29:34] hell can't stop it it's ordained of
[29:37] Jesus Christ to be so and it will be for
[29:40] Upon This Rock I will build my church
[29:43] and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[29:45] against it how what is it what kind of a
[29:48] church flesh and blood has not revealed
[29:50] it to thee Peter but my Father which is
[29:52] in heaven has revealed it to you
[29:54] spiritual Revelation by the Holy Ghost
[29:57] of the the word of God on this rock I'll
[30:00] build my church and the gates of hell
[30:02] can't Prevail against it he says she's
[30:04] moving on how many believes that
[30:07] tonight there is a bride today friends
[30:10] she is moving on and she can't be
[30:14] stopped the devil's in a big Panic right
[30:16] now he's trying to obscure from you who
[30:19] you really are he's trying to whisper
[30:22] all kinds of things to you but friends
[30:23] he's a loser he's lost yes the word is
[30:26] marching on Amen
[30:29] she cannot be stopped because she's not
[30:31] moving on her own and it's not by a
[30:34] bishop or an organization but it's by my
[30:37] spirit sayeth the Lord how many believes
[30:40] that she's moving in the power of God as
[30:43] he is performing his word concerning her
[30:46] and she cannot be stopped because he's
[30:49] in control yes nobody's going to stop
[30:52] him friends so I think about Daniel when
[30:55] he stood and he watched the uh or excuse
[30:57] me not Daniel was David David stood and
[30:59] he watched the Philistines that were
[31:01] gathering together uh and there were
[31:03] Garrison in the valley down below him
[31:05] and you know David did not immediately
[31:08] run down into the battle but instead he
[31:11] sought the Lord for leadership he saw
[31:14] what was being arrayed against them and
[31:16] he could have went and just you know
[31:17] jumped right into it but he said no let
[31:19] me seek the Lord in other words friends
[31:21] you see the circumstances in your life
[31:23] and and the Temptation is just to jump
[31:25] right in there and do something about it
[31:27] well why don't we wait for some
[31:28] leadership first because it's not our
[31:32] battle so David knew that the battle was
[31:35] the Lords so he inquired of the Lord and
[31:39] you won't be popular if you do that
[31:40] you're going to have everybody in their
[31:42] brother trying to tell you what to do
[31:44] you just wait on the Lord amen so he
[31:47] inquired of God and God told him hold
[31:49] your peace for right now now friends God
[31:52] will tell you things like this and it
[31:53] won't make sense to your natural mind
[31:55] and it certainly won't make sense to
[31:56] everybody else but if God tells you that
[31:59] that's what you need to
[32:00] do so he said he said hold your peace
[32:03] for now David but when you see the wind
[32:06] blowing in the bushes behind you then
[32:08] you know at that time it's time to go to
[32:11] battle so think of this now brothers and
[32:13] sisters David had his own thoughts that
[32:15] he had to battle first about what he
[32:18] should do or shouldn't do and then he
[32:20] had great generals and I mean these are
[32:22] real generals real Warriors around him
[32:25] great men that were trained in the ways
[32:27] of War and they had thoughts on the
[32:29] situation you know you better get them
[32:31] now it looks like they're building up
[32:32] and here's the way you ought to do it
[32:34] maybe you ought to come around behind
[32:35] them and what are you waiting for David
[32:38] right so David turns his back on his
[32:41] problems David turns his back on the
[32:44] enemy he turns his back on the
[32:46] circumstances and instead he's looking
[32:48] for the moving of the
[32:51] wind he's not looking at the
[32:54] circumstances but he's looking for the
[32:56] win because he knows when the wind blows
[32:59] in the bushes the angel of God is going
[33:02] to be in that
[33:03] wind so he's not looking at the problem
[33:07] but he's looking instead for the problem
[33:09] solver to show up on the
[33:13] scene imagine the army that he that that
[33:17] David had and and what they were
[33:18] discussing concerning the situation you
[33:21] know everybody's got an opinion is't
[33:23] that right you know we got what we call
[33:25] armchair quarterbacks or Monday night
[33:27] quar qubs right you know if you've never
[33:30] watched a football game and I I you know
[33:32] I admit it I've watched I wasted time
[33:34] watching a few of them and uh you know
[33:36] they're carrying a piece of leather from
[33:38] one side to the other somebody's going
[33:39] to win somebody's going to lose
[33:41] somebody's going to get beer spilled on
[33:42] their shoes you know just it's just I
[33:46] ain't saying nothing about it one way or
[33:47] another but you know it's not further me
[33:49] in the Kingdom that's all so uh uh uh
[33:53] you know you you look at that
[33:56] and so what what we call a Monday night
[33:58] quarterback is a guy that's watching the
[34:01] quarterback that's under pressure and
[34:03] this quarterback he he sees he he makes
[34:06] a play he tells the team what the play
[34:08] is going to be and then the ball comes
[34:09] and he looks out and he sees these great
[34:11] big you know 300 PB gorillas coming at
[34:13] him and you know just about to crush him
[34:15] and he throws the ball and it goes over
[34:17] to the sidelines and you and excuse me
[34:19] not you the the armchair of quarterback
[34:22] what an idiot what did he do that for
[34:24] well yeah he meant to be an idiot that's
[34:26] why he did it well I would have why
[34:28] didn't he do this and why didn't he do
[34:30] that well anybody can call the shots
[34:31] when you're not under pressure when
[34:33] you're not down there in the In the Heat
[34:35] of the battle you know in hindsight's
[34:38] 2020 you got perfect vision when you
[34:40] look into the past you know well I would
[34:43] have done this and I would have done
[34:44] that oh really so when when were you a
[34:46] quarterback
[34:48] and you know you're going to have to
[34:50] lose that belly first and put that
[34:51] popcorn away and you know can you even
[34:53] get off the couch anyway everybody's got
[34:57] an opinion but you don't you don't need
[35:00] everybody's opinion you need the Lord
[35:02] has an expected end for you it's his
[35:05] battle what you need is to wait on him
[35:07] is that
[35:09] right Hallelujah so I want you to know
[35:12] today friends David wasn't looking to
[35:15] his enemy for his time piece but he was
[35:19] looking for the move of God I want you
[35:22] to know tonight that the bride is not
[35:24] looking at her enemy today but she's
[35:27] looking to the move of God and she is
[35:30] assured that the angel of God is in the
[35:33] camp amen
[35:35] hallelujah there's there's Darkness all
[35:38] around us there's circumstances all
[35:40] around us there's trouble on every
[35:42] side but we've got spiritual Revelation
[35:45] that we can stand on that is a solid
[35:47] rock we don't need to move we don't need
[35:50] to back up we don't need to tremble
[35:52] sometimes we need to just
[35:54] stand so we're not looking at things uh
[35:57] uh from a ground view in this age but
[36:00] we've been given an eagle anointing it
[36:02] wasn't just on the prophet but it's on
[36:03] the age an eagle anointing that can lift
[36:06] us up and the eye of the eagle shows us
[36:10] things and he places it in a in a Clift
[36:13] of the Rock Amen we can see what was
[36:16] what is and what is to come amen
[36:18] hallelujah we have a secret place
[36:21] tonight that he's hidden Us in that no
[36:23] devil can Prevail against us you realize
[36:26] that you know we quoted we we quoted uh
[36:28] uh Psalm 27 here this morning in the
[36:30] time of trouble he shall hide me in his
[36:32] Pavilion in a secret place right he
[36:34] shall Place me upon a Rock
[36:37] Amen that place that he's placed you in
[36:40] is right here amen you you you die out
[36:44] get born again now you're in him and
[36:47] he's in you and the devil can't find you
[36:51] amen the only way he could find you
[36:53] would be to get the Holy Ghost not much
[36:55] chance of that happening but if he did
[36:57] he wouldn't be a threat to me I wouldn't
[37:00] have to he can't go where I went he
[37:03] can't find me because I'm hidden away in
[37:06] Christ you believe that tonight
[37:10] Hallelujah Blessed Be The Wonderful Name
[37:13] Of The Lord so the world tonight friends
[37:14] is Shifting Sands but this bride's not
[37:17] moving with the world the prophet said
[37:20] there is a faith that moves this bride
[37:22] and it's the very Faith Of God that
[37:24] moves her there's a bride who's turned
[37:28] her back to the world and she's looking
[37:30] to the mulberry bush tonight friends we
[37:32] are waiting for God to orchestrate the
[37:35] battle and we've seen the wind in the
[37:37] mulberry bush and we are entering into
[37:39] the
[37:41] battle now now you say well brother
[37:43] Baker why would we fight now well
[37:45] because now's the time that the bride

[38:10] it you can't lose amen thank you Lord
[38:15] hallelujah if there was ever a time you

[38:19] there was ever a time to chase a spirit
[38:21] out of your life it's now we've been
[38:24] we've seen an angel moving in the mberry

[38:50] friends when the prophet died in 1965
[38:53] God didn't

[38:57] then snatch it
[38:58] away he's
[39:00] here yes he is yes I'm going to meet him

[39:08] air but he's here if he's not here ask
[39:12] me what is it that I'm uniting with
[39:14] hallu how's the marriage of the Lamb
[39:17] taking place if the lamb isn't here
[39:19] amen we're in a
[39:21] union a spiritual union in this hour
[39:25] there's a natural Union that's coming
[39:27] blessed be his wonderful name so there
[39:29] was a time for Moses to fight there was
[39:32] a time and he fought there was a time
[39:34] for Joshua to fight and he fought now
[39:37] there's a time for you to fight amen and
[39:40] now is that time you believe that amen I
[39:43] can tell you know every every young
[39:45] person in this
[39:46] building God has already
[39:49] declared every everyone that's born
[39:51] again of the spirit of God he's already
[39:53] declared you're going to
[39:56] Prevail that is you're expected in you
[39:59] will
[40:00] prevail every Power every Spirit you are
[40:03] going to Prevail amen Isaiah
[40:08] 55:8 for my thoughts are not your
[40:10] thoughts neither are your ways my ways
[40:14] sayeth the Lord for as Heavens are
[40:16] higher than the earth so are my ways
[40:19] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[40:21] than your thoughts now friends when we
[40:23] read these scriptures God's not putting
[40:25] you down God never wants to to put you
[40:28] down but God wants you to know that
[40:30] there are ways that are higher than your
[40:33] natural thinking and I got news for you
[40:35] tonight I'm glad yes sir I'm glad that
[40:38] there's higher ways than the way I was
[40:40] born to think because if all there was
[40:43] if there was nothing higher than what I
[40:45] had I'm discouraged I'm
[40:49] defeated I'm
[40:50] deluded there's no reason to go on but
[40:54] there are thoughts that are higher there
[40:57] are ways that are higher than our
[40:59] natural thinking and that's that's what
[41:01] it will take to take this bride into the
[41:04] higher realm of thinking when she sees
[41:08] his thoughts on the matter versus our
[41:11] thoughts every ever you know have you
[41:14] ever had somebody that was maybe your
[41:15] friend until maybe somebody else comes
[41:18] along and that thinks badly of you and
[41:20] then maybe changes their mind about you
[41:23] listen close friends the devil can't
[41:26] change God's mind about you he can't do
[41:29] it he's not one of them kind of friends
[41:31] that's waiting for somebody else to come
[41:32] along and and change his thinking God is
[41:35] already sealed in his thought concerning
[41:38] you Hallelujah so I want you to see
[41:42] tonight friends that there is a higher
[41:44] thought concerning you am the devil
[41:47] doesn't have the last word God
[41:49] does think about it this is a tremendous
[41:53] thought you see if there was no higher
[41:56] thought concern concerning you then
[41:58] you'd have to stay the way you are is
[42:01] that right and look at the places that
[42:03] your thoughts have carried you you know
[42:07] I want you to know that the word has
[42:09] never once placed you in
[42:12] depression don't blame that on God the
[42:15] word has never said you know it's time
[42:16] for you to be depressed I want you to go
[42:18] through this you know I I I I just you
[42:20] know you deserve this I want to put you
[42:23] you won't find
[42:24] depression in the word the word has
[42:27] never spoken evil of you God has never
[42:30] spoken evil of his children
[42:32] ever God never cursed Adam Adam didn't
[42:36] cease to be his son he was still a Son
[42:38] of
[42:40] God so you are the ones that say I can't
[42:44] live it God never said that you know I I
[42:46] have different ones in the church I'll
[42:48] come up for prayer you know and after
[42:50] after the um time and friends don't get
[42:52] me wrong I'm compassionate I care about
[42:54] them and all that but after the tin time
[42:56] of them coming up and saying brother
[42:58] Baker why can't I get the Holy Ghost I
[43:01] just look at him and say that's a
[43:02] rhetorical question in other words
[43:04] you're asking a question that you're
[43:06] answering yourself I didn't say you
[43:08] couldn't why are you asking me why you
[43:10] can't I didn't say you couldn't God
[43:13] didn't say you couldn't you just did why
[43:16] can't I get rid of the can't the word
[43:19] says you can why can't I be healed the
[43:22] word says you can why can't I be
[43:24] delivered the word says you can why
[43:26] can't I live right the word says you
[43:28] can we need to get rid of the
[43:32] can't Hallelujah God never told you that
[43:37] so whose thought is it then and why do
[43:39] we want to dwell on negative thoughts
[43:42] you're the one that says it's too
[43:45] hard man looks at the at the at the body
[43:48] and he says well you know this is
[43:50] happening because you know this person
[43:52] isn't right or that person or this is
[43:54] you know news flash friends the body
[43:57] will always have some in it that aren't
[43:59] doing right amen but the thought then
[44:02] comes in uh well God can't move on my
[44:04] heart because of what somebody else is
[44:06] doing God can move on your heart friends
[44:09] he's not limited by what somebody else
[44:10] is doing God is so much bigger than any
[44:13] circumstance any situation God can do
[44:16] anything amen this is the wickedest age
[44:20] this is the darkest age but Jesus said I
[44:23] will be with you even in you until the
[44:26] end of the world World friends he's
[44:28] already come in that sense and who's
[44:30] going to stop
[44:34] him you know can I can I just stop here
[44:36] for I don't want to get off the notes
[44:37] can I just stop here for a moment in the
[44:39] first Exodus the Lord said you know uh
[44:42] Moses you know first first Moses tries
[44:45] to he's he's raised thinking he's a
[44:47] deliverer he's told he's a deliverer mom
[44:48] and dad he's got an intellectual
[44:50] conception and he ends up with one dead
[44:53] Egyptian and that's it he doesn't
[44:55] deliver the people then he goes away and
[44:57] he's all discouraged and he spends some
[44:59] time on the back side of the desert well
[45:00] I thought this and I thought that and
[45:02] God finally gets him down into a
[45:04] condition where uh you know Moses
[45:06] thinking is about all done it's all come
[45:08] to an end and Moses knows he can't do it
[45:10] so God speaks to him in a burning bush
[45:13] and he says Moses I've heard the Cry of
[45:14] my people and Moses is like
[45:16] Hallelujah finally praise your wonderful
[45:19] name oh my we're going to see a move of
[45:21] God now Hallelujah and Moses I have come
[45:25] down myself I this is not an amateur job
[45:29] I didn't send some lesser angel I'm
[45:30] going to do this I've come down myself
[45:34] and so Moses looks over he grabs his
[45:36] little towel he wipes his forehead he
[45:38] says man for a moment I thought you were
[45:40] going to ask me to do
[45:42] something and he looks at him now hold
[45:44] on there Moses I'm coming but I'm going
[45:47] to use
[45:48] you but the Lord himself is descending
[45:52] with a shout the Lord himself the mighty
[45:55] Covenant Angel the angel of his own
[45:57] Covenant he didn't leave it to somebody
[45:59] else the Lord himself has come down in
[46:02] this Exodus to do what nobody else can
[46:05] do but he needs a body tonight how many
[46:07] believes
[46:09] that
[46:12] Hallelujah so in that sense we're
[46:15] speaking about his coming but we're not
[46:16] doing
[46:17] away we just we're not going off on a
[46:20] deep end or some kind of fanaticism
[46:22] friends I'm waiting that's the hope of
[46:23] all the ages the meeting in the air the
[46:26] dead in Christ right we're looking for
[46:27] that it's a real thing it's going to
[46:30] happen
[46:34] Hallelujah sometimes our own thinking
[46:36] will put us into places that we can't
[46:38] get out
[46:39] of situations our
[46:42] past unless something breaks that we'll
[46:45] always be in that
[46:46] box you know they use terminology like
[46:49] this in Industry they say well we need
[46:51] to think outside the
[46:53] box what does that mean to think outside
[46:55] the box that means to you know get out
[46:57] of the box you can't think outside of
[47:00] the box until you get out of the box and
[47:02] what's outside of the box it ain't your
[47:05] thinking because if your thoughts are
[47:08] outside the box then you're not thinking
[47:10] outside the box right you had to get
[47:13] outside the box and think thoughts that
[47:15] you don't think you know because here's
[47:17] the box I can't why because there's a
[47:20] wall there I can't why because there's a
[47:22] roof there I can't because there's
[47:23] another wall I can't because there's a
[47:25] floor here's my Universe it's all
[47:28] defined this is it I can't the last time
[47:31] I did there was a wall the last time I
[47:33] did there was a wall the last time the
[47:35] last time the last time the last you
[47:37] need to get out of that
[47:39] box you need to quit thinking your own
[47:42] thoughts you need to come up higher let
[47:44] the eag lift you up on an eagle
[47:46] anointing and you need to think and see
[47:48] things from God's perspective you know
[47:51] you get depressed you get discouraged
[47:53] you're down there uh uh slaving away and
[47:55] you know out west we got some big
[47:57] mountains and I I've always been kind of
[47:58] a mountain person it's just the way God
[48:00] made me and I lived up in Montana and
[48:02] different places and it's not just
[48:04] because I live there because other parts
[48:05] of my family they're not they could care
[48:08] less about a mountain okay so another
[48:09] dumb Mountain but when I see that I want
[48:11] to be up there there just something in
[48:12] me so I want to get on top of the
[48:14] mountain so you're down there and you
[48:16] got all these problems and this problem
[48:17] and that problem and then you go up and
[48:19] there's a place that I go in the
[48:21] Catalina mountains on Mondays a lot of
[48:23] times when I want to go crawl under a
[48:25] rock somewhere that anointing leaves you
[48:27] and you're just strained and did I say
[48:29] this and that and you know second
[48:31] guessing and Monday night quarterbacking
[48:33] yourself and right so I go up on the top
[48:36] of this mountain I'm at 9,200 ft and I
[48:38] sit on these rocks that are a couple
[48:40] hundred feet tall and I hear eagles
[48:41] flying around and there ain't nobody up
[48:43] there but me and him and I look down and
[48:47] and I think okay my problem's down there
[48:49] somewhere I can't even see it it is so
[48:52] small you know everybody's down there
[48:55] this is important that's important this
[48:57] is important a bunch of ants that's what
[48:59] it looks like you're just a bunch of
[49:00] ants scrawling around and nobody's
[49:02] getting anywhere and yet they think I'm
[49:04] getting ahead in life and if I could
[49:05] only overcome this problem it's you look
[49:07] down there and it's a different
[49:08] perspective you think what I'm worried
[49:10] about that you know I'm looking at the
[49:13] wrong thing you know and the Lord knows
[49:16] that so he lifts us up in that anointing
[49:18] in this age in that eagle age he lifts
[49:21] us up to where we're not seeing all the
[49:23] smoke that's uh that's permeating every
[49:26] crack Corner amen when the lid was
[49:28] lifted off of the of the bottomless pit
[49:31] in Revelation chapter 9 by this angel
[49:33] that was kicked out and the lid opens up
[49:35] and hell is spilling into this Dimension
[49:38] and people can't see they need some
[49:40] Malachi for IAP they got they got a
[49:43] vision problem they're nearsighted and
[49:45] there smoke is everywhere but God has a
[49:48] cure for it in this age and that cure is
[49:50] to lift you up On Eagle's Wings to lift
[49:52] you up above the smoke and to give you
[49:55] some of that Malachi for ice have so
[49:57] that when you get up there you can
[49:59] see and when you get up there you
[50:01] realize what am I worried about this is
[50:04] all out of my control he's got it all in
[50:09] control than you Lord but we get trapped
[50:12] by our thinking is anybody listening
[50:14] tonight we get trapped by our own
[50:17] Thinking by our we limit God by by our
[50:21] by our past and our
[50:24] experiences well there's no use in me
[50:26] trying to be Afra to that person because
[50:27] the last time I was a friend to somebody
[50:29] they screwed me over well you can't that
[50:32] person doesn't represent everybody
[50:34] there's a true friend out there Amen in
[50:36] fact your best friend is him and he'll
[50:38] never leave you amen amen thank you Lord
[50:42] blessed be his wonderful
[50:43] name so we got a break out of that box
[50:47] and I'm so glad tonight Friends by the
[50:49] baptism of the holy spirit that my heart
[50:51] can be searched my mind can be cleansed
[50:54] my conscience and my unconscience

[51:11] of the water of the word so you're being
[51:13] washed you're being scrubbed you know in
[51:16] places that you can't reach amen a brush
[51:20] is going down and scouring you in places

[51:25] habits from your past there's things in
[51:27] your subconscious there's things from

[51:59] up job had all these
[52:02] counselors and every one of them tried
[52:06] to bring his circumstances back to a
[52:08] secret sin you know when the Lord put it
[52:12] on our heart to to start a work and we
[52:14] and we started doing it I I got a a case

[52:44] something wrong is that what you're
[52:45] telling me when he when he was so wore
[52:47] out and he went down into the bottom of
[52:49] that ship it's because he grieve God
[52:52] somehow no it's because he was in the
[52:54] line of duty don't let C circumstances
[52:57] Define you tonight friends don't let
[52:59] don't let the devil take your
[53:00] circumstances the things that you're

[53:11] react to those circumstances shows what
[53:13] you
[53:14] are praise His wonderful name so job had

[53:20] them tried to bring his circumstances
[53:22] back to a secret sin and they're all
[53:25] trying to to to pull this out you know
[53:28] you had to do you had to do something
[53:30] you missed God somewhere right but you
[53:32] see if there could have been sin found
[53:35] in his life that caused his dilemma then
[53:38] he would actually deserve what was
[53:40] happening to him and there would be no
[53:42] way to get out of it but watch what
[53:44] happens when job comes to the lowest
[53:46] place in his life he's sitting on an ash
[53:50] Heap he's scraping his sores and his
[53:53] wife is telling him why don't you just
[53:55] renounce and curse God and then die
[53:58] there's no point in going on there's no
[54:00] hope so he's in the lowest Valley of his
[54:03] entire life everything's been taken away
[54:06] from him everything's been stripped from
[54:08] he's lost his health he's lost his
[54:09] family he's lost his Fellowship he's
[54:11] lost his position in the church he's
[54:14] lost his cattle of a Thousand Hills he's
[54:16] lost everything friends anybody there
[54:20] tonight somebody say praise the Lord
[54:22] praise the Lord I don't think any of us
[54:24] has been that low yet I I'm ventur I'm
[54:27] stepping out here now but no
[54:31] okay but
[54:33] notice he's sitting there not as a
[54:37] secret
[54:39] sinner he's sitting on an ash Heep and
[54:42] the ash Heep is the remains of his burnt
[54:45] offering it's the remains of his
[54:47] sacrifice so he knows he knows I've met
[54:51] God's requirements I have repented I
[54:54] have been baptized according my heart
[54:56] has been turned amen he knows that he's
[55:00] met the requirements of God and he's
[55:01] sitting on the only evidence that he has
[55:04] which is the remains of his sacrifice
[55:06] the burnt offering that's all he's got
[55:08] his ashes he has no idea why he's go
[55:12] somebody listen to me tonight he has no
[55:15] idea why he's going through what he's
[55:17] going through God's not going to tell
[55:18] you everything if he did it wouldn't be
[55:20] a faith walk if he told you everything
[55:22] okay that's reasonable okay I understand
[55:24] that it don't matter if you understand
[55:25] it or not but do you believe amen so he
[55:28] had no idea why he was going through
[55:31] what he was going through but it is not
[55:34] sin and he was not going to move amen no
[55:38] matter what anybody said brother Ram
[55:41] said if you think God's putting putting
[55:44] it putting it on you then the devil has
[55:46] a right to stay there but if you can see
[55:49] that it is the devil then you have a
[55:51] right to push back God ain't putting it
[55:54] on you friends if you think it's God
[55:56] then you'll sit back and say well must
[55:58] Jesus bear the cross alone and you'll go
[56:00] around with long hair long face long
[56:03] dress long tongue and long this and long
[56:06] that amen but if you know if you know
[56:10] that God ain't going to put nothing on
[56:12] you he'll allow the devil is that right
[56:15] God's not friends God ain't going to put
[56:17] a a curse on you he's not going to put
[56:20] sickness on you how many knows that's
[56:23] true so if you think it's God you'll sit
[56:25] back well you know I guess God don't
[56:27] want to heal me he just wants me to you
[56:29] know for his glory well how how exactly
[56:31] is he getting Glory out of whatever
[56:33] you're going through come on Friends
[56:34] amen so job's sitting there and a
[56:37] whirlwind comes down and God was veiled
[56:41] in that Whirlwind and when job couldn't
[56:43] go where God was then God came down to
[56:46] where job was that's the god you serve
[56:48] tonight friends I don't care how low you
[56:51] get God can come down to that level I
[56:54] don't know where you were at in your
[56:56] life life but I do know that God had to
[56:58] come down in the Blackness of my life it
[57:01] had come down in the depths of my life
[57:03] of depression and discouragement he had
[57:05] to he had to take away my own thinking
[57:07] he had to take away my own ideas my own
[57:10] Impressions what I thought he thought
[57:12] about me what I thought others thought
[57:14] about me he had to show me that Ain it
[57:16] at all I need to change your thinking I
[57:20] need you to see the thoughts that I
[57:21] think about you glory to God

[1:00:15] world who hath laid the measures thereof
[1:00:18] if you know or who has stretched the
[1:00:21] line upon it whereupon are the
[1:00:25] foundations thereof fastened or who hath
[1:00:28] laid the Cornerstone thereof when the
[1:00:31] morning Stars sang together and all the
[1:00:34] sons of God shouted for Joy think about
[1:00:37] that friends you realize the very first
[1:00:40] Pentecostal meeting you know Pentecost
[1:00:43] has become a bad word if that makes you
[1:00:44] nervous tonight get over it amen we're
[1:00:47] not we're not denominational Pentecost
[1:00:49] we're not chasing after signs signs are
[1:00:52] following after you according to the
[1:00:54] word but there is a real
[1:00:56] this is a Living Word we're not here to
[1:00:59] discuss ideas this is Living Word the
[1:01:02] word is going forth and it's alive it's
[1:01:04] a person and you got to meet that person
[1:01:07] I don't care how it happens you know you
[1:01:09] might nod real
[1:01:11] loud it don't matter you might cry it
[1:01:14] just depends on who you are but but you
[1:01:17] got to meet God you've got it the
[1:01:19] revelation of Jesus Christ has to be
[1:01:21] revealed to you personally that you are
[1:01:24] his son and then then your spirit B will
[1:01:27] bear witness with his spirit that you're
[1:01:29] a son or daughter of God Amen I don't
[1:01:32] care how it happens it's just got to
[1:01:34] happen you got to meet him you got to
[1:01:36] meet that Pillar of Fire yourself every
[1:01:39] one of us has got to have a personal
[1:01:41] experience with him so the prophet of
[1:01:44] God he's in his very first Pentecostal
[1:01:46] meeting we know the story and I don't
[1:01:47] have time and I don't want to take the
[1:01:49] time but you know your pastor taught it
[1:01:50] to you you've read about it you know
[1:01:52] about it and he's in the in mishak uh
[1:01:55] and uh uh you know he's sitting in the
[1:01:57] back of the church and trying not to be
[1:01:58] noticed and all that and and uh he says
[1:02:01] that this black brother gets up there to
[1:02:03] preach and he's about 80 years old or
[1:02:05] something like that and and he said his
[1:02:07] hair was was white all around you know
[1:02:09] missing on the top kind of rimmed with
[1:02:12] white and you know he's just being
[1:02:14] honest I just love the way our Prophet
[1:02:15] just spoke what he was thinking and you
[1:02:18] know repented of it when he needed to
[1:02:19] and but he's looking and he's thinking
[1:02:22] you know all these young fellas over
[1:02:23] here and that old fossil is getting up
[1:02:25] there you know
[1:02:26] they're having to help him up there on
[1:02:27] the platform you know you know here
[1:02:29] let's get this guy up here watch your
[1:02:31] step
[1:02:34] now right they get him up there and he's
[1:02:36] say you know you know I I've heard
[1:02:39] stories about these Pentecostals and all
[1:02:40] that been kind of I'm sitting in the
[1:02:42] back in case things get squirely here I
[1:02:44] want to make a quick getaway I've heard
[1:02:46] stories about it you know so this guy
[1:02:48] gets up here right and he begins to take
[1:02:50] his text and he takes that text where
[1:02:52] were you where were you and he said
[1:02:55] about that time the spirit of God struck
[1:02:56] him he jumped up in the air kicked his
[1:02:58] heels and he said there was a great big
[1:03:00] platform there but he says you ain't got
[1:03:02] enough room up here he said he would
[1:03:04] went running around on the platform he
[1:03:05] says you don't have enough room up here
[1:03:07] for me to preach let that anointing
[1:03:09] strike you it'll do something for you
[1:03:11] it'll make these Dry Bones prophesy once
[1:03:13] again it'll put life on these
[1:03:17] bones so now think about it he's in his
[1:03:19] very first Pentecostal meeting right now
[1:03:23] here here's here's what I want you to
[1:03:24] take away from this the question is
[1:03:26] where were you it's the very question
[1:03:29] that God's asking job where were you now
[1:03:32] friends if you can figure out where you
[1:03:34] were then you'll know who you were so
[1:03:37] that's really the question who are you
[1:03:40] amen who are you right and he's told
[1:03:43] here where were you when the morning
[1:03:45] Stars sang together and all the sons
[1:03:48] shouted for Joy Hallelujah so here's
[1:03:50] your Prophet the prophet of this age and
[1:03:52] he's a morning staru and he's in his
[1:03:55] very first Pentecostal meeting and he's
[1:03:58] finding out who he is amen is that right
[1:04:02] how about the rest of us tonight am do
[1:04:05] you realize that yes do you realize I'm
[1:04:08] looking at some morning Stars here you
[1:04:11] know what a morning star is you know I I
[1:04:13] I'm a I hate to even use the word I was
[1:04:16] going to say I'm a Hunter I'm a want to
[1:04:17] be Hunter I I just like to get out in
[1:04:19] nature I've been that way my whole life
[1:04:21] I like to get out I don't do it because
[1:04:22] brother brandom did it and I don't go
[1:04:24] around with the eagle belt buckle if you
[1:04:25] do that's fine I'm not being critical
[1:04:27] but I I'm not trying to be something I'm
[1:04:29] just being what I am I love to get out
[1:04:31] in nature I I God made me in a certain
[1:04:34] way that I'm sensitive to spirits and I
[1:04:36] need to get away from them and then when
[1:04:38] I get out then I got to get away with
[1:04:39] the from the spirits I brought with
[1:04:42] me but I just love to get out and so you
[1:04:45] know we we have this beautiful animal uh
[1:04:47] back West called an elk and it's just a
[1:04:49] gorgeous animal it's actually in the
[1:04:51] Bine family it's a you know it's
[1:04:53] actually related to a cow and the meat
[1:04:56] is just tremendous you say oh I don't I
[1:04:58] don't like gy meat it ain't gy I if I
[1:05:01] prepared it for you you wouldn't even
[1:05:02] know you would think you're eating a
[1:05:03] really good cut of beef and so we'll
[1:05:06] hunt that and we'll uh it'll get us
[1:05:08] through all fall winter and spring you
[1:05:11] know feed the family there's a lot of
[1:05:12] meat that comes from that and and really
[1:05:15] it isn't about that so much it's it's
[1:05:17] just an opportunity for me to get out
[1:05:18] and spend some time with the Lord and
[1:05:20] walk with
[1:05:22] him uh but there's there's something
[1:05:24] that takes place see in order to be
[1:05:26] successful you either got to catch them
[1:05:28] early in the morning just at first light
[1:05:30] or late in the evening at the last Light
[1:05:32] because there's there they're like
[1:05:34] ghosts they're hard to hunt they're
[1:05:35] harder to hunt than deer and a great big
[1:05:37] animal like that can be gone just like
[1:05:39] that and uh they got Keen eyesight you
[1:05:43] know if there's a herd there's all these
[1:05:45] thousands of eyeballs or hundreds I
[1:05:47] guess looking all it takes is one set
[1:05:50] eyes to catch you or one nostril to
[1:05:52] smell you so so you it's either late in
[1:05:56] the or early in the morning or late in
[1:05:57] the evening so so you get out in these
[1:05:59] places in the dark and it's in October
[1:06:02] or November it's cold in northern
[1:06:03] Arizona like it is here probably right
[1:06:06] so you're out there and it's you know
[1:06:07] it's below freezing and uh you're
[1:06:11] walking around the dark and you you find
[1:06:13] a place where you you figure that you're
[1:06:14] going to sit and wait hope something
[1:06:16] comes your way you know you've done your
[1:06:18] scouting you hope something comes your
[1:06:19] way but there's something about just
[1:06:23] before uh just before the the coming of
[1:06:26] the sun it actually gets darker I I you
[1:06:29] know darkness and brother Brown said
[1:06:30] darkness is pressing because the light's
[1:06:32] coming and the light is pressing against
[1:06:34] the darkness and somehow that darkness
[1:06:37] is compressing and it just gets dark I
[1:06:40] mean dark and the temperature drops it
[1:06:43] does it it'll drop you'll be shivering
[1:06:46] you're thinking oh man I I really want
[1:06:48] something to come but in one sense I
[1:06:50] don't if it comes right now because I'm
[1:06:51] shaking so much I'm going to miss you
[1:06:53] know uh the temperature just drops and
[1:06:56] you're cold and and and it's just it's
[1:06:59] so quiet but then something very strange
[1:07:02] happens the the the the lights you can
[1:07:05] just see over over the horizon where the
[1:07:08] light is just beginning to come but just
[1:07:10] before that you see stars that you you
[1:07:13] don't see any other time except just
[1:07:16] before the sun rises you didn't even
[1:07:19] know they were there but they weren't
[1:07:21] supposed to shine until the evening time
[1:07:24] until just before the break of day their
[1:07:27] place they're called morning stars
[1:07:30] because they're there and the Very fact
[1:07:32] that you can see those Stars what that's
[1:07:34] telling you is Here Comes the Sun
[1:07:36] they're heralding in the coming of the
[1:07:39] sun they're heralding in the coming of
[1:07:42] the Lord so the very fact that you see
[1:07:44] these stars on the horizon and you see
[1:07:47] them shining you know Here Comes the Sun
[1:07:50] you know it is the rising of the sun
[1:07:52] things are beginning to change so you
[1:07:54] begin to there's something that stirs in
[1:07:56] you I can't explain it but when you're
[1:07:58] sitting out there I've cried I've
[1:08:00] actually cried like a baby when I've
[1:08:02] seen that because you could see the plan
[1:08:04] of God you can see the Bible being lived
[1:08:06] out right before you friends we've got
[1:08:08] morning stars that are shining right now
[1:08:11] that are standing on the earth and we're
[1:08:13] reflecting that light of that sun that's
[1:08:16] coming up that and and the fact that we
[1:08:18] can be seen is telling the whole world
[1:08:20] it's announcing the coming of the lord
[1:08:23] it's announcing he's coming he's coming
[1:08:26] get ready here comes the son here comes
[1:08:28] the son here comes the son
[1:08:33] Hallelujah
[1:08:34] Lord blessed be his wonderful
[1:08:38] name when the morning Stars sang
[1:08:41] together and all the sons of God shouted
[1:08:43] for Joy so God is asking job he's saying
[1:08:46] when I was framing the Earth by my
[1:08:48] Divine
[1:08:49] intelligence where were
[1:08:51] you you see job was misplacing him
[1:08:55] himself and the word concerning him by
[1:08:59] listening to human
[1:09:01] counsel and it took the mind of God to
[1:09:04] come down into that Valley and raise job
[1:09:07] up into the mind of God and get him to
[1:09:09] think differently is that what we need
[1:09:12] no you know you you you come to a
[1:09:14] service and you're just so tore up and
[1:09:16] you're just you just don't even know how
[1:09:17] you're going to get along and the spirit
[1:09:19] will come and lift you up and you don't
[1:09:21] even maybe know what just got dealt with
[1:09:23] but your thinking's different and now
[1:09:25] you got hope now you can face tomorrow
[1:09:28] now you know you can get through the
[1:09:29] rest of the now you've got hope for your
[1:09:31] loved ones and amen because God changed
[1:09:35] your frame of reference he took you out
[1:09:36] of your box
[1:09:38] amen so it took the mind of God to come
[1:09:41] down in that Valley raised job up into
[1:09:43] the mind of God because job was thinking
[1:09:46] the wrong thoughts so he says to job
[1:09:49] think on this where were you when the
[1:09:51] sons of God shouted for
[1:09:53] Joy what were they shouting
[1:09:56] about brother brandham said now we
[1:09:59] weren't shouting we were in his mind we
[1:10:02] were his thoughts in his mind we didn't
[1:10:04] pre-exist like the Mormons teach amen
[1:10:07] but brother Bram said they seen it when
[1:10:10] he slayed the lamb and brought
[1:10:12] Perfection to
[1:10:13] them and friends that blood will will
[1:10:16] take you and transport you into a place
[1:10:19] where you can
[1:10:21] believe Amen in your human thinking you
[1:10:24] can't believe but that blood will take
[1:10:26] you into a rain a realm where you can
[1:10:29] believe so job is going to have to
[1:10:31] answer God and job was going to have to
[1:10:33] tell God what his point of origin was in
[1:10:37] order for God to tell him why he was
[1:10:39] where he was right
[1:10:41] then
[1:10:43] friends I believe this with all my heart
[1:10:46] until you understand why God originally
[1:10:48] made you you're not going to be able to
[1:10:51] understand why you're going through what
[1:10:53] you're going through right now he made
[1:10:56] you for a purpose Hallelujah job was a
[1:10:59] Son of God and friends you aren't just
[1:11:01] anybody you're a child of God you're a
[1:11:04] Son of God you're a daughter of God job
[1:11:06] was a Son of God and friends nothing can
[1:11:09] Ascend unless nothing can Ascend unless
[1:11:12] it first descends amen amen so God's
[1:11:16] trying to get you and I tonight to see
[1:11:18] where we came
[1:11:20] from the
[1:11:22] revelation of God as your savior
[1:11:25] eliminates Sin from your
[1:11:28] life let me say that again you're not a
[1:11:30] sinner any longer a sinner is an
[1:11:32] unbeliever you now believe in your soul
[1:11:35] you believe this guy up here he might
[1:11:37] still have some issues and problems down
[1:11:39] here The Anchor You Believe
[1:11:41] hallelujah amen so job wasn't getting
[1:11:44] skim milk here God talked to him as he
[1:11:48] as as he would a mature
[1:11:50] man job was being brought to a place
[1:11:54] where he could stay end again and
[1:11:57] Friends when the when the Revelation
[1:11:59] broke on him then he declared I know my
[1:12:03] redeemer liveth I know my redeemer
[1:12:06] liveth he recognized that his Redeemer
[1:12:09] was not man but was God Amen and then he
[1:12:13] realized that all that he lost could be
[1:12:15] restored to him once again listen
[1:12:18] brothers and sisters you never lost
[1:12:20] anything serving Christ
[1:12:22] never everything a man loses is going to
[1:12:25] be given back to him am except that
[1:12:28] which isn't good for you which you don't
[1:12:29] want back anyway the only thing he took
[1:12:31] away from you was
[1:12:33] sin everything else he he did was
[1:12:37] give oh hallelujah oh he could just go
[1:12:40] on and on we could talk about Ezekiel I
[1:12:42] told you I was going to stop I'm GNA not
[1:12:43] I'm not going to lie to you again we're
[1:12:45] going to pull
[1:12:47] over somebody say praise the
[1:12:51] Lord oh we get so wrapped up in our
[1:12:53] natural thinking we get so trapped in
[1:12:55] that box and then we get people to come
[1:12:58] along to try to confirm that kind of
[1:12:59] thinking especially people that have
[1:13:01] known you your old life you know people
[1:13:03] that are in the same box as you maybe
[1:13:04] they're raised in the same box raised in
[1:13:07] the same crib or same house or whatever
[1:13:09] and we get so wrapped up in our natural
[1:13:12] thinking that it causes us to struggle
[1:13:14] with the message of our day our human
[1:13:17] minds are so polluted we have thoughts
[1:13:20] that were hidden in the past that can be
[1:13:23] pulled up in life and and it's stored in
[1:13:26] the memory of our humanity is that right
[1:13:29] friends oh you know I realize there's
[1:13:31] angels all over the building and Halos
[1:13:32] and everywhere I do okay I'll have
[1:13:35] thoughts come up and I think man where
[1:13:36] did that come from you know I thought
[1:13:39] that was well it came from your past
[1:13:41] amen our thinking then is limited to our
[1:13:44] human experiences without God right and
[1:13:48] in our human minds adulteries are
[1:13:50] committed in our human Minds murders are
[1:13:52] committed in our human Minds lies are
[1:13:54] spoken
[1:13:55] right now how many of us tonight would
[1:13:58] like to have the last few months of your
[1:14:00] thoughts taken and put up here on the
[1:14:03] screen would you like that for everybody
[1:14:06] to see every thought that you had right
[1:14:09] I'm so glad that God has given me
[1:14:11] something tonight to hide that thought
[1:14:14] so that it can be brought under
[1:14:16] subjection to the
[1:14:18] word when we try to lead ourselves with
[1:14:21] our own thoughts our own thinking
[1:14:23] there's no way to do it without our
[1:14:26] pollution from our past no way to do it
[1:14:30] because we're in that box you got to get
[1:14:32] out of that box we need to we need to

[1:25:31] uh a condemnation here tonight Lord for
[1:25:34] we know that condemnation is not of you
[1:25:36] if we're born of your spirit there's no
[1:25:39] condemnation to those that are in Christ
[1:25:41] Jesus you're not condemning us Lord we
[1:25:43] were on death row we were condemned but
[1:25:46] you wrote pardoned over it father you
[1:25:49] took art the penalty upon yourself you
[1:25:52] did what no man could do and Lord You've
[1:25:55] freely uh uh made that available to us
[1:25:57] tonight we want to walk in it Lord we
[1:25:59] want to take full advantage help us Lord
[1:26:02] to see things from your point of view
[1:26:03] help us Lord if we're struggling with
[1:26:05] the uh I don't know Lord I don't know
[1:26:07] this body but I know that we're human
[1:26:09] beings Lord
[1:26:11] and I know that back home Lord that some
[1:26:13] of us sometimes we struggle trying to
[1:26:16] get a hold of what the message has
[1:26:17] declared about us we we think oh well
[1:26:19] that would be that would be arrogant for
[1:26:22] me to think that I'm the bride that
[1:26:23] would be you know
[1:26:24] presumptuous for me to think that I've
[1:26:26] been I'm elect or that I've been called
[1:26:28] or that I've been chosen but Lord the
[1:26:30] truth of the matter is is there's no
[1:26:31] arrogance to it at all there's a
[1:26:32] humility that comes it's quite the
[1:26:34] contrary when that Revelation truly
[1:26:36] strikes us but Lord really what it is is
[1:26:39] it's believing what you've said about us
[1:26:41] and no matter how humble that we think
[1:26:43] the other thoughts might be those other
[1:26:46] thoughts are unbelief for your word has
[1:26:48] declared already about us now it's a
[1:26:51] matter of us lining our thinking up with
[1:26:53] what you've already declared
[1:26:54] and then saying Lord let it be let that
[1:26:56] reality be my life let that be
[1:27:00] manifested in my life and let you
[1:27:02] receive all the honor and the glory
[1:27:04] father it won't cause us to live loose
[1:27:05] it won't cause us to slack up it'll just
[1:27:08] do just the opposite father when that
[1:27:10] when that your love for us breaks on us
[1:27:13] when we realize the great extent that
[1:27:15] you went for went to to to uh the price
[1:27:19] that you paid and all that you've got
[1:27:20] invested to get us to this place Lord
[1:27:23] and what we mean to you oh lord it's the
[1:27:25] most humbling thing when that love uh
[1:27:27] washes over us Lord it makes us want to
[1:27:29] love everybody it makes us want to
[1:27:31] forgive everybody father when we realize
[1:27:34] that that if we are really your
[1:27:36] Offspring never were lost of course Lord
[1:27:38] we had to come to the recognition we had
[1:27:40] to repent we understand all that Lord
[1:27:42] but looking back from the other
[1:27:43] direction now we realize you never did
[1:27:46] lose us father we are your children were
[1:27:48] The Offspring and Lord then we realize
[1:27:51] that now it's up to us to extend that
[1:27:53] Mercy and Grace to others and father if
[1:27:56] there's something in our hearts here
[1:27:57] tonight where we didn't we don't want
[1:27:58] somebody else to make it help us tonight
[1:28:01] Lord forgive us of that wash that off of
[1:28:03] us Lord father we know that really the
[1:28:06] root of that is that we we don't maybe
[1:28:08] we don't feel that we're cutting the
[1:28:09] mustard maybe we feel that maybe we're
[1:28:11] falling short and so rather than face up
[1:28:14] to that uh uh and bring that to a
[1:28:17] showdown then we look at others and we
[1:28:19] we feel that like maybe Lord I'm not
[1:28:21] speaking to the people here tonight I'm
[1:28:22] talking about human nature Lord in in
[1:28:25] religion where we'll maybe look at
[1:28:27] others and and we think if we're not
[1:28:29] making it well then they're not making
[1:28:30] it maybe we'll find fault with somebody
[1:28:33] else and somehow uh take some comfort in
[1:28:35] that but Lord when we realize you truly
[1:28:38] have made the way for us we truly are
[1:28:42] forgiven we truly are uh we truly have
[1:28:45] been washed we have been made perfect
[1:28:47] you did Grant for us to be a raid in
[1:28:49] linen pure and white which is the
[1:28:51] righteousness of the Saints you have
[1:28:53] made us perfect before you you have made
[1:28:55] us sinless spotless you have uh you've
[1:28:59] finished this work Lord You've placed us
[1:29:01] back on speaking terms you've placed us
[1:29:03] back into a position when we when that
[1:29:06] really becomes snug in our hearts Lord
[1:29:09] when we when those are our thoughts
[1:29:11] starting in the soul and then working
[1:29:13] its way through the rest of us Lord when
[1:29:15] we're thinking that way it'll cause us
[1:29:17] to want to stand in the gap for everyone
[1:29:19] we'll want to go in the byways and the
[1:29:21] highways Lord your your servant here
[1:29:22] that you've placed over this BL that's
[1:29:24] his heart he's got a servant's heart
[1:29:26] he's he wants to bring anybody in and
[1:29:28] let them come as far as they come and
[1:29:29] Lord we believe that's your desire
[1:29:31] you're not willing that any should
[1:29:32] perish we don't know how far someone can
[1:29:34] come but we want to be guilty of
[1:29:35] bringing them as far as he can we want
[1:29:37] to be guilty of reaching out extending
[1:29:40] oh God just uh we don't want anybody to
[1:29:43] miss out on this great love we don't
[1:29:45] want anybody to miss out on this this
[1:29:47] Amazing Grace father that's been
[1:29:49] provided for us here tonight father as
[1:29:51] we change the order of the service here
[1:29:53] we turn it over to the to the Pastor I
[1:29:55] pray you search our hearts Lord father
[1:29:58] we don't need to get a backro out
[1:29:59] tonight and go dig up some bones and
[1:30:03] some Far Away place I believe with all
[1:30:05] my heart Lord that if there's something
[1:30:08] that something that isn't pleasing some
[1:30:10] something that needs to be tuned in our
[1:30:12] lives something that needs to be
[1:30:13] corrected Lord you just give us that
[1:30:15] gentle Nudge by your Holy Spirit and it
[1:30:17] it convicts our hearts it Pricks our
[1:30:19] hearts your Prophet said he wanted to
[1:30:21] get to that place for the very moment
[1:30:22] that he did something wrong uh he would
[1:30:24] know it so he could say I'm sorry Lord
[1:30:26] and just continue walking on father I
[1:30:28] believe as we continue walking with you
[1:30:30] in this Enoch walk in this uh in this
[1:30:33] Grace walk this walk of perfection here
[1:30:35] in the end time I believe Lord that
[1:30:39] that's your desire is to is to prick our
[1:30:41] consciences and I thank you tonight Lord
[1:30:44] that you can still deal with my
[1:30:45] conscience don't don't let me ever uh
