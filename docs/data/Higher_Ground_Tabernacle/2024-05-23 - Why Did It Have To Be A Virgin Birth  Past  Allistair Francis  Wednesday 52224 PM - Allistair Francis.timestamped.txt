[12:50] amen amen we know our brother
[12:54] John appreciate him
[12:57] too that's one thing about the love of
[13:01] God never runs
[13:03] out you love the
[13:05] Lord amen we thank the Lord for our
[13:09] pastor from South
[13:14] Africa pastor and brother and
[13:18] friend
[13:22] francisc man who has been a dear friend
[13:25] of mine he and his
[13:28] family every since he was little
[13:30] teenager whatever it was I can't
[13:32] remember how old he was but for sure he
[13:35] didn't have the gray gray
[13:38] influence but we all have that now
[13:41] we I I'm I'm just saying I can't even
[13:44] believe that God has allowed him to
[13:47] come honored feel special and
[13:51] privileged he we talk back and forth on
[13:54] the phone at time or
[13:57] text met
[14:04] I'm not going to say
[14:06] anymore we really appreciate him
[14:09] coming and spending a little time with
[14:11] us by the grace of
[14:14] God I feel
[14:16] humbled in his
[14:18] presence even though he's a younger man
[14:21] I know that he loves the
[14:23] Lord he doesn't just preach the message
[14:26] he lives the message
[14:29] the greatest and the greatest part of it
[14:32] all so we're going to ask our brother a
[14:34] pastor to
[14:37] come he greet it greet the Church of the
[14:40] family of
[14:43] God take it whichever way he he wants
[14:48] to I don't know whether he plays and
[14:50] sings Still but I know that he can do
[14:54] that an excellent an excellent
[14:57] pianist however the Lord leads
[15:00] him amen we want him to come and have
[15:05] [Applause]
[15:11] have bless
[15:17] brother God bless you Saints
[15:30] a lot of people from my continent
[15:35] here it's a real honor and a privilege
[15:37] to be here with
[15:39] [Music]
[15:52] you like he said we we've been good
[15:56] friends for many years
[16:00] and he's not just been a
[16:04] minister but a very great influence in
[16:08] my life growing
[16:12] up so for me it's a great honor to be
[16:17] here the Lord teaches us to respect our
[16:24] elders the Bible teaches us to respect
[16:26] our elders
[16:29] our elders guide
[16:32] us and in times like
[16:35] these a lot of the elders are dying
[16:40] off it feels very
[16:44] lonely because it feels like the age is
[16:46] coming
[16:49] up when the young are going to be left
[16:55] alone and it
[16:57] becomes nervous
[17:01] time when you feel like you're being
[17:04] left
[17:06] alone so we certainly
[17:09] appreciate that we have Elders that are
[17:13] still
[17:16] around who we can depend
[17:19] on and who we can look
[17:23] to in a time where also many many Elders
[17:27] are failing us
[17:32] we need the ones who remain solid in the
[17:36] word so you are honored to have a man
[17:40] who stands with the
[17:43] gospel amen the Lord bless
[17:47] you so let's bow our heads as we
[17:53] pray dear Lord
[17:56] Jesus you are the master of Our Lives oh
[18:00] God there is none like
[18:03] you you are our God and our
[18:07] savior Our
[18:09] Redeemer the lover of our
[18:12] souls the god of Our
[18:14] Lives we love you with all our
[18:17] heart we are here because you saved
[18:21] us you washed us with your
[18:24] blood you redeemed Us by your
[18:26] word and you drew us to the great light
[18:29] in this last
[18:34] day the message of the
[18:36] hour and we appreciate it Lord we ask
[18:40] you for your presence with us this
[18:43] evening we ask you to open up your word
[18:45] to
[18:46] us because we are just
[18:49] men we don't have great
[18:53] understanding without your
[18:55] spirit we cannot understand the things
[18:58] of God
[19:00] so we depend upon
[19:02] you bless your word as we would read
[19:06] it and bless everything that would be
[19:09] said may it find an Abiding Place in the
[19:12] hearts of your
[19:16] children we ask all this now in the
[19:19] Glorious precious name of our Lord Jesus
[19:22] Christ amen amen amen if let's stand
[19:26] together as we read the word of of
[19:31] God we're going to read from Isaiah
[19:34] chapter
[19:36] 7 verse 14 to
[19:43] 15 Isaiah 7 verse4 to
[19:51] 15 amen verse 14 therefore the Lord
[19:54] himself shall give you a sign Behold a
[19:58] virgin shall conceive and bear a son and
[20:01] shall call his name
[20:13] Emmanuel butter and honey shall he eat
[20:17] that he may know to refuse the evil and
[20:20] choose the
[20:26] good for before the child shall know to
[20:30] refuse the evil and choose the good the
[20:33] land that thou abh horest shall be
[20:35] forsaken of
[20:45] Kings amen the Lord add a blessing to
[20:47] his word you may be
[20:53] seated
[20:54] amen glory to
[20:56] God so
[20:59] I know it's a Wednesday
[21:01] night I usually preach about two
[21:06] hours two and a half
[21:09] hours but I'm not going to do that
[21:12] tonight I don't want to wear you
[21:15] out I know it's a weak
[21:19] night there's work in the
[21:23] school so I'm not we're in the message
[21:30] we don't have anything
[21:32] new because it's all been
[21:36] revealed there's no man with any special
[21:38] Revelation in the
[21:41] world but the open book has brought to
[21:45] us the revelation of all
[21:49] things which
[21:51] means everything that we've had
[21:55] before just becomes new
[21:59] every time amen so I want to speak
[22:04] on why do they have to be a virgin
[22:12] birth amen amen
[22:16] so all Christians in the
[22:20] world believe in the Virgin
[22:24] birth they just believe in it because
[22:26] the Bible says so
[22:30] God does not do anything without a
[22:34] reason as sons of God in this
[22:38] day we need to know the answer to this
[22:42] question amen amen he didn't just become
[22:47] born of a
[22:50] virgin just to do a
[22:53] miracle there was a
[22:56] reason amen so I'm going to read a a
[22:59] quote you from the
[23:02] message and this is from what thinky of
[23:08] Christ just one small little
[23:12] quote brother B says I
[23:16] said that's just a good thing to talk
[23:21] about I said if you ever get the Virgin
[23:25] birth straightened out
[23:30] you got Christianity straightened
[23:35] out right that's an amazing
[23:40] quote if you get the Virgin bir
[23:42] straightened
[23:45] out that means most people don't have it
[23:48] straightened
[23:52] out he wouldn't make that statement
[23:59] if everybody knew what this was
[24:04] about why was he born of a
[24:08] virgin amen if you get it straightened
[24:12] now you've got Christianity straight
[24:18] out all right so when we look at the
[24:20] scripture we
[24:23] read which is Isaiah
[24:27] 7:14 you
[24:30] notice and this is an important thing to
[24:34] see it says the Lord himself shall give
[24:37] you a
[24:41] sign that means the Virgin birth is a
[24:47] sign you know you know why signs are
[24:52] given because something was
[24:56] expected it was it was because a victory
[25:00] was
[25:02] coming something prophesied was
[25:06] coming but also a sign is
[25:10] given when something
[25:14] impossible to
[25:16] believe to
[25:18] happen has to
[25:20] happen something
[25:23] Supernatural is
[25:25] sent because something impossible
[25:30] is about to
[25:32] happen something that couldn't be
[25:36] accomplished and this is not just a sign
[25:38] being
[25:40] given this is the Lord
[25:44] himself giving you a
[25:47] sign beautiful
[25:49] amen then he
[25:51] says butter and honey shall he
[25:57] eat does that mean the Lord Jesus Christ
[25:59] ate only butter and honey when he was a
[26:03] baby what does it
[26:06] mean so the sign
[26:08] is not just that a virgin will
[26:13] conceive and bear a
[26:15] son and that his his
[26:20] manifestation that's his name would be
[26:23] God With
[26:24] Us he would eat butter and honey
[26:30] that means he would have a taste for
[26:37] righteousness and refuse evil
[26:41] things he was going to be born of a
[26:44] virgin he would be the manifestation of
[26:47] God With
[26:50] Us he would show he would show the
[26:53] appetite for righteousness
[26:58] amen amen that's butter and
[27:01] honey I like that because if you expose
[27:05] your
[27:06] children to good things to
[27:10] righteousness from the
[27:12] beginning they grow up into a righteous
[27:16] life amen now the question is why would
[27:21] God use this as a
[27:25] sign so if you study history
[27:29] you might
[27:30] say that God gave this
[27:34] prophecy so that they should protect
[27:37] their
[27:39] virgins you know like protect the
[27:43] children you might say uh uh because
[27:48] they needed to be protected to bring
[27:50] forth the
[27:54] Sun so so that's why he gave the
[27:57] prophecy
[28:00] that's not true whether they protected
[28:04] The Virgins or
[28:06] not if God wanted to do
[28:09] it he would have found a virgin that was
[28:13] protected that's not why the prophecy
[28:16] was
[28:18] spoken amen being in
[28:22] captivity the Jewish
[28:25] people the Israelites
[28:28] were taken into
[28:30] captivity by
[28:32] Babylon by
[28:35] Persia by the
[28:37] Greeks right or before
[28:40] Christ and those Heathen
[28:44] people were sacrificing
[28:49] virgins because they wanted their
[28:53] gods to bless their
[28:57] land it was for
[29:00] fertility they would sacrifice a virgin
[29:04] girl or a baby
[29:07] boy so that the girl the
[29:11] gods would bless their
[29:13] land so they could have
[29:16] rain so they could have
[29:18] crops amen amen so you might
[29:22] think if they
[29:26] said uh there would be the Messiah born
[29:29] of a
[29:31] virgin then maybe God did that so
[29:34] they'll stop
[29:39] sacrificing but it's not
[29:42] why amen let's go to
[29:45] Matthew Chapter 1 Verse
[29:49] 18 to
[29:51] 23 you love him Saints glory to
[29:55] God says now the birth ofes Jesus Christ
[29:59] was on this wise when as his mother Mary
[30:02] was espoused to Joseph before they came
[30:06] together she was found with child of the
[30:08] Holy
[30:20] Ghost then her husband being a just man
[30:24] and not willing to make her a public
[30:26] example was Ed to put her away
[30:37] privately but while he thought on these
[30:40] things behold the angel of the Lord
[30:42] appeared unto him in a dream saying
[30:44] Joseph thou son of David fear not to
[30:47] take thee marry thy wife for that which
[30:49] is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost
[31:02] and she shall bring forth the
[31:04] son she shall bring forth the son and
[31:07] thou shalt call his name Jesus for he
[31:09] shall save his people from their
[31:17] sins now all this was done that it might
[31:20] be fulfilled which was spoken of the
[31:23] Lord by the prophet saying Behold a
[31:26] virgin shall be with child and shall
[31:28] bring forth a son and they shall call
[31:30] his name Emmanuel which being
[31:32] interpreted is God With
[31:44] Us amen amen so this was the actual
[31:49] happening of Isaiah's
[31:53] prophecy are you with
[31:56] us right so what was the point of such a
[32:02] thing so you know this was fulfilled in
[32:07] Mary and
[32:10] Joseph and it it didn't just come
[32:13] because it was a virgin that was
[32:19] available Joseph was a just
[32:22] man he was a godly
[32:24] man he was going to do the right thing
[32:29] amen amen and she was found with child
[32:32] of the Holy
[32:36] Ghost she was found with child of the
[32:39] Holy
[32:42] Ghost amen so
[32:46] why what was the point of
[32:50] this so the common belief around the
[32:53] world was
[32:58] it's what everyone around the world
[33:01] believes that
[33:03] sin is transferred through the man's
[33:09] blood that's what everyone
[33:11] believes that sin is transferred through
[33:14] the blood of the
[33:16] man therefore we didn't want the blood
[33:19] of a
[33:21] man right but we also find that sin is
[33:26] transferred through the woman
[33:32] because your
[33:33] child has
[33:35] genetics
[33:37] genes from the mother and the
[33:40] father even though the child has the
[33:42] man's
[33:46] blood
[33:48] sicknesses sin or
[33:51] whatever like sin of the Flesh in the
[33:53] body like heart disease
[33:59] whatever
[34:01] diabetes it's transferred through mother
[34:03] and
[34:06] father so
[34:09] evil in the
[34:11] flesh is passed through the mother and
[34:14] the
[34:17] father so why was Christ
[34:22] pure if he was born through the
[34:26] woman right there is some
[34:29] truth right in
[34:32] that but what
[34:35] sin is the sin the wrong things that men
[34:41] do stay with me let's read Psalm 51
[34:45] verse
[34:47] 5 this is David
[34:51] speaking he says behold I was shapen in
[34:55] iniquity and in sin did my mother
[34:58] conceived
[35:03] me now what sin did David's mother
[35:09] Commit This is showing that sin is not
[35:12] in the birth of the
[35:16] child in sin did she
[35:21] conceive right so the sin is actually in
[35:24] the conception
[35:27] David's mother was not an
[35:31] adulterous so what sin she didn't commit
[35:36] sin she produced a child through David's
[35:41] father they were
[35:43] married there was no
[35:46] sin so what is the
[35:49] sin the sin lies in the
[35:53] conception why does the sin lie in the
[35:56] conception
[35:59] this is why you have to get the Virgin
[36:00] bir straightened
[36:05] out
[36:07] sexuality is also not the
[36:13] sin because God created men and wom with
[36:16] sexual
[36:20] organs if they made
[36:23] Choice brother said they would have come
[36:26] to sexuality
[36:29] eventually it wouldn't have been a
[36:32] sin what's the
[36:35] problem with sexual conception
[36:40] today it's because of the adultery in
[36:42] the
[36:45] beginning that Beast
[36:48] nature entered into
[36:52] Mankind and every sexual conception from
[36:56] there
[36:59] put Beast
[37:01] nature into every
[37:04] man that's why the conception has sin in
[37:09] it there is no sin between a man and his
[37:14] wife it's not the sex that's the
[37:17] sin it's the fact that Natures are being
[37:23] crossed so the two trees in the Garden
[37:26] of Eden
[37:29] were two ways of producing
[37:34] Sons brother bam said that uh Adam and
[37:39] Eve were supposed to bring forth
[37:42] Sons by spiritual
[37:46] multiplication what is spiritual
[37:49] multiplication the Virgin
[37:52] birth they could have spoken the the
[37:55] sons into existence
[37:58] they could have come to the full power
[38:00] of their
[38:03] theophany spoken
[38:05] seed into Eve's
[38:11] womb and brought forth Sons without
[38:15] sensation without
[38:17] sensation without
[38:20] sensuality that was would would have
[38:22] been the will of
[38:24] God the perfect will of God the tree of
[38:29] life and there would have been no
[38:32] sin there would have been no human
[38:35] nature
[38:36] involved there would have been no uh a
[38:40] man's will
[38:42] involved but because they chose the tree
[38:45] of the knowledge of Good and
[38:48] Evil and now what's wrong with
[38:51] that is that is by man's
[38:56] will that brings forth permissive
[39:00] will you see people in this world
[39:03] today they
[39:05] say God made
[39:07] me no God didn't make
[39:10] you your parents made
[39:13] you God allowed you to
[39:17] live that's permissive
[39:20] will that's what the world is saying oh
[39:23] I am this
[39:24] way God made me this way
[39:28] so you know you must accept me as I
[39:31] am that's not true you born by tree of
[39:34] knowledge of Good and
[39:36] Evil the will of man but sons of God
[39:40] were not supposed to be born by the will
[39:42] of
[39:42] man that's why John 1 says to them that
[39:48] believe allowed he them to become sons
[39:50] of
[39:51] God which are born not of the flesh but
[39:55] of the will of God that's how Sons were
[39:58] supposed to be
[40:00] born amen so the tree of
[40:05] knowledge was the way that beasts and
[40:08] all other creatures were being
[40:11] born and Eve she walked through the
[40:17] garden and she saw the Lions bringing
[40:23] forth now I want I I want to show you
[40:26] the right picture
[40:30] Eve had the most handsomest husband in
[40:33] the
[40:37] world he was the most perfect
[40:40] man she was the most perfect
[40:44] women don't tell me she lusted after a
[40:52] serpent what was the
[40:56] problem she wanted a
[40:59] child because God told them they would
[41:03] multiply and replenish the
[41:06] Earth so she wasn't like this stupid
[41:10] woman who got fooled by a smooth talking
[41:15] man who seduced her with
[41:20] sex he showed
[41:22] her I know God said you can bring forth
[41:26] Sons this way
[41:29] but you don't have to
[41:31] wait you could do it this
[41:34] way so this is how it would have
[41:37] happened she would have walked through
[41:39] the
[41:41] garden she would have come to this
[41:44] Village
[41:45] of of the
[41:48] serpents she would have seen them
[41:49] bringing forth
[41:52] children she would have seen them
[41:53] feeding the
[41:56] children would been Desiring to have a
[42:01] child and she would have said to
[42:04] Adam we could do
[42:07] this this is how it would
[42:10] happen she wasn't a a silly
[42:14] woman who just fell for some
[42:19] guy it was all about bringing forth
[42:23] son the prophet said she stopped to
[42:26] reason
[42:30] amen she reasoned this
[42:33] out and he told her the serpent told her
[42:38] this would make you
[42:40] wise you shall be as
[42:43] Gods how so you will bring forth
[42:47] children by your own
[42:53] will
[42:54] amen so Man was created
[42:59] to bring
[43:00] forth this
[43:02] way but also to have the ability of
[43:05] spoken
[43:07] word so you you
[43:10] agree God gave them the ability to bring
[43:13] forth both
[43:18] ways so he want he gave them free
[43:22] will they could have made the
[43:25] choice am
[43:27] but when she crossed
[43:31] Natures with Beast and
[43:35] humans this threw all
[43:40] mankind into a sin that should not have
[43:47] happened you want to know how we know
[43:50] she thought she was doing
[43:53] right when Cain was born she said I've
[43:57] gotten a man from the
[44:00] Lord I've got a man from the
[44:05] Lord
[44:07] right that means it was all about
[44:10] bringing forth
[44:11] children I mean how could a woman the
[44:15] the the first man and
[44:17] woman who were first made in
[44:21] theophany and stood there in glorified
[44:25] flesh you tell me she was so
[44:30] silly she just fell for some
[44:36] serpent no it was deeper than that she
[44:41] reasoned on how to bring forth
[44:45] Sons he seduced
[44:48] her by interpreting God's
[44:53] word it's not it wasn't about the sex
[44:58] it was always about bringing forth
[45:02] sons and about choosing the will of
[45:06] man over the will of
[45:09] God so in Genesis
[45:11] 3 the the Lord
[45:14] says we are going to send them out of
[45:16] the
[45:18] garden why because they have become
[45:22] Gods they've become like us he say no it
[45:27] didn't say it's because of the sex you
[45:29] blocked the way to the tree of life
[45:32] because they have chosen to do things by
[45:34] their own
[45:38] will it's very important thing to
[45:42] understand amen so when Natures were
[45:46] crossed the nature of Beast was mixed
[45:49] with
[45:52] man every time a man and woman comes
[45:55] together
[45:57] the nature of Beast is being
[46:01] passed into the Next
[46:03] Generation amen let's read Genesis
[46:06] 3:14-15
[46:10] so stay with
[46:13] me okay so I'm not a powerful preacher
[46:16] like your
[46:19] pastor I'm more of a a a teaching type
[46:23] of
[46:25] ministry all right so and I stay with
[46:29] that I have no special
[46:32] gifts I don't prophesy or speak with
[46:35] tongues I have this small gift that God
[46:37] gave
[46:38] me and I stick to
[46:41] that so you bear with
[46:43] me Genesis 3:14
[46:47] 15 and the Lord God said unto the
[46:50] serpent because thou has done this Thou
[46:53] Art cursed above all cattle above every
[46:56] be east of the field now I want you to
[46:58] listen to every word there
[47:00] right upon thy belly thou sh go and dust
[47:04] shal thou eat all the days of thy
[47:16] life and I will put enmity between thee
[47:19] and the woman and between thy seed and
[47:22] her seed and it shall bruise thy head
[47:25] and thou shalt bruise his heel
[47:34] now there's three things we can take
[47:36] from
[47:37] here number
[47:39] one there is
[47:41] enmity enmity
[47:44] means
[47:46] disagreement like a
[47:49] fight a
[47:51] struggle
[47:53] striving turmoil
[47:57] between the serpent or the
[48:00] Beast and the woman not the
[48:05] man right look he said I'll put enmity
[48:08] between thee and the
[48:14] woman we just thought it was
[48:18] mankind it there going to be a
[48:21] struggle between the Beast
[48:24] nature and and the woman
[48:27] right hold that thought and then enmity
[48:31] between the seed of The
[48:37] Serpent and the seed of the
[48:40] woman right and number
[48:43] three her
[48:47] seed speaks of a virgin
[48:51] birth because a woman has no seed
[48:57] you agree
[48:59] amen so you can see that the Virgin
[49:03] birth is directly
[49:06] linked to the woman and the serpent in
[49:09] the
[49:11] garden that's half the
[49:14] answer there had to be a virgin
[49:19] birth to cancel out what was done in the
[49:24] garden see so so you can see all
[49:27] Christians in the
[49:30] world don't believe in what happened in
[49:32] the
[49:34] garden therefore they can't straighten
[49:36] Christianity
[49:40] out you know the hardest thing to do is
[49:43] is tell a denominational
[49:47] person what happened in serpent
[49:51] seed but they all believe in the Virgin
[49:54] bird but they don't know what
[49:58] why they don't know about the crossing
[50:00] of
[50:03] natures they don't know about the enmity
[50:05] between serpent seed and the
[50:11] woman now if it was the seed of a
[50:15] man the scripture would have
[50:18] said the seed of the
[50:21] man or something
[50:23] else then God insisted
[50:27] from the
[50:29] start that they keep their
[50:32] lineage
[50:34] separate from the seed of
[50:36] [Music]
[50:37] Cain why because Cain was the seed of
[50:42] the of the
[50:44] beast that's the reason Noah found
[50:48] Grace because he kept his
[50:53] lineage do you see that this is why he
[50:57] said these sons of men took the
[51:01] daughters or the sons of God took the
[51:04] daughters of men and terrible things
[51:07] were happening in
[51:09] Earth Before the
[51:12] Flood the crossing of
[51:15] natures made
[51:19] Giants strange mutant
[51:25] humans and and
[51:27] and they're finding their fossils
[51:29] now which were buried deep After the
[51:35] flood and God looked upon the Earth and
[51:38] it was so
[51:40] bad that they were crossing the
[51:44] lineages that there was no choice but to
[51:47] destroy
[51:51] mankind Noah found
[51:54] gra because he kept his
[51:57] lineage he was a righteous
[52:00] man righteous means to do the right
[52:04] thing righteous means to make the right
[52:10] choice amen not because we know after
[52:13] that he was a
[52:17] drunken he was only righteous because of
[52:20] his
[52:22] choice to keep his lineage
[52:26] but we
[52:28] know that some of it crept
[52:32] in through the wives of his
[52:37] sons most likely by then most likely by
[52:42] then they had been mixed into the wives
[52:46] of his
[52:49] sons brother B says in a
[52:51] quote that sin crept in through the ark
[52:57] I just want to make sure you know I'm
[52:59] I'm not making it
[53:00] up glory to God
[53:04] so God wanted them to stop Crossing
[53:11] Natures more than it already
[53:14] was he wanted to prevent
[53:18] it so he
[53:21] believed he could work with
[53:24] mankind with just Noah's family
[53:29] and all of kan's lineage was
[53:33] destroyed so God believed he could take
[53:37] Noah's
[53:38] family even though there was some Crush
[53:40] Natures in
[53:42] there and he could purify
[53:45] it with the age of
[53:50] law so now you know why the age of law
[53:53] came
[53:54] in to correct the natures of the
[53:58] flesh right so the seed of
[54:01] Cain were called the Sons of
[54:05] men and the seed of
[54:07] Adam was called the sons of
[54:11] God and the
[54:13] enemy Satan was always
[54:18] preoccupied with corrupting the sons of
[54:24] God he was going after to all the
[54:28] sons he went after
[54:30] Abraham and
[54:33] Jacob and
[54:35] David all the sons of
[54:38] God because he knew that there was a
[54:40] messiah
[54:41] coming he went after
[54:44] Isaac he went after all of
[54:46] them but God was not protecting the
[54:53] males he was protecting the women
[54:56] the woman was the
[54:59] secret because
[55:01] eventually it would be a woman in the
[55:03] line of
[55:06] Judah Every Woman Of Promise was
[55:11] Barren until you received the right
[55:16] seed while the enemy was
[55:19] distracted going after to the
[55:21] man God was protecting the
[55:24] womb of the woman in the lineage glory
[55:28] to God and because in the woman there is
[55:32] no
[55:33] seed therefore it didn't
[55:36] matter if Ruth and
[55:39] Rahab were not re
[55:42] Hebrews What
[55:44] mattered was their
[55:48] faith this is important to
[55:51] understand the woman's
[55:54] seed has to do with
[56:00] Faith so with
[56:03] Mary she said be it unto me according to
[56:08] Thy
[56:09] word amen her seed was about
[56:15] faith the Virgin
[56:17] birth could only be
[56:20] possible in a woman with
[56:25] faith Sarah couldn't because she
[56:29] laughed she didn't
[56:32] believe that this would be
[56:34] possible if she could have she might
[56:37] have produced the
[56:40] Messiah but she didn't have the
[56:43] faith Abraham had the
[56:45] Faith remember the prophet
[56:48] said Sarah Sarah was
[56:51] Barren and Abraham's stream of life was
[56:53] dried up
[57:01] his reproductive system was dried
[57:05] up right so we know he was
[57:10] healed because he brought forth
[57:15] isma he had the faith Sarah's Faith was
[57:19] a
[57:21] problem Abraham was waiting for her
[57:23] faith to come
[57:26] and she couldn't because she didn't
[57:29] believe and God had to come according to
[57:31] the time of
[57:32] life God had to come as
[57:35] mlisc as
[57:37] Elohim he had to make an
[57:40] appearing and then a
[57:42] coming to make it happen for
[57:45] her glory to God so the woman
[57:50] seed is what she conceives without sex
[57:57] without
[57:58] sex like in Mary it's got to do with her
[58:03] faith amen amen now
[58:07] Israel was always referred
[58:10] to as a woman in
[58:15] travail why because of her faith her
[58:19] faith was always in
[58:22] Jeopardy she was always going towards
[58:26] idol
[58:28] worship is that right God kept speaking
[58:32] at
[58:33] Israel to keep their
[58:36] virginity he was talking about their
[58:39] faith and they were waiting for their
[58:42] seed to be seen in the last
[58:46] days amen and Israel is still
[58:51] waiting let's have a look Revelations
[58:54] 12:17
[58:57] you know Revelations 12 speaking about
[59:01] Israel right the dragon was rough with
[59:04] the
[59:08] woman and went to make war with the
[59:11] remnant of her
[59:12] [Music]
[59:14] seed teaches us the remnant being the
[59:20] 144,000 which keep the Commandments of
[59:23] God and have the testimony of Jesus
[59:28] Christ Paul
[59:31] realized that the
[59:32] church will have to be presented to
[59:37] Christ as a pure spiritual
[59:42] [Music]
[59:44] virgin is that right meaning they would
[59:47] only receive the
[59:52] book from the hand of him who sits on
[59:54] the throne
[59:57] if they have
[59:59] untainted faith perfect
[1:00:02] [Music]
[1:00:04] Faith that's that's the only way they'll
[1:00:06] receive the
[1:00:07] book 2 Corinthians
[1:00:11] 12 uh 11 verse2
[1:00:14] sorry for I this is Paul speaking to the
[1:00:17] church for I am jealous over you with a
[1:00:21] Godly
[1:00:23] jealousy I have espoused you to one
[1:00:27] husband that I may present
[1:00:30] you as a chased virgin to
[1:00:35] Christ amen amen now we know after this
[1:00:39] he says I'm
[1:00:40] afraid that as the serpent beg
[1:00:45] leave this will happen to you he's going
[1:00:48] right back
[1:00:50] to the Garden of Eden he's talking about
[1:00:54] virginity
[1:00:56] he's talking about the serpent and he's
[1:00:58] showing us that Eve was
[1:01:01] beguiled her faith was
[1:01:05] tested he's talking about the church now
[1:01:08] and he's talking about your faith being
[1:01:12] tested in other words as the woman lost
[1:01:16] the battle in the
[1:01:18] garden bying faith in the
[1:01:22] word the bride would have to bring forth
[1:01:26] the bride will have to bring
[1:01:28] forth the
[1:01:30] predestinated spiritual
[1:01:33] Christ by gaining pure faith in the
[1:01:38] word amen that's why the bride is worthy
[1:01:43] today because of her faith glory to God
[1:01:48] now you know what happened in the
[1:01:50] spiritual In the End of
[1:01:53] Time according to the Book of Revelation
[1:01:57] all the prophecies in the Book of
[1:02:00] Revelations has got to do
[1:02:04] with
[1:02:06] women
[1:02:09] plural more than
[1:02:12] one and the
[1:02:16] Beast in the Book of
[1:02:18] Revelations there's a
[1:02:21] beast the Beast has a
[1:02:23] son the Beast son is the man of
[1:02:28] sin let's look at
[1:02:30] it come on Saints amen number
[1:02:36] one
[1:02:37] Israel is
[1:02:40] symbolized in Revelations
[1:02:43] 12 as a woman who is
[1:02:46] pregnant a woman in
[1:02:50] travail so what are we
[1:02:52] seeing in Revelations
[1:02:54] 12 Israel is a pregnant
[1:02:57] woman she's bringing forth the
[1:03:00] Son and the Beast the dragon the old
[1:03:06] serpent is trying to get the
[1:03:10] child then number
[1:03:13] two the true
[1:03:15] church is called the
[1:03:18] bride in Revelations
[1:03:21] 19 and Revelations
[1:03:23] 21 and they are all those
[1:03:27] who have overcome the
[1:03:31] Beast right which means the
[1:03:36] victory then we also see a false
[1:03:40] Church a woman who is called the
[1:03:45] who is seated upon that
[1:03:48] Beast with seven heads and 10
[1:03:53] horse the whole book of Revelation
[1:03:57] is about three
[1:03:59] women the false
[1:04:01] Church the bride and Israel and the
[1:04:06] Beast the bride overcomes the
[1:04:11] Beast Israel is being targeted
[1:04:15] physically by the
[1:04:19] Beast and the
[1:04:22] bride is the woman who overcomes the
[1:04:24] Beast
[1:04:29] beautiful so we've got the Garden of
[1:04:33] Eden we've got the Virgin
[1:04:35] birth and we've got the woman in the end
[1:04:39] time it's all about Crossing of
[1:04:44] nature there is no mention in the Book
[1:04:47] of
[1:04:50] Revelations about a man getting the
[1:04:52] victory
[1:04:56] it's all about woman and the
[1:04:59] Beast we see that there is
[1:05:03] war always between the Beast
[1:05:07] War battle you got it between the
[1:05:11] Beast which is the spirit of
[1:05:14] unbelief and the woman who
[1:05:18] represents the spirit of
[1:05:21] Faith or subjection to the word
[1:05:27] amen it's about a
[1:05:29] woman who accepts the word as her
[1:05:35] headship will not take the seed of the
[1:05:40] Beast
[1:05:42] amen that's what the whole story is
[1:05:47] about you love him
[1:05:49] Saints so I've
[1:05:52] got a few points
[1:05:56] to close this
[1:05:57] down don't worry we're not finishing
[1:06:00] right
[1:06:02] now so what is the purpose of the Virgin
[1:06:10] birth so we're going to close this down
[1:06:13] now but we're going to explain the whole
[1:06:15] thing to
[1:06:17] you number one the purpose of the Virgin
[1:06:22] birth is to bring forth a son
[1:06:26] who does not have the nature of the
[1:06:29] beast in
[1:06:31] him amen that's it why
[1:06:36] because Christ was not born of the seed
[1:06:41] of
[1:06:42] man or the Egg of the
[1:06:45] woman the prophet said God
[1:06:49] created the seed and the Egg it had
[1:06:53] nothing to do with Mary
[1:06:57] there was no
[1:06:58] conception of man there was no Crossing
[1:07:02] of
[1:07:03] nature Christ did not even
[1:07:06] have the nature of
[1:07:09] Mary in him it was purely the blood of
[1:07:13] God purely the life of
[1:07:16] God perfect nature of God in him and he
[1:07:20] was the only one who could save mankind
[1:07:27] amen number
[1:07:29] two why because all
[1:07:34] before all men
[1:07:36] before had the nature of
[1:07:40] Beast and
[1:07:42] man mixed into
[1:07:46] him do you know why
[1:07:48] now under the age of
[1:07:51] law they were sacrificing beasts
[1:08:00] it was the blood of Beast that had to be
[1:08:04] taken because that was the
[1:08:07] sin that was the nature that was
[1:08:10] producing
[1:08:13] transgression the blood of bulls and
[1:08:16] goats the blood of
[1:08:18] Beast yes it was not they could there
[1:08:21] was no more serpent to
[1:08:23] kill so the blood of Beast was
[1:08:27] filled for every
[1:08:29] man for the
[1:08:32] atonement the
[1:08:34] believer under the law had had to bring
[1:08:38] a
[1:08:40] ram a
[1:08:43] bulock he had to place his
[1:08:46] hands on the head of the
[1:08:50] animal and the priest would cut off the
[1:08:52] animal's head
[1:08:56] showing all the man's
[1:08:58] sin all his
[1:09:00] transgression is passed to the
[1:09:04] animal and the animal pays the
[1:09:08] price and the blood of the
[1:09:12] transgression is taken into the holy
[1:09:17] place and the man's nature is
[1:09:21] pardoned there were beasts being killed
[1:09:26] every
[1:09:28] year with every
[1:09:30] Feast with every
[1:09:33] sacrifice because there was a crossing
[1:09:35] of
[1:09:37] nature God brought the
[1:09:40] law to suppress the nature of
[1:09:45] beasts in our
[1:09:47] bodies it was supposed to teach
[1:09:50] man to stop doing beastly things
[1:09:59] amen stop behaving like
[1:10:03] beasts man was supposed to have become
[1:10:07] trained to say I should stop committing
[1:10:12] adultery and keep killing innocent
[1:10:15] beasts I should stop
[1:10:18] murdering and keep killing innocent
[1:10:21] Beasts for
[1:10:24] me they could have become less and less
[1:10:30] sacrifices if they learned their
[1:10:33] lesson by suppressing the Beast
[1:10:37] nature the nature of man Begin to Fall
[1:10:41] in his
[1:10:43] Spirit what
[1:10:45] happened they became
[1:10:51] self-righteous so that's why the age of
[1:10:53] law to stop
[1:10:55] because the nature of man began to
[1:10:59] fall the law had to come to an
[1:11:02] end because he became so
[1:11:05] righteous I don't commit
[1:11:07] adultery I don't drink I don't
[1:11:10] smoke I read my Bible I go to
[1:11:15] church I do all the prayers I keep the
[1:11:19] communion I get
[1:11:23] baptized he's keeping the
[1:11:26] law and then the Messiah
[1:11:29] comes he's so
[1:11:31] righteous he can't see the
[1:11:34] Messiah he can't see the coming of the
[1:11:36] Lord that wasn't the Beast nature
[1:11:40] falling that was the man's nature
[1:11:42] Fall by keeping the
[1:11:46] Commandments self
[1:11:48] righteous that the man's nature needs
[1:11:53] salvation and so sacrifices of of Beast
[1:11:55] was not working
[1:11:57] anymore there had to come a
[1:12:00] man perfect like the man at the
[1:12:05] beginning only a man a pure
[1:12:08] Man Without Beast nature in
[1:12:11] him die so that man's Spirit could be
[1:12:17] saved amen that's why Paul
[1:12:21] said I find in me two
[1:12:23] laws two name
[1:12:26] that when I want to do good evil is
[1:12:29] present amen so by the end of the Lord
[1:12:36] dispensation the spirit of man was so
[1:12:41] corrupt that the sacrifice of Beast was
[1:12:44] not
[1:12:45] working you agree amen and it would only
[1:12:50] take the sacrifice of a perfect man
[1:12:56] number
[1:12:57] six when this man would
[1:13:01] die his
[1:13:03] Spirit would come back upon the
[1:13:06] man you know in the message the
[1:13:09] token said when the beasts were
[1:13:12] killed the spirit of the Beast could not
[1:13:16] come back upon the
[1:13:18] man because he was a man there was a
[1:13:22] beast that's why Beast had to be killed
[1:13:24] every
[1:13:27] but under the token when Christ died the
[1:13:31] blood cell broke and the spirit of
[1:13:34] God which was in the perfect
[1:13:37] man became the Holy
[1:13:40] Ghost come back upon the
[1:13:43] believer and perfect the spirit of
[1:13:47] man why because through church
[1:13:50] ages could bring the virtues back in
[1:13:55] fa virtue knowledge Temperance patience
[1:14:01] godliness brotherly
[1:14:03] kindness waiting for
[1:14:05] what for the word to
[1:14:08] come so true faith in a woman could be
[1:14:13] received waiting for the church to come
[1:14:15] to
[1:14:16] Perfection to receive in the womb The
[1:14:19] Original Seed word of
[1:14:23] God glory to God amen the Holy
[1:14:27] Ghost this is why you need the Holy
[1:14:30] Ghost because in you in our flesh is
[1:14:34] still Beast
[1:14:35] nature I when I when I want to do good
[1:14:39] evil is present the Holy Ghost
[1:14:42] suppresses the Beast
[1:14:45] nature amen but it's
[1:14:49] temporary because you have to believe
[1:14:51] the
[1:14:52] word the Holy Ghost gives you Faith to
[1:14:57] believe the word that's why brother said
[1:15:00] you can have the Holy Ghost 24 hours in
[1:15:03] a day and still go to
[1:15:07] hell because you're supposed to get the
[1:15:10] Holy Ghost to believe the
[1:15:13] word many people in brother Bam's
[1:15:16] day received the Holy Ghost spoke in
[1:15:20] tongues
[1:15:21] prophesied Visions when the seven seal
[1:15:24] was open
[1:15:25] they wouldn't believe the
[1:15:27] word and they
[1:15:29] fell right now in America there are so
[1:15:34] many people leaving the
[1:15:37] word and trying to go back to
[1:15:40] Pentecost they want the baptism of the
[1:15:43] Holy
[1:15:44] Ghost without the
[1:15:46] word it's not going to work the Holy
[1:15:49] Ghost was given to suppress the be
[1:15:53] nature so can't believe the
[1:15:56] word to bring you to the third
[1:16:00] pole the Holy Ghost is a temporary
[1:16:03] thing because he said the baptism of the
[1:16:06] Holy Ghost must make way for the
[1:16:10] person of Christ the person of
[1:16:14] Christ make way for the person of
[1:16:17] Christ come to believe the
[1:16:20] word why
[1:16:22] says why because the church Church must
[1:16:26] be a virgin
[1:16:28] womb to to receive the pure
[1:16:32] word you can't go and receive Pentecost
[1:16:37] wordin
[1:16:40] word
[1:16:42] Doctrine this bride must receive perfect
[1:16:46] seed and the womb must be
[1:16:50] virgin and how will it
[1:16:53] be her faith must be pure because the
[1:16:56] seed of the woman has to do with
[1:17:01] Fai right glory to God this is why if
[1:17:06] men do not receive the Holy
[1:17:09] Ghost your
[1:17:11] spirit ends up
[1:17:13] receiving the mark of the
[1:17:20] beast this is it brother bam said the
[1:17:23] Holy Ghost is the Seal of God it's the
[1:17:27] mark of God if you don't get the Holy
[1:17:31] Ghost you take the mark of the
[1:17:33] beast again it's about it's either the
[1:17:37] the blood of
[1:17:38] God the nature of God which is the Holy
[1:17:42] Ghost the anointing of the
[1:17:44] nature or you going to get the mark of
[1:17:47] the
[1:17:48] beast which is the anointing of the
[1:17:50] Beast and if you
[1:17:53] combine the anointing of the Beast with
[1:17:56] the
[1:17:57] Bible what are you going to
[1:18:00] produce a
[1:18:01] cane who murders his own
[1:18:06] brother who will murder
[1:18:08] Christians who will use the pet to fight
[1:18:12] against his own message
[1:18:16] Believers and still
[1:18:19] claim to have the Holy
[1:18:22] Ghost this is what we're seeing today
[1:18:26] that's very close
[1:18:28] Saints so close could deceive the very
[1:18:33] elect imagine saying am I My Brother's
[1:18:40] Keeper just because the church has signs
[1:18:43] wonders Holy
[1:18:45] Ghost there's nothing wrong with
[1:18:48] that if you believe the
[1:18:51] word if you accept the word
[1:18:55] how many Christians are there in this
[1:18:57] world Listen the Bible tells us that the
[1:19:01] children of the
[1:19:03] desolate far more children than the
[1:19:06] children of the woman who is the
[1:19:11] wife they've got far more
[1:19:14] signs it's
[1:19:16] true those people in the
[1:19:20] denominations they're the ones who are
[1:19:22] prayer warriors
[1:19:25] they're the ones who when there's
[1:19:27] floods when there's natural
[1:19:30] disasters they're the ones helping
[1:19:33] everyone they're the ones reaching
[1:19:36] out they're the ones opening their
[1:19:40] churches and feed the the
[1:19:44] hungry they look like far more righteous
[1:19:48] people than people in The
[1:19:52] Bride it's shameful
[1:19:57] but it's the
[1:19:58] truth they'll ask
[1:20:01] you where are your churches when we need
[1:20:06] help and he got nothing to
[1:20:09] say in
[1:20:12] anything in
[1:20:14] everything they look better than
[1:20:17] us they'll tell you we got all the
[1:20:21] signs you got nothing you just got a few
[1:20:26] things they're doing all
[1:20:29] that without the
[1:20:34] word so if you
[1:20:37] think you're going to have to bring what
[1:20:39] they've
[1:20:41] got to be like
[1:20:44] them this has been done already and
[1:20:49] failed you are called to be like
[1:20:53] Mary be unto me according to Thy
[1:20:57] word I can lust after the power of the
[1:21:00] Holy
[1:21:03] Ghost but why because I want
[1:21:06] works because it's
[1:21:11] selfishness I want to bring forth the
[1:21:15] word the
[1:21:17] life according to his
[1:21:20] will that's the
[1:21:23] victory because Eve failed because she
[1:21:27] wanted to bring forth Sons by her
[1:21:31] will we we got to get the
[1:21:34] victory by bringing forth the victory by
[1:21:38] God's will not my will
[1:21:42] but amen after after 2,000
[1:21:47] years of church
[1:21:50] ages though man had received the Holy
[1:21:53] Ghost
[1:21:56] we reach brother Mam's
[1:21:58] day lean Church
[1:22:01] Age cost Church
[1:22:04] age before God pulls a bride out of the
[1:22:10] church you believe we've been pulled out
[1:22:12] of lat this
[1:22:13] year L this year is still going
[1:22:16] on but the bride is been pulled
[1:22:19] out into a Capstone age
[1:22:23] you you you have to believe that
[1:22:26] otherwise we're going to be receiving
[1:22:27] cross
[1:22:30] Natures but man's
[1:22:34] Soul has has got doubt in
[1:22:40] it even though the spirit was being
[1:22:42] perfected by the holy
[1:22:46] ghost at the End of the
[1:22:48] Age man's
[1:22:50] soul is now the
[1:22:53] Battleground it was the flesh in the
[1:22:56] law it was the spirit under the
[1:22:59] grace that's why there is a third pole
[1:23:03] Ministry because the Battleground is now
[1:23:06] the
[1:23:08] soul it's not about
[1:23:10] law not about the spirit it's not about
[1:23:16] Sensations that's all been
[1:23:19] done God has worked on that
[1:23:23] successfully now it's about the
[1:23:25] soul amen that's why there's a third
[1:23:28] pool
[1:23:29] Ministry finally it comes to the
[1:23:32] end the church would have to be a
[1:23:37] vessel
[1:23:39] Virgin of all man's
[1:23:44] systems all
[1:23:46] Creeds all
[1:23:49] teachings false

[1:23:56] who will will take the word of
[1:23:58] God be ready will have no
[1:24:02] doubt who will receive the open
[1:24:09] book amen amen it would only take the
[1:24:12] revelation of the pure
[1:24:16] word to remove doubt from her
[1:24:21] soul listen
[1:24:24] do you think you've really been
[1:24:27] tested

[1:25:08] father my closest
[1:25:11] friend that wasn't even a

[1:25:22] me because I know where he is it's not
[1:25:26] even a
[1:25:27] test what is a
[1:25:30] test about
[1:25:33] faith your test is still
[1:25:37] coming your cross is still
[1:25:40] coming this is not going to be
[1:25:42] easy what is the test
[1:25:45] about whether you're going to stay with
[1:25:47] the
[1:25:51] word will you stay with the word
[1:25:55] sister sir if your husband gives
[1:26:01] up if your husband turns around and

[1:28:01] fails has to be a soul it has to be a
[1:28:05] bride not church goers not people who
[1:28:09] keep
