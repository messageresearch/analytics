mcbride coming this weekend dennis mcbride and we'll have a saturday and sunday service here are invited to come by the grace of god but next sunday morning uh i'll be in iowa city iowa city uh brother dennis is a oh brother and friend denise and i'm sure in my absence here be a blessing to the church saint john we're going to read the first verse down to the fourth verse of saint john i'm going to take my time this morning and i trust that i could bring a real serious message to you because we're living in a serious time and so we enjoy the but word is doing something we will all agree that god has opened the seal and he has brought us a message of eternal life in this message here in saint john beginning at the first verse saint john in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god elite all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life on him and the life was the light of men amen let us pray father god once again we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy you've been so good to us hallelujah and you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves father we just pray that your perfect will be done in your name jesus christ amen i intended for brother keith to come and pray with me but anyway god knows sorry i missed that brother you love the lord you know i'm i'm excited inside you sweet we had a wonderful time there in arizona uh really reminded me of the old services that we used to experience where the people were so excited about god they didn't care what anyone else thought about their worship in i saw this young man sing a song and the holy spirit fell hello and the church pretty much abruptly erupted i'm putting him on the spot i know but sometimes we don't understand what we have defunded and i was just telling some of the brothers there saying it to myself if the people here would pull on god gifts whatever that's right right my concerns this morning are those that are concerning life when we think about life what do we think about in your way of thinking you think about life what are you thinking [Music] [Music] and none of those things are pertaining to life none of those things that we can achieve in this world could ever give us everlasting life everything that's brought into this world and the bible says that everything that have breath praise the lord god or life is the only one that can give you breathe is that right now the bible tells us that the word is life tell us that god is life juicy like not only is god life god is love that's what we want to dream and i'm going to bring [Music] [Music] the purpose for a light bulb is to bring light being the light of the world if there is no light in you and the light that i'm speaking of is the life of jesus christ hallelujah what is this light first of all we know it is the word and we understand that there is only one god right and the bible tells us that the god that we serve particularly became the word that we serve and the word and god is the saying it's just god conning sin himself into a lower state upon the doctor when we think about the word if you think the word is when it says in the beginning was the word so in the beginning was the word that's what john said and the word was with god and the word was god brother branham picked it up said it was a spirit he's a spirit that's why the bible said no man have seen him at any time but the son has declared him hallelujah and god the spirit the word the jews can never train hallelujah [Music] but i trust by god's grace that we'll understand this morning amen the importance of divine nature hallelujah amen listen he is god did you timothy put it this way first timothy um the sixth chapter in the 15th verse which in time pass he shall show who is the only potentate the king of kings and the lord of lords who only have immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto who no man can have have seen nor can see to whom be honor and power everlasting jesus christ to be as he was he in order to approach god is that right even the bible said no man can come to the sun except the father draw him [Music] so in order to understand what we're saying in order to understand god you must understand the mystery of god that's what people don't see there was a mystery hiding in there in the natural i couldn't see it but in jesus christ on jesus christ the purpose of god was revealed the objective the very nature of god we didn't even know god until jesus came jesus hallelujah we could have never seen him until jesus came just that's crucial because the bible says in jesus name well the fullness of the godhead bodily people have defined god in so many ways but let's just take it from the religious aspect some people say he's baptized some say he's methodical some say he's your overwhelming [Music] you see one of the things that we must come to understand when paul was talking about the scriptures and paul was talking about the revelation of the word i understand what paul was talking about he wasn't talking about the new testament because the new testament had not been written yet paul was talking about the old testament scriptures hallelujah because it was in the old testament scripture hallelujah this is why the prophet of god tells us that he's in the old testament as well as the new year now we'll read paul's scripture and we'll consider what he says and we'll think that paul is just talking about just the new testament paul is talking about the old and the news of jesus now that the new testament has been written off the time even but we did not know about malachi 4. there's nothing that can be greater than the world now if you can understand that then you'll be able to understand what the revelation is for us amen the new testament understand everything has to be in the book or anything but this is not the final this is only the beginning this is why denominations cannot fit the proof of the god or jesus christ let me back that up this is why the denomination cannot take malachi 4. in the world because they say we have jesus christ and we don't need no other people but what they fail to see jesus christ came again in the form of a prophet hallelujah the prophet was not god but god was called it clothed in him y'all understand what i'm saying and the way they treated jesus it's the same way they treated me hallelujah amen did exactly what the lord said he would [Music] you foreign [Music] who had a good life you had all the robbers who had a good life hallelujah oral robbers did miracles hallelujah but it was beyond that because we understand that william [Applause] had to produce there must be something on display [Music] my super [Music] [Music] hallelujah amen glory to god so you and i oh must understand [Music] it has to be separate a life that others can see [Applause] hallelujah even if they think you're crazy like they did i'm not john the baptist could say it's all right because you [Music] jesus jesus jesus was the true light that's uh john 1 9. saint john 1 9. well he was the true light which lighted every man that cometh into the world hallelujah y'all understand me now we come to a place that we understand whether you be weak or whether you're blind but understand by god's grace is true we have been called this life has been called out in denominations out of the organization for a greater purpose for them to yeah y'all understand me [Music] hallelujah but she when the prophet of god was here he gave [Music] somebody he's trying to do everything he can just stop this from happening she has literally been ordained can you imagine how beautiful eden must have been hallelujah and godliness means to be like god let's put it this way brother branham said god believes his word no matter [Music] under the nature of god you see we're not we're not looking at all of this everybody those of us who got our eyes and i'm going to show you in a moment right in the scriptures you know those of us who fail to keep our eyes fixed on jesus the jesus gonna get the man the devil is gonna get you the duck bumps out of society yeah you and i must understand amen that the scripture says that we must keep ourselves you know uh watchful through this guy what happens with us is that we always underestimate the devil hallelujah we always underestimate him devil ain't stupid the devil is not stupid he's he is the most intelligent on the other outsider you understand me in his worldly wisdom he don't suggest he doesn't trap you for peace oh yes he will he david says that the anointing of god is the only thing that would break yes and destroy the fowler's snare so satan is here to snare you one thing he can do he has the ability to snare you yeah but he can never change who you are [Music] brother branham says in leadership he said and that's in 1965 the choice of your conduct he said you you could he said can't mix it now you're either for god does it swap you or against and the outward expressions shows exactly what's on the inside you can't judge me about what i'm looking right the way i look that's what the prophet is saying your outward expression hallelujah tells us what's on the inside hallelujah many of you think i've got the baptism of the holy ghost i'm going to heaven he said that don't mean one thing that you're going you can have the baptism of the holy ghost every hour in your [Applause] and i'm going to get there in just a minute see a lot of times we think oh i've had an experience but listen that don't you cannot stop there this is what i'm talking about if you are the light of the world you are you supposed to express life among ourselves everything and you know how much too much it is therefore you're not showing the light of i wish i could make some of y'all mad this morning what i'm saying i think a lot of time we preach [Music] you and i and i do these things in love because uh yeah this is this is this is restoration where the alpha becomes the omega i'm not talking about in word expression hallelujah why because the early church walk like christ so much so that the people call them christians you know that scripture is true my question is to you [Music] is there anybody you know that would call you a christian i'm not saying you told him oh i am a christian and say say like they said your speech berate thee the way you talk gives you away hallelujah listen i've had witches come to me and they said how long you've been saying you're committed how long you've been a christian i said how yeah and like brother branham said they're going to you can you can't play that down and if you don't have power or god in you you can be in serious trouble [Music] hallelujah is that right is it right when jesus met legion what did he say call him holy man and have you come to do what he sent them to talk about us before our time so the devil knows where he's going you need to know where you're going hallelujah let me move on by god's grace i'm not going to be too much too long see we we've heard in peter the first peter and i'm just going to do a little bit on the divine nature because we've had a brother come and he's preached a good message but understand why this have to be add to your faith faith is that foundation you can't even have the holy ghost without faith quickens the seed quicken something every one of those virtues is a verb it's something you have to do as well you're not god ain't going to just you know lord just pull me through a tube no he's not going to do that right now you're being tried that's not where god wants us to be loved i hope you're being blessed this morning he said um his divine power you can go to first peter if you like to follow me there his divine power i'm starting at the third verse i believe it is have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness divine so you and i must understand that his power is his own authority his own will has given you this so and i think that's what's happened to a lot of people in the massachusetts they've been in the message so long they have become prideful it's something that pride is not a right have you ever seen a lamb that was prideful it doesn't come and you're not allowing god to change you you are i'm on [Music] we've got to come to the perfect statue of christ such a perfect decree hello amen and we've got to be if you don't say that just like rebecca come on come on we got to water this camera let's see what the prophet did now we got one was a and you had the holy ghost you are a real son of god see i knew y'all would get quiet it shows that somehow your vision has been marked with power that's what happened to the pharisees that's what happened to the sadducees they had hello he was in a baptist church now if god gonna give him the holy ghost while he was in the baptist church then anybody else that met with those criteria that he did god the holy ghost oh is the truth whether we like it or not because you must understand this is all about election anyway it ain't about what you think about it is what god has thought about it before the foundation of the world [Music] whether y'all like it or not it's to believe the first because everybody's going trying to tell somebody who's going to heaven even elijah said lord i'm all by myself and what day was so you and i can see the spirit that brings division he is then excommunicated it's what they do seek your i'm not even talking about the world i'm not talking about the churches i'm talking about go ahead y'all better understand what i'm trying to say he whom the son is set free is free indeed and where the spirit of the lord is i don't because i know nobody can put me in heaven god chose me and you know i don't have bishops i don't have a famous preacher [Music] just desiring the presence of the lord pride i had i think about it if you can't even make it right with your brother you've got to ought you can't make it right don't even thank god he's going to let you in the gate i'm not saying you're not saying but when it like brother branham said the closer it gets to the capstone the fewer the numbers like that song saying you can talk about me as much oh lord have mercy let's move on see i have to preach it i must preach this if we're going to go any further in this revelation we must have character you better understand it that power without character hallelujah that's what denominations do this is sick of being healed [Music] thank you see when when when paul was talking about the divine nature he said it was revealed in jesus christ basically what are you saying what the divine nature he put it together to show that humanity is meant to have divine elements what do you say we're not here to remain natural [Music] yet we're getting there y'all understand me i i get upset sometimes and keep the form but you know the thing is i don't like that feeling and god always checked me because i mean make it right make it right and that pride is not dead yet hallelujah but the scripture says basically as soon as you fall or come short you're supposed to do it immediately [Music] godliness goes beyond [Music] you don't do this you don't do that you know in that denomination i was in you couldn't even wear short sleeves and when i came to the message and saw how the people would dress i thought man how can they have such a great revelation to be so when they asked him how to pray this is if i can't do it here is that right what are you saying that's hear it but those of us who have been born again those of us who have had an experience you know that what i'm preaching is righteousness you might not like it but you know it's right we all but those issues we must come to how can i say it we must come back we become the victors we must become the victors not the you understand me is that right right now let me ask you a question now god is you understand what i'm saying you know how do you know when you fall in shock because you know you're like a firecracker an explosion when something goes wrong but we all go through it what are you saying brother all i'm trying to tell you this morning the word that brings you to that place of dying to yourself god your father in heaven is perfect hallelujah oh how we strive to be that but as long as you're in this flesh you'll never meet that criteria hallelujah but y'all hear what i'm saying the inner man will reach the level of brotherly kindness hallelujah and then god will come down and count [Music] right satan has stolen your joy listen there can be no absolute perfection in regards to we be in the sinful flesh because if that was possible was it yeah we wouldn't need grace zealanders like us y'all need great who need great focus you know it comes to a place and you know i don't want to go there let me let me move on how do we come to understand what god is requiring schedule one thing that god has done for us that he didn't do for others he gave us a prophet and that prophet gave us the word of god and that prophet told us exactly what god is looking for the most mature youth that god is going to make a curve for you when you get ready to grade you oh i'm going to curb them they're not there yet but i'm going to curb them that's still young and immature i'm in her image so you and i got to understand the weeks before we even take god for granted we do just what israel did god bless them they had nice clothes never wore out shoes that didn't go bad real good didn't have to go to the hospital and because of all of that goodness they thought they were saying but they couldn't keep their mouth shut hello and that's the problem we can't keep our mouth shut we do too much gossiping we do too much back fighting and i say we cause it goes everywhere hallelujah and we fail to see all of that murmuring and complaining against your character building mount sure what happened to israel they murdered and she got upset because she was going through a menopause and she wanted brother to whip him and brother said oh she slammed the door in his face he said you raising yourself hello the prophet murmured and complained judged her went beyond the prophet went beyond the prophet and told the prophet of god go tell her i did not whenever whenever you get out of the purpose of god you are in trouble [Music] see but we feel like oh i'm in the message and that grace keeps him from destroying oh i know y'all like it everybody's saying amen see the revelation of the nature of god was received through the knowledge of christ god in christ god in you amen and when god was in christ what did you see yeah is that right jesus said i can't do nothing except the father show me himself accept and be revealed to me by my father hallelujah and what we need to understand yes is that the revelation of god through christ being manifested as jesus come jesus then god comes along and he now becomes a son of man hallelujah and that that son of man amen takes on the the position of a son of man now he revealed that it doesn't end there because rebecca's feel must be made manifest hallelujah esther need to be made manifest hallelujah those women of the bible were set there as an example must be made manifest [Music] because you got the nature of a cat you got the nature of the dog the nature of a bird you got the nature of the lamb you got the nature of a goat all those natures are different so you cannot have the nature of laodicea or the nature of the pentecostal church going by and expect amen god to take you when he's looking for a different kind of nature [Music] that god expect never will you see a cat and a dog the natures are different and in order for god to mate with you you've got to have a change of your nature you understand what i'm saying that's how serious it is you know we can say oh amazing grace it is great but grace gives you that time in that opportunity [Music] unto us exceeding great and precious promise and i'm almost done you know we we've seen you know through william brown's ministry blind eyes open that wasn't just for him that was for you that's like reading the woman at the web hallelujah the same scenario the same thing amen we've seen the dead raised that wasn't just for william brown he did that so you can reflect back [Music] the knew there was a generation that was going to come after him they needed to believe what he was who he was who was in him they didn't deceive the ungod the god unveiled will you deceive believe that christ and to know that that same jesus same christ wanted to occupy their their soul that's the but you know we like uh how can i say it we want to ride alone it's not supposed to be that way what do you mean i remember when i was a pentecostal all we thought about was women all we thought about was god all we thought was church we weren't ashamed but i find out in this message people just don't do nothing there's only four yeah hallelujah but what we do we refer back to william branham and god tell joshua he's dead now we know he's not dead is that right why you say that because everybody was so used that's good to moses is it doing all the miracles they don't worry about doing them themselves you saw what brother branham has done so you don't even worry about it ever happening again but in this day the joshua the streets jesus christ and he said get but now it wasn't just joshua joshua and his hosts it's no we're the army of the lord but we [Applause] the first and when god didn't give consent that is they prayed for that person and they came back to life hallelujah that was the will of god that's how brother branham did it he sought the will of god and when the will of god showed him to pray for that person he prayed for that person and they came back to life we don't do it we just think you know they're dead and they're gone am i right or wrong people i'm just i love you i'm trying to say something here you know it may sound rough and it may even be fun i'm just trying to tell you we can't how many all know you can't get to heaven like this just think about what you are at this moment and you know and you understand what heaven is like you said well i'll get there by grace but that grace gonna bring you to perfection i'm gonna cut it short because i said i wasn't gonna be long but uh let me just let me just uh i think that let me add to your faith virtue and that you know the knowledge and all those foreign we know that that nature [Music] you've got to add those virtues right because that that that would bring you up the ladder right and and the bible says now if if that life is living in you you you'll not be barren you understand me so you'll not be barren you you do you have life and that life is going to bring forth fruits because you got to understand that those those virtues are the fruit of the life of christ amen into play now it says if those abide in you you you won't be barren in other words something's wrong when there is no light and no evidence of life and we have come to church you know we come in like something is moving us in the village but there is no joy there is no peace sometimes we come to church so disturbed you enter into the king's chamber with no respect hallelujah you see that was what made random tabernacles so powerful that they were so respectful when they came to the church the anointing was already there that's true i've been told many times my team would come just before of what the holy ghost was like and and you know it's it's amazing because i used to ask them how can you take this now when the anointing was so great being here couple of weeks ago i came in here and i felt such a void it scared me so bad i couldn't even get it out of my mind it was it was god was not happy and it seems like death was in the house i'm telling you what i felt and i asked the brothers and all had they felt the same thing they felt the same thing it literally scared me because i have never in my preaching life i pray it never comes back now what no evidence of life no fruits i watched the song leaders today singing don't tell me you don't know english a lot of y'all know english now i'm on somebody it was worse than a methodist church i came in and they looked like they were drunk off a new wine no wine was served what comes i need to sell you no that's the way that's the way y'all carried on but we're not recognizing we invited him he got here on time he was here when you got here before you got here he was here waiting and he because people he's worthy of praise your actions shows how much in love you are with him but let me go on because i'm almost to the point where i'm trying to come too [Music] let me see and i guarantee you most of y'all will be moving see everybody smile different smile cause y'all know i'm right right we'll just pretend you got dinner what are you afraid of listen god want you to be you oh victory yes he wants you to be if you enjoy you know i came to a church that only had 13 people hallelujah and during that season 90 of the church was white and black folks was coming and everybody else was coming to see what had happened to this term i'm just trying to tell you so you can't put it on color there were times that some of the young children saw jesus they said they saw jesus in the church and most of those uh young men are preachers and pastors now because we were [Music] let me tell you something you believe it right it would produce work exactly [Music] they even took a picture of what they call it that disease this message this message is it it's beyond anything you know what i'm just that kind of way brother brandon said when you gave him a a piece of the pie some of the watermelon there's got to be more of it it's got to be more of it give me some more that's my hunger for it this is thomas i gotta have more it's got to be more than a letter it's gotta be more it's because you got to understand by having this restored this thing is being restored because and that's all i'm saying is that if we don't buckle down and get really serious with god left behind nobody but your fault so let me explain this predestination just for a moment predestination is also based upon your own decision hallelujah will god predestinated me to be the bride in his mind you must have done those made those right choices y'all understand me because he don't force it he doesn't force anything on you hallelujah so if you don't make the right this is your hour he [Music] [Music] he said and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins she that you're not the characteristics are not in you acrylic actors see your belief becomes a religion now oh i'm in the message chances are you may fall back to the things you were healed from that god has a place in you hallelujah amen amen but one thing for certain god always give us a place for repentance and i looked up that word monument it is a building or a structure erected to commemorate let's put it this way how can i put is i'll leave it there just meditate on god but anyhow let's move on i'm almost done building the stretch you see it starts off with the foundation stone constructs that you've wasted then they're waiting for the headstone which is love but god is love and he controls he controls and he is the strength of every one of these things so how are you going to make it if you don't know and i i brought this down i can't i'm i'm close with this forgive me for lying i didn't mean to do that i will if a man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth god loves his brother one more scripture two more together first john 1 5. this then is the message we which we have heard of him and declared unto you that god is light and in but this is the message that you heard from the beginning that we love one another do i have it right he sometimes you don't know that you have problems and i'm going to tell you how you know you've got this problem when you see them and you get this strange feeling it was advanced and it's not one of joy and happiness that means you got a problem with that individual and that means you need to get that straight and the bible says like if you think a brother has a that maybe i'll say it like this it's really difficult many of you have come from churches that were so large certain things were not attended attended to yeah certain things were taken care of i mean what you understand what i mean these little things that i'm preaching it may seem like it's not a value but it's very important the but i know just say i use just trouble in my own family my grandchildren to tell you when i misjudged them i go back and i tell ask for their forgiveness even even my children maybe his own phone it may take a little while with my children but i always go back and ask for their forgiveness you see i'm nobody a compliment my son gave me not long ago and he said to me daddy if you don't make it i don't know where i stand when he was a teenager we used to butt heads like rams he thought what he saw on the day hallelujah but i was on the phone with him mr telephone number three he lives in california i was on the phone with him you're talking about god ladies and gentlemen the holy ghost dropped on him right there in his room so don't tell me if you're thirsting for god god ain't going to fill you he will fill you and you don't have to be in a church building again all i'm saying is there is not one person in here i want to see this rapture yeah i'd rather you said with me i already have an attitude [Music] the the changing of chamberlain and all of those who were telling her what she needed to do i don't think she made it but she didn't she just wanted to know what to do that's the way we ought to be with god all hallelujah amazing grace shall always be my song of grace [Music] for it was grace that brought my liberty how he looked beyond all of my thoughts and saw my [Music] foreign [Music] where jesus died for me [Music] [Applause] [Music] think about it raise me foreign [Applause] [Music] just how he came to love he looked beyond all my thoughts [Music] i
