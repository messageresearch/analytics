[34:27] Amen.
[34:29] I've preached maybe like six, seven
[34:31] times, but every time I get up there, it
[34:33] always feels like it's my first time.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; Always gets very nervous in the
[34:40] beginning.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; But you just pray for me.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our head.
[34:49] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus Christ, we
[34:51] come before you as humbly as we know
[34:53] how.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; In your precious name, the name of our
[34:57] Lord Jesus Christ.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord, your word says,
[35:01] "Whatsoever you do in deeds or in words,
[35:04] do it all in the name of Jesus Christ.
[35:09] Lord, we sing in the name of Jesus
[35:11] Christ.
[35:13] We prayed in the name of Jesus Christ.
[35:16] We live in the name of Jesus Christ.
[35:19] And now, Father Lord, we want to preach
[35:21] in the name of Jesus.
[35:23] Heavenly Father, Lord, I pray that you
[35:25] help me to put myself out of the way,
[35:30] that you may use my leaves to speak to
[35:32] your people, Lord Jesus,
[35:35] that you may use their hearts to receive
[35:37] your word.
[35:39] Lord, you know what they came for? They
[35:41] came to hear from you and
[35:46] And I pray that you grant their desires,
[35:49] Lord Jesus.
[35:51] And I bind every spirit of unbelief in
[35:52] the name of Jesus.
[35:56] And may the word of God have its way.
[36:00] In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[36:03] Amen.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. We may turn to First Timothy
[36:06] chapter 4.
[36:15] and verse 6 verse 6.
[36:26] The Bible says,
[36:31] "If thou put the brethren in in
[36:33] remembrance of these things, thou shalt
[36:36] be a good minister of Jesus Christ,
[36:38] nourished up in the words of faith and
[36:40] of good doctrine where unto thou has
[36:43] attained
[36:53] by refuse profane and old wives fables.
[36:56] and exercise thyself rather unto
[36:59] godliness.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; You know, I repeat that again. Exercise
[37:06] thyself rather unto godliness.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; For bodily bodily exercise profit
[37:16] little, but godliness is profitable unto
[37:19] all things, having promise of the life
[37:22] that now is, and of that which is to
[37:25] come.
[37:34] This is a faithful saying and worthy of
[37:36] all acceptation.
[37:42] May the Lord add a blessing to the
[37:43] reading of
[37:51] my title for tonight is going to be
[37:56] feats for the task that's a that is at
[37:58] hand.
[38:04] So feeds for the task at hand.
[38:10] And I got inspired by uh this quote of
[38:12] the prophet
[38:15] just once more Lord.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "And I have hoped that
[38:22] I haven't failed anywhere to try to do
[38:24] everything that I know how to do.
[38:36] for us to be in a better spiritual
[38:39] condition and physical condition tonight
[38:44] &gt;&gt; than we were when we come in here about
[38:46] four or five nights ago.
[38:52] And if I fail, God forgive me and you
[38:54] forgive me.
[38:56] [Music]
[38:58] So the thing that caught my attention
[39:00] here is that the prophet had to he says
[39:02] he had to do everything that he knew how
[39:04] to to get the people in a better
[39:06] spiritual
[39:15] and then he says the purpose is to in a
[39:17] better spiritual condition than you were
[39:19] four or five nights ago.
[39:24] So in other word, every time we come up
[39:25] here to preach, the purpose should be to
[39:27] get you to be in a better spiritual
[39:29] condition than you were yesterday.
[39:34] And that also means that you as
[39:36] Christians when you come to the church
[39:37] of God, the goal is to make sure that
[39:39] you get in a better spiritual condition
[39:41] than you were last Sunday.
[39:48] Because the Christian walk is not a walk
[39:50] where you just stand still wherever you
[39:52] are. You got to keep moving forward.
[39:57] Even Paul said, "Let us run this race.
[40:02] When you when you run a race, you don't
[40:04] stop.
[40:08] You keep going." But you notice that
[40:10] scripture also says to run that race
[40:12] with patience.
[40:17] because this race get gets lengthy
[40:18] sometimes
[40:22] and you can get tired.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; But I guarantee you that if each one of
[40:27] us here they told us that run one mile
[40:34] and your reward is each one gets $5
[40:36] million.
[40:39] No matter how tired you get, you will
[40:41] keep running.
[40:44] So the reason why many people stopping
[40:46] their walk with God is because they
[40:48] don't understand the reward that's
[40:49] ahead.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; That's why Paul says to keep your eyes
[40:54] on that prize.
[40:58] Keep your eyes on that reward
[41:02] knowing that the reward that we'll get
[41:03] is eyes and ears have not heard
[41:08] what God has has reserved for us.
[41:13] So going back to first Timothy chapter 4
[41:17] again my my topic is feet for the task
[41:20] at hand.
[41:24] God has a task for each each and every
[41:26] one of us.
[41:29] Each and every one of us we have a duty.
[41:34] God did not just come here didn't just
[41:37] send you here to sit on these on these
[41:38] chairs.
[41:42] God didn't just give give you the green
[41:43] card so you can just come fill this this
[41:45] seat.
[41:48] God didn't just give you the gift of
[41:50] playing the instrument so you can just
[41:51] come and play that.
[41:55] On my way to church, I was reading a
[41:56] quote or listening to a message. The
[41:57] prophet says that
[42:00] if you if you have failed if if you're
[42:02] not a son of God, you have failed to
[42:04] accomplish the purpose of
[42:09] God has sent each and every one of us to
[42:11] be sons and daughters of God.
[42:15] But but there's a process. You got to
[42:18] make sure you stay fit
[42:20] because Paul knew about fitness
[42:23] apparently
[42:24] [Applause]
[42:26] that he spoke to Timothy on fitness.
[42:32] He says that um he says in verse in
[42:35] verse seven, "But refuse profane and old
[42:39] wives fables and exercise thyself rather
[42:42] unto godliness.
[42:46] So apparently we know that god godliness
[42:49] won't just come like that to you. You
[42:50] got to exercise yourself unto god.
[42:57] That's why you got to that's why the
[42:58] bible says whatsoever is good as virtue
[43:01] you know whatsoever is good think on
[43:03] those things.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; That's why David had said that I've
[43:10] always kept you before my face.
[43:14] because he had to pract practice
[43:15] godliness.
[43:20] Uh let's keep reading that verse. For
[43:22] bodily exercise profitth little
[43:27] in this journey on earth some of us we
[43:30] have to get we have to to to practice
[43:32] physically to stay fit.
[43:36] Paul that only profitth you little.
[43:42] That means he has good. He has something
[43:44] good but he's just little.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; So like I I remember one time I know
[43:53] this one person he he wouldn't come to
[43:55] church on a Wednesday I think or Friday
[43:57] because he was going to the gym.
[44:05] That's what Paul is talking about.
[44:07] It profitth you little
[44:12] but this godliness when you exercise it
[44:16] is profitable unto all things.
[44:20] So when you practice godliness not only
[44:22] profitth your physical but also profitth
[44:24] your spirit.
[44:29] The Bible says, "Having the promise of
[44:32] the life that now is and of that which
[44:35] is to come."
[44:39] Because the Bible says that without
[44:41] godliness, no man shall see God.
[44:45] If you want to have a life after, you
[44:47] got to see God.
[44:51] But you have to be holy.
[44:54] You have to be holy.
[44:57] And and so let let me read that again.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Having the promise of the life that now
[45:03] is and of that which is to come.
[45:09] Why is he saying this exercise profitth
[45:12] in this earth and also the next
[45:21] let me give an example for some people
[45:23] that go to the gym for instance before
[45:25] going to the gym you have in your mind a
[45:27] certain image that you want to be like
[45:30] you have a certain goal that you're
[45:32] trying to achieve
[45:35] some want to just stay stay skinny knew
[45:37] someone I got muscles and all
[45:40] but you have a certain
[45:42] and when Paul this this this is the this
[45:45] is the mind of God what's written in
[45:46] this book.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; So when God is telling you to also work
[45:51] out spiritually he has a certain image
[45:53] that he wants you to become like
[46:00] and and again let's get back to it. It
[46:02] says this life and the life after.
[46:08] Brother says that there's only one thing
[46:10] that you take out of this world to go
[46:12] with it to the other world.
[46:18] He says it's character.
[46:21] Your character is the only thing that's
[46:23] going to leave this earth, this world,
[46:25] and go to the other to heaven.
[46:28] By your character, you can already know
[46:30] if you are going to go to heaven or not.
[46:35] Because if you commit fornication, if
[46:37] you're an adulterer, the Bible says
[46:38] there will be any there won't be any
[46:40] adulterers in heaven.
[46:42] [Applause]
[46:45] You know, if your that's why your
[46:46] prophet preached the message, is your
[46:48] life worthy of the gospel.
[46:52] Those whose life is worthy of the gospel
[46:54] will make it.
[46:59] And then the mistake that many people
[47:00] do, you look at your
[47:03] I'm sure a lot I used to have a problem
[47:05] with is your that message is your life
[47:07] worthy of the gospel
[47:09] problem
[47:12] because I felt like I was just guilty
[47:14] from the beginning to the end.
[47:19] I felt like I would never be worthy.
[47:25] That's true. you will not be worthy
[47:28] because there's only one person that is
[47:30] worthy.
[47:32] He's the only person that matters.
[47:36] So when you look through Christ then you
[47:38] say your life is worthy of God.
[47:41] Why? Because you are dead in Christ and
[47:43] only his life matters.
[47:47] But only when you die in Christ
[47:51] some of us are still living.
[47:54] You can't make it there if you're still
[47:55] living in the old flesh.
[48:00] This character won't make you there. You
[48:01] got to be a godly character.
[48:13] The prophet
[48:16] and Peter said that you need to build
[48:19] all these virtues so that you may
[48:21] inherit of the godly nature.
[48:31] Why? Because only godly nature is there
[48:33] in heaven.
[48:36] The entire family of heaven is named
[48:38] after Christ.
[48:42] nature won't make you there.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; My nature got to die.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; You know, only godly nature will make
[48:51] you there.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; So God is like, I have an image of my
[48:56] bride.
[48:59] I have this image that she needs to be
[49:01] just like me.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; But I need to give her a blueprint.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; I need to give her instructions.
[49:10] workout, exercise,
[49:13] but not just physical exercise, but
[49:15] exercise godliness.
[49:18] Why? Because I want her to be like me.
[49:22] I am holy and thou got to be holy like
[49:24] me.
[49:27] The prophet preached, he says that it
[49:28] was not the mountain that was holy, but
[49:30] it was the holy God on the mountain.
[49:36] So your life becomes worthy of the
[49:37] gospel when the holy God lives inside of
[49:39] you
[49:43] &gt;&gt; and he's willing to actually come and
[49:45] live inside of you
[49:48] because it would be so unfair to God to
[49:51] ask you to do something that he knows
[49:52] you you already cannot do
[49:58] willing to help
[50:00] because he knows that you cannot do
[50:02] anything on your own.
[50:05] Didn't he say the battle is not yours
[50:07] but it's of the Lord?
[50:10] The problem is that we want to keep
[50:11] fighting our own battles ourselves.
[50:15] But we need to remember that we have a
[50:17] God who promised us
[50:19] that he will never leave us. He will
[50:22] never forsake us. No matter comes our
[50:25] way, he's still going to be with us.
[50:29] It's a song that my brother wrote. It
[50:31] doesn't matter what you do. The love of
[50:34] God will not change for you
[50:38] before the foundation of the world.
[50:41] Before even your mother conceived you in
[50:43] her womb, God loved you.
[50:46] Why? Because you are himself. You are
[50:49] part of him.
[50:51] It will be very insane to not love
[50:54] yourself.
[50:57] The world when the Bible says God so
[50:59] loved the world
[51:03] The prophet says that truly God didn't
[51:06] die for the entire world.
[51:11] He only died for his only people.
[51:14] He only died for his chosen people.
[51:19] Because you got the the the Bible is
[51:22] full of types.
[51:25] The Bible tells us that when Eve fell,
[51:29] she was deceived.
[51:31] But Adam was not deceived.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; So Adam will Adam willfully gave his
[51:38] gave his life for his for
[51:43] he sinned against God so he could save
[51:46] his wife.
[51:49] So that's the same thing. God Jesus when
[51:51] he died on on the cross
[51:57] willingfully
[51:59] choice. He could have backed out of it.
[52:01] He wanted his wife to get some point on
[52:05] if it be pleasing to you, let this cup
[52:07] go away from you.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; But then he looked at and why did Adam
[52:13] do this? Because Adam gave his life for
[52:15] Eve.
[52:17] The revelation behind it is because Adam
[52:19] knew that Eve was Adam.
[52:24] was Adam.
[52:26] The Bible says that in the beginning God
[52:28] was calling both of them Adam.
[52:32] So he couldn't sit sit still and see uh
[52:35] if that
[52:39] why was that that was the Christ nature
[52:41] in
[52:42] nature
[52:45] Jesus Christ saw a part of himself that
[52:47] was
[52:50] himself that they were dying on earth
[52:54] to intervene
[52:57] &gt;&gt; and he he didn't have a choice but he
[52:59] gave his life
[53:02] Why? Because you couldn't go to hell.
[53:06] So why were you going to go? Because the
[53:08] Bible says hell was created for Satan.
[53:13] You honor Satan. You honor his angel. So
[53:17] God had to provide a way for you to
[53:24] what belongs to you.
[53:26] Heaven belongs to you. Blessings belong
[53:28] to you.
[53:30] Everything that God says is everything
[53:33] that belongs to God belongs to you.
[53:37] That's why you got to start looking
[53:38] yourself through the mirror of the word
[53:42] because you got to look at yourself to
[53:44] be like Christ.
[53:48] Peter says build you up into the godly
[53:51] nature.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; And God is a perfectionist.
[53:58] perfectionist.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; God doesn't start something that he
[54:01] cannot fix.
[54:04] You can start from faith
[54:07] to patience. If you stop there,
[54:11] the bride got to be just like God.
[54:17] The full uh the fullness of God dwell in
[54:21] Jesus.
[54:24] And now all that was in Jesus has been
[54:26] poured into Christ.
[54:30] Nothing was left out.
[54:33] Everything has been poured into the
[54:34] bride.
[54:37] That is a perfectionist
[54:39] perfectionist.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; You go all the way to patience
[54:43] &gt;&gt; and you decide to stop.
[54:46] I'm encouraging you to keep going
[54:47] forward.
[54:49] You got to keep running the race
[54:52] because you got to have the nature of
[54:53] God in order to be there.
[54:57] of says that only perfect love will make
[54:59] you there.
[55:03] Perfect love at the top.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; When you have perfect love, then you
[55:08] have the full Yeah. You have the perfect
[55:10] nature of God.
[55:16] The bride doesn't settle for a something
[55:18] that's just halfway done.
[55:21] That's why
[55:24] they got they received the baptism of
[55:25] the Holy Ghost.
[55:28] But the Bible says we go from from glory
[55:31] to glory.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; So you got to keep walking forward.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; So God has a purpose for each and every
[55:43] one of us.
[55:47] I told myself that I really I didn't
[55:50] want to leave anything out from my
[55:51] notes, but we'll see how God lead
[55:57] and it's just beautiful the way God gave
[55:58] me this message
[56:02] without even trying hard. He just kept
[56:04] putting everything together.
[56:08] While I was studying, I was I was
[56:10] looking for this one uh
[56:15] and I was I was so busy with with like
[56:17] studying other stuff that I didn't I
[56:19] didn't want to spend my time on that
[56:23] &gt;&gt; and on my way to church listening to
[56:24] this message and I find that same quote.
[56:32] So whatever God has for us tonight,
[56:34] that's
[56:37] so we are in a battlefield.
[56:41] You know, we we are in this battle
[56:44] &gt;&gt; and you cannot go to the battle out of
[56:46] shape
[56:50] because the devil is not something to be
[56:51] messing around with.
[56:54] If he was, then the Bible would have
[56:55] said, "Put on the partial armor of God.
[57:04] But the Bible did not say put on the
[57:06] partial armor of God.
[57:10] Put on halfway through your per the
[57:12] statue of a perfect man.
[57:16] Put on the whole armor of God.
[57:20] You may be able to stand against the ws
[57:23] of the devil.
[57:29] Paul is telling to the Ephesian church,
[57:33] &gt;&gt; it's not just enough to have a partial
[57:35] armor.
[57:40] You got to go all the way.
[57:44] No,
[57:48] &gt;&gt; God is building you into the stature of
[57:49] a perfect man.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; That's why he's asking you to exercise
[57:56] exercise spiritually.
[58:00] You know
[58:01] &gt;&gt; while we are on this journey on earth,
[58:06] we got to because we are in in a
[58:08] journey.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; We are just passing through.
[58:12] We have a mission.
[58:14] Every one of us has a mission.
[58:17] If your mission is done, then you go
[58:18] back to heaven.
[58:21] Go back to heaven.
[58:23] Amen.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; But
[58:26] &gt;&gt; in this journey, we see that there's
[58:27] there's going to be afflictions that's
[58:29] going to come along the way.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; There's going to be things that come on
[58:34] the way at us.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; But we have to be ready.
[58:42] We have to be fit for the journey.
[58:45] You cannot go to a journey of uh 500
[58:48] mile and you only bring one bottle of
[58:50] water in the desert.
[58:56] It doesn't make sense. You will die of
[58:59] thirst.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; And then I love the prophet tells us
[59:04] that God doesn't God doesn't do things
[59:07] partially or
[59:12] do you really believe that God will send
[59:14] you on this journey without giving you
[59:16] the proper equipment?
[59:20] The prophet says that God never takes a
[59:23] fully equipped man.
[59:29] But he takes that person that doesn't
[59:30] have nothing and he fully equips that
[59:32] person.
[59:36] The problem is we got to whatever we
[59:38] have, we got to lay it aside.
[59:42] I don't want my equipment, but I want
[59:44] your equipment.
[59:47] No, I don't want my will, but I want
[59:49] your will.
[59:52] David on the battlefield,
[59:55] Saul wanted to give him his equipment.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; But God had given David a special
[1:00:01] equipment
[1:00:05] that represented Jus,
[1:00:09] the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; God told David, if you take the name of
[1:00:13] Jesus Christ with you,
[1:00:18] The Bible says he represents the name of
[1:00:19] Jesus Christ.
[1:00:21] Nothing will stand against you.
[1:00:24] Saul wanted to give him a man-made
[1:00:26] system.
[1:00:27] [Applause]
[1:00:30] That's the reason why there are still
[1:00:32] Goliath challenging you in your life.
[1:00:37] God has given you a weapon.
[1:00:40] God has given you his name.
[1:00:43] So why is your Goliath Goliath still
[1:00:45] there?
[1:00:48] Is Goliath still there?
[1:00:50] Goliath was still there until David
[1:00:52] showed up.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Goliath started scaring the army of God.
[1:01:00] But when David who had an experience
[1:01:02] with God came
[1:01:04] [Applause]
[1:01:06] that challenges the army of God.
[1:01:12] That's what you need to tell the devil.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Who are you to challenge the army of
[1:01:16] God?
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; I don't know about others. I know that I
[1:01:21] am in the army of God.
[1:01:24] God will never take you into his army
[1:01:26] without giving you his weapon.
[1:01:30] his word
[1:01:32] says the word of God will defeat Satan
[1:01:34] anytime
[1:01:36] circumstances
[1:01:41] still there's
[1:01:44] your own fault
[1:01:46] it's your own fault open your eyes
[1:01:51] you that's why God told Moses what is in
[1:01:54] your hand
[1:01:57] what is in your
[1:02:00] This word, this
[1:02:02] has power.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; If you take this into your heart,
[1:02:07] you take the faith of God and you
[1:02:09] believe it and you just leave it there.
[1:02:12] [Applause]
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; It's a double-edged sword.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; And there's not enough chains that can
[1:02:21] stand against this.
[1:02:26] enemy challenging you.
[1:02:31] Amen.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Take the word of God with you.
[1:02:35] Take the word of God and cut his head
[1:02:37] off,
[1:02:39] cut his feet off.
[1:02:42] Doesn't the Bible says if heaven causes
[1:02:44] you to if your right hand causes you to
[1:02:47] offend God,
[1:02:53] cut it off.
[1:02:56] But who causes you to who offends you?
[1:02:58] It's only the devil.
[1:03:01] So why are you allow him to keep talking
[1:03:03] to your mind?
[1:03:07] God is reminding you that you have a
[1:03:08] weapon in
[1:03:11] just come to lay in a in a written book.
[1:03:16] I did not just come to lay on shelves at
[1:03:18] home
[1:03:21] in the morning and say, "Lord, bless me.
[1:03:22] I'm I'm about to have a
[1:03:26] word to cut off the enemy.
[1:03:29] This word is a weapon to you.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; You got to use it.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; There's power in the word of God.
[1:03:37] There's power in the word of God.
[1:03:40] Put the word of God upon your lips.
[1:03:41] Nothing shall stand against you.
[1:03:47] Maybe the thing you need to ask God is,
[1:03:48] "Lord, teach me how to use your way.
[1:03:56] like because sometimes you can go to war
[1:04:00] and you've never used an a chemical
[1:04:02] weapon for instance.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; So if you use it the wrong way, you
[1:04:07] might blow yourself.
[1:04:15] So you need to ask God
[1:04:17] how come other people how come other
[1:04:20] people are able to take this same word
[1:04:22] and
[1:04:24] this become into a reality.
[1:04:30] Every uh uh scripture in the book is
[1:04:33] yours.
[1:04:37] It's yours.
[1:04:38] It's not just given to your brother or
[1:04:40] your sister. It's yours.
[1:04:44] Lord, why does he keep on having
[1:04:45] victories but I cannot?
[1:04:49] He's using the same word that that you
[1:04:51] read
[1:04:53] and sometimes the same word that you
[1:04:55] don't even read
[1:05:00] a few months ago. I remember
[1:05:03] and he says that there's a lot of people
[1:05:05] in this church
[1:05:08] who go even weeks without even ever
[1:05:10] reading the Bible.
[1:05:14] go an entire week without even opening
[1:05:17] your Bible.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; And we wonder why we have defeat.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; We wonder why we have problems.
[1:05:30] The solution to the problem lays in the
[1:05:32] word of God.
[1:05:35] But it's not too late.
[1:05:37] Amen.
[1:05:39] Thank you, Lord. that that Goliath needs
[1:05:41] to be cut off,
[1:05:44] that Goliath needs to die.
[1:05:47] We just read a quote where the prophet
[1:05:48] said
[1:05:50] he want the people to be in a better
[1:05:52] spiritual condition than they were five
[1:05:54] years ago.
[1:05:57] You came in You came in with a Goliath
[1:06:00] challenging you.
[1:06:04] Get you out of this with a Goliath out
[1:06:06] of your life.
[1:06:09] If you want to do it for you, you got to
[1:06:11] take things into your own.
[1:06:15] I believe
[1:06:18] confessing the word of God. God
[1:06:22] [Applause]
[1:06:23] cannot do this on your own.
[1:06:26] You cannot do this on your own. and you
[1:06:27] need him.
[1:06:29] He knows you need him. That's why he
[1:06:32] said come.
[1:06:34] He who are labor
[1:06:37] weary
[1:06:38] I don't know how to use this weapon.
[1:06:41] Lord I'm falling every day.
[1:06:44] I'm so tired
[1:06:46] weary.
[1:06:48] Come
[1:06:50] to me. I will give you rest. What is the
[1:06:53] rest is the Holy Ghost. Who is the Holy
[1:06:56] Ghost? The Holy Ghost when it comes into
[1:06:57] you with you.
[1:07:01] The prophet says that everything you
[1:07:02] need in this journey, you have it when
[1:07:04] you receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:07] So let the Holy Ghost fall on you.
[1:07:11] Say, "Lord, I receive you.
[1:07:13] Come into my heart.
[1:07:16] My goodness. I keep I cannot even get
[1:07:18] down. Oh, I'm still on the first page."
[1:07:23] Amen.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet talks about
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; how when he went to Africa
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; and he noticed how they have a lot of
[1:07:36] mosquitoes,
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; you know, and I can witness to that. We
[1:07:41] have a lot of mosquitoes back in the
[1:07:42] Congo.
[1:07:46] Sometimes when you you you travel to
[1:07:48] those places, they ask you to take a
[1:07:50] vaccine
[1:07:53] to build your immunity against it.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; But the prophet says that he had noticed
[1:08:00] that those natives from Africa.
[1:08:05] They had a lot of mosquitoes all around
[1:08:07] their legs
[1:08:11] with no vaccines at all and it was doing
[1:08:14] nothing to them.
[1:08:16] The prophet says that's what the mother
[1:08:19] that's what that's what in the message
[1:08:21] communion paragraph 105
[1:08:24] preached in 1962
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; he says that's what's the matter today
[1:08:29] with the people
[1:08:32] that's what the matter with the church
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; we got so many baby shots and man-made
[1:08:38] theology
[1:08:42] we are prayed over
[1:08:44] theology
[1:08:45] What we need is God's inoculation by the
[1:08:47] word of the Lord God.
[1:08:52] Men shall live daily by that kind of
[1:08:55] food.
[1:08:59] Now he's telling you this is how you
[1:09:01] exercise. This is how you start building
[1:09:03] muscles.
[1:09:05] This is how you cannot just exercise
[1:09:06] wanting to build muscles without eating.
[1:09:10] You know, you can't you have to eat
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; and and then he's saying that we need
[1:09:16] men shall live daily by thy kind of food
[1:09:23] build his soul into inoculation from
[1:09:26] spiritual diseases
[1:09:32] jumping around the country.
[1:09:37] You know each you know each country
[1:09:40] specific they have their own demons.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; You know in the Bible sometimes you see
[1:09:45] he'll says the prince of the this the
[1:09:48] prince of this place
[1:09:52] even when Daniel was praying.
[1:09:56] You know the angel came and says that
[1:09:57] the one of the princes stopped me from
[1:09:59] from getting
[1:10:03] certain demons that function well in
[1:10:05] Africa. There are certain demons that
[1:10:06] function well in the US.
[1:10:10] And one thing I've noticed a lot about
[1:10:12] the US that I've I I've never really
[1:10:14] paid that attention in coms
[1:10:27] that's very common in the US.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Why? That's why the prophet even
[1:10:33] preached on a message uh uh pressure the
[1:10:38] let us
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; letting off the pressure
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; letting off the pressure on on um
[1:10:43] letting off
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; because he noticed people have too much
[1:10:47] pressure
[1:10:50] a lot of things in your mind people
[1:10:51] rushing just to go
[1:10:55] pills and all those things
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; and it's leading you into depression.
[1:11:03] Because it says the from spiritual
[1:11:06] disease jumping around the country.
[1:11:11] This is spiritual disease around
[1:11:12] specific countries.
[1:11:21] comes to bite us. They usually get us
[1:11:27] and we get sick depressed.
[1:11:30] Why? You need to build up your
[1:11:32] inoculations.
[1:11:35] It wasn't the will of God for you to be
[1:11:36] depressed.
[1:11:40] God says that I have I have a good plan
[1:11:42] for you.
[1:11:44] Why? So that you don't get into
[1:11:46] depression
[1:11:48] so that you you prosper.
[1:11:51] And last time I checked, depression
[1:11:53] doesn't prosper you.
[1:11:57] Depression hurts you.
[1:11:59] [Applause]
[1:12:00] You
[1:12:04] too many weak Christians.
[1:12:07] It's not me, it's the word.
[1:12:10] I'm
[1:12:12] too many weak Christians.
[1:12:16] But we need to build up. We need to
[1:12:19] exercise.
[1:12:20] We need to get stronger.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; And let me skip. It's the same message.
[1:12:28] He says, uh, you can't have, paragraph
[1:12:30] 108, you can't have life only through
[1:12:33] Christ.
[1:12:36] And now what does his words do?
[1:12:40] Builds up our spiritual body
[1:12:44] strong as we commune with him.
[1:12:48] Why? To resist the devil.
[1:12:52] You wonder why you keep falling to the
[1:12:54] same sin over and over.
[1:12:57] Fellowship and communion with God.
[1:13:01] Communion with God.
[1:13:03] You only pray maybe once after two
[1:13:05] months.
[1:13:08] Once after two months when you pray, you
[1:13:09] never hear back from God.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Because communion is when both of you
[1:13:15] are communing.
[1:13:18] You talk to him and he talks back to
[1:13:19] you.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; That builds up your body.
[1:13:24] This is why Paul is telling Timothy,
[1:13:26] exercise unto godliness,
[1:13:30] confidence to all things.
[1:13:35] I encourage you to to to commune with
[1:13:38] God
[1:13:41] or Friday, Thursday or Saturday.
[1:13:45] Hallelujah.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Some of us even, you know, we have
[1:13:48] Thursday night's prayer.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; We have Friday night's Bible study
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; and some have zero excuses not to be at
[1:13:58] church
[1:14:05] and you wonder why you are weak.
[1:14:08] Zero excuses.
[1:14:12] You know that that what I mean I'm
[1:14:15] pretty sure if you know that look look
[1:14:17] at Delila and Samson
[1:14:22] she went after Samson's strength
[1:14:27] and that's what the devil does
[1:14:31] he knows the word is your strength
[1:14:35] he knows communion with God is your
[1:14:38] strength
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; because when you bought it it doesn't
[1:14:41] mean you're not saved. You
[1:14:44] protect so many little baby
[1:14:48] and the devil can just slap you every
[1:14:49] time he wants. But the devil is an
[1:14:51] abuser. Only abusers who can't slap
[1:14:54] babies.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; But the devil is an abuser.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; He keeps abusing you.
[1:15:01] But he knows there's a secret pill
[1:15:03] somewhere
[1:15:06] with God.
[1:15:08] Only if this child start communion more
[1:15:11] with God.
[1:15:18] Then what he does you away from that.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; You had a job that maybe paid you like
[1:15:27] 25 an hour
[1:15:31] and with that job you could come to
[1:15:33] church
[1:15:35] and I was like let me give him let me
[1:15:36] just add $5.
[1:15:42] And that way you just have to do a
[1:15:44] little bit. You just have to work till 7
[1:15:46] p.m. maybe.
[1:15:49] And we fall for stuff like that.
[1:15:54] When the Bible told us that when you put
[1:15:56] God first,
[1:16:00] I was reading listening to a message
[1:16:01] today. The prophet says always put God
[1:16:04] first.
[1:16:06] You'll never get ahead of him anyway.
[1:16:10] put him before you.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Lord, I've always kept you before my
[1:16:15] feet
[1:16:18] that I may not sin against him. That's
[1:16:21] why we fall.
[1:16:23] We don't have the Lord in front of us.
[1:16:27] If God is in front of us and you see
[1:16:28] that God is right there, I don't think
[1:16:30] you're going to sin.
[1:16:35] Amen. You will be scared.
[1:16:38] But sometimes we are not scared when you
[1:16:40] think something is behind you.
[1:16:44] Like if I don't know a danger behind me,
[1:16:46] I'm just I'll do anything.
[1:16:51] But when you put God before you, he
[1:16:54] becomes your shield. He becomes your
[1:16:56] protection.
[1:16:58] He provides to all your needs.
[1:17:00] And even when the food runs out at home,
[1:17:07] provides.
[1:17:09] The problem is we are not patient
[1:17:11] enough.
[1:17:13] The prophet says that God loves to
[1:17:15] surprise his people.
[1:17:17] God loves to come in the last minute.
[1:17:21] We call each other. We call each other
[1:17:23] the bride of Christ.
[1:17:25] But the prophet says, "Is that what the
[1:17:28] husband loves to do to his wife?
[1:17:31] Surprise her a little bit."
[1:17:34] [Music]
[1:17:36] And he says that's the same thing that
[1:17:38] God loves to do to his wife.
[1:17:42] But when we start seeing that our
[1:17:45] savings account go down to $1.
[1:17:52] Oh my god, I got to find me a job. I
[1:17:54] don't care to church.
[1:17:58] How am I going to survive?
[1:18:00] You've put the Lord behind. Amen.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; God is my everything.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; God is my healer.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; God is my provider.
[1:18:16] He is my savior.
[1:18:18] The reason a lot of thoughts keeps
[1:18:21] coming to my mind.
[1:18:25] The reason why the prophet says God
[1:18:27] allowed sin to come in so that you will
[1:18:29] know that he's a healer.
[1:18:35] you know that he's a provider.
[1:18:37] Sorry. So,
[1:18:41] so maybe things have come your way so
[1:18:43] that he can show himself that he is a
[1:18:45] provider to you.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. So some things God
[1:18:59] allows that to come your way so that he
[1:19:00] you know that he's God.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Why don't we have a lot of testimonies
[1:19:10] in the church?
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Ask yourself that question is are we
[1:19:17] serving the same God of the Bible?
[1:19:23] Don't look at your neighbor. Look at
[1:19:24] yourself. Why are we not having
[1:19:26] testimony
[1:19:29] testimonies in this church?
[1:19:33] God or a living God.
[1:19:38] That's right. Amen.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; You know, I hope you understand this the
[1:19:41] right way. I don't mean any offense
[1:19:43] here,
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; but sometime it even gets to me. I'm
[1:19:47] like, why does it seem like I like it
[1:19:49] feels like sometime I even refrain
[1:19:50] myself from giving testimonies because I
[1:19:52] feel like I'm the only person giving
[1:19:53] testimonies.
[1:20:03] God, the prophecy of God loves to show
[1:20:04] off.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; I had a situation at work
[1:20:13] yet, but I'm still going to talk about
[1:20:14] it.
[1:20:16] Like, I was talking to my manager
[1:20:18] because I'm a contractor right now.
[1:20:20] contractor.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; I've been doing so good at my company.
[1:20:26] I've been doing really good at my
[1:20:27] company.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Like everybody sees my value
[1:20:33] and my manager is really pushing for me
[1:20:34] to get converted to full-time.
[1:20:41] No full-time. And then yesterday,
[1:20:43] yesterday he was talking to me in a
[1:20:45] meeting
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; and he's like, "I really want to uh I'm
[1:20:50] trying I'm trying my best to get you to
[1:20:51] get converted to full-time,
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; but it seems like it's nearly impossible
[1:21:00] in this company for people to get
[1:21:02] converted to full-time.
[1:21:08] Nearly impossible."
[1:21:11] And when he said that,
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; I got excited when he says it's
[1:21:17] impossible.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Even though it hasn't happened yet, in
[1:21:23] my heart, I say glory to God.
[1:21:26] I know that my God
[1:21:29] specializes in what? The impossible.
[1:21:33] My God specializes in the impossible.
[1:21:43] You know, that was yesterday. It hasn't
[1:21:44] even happened yet.
[1:21:48] But I'm giving a testimony ahead of time
[1:21:52] because I know that my God cannot fail.
[1:21:57] I will give you the desire of your heart
[1:22:02] to get converted to a full-time
[1:22:04] position.
[1:22:05] I have been praying to get converted to
[1:22:07] a full-time position.
[1:22:12] you know, and it hasn't even happened,
[1:22:14] but I see it moving.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; But I don't need to wait for that thing
[1:22:19] to happen in order to give a testimony
[1:22:24] because a lot of us, a lot of people are
[1:22:26] afraid to testify.
[1:22:30] They're like, "What if it doesn't
[1:22:31] happen?
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; What if it doesn't happen?"
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Well, it's not my job to make it happen.
[1:22:40] It's now my job to make it happen. The
[1:22:43] Bible says that as long as in your heart
[1:22:44] you know that your motive and objective
[1:22:46] is right
[1:22:50] and your heart condemns you not
[1:22:54] everything you will and it will be given
[1:22:55] to you.
[1:22:58] We don't have a lot of testimonies
[1:22:59] because a lot of us are waiting to see
[1:23:01] the result.
[1:23:08] God,
[1:23:10] God loves
[1:23:12] Abraham spoke of things that be not as
[1:23:14] though they were. Abraham,
[1:23:18] you are the son of Abraham
[1:23:22] speaking things into existence.
[1:23:26] the unseen into the sin.
[1:23:30] What doesn't exist into existence.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; You don't have to wait. It's not your
[1:23:37] job to bring the word of God to pass.
[1:23:42] The prophet of God says that if if God
[1:23:44] doesn't keep his word, then he's not
[1:23:46] God.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to boast as if I have
[1:23:53] more faith than anybody. I'm not trying
[1:23:55] to boast as if I have more more faith
[1:23:58] than anybody,
[1:24:03] but remember
[1:24:05] in the court
[1:24:08] you're into a better spiritual condition
[1:24:10] than you were in yesterday.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; So you need to
[1:24:16] now it's like you don't have to wait.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want a specific thing.
[1:24:24] I come to church, praise the Lord. I
[1:24:26] asked for this, God gave it to me.
[1:24:28] That's not a lie. That's not a lie.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; The world is groaning for the
[1:24:35] manifestations of sons of God.
[1:24:41] The sons of God is the seed of Abraham.
[1:24:45] those people that don't for things to
[1:24:47] come to pass to give glory to God
[1:24:53] says I know my God can deliver me
[1:24:59] [Music]
[1:25:03] but it says that even if he doesn't
[1:25:05] deliver me I will not bow down to you
[1:25:13] as God for specific things.
[1:25:16] I have a testimony to give to the
[1:25:18] church.
[1:25:20] I ask God to heal me of this and I thank
[1:25:22] the Lord for it.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Whether his answer is yes or no.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Whether his answer is yes or no,
[1:25:34] I'm still going to give glory to God.
[1:25:38] You have to wait for that thing.
[1:25:42] That's faith.
[1:25:44] The song says, "Even though I don't see
[1:25:46] him, he's still moving."
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; We are a generation that doesn't have to
[1:25:52] wait for the scene.
[1:25:56] A man that has not seen.
[1:25:59] You have here heard the word.
[1:26:03] Lord, I take your word
[1:26:06] and I'm going to testify of it.
[1:26:10] Why God sent you
[1:26:12] to be a worshshiper of God.
[1:26:15] How do you worship him? By testifying
[1:26:17] his word,
[1:26:20] I am healed.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Even though I don't see it, I am healed.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Even though I may not physically have it
[1:26:28] in my hand, but I have it
[1:26:32] because I have the hand of God.
[1:26:35] If God has it is in in his hand, then I
[1:26:37] have it in my hand.
[1:26:39] If God has it in his hand, then I have
[1:26:41] it in your hand.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; We are living in an age where God wants
[1:26:46] to be one with his bride.
[1:26:50] The prophet say God does God does the
[1:26:53] prophet says God doesn't have any other
[1:26:55] hands by your hands.
[1:27:00] Any other eyes but your eyes.
[1:27:03] He has your eyes.
[1:27:05] God already sees it.
[1:27:08] What are you waiting for?
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; What are you waiting for? Just
[1:27:14] go forth with the word
[1:27:16] is mine. Victory is mine. Deliverance is
[1:27:20] mine. Deliverance is mine.
[1:27:25] Whoever the addiction is mine
[1:27:28] is mine.
[1:27:30] Desire in my heart is mine.
[1:27:34] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; It is mine.
[1:27:38] Amen.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; You don't have to wait.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; That's completely off my note. But God
[1:27:46] doesn't want you to wait.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm telling you, bride of
[1:27:51] Christ.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; If you start coming ahead of time and
[1:27:55] you start giving testimonies ahead,
[1:27:58] we will move in this church.
[1:28:01] A lot of people, we are afraid,
[1:28:04] afraid to trust God.
[1:28:08] that that I rebuke that spirit of fear.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; I rebuke that spirit of fear in the name
[1:28:13] of Jesus Christ.
[1:28:15] All those things that are holding you
[1:28:17] from giving testimonies to the gospel,
[1:28:19] Satan, I rebuke you in the name of Jesus
[1:28:21] Christ.
[1:28:27] Amen.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; The word makes you free
[1:28:31] whether you want to. You are free to
[1:28:33] give God the glory. You don't have to
[1:28:36] wait for someone to tell you to give God
[1:28:37] the glory.
[1:28:39] Someone who is free doesn't have to
[1:28:41] wait.
[1:28:44] I am telling you that your chains are
[1:28:46] broken.
[1:28:49] I am telling you that your chains are
[1:28:50] broken.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; You need to act like it.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; You need to start acting like it.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; The Satan is nothing but a bluff.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Satan is a liar. He's going to make you
[1:29:11] feel like you are still in chains.
[1:29:15] What I'm preaching today, is it the word
[1:29:17] of God or not?
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you, is that the word of God
[1:29:23] or not?
[1:29:25] What word says that the word has what?
[1:29:28] He that the son has set free.
[1:29:33] I will let you speak thy yourself. He
[1:29:35] that the son has set free.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is power and death, life and
[1:29:41] death in the tongue.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; You have to say it yourself. I'm not
[1:29:45] going to say it for you.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; He that the son has set free is free
[1:29:50] indeed.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; So if you believe that you are free, you
[1:29:53] are free.
[1:29:55] If you believe that you are free, Satan
[1:29:57] cannot stand against you.
[1:30:00] You are free.
[1:30:02] Amen.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Give God the glory.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Give God the glory.
[1:30:08] It's like you are free.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; The chains of Satan are broken.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Your addictions are broken.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; You are free.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; You are sons purchased by the blood of
[1:30:22] God.
[1:30:25] He did not die on the cross so that you
[1:30:26] can be still in chains.
[1:30:30] What did he say when he was on the
[1:30:31] cross? And when he died, he says, "It is
[1:30:34] finished,
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Lord." I still feel like I'm battling
[1:30:38] this thing. It is finished,
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Lord. I want to grow in my nature with
[1:30:45] God. It is finished.
[1:30:48] Why? Because if the Lord is your
[1:30:50] portion, it is finished.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; If the Lord is your portion, it is
[1:30:56] finished.
[1:30:59] That's why the angel told John it's the
[1:31:02] book.
[1:31:06] The word want to become you.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; The word want to become your portion.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Let's let's get back into the topic.
[1:31:30] talking about being fit for the task
[1:31:32] that is at hand. Being fit for the task.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; The prophet in the message is thinking
[1:31:42] on our ways.
[1:31:44] You know sometimes we may not be fit for
[1:31:46] the task that God has sent you.
[1:31:56] you know
[1:31:59] exactly
[1:32:02] but it's it's because of yourself
[1:32:05] and I'll give an example of someone one
[1:32:07] time
[1:32:09] duty that he was supposed to do of God
[1:32:12] but he was not fit for duty.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; It was our prophet William Brham. It was
[1:32:21] our prophet William Brham.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; You know, I'll I'll paragraph but I'll
[1:32:26] I'll paraphrase by reading from the
[1:32:28] message. Thinking thinking on our ways.
[1:32:40] I had a confession to make myself.
[1:32:45] I was I was in my home and some people
[1:32:47] had been bothering me day after day
[1:32:54] [Music]
[1:32:56] and a big office and they were and and
[1:32:59] just had me so worried. I didn't know
[1:33:01] what to do.
[1:33:04] Finally, I was felt like the world was
[1:33:06] pulling me the top of my head out. I was
[1:33:08] so nervous and I couldn't leave to go to
[1:33:10] meetings and meetings waiting and
[1:33:12] hundreds of Christians
[1:33:19] and paragraph 90 and I had went home to
[1:33:23] eat my dinner.
[1:33:29] They told me I could I could be off the
[1:33:30] afternoon
[1:33:34] and I was going to catch up on some of
[1:33:36] my sick calls.
[1:33:44] and there was the phone ringing. It was
[1:33:46] my private phone.
[1:33:51] My wife went to the phone and she uh
[1:33:54] went to the phone and she picked up the
[1:33:55] receiver and she answered and when she
[1:33:57] did, she held Sorry, my bad. My wife
[1:34:00] went to the phone and she picked up the
[1:34:02] receiver
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; and she answered and when she did she
[1:34:08] she said Billy it's them attorneys again
[1:34:14] [Music]
[1:34:18] and I said I can't go through it another
[1:34:20] half a day and I said I've told them
[1:34:23] that same thing over and over and over
[1:34:25] and over day in and out and day and so
[1:34:27] the prophet was frustrated let prophet
[1:34:31] You know this he said I was very
[1:34:33] nervous.
[1:34:35] Be careful what that spirit of nervous
[1:34:36] nervousness can get to you.
[1:34:42] And he says so many people waiting to be
[1:34:44] prayed for. So he had he
[1:34:48] wanted to go pray for people
[1:34:51] but because he let nervousness get the
[1:34:53] best of him.
[1:34:55] I said I said tell them I'm not in here.
[1:35:02] and run around behind the house.
[1:35:06] And when I'll come back in a few
[1:35:07] minutes, my precious little wife
[1:35:09] standing in the door, she looked at me
[1:35:10] and I know what she meant when her eyes
[1:35:13] caught mine.
[1:35:19] She She said, "Billy, was that just
[1:35:21] exactly right?
[1:35:26] That's the type of wife that you need.
[1:35:30] That's what a good wife is when you
[1:35:32] because it's it happens. We can get a
[1:35:35] fall.
[1:35:38] But you need a partner that helps you
[1:35:42] and you need to be humble to accept it
[1:35:44] too.
[1:35:49] Say you know you know how you like to
[1:35:51] justify. So the prophet says, you know
[1:35:53] how you you like to justify yourself. I
[1:35:55] said, "Oh, sure. I wasn't in here."
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; So let me explain to some people that
[1:36:00] may not understand. So
[1:36:03] I am in the pulpit here and brother
[1:36:07] Isaac picks up the phone.
[1:36:10] What? He covered the phone. He's like,
[1:36:12] "What should I tell what should I tell
[1:36:14] them?"
[1:36:18] The prophet says, "Okay, wait a minute.
[1:36:19] Give me a second. let me go here and
[1:36:23] tell them I'm not there.
[1:36:26] That's what the prophet exactly did.
[1:36:29] I've actually done that myself too. You
[1:36:31] know, sometime you want to lie for
[1:36:32] something.
[1:36:35] But you have to make sure you're in a
[1:36:37] position where that lie becomes the
[1:36:39] truth,
[1:36:42] but it's still a lie.
[1:36:45] And then um and the wife says she said
[1:36:48] Billy are you sure of that?
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; So wives don't be scared when your
[1:36:55] husband is getting out of line. Bring
[1:36:57] him ask him are you sure that
[1:37:02] [Music]
[1:37:05] the prophet said and I started out and I
[1:37:07] got my hats and I went down to make a
[1:37:08] sick call and I went into the room to
[1:37:11] pray for a little sick baby.
[1:37:16] man had been waiting a long time with
[1:37:18] this baby.
[1:37:22] So God had a task for the prophet.
[1:37:26] This baby had been waiting for a long
[1:37:28] time
[1:37:31] and I went in to pray for it.
[1:37:34] And when I started to lay my hands on
[1:37:36] it, something said to me,
[1:37:40] "Lay your lying hands on that child. Do
[1:37:42] you Yeah.
[1:37:47] [Music]
[1:37:49] You know the Bible says in 1 John 3:21,
[1:37:51] "If our hearts condemn us not, then we
[1:37:53] have then we have confidence in God.
[1:37:57] [Music]
[1:38:04] say what that the Christian church can
[1:38:06] get anything done.
[1:38:12] You know the Bible says you have not
[1:38:14] because you ask not
[1:38:15] [Music]
[1:38:18] but because you believe not
[1:38:23] because you have a condemnation in your
[1:38:24] heart
[1:38:28] it's hard for you to believe.
[1:38:32] Amen. And then u and the prophet says is
[1:38:35] because our hearts are condemning us
[1:38:36] with unconfessed sins. That's probably
[1:38:38] why we don't have
[1:38:42] a lot of unconfessed sins.
[1:38:47] When you start exposing the devil
[1:38:51] then light will have its way in your
[1:38:53] life.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; He says it's not easy for me to tell
[1:38:57] this
[1:39:00] but it's the truth. That's the way to be
[1:39:03] truthful.
[1:39:06] And I started to pray again.
[1:39:09] And I seen I wasn't fit to put my hands
[1:39:12] on that baby.
[1:39:18] So there was a task for the prophet,
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; but he was not fit for the task that was
[1:39:24] at hand.
[1:39:26] I wonder how many of us you don't even
[1:39:28] know.
[1:39:29] Maybe there is a sick baby that's been
[1:39:31] waiting for you for a long time.
[1:39:34] Maybe there's been a situation that's
[1:39:36] been waiting for you for a very long
[1:39:38] time
[1:39:41] and you show up to it unprepared.
[1:39:46] show up there not ready
[1:39:51] that God could have asked that baby to
[1:39:53] go somewhere else to get to get prayed
[1:39:54] for
[1:39:58] that baby still waited
[1:40:03] imagine that you know
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; there could be there are not there could
[1:40:06] be there are God has a work for each one
[1:40:08] of us
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; and eventually we'll catch up with to it
[1:40:13] we'll catch up to it
[1:40:17] But you got to be ready. You got to make
[1:40:19] sure that you are fit for it.
[1:40:23] Imagine they go ask they ask you to go
[1:40:25] speak in front of mill of a million
[1:40:29] crowd.
[1:40:32] [Music]
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; And the sound engineer only had one job.
[1:40:37] The sound engineer only had one job.
[1:40:43] and when you saw up there the sound
[1:40:45] engineer forgot to bring his mixer
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; and his speakers and everything.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:57] That's showing unprepared and unready.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; The time is going back. Let me skip a
[1:41:04] little bit.
[1:41:07] And then how does God prepare us?
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; He brings trials.
[1:41:15] You know, he brings trials. God allows
[1:41:17] trials to come our way to make sure we
[1:41:18] are fit for the task
[1:41:22] to shape us into the image that he wants
[1:41:24] us to be.
[1:41:28] In the message here, we have no
[1:41:30] continuing city. Paragraph paragraph uh
[1:41:33] 65 I believe
[1:41:35] the prophet talks about his baby Sharon
[1:41:37] Rose.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; He said and she was suffering so hard
[1:41:42] till one of them little fat legs was
[1:41:44] moving up and down in in a spasm
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; and looked like her little hands was
[1:41:51] waving.
[1:41:55] And when she looked at me, she was
[1:41:57] suffering so hard till her little eye
[1:42:00] crossed when crossed.
[1:42:05] And when I see that tender little blue
[1:42:07] baby eye cross,
[1:42:09] I didn't know it then, but I understand
[1:42:11] it now.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; He was going through a trial. He said he
[1:42:17] didn't understand it there, but now he
[1:42:19] understand why he had God allow him to
[1:42:21] see his baby with a crossed eye. G J he
[1:42:27] said there's never been a crossed aisle
[1:42:29] child come in line by what I think of
[1:42:31] that
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; you know but there's never been one pass
[1:42:39] over the platform that but what's being
[1:42:41] healed too
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; so the prophet is saying that every
[1:42:46] child that came to the prayer to the
[1:42:48] prayer line with cross child I mean
[1:42:50] cross eyes was healed
[1:42:59] I didn't know the crushing head to bring
[1:43:01] it forth,
[1:43:08] you know, but I never think of it till I
[1:43:11] see that.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; How many how many of us we we we don't
[1:43:14] know the crushing that's coming upon us.
[1:43:16] It's there to bring a purpose.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:22] I don't know how to interpret that. But
[1:43:24] it's to bring to bring to bring out a
[1:43:28] purpose,
[1:43:30] you know. You can come back here. Yeah.
[1:43:34] Come help him. Your voice is gone. Okay.
[1:43:37] Just try.
[1:43:40] Thank you.
[1:43:43] [Applause]
[1:43:50] I didn't know the crushing had to bring
[1:43:52] it forth.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we go through things and we
[1:43:56] start complaining.
[1:43:59] If only God could show us the future.
[1:44:02] [Music]
[1:44:03] You know there's a purpose for
[1:44:05] everything. Even what just happened here
[1:44:11] happens just like that with God.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; So let I will start wrapping up. Oh my
[1:44:21] god.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; So God has a task for his bride
[1:44:29] was looking for
[1:44:32] you know and
[1:44:37] The task for us is to be the bride of
[1:44:39] Christ.
[1:44:42] That's what God is calling us into.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; So let's read Matthew chapter 22 might
[1:44:51] be a little bit
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; because like I said he has an image that
[1:44:55] he wants he wants us to to come into.
[1:45:03] And what he did is he sent his messenger
[1:45:04] with a recipe.
[1:45:13] William, come over here
[1:45:17] in my image.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; I want my brides to look just like
[1:45:25] here's everything you need.
[1:45:29] Go get the bride.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; So
[1:45:36] where what scripture did I say? Matthew
[1:45:38] 22:1-4.
[1:45:41] And Jesus answered and spake unto them
[1:45:43] again by parables.
[1:45:48] and said, "The kingdom of heaven is like
[1:45:50] unto a certain king,
[1:45:53] which made a marriage for his son,
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; and sent forth his servants to call them
[1:45:58] that were beaten to the wedding,
[1:46:03] and they would not come."
[1:46:05] Again, he sent forth other servants,
[1:46:09] tell them which are beaten,
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; behold, I have prepared my dinner,
[1:46:16] You know, he's inviting them come unto
[1:46:18] the Mary,
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; but they made light of it.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Well, how do you make light of the what
[1:46:27] the messenger is telling?
[1:46:30] The messenger tells you come to the
[1:46:31] wedding. You do.
[1:46:36] They didn't go to the wedding.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; So, they did the opposite of what the
[1:46:41] messenger was.
[1:46:44] Every time you do the opposite of what
[1:46:46] this message is telling you,
[1:46:50] you are going away from the wedding.
[1:46:55] And the remnant took his servants and
[1:46:57] intreated them spitefully and slew them.
[1:47:02] Which verse? Verse six.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; And verse eight, then say he to his
[1:47:10] servants,
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; the wedding is ready.
[1:47:15] But they which were beaten were not
[1:47:17] worthy.
[1:47:19] Then go ye therefore into the highways.
[1:47:24] And as many as you shall find
[1:47:27] bid to the marriage.
[1:47:30] So those servants went out into the
[1:47:32] highways
[1:47:34] and gathered together all as many as
[1:47:36] they found both bad and good.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; I'm glad they said both bad and good.
[1:47:45] Because some of us were bad. If they
[1:47:47] were just going for the good, they
[1:47:48] probably wouldn't get me.
[1:47:53] Let me show that God didn't just settle
[1:47:56] with the good people. But he says,
[1:48:00] didn't he say, "I came not for those
[1:48:02] that are whole, but I came for
[1:48:04] physicians."
[1:48:09] And the wedding was furnished with
[1:48:10] guests.
[1:48:13] And when the king came in to see the
[1:48:15] guest,
[1:48:18] he saw there a man which had not on a
[1:48:21] wedding garment.
[1:48:26] So this man was not fit in the past.
[1:48:32] He heard the message.
[1:48:34] So hearing the message of the hour is
[1:48:36] not enough.
[1:48:39] and he even came all the way to the
[1:48:41] wedding.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; He went all the way to to brotherly
[1:48:47] kindness.
[1:48:52] But he was missing the wedding garment
[1:48:58] is when you wear the full perfect
[1:49:08] some it's good to shout
[1:49:12] the prophet says you only do those
[1:49:14] things because you have faith
[1:49:18] but that's not enough. You got to keep
[1:49:19] going.
[1:49:23] This man was not fit to be the bride
[1:49:27] because to be to be the bride you had to
[1:49:29] wear the garment.
[1:49:32] What is the is the godly nature
[1:49:36] that nature Paul is telling us to
[1:49:38] exercise our faith.
[1:49:43] And notice the Bible says the bride made
[1:49:46] herself ready.
[1:49:50] No. Then said the king to the servant,
[1:49:52] buy him hand food. And so pretty much
[1:49:54] they threw in
[1:49:57] for many called but few are children.
[1:50:02] Many have heard the message of the hour
[1:50:06] build built up churches of like 300
[1:50:08] people.
[1:50:10] Some left the message.
[1:50:12] Some have come all the way.
[1:50:17] But they just got tired. I'm so tired.
[1:50:21] I keep hearing about the Lord is coming.
[1:50:25] We just keep going to church.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm tired. I'm tired,
[1:50:31] you know.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; But they fail to miss
[1:50:35] that last part there
[1:50:37] is Christ himself
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; because Christ is God is love.
[1:50:42] You know, you know this thing, this man
[1:50:44] came all the way, but he was missing
[1:50:46] perfect love.
[1:50:52] The recipe to his messenger,
[1:50:54] the right measurement.
[1:51:00] The message of the hour has the right
[1:51:02] measurement you need to make yourself.
[1:51:07] And he's giving you this this
[1:51:08] measurements.
[1:51:10] And he says, "Go by the dress.
[1:51:14] But you know what I love?
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Because you notice God went to those
[1:51:17] nobodies.
[1:51:21] They don't they didn't have any money.
[1:51:24] We we didn't have nothing. God gave us
[1:51:28] uh the the prophet gave us the the the
[1:51:30] instruction. go buy
[1:51:36] and then when we go to buy that thing
[1:51:42] the person that's selling it to us
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; tells us that Isaiah 551-2
[1:51:52] buy wine and milk without money and
[1:51:54] without price.
[1:51:59] But you know these people they believed
[1:52:01] somehow they didn't have money but they
[1:52:02] believed
[1:52:06] with nobody's going to the marriage of
[1:52:08] the king
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; but they still believe they still obey
[1:52:13] the voice
[1:52:16] there is reward when you obey to the
[1:52:17] voice of God
[1:52:20] and the way God says this is that they
[1:52:21] don't have to pay anything
[1:52:24] they told them that that dress has
[1:52:25] already been purchased
[1:52:28] the blood of the lamb Jesus Christ.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; I'll just uh end there.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; You know, and the first line in the
[1:52:40] recipe,
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; he's telling us that though your sins
[1:52:45] may be as be though your sins be as
[1:52:48] scarlet,
[1:52:51] [Music]
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; they shall be white as snow.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Though they be red like crimson.
[1:52:59] They shall be as who?
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter what your past was.
[1:53:10] It doesn't matter when God Jesus calls
[1:53:12] you. It doesn't matter who you were
[1:53:13] before.
[1:53:17] I am
[1:53:20] a living present God in your life.
[1:53:25] Daily you live in the presence of God.
[1:53:29] You may stand.
[1:53:32] Hallelujah.
[1:53:37] There
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; there is a task that is at hand.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; Each Christian has a duty that he has to
[1:53:43] fulfill.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; But you got to exercise yourself.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; You have to get ready.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, help me be ready.
[1:53:55] The bride made herself ready
[1:53:59] and the enemy is going to distract you
[1:54:01] from getting ready for the task that
[1:54:07] we one task
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; is to make you to the right
[1:54:15] and the devil is going to make sure he
[1:54:17] distracts you from that
[1:54:21] because when God when Christ came,
[1:54:24] you know, He was like a thief in the
[1:54:26] night to those that didn't they weren't
[1:54:28] watching.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; The prophet says that Jesus only comes
[1:54:35] for those that are looking for
[1:54:41] Lord. Help me get ready.
[1:54:45] Lord, I want to be the bride that you
[1:54:47] envision.
[1:54:52] Make me after your will. Anything
[1:54:56] that is in me that's against your word,
[1:54:58] take it out.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Lord, maybe I'm just at my faith level
[1:55:03] yet.
[1:55:06] Add virtue unto me.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, maybe I just have virtue.
[1:55:13] Lord, I have temperance. I
[1:55:16] wait up on the Lord.
[1:55:19] Because when you wait up on the Lord,
[1:55:24] So you know when you work out
[1:55:27] proper sleep so that your muscles be
[1:55:29] built.
[1:55:35] When you wait on the Lord
[1:55:38] are renewed. Then whenever I wait on the
[1:55:41] Lord then add on to me godliness
[1:55:46] and brotherly kindness
[1:55:48] and above all Lord.
[1:55:52] Because if I have all this and I don't
[1:55:53] have you,
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; I pray that
[1:56:03] next time you come to church hopefully,
[1:56:05] but the word of God
[1:56:08] get in a place
[1:56:10] ago even a few hours ago.
[1:56:21] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus,
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; we thank you for your word.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, heavenly father, Lord, your word
[1:56:30] will not return void
[1:56:33] duty for us to fulfill
[1:56:35] and you want us to get ready Lord.
[1:56:39] Many a lot of us have been slack,
[1:56:43] lazy. You have given us all the tools
[1:56:48] to be ready.
[1:56:53] Lord, help us to eat your word daily.
[1:56:58] Help us to commune daily with you
[1:57:03] so that we may build resistance against
[1:57:04] the devil.
[1:57:08] Lord, I pray that you bless this church
[1:57:11] and I pray that heavenly father, Lord,
[1:57:13] you make yourself p personally known to
[1:57:15] each and every one of them.
[1:57:19] Lord, I'm really crying out that each
[1:57:21] and every one of them have a special
[1:57:24] experience with you.
[1:57:29] That when they come to church, they
[1:57:31] don't have to wait for people to ask
[1:57:32] them to sing.
[1:57:35] They need to be told to pray
[1:57:39] to be stimulated to say amen.
[1:57:42] But what you have done for them
[1:57:45] is enough to get them to say amen. what
[1:57:48] you have done for them is enough to get
[1:57:50] them to sing,
[1:57:53] enough to get them to worship.
[1:57:55] Lord, I break the tears of the enemy.
[1:57:58] And I pray that the spirit of God move
[1:58:00] freely in this place of Jesus and that
[1:58:03] you penetrate the hearts, the deepest
[1:58:05] places of the heart,
[1:58:07] and those places where there are
[1:58:09] darkness,
[1:58:10] I pray that you shine your lights there,
[1:58:12] Lord,
[1:58:15] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:58:18] Amen.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful message.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Came to church quite tired.
[1:58:38] We appreciate the help.
[1:58:42] [Applause]
[1:58:45] I like that. I like that.
[1:58:48] I got my portion.
[1:58:51] I trust everybody else.
[1:58:55] We ask the Lord to give us something
[1:59:03] to
[1:59:06] thank God for the brother.
[1:59:09] thought he was getting off track,
[1:59:12] but he wasn't.
[1:59:15] It was God.
[1:59:18] Do me like that.
[1:59:22] Hold to your notes.
[1:59:28] I think God
[1:59:32] he trains us that way.
[1:59:36] He'll make us write
[1:59:39] and then not use any of them.
[1:59:44] Don't think it's a failure. It's all
[1:59:45] God.
[1:59:48] We thank the Lord for everything.
[1:59:51] Thank God for the baptism
[1:59:55] on Sunday.
[1:59:58] The
[2:00:00] hotel people were very kind to us.
[2:00:05] A little glitch
[2:00:07] we came through. Oh, thank you brother
[2:00:10] for
[2:00:12] this is last minute.
[2:00:16] You know I I text brother Sam.
[2:00:22] [Music]
[2:00:33] I know you enjoyed it.
[2:00:42] One thing I more than one thing
[2:00:46] I really enjoy
[2:00:52] the reason why we don't testify
[2:00:56] is because we got sess.
[2:01:03] No use in being ashamed
[2:01:06] of the glory.
[2:01:10] Tell God about it.
[2:01:14] The Lord is worthy of testimony.
[2:01:27] If it ain't nothing but Lord, thank you
[2:01:29] for my life and strength.
[2:01:38] pray for us and I leave out in the
[2:01:40] morning.
[2:01:47] I mean Friday.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; So anyway, hello.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; So that
[2:01:58] I appreciate that brother. We do have
[2:02:00] prayer. Hello.
[2:02:09] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:02:16] Amen. Amen. Does anybody have a
[2:02:19] testimony? Amen. Come on, brother. Amen.
[2:02:24] Amen. As brother is coming out.
[2:02:30] God bless you church.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; So basically prior to here coming here
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; I didn't really want to say you know
[2:02:48] right in that corner
[2:02:52] um I did come with expectation.
[2:02:56] I prayed
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; unexpect
[2:03:00] I think it was Tuesday.
[2:03:03] I was I don't know what I was doing. I
[2:03:05] was just praying.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; I asked God to reveal himself.
[2:03:14] I remember specifically I said Lord
[2:03:19] I said let Pastor Brooks preach
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; and let me hear something.
[2:03:27] And then when I saw lease,
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; I was a bit confused.
[2:03:35] I I was shocked because I still got the
[2:03:38] message.
[2:03:41] And if I were to write it down in a
[2:03:43] notebook, I'd probably have like 20
[2:03:45] pages.
[2:03:49] I tried my best to write this testimony
[2:03:51] down.
[2:03:55] Um so basically
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; after I asked God to reveal himself
[2:04:00] right
[2:04:04] started talking about depression in the
[2:04:06] US
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; I think I think
[2:04:11] now Satan had been attacking me with
[2:04:12] depression and I hadn't
[2:04:15] [Music]
[2:04:18] it was hiding all inside my life and I
[2:04:20] never
[2:04:24] All I knew is I felt off. I never felt
[2:04:26] true happiness.
[2:04:29] It's like I had to force it.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; Around 14, I figured it out.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; But basically throughout this whole
[2:04:41] time,
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; it was really hard to be happy.
[2:04:47] And only this year was the year that I
[2:04:49] realized that Jesus Christ broke all my
[2:04:51] chains.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; I was listening and I just started
[2:04:58] thinking
[2:05:01] down every testimony.
[2:05:03] I got four on this paper.
[2:05:06] So many were coming into my head. I just
[2:05:10] all out. But to give you guys a couple
[2:05:12] of testimonies.
[2:05:14] The first one I just want to thank God
[2:05:16] for every breath I take for allowing me
[2:05:17] to go to school. And
[2:05:24] a couple days ago, um, I signed up for a
[2:05:26] really hard class.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; AP World History and um,
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; AP World History.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; I was stressing over I was like, "God,
[2:05:37] I'm not smart enough for this."
[2:05:42] I didn't study. ideas about the third
[2:05:43] day of school. I hadn't studied at all.
[2:05:44] So,
[2:05:46] my peers would be ahead of me.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; And I picked up the book and I was ahead
[2:05:53] of them.
[2:05:59] I don't know how it happened.
[2:06:03] Let me see. I have bad handwriting, so
[2:06:05] I'm sorry. Um,
[2:06:09] what else? What else? What else?
[2:06:14] Um, so this this gonna be my last one,
[2:06:17] but
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; this one kind of goes back to my journey
[2:06:22] as a Christian.
[2:06:27] Before I came here, I had a Muslim
[2:06:29] friend who tried to convert me.
[2:06:35] The words that he was speaking or
[2:06:39] [Music]
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; so I started talking to my pastor. I
[2:06:42] asked him multiple questions on
[2:06:47] and then eventually I got over that and
[2:06:49] then I started looking at brother
[2:06:50] Brandham.
[2:06:58] probably knows it but I
[2:07:01] didn't want to believe in brother
[2:07:02] Brandham because my dad believes in him
[2:07:09] to have faith because I had a personal
[2:07:12] experience.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Now the devil
[2:07:24] I was listening to I don't even know
[2:07:25] which Sherman it was but
[2:07:28] he was healing people in the
[2:07:31] he was saying
[2:07:33] all sorts of good stuff like this
[2:07:37] doubting why you already won it's
[2:07:39] already
[2:07:43] my he came into my head he was like
[2:07:47] I could also heal the sick
[2:07:51] now I had read my Bible that day
[2:07:55] and it said something like
[2:07:57] cannot stand if it cast itself down or
[2:08:00] something like that
[2:08:02] a kingdom cannot stand
[2:08:07] in the book of Matthew
[2:08:10] if it cast itself down.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; So the healing that brother Brandham was
[2:08:21] doing
[2:08:24] There was no way the devil could have
[2:08:25] done that. The devil can't cast himself
[2:08:27] out. It doesn't like that
[2:08:32] have read the word that day.
[2:08:37] I would have had a much harder day.
[2:08:41] Thankfully, God helped me. And
[2:08:43] never been to this level in my life
[2:08:45] where I can hear God and I can hear
[2:08:47] spirit.
[2:08:50] Even when I'm praying, I've never I've
[2:08:52] never experienced it before, but I'm
[2:08:53] just hearing voices. I'm just
[2:09:00] brings me so much joy because
[2:09:04] here I could share it to my little
[2:09:05] brother Sam. I could share it to my
[2:09:07] friends.
[2:09:12] And that's the job that I believe God
[2:09:14] wants us to do.
[2:09:19] a great gift of God every single day.
[2:09:26] If you found a million dollars, you
[2:09:27] would tell your friends about it, right?
[2:09:33] I found somebody who could I found
[2:09:36] somebody who can take my life
[2:09:40] from being depressed
[2:09:43] knowing it was depression.
[2:09:46] from being anxious.
[2:09:51] He can change all of it just like this.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; I cannot hide this. I can't keep
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; I had never known before I came here. I
[2:10:02] had this testimony.
[2:10:05] I don't want to say it.
[2:10:08] Is like many of you guys here have
[2:10:09] testimonies. I'm like,
[2:10:15] that was the second time God spoke to
[2:10:16] me.
[2:10:19] I can't cuz
[2:10:21] it would be
[2:10:25] if I had all this.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; So that's the message I wanted to share.
[2:10:35] Praise the Lord.
[2:10:37] Hallelujah.
[2:10:41] My brother,
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; I I'm not used to speaking on the mic.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; So, but I'm going to try to say
[2:10:59] something
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; sometimes.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I don't like to to speak on
[2:11:04] the mic.
[2:11:07] I just want to say to our pastor
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; that God has done a lot of miracles in
[2:11:12] this church.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; God is doing a lot of miracles in this
[2:11:18] church. Maybe people just don't want to
[2:11:20] testify that way. But I want to say that
[2:11:22] God is in this church
[2:11:26] and every one of us always has those
[2:11:28] miracles happening to you.
[2:11:32] But it's always
[2:11:34] it's always people who are um just shy.
[2:11:36] They don't want to test talk about their
[2:11:39] testimony.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; And I'm one I'm one of those people that
[2:11:42] don't want to testify
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; and I can't just condemn people because
[2:11:48] I'm I just put myself in there as well.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; So when my when my job laid off a lot of
[2:11:58] people,
[2:12:03] And so I thought I would go back to
[2:12:05] college.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; And sometimes I was thinking I was like,
[2:12:13] if I go to college, so how am I going to
[2:12:15] figure out life? How am I going to work?
[2:12:16] How am I going to live with my family?
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; And so I said, I'm going to try.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; And when when I went,
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; it was not an easy thing to do.
[2:12:31] And so at a certain time I found myself
[2:12:33] with a lot of bills to pay while I was
[2:12:34] going to school.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; And so I was thinking where am I going
[2:12:38] to find money to pay all these bills?
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; And so I I told myself I will just uh
[2:12:49] come to church and and just uh keep
[2:12:51] coming to church every Wednesday,
[2:12:53] Sundays and all every day that we have a
[2:12:55] service.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:13:00] And on on a certain Wednesday
[2:13:03] on a certain Wednesday, I was thinking
[2:13:05] uh trying to figure out how to pay my
[2:13:06] bills.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; And so I said, "God's going to take care
[2:13:10] of it.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to keep going to church."
[2:13:14] And then so I came here
[2:13:16] and after service, I went home. Then I
[2:13:18] was still thinking about how am I going
[2:13:20] to pay my bills.
[2:13:23] envelope.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; And so when I got home, I found my son
[2:13:29] Aaron. He brought all the mails, all all
[2:13:31] the all the mails
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; and he put them on the table.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; And so I'm starting to read all the
[2:13:40] envelopes
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; and I saw one envelope.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; I'm like, what's this envelope here? So
[2:13:46] I opened the envelope
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; and the envelope
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; and when I opened the envelope I saw a
[2:13:52] check in the envelope.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; And so I was wondering where where did
[2:13:59] where who sent this check?
[2:14:05] So the job that laid me off, they
[2:14:07] already paid all the checks. They
[2:14:08] already paid everything. They had no
[2:14:09] debt.
[2:14:14] And so I saw that it's the it's an old
[2:14:16] job that I worked before that sent me a
[2:14:18] check
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; and that money allowed me to pay all the
[2:14:24] bills that I have.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; And so that's why I want to I want to
[2:14:32] give glory to the Lord.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; And the second testimony,
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; we have a lot of testimonies here.
[2:14:42] my son Neville.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; So one day I I woke up, my son Neville,
[2:14:49] I saw him limping.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; And so I asked him, "Why are you
[2:14:52] limping?"
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "There's no way I I can't even
[2:14:57] put his shoes on." Then I asked him,
[2:14:59] "What's going on?"
[2:15:00] Then I I told him, "Show show me your
[2:15:02] feet." And so when he showed me his
[2:15:04] feet,
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; I I couldn't even look twice.
[2:15:10] There's there was a lot of uh there's a
[2:15:13] lot of wounds under his feet there.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; And so I was wondering what is that?
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "I went to the hospital. They
[2:15:23] said they have to put stuff on." And
[2:15:26] they said they've never seen something
[2:15:27] like that on my on the feet.
[2:15:32] And so we tried everything we could at
[2:15:34] home and and nothing was worth it.
[2:15:39] I forgot it. I forgot about it for some
[2:15:42] time and I was not even looking at it.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; And so I asked him one day again, "How
[2:15:48] how's your feet? How's your food doing?"
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; And then he says, "It's getting it's
[2:15:53] getting worse."
[2:15:55] And so when I looked at his feet, I
[2:15:57] said, "Show me your feet."
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; When he showed me his his foot, I was
[2:16:02] like, "It was worse."
[2:16:06] and so he was still wearing his shoes
[2:16:08] going to work with pain in his in his
[2:16:10] foot and when I tried to touch
[2:16:13] when I tried to touch his foot he
[2:16:15] wouldn't even let me touch his foot
[2:16:16] because there was a lot of pain there
[2:16:17] was a lot of pain on his foot
[2:16:21] and so we said we're going to pray
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; and so we couldn't get to a conclusion
[2:16:27] anymore
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; and so he said because we can't find it
[2:16:30] oursel we're going to put God to the
[2:16:32] test
[2:16:35] And so we woke up one day, we said
[2:16:38] University of Iowa,
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; we're going to go to the University of
[2:16:40] Iowa.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; And so when we got there,
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; we we got to the emergency room
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; and the doctor came and he said he's
[2:16:51] never seen something like that before.
[2:16:53] He said they have to study this thing.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; Some people said it's cancer. Some
[2:16:58] people said it's
[2:17:02] And so they said, "We're going to call
[2:17:04] another department.
[2:17:06] Maybe someone has seen this before."
[2:17:09] And so we waited there one hour.
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; We waited for an hour for a doctor to
[2:17:16] come from a different department to to
[2:17:17] take a look at. And so a mother, a
[2:17:21] elderly woman, she came,
[2:17:24] she came and she saw
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; she just spent about 10 minutes and she
[2:17:27] said,
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; she said, "It looks like I've seen this
[2:17:32] before, but
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; but I'm going to give you some
[2:17:35] prescriptions."
[2:17:39] She told us there's
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; she told us there's just just one one
[2:17:46] place, one lab where you can find these
[2:17:47] prescription prescriptions.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; And he said it's in Iowa City here.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; And when we got there
[2:18:00] and so when we got there, they said no
[2:18:02] one sent anything from the University of
[2:18:03] Iowa in this lab.
[2:18:06] And
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; so we had to go home. So we went home.
[2:18:13] And so I asked
[2:18:16] and so I asked Neville, "Okay, can you
[2:18:17] call that lab and to see if they still
[2:18:19] sent something from the university?"
[2:18:23] Then he called then he called. They
[2:18:26] said, "Oh, they actually sent something
[2:18:27] here. It cost $98."
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; Then it said, "Nevil, can you buy this?"
[2:18:34] Then Neville said, "But because the
[2:18:36] doctors were not really sure, we can't
[2:18:38] spend this much money on this."
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; Then I told him, "No, just buy it. But
[2:18:43] with this prescriptions, you're going to
[2:18:45] get healed." And
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; so we bought these prescriptions.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; We brought the prescription medicines
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; and he put it on his foot.
[2:18:57] In just one week, he was completely
[2:18:59] healed.
[2:19:00] [Applause]
[2:19:06] And
[2:19:11] the wounds uh started to to get worse.
[2:19:14] The wounds started to to get healed.
[2:19:17] And there were there were there were
[2:19:19] fluids that were coming off of those
[2:19:20] those wounds. And now
[2:19:26] and so all those flu fluids that were in
[2:19:28] there uh hidden in there were started to
[2:19:30] come out and the the wound the wound
[2:19:32] started to get healed.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; And as we speak he's completely healed.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; May God May God receive his glory.
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. While
[2:19:48] we're at it, anybody else?
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:20:01] God bless you.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; Um, yesterday after work,
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; I got home. I was tired,
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; but I felt the need to talk to my
[2:20:13] younger siblings because I'm never home.
[2:20:15] Then when I get home,
[2:20:21] So, I called my younger brother Sam
[2:20:25] and since school had started, I just
[2:20:27] wanted to check up on on him and see how
[2:20:29] he was doing at school.
[2:20:39] wanted to talk about.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; And then he started sharing with me how
[2:20:46] like at school there's some kids that
[2:20:48] bully him.
[2:20:53] He said
[2:20:57] and that he sometimes like he also felt
[2:21:00] depressed
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; like thinks about like taking his own
[2:21:08] life
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; and he was just venting to me. He was
[2:21:13] crying, expressing himself. And I was
[2:21:14] just
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; I was talking to him and I was telling
[2:21:18] him about how he's about to start high
[2:21:20] school and that if he doesn't find God,
[2:21:23] he won't be able to have that assurance
[2:21:26] that he doesn't need um anybody's
[2:21:27] validation at school.
[2:21:38] Yes. I was trying to build him up, tell
[2:21:40] him that he doesn't need, you know, help
[2:21:41] from nobody. He has God. He has us at
[2:21:44] home.
[2:21:45] Anybody?
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I tell him that and then I pray
[2:21:54] for him
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; and I I ask God to to help him see him
[2:22:00] to help you know Sam see him in his
[2:22:02] life.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I asked God that Sam starts to
[2:22:09] have a relationship with God. Start.
[2:22:16] So we come to church today.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; Least talks about depression in America.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; And then he talks about how um in order
[2:22:28] to overcome that you need that communion
[2:22:30] with God. You need to have that
[2:22:31] relationship.
[2:22:36] So I'm in my head I'm sitting there. I'm
[2:22:38] like that's what I prayed for.
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; I asked God to show himself. I wanted to
[2:22:44] see the hand of God in Sam's life.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; I wanted to see him happier.
[2:22:51] So I'm I'm sitting there. I'm like God
[2:22:53] is speaking to me, but I'm wondering is
[2:22:55] God speak is Sam getting the message?
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; I want him to have a testimony as well.
[2:23:07] So, we're sitting there listening to
[2:23:08] everybody testify and he said,
[2:23:13] "Remember what we talked about
[2:23:14] yesterday?
[2:23:17] God did God did speak to him."
[2:23:21] So, that I mean that just shows that God
[2:23:24] hears. God, you know,
[2:23:29] God God touched Sam. God see God.
[2:23:35] God bless you.
[2:23:37] [Applause]
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; May God bless you.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; I wanted to testify as well
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; because I also keep a lot of
[2:23:55] testimonies.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; God is acting. God is acting in this
[2:24:00] place.
[2:24:03] First, I thank I thank the Lord for
[2:24:05] having Pastor Brooks
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; in the in America here
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; because that was our prayer when we left
[2:24:14] Africa.
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; So, he's he's a he's a simple man. He
[2:24:24] he's not he's not um like prophesying
[2:24:27] things like like other pastor like other
[2:24:31] pastors do sometimes as well.
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; But then I I I discovered a power in in
[2:24:39] his simplicity.
[2:24:42] I saw a lot of things since I came to
[2:24:44] America
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; and I saw
[2:24:51] with I saw a lot of things with the with
[2:24:53] his faith.
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:25:00] And so that's why whenever I have
[2:25:02] something happening to me, I always come
[2:25:04] here so he can pray for me.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; And every time he's prayed for me, I've
[2:25:09] always received the solution to my
[2:25:10] problems.
[2:25:13] And maybe
[2:25:15] I'm going to take a lot of time, a lot
[2:25:17] of time if I have to talk about
[2:25:18] everything.
[2:25:24] I'm gonna I'm not going to testify about
[2:25:26] this year, but I'm going to start for
[2:25:28] last year.
[2:25:29] I remember
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; and so I remember in my dreams I always
[2:25:39] saw I always had nightmares. I always
[2:25:41] saw death in my in my my nightmares.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; Every day when I sleep during the day,
[2:25:50] even during the night,
[2:25:53] if it's not me and in that death, it's
[2:25:55] my children, my husband.
[2:25:58] Remember, my family members, it was just
[2:26:00] people posting. That's what I was
[2:26:02] seeing.
[2:26:04] And so, I talked to a brother here in
[2:26:06] church.
[2:26:08] And that brother told me to see Brother
[2:26:10] Briggs.
[2:26:11] And he said, "If you have something, I
[2:26:14] want you to go see the pastor and he's
[2:26:15] going to pray for you."
[2:26:19] And it was on a certain Sunday we left
[2:26:21] church.
[2:26:24] I didn't even talk about it to my
[2:26:25] husband
[2:26:28] because I knew if I told my husband, he
[2:26:30] was going to uh discourage, discourage
[2:26:32] me, tell me not to talk.
[2:26:36] And so when everyone left, I went to the
[2:26:38] pastor's office
[2:26:40] and I found the translator and I spoke
[2:26:42] to the pastor
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; and the pastor told me, "The devil is a
[2:26:48] liar and we're going to pray." The
[2:26:51] pastor prayed for me.
[2:26:54] And after we left this place that
[2:26:57] Sunday,
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; I didn't tell anybody that I went to see
[2:27:05] Pastor Brooks to talk about those deaf
[2:27:07] deaf spirits.
[2:27:09] And so my husband told me
[2:27:15] and so my husband told me, "Okay, let's
[2:27:16] go shop in an African store."
[2:27:20] And so we went with the whole family.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; When we got home,
[2:27:26] said, "My son said, I'm tired. I'm going
[2:27:29] to go rest a little bit."
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; And so the children were taking the all
[2:27:34] the all the all the the bags from the
[2:27:36] car.
[2:27:46] And
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; so we said it was a Sunday. We were
[2:27:48] trying to get another fridge to keep our
[2:27:50] food fresh.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Okay, if I go home and and
[2:27:57] I and I rest, I'm going to be tired, so
[2:27:59] let's go to Sam's Club."
[2:28:04] Then my husband told Jar, "Okay, come to
[2:28:06] come with me." Then Jar said, "I'm I'm
[2:28:07] tired. I I need a rest."
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; And so he told him to to remove all all
[2:28:15] the bags from the car. So he
[2:28:20] And so the children were standing behind
[2:28:22] the car,
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; they were taking those bags from the
[2:28:28] car.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; And so the person who was in my husband
[2:28:35] who was in in the in the on the on the
[2:28:37] steering wheel, he thought that people
[2:28:39] the kids already took everything from
[2:28:41] the bag from the car.
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; And so he said, "Well, we can go now.
[2:28:48] And so we said I told him, "Well, let's
[2:28:50] wait for the children to go to get
[2:28:51] inside the house so we can go."
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; Then he said, "Oh, there's no problem
[2:28:58] because I'm I'm going to go forward. I'm
[2:29:00] not I'm not going to back up with the
[2:29:02] car."
[2:29:08] And so when he started the car, the um
[2:29:10] the he had he had the the shifter was
[2:29:14] was set to go to go to go to back up and
[2:29:16] not go forward.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; And so he the car was on a on a hill. So
[2:29:24] he had to go up with a little pressure
[2:29:25] there pressure.
[2:29:28] And so instead of going instead of the
[2:29:29] car to go forward,
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; so the car backed back backed up
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; and Pauline was on the other side
[2:29:39] and was behind the car and he was taking
[2:29:42] those things from the car
[2:29:46] and the car just went through
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; very fast and so I don't know how dear
[2:29:55] how did dear God jump out of that place.
[2:29:59] We never we don't know what happened
[2:30:01] there.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; The car the car the car ran through
[2:30:09] everything that we all the bags that
[2:30:11] were there that were down behind the car
[2:30:17] there. There were also other cars behind
[2:30:19] us,
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; but he didn't hit those cars.
[2:30:26] Now, Diego was on the other side. He was
[2:30:27] crying because his legs was hurting.
[2:30:31] And I told I asked him, "What's going
[2:30:32] on?" He says, "Well, you ran you ran
[2:30:34] through my legs."
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; And so I asked him, "Can you still
[2:30:38] walk?" "Yeah, I can still walk."
[2:30:45] And And so he didn't his legs didn't
[2:30:47] were not broken or nothing happened to
[2:30:49] his legs
[2:30:51] &gt;&gt; and everything was good.
[2:30:56] And then so we were wondering maybe the
[2:30:57] camera saw us so the the cops will come
[2:30:59] will come
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; and so it just happened like that.
[2:31:03] Nothing happened.
[2:31:09] And then so dear God my son after a
[2:31:11] couple minutes said well my legs are
[2:31:12] feeling fine.
[2:31:15] And so I thank the Lord because of the
[2:31:18] prayer that the pastor made that day.
[2:31:24] When my husband was was was shaking, I I
[2:31:27] I told him, "You know what I did when I
[2:31:28] was in church?"
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; And I said, "I went to see the pastor to
[2:31:36] cast out those spirits of death."
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; And so I thank the Lord. I thank the
[2:31:42] Lord for that.
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; May God bless you.
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; And that he blesses the pastor as well.
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:31:55] Glory to God. Love the Lord.

[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; Did you have something, brother? No.
[2:32:02] Okay. Amen.
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. The God is good here. You're
[2:32:06] right. Amen.
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; Josh has a testimony.
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; Hello everyone.
[2:32:16] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm thinking if I should give it or
[2:32:18] not because of time, but I don't think I
[2:32:20] have.
[2:32:23] energy to do it any other times.
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; Um well, prior to we just started
[2:32:31] school, my third
[2:32:35] and early this year, we had a new
[2:32:36] government come in, right?
[2:32:42] With how um my school works, I am a
[2:32:48] sponsored
[2:32:52] which I use for my research
[2:32:55] being given by the government.
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; The new government that has come has
[2:33:02] decided to cut grants some research
[2:33:05] which is happening
[2:33:16] and unfortunately my grant was cut. Hey.
[2:33:19] So,
[2:33:22] so getting to the end of um last
[2:33:24] semester which is around March,
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; sorry, May rather
[2:33:31] got the message that my grant had been
[2:33:32] catched.
[2:33:36] So that means no more money in terms of
[2:33:39] tipants, in terms of pay, in terms of
[2:33:41] research
[2:33:46] with my fees included, all of that that
[2:33:49] had been cut.
[2:33:52] Now I'm doing a PhD which is supposed to
[2:33:54] take five years
[2:33:58] and I'm in my second year and the grant
[2:34:00] has been cut.
[2:34:04] Now there's a dilemma of how I'm going
[2:34:07] to continue this speech.
[2:34:11] &gt;&gt; And when this happened, it's not just
[2:34:13] me, but a lot of students and lots of
[2:34:15] schools had their grants cut.
[2:34:25] My professor was really worried cuz um
[2:34:27] she had to have her grant cuts
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; and I was part and she always kept
[2:34:34] asking are you okay? like
[2:34:39] and from the start I was never worried
[2:34:41] or shaking.
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; Knowing me, I've always been one to let
[2:34:49] God lead.
[2:34:57] My whole life has been a testimony.
[2:35:02] and I'm still living in that testimony.
[2:35:05] So I told her, "Oh, I'm okay. I'm fine."
[2:35:11] I probably because my professor
[2:35:16] and my other colleagues were also
[2:35:17] asking, "How are you doing?"
[2:35:20] I was like, "I'm not even worried. Why
[2:35:22] are you guys?"
[2:35:25] Anyways, fast forward a bit to get into
[2:35:28] the summer.
[2:35:32] My professor sent me a mail and she's
[2:35:34] like, "Oh,
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; there is this um organization giving
[2:35:40] grants.
[2:35:44] Can you help me write something so we
[2:35:46] can ask them to continue smog?"
[2:35:54] &gt;&gt; So I go ahead and I do that.
[2:35:58] So at this point I had already prayed
[2:36:00] putting the whole thing into the hands
[2:36:01] of God.
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; And as long as it had gone before God
[2:36:08] that was it. I wasn't going to.
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; So I left it and uh we wrote this grant
[2:36:16] and we sent it.
[2:36:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So within the whole summer I was
[2:36:25] having an internship here.
[2:36:32] &gt;&gt; Yes. And every time I go online, I hear
[2:36:36] people, you know,
[2:36:39] afraid and scared, I'm going to go back
[2:36:42] to school. And
[2:36:46] I have some of my friends who were in
[2:36:48] the PhD as well,
[2:36:52] their programs and take a masters and
[2:36:55] had to go back home.
[2:37:02] I mean that's how bad it is. Like if
[2:37:03] your grant is cut
[2:37:08] like I don't have any other money or how
[2:37:10] to sponsor you. So you have to find
[2:37:12] something else to do.
[2:37:18] So it's like you're left stranded on
[2:37:20] your own and
[2:37:24] &gt;&gt; and a normal I mean you being in America
[2:37:27] you probably be depressed and all of
[2:37:29] that
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; but then I've never had that
[2:37:39] for the joy he gives me.
[2:37:42] &gt;&gt; So during the se summer I got a message
[2:37:45] from a professor.
[2:37:47] She was like, "Hey Joshua, hey Joshua,
[2:37:51] congratulations. We got the grants."
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; And at that point in time, I had
[2:38:00] forgotten what was even happen at all.
[2:38:06] So I look back like, "What?" I was like,
[2:38:07] "Oh,
[2:38:12] &gt;&gt; I was like, oh, that's that's good." And
[2:38:13] I just went
[2:38:16] that day. I was driving home. I was just
[2:38:19] I normally do. I praise God.
[2:38:24] As I said, my life is a testimony
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; and I will keep praising him.
[2:38:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:38:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Amen. I think that's
[2:38:37] that's it.
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and close with a little
[2:38:42] song here.
[2:38:44] [Music]
[2:38:46] I could stay here long and testify also,
[2:38:48] but maybe we'll keep it for Sunday.
[2:38:51] Amen. Hallelujah. Let's just close with
[2:38:54] this little song. Come and dine. Amen.
[2:38:59] Jesus has a table spread where the
[2:39:03] saints of God are fed. He invites his
[2:39:08] chosen people coming down.
[2:39:13] With his man a he doth feed and supplies
[2:39:17] our every need. Oh his sweetness up with

[2:39:43] turned the water into wine. To the
[2:39:48] hungry calleth now come and die.

[2:40:50] To be at his side. All the host of
[2:40:55] heaven will assemble me.
[2:41:00] boat will be a glorious sight. All the
[2:41:04] saints in spotless wine and with Jesus
[2:41:09] they will feast eternally.
[2:41:11] [Music]
[2:41:13] Oh come and the master calling come and
[2:41:18] die.
[2:41:20] You may feast at Jesus table all the
[2:41:24] time.
[2:41:27] Oh, he who fed the multitude
[2:41:30] turn the water into wine. To the hungry
[2:41:35] callth
[2:41:37] come and die.
[2:41:40] Oh, come and die. The master callth,
[2:41:44] come and die.
[2:41:47] He may feast at Jesus table all the
[2:41:51] time.
[2:41:53] Oh, he who fed the multitude
[2:41:57] turn no water into wine. To the hungry
[2:42:02] call it now. Come and die. God bless
[2:42:06] you.
[2:42:07] [Music]
