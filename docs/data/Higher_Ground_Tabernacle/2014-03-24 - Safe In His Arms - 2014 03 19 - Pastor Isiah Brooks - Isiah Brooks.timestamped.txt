[0:04] amen of you how many of you have all had
[0:07] battles
[0:09] today I was getting ready to say if you
[0:11] didn't something's
[0:13] wrong the devil is not he's not an
[0:16] adversary of Peace he likes to try to
[0:21] discourage and torment the children of
[0:24] God but I I really like whooping on
[0:28] him I from being a
[0:31] preacher but now I'm glad he made me
[0:35] one ain't God good to
[0:38] us amen we're going to be coming from
[0:41] the word of God now remember we just
[0:43] ministered on the
[0:46] illusion uh of of the powerful illusion
[0:49] of Satan and and we we talked about
[0:52] Jesus Christ or believe on the last
[0:54] service knowing him you see because a
[0:57] lot of people say they know him
[1:00] but this know that God and what I've
[1:02] been speaking on is a intimacy it is a
[1:05] relationship that you have with him like
[1:08] for instance Obama is the president I
[1:09] know that but I don't know
[1:12] him right so the kind of knowing I'm
[1:15] talking about is to say well you know I
[1:18] know that person and he wouldn't do that
[1:20] you know a confidence that kind of
[1:22] knowing that you could have an a
[1:24] confidence and an assurance in God you
[1:27] know him so well and he knows you you
[1:30] right it's not some uh uh uh something
[1:33] that you imagine nothing no figment of
[1:36] your imagination it must be real and
[1:39] like I said on last week uh the Old
[1:42] Testament Saints we could get jealous of
[1:44] them but one thing for certain they knew
[1:46] God they weren't serving idols and and
[1:50] all other things because they knew God
[1:52] it was a personal
[1:54] relationship whether they could see him
[1:56] or not they knew he was there and and
[1:59] that's the thing is so many people are
[2:00] not aware amen that God is with us above
[2:05] us in us through us he's everywhere and
[2:10] there is no hiding place outside of
[2:12] Jesus Christ you love the Lord amen so
[2:16] let us turn Amen to the
[2:20] scripture according to uh Ephesians 3
[2:25] we'll go there
[2:28] Ephesians 3
[2:33] we're still talking about the Lord Jesus
[2:35] there is no other God outside of him is
[2:38] that all right I bow my knees that's
[2:41] what Paul said I bow my knees to the
[2:43] Lord Jesus Christ and so we're living in
[2:46] a day you better understand what I'm
[2:48] talking about because a lot of people
[2:50] think their organizations and
[2:51] denominations saves them the Bible said
[2:54] we're saved by grace through faith
[2:57] Hallelujah in whom Jesus Christ alone
[3:00] it'll never be the blood plus y'all hear
[3:04] what I'm saying amen so
[3:08] yeah I don't know whether y am I deaf
[3:10] tonight or we're not getting amens I
[3:13] can't hear your
[3:15] mind I can't hear your mind the Bible
[3:18] said bring forth fruits you know lips
[3:22] that's why you got those
[3:25] lips it's supposed to Make Some Noise
[3:29] amen you of the Lord Ephesians 3
[3:31] beginning at the 8th
[3:36] verse let's read the seventh pleas
[3:39] wherefore I was made a minister
[3:42] according to the gift of the grace of
[3:44] God given unto me by the effectual
[3:48] working of his power now this is talking
[3:50] about Paul unto me whom am less than the
[3:55] least of All Saints is this Grace given
[3:58] that I should pre reach among the
[4:00] Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of
[4:05] Christ it doesn't mean you can't search
[4:08] but the the thing is you don't come to
[4:10] an end of your search is it constantly
[4:13] move on and on and on because you must
[4:15] realize that Jesus Christ gospel is
[4:19] Progressive that's why so many churches
[4:21] and you know have become larges because
[4:24] they put a period
[4:26] behind what they believe
[4:30] God's word is eternal in order to stay
[4:33] with God you must put a Karma instead of
[4:35] period because God make changes you must
[4:38] make changes with God right amen so we
[4:42] realize by the grace of God uh here
[4:46] we're reading and and he says listen and
[4:49] to make all men see now he Paul is
[4:53] working with this because here his
[4:54] ministry is to make all men see even
[4:57] though we know that all men won't see
[5:00] but that's his ministry even as Christ
[5:03] so loved the world I asked you a
[5:06] question what world did he
[5:09] love right he say well well how can
[5:13] Christ love the world and tell you to
[5:15] love not the world we'll get into that
[5:17] in a minute and to make all men see what
[5:21] is the Fellowship of the mystery which
[5:24] from the beginning of the world had been
[5:27] hid in God
[5:30] who created All Things by Jesus
[5:34] Christ to the
[5:36] intent see he had an intention to the
[5:40] intent that now unto the principalities
[5:42] and powers in The Heavenly places might
[5:45] be known might be known there's a
[5:47] knowledge there's something God wants us
[5:50] to
[5:51] know right by the church the manifold
[5:55] wisdom of God according to the Eternal
[5:58] purpose of
[6:00] purpose amen which he purpose in Christ
[6:03] Jesus our lord in whom we have boldness
[6:07] and accessed with confidence by the
[6:11] faith of
[6:13] him is that all right let us pray
[6:17] Heavenly Father God we come before you
[6:18] Lord as humbly as we know how we thank
[6:21] you for your grace we thank you for your
[6:23] mercy we thank you for your love God
[6:25] you've been so good to us God you've
[6:28] been wonderful throughout out today Lord
[6:31] you kept us from all hurt harm and
[6:32] danger Lord you kept us Lord amen in
[6:36] under the blood and your promise Lord we
[6:39] thank you Father God if it wasn't for
[6:41] your blood Lord Jesus we all would be
[6:43] worthy of death and Hell thank you
[6:46] Father for your
[6:48] sacrifice Lord God make us vessels of
[6:51] Honor we ask these things in Jesus
[6:53] Christ name we pray amen you may be
[6:57] seated
[7:05] if I was to
[7:09] uh entitled this message by the grace of
[7:15] God I would like to entitle it safe in
[7:18] his
[7:22] arms you like that I can't like
[7:26] it amen if you would turn with me to
[7:28] Deuteronomy please
[7:30] please Deuteronomy
[7:33] 33 just going to read a scripture here
[7:35] now we understand by the grace of God
[7:38] how uh the Saints of old we talk about
[7:43] Israel uh we know that by the grace of
[7:45] God they they they you know at times got
[7:51] out of
[7:53] place and whether you want to believe it
[7:55] or
[7:57] not we who call ourselves
[8:02] Christians have done likewise as a
[8:06] nation America started out on Christian
[8:10] principles and and now we have become a
[8:14] heathenistic
[8:15] nation whether you like it or not it's
[8:18] true
[8:19] anyhow when you put God
[8:21] out don't trouble yourself with the
[8:26] consequences because you can look at
[8:28] Israel and you can look make it all the
[8:29] way back to Genesis when you kick God
[8:31] out there are
[8:33] consequences that you're going to face
[8:37] now you don't have to go to this
[8:40] particular scripture uh I'm I'm I'm
[8:42] going to read a little bit out of
[8:43] Deuteronomy 32 and then I'm going have
[8:45] you turn with me to
[8:47] 33 but the Bible tells us that in 32 and
[8:51] 15 but jesua un wax fat and
[8:54] kick thou are waxing fat and thou art
[8:58] grown thick sick thou are covered with
[9:02] fatness then he forsook God which made
[9:06] him and lightly esteemed the rock of his
[9:09] salvation now tell me if that's not
[9:12] America you see what I'm saying because
[9:15] Spirits do not die people do but Spirits
[9:19] carry on you could be this way God has
[9:24] blessed you so well but we
[9:27] forgotten where the blessings come come
[9:29] from see it's just like a hog he never
[9:32] looks up to see where the apples are
[9:35] falling from right those apples might
[9:39] beat him all over the head but he'll
[9:41] never look up and that's how it is with
[9:43] a lot of people God has blessed them
[9:46] from birth to now and and they've never
[9:49] looked up to say Thank You
[9:52] Lord right y'all hear what I'm
[9:55] saying right so we find out even if you
[9:58] want to follow scripture all the way
[10:00] through amen down to the 20th verse the
[10:03] Bible said they provoked him to jealousy
[10:05] with strange Gods which Abominations
[10:07] provoke they him to anger see we can say
[10:10] well how in the world Israel did this
[10:12] how could they do what they did to God
[10:14] listen America has done that and
[10:21] worse they sacrifice un devil y'all know
[10:25] that I mean we've got people in America
[10:28] right now who literally worship devils
[10:31] and will let you know
[10:33] it they don't care because they think
[10:36] God is
[10:38] dead but God is not dead Safe in His
[10:43] Arms I'm coming to something in just a
[10:45] minute so we want to look by the grace
[10:47] of God Amen to Deuteronomy
[10:50] 33:27 is that all
[10:54] right if I got it right I might be
[10:56] messing up here
[11:02] yes the Eternal
[11:05] God Is Thy
[11:07] refuge and underneath are the
[11:11] Everlasting
[11:13] Arms and he shall thrust out the enemy
[11:17] from before thee and shall say destroy
[11:23] him or
[11:25] them is that all
[11:28] right if Israel then shall dwell in
[11:31] safety alone the Fountain of Jacob shall
[11:34] be upon a land of corn and wine also the
[11:37] heavens shall drop down
[11:40] de happy are thou oh Israel who is like
[11:43] unto thee you might say well that's the
[11:45] Old Testament but we're spiritual
[11:49] Israel come on
[11:52] somebody oh people Sav by the Lord The
[11:56] Shield of thy help and who is the the
[11:59] sword of thy
[12:01] Excellency and thy enemies shall be
[12:04] found Liars unto thee and thou shall
[12:06] tread upon their high places now I want
[12:10] you to understand this is prophecy but
[12:13] the word of God tells us by the grace of
[12:15] God that the righteous shall walk upon
[12:17] the ash of the
[12:20] wicked it is something that we now
[12:23] looking at him we can see this thing
[12:26] moving at such a rapid pace we
[12:30] understand the prophecy by the grace of
[12:32] God Amen about Russia look what's
[12:34] happening people we've got a president
[12:37] in the office a
[12:39] Joseph excuse me a pharaoh that who
[12:41] didn't know
[12:43] Joseph come on and I was telling
[12:45] somebody the other day uh even though it
[12:47] was the truth I said you know when he
[12:49] said that America was no longer a
[12:51] Christian Nation and he began to call
[12:54] those y'all remember that when he first
[12:56] got in office and then he and then he
[12:58] comes down and and call uh the Muslim
[13:00] faith
[13:02] first oh come on somebody they should
[13:05] have impeached him
[13:07] then but you see God is in the
[13:11] working God has to do we you see because
[13:14] this nation and churches don't give I'm
[13:17] coming to it have literally turned their
[13:20] backs on God now is that my word no sir
[13:24] that is the word of Revelations 3 they
[13:27] had Jesus knocking on on on the outside
[13:30] of the door of the
[13:32] church trying to get in but they don't
[13:35] want him in and if he's not there who's
[13:39] there then an impostor come on somebody
[13:43] and mean the Bible said that Satan
[13:45] himself will come down as an angel of
[13:48] Light has he done it light means
[13:52] Enlightenment amen they think they're
[13:54] coming growing in the knowledge of the
[13:56] truth but the Bible said they will have
[13:59] in is ever learning and never coming
[14:02] into the knowledge of the truth that's
[14:04] the day we're living in kind of spooky
[14:07] isn't it kind of scary amen but thank
[14:10] God that you can
[14:13] see
[14:15] Hallelujah now I I want to say this I'm

[14:20] places but I'm working with Safe in His
[14:24] Arms amen because amen we realize by the
[14:27] grace of God we're living in such a day
[14:30] where you've got to be sure of your
[14:33] salvation the Bible said make your
[14:36] calling and election
[14:38] sure oh I feel saved feel feeling has
[14:42] nothing to do with it Hallelujah come on
[14:46] somebody your way of feeling is
[14:48] deceiving sometimes anybody know what
[14:51] I'm talking about there's sometimes I
[14:53] don't feel saved but will I ever say I'm
[14:56] not no sir Jesus said I'll never leave
[14:59] you nor will I forsake you I will always
[15:02] be with you where even in you see so I
[15:05] know he's in there come on somebody like
[15:09] you've heard me say sometimes I might
[15:11] have to stir up the Kool-Aid to make it
[15:12] sweet amen but the sil still in
[15:16] there glory to God Amen I like that you
[15:19] know so we look at this thing you say
[15:22] now brother Brooks listen we we here the
[15:25] Bible tells us there's two types of seed
[15:29] there is the seat of the devil and the
[15:31] seat of God now that's not my theology
[15:35] that's true amen Jesus said told those
[15:39] Pharisees and Sadducees you are of your
[15:41] father the
[15:42] devil Luke
[15:44] 17:27 so if Jesus said they were they
[15:47] were that their fathers was the
[15:50] devil that's what it was cuz Jesus never
[15:53] declared a
[15:55] lie hello and if there were devils there
[15:59] there's Devils
[16:01] now Hallelujah come on somebody and
[16:05] there are children of
[16:08] light Children of the
[16:10] day the Bible say the children of light
[16:13] and the children of the day will not be
[16:16] deceived I love this thing I love this
[16:20] because I want you to understand what
[16:22] God has done for me and you is basically
[16:25] to open up the word so that you and I
[16:29] would not be
[16:31] deceived you said well brother BCE can
[16:33] you be a church member and be deceived
[16:35] yes here was Jesus Christ on the earth
[16:38] you had Pharisees and Sadducees
[16:41] understand this people the Pharisees
[16:42] were very apt in the scriptures or the
[16:45] Scrolls it is told by gamea that they
[16:47] could literally uh have the scroll
[16:50] rolled up and a good Pharisee could
[16:52] actually point to what the scripture is
[16:55] where it is what it says and they
[16:56] couldn't miss a jot or tit
[16:59] with the scroll rolled
[17:01] up and they had to learn it
[17:04] verbatim y'all hear what I'm saying amen
[17:07] so listen but it was the Pharisees who
[17:10] literally who actually missed
[17:13] Jesus come on somebody but it but there
[17:16] were people like you and I y'all know
[17:19] what I'm saying the
[17:21] scum y' like y'all don't want me to
[17:23] preach tonight I don't know what's wrong
[17:25] y'all y'all better stop asking
[17:30] I don't know what's going on but I'm
[17:31] going to show out in a bit you know
[17:33] because I'm happy you know what I'm
[17:36] saying when God is done something for
[17:38] come on some that was just the other day
[17:40] y'all was carrying
[17:42] on what's happened between now and then
[17:46] fire still
[17:48] falling amen so let's so we find out by
[17:51] the grace of God we realize amen that
[17:54] here you
[17:56] are like like brother B said
[17:59] smitten out of the church ages into the
[18:03] Bride of
[18:04] Jesus and literally you you you you're
[18:07] actually the only sane people in the
[18:11] world everybody else is
[18:15] insane and don't even know
[18:18] it and the devil will sometime call you
[18:22] crazy but you tell them yes you're right
[18:25] I worship in the way called crazy I
[18:27] worship in the way they call her say I
[18:30] am crazy but not in the way you call
[18:32] crazy anybody that follow the devil is
[18:37] crazy there's no better way of putting
[18:40] it but the thing that I love and you've
[18:43] heard us say this I've got these in not
[18:45] in order to get where where I want to go
[18:49] because we find out that we're living in
[18:52] an age of eating drinking and being
[18:56] married we are there was a time you you
[18:59] could go to Los Angeles or you can go to
[19:02] New York or Las Vegas the party now the
[19:05] whole world is a
[19:08] big Babylonian party that's all they
[19:11] care about that's all they do
[19:15] 24/7 that's all they do and while
[19:18] they're
[19:19] partying their nation is being taken
[19:22] away from
[19:24] them just like it was in the day of
[19:28] Babylon
[19:29] y'all hear what I'm saying our nation is
[19:32] being taken away and remember I said
[19:34] this the other uh a few weeks ago as
[19:38] long as the
[19:40] church continue to keep its
[19:46] savor it is the church that keeps the
[19:49] Judgment off of whatever City or
[19:52] whatever
[19:53] world when the church go
[19:56] bad God judges the church Church
[20:00] therefore judges the
[20:02] world is that right that's your
[20:04] scripture the Bible said judgment was
[20:06] first began at the house of
[20:10] God is that right and the Bible tells us
[20:13] according to Ezekiel when God was
[20:15] getting ready to judge Israel God said
[20:18] start with the ancient go by the church
[20:21] amen amen and he says slay
[20:25] everyone Boy Child young old oh it
[20:29] doesn't matter slay everything that
[20:32] doesn't have the seal or the mark of God
[20:35] in their
[20:40] forehead is that all
[20:42] right now reason why I said that because
[20:44] America every time I read that scripture
[20:46] about jesuan and wex fat amen that's
[20:49] what God did there's a time we used to
[20:52] be so poor Amen in America you know we
[20:54] couldn't do and y'all remember the
[20:55] depression and everything else or you've
[20:57] read about it amen it was was a hard
[20:59] time but after that amen we began to
[21:02] prosper and and we became the greatest
[21:04] nation and would have
[21:07] contined had we recognized our day of
[21:13] visitation well it's like in the days of
[21:15] of Israel amen when Jesus came on the
[21:18] scene Jesus said to those Pharisees in
[21:21] other words let's put in our term he
[21:23] said it doesn't matter if your daddy
[21:25] daddy daddy our daddy daddy was a Phar
[21:28] and you grew up in this thing he
[21:31] basically said except you believe that I
[21:33] am he you should likewise die in your
[21:39] sin what was it it was a new day it was
[21:42] a new dispensation and God had turned
[21:45] the corner but the world didn't want to
[21:47] turn the corner with him he wasn't just
[21:50] Jehovah amen Spirit but it was Jehovah
[21:54] inside the flesh the Bible said in him
[21:57] dwelt the fullness of the god bodily it
[22:00] was God Amen clothed in human flesh
[22:03] Hallelujah and they did not want to see
[22:06] it h anden he came as humble as he
[22:09] possibly could born in a manger amen
[22:12] over a manure power and then when God
[22:16] sent him and raised him up in Nazareth
[22:18] and he told them where they came from
[22:20] amen they said can any good thing come
[22:22] out of Nazareth Hallelujah I say it like
[22:25] this can any good thing come out of
[22:28] Isaiah
[22:29] Hallelujah no good thing can come out of
[22:31] me until the good thing gets in
[22:35] me
[22:36] Hallelujah glory to his
[22:39] name listen Heavenly places and you know
[22:42] a lot of people you know they everybody
[22:44] say well you know I've been you got
[22:46] these denominations and it's true folk
[22:48] they they argue over the word Holy
[22:50] Spirit and Holy
[22:53] Ghost did y'all know that I was talking
[22:56] to a lady witnessing to her she went to
[22:58] uh uh one this church Apostolic whatever
[23:01] it was and I said uh I I sure I got the
[23:04] Holy Spirit she said holy spirit nuh
[23:06] Holy
[23:10] Ghost oh
[23:13] my Hallelujah come on somebody amen you
[23:17] could call it holy spirit Holy Ghost
[23:19] whatever you want to call it it's still
[23:22] holy there's only one Holy Spirit it
[23:25] right call it holy ghost call it holy
[23:27] spirit
[23:31] I like holy ghost because it when I
[23:33] think of Holy Ghost it means somebody
[23:35] died and the Ghost came
[23:38] back is that right amen Jesus said I'll
[23:41] send you to comforter it's good that I
[23:43] go away said when I go away the father
[23:46] was in the comforter who in my name and
[23:49] the comforter came in the Holy
[23:53] Ghost yeah it doesn't matter you know
[23:56] but people are fight over that
[23:59] but anyway let's move on by the grace of
[24:02] God so we see by the grace of God we
[24:06] were chosen in him before the foundation
[24:10] of the world you know that scripture was
[24:13] laying there all the
[24:16] time huh laying there all the time
[24:20] without
[24:23] understanding and when God sent Elijah
[24:26] and unfolded that scripture
[24:29] he took us to MDC and said Levi was in
[24:33] there right is that all right we have
[24:36] read Jeremiah God said I knew you before
[24:39] you were in your mother's womb now if
[24:42] Jeremiah was in in God knew him before
[24:46] he was even in his mother's womb where
[24:48] was
[24:49] he see I got in my notes you came from
[24:53] somewhere and you going to go
[24:56] somewhere Hallelujah well wherever you
[24:58] come from that's what you're going back
[25:01] to if you came from God you go back to
[25:04] God if you come from hell you go back to
[25:06] hell oh come on somebody it's the
[25:13] TRU but Paul began to re write by the
[25:17] grace of God because he wants us our
[25:19] eyes of
[25:21] understanding to be in
[25:24] light God want us to understand not
[25:27] without our natur natural eyes our
[25:30] spiritual eyes y'all hear what I'm
[25:32] saying you can say oh do you see that I
[25:35] can see it with my natural eye but I
[25:37] don't understand it see and God want us
[25:40] not only to see it with our natural eye
[25:42] but understand it that's why it's so
[25:45] important to get the Holy Ghost because
[25:47] the Holy Ghost wrote the word and if the
[25:50] Holy Ghost wrote the word don't you know
[25:52] he understands
[25:55] it that's why the Bible said no man can
[25:59] understand those things that are of God
[26:01] until he's born again intellectually is
[26:04] one thing but when it's from the heart
[26:07] you'll die for
[26:11] it is that
[26:13] okay we're living in the last
[26:16] days as I said amen we're living in the
[26:19] days where you know it make you want to
[26:20] just get on the streets and
[26:23] scream like I told you don't get afraid
[26:26] and be scared to tell people that's my
[26:30] pastor I'm telling you now I don't forew
[26:33] warn you but I'm telling you that's
[26:36] where I started that's where I end
[26:38] up amen I knew nothing about a pull pit
[26:42] I was out there with a tamarine amen and
[26:44] a few people who could hardly sing but
[26:46] we were raking and bringing in the fish
[26:48] bringing in the fish amen and I said
[26:51] Lord restore that amen I love that I
[26:54] love that I love that that's my joy when
[26:57] I see Souls rep repenting coming to the
[27:00] Lord Jesus amen turn with me back again

[27:13] every time I say that I see for a little
[27:15] longer I'm going try not to be God help
[27:18] me amen Ephesians
[27:20] 1:3 it says blessed be the God and
[27:23] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have
[27:26] blessed us with all
[27:29] yall know what that word
[27:31] all that means nothing's
[27:33] left with all spiritual blessings in
[27:38] Heavenly places in
[27:41] Christ and how do you get in Heavenly
[27:44] places you must be born
[27:47] again you and I know by the grace of God
[27:52] Amen that there's a there's we call it a
[27:54] theophany body we call it a word body
[27:57] that's the only only way you'll be able
[27:59] to hear the end Time Gospel is that
[28:02] there is a representation of you
[28:05] somewhere you say it can't be it is true
[28:09] the Bible tells us that God asked job
[28:12] where were you when the sons of God
[28:14] began to shout when they began to dance
[28:16] when they began to praise me where were
[28:19] you
[28:20] Jo if Jo was living in this day job
[28:23] could say I was there I was among that
[28:26] group amen
[28:29] you got to recognize this thing amen the
[28:32] Bible said that the lamb was slain
[28:33] before the foundation of the world if
[28:34] the lamb was slain before the foundation
[28:36] of the world there was some worshiping
[28:37] and some praising going on when before
[28:40] the foundation of the
[28:44] world
[28:45] Hallelujah is that all right why are you
[28:49] saying this because there's no such
[28:51] thing is giving eternal life to
[28:54] something that didn't have eternal life
[28:57] in the beginning
[28:58] because eternal life have no
[29:02] beginning how can a creature of time
[29:05] receive eternal
[29:09] life come on somebody because if you
[29:12] receive eternal life that means that
[29:14] eternal life had a
[29:17] beginning come on somebody but you see
[29:20] you got to be in the
[29:22] Eternal Hallelujah in order to receive
[29:25] the Eternal oh come on somebody it in

[29:35] me even when I was a
[29:40] baby they were in me and
[29:44] time
[29:45] maturity brought it to a place where it
[29:48] was possible for those children to be
[29:51] made
[29:52] manifest but I had to find a lovely
[29:55] bedding ground my wife come on somebody
[29:58] I had to find a beding ground in order
[30:01] for those children to be made manifest
[30:04] come on somebody amen but they were with
[30:06] me all along Hallelujah so was it with
[30:10] God God had to find a beding ground
[30:13] which was the womb of this Earth and
[30:16] then and God put his seed in you before
[30:19] the foundation of the world and what the
[30:22] gospel does Amen is strike that seed
[30:25] with the DNA food which is the blood of
[30:28] Jesus oh come on somebody it's the seed
[30:32] in you or we
[30:34] thought we thought in order to be a son
[30:37] and daughter of God all we had to do was
[30:40] receive the Holy
[30:41] Spirit but you see there's a lot of
[30:44] people who are not Sons and Daughters of
[30:46] God because they don't have the
[30:49] seed right come on somebody they can get
[30:53] the Holy Ghost on the flesh they can get
[30:55] the Holy Ghost on the spirit they can

[1:02:02] contestants were they could have been
[1:02:05] better and they were some of them were
[1:02:07] better but what good would is going it

[1:02:44] with you born L that's right still would
[1:02:48] be without Jesus Christ amen I'm trying
[1:02:51] to get to this last scripture amen
[1:02:53] Matthew 19 18 I'm sorry and
[1:02:58] 10 you love the
[1:03:00] Lord why we're we're at the last day
[1:03:04] people you know we're looking at this
[1:03:07] thing and God has sent us Malachi
[1:03:12] 4 and they missed
[1:03:15] it just like John the Baptist
[1:03:19] came even Jesus disciples said we
[1:03:21] thought Elias was supposed
[1:03:23] to and Jesus said I tell you Elias has
[1:03:26] already come and you knew it not and
[1:03:29] they did unto him whatever they wanted
[1:03:31] to
[1:03:32] do and you knew it
[1:03:34] not he asked his disciples he said I'm
[1:03:37] going ask you a question when you went
[1:03:39] out into the Wilderness when you went
[1:03:40] out into the desert what did you go out
[1:03:41] to
[1:03:42] see a man dressed in fine linen somebody
[1:03:46] who could speak eloquently somebody of
[1:03:49] salt rment he says no no I tell you what
[1:03:53] you will not receive
[1:03:55] you went out to see a prophet and he
[1:03:58] says you know what there's no greater
[1:04:00] Prophet than
[1:04:03] John John wasn't a compromise oh come on
[1:04:06] somebody John told it just like it was
[1:04:09] and they hated him for
[1:04:12] it but that Spirit of Elijah has to come
[1:04:15] again before Jesus come he's Alpha and
[1:04:19] Omega a lot of people look at it let me
[1:04:21] tell you something that's why they
[1:04:22] couldn't believe Jesus he was too much
[1:04:23] of a man but it was all
[1:04:27] God he was a man when he cried in in
[1:04:31] Gethsemane he was a man when he cried at
[1:04:34] Lazarus tomb but that was God when he
[1:04:37] said Lazarus come forth Hallelujah he
[1:04:40] was a man when he was sleeping in the
[1:04:41] boat but when he stood up on the ram of
[1:04:44] that boat and said peace be
[1:04:46] still they asked the question what
[1:04:48] matter man is this you flu the test
[1:04:51] disciples once again it was not the man
[1:04:53] who stopped the the wind and the way
[1:04:55] that was
[1:04:58] God and when a true son and daughter of
[1:05:01] God see a miracle done by the spoken
[1:05:03] word is God it ain't
[1:05:07] you y'all hear what I'm saying that's
[1:05:09] what's wrong with denominations and
[1:05:10] organizations they like the donkey that
[1:05:13] carried Jesus y'all don't heard this
[1:05:14] before but I got to say it anyhow
[1:05:16] they're like the donkey he got excited
[1:05:19] about the
[1:05:21] crowd he thought amen the people amen
[1:05:24] was talking about him
[1:05:27] that's how preachers are you started
[1:05:29] praising God and worshiping him they get
[1:05:31] all puffed up like they just a donkey
[1:05:34] they're just carrying the word it ain't
[1:05:36] about the donkey it's about the man
[1:05:38] riding the
[1:05:43] donkey that's what's wrong with him
[1:05:46] y'all you know what I'm
[1:05:48] saying oh it's true it's true it's
[1:05:52] true ain't God good
[1:05:58] I don't know whether you've ever
[1:06:00] seen that
[1:06:02] movie is a it's it's a Christian movie
[1:06:05] old one I seen seen a long time ago and
[1:06:09] hmon and
[1:06:10] Esther and and King as who I can hurus
[1:06:16] said
[1:06:16] unto hmon what should I do to reward
[1:06:20] this man who saved my
[1:06:24] life he thought he was talking about
[1:06:27] him you need to put him on the finest
[1:06:30] Road you need to dress him up and put
[1:06:33] your M mle on him and put it put your
[1:06:35] ring on him and let him ride your horse
[1:06:37] and you know and and and and let him
[1:06:39] ride through the city you know giving
[1:06:42] him praise and honor he he was setting
[1:06:45] it up he set the stage up he thought it
[1:06:46] was for him but it was for his enemy and
[1:06:50] and and the and the King said well then
[1:06:52] you go get Mori
[1:06:56] you go get MCI and you put MCI oh he
[1:06:59] knew he was in trouble
[1:07:01] then and that's how some people is you
[1:07:04] know what I'm saying they think they
[1:07:05] gonna get something you know no no no no
[1:07:08] God knows who who gonna get it and who's
[1:07:10] not oh Lord have mercy here it is um
[1:07:13] take heed that you despise not one of
[1:07:16] these little ones but I say unto you
[1:07:20] that in heaven the angel do always
[1:07:23] behold the face of my father which is in
[1:07:26] heaven now you got to understand we
[1:07:28] didn't understand what that was until
[1:07:30] God sent us a prophet and showed us amen
[1:07:32] that that word Angel actually comes and
[1:07:35] we understand it as a word body y'all
[1:07:37] know
[1:07:38] that I got quiet I'm almost done I'm GNA
[1:07:41] let you go is that word body see because
[1:07:46] you got to understand amen the scripture
[1:07:48] tells us that the Bible is of no private
[1:07:52] interpretation you and I we don't even
[1:07:55] have a right to sit there and say well I
[1:07:57] think this is what it
[1:08:00] me
[1:08:01] hello why would you say that the Bible
[1:08:03] said according to Amos 3:7 God will not
[1:08:06] do one thing except he Reveals His
[1:08:08] secrets to Servant father so there's a
[1:08:11] gift that God
[1:08:13] reveals things to take
[1:08:17] Moses take
[1:08:19] Jesus take
[1:08:21] Noah like I said everybody who didn't
[1:08:23] listen to Noah now is a True
[1:08:27] Believer right and God always listen
[1:08:30] with all those great men of God there in
[1:08:32] the day of Jesus how can he stand there
[1:08:34] and said except you believe that I am he
[1:08:36] you shall likewise die in your that's
[1:08:39] the mystery of this day the mystery of
[1:08:41] this day that was God was going to do a
[1:08:43] wonder the Bible said though it be
[1:08:45] small it'll be a wonderful thing it'll
[1:08:47] be marvelous in your eyes is that right
[1:08:51] and if God prepared the way for the
[1:08:54] first coming he must prepare the way for
[1:08:56] the
[1:08:57] second he cannot change his first
[1:09:00] decision about doing something must
[1:09:03] remain the same otherwise he's not
[1:09:06] God he doesn't have two to three choices
[1:09:09] there's only one choice and that's the
[1:09:11] perfect way y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:09:13] so whenever God does things how many of
[1:09:16] y'all believe it's the end
[1:09:18] time well how you going to get out of it
[1:09:22] there's so many voices in the land which
[1:09:23] one's right
[1:09:26] huh which interpretation of this Bible
[1:09:29] is
[1:09:30] Right remember amen one bad
[1:09:33] interpretation one word misplaced caused
[1:09:36] this thing to be the way it is right now
[1:09:39] Satan said You shall surely not
[1:09:42] die right and because she listened to
[1:09:45] the
[1:09:47] serpent and ate of that
[1:09:50] fruit here we
[1:09:53] are and the Bible according to
[1:09:55] Revelations said if you add or take
[1:09:59] away the plag will be added your name
[1:10:03] will be taken out of the L's Book of
[1:10:04] Life out of the book of life is that
[1:10:05] right so you and I must understand if
[1:10:08] that be true then we need
[1:10:11] God we need the voice of God to tell us
[1:10:15] what this is all about and I guarantee
[1:10:19] you if it's the true word of God it'll
[1:10:21] have the Alpha and Omega principle he's
[1:10:24] the same yesterday it end forever you'll
[1:10:27] be able to find it from Genesis to
[1:10:29] Revelation this Bible only speaks of
[1:10:32] Jesus
[1:10:34] Christ and his
[1:10:37] bride y'all hear what I'm saying it's
[1:10:40] all a love
[1:10:42] story and God got a group of people they
[1:10:45] scattered all over the world he the
[1:10:48] tired of the foolishness they want to
[1:10:49] see God real they tired of all of this
[1:10:53] nonsense that people got going on out
[1:10:55] there they don't care about it it's
[1:10:58] going home
[1:10:59] time Hallelujah they look like fools
[1:11:03] following
[1:11:04] Jesus huh did
[1:11:07] they I always tell people I don't know
[1:11:09] it must be getting late y'all shifting
[1:11:11] but let me you know I'm saying that
[1:11:13] everywhere not not seeing
[1:11:16] nobody my point is when we see by the
[1:11:20] grace of God that God is doing a great
[1:11:23] work now how is he going to do if this
[1:11:26] is the hour if this is Babylon which
[1:11:29] means confusion right there's got to
[1:11:32] come a word something that's going to
[1:11:34] straighten out the confusion something
[1:11:36] that's going to tell the truth no matter
[1:11:39] what right and how God's going to do
[1:11:43] it he's not sending it by Donkey
[1:11:46] folks God chose
[1:11:49] man and it always will be so simple to
[1:11:54] people to walk right over
[1:11:56] it I want you to understand America have
[1:12:00] received a Revival in her day that has
[1:12:04] never ever happened in the whole of
[1:12:07] History ever look in the 50s look what
[1:12:10] we got or Robert Billy Graham all these
[1:12:14] Great Men of God hallelujah come on
[1:12:17] somebody never ever in the history of
[1:12:20] man have we ever seen amen the the
[1:12:23] miraculous things that happened on the
[1:12:24] SC
[1:12:26] that had happened
[1:12:28] on now if that was the outpouring
[1:12:30] according to Joel to don't you
[1:12:33] understand amen that the next thing is
[1:12:36] the
[1:12:37] burning God getting ready to send
[1:12:40] fire and how you going to escape the
[1:12:43] fire God said I'll Never Leave myself
[1:12:45] without a witness now Noah might have
[1:12:47] look like a fool but Noah had the plan
[1:12:50] of God Jesus how many of y'all would
[1:12:52] have followed Jesus oh we can raise our
[1:12:54] hand but the Bible said this Jesus had
[1:12:56] nowhere to lay his hand head he wasn't
[1:12:59] employed
[1:13:01] nowhere H he didn't even have a house to
[1:13:04] take you through everything he had was
[1:13:06] borrowed the donkey was borrowed the
[1:13:09] grave was
[1:13:10] borrowed where he SLA was borrowed he
[1:13:13] had
[1:13:14] nothing he would have looked like a
[1:13:16] modern day bomb out
[1:13:19] there Hallelujah but why did they follow
[1:13:22] him y'all hear what I'm saying why as we
[1:13:25] said earlier my sheep is my voice and
[1:13:29] they was with him from the
