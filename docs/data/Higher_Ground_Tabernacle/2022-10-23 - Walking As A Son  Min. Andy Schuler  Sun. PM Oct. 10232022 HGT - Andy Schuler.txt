safely we had to stop for gas and so that kind of held us up a little bit but I thank God for protection and the service went well and uh I'm sure you had a great time I didn't get the chance to see the whole thing but I will after service by God's grace we appreciate our brother Andy Schuler come and sacrifice to be with us and I know he looks like a boy but he's not amen but we thank God for him and you and he and I we friends and we connected the first time we met each other and just never had a lot of Fellowship other than the time he came and visit us before and you know normally when I go out to his church it's like hit and miss we hit each other and move on but he's a real godly man and I appreciate him I'm I'm looking forward to hearing what else need to be said we have the communion we have a few different things I left my plate at home I left my wine at home and I left my communion goblet so I hope you're not too uh conservative but the Bible said they drank out of a cup so here we are by the grace of God it won't change the wine at all God is good to us under this little place under this under this plate so you won't get startled or shocked there's a beautiful lovely little girl she's no longer little anymore but I had to use her face God is so good to us we love the Lord and um like I said I'm not going to prolong the time I just we had a time a good time in Iowa City um we had to have our sister Elena and sister Janine Yolanda yes I won't forget the next time don't don't count on that but I remember we thank God for them uh you know it's amazing you know we met them by way of the YouTube and so just know that you're you're doing something is is helping in this way has caused us to contact or they contacted us however it was it's worked out really well and they've traveled all the way from Chicago and uh so we appreciate them and by the grace of God they've connected with our sister Joanne as well and my wife Ruby and so anyway they're lovely people love the Lord you know they do they wouldn't have traveled this far amen so we appreciate them and we'll ask our brother to come and just as I said be free let go and let God in whichever way you you know I love this man because he he tells the story the way God wants him appreciate your brother [Music] God bless you my brother amen amen I sure do you love brother Brooks love you all amen it's good to be with you in the house of the Lord tonight amen and just uh [Music] you know I always say back home we we have an evening service you know and we kind of hit it a little hard in the morning and people come back in the evening you came back I'm So Glad You Came Back I wasn't sure but we're thankful that you're here tonight amen amen I'll tell you Sunday night service is my favorite service of the week because you know you just get all everything's scoured out in the morning and then you come back at night and you're ready amen just to receive from God so praise the Lord God bless you thank you musicians like I said I won't sing for you tonight amen but uh just thankful to be here with you once again and thankful for brother Brooks and the invitation to be with you and um just your love and fellowship and it means a lot amen and uh you know it means it means something to see a Believer that's going on with God somebody who's standing and sometimes you know just time and and distance being what it is sometimes you see a Believer and then you don't see him for a number of years but it does something to your heart when you see them again and they're still going on for God and many of my soul well that seems like a small thing no that that's everything amen somebody who will just continually stand for this word and stand for God in this hour is uh it's a victory we should minimize it amen because there are those falling on the left and the right but we can't focus on them we focus on going on with him amen praise the lord well God bless you while you're standing let's just read a scripture if that'd be all right tonight amen praise the Lord uh let's let's turn to uh Luke chapter three tonight and we'll read in let's let's read a couple scriptures that be all right let's read in Luke chapter three and then we'll also just read uh in Romans chapter 8. amen take my jacket off again I I have never learned to preach with a jacket on it just doesn't work for me amen I want to title the subject tonight walking as a son amen Luke chapter 3 verse 22. the Bible says in the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him and a voice Came From Heaven which said Thou Art my beloved Son in the I am well pleased amen and then in Romans chapter 8 verse 29. we could read that together for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son the one that he just said Thou Art my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased amen that they would be predestined to be conformed to the image of that son that he might be the firstborn now I'm not good at English but firstborn means there's a second a third and a fourth a fifth and on and on among many brethren amen amen amen let's bow our heads father we love your word tonight Lord we love you we love your presence Lord and we're so grateful for your goodness in our lives Lord we're so grateful for your grace and mercy where would we be without it Lord the Lord through your grace and mercy we have power here on Earth Lord we have authority that you've given us Lord and Lord we want to look at your word tonight and we want to walk in everything that you've purchased for us Lord we want to walk in Victory tonight we want to walk as children of the Living God and I pray you bless this word tonight father Quicken it to our hearts Lord stir us up I pray Lord uh God may your word just move us and stir us and Shake us Lord where we need to be shaken and Lord may it give us life tonight Lord we commit the remainder of this service to you we commit the communion service to you we commit our hearts to you Lord in every way father we love you and thank you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you can have your seats tonight amen so you know I I give this subject as walking as a son but if you're a sister tonight you just put in there walking as a daughter I think in that direction all the sisters are over here the unbalanced ship amen walking as a daughter amen walking as a son what it means to be a son or a daughter of God and how does one live and walk on the earth amen but we see here in the scripture where God the heavenly our heavenly father the creator of the universe comes down and he puts his stamp of approval yeah on the Sun amen amen letting everyone know let the world know let there be no dispute no question this is my beloved Son and we know that brother Branham taught us that where he said in in thee I am well pleased and in other places it's I'm pleased to dwell in and right the the wording of that but the main point is that he was pleased and he was dwelling in him my beloved Son well pleased to dwell in to walk in to represent him to be the one to show the world who God is to reconcile the world to himself through that vessel amen The Vessel through whom the Father the invisible God would reveal himself to us that we would know him amen now brother sister none of us I don't believe tonight nobody in in Christianity has a problem recognizing that Jesus was Emmanuel that he was God With Us and he had a position as our savior and the Lord of all men is that right but what about his position as a son right now we're not talking about a trinity here we're not talking trinitarian Doctrine or anything like that this isn't three gods but he lived as the Son of God and he walked the Earth as a son of man and so he showed us what it meant to be a son an offspring of God amen amen Jesus modeled it he was our role model how a Son of God would walk on the earth and the things that he would do now of course we don't do everything that he did right we're not called to die for the world but there were things that he did that he did as a son just because he was a son amen he had to be tempted yes he was tempted to sin but yet without sin amen he could be tempted he had to be tested he had to go through every trial every Temptation yet without sin he was beloved of the father he was loved unconditionally amen now let me read you another scripture this is John chapter 8 verse 28. Jesus said unto them when you have lifted up the son of man then you shall know that I am he and that I do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me I speak these things and he that sent me is with me the father hath left me alone for I do always those things that please him now that's a great big statement right there amen I do always those things that please him and the father comes back and says I am well pleased right Hallelujah so I have a question for you or something for you to consider here tonight and this is something that the the Lord dealt with me about several years ago just kind of dropped it on me and man it shook me up I'll I'll admit it amen that if you have any shadow of a doubt or you wonder is God pleased with me right can you say that I know the father is pleased with me got you thinking amen I know that the father is pleased with me now I I can't say I do always the things that please him but he is pleased with me I am beloved of him I'm loved unconditionally and the father is pleased with me well I hope if you can't say it now maybe you'll be able to say it by the end of the service amen because brother sister if we have any hesitation any shadow of a doubt that the father is pleased with you it will be a hindrance in your walk amen you will have you will not be able to face down demons amen because they will know that there is something missing there amen we are unable to do always the things that please the father in ourselves but Jesus did it and brother sister we are in him yes amen this is the confidence that we have in our savior this is why we honor and worship him so much amen because he was perfect he was perfectly pleasing to the father to make a way for amen the peace and the dirt I make mistakes I fall down but Spirit In Me says get back up you're a son I get back wiped away and the father is pleased we are pleasing to believe that he was the firstborn among daughters to walk he walked in confidence of his position you think that he didn't need that to happen where God came down the father comes down for everybody and lets everybody know this is him I am well pleased right puts that stamp of approval on him what happened after that he gets tempted he gets tested amen Hallelujah but he walked in confidence we've got to walk the same way we can't have any question amen Hallelujah amen you know it's it's it's one of the things that I've learned in my time uh working in industry that one of the one of the most powerful things you can do for somebody is you can give them confidence you can get them confidence that they belong right and they're they're needed they're wanted they fit that that it's empowering to them and that's just in the natural brother sister how much more the family of God amen and this is a family by the way amen I don't know if you know that or not but this is not religion this is family this is God expressing himself in his family amen that's why we say brother sister amen that's that's not just a figure of speech that's not just a formality or something like that amen many brethren brothers and sisters you know my my children when well one of them's gone now but my son he doesn't come home from school and have to come to me his father and I don't interview him and say okay my son tell me how your day went did you did you fail today let's let's look at your performance right let's look at what you did and what you didn't do before I let you in the door right and if you messed up you need to go you know somewhere else he doesn't think about that he walks in the door he gets off the bus he walks in the door he doesn't even know or care if I'm at home because he lives there he walks in the house and he goes to the refrigerator amen and he knows that anything in that refrigerator is his why because he's my child amen and in in our relationship isn't based he's not going to stop being my child if he makes a mistake at school or he messes up here that's not going to change our relationship amen hallelujah God doesn't love one day and hate the other right once you're a child of God you're a child of God dance so we've got to have that confidence brother sister Jesus after that 40 days he's tested and tempted in the wilderness and what does the devil come up to him or come against him with what is the Temptation what is the question Bible readers if thou be that was what he asked him if thou be the son of God if you are who you say you are the devil was there at the at the river too he saw what happened if you are who you say you are why did he tempt him why did he test that because that's the Crux of the whole matter he challenged his relationship to the father if he didn't have a revelation of who he was he would not be able to stand that temptation right amen he knew he was the Son of God the Bible says that he found himself in the volume of the book Hallelujah amen we've got to do that too we've got to find ourselves in the volume of the book and know who we are he was not told by any man who he was right he didn't have one of the priests or a bishop or somebody a pastor or anybody say hey this is the guy right here right John the Baptist pointed him out but then God came back and answered it amen Hallelujah God spoke to him and it's good for a man we can have a man like John the Baptist we could have you know uh somebody you know give bear witness God is moving in this person's life or or as a minister you know we would bear witness that you know this is this is a minister of God or anything like that but unless God comes back and answers back and confirms it it doesn't matter what any man would say because what matters is what God tells you that's why you know brother I I've I've I've kind of we've kind of butted heads with with other ministers sometimes because uh I I have a my pastor has this pet peeve too we both share this burden we have a pet peeve of of a minister that would tell somebody oh you've got the Holy Ghost and they'll say it kind of like don't worry about it you've got the Holy Ghost and I I just marvel and it's I mean first of all it doesn't matter what you say right if you're seeking the Holy Ghost don't take the word of any minister that's the point right it's fine if you want to encourage them or whatever but nobody should ever take the word of a minister I've got the Holy Ghost they need to hear from God amen amen I had a young man in my Sunday school who was asking me about that I teach our our teenage Sunday school 13 and up 13 to 19. he was seeking the Holy Ghost and he said I was praying and a minister told me that I had the Holy Ghost and I said well do you he says well he was was he wrong to tell me that and I said well do you have it do you know I said it wasn't necessarily wrong for him to express that but what he thinks doesn't matter what matters is if you heard from God every one of us must hear the voice of the father speaking to us amen we've got to find ourselves in the volume of the book you see Satan's a worthy adversary he's going to test and he's going to probe every weakness and he knows that only a son or a daughter of God has Authority and power over him a pretender will not have that Authority amen so he tries to defeat their revelation of who they are to get them to doubt their sonship amen he attacks who they are but a child that's heard from God knows they know who spoke to them man it's it's like Ruth you know the story of Ruth and one of the beautiful things about the story of Ruth is you know Ruth goes directly to Boaz amen if you've read this story Bo and and and and they're in that inner chamber and and nobody else is there and he tells her directly I'm going to redeem you I'm gonna work out your salvation I will do this for you she heard directly from him now when she left she was a nobody still she could say man Boaz is gonna Redeem Me Hallelujah and everybody everybody else could have been like what are you talking about you are crazy you don't know what you're saying you know brought any accusation against her and it didn't matter why because she heard it from him directly Hallelujah so will we be tested so we better know who we are right amen Hebrews chapter 5 verse 5 says five five so also Christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest but that he said unto him Thou Art my son today I have begotten thee and he saith in another place thou art a priest Forever After the order of Melchizedek who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from Death was heard in that he feared though he were a son yet he learned obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him now he was our model right our example and he learned and that that word there learned it it means by experience and practice by going through some things he learned obedience through the things which he suffered he walked as a son through testing and suffering and trials and was able to practice obedience and demonstrate it for you and I amen my my because what happens with a child of God is the testing just proves more who they are amen I think there's an old saying that you know when you squeeze a lemon you get lemon juice right what's on the end that doesn't suddenly change into something else but you get what it's made of when you squeeze it and you press it and you put it through trials what you get is what it's made of it doesn't suddenly turn into something else so a son or a daughter of God when they're squeezed and tested and tried what you get sonship amen you get on display more of God in their life now people that's a great big statement right there right people think it's just the opposite oh no to this person you know they don't have any trials they don't have any troubles man they must be spiritual Godly I mean they've got this skull and form and this and look at this guy over here who's going through this and he's going through that but the trials bring God on the scene amen amen they display more sonship amen now I'm not saying that me that you'll never have good good times good things right we thank God for the good times amen and the blessings but it's not a measure of our spirituality any more than you know uh being wealthy or prosperous or any of those things is a measure of our spirituality or not it's all how we handle it amen and just because you have trials doesn't mean you're spiritual either sometimes the trials we bring on ourselves I saw a good saying brother brother uh I say you'll appreciate this you know there's a song you know the the weapon may be formed but it won't Prosper you've heard that and there's and that's that's the scripture right no weapon formed against you will prosper amen but there was this saying floating around and said you know sometimes the weapon formed against us was something we did was a weapon that we formed ourselves amen it doesn't make you more spiritual because you get yourself into trouble amen Hallelujah but you see when Jesus think about Jesus life when he was confronted by the lawyers and the scribes and and they were trying to trick him and they were testing and probing and looking for any weakness that brought out some of the most wonderful scriptures right that brought out his character to us we got to see his character on display in those times and then those testing amen to see the attributes of God how how are people going to know that that God is that he's a help in time of trouble amen unless there's times of trouble right think about the money changers we got to see a side of Jesus that we wouldn't have seen otherwise amen we got to see him you know with righteous indignation and righteous anger we got to see him at Simon's house being humiliated amen we got to see his character on display as he was treated badly and and he was mocked and humiliated and we got to see his tenderness to the Harlot but in all of that he walked in confidence of who he was and the other thing brother sister is he walked without fear amen Hallelujah now I want to kind of break something down for you trust we have time this evening but I kind of want to break something down to you that the Lord showed me and it helped me a little bit so maybe it'll help you as well and that is you know we have so many examples especially in our message we have a prophet God moved mightily in his life amen we see God we see God in Jesus as an example we see God and Paul is an example we see God and brother Branham as an example right and these were gifted they were all they all had gifts in their life Supernatural gifts right but we we got to be careful because we need to be able to differentiate and discern the things that they did because of their office and their gifts and the things that they did just because they're a child of God you understand what I mean amen because the for example I I said earlier you know where Jesus is our model but we're not going to die on a cross for the world right brother Branham is an example for us but we are we are not the seventh angel Messenger to the to this church age right we're not Malachi form we don't fulfill those things but let's use brother Brandon for an example because I think in our message and it's natural tendency is for us to do this sometimes we see him doing things and we said well of course of course God moved that way in his life he's a prophet right of course God answered his prayer he's a prophet come on now right he had an anointing on his life so you know of course he had a a a a a gift of healing and uh you know he did these things and that thing and so that was that was God's prophet and if we keep doing that we won't have any example left of well what about the what about the things that happened in his life just because he's a child of God Amen things that you should expect in your life and I should expect in my life amen so we must be able to differentiate between that anointing in the office and sonship a position as a child of God amen if we don't we'll just make excuses even if we just make it in our own mind I can't have that kind of walk I can't live close to God like that because of course he's the prophet amen Hallelujah of course he raised the Dead He's a prophet oh really any son or daughter of God is to raise the Dead amen to heal the sick he prayed for people and they got healed yeah he did yes he had a gift of healing that doesn't mean that you can't pray for people and they won't get healed too amen amen I think that's why brother Brown made it such a point so many times in his meeting remember he tells a story he tells a story in one of his meetings about how there was a woman with a child that was sick you remember this story and there was she was in the back of the balcony I think it was of the building and there was a there was a sister there who felt the Holy Spirit telling her to pray for that child now who is she was she a prophet was she a seventh Church age messenger she was a daughter of God born of the spirit and the Holy Spirit was telling her pray for that child and she said oh this is crazy the the man of God is remember he talks about her her thought process no the man of God is going to pray for her I I'll pray that she gets in the prayer line and the man of God can pray for how many times do we have that kind of thinking amen amen amen but it just kept Weighing on her so heavy and she asked me I pray for your baby and of course the woman said of course you can and she prayed for it and went on and it turned out the woman got in the prayer line remember she went before the man of God and he says you're already healed that woman back there prayed that's the body of God in action amen she prayed and that baby was healed Hallelujah that's a child of God that's how we're to walk amen but I I said a moment ago a ghost something Jesus walked without fear I want you to think about that for a moment without fear imagine your life without fear amen if you're filled with the spirit that same life is in you he said now he said the works that I do shall you do also and what does our mind immediately go to healing and raising the dead what about walking without fear what about walking in Victory amen amen hallelujah with Jesus we have to do the same thing don't confuse the life that he lived because he was Emmanuel God With Us and our example as a son amen he taught us to pray as a child not a beggar Amen to pray Our Father relationship knowing who our father is that he's a good father amen we're not coming to a to a cold God somewhere but we're coming to our father Hallelujah so we have the question still before us tonight is the father pleased with you that's the question is there any doubt that he was pleased with Jesus no question right the lamb was examined the lamb was perfect now let me ask you something are you part of him we are taught at the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit fell that the spirit divided itself amongst the Believers fell on each one and the prophet taught us that we don't have the whole ocean he said it's like taking a spoonful out of the ocean right it's the same same uh makeup but the same chemicals in that one spoonful as is in the whole ocean but he said Jesus was the whole and we are apart amen right we are a part of him he he gave us a piece of a portion of himself now let me ask you this was the portion pleased of God was it was it pleasing to God the whole was pleasing to God the portion was pleasing to God and is pleasing to God right Hallelujah Oh Glory to God we've got to have that Revelation brother sister then we can live with no fear why because the Bible says if God before us right and that's the question that's that's the that's the Crux of it if you know God is for me I have no doubt no question I am walking into a a a a a a situation the the Demons of hell are coming against me but I know God is for me there's no doubt in my mind there's no question Satan can't talk me out of it because I know that I know that I know then who can be against us amen if God before us who can be against us amen Jesus didn't live in fear and neither should we brother sister we should fear no man no demon no power no principality the Bible says nothing not in heaven and earth below the Earth I I don't know anything that can separate us from the love of God death nor height death no other creature amen amen Hallelujah then we can stand the test we can go through any test and trial and yes I said Annie sounds like a bold statement I've got a big God but I know that he won't let me go through anything that I I can't come out Victorious on the other end he won't allow testings but what is good for us he won't allow testings but what we're ready for it those testings and Trials come for a purpose there it's not for confusion it's not the harmless it's to help us it's to show what we're made of it's to cut away the flesh it's to help us walk stronger with God we can go through any test and trial job never wavered because he knew he had met God's requirement amen and if you've received the token the Holy Spirit you the the God's requirement has been met that's why he gives you the token as proof that the requirement has been met in your life and there's nothing can defeat yeah Hallelujah brother sister we can't back down from that we can't back down from the fact that our father is pleased with us oh my God I can see some of you are still a little reluctant amen I can sense it tonight it's all right we're in the right place amen Hallelujah brother random said this is just a little statement here in the Philadelphia Church age he just drops a little something in here he's talking about John Wesley the church age messenger of Philadelphia and he says this he says many books was wrote of slander about him in his day John Wesley a child of God many books written is slandering him I've never had one book written about me I think if if it happened I would you know what would happen what would we do would we crawl under a rock and die I don't know would we cry how low is me oh Lord you know what did I do to deserve this yeah he had many books slandering him making fun of him the prophet says but listen to this they've long been forgotten uh-huh they've long been forgotten now and so has their authors you can't do nothing this is a quote you can't do nothing against a child of God and get by with it [Applause] oh Hallelujah [Applause] he says that you're just fighting the air because God's going to take them right on through anyhow oh Hallelujah oh my God hallelujah why because of who they are oh there must be the smartest no they must I mean you're smart it's okay hey man I'm not calling you stupid or anything oh you don't have to be the smartest don't have to be the tallest shortest best looking most talented wealthiest poorest doesn't matter child of God Hallelujah oh listen to what he says here this is from the message I have heard but now I see he says he'd come to a place talking about Jesus where he was being tempted of the Lord but I'd like to use the word being tested by the Lord and truly every son that cometh to God must first be tested tried and this is I love this word that he uses here child trained child trained we have you know in our society today people have perverted child training like spanking and you know training a child and people nowadays don't know how to train a child but a child training when you correct a child when you when you you give a child uh you know some sort of punishment or something it's correction right it's because you want them to grow into a fully functioning adult you want them to grow in perfection maturity you're nurturing them so you correct them and you train them so that when they get out in the world they're able to withstand things right so you give them training right sometimes you know you let them go through things or you you know you know maybe you train them with an allowance or something with money so that they know how to handle money or different things right you train them the idea is not to hurt them it's not to harm them it's not to keep them down and you know slaves or something like that the idea is to lift them up amen so next time you go through a trial you say thank you Lord for the child training because you're making something glorious in my life so brother Brown says he must be tested tried child trained and then if the testing gets hard and we think it's too hard and we won't listen then He says then we become a little illegitimate child and not a child of God because there's nothing can move listen to this now he says that the testing if it becomes too hard it shows those that are illegitimate children right that's the proof you're looking for a proof of the Holy Ghost a proof that someone is a child they can stand the test they can go through the fire he says because oh I love this there's nothing say nothing nothing with conviction nothing that can move a real born-again child of God away from his parents see because he's part of him Hallelujah he says he could no more tonight than you could deny yourself see you've had the experience this is what I was talking about this morning it's not about head knowledge it's not about following the message it's not about being a message believer and sitting on a message Pew and carrying a message book and having a picture of the cloud in your house it's none of those things it's an experience that you've been trained and tested that you know that you've heard the father say this is my beloved Son this is my beloved daughter in them I am well pleased amen that's the token and once you have that you can stand any test and trial oh Hallelujah nothing can move a child of God away from their parent s my my you see this is how uh uh um you know Peter and the others when they were in prison right if they walked and and Paul and Silas and those that were in prison and were were crucified upside down and were fed to lions and all of those things they came to Peter remember what what they said when they they threw Peter I think it was Peter and John right they threw him in prison was it Peter and John they're them in prison and then they told them right they were like Don't Preach anymore in that name right and what did they say are we to obey man or God boldness this was Peter this was the same guy who a little girl when she asked him hey are you one of those Jesus Freaks one of those followers of this guy that's going to be crucified you're one of them aren't you and he swore and said no I'm not same guy but it wasn't the same guy [Music] that old guy had died and a new one had been born and now he's standing before the council and saying I won't obey you I will obey God because now I know who I am and I don't have to fear you anymore I don't have to be afraid I can walk in confidence knowing that God is my father and they could throw they could throw every religious accusation against him right they could go in their scriptures and in their you know all the different things that they have and they could try and show him why he was wrong try to prove to him with their theologians and their great minds this is why you're wrong and that's why you're wrong won't you recap won't you repent but he knew who he was amen I don't think that Peter could go into the Scrolls and match them word for word with everything that they had but it didn't matter because he knew who he was he had met God and he had the token in his life and he knew that he was pleased of the father Hallelujah Paul and Silas beaten putting into prison and those prisons weren't like prisons today you know prisons today or like you know they're like clubs almost right they could watch TV and they had you know out there pumping and they get food and you know it's warm and nice and well maybe not nice but you know I mean prisons in those days it was expected that you are probably gonna die in prison because there was so much disease and filth and you know they barely fed them and here they were beaten their wounds open wounds left to die in prison and what do they do they have a jubilee amen they were worshiping God because they were so happy that they could be counted worthy of suffering for Christ amen amen because they knew that the father was pleased with them amen that they had a father and that's the only thing that mattered and they met that trial from the position of a son amen amen brother Branham says this is from the message when their eyes were opened they knew him notice as they went down two of them this is the road to Emmaus cleopius and his friend and it was Sunday morning and they was on their Road there talking and they was going along the road real sad and they were really let down with something it looked like a veil and he says God lets things happen like that he does that purposely just to test you now let me get this before you straight so that you'll understand that every son that comes to God has got to be child trained he's got to be tested every son if you're never tested you're not a son if you can't stand the chastisement of God you're illegitimate not a child of God you claim God is your father and you say oh I can't believe well that shows that God is not your father see now notice this testing God tests every one of his children all that come to him must first be tested tried and proved now sometimes brother sister it comes to a child of God a predestinated one to show them that they don't have what they thought they had amen sometimes it comes to shake them up they think that they're all right they think that they've got the baptism of the spirit and they think that that they've got something that they don't have and sometimes a trusted trial is a blessing in disguise because it shows you wow I guess I didn't have what I thought I'll press in you see the the it can go either way either if it's a real child of God they'll press in if they're not an illegitimate child we'll say well if that's the way it's going to be why should i serve this God why didn't they fall away but it's the test that proves it amen it's God's DNA test Hallelujah in an age you know where we can do these amazing DNS DNA tests and uh and I have family members that have done it you know now they can just take a little swab of your cheek they can take some cells out of your cheek and you can send them off and they'll do a test and they'll tell you yeah your ancestors were from this part of the world in your part this and your part that and you have this much percent and oh by the way here's a list of people that might be your cousins right and it's amazing what they can find out just from a few cells from your cheek because your DNA doesn't lie amen it doesn't have feelings but it tells the truth it tells exactly what you're made of and what you are is because of what's in your DNA amen if God's got a DNA test tonight hallelujah amen amen Oh Glory can I read a couple more to you tonight I don't know how much time we have tonight amen I think I went over time this morning brother so I'll try and Reign it in a little bit tonight amen amen amen you know our pastor he you know he he he preaches pretty long I say that but he knows it and you know he says you know some preachers you've you know uh um well anyway some preachers can just hit it and stop and and our brother brother Baker we love him but he says I'm more like a 747. you know you got to get lined up on the runway and you gotta Circle a few times around the airport and then it's a long approach coming in we can't just stop amen sometimes it takes a little bit amen but we're wrapping this up all right tonight I just have a few more quotes is that all right this is from the message doors in a door he says the church has to pass through the Hall of critics we go through it you're going to be called a holy ruler now he says you're going to be called a Holy Roller the only way that you can be called a Holy Roller is if you're doing some something acting like a Holy Roller I'll just dropped that in there the church is going to be called a Holy Roller you're going to be called Everything But If You Could Only Hold Your Position in Christ someday he'll take you to the Hall of Fame amen we go through the holocritics but we're going to the Hall of Fame but first we gotta stand criticism oh I don't like criticism I can't well I don't like it either nobody likes it amen but he says this is where the littleness of us stand and this is where it shows he that cannot stand chastisement is an illegitimate child and not a child of God no matter how much he's joined Church no matter what he's done if you cannot stand chastisement he's illegitimate he's not a real child of God but a real genuine child of God don't care what the world says everything else is secondary he's got his mind on Christ and that settles it whatever Christ says he'll do it wherever the lamb goes there with him you see and then you see his appearing his presence and what he does and he's always with his people his bride for he's courting her and someday there's going to be a wedding supper oh Hallelujah knowing the unconditional love of God brother sister Amen brother Branham says this is just one this one little statement here he says that I just love this he says my action this is from God's only provided place of worship he says my action and the Vindication of God's word in my life shows whether I'm a Child of God or not how you respond to trials the Vindication of God's word in my life is what he says and now you might say well he's Vindicated he's a Vindicated Prophet no look the word says that they'll be full of love patience peace Joy long-suffering how about the Vindication of that word in our life that's what shows whether we're a child of God or not the proof is in the life that's lived amen amen amen it's not the proof is not in who can explain or argue the doctrine the best the proof is in the life let's live the father speaking to his child and saying you are my son you are my daughter I remember the day I well I remember the day I got the Holy Ghost but I remember the week after we talk about an Afterglow I was in college at the time I was about I guess I was about 20 years old I was just turning 21 when I got the Holy Ghost but I was in college at the time and I remember being in in the college you know thing and I was taking accounting classes I remember that and I remember sitting outside on the grass just praying and in the Afterglow you know of of that and just marveling what God had done and he came and he spoke to me and he said all your life you've identified yourself as a Christian but now he says he told me this in my heart I didn't hear an audible voice he said but now I have identified myself with you the father speaking saying this he was basically saying you are my beloved Son amen Hallelujah we've got to have it brother sister we cannot stand in this hour without that we cannot face down demons there's an example of this in Acts I think it's chapter 19. right when the the the the sons of a man called Siva right they they saw the things that the Believers the true sons of God were doing they saw how Paul cast out demons and the other believers how they prayed and they cast out evil spirits and so they thought that they would do it too right you remember this story writing me go and they they tried to cast a demon out of a man and the demon speaks back right and he challenges them and says okay you're saying I have to go in the name of Jesus Christ who Paul preaches that's what they said right that tried to cast him out in the name of Jesus Christ whom Paul preaches and they said well look uh Jesus we know certainly Paul we know him too we've we've had run-ins with him and then they asked the question who are you right now any demons got a right to ask the question right who are you amen who are you now if you if you don't have an answer to the question you're going to be like them right they didn't have an answer and you know the story the demons just a random ragged right guy jumped on ripped off their clothes I mean you know had a time with them they didn't get the victory because they didn't have an answer to the question who are you now it reminds me of so many people in our message that we'll say and don't take this wrong because it's okay to a certain level but I I I I always kind of am wary when people say brother Branham said brother Branham said brother Branham said brother Branham said brother Branham said brother Branham said brother Branham said all right that's okay like I said I I do it too right to a certain level but at some point it has to stop being brother Branham said and you've got to know it for yourself right because that was the testimony that lot had lot said well Abraham said God said amen and he lot is a type of a borderline lukewarm believer right he didn't go all the way in Abraham is a type of the elect that heard directly from God and lot's only testimony was well Abraham said that God said so I always get kind of weird just kind of you know people that always just say well brother Branham said and brother Branham said and brother Branham said it's like well that's good do you have a revelation of that has God come back and confirmed it to you and and maybe they do some do and some don't some are just saying it because they recognize that brother Branham was a prophet and they're just saying it's like saying the Jesus Christ who brother Brandon preached amen but not knowing it for themselves we need a revelation of the message for ourselves we've got to hear it from God ourselves Hallelujah the one that he was pointing us to amen that's right if you really heard the prophet's message you were turned amen amen and now you're going with the one that he pointed you to that's the relationship that we have but those sons of skiva didn't have the ID card they didn't have the DNA test that said this is a child of God what's the ID card it's the token amen if they had been a token carrying Son of God that evil spirit would have had to obey them and would have had to give way amen we have full Authority over every demon tonight Hallelujah they have to give way now they have the right to ask the question who are you that's why God gives us the token that's why he's brother Branham you know taught us that when we when we pray and we pray for our loved ones he said you hold the token out there what was he talking about he he was saying pray as a son a token is proof of your position with God it's proof that God has accepted you that you are accepted in the Beloved that you are one of the Brethren that he was talking about when he said he's the firstborn among many brethren a card carrying Christian you know they they the the denominations perverted that and they said well you got to have a fellowship card or this kind of card or whatever the only ID that I need is the token amen Born Into the family of God The Offspring of God have been given the authority over every demon power amen Jesus proved this as a son of God amen Hallelujah oh I just love that don't you amen don't you just love him do you know that you are accepted in the Beloved if you don't know that you can find out just ask him ask him to make it real to you he's the only one that can do it I could tell you yes or no your pastor could say oh yes or no it doesn't matter go to him he's the only one that gives out the ID cards he's the one that gives out the token amen he's the one to make you accept it in the Beloved amen Hallelujah oh I just love him Amen brother sister we don't have to walk in fear we've got God on our side amen we we don't have to you know one of the the devil's worst tricks is to try and convince you that that you're not a child of God or try to convince you that somehow he's got power over and authority over you and it's a lie the only Power that he has is the power that you give him right amen that's the only Power he has now his ability is to talk you out of it and he's good at it so if you let down your sword it's because he's convinced you to let down your sword your sword will defeat him Anytime Anyplace under any circumstances he will defeat him but he can talk you into lowering your sword amen but you have authority over him tonight amen now that doesn't mean like I said before that I mean you're not going to go through trials amen doesn't mean you're going to be spared from trials and tests and hard times sometimes God allows Satan to not sometimes that is God's part of God's toolbox for you to allow Satan allowed demons to to to to to buff at you and to come against you but brother sister we are not defeated amen though we can't see the victory right now we are not defeated and we will not be defeated a child of God will stand every test and they will come out in the end Victorious Hallelujah we've got to know that tonight we've got to have confidence in what God has made us to be amen he's not confident in your flesh but he's confident in what he's put in you amen he's confident in that seed that he's placed in there that he's quickened by the Holy Ghost he's confident in that he's confident in his word and he knows that it will produce what he determined that it would be you believe that tonight Hallelujah let's stand we'll turn this service over to our brother tonight glory to God when Jesus was challenged by the Pharisees he said I know who my father is he said you claim to be the children of Abraham that was their claim right they were relying on their relationship to Abraham he says you claim to be the children of Abraham but he said you are of your father the devil and his works you will do amen but he said I know who my father is he was confident he knew where he stood he knew where he stood with God amen we've got to know that tonight [Music] the book of Isaiah has a just a there's a little verse in there and it says he says mine elect in whom my soul delighteth him [Music] amen he says I have put my spirit upon him I just love that you're his Delight tonight amen his great love the ones that the one that he died for the one that he wants to spend eternity with he Delights in you he's pleased in his children tonight we have a portion he's given us a portion of his life amen whom the father is well pleased Oh Glory to God [Music] if you're not sure maybe you've forgotten maybe it's hasn't has become foggy to you and you need a reassurance Lord remind me seek Him amen ask him he'll tell you he'll remind you amen because you gotta know but we can we can grow weary and we can forget we can get our Eagle Eye filmed over amen as it were but we've got to know that we're a beloved child of God [Music] amen we've got to know his unconditional love toward his children [Music] and everything we do flows from that from that place from that position knowing where we stand knowing Who We Are everything we do flows from there amen amen let's bow our heads as we just hand the service over to our brother Pastor tonight Lord how we thank you Father for your goodness Lord oh God how we thank you [Music] Lord for the grace Lord that you've given to those that were poor wretched Sinners Lord but yet you've transformed them into the children of God wiped away every sin stained Lord [Music] moved us into Heavenly places oh God how great is your salvation how great is your power How Great Is Your Grace tonight Lord I pray for the this people here tonight Lord my brothers my sisters Lord Lord I pray for those maybe who haven't heard that voice speak their name Lord that they would find out that they wouldn't rest until they know that they're a child of God and those may be tonight that have grown grown weary and well-doing father and so many times we can question and the trials can be so hard on us Lord that we wonder Lord in our flesh Lord does God even love me just am I really his yet in the soul we we don't disbelieve [Music] but Lord even in those times you come and remind us Lord you come and speak to us sometimes through a message like this Lord You remind us who we are and what we are and what we've been made for and what we're to be doing and how we're to be living and Lord we thank you for that I pray that you would encourage your children tonight that they would walk in confidence in faith without fear never wavering that they would be so solid Lord on the foundation of knowing that you are their God that you are their father Lord they would be so solid on that Foundation Lord that no demon in Hell could stand before their prayer [Music] foreign every demon power would be defeated Lord that they would be able to stand every test and trial emerge Victorious holding on Lord God as you hold on to them Lord how we love you Lord and thank you so much for your word Lord we just pray that you'd be with us the rest of the service tonight in Jesus name amen and amen hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Music] hallelujah hallelujah [Music] time he will fear the multitudes turn the water into wine to the hungry he call it now come and die oh come and dine the master calleth Commander oh you make beast at Jesus table all the time he will fed the multitude turn the water into wine to the hungry call it now come and die sing Jesus as a tablespread where the saints of God have fear being invite his shows and people come and die and with

thus obey Christ command for the master he called to them come and die for there they found their heart's desire bread and fish upon the fire that's his satisfies the hunger all the time come and die [Music] come and die oh you may Feast at Jesus tablet [Music] to the hungry call it now come and die sing the course again come and dying the master call it up and down [Music] he who thought [Applause] we call it now [Music] many many men I don't have to ask who enjoyed the word of God uh you know I'll say it like this when the word comes like that it's like God opened up your diary and read your diary to everybody well you you the only one knows what was in the diary right it's amazing what God can do enough brother I have to repent because there have been times I've told people I know you got the Holy Ghost you know and I'm not going to say that ever again it makes sense I don't know nothing you've got to know and so that was a correction for me because I don't want to mislead anybody and I don't want them to think they've got the Holy Ghost when they don't have it all right God has to witness that to you from now on in this church I won't be telling you that I won't even say well I believe you got it you got to know that you know that you know that you got it and I love the way the word of God came tonight I that's the way I I just appreciate his ministry because you go in areas that most people don't go in and he brings it in such a wonderful way it's just like how could I say it it's like medicine to the Bone or however you want to say it it's a sweetness that God brings with the word of God handling us as children and I love that I love that because that's who we are and I know by God's grace that you have to know who you are at this day and time and and I love the the attributes of Christ as a man as a son you know walking in Victory walking with no fear all of those things are very important for us to know because if we have a part of the ocean all of the attributes of the ocean are in us if we have a part of Christ all of that is in US we just need to make the connections amen you love the Lord anyway God heard me heard My Cry and now we have a a a a a a a cup and all that good stuff thank you brother yes so we won't have to use the red cup because I don't want to make the YouTube brother Brooks that got so liberal he's serving the laws in a red cup at least it's red it stands for the blood right but God is so good to us and I'm glad the brother felt inspired to go get me a cup and all of that that was the Lord Jesus because in my heart I I didn't want to offended anybody and I didn't want to postpone uh what we planned to do as far as communion communion to me means a lot to me I think it's one of the most important Services of all times uh because it's what Jesus did before he passed and I believe I've got it right brother branham's last message was communion before he had his great accident it it just happened that way but Jesus also promised that we'll have communion again when it's all over communion is not a sign of disaster or defeat communion is Victory and every time we have communion we're showing the victory we're trophies of God of what he did and because of his sacrifice we're Worthy right because we're not worthy of ourselves is his worthy worthiness and in our lives are what hid in Christ Jesus that's how it is and we examine ourselves to see what where we've gone wrong and as the brother said as the Lord spoke to us this evening when we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all our unrighteousness I do not understand Christians who don't take communion especially those who are doing their best to walk up right before the Lord to deny communities to deny that you are part of Christ you know like they say you know it's you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't that means if you if you do it unworthily and you know you're not you're living a hypocritical life then don't do it until you make it right making it right is simply simple as asking for forgiveness as simple as as just confessing your sins before the Lord and any brother and sister you may have offended you asked for forgiveness you get right with God and you're worthy you're now ready for it because there's no one perfect Christian there's not a perfect Christian it's the perfect God in the Christian and so we love the Lord we appreciate everything he's he's done for us thank you brother I enjoyed the word and I hope and trust that when time come again you can come again amen I love I love words like that I love it it gives you that time to really hear what God is saying and he ministers to me he ministered to me if you didn't minister to nobody else I was fed tonight and I don't say that just to be saying it I'm telling you the truth there's a lot of things said that made me see a lot of things I've done wrong you know with others loved ones and everybody else and I was I was able to see you know how it is and it's so simple yet so powerful how it is to be a Christian if we only just walk in the light as he is in the light it's really it's really not complicated and and to know that to take the test in the trials and how often we say oh God I can't take no more Gods oh yes you can [Music] when we say we can't take no more that's when he pulls a little bit more on us because he knows how much you can bear and he knows the the quality of gold that he's working with and he's got to get all of the draws out of you and that's what I want I want all of the darkness all of the draws anything that's going to hinder him from using my body I want him to take it away so as we stand we're going to turn to First Corinthians the 11th chapter I trust everybody is at a peace of mind because there is a sweet peace in this place I just feel sorry for those who don't come but I always say Lord forgive me if I'm judging wrong I said you'll find the real church at Communion some people can't make it because of their jobs and things of that nature we understand that but we're saying that when people set home and understand that they could be a part of this service you know I don't understand it do you know that those who were at the communion of Jesus were the elected chosen of God those same people that were sitting at the table will be there with him except Judas you see what I'm saying and every time he had communion it wasn't just given to any and everybody it was a selected group of people oh I feel like Shout I really do I'm not just saying that I'm I'm holding it down right now praise the Lord oh God 11th chapter of First Corinthians which started the 23rd verse for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drink a damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasten of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together with unto condemnation and that the rest I will set in order when I come amen those of us who are going to participate in communion what we do is come up front amen [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music]
