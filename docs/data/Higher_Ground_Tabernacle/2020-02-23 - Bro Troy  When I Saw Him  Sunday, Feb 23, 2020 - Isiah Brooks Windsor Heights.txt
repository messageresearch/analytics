into the word of Lord I want to thank the musicians who just song specials and all we just enjoyed it Amen it's it's wonderful to have all the features amen we spent so much time without him every time I hear it this does something for me Amen amen let's open our Bibles to the book of revelations will read from the first chapter and they want to speak a message called when I saw him a man we being a people that believe in Luke 1730 the day when the Son of Man will be reveal let's revelations chapter 1 verse 17 it says and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not for I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death what a message amen what a message let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just want to thank you Lord for your words they are life to us Lord they are there the keeps us Lord with day by day it

Laurinaitis thank you Father for laying your hand upon it's Lord Laura for choosing us for calling us Lord for surely we needed you and you came upon the scene while we were yet sinners you died for us Lord we had a need of you and you've called us to your heart Lord a son father and Lord you didn't ask us to fill a servant's place Lord but Lord you called us an inch up into the glorious Lord you gave us a a new body like your glorious body lord I just thank you for all these promises all these things Lord Lord we dedicate our lives unto you father Lord you've made all things possible in your name Lord so are we just this day lures you Lord I've already searched the hearts of the people father you know every one of their needs Lord Lord you know what the how to raise them up to higher places father and you and Lord and so I asked this morning father that you they've searched the hearts would bring the answer back Lord to the heel to deliver to two raises up to higher heights Lord in heavenly places in Christ Jesus well let all things be done according to your spirit and according to your word in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen be seated that's Scripture there I just I love it because it starts off and when I saw him I think every single one of us first off would say boy I wish I could be in those shoes amen but we have been in those shoes if you event if Christ has ever reveal himself to you you've been standing right there if Christ says in the as brother brand said then the days of the Sun and when the Son of Man is revealed amen has he been revealed to you amen Christ has to have made his revelation to you a man if he ever wants to reveal himself to you he's done it for a very specific purpose maybe I think about when a when a husband and wife are first courting you know as they begin to reveal themselves to each other a man gain to know each other a little bit better and you start sharing secrets one with another and it binds them together amen and it creates a bond that can never never be broken a man is so Christ has begun to reveal himself to the last day church amen he's revealed himself to a people they'll be called the bride amen it's a people that he called before the foundation of the world he chose them and he ordained them to be Christians your ordaining them to be the Bride of Christ he ordained them to be repositories of his spirit to be filled with this Holy Ghost amen and he is so he has created you to be a very special person upon the earth amen because he has chosen you to be the one that Christ reveals himself to you a man's brother branham and the choosing the bride started talking about how he shares his secrets with her hey man do you remember the quote he shares his secrets with her amen and so is Christ done that in this last day of revealing the word to his bride so that they could be on the same page a minute so that they would know one another amen as you confess your faults one to another a man you share your weaknesses with the Lord amen as you say Lord you know you confess your sins amen you and you you fell down at his feet as though dead as the Bible says Amen you've revealed your weaknesses to him a menu view revealed you know things you struggle with day on day out a man he also shares back with you and begins to reveal his Holy Ghost to you to reveal his deliverance to you and he lifts you up on a higher plane amen he forgives you of your sins while we were yet sinners Christ died for us God so loved the world they gave His only begotten Son for us amen he any any a chose us what to place his spirit within us so that we wouldn't be part of the animal race but we'd be part of the sons and daughters of the Living God amen and John when John saw him he fell at his feet as though dead amen but yet but Christ didn't leave him there amen the bride fell at his feet as though dead she fell down she repent of her since Amen she she the revelation struck her and she realized how great he was how marvelous he was she realizes his preeminence amen she roses his majesty his glory was revealed to her she began to realize how what the Bible wasn't a dead book to her he meant it should begin to realize who she was or who he was and she fells down his feet that he lays his right hand down upon her amen it says fear not fear not don't be afraid Amen don't be afraid of death hell and the grave don't be afraid of these things don't be afraid of these things I have chosen you I have chosen you to place my wordings you to place my spear within you to make you someone that you could never be on your own chosen to be one United with him a meant to be the Bride of Christ a man I think about victory the other day you know as Billy RAM had that sermon he preached called a total victory Amen we've been called to have a total deliverance a total victory complete and entire it not supposed to be a halfway deliverance not supposed to be a halfway victory you know this country we used to after the Second World War in this country we initiate a new holiday and that holiday was celebrated for about 25 years and then we did away with it and that holiday was called v-day Victory Day a man a brother branham preached some sermons on v-day or Victory Day and and the origins of that whole holiday is this that when we were at war during World War two we're not only a war with Germany over in Europe but we were also war on the Pacific side over in Japan amen we had the battles coming s from both directions amen and so and so we are worried about the the peace of the Western world but we're also worried about the Japanese and and coming over and attacking our lands and and I read some of the stories about how they would send I like hot air balloons with bombs attached to them they would float over our country and some of actually would land in our farm fields and different places and you know and they sent airplanes over in different places or they you know they attacked Pearl Harbor and all the different things and and we decided not to let that stand we decided not to let that provocation stand we excited we wanted victory we decided that we wanted to deliver it's as a country as a nation amen so we began a war with Japan and when we after fighting the battle for so many of the you know three four years we won a complete and total victory and there on the on the battleship USS Missouri the leaders of Japan met our leadership and there on the deck of the battleship they signed an unconditional surrender of the of the kingdom of Japan an unconditional surrender of those that would attack us amen and and that ceremony where that surrender was signed that ceremony was celebrated in a holiday called v-day or Victory Day amen and we celebrated that victory for about 25 years a man but I got to at that time where we decided we didn't want to celebrate that holiday anymore amen and that victory has now been pretty much forgotten and and in the memory of most people in the memory of our nation and that's okay let those things go into the past but let me tell you there is a victory I'm not here to worry about this country over here this country over there what this old battle over there right I don't have any any desire to remember all those things those things don't concern me because I have a heavenly kingdom a mana there is only one battle that I am concerned with a man I don't have to worry about the bow between the north of the south or the between the blacks and the whites or between this nation and that nation between this this theory in this theory I'm not worried about what the Liberals versus the Conservatives those things do do I bother me amen let them fight their battles I am worried about one battle one battle alone a man is the battle between the forces of evil against the forces of good though the battle between the Holy Spirit of the Living God and the things that are contrary to the spirit of the Living God the battle between God's own word and his vision for this earth and everything that have come contrary to that vision a man because God before the foundation of the world had a vision in his mind and in that vision was a vision of not just not just a garden edan not just what God would create and protect upon this world but with a vision of you there's a vision of your soul living at peace on this world as a vision of your soul living in purity without sin amen and that vision Amen there has to be a victory to come back to that vision amen and and and and everything they would come contrary to the vision let there become a battle amen we are willing to fight for that Amy if there is anything that's going to come contrary to the vision of the Most High God then I'm sorry but we're gonna have a fight hey we're gonna have a battle we're gonna have a war why because I am willing to fight for that vision I am willing to go to battle for that for for that what that vision is amen amen and I am NOT here for a partial deliverance I'm not here for a halfway victory about here for a total victory a total deliverance so that whatever God's vision of me was before the foundation of the world that's where I'm going back to I was born to do that amen I was born for that victory I was placed here on the earth to win that victory and all power of heaven and earth is behind me to get me to that place a man I fell and when I saw him I fell at his feet as though dead and he laid his hand upon me and said fear not amen fear not for I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore he told me amen I'll never leave you nor forsake oh is what he told me amen and I am willing to accept what he said to me Amen I willing to not just accept what Christ said to me by willing to bring it as a weapon into battle Amen I willing to fight with those words Amy because I know that there is a power behind me Amen to get me to that place amen I am Alive for evermore jesus said amen and I had the keys of hell and of death amen so it all hell assailed me I have a place that I can go amen amen in Psalms I was gonna read here from Psalms 91 it says he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty he that dwelleth he that liveth there he that o he that if you're you know you're dwelling if I'm gonna look for you I if I come by your house I expect to find you there Amen you know more often than not you're gonna be a home Amen you that why that's where you live Amen but he that dwelleth he that lives that Psalms 91 one he that lives there in Christ in the Holy One he that dwelleth there in the secret place of the Most High God shall live there shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say the Lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will I trust a man I will trust him constantly all the time in every situation no matter what comes upon me and I in life's journey you're gonna find me trusting in the Lord amen if you see me in this trial over here you're gonna find me trusting the Lord if you find me sick in a hospital somewhere you're gonna find me trusting in the Lord if you see my mind tormented about something you're still gonna find me but nevertheless I will trust in the Lord he's the one that has the keys of death hell and the grave and he is alive and forevermore alive to bring me back to what the vision was before the foundation of the world and that vision did not have a depressed that vision did not have me sick that vision didn't have me in the hospital that vision did not have me bound by the enemy that vision didn't have me sunk down in sin amen but that vision heavy perfectly whole a member of the Bride of Christ amen all power in heaven and earth has given unto Him amen to make me exactly what the vision said I was supposed to be amen him the cieth of vision run make it plain to him so they can run they can run after it with the power of the Almighty God amen let's hurry to Exodus chapter 3 XS chapter 3 verse verse 7 I read here a couple verses this is Moses right at the burning bush you remember the story how he had ran from Egypt and had been there in the in the desert now for 40 years herding flocks and and I had forgotten pretty much his old past life amen and when he saw this this burning bush he decides to turn aside and see what what caused this this this bush to burn and was not consumed amen and when you when you come down to the when you come down to the seventh verse this is God talking to him out of the bush after guys introduced himself in verse six he says I am the God of thy father of God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and God is introducing himself and Moses hides isn't face cuz he was afraid to look upon God amen the very one that that can't he can't God chose him God chose to come to him to reveal to himself but yet he was afraid to look upon he come to verse 7 and the Lord says unto him I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt I've heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for I know their sorrows and I am come down well that's quite a blessing I like it when he comes down don't you Amen I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians what a blessing let's go ahead and verse 9 there says that now therefore behold the cry of the children of Israel has come under parn me I've seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them now God was sending Moses as a deliverer and he sent all these he gave all this description to Moses about how Moses was gonna win the victory Moses I'm sinning you Moses to go in the victory he told him beforehand so now that Moses has become a believer now he's gotta go make the people a believer you know God expects his people to hear a message like this one time and believe when God gives a message of deliverance to his people he expects them to hear at the one time and believe yoen when when God when Jehovah was gonna bring them to the Red Sea he told them beforehand I am going to Pharaoh is going to let you go and you're gonna leave Egypt but I'm gonna harden his heart and he's going to chase after you but I will deliver you with a mighty hint so when they got to the Red Sea they should have never worked they should have never feared because God had already told them beforehand I will deliver you when you get to that place when you get to that time when you get to the Red Sea you stand there a wait and watch I will deliver you with a mighty hint not a weak and with a mighty hint and so but when they got there what they do oh it would have been better if we were stayed in Egypt oh I'm better if we had done this no instead of saying that they should sit there and waited and watched for the mighty hand and so should the Bride of Christ in every situation in their lives stand there and wait and watch for the mighty hand of God amen he sees heard your cries of oppression he's heard your Christ amen if you placed your prayers upon the altar I mean if you have something in your life that needs changed if you have something that's not right if you have something that's not according to the vision put it upon the altar amen if you as if God has revealed unto you the vision for your life and you see things in your life there are contrary to that vision laid upon the altar so that he could say I have heard their cries I've heard their tears I've heard their prayers and I am come down Amen they fell at my feet as though dead a man they laid their prayer upon the altar and I am cut down and I laid my right hand upon them behold fear not don't you worry about this don't you worry about this sickness don't you worry about this over here that over there I am come down to deliver you I have in my hand the the power of the death hell and the grave is given unto me I have the keys of the kingdom of hell I have the keys of death I have the keys of cancer I have the keys of no matter what it is I have those keys in my possession and I can unlock the door of deliverance to you I can unlock the door of healing to you amen amen as I seek in a while back about how so much you know when when someone comes down with a sickness amen that you know that if they do not get better they will die it's an illness that will kill them and so you know they go to the doctor amen and you'll there's nothing wrong with that go to the doctor amen go to the doctor let that let them work there in the natural the things that can help you the things that can heal you go to the doctor but there is a power that doesn't work we'll see that doctors going to work work according to the laws of nature Amen he's going to work according to the laws of nature well that's okay let him work according to the laws of nature amen let it happen you know but let me tell you there there there there is a supernatural that is outside of nature amen there is the God that created nature amen and it is not this it's not the same as a natural healing Amen because it is supernatural Amen it's when God intervenes on your behalf when God comes down when God hears your cry when God comes to give you a total deliverance and you know and you say Lord I know that maybe I could be healed on the natural but you know maybe it's been a little while since I've seen God act on my behalf of my life sometimes you just get to a point where you know God I just would like to see you act in your mighty act in your power act with your deliverance I'd like to see the supernatural again in my life and you know there's been times where there's been things in my life where yeah I know I could have a natural healing I know I could have a natural deliverance we know sometimes I just want to give God a chance to intervene in my behalf because I like to see him work I like to see him move I like to see him deliver I like to see him set free I like to see him when he comes on the scene and deliver a man because when I know that when he comes I'm gonna have a testimony that I can bring to the loss and hurting somewhere down the line amen amen there's been times in both my wife and I his life to where we've had issues in her life whether it be sickness or or financial troubles or whatever it was and we knew we could seek a natural deliverance but sometimes you just want to see God act on your behalf amen and we put our trust in the Lord and you know what she came through and now we have a testimony of a supernatural God that that left heaven behind to come down and intervene into our affairs a man to give us a deliverance that we could have something we couldn't have done for ourselves amen amen and that's a victory it's a victory day it's something I celebrate I'm not going to forget about it I'm not gonna you know let something y'all like oh we quit celebrate a victory day because we want to become friends with Japan again and if we kept celebrating that holiday how can we celebrate our victory over Japan and then go and be friends with Japan and so we decided to get rid of the holiday and that's okay let them do that but you know when I get a victory over the devil I am NOT going to forget that victory there is nothing that's gonna stay well I want to become friends of the devil again no no no I'm always gonna remember the time that I got the victory over something Satan did in my life son Satan came into my life and took me outside of the vision you know but I want a victory I put it upon the altar of prayer and I took that power of the supernatural power the Almighty God and acted upon my behalf and brought me back into unity with the vision amen a complete victory and when I saw him he laid his hands upon me that's what's said in Revelations and when I saw him I fell asleep and he laid his hands upon me that's a good place to be amen it's good to get to a place it's where you could see him where he can reveal give God the opportunity to reveal himself to you amen you have every single one of us has a solemn duty to get ourselves to the place it's work to give God a chance to act on your behalf to give God a chance to reveal himself to you and let me tell you when you're enjoying your sins how can God reveal himself to you a man when you're when you're when you won't when you won't lay that thing down how can God ever get through to you amen when you when you're enjoying being sick when you're enjoying your pity party how can God reveal himself to you if you're enjoying being angry how can God bring his peace to you amen you have to give God a chance an opportunity to act on your behalf amen why because you got to get a chant you gotta get to that place where you could see him hey man let me tell you I want to read that revelations one more time that revelation is one said 17 it says and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not what a powerful message we ought to get to that place the Bride of Christ every single member of the Briar cry ought to have a testimony that she's been there a man that she's been there she's had that experience I fell at his feet as though dead Christ has revealed himself to me amen but you know what he came and he brought the peace to me a man he is the the peace that passes all understanding a man he has healed me he has delivered me he brought peace to me said don't you fear don't you worry I all power in heaven and earth has given unto me and I'm willing to exercise that power in your life amen to bring a victory amen you know in the Revolutionary War we fought to be free from overseas powers amen we fought to be free from paying taxes to England a man we've fought to be free to to to to worship however we wanted to worship a Mendte not worship according to the Church of England not paid taxes to King George a member we wanted to have to govern ourselves and we fought a war the Revolutionary War to win the victory and because we won that victory we should never go back to paying taxes to England we should always worship but we should not go back to religious slavery amen we should always celebrate that right to govern ourselves why because otherwise we are forgetting the blood that won that victory our country paid a price where our soldiers fought and died to win that victory and when we go back and back slide on that victory we're saying that that blood was shed for no purpose for no reason Humana gin George Washington losing half of his army to to win the fort in Boston I didn't just say well let's go back and go home and just give it back to him after losing the 2000 mint those that it's counting those lives or those 2000 men is not worth anything a man so the same thing you like with the Civil War we fought in the Civil War our country was splitting apart amen and you know they had a president that they say was was kind of weak and and was not willing to hold the country together or to pay the price and then we elected an Abraham Lincoln a man a man that had a fury in his mind that no matter what I'm gonna pay the price for this country to stay together I'm gonna pay the price for for this country to be United Amy it's so much so that when when the battle was over he even went to the South and did things to make sure that they didn't just win the battle over the south but that the South was forgiven and brought back into unity amen he paid the price he and the battle was fought to get rid of slavery and to bring the country back together in a union any unit unity so all those lives that were lost if we fight one American to another American they were saying that those lives were lost in vain we should always celebrate that victory amen so also if Christ died to set us free then we should always celebrate that victory I mean if Christ died to to pay the debt of to get the keys of death hell and the grave amen - as he said the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor Amy he's annoying to me to bind up the brokenhearted to set at liberty those that are bound if he paid the price for that then we should always celebrate that victory and not allow us to backslide into bondage - - through something of the devil but always keeping it in mind the the vision that God had of us before the foundation of the world and the power of his death to bring us back to that vision amen amen otherwise it's a forgotten victory amen and we're back sighted on the price that was paid let's turn over to the Book of Isaiah chapter 62 Isaiah 62 says there in the fourth verse here's God is talking about his people his land his nation and they'd got into a bad place his people were in bondage he wanted to preach a gospel of deliverance to them and Isaiah 62 4 he says thou shall no more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land be termed desolate called desolate but thou shalt be called hepzibah and I'll and we called Beulah for the Lord delighteth in thee and thy land shall be married for as a young man marries a virgin so shall thy sons marry thee and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride so shall thy God rejoice over thee amen just like what he said in sake of Peter so that you will not be barren or unfruitful he's gonna rejoice over you he's gonna share his his attributes with you amen but eat but let me let's just talk let's just go through these terms here these names he says that thy land shall no longer be called desolate the people had gotten to a place to where you know maybe they were still called the people of Israel or the children of the Most High God but in the spiritual sense of it their name was called forsaken amen you know and you call someone something you call it according to their characteristics according to what they are their name has a meeting this is the title of your characters characteristics and verse for their characteristics had become forsaken amen and their land and become to be called desolate let me tell you those were accurate descriptions the people had become forsaken their land have become desolate that was the description of God's own land and God's own people amen I I was looking those words up and you know and if you remember your language lessons from elementary school this goes way back they'll teach you about antonyms and synonyms and an antonym if you take a word as a specific meaning then an antonym is a list of all the words that have the exact I haven't the opposite meeting and the synonym will be a list of words that have the same meaning or a similar meaning amen and so you take the word forsaken there's you can look up all the antonyms of that word all the things that have the opposite meaning and so the antonyms of the word forsaken will be cherished or helped or nurtured wanted something to be desired something that's cared for something that's considered or brought into consideration something that's useful that's the opposite of being forsaken so if he's saying you're no longer gonna be called no longer gonna have the opportunity to be called forsaken but instead you're going to the opportunity when people look at you and they bring their description of you and they want to describe who you are if they want to put a name to you they'll call you cherished the one that has been helped the one that has been nurtured the one that is wanted desired the one that is cared for the one is being considered by her lover a man the one that is B is useful amen that's so that's what the you're not gonna be called forsake anymore but this is what you're gonna be called this is your new name amen and the land that you live in is no longer be called desolate well the antonyms of desolate will be cultivated it's populated it's useful the land has been farmed and in the seed they're planted there they grow up it's well watered anyway it's not desolate emore but it's bringing forth fruit fruit is two seasons and God says that you're not going to be called these things anymore but you'll have a new name amen he says but you will be called Hephzibah and I'll and shall be called Beulah now I word hepzibah means my delight is in her a man I take delight in her my joy is placed in her amen you and you will be called the one that has the joy of God over her the one that God enjoys to be with the God one that God enjoys to add to to live with to act on her behalf to give special gifts to her a little love tokens from from the heavenly places they meant a man his delight is in her amen so you're not gonna be called forsake anymore but it said here we called Hepzibah and your land isn't be called Beulah married Amen now the this the synonyms let's look at not the antonyms not the opposite but let's look at the synonyms of delight my delight is in her hepzibah he said you will no longer be called desolate but you will be called Hepzibah my delight is in her amen and that word delight the synonyms of that would be contentment he is contented with you think about that he's contented with you he's contempt to be with you he could he could chose intented with you amen ecstasy bliss complete euphoria my enchantment his delight is in her he's enchanted with her he's captivated by her a man he can't stop staring at her a man he's caught she has caught his attention pleasure rapture extreme happiness and delight satisfaction he's satisfied in her the descriptions of God's attitude towards you his delight is in you you're like me called desolate anymore we're gonna be called Hepzibah my delight is in you I have enchanted with you amen I'm satisfied with you I'm at peace with you I'm at serenity when we're together Amen I a bliss complete euphoria when God gets together with us my what a blessing in the land that she lives in that God has given to her as a promise is a land of called Beulah which means married or he's allied with her amen conjoined it's become one unity that land has become one with the promise of God everything one with the vision of God the place where you land is not desolate it's not forsaken Amen but it's a land where all the promises of God are in unity with the vision of God God's will as power in that land where the will is God is in that land that's what happens amen amen it's just like we preached a long time ago about how God in Revelation says we have become kings and priests unto Him amen we have become kings and priests unto our God amen when you look at the duties in the land of Israel of the Kings in the priests and what it meant what kings and priests meant to to the Land of Israel the the priests had dominion over the tabernacle over the temple amen and it was the duty of the priests to to make sure everything was done in order and that all the things were that the daily sacrifice was performed amen that there was always wood stacked up for the fire any way that there was lambs that were ready and purified for the sacrifice a man and that the and the priest had kept himself clean to to perform the sacrifices so that when the people had a need to bring a sacrifice or a peace offering or a wave offering that they could come to the temple door and that the high priest had already had everything ready to make sure that the people's sins were taken care of that their sicknesses could be healed that their that their house could be delivered and that was the duty of the high priest amen hey he had complete dominion over the temple and he had prepared the wood was stacked up over here from the fire amen the oil had already been beaten out of the olives amen and all the things were ready the showbread was on them upon the table the place was clean and well maintained so at the presence of God we have a place to come down so the people could have their sins taken care of as the duty of the high priest towards out to create a place where the presence of God could come down and the people to be united with their God at the temple amen and that word of God had a place that could live there in the Ark of the Covenant where the the tablets of the ten commandments that God wrote with his finger were kept there and protected there in the temple and the temple amen and that was the duty of the priest amen but the duty of the King was to take the Dominion of that word and to extend that to meaning out to the outermost geographical boundaries of the Land of Israel so the Dominion of the Word of God had power throughout all the land of Israel not just there in the in the temple but also everywhere to the furthermost boundaries of Israel and God has called us we were to be kings and priests unto our God a man were to take the Word of God and let have a place inside of us that's kept clean and pure a man soweth some from fingertip to fingertip from head to toe God has a place where he can rest God is a place on the earth where he can come and visit God has a place where he can come and dwell a member is God when his people have become united he's in chanted with her he's one with her a man God is a place where he can lay his head amen and be at peace with his people amen but not only that but we're here also as kings to bring the Dominion of that word to our homes to our workplace to everywhere we are Dominion is a man so the people might see the actions of the Almighty God amen amen amen but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off remember in Peter when he starts talking about all the all the attributes of God and he says by he that lacketh these things it doesn't have the attributes of God hasn't prepared a place for God to come down he the lack of see sings as blind cannot see afar off and he's forgotten that he was purged and cleansed from his past sentence amen no longer Mary doesn't have a place for God to come down let's just sit here in closing let's turn our first Peter 5 I fell at his feet as though dead and he laid his hand upon me he gave me assurance a mint he gave me an assurance he said fear not for all power has been given to me I have the keys of death hell and the grave I'll lay my hand upon you and heal you and deliver you and bring you back according to the vision first Peter 5 verse 10 it says but the God of all Grace who hath called us it wasn't great to be called a man he has called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that you have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen and settle you mine that's who that's where you're headed that's that's the journey that we're all on amen so if you haven't been strengthened look to him if you're not settled look to him a mint Amy if you don't know who your sir if you don't know the power if he hasn't laid his hand upon you if it hasn't been revealed to you the power of God then you need to go back and make sure you're calling elections shirt a mint because the God of all Grace who has called us unto his eternal glory and after you suffer over for awhile is able to make you perfect to establish you to strengthen you and to sell you hey man there's a companion verse to this the next chapter over in 2nd Peter 1 verse 2nd Peter 111 it says for an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ those of two verses are linked amen those two verses are linked an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly it'll be given to you not just in a little bit be a grand entrance I already turned to his gates with Thanksgiving I'm getting her into his courts with praise amen abundantly into the everlasting kingdom any when that kingdoms not far over here or far for there no it's just a little over the doorposts it's no dimension just a little faster than this one amen the kingdom of heaven is within you amen when he gives you the Holy Ghost he's given you everything you have need of in this life's journey even the rapture an entrance shall be minister unto you don't you worry don't you fear if I leave you I will return again unto you and receive you to yourself but if I leave you I'll go and prepare a place for you so I can come back and bring you to myself we could be united one to another hey isn't that the promise that he gave us amen entrance she'll be ministered unto you amen amen the Holy Spirit is a token a downpayment of your inheritance amen the Holy Spirit of the Living God is a downpayment of your inheritance amen god has an inheritance in store in store for you a manna he gives you the Holy Spirit as a token anyway but let me tell you the Holy Spirit brings certain abilities certain attributes gives you permission gives you rights a meant to bring things out of heavenly places and set them here on the earth I mean it gives you permission though to to take things from heavenly places and like a king or a priest exercise Dominion in your domain Amen is not just on the inside of your body as a priest but Oh as a king you're exercising Dominion in the land that you live in Amen why so it's you or a no longer called desolate and your land is no longer called forsaken a man but you are called married and your land is well cultivated amen and cared for why because you are a king and priest your taking care of your heart your taking care of your soul and you are a priest you're taking care of the temple as a priest but as a king you're exercising Dominion of that inheritance to the outermost part of geography to the land you live in you're taking your inheritance the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're using it everywhere you go and bringing things from heavenly places and taking the situation's of your life and bringing them into compliance with heavenly places because it's your inheritance you've been given a downpayment therefore that down payment ought to be given to your land amen it's just like paying your tithes you know God gives the tithe to the ministry amen the Bible says God gave highest to the ministry so it cut them the God gives you the increase and you pass on 10% to the ministry a man God gives you the Holy Ghost and you pass that on to everybody around you they manage to draw from you amen God gives you the increase of the Holy Spirit you pay your tithes I'm ministering one to another God get fills you with love so you have love to give to someone else God fills you with patience so you have patience to get a little bit tighter than the patience to someone else hey man a little portion to somebody else God gives you 24 hours in a day so you can take time to help someone else out amen paying your tithing of your time tithing of your of the Holy Spirit tithing of the healing power that God has given you when you lay hands on someone else amen amen now you're a king priests unto our God and you're exercising your Dominion and you're showing that you've been filled with the Holy Ghost because the power is not just for you to hold down on the inside but the powers for you to express this power to a lost and dying world to a world that cannot see that is blind to the Christ that's all around them to the power of God is just waiting to transform this world back into a Garden of Eden and they don't even know that's getting ready to happen they don't know that this world is getting ready to be transformed back to the Garden of Eden they don't know it but we do know we not only do we know it but we've been given a down payment of the baptism of the whole ghost to exercise that garden of eden' all around us the peace that passes all understanding a man we have peace in our homes we have peace in our lives we have peace in our heart our mind our soul amen it's not just a psychological workup Amen but all the cliches of Christianity are actually true amen all the little sayings that people take for granted are actually true they're actually real a man in Christ really is in my heart the peace that passes all understanding has really been given to me amen amen amen the love that God the supernatural love that God has for me I really have experienced it it really does exist amen it's been given to me as an inheritance a man a complete and total victory that the God that created me in perfection I'm able to draw from that perfection I miss for that perfection to someone else amen that's why we're on this journey amen where we've seen the difference between forsaken and being cherished the difference between being desolate and being cultivated and farmed and bearing fruit we've seen the difference a man so we can hate the one and love the other a men a man let's just stand and when I saw him I felt his feet as though I was dead he laid his right hand upon me he said fear not for I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore and I have the keys of hell and of death amen and he told John write these things in a book sent it to the ages so all the world might know Amen that I am Alive for evermore and I'm willing to act on your behalf amen to bring you a total victory to bring you back to the Garden of Eden like it was before the fall amen so Jelena no longer be called forsaken abandoned beside your land to be called cherished loved cared for amen at the power of the Almighty God and whacked out on your behalf God is able to perform these things in your life he's giving you the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's a down payment it's a little token of what we'll experience over on the other side and we all go off to some other far place but heaven is all around just waiting to manifest itself upon this earth and even in one of these days in a moment in a twinkling of an eye will be changed a man from this this mortal shall put on immortality amen and this body will be changed into a body like his glorious body Amen it's possible it's gonna happen the promise I've received it waiting expected until it is manifest hey Melissa's bar hesitant word of Prayer Heavenly Father your promises are true and we believe them we receive them we trust him we're waiting for the Lord we don't wait as those that doubt fear for we have received the down payment put a little bit of portion of it ahead of time and a portion of eternity is still eternal Lord and so is your down payment more powerful than we could ever dream we believe in it we trust in it we exercise we use it in our life or we we believe as we fell down at your feet Lord one day like the woman with the alabaster box fell down at your feet and washed your feet you didn't stop her but you just allowed it and the two of you were in a worship service everybody else was filled on the outside of the worship service Simon all the Pharisees but the woman with the alabaster box you were sealed on the inside of the worship service as the spices and cents filled the room you were there you didn't stop her you just let her do it and Laura saw is it so that we worship you we adore you you laid your hand upon us you have the power of the death of the keys of death held in great to remove those things out of our life you've given us the token of the holy spirit made us kings and priests unto our God Lord we believe these scriptures and we're willing to act upon them Lord we pray reveal yourself in our life lore if there's anything in our life that's contrary to your vision let's remove it let's get out of there Lord or let it be and let as Mary said Lord let it be unto us Lord according to your word whatever you said Lord let's let let me like that Lord we love we need your revelation day by day show yourself to us so we might show you to others so if this lost nine world might see the peace that passes all understanding or we we can't wait until we have some desire inside of us Lord to reveal the land unto others so they might know why we stand where we stand why we do what we do we're acting according to a vision Lord let us be in - let it be in to us important to thy work let's take that vision loss thank you Father for all things thank you all for giving us power daughters [Music] amen if this sermon was the mysterious sermon at you doesn't have to be that way Amen God really does have a peace that passes all over he really does have a total victory for you a total overcoming so that the old things can pass away so the new things can become left so it's you I have to live bound by sin for the great but you can be received this Holy Ghost that will bring unto you heavenly places heavenly attributes heavenly abilities for heavenly peace heavily deliverance so you can have a small victory over death hell on the great Amen it's possible it's not just a story it's not just a dream it's not just something that men used to control one another or something like that but it's something that God has given unto the Bride of Christ so she can be changed from this mortal body but so she want immortality he meant so she can live and not just be a stranger unto Christ but son she be united with Christ she can be flesh of his flesh ball of his bone she has to say same as thoughts that he has the same ideas yes she's been molded to fit into his side a man saw that that hole were that Roman soldier putting spear we're out of his body flow of blood and water and
