TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God's word is God and so when we receive the true word then we're receiving God yes I'd like to carry on with my thought this morning I'm taking a slight uh change in Direction but I'm building upon what we studied this morning let's turn our uh to our Bibles here in Revelations chap 3 uh verse 14 I just want to read one verse there and I want to preach tonight on the amen and uh this morning morning I was dealing with the promised land that those those ancient landmarks were territorial absolutes and so I want to deal with uh our absolute in this hour Revelations 3 verse 14 everybody love the Lord amen you're very familiar with this this is directly to our age and unto the angel of the Church of the Le oans write these things say the amen I want you to notice Jesus Christ in red writing is calling himself the amen the faithful and the true witness the beginning of the creation of God I want to read it one more time and unto the angel the Church of the leans write these things saith the amen the faithful and the true witness the beginning of the creation of god let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we we thank you for the worship we thank you for the word we thank you for your spirit God we just thank you Lord for all that you've done God your grace is so wonderful and father we ask dear God you just bring us into more dimensions of that Grace this evening God we commit our souls to you now in Jesus holy name amen you have your seats how many appreciate the grace of God Amen the Bible said no man will boast we are depending upon the grace of God I want to once again preach this evening on the uh the amen and Jesus is Calling himself here the amen and I looked at the definition where with some a word that we use at least Christians we use it every service we say it in our conversations and we know amen means so be it but another definition means firm or faithful it means uh surely truly of a truth it it means so be it and uh it was custom in the synagogues and Christian assemblies in the days of old that after they had offered solemn prayer to God the others responded amen and thus made the substance of what was uttered their own so when the word of God goes forth from the pulpit and you say Amen then you're saying you're taking the substance of what was said is saying that's mine so when you say God Is A Healer you say amen and say that's mine that's mine when he says he's the Savior that's mine he's my husband my breath my sunshine my all in all and you amen and you say that's mine I claim it ain't that wonderful and then the nation the individual could aim in the word or even the nation of Israel would amen the word and what they were saying is the nation would confirm the Covenant by saying amen they were saying I receive the Covenant how many ever heard that brother bam said that this Grace Covenant is an unconditional Covenant amen amen well you got to remember it is unconditional but the part of the Covenant the Covenant is an agreement yeah so you say well if it's unconditional why isn't the lost you know just God just saving them well you got to accept it amen and upon the basis of agreeing and saying amen then it becomes yours and it's an unconditional Covenant to you how many receive that Grace tonight notice this in Jeremiah 11 just to use an example of the word amen in Jeremiah 11:1 he says the words that came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying hear ye the words of this Covenant and speak unto the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and say unto them thus sayith the Lord God of Israel curse said be the man that obeth not the words of this Covenant which is commanded your fathers in in the day in which I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt from the iron furnace saying obey my voice do them according to all which I command you and so shall you be my people and I will be your God and that I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey as it is this day then answered I Jeremiah and said so be Lord amen I received the Covenant that you promised to my fathers once again when you said amen that response is making what is uttered theirs am it's important to amen the word of God notice in Deuteronomy chapter 27:15 as I just kind of start building here Deuteronomy 27:15 he says cursed be the man that maketh any Graven or molten image or an uh an abomination unto the Lord the work of the hands of the Craftsman and putteth it in a secret place and all the people shall answer and say Amen cursed be he that sth light by his father or his mother and all the people shall say Amen cursed be he that removeth his neighbor's landmark and all the people shall say Amen cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way and all the people shall say Amen cursed be he that prefer judgment and it goes on cursed be he that lith with his father's wife cursed be he that layth with any manner of Beast cursed be he that lth with his sister curs to being as layth with his mother-in-law or smidth his neighbor taketh the reward of the innocent and and they all said amen because they were saying we believe it we receive that amen isn't that right then brother Brandon makes an astounding uh statement to me it was he said uh amen he said many times an absolute is the last word and we call the amen amen so brother random said the word amen is an absolute yes sir amen can you believe can you believe that amen and I brother brandom gave many examples of an absolute because I'm dealing with the amen tonight Jesus said I am the amen and brother brandom said a ship is on a Raging Sea and it may have a a sail and it's at the mercy of the wind and he said if the waves go to crashing and there's enough water he said it could sink the ship he said it drops thousands of pounds of metal called an anchor and he said it'll drop beneath the ocean and it'll Connect into a great Mountain under the water and he said the waves will hit it the waves will strike it but it cannot sink it because it is anchored in a mountain under the water amen ain't that right right so an amen is like a solid rock that I'm tied to an amen is an absolute that when everything is falling apart and the world is falling apart I have an anchor I have an absolute let the world pass away but I'm anchored in the Son of God he is my amen he is my sovet he is my finality ain't that wonderful brother ROM said that job was connected to that same absolute when I was talking about him this morning when the devil Unleashed his his his uh Powers upon job job never moved because the birth sacrifice was his absolute even if they said you're a secret sinner he said I've come the provided way even if he said your God hates you and you've lost everything if the devil lied to he would stand upon that unmovable we'll never survive this age unless we have an absolute is that okay how many have an absolute of the Soul talking about driving down a state it is our absolute the sacrifice was job's absolute he hung his soul on it all hell tried to move him but could not how many love the Lord amen because he was anchored in a promise of God called the burnt sacrifice but you know the Bible says all say all oh the Bible said all the promises of God are yay and amen amen it isn't just our sacrifice healing is good for you peace is good for you love is good for you anything in the word of God it is yay and it is amen but you want to watch what your absolute is I've seen many come into my assembly and their absolute become some social Gathering or sometimes if you're not careful the pastor can become the ACT abolute if you're not careful there's there's uh different your girlfriend or your boyfriend or your mother or whatever it may be you must make sure you have the right absolute and Jesus said I am the amen I am the absolute and right I'm the final word the Bible is the amen the Bible is the absolute brother R told a story that he used to go with a little girlfriend before he got married and he said that they were good people Nazarene people and he said it's Daddy and him her daddy and him uh used to talk scripture all the time and he said that he invited him over and said why don't you come spend a night with me brother Bill and so brother Venom came to his house the women went upstairs and the father laid on the floor downstairs and they would go around about baptism in Jesus Christ's name and brother brandom said one night they talked till about one and he said I went to sleep on it and he said ' I dreamed I was uh the man told brother brandom he said I dreamed that I was building he was a construction worker a building in New Albany and he said a man left me a blueprint and he said he went to Florida and he had on the blueprint a certain bay window and I said that man don't want that bay window there so I just left it off and when the man come back he said I will not pay you for the building until you tear it down and rebuild it according to the blueprint he said what you make of that brother brandom he said there's a creek right down here it isn't very far and that man went and was baptized in Jesus Christ's name because it was an absolute and he was showing just by a simple illustration that to a construction worker the blueprint is the absolute his ideas doesn't matter anyone's opinion doesn't matter he's got to build it according to the blueprint everyone love the Lord am brother Brandon talked about the North Star thank you so much the North Star he said it hangs in the heaven any Hunter he said your your uh uh North Star is what guides you your compass it points to the north star and he said that is is an absolute to get your bearing and this is what he said that was so beautiful to me he said an absolute takes away all fear amen amen see you wouldn't question the North Star am you wouldn't question am I going the right way if if if you see the north star with Assurance you can get your bearing and say I know that I arrive to my destination because it isn't going to change it's something that will always be men will change anes will change cultures will change but the absolute will not change and he said so he said it settles it we're anchored it takes the fear away and that's what I want to do this morning is to show you when we're standing in faith in God's word it takes away your fear and you can stand like joob had that right brother the ROM said a red light in traffic is an absolute as simple as it may sound he said if there were no red lights it would be total chaos he said but when they come and that red light says stop you stop or you going to pay the price a that right and brother bom said uh and of a baseball game he said could you imagine the confusion if there was no umpire he said and everyone would be just arguing it back and forth but there has to be an authority there has to be something that when he speaks whether he's right or not everyone's got to submit to the absolute is that wonderful another place brother Ram said the Supreme Court was an amen it was an absolute he said it is the final end of all arguments he said the court will make a decision you go no further than that decision you may not agree with their decision but you will not go any further because they are the absolute as the Supreme Court can I carry on and so we find that there are Baptist doctrines there are Lutheran doctrines there are Pentecostal doctrines there are Methodist doctrines Pilgrim Holiness and they've got all kinds of the uh uh Creeds and denominations and the people are in utter confusion yeah but nonetheless God calls himself the amen he says this in Isaiah chapter 65:6 I have quite a few quotes if this is all right in Isaiah 65:16 you may be familiar with this scripture and he who blesses himself in the Earth shall bless himself in the god of Truth and if you break down that word truth and Define it it is the god of the amen and he that swear in the Earth shall swear by the god of the amen because the former troubles are forgotten and because they are HID from my eyes brother benam said this in the Lan church he said he is the god of the amen he never changes he does never change he says it it stands fast he does it and it's done forever none can take from what he does none can add to it so let it be amen so let it be he said aren't you glad you serve that kind of God you know you can know exactly where you are with him any time all the time he is the amen God he will not change you know where you stand with God you know who God is what he done when he redeemed you and you don't have to worry about it changing on you his grace will be right there for you this healing will be right there for you and that Wonder the amen means the last word brother bam said it's an absolute I've used it many times it is the last word and he said it is the ultimate it means you reached the end there is no other court of appeal it goes as far as God and it stops can I carry on so I ask you and I and now we're going to go in a little deeper the word is our absolute yes let me go further amen is it the sealed word or the revealed word because there's a difference because every denomination in this city has a Bible amen but where will it put them in the Rapture is it truly their absolute though they quote for from it and brother bam said this uh that God the interpretation of the the word comes to the prophet how many believe that Bible said God at Sun Dr times in div diverse manner spake to the fathers by the prophets and the Bible said that no Prophecy of the scriptures of any private interpretation therefore it is a sealed book and we have no thought coming we have no comments coming it takes God who wrote the book to interpret the book A that right so yes the written word is an absolute but the reation of the word and the manifested word and the Vindicated word is absolutely an absolute in this house notice this Jeremiah the Lord said I have put my words in your mouth so let me ask you where is the absolute yes Lord is God's word the absolute amen God said I put my words in that prophet's mouth he said it in the days of Joel that the word of the Lord came to Joel he said the word of the Lord came to Jonah the word of the Lord came to Micah the word of the Lord came to Zephaniah I want you to know the word of the Lord came to Jesus amen and and he had the authority of the Prophet when they said you are a man and you're making yourself God it was God making himself man and he said you are Gods to whom the word of God came God looked at Moses and said I have made you a god unto Pharaoh why was he a God because he was packing the absolute to the people God always let me say more specifically yes the word is the absolute but notice the revealed word the Vindicated word is the absolute to the hour amen I want you to notice Abel's revelation God Vindicated God Vindicated Noah God Vindicated Moses god Vindicated Elijah Mount Carmel God Vindicated the prophet and God will always vindicate his absolute is this okay in other words God will get the last word in other words that God uh man will deny God's word but God will vindicate his absolute ain't that right remember the time that Jeremiah prophesied that that uh the children of Israel would go into captivity for 70 years and then hananiah the prophet came and said oh no God will break the Yoke of Babylon in two years years and Jeremiah surprisingly said amen and he said but I want to say something the prophet that prophesies peace which was Hanah he said that Prophet will be known after what he says comes to pass so in other words that what Hanah said was according to the scripture but it was not an absolute because God did not vindicate it remember the words of Samuel it was not Samuel's words it was God's words and God's words is an absolute and God would not let his words fall to the ground ain't that right we're in a world of religious confusion in the days of Jesus it was religious confusion and some of the Sadducees said there is no resurrection and Jesus looked at him and said you do Heir concerning the scriptures and the power of God you're off on both of them and they had a Bible that they boasted on he called them blind leaders of the blind though they possessed the Bible amen now notice God Vindicated his message when Jesus said if you don't believe me believe the works for the works testify that I am the absolute in this day amen is that right that's right notice he said uh it was Nicodemus said no man could do this except in these Miracles except God was with him Jesus perceived their thoughts in many places the Bible said the word of God discerned thoughts is this all right now remember the scripture that I read in the Old Testament brother Ram said this in the late oan Church age he is the god of the amen he never changes what he does never changes he says it and it stands fast and it's done forever none can take or add to it he said aren't you glad you serve that kind of God it is Dependable it is reliable it is unmovable it is unchangeable come on it is the amen it is the absolute you can hang your soul on it and hang your children's Souls on it God interprets his own words he said let every man be a liar and mine be the truth how many believe the word of God Amen means finality amen means so be it the book of Romans was closed with the word amen First Corinthians was closed but amen Second Corinthians Galatians Ephesians Philippians Colossians first Thessalonians second Thessalonians First Timothy second Timothy Titus Filman Hebrews first Peter second Peter first John second John Jude and Revelation and the very last word of the Bible is amen so be it amen it's mine I receive it the amen The Authority the last word how many believe that brother R said it is reached its end he said I am the amen here's another one brother R said Hallelujah here is Jehovah the old the god of the amen here is Jesus of the New Testament he is the god of the amen amen here o Israel the Lord your God is one he said there it is again Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new he said notice the New Testament does not reveal another God it is a further revelation of the one and the same God Jesus Is God and the father they're one there is one God and his name is the Lord Jesus and in this last age in the in the Ephesus age he said these things right he that holds the Seven Stars and walks in the midst of the golden candlesticks in the second age he said these things are he the first and the last which was the dead and alive again in the third age he said these things sayith he with the sharp sword with two edges in the fourth age he said these things saith the Son of God whose eyes are as flame of fire and his feet as fine brass in the fifth age he said these things have he with the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars and the sixth age these things say he that is Holy and he that is true that has the Key of David he said that openeth and no man can shut and shut and no man can open but in the seventh age which is the last age he said unto the angel of the Church of the L of he has right these things sayith the amen am in the seventh age he was coming to the end yes he was coming to the finality amen and brother randam said notice it is not revealed unto the church ages until the denominational ages have run out and time shall be no more it's only revealed after the denominational ages have run out that's the reason the thing is scrupled up they pick up a little Doctrine they run over here and say this is it another picks up another Doctrine runs over here and says this is it each one builds denomination until we got hundreds of denominations but still in the midst of it all he said in all the confusion the people are wondering what is truth amen and in the seventh age God reveals himself as the amen amen Jesus is giving himself this description in relation to the last age the days of grace are winding up his look from the first century right through the 20th and all these things concerning the ages but before he reveals the characteristics of the last age he gives us one final look at his gracious Supreme deity this is the Capstone revelation of himself thus saith the amen Jesus is the soet of God it stands for finality it stands for approval amen it stands for prevailing promise it stands for unchanging promise listen it stands for the Seal of God how they want to be sealed by the amen you see what the message is it's more than just another message he said I like that it means whatever he said is final yes it means whatever he said in the first stage second in all the ages his own true church and about the false Vine is exactly right and it won't change it means what he started out in Genesis he will finish in Revelation he has to because he is the amen now we can see again the devil hates the Book of Genesis and the Book of Revelation he hates the truth he knows the truth will prevail he knows what his hand will be he fights that but we are on The Winning Side I mean the Believers of his word only are on the amen side you love the Lord can I carry on a little further I know this is a lot of reading but I think it'll bless you brother B said the Baptists have their Creeds and dogmas and it's based upon what they call the absolute and you can't shake them they say the apostolic days and miracles are over and there is no baptism of the Holy Ghost subsequent to believing yes and they will hold the absolute and argue to you in your face this is the absolute then brother bam said the methodus based on the word says there is no water baptism sprinkling is not baptism and sanctification is the baptism of the Holy Ghost so they hold up the absolute and they say sanctification is the Holy Ghost and brother the B said the Church of Christ he said they major on regeneration ational baptism and too many cases go down wet Sinners and come up uh or dry Sinners and come up wet ones and they claim their Doctrine is word based and then he said go right down the line to the Pentecostals this coming out the church ages do they have the word give them the word test he said they'll sell out for sensation every time if you if you can produce a manifestation like oil and blood and tongues and signs whether in the word or not whether properly interpreted from the word and the majority will fall for it so brother R now is just those are a couple examples but the list goes on and on he says what is happened to the word the word has been put aside but now in the seventh age God says I'm going against you all and I'm going to skew you out of my mouth for this is the end listen seven out of Seven Ages have esteemed men's word above his word and so this is the end and I'm spewing you out he said it's all over and I'm going to speak I'm here in the midst of the church the amen of God faithful and true and will reveal himself by my Prophet revelations 10:7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery of God will be finished as he declared to his servants the prophets he said there it is he's sending a Vindicated prophet he is sending a prophet almost after 2,000 years someone who will be far from organization and education and World religion as John the baptism old he will hear only from God he will have thus sayth the Lord for he will speak for God he will be God's mouthpiece he will as it's declared in Malachi 4:6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he will bring back the elect of the last day and they will hear the Vindicated prophet and give the exact truth as it was with Paul he will restore the truth as they had it and those El with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and will be the body and be his voice and perform his works and he said do you see it because once again God always vindicates his act salute so the denominational ages had their chance to talk but in this last day Jesus said I will talk for myself and he does it by a mouthpiece for the brand is not God for the brand is of my fall and the spirit is speaking through him and the Believers are receiving it and when they receive it they are receiving their absolute do you believe that God is vindicating his absolute every doctrine that brother ROM preached was word-based amen every Doctrine he preached was word-based and then notice people say well brother renam went crazy and uh and you know just went off on his Doctrine I want to ask ask you if he went off in his Doctrine why did God Amen in amen how was it that thousands times 10,000s of discernment was 100% accurate how was he never wrong why was God vindicating a lie the Lord am why is there a picture today in the Library of Congress pull it up on the internet Library of Congress William Mary and brandham and he's hanging there how many hear their picture at the Library of Congress well there's a good reason why it's in there you just don't get your picture hung in the Library of Congress amen the only supernatural being a to be photographed on film why did God vindicate him if he was a false prophet and then the cloud people now are really attacking the cloud the seven angels the first time brother brandham ever speaks of the Seven Angels was in a message called standing in the Gap and brother brandom shows look this is Christ and mean and God just showed it to him and he begins to expound the Seven Angels were descending with the message and he's going on and on and he then preaches his sermon but at the end of the sermon it's astounding a man falls dead in the congregation by the name of brother Wayne and brother Bram says settle down he walks down off the pulpit prays and a dead man is brought back back to life again why did God Amen act if he was telling a lie oh just Amen in your own word amen do you believe that how many believe that with all their heart if then the message is the Vindication of God if it is the amen message then we need to be very careful how we handle Holiness yes because brother random says if a woman wear that which pertaining to a man or vice versa it is an Abomination if a man look upon a woman in such it's an Abomination a that right and brother R makes several statements like this he said some of those women on the platform their dresses above their knees notice they're wearing dresses are cut so tight it shows every form and every move they make until their underneath clothes is sh them through their dresses it's as bad as shorts bikin or anything you Pentecostal blind lean preachers how long will God suffer you I don't know he God God be merciful to your blind eyes and give you eyes s amen so is this just for the ROM's opinion he was just kind of hard in this area he preferred or capitalized upon this area or was it Jesus Christ the amen here's another one he said notice he said you say brother bandom I don't wear shorts I wear slacks he said that's worse yeah the Bible said of a woman to put on that which pertained to a man is an Abomination and the Lord and God doesn't change and you wear those little old skirts sticking of skirts so tight that you're going down the street until it looks like the skin is on the outside you call yourself Holiness women look who he's talking to you're not talking about them out there is that the way a daughter of God would act well see now if you don't look at the message as an absolute then you can just pick and choose that's right but if you see what's behind the message you will see the amen that's trying to get us Rapture Ready is this okay Amen brother bam said it again uh world is falling apart today years ago we used to find people in deep sincerity and worship and today it's become a bunch of Glamour in Hollywood and he said train music women on the platform with their clothes so tight and enough the skin on the outside almost dancing around the platform no sincere almost making outright ridiculous shame and professing Christianity I wonder if our offerings haven't become a stink in the nostrils of God here's another one he said you walk down bob hair Jezebel said don't know it's what th say the Lord means walk out here with a skinned looking dress and don't know you're guilty with committing adultery every day with hundreds of men that's not my absolute I'm just reading the absolute amen How could somebody argue when God comes down and amens at every service when he discerns and said now to show you it's not me God comes down and we're waiting on him and God comes and does what men cannot do and we look in the face of God and take it lightly yes I'm not trying to be a legalist preacher but this is the word and we M we amen the word brother B said the Holy Spirit punctuates every word of God with amen he said if a man has the baptism of the Holy Ghost he will amen the word he said true Faith always admits the word is right if your faith don't punctuate every word of God with amen then there's something wrong with your experience once you recognize it as God then you say I accept it Lord on your terms amen takes all the fear away the word is our absolute yes but I want to balance the statement now is this okay yes brother Brenham says this he is my absolute he is my stand here is my tist there's where I stand and if I've got the wrong thing God will not confirm it that's right if you've got the right thing God is obligated to confirm it there you are and the proof of it's the proof of it God is obligated to prove it's right or he'll have nothing to do with it ain't that wonderful I want you to notice now if I can go just a little further brother randam was talking about the pillar of fire that Paul met and he said that Pillar of Fire became Paul's TI poost and brother benam said the same Pillar of Fire has reappeared doing the same Works in this age and he said Brethren don't sleep don't you see that's the same God Among Us Now proving himself the same yesterday today and forever listen to this he said that is my absolute well brother Craig I thought the written word was this is a sealed book without Jesus Christ coming and saying his part amen and this Revelation is Jesus Christ the final word amen when all the men had their days to speak now God comes down and God speaks you say the Bible is my absolute not the message the message is the Bible made manifest in this day and we can go and show every scripture that God said it would be here this is the manifestation just like just like Peter said this is that this is the manifestation of what Jo preached and I'll say this is that Malachi 4 Luke 1730 Revelations 10 Revelations 18 it goes on and on and on this is that you say brother Craig that was 50 years ago a message is to the entire age I was it born in 1963 but I'm still enjoying the same blessings and Revelation because it's to the age isn't that right but said that the word was led to each age then it goes on further to say that God in a pillar of fire met Moses at one time and he said uh Moses he said knew he was chosen this is what brother random said but he didn't have an absolute that's what he said and he said one day on The Backs side of the desert he had lost the vision God appeared in a burning bush bush and told him I'm sending you down to deliver my people and he said I don't speak well and and so forth they won't believe me he said what is in your hand and he said it's a serpent he said cast it down he threw it down and it became a serpent he picked it up it became a stick he said he was giving him the Assurance of vindication when God gives an absolute he vindicates the absolute always always say always always he vindicates the absolute always so Moses had went down he threw down his stick according to the word of the Lord and Jades and jambre impersonators done the same thing that God told him to do and Moses he didn't start crying and say it failed he had an absolute and he stood right there and said I did exactly what God required and as he waited Moses serpent started gobbling out the impersonator serpents amen the brother vom said this Moses followed his commandment he stand and watched the glory of God he was tied to his absolute and he stood still amen and when the serpent swallowed up the other serpents he was tied to his absolute now the enemy in every way will try to get you away from that absolute we need an absolute the pope right now is the most popular man that has ever been Israel is becoming isolated we are more in danger nuclear war than ever Sodom is on a on such a a just a tsunami they're just rising and the Christian is being silenced communism is infiltrating every end of the world we need an absolute it's getting dark and they're going to shut down these churches and we need an absolute something Vindicated something that we can have Assurance here that we'll stand in the face of its darkness and say God will be here God promised it we won't Buckle we won't back down we are anchored in a solid rock though the waves roll and though the persecutions come we have a Vindicated absolute a that right Satan discredits it he esteem lightly esteemed it the values it and he said the devil get you in a place where you don't know what to do remember you are tied to an abute that same Pillar of Fire that was Moses at absolute is the same Pillar of Fire today and it's our absolute it's the same Christ can you say amen Amen brother bam says something pretty amazing he says the shunamite woman when her baby died she went she got her her little mule or whatever it was and she went up to see the prophet and he said you know God has hid this from my eyes and when he said is all well she said all is well he said why he said this the woman's absolute was the prophet and he said the prophet's absolute was God and she could not say all this well she wasn't moved even at the death of her son because she knew God was in the prophet and the word comes to the prophet ain't that wonderful see the written word is infallible but men's interpretations are not right that's the problem so God's got to interpret itself because he's the author of it amen now remember Paul on the road to Damascus he was a student of the written word but he did not know the absolute until he met the pillar of fire and that Pillar of Fire he was still in Gross Darkness even though a student of the written word but it took light shined upon his path to bring him to the revelation of Jesus Christ he that right he came in contact with the living absolute amen and Christ was Paul's absolute it changed his life and and brother randam said that Paul became tied to that absolute for the rest of his life he said when he met God Vindicated by the word it settled it for the rest of his life he said because he seen God manifested and it was proven God by the word in the shape and the form and the audable voice of what it was this is okay he was tied to it there was something real he know it and nobody could take it away from it it was an absolute Assurance they stoned him three times but he was tied he had a shipwreck but he was tied they put him in prison his old men turned against him but he was tied to an absolute and so much he can look at death right in the face of say death where is I still oh grave where is I victory in so much he could pray and God refused to heal it and he'd say my grace is sufficient his faith did not waver he knew his grace was sufficient he was tied to the absolute that whatever come come he had Assurance amen the shite woman's absolute was the prophet The Prophet's absolute was God and Paul said follow me as I follow Christ because he was the mouthpiece to God we had no thoughts coming Ain that right brother R makes this statement he said I've got to come to one final absolute and he said oh here it is let let me back up he said now I'm not trying to assert Authority conduct an order 196 63 he said any man has two heads he doesn't know how to go God never did have two heads to his church he's always had one head he always dealt with every generation as we studied it through the scripture through one individual because you got two men they got two opinions I want you to notice every one of us in here have a different fingerprint every one of us in here have a different nose every one of us in here we think different and so we can look at the same absolute and come with two totally different conclusions and disagree because every man thinks he's right in his own eyes so God has to come down and interpret his own word uh and vindicate it to prove that this is my interpretation said it's got to come to one final absolute and that's the word the Bible as the pastor here of the church he said my absolute is the word and I know you Brothers kind of look at me as an absolute as long as I follow God you follow me as I follow Christ so I ask you that he follow Christ am I read you one I know I'm reading a lot but I thought it might bless you tonight brother said this now when the angel of the Lord speaks there's nothing that can stand before it it is an absolute he said my faith I know it's going to happen there's no need of saying anything more about it it's got to happen and if a person had been dead in the grave for 20 years and he would say go down and speak I would believe all Heaven would shake out of its orbit before that prayer would be refused to be answered God will do it and that's when it's really thus sayith the Lord how many believe this message is thus say the Lord God Vindicated it it was just like the boy at Finland brother vom was up on that mountain looking at a tower and he saw some cars and some ambulances down at the bottom of the hill and in that day they couldn't do anything until the parents got there and they said it looked like there had been an accident and brother randam and they drove down the hill when they got there you know the story Gordon Lindsay walked out and it was a boy car hit two boys and threw his body against the tree and crushed him brother ROM had this Vision two years before and then Jack Moore went and looked at him and come back crying and said brother brandom you ought to go look at this boy brother said I can't do it I got kids at home and pretty soon brother random went and they said pull the sheet back and he pulled it back and there was the boy and he said something looked familiar about the boy and he said he turned and started to walk to the car and that same hand that turned him around this morning turned him around at this scene and he said he turned and looked and all of a sudden something sometimes God's got to turn us around sometimes God is right there and he's got to tap us on the shoulder to get our attention and so he had to get the prophet's attention cuz he's like you and I we never would have saw him except God didn't turn us around he stops he looks at the boy he looks at the crowd he looks at the Rocks he looks at the trees and the wind laughing in the rain and he said something is familiar and he walked back and said show me that boy again and they pulled it back and all of a sudden the spirit of the Lord revealed to him this is the one I told you about two years prior yesen that wonderful and he said there was Jack Moore there everything was written in the Bible he said what was it an a absolute the father had showed me what would take place and there was no fear standing there absolute sure he'll rise amen right there in front of thousands people were saying this is that Prophet there were there's about 300 rather that was making fun of him and he said uh they he said but he didn't fear he said what was it the absolute listen to what he said the vision amen amen then he brings it to the word he said uh I do what the father says he that believeth me the works that I do he should do also there's your absolute he said he said I said death you can't hold him no longer am God has spoken amen come back and give him up and he said that boy raised and looked around and the people went to fad he said it was signed by the mayor of the city and the Republic what is it an absolute that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever when those seven angels come down and form the face of Christ brother brandom said brother brandom said Paul when he met the pillar of fire knew that it was God's absolute and he said God come down at the river and he knew the same and then when brother bam said the seven angels come down and he said they met him and science took the picture he said it's a paradox but it was an absolute he said it tied me tight into Jesus Christ winding his life into me he said that seven angels was an absolute why because it was the word Revelations 10 1-7 is this all right God was completing the Plan of Redemption so God amened his own word I want to say this we know what we stand on every word of God is true but it takes God to interpret and tell us what is and when God interprets it and vindicates it and gives it to us it is our absolute I'll Stand Here Without Shame before you this end time message that your pastor preaches is the absolute to this age it is Jesus Christ revealed again in Holy Spirit form in Bride form amen and God was saying men have spoken up now I'll come down and speak Let It Be Your absolute let TI your soul upon have complete confidence in because it will change your body at the day of the Resurrection it'll raise the dead those that had confidence in the word throughout the ages it'll raise them from the grave at the day of the Resurrection I'm so confident that this word is sent from God I know that it'll put you into a in in an immortal body it'll put you in a glorified condition and you'll escape the wrath to God if I did believe that I wouldn't preach it to my church I wouldn't preach it to my family I wouldn't do it myself but I brother man said we must be convinced we must be concerned and once we're concerned and convinced we can hang our entire life on and we can stand there and wait and know with assurance that though in the darkest hour and it may get very dark in the darkest hour no matter what comes if we can't pay our bills if they shut our churches down if they kick us out of our houses we can stand there just like Moses and said I have fulfilled his word he can't fail he will be here amen I'll give you word because thou H has kept the word of my patience I will keep thee in the hour of Temptation that shall come upon the whole world to try them that's God's word keep this word live this word amen don't take any of it lightly it's Holiness it's standards applying the token you follow it to the letter they said brother brandom they said will people do Miracles he said Moses has done the Miracles he said the other people followed that's what he said we believe in the Miracles we've seen too many not to but what I'm saying is this Faithfully follow the messenger as you believe that he's the messenger of Christ isn't that wonderful and so I don't want I don't want to be misunderstood when when because some people will say oh the Bible is my absolute not the message they don't know what they're saying because this message is the Bible we wouldn't be following it we wouldn't follow one bit of it but it's the word manifested for this day therefore it's our absolute amen God bless you you love him let us stand to our feet have a word of prayer gracious Eternal Father we thank you dear Lord for somewhere to stand in this age at length dear God we have preached today Lord about the ancient Landmark which was a territorial absolute that showed us where we were God tonight Lord we looked at the amen and we saw what you done truly we have seen Christ in this age and we thank you for it God we tie our souls to it just as Paul just as Moses father we're depending on it it takes the fear away so we know where we're standing I pray dear God give us further Revelation and understanding of this great message that you sent let us be great stewards of the mysteries of God let us be faithful about this commission and Lord the responsibility you put in our hands father may we preach it Faithfully without compromise over the favor of man God I pray dear Lord for this assembly God how they warm my heart encourage my heart to hear the amens of the word to stand and become identified with the message Lord to stand and Lord as God that pillar fires in a picture behind us we're not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ it is the power of God under salvation yes many are turning away many don't see it but Lord we're so thankful when everything is being shaken God we can stand on the solid rock tonight we love you so much we ask to blessings in our lives bless this church bless brother Brooks bless everyone here oh God that puts an effort into holding the banner High we love you so much and we ask it in Jesus name amen
