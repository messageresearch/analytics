Corinthians 13th chapter we read the uh 10th to the 13th verse there then we'll go to St John 1 I trust everybody had a lovely [Music] Easter amen we we enjoyed ours Hallelujah glad to have our brother Eugene back it was such a good time when I saw him there in Iowa City at the wedding and his wife everybody was one surely God is good good amen let's go 1 Corinthians 13 10-3 but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away child this things but now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am [Music] known now Abed faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is love amen St John 1 we also want to I just remembered that I have a prayer request we'll be praying for my son and his new job my wife is at home Afflicted Satan is uh trying to afflict her with ERS in the knees and we want to pray for a sister Sheila Sheil lives in Trinidad and she's uh she's diabetic and she's being truly mistreated there in the hospital so much so that the nurses are cursing at her not not not changing her and not feeding her it's just that they they giving her a real bad time sister Sheila if you can remember her in pray we're going to read the scriptures and then we'll come back to prayer okay St John 1 1-9 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John that same came for witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was set to Bear witness of that light that was the True Light which lith every man that cometh into the world amen let us pray our gracious father God we thank you for your mercy and your grace thank you for the reading of the word and father we pray that you would break the bread for us tonight feed our souls Lord give us what we stand in need of most of all give us peace in our souls we pray also Lord that you would be merciful to my wife touch her heal her Lord deliver her from this Affliction we pray also for sister Sheila God we've been praying for her since yesterday and we know that you are a God that answer prayers Lord if our sister Sheil have sinned or done any evil against you we pray that you forgive her Lord cleanse her from all her unrighteousness and heal her body that she walk out of that hospital as a testimony Hallelujah also Lord we pray for my son Isaiah he's having a difficult time on the job the father his main ambition is to show the Christian Side Christian Life and I pray father that you would give him the strength to do so give the wisdom Hallelujah open the door to the light that he may walk in that light Lord have mercy upon him him strength in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated I have been uh just really thinking about a lot of things living in dangerous times even the world knows that something's about to happen we have been taught by brother brandham uh that when God does things in the uh Sky signs and things like that happens we know that God is speaking to us and he said before anything happens on Earth God declare it in the heavens now we don't know the day nor the hour this is the season hallelujah hallelujah I entitled my message him face to face I thought about that and I said when you see someone face to face there no way you can confuse the identity because you're there you see the features of that person if you to see that person again you always remember that face I'm the kind of person I can remember the face not the name in this case when you're face to face to God you never will forget his name Hallelujah Hallelujah one thing we know he is the word made flesh Hallelujah Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy we know that he is God hallelujah hallelujah in my notes I God he must first be seen as his word he is revealed as God hallelujah hallelujah and in this we know everybody can't see him everybody can't hear him and most of the people can't recognize Hallelujah some people think he's a historical God some people think that he's not God at all some think he's a prophet or one famous man one thing God says in his word sheep can hear his voice his sheep will hear his Hallelujah they know when it is him and as sheep knows the voice of its mother so does a child of God knows the voice of when we look at God we know that God is a spirit and the Bible says if you're going to worship Him you must worship Him in spirit and Truth with all of the things that are taking place now world uh Satan will try to put a fear on you but I trust by the message tonight walk out of here with a peace Hallelujah first of all you can't add one Cupid to your St and we know that the only Perfection that we could ever come into is perfection which is given to us hallelujah hallelujah and we understand that our righteousness is fil through Rags Hallelujah so why would we threat when we know that the Lord God is on our side there were times in the Old Testament they they they couldn't see him as we see him they they saw him as a pillar of fire they seen him as Angels but this generation sees him as the whole word we see him as the Alpha and the omegel Hallelujah and we don't have to we we understand that our Salvation is not built upon hope hallelujah hallelujah our foundation has already been laid and that that Foundation is Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah and to understand who we are we must understand the things that has already been given if God did not give you faith in him you wouldn't have any so first of all it wasn't me it wasn't you that came to God God chose you and when God chose you he gave fath Hallelujah you understand me everything we have everything we own has been given to us by God hallelujah hallelujah and and and and when you can see that when God becomes clear to you you feel like like Paul did in in him we me live in him we move in him we all have all beings all of our substance is about him and when we began to see him we began to understand him but until we can see him we won't be able to understand him one of things that caught my attention when Paul was on his way to persecute the Christians on his way to Damascus and we find out that God the light of God sh upon Paul he he either fell from his horse but whatever way it was Paul looking up into a light that just blinded him Paul never met Jesus perhaps never knew what he looked like Hallelujah but here on the road to Damascus hallelujah hallelujah Paul come to recognize Jesus not in the human form he had already gone back to the light of God we call it the pillar of fire and Paul asked him uh uhh who art thou Lord and he said I am Jesus why persecuted thou me when did God when did Paul persecute Jesus he persecuted Jesus when he stoned Steven he persecuted Jesus when he threw the the other disciples and all of the Christians Jesus he caused a lot of the Believers to blaspheme hallelujah what Paul didn't see is that when he was seeing the face of those Christians he was seeing the face of God hallelujah hallelujah yes God IM Mor now in his Bri form many M body every one of us that have a lick of fire are the temple of God hallelujah that's why God said love one another is that right a man must love his own body come on some God loves his body in the beginning was the word and I want to say it like this when God the spirit thought of his son Jesus you were there you were in him this is what I I love this because when God thought of Adam he was in there now watch this now because when they were created God brought for God made them on the same they put he put them back on the same plane they had the same name that right the only difference one was male and the other was female Hallelujah but when God created Adam that's what scripture says he created male and female y'all understand me this is why Jesus in the word says thoughted not robbery to be equal with God then he comes to say let this mind you better understand what I'm talking about because you're going to need what I'm talking about right now this be in you that was also in Christ Jesus we're not talking about a man we're talking about a God man Hallelujah we talk about God women women with the Holy Ghost man with the Holy amen once you get the Holy Ghost now you are declaring you are a different speci hallelu God has given you a special order special desire Hallelujah can I say it like this we are of a higher order than the original that's the Bible the Bible said the first Adam was flesh but the second Adam was a quickening spirit amen a higher order Hallelujah and the only way you will be able to accept it is that you must see him Hallelujah and when I say see him you must understand his word is him is his word hallelujah and his word cannot change Hallelujah this is what brother brand was trying to tell us why are you fearful why are you sad when now God is taking away your Amnesia by way of the word one time we were just Sinners saved by grace but now God has taking us he saved us by his grace when we were sinner right but he came to do what change us take away the sinner's nature put in us his divine nature and his divine nature is God hallelujah that's what James say don't be like the man that look in the mirror and beholds his face and forget and walk away and forget what kind of a man he isall when you look in the word you see yourself of the wordu you must see yourself Christ all the god God owns all that He Is We own we are is that right we are his offspring according to the book of Acts now you must need to know this because we've got demonic Powers right now conting and uniting to come against bride you better know who you are I'm not talking about your head I'm talking about your heart hallelujah hallelujah and right now you should have a peace in your heart you don't have a peace in your heart you need ask God to give you that hallelujah hallelujah is that right absolutely absolute amen I think we ought to be if there is such a thing as being a fanatic I think as the bride of Christ we ought to get a little more fanatical we're too quiet when I say that you should walk down the street as the bride when you go to the restaurant you carry yourself wherever you are you you got to carry yourself because you're representing Heaven repres Jesus hallelujah hallelujah is that right listen we must understand that all of his promises the of Jesus Christ is yay Hallelujah is that all right don't don't listen I get a little jeal sometimes things I read in the word of things I read in the word I'll explain it when I think about Daniel who didn't have the Holy Ghost like we've got who didn't understand God the way we understand God but Daniel declared decree that he was not going to allow to defile him and did he hold true to it and you must hold you must have that kind of Integrity to know that no matter what squeeze is going to bring no matter kind of they going to come with hallelujah hallelujah if you're going to believe this message you need to believe it with all of your heart hallelujah hallelujah cuz right now you got people who are trying scripturally of what you believe hallelujah hallelujah how are you going to be born a sheep and con convince that sheep he's a dog it's impossible hallelujah hallelujah when I when I think about this I've seen God recently do a lot of healing not but I'll tell you like this I know the devil have Ted to my wife just to see what I'm going to do but I'm still on standing on the word yes yes and however we must fight this battle together her in the way in this way the demons that have attacked her in this way is already defeated oh yeah oh yeah we must understand hallelujah what we're dealing with if we going to see God you must get in the word and stay there you understand me because he is in the word he is the word understand this is why brother brand tells us the opening of the seals will make this book a no a new book read word the message says about it understand what he's talking about if the word reading the word is boring to you it has not become a new book to you we know in this last message I got to hurry we know that Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy and in the word of God in Luke he tells us that before the coming of the Lord that the son of man would appear and when he when he spoke of this Prophet basically saying that this Prophet be just like I am he will do the very same things I did it won't be just a prophet the prophet being revealed through a prophet now brother bam tell speak a message way back then the world is falling apart my question is do you think the world is falling apart Hallelujah have the things he preached come to pass hallelujah hallelujah he defined the Antichrist to us not only just the Antichrist but he defined the Antichrist Spirit would attack the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah can I get a witness he told us about the immorality of women Hallelujah did it come to pass he told us about the changing of the Constitution they haven't stamped it yet they changed it tremendously it's happening right now Hallelujah is that right he told us about the increase of homosexuality is that right he told us about the movement of the political realm he told us not to be worried about romanism excuse me he told us not to be uh uh concerned about China Hallelujah he said China is not the force that's coming after us hallelujah but he said communism and romanism unite together Hallelujah in the form of religion where do you think you are now the next step in order to bring this into order is for another power to rise up I'm saying because as it is now America is finished did he not tell us that it ain't just America whole world you know it's it's it's it's it's America while because she's uh in Revelations 13 and tell me she ain't speaking like a dragon in controlling everything guess what there's nowhere to run there's nowhere to hide Hallelujah the only place to run and in Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's it he's the only Sheltering place is that right he said come to me all ye that are l in heavy later I will give you rest your soul your yoke upon me for my yoke is easy and my burden is light seeing him face to face is seeing his word come to pass hear me you see the prophecy coming to pass the word coming to pass it doesn't mean we're not going to literally see his face word first Spirit first and when you see him in the spirit of the word he one day appear to you hallelujah hallelujah listen what he says in the world is falling upon par 40 said the whole Pentecostal world today is falling apart the whole system of Methodist Baptist and presi the whole religious system is falling apart we see it we know that's the truth our national political world is falling apart the whole thing is at the end as Isaiah said it becomes full of purified Souls it's just the whole body is corrupted why am I saying this I'm not telling you to stop planting your potatoes if you investing invest potatoes plant your pot don't forget about your soul cuz your soul is more important than anything Hallelujah don't be distracted not at this time Hallelujah now I know people say well is going to come on the E no no no man know the day that's another one of those little things that's going on and you know a lot of people are basing their faith on that kind of stuff and and when it doesn't happen you know what it does it it breaks the uh destroy the faith of the people sat knows what he's doing I'm not saying that nothing's happening there something we know that Hallelujah because the word says so and the prophet has told us these things play an important part these things play a important but understand the word also says when he does make a translation it would be like a thief in the night be open show yall understand me but you need to watch these other things that happen yeah you better you know I said like this I I I kind of read this today and I told that even Trump is saying if he gets uh this presidency he's going to he's going to put almost everything back into the hand of the state he doesn't mean in harm like all the other ones are not this because that's the way I believe is going to happen it's going to happen and somebody's got to do it that's we don't trust no man and we must and and this is not to to bad mouth him done but if if that's where he's headed of Jesus Christ that's a wrong direction is that right come on somebody we broke away from church and state you know what church and state mean they will govern your religion if you don't do it the way they want you is that right listen brother Bram said that when this thing become unified people and it's going to deceive the people because it's going to look so good Hallelujah the only people that will not be deceived will be the bride of Christ because she see his face and she understand who he is hallelujah hallelujah hey I'm not waiting on nobody amen truth trth and if he doesn't do it somebody else will you need to be aware of the season that you're living in hallelujah hallelujah there's something has got to happen and it's going to be be Beyond any manmade system or understand that has to bring it back to its right condition again I know this is a nasty picture but it's the truth we've got to look things just EX exactly what they are there's no need of quoting anything over quoting coding it rather but just come out and tell the truth about it wrong is wrong y'all must know that this world is falling apart and we're still you know God still has favor somehow in this America cuz we're still here she should have been the bomb should have dropped long time ago but the bride of Christ is still here that's the way I believe it and I know as long as we keep blessing Israel God can't can't he won't move against listen did not the problem of God say we will turn against Israel hallelujah hallelujah we are making friends with the Muslims right now truth is truth hallelujah hallelujah and we got it coming let me say it like this bride of Jesus Christ this is not the time to be distracted hallelujah hallelujah right and if we see the Nations today this our political and National Life to the core it's all full up of things of Television corruption all kind of dirty filthy jokes show the the the BL and gags the the side BL and before our our young people what about now we must look listen people are looking now a system to deliver them I mean you call it democrat or republican system to deliver all right where the devil want [Music] us no system can deliver this and America cannot be revived has Revival Hallelujah the only Revival there will be the Revival hallelujah hallelujah sir we it ain't going to be a great Nation again finished hallelujah hallelujah it sounds good Hallelujah but I believe J still got a ride it's going happen I believe that but at the end of the day they going to unify the church and the state Rome and her daughters that's the way it goes Hallelujah listen what he says if that isn't the picture of our world today I don't know world it is it's a picture of our world today everything is looking for a system something to hold us together it's a picture of today it was looking for some system or something that would keep us from falling apart as it was then so is it now again repeating again hallelujah hallelujah and you got to be blind not to see what's happening you don't need to worry Hallelujah I'm like a bird in the Cliff of the rock that's I'm like a bird in the Cliffs of a rock let the St Hallelujah you think John didn't see it John typed out the bride what did John scream out so come Lord J I don't know about you home sick you can go everywhere in the world vacationing wherever you want to wherever home is you going to get homesick we on a journey here we've been traveling for many years I said like this it's time to go home Hallelujah yeah you know what what people what people understand who are not ready God has a way of making you ready yes sir when the eagle Stars up her nest you'll take all the Comforts of living from you hallelujah hallelujah let me tell y'all something I don't agree with nothing Hitler did and those Jews would have still been over there in Germany they were if it had not been for Hitler Hallelujah God used those unclean spirits D them back to their homand hallelujah hallelujah and if God used the devil for is that right Prophet God said we're going to have persecution but that at that time that's when we'll see the third P I'm Not Afraid Don't Be Afraid fear not little flock Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah yes Lord this what he says coming from the message world is falling apart he said our political world today our religious world is just exactly like it was in the days of the first coming of the [Music] Messiah it's polluted the whole thing is rotten it could get no worse our religion I don't see how it could get any worse the whole thing is corrupt political world man May systems Hallelujah we want everything just everything so we can take it easy and retire you see the trick he said life life wasn't intended to be easy a strg everything that's got life is a struggling look at the trees how they struggle look at everything that's got life it's a struggle and when we try to get some kind of system that make it easy we know there's something wrong and that's what our country has tried to doall yeah that's what they do make you fat before the slaughter they make you fat before the slaughter to keep your eyes on Jesus Old Rugged Cross Hallelujah the only thing that is Dependable is the word of God hallelujah you love the Lord St John 14 please we'll begin reading at the 26th 27th verse hallelujah hallelujah you know I'm not trying to stop anybody's Vis or dream foret about your soul the Bible said the cares of this life shoke the life out of the people don't care about this don't care for this life more than you care for your soul hallu Hallelujah you understand me St John 14 beginning at the 26th verse but the comforter the Holy Ghost whom the father was sent in my name shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatever I have said unto you he said Peace I live with huh he said Peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world give it unto you not your heart be troubled neither Let It Be Afraid my peace I give to you is that right what did the prophet of God preach he preach Shalom to the peace to the bride Hallelujah no weapon formed against youel cannot Prosper hallelujah hallelujah and when the enemy comes in like a FL God will always lift up a standard second Corinthians please one I don't care what you going through just wait our problem is we don't know how to wait Hallelujah and The Devil Makes Us think God didn't hear us God us God hasn't answered prayer Hallelujah I think it was Daniel right he said them demons he was fighting 21 days but I heard your prayer the first time hallah don't you know you got angels that demons for you angels that are trying to deliver bring to you the promise of the word don't give up on God this is my favorite because God won't give up on you he said for all the promises of God in him are yay and in him amen unto the glory of God by us now he which establishes US with you in Christ and have anointed us is God who have also sealed us and given us the earnest of the spirit in our hearts let me tell you something happened yesterday all I know is that something just covered me with the peace I can't explain it because it's different but I'll tell you this if you seek God and you God sees your heart that you're Earnest he'll give you that peace you got to trust him you got to trust him like I said you know it our biggest problem is waiting I think about brother Bram standing on that corner for hours God told stand what about that lady in Alabama Mississippi Mississippi stood in her yard for hours knew she wasn't out there with an assumption and brother bham didn't walk just because he thought he heard the voice of God he come face to face knew he understood that God had something wrong to do understand where we must F tune our souls and Spirits hallelu it's been a long time since some people have heard the voice of godallah I remember when I was a young Christian Hallelujah I used to hear his voice all the time and people would say the Lord told me to do this or the Lord told me to do that and they would be right on it Hallelujah God didn't separate from us we separated from him we the one that broke the connection and what we need to do is surrender back to God ourselves is me standing in the KNE of pray I can't tell you i' I say it as a testimony not not as a spirit of prosperity but I say every time God told me to bless someone monetarily I didn't even hesitate Hallelujah for the most part maybe there was a few time like Lord but every time I did what he told me to do more came more came from places I thought would didn't never thought about wasn't looking for God has never failed me I don't do it because I know he's going to give I don't even think about that I just do what he tells me to do I'm telling you if you obey God like that you'll be surprised what he do for you hallelujah hallelujah for he listen Hebrew 11 101 talking about Abraham he looked for a city which had foundations whose Builder and maker is God out of all Abraham had he knew that this place on Earth was not his something thater that's what excites me I know it sounds crazy excites me to know that it's almost over Hallelujah excites me and you know brother brandom said it like this God is going to do anything for his people it will never because of be because of their works it will always be because of his grace and he goes on to say every time God ever did anything it has been his grace Hallelujah we don't Merit Heaven there's nothing we could do we can't work into this rap Hallelujah if we grow in if we grow the Bible say do what grow in his grace that's how you grow by his grace by the grace of God hallelujah hallelujah a lot of time you farther up the road than you think that's true some of us we we so judge ourselves so harshly we can't even see the good part of us hallelujah but I thank God because he sees the heart hallelujah hallelujah God ain't worried about this hour share he's looking at the heart that's what Samuel told uh David's dadah he he you know uh they brought all the sons in the goodlooking one the handsome the MUSC on all that the ones look like they were fit for a [Music] battle and God brought Little David in we would we would have never know what David looked like but brother said he look like a little that was the one God chose you understand me blessed is the pure in heart see God it ain't so oh my goodness y'all know that's the truth even in the world now if you good looking you could be dumb as a rock and get a job I seen it before people come in and they all sharp got that face walk in and walk out smiling and you can have your three piece on best suit but if you don't look better than that other person sorry the job just been filled that's the truth it's the truth I seen it done yeah when I was a young boy I was working in the hotel and I just a minute you probably heard this testimony but this Shar de Deon looking man came in little small fell they was applying for the job I was working at that hotel he even told me he said I even went to a medium I want this job so bad while he went over here this this woman come in with the red hair excuse me she was really perfect in in her looks and I thought to myself you can forget it Hallelujah I thought to myself you finished this lady went up up the stairs came down smiling she got the job and he was so sad to myself did you notice your competion that's the way the world does they they go by their eyes they look and they see I never forget that Everet I felt so sorry for him medium couldn't help him oh let's move on by the grace of God hallelujah but anyway he looked for a city whose Builder and maker was God through faith also Sarah herself received strength to rece conceive seed and was deliver child when she was I love the scripture and I'm going be done in just a minute but I love this scripture because we know how Sarah laughed she had a little touch of unbelief Hallelujah where did she get the strength from hallelujah hallelujah is that right you know how she got itel came directly to her Hallelujah he said them you going to have a child Hallelujah and nobody knows when the angel came back to Sarah it was a Sarah Revelation Hallelujah because Sarah was the one who had the baby where was Abraham come on somebody this is what I'm trying to tell you God would give you the strength to produce this Rapture hallelujah hallelujah it is a revelation God gave to Sarah a revelation God gives to you yes that's why the Bible single it out also Sarah Hallelujah you don't worry this is not to wor Hallelujah this is the time to have faith in God faith will make you look stupid you will always make you come out right think about it Jesus was a man but he knew God if he say like this can you imagine if he just had faith in himself but he had faith in the being that you couldn't see understand what I'm saying had to work in both dimensions Both Worlds he had to work in both world and when when he had to turn that water into wine bring me Lord have mercy without a revelation you better not try it but he wasn't on his own he saw by Vision that water being turned into wine so he had is that right he father everything You' shown me I've done it hallelujah hallelujah so he wasn't working on his own Hallelujah Almighty was showing him what to do hallelu hallelujah amen was not William Bram the same vision in order to make sure it was right and God taught him how to did he not do it directly correct every time there was a time he didn't he got a head of the vision with the little boy that was twisted all up he saw God heal him and he went up there and thought he could pronounce the man the boy's healing forgetting the vision but old grandma had to be in a certain place had to be in a certain place everything had to be in a certain place before he could say thus say the Lord hallelujah so is it with us God we know the will of God God will reveal to you exactly Hallelujah Hall is that right I believe that cuz brother B said the bride will know what to do with the word you think he's just talking about the literal word he talking about the word in you Hallelujah she'll know that Galatians 3:16 Lord give everybody peace in their hearts don't let the people get in a frenzy because things are going to pick up we don't know how fast it's going to happen but I'm going to say it like this what has happened to America in this two and a half three years me talking about dropping down to the bottom still falling and only one that's going to be able to prop it up God has to prop it up do y'all realize what's going to happen a rain is going to fall I mean a spiritual rain he said there will come another anointing he when that that that Revival started he said of people joined together will think they're in a Revival and at that time they will be receiving the mark of the beast in other words that anointing will come and make them blossom into what they really are fall on the bride take a RT that's exactly right that was strange that's that was real strange something happen anyway Galatians 3:16 now to Abraham his seed was a promise made he saith not inter seeds as of many as a one that se which is Christ Hallelujah you understand me so when we look at this thing we must understand that the seed of which is Christ the holy spirit that which is in US causes us to be accepted in God I'm almost done and I want you to understand like I told somebody the other day your suffering cannot be compared the suffering of our Lord Jesus Christ and when you think you suffered so much think about what he suffered that helps me and I hope it helps you because there's no way to make heaven without suffering first thing he told us take up your cross and follow you think it's rough now wait till the squeeze come some of your relatives going to betray you that's your Bible they did it in the early church and they going to do it hallelujah hallelujah yeah the scripture calling to Hebrews 610 I'm uh chapter 10 6 Chap and we're going to read 10 and we might not read all of that but I want to read so you understand and because I want to leave you I really want to leave you in this peaceful and um and I thank God for your your pull I really appreciate everybody being here tonight we're living in the and this is what I'm trying to tell you we're living in in in the last days and you got to know how to surrender you got to say Lord not my will but thine be done help me surrender to you Lord because we all know where we're wrong we can EAS make the confessions but surrendering giving it up is another thing am I right on that we take God we need God the the Holy Fire God to burn things away from us hallelujah hallelujah for the scripture says but God is not the not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have showed toward his name in that ye have ministered to the Saints and do Minister and people don't know that they don't know that while you ministering to Saints God Is Right Hallelujah not that you're doing it for that reason you so love the people of God that's why I'm praying that God will bring a unity in this church it cannot be manmade Hallelujah and we desire every one of you to do excuse me 11 birth and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope until the end that ye be not slothful nor followers of them who through faith and patience but follow but followers of them start over let read that ye be not slowful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherited the promises faith will make you wait Faith doesn't doesn't operate by time faith is the revelation God is going to he has shown me see what we fail to see faith is given to you is shown to you it brings an assurance in your soul you quit working you're resting now have said so hallelujah hallelujah and you wait and when God made promises to Abraham because he could not swear by no greater swear by himself saying surely blessings I Will Bless thee multiplying I will multiply the hallu and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise don't you understand waited 25 years he had the son hallelujah hallelujah and God said go sacrifice he didn't know how he was going to do it one thing God what they had a testimony him and Sarah had testimony I once was old but now I'm and if God can change me he could raise the dead I dead and now I'm alive see he knew that God was more than able to perform itl God don't have to work out in the gym he's Almighty that's God and and it'll take Eternity for us to to come to find out how powerful and that's something we'll never comprehend because every time we think he's powerful do something else do something else hallelujah hallelujah we'll spend eternity worshiping him never going to run out yes sir it'll not be like this old boring world you get up in the morning y'all know how it is you got to brush your teeth and get yourself together um same old thing rotate your food so make Tuesday be more exciting than Wednesday I mean but it's the same stuff but there it'll never be boring you understand me we can't even imagine first of all you think I never thought a grape could taste like this y'all know we eatc breakes right if you think the hbri is good you wait till we get the real see we desire better country Hebrews 11:13 says these all died in faith not having received the promises but have seen them a far off and was persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers the Earth they say such things plainly that they seek a country tonight I seek a city whose Builder and maker is God hallelujah I know he's talking about this city because he said we are a city that sits on a hill but I'm waiting see what my glorified look like you love the Lord now I'm going to conclude with a quote I got to go down to the bottom sometime I guess I put too much in here but the grace of God brother Bram in closing listen everybody in this church got to commit themselves to it can't be just a preacher others if we want to see God move we must bring this thing into a Unity we we got to love one another we got take care of one another hallelujah hallelujah listen what brother man say talk about a Rapture now he said coming from the message God himself in 1963 he said we commit ourselves with our offerings of the church morning to you for service Latter Day lights for the evening time lights that we might bring consolation and Faith to the waiting people that's waiting for the coming of the bridegroom to dress a bride in the gospel of Christ for the Lord Jesus to receive this we dedicate myself brother Neville and the congregation to the service of God in the name of Jesus Christ so it's the whole church who's responsible for helping the bride be dressed we have the message but the message can't be worn from the outside on [Music] the Hallelujah listen he said it's a joining time it's a unionizing Time the unions are us uniting uning lab labor fussing about it Nations have the United Nations the churches are are uniting together what is all showing it's showing that Christ and the bride is fixing to unite that's what is speaking of shs and things are showing the positive coming watch now as we close I'm getting too late and we notice now in the great hour we are hope we all hope for was gone of survival they seen somebody come walking on the water now he's taking the setting of Peter them on the water doors are broken and the everything is in the bash sh they see walk on the water and the thing the sad part listen close the only thing that could help them they was afraid of it telling us in these latter days people will be afraid of the Holy Ghost I think that's what's wrong with our church you think if you lose [Applause] control control he said if you ask for a bread do you think I give you a serpent if you ask for the Holy Ghost do you think God will let a demon take care of you take over you when you don't see him who he is brother bam said God want to see you with the Holy Ghost don't be afraid of it this is what we need if that if that hasn't happened again he said they are afraid of it they're afraid of fortun telling um they're afraid of some kind of a devil power when Jesus said it would happen in the day this day the only thing that can help them is Jesus Christ not another denomination not all them joining together that's just going to make it worse than ever the only thing that can help you is Jesus Christ and when he promised to return in the last days form and do this promising just like before the promised son returned to Abraham the first seed the Royal Seed of Abraham Jesus would said would see he said he would see the same thing before the promised son God would manifest himself in the flesh exactly like Jesus did hallelu now who is he talking he's referring to himself God manifested himself through will why because it wasn't brother Jesus Christ he said I am a son of man the son of man hallelujah hallelujah how how is it that Christians can receive praise for prayer can receive praise for prayer when the Christian knows he cannot answer prayer God who answers the prayer if there's somebody that need healing Christian God's favor we're just the vessels of Godel there's nothing we can boast in Hallelujah that's why the prophet could that's why the prophet couldn't boast he knew he wasn't the thing the one who was doing the world Hallelujah it was Jesus Christ let me tell you something you can't halfway believe it you got to believe all it doesn't matter where you don't understand it all and here are all those promises that we could laid them out by dozens right here before you that this is supposed to take place the church which ought to be with arms out to receive it I'm afraid of that it does it it don't belong to our group C and they are scared of it and let me tell you some message churches scar of them have been so intellectually taught they don't want to move of God let me tell you something there is no move of God intellectual you are you can't outdo the Pharisees and Jesus said except your your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of [Music] Pharisees you're going to make it what righteousness superseded the righteous of the it was the righteousness of Jesus Christ he became our sin that we might become his right I'm almost done this is the last I'm not I'm finishing it up and they're scared of it the only thing they can bring them to Christ is Christ himself and they afraid of that scary I don't know that might be spirited you see I don't know about it are scared of only things that I can help them are scared of the of scared of the only things that can help them and in the dark hours of distress listen what he's saying here this is in 1964 send a message I'm telling you he said in the that dark hour of distress those church that God setting out there might be spooky have nothing to do with it that sweet voice not afraid it is I he is the word he never changed to be the word can't you hear the word say
