[0:00] So, praise the Lord. And if you have
[0:02] your Bible, I'd like to uh I'd like to
[0:04] turn and uh
[0:08] we're going to read uh two portions of
[0:09] scripture here this morning to to kind
[0:11] of kick us off. Brother, would you mind
[0:14] if I took my jacket off? Is that all
[0:15] right? All right.
[0:24] Amen.
[0:26] It's tough digging ditches with your
[0:28] jacket on. Amen. So,
[0:30] I get down to work here this morning. We
[0:32] want to read uh in Ephesians chapter 2
[0:35] and then we're also going to read in
[0:36] Daniel chapter 2. And uh I've got a I've
[0:40] got a lot of scriptures here that I'm
[0:41] going to reference this morning. I'm not
[0:43] going to ask you to turn to them all
[0:45] because it just take too long. But but
[0:47] you know if if you're writing them down
[0:49] um you know you can go back and look at
[0:51] them later. I believe believe it'd be a
[0:53] blessing for you. And uh but there will
[0:55] be a few that that we do turn to
[0:57] together.
[0:59] And I see that you don't have a clock in
[1:00] here. I like that. But I'm gonna I
[1:02] brought my own. So
[1:06] we we take the clock down sometimes in
[1:08] our own church just, you know, because
[1:09] we're not creatures of time, right?
[1:12] Although we're still trapped in these
[1:13] bodies of time. Amen. If you if you uh
[1:17] have Ephesians chapter 2, uh I'd like to
[1:21] read uh from the fifth verse to the 10th
[1:25] verse.
[1:26] Scripture says, "Even when we were dead
[1:28] in sins,
[1:30] he hath quickened us together with
[1:32] Christ. By grace you are saved." Amen.
[1:35] Aren't you thankful for God's grace?
[1:36] Amen. Amen. And hath raised us up
[1:40] together and made us sit together in
[1:43] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. That in
[1:46] the ages to come, he might show the
[1:48] exceeding riches of his grace in his
[1:52] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
[1:55] For by grace are you saved through
[1:57] faith, and that not of yourselves. It is
[2:00] the gift of God,
[2:02] not of works, that lest any man should
[2:04] boast. For we are his workmanship,
[2:07] created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
[2:11] which God hath before ordained that we
[2:13] should walk in them. Amen. In Daniel
[2:16] chapter 2,
[2:19] want to read one verse here from Daniel
[2:21] chapter 2 verse 44.
[2:26] Scripture says, "And in the days of
[2:27] these kings shall the God of heaven set
[2:30] up a kingdom which shall never be
[2:33] destroyed. And the kingdom shall not be
[2:35] left to other people, but it shall break
[2:38] in pieces and consume all of these
[2:41] kingdoms, and it shall stand forever."
[2:44] Amen. Amen. Would you bow your heads
[2:47] with me this morning? Our gracious
[2:50] heavenly father, we're so thankful,
[2:52] Lord, for what you've done for us, Lord.
[2:56] Father, this work is your work, Lord.
[2:59] We're just hands, Lord. We're just feet.
[3:02] We're just lips, Lord God, of clay,
[3:06] willing vessels, Lord, that want to be
[3:08] part of your great plan this morning. Oh
[3:11] God, you had some eternal thoughts,
[3:14] Lord. You had an eternal plan, Lord. And
[3:16] I'm so thankful this morning that we are
[3:19] included in those plans, Lord. Lord, not
[3:21] only are we included in them, but Lord,
[3:24] we're the focus of them, Lord. Your
[3:26] children, Lord, your thoughts, your
[3:28] attributes.
[3:30] Father, as I stand before you redeem
[3:32] this morning, I pray, oh God, that you
[3:34] would bless my lips, Lord. Father, that
[3:37] you would come and speak to us this
[3:40] morning. Father, we we have need of
[3:43] thee, oh God. Lord, we're not here to to
[3:46] to hear the ideas of any man, Lord.
[3:50] Father, we're not here to entertain our
[3:53] own uh intellectual thoughts, Lord God,
[3:56] but we want to hear your word, Lord. We
[3:59] want to hear you speak to us, Lord. And
[4:02] Father, we know, Lord, that you have a
[4:05] word for us this morning. Father, we
[4:07] believe that there is a word for this
[4:09] people, Lord, in this place. Lord, I
[4:12] have need of you this morning. I want to
[4:14] hear from you, Lord. Oh, God. Just one
[4:18] touch of you this morning. Father, just
[4:21] one word, Lord, from your lips to my
[4:23] ear, Lord God. Father, that's our desire
[4:26] this morning. Lord, speak to your
[4:29] children. Speak to us, Lord.
[4:32] Father, we'll be careful to give you the
[4:34] glory for it. Father, I pray that you
[4:37] drive away every demon of unbelief from
[4:40] this place this morning.
[4:42] Drive away fear and doubt, Lord God.
[4:46] Father, I pray that you bind the spirits
[4:48] of darkness, Lord God, from operating in
[4:50] this place. Lord Jesus, come Lord, in a
[4:54] mighty way, oh God, this morning,
[4:56] Father, raise the faith of your people.
[4:59] Lord, raise our faith up into the
[5:01] heavenly realms, Lord God. Lord, bring
[5:03] us up to that place, Lord God, where
[5:06] your word, Lord, has total preeminence
[5:08] in our lives.
[5:10] Oh God, we love you and thank you, Lord.
[5:14] We honor you and give you praise this
[5:16] morning in Jesus name. Amen.
[5:20] Amen and amen. You may be seated this
[5:22] morning.
[5:26] Amen.
[5:29] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[5:36] The humidity is different on my voice.
[5:38] Amen.
[5:41] We're used to that dry climate out there
[5:42] in Arizona, but I like it. I love the
[5:46] green. Amen. And I was telling brother
[5:48] Isaiah, I love the rain. I love the
[5:50] natural rain, and I love the spiritual
[5:52] rain. Amen. Amen. This morning I want to
[5:55] speak to you uh about a subject and I if
[5:59] I would give it a title it would be the
[6:01] children of the kingdom. Amen. The
[6:03] children of the kingdom. We believe to
[6:06] this morning that that if we're born
[6:08] again of the spirit of God we are the
[6:10] children of the kingdom of God. Amen.
[6:13] And we see here in the the scripture
[6:15] here in Daniel where it's speaking of
[6:18] these gentile kings. Amen. Daniel has
[6:21] seen a vision or or not Daniel but
[6:24] Daniel has interpreted a vision. Amen.
[6:27] Of the the gentile kings of the world
[6:30] and and their their glory and their
[6:32] splendor. And the Bible says that the
[6:36] word of the Lord comes to Daniel and it
[6:38] says in the days of these kings, these
[6:41] gentile kings.
[6:43] In those very days, God is going to
[6:46] establish a kingdom. Amen. He's going to
[6:50] set up a kingdom that will never be
[6:52] destroyed.
[6:53] Though you marvel at this great uh
[6:56] gentile kingdom, these great kings and
[6:58] their opulence and their power and their
[7:00] might,
[7:02] God is going to set up his own kingdom.
[7:05] Amen. And he's given us some attributes
[7:08] of this kingdom. It will it will not be
[7:10] left to other people. Amen. It will it
[7:12] will it will never rot or or p pass away
[7:15] or fade out.
[7:17] and it will break in pieces and consume
[7:20] the other kingdom. Amen.
[7:24] And it shall stand forever. I like that.
[7:27] Amen. And then in Ephesians chapter 2,
[7:29] we read uh I I want to to particularly
[7:33] point you to that verse there where he
[7:36] says that he hath raised us up together
[7:39] in that sixth verse. Amen. He has raised
[7:42] us up together to and made us to sit in
[7:46] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Amen.
[7:50] And that's what we want to speak about
[7:52] this morning. Heavenly places
[7:55] in Christ Jesus. Amen. So God has
[7:59] established and he's determined to
[8:02] establish a kingdom during the time of
[8:04] the Gentiles. And this kingdom is very
[8:08] different from the natural kingdom.
[8:10] Amen. You know, the these natural kings,
[8:12] they they they've taken their kingdoms
[8:15] by force. They've waged wars. Uh they've
[8:18] they've they've bu built huge building
[8:21] projects. Amen. They they've built
[8:23] monuments and and huge natural uh
[8:27] things, politics, uh assassinations.
[8:30] Uh they've they developed technology and
[8:33] everything in the natural to build up
[8:36] their kingdom here on earth. And this is
[8:39] their focus and this is what they they
[8:41] they want a kingdom that they can
[8:43] establish and then they would hand it
[8:46] off to their children and their
[8:48] children's children and they would be
[8:49] proud of their achievements. Is that
[8:51] right?
[8:53] But God says that there is a different
[8:56] type of kingdom that he's looking for.
[8:59] That's right. And the problem is brother
[9:00] sister that you know uh people today are
[9:04] looking to the natural kingdom. Amen.
[9:07] Amen. They're they're looking to
[9:09] medicine or they're looking to uh
[9:11] technology for all their solutions.
[9:15] Now, there's nothing wrong with using
[9:17] medicine or technology for your
[9:19] solutions. Amen. But when that's your
[9:21] ultimate, when that's your absolute
[9:24] Amen. Satan in in this day, Brother
[9:26] Brandham said that this is Satan's Eden.
[9:29] Is that right? He's trying to establish
[9:31] his own kingdom. And it's based on
[9:34] intellectualism.
[9:35] It's based on man's works and man's
[9:38] reason. It's based on uh attempts of
[9:42] science and things and things in the
[9:44] natural. Amen.
[9:47] But God says, "I'm going to establish a
[9:49] different kind of kingdom."
[9:52] It's the type of kingdom that that
[9:54] doesn't corrupt.
[9:56] Amen. You don't need a Botox injection
[9:59] to stay young in this kingdom. Amen.
[10:03] because there's a fountain of life.
[10:05] Hallelujah. Amen. Is that right? You
[10:08] don't you don't need the the technology
[10:10] and and the things or to to uh to to
[10:14] make the kingdom last.
[10:17] So, this is the type of kingdom that God
[10:20] was going to begin to usher in when John
[10:23] the Baptist appeared on the scene.
[10:25] Right? The Bible says that uh John the
[10:29] Baptist came preaching from the
[10:31] wilderness and his message was repent
[10:36] for the kingdom of heaven is at hands.
[10:39] Amen. Amen. He said I'm for running the
[10:43] ushering in of a kingdom. Amen. And then
[10:47] uh the Bible says in Mark chapter 1 14
[10:50] and 15. We won't turn to it, but it says
[10:53] that Jesus came into Galilee preaching
[10:56] the gospel of the kingdom of God. Amen.
[11:01] And saying this was his message saying
[11:05] the time is fulfilled.
[11:09] Amen. Amen. It's here. This prophecy in
[11:13] Daniel was speaking about it. A time of
[11:15] the Gentiles when when the kingdom of
[11:18] God would begin to be ushered in. Amen.
[11:20] Hallelujah. He said, "The time is
[11:22] fulfilled
[11:24] and the kingdom of God is at hand."
[11:27] Amen. Repent and believe this gospel.
[11:31] Amen. Because you see, brother, sister,
[11:34] we once dwelt in a position
[11:38] of power on the earth. Adam and Eve.
[11:43] Amen. On the earth, we dwelt in a
[11:46] position that God had placed man in.
[11:50] man that was made in his own image. Yes,
[11:52] sir. But God had placed him in a natural
[11:55] kingdom, the earth, and he said, "You
[11:57] should subdue the earth. Take
[11:59] preeminence on the earth." He gave this
[12:02] earth to man. Amen. To be the the minor
[12:05] god of the earth. Is that right?
[12:09] And Adam didn't do that by the sweat of
[12:11] his breath. Amen. Amen. He didn't build
[12:14] tractors to till the land. Right. He
[12:16] didn't have technology. He didn't he
[12:19] didn't develop uh uh vaccines to combat
[12:24] disease. No sir, right? He didn't use
[12:27] technology to do what God had told him
[12:30] to do. Amen. No. If a tree if he wanted
[12:33] to move a tree, he spoke to it.
[12:36] Amen. Amen. So, brother, sister, he he
[12:40] reigned on the earth from a faith realm.
[12:46] Amen.
[12:48] Amen. And that's what we want to speak
[12:50] to you about this morning. He reigned
[12:52] from a faith realm. He reigned from the
[12:57] kingdom of heaven and he reigned on
[13:00] earth. Amen. Amen. So, Adam, though he
[13:05] was in the flesh,
[13:07] yet he he was a dual being, spirit and
[13:11] flesh, just like we are, but he he dwelt
[13:15] in that realm of faith. And that's where
[13:17] he operated from. And everything that
[13:20] happened here on the earth happened
[13:22] because of what Adam spoke by faith.
[13:25] Amen. Amen.
[13:27] So, and we know that through the fall,
[13:30] we lost that position in heavenly
[13:33] places. Amen. We see here in Ephesians
[13:37] where it tells us that we've been
[13:38] restored to that position in heavenly
[13:40] places. We've been lifted up into
[13:43] heavenly places through Christ Jesus.
[13:46] Amen. So, we know that the reverse of
[13:49] that was we were fallen from heavenly
[13:51] places through Adam's fall. Amen. Amen.
[13:55] Are we just just bear with me? We want
[13:56] to we want to push through some of this
[13:58] here this morning. Amen.
[14:01] So, Adam had lost that position in the
[14:05] that heavenly place, that place where he
[14:08] could speak and it absolutely happened.
[14:10] Amen. Amen.
[14:14] And now Jesus comes on the scene
[14:18] and he's saying the time is fulfilled.
[14:23] God's children have been held out of
[14:26] this heavenly realm long enough.
[14:29] Amen. Amen. Man has been shut out from
[14:32] the tree of life long enough.
[14:35] Now the time is fulfilled. Amen. Repent.
[14:40] Turn back from your ways. Say amen.
[14:42] Amen. He says, "Repent and believe this
[14:45] gospel." Amen. For the kingdom of God is
[14:48] at hand. Amen. So Jesus when he began
[14:53] his ministry, he began to do the work of
[14:56] the father to prove that this kingdom
[15:00] was being ushered in. Amen. He was
[15:04] providing access
[15:07] back into that
[15:10] place, that that heavenly realm. Amen.
[15:14] And it was time for the people to rise
[15:17] up and to enter into this place that
[15:20] they had been previously shut out of
[15:23] where once a cherubam had been set with
[15:26] a flaming sword to keep man away from
[15:29] the tree of life, lest he eat of it in
[15:33] his fallen condition.
[15:35] Now through the blood of Jesus Christ,
[15:38] the cherubim with a flaming sword is
[15:41] driving man back as fast as he can go.
[15:45] Through the Messiah, we gain access
[15:47] again
[15:49] to what we had lost in the beginning.
[15:52] Amen. Amen. What a change, brother,
[15:54] sister. Amen. This is a change in
[15:56] dispensation. This is God moving on the
[15:59] scene. Amen.
[16:02] The kingdom had come back to man. Oh my.
[16:07] Amen.
[16:11] In Matthew 11, the Bible says, "From the
[16:13] days of John the Baptist until now, the
[16:16] kingdom of heaven suffereth violence."
[16:19] And the violent take it by force.
[16:23] For all the prophets and the law
[16:24] prophesied until John. And if you will
[16:26] receive it, this is a lie which was for
[16:28] to come. He that hath the ears to hear,
[16:30] let him hear.
[16:32] Why the kingdom of heaven suffer
[16:34] violence? Because the kingdom of heaven
[16:38] wasn't ruled by its rightful owner.
[16:41] Amen. The prince of the power of the air
[16:44] has taken man's place.
[16:47] Amen. So, it's not bad enough that Adam
[16:50] fell from his position in the garden.
[16:54] his position in that faith realm where
[16:58] he could speak and nature would obey.
[17:01] But it but Satan has squatted in his
[17:04] place.
[17:06] Amen. Amen. And the Bible says that that
[17:08] that Satan is the prince of the power of
[17:10] the air. Is that right? Well, that's our
[17:14] position.
[17:16] Adam is supposed to be the prince of the
[17:18] power of the air. Amen. Man is supposed
[17:21] to have that position. Amen. man is
[17:23] supposed to be the one that speaks to
[17:25] the storm. Amen. You know, and brother
[17:28] Brandham dramatizes it when they're on
[17:30] the when they're on the sea. Amen. And
[17:32] he says, "The prince of the power of the
[17:34] air comes and he pulls up and he and he
[17:37] stirs up a storm to try and sink the
[17:40] boat." Right. Well, brother, sister,
[17:42] that was man's position to control the
[17:45] weather. Amen. Amen. Amen. That was
[17:48] Adam's original call in his place was to
[17:52] be able to be that the power the prince
[17:55] of the power of the air. Amen. The one
[17:57] to speak to storms. Amen. So what
[18:00] happened was Jesus looks out and he sees
[18:03] Satan using a a usurped authority of man
[18:08] to stir up the storm against the the
[18:10] people of God. Amen. Jesus looks at it
[18:13] and he was sent to undo all this. Amen.
[18:16] Amen. And he looks up and he says,
[18:17] "Peace be still."
[18:20] Amen. And the winds and the waves obeyed
[18:22] him. Why? Because he was reasserting the
[18:26] authority. Amen. He was taking back that
[18:29] position. Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[18:32] Hallelujah.
[18:35] Amen.
[18:37] The Bible says in Matthew chapter 12,
[18:40] Jesus said, "If Satan cast out Satan, he
[18:43] is divided against himself. and how
[18:46] shall his kingdom stand? Amen. But he
[18:49] says, "If I by be elabub cast out
[18:51] devils, by whom do your children cast
[18:54] them out?" Therefore, they shall be your
[18:58] judges. But listen to this. He says,
[19:00] "But if I cast out devils by the spirit
[19:04] of God,
[19:06] where's he casting them out from?"
[19:09] Amen. He's casting them out where
[19:12] they're squatting on your position.
[19:14] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. We're not
[19:18] supposed to be sick. When there's a
[19:20] demon of sickness afflicting you, he's
[19:23] sitting there in your land. Amen. Amen.
[19:27] And he has to be cast out of there. He
[19:30] doesn't belong there. Amen. That's
[19:32] yours.
[19:34] Amen. He says, "But if I cast out devils
[19:37] by the spirit of God," he says, "then
[19:41] the kingdom of God is come unto you."
[19:45] Amen. He said, "This is the proof." This
[19:49] is the proof of what I'm talking about.
[19:52] Amen. Because, brother, sister, our type
[19:54] is Joshua. Amen. Going into the promised
[19:57] land. Amen. That land was theirs. It was
[20:00] given to them by God. God said, "This is
[20:03] your land. I've given it to you. But
[20:05] there are inhabitants in that land.
[20:07] There are squatters there. There are
[20:09] giants there. Amen. There are enemies of
[20:12] God there. It's not theirs. It doesn't
[20:15] belong to them. Amen. It's yours. But
[20:18] they're there. Amen. Amen. So Jesus
[20:22] says, "I come to cast out those devils."
[20:26] Amen. Because they don't belong there.
[20:28] I'm preaching an entrance into the
[20:30] kingdom of God for you. and Joshua, they
[20:33] had to go and they had to cast them out.
[20:36] Amen. They had to drive them out of
[20:37] their lands.
[20:40] Evidence that the kingdom is being
[20:41] restored.
[20:43] Jesus said in John 3:3, he said, "Verily
[20:47] I say unto thee, except you be born
[20:49] again, you cannot see this kingdom."
[20:54] Amen.
[20:56] Jesus preached about the kingdom and the
[20:59] people wanted to know, "What is this
[21:00] kingdom? Where is it that you're talking
[21:02] about? You're talking about restoring
[21:04] this. What? What? Show it to me. You
[21:06] know, let me see it. Amen. And he said,
[21:09] "You can't see it." Unless you're born
[21:12] again. Amen.
[21:15] You can't perceive it. In other words,
[21:18] you can't know that it's there. Amen.
[21:22] Others, uh, there'll be there could be
[21:25] two, you know, side by side. One could
[21:29] be living in heavenly places. One could
[21:32] be exalted into the kingdom of God and
[21:35] the other wouldn't have no idea that it
[21:37] was that was even the case. Amen. Why?
[21:40] They can't even perceive it until
[21:43] they're born again. Hallelujah. Amen.
[21:47] You can receive blessings from the
[21:50] kingdom. You can partake of the loaves
[21:52] and the fishes. In other words, amen.
[21:54] You can receive blessings, but you
[21:57] cannot have the right and the position
[22:01] and the blessing that comes with that
[22:03] position to be a citizen of the kingdom.
[22:07] Amen. Until you're born again. Amen.
[22:12] You won't have access to your uh your
[22:16] personal spring of living water.
[22:20] Amen. Without that you you will live
[22:22] from revival to revival.
[22:25] Amen. You you you'll go from from
[22:28] meeting to meeting or whatever. Amen.
[22:31] But brother, sister, there is a living
[22:33] water. Amen. Amen. There there there's a
[22:36] wellspring
[22:38] of the Holy Ghost. Amen. That can water
[22:40] you and feed you. Amen. And brother,
[22:43] sister, without that you you you can't
[22:46] know the kingdom of God.
[22:49] Remember
[22:51] that original prophecy in Daniel. This
[22:53] is a kingdom that will stand forever
[22:56] and will consume all other kingdoms.
[23:00] Amen. So this is a special class of
[23:03] citizen
[23:05] that's part of this kingdom. Amen. We're
[23:07] not just talking about being a citizen
[23:09] of the United States, right? This is a
[23:12] special kingdom. Just just as there are
[23:15] benefits to being a a citizen of our
[23:18] country or or of another country. Amen.
[23:21] There are benefits to being a citizen of
[23:24] this kingdom. Amen.
[23:27] But it's a special class, brother,
[23:29] sister. The Bible says that they are
[23:31] overcomers.
[23:33] Amen. They are not overcome by evil, but
[23:36] they overcome it. Amen.
[23:40] They're elected.
[23:43] They didn't call themselves to this, but
[23:45] they were called. Amen.
[23:48] Jesus said they must be perfect.
[23:51] Amen. We'll get into that more later,
[23:54] Lord willing. But brothers and sister,
[23:57] that perfection doesn't flow from their
[23:59] own works or their own goodness. Amen.
[24:03] But it flows from the newness of life
[24:06] through the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[24:10] So uh Jesus
[24:12] gave Peter the keys to this kingdom.
[24:15] Amen. Jesus came and through his
[24:19] sacrifice he ushered in or he made a way
[24:23] for us to gain entrance back to that
[24:26] position. Right? But he didn't open the
[24:28] door. He just made a way and then he
[24:31] gave Peter the keys. Amen. Is that
[24:34] right?
[24:36] When when Peter who was able to receive
[24:39] revelation of who Christ was, he gave
[24:42] Peter those keys and he said, "You
[24:45] whoever you know, whatever sins you
[24:47] remit, they'll be remitted." Right?
[24:49] Those famous words. And we know what
[24:52] Peter did with those keys. Amen. On the
[24:55] day of Pentecost,
[24:57] after the blood had been shed,
[25:01] the life that was in the blood came back
[25:04] on the believer in the upper room. Amen.
[25:08] It It's not a It's not a natural blood,
[25:11] brother, sister, that saves us. Amen.
[25:14] Like in Egypt, they put a natural blood
[25:16] over the doorposts. But today, it's not
[25:19] a natural blood. If you had a vial of
[25:21] the natural blood of Jesus, it wouldn't
[25:23] do anything for you. might it'd be nice,
[25:25] right? But it's the life that was in the
[25:28] blood. Amen. That life had to come back
[25:32] down on the believer. And that's what
[25:34] happened at the day of Pentecost. Peter
[25:36] stood up with the keys, gave those
[25:38] notable words. They said, "Men and
[25:39] brethren, what must we do to be saved?"
[25:41] And he said, "You must repent, be
[25:43] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[25:45] the remission of your sins, and you
[25:47] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[25:49] Ghost." Amen. This is the entrance into
[25:51] the kingdom.
[25:53] Amen. Jesus said, "You can't even know
[25:55] the kingdom's there until that happens."
[25:58] Amen.
[26:00] So, this is how the kingdom is being
[26:02] established and how the prophecy of
[26:05] Daniel is being fulfilled. Amen.
[26:09] We are born into this natural earthly
[26:11] kingdom and we must be born into the
[26:15] spiritual kingdom.
[26:17] There's no other way. Amen. So many
[26:20] people, brothers and sister, they try
[26:21] and get around that. Even now, when
[26:24] we've come so far and we've had so much
[26:27] word and so much truth given us, even
[26:30] now people are trying to say, "No, it
[26:33] comes another way." You know, even since
[26:36] uh the the the prophet came and brought
[26:39] the message to us and they say, "Well,
[26:41] now since the seal's open, it comes a
[26:43] different way."
[26:45] It's not written. Amen.
[26:47] It's the same new birth that must get
[26:50] you into the kingdom. Amen.
[26:54] Amen.
[26:56] Matthew 16:19, Jesus said, "I will give
[26:58] unto thee the keys of the kingdom of
[27:01] heaven.
[27:02] Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[27:04] shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever
[27:05] thou shalt loose on earth shall be
[27:07] loosed in heaven." Amen. I'm going to
[27:09] read you a quote. Hope that's all right.
[27:11] From from Christ is the mystery of God
[27:13] revealed.
[27:14] Brother Abraham says now Peter when he
[27:18] called said thou art the Christ the son
[27:20] of the living God. Now watch blessed art
[27:23] thou Simon Barjonah. He says which means
[27:26] son of Jonah. See for blessed are thou
[27:28] thou for flesh and blood never revealed
[27:30] this to you. You never learned it from
[27:32] some school but my father which is in
[27:35] heaven he's revealed it to you. Notice
[27:38] what he said unto him unto this upon
[27:41] this rock.
[27:43] Peter, that's Peter, the predestinated
[27:45] seed of God, had received this light and
[27:50] been given the keys to the kingdom. And
[27:53] upon this rock of revelation of who
[27:56] Jesus Christ is, he's the full
[28:00] manifested God. Amen.
[28:04] Upon this rock, not a father, son, and
[28:07] holy ghost. Amen. And him being the
[28:11] second person, not that. But upon this
[28:14] rock, I'll build my church, and the
[28:17] gates of hell will never shake it down.
[28:19] Amen.
[28:21] Never prevail against it. Amen. That's
[28:23] the prophecy. Amen. That it would crush
[28:26] the other kingdoms. Amen. That it would
[28:28] never be torn down. He said, "See, I'll
[28:32] build my church upon this rock, a
[28:34] revelation of Jesus Christ."
[28:37] Look, Christ in you,
[28:40] not Christ of history.
[28:43] Amen. Not not Christ in a book. Amen.
[28:47] Not not a Christ of your father or your
[28:49] mother. Amen. Or your grandma. Amen.
[28:53] Hallelujah. But Christ in you.
[28:57] Amen. It's got to be personal this
[28:59] morning.
[29:01] Christ in you makes him the center of
[29:05] life of the revelation.
[29:08] People claim, "Oh, we've got this
[29:10] revelation and that revelation." They're
[29:12] talking about a mental understanding. It
[29:15] means they've been taught a doctrine and
[29:18] they understand it with their mind.
[29:22] That's not revelation.
[29:24] Christ is revelation. Amen. the life of
[29:27] Christ. Hallelujah. Quickening his word.
[29:30] That's revelation.
[29:32] Making it live. He is the word. Amen.
[29:36] Look, Christ's life in you makes him the
[29:41] center of the revelation.
[29:44] Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the
[29:46] complete revelation of Christ. Christ in
[29:49] you makes you the complete revelation of
[29:52] the whole thing.
[30:01] You see, in another place, Brother
[30:02] Brandham says, "If you can't see Christ
[30:05] throughout the whole Bible, you need to
[30:08] go back and read it, right? Because he's
[30:11] there from Genesis to Revelation. You
[30:14] should be able to find Christ in every
[30:16] part of the Bible." Amen.
[30:19] And that's step one. Because if you can
[30:21] find the bridegroom
[30:25] in every place in the Bible, you should
[30:28] be able to find a bride right there with
[30:30] him. Amen. Because she's a part of him.
[30:35] Amen.
[30:38] He says, "What is the new birth?" Then
[30:39] you say, "Brother Brandon, what is the
[30:41] new birth?" It's the revelation of Jesus
[30:43] Christ personally to you.
[30:47] Amen. See, not you joined a church or
[30:50] shook a hand or done something
[30:52] different. You said a creed or you
[30:53] promised to live by a code of rules. But
[30:56] Christ, the Bible, he is the word that
[30:58] was revealed to you. And no matter what
[31:00] anybody says or what takes place, it's
[31:03] Christ.
[31:05] Pastor, priest, whatever it might be,
[31:07] it's Christ in you. And that is the
[31:09] revelation that the church was built
[31:11] upon.
[31:13] Amen. That's what's establishing this
[31:16] kingdom. Amen. the revelation of Christ.
[31:19] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. So this
[31:26] life,
[31:27] this Christ that's come down and birthed
[31:31] you into the kingdom, that's the token.
[31:34] Amen. That's the token life. And that's
[31:37] your citizenship card.
[31:40] Amen. If somebody wants to know, are you
[31:42] a citizen of of a country or or you know
[31:46] of a of an earthly kingdom, you you're
[31:49] given a citizenship card or some proof
[31:51] of your citizenship. Is that right?
[31:53] You're given something that you can show
[31:55] and say, "Yeah, I'm an American citizen.
[31:57] Here's my passport. I'm coming into your
[31:59] country." Or something like that. Is
[32:01] that right? But brother, sister, God
[32:03] gave us the Holy Ghost as the token of
[32:07] our citizenship.
[32:09] Amen. It's proof, brothers and sister,
[32:12] that we live in heavenly places.
[32:15] Amen. It gives you access to the
[32:18] benefits of the kingdom of God.
[32:20] Though it's not seen with the natural
[32:22] eye, yet it's there.
[32:26] Brother, sister, there are no half
[32:27] citizens
[32:29] in this case. You know, a lot of
[32:31] countries, they allow dual citizenship,
[32:33] right? You can be a part of this country
[32:35] and you can be a part of that country
[32:37] too and you can have the benefits of
[32:38] living over here and you can have the
[32:40] benefits of living over there. Whatever
[32:41] the case may be
[32:44] but we are called to be soul citizens.
[32:49] Amen. The problem is we are too dual
[32:52] citizen-minded.
[32:54] We try to live by this earthly realm but
[32:58] we're in the world but we're not
[33:00] supposed to be of the world. Is that
[33:02] right?
[33:04] Amen.
[33:08] Because you see, these citizens are
[33:09] bound by laws.
[33:12] This natural kingdom is bound by laws.
[33:14] Right? Now, it's a fallen king. It's
[33:16] bound by laws of sin and death. Right?
[33:19] You You know that in your You know that
[33:22] when you get up in the morning. Amen. I
[33:25] know that more and more every day,
[33:27] Brother Brooks. Amen. I get up in the
[33:29] morning and I know that death works in
[33:31] these members. Amen. Amen. Because this
[33:34] natural world is bound by the law of sin
[33:37] and death. It's bound by time. It's
[33:41] limited by physical senses and our
[33:44] natural experience. We're limited by
[33:46] what we can feel. We're limited by what
[33:49] we see and hear and taste. Amen. Amen.
[33:52] We're limited by our natural logic and
[33:55] our natural understanding.
[34:00] Oh, but brother, sister,
[34:02] Amen. There's a kingdom that has a
[34:04] higher sense.
[34:06] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. When the the the
[34:08] the the natural senses fail. Amen. Amen.
[34:12] And you're bowed down under the law of
[34:14] sin and death. Then you can reach into
[34:17] another realm.
[34:19] Amen. And by faith sense, you can say,
[34:22] "The word of God has said that I'm
[34:25] healed." Amen. Amen. And you take that
[34:27] word and by that faith, Amen. You bring
[34:31] that word and make it manifest in this
[34:34] realm. Oh, hallelujah.
[34:37] Amen.
[34:39] One kingdom has sickness, one kingdom
[34:41] has healing. Amen. Amen. One kingdom has
[34:45] death, the other kingdom has eternal
[34:47] life. One has nervousness and fear and
[34:52] worry, and one has peace and joy and
[34:57] love.
[34:58] Amen.
[35:00] We've been blessed with all spiritual
[35:02] blessings in this kingdom. The Bible
[35:06] says all spiritual blessings. Amen.
[35:11] Amen.
[35:14] But we have to renounce our citizenship
[35:16] of this earthly kingdom.
[35:19] Amen. to walk in that heavenly one. We
[35:21] must constantly press into that a as our
[35:26] old flesh man still desires to live in
[35:28] this realm. Amen.
[35:32] The kingdom of heaven is a higher order.
[35:35] It's a higher order kingdom. Amen. You
[35:38] know, so many of the bright minds of our
[35:41] day and great, you know, scientists and
[35:43] great thinkers, they make fun of someone
[35:48] who lives by faith. Amen. They they say,
[35:51] "Oh, you know, evolution is true, and
[35:53] you know, we want to we want to prove
[35:55] everything through a scientific method,
[35:57] and you know, we we're we want to see it
[36:00] and feel it and taste it and understand
[36:02] it."
[36:03] But you see, brother, sister, they they
[36:05] they're they're at a lower rung.
[36:09] Amen. They can only come so far with
[36:11] that. And they look at someone with
[36:14] faith and they say, "Oh, you're a nut.
[36:15] You're crazy." Right? Am I the only one?
[36:19] Okay. All right. Amen. Amen. Don't go to
[36:23] sleep on me now. Amen.
[36:26] Because they say you're crazy. You You
[36:29] can't see it. You can't reason it. Say,
[36:32] but faith is a higher sense.
[36:36] Amen. They can't even they can
[36:38] understand it. But it is a higher order
[36:42] sense than our natural senses. Is that
[36:45] right? So we begin to live in heavenly
[36:49] places by faith and only by living in
[36:54] that realm can we then begin to resume
[36:58] rulership over this realm. Amen.
[37:02] Amen.
[37:04] How are you going to make your body come
[37:07] in line with the word of God? It's got
[37:10] to be by faith. Amen. Amen. You have to
[37:13] rule from that realm. Amen. You can't
[37:16] rule from the realm of your symptoms.
[37:20] Amen. You have to rule over your body
[37:23] from a faith realm.
[37:26] Back doing what Adam did in the
[37:28] beginning. Amen.
[37:32] You see, brothers and sister, we have
[37:33] been called to be kings and priests to
[37:36] God.
[37:37] Amen. We have been called to be rulers
[37:41] of this natural kingdom.
[37:44] Now, we realize, and you know, I'm not I
[37:48] want to make sure that we're square on
[37:50] the word with this. We realize that that
[37:53] not everything's going to come under
[37:54] subjection. Amen. Until that time when
[37:57] Christ comes back, right? and and
[37:59] everything comes under subjection to the
[38:01] king, right? But we can rule this piece
[38:06] of earth.
[38:08] Amen. This is where it starts.
[38:11] God is not asking you to rule over this
[38:14] nation right now. He's asking you to
[38:17] rule over this piece of ground.
[38:21] Amen. Amen.
[38:24] So we can affect change in this natural
[38:26] realm by asserting our position in
[38:28] heavenly places.
[38:31] Stepping back into that position
[38:34] that man forfeited
[38:36] in the Garden of Eden. Amen.
[38:39] Amen. Ephesians 1:3 tells us, "Blessed
[38:42] be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
[38:44] Christ, who has blessed us with all
[38:48] spiritual blessings,
[38:51] but only if you're in heavenly places in
[38:55] Christ Jesus." Amen. All spiritual
[38:58] blessings flow from there.
[39:02] Amen. Let me just uh read to you, can
[39:05] this quote here? Modern events made
[39:07] clear by prophecy. Brother says, "The
[39:09] real ordained of God, that real gene, a
[39:13] soul of God that was in God before the
[39:16] foundation of the world." He's talking
[39:17] about your soul. Amen. Remember you
[39:22] that's really got the spirit of God in
[39:23] you tonight. You were in Christ.
[39:28] You were in You were here in Christ
[39:31] because he was the fullness of the word.
[39:35] Amen. Amen.
[39:38] Don't miss that. Now,
[39:41] you were, if you are a part of the word,
[39:44] you were in Christ because he was all
[39:45] the work. Amen. Amen. If you're an
[39:49] attribute of God, if you are a thought
[39:50] of God, that's part of the word, a
[39:52] portion, your portion. But he was all of
[39:55] it. Amen. Amen. So, you are one of those
[39:58] in him. Amen.
[40:01] He was the fullness of the Godhead
[40:03] bodily. God was in Christ reconciling
[40:06] the world to himself. Do you believe
[40:08] that? Look, he was in Christ. Then if
[40:12] you were in God, a gene, a word, an
[40:14] attribute from the beginning, then you
[40:16] walked with him here on earth. You
[40:19] talked with him on earth. You suffered
[40:21] with him on earth. You died with him at
[40:23] Calvary. And you rose with him again.
[40:25] And now you're seated in heavenly places
[40:27] in Christ Jesus. Communing with him.
[40:30] Amen. the word as it feeds into your
[40:34] soul.
[40:35] Amen. He's in heavenly places. You're
[40:39] communing with him. Amen. He's gone into
[40:42] that place where you couldn't go because
[40:44] of your sin. Amen. And he's taken back
[40:47] that position for us. Hallelujah.
[40:51] Man shall live by every word that
[40:54] proceedth out of the mouth of God. Amen.
[40:56] Amen. And this is also from God of this
[40:58] evil age. He says in God's own thinking
[41:01] the great spirit in the beginning before
[41:04] there was a beginning he was God and did
[41:06] you know you were in him then if you are
[41:07] a Christian now you was in him then
[41:10] and then if that so be then the whole
[41:13] godhead bodily shaped up in the person
[41:15] of Jesus Christ when Jesus died at the
[41:18] cross I was with him for I was in him
[41:21] then for he was the fullness of the word
[41:23] manifested knowing that we would be
[41:25] manifested later and we was at Calvary
[41:28] with him we We went to the grave with
[41:29] him as we raised with him in his
[41:31] resurrection. And now we've ascended by
[41:34] his spirit to the throne of grace,
[41:38] sitting together in heavenly places in
[41:42] Christ Jesus. You say, "I don't
[41:43] understand this. How could we be in him?
[41:46] You know, I wasn't even born yet." Well,
[41:48] Eve was in Adam.
[41:51] Amen. She was a part of Adam. You
[41:54] couldn't see her, right? She didn't have
[41:56] a body. She wasn't walking around, but
[41:58] she was a part of Adam.
[42:00] Amen. And we were a part of Christ. We
[42:03] were attributes. Amen.
[42:06] Amen. Luke 17:20 and 21 says, "When
[42:10] Jesus demanded of the Pharisees or I'm
[42:13] sorry, when he was demanded of the
[42:15] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
[42:18] come,
[42:20] when is this kingdom going to come? Are
[42:22] you the Messiah or aren't you?" Amen.
[42:26] See, they were thinking natural. They
[42:28] were thinking that he was going to come
[42:30] as some great general and and defeat the
[42:32] Roman army. Amen. And and take over and
[42:35] establish a natural kingdom. So they
[42:38] said, "Hey, when's this kingdom of God
[42:40] coming?"
[42:42] And listen what he says. He answered
[42:44] them and said, "The kingdom of God
[42:47] cometh not with observation.
[42:51] You can't see it.
[42:54] You might not even feel it.
[42:56] He says verse 21, "Neither shall they
[42:59] say low here or low there,
[43:03] for behold, the kingdom of God is within
[43:06] you." Amen. The kingdom of God is within
[43:09] you.
[43:11] Amen.
[43:13] I could say it like this, brother. It's
[43:15] not a public show.
[43:18] Amen. It's it's it's a secret that
[43:21] happens to the believer.
[43:25] Amen. You say, "Oh, show me your soul.
[43:28] Show me your born again soul." You can't
[43:30] do it. Amen. Show me that gene
[43:33] attribute. Show me the token Holy Spirit
[43:36] on your life. Well, I can't show it to
[43:38] you. I can't even see it myself. Amen. I
[43:42] can't through my natural senses even
[43:44] prove to myself that I've been born
[43:46] again, but I know I have.
[43:50] I know I have. Amen. Now, yeah, I can
[43:53] see the the the results of it. Sure.
[43:56] Amen. But I can't see that token, Amen.
[44:00] But I know what happened. I know what
[44:03] God did for me. Amen. And I know that
[44:05] I'm living in a faith realm this
[44:07] morning. Amen. And when the devil comes
[44:10] to tempt me, I just point him to the
[44:12] token.
[44:16] Amen. You don't need to argue with him.
[44:19] Amen. You don't need to fight and fuss.
[44:22] All you need to do is show him the
[44:23] token.
[44:25] Amen. Hallelujah. There are rights that
[44:28] comes with being part of this kingdom.
[44:31] There are rights that come with being a
[44:32] citizen of the United States. Amen. And
[44:35] all all you have to do is show proof of
[44:38] your citizenship often and that's enough
[44:40] to get you in or through or whatever.
[44:44] Amen. All you got to do is show your
[44:46] token.
[44:48] But brother, sister, it's not a public
[44:50] show,
[44:55] but we are the revelation of the
[44:57] kingdom.
[45:01] So we are the proof. Amen.
[45:05] We are the proof of his existence.
[45:08] You when Jesus came and they said,
[45:10] "Well, you know what's this kingdom that
[45:11] you're preaching? Show us or show us
[45:13] that." And he says it's not with
[45:14] observation. But he did say, "If I do
[45:18] the works of my father, Amen. If I don't
[45:21] do the works of God, then you don't have
[45:22] to believe me. But if I do them, then
[45:24] listen." Amen. And and this is the proof
[45:26] that what I'm preaching is the truth.
[45:30] Amen. So he was the proof and
[45:33] vindication of the restoration of the
[45:36] kingdom of heaven. And brother, sister,
[45:38] that means that today in 2014,
[45:43] you are the proof. Amen.
[45:46] Amen. You are the vindication.
[45:49] Amen. Nobody's going to know about the
[45:52] kingdom unless you prove it and
[45:54] vindicate it.
[45:57] Amen.
[45:59] It cannot be seen or understood with a
[46:01] human mind. But it has to be perceived
[46:03] by faith
[46:05] and it must be a personal revelation to
[46:07] each member of the body.
[46:10] Amen.
[46:12] Oh sister, our position in Christ is
[46:15] actually partaking, listen to this, of
[46:19] his position where he has seated down on
[46:23] his throne. Amen. It's a throne of
[46:26] mercy.
[46:28] But by by him partaking and moving into
[46:32] that position, we are with him. Amen.
[46:34] That's what the prophet was telling us.
[46:37] We were with him at Calvary. We were
[46:38] with we were in him when he walked on
[46:40] this earth. And now we've ascended by
[46:42] his spirit to the throne of grace,
[46:44] sitting together in heavenly places.
[46:46] Amen.
[46:48] Amen.
[46:54] Amen. Luke 8 verse 9 and 10. His
[46:58] disciples asked him saying, "What might
[47:01] this parable be?"
[47:04] And this was true of many of his
[47:06] parables. They they could not understand
[47:09] it. Amen. But he said,
[47:14] "Unto you it's given to know." Amen. The
[47:18] mysteries.
[47:19] Look at what he says. Unto you it's
[47:21] given to know the mysteries of the
[47:24] kingdom of God.
[47:27] Amen. But to others in parables that
[47:30] they that seeing they might not see and
[47:32] hearing they might not understand. But
[47:34] unto you it's given. It's given to know
[47:37] the mysteries of the kingdom of God.
[47:43] Amen. Ephesians chapter 1, put it in
[47:47] high gear here.
[47:52] Ephesians chapter 1 verse 19 says, "What
[47:56] is the exceeding greatness of his power
[47:58] to usward who believe according to the
[48:01] working of his mighty power which he
[48:04] wrought in Christ when he raised him
[48:06] from the dead and set him at his own
[48:07] right hand in heavenly places." Right?
[48:10] He set it at his own right hand in
[48:12] heavenly places.
[48:14] far, not not just above, but far above
[48:18] any princip principality and power and
[48:21] might and dominion and every name that
[48:24] is named, not only in this world, but
[48:27] the world that is to come.
[48:30] And hath put all things,
[48:34] all things. Amen. Everybody say, all
[48:37] things. All things. Amen. Under his
[48:42] feet.
[48:45] He's put all things under his feet. Let
[48:48] me ask you a question this morning. Who
[48:51] are his feet? Amen.
[48:55] Amen.
[48:57] Not what are his feet, who are his feet?
[49:03] Amen.
[49:04] Brother, sister, if you are in this body
[49:06] of Christ, it doesn't matter if you're
[49:09] the bottom of his feet
[49:11] of the body.
[49:13] You're still above all things, every
[49:16] principality, every power, every demon
[49:19] in hell.
[49:21] Amen.
[49:23] He's put all things under his feet, and
[49:26] gave him to be the head over all things
[49:30] to the church, which is his body, the
[49:34] fullness of him that fleth all in all.
[49:37] Amen. Amen.
[49:40] Amen.
[49:43] Ephesians chapter 3:9 it says to make
[49:46] all men see what is the fellowship of
[49:48] the mystery which from the beginning of
[49:51] the world hath been hidden God who
[49:53] created all things by Jesus Christ to
[49:56] the intent now
[49:59] unto the principalities and powers in
[50:01] heavenly places.
[50:04] So these are principalities and powers
[50:07] that are sitting in your position
[50:09] squatting in your position. Amen.
[50:13] That they might be known by the church
[50:16] the manifold wisdom of God
[50:20] according to the eternal purpose which
[50:21] he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[50:24] Amen. He's going to show the devil what
[50:29] he's accomplished at Calvary. Amen. And
[50:32] he's going to do it through you. Amen.
[50:34] And me. Amen. Amen. You are the
[50:37] instruments that God is using in this
[50:40] hour to do battle against the enemy.
[50:42] Amen.
[50:45] Amen. Real quickly, I just want to get
[50:47] through a few of these verses here. Uh
[50:49] Matthew 10:24, the disciple is not above
[50:52] his master, nor the servant above his
[50:54] lord. It is enough for the disciple that
[50:57] he be as his master, and the servant as
[51:00] his lord. If they have called the master
[51:02] of the house Beelzebub, how much more
[51:04] shall they call them of his household?
[51:08] But fear them not, therefore, for there
[51:10] is nothing covered that shall not be
[51:12] revealed, and hid that shall not be
[51:14] known. For what I tell you in darkness,
[51:17] that speak you in light, that what you
[51:20] hear in the ear, preach ye upon the
[51:24] housetops. So you see brother, sister,
[51:27] our role, our job is to take what God is
[51:32] doing for us in that secret realm.
[51:36] Amen. The life that he imparts unto us,
[51:39] the the the the power through the Holy
[51:43] Spirit that happens, it's just between
[51:45] you and him.
[51:46] Amen. It's a personal thing. It It's
[51:50] different for every person and and it's
[51:53] personal to you. But you're supposed to
[51:56] take that and you're supposed to
[51:58] manifest it on the earth. You're
[52:00] supposed to take that and let it shine.
[52:03] Amen. Amen. That power, that fire that's
[52:06] lit down in your soul that that can't be
[52:09] perceived by those must be then
[52:11] manifested in your life. Amen. Amen.
[52:15] Amen. Amen. He says, "That which I
[52:18] speak, what I tell you in darkness, that
[52:20] speak out in the light. What you hear
[52:23] whispered to you in the ear, go preach
[52:25] that on the housetop." Amen. You're
[52:29] supposed to manifest this word. Amen.
[52:32] Amen.
[52:34] Amen. Amen. Real quickly now, God's
[52:36] provided place of worship. Now, notice
[52:38] when this great moving power of God
[52:40] comes into a son of God, it quickens
[52:43] him. The spirit of life enters into him
[52:48] and then what does it do? It seats them
[52:50] in heavenly places right now.
[52:54] Not they will be. We are now.
[52:59] Now we've already been resurrected.
[53:02] Amen. The resurrection power has come.
[53:06] The dynamics and the mechanics has gone
[53:08] to work. Quakened us. and were quickened
[53:11] up into the presence of God where his
[53:13] spirit is. And now we are seated
[53:16] together in heavenly places in Christ
[53:18] Jesus,
[53:20] setting in there that great seat that's
[53:23] already fired up.
[53:27] Oh my.
[53:30] Then raised from the dead. We're a part
[53:33] of it. Amen. Amen. You're not a
[53:36] spectator this morning. You shouldn't
[53:38] feel like a spectator. Amen. Amen.
[53:41] You're a part of this. Amen. If you're a
[53:44] part of the bride, you are. Amen.
[53:46] Because the bride is part of the groom,
[53:48] you know. So, we find out that it's the
[53:51] same thing. And listen to this. He says
[53:54] she'll do exactly what's predicted for
[53:57] her to do in this day. Amen. She won't
[54:01] be a Leodysa. Not by no means a
[54:04] lukewarm. She'll be on fire for God.
[54:07] Hallelujah. She'll be moving on in the
[54:09] spirit of God.
[54:12] Now, we're looking here now to find out
[54:15] now at the same time that it does that
[54:17] this strikes us when once we're dead in
[54:20] sin and trespasses, we've been quickened
[54:22] together unto his word in this age.
[54:26] Amen. So, right now, we are spiritual
[54:29] kings and priests as subjects of the
[54:32] spiritual kingdom of heaven. Amen.
[54:35] We don't yet reign with him on earth in
[54:37] a corporate way, right? But we are uh
[54:42] that will be the final result. Amen.
[54:45] That is what this life is leading us to.
[54:48] Amen. And uh as children of the kingdom,
[54:53] we are also priests and we are offering
[54:56] intercessory prayer and sacrifice
[55:00] of worship to the king and prayer and
[55:02] interceding on behalf of others. Amen.
[55:05] We reign in a kingdom life which is why
[55:09] we cannot love the world or the things
[55:11] of the world because we live in a higher
[55:13] order. Amen.
[55:17] This is why we plan our lives around
[55:19] church. Amen. Amen. I don't know about
[55:22] you, but man, when I take a vacation, I
[55:24] like to go to meetings. I like to plan
[55:27] around church. Amen. Because I'm a
[55:30] member of that kingdom.
[55:33] This is why we seek God before we plan
[55:36] anything. This is why we are led of the
[55:38] spirit. This is why we subject ourselves
[55:41] to the word of God. Amen. This is why we
[55:44] live a life that's worthy of the gospel.
[55:47] We don't live a life that way to be
[55:50] saved. We live a life that way because
[55:53] we're members of that kingdom. Amen.
[55:58] Amen. Our our kingdom is based on the
[56:00] word.
[56:05] Amen.
[56:09] Revelation 1:6 tells us that he hath
[56:11] made us kings and priests unto God. To
[56:14] him be glory and dominion forever and
[56:16] ever. Amen. Revelation of Jesus Christ,
[56:19] brother Ram says, "He hath made us." Oh,
[56:21] there are certain truths we need to
[56:23] emphasize and this is one of them. That
[56:25] he hath made us. Salvation is his doing.
[56:29] Amen. Salvation is of the Lord.
[56:33] It's all of grace. He redeemed us for a
[56:36] purpose.
[56:38] He bought us for a purpose. We are
[56:41] kings. Spiritual kings.
[56:43] Oh, we are going to be kings on the
[56:45] earth with him when he sits on his
[56:46] throne. But now we are spiritual kings
[56:49] and we reign over a spiritual kingdom.
[56:52] Amen.
[56:55] Amen.
[56:56] Colossians 1:12 tells us, "Giving thanks
[56:59] unto the Father, which hath made us meat
[57:01] to be partakers of the inheritance of
[57:04] the saints of light,
[57:07] who hath delivered us from the power of
[57:09] darkness, and hath translated us into
[57:12] the kingdom of his dear son." Amen. Past
[57:17] tense, hath translated us into the
[57:20] kingdom of his dear son. Amen.
[57:24] This is also out of the revelation of
[57:25] Jesus Christ. He says, "Right now, we
[57:28] reign with Christ right now, having
[57:32] dominion over sin, the world, and flesh,
[57:34] and the devil,
[57:37] showing forth his praise and glory." So,
[57:39] if you want to know what you have
[57:40] dominion over, he just gave you a list
[57:42] right there. Amen. You're supposed to
[57:45] rule over those things, not by be
[57:47] overcome by them. Sin. Amen. Sin does
[57:50] not reign in your life any longer. Amen.
[57:54] It was defeated and you should reign
[57:56] over it. By the word of God,
[58:00] sin, the world. Amen. We overcome the
[58:04] world. Amen. The flesh, your flesh,
[58:09] and the devil. Amen. Showing forth his
[58:14] praise and glory. Showing forth himself.
[58:18] For it is Christ in us, willing and
[58:21] doing of his good pleasure. Yes indeed,
[58:23] even now we are seated in heavenly
[58:25] places in Christ Jesus.
[58:28] Amen. So,
[58:33] how are we gaining entrance into this
[58:35] kingdom? Jesus showed up just with the
[58:38] remaining few minutes that we have this
[58:40] morning. Jesus showed up and began
[58:42] immediately casting out demons,
[58:46] removing them from squatting on the
[58:49] territory of the sons of God.
[58:52] Amen. Kicking them out of the place
[58:56] where they don't belong.
[58:59] Amen.
[59:02] Brother, sister, if you are trying to
[59:04] obtain a promise of God.
[59:07] Anytime you go, you say, I I see that
[59:10] that's mine. I want to take a hold of
[59:12] it. I want to walk into that. That's the
[59:15] vision that the word of God has said of
[59:17] me, and I'm going to walk into it. Amen.
[59:19] It doesn't matter what it is. It's
[59:20] healing. Amen. If it's uh salvation for
[59:23] a family member, whatever, whatever it
[59:25] is you're believing for, Amen. just just
[59:28] more of him in your life. Whatever.
[59:31] Anytime you go to claim a piece of that
[59:35] promised land,
[59:36] you're going to find a demon
[59:39] sitting right there.
[59:42] Right there squatting on that piece of
[59:44] property.
[59:45] Amen. He's going to be sitting there
[59:47] saying, "Nope. Uh-uh. You can't have it.
[59:51] This is mine. I've been I've been here
[59:53] for 20 years. Don't you know that?"
[59:56] Amen. whatever it is, however long
[59:58] that's afflicted you, I've been here for
[1:00:00] x number of years. This is mine now. You
[1:00:02] can't have it. Amen. That's what they'll
[1:00:06] tell you. But brother, sister, you've
[1:00:08] got to kick him out of there.
[1:00:11] Amen. That's not his place.
[1:00:17] I don't care how long he's been there.
[1:00:19] He's got to move when the word of God is
[1:00:22] spoken by faith. Amen. on a believer's
[1:00:26] lips. When the word is received into a
[1:00:29] believer's heart, amen, and they are
[1:00:31] lifted up into that faith realm, they
[1:00:33] speak the word of God. Amen. Amen. When
[1:00:36] the word of God comes off a believer's
[1:00:37] lips, it's God speaking.
[1:00:41] Amen.
[1:00:43] Has to be.
[1:00:45] Amen. Brother Brandham said in one place
[1:00:48] he said that that bride, she'll get to a
[1:00:50] place where she will speak the word of
[1:00:52] God. Amen. Or she'll keep quiet.
[1:00:55] Amen.
[1:00:57] So that those demons Amen. You've got
[1:01:00] to, you know, so many times we get
[1:01:03] discouraged because we are we are, you
[1:01:06] know, trying to obtain a promise or
[1:01:09] something and then when there is a devil
[1:01:10] there, you know, fighting back and
[1:01:12] pushing back and they don't leave
[1:01:14] immediately and, you know, it's, oh,
[1:01:16] there's something wrong with me, there's
[1:01:17] something wrong with my faith, you know,
[1:01:19] or right, you get discouraged.
[1:01:22] Amen. Brother, sister, that's not the
[1:01:24] time to be discouraged.
[1:01:27] That's the time to look back at the
[1:01:29] token.
[1:01:32] Amen. Brother Brandham said that Samson,
[1:01:36] as long as Samson could reach back and
[1:01:39] feel that hair
[1:01:41] as a symbol that he was a Nazerite.
[1:01:44] Amen. As long as he could reach back and
[1:01:46] feel that, he knew that the spirit of
[1:01:49] God was with him. Amen. Amen. And as
[1:01:52] long, brother, sister, if you've
[1:01:53] received that token life,
[1:01:56] God made a promise to you.
[1:01:59] Amen. He won't go back on that promise.
[1:02:02] Amen. He He gave you that token as a
[1:02:05] promise of his love and what he's done
[1:02:08] for you.
[1:02:10] Sealing you into the kingdom of God.
[1:02:13] Amen. So, all you have to do is is show
[1:02:15] him that token. Show him your
[1:02:18] citizenship card. He's got to move.
[1:02:21] Amen.
[1:02:24] Amen. John chapter 18.
[1:02:27] Pilate and Jesus.
[1:02:31] Pilate answered and he said, "Am I a
[1:02:32] Jew? Thine own nation and the chief
[1:02:34] priests have delivered thee unto me.
[1:02:36] What hast thou done?" Jesus answered and
[1:02:39] said, "My kingdom is not of this world."
[1:02:43] If my kingdom were of this world, then
[1:02:45] would my servants fight that I should
[1:02:48] not be delivered to the Jews. But now is
[1:02:51] my kingdom not from his. See, he came to
[1:02:54] fight, but he came to fight a spiritual
[1:02:57] battle. Amen. He came to take over
[1:03:01] another kingdom.
[1:03:04] Amen. And uh Luke 10:1 17, the 70
[1:03:08] returned again with joy, saying, Lord,
[1:03:09] even the devils are subject unto us
[1:03:11] through thy name. And he said unto them,
[1:03:13] I beheld Satan as lightning falling from
[1:03:16] heaven. You see, they were casting out
[1:03:18] demons and he saw Satan falling from
[1:03:22] heavenly places.
[1:03:25] Amen. He saw demons being thrown out of
[1:03:30] man's position
[1:03:33] in heavenly places. Amen. I beheld Satan
[1:03:37] as lightning falling from heaven.
[1:03:40] Behold, I give you power to tread on
[1:03:42] serpents and scorpions and over all the
[1:03:45] power of the enemy. Those are demons.
[1:03:48] Amen. And nothing shall by any means
[1:03:51] hurt you. Notwithstanding in this,
[1:03:54] rejoice not that the spirits are subject
[1:03:56] to you, but rejoice rather because your
[1:03:59] names are written in heaven.
[1:04:03] Amen.
[1:04:04] Rejoice because that's your place. Amen.
[1:04:08] Rejoice in that. Amen. Amen. Revelation
[1:04:12] 12 tells us that there was war in
[1:04:14] heaven. Michael and his angels fought
[1:04:16] against the dragon. And the Bible says
[1:04:19] the dragon prevailed not.
[1:04:22] And listen in verse eight, he says,
[1:04:24] "Neither was their place found anymore
[1:04:27] in heaven.
[1:04:30] The great dragon was cast out. that old
[1:04:33] serpent called the devil and Satan which
[1:04:35] deceiveth the whole world. He was cast
[1:04:38] out into the earth and his angels were
[1:04:40] cast out with him. And I heard a loud
[1:04:44] voice saying in heaven now is come
[1:04:47] salvation and strength and the kingdom
[1:04:50] of our God and the power of his Christ.
[1:04:54] For the accuser of the brethren is cast
[1:04:57] down,
[1:04:59] which accused them before our God day
[1:05:03] and night.
[1:05:05] Amen. I just want to drill into this
[1:05:07] just with the little remaining time we
[1:05:08] have. Is that all right this morning?
[1:05:10] Amen. So the accuser of the brethren,
[1:05:15] he is accusing you before the throne of
[1:05:18] God. Amen.
[1:05:21] He's saying, "Oh yeah, look at what he
[1:05:23] did today. Oh, look at what he did
[1:05:25] yesterday. Look at what I tricked. I
[1:05:28] mean, I didn't trick. I mean, he did it,
[1:05:31] right? He's accusing you before God."
[1:05:35] But brother, sister, this this scripture
[1:05:37] here in Revelation is speaking of the
[1:05:40] time when the accuser is going to be
[1:05:42] cast down. Hallelujah. Why does he have
[1:05:45] access to stand there before the throne
[1:05:49] of God and accuse you? Why does he Why
[1:05:52] can he do that? He can do that because
[1:05:54] Adam forfeited that position. Amen.
[1:05:58] That's man's place.
[1:06:00] But because Adam sinned, now Satan can
[1:06:03] stand there in his place in heavenly
[1:06:06] places and accuse you before the father.
[1:06:10] Amen.
[1:06:12] But it says, "Now is come salvation and
[1:06:15] strength and the kingdom of our God and
[1:06:18] the power of his Christ."
[1:06:21] Amen.
[1:06:24] The accuser of our brethren is cast
[1:06:26] down, which accused them before our God
[1:06:28] day and night. And they verse 11. And
[1:06:31] they overcame him by the blood of the
[1:06:34] lamb and by the word of their testimony.
[1:06:38] and they loved not their lives unto the
[1:06:41] death.
[1:06:43] Therefore rejoice ye heavens,
[1:06:48] and you that dwell in them. Why rejoice?
[1:06:51] Because Satan has been cast out of that
[1:06:53] place, and man is back in that position
[1:06:56] of power again. But he says, "Woe to the
[1:07:00] inhabitants of the earth and of the sea,
[1:07:02] for the devil has come down unto you,
[1:07:05] having great wrath, because he knoweth
[1:07:07] he hath but a short time." So this is
[1:07:09] going to be in the future, right? The
[1:07:12] fullness of it is when he's cast down.
[1:07:15] Amen. But brother, sister, who's doing
[1:07:18] the casting down? Hallelujah. Amen. It
[1:07:21] says they overcame by the blood of the
[1:07:23] lamb and the word of their testimony.
[1:07:25] It's Christ in his body.
[1:07:28] moving into that position again.
[1:07:30] Casting. We're going up. He's going
[1:07:32] down. Amen.
[1:07:36] Now Jesus said in Matthew chapter 5, he
[1:07:39] said, "I say unto you that except your
[1:07:43] righteousness exceed the righteousness
[1:07:45] of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall
[1:07:47] in no case enter into the kingdom of
[1:07:49] heaven." So we must have his perfect
[1:07:54] righteousness to be able to enter in.
[1:07:56] Why? Because the devil will have
[1:07:59] something to accuse you of otherwise.
[1:08:01] Amen. But if you've been cleansed by the
[1:08:04] blood and filled with the Holy Ghost,
[1:08:07] there's no case against you.
[1:08:10] Nothing.
[1:08:13] The accuser has no case.
[1:08:16] Nothing to say.
[1:08:20] Amen.
[1:08:23] Hebrews chapter 9 verse uh 24. Christ is
[1:08:26] not entered into the holy places made
[1:08:28] with hands which are figures of the
[1:08:29] true, but into heaven itself now to
[1:08:33] appear in the presence of God for us.
[1:08:37] Not that he should offer himself often
[1:08:39] as the high priest enter the holy place
[1:08:41] every year with blood, but he's entered
[1:08:44] in once. Amen. And now he's in heavenly
[1:08:47] places making intercession for us. So
[1:08:50] Satan is there, the accuser. Our
[1:08:52] advocate Christ is there. Amen. And
[1:08:55] every accusation that comes, he blocks
[1:08:58] it with the blood. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:09:02] Until, brother, sister, all of it is
[1:09:05] over. Everything has been accomplished.
[1:09:08] And then that accuser is kicked out and
[1:09:12] man comes back into his full possession
[1:09:15] place again. Amen.
[1:09:19] Amen. We need to skip a few pages here.
[1:09:22] Amen. Praise the Lord. I wanted to read
[1:09:25] to you this quote out of the fourth seal
[1:09:26] though. Brother Brandham says, "Now we
[1:09:29] find out here this Satan after being
[1:09:32] kicked out of heaven, he will incarnate
[1:09:35] himself in the beast
[1:09:37] and now he is a the antichrist false
[1:09:40] prophet and the beast and given the name
[1:09:42] of death and hell follows him fully
[1:09:45] Satan on his throne on the earth. He's
[1:09:49] Satan's representative on the earth that
[1:09:51] he is now the head of the kingdoms of
[1:09:54] the world. The very same kingdoms he
[1:09:57] offered to the Lord Jesus in Matthew 4,
[1:09:59] Satan now becomes a full king. Why can
[1:10:02] he do that? Because we've left. Amen.
[1:10:05] Hallelujah. Amen. The Holy Spirit has
[1:10:08] left. The Holy Spirit in the bride
[1:10:13] has now moved into where he was in
[1:10:15] heaven. Amen. kicked him down and now
[1:10:18] he's on the earth and he's mad as a
[1:10:21] hornet. Amen. And all and what he's got
[1:10:24] is this kingdom of earth with no Holy
[1:10:26] Spirit here to limit him and he goes
[1:10:29] crazy.
[1:10:30] Oh, but brother, sister, where are we
[1:10:33] when that happens?
[1:10:36] Amen.
[1:10:39] He says, "Now notice, he will be given a
[1:10:41] heart of a beast at that time, and Satan
[1:10:43] will incarnate himself because when the
[1:10:46] church goes up, Satan's cast out."
[1:10:50] Hallelujah. Oh my. Hallelujah.
[1:10:54] See, it's done then. All of his accusing
[1:10:56] is done. Now, as long as the intercessor
[1:11:00] is still on the throne, Satan can stand
[1:11:03] there and accuse because he's the
[1:11:05] attorney on the other side. He's the
[1:11:07] opponent of Christ. And he's standing
[1:11:10] there and the opponent is saying, "But
[1:11:11] wait, Adam fell. Adam done this. I
[1:11:13] conquered him. I got his wife to believe
[1:11:16] a lie. And you said she'd be damned by
[1:11:18] it. I got it. But here's the mediator
[1:11:20] standing there." Amen. The kinsman
[1:11:23] redeemer.
[1:11:25] Standing there with the blood that can
[1:11:27] take the vilest sinner's heart and
[1:11:29] cleanse it. A mediator on the throne.
[1:11:32] Yes, sir. Satan said, "But they're
[1:11:34] guilty." Jesus says, "But they're not."
[1:11:39] Amen.
[1:11:42] He says, "The blood of Jesus Christ, uh,
[1:11:45] he says Clorox was invented or
[1:11:47] manufactured to take stain and it takes
[1:11:49] the coloring out of the ink or the other
[1:11:51] stain and it'll break it up till you'll
[1:11:52] never find it again. It goes back to
[1:11:54] gases all the way to back to cosmic
[1:11:55] light or past molecules and everything
[1:11:57] else till it turns back to the original
[1:11:59] where it came from." He says, "But
[1:12:02] that's what the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:12:04] does to the true child of God when he
[1:12:07] confesses his sin and stands there
[1:12:09] justified,
[1:12:10] mercy, goodness, even till it's so great
[1:12:13] till God says, "I can't remember it
[1:12:15] anymore."
[1:12:18] And he's absolutely my son.
[1:12:21] Verily I say unto you, if you say to
[1:12:23] this mountain, "Be moved," and don't
[1:12:24] doubt in your heart, but believe what
[1:12:25] you said, it shall come to pass. Amen.
[1:12:28] You can have what you said. You are a
[1:12:31] redeemed son. You see what he's talking
[1:12:34] about? He's talking about you in Christ
[1:12:39] in heavenly places reasserting the
[1:12:42] position that Adam lost that Satan's now
[1:12:45] sitting in. But when you get back into
[1:12:48] that position, then you speak to the
[1:12:50] mountain.
[1:12:51] Then you speak to the storm. You speak
[1:12:54] to the condition. You speak to the
[1:12:57] circumstance. You speak to the problem.
[1:13:01] Even now, we are seated in heavenly
[1:13:04] places. Amen.
[1:13:07] So, brother, sister, there's nothing
[1:13:09] hindering us right now from taking hold
[1:13:12] of the benefits of the kingdom. Nothing.
[1:13:16] Amen.
[1:13:18] Now, he's going to be completely cast
[1:13:20] down when the when the body is complete.
[1:13:24] When the body of Christ is complete and
[1:13:26] moves into that place, we cast him down.
[1:13:29] Brother Adam Bham said, "We go up, he
[1:13:31] comes down." Amen. But you have to
[1:13:34] overcome by the blood of the lamb and
[1:13:37] the word of your testimony. You've got
[1:13:40] to take possession of the land one
[1:13:43] footstep at a time. Amen. Amen. Just as
[1:13:46] Joshua was told in the land, one
[1:13:49] footstep at a time. Each footstep is
[1:13:52] possession. Amen. One demon at a time.
[1:13:56] When Jesus came and preached on earth,
[1:13:58] he drove them out one at a time. Amen.
[1:14:02] And he showed that the kingdom of God
[1:14:04] was back. Amen. That it was back
[1:14:06] restoring, being restored again to the
[1:14:09] hands of man. He was making an entrance
[1:14:12] to it. Oh, brother, sister, let us drink
[1:14:15] of the water of life freely this
[1:14:17] morning. Amen. Amen. Let us let's
[1:14:20] worship God. Amen. and thank him for
[1:14:23] what he's done for us.
[1:14:26] And you know, brother, sister, when when
[1:14:28] the the uh uh apostles after they had
[1:14:31] received their baptism of fire, they
[1:14:35] proved what had happened. They proved
[1:14:38] that they were living in that heavenly
[1:14:40] realm. Amen. They walked up to the gate
[1:14:42] called beautiful and and the men there
[1:14:45] said, you know, asked of them in alms
[1:14:47] and they said, "Look, I don't have
[1:14:49] silver or gold because that's of this
[1:14:52] natural kingdom, but I've got
[1:14:54] something."
[1:14:56] Amen.
[1:14:57] And what I what I have, I freely give.
[1:15:01] Amen. In the name of Jesus Christ, stand
[1:15:03] up and walk. Amen. And the power of God
[1:15:07] came down. Amen. and anointed those
[1:15:10] words because they were spoken by faith.
[1:15:14] Amen.
[1:15:16] Hallelujah.
[1:15:18] Brother, sister, there's power this
[1:15:20] morning to make that word live in your
[1:15:23] life. Amen. You don't have to be
[1:15:26] satisfied with a lukewarm halfway
[1:15:30] Christian life. There is a power Amen.
[1:15:33] in this hour that can make God come to
[1:15:37] life. Amen. can make bring your soul to
[1:15:40] life, can bring bring the spirit of God.
[1:15:43] Amen. And live out through you.
[1:15:46] Amen. Let's stand this morning. Stand
[1:15:50] and bow our heads with me.
[1:15:56] Amen.
[1:15:58] Father, we're so grateful this morning,
[1:16:01] oh God, for what you've done for us,
[1:16:03] Lord. Father, we stand this morning,
[1:16:07] Lord, and we are identifying ourselves
[1:16:10] as your redeemed, Lord. We're
[1:16:13] identifying ourselves, Lord, as your
[1:16:16] children.
[1:16:18] And Father, we're not speaking that out
[1:16:21] of turn. We're not presuming, Father,
[1:16:24] because we have your token life.
[1:16:28] And if there are those that haven't
[1:16:30] received that this morning, you need
[1:16:32] that. receive it and and seek after it
[1:16:36] with all your heart this morning because
[1:16:39] oh God we know Lord that that enemy has
[1:16:44] to move when he sees your life.
[1:16:47] Father I pray that you move on the
[1:16:48] hearts of your people this morning.
[1:16:51] Father, that if there's any here, Lord,
[1:16:53] within the sound of my voice that have
[1:16:55] not received this token life, Father,
[1:16:58] that they would run quickly to the
[1:17:00] throne of grace, Lord, and receive it,
[1:17:04] receive the seal of the Holy Ghost on
[1:17:06] their life.
[1:17:08] And Father, I pray for those who have
[1:17:11] received that seal, Lord. Father, maybe
[1:17:14] there are some here this morning that
[1:17:15] have grown weary and welloing, Lord.
[1:17:18] Father, they've they've they've seen a a
[1:17:21] demon squatting on their land, Lord.
[1:17:24] They they've they've tried to to take a
[1:17:27] hold of a promise, but they've gotten
[1:17:28] discouraged, Lord. Father, I pray that
[1:17:31] you would encourage them this morning.
[1:17:34] Remind them, Lord, that they are your
[1:17:37] child,
[1:17:38] Lord, that this the the works of the
[1:17:41] enemy, Lord, are under their feet this
[1:17:44] morning, Father. that they were put here
[1:17:47] to take dominion over the works of
[1:17:49] darkness.
[1:17:51] Father, I pray that your Holy Spirit now
[1:17:53] would come, Father, and anoint this
[1:17:56] word, oh God. Father, that it would come
[1:17:59] down and just pour a rain out on the
[1:18:02] seed that's gone forth this morning,
[1:18:05] Father, as we water your word with
[1:18:07] worship, Lord. And we just invite your
[1:18:10] presence, Lord, to come into this
[1:18:12] building, Lord, and have your perfect
[1:18:14] way. Have your way, Lord God, in every
[1:18:17] heart this morning, Lord. Touch those
[1:18:20] that need a healing touch this morning.
[1:18:23] Father, ch healing is children's bread,
[1:18:26] Lord. Father, we accept it and receive
[1:18:29] it in Jesus' name. Father, I pray that
[1:18:33] you would bless my brother Brooks, Lord
[1:18:36] God, and his family, Lord, this they
[1:18:38] labor here, Lord God, in this this
[1:18:41] little assembly, Father, those that
[1:18:44] help, Father, everyone of this body,
[1:18:47] Lord, everyone has a a part to play and
[1:18:49] a work to do. Father, I pray that you
[1:18:52] would bless them, Lord, and anoint them,
[1:18:54] Father, for your purpose in this hour.
[1:18:57] Lord Jesus, I pray that you would reveal
[1:19:01] to us our position in Christ Jesus this
[1:19:05] morning. Reveal to us, Lord, what you've
[1:19:08] done for us. Reveal to us, Lord, what
[1:19:11] you've purchased for us. May we accept
[1:19:14] it and receive it for whatever we have
[1:19:17] need of this morning. We ask it in Jesus
[1:19:20] name. Amen. And amen. Amen.
