[47:54] for the time has come that judgment must

[48:11] and if the righteous scarcely be saved
[48:15] where shall the ungodly and the sinner
[48:17] appear
[48:19] wherefore let them that suffer according

[48:55] bless us now in jesus christ's name we
[48:58] pray amen
[48:59] you may be seated
[49:04] as we have been talking uh studying and
[49:07] and really trying to minister the word
[49:10] of god
[49:11] we have had to deal with the fact of the
[49:14] coming of the lord
[49:17] and the reason why it is so important to
[49:19] know
[49:20] what is happening is because most of us
[49:24] have had our own
[49:25] uh revelation of the coming of the lord
[49:28] but most of our revelation most of us
[49:31] perhaps
[49:32] have seen different uh uh movies in the
[49:36] past
[49:36] and thoughts of uh
[49:39] theologians and fundamentalists amen who
[49:43] have
[49:44] described the coming of the lord
[49:45] according to their own minds
[49:48] now remember there even in the time of
[49:50] jesus coming
[49:53] they some thought he was coming on a
[49:55] white horse
[49:57] some thought he was going to come in
[49:58] such a fashion that the whole world
[50:01] would know
[50:03] his coming but remember he came in such
[50:07] a low estate riding on a donkey
[50:12] amen into jerusalem and it baffled the
[50:15] theologians
[50:17] of that day the pharisees and the
[50:19] sadducees they asked the question
[50:22] who is this and if they
[50:26] had really been studied or up in their
[50:28] scriptures they would have known
[50:30] that prophecies had prophesied already
[50:33] that that's the way
[50:34] the messiah would ride into jerusalem
[50:38] the coming of the lord has been one of
[50:39] those issues that most people have
[50:43] tried to figure out everybody want to
[50:46] know when
[50:47] and how and often time when we try to
[50:50] figure those things out god always do
[50:54] something contrary to what we think
[50:58] and i just on that line jesus christ
[51:02] had already come and nobody knew who he
[51:05] was
[51:06] now he came amen even to
[51:09] the synagogue there and where he was
[51:13] circumcised on the eighth day and only
[51:15] two people recognized his coming and
[51:17] that was
[51:18] simeon and anna
[51:21] and they began to prophesy about how
[51:24] the messiah had come and remember simeon
[51:27] said that the lord has shown
[51:28] him that he would not die until he see
[51:32] the coming of the lord here he was in
[51:35] the temple
[51:36] at the age of 12 and he was definitely
[51:40] preaching to those theologians at that
[51:42] time
[51:43] he was already there and nobody knew him
[51:46] of course when he went down to egypt
[51:48] they would have never known him anyhow
[51:51] but i said all of this to say think
[51:53] about all of the people
[51:54] millions on top of millions of people
[51:56] who never knew that jesus christ had
[51:58] come
[52:00] right in jerusalem right in nazareth
[52:02] right
[52:03] right in the area in which he was born
[52:05] bethlehem you name it
[52:06] there are so many people that lived
[52:08] during that time didn't even know that
[52:10] jesus was the messiah
[52:12] and so god always coming away when peop
[52:14] in a place a way
[52:16] that is so simple most people bypass it
[52:19] they don't understand it they don't see
[52:21] him
[52:22] and when they do see him they won't
[52:24] recognize him because he's just too
[52:26] simple when we think about the time
[52:29] this time how is he going to come
[52:33] and if he would come how would he come
[52:36] and the thing is we know that the
[52:39] rapture
[52:39] is soon to take place and when we call
[52:42] rapture we're talking about the
[52:43] translation we're talking about the
[52:45] changing of the body
[52:47] but understand that according to matthew
[52:49] 25
[52:51] there were five wise and five foolish
[52:53] and
[52:55] the bible tells us that the word of god
[52:57] said go ye
[52:58] out prepare yourself trim your lamps
[53:01] make ready yourself to meet him so there
[53:04] is a preparation
[53:06] in order for us to prepare to meet the
[53:10] lord
[53:11] now we know the messages and we're going
[53:13] to work with those in just a minute
[53:15] but i want to say by god's grace how it
[53:17] is a serious time
[53:19] far more serious than most people know
[53:22] we can see
[53:23] the world moving and and all of the
[53:26] politics and
[53:27] all of the churches moving into this
[53:29] social uniting
[53:31] and we know what that is it is the
[53:33] forming of the mark of the beast
[53:35] now we realize by god's grace that at
[53:37] this time when all the churches came
[53:40] together
[53:41] remember sex came together even when
[53:43] they hate they hated jesus so much
[53:46] till they came together to destroy him
[53:49] and usually when you see satan's kingdom
[53:52] gathering there
[53:53] they're gathering for a purpose and of
[53:56] course the purpose amen is the bride of
[53:58] jesus christ
[53:59] remember brother branham talks about
[54:01] those demons uh 200
[54:04] 000 million i have a million thousand
[54:05] whatever it is there's so many of them i
[54:07] can't count them
[54:08] but he said they were loosed out of the
[54:10] river euphrates
[54:12] amen during the time of world war ii i
[54:14] believe
[54:16] one uh but we find out by god's grace
[54:19] amen they were loosed
[54:20] amen to to to uh how i would say
[54:24] to battle the bride amen to come against
[54:27] the bride
[54:28] now a lot of us we think about uh the
[54:31] devil when he comes he's
[54:33] he's coming in such a rage that you know
[54:35] he's going to rip us apart and you know
[54:38] but you got to realize understand that
[54:40] satan is what we call
[54:41] a smooth character he's a slitherer
[54:46] he's a snake he moves slowly but he
[54:49] knows
[54:50] exactly when to strike and so he comes
[54:53] in a way
[54:54] and we see what he's doing now i'm going
[54:56] to hit a few things that you may not
[54:58] agree with me on
[54:59] uh but he comes amen in a way of social
[55:04] media
[55:07] uh he comes in a way uh you say well
[55:09] what do you mean brother many of us
[55:11] as we've heard preached here before our
[55:13] phones become
[55:15] uh you know omniscient
[55:19] and google becomes omniscient
[55:24] knowing all things you want to know
[55:27] something ask google
[55:28] we don't even go to god in prayer no
[55:30] more
[55:32] we just go and we click on google now
[55:34] i'm just trying to tell you what
[55:36] what this science is doing to the people
[55:39] and believe in me anytime satan gives
[55:42] you something i'm not
[55:43] i'm not preaching against all technology
[55:46] it's what you do with the technology
[55:48] okay because god produced this
[55:50] technology for the gospel
[55:53] amen and he allowed maybe men who were
[55:56] not
[55:57] christians to to make it make them but
[56:00] you know the the intelligence
[56:02] of all of that comes from god and so
[56:05] if i thank god because if it wasn't for
[56:08] intelligence i
[56:09] or the the you know i wouldn't have my
[56:11] ipad i wouldn't have my phone
[56:13] so i'm grateful for those things but we
[56:15] must understand that if we're not
[56:16] careful these things become
[56:18] idols and and we can make make ourselves
[56:22] an
[56:22] idol worshiper right because some people
[56:25] they cannot you know detach themselves
[56:28] from their iphones they get sick
[56:30] you know what i mean they they'll hold
[56:32] days around that they forever doing this
[56:35] forever doing this and and eventually
[56:37] they're going to need a chiropractor
[56:40] because your hair is not meant to be
[56:42] this way it's meant to be this way
[56:45] right so i'm just saying wherever
[56:47] there's good there's always
[56:48] evil and i want you to understand satan
[56:52] is winning a lot of souls by way of the
[56:55] social media
[56:57] and and you got to understand that 99
[57:00] perhaps 0.9
[57:02] of the stuff you see on it is their lies
[57:06] hello now we understand that we think
[57:09] everything is free but when every when
[57:12] anything becomes free to you
[57:14] it's never free because you becomes the
[57:18] uh
[57:19] thing that they're marketing
[57:22] you see what i'm saying for example when
[57:25] every time you
[57:26] click on something somebody's getting
[57:28] paid
[57:29] and they send all that advertising and
[57:31] stuff to you hey man so you can click on
[57:33] it and every time you click on it
[57:35] something someone get paid for that so
[57:38] they're using you
[57:40] and you're getting what they think you
[57:42] know you're enjoying it right
[57:44] you know what i'm saying and what you
[57:46] got to understand is that certain things
[57:47] that we involve ourselves this is not
[57:49] even part of my message i haven't even
[57:50] got there
[57:51] but but it's just something that has
[57:53] been heavy on my heart because you know
[57:55] what they call a dope head
[57:57] many times we think about dope heads we
[57:59] think about people that do drugs
[58:01] but really the word dope head for my
[58:03] understanding came from the very fact
[58:06] that it's
[58:06] dopamine whenever you know you feel an
[58:10] ecstasy
[58:11] for an example i i love certain cakes
[58:15] or ice creams or whatever and then when
[58:17] i think about that
[58:18] my mouth the adrenaline that everything
[58:20] began to water and
[58:22] you know you know you know what i mean
[58:23] all of a sudden you feel this real
[58:25] rush like oh my yes i gotta have it
[58:29] well that's exactly the kind of thing
[58:30] that a lot of drugs give you
[58:33] that kind of a feeling that kind of a
[58:35] high and so that's what happens
[58:38] hey man you you're here and you're
[58:39] getting that good warm feeling
[58:41] and you don't understand that your body
[58:43] is releasing dopamine so
[58:45] and eventually you become a dope head
[58:48] now
[58:48] i said all of that just to stir somebody
[58:51] up
[58:51] so that you can pray but anyway by god's
[58:55] grace we're here
[58:56] amen to to work with what god is trying
[58:59] to get us to see
[59:01] we're living in the last days nothing
[59:05] should hold us in prison paul said i
[59:09] will not be
[59:10] in bondage to nothing right
[59:14] we are here to destroy every the works
[59:17] of satan
[59:18] by way of jesus christ now i'm going to
[59:21] go
[59:21] by god's grace hopefully pray for me
[59:23] saints i'm looking at this thing and i'm
[59:25] thinking
[59:26] okay we're in a day that i don't think
[59:28] most people see
[59:30] and you don't heard me talk about the
[59:31] cloud and how the cloud really is the
[59:33] coming of the lord
[59:35] it is not the final it's not the final
[59:38] it's literally given in three parts and
[59:41] that's what people don't know
[59:42] they don't study don't see and they
[59:44] don't understand
[59:46] why this cloud the the the the very
[59:49] thing that god did there
[59:50] in the heavens was so important to the
[59:52] believer
[59:53] because first of all in in sir is is
[59:56] this the time
[59:58] brother madam didn't understand it he
[59:59] didn't know exactly what god was doing
[1:00:02] but remember and i'm gonna skip a lot of
[1:00:03] things because i got a lot of notes and
[1:00:05] therefore i can't get to everything
[1:00:06] today
[1:00:07] but the point is is that brother branham
[1:00:10] talked about those seven angels
[1:00:12] and when those seven angels came y'all
[1:00:15] remember
[1:00:15] he said they were first little birds
[1:00:17] then they were pigeons
[1:00:19] and then there were angels and he said
[1:00:20] those angels moved swiftly
[1:00:23] right now watch the way he describes it
[1:00:26] he said when they picked me up he said i
[1:00:29] saw them
[1:00:31] and it was quicker faster than the
[1:00:34] blinking of an eye
[1:00:36] more like a twinkle all right and
[1:00:39] understand when that
[1:00:40] cloud amen was up there in the heavens
[1:00:43] y'all remember he even brings out that
[1:00:46] the cloud
[1:00:47] lasted about 28 minutes which is about
[1:00:50] the space of a half hour
[1:00:52] and during that time amen that time
[1:00:55] is when something was being unveiled
[1:00:58] right because remember the six seals
[1:01:01] amen one two three four five
[1:01:03] six of the seals had already been opened
[1:01:06] and they were already in play is that
[1:01:09] right
[1:01:10] for example the sixth seal the sixth
[1:01:13] seal had a had a theme
[1:01:15] it had a theme the theme of the sixth
[1:01:17] seal is purging
[1:01:19] is that right right right
[1:01:22] because if you left behind you will be
[1:01:25] purged
[1:01:26] and you understand that the purging was
[1:01:29] for the church
[1:01:31] right then the purging under the sixth
[1:01:34] seal
[1:01:34] was for whom the jews under that same
[1:01:38] seal there comes another persian one two
[1:01:41] and three
[1:01:42] which is the planet of the world the
[1:01:45] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:01:47] by fire which will purge
[1:01:50] all the demons away from this world
[1:01:53] right and so each seal had like a
[1:01:57] threefold purpose
[1:01:58] right and we know that god works in
[1:02:01] threes and he works in seven
[1:02:03] so when we come amen by god's grace amen
[1:02:06] to the seventh seal
[1:02:07] brotherhood said that that that angel i
[1:02:10] got the quotes but i'm just gonna just
[1:02:11] go this way
[1:02:12] he said i he said that seventh angel he
[1:02:15] was you know he said
[1:02:16] he was more noticeable than any of the
[1:02:19] others
[1:02:20] hallelujah and he said that seventh
[1:02:23] angel
[1:02:24] flew and came to me
[1:02:28] right so here was the seventh angel
[1:02:31] supernatural angel
[1:02:32] coming to the seventh earthly angel
[1:02:35] realizing amen that something was about
[1:02:38] to happen
[1:02:40] remember we read there in the scripture
[1:02:42] when the seventh seal was opened
[1:02:44] there was silence in heaven right
[1:02:47] nothing could move except it would give
[1:02:50] itself away
[1:02:52] right and so listen let me tell you
[1:02:54] something
[1:02:55] if if if if the rapture was like the
[1:02:59] theologians have
[1:03:01] amen then it would not be a secret
[1:03:05] and everybody will know we're gone but
[1:03:08] brother branham said he said
[1:03:09] he said they will see the tribulation
[1:03:12] coming upon them
[1:03:13] and they will say to themselves we
[1:03:15] thought the rapture was supposed to take
[1:03:17] place
[1:03:18] and he said they will hear a voice from
[1:03:21] heaven it has
[1:03:23] already come and you missed it
[1:03:26] right that in itself will give the
[1:03:29] foolish virgins
[1:03:31] power to fight because they'll know
[1:03:34] they've missed it and in order to have
[1:03:36] eternal life
[1:03:37] they must endure the mark of the beast
[1:03:41] now he says amen in the seventh seal
[1:03:45] that consolation of angels he said now
[1:03:48] the third came
[1:03:50] from the west sweeping from the great
[1:03:53] trip uh great sweeping forward with
[1:03:56] great
[1:03:56] terrific speed and they picked me up
[1:04:00] that was coming back east with the
[1:04:02] mystery of these seven seals
[1:04:04] in junior jackson dream that the lord
[1:04:06] let me
[1:04:07] interpret for him there on the inside of
[1:04:10] that pyramid there was white
[1:04:12] stone that wasn't written on now that
[1:04:15] reason that's the reason i had to go
[1:04:17] west
[1:04:18] this is what he says i had to go west to
[1:04:20] connect
[1:04:21] with the angels see he didn't even know
[1:04:24] where he was
[1:04:25] in the in this in this vision in this in
[1:04:27] this things that were happening with
[1:04:28] junior jackson and the others he never
[1:04:30] knew his position
[1:04:32] hallelujah because remember he said when
[1:04:35] he said when that blast went off he said
[1:04:38] i thought listen to what i'm saying
[1:04:40] folks
[1:04:41] he said i thought i would i some went
[1:04:44] off and i died
[1:04:46] i was preparing to leave this place he
[1:04:49] himself who was the prophet the seventh
[1:04:50] messenger and let me understand let you
[1:04:52] understand this there is not an eighth
[1:04:54] one unless it's jesus christ himself
[1:04:56] so he comes amen and now he's caught up
[1:05:00] and all along i was thinking when he was
[1:05:02] caught up into that constellation
[1:05:04] that they told him something but they
[1:05:06] could not they did
[1:05:08] not hallelujah but what they were doing
[1:05:11] and showing him
[1:05:12] was his position in the future plan
[1:05:15] hallelujah because if you remember i'ma
[1:05:18] just
[1:05:19] let me stop trying to but if you
[1:05:21] remember the prophet god said in those
[1:05:23] eight days and i think they started
[1:05:25] march 17
[1:05:26] when brother branham began to unfold to
[1:05:29] the mystery of the seven seals to the
[1:05:30] public
[1:05:31] to the people i think it started on
[1:05:33] march 17 and
[1:05:34] it lasted for eight days so he said he
[1:05:37] said
[1:05:38] in that room i i studied a lot of things
[1:05:41] and i was about to write my own thoughts
[1:05:43] but then all of a sudden
[1:05:46] an angel came in and it was that
[1:05:49] angel that interpreted
[1:05:53] to me what what what to speak in other
[1:05:56] words he said i was caught up into
[1:05:58] that pyramid so now understand what
[1:06:01] happened there with the cloud
[1:06:03] he was caught he was caught up but
[1:06:05] nothing was given to him remember
[1:06:07] he came back not knowing what to preach
[1:06:10] now the prophet can't lie
[1:06:11] he said he didn't know what it was about
[1:06:14] hallelujah
[1:06:15] and even in his in in in the time when
[1:06:18] he was getting ready to preach it he had
[1:06:19] everybody think about the pressure he
[1:06:21] must have been under
[1:06:23] he had everybody coming and that pace
[1:06:25] was packed
[1:06:27] and he's in his room studying
[1:06:32] not knowing what to do he couldn't take
[1:06:34] some of that old stuff
[1:06:35] and give it to the people he needed god
[1:06:38] to come on the scene
[1:06:39] and if you read that message in the
[1:06:41] seventh seal that last part that they
[1:06:43] added because
[1:06:44] he said don't give this out if you read
[1:06:46] in there he said he said i was caught up
[1:06:49] into those seven thunders those angels
[1:06:54] were the seven thunders or the
[1:06:57] the revealing or the who was giving it
[1:06:59] out because he didn't know nothing about
[1:07:01] it
[1:07:02] but the seven sons seven thunders watch
[1:07:04] it he said the seven seals
[1:07:06] and the seven thunders connected to the
[1:07:09] coming of the lord
[1:07:11] hallelujah remember god
[1:07:14] interprets his own word
[1:07:17] hallelujah has nothing to do with us now
[1:07:20] now
[1:07:21] so you can understand where i'm going
[1:07:23] with this because there is there was
[1:07:25] more than
[1:07:25] just one fold to it like the six seal
[1:07:28] had three folds and
[1:07:30] the seventh seal has three folds or the
[1:07:32] thunders however you want to say it
[1:07:33] because remember it was silent so how
[1:07:36] can he preach on the seventh seal if
[1:07:38] it's silent
[1:07:40] how can he give us anything it was those
[1:07:43] angels
[1:07:44] that was ministering and if you
[1:07:46] understand he kept saying to the people
[1:07:48] can't you feel it don't you sense
[1:07:50] there's something mysterious going on in
[1:07:52] here
[1:07:53] those seven angels that was the
[1:07:55] mysterious angels
[1:07:57] was there in the meetings amen giving
[1:08:00] the word of god
[1:08:02] because the prophet had no idea what
[1:08:04] they were
[1:08:05] it was not the prophet's preaching it
[1:08:08] was god preaching through the prophet
[1:08:10] that's why he said that seven seal book
[1:08:13] is thus said the lord
[1:08:15] hallelujah oh glory to god now you say
[1:08:18] oh what are you saying brother
[1:08:20] that's all so i said all of that to say
[1:08:24] it's later than we think
[1:08:27] it's later than we think listen he goes
[1:08:31] on to say and those
[1:08:32] angels took me into that pyramid of
[1:08:35] themselves
[1:08:36] the mysteries of god known
[1:08:40] only to them
[1:08:44] so here was a part of the coming of the
[1:08:46] lord and we're missing it
[1:08:49] hallelujah we just all the cloud is
[1:08:51] fantastic but look at this
[1:08:53] god comes in like i said two years later
[1:08:55] he then chose the prophet to turn it
[1:08:57] right
[1:09:00] that's how he saw the hoffman head three
[1:09:03] witnesses right three witnesses amen
[1:09:07] that he has seen this and he said that's
[1:09:09] my lord
[1:09:10] hallelujah is that right remember when
[1:09:13] jesus
[1:09:13] ascended and they were gazing up he said
[1:09:16] don't what you're gazing up the age said
[1:09:18] what you gazing up for him
[1:09:19] like that he's going to return in a like
[1:09:22] manner
[1:09:23] now you say oh brother why are you
[1:09:25] preaching this now
[1:09:26] because it's time to preach it it's
[1:09:29] later than what we think
[1:09:31] hallelujah now the bride must come to a
[1:09:34] knowledge of who she
[1:09:35] is right because remember
[1:09:39] when god took e israel out of egypt
[1:09:43] he blinded the the the egyptians
[1:09:47] he gave light amen
[1:09:50] to israel and he blinded the egyptians
[1:09:54] hello and all along they were moving
[1:09:58] out of egypt and oh pharaoh couldn't
[1:10:01] understand
[1:10:02] in his mind that this was a supernatural
[1:10:04] thing and he should leave it alone
[1:10:08] but we find out that by god's grace we
[1:10:11] know the story
[1:10:13] now the point is with all of this to
[1:10:15] bring us to an
[1:10:16] understanding of who you are
[1:10:20] the prophet god never said when the
[1:10:22] bride comes to understand who jesus is
[1:10:26] he never said when the bride comes to
[1:10:28] know who william branham is
[1:10:29] he said when the bride comes to know who
[1:10:31] she is
[1:10:33] the rapture will take place see there's
[1:10:36] a mighty thing
[1:10:37] moving hallelujah i'm coming just help
[1:10:40] me now
[1:10:41] there's a mighty thing moving right now
[1:10:43] it's it's so invisible it's so
[1:10:45] simple till the people can't see it
[1:10:47] because you know why
[1:10:49] it only moves on the bride is that right
[1:10:53] remember the prophet of god said when
[1:10:54] those evening tithes fall
[1:10:57] he said all those who are backslidden
[1:10:59] will return
[1:11:02] there's a returning there's a people
[1:11:04] amen that's pulling that feel the pull
[1:11:06] of god
[1:11:07] they don't know listen they don't know
[1:11:09] how they're going to make it but
[1:11:10] something is pulling on them
[1:11:15] hallelujah ephesians 1
[1:11:18] 18-19 here is paul says the eyes of your
[1:11:22] understanding
[1:11:23] being enlightened that you may know what
[1:11:26] is the hope of his calling
[1:11:28] and what the riches of the glory of his
[1:11:32] inheritance in the saints and what is
[1:11:34] the exceeding
[1:11:36] greatness of his power to us who believe
[1:11:39] according to the working of his mighty
[1:11:43] power in other words it is god who's
[1:11:46] working in us
[1:11:47] he is the workman right hallelujah
[1:11:50] you and i just god's craft he's the one
[1:11:53] that's doing
[1:11:54] the work in us if we can really see it
[1:11:57] it'll give us such a joy and such an
[1:11:59] illumination
[1:12:00] amen we we won't hardly be able we won't
[1:12:02] be able to you know stand ourselves
[1:12:05] hallelujah got me stuttering brother
[1:12:07] amen because
[1:12:08] it is it's just one of those things that
[1:12:10] if you can see it
[1:12:11] you know you said preachers been
[1:12:13] preaching this all the time but you see
[1:12:15] everything must be due in season
[1:12:18] right now it has never been this way
[1:12:22] and and you know i preached not long ago
[1:12:24] when the whole nation was shut down
[1:12:27] hallelujah it was egypt
[1:12:31] because the whole world really is
[1:12:32] considered like egypt
[1:12:35] hallelujah can you imagine let me just
[1:12:37] pause here a minute
[1:12:38] can you imagine what that new generation
[1:12:41] felt like
[1:12:42] after their parents had died
[1:12:46] coming from the egypt all they ever
[1:12:48] heard was stories
[1:12:50] that's all they didn't know moses and
[1:12:53] neither did they know moses god
[1:12:57] so much so they had to be re-circumcised
[1:13:00] you understand me they didn't have just
[1:13:03] the simplicity
[1:13:04] of the message their parents failed to
[1:13:06] do
[1:13:07] and that was to circumcise their
[1:13:08] children
[1:13:10] and think about it they were the
[1:13:12] children of
[1:13:13] slaves
[1:13:16] so no doubt they didn't have this great
[1:13:19] ego
[1:13:21] but joshua was can only use
[1:13:25] those who really consider themselves as
[1:13:28] nothing
[1:13:29] these are the kind of people that god
[1:13:31] can use
[1:13:33] hallelujah and we've heard what being
[1:13:36] said here was those people at moses day
[1:13:38] all they had to do was wait on moses
[1:13:40] moses did everything
[1:13:42] but joshua says i'm a warrior i'm gonna
[1:13:45] train you how to fight
[1:13:48] hallelujah y'all understand me joshua
[1:13:51] was the greatest warrior israel ever had
[1:13:55] greater than david hallelujah
[1:13:59] and when joshua came the first thing he
[1:14:01] had to make the people know
[1:14:03] that moses was dead the ministry has
[1:14:07] changed and if you don't see listen it's
[1:14:10] the truth
[1:14:12] i've got a few things i'm going to read
[1:14:13] out in just a minute but
[1:14:15] understand joshua was the seventh seal
[1:14:19] of his church
[1:14:22] i'm going to prove it to you in just a
[1:14:23] minute
[1:14:26] because it took it takes god amen to
[1:14:29] take you over
[1:14:30] is that right remember joshua was a type
[1:14:34] of the holy ghost his name
[1:14:37] joshua means jesus
[1:14:43] it was joshua amen who taught
[1:14:47] them how to fight and but the first
[1:14:50] thing he taught them was this
[1:14:52] obedience is better than sacrifice
[1:14:58] he taught them listen i'm gonna tell you
[1:15:00] what we're going to do
[1:15:02] and i want you to do it exactly the way
[1:15:03] i told you we're going to
[1:15:06] march over around jericho and i don't
[1:15:08] want a sound out of you
[1:15:10] hallelujah don't you don't you tell the
[1:15:14] secret they don't need to know
[1:15:16] what we're doing hallelujah and and
[1:15:18] listen
[1:15:19] if you can if you can see this joshua
[1:15:22] amen represents the holy ghost
[1:15:24] right so when they cross over the red
[1:15:27] sea
[1:15:28] or the jordan jordan means death it
[1:15:31] means separation
[1:15:32] it means in order to get into this holy
[1:15:35] spirit or into the promised land
[1:15:37] you have to separate yourself from all
[1:15:39] unbelief
[1:15:40] you've got to die to it hallelujah
[1:15:44] and if you don't die to it it will be
[1:15:46] made manifest
[1:15:48] right because it can cross over but he
[1:15:51] wasn't fully a believer
[1:15:54] he was just a pretender there in the
[1:15:56] holy ghost promised land
[1:15:58] and then when the trials came up what
[1:16:00] did he do he took gold and
[1:16:03] and and wedges and uh you know garments
[1:16:06] and
[1:16:06] he thought he could hide it god said
[1:16:09] there's sin in the camp
[1:16:11] hallelujah guess what happened not only
[1:16:14] did he die
[1:16:14] but all of his children listen
[1:16:17] revelations 3 18 says listen
[1:16:19] i count thee to be to buy i counsel thee
[1:16:22] to buy of me gold tried in the fire that
[1:16:25] thou
[1:16:25] mayeth be rich and white raiment that
[1:16:29] thou may be clothed
[1:16:30] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[1:16:33] not appear
[1:16:34] anoint thine eyes with eyes have that
[1:16:37] thou
[1:16:38] may see now i'm gonna say a lot of
[1:16:40] things that i can back it up
[1:16:42] but my point is amen when it comes to
[1:16:44] the seven church ages
[1:16:45] the seven church ages was likened unto
[1:16:47] the wilderness and the
[1:16:49] seven church ages were likened unto the
[1:16:51] law
[1:16:55] in the seven church ages all they had
[1:16:56] was do not
[1:16:58] taste not and handle not that's all
[1:17:01] don't do this you can't do this you
[1:17:02] can't do that you can't do this
[1:17:04] hallelujah that's why the prophet god
[1:17:06] said it like this
[1:17:07] he said what luther preached was not
[1:17:11] good enough for wesley
[1:17:12] what wesley preached is not good enough
[1:17:15] for the pentecostals
[1:17:16] and what the pentecostal preach is not
[1:17:18] good for the bride
[1:17:20] hallelujah why because we are beyond
[1:17:23] that
[1:17:24] y'all understand me because the
[1:17:25] pentecostals
[1:17:27] one of the deadliest doctrines they ever
[1:17:29] put forth
[1:17:30] was that speaking in tongues was the
[1:17:32] evidence of the holy ghost
[1:17:34] hallelujah by opening that door they
[1:17:37] allowed
[1:17:37] devils to filtrate their camps
[1:17:40] hallelujah
[1:17:41] thank god for this message that gives us
[1:17:44] a definition of the holy ghost
[1:17:47] hallelujah
[1:17:48] what is given for hallelujah and who it
[1:17:51] is
[1:17:52] is that all right so we realize amen
[1:17:55] there are a lot of things that they did
[1:17:56] there
[1:17:57] we cannot afford to take over
[1:18:00] we must die to all of that hallelujah
[1:18:05] oh glory to god now what we must
[1:18:07] understand is that god is not
[1:18:09] just uh throwing things up in the air
[1:18:12] and
[1:18:12] hoping and wishing that it it all lands
[1:18:15] just right
[1:18:16] everything that has been done and is
[1:18:18] being done has been predestinated by god
[1:18:21] by god's foreknowledge you hear me here
[1:18:24] why aren't we out there somewhere
[1:18:26] but god predestinated us to be here he
[1:18:29] chose us to be here this message
[1:18:31] is for us amen tonight hallelujah
[1:18:35] what is it you and i must understand
[1:18:38] that here god comes along and he he's
[1:18:40] literally giving us things that
[1:18:42] you know and is laying right there in
[1:18:44] the message because really brother ben
[1:18:46] said like this
[1:18:48] he said if a man come who say he's a
[1:18:50] messenger
[1:18:51] no matter how gifted he is and i'm
[1:18:53] paraphrasing it
[1:18:54] and he doesn't give you something new
[1:18:58] but gives you the same old message
[1:19:01] that you've been used to he said don't
[1:19:03] have nothing to do with that
[1:19:05] because every real messenger will bring
[1:19:08] something new hello
[1:19:12] so i'ma break it down so you and i can
[1:19:14] understand
[1:19:15] if we have moved out of the seven church
[1:19:18] age
[1:19:18] there must be a new message
[1:19:24] hallelujah now if you take the type in
[1:19:26] shadow
[1:19:27] you'll find out that joshua had a
[1:19:29] different message than
[1:19:30] moses even though he could not forget
[1:19:33] what moses taught
[1:19:35] it was a building upon what moses taught
[1:19:38] hallelujah and it was a continuation of
[1:19:41] it
[1:19:42] but now it's no longer moses it's joshua
[1:19:46] and understand joshua is a fighter and
[1:19:50] he's teaching his people
[1:19:51] amen god has given you the land but
[1:19:53] you've got to fight for it
[1:19:56] you can possess it wherever you put your
[1:19:58] foot
[1:19:59] amen it's yours i don't care if the land
[1:20:02] is full of giants
[1:20:04] you can conquer the giants hallelujah
[1:20:08] see you and i must understand we're not
[1:20:10] children anymore
[1:20:11] we're maturing into this image of christ
[1:20:14] and one thing about perfect love
[1:20:16] it casts out fear y'all hear me you
[1:20:19] don't cast it out perfect love casts it
[1:20:21] out
[1:20:21] it removes the fear out of your life
[1:20:24] right now
[1:20:25] amen we are the church triumphant
[1:20:28] hallelujah glory to god we come to
[1:20:31] valley
[1:20:32] we don't win we're not here to just lay
[1:20:33] down and let laodicea destroy us
[1:20:36] this is our land hallelujah you believe
[1:20:40] that
[1:20:40] i do beloved now we the sons of god and
[1:20:43] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[1:20:45] but we
[1:20:46] know that when he shall appear in 1963
[1:20:50] when he shall appear we
[1:20:53] shall be like him for we shall see
[1:20:57] him as he is y'all remember that
[1:21:01] now remember moses said lord i want to
[1:21:02] see you
[1:21:04] moses has seen the pill of fire he has
[1:21:06] seen the pill of cloud
[1:21:08] he has seen all of the plagues of egypt
[1:21:11] he saw god divide the
[1:21:12] red sea and he gets over on the other
[1:21:15] side and says lord
[1:21:16] i want to see you
[1:21:19] you want to see me
[1:21:22] but we would take all of those things
[1:21:26] amen all of those acts and say that's
[1:21:29] god and it was
[1:21:31] but moses said i want to get a little
[1:21:33] more personal than that
[1:21:35] i want to see you and god says no you
[1:21:37] can't see me
[1:21:39] because if you see me you will die
[1:21:44] hallelujah he said but i'll tell you
[1:21:45] what i'll do i'll hide you in the clefs
[1:21:48] of the rock
[1:21:49] and i will pass by you and you will see
[1:21:51] my
[1:21:52] my back side of me and that's all you're
[1:21:55] going to see
[1:21:56] but remember there was a there was a a
[1:21:59] special class of people hallelujah
[1:22:03] that god has ordained to see him
[1:22:06] face to face wait a minute
[1:22:10] okay that's why the cloud had revealed
[1:22:13] his face
[1:22:14] we're the only generation there's a
[1:22:16] bride it signifies
[1:22:18] that the bride is here because brother
[1:22:21] branham said it was not given to the
[1:22:22] public they don't need to
[1:22:24] know it wasn't for them
[1:22:27] hallelujah but everybody that recognizes
[1:22:30] the face
[1:22:34] loves his appearing he said these are
[1:22:37] they
[1:22:37] those are the ones i will appear to
[1:22:39] those are the ones i will come to
[1:22:41] oh people of god you've got to
[1:22:43] understand it is god who chooses his
[1:22:45] bride
[1:22:46] we can't choose god it's god who chooses
[1:22:49] his bride
[1:22:52] because you've never heard it before
[1:22:53] doesn't mean it ain't true
[1:22:56] listen first john 4 17 here is our love
[1:23:00] made perfect
[1:23:01] that we may have boldness in the day of
[1:23:04] judgment
[1:23:05] because as he is so are we
[1:23:08] in this world
[1:23:12] how do we know how how do we know how he
[1:23:15] is
[1:23:17] how do we know
[1:23:21] see what what we don't understand i'm
[1:23:23] not dismissing that
[1:23:25] the last part of this thing you know
[1:23:27] we're not going to see jesus that's not
[1:23:28] what i'm saying
[1:23:30] i'm saying nobody knows how
[1:23:33] and when that's the point i'm making
[1:23:37] you you you can't tell me denominational
[1:23:39] people know how and when
[1:23:41] and you know what they do they they hold
[1:23:44] that thing over
[1:23:44] on you the way they believe
[1:23:48] and you know what they say if you don't
[1:23:50] live right if you don't get it together
[1:23:52] you're gonna miss the rapture
[1:23:55] if the rapture catches you undone you
[1:23:58] you missed it
[1:23:59] the bride cannot miss the rapture
[1:24:03] there is no such thing there is not such
[1:24:05] god don't have a relationship
[1:24:07] like that with his bride
[1:24:10] why he chose her before the foundation
[1:24:16] there is no chance you can miss the
[1:24:18] rapture if your bride
[1:24:23] and you can't let that the devil hole
[1:24:25] hold that over you well uh
[1:24:26] you know i might miss it if i no sir it
[1:24:30] ain't it ain't it ain't
[1:24:31] this is not this will be changed
[1:24:35] it is a soul that cannot die
[1:24:39] is that right the bible says it is the
[1:24:41] soul that cannot sin it
[1:24:43] why because the seed of god remains in
[1:24:46] there
[1:24:48] hallelujah is that right you and i must
[1:24:51] understand
[1:24:52] amen when we say oh we justified as
[1:24:54] though we've never done it before
[1:24:55] understand he's working with the soul
[1:25:00] you can't do the sin in him with your
[1:25:02] flesh and said i never did it before
[1:25:07] you know what that calls for repentance
[1:25:11] god forgive me but your soul will
[1:25:14] ever forever stay perfect in the eyes of
[1:25:17] god
[1:25:18] once your soul is saved and redeemed
[1:25:22] hallelujah is that all right hallelujah
[1:25:26] see we are the place amen now when god
[1:25:28] made man in the beginning
[1:25:29] he made man him superior i'm reading
[1:25:32] something to you because
[1:25:33] you know these complexes that all we all
[1:25:35] of us have like
[1:25:36] you know we barely make again and you
[1:25:39] know we ain't nothing and
[1:25:40] and but you made in the image of god and
[1:25:42] you can truly say that
[1:25:46] thank god he didn't make me a dog or cat
[1:25:49] he made me in his image hallelujah
[1:25:52] and when he made man in the beginning he
[1:25:54] made him superior to
[1:25:56] anything on earth he gave him
[1:25:59] jurisdiction of
[1:26:00] everything on earth to control
[1:26:02] everything
[1:26:03] he controlled the animal life he
[1:26:06] controlled the foul life
[1:26:07] the fishes of the sea he controlled the
[1:26:10] winds
[1:26:10] he controlled the plant life he
[1:26:12] controlled every i'm reading
[1:26:16] why am i reading this this is laying
[1:26:18] there
[1:26:19] and brother branham is speaking of the
[1:26:20] first adam
[1:26:23] and if the seals of the opening of the
[1:26:25] seals amen brought us back to the place
[1:26:28] that adam was before the fall that means
[1:26:30] this kind of potential is in
[1:26:34] us
[1:26:36] hallelujah man was a made as a second a
[1:26:39] secondary god on earth
[1:26:41] he was given the power to control all
[1:26:43] things elements of the earth
[1:26:45] that was adam adam was given these great
[1:26:47] powers
[1:26:48] hallelujah but then the power that he
[1:26:50] was given to him
[1:26:52] make himself is where he fell hallelujah
[1:26:56] but but before he failed that's where
[1:26:59] i'm going
[1:27:00] he was an amateur god hallelujah amen
[1:27:04] and you and i amen we failed we came in
[1:27:07] here
[1:27:08] we bypassed our theophany and all of
[1:27:11] that still was the plan of god
[1:27:13] yes hallelujah that the word one day
[1:27:16] will become flesh again hallelujah
[1:27:19] and you and i must understand by god's
[1:27:21] grace if the first adam had
[1:27:23] that ability if you've got the holy
[1:27:26] ghost
[1:27:27] yes in you and don't tell me oh
[1:27:32] i can't do it see what happened
[1:27:35] god gives you a commission he gives you
[1:27:37] things hey man and he expect for you to
[1:27:39] use it
[1:27:40] we'd be like waiting on god god is
[1:27:42] waiting on you
[1:27:44] remember when they were on the ship and
[1:27:46] they were in the and jesus was there on
[1:27:48] the ship
[1:27:48] and all of a sudden the storm came up
[1:27:50] water started coming everywhere
[1:27:51] the sails broke the oars and everything
[1:27:53] else and then peter said master
[1:27:56] carried out not that we perish
[1:28:00] make god help us because that's the
[1:28:02] first thing we do
[1:28:03] we we we all won't throw it out on god
[1:28:05] like you know it's his fault
[1:28:08] jesus spoke amen to that that wind
[1:28:12] and that storm and he said peace be
[1:28:14] still
[1:28:15] now this is the thing that always got me
[1:28:18] if they were not
[1:28:19] capable of doing it why did jesus rebuke
[1:28:21] them
[1:28:22] and say oh ye of little faith where did
[1:28:25] you doubt
[1:28:28] that means they knew god had already
[1:28:30] told them
[1:28:31] you have power is that right you got
[1:28:34] powers over
[1:28:34] devils you got powers over everything
[1:28:38] where did you doubt
[1:28:46] you see what i'm saying he was there
[1:28:49] but he was not a he really didn't want
[1:28:51] them to wake him
[1:28:53] he wanted them to use the authority that
[1:28:55] he had given them
[1:28:57] a lot of time we said oh jesus help me
[1:28:59] jesus and jesus standing like you got
[1:29:01] that big old sword in your hand swaying
[1:29:03] it
[1:29:05] do something with what you've got god is
[1:29:08] in you
[1:29:09] and this is the thing he said i'll never
[1:29:11] leave you nor will i forsake you
[1:29:13] like i was saying this but time and time
[1:29:16] again sometimes we need to stir
[1:29:17] up the kool-aid the shoe
[1:29:21] yeah i don't drink people don't drink
[1:29:22] kool-aid no more i guess i don't know
[1:29:24] but you know you put all that sugar in
[1:29:25] there and variety there's like waves in
[1:29:27] there
[1:29:27] waves in the kool-aid right but if you
[1:29:30] let it sit all that sugar gonna go down
[1:29:32] to the bottom
[1:29:32] and you get a glass and it's gonna be
[1:29:34] bitter because you the sugar's at the
[1:29:35] bottom
[1:29:36] and what you need to do take that big
[1:29:37] old spoon and stir that baby up and all
[1:29:39] of a sudden it's brand new
[1:29:41] hallelujah because when i was a boy that
[1:29:43] was my favorite drink i
[1:29:44] i like blackberry i like cherry i like
[1:29:47] every color
[1:29:48] kind they had as long as they had sugar
[1:29:50] in it
[1:29:52] but my point is that's how it is with
[1:29:54] the holy ghost all we need to do is stir
[1:29:57] it up hallelujah
[1:30:00] oh my now that is the beginning of man
[1:30:02] that's what god
[1:30:03] give him power over everything on the
[1:30:06] earth
[1:30:07] now though the fall through the fall the
[1:30:10] lost
[1:30:10] he lost the power then he becomes
[1:30:13] unconscious of the fact
[1:30:14] after losing his relationship of
[1:30:17] friendship friendship with the father
[1:30:18] fellowship of the father
[1:30:20] then he lost that and all of his great
[1:30:22] channels become clogged up
[1:30:24] and he couldn't get through now what is
[1:30:27] the message for
[1:30:28] the message is to unclog all of your
[1:30:32] channels
[1:30:34] because all of us got some kind of
[1:30:36] hindrance
[1:30:39] and the hindrance comes from clogs
[1:30:42] once the god can unclog your the the
[1:30:45] the thing that's hindering you amen
[1:30:47] you'll see yourself stronger
[1:30:49] hallelujah it's like having a blood clot
[1:30:51] or something in your blood
[1:30:52] that's blocking up the tube
[1:30:56] you feel a whole lot better
[1:31:00] right see what it is god is still
[1:31:02] unfolding remember i said this the other
[1:31:04] week
[1:31:04] i said god is still unfolding right
[1:31:08] you know the message tells teaches us
[1:31:10] that he was elohim
[1:31:12] from elohim he came down and then became
[1:31:15] the pill of fire who was jesus himself
[1:31:16] right
[1:31:17] but that same pill of fire amen became a
[1:31:20] man
[1:31:21] right now watch this because as he
[1:31:23] unfolds himself
[1:31:24] the next thing you see is adam
[1:31:28] god in adam that's what made adam a god
[1:31:32] because god was in adam that's why adam
[1:31:35] could name
[1:31:36] all the animals and get an a plus
[1:31:38] because god was in adam
[1:31:40] that was god unfolding himself into a
[1:31:42] man
[1:31:43] y'all remember that that's what they
[1:31:45] hated jesus for they said you
[1:31:47] you're trying to he says you're a man
[1:31:49] and you're trying to be god
[1:31:50] but they got it wrong it was god trying
[1:31:52] to be a man
[1:31:54] hallelujah and so we don't we don't
[1:31:57] realize
[1:31:58] amen that we are the children of god
[1:32:03] we're not step children we're not some
[1:32:06] uh uh adopted children with no the
[1:32:09] different blood but we're from the same
[1:32:11] blood
[1:32:14] yeah am i making sense i'm trying to get
[1:32:17] where where
[1:32:17] where i'm trying to go and i don't want
[1:32:19] to be here too much longer
[1:32:20] jesus christ is choosing his own bride
[1:32:24] just the same as men choose their brides
[1:32:26] today
[1:32:27] the bride today does not simply decide
[1:32:30] she is going to take a
[1:32:31] certain man for her husband no sir it is
[1:32:34] the groom
[1:32:35] who decides sides and chooses a certain
[1:32:38] man for his bride hallelujah
[1:32:41] saint john 15 16 you have not chosen me
[1:32:44] but i have chosen you now according to
[1:32:47] the word
[1:32:47] the bride was chosen before the
[1:32:50] foundation of the world
[1:32:52] the choosing of the bride was purposed
[1:32:54] in himself ephesians 1
[1:32:55] 9 and in romans 9 11 it says that the
[1:32:58] purpose of god according to election
[1:33:01] might stand wait a minute
[1:33:06] did y'all get that it can't do nothing
[1:33:10] but stand
[1:33:13] hallelujah because it's god election
[1:33:16] you can't read it any other way the
[1:33:19] heart purpose
[1:33:22] the heart purpose the eternal purpose of
[1:33:24] god was to take a bride
[1:33:26] of his own choosing and that purpose was
[1:33:30] in himself and being eternal was decreed
[1:33:34] before the foundation of the world so
[1:33:37] who's going to change it
[1:33:40] nobody put you in and nobody can take
[1:33:43] you out
[1:33:44] hallelujah now i'm coming to where i
[1:33:47] want to be
[1:33:48] so i'm not going to be much longer
[1:33:53] going back to joshua
[1:33:57] joshua amen if you read the whole joshua
[1:33:59] joshua is like
[1:34:01] revealing so much you know the seven
[1:34:03] seals and
[1:34:04] all of that is in joshua even at the end
[1:34:07] when joshua
[1:34:08] began to he's old now right
[1:34:11] and and and he's getting ready to die
[1:34:13] now you say well how can that be joshua
[1:34:15] types out the holy ghost but remember
[1:34:18] the holy ghost is a temporary gift
[1:34:22] it's only given to you to bring you to a
[1:34:24] maturity
[1:34:26] and once you mature you the son you
[1:34:29] you're now ready to be
[1:34:31] adopted don't i don't understand it all
[1:34:33] but i know that's what it is
[1:34:37] because when joshua died now they were
[1:34:39] on their own
[1:34:43] y'all understand me so you say well what
[1:34:46] do you mean brother
[1:34:47] so the holy ghost is given to us like to
[1:34:50] bring us up to the statue of a perfect
[1:34:51] man
[1:34:52] right hello
[1:34:55] it is there to bring you up it is to
[1:34:57] have to mature you you've got a tutor
[1:35:00] you which is the holy ghost that teaches
[1:35:01] you how to have faith virtue knowledge
[1:35:04] and all that
[1:35:05] it's there to tell you when you you made
[1:35:07] a mistake and when you
[1:35:08] you know and you've done well those kind
[1:35:11] of things
[1:35:12] and it brings you up to that place
[1:35:14] wherein that you
[1:35:15] as a bride can be introduced
[1:35:21] to your husband because remember we're
[1:35:24] talking about a wedding here you know
[1:35:27] and you are there and then you're
[1:35:29] growing into maturity
[1:35:30] and everything else is that right
[1:35:34] because remember when did when did
[1:35:36] abraham
[1:35:37] first see mechanic it was after the
[1:35:40] battle
[1:35:42] so there's always a final battle before
[1:35:45] you
[1:35:45] finally re he will materialize himself
[1:35:51] and you will see him and know him now
[1:35:54] remember i told you that the coming of
[1:35:56] the lord was also part
[1:35:58] of that first right the cloud
[1:36:01] the second part was when he came and
[1:36:04] here he was
[1:36:04] in the midst of the congregation and
[1:36:06] they didn't even know he was there
[1:36:09] seven angels ministering for eight days
[1:36:12] right but you gotta understand those
[1:36:15] same angels
[1:36:16] that brother bannon was caught in those
[1:36:18] seven thunder angels
[1:36:20] i'm not trying to make something
[1:36:22] mystical
[1:36:24] because as we preach like they preached
[1:36:27] then
[1:36:29] there was revelations being given out
[1:36:31] you didn't see no angels
[1:36:33] and the only reason why we know they
[1:36:35] were there because brother branham said
[1:36:36] they were
[1:36:38] hallelujah that's why the bible said
[1:36:40] when you see that day approaching come
[1:36:41] together the more why
[1:36:42] because it will be those thunders
[1:36:46] ministering to the people hallelujah
[1:36:49] and you and i can be hearing the same
[1:36:51] message
[1:36:53] but the bride whoever she is
[1:36:56] will get a revelation that nobody else
[1:36:59] can see
[1:37:00] it's just that personal because the
[1:37:03] thing is
[1:37:04] amen they all wondered whose names
[1:37:07] were written in the lamb's book of life
[1:37:10] who are they
[1:37:13] the people who missed out they want to
[1:37:18] know
[1:37:22] you love the lord you see
[1:37:26] joshua when joshua first comes over
[1:37:31] and all of a sudden he see a man
[1:37:32] standing by the wall with his soul drawn
[1:37:36] and joshua knew his commission he knew
[1:37:38] his position
[1:37:40] because god had already told him as i
[1:37:42] was with moses so will i be with you
[1:37:44] and here come joshua see this man
[1:37:46] standing there and joshua's like who
[1:37:48] who whose side are you on he was ready
[1:37:50] to fight bro
[1:37:52] and we find out that when when when he
[1:37:54] says i am the captain of the lord's host
[1:37:56] what did joshua do
[1:37:58] he fell he went into worship because he
[1:38:02] realized that was god
[1:38:04] the same pill of fire that was with
[1:38:06] moses
[1:38:08] that was in the uh the the the the
[1:38:11] cloud by day pillow fire by night
[1:38:14] that same pill of fire that was in the
[1:38:17] bush
[1:38:18] was now standing in a man
[1:38:22] lot said just now
[1:38:26] because if the people could have seen
[1:38:30] what was radiating from brother branham
[1:38:32] at the time he was bringing forth the
[1:38:33] seals
[1:38:35] they would have recognized that same
[1:38:36] pill of fire
[1:38:38] was now speaking through him human flesh
[1:38:41] hallelujah see and understand joshua
[1:38:45] what was joshua doing let me say it
[1:38:47] again
[1:38:47] he was teaching them to walk he was
[1:38:50] teaching
[1:38:51] them how to possess their mountain
[1:38:56] full adoption right and think about it
[1:38:59] only two of them
[1:39:02] why because joshua and caleb they saw
[1:39:06] that that it wasn't most listen can
[1:39:08] anybody in here
[1:39:10] see already the red sea open
[1:39:13] and think a man did it
[1:39:16] out of all those people joshua and caleb
[1:39:19] had eyes to see
[1:39:20] oh my that's god in that man
[1:39:26] and from that point on according to the
[1:39:29] prophet
[1:39:29] they followed moses but they knew it was
[1:39:31] god behind the veil
[1:39:33] that's why they had a different spirit
[1:39:36] when they sent those spies over there to
[1:39:38] the land
[1:39:38] out there and and 10 came back said we
[1:39:41] can't do it
[1:39:42] they got giants over there yeah joshua
[1:39:45] and caleb said yeah
[1:39:47] there are giants over there and they got
[1:39:48] giant grapes and i got some to prove it
[1:39:54] hallelujah what was he doing joshua and
[1:39:57] caleb was bringing forth
[1:39:58] the evidence of the prosperity of the
[1:40:02] land
[1:40:04] hallelujah and they had is that right
[1:40:07] caleb had to steal the people
[1:40:09] we're more than able to take the land
[1:40:12] see the devil can't tell me i can't re
[1:40:14] reach perfection
[1:40:15] we're more than able to take the land
[1:40:18] we've got a message
[1:40:20] that says that god gave to us the
[1:40:22] ability to control
[1:40:24] everything amen he taught his people
[1:40:28] he said if you say to this mountain be
[1:40:30] thou movement must be cast into the sea
[1:40:33] he taught them that that sons of god
[1:40:36] this is what the whole creation waiting
[1:40:38] for to see you
[1:40:39] in manifestation it ain't enough to say
[1:40:42] well i'm in the message that ain't got
[1:40:44] nothing to do with it
[1:40:46] it's whether the message is in you
[1:40:48] hallelujah where are you positioned
[1:40:50] are you still in the church ages or in
[1:40:52] your capstone
[1:40:54] because the capstone amen is the eighth
[1:40:56] day it is where god is it's your kind of
[1:40:59] glory
[1:40:59] it's where it changes you in the church
[1:41:02] ages we worked to change ourselves
[1:41:04] but brother baby said listen in this
[1:41:06] statue of a perfect man
[1:41:08] you don't change you it changes you
[1:41:11] hallelujah he took it to another level
[1:41:18] hallelujah he said there's never been a
[1:41:21] general like joshua
[1:41:22] no time no age nowhere has there ever
[1:41:25] been a
[1:41:26] compared with joshua the word joshua
[1:41:28] comes from the word of jesus
[1:41:30] means jesus our savior deliverer and so
[1:41:32] when you see
[1:41:33] this man what was it it was a captain in
[1:41:36] other words
[1:41:37] the leader of the host of israel and the
[1:41:40] leader
[1:41:40] was none other than christ himself and
[1:41:43] what was he first seen in
[1:41:45] a pillar of fire now isn't that amazing
[1:41:48] because we come out of the seven church
[1:41:50] ages and when we come out of the seven
[1:41:52] church ages
[1:41:53] a mighty angel shows up
[1:41:57] hallelujah and he puts one foot on the
[1:41:59] land and one of the others
[1:42:00] on the sea hallelujah the same kind of
[1:42:03] scenario
[1:42:05] joshua comes out he meets the captain of
[1:42:07] the lord's host
[1:42:08] hallelujah and then we we meet the
[1:42:11] mighty angel
[1:42:12] and what was he doing coming down to
[1:42:14] fight for you
[1:42:16] oh my goodness is that right because we
[1:42:20] understand when that sword hit brother
[1:42:22] branham's hand
[1:42:22] god didn't give him a violin god gave
[1:42:24] him a sword
[1:42:26] and you know what the sword was for
[1:42:28] fighting
[1:42:29] and he said what this is the king sword
[1:42:32] and then brother brown said that king
[1:42:34] sword was the word
[1:42:35] that's the message
[1:42:38] and if you'd study the message from the
[1:42:41] time
[1:42:42] god opened the seals then you'll begin
[1:42:43] to see more things about yourself
[1:42:46] than you ever seen before
[1:42:49] hallelujah you got to understand we come
[1:42:51] to take over
[1:42:55] satan yeah when he this bride leaves
[1:42:58] he's gonna be glad we left
[1:43:04] yeah that's what he said and now the
[1:43:06] pill of fire had become a man
[1:43:08] i hope you know what i'm talking about
[1:43:10] he had become a man
[1:43:12] joshua alone by himself seen just what
[1:43:15] it was
[1:43:15] that the pillar of fire that had led
[1:43:17] them as the angel here
[1:43:19] he stood and called himself the captain
[1:43:21] of the of the host
[1:43:22] he was the unseen one he is still the
[1:43:25] captain of the host of the lord
[1:43:27] the unseen one the invisible one the
[1:43:30] omnipotent one
[1:43:31] here tonight just as real as he was
[1:43:33] standing there
[1:43:34] against the walls of jericho
[1:43:38] he's real and what we must understand
[1:43:41] that this message is dimensional
[1:43:45] is that right because brotherhood said
[1:43:47] the seven says he said those thunders
[1:43:49] thundered into heaven man they did
[1:43:55] but because it thundered doesn't mean we
[1:43:57] understood what he did what he said
[1:43:59] when it picked up brother adam it
[1:44:01] thundered in heaven
[1:44:02] but when he was opening up the seals it
[1:44:05] thundered on earth
[1:44:08] no contradiction in what he said
[1:44:11] hallelujah is that right
[1:44:12] because the prophet god said before god
[1:44:14] do anything on earth
[1:44:15] he must declare it in the heavens how do
[1:44:19] we miss it
[1:44:20] but there it was right there laying
[1:44:23] there for
[1:44:23] before our eyes and what we're doing
[1:44:26] making ourselves ready
[1:44:28] how do you make yourself ready obedience
[1:44:31] the first
[1:44:31] lesson obedience
[1:44:36] hallelujah second lesson don't allow
[1:44:39] the world to make you pick up things
[1:44:42] from babylon
[1:44:44] no matter how pretty it is no matter how
[1:44:46] much it looked like
[1:44:47] it's worth joshua said don't take
[1:44:50] nothing
[1:44:51] keep yourself clean keep yourself pure
[1:44:56] is that right that's what the bible said
[1:44:58] those who have this hope they purify
[1:45:00] themselves
[1:45:03] you love the lord hallelujah
[1:45:08] yes she was the only one listen what he
[1:45:10] said he was standing there against the
[1:45:12] walls of jericho
[1:45:13] the same lord jesus a figurative type of
[1:45:15] course
[1:45:16] he was melchizedek that made abraham
[1:45:19] many many hundred years before there he
[1:45:22] had no father no mother
[1:45:23] no beginning of days or ending of years
[1:45:28] who was that melchizedek
[1:45:32] huh
[1:45:36] you love the lord
[1:45:40] i'm trying to hurry up like i said by
[1:45:43] god's grace
[1:45:44] brother branham likened us as a shadow
[1:45:47] he said uh
[1:45:48] i don't know if you can see the shadow
[1:45:50] he said
[1:45:52] uh the bride is the shadow of the
[1:45:54] material
[1:45:56] god and wherever the material move the
[1:45:59] bride moves with it
[1:46:01] because it's the shadow right that's
[1:46:04] deep
[1:46:06] because whatever god's getting ready to
[1:46:08] do when he moves we'll move with him
[1:46:11] understand me so i said that in order to
[1:46:14] say
[1:46:17] a lot of the things that we're now
[1:46:18] seeing if we can understand what god is
[1:46:21] doing
[1:46:22] i got so much stuff here i can't and if
[1:46:25] you
[1:46:25] just need me to go through it with you
[1:46:27] uh privately i'll be glad to do that
[1:46:29] but my point is is that we must
[1:46:31] understand
[1:46:32] it's later than we think and the rapture
[1:46:35] has more than one fold to it
[1:46:39] one more right we always say oh he will
[1:46:42] should descend with the shouting
[1:46:44] voice of a archangel and the trump
[1:46:46] should sound that's more than one event
[1:46:49] and brother ben said it happened all at
[1:46:50] the same time
[1:46:52] right so you and i must understand that
[1:46:54] everything overlaps each other
[1:46:57] right the sixth seal is still moving
[1:47:00] it ain't over yet right and you and i
[1:47:03] know by god's grace
[1:47:04] amen that the seventh seal is still
[1:47:06] moving he told us that
[1:47:08] he said the seventh seal is like a
[1:47:09] rocket you shoot it up
[1:47:11] five stars five comes out then five
[1:47:14] comes out of those five and
[1:47:15] it just keep on progressively unfolding
[1:47:19] itself but understand that last
[1:47:22] portion that he could not understand he
[1:47:25] said
[1:47:26] is not something that you'll ever
[1:47:28] understand
[1:47:30] except god reveals it
[1:47:33] it ain't nothing so much well i know
[1:47:35] exactly what those no
[1:47:36] no you don't you might know some of what
[1:47:40] the thunders are saying
[1:47:41] but you'll never understand that part
[1:47:44] that he said i couldn't make it out
[1:47:46] but i tell you what it was he said it
[1:47:48] was the coming of the lord
[1:47:51] hallelujah oh my it has something to do
[1:47:54] with the coming of the lord
[1:47:55] now let me ask you something then if the
[1:47:58] lord has come
[1:48:00] which he has but it ain't all over yet
[1:48:05] that's the thing he is progressively
[1:48:08] doing things what
[1:48:09] listen a thief is a thief and the bible
[1:48:13] said he will come
[1:48:13] as a thief
[1:48:17] and what is he doing he's stealing away
[1:48:19] people right now
[1:48:21] he's allowed this message to come the
[1:48:23] way he's come
[1:48:24] people misunderstanding people are
[1:48:27] misinterpreting and
[1:48:28] psalms fall away and some has done this
[1:48:30] and some has done that listen
[1:48:32] and people still don't see what god
[1:48:35] is doing it's like god is saying to you
[1:48:38] eat my flesh and drink my blood
[1:48:41] he is purposely allowing the numbers to
[1:48:45] diminish
[1:48:54] brother banner he says when you come up
[1:48:56] out of the world you separate yourselves
[1:48:58] from all of your
[1:48:59] earthly associates all the other parties
[1:49:02] you used to go to
[1:49:03] the worldly amusement drinking smoking
[1:49:05] gambling all those things are
[1:49:07] uh separate separated
[1:49:10] and you walk among a strange people that
[1:49:13] you haven't known
[1:49:14] before that say amen spirit feel
[1:49:16] believing in all things hoping in all
[1:49:18] things
[1:49:19] waiting for the coming of the lord
[1:49:21] professing
[1:49:22] to the pilgrims and strangers and you
[1:49:25] know brother bam said yeah he's going to
[1:49:26] come he said the lord will
[1:49:28] come and whatever and however he does it
[1:49:31] so he leaves it out there to say that
[1:49:34] yes well i don't know i can't tell you
[1:49:36] how he's going to do it
[1:49:38] none of us can say how he's going to do
[1:49:39] it
[1:49:41] we know what he's already done but that
[1:49:44] last portion
[1:49:44] you can't say how he's going to do it
[1:49:47] that's god's business
[1:49:49] but the bride will not be taken by
[1:49:51] surprise
[1:49:53] you love the lord i'm almost done
[1:49:57] we've come into the land of promise and
[1:49:58] uh i'm gonna have to
[1:50:00] two-fold this i'll be here sunday laws
[1:50:02] will and nothing should happen
[1:50:04] uh so i'm just gonna stop because i know
[1:50:07] we
[1:50:07] we we need to uh there's things i'm
[1:50:10] rushing and i don't want to rush
[1:50:13] um ephesians 6 beginning at the 10th
[1:50:16] verse is finally brethren
[1:50:18] be strong in the lord and in the power
[1:50:20] of his might
[1:50:22] put on the whole arm of god that you
[1:50:24] might be able to stand against the wiles
[1:50:26] of the devil
[1:50:27] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:50:29] blood but against principalities against
[1:50:31] powers
[1:50:32] against the rulers of darkness of this
[1:50:34] world against spiritual wickedness in
[1:50:36] high places
[1:50:38] you know when jesus come again riding on
[1:50:39] that white horse you know you'll be with
[1:50:41] him
[1:50:44] you have been proven that you're good in
[1:50:46] battle
[1:50:49] hallelujah wherefore take upon unto you
[1:50:52] the whole arm of god that you may be
[1:50:54] able to withstand in all
[1:50:56] in the evil day having done all to stand
[1:51:00] you stand hallelujah and
[1:51:03] uh you say what brother there's a
[1:51:06] oh my god have mercy lord
[1:51:10] let me let me um
[1:51:13] give me a few more minutes okay
[1:51:18] just a few he said look here
[1:51:22] here come moab down just as fundamentals
[1:51:25] as he could be
[1:51:26] brother he had every fundamental
[1:51:28] doctrine the scriptures taught
[1:51:30] and he built seven altars seven
[1:51:32] sacrifices seven bullocks seven rams
[1:51:35] just the same sacrifice as being down
[1:51:37] there in israel
[1:51:38] seven altars seven bullocks seven rams
[1:51:41] uh
[1:51:42] figurative of the coming of the lord
[1:51:44] jesus just as fundamental there
[1:51:46] as they was down there if well if god
[1:51:49] only expected you to be fundamentalist
[1:51:52] then he could not condemn moab and
[1:51:55] accept israel
[1:51:56] it would be unjust cain was just as
[1:51:59] fundamental as abel was
[1:52:01] he was the believer built a church
[1:52:03] worship offered uh sacrifice humbled
[1:52:05] himself before god
[1:52:06] if it's only takes to be a believer you
[1:52:09] say well i'm a believer well
[1:52:11] god never gives you the holy ghost
[1:52:13] you're not a believer yet
[1:52:15] that's right for god is under obligation
[1:52:17] to give you the holy ghost
[1:52:19] when he said repent and be baptized in
[1:52:21] the name of jesus christ for the
[1:52:23] remission of your sins
[1:52:24] you shall receive the gift of the holy
[1:52:25] ghost god under obligate god
[1:52:28] god's under obligation to do it
[1:52:32] for it's to who the apostles know
[1:52:35] sir peter said it's for you and your
[1:52:37] children and them that are far off
[1:52:39] even as many as the lord god shall call
[1:52:41] no matter how far it is it's for every
[1:52:44] believer
[1:52:45] now let me tell you like this if you are
[1:52:47] waiting to speak in tongues to
[1:52:49] bear witness that you got the holy ghost
[1:52:52] you might have a long wait
[1:52:56] because god may not ever let you speak
[1:52:58] in tongues
[1:52:59] that is not the evidence of the holy
[1:53:01] ghost
[1:53:02] the holy ghost is when your desire
[1:53:04] change
[1:53:05] you have an earnest desire in your heart
[1:53:07] to do the perfect will of god
[1:53:09] that is the holy ghost and you have to
[1:53:13] mature it you got to grow it right see
[1:53:16] that's how the devil tricked people
[1:53:17] oh i got to speak in tongues no you
[1:53:19] don't
[1:53:20] but you need to have a revelation that
[1:53:23] you got it on the inside
[1:53:24] because you know something has changed
[1:53:27] in your heart
[1:53:29] it ain't got nothing to do with the
[1:53:30] battles you're gonna have resistance
[1:53:33] you're gonna have battles but you know
[1:53:35] there's something in your heart
[1:53:37] that won't let you go you know what that
[1:53:39] is that is the holy ghost
[1:53:43] but when you're born again it's like a
[1:53:45] baby
[1:53:46] it's got to grow you got to feed it and
[1:53:49] the more you feed it the stronger you
[1:53:50] will become
[1:53:52] hallelujah but the thing that i love
[1:53:54] about it he said i'll never leave you
[1:53:56] nor will i forsake you
[1:53:58] ooh now i'll hold him to that one i'll
[1:54:00] hold him to that one
[1:54:01] yes sir hallelujah
[1:54:04] oh man you love the lord
[1:54:12] look what he says joshua the savior
[1:54:15] moses a type of the church organization
[1:54:18] he brought the law and so forth failed
[1:54:21] why
[1:54:22] and how did he fail glorifying himself
[1:54:25] instead of god you know that's what the
[1:54:27] churches do
[1:54:29] the preachers they're out there
[1:54:30] glorifying themselves same thing moses
[1:54:32] did
[1:54:33] and they fail when they do that is that
[1:54:35] right so it is the church today trying
[1:54:37] to see
[1:54:38] who can build the biggest church who can
[1:54:40] get the biggest dress crowd
[1:54:41] who can get the mayor of the city and
[1:54:43] all that celebrity into the church
[1:54:45] that's what the program is today as the
[1:54:47] baptist says a million more
[1:54:49] he got 54 but 44 i don't care a million
[1:54:52] more
[1:54:52] what that's it a million more joiners
[1:54:55] you have gods
[1:54:56] nothing yet i'd rather have one field
[1:54:58] with the holy ghost
[1:54:59] and full of the god's power than to have
[1:55:02] thousands times thousand church joiners
[1:55:04] rather have one alive with god who's who
[1:55:07] believes
[1:55:08] i'm trying to find something here that i
[1:55:10] can't seem to connect with but uh
[1:55:15] god is good to us
[1:55:18] just let me find this and then i'll let
[1:55:20] you go
[1:55:27] thank god for his grace
[1:55:34] hallelujah i guess god want me to
[1:55:38] minister that the next time
[1:55:40] but i i'll say it like this
[1:55:43] the church ages
[1:55:46] everything is right there right there
[1:55:48] before us
[1:55:51] brother talk about the ones who who will
[1:55:54] be coming up in the resurrection
[1:55:57] and he goes on to show how we come
[1:56:01] even in moses all of that is just
[1:56:04] comes right on up amen to the time
[1:56:08] of the jordan
[1:56:12] and then when they cross over what that
[1:56:14] means
[1:56:15] into the promised land into the holy
[1:56:17] ghost
[1:56:18] but you got to fight the whole time you
[1:56:20] in there you can't give up you can't
[1:56:22] compromise you just got to fight
[1:56:25] because god has already given you the
[1:56:26] victory he just needs to see you do
[1:56:29] something with it
[1:56:30] right and then at the end of the day
[1:56:33] like caleb said give me my mountain
[1:56:36] i've got as just as much strength as i
[1:56:38] had when i first started out
[1:56:40] i believe god just the way i've always
[1:56:42] believed in and i never will stop
[1:56:45] and i want to i want to kind of teach by
[1:56:47] god's grace on the next time or
[1:56:49] sunday lord's will if nothing should
[1:56:50] happen how that when in joshua if you
[1:56:53] read the last chapter joshua
[1:56:55] 24 you will really get a lot out of that
[1:56:59] but then it comes down to like this
[1:57:01] message
[1:57:02] because joshua takes him all the way
[1:57:04] there and then when joshua tells
[1:57:07] the people what god is requiring of them
[1:57:10] they say they'll do it
[1:57:11] and guess what joshua's saying no you
[1:57:13] don't you can't do it
[1:57:15] you will not do it joshua said no
[1:57:18] now we any anybody else would have got
[1:57:21] discouraged
[1:57:22] and would have said oh joshua don't say
[1:57:24] those things but you know what those
[1:57:26] people said
[1:57:27] nay we're not accepting that
[1:57:31] we're going to do it right because
[1:57:34] remember
[1:57:34] god will tell you things to discourage
[1:57:37] you
[1:57:38] huh just to see whether you'll stick or
[1:57:41] stay
[1:57:44] amen when he told him eat my flesh and
[1:57:46] drink my blood
[1:57:47] he did that on purpose
[1:57:50] hallelujah oh my and
[1:57:53] and he constantly do things or say
[1:57:56] things sometimes he'll let the preacher
[1:57:57] say things and you think wow that's
[1:57:59] lord have mercy and god allowed it to be
[1:58:02] said just to see whether you're going to
[1:58:03] stay or not
[1:58:06] you got to press through this battle god
[1:58:08] is looking for tough soldiers
[1:58:11] i can't preach it like i want to preach
[1:58:13] it but i'll tell you what
[1:58:14] it's good to me anyhow we are at the
[1:58:17] brink we had a place where god is
[1:58:19] getting ready to translate to us
[1:58:21] and so i want to say this to you it's
[1:58:23] not by power
[1:58:25] it's not by might but by my spirit
[1:58:28] and don't let the devil make you think
[1:58:30] you curse because you blessed
[1:58:32] the bible said you are if you can read
[1:58:34] this
[1:58:35] and hear this you are blessed
[1:58:39] the world can't hear it they can't see
[1:58:41] it and then god has sent you a messenger
[1:58:44] amen that has taken you up up the ladder
[1:58:47] but now
[1:58:48] the mighty angel is here to take us all
[1:58:50] the way through
[1:58:51] and that's why you feel funny sometimes
[1:58:54] that's why these things are happening
[1:58:55] now
[1:58:56] something's going on in our souls and
[1:58:58] our spirit and you know it
[1:59:00] hallelujah now i know it and i'm saying
[1:59:03] don't quench it let go and let god
[1:59:07] you can't change yourself but he can
[1:59:09] change you because that's what he said
[1:59:10] in joshua
[1:59:11] joshua said you're not going to say
[1:59:12] you're not going to do it
[1:59:15] but people say we're going to do it and
[1:59:17] history shows they did it
[1:59:18] they kept living holy and righteous
[1:59:20] before god even after joshua died
[1:59:24] hallelujah and the most of the thing you
[1:59:26] got to understand is this
[1:59:28] this is what i consider it this is the
[1:59:30] age of abraham
[1:59:32] the unconditional covenant
[1:59:35] hallelujah this is the age of abraham
[1:59:39] god has given us an unconditional
[1:59:41] covenant and he's going to
[1:59:42] make it happen regardless or in spite of
[1:59:46] yourself
[1:59:47] let's stand
[2:00:09] enjoying jesus
