TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I know it's God because I don't like cold weather oh you love the Lord amen Psalm 27 please we're going to finish up tonight we're not going to be long I had no idea I had gone so long this morning uh I just put it this way I I just I was being controlled by God and I couldn't help and it just seemed like there was something just pouring I've been fighting tears all day uh you know I believe with all my heart is going home time Hallelujah and uh you know uh the songs uh we've been singing Just wanting to be so much like him uh I could barely take it but you know I I thank God for being one in the number Hallelujah I really do and I'm I'm just praying that you know uh uh God will do something in our hearts uh first of all we we you know you and I must cut all everything off I know we care about loved ones we prayed and that's all we can do amen because remember that's what happened to miss lot she messed up she turned to look back see you can't do anything God's thoughts are God's thoughts and God will not lose one uh what God is going to do he has already done it amen and we just got to believe that even when it comes comes to our loved ones God will find a place for them but we cannot allow anything to get in our way right now when it comes to God building character in US understand by the grace of God what we're now embracing is not something easy you and I have been faced with so many trials and tests and troubles but think about it you're still in your right mindall cuz there have been times I thought I was about ready to lose mine I'm laughing but it's the truth amen but you know know God still kept me he's kept you amen amen he's kept that desire in you to serve him in spite of all of the trials you're going through think about it in just a moment's time it'll all be over then we'll understand it better by and by hallelujah oh my if you don't feel his presence I don't know what to say to you here this morning Psalm 27 this evening Psalm 27 I was just going to read a few verses and I believe the Holy Spirit wants me to read the entire chapter listen how David starts off the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the light is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemy and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell amen though a host should encamp against me my heart should not fear amen though War should rise against me in this will I be confident amen one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after one thing amen I have desired I'm going to seek after right that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his provision in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing y I will sing praises unto the Lord amen understand David is saying I'll bring sacrifices that mean it's not an easy thing to do right now but I'm going to give it to him anyway Hallelujah here oh Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me with thou sayest seek when thou sayest seek ye seek my my seek my face my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I seek amen hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in Anger thou has been been my help lead me not neither forsake me oh Lord God of my salvation when my father and my mother forsake me then the Lord will take me up woo oh my God if that ain't good I don't know that's one way you know when you're looking at the thing amen you know it's a family Affair amen when your relatives come to forsake you you know God going to take you up there it is teach me thy way oh Lord and Lead Me in a plain path because mine enemies Deliver Me Not Over unto the will of mine enemies for false Witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty this is one of the script this is what I really like I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord Lord in the land of the living you hear what I'm saying he said I had fainted if I had allowed any doubt to get in between my salvation and me if I had only allowed Satan to make me think uh God is Not on my side I'm not worthy to make it if I had only allowed just a little piece of something to break or bring a breach I had fainted I would have fainted because that's my only hope amen that's my only hope that I'll live in the land of the living I don't care what comes my way had I would have fainted y'all hear what I'm saying had I not trusted in the salvation of God that's what I was saying this morning trusting in the Lamb of God for your salvation it ain't got nothing to do with you it's what he's done for youu right wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord Mercy oh Lord hallelujah let us pray father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how and we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you Father for being so good to us there's no words that Express can express my gratitude right now for your love divine toward me and the house of God the family of God Lord I love your people Lord I I so love your people father Lord I I just thank you Father for those you've given me to to be a shepherd of over lord and I'm nobody Lord but I thank you I just get so much joy Lord when I see faces that I can say you have redeemed and they have escaped they've escaped their snares of the devil they they they are now sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Lord I am so grateful Lord to know Lord God that you've allowed us father to be part of your work in this last day Lord and God if we could save others or see others saved we would do so I pray father that you bless each and every heart take away every un uh spirit of unbelief and every Spirit of doubt we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen thank you Father ah if you may be seated would I like to to do just for a moment salvation is so plain and clear to me by the help and Grace of the lord we see how that um God has been gracious to us and uh the more I see it the more uh Joy seems to fill my soul and you can go from Genesis to Revelation and you'll find out that it was always Grace amen it was Grace that God revealed to Abel the lamb it was Grace that God gave Abel the ability and the Revelation so that he could slay the lamb hello somebody it was always Grace there was nothing that Adam and Eve did because God had already placed judgment on them y'all know what I'm saying because if you you got your dos and don'ts still laying there before you Satan will take your does and don'ts and he's going to condemn you with them amen you see what I'm saying there was only one righteous there was only one holy the Bible said no man sought me I sought man y'all hear what I'm saying so if you can just simply trust the Lamb of God if you can trust God for your salvation that is salvation that means that you really believe that he died in your stad not only did he die in your stad but the Bible tell us he went to the region of the law amen for you you were supposed to go there he went there for you right and as we died with him we also rose with him brother bam said as God as he rose we rose with him you got to believe that people for the time that's getting ready to oppress upon you you've got to believe the simple gospel if you don't believe that you won't make it because you're resting upon the arms of your flesh and your flesh will will fail you y'all hear what I'm saying your flesh will fail you it's got to be Faith something that you can't see with your natural eye but you believe that Christ did it all for you amen amen thank you Lord cuz you don't know at the in the time of your your being tested whether you going to slep a little bit or not you don't know that but if you do you're covered y'all hear what I'm saying you're covered amen you're covered by the blood of the Lamb you're covered y'all hear what I'm saying that's I'm trying to get you to see where you got to separate this wicked man yes sir from you amen that inner man is the man that God is interested in he's not interested in this flesh here amen y'all hear what I'm saying amen so you and I must understand that God's grace is with us if we can believe it the word of God C right there he says when the my when the wicked even mine enem enies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and Fa you know every time I think about that I think about how when they came to to rush on Jesus at the Garden of Gethsemane the Bible said they came up and they all fell backwards amen they could not charge him because of the force field that was around him amen they couldn't just grab him and do what they wanted to do he had to surrender and understand you and I will have to surrender in order for them to take us now I said that because really when Jesus Christ said in St John 10:30 and I love this scripture he said I and my father are one I read you a quote this morning where brother brandom said when it comes to the Bible you ought to be able to look into this Bible and said that's me amen amen amenl I I can see myself being like David you know I I can see myself being like Joseph amen I I can see myself come on somebody amen I can see myself being the positive amen and not the negative I'm not the negative and you got to not be the negative amen you got to be the positive that's in the scripture oh my as we spoke this morning on Elijah uh you know one of the things in the message identification the prophet of God said where would you present where would your present Christian experience place you in Elijah's time somebody ought to be jumping out of your seat you know what I'm saying because you've you're already with Elijah amen you on Elijah oh my God Amen you're not you're not over there Amen in denominations over there with the worship Bell you have chosen Elijah's side so the scriptures identifying who you are there was not one person who left Elijah and went over to bail amen they stayed with Elijah amen and God Vindicated their Ministry by sending them the fire you don't have to worry about the fire the fire will be sent am you're going to get exactly what God promised you to get amen you won't have to work up for it it is what it is hallelujah I don't know how it all happens and how God does it but the prophet of God said every word that God spoke has to make material materialize itself every word has to materialize itself Hallelujah and listen you would wouldn't be sitting right here right now had not you been the word amen amen he spoke you amen there's not one individual in here that God knows nothing about he knows everything about you he knows you better than you know yourself you said that's not possible yes it is he proved it to Peter he said Peter you going to deny me Thrice no Lord no Lord he said yes you are amen before the Crow you going to deny me see Peter didn't even know that was in him to do that amen but God saw what was in his heart Hallelujah and he still loved Peter and gave him the key see what I'm saying so you and I must recognize oh this love love love love how the word of God so love of God how rich and pure how marvelous amen it reach Beyond father star goes deeper than the ocean sea come on listen you and I must recognize what God is doing and you know God he says Comfort one another with these things according to first Thessalonians the Lord himself should descend with a shout and the voice of a Archangel amen and the dead in Christ shall rise first and them that remain they shall be what there shall be changed I I started just ra that portion with those that remain cuz that's what it look like we going to be here at the changing of the body Hallelujah if it's as close as I feel it if it's as close as I believe it I believe that you and I will be here at the the changing of the body amen amen the devil that's why he's so mad at us now he mad at you and he I tell you what right now you are the Fanatics you are the you are the odd balls you the kind of people that the devil want to get rid of you're messing up his Eden amen right you're messing up his Eden he don't want righteousness in his Edom he want violence he won't kill he won't destroy he want every Wicked thing in his so-called Eden he's got it he can have it the first the first ticket out of here I'm taking it amen that's right amen you li must Realize by the grace of God he said Comfort these things because why comfort means that if I've got to comfort you there's something that that will bother you or something that will bring you to a place of of Oppression or down you it's it's a Time amen that is not a joyous time so I've got to comfort you amen right he said but I want you to realize he said listen I want you to recognize and you know remember brother brand said like this he said like he said when his wife was all upset and carried on to the kids he said he start talking about heaven amen honey don't you realize one of these old days is going to be all over you know just think about amen our suffering in this world cannot even be compared Amen to the things that God has in store for us oh in a moment's time people think about it you sisters who've had babies amen once that baby is delivered you forget exactly what all that pain was about amen it it's true I don't know how they do it brother amen but when those babies get old a little up up in age they say oh my I feel like having me another one and I'm thinking what know but they forget they forget they see all that bundle of sweetness and joy and life I mean come on you know and I know our children has been a joy to us amen amen amen they get to it sometimes right sisters but you wouldn't trade them for nothing in the world you die for them amen that's exactly right amen oh we look at this thing and and and he says now I want you to take it he says tell me where so you can understand you know your your condition your place and your position right now in in God you're determin that because now you're listening to Elijah's message amen amen amen yeah that identifies who you are amen oh my see what side would you have took then or when Moses brought Israel going down there as as identified Prophet with the word that God promised Abraham see the prophet would take place and Moses went down and done all those signs that God told him to do listen we're going to uh he said brought them children out and got into the Wilderness now listen he says now that's exactly what the Pentecostals did 50 years years ago what did they do they denied amen God bringing them out see they they really sold their birth right to denominationalism and organizational ISM why because in their Ram they had some daans and chorus amen they had those amen who could look at Moses and say hey do you think you're the only one come on somebody they had people with gifts and powers and whatever more going on in their organization so when the real man of God that was sent in our day came they couldn't even recognize that was God Amen that was a trick of the devil he did it in Egypt's day and he's doing it in our day but where are you Hallelujah they can say whatever they want about Elijah I know who he is hallelujah I I know his calling I know why God sent the man Hallelujah and had not God sent him we would be setting right now in Babylon amen we'll be among those who have been judged already weighed in the balance come on found wanting is that right come on somebody you know by the grace it's the truth it's Bishop so and so and Elders so and so and brother so and so look at these men with these what they call them uh um these Ministries uh uh I want to say massive Ministry but that a that ain't what they call them it's a it's it's a term that they uh they give them now and people let me ask you a question in what way do that resemble Jesus broad is the way amen that lead to destruction amen many have follow that way but the Bible said narrow is a way amen that lead to destru uh to life and only a few be that find it now think about it the greater Jesus came the more teaching now while he was preaching while he was Healing The Sick and raising the Dead and all of that he had multitude after multitude but when he began to sit down and teach them the M the the the crowd got narrow 70 ministers left at one time come on somebody amen and now he's just got 12 and he's looking at the 12 and says do you want to leave too in other words God don't need us we need God Amen but he knew the response to that he was just wanting to hear it well we're going to go amen you're the only one that has a words to eternal life search the world search the world all over for this a message greater than this one where are you going to go what you going to do there's nothing greater out there than what we preach Lord it is not a man it's all about Jesus Christ oh my God you think about it now go God is molding character in you amen no matter what they said they said Jesus was born of fornication come on he's be above they said every little negative thing they could say about him but it didn't it didn't it didn't shake the true disciples why because he said my sheep Hearth my thoughts and a stranger they will not follow Hallelujah come on you look at these Great Men of God and you think to yourself why on Earth would people follow them and I don't mean no harm that that one guy that smiles all the time look just like a Jesuit priest he look like come on somebody don't you realize that priest they all look the same they all got that look you can meet them in the street and they don't even have a a priest outfit on and something tells you he's a priest they c a certain look why because what's been molded into them amen y'all hear what I'm saying like a drunker he's a drunk he look like a drunker it's what's molded into them that religious spirit has a hold of them the way they speak the way they carry themselves come on somebody it is what it is am you know that's why Jesus didn't wear all that strange kind of clothes CU he wanted to be just himself you can meet a Pentecostal preacher and you'll know him if you're spiritual enough you know is there something the way he says his words it's just even when he's talking he's preaching I mean it's just something about him that you can pick up that that that's who and what they are well I can usually God give me that but let me put let me move on so what about the bride there's got to be something that gives us away amen hallelujah not just our clothing but the atmosphere there's got to be a different atmosphere about us than everybody else hallelujah hallelujah come on somebody amen it's just something that we bring with us almost like the prophet of God he was down there at that man's house he they were getting ready to go hunting right and he had all of his jeans on and see we don't have to be dressed up to bring forth the atmosphere of Heaven amen hadn't taken a bath in a long time and but by the time he was done we had a soul saved amen the man was 70 something years old amen but see all this bride need is a opening amen you give her opening the light go woo amen it doesn't waste any time and just move in for the kill and and when it's done amen they says man well wasn't that good didn't not our heart burn as they talked to us along the way I mean they don't express themselves but their face the all of their faces shows that there's something different about us that's what the people need to see yes when people come through this door they don't need to see another church they don't need to see another little group of people gathering together when they walk in here even so they be they should be able to feel the love of God pull them right on in right but we've got to have love for one another we've got to create that atmosphere you ought to say before you get to this place Lord God when I come into this place among my brethren I want the atmosphere of love to be around me see it's what you think it's what you speak amen that brings and creates Your Atmosphere that's true hallelujah oh God help us this morning this evening amen he said listen and I want you to I want you to understand some of us are not doing much at least you think you're not amen but those little things that you do for God those are the things that counts and last y'all hear what I'm saying because little becomes much when it's placed in the Master's Hand listen to a quote coming from identific ation here it was brother her name was Florence sharen who was demon sharan's sister amen and she said to brother brandham I fast and fast and Fast and still I can't cast out Devils I said you wasn't he I said you wasn't born to do such your duty is fast amen hallelujah so those of us who's got a gift to fast that's what you've been called for but your fasting is not being wasteful maybe you don't know why you're fasting he said but the holy spirit is working on somebody else out there for that you're fasting and God's working somewhere else on your behalf oh my godall don't ain't that good so you don't have to have a need or desire oh Lord why am I fast you don't even have to know if God put you on it stay on it cuz somebody's working off of that energy amen amen Holy Spirit working on somebody else out there for for that you don't know the place if we've had time we teach those things in Long meanings how if one person's burden like for this one for something over here see it is not for you to know it's him doing it you just submissive to your call always line up with the scripture see if it's right or not see amen that's what he was saying so when God even if it's prayer God got you but in the early morning praying you you're not necessarily praying for yourself somebody needs you amen when God wakes me up in the morning sometimes I can't do nothing but to pray and the first thing I think about is my family maybe my boys out there my daughters somebody's doing something they ain't got no business Lord but whatever it is you protect them yes amen y'all ever feel like that amen oh that's what God does he does it for you and sometime it's for people that you don't even know but they're part of the family is that right amen I remember I forgot what what city it was brother Ram had such a powerful meeting and he said that meeting would have never been powerful had it not been for the Sisters fasting and praying behind the curtain see so we've got a body this is a body people that's right amen whether it's for these here or those there it doesn't matter as long as somebody get in the hell amen hallelujah glory to God hallelujah this is Psalm 23 is such a powerful song and many times you know we've seen this song uh quoted and and and in in in in in movies and we didn't I I personally didn't even see the power of God in this thing like I like I do now but you many times when it came to somebody being Exorcist or something they always would read this scripture and you know because even the Hollywood know how powerful and sound it is the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want you see what I'm saying amen let's turn there quickly Psalm 23 you love the Lord amen so I I want you to understand that you and I must be submissive to our call if God got you singing you sing maybe that's all that God wants you to do amen God wants you to help other people you know and stuff like that I think about I hope you don't mind me calling his name brother Marsha different ones sister Vanda different ones and a many of you do the same you help each other but he go find little things and I think about the little gift that he gave the other day day amen and they were so thrill happy about that gift but God predestinated it that was supposed to go to the other individual I mean that's the way God does it these little simple things that you think is not important that's what you've been called to do as long as you do it without grudging and complaining and murmuring it you letting the love of God flow through you amen H calling somebody up for a dinner because the Holy Spirit put them on your heart calling them up for a coffee or whatever you don't even realize you're being led by the spirit cuz you know a lot of time we think when we led by the spirit we got to hear Thunderbolt and something clapping that's just not it it's so simple it's so simple like like you packing your lunch with a few fish and loaves of bread thinking you going to eat it today like that little boy he didn't know he was taking it to the to the to the church for everybody eat his meal but he took that little fish those fish and loads of bread and he took it and here God had need of it and he wasn't grudging he gave it freely freely given amen so you got to realize amen that when God works with you just do what he says amen the truth you know I it's the truth I saw a man on the corner and I was going to give him what I think $20 or $10 whatever it was but I had one of my bills stuck to it I only meant to give him 10 whatever it was he got a double portion and it was way up the road I realized the man got all my money but then I didn't get upset I said well Lord you knew what he needed more than what I need you know what I'm saying he needed it more so and I was happy that God took took my will away from me and made his will yeah oh I had to laugh I did I laughed I said God you awesome you know God to put something on your heart and you like you know well maybe maybe you know you peel it down and God said not today you giving it all oh thank you Jesus amen the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Steel Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake yes they do I walk through listen let's back it up he leadth me in the path of righteousness for your sake no no no his name's sake his name's sake his name's sake that's why we are being led in the path of righteousness because you and I Embraces and carry his name amen it is for his name sake amen that you won't bring a reproach on his name he leads you and guid you into that place woo woo than he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the path of righteousness for his name say yay though I walk through the valley in the shadow of death I will feel no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy stth they comfort me brother bam said even then he said listen like this he said that shadow he said you have to have light in order to have a shadow so it ain't as dark as you think it is hallelujah come on somebody he said I lead you through there amen is oh my goodness listen how can it be dark that kind of darkness is Jesus with God is with you if the pill of fire is there if the light of God is there wherever it takes you I don't care if it's pitch black shadow is going to be there Amen in the time of trouble he shall hide me oh I love that he shall hide me in his Pavilion now I want you to realize by grace of God because I'm saying all of these things so that you be encouraged Lord work on me don't Stop building me don't stop making me mow me break me use me make me we saying that and we ought to give our heart to that so when he's doing it don't you know you know sometime you can't help but make a little sound but try to have some Joy try to have that peace in your heart to know that God is working on you but you see what the devil says no you cursed and you you you this is what's happening to you because of what you've done and and and see he's a liar he's way off the scripture if God had judged us like that he would have never brought us in the Bible said in that while you were yet a sinner Christ died for you y'all hear what I'm saying so he loved you even when you was a sinner he protected you from the bullet he protected you from the C he protected you from being dead right now now if he protected you then don't you think he's going to protect you now his whole desire is to see you molded and made I'm telling you people all I know is it it this is I have no other desire this is my heart desire every day every day I don't care yes I am battled every day but in all of that God knows this that I have one desire and that's to be just like it amen hallelujah and when I find that I haven't I missed him just a little bit on the day I make sure I correct it am I get before him and says Lord clean it up yes sir have mercy upon me clean it up I just made a mess of things just now anybody know what I'm talking about it is what we do as Christians that's what that's what makes you know you're a Christian if you confess before him something in you making you confess serpent seed can't do it I'm telling you Cain you go do what your brother rather do he couldn't do it he had rather walk out of the presence of God than to make it right but when you can make it right I don't care how hard it is you have the ability to make it right that means you're you're not of the devil the devil can't do that amen your your little crust might be thicker than mine or mine might be thicker than yours but God got a way of hammering it out amen literally breaking it listen here we are how can I say it you are being Vindicated right now on who you are Elijah's message being preached you receiving it and saying amen it is vindicating to you who you are right amen because understand you're not saying it just just as as some uh Rhythm type thing you're saying it cuz out of your heart comes you don't even think I'm going to say Amen it comes up amen right because it shows that it's in your heart it's in your heart amen Lord amen you love the Lord now listen how how how awesome this is and we find out that this that even in our day that's why you have to believe things that doesn't sound sound are the things that God work with you say have sound Doctrine a virgin shall conceive it's sound because God's word says it right but where in Earth if if you have been back there when Isaiah spoke it you would have said surely I've seen Isaiah preach or Minister many times but he just missed it folks he just missed it because he just said to us that a virgin shall conceive unheard it can't happen now realiz realize this amen for the Jewish people who are very intellectual who are very intelligent people to believe that a virgin shall conceive Joseph said I'm killing her in the morning God said no you're not I mean he was a righteous man he was a righteous man but he himself could not believe Mary's report and God had to come and talk to Joseph he had to have a supernatural visitation from God his friends couldn't convince him nor otherwise amen he had to have God come down and says listen Joseph this thing that being in her is of the Holy Ghost y'all hear what I'm saying and then God had to come that wasn't just Joseph amen what Eli um John's daddy can't his name he he couldn't believe it either Zachariah he couldn't believe amen what what uh Elizabeth said and God come and smite the man says listen you'll be dumb because you won't believe we're talking about holy and righteous people who could not believe the visitation from the angel but look at you God didn't have to Smite you but he come down and he he and you wasn't even there Hallelujah and blessed is a man who have not seen But and believe Hallelujah God come down and he's bringing you the word of God and he's telling you how blessed you are you think about it was it Phillip uh was it uh Nathaniel uh uh whom there was no God and he says Thou Art truly the Messiah he said you believe me that I'm the Messiah because I said here's a man that has no God he's not a liar or a thief or anything he said blessed are you because you're going to see greater things amen huh amen oh I saw you when you was up in the tree come on somebody God didn't he didn't even come to us we weren't there when he was calling out people out in the line but we heard it we know it's real something echoed in our hearts and our soul and say it's real amen and because you believe it you you had an ear to hear it vindicates you a sheep Amen Hallelujah Lord none of us are smart if we were we wouldn't need the Bible but we're smart enough to know we need the Bible Hallelujah is that all right now let me let me move on just a minute because I don't want to be long because we got communion but the acts you know I I going read something here he says listen he said his last identification or we find in Hell crying for Lazarus to come bring him some water or your identification could you be identified with the group that Judas was in he started to walk with Jesus he started out all right like the Pentecostals did years ago but the very thing that they come out of the organization your mothers and your fathers this young group had turned right back and made them one just like they come out of see what what type group are you with now the Bible said that the L C Church AE Judas you know carried he saw the possibility of getting something great with what he had Now understand this why he called him Judas because really am mean one of the reasons is because it is the organizations that have turned turned against this message they are the ones who can identify us amen hello somebody they are the ones who goes and tells the the upper uh uh group of people hey these branhamites are in the city we're not branhamites we belong to Jesus Christ amen hallelujah hallelujah y'all understand me amen you said why would you say that because listen either brother bram's right or he's wrong he asked the angel he said are all these Brams he said no these are converts to Jesus Christ amen if the angel would have said yes then I would be bromite but he said no all of these are converts to Jesus Christ so I belong to Jesus Christ amen amen so he thought with that he carried that bag and he could make some extra money by selling him for 30 pieces of silver that's exactly what Leo Dean Church age did you rich you you say I increased and have plenty goods and I have need of nothing and you don't know that you're wretched miserable blind and naked is this amazing it is amazing that Satan it is the richest that people out listen here it was amen Aaron said give me your gold give me all your glitter things and we going to make us a calf it was always something of merchandise exchange for their souls something has changed for the soul and listen nothing nothing is more important than your soul amen hallelujah I'm almost done with this portion so I want you to realize amen God is doing something that's powerful right now let him do it you say oh well brother Brooks you know I don't listen when I got saved I lost all my friends that was denominational all of them right all even people who I led to the Lord didn't want to have nothing to do with me especially when I came to this message hello somebody but let me say it like this none of them could feel the place that had been void but now filled amen see none of them could make me I've been around with them partied with them did what they were supposed to do with them amen but listen when Jesus came into my life nobody could feel that and there's no there's no such a trade amen there's not a trade for this Hallelujah I'm gracious to get it but there's no trading my salvation for your friendship it ain't happening I I I just kind of put this on card on the camera something that I was talking about this morning this is coming from amen the message identification as well I misquoted I said this morning man can turn on light but he brings that out a little family went down one time and the little boy was walking with it with the guide and the guide went over all at once and just flipped the light and the little girl began to scream she was scared that's about the little that's about like the

Bram is doing something's moving in this man's life and when I caught this by the grace of God I saw me I saw you amen that we get to a place amen things going to change here now he's praying for people right and he says you believe me to be a servant will you accept me as God's servant then I deliver deler you from that amen I deliver you from that in the name of Jesus Christ amen and you believe sir and give your heart to Christ see the ministers about baptism and the thing over o and the things over you you just believe you just believe amen amen whatsoever you say Amen in the name of Jesus whatsoever you say is that right so the bride comes into a place where she has the authority is Christ in her now amen amen it's Christ speaking through her right thinking through her talking through her walking through her she's dead amen at this point brother brandham is dead amen and God is speaking through him we're not talking about human flesh right now we're talking about the God in the man amen I deliver you amen hallelujah here he says our Authority is Jesus Christ and I'm going to have them come down here and pray with me he said our Authority is Jesus Christ who give you the right what school you went to I went to the school of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah amen he's the one that's bringing us amen and building our characterall think about it you can't bring back yesterday it's dead and gone can I put it this way even the time you walk in here is already in the past amen there's nothing you could change about it it's gone but right now amen that's why the Bible say forgetting those things that are behind it's gone you know don't even worry about it even how you felt 15 20 minutes ago it's gone don't even dwell on it that's pass Hallelujah right now we working with present amen and I want you to understand by the grace of God that there is nothing you can change about what you did yesterday amen it's finished it's finished and my point is do you think at any point that God didn't know and see you doing the things you did whether they were good or bad amen now think about it and he still loves you let me tell you something I had a old mother let me tell you what she had the love of God in her and I expect to see her there y'all hear what I'm saying when day my mother said something to me and I'm going to tell you what I I won't tell you what I did it was really bad and my mother by Revelation from the Holy Ghost came to me and she said Junior you know the Lord don't like when you do so and so and so and so and me and my little inocent eyes I caught her eyes and said mama you know I would never do such a thing as that hey y'all better believe it I got some children if you didn't see them they can convince you they didn't do it you saw them take it and they said I didn't take it so when I see that I always think about what I did to my mama but I wasn't lying to my mama I was lying to God it was just the grace of God lightning didn't come from somewhere and take me out but he had a purpose for me but my point is this thing that my mama saw me do was wicked and she loved me anyway she didn't she saw me it had to be by Vision it had to be my vision you know what I'm saying but she loved me anyway now let's put it on the level of God and how many times he told us not to do it and we did it anyhow amen and he still love you and nothing can change his love for you amen no devil can trip you up enough to change it nobody can falsify your records cuz he got that in heaven amen hallelujah oh my people if you can realize this thing is so sweet to me it like I I want almost Rush this thing I want to rush it you know I want to rush this thing and says Lord please let it happen now you know but God still got to work on us he still got things to do within us am and I know it's going to be such a perfect time but let me tell you something we're getting ready to do communion you ought to thank God that he's allowed you to be partakers of his communion a lot of us don't even realize how important any is he told Peter he said if you don't wash each other's feet you won't have nothing to do with me and people said well you know feet washing is not necessary it is necessary am huh but you don't have to take communion oh see that's what people don't understand whether you understand the reason why we ought to he said do iten till I come and that's why we do it because he say do it amen right and I'm going to tell you something really we don't do it as much as he say amen he said we ought to do it as much as we come together as often as we come together you know what it does it keeps the devil out of your lives if you really really sincere about communion it'll keep your mind right it'll keep your heart and spirit right especially when it comes to your brothers and sisters you love God Amen let's St we like to pray here precious father God what can we say I am so stirred in my heart my flesh is weary
