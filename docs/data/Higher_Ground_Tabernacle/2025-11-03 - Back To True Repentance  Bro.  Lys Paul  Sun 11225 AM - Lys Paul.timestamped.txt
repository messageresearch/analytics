[56:43] You may have your seat for a moment.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Um, I was supposed to sing a song.
[56:52] I I've always heard people saying that,
[56:54] but since it was in Chiluba, I didn't
[56:56] really understand the song.
[57:00] The last time I was in Kentucky, I think
[57:02] someone sang that in Chiluba and they
[57:04] had the English English translation.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; And I really love the lyrics of that
[57:12] song.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; I didn't have time to add the English
[57:18] version, but so forgive me for that. And
[57:21] I believe
[57:23] cuz I asked the musician yesterday to
[57:25] practice the song
[57:27] &gt;&gt; cuz God just put that song on my heart.
[57:31] And they're telling me that they also
[57:33] had practiced that already because
[57:34] someone else was supposed to sing that
[57:35] to me.
[57:38] So I like when God moves like that. So
[57:40] Diego, can you help me sing
[57:43] &gt;&gt; just because I don't really I don't want
[57:45] to pronounce things the wrong way, but

[1:03:14] I think chilobo means almighty,
[1:03:17] right? You know, I love songs that
[1:03:19] magnify Jesus, you know. Jesus is the
[1:03:22] almighty, you know, and then I think it
[1:03:25] means big a big god, you know. He's he's
[1:03:28] all big. He's he's grand you know of all
[1:03:34] the gods
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; not just of he's the he's bigger than
[1:03:38] even your problems
[1:03:41] you know anything you name my god is
[1:03:43] bigger than that you know and what I
[1:03:46] love the most I think is the last verse
[1:03:48] that says the god to call in the time of
[1:03:51] trouble
[1:03:55] remember whenever you get in trouble
[1:03:56] call on god
[1:03:58] I don't really know If I know the second
[1:04:00] line,
[1:04:03] what does that mean?
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; You know, you call him toenge.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; You ch you have to challenge God. Is
[1:04:10] that what he says?
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Okay. When there's a challenge, you call
[1:04:16] on God.
[1:04:19] And even if the battle rages on, to him
[1:04:23] it is light.
[1:04:26] That's the God of the message of the
[1:04:27] hour. You may stand to your feet. Thank
[1:04:30] you. Thank you, Diego, for the song.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; I always get very nervous when I get up
[1:04:37] here. I'm shaking if you can see that.
[1:04:40] But I pray that God will help me.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; So, let's turn to Acts chapter 2,
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; verse 37.
[1:04:59] The Bible says,
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; "Now when they were Now when they heard
[1:05:05] this, they were pricricked in their
[1:05:06] hearts
[1:05:10] and said unto Peter and to the rest of
[1:05:12] the apostles,
[1:05:15] men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[1:05:19] Then Peter said unto them, Repent,
[1:05:23] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:05:25] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:05:27] of sins and you shall receive the gift
[1:05:30] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:05:36] For the promise is unto you and to your
[1:05:38] children and to all that are a far off,
[1:05:40] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[1:05:43] call.
[1:05:49] So the promise is yours. You just have
[1:05:51] to take it. Let's go to Malachi chapter
[1:05:53] 4 verse 5-6.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Chapter 4 vers 5-6.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Behold, I will send you Elijah the
[1:06:06] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:06:09] and dreadful day of the Lord.
[1:06:15] And he shall turn the hearts of the
[1:06:17] fathers to the children, and the hearts
[1:06:19] of the children to their fathers. Lest I
[1:06:22] come and smite the earth with a curse.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our head. If you have any just
[1:06:32] raise your hands to the Lord.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, you are the
[1:06:37] great Chilobo, the great almighty.
[1:06:41] And heavenly father, Lord, you created
[1:06:43] everything that exists.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we are the works of your
[1:06:47] creation as well.
[1:06:49] We bow ourselves before you Lord.
[1:06:52] Heavenly father Lord in the name of
[1:06:53] Jesus Christ. Lord we thank you for
[1:06:56] giving us uh strength to come into your
[1:06:58] house this morning.
[1:07:01] And heavenly father Lord you promised us
[1:07:02] in your word that wherever two or three
[1:07:04] are gathered in your name, you shall be
[1:07:06] in the midst of them.
[1:07:09] Lord, we thank you for your promise and
[1:07:10] we believe that you are here. Lord,
[1:07:14] I pray that you forgive us of our
[1:07:16] shortcomings
[1:07:18] and that heavenly father, Lord, you may
[1:07:19] have the preminence throughout the whole
[1:07:20] service.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray that you take control of
[1:07:25] everybody starting from me to the to the
[1:07:27] back of the church, Lord Jesus.
[1:07:30] And anything that doesn't confess your
[1:07:32] name, we rebuke it in the name of Jesus
[1:07:34] Christ.
[1:07:36] Heavenly Father, Lord, your children
[1:07:37] raise their hands and they have needs
[1:07:39] and requests.
[1:07:41] You know them all, Father.
[1:07:43] I pray, Lord, that you answer. You give
[1:07:45] them what their hearts desire
[1:07:48] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord God, I surrender
[1:07:52] myself to you. I surrender this vessel,
[1:07:55] my heart, my soul, my mind, my mouth,
[1:07:58] everything. Lord Jesus, bless the
[1:08:01] reading of your word and anoint the
[1:08:03] preaching.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray.
[1:08:08] Amen.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats.
[1:08:13] My title for today will be
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; back to true repentance.
[1:08:22] And I was supposed to continue my series
[1:08:24] on what is the message of the hour.
[1:08:29] But somehow just yesterday when I was
[1:08:30] studying, I just wasn't feeling it.
[1:08:35] It just felt like I was forcing
[1:08:37] something.
[1:08:39] And then I was like, "Okay, maybe let me
[1:08:41] try to see if I have another sermon."
[1:08:42] And I went into another sermon. I still
[1:08:44] couldn't feel it.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; I almost called one of the ministers
[1:08:51] very late at night to just ask, "Hey, if
[1:08:53] they can just preach today because I
[1:08:54] just wasn't feeling it."
[1:08:58] Because I don't like the way I prepare.
[1:08:59] I don't like forcing things,
[1:09:02] you know? Usually when God usually all
[1:09:05] my sermons, God God just gives me all
[1:09:07] the scriptures and all the quotes.
[1:09:12] It's like I can be praying and while I'm
[1:09:14] praying I just start preaching
[1:09:18] or I just like you have one scripture
[1:09:21] and then there are other scripture just
[1:09:23] uh just compulate till it becomes a
[1:09:26] whole sermon. But somehow those those
[1:09:29] ones I was just having difficulty coming
[1:09:31] up with a sermony
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; and I decided to scroll through all my
[1:09:37] notes.
[1:09:39] and I saw this title back to true
[1:09:41] repentance.
[1:09:43] It wasn't fully developed,
[1:09:46] but then it just seems like I was at
[1:09:48] ease in this sermon. So, I believe that
[1:09:52] maybe God has this for us today
[1:09:55] and we trust he's going to bless.
[1:09:58] So, we just read
[1:10:01] Malachi chapter 4 5-6
[1:10:05] and we also read the book of Acts
[1:10:07] chapter 2.
[1:10:10] It tells us that
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; before the [clears throat] dreadful day
[1:10:14] of the Lord that I will send you Elijah
[1:10:16] the prophets.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; So we have a promise that God promised
[1:10:21] to send us the prophet Elijah.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; But what is his mission? His mission is
[1:10:28] to turn the heart of the children to
[1:10:30] their fathers.
[1:10:34] So in other words, it's to turn our
[1:10:36] hearts to the condition that our fathers
[1:10:38] in Acts chapter 2 had.
[1:10:44] Is to work on the hearts of the
[1:10:46] believers to get back to Acts chapter 2
[1:10:52] because the prophet tells us that that
[1:10:53] they were our fathers.
[1:10:56] That's where Christianity was born.
[1:11:00] When they received the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:03] The prophet says that when you don't
[1:11:05] have the you're not even a true
[1:11:06] Christian, you're not fully converted
[1:11:08] until you receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:13] So Malachi 4 is telling us according to
[1:11:15] William Brham that he's supposed to take
[1:11:17] us back to Act chapter 2.
[1:11:22] Why was what was happening in chapter 2
[1:11:24] of Acts?
[1:11:26] The preaching of the word was p piercing
[1:11:29] the hearts of men.
[1:11:33] The preaching of the word was causing
[1:11:35] people to repentance.
[1:11:39] They did not need to be babyed around.
[1:11:43] But they did not even they didn't even
[1:11:44] need to call for an altar call.
[1:11:48] The word convicted their hearts so much
[1:11:52] that the Bible says that when they heard
[1:11:54] these things they were pricricked in
[1:11:55] their hearts.
[1:11:58] So what is what is the mission of
[1:11:59] Malachi 4 is to take the believers to
[1:12:01] the position where the the word can
[1:12:03] penetrate your heart
[1:12:07] where the word can break your heart
[1:12:12] because what uh no let me not jump ahead
[1:12:15] of me.
[1:12:18] to take us back to that that key word in
[1:12:22] their hearts.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; I I believe many of us are baptized
[1:12:30] today.
[1:22:59] their hearts.
[1:23:02] And yet we say we believe the message of
[1:23:04] the hour.
[1:23:07] That's not the the same message that I
[1:23:08] READ
[1:23:10] UNLESS if you point me to another
[1:23:12] message.
[1:23:15] But the prophetly
[1:23:18] uh uh sorrow for repentance
[1:23:25] the prophet says I don't even believe
[1:23:26] that you can come to the altar to be
[1:23:28] prayed for with seen
[1:23:35] we we we want to see the move of God in
[1:23:37] this church
[1:23:39] because I know that once God promises
[1:23:41] one thing IT HAS TO HAPPEN. I DON'T KNOW
[1:23:45] ABOUT YOU, BUT I believe that with all
[1:23:46] my heart.
[1:23:48] So if I don't see the move of GOD IN
[1:23:50] THIS CHURCH,
[1:23:52] THEN SOMETHING IS WRONG SOMEWHERE. If I
[1:23:54] don't see the move of God in my life,
[1:23:57] THEN SOMETHING IS WRONG SOMEWHERE.
[1:24:00] Then we need to BE LIKE JOSHUA AND CALL
[1:24:03] FOR THE assembly of the saints.
[1:24:06] LET'S EXAMINE EACH HOUSE.
[1:24:09] WHAT IS WRONG IN THIS CHURCH THIS
[1:24:11] MORNING? LIKE JOSHUA, let's examine each
[1:24:14] and every one OF OUR LIVES.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; THERE must be sin in the camp somewhere.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; You know, I have all these quotes here.
[1:24:22] The prophet Am I am I ready? If I'm just
[1:24:24] skipping, but the prophet says that if
[1:24:27] you have if you don't confess your sins,
[1:24:30] you can't even hinder someone else from
[1:24:32] being healed.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; People can come to the altar, they are
[1:24:38] prayed for, BUT THEY CANNOT BE HEALED.
[1:24:42] BECAUSE OF YOU. So you are selfish.
[1:24:48] You are selfish.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; If you if you don't want to get anywhere
[1:24:53] with God, then stop coming to church.
[1:25:00] Because if you because God can only work
[1:25:02] with you if you also desire him.
[1:25:06] If you also have a desire for GOD IN
[1:25:07] YOU.
[1:25:09] THIS CHURCH IS NOT A PICNIC.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T COME TO CHURCH to see each
[1:25:13] other.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; I come to church to to have an
[1:25:17] experience with God.
[1:25:20] I I I don't I I don't know about you,
[1:25:22] but I refuse to believe a message that
[1:25:24] doesn't have an impact in MY LIFE
[1:25:28] because then I'll just I'll rather just
[1:25:30] go to OTHER CHURCHES. I'LL JUST GO TO
[1:25:32] THE METHODIST CHURCH, THE BAPTIST
[1:25:35] CHURCH. SO WHY ARE YOU COMING HERE? WHY
[1:25:38] DO YOU HAVE TO WEAR DRESSES?
[1:25:43] You're wearing all these dress and now
[1:25:44] at school everybody has to look at you
[1:25:45] as this weird person wearing dresses.
[1:25:53] Amen. Amen.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; I don't just want to wear a dress if I
[1:25:56] don't see the move of God in my life.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; I don't just want to not smoke if I
[1:26:04] don't see the move of God in my life.
[1:26:08] The Bible says these signs shall follow
[1:26:11] the believer,
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; not the believer following the signs,
[1:26:16] but these signs shall follow the
[1:26:17] believer.
[1:26:19] So somehow
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; you know sometimes you even hear
[1:26:24] brothers
[1:26:25] saying certain things like there are
[1:26:27] certain things I believe only brother
[1:26:28] Brandham
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; certain things only brother Brandham
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; or even or even like some people don't
[1:26:36] even believe in angels appearing to
[1:26:38] people
[1:26:40] to be brother Brandham
[1:26:42] but brother Brandham preached that
[1:26:44] angels can appear to you if you are very
[1:26:46] consecrated WITH GOD
[1:26:50] SOME PEOPLE DON'T EVEN BELIEVE in
[1:26:52] hearing the audible voice of God
[1:26:55] that only brother
[1:26:58] that's not the message that we heard
[1:27:02] that's putting God in a box
[1:27:05] so what if God comes and want that speak
[1:27:07] to you through an audible voice
[1:27:11] you're going to say no that's not you
[1:27:12] only Brother,
[1:27:20] when the angel came down on earth on
[1:27:22] Revelation chapter 10,
[1:27:29] what did he do? He puts the hand the
[1:27:31] book in the hands of the bride.
[1:27:36] The book didn't just stay in the hand of
[1:27:38] brother Brandham.
[1:27:41] It came in the hand of the bride.
[1:27:44] What is that book? It gives you the
[1:27:46] legal authority of the word.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; So if you have the authority of the
[1:27:51] word, then you have the same authority
[1:27:53] that brother Brandham had because who is
[1:27:56] greater? Is brother Brandham greater
[1:27:58] THAN THE WORD?
[1:28:00] THE WORD IS above the prophets.
[1:28:04] Brother Brandham says there's a
[1:28:05] difference between Jesus and Adi THE
[1:28:07] PROPHETS.
[1:28:10] BROTHER SAYS THAT Jesus was the word
[1:28:14] but we PROPHETS THE WORD COME to us.
[1:28:17] HE SAYS WE ARE not the word but the word
[1:28:21] comes to us.
[1:28:25] You need to know who you are.
[1:28:29] [applause]
[1:28:30] You are not just a nobody. God still
[1:28:32] speaks through an audible voice. He may
[1:28:34] not He has never done that to me. But
[1:28:36] I'm not going to put him IN A BOX.
[1:28:40] I WANT THE SAME God of Malachi 4
[1:28:45] to also be in action in my life.
[1:28:48] And if he's not there, it's either two
[1:28:50] things. It's either this message is
[1:28:52] false or something is wrong with your
[1:28:55] experience.
[1:28:58] But God already vindicated this message.
[1:29:02] We know this message is the truth.
[1:29:07] You know how so their faith was based on
[1:29:09] repentance.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; You know that's the first first step to
[1:29:16] repentance is a godly sorrow for the sin
[1:29:18] committed.
[1:29:21] So you need to be sorry about what you
[1:29:22] committed.
[1:29:26] Don't raise your hand but how many here
[1:29:28] I've been seeking for the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:31] You have been baptized. You try to pray
[1:29:33] and everything.
[1:29:35] But why don't you have the Holy Ghost?
[1:29:39] I believe I have that quote to you. Let
[1:29:40] me just read it real quick cuz sometime
[1:29:43] it's better if I just read from the
[1:29:44] prophets than saying that myself.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Okay. It's in a message. He cares. Do
[1:30:03] you care?
[1:30:06] The prophet says, "When you thoroughly
[1:30:08] repent and believe on the Lord
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; and are baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:30:16] Christ,
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; you make God a liar if you don't receive
[1:30:20] the Holy Ghost."
[1:30:26] That's the prophet.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; But he says the key word is when you
[1:30:29] thoroughly repent.
[1:30:32] What is a thorough repentance? It's in a
[1:30:35] sincere deep repentance.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; What is that repentance? It's the
[1:30:41] repentance that pricks the heart.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; You know, make wanting to make things
[1:30:47] right. So the first step to repentance,
[1:30:51] you have to be sorry for the sin that
[1:30:53] you committed.
[1:30:58] You did something and you are very like
[1:31:01] you know to be prick in your heart you
[1:31:03] take a knife here someone heart I don't
[1:31:07] know has someone ever hurt you so much
[1:31:09] that your heart you feel like something
[1:31:12] your heart
[1:31:15] that's how you should feel when you
[1:31:16] commit sin
[1:31:19] according to Acts chapter 2
[1:31:23] that's the first step get to that stage
[1:31:25] age first
[1:31:27] where you are convicted in your heart.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Then there are two things.
[1:31:37] If you hurt someone or you did something
[1:31:39] wrong against someone
[1:31:43] you have to make it right with that
[1:31:44] person first.
[1:31:52] If you have someone that you you have
[1:31:55] you don't speak to you have you are
[1:31:56] enemy with someone
[1:32:00] you see that person and you don't greet
[1:32:02] them
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; purposely
[1:32:07] you will not get anywhere well with God
[1:32:12] let me even tell you you are wasting
[1:32:15] time even praying
[1:32:20] you are wasting your
[1:32:24] So that 30 minutes or actually maybe
[1:32:27] five minutes that you end you spend
[1:32:28] praying
[1:32:33] you know maybe just go and do your own
[1:32:35] thing because you are actually wasting
[1:32:36] your time. I read you the quotes. The
[1:32:39] prophet says you are wasting your time.
[1:32:43] Like I said we we have to re you know
[1:32:45] when something is wrong go to the
[1:32:47] source.
[1:32:49] The prophet says when something is
[1:32:50] wrong, you have to first diagnose what
[1:32:52] what is the cause of it.
[1:32:55] That's what we're doing this morning.
[1:32:56] I'm sorry. I don't mean to be hurtful.
[1:32:59] This is speaking to me too.
[1:33:03] If you have an art against someone,
[1:33:08] you are wasting your time praying.
[1:33:13] Even when we are here singing,
[1:33:17] your hand raised doesn't mean anything
[1:33:19] to God.
[1:33:21] He doesn't even see your hand.
[1:33:24] So why are you even here if God is not
[1:33:25] even
[1:33:28] you know the prophet says that God told
[1:33:29] them that when people came to the altar
[1:33:33] he told them that make them confess
[1:33:35] everything they have done first before
[1:33:37] they come.
[1:33:39] Let me let me read that quote first. Let
[1:33:42] me see. Um, he cares. Do you care?
[1:33:45] Paragraph 63. So, if you go to paragraph
[1:33:47] 63, the prophet says,
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; I think one of the things that keeps our
[1:33:52] people from being healed is the lack of
[1:33:54] confession.
[1:33:58] Is the lack of sincere confession.
[1:34:03] He says, now for instance, this sound
[1:34:05] this might sound a little bad,
[1:34:08] but I don't mean it in this way.
[1:34:11] look looking at my wife sitting here.
[1:34:15] If I'll go out here today and throw my
[1:34:17] arms around some other woman
[1:34:21] and make love to her
[1:34:24] and I was wrong.
[1:34:27] Of course, my confidence will keep me
[1:34:28] from doing that.
[1:34:32] But if it happened that I did or
[1:34:34] anything similar to it
[1:34:37] and then I know the first thing is to
[1:34:39] say to my wife before I can say to God
[1:34:41] forgive me
[1:34:44] because I sinned against her.
[1:34:49] So if you have sinned against someone
[1:34:52] before you give even go to God and ask
[1:34:54] God to forgive you
[1:34:57] go repair with that person first.
[1:35:00] And if you come to the altar
[1:35:04] and remember you have ought
[1:35:07] make that right first
[1:35:10] before you offer your gift.
[1:35:14] So I've got to go to her.
[1:35:17] I've got to go to her.
[1:35:19] I believe in confession is straightening
[1:35:22] up also. It isn't. So it isn't true
[1:35:24] confession unless it is
[1:35:31] So if you don't to if you don't
[1:35:33] straighten up your life, you don't go
[1:35:35] repair all the damages that you've
[1:35:37] caused.
[1:35:40] According to the prophets, you have not
[1:35:43] repented. You have not confessed, right?
[1:35:47] He won't even call it a confession.
[1:35:51] WHAT if I say
[1:35:53] I'm going to confess it that I done
[1:35:55] wrong?
[1:35:57] I said, "Good Lord." Oh, friend of mine.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; You know that I know you real well.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; I think you're a good old fellow.
[1:36:08] Forgive me.
[1:36:11] I didn't mean it that way.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Now you say that's sacrilegious.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; To make a confession like that.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; You don't go to God as if like you
[1:36:24] didn't even didn't even do anything.
[1:36:28] Oh God, I love you. You are my Lord. You
[1:36:30] are my friend. You know, I didn't mean
[1:36:33] to just forgive me like that.
[1:36:36] The prophet says, that's not how you go
[1:36:37] ask.
[1:36:39] And he takes it even further. He says,
[1:36:42] but what if I go say, Lord, I didn't
[1:36:46] mean to do it just that way, and you
[1:36:49] help me and I won't do it again.
[1:36:52] He will refuse my sacrifice.
[1:36:56] until I first go
[1:36:59] and make that right with my wife.
[1:37:04] I believe we are all message believers
[1:37:05] this morning.
[1:37:08] And you are reading the prophet and I
[1:37:10] trust that you go apply that in your
[1:37:11] life.
[1:37:13] He's saying that God will refuse your
[1:37:15] sacrifice
[1:37:17] unless you go make that right with your
[1:37:19] wife.
[1:37:22] But also now you go to make it right
[1:37:24] with your wife.
[1:37:26] But look at the attitude in which you
[1:37:28] are going to make it rightitude.
[1:37:31] Then what if I come to her with the same
[1:37:33] irreverence
[1:37:36] and say
[1:37:38] irreverence and say say old girl old
[1:37:40] friend of mine old mother of my children
[1:37:44] old sweetheart
[1:37:45] you know we've been old charms for a
[1:37:47] long time.
[1:37:50] What if I put my arms around another
[1:37:51] woman?
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; So you So you start by, you know, not
[1:37:58] making making it seem as if it's yours
[1:38:00] first.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, sweetheart, what would you do if
[1:38:06] actually if I cheated on you? Because
[1:38:10] you want to first see her reaction,
[1:38:13] you know.
[1:38:16] Was where was I?
[1:38:19] Yeah. So I imagine how she'll look.
[1:38:22] She'll think what's happened to my
[1:38:23] husband.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 69.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; And you don't go that way to make a
[1:38:29] confession to your fellow man or God.
[1:38:34] So if I do something wrong to someone, I
[1:38:36] don't just go,
[1:38:41] you know, there's a thing with my
[1:38:43] siblings.
[1:38:45] Sometimes when we we hurt each other,
[1:38:49] because of pride.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Even when you go confess to your sibling
[1:38:54] to ask to forgive you,
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; I won't mention no names, but I just
[1:39:01] know sometimes they'll come to the room,
[1:39:04] they just open a room, they're like,
[1:39:06] "Uh, you know what happened yesterday?
[1:39:08] Forgive me." And they close the door and
[1:39:10] then
[1:39:14] that's not true confession.
[1:39:16] No,
[1:39:18] actually I believe through confession
[1:39:19] you sit with the person
[1:39:22] and you you you show remorse.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; You know, yesterday I really didn't mean
[1:39:29] to do it.
[1:39:31] But I did it. Would you forgive me?
[1:39:34] You don't close the door and you leave
[1:39:36] it because you know too much pride.
[1:39:40] I mean, I'm guilty of that. I've done
[1:39:41] that, too.
[1:39:44] But the message is here to to to make
[1:39:46] sure we do things the right way. And
[1:39:48] that's why I'm teaching you this
[1:39:49] morning, you know, how to repent.
[1:39:54] He says you go with the depths of
[1:39:56] sincerity
[1:39:59] with godly sorrow for of your sin.
[1:40:05] First, you must be sorry.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; So don't just go ask someone to forgive
[1:40:12] you.
[1:40:13] Just because yeah, if I don't ask him,
[1:40:16] God is not going to hear my prayer.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; No, you have to be sorry.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; You know, and let me just keep paragraph
[1:40:25] 70.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Uh then I've got to tell God
[1:40:32] the same way
[1:40:36] and tell both her and God with the
[1:40:38] sincerity
[1:40:40] that I'll never do it again by the grace
[1:40:42] of God.
[1:40:45] You know how you ask for forgiveness
[1:40:46] forgive me and pray for me
[1:40:50] you know and by the grace of God I will
[1:40:52] never do it again.
[1:40:54] That is a sincere uh confession if it
[1:40:57] comes from the heart. And the same
[1:40:59] paragraph the prophet says I must be
[1:41:01] deeply sincere with God
[1:41:05] and then if I am sincere he'll hear me.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; And now pay attention to this. He says
[1:41:10] but if I am not sincere
[1:41:14] there is no need of me wasting God's
[1:41:16] times listening to me.
[1:41:23] That's what I was saying earlier.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Don't waste God's time.
[1:41:29] And also don't waste your own time. You
[1:41:32] know, at least God doesn't have time.
[1:41:34] God is eternal.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; But you here, you have a time.
[1:41:40] You know,
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; it wasn't too long ago you were 5 years
[1:41:42] old, 10, 15, 20, and now you're already
[1:41:46] at that age. Time goes by fast.
[1:41:50] Don't waste your time.
[1:41:54] Nothing even guarantees you tomorrow.
[1:41:58] You know, but the another problem also
[1:42:00] with confession is people are very
[1:42:02] pricey.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; You don't want to go down and ask
[1:42:08] another person to forgive you.
[1:42:13] But you know, maybe you need to change
[1:42:14] your mindset
[1:42:16] because once you realize that all of us
[1:42:19] commit sins,
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; all of us fall short, then you're not
[1:42:23] going to be prideful to go to that
[1:42:25] because you also recognize that person
[1:42:26] also can could have done the same thing.
[1:42:36] That's why God says, I will remove this
[1:42:38] stony heart out of you.
[1:42:42] Lord remove the stony hearts. The stony
[1:42:45] means stubborn heart. The word comes and
[1:42:48] preach and preach but you don't change.
[1:42:54] I don't know the condition of this
[1:42:55] church. For instance, I hope there's no
[1:42:58] one. I don't I hope we don't have
[1:42:59] enemies in this church.
[1:43:02] I really hope so.
[1:43:05] And if we do,
[1:43:07] how long have you been enemies with that
[1:43:09] person?
[1:43:11] But yet you come to church
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; and you rejoice under the word.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; I I really I don't know God is my
[1:43:20] witness. But I hope we don't have people
[1:43:23] that have enemies because let me tell
[1:43:26] you if you have an odd against someone
[1:43:29] you may be a hindrance to the move of
[1:43:31] God in this church.
[1:43:33] So if you don't make it right with a
[1:43:35] person,
[1:43:37] I'm begging you, please don't come to
[1:43:39] church.
[1:43:41] Amen.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; The prophet said that
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; you I don't know if I already read it,
[1:43:48] but if not, I already read it.
[1:43:53] You know, he I don't know the key word,
[1:43:56] but it's somewhere in my notes here.
[1:44:01] So if you
[1:44:04] that's why in some churches
[1:44:07] when you do certain things they ask you
[1:44:10] to stay home first
[1:44:12] till you make it right why do they do it
[1:44:16] God is the same
[1:44:19] God had given a promise to the children
[1:44:20] of Israel that they would overcome
[1:44:24] but because of sin in the camp
[1:44:27] he made the promise of God to no effect
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; and they had to go dig it out and get it
[1:44:35] out of the camp. Then then they started
[1:44:36] overcoming and you think God is going to
[1:44:39] change with you. The prophet says God is
[1:44:42] not a respector of a person.
[1:44:46] So that's why if you cannot make your
[1:44:48] life right
[1:44:51] especially for years or months months of
[1:44:54] coming to this church
[1:44:59] go home
[1:45:01] ask God to work on your heart
[1:45:05] but don't come to church like that
[1:45:09] we are coming to church to be blessed
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; we don't come to church to be cursed
[1:45:19] and stop being selfish.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; No, I don't I don't think this is in my
[1:45:25] notes, but I really hope we don't have
[1:45:27] anybody that has enemies. This is God
[1:45:29] speaking to you if you want.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; It's better for you to stop coming to
[1:45:35] church than coming to church in that
[1:45:36] condition.
[1:45:41] You know people are too comfortable with
[1:45:43] stuff like that. How do you even get on
[1:45:45] your knees and even pray
[1:45:49] the Bible? Do you do we read the same
[1:45:50] Bible?
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells me that we will know
[1:45:53] that you are my disciples for the love
[1:45:55] that you have one for another.
[1:46:00] And what is the love? The prophet
[1:46:02] explained to us what that love is. He
[1:46:04] says that love is not when someone does
[1:46:06] good to you.
[1:46:08] Love is when someone is even willing to
[1:46:10] kill you if he was given A CHANCE,
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; but you still love him.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; That's the love that Jesus was talking
[1:46:18] about. Brother Billy Paul says that the
[1:46:21] thing with brother Brandham. You
[1:46:23] couldn't even tell his enemies from his
[1:46:25] friends.
[1:46:29] So if we are his disciples, let's do the
[1:46:31] same way.
[1:46:33] If you have people that you know you
[1:46:35] don't have to be besties with everybody.
[1:46:38] We're not asking you to be best friends
[1:46:41] but be
[1:46:44] and then if you also think that that
[1:46:45] person is wrong
[1:46:48] still be Christian but go pray for that
[1:46:50] person.
[1:46:54] It's better for you to not come to
[1:46:56] church.
[1:46:59] you know
[1:47:01] while I'm on needs too
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; this thing comes to my mind commun
[1:47:05] communion
[1:47:07] you know people are too comfortable with
[1:47:09] not making their life right with each
[1:47:11] other or God
[1:47:15] you know one thing that I've noticed
[1:47:16] about this church for years
[1:47:19] and it's a shame to the church that
[1:47:22] during communion
[1:47:24] I would say 5% or 10% of church still
[1:47:27] take communion
[1:47:30] Not one time, but every time
[1:47:34] since I was in Iowa City,
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; I moved down here. Same thing.
[1:47:41] That's not what the message of the hour
[1:47:43] came to do. We are not to be stagnant in
[1:47:46] one place.
[1:47:51] I'm sorry. I'm preaching a message
[1:47:52] that's supposed to prick your heart
[1:47:57] because the word has to prick your
[1:47:59] heart,
[1:48:01] you know, because I want you to be in a
[1:48:03] good position with God
[1:48:06] where you can have a situation, you
[1:48:08] know, when when when a challenge comes
[1:48:10] your way,
[1:48:12] when a a problem comes your way,
[1:48:15] you the ministry is nowhere to be found,
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; but you know that you're in a right
[1:48:20] place with God.
[1:48:22] And you have the right to go directly to
[1:48:24] God and ask him anything and he's
[1:48:27] obligated to give it to you.
[1:48:30] That's your right as a believer.
[1:48:35] That's your right.
[1:48:38] You know when Jesus died on Calvary, the
[1:48:40] veil was ripped into what that what does
[1:48:43] that mean? That means you have direct
[1:48:44] access to the father.
[1:48:51] But the Bible says if our heart condemns
[1:48:54] us not
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; then we have confidence that he will
[1:48:59] hear us.
[1:49:04] So it's either the voice that we're
[1:49:06] preaching in the pulpit
[1:49:10] is not sharp enough to pierce your
[1:49:12] heart.
[1:49:18] But what are we preaching? We are just
[1:49:19] repeating the message.
[1:49:25] Turn the hearts of the of the children
[1:49:28] to their fathers.
[1:49:30] Turn our hearts where it can again be
[1:49:32] pricked.
[1:49:36] So now let me ask you think about this.
[1:49:39] This this is not in my notes but think
[1:49:40] about this. So you know when God was
[1:49:44] talk about Job, he was proud of Job.
[1:49:48] He invited Satan come see have you seen
[1:49:50] my servant Job?
[1:49:53] Now imagine God comes in this church.
[1:49:56] YOU KNOW THE PROPHET says God always
[1:49:58] keeps his appointment
[1:50:01] every time, every Sunday, every
[1:50:03] Wednesday, God is here in this church
[1:50:06] but we have not made him welcome.
[1:50:11] Now imagine God is like because the
[1:50:14] prophet also says that Satan also goes
[1:50:16] to church.
[1:50:19] [applause]
[1:50:20] [cheering] Now Satan is here and God is
[1:50:21] here.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Now God is like oh my god how am I even
[1:50:29] going to Satan is there laughing
[1:50:34] and God doesn't even cannot even be
[1:50:37] proud of you.
[1:50:39] God doesn't So Satan is laughing at this
[1:50:41] church and God is God doesn't even know
[1:50:43] what to say because what is he going to
[1:50:45] say? Your life is not backing him up.
[1:50:49] Your life is not being a witness of the
[1:50:51] resurrection.
[1:50:53] Your life is being ashamed of the
[1:50:55] gospel.
[1:50:58] Somehow we are not being sincere with
[1:51:00] the message of the hour.
[1:51:03] WE SAY we believe it in the mouth. IT'S
[1:51:06] A SHAME THAT hogs tabernacle 5% of
[1:51:08] people take communion.
[1:51:11] Why is it a shame? Let me say why. Do
[1:51:14] you think that everybody that comes
[1:51:15] takes communion they everybody's
[1:51:18] perfect?
[1:51:20] Starting from the pastor to everybody.
[1:51:22] We all have fault.
[1:51:25] We believe in going to make things
[1:51:27] right.
[1:51:30] Especially, you know, the thing
[1:51:31] especially we warn you be before time.
[1:51:35] A week like a week before we like we're
[1:51:38] going to have communion service
[1:51:40] people come to church we have before
[1:51:43] communion we sing people raising chairs
[1:51:45] Jerusalem
[1:51:47] Jerus I've seen this in the church
[1:51:49] Jerusalem
[1:51:52] and then
[1:51:53] I'm sorry that's the word and then when
[1:51:57] it comes down to communion the pastor
[1:51:59] says if you are not you know not
[1:52:01] everybody has to take it you know if
[1:52:04] your heart is not right with God or if
[1:52:05] you don't feel comfortable, don't take
[1:52:07] it. Those people that were saying
[1:52:09] Jerusalem,
[1:52:11] walk out of the door,
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; you know what that means? It grieves the
[1:52:20] spirit of God.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; It graves the spirit of God.
[1:52:26] You remember the prophet had a vision
[1:52:28] where God show him every sin that he was
[1:52:30] committing
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; and on that scene on that vision he
[1:52:35] could see Jesus was crying bloody tears.
[1:52:40] That's what's happening in this church
[1:52:41] every Sunday.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus come he so he's pretty much coming
[1:52:46] to a funeral.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus doesn't come happy in this church.
[1:52:56] THE BIBLE SAYS, "Grieve not the Holy
[1:52:58] Ghost."
[1:53:01] Grieve not the spirit of God. So the
[1:53:04] Holy Ghost can be grieved.
[1:53:07] What is grieving? When someone lose
[1:53:09] someone, you are grieving. You are
[1:53:10] crying. You are hurt.
[1:53:13] So maybe we shouldn't even invite Jesus
[1:53:16] in church.
[1:53:18] Why are we going to invite him just to
[1:53:20] come cry?
[1:53:24] believers, work on your hearts.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; You know, if you have something against
[1:53:31] someone, go make it right. Come and take
[1:53:34] communion.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; And if it's not against someone,
[1:53:38] something that you've done,
[1:53:40] the Bible says his mercy is on you every
[1:53:43] morning.
[1:53:45] So even if yesterday I committed
[1:53:47] something bad, this morning his mercy is
[1:53:50] new for me. So then I believe that
[1:53:53] because his word says so that when I get
[1:53:55] on my knees, Lord forgive me, he
[1:53:58] forgives you.
[1:54:01] Then when you are forgiven,
[1:54:04] he doesn't even see all the sins you
[1:54:05] committed. Then you come and you take
[1:54:07] communion,
[1:54:12] you know, please
[1:54:14] let's work on our heart.
[1:54:17] You know, it's it's like it's it's it's
[1:54:20] embarrassing even as a church. One time
[1:54:23] I was very embarrassed.
[1:54:25] I believe there was a new year service
[1:54:27] or something like that.
[1:54:30] And I think I talked about that to the
[1:54:32] pastor
[1:54:33] communion. We probably only like five or
[1:54:36] six, seven people there. Majority of the
[1:54:38] church gone.
[1:54:41] Now imagine if I bring a sinner in this
[1:54:43] church.
[1:54:46] I would be concerned.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; You know the problem is that it's not
[1:54:54] that it happened one time. It it
[1:54:55] happened time after time after time
[1:54:58] after time. Why can't you make your life
[1:55:00] right with God?
[1:55:03] Why?
[1:55:06] Why can't you make your heart work on
[1:55:08] your heart? That's that's the message
[1:55:11] today. The first step is repentance.
[1:55:15] The first step is your heart.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I don't mean to be hard, but
[1:55:24] I have to.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; You know, and after you've done all
[1:55:31] those things, the Bible says after we've
[1:55:34] done all this,
[1:55:37] now letting let God do the work.
[1:55:46] I wonder this just coming to my mind
[1:55:48] now.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Is it that you don't take communion
[1:55:50] because the night before you drunk?
[1:56:00] But even that,
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; you know, if you go and you ask God to
[1:56:04] forgive you, he will forgive you and you
[1:56:07] come and you take communion.
[1:56:12] Let's make God proud in this church.
[1:56:15] Let's change the narrative.
[1:56:18] You know, you know, I was I was uh
[1:56:21] reading this person, this Satanist.
[1:56:24] He used to be a satanist and he was
[1:56:25] converted to being a Christian.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; He spoke about Halloween,
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; you know, he said that during Halloween,
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; you know, when people celebrate
[1:56:35] Halloween,
[1:56:37] usually in those places, even if one
[1:56:39] house doesn't celebrate Halloween,
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; but in that street there are a lot of
[1:56:44] demons that get stations there.
[1:56:49] You know, so those demons know which
[1:56:52] like which streets they can go to.
[1:56:56] And somehow demons know higher ground
[1:56:58] tabernacle.
[1:57:00] Higher ground tabernacle.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Not for the good way, but the bad way.
[1:57:04] They know higher ground is. Oh, if you
[1:57:06] want to I I'll just go to higher ground
[1:57:08] tabernacle.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; I can sing. I can shout
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; and I'll go home and I'll say I'm still
[1:57:18] a believer.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Let's change that.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:29] Let's change that.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:35] Hallelujah.
[1:57:38] Hallelujah. Let's change that guys.
[1:57:42] Satan, in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:57:45] we're going to change this church.
[1:57:48] Satan, in the name of Jesus Christ, you
[1:57:51] ought to let them go.
[1:57:54] Satan, in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:57:57] you ought to let them go.
[1:58:01] [applause and cheering]
[1:58:04] In the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:58:07] I reclaim your heart.
[1:58:10] In the name of Jesus Christ, I pray that
[1:58:12] God breaks the yolks of the stony heart
[1:58:14] in your life and give you a heart of
[1:58:17] flesh.
[1:58:20] In the name of Jesus Christ, I pray that
[1:58:23] God convicts your heart
[1:58:26] that you come to the altar, you go
[1:58:29] repair with your fellow brother and
[1:58:31] sister, make your life right with God
[1:58:34] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:58:41] The mercy of God is here
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; for whomever will accept it.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; Examine your heart, Lord.
[1:58:51] What is he saying? Is he speaking to me?
[1:58:55] Lord, work on my heart. Change me. I
[1:58:59] want to turn. The prophet says
[1:59:02] repentance is turning around.
[1:59:07] You know, there are even people, you
[1:59:10] know, I don't believe everybody that
[1:59:11] drink
[1:59:13] really don't want to give that up.
[1:59:17] I believe there are some,
[1:59:20] they want to give it up, but they just
[1:59:23] can't.
[1:59:27] And I'm not here to preach you the dos
[1:59:29] and don'ts.
[1:59:30] You know, the prophet says that's the
[1:59:32] error with the believer that with the
[1:59:33] preaching
[1:59:35] We are to point back the people to
[1:59:37] Calvary.
[1:59:38] We are to point the people back to Jesus
[1:59:40] Christ.
[1:59:42] So if you have a desire to give it up,
[1:59:46] I'll read a quote here. There was a man
[1:59:48] that had he he had an habit of smoking
[1:59:50] cigarettes.
[1:59:53] He wanted to give that up, but he just
[1:59:56] couldn't. And he felt like he couldn't
[1:59:58] give his life to God because of that.
[2:00:01] The prophet says, "Don't even worry.
[2:00:03] Don't even mention cigarettes.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; The brother said, "I'm not even going to
[2:00:07] talk about that. Let's take you to the
[2:00:10] source. Let's take you to the person
[2:00:12] that can deliver you from that."
[2:00:15] And the prophet to led him to Jesus
[2:00:18] Christ.
[2:00:20] Let me read that.
[2:00:32] Okay. Yeah, I found it. So, uh, it's
[2:00:35] going to be a little bit lengthy, but in
[2:00:36] the message, the key to the door,
[2:00:37] paragraph 16,
[2:00:41] says
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; he said, um,
[2:00:46] I guess it's just the church here
[2:00:47] tonight, but as far as I know, I'm not
[2:00:49] here in no, let me skip. I got a little
[2:00:52] criticism here not long ago on baptizing
[2:00:54] a man here in the
[2:00:57] He was an old fellow.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; I went to him. He was a good old man.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Just because you smoke, you drink,
[2:01:05] doesn't mean you're bad.
[2:01:08] You You can be You can be You are a
[2:01:10] child of God, but you are bound in
[2:01:12] chains of sin.
[2:01:14] You are a good man. You are a good
[2:01:15] sister. I would even call you my
[2:01:18] brother.
[2:01:21] You know, he says, "I had the privilege
[2:01:23] of leading all of his family to Christ.
[2:01:27] This old man was a nice old man, and I
[2:01:31] liked him." So, I went to, you see,
[2:01:34] Jesus doesn't care about the condition
[2:01:36] of your life.
[2:01:39] You know, even the young ruler, Jesus
[2:01:40] loved him. And here, this prophet, this
[2:01:43] guy who smokes every day, but the
[2:01:46] prophet says, "I like this guy. He was a
[2:01:48] good person.
[2:01:50] And I said to him, "Papa,
[2:01:53] why don't you become a Christian?"
[2:01:57] You know what? Another thing that caught
[2:01:58] my attention here, even to us ministers,
[2:02:02] respect towards older people. The
[2:02:05] prophet was still a prophet, but he
[2:02:06] still called him papa.
[2:02:10] That's why Paul tells Timothy, when you
[2:02:13] rebuke all the people, rebuke them with,
[2:02:15] you know, respect.
[2:02:21] Papa, why don't you become a Christian?
[2:02:23] He loves me. He says, "Brother Brham, I
[2:02:26] would become a Christian when I can get
[2:02:28] good enough."
[2:02:31] Amen.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; I said, "Tell you what to do. What you
[2:02:35] do, papa? You look around till you find
[2:02:37] where you can get when you can get good
[2:02:40] enough. Then tell me where the places I
[2:02:42] want to go to."
[2:02:46] I said Christ never come to save a good
[2:02:48] man.
[2:02:52] [applause]
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; Christ did not come to save. Hallelujah.
[2:02:56] Hallelujah.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Come did not come. Christ did not come
[2:03:00] to save a good man.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; I am happy of that because I was not I'm
[2:03:04] not a good man. Amen.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; He says, "I did not come for those that
[2:03:09] were already whole, but the physician
[2:03:11] came to those that need a physician.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Lord, I am not a good man." So that
[2:03:19] means God is here for me
[2:03:21] this morning. If you believe yourself
[2:03:23] not to be a good man or a good woman,
[2:03:26] I'm here to tell you that Christ is here
[2:03:28] for you.
[2:03:33] He never came to save a good man, but he
[2:03:36] came to save bad men.
[2:03:40] Not decent men, but bad men.
[2:03:44] Lord, I am bad. Lord, I keep cheating on
[2:03:47] my wife. Lord, I keep lying. But in my
[2:03:50] hearts, I want to be right, but I just
[2:03:52] cannot seem to give up those things.
[2:03:55] I drink alcohol. I GET DRUNK, BUT I WANT
[2:03:58] TO GIVE IT UP.
[2:04:01] I LIE. I do all those things.
[2:04:03] I am here for you.
[2:04:06] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[2:04:09] forever, this morning. In the name of
[2:04:11] Jesus Christ, he's here to save you
[2:04:14] because he recognizes that you are not
[2:04:15] good. And he recognizes that on your
[2:04:18] own, you can never be good.
[2:04:21] You need Jesus Christ BECAUSE HE IS YOUR
[2:04:24] STRENGTH. HE IS YOUR ALL. All that you
[2:04:27] need is in Jesus Christ. He's your
[2:04:30] peace. He is your victory.
[2:04:33] Everything that I need in this journey
[2:04:35] is in Jesus Christ. The Bible says, "I
[2:04:39] can do all things through Christ who
[2:04:42] strengthen me. I can overcome the spirit
[2:04:44] of alcohol through Christ who strengthen
[2:04:47] me. I can overcome the spirit of lust
[2:04:51] through Christ who strengthen me. I can
[2:04:54] overcome anything that comes against me
[2:04:57] through Christ who strengthen me BECAUSE
[2:05:00] HIS STRENGTH IS PERFECT
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; and he's just all that I need.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; I can overcome.
[2:05:09] [applause]
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; I can overcome
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; because the living God has already
[2:05:17] overcome for me.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; I am not good.
[2:05:22] Li Paul IS NOT GOOD. I'M NOT A GOOD MAN.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; I NEED JESUS.
[2:05:29] Every hour of my life, I need Jesus.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Every minute of my life, I need Jesus.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; I cannot go a second without Jesus.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; The second I go without Jesus, I fall.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; The second I go WITHOUT JESUS, I FALL.
[2:05:44] THE SECOND YOU GO WITHOUT CHRIST, YOU
[2:05:46] FALL. THE SECOND YOU GO WITHOUT JESUS,
[2:05:48] YOU FALL.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; I NEED HIM. The song says, "I need thee
[2:05:53] or I need thee every hour. I need you."
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus, it's getting hard in this last
[2:06:00] age.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; It's getting HARD IN LEODIA.
[2:06:04] LORD, this morning it's getting harder
[2:06:06] to live as a Christian. I need you,
[2:06:09] Lord. I need you. Then you know when you
[2:06:12] need him, but when he shows up,
[2:06:15] you get to get into a place where you
[2:06:17] need Christ.
[2:06:20] Jesus would only get in your life when
[2:06:21] you are desperate for him.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; Get desperate for God.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; Let him see that he you really need him.
[2:06:32] Brother the Hebrew voice. The God they
[2:06:35] were walking to the fire.
[2:06:39] He He got to a place they were getting
[2:06:41] close to getting in the fire.
[2:06:44] Jesus back in heaven. He said, "My
[2:06:46] children need me.
[2:06:48] ON THEIR OWN, THEY'RE GOING TO BURN.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; They need me. They don't NEED MY ANGELS.
[2:06:55] THEY don't need just any any other
[2:06:57] person. They need me. Then we saw Jesus
[2:07:01] came down in the fire AND HE BECAME THE
[2:07:04] FOURTH man in the fire.
[2:07:07] When you need Jesus Christ, HE'S GOING
[2:07:10] TO BE THE fourth man in your fire.
[2:07:13] Daniel, he was thrown in the lion's den.
[2:07:17] GOD SAID
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; THEY need me. He's like Daniel need me.
[2:07:23] So when did he do? He sent his angels.
[2:07:26] He shuts the mouth of the lions.
[2:07:29] I'M TELLING YOU, WHEN YOU need the Lord,
[2:07:31] he will shut the mouth of the lions. The
[2:07:34] Bible says the devil is roaring like a
[2:07:36] lion. But when you need God, the Bible
[2:07:40] says he's the most present help in times
[2:07:42] of trouble. When I'm in trouble, I need
[2:07:45] Jesus. THEN JESUS COMES and he shuts the
[2:07:48] mouth of THE OF THE LION. OH LORD, I
[2:07:52] have all the demons around me. Oh Lord,
[2:07:54] I have all these lions around me. You're
[2:07:58] the God of Daniel. Search the mouth of
[2:08:00] those lions. Oh, I have all these
[2:08:02] troubles against me. I have all these
[2:08:05] weapons to form against me. BUT YOU SAID
[2:08:09] that no weapons FORM AGAINST ME WILL
[2:08:12] PROSPER. WHY? BECAUSE I need you.
[2:08:16] I need you, Lord, this morning. I need
[2:08:19] you, Lord, this morning. This church
[2:08:21] needs YOU, LORD. WE ARE CRYING OUT FOR
[2:08:23] YOU, LORD JESUS. WE ARE CRYING OUT for
[2:08:26] an outpouring OF THE HOLY GHOST. LORD, I
[2:08:29] NEED YOU.
[2:08:31] I confess
[2:08:33] every hour, I need you. That's when
[2:08:37] Jesus comes.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I'm a bad man.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; I am a bad man.
[2:08:47] And I need the good man to save the bad
[2:08:50] man.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; You know it depends on what you are
[2:08:54] seeing.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; You know Barabbas
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; he was about to get executed.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; Barabas was a murderer.
[2:09:03] He was a bad man and his day for exe
[2:09:06] execution came
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; and he was already making his last
[2:09:10] prayer.
[2:09:13] Just like John
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; when no one was ready to open the book,
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; John started crying. The prophet says
[2:09:20] because he believed that was going to be
[2:09:22] the end of everything that was going to
[2:09:24] be the execution of John.
[2:09:26] Then at the last minute, someone comes
[2:09:28] to the door. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; They open the door
[2:09:34] and Barabas all sees in the door and he
[2:09:37] thinks they're taking him to get uh
[2:09:39] executed. THEY SAID, "YOU ARE FREE,
[2:09:41] BARABAS.
[2:09:43] YOU ARE FREE. BARABUS.
[2:09:46] Barabus didn't know. Barabus is LIKE,
[2:09:49] "OH MY GOD, WHAT DO YOU MEAN I'M FREE?"
[2:09:52] They say, "Look over there.
[2:09:56] LOOK ON THE CROSS. THERE IS SOMEONE
[2:09:59] THERE. HE TOOK YOUR PLACE. LOOK ON THE
[2:10:03] CROSS, BARABUS. YOU ARE FREE."
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; THIS MORNING,
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; I was in lost in sin. shackles with the
[2:10:11] shackles of sin.
[2:10:14] The demon is cutting my flesh left and
[2:10:16] right.
[2:10:18] But then I hear a VOICE
[2:10:20] THAT SAY, "You are free."
[2:10:24] I hear a voice that says, "YOU ARE FREE.
[2:10:27] LOOK AT CALVARY. HIGH GROUND TABERNACLE.
[2:10:31] LOOK AT CALVARY.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST was he died on the cross so
[2:10:38] you can be free.
[2:10:41] You are a bad man. YOU ARE A BAD WOMAN.
[2:10:45] But Jesus Christ, the only good person,
[2:10:48] he took YOUR PLACE, YOU WILL NOT DIE.
[2:10:52] THAT'S WHY THE Bible says if you believe
[2:10:54] on the Lord Jesus Christ, you have
[2:10:56] eternal life. If you believe on the
[2:10:58] message OF THE HOUR, YOU WILL NOT DIE.
[2:11:01] YOU WILL NOT PERISH. The devil meant
[2:11:04] HARM FOR YOU. BUT GOD HAS TURNED IT FOR
[2:11:07] YOUR GOOD. GOD MEANS prosperity for you.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; Your sins are forgiven.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; I stand as Barabus.
[2:11:23] I was headed toward sin,
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; but Christ took my place.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; But it's up for you to accept it
[2:11:33] this morning. There is enough room at
[2:11:35] the cross for each and every ONE OF YOU.
[2:11:39] THANK YOU JESUS.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; THERE'S enough room for each and every
[2:11:42] one of us.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; What does the song says? Is there room
[2:11:57] at the cross?
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, there is room.
[2:12:03] If there was room for brother Brham,
[2:12:06] brother Brham was supposed to be also a
[2:12:08] murderer. He was going to shoot someone
[2:12:11] and he was going to be sent in jail. But
[2:12:14] grace made a way for him. There was room
[2:12:17] for brother Brandham. There is room for
[2:12:19] you. There is room for me this morning.
[2:12:24] Jesus is here to make sure you are
[2:12:26] changed from being a bad man to a good
[2:12:29] man.
[2:12:31] Amen.
[2:12:35] There is room at the cross.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; Change my heart.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; Let me continue.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; He says, yeah, he says uh tell you I
[2:12:47] want to go to Christ never come to save
[2:12:48] a good man. He came to save a bad man.
[2:12:50] When you think you are good,
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; then he didn't come to save you.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; Who are the bad people this morning?
[2:13:03] Christ is here to save you.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; The prophet says when you think you are
[2:13:08] good
[2:13:10] then maybe start become a Muslim
[2:13:13] actually.
[2:13:15] When you think you are good become a
[2:13:17] Buddhist because Jesus is not there for
[2:13:20] you.
[2:13:21] Jesus is here for me because I'm bad.
[2:13:24] Look at all the people that God had to
[2:13:26] deal with.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; Are you going to say David was a good
[2:13:30] man?
[2:13:32] He was so bad to the point that God
[2:13:34] would not even allow him to build the
[2:13:36] temple.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Everybody that got it, Paul was a
[2:13:42] murderer.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; He witnessed the murder of Steven.
[2:13:52] But I'm glad that that God doesn't look
[2:13:54] at that. DO YOU KNOW WHY? WHY God does
[2:13:57] come for you? is because you were in his
[2:13:59] thought before the foundation of the
[2:14:00] world.
[2:14:02] That's why God is coming for you.
[2:14:06] HE WILL NOT leave one behind. God
[2:14:09] doesn't care ABOUT WHAT YOU DO. He cared
[2:14:12] about his germ of life that he put
[2:14:14] inside of you
[2:14:16] before the foundation of the world. And
[2:14:18] now you are his thought expressed.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; When you think you're good, he didn't
[2:14:24] come to save you.
[2:14:28] He come to save them that he knows are
[2:14:30] bad. Oh Lord, do you know if I'm bad?
[2:14:34] Lord, do you know that I'm bad? Lord,
[2:14:36] come. Lord, come. Christ died to save
[2:14:40] sinners.
[2:14:42] I said, "Papa, there's a line right
[2:14:44] here." He said, "Well, I smoke these
[2:14:48] cigarettes." You know the issue, the
[2:14:50] problem we do? Oh my god, yesterday I
[2:14:52] just lasted.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; I just did something bad. I just drank.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; Am I [clears throat] good enough?
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; I smoke these cigarettes. How can God
[2:15:02] save me?
[2:15:04] I said, "I ain't going to even talk."
[2:15:06] The prophet says, "I'm not even going to
[2:15:08] talk about them."
[2:15:11] He said, "I've tried to give them my
[2:15:13] brother Bran."
[2:15:15] Brother says, "We ain't going to talk
[2:15:17] about it."
[2:15:19] That's the thing. When you come to God,
[2:15:21] he's not going to talk about your past
[2:15:23] life because he's there to change you.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; So come this morning. There's a song say
[2:15:31] just as I am, I come to you.
[2:15:36] God is here to change you.
[2:15:39] We're not going to talk about that. When
[2:15:40] you come up here, I'm not going to talk
[2:15:42] about that. If you want to change, you
[2:15:45] come, you say, "Pray for me. I want to
[2:15:47] change."
[2:15:49] I'm not going to talk about your
[2:15:50] struggles
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; because I know that I have to lead you
[2:15:54] to the person that has overcome all the
[2:15:55] struggles.
[2:15:57] You know, he even overcame hell.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; So, what is that thing that's too hard
[2:16:04] for God? What are you scared of? You're
[2:16:08] not going to go to hell.
[2:16:10] You are not going to go to hell. You are
[2:16:14] from heaven. You came from heaven and
[2:16:18] you are going to return back to heaven.
[2:16:21] You came from God and you are going to
[2:16:24] return back to God.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; He he said u um don't say don't say no
[2:16:32] more about them. Let them go. I want to
[2:16:35] ask you a question. He said he said all
[2:16:38] right. What is it? I said do you believe
[2:16:40] there is a God?
[2:16:42] Said certainly I believe it.
[2:16:46] Do you believe there is a God?
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; Believe it. Do you believe that the same
[2:16:53] God crossed his strength and was made
[2:16:55] flesh and dwelt dwelt among us in the
[2:16:58] person of Jesus Christ in order to save
[2:17:00] men?
[2:17:02] He said, "Yes, I believe."
[2:17:06] So that's a question I'm asking you to
[2:17:09] save sinners like you are and like
[2:17:13] see. Yes, I believe that. I'm asking
[2:17:16] you, do you believe that Christ came to
[2:17:17] save sinners like you and me?
[2:17:21] If you believe that from your heart,
[2:17:24] pairing of 22 and I said now it's it's
[2:17:27] just like this, we are all in one big
[2:17:30] building over here
[2:17:32] and we are in jail and I can't stand
[2:17:35] over in this corner and say this will
[2:17:37] help me get out of jail.
[2:17:40] I stand over in that corner and say that
[2:17:42] will help me get out of jail. We are all
[2:17:44] in the same fix.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; And every man that was born in this
[2:17:49] world was born in sin and shaped in
[2:17:51] iniquity.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; Come to the world speaking life.
[2:17:55] He
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; is a renegade to begin with. Now
[2:17:58] paragraph 128 28. I want to say
[2:18:00] something.
[2:18:02] Every man in this prison house who is
[2:18:04] holy?
[2:18:08] Who is the one that wasn't born by sex?
[2:18:12] Who is one that can help the other no
[2:18:14] matter what he is?
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; We are in the same prison.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; But God made himself one of his creation
[2:18:22] and come beyond beyond that.
[2:18:26] You know through the blood and he
[2:18:28] redeemed us.
[2:18:31] Do you believe that?
[2:18:34] I'm asking you do you believe that?
[2:18:37] He said, "I believe that." And I said,
[2:18:40] "Christ died for bad men like you."
[2:18:44] Now, there's only one way to do. There's
[2:18:47] nothing you can do. He offers it to you.
[2:18:51] This is free to you.
[2:18:53] You can't merit it. Nothing you can do
[2:18:56] to get it. He just gives it to you. Will
[2:19:01] you accept what he did for you to keep
[2:19:04] you from hell?
[2:19:07] He said, "I'll do that."
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, would you accept
[2:19:12] what Christ has done for you to keep you
[2:19:14] from hell?
[2:19:17] He's not going to answer it for you. You
[2:19:18] have to answer it yourself.
[2:19:21] But he got back against he said, "But if
[2:19:24] I could just get rid of these
[2:19:25] cigarettes."
[2:19:27] So, you see, that's why you shouldn't
[2:19:28] judge people out there. Not everybody
[2:19:30] that does those things really want to do
[2:19:32] that.
[2:19:34] Some people they genuinely want to be
[2:19:36] delivered, but they just don't know how.
[2:19:40] And I said,
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; "The cigarette will take care of it."
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; The drinking will take care of itself.
[2:19:51] The last spirit will take care of
[2:19:53] itself. But you just come to Jesus.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; I ain't asking you. I am not a legalist.
[2:20:01] I believe in grace
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; and all the father has given me will
[2:20:06] come to me
[2:20:08] and let me skip u
[2:20:13] it says that's it then accept what he
[2:20:16] gives you he said I do and paragraph now
[2:20:20] pay attention to this
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; paragraph 133 he says and I baptize him
[2:20:25] in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; and him go out here and light up a
[2:20:30] cigarette
[2:20:33] So the prophet of the age,
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; oh my God,
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; I love God.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; I love I love that ability of God that
[2:20:41] he doesn't look at our sins. But when
[2:20:44] God is so dedicated to saving you,
[2:20:48] nothing will stand in its way.
[2:20:51] You think that, oh, I'm going to keep
[2:20:52] smoking cigarettes. I promise you, once
[2:20:55] you come to Jesus,
[2:20:57] that thing will will go. It might not be
[2:21:00] instantly
[2:21:03] that thing will go.
[2:21:05] And the prophet DIDN'T JUDGE THIS MAN.
[2:21:07] HE SAID, "DON'T EVEN TALK TO ME ABOUT
[2:21:08] THE CIGARETTES. I just want to know, do
[2:21:10] you want to give your life to God or
[2:21:12] not?
[2:21:14] Don't talk to me about THE DRINKING. DO
[2:21:16] YOU WANT TO GIVE YOUR LIFE to God or
[2:21:18] not? Don't talk Don't talk to me about
[2:21:20] your last thing.
[2:21:25] Do you want to be a changed man or woman
[2:21:27] or not?
[2:21:30] He baptized him and in front of the
[2:21:32] prophet
[2:21:39] a few weeks ago.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; I was down to his home place
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; and I saw a vision,
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; you know, of an evergreen tree being cut
[2:21:48] down, turned upside down, and I see
[2:21:50] failed on it.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; And let me paraphrase it. So the tree
[2:21:54] fell down and he fell on the on the on
[2:21:57] the papa.
[2:22:00] And then and then uh he said the prophet
[2:22:02] says and papa fell
[2:22:05] and mashed his back in here. And so the
[2:22:08] next morning they brought his cigarettes
[2:22:10] to him when he was in the bed.
[2:22:15] The next morning they brought his
[2:22:16] cigarettes to him when he was in the
[2:22:18] bed.
[2:22:20] But the desire had done left him.
[2:22:25] He's never tasted one. Don't even want
[2:22:27] or nothing else in him.
[2:22:32] You see
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; the desire. It's not you don't have to
[2:22:35] manufacture that.
[2:22:39] You come to Jesus
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; with no money with no price.
[2:22:45] Jesus asked is there is there no bomb in
[2:22:47] Gilead?
[2:22:52] Is there not enough Holy Ghost for each
[2:22:53] and every one of us?
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is God's spirit.
[2:24:35] the lack of sincerity.
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; And then the Holy Spirit told him
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; to and the Bible says there but there
[2:24:46] must be deep sincerity to know that the
[2:24:48] God that can take it away already.
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; And then the Holy Spirit spoke to me one
[2:24:53] morning about daylight and said get up
[2:24:56] on the platform
[2:24:58] or somewhere and bring these people up
[2:25:00] there and make them confess everything
[2:25:03] that
[2:25:04] &gt;&gt; before you pray for them.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; See the deepness of sincerity.
[2:25:11] Unless the world repents, it's got to
[2:25:14] perish. [snorts]
[2:25:16] And confession is what the world needs
[2:25:18] today is honest confession. Paragraph
[2:25:21] 76.
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; Many people say they believe
[2:25:25] That is true. The scripture is correct.
[2:25:28] I'm reading the prescription. I'm
[2:25:29] reading what the prescription is.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; And the antidote for my sin. But can I
[2:25:35] take it? Can I believe it? I might say I
[2:25:38] believe, but do I believe?
[2:25:41] We say believe the message of the hour,
[2:25:43] but why are the blessings of the message
[2:25:46] of the hour following us?
[2:25:51] You know, that's the next thing. Just
[2:25:53] read it and know the direction doesn't
[2:25:54] cure the disease.
[2:25:59] The trouble is that we won't take what
[2:26:01] the remedy says do.
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; We don't do what the message says do.
[2:26:07] Brother says when you do something wrong
[2:26:09] against someone go repair that. We don't
[2:26:11] do that. That's the problem.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; Let me skip again 78. You take a person
[2:26:18] says they are I am a believer. I'm a
[2:26:20] believer. I believe.
[2:26:22] But let the gospel light strike them,
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; brother. They take it right now and they
[2:26:29] will show result.
[2:26:32] You will not see that man in any more
[2:26:34] pool rooms.
[2:26:38] You will not see him out here with a
[2:26:40] cigarette in his hand.
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; You won't see him drinking.
[2:26:50] Are
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; is it project? I can't see from far. Can
[2:26:52] you see? Is it the same thing?
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; You can't you won't see him drinking.
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; Are we message believers?
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; The prophet says many people says go
[2:27:07] back again to 78. You take a person that
[2:27:09] says I am a believer.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; I am a message believer.
[2:27:17] Malachi 4.
[2:27:17] &gt;&gt; We believe in the message of Malachi 4,
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; but let the gospel light strike them.
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; You won't see him drinking.
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; So if you still drink
[2:27:33] somehow
[2:27:36] your your belief is not sincere.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; No, I mean it's the same code. He says
[2:27:42] lack of sincerity.
[2:27:46] Now, let's take I've I've hit too much
[2:27:47] on the brothers uh uh drinking. So, let
[2:27:50] me go to the next stage. I know maybe
[2:27:53] sisters, too.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; Maybe.
[2:28:00] It's as much bad for the brothers as for
[2:28:02] the sisters.
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; Sister, stop drinking.
[2:28:14] Now, let's go to the next phase. You
[2:28:16] won't see him flirting with other women.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no.
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; I don't care how much they throw their
[2:28:25] female flesh before him. He will
[2:28:29] he will turn his heads towards the skies
[2:28:31] and look towards Christ.
[2:28:44] Amen.
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; But now you are claiming to be a
[2:28:49] believer.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; But you it's not even that you will turn
[2:28:54] against but you actually go on your
[2:28:56] computer
[2:29:00] and you lust after women's a woman's
[2:29:02] question.
[2:29:07] common among especially young boys.
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; No one is there's no demons that's going
[2:29:14] to escape here this morning.
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; We are here to pierce the hearts.
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; There are there are young men in this
[2:29:26] building
[2:29:28] and maybe even sisters
[2:29:30] that still watch pornography to this
[2:29:32] day.
[2:29:38] You know the thing is I don't know how
[2:29:40] to explain it.
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; No one even told me who that person is
[2:29:44] or who those people are.
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to look at you but I know
[2:29:48] who you are. You know the prophet said
[2:29:51] this. That's why you have to listen to
[2:29:52] the message. The prophet says you know
[2:29:56] when the demons are about to be exposed.
[2:30:00] He said, "You can see that on the
[2:30:02] people's face."
[2:30:07] &gt;&gt; You can see that on the people's face.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; You can't help it. Those demons, they
[2:30:11] just get uncomfortable. And I can't see
[2:30:13] that in your face.
[2:30:17] You can't see someone is uncomfortable
[2:30:19] when I mention this,
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; but I'm not talking. I'm we're here to
[2:30:24] make you to set you free
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; to help you. Parents as well
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; check what your children watch on their
[2:30:35] phones.
[2:30:37] You would be surprised even don't think
[2:30:39] they're too young for
[2:30:42] you'll be surprised 10 11 year olds they
[2:30:44] know they know about those stuff
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; I had one time this one kid
[2:30:54] she was talking to me
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; about like it was kind of weird like
[2:31:00] something that one of her sibling was
[2:31:02] showing her
[2:31:05] by her description you can tell it was
[2:31:07] really like some sexual stuff.
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; She's probably like what? 9 10 11 I
[2:31:16] don't know.
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; You need to check what your children
[2:31:20] are.
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; The first time I was introduced to
[2:31:24] pornography, I think
[2:31:30] seventh grade.
[2:31:34] So in seventh grade they already know
[2:31:36] that
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; I was just too late to it. My friends
[2:31:41] already knew about that long time ago.
[2:31:51] That's a thing that he it really goes
[2:31:55] with a lot of
[2:31:57] young men and and sisters.
[2:32:05] But let me give you an advice to to help
[2:32:07] you overcome that.
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; You know that demon has most effect in
[2:32:12] you
[2:32:14] when you you are bored. You have nothing
[2:32:16] to do.
[2:32:19] You know I'm I'm not going to be like a
[2:32:20] saint. I dealt with the same thing too.
[2:32:23] God delivered me from that. So I'm
[2:32:25] talking to you from my experience.
[2:32:33] When you are bored, you have nothing to
[2:32:34] do. When your mind is getting quiet,
[2:32:39] then all of a sudden you are hearing the
[2:32:41] the voice of the devil.
[2:32:46] &gt;&gt; So get busy.
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; Get busy.
[2:32:53] word.
[2:32:57] If you are bored, call someone on the
[2:32:58] phone.
[2:33:01] Pray,
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; read the word.
[2:33:05] Why? Because when you constant, the
[2:33:06] Bible says whatsoever is of good virtue
[2:33:10] of good report. Think on those things.
[2:33:14] Then why? Because when you think on
[2:33:16] those things, the Bible says that he
[2:33:17] will keep him in perfect peace. He that
[2:33:20] keeps his mind stayed on me.
[2:33:35] That's for that that's demon. Another
[2:33:38] demon that's coming to my mind again.
[2:33:43] I I've had some people telling me that I
[2:33:45] shouldn't talk about it because I'm not
[2:33:46] married. But I'm going to talk about it
[2:33:49] anyway. Husband beating their wives.
[2:33:56] That's a demon.
[2:34:01] &gt;&gt; It's a demon.
[2:34:02] &gt;&gt; Who is that person that want to hurts
[2:34:04] their sweetheart?
[2:34:11] &gt;&gt; It's a demon.
[2:34:13] Husband, when you mistreat your wife,
[2:34:14] it's a demon.
[2:34:17] Wife, when you are disobedient to your
[2:34:18] husband, it's a demon.
[2:34:22] But one when I'm going to take it in a
[2:34:24] deeper place where like you don't even
[2:34:26] think that those have consequences on
[2:34:28] your children
[2:34:32] in this church
[2:34:35] one time. God is my witness. I had one
[2:34:37] child
[2:34:39] who came to me innocently.
[2:34:42] She's probably seven or six. I don't
[2:34:44] know. She's a kid. What does she know?
[2:34:48] And she's telling me, "Oh, yesterday
[2:34:52] &gt;&gt; daddy beat mom
[2:34:54] and he punched her. He threw her. He
[2:34:57] threw her off the stairs."
[2:35:04] And I know who the brother is because I
[2:35:06] know his child.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; Now imagine your children growing. So
[2:35:12] you do it do it in secret. But why do
[2:35:15] you why are you letting your children
[2:35:16] see that?
[2:35:20] What are you telling? You have
[2:35:21] daughters. What are you telling your
[2:35:22] daughters that it's okay for a man to to
[2:35:24] put their hands on a woman?
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; So then that's why it's getting passed
[2:35:28] from generation to generation
[2:35:30] generation. That now it gets to a place
[2:35:32] where when a when a man beats a wife,
[2:35:34] she just thinks that that's normal.
[2:35:37] One time I remember there was ONE SISTER
[2:35:40] IN THIS CHURCH too who told me that it's
[2:35:42] normal for a husband to beat their wife
[2:35:46] because we women sometimes we are ahead.
[2:35:51] She told me that
[2:35:55] but that's not the message.
[2:36:00] I'm sorry if there are any sisters
[2:36:02] getting beat by the husband.
[2:36:05] Pray for him.
[2:36:08] Pray for him. Still be respectful to
[2:36:10] him. Doesn't mean that if he beat you,
[2:36:11] you have to be disrespectful.
[2:36:14] You still be that genuine Christian to
[2:36:15] him and God is going to work on him.
[2:36:26] I
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; I don't really talk about women beating
[2:36:28] their husband because I I just hope
[2:36:29] that's not the case.
[2:36:33] I really hope we don't have sisters who
[2:36:35] beat their husband,
[2:36:38] but it's another thing. They might not
[2:36:40] physically beat their husband,
[2:36:43] &gt;&gt; but they can't be leading their house.
[2:36:48] That's not the order of the Bible. In
[2:36:51] the Bible, a man is supposed to be the
[2:36:53] leader of the house.
[2:36:55] The woman, you are supposed to be
[2:36:56] submissive to the man.
[2:37:00] But I'm not going to get deep into that.
[2:37:04] &gt;&gt; No, it wasn't in my notes. But
[2:37:08] &gt;&gt; what else? I'm trying to see if there's
[2:37:09] any other demons that's escaping.
[2:37:21] gossiping.
[2:37:25] [applause]
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; That's another demon that's killing the
[2:37:28] church.
[2:37:32] &gt;&gt; And to be honest, all of us are guilty
[2:37:34] of it here.
[2:37:38] But God is not pleased with that. We are
[2:37:41] not going to walk forward with gospel
[2:37:45] talking bad about your brother, your
[2:37:46] sister.
[2:37:49] If you don't have the courage to go talk
[2:37:50] to them,
[2:37:52] pray for them. What's even worse, we
[2:37:55] don't even just gossip among just as
[2:37:57] believers,
[2:38:00] &gt;&gt; but you even take it to the unbelievers
[2:38:02] outside.
[2:38:07] &gt;&gt; We got to kill that demon.
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; I'll read the last words and we'll just
[2:38:12] Thank you for being patient with me.
[2:38:18] The prophet said in a message once more,
[2:38:24] &gt;&gt; he said, "You had better destroy your
[2:38:25] enemy before your enemy destroys you.
[2:38:30] &gt;&gt; Bring back the oldfashioned prayer
[2:38:33] meetings,
[2:38:36] the real godly repentance,
[2:38:40] repentance.
[2:38:42] That's what the message of the hour is
[2:38:44] doing.
[2:38:45] returning our hearts to godly
[2:38:48] repentance.
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; The all night altar service.
[2:38:57] I'll stop here. The all night altar
[2:38:59] service.
[2:39:02] Restoring the altar service in your
[2:39:03] homes.
[2:39:08] Let's not be too busy. parents
[2:39:14] the same way you you try to make sure
[2:39:16] you you schedule your day so that oh you
[2:39:19] know we can do this thing we can go to
[2:39:22] this place and I can work around this
[2:39:23] time my wife works around this time we
[2:39:25] do this you arrange things that way make
[2:39:29] room for Christ in that arrangement
[2:39:32] arrange a time where it's it's a family
[2:39:35] time with God
[2:39:37] not just everybody alone
[2:39:39] Dad, you sit with the wife,
[2:39:42] &gt;&gt; with the children,
[2:39:45] &gt;&gt; pray together.
[2:39:48] &gt;&gt; Get your children to get used to
[2:39:50] praying.
[2:39:54] &gt;&gt; Cuz I I know I know how kids are.
[2:39:57] I would never pray if nobody if my dad
[2:39:59] didn't make us.
[2:40:02] I would be busy watching my stuff or
[2:40:03] like playing my games and all the stuff.
[2:40:08] restoring the altar in the house
[2:40:13] where the mom used to read Bible stories
[2:40:16] to her children.
[2:40:22] &gt;&gt; Most of the Bible stories that I know
[2:40:23] Ruth Naomi,
[2:40:26] Esther, Moses, I didn't know about it
[2:40:28] from the Bible.
[2:40:31] I learned about that from my mom.
[2:40:36] I remember I used to love the story of
[2:40:38] Esther.
[2:40:41] My mom used to read us all those
[2:40:42] stories.
[2:40:45] &gt;&gt; I hope that's what every mother's just
[2:40:47] doing.
[2:40:49] Don't leave it up to just your the
[2:40:51] oldest person in your house. Oh, this
[2:40:54] person take care of that. No, she didn't
[2:40:57] ask. She didn't bring those people into
[2:41:00] life.
[2:41:02] you. It was your choice to bring them
[2:41:04] here and it's your responsibility to
[2:41:07] take care of them. The prophet says that
[2:41:09] the mother is the sixth gospel.
[2:41:14] The fifth gospel. My bad. My bad. Fifth.
[2:41:17] Yeah. Fifth is a six sense. I confused.
[2:41:19] The fifth gospel.
[2:41:22] You know what does that mean?
[2:41:25] You are the gospel to your children.
[2:41:28] Amen.
[2:41:30] &gt;&gt; It doesn't even need to be every day. On
[2:41:32] the weekend, speak one day in the week
[2:41:34] where the kids know that this is Bible
[2:41:36] story time.
[2:41:43] Oh, Pentecost, hear me.
[2:41:46] Leave. Leave this corruption that
[2:41:49] Jezebel has worked among you.
[2:41:53] Leave it. leave it quickly
[2:41:56] and return back to the word of the Lord.
[2:42:00] The prophet is begging us, live quickly,
[2:42:03] &gt;&gt; away from this Hollywood showmanship.
[2:42:11] &gt;&gt; The message is here to take us away from
[2:42:13] the Hollywood showmanship.
[2:42:18] &gt;&gt; We are creators of creatures of heaven.
[2:42:21] &gt;&gt; Creatures of heaven.
[2:42:23] I want to be influenced by the fashion
[2:42:25] of heaven.
[2:42:29] That's why sisters dress modestly.
[2:42:32] Brothers dress as brothers.
[2:42:37] But you know there's one thing I
[2:42:38] noticed. We have people believers of
[2:42:41] this message. We dress according to the
[2:42:44] fashion of the hour. I'm not against
[2:42:47] being getting well dressed.
[2:42:50] But my only problem is
[2:42:54] You are letting Hollywood tell you what
[2:42:56] is right and what is not.
[2:42:58] &gt;&gt; Why am I saying this?
[2:43:00] &gt;&gt; Because I remember there used to be a
[2:43:02] time,
[2:43:03] &gt;&gt; you know, it used to be a time that in
[2:43:05] fashion everybody was wearing teeny tiny
[2:43:07] pants.
[2:43:10] I remember even at school like like
[2:43:13] literally tight like this. I used I got
[2:43:16] into it at some point
[2:43:19] even though I shouldn't because I'm too
[2:43:20] skinny.
[2:43:24] But
[2:43:26] at that time that if you were seen with
[2:43:28] a baggy pants,
[2:43:32] &gt;&gt; they will make fun of you.
[2:43:35] &gt;&gt; They would say that oh no like oh my god
[2:43:38] you dress like an old person.
[2:43:40] Why? Because Hollywood said the fashion
[2:43:43] is to have skinny tight pants.
[2:43:47] And we believers have results.
[2:43:53] Hollywood says tight pent is good. Yes
[2:43:55] sir.
[2:43:59] &gt;&gt; But now Hollywood comes back again and
[2:44:02] now it's fashion to wear baggy pants.
[2:44:05] And we even see people wearing pants
[2:44:07] like you would is this a skirt or a
[2:44:08] pants?
[2:44:12] No, they you know cuz I back in No, they
[2:44:15] didn't even used to wear if someone
[2:44:17] would wear a big pants that would be big
[2:44:19] but not like a skirt pants.
[2:44:22] But now Hollywood take took it even
[2:44:24] further
[2:44:28] and now people come to church like that.
[2:44:30] I'm It's not wrong. I'm not against
[2:44:31] that. But I'm only against you thinking
[2:44:34] it's right because Hollywood made it
[2:44:36] right.
[2:44:42] The prophet says away from that
[2:44:44] Hollywood showmanship.
[2:44:49] We are not here to follow Hollywood. We
[2:44:52] are here to follow the word.
[2:44:57] Turn with your This is my last quote.
[2:44:59] Turn with your whole heart
[2:45:03] back to the word of God.
[2:45:06] Turn back to the power of the Holy
[2:45:08] Ghost.
[2:45:10] You women dress like,
[2:45:14] &gt;&gt; no tight clothes,
[2:45:19] dress like sisters,
[2:45:22] no skirts that when you sit, we have to
[2:45:24] see your knees.
[2:45:27] I've said it before,
[2:45:29] you know. I think these days it has
[2:45:31] gotten better.
[2:45:33] Because it used to be like when you see
[2:45:35] it back in the back there.
[2:45:38] &gt;&gt; You have to constantly tell your eyes
[2:45:40] used to look up and see
[2:45:46] that's that's that's psychologist.
[2:45:48] That's not right. We don't come to
[2:45:50] church. We have so many battles out
[2:45:51] there. We don't come to church to start
[2:45:54] having battles here again. This is
[2:45:56] supposed to be a safe place.
[2:46:05] Don't try don't don't show off your body
[2:46:07] here at church.
[2:46:09] This is not a place to show off your
[2:46:11] body. Dress like a sister
[2:46:14] &gt;&gt; and men dress like a man
[2:46:22] even even us even fashion like I
[2:46:25] remember there used to be a time you
[2:46:26] wear a pants that's so high up up here.
[2:46:30] They call it dongi, right? Is that how
[2:46:32] they call it? Or like I forgot the word.
[2:46:35] There was a term for it.
[2:46:38] You know, like they will make fun of you
[2:46:40] because you wear something small
[2:46:43] because Hollywood said now that is good.
[2:46:48] Now that became good for the believer
[2:46:51] but what the word says good we don't
[2:46:53] know
[2:46:59] back to the word you men acts like a man
[2:47:01] like sons and daughters of God turn oh
[2:47:04] turn from this Jezebel system that's
[2:47:06] shocking you and blinding you God help
[2:47:10] us to have a true repentance
[2:47:14] you may stand God help us to have a True
[2:47:19] repentance.
[2:47:22] That's what we want in this church.
[2:47:24] [snorts] True repentance, not
[2:47:27] halfheartedly.
[2:47:29] You can't do it.
[2:47:32] I don't want immediate repentance.
[2:47:36] God wants a a full repentance.
[2:47:42] How I think today that at this very
[2:47:44] moment,
[2:47:46] when my time is up,
[2:47:48] we should stand to our feet
[2:47:52] and cry with our hands in the air,
[2:47:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, once more.
[2:47:58] Once more, oh Lord, once more.
[2:48:02] He said, let's stand.
[2:48:05] everybody that's willing to do it.
[2:48:12] Now, that's I'm repeating the the
[2:48:14] prophet's words to you.
[2:48:16] Everybody that's ready to die,
[2:48:25] everybody that want to see a revival,
[2:48:29] do you want to see a revival in your
[2:48:30] life?
[2:48:32] The prophecies true revival is to get
[2:48:34] the trash out of your life.
[2:48:38] Do you want to
[2:49:27] You got to give that up.
[2:49:29] Every die. How many want to die to see
[2:49:33] the power of God come to Zion
[2:49:37] and with joy?
[2:49:39] All his holy mountains nothing hurts sh
[2:49:42] or shall destroy.
[2:49:45] He says let's raise our hands.
[2:49:49] and cry once more, Lord.
[2:49:54] &gt;&gt; The Jesus that spoke this word is here
[2:49:55] in this building right now.
[2:50:00] &gt;&gt; And if you want a move of God in your
[2:50:02] life, raise your hand and start praying.
[2:50:06] Say once more, Lord.
[2:50:09] Once more, Lord.
[2:50:11] Lord, send the Holy Ghost
[2:50:15] &gt;&gt; with a mighty rushing wind like you did
[2:50:17] on the day of Pentecost.
[2:50:20] &gt;&gt; Lord, once more.
[2:50:23] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to see you move in my life.
[2:50:27] Lord, once more.
[2:50:35] Lord, once more.
[2:50:45] Looking for a coordination.
[2:51:03] Oh Lord.
[2:51:11] You can start singing.
[2:51:18] Oh [music]
[2:51:25] my
[2:51:31] god.
[2:51:45] I must tell Jesus
[2:51:51] [music]
[2:51:51] all of my problem.
[2:51:57] &gt;&gt; Let me let me read this before we
[2:51:58] continue. The prophet says in the
[2:52:00] message of grace,
[2:52:02] he says, "Let me say this, my senior
[2:52:04] friend.
[2:52:05] You may be here this morning a
[2:52:07] prostitute.
[2:52:09] You may be here this morning a woman
[2:52:11] chaser.
[2:52:13] You may be here a drunkard or a gambler
[2:52:17] or a murderer.
[2:52:19] You may be here as an impure husband,
[2:52:22] an impure wife. You might be the vilest
[2:52:26] of sinner."
[2:52:28] and you say, "I am past that stage of
[2:52:30] redemption."
[2:52:32] He says, "No, you are not."
[2:52:35] You wouldn't be at church this morning.
[2:52:39] You are not past stage of redemption
[2:52:42] or you wouldn't be here this morning.
[2:52:44] Grace will make a way for you in this
[2:52:47] dark hour if you will just accept it.
[2:52:52] Accept the Lord Jesus Christ and he's
[2:52:54] yours. Let's keep singing.
[2:52:57] Am I still Jesus?
[2:53:03] Oh Lord, I cannot bear
[2:53:05] [singing and music]
[2:53:07] my
[2:53:10] burdens
[2:53:12] alone. [singing]
[2:53:16] I must tell [music]
[2:53:18] Jesus.

[2:54:45] all of my trials.
[2:54:51] I cannot

[3:01:47] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[3:01:51] [music]
[3:02:04] I must tell Jesus.
[3:02:07] Have you told him all your problems?
[3:02:13] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that he's looking for
[3:02:14] those that will worship him in spirit
[3:02:16] and truth.
[3:02:20] &gt;&gt; So you can't just sing a song and don't
[3:02:21] mean it.
[3:02:25] I must tell Jesus.
[3:02:28] What are your problems?
[3:02:31] &gt;&gt; What do you need?
[3:02:33] &gt;&gt; Tell Jesus all your problems.
[3:02:37] Tell Jesus all your wants.
[3:02:41] &gt;&gt; I cannot bear my burdens alone.
[3:02:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus can help you.
[3:02:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus alone.
[3:02:49] &gt;&gt; Why?
[3:02:51] &gt;&gt; Because he's the great Chilobo.

[3:05:41] &gt;&gt; Dear heavenly father, Lord Jesus,
[3:05:46] &gt;&gt; the beginning and the end,
[3:05:50] the Alpha and the Omega.
[3:05:53] &gt;&gt; You are a God who keeps your word.
[3:05:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, you kept your word and you are
[3:05:59] here this morning.
[3:06:02] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord, I thank you for
[3:06:04] your word that's been preached this
[3:06:05] morning.
[3:06:07] Lord, the mission of Malachi 4 was to
[3:06:10] take our hearts back to the heart
[3:06:12] [music] of repentance.
[3:06:16] Lord, I trust that the word that was
[3:06:18] preached, Lord, pierced our hearts.
[3:06:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, you heard the cry of your
[3:06:25] children.
[3:06:27] &gt;&gt; Lord, you heard the confession of your
[3:06:30] children.
[3:06:32] Lord, I pray that you be merciful to
[3:06:34] them. Now,
[3:06:37] Lord, your prophet told us that if we
[3:06:38] thoroughly repent that you will forgive
[3:06:40] us.
[3:06:43] Lord, you said that though your sins may
[3:06:45] be red as a crimson,
[3:06:48] I will make them white as snow.
[3:06:51] No, we came in here as bad men. We came
[3:06:54] here as bad women, but Lord, we want to
[3:06:57] go out as good men, as good women.
[3:07:02] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, I pray that
[3:07:03] you forgive our trespasses.
[3:07:07] That you forgive our iniquities, Lord
[3:07:08] Jesus.
[3:07:10] I pray that father lord whatever chain
[3:07:12] or or grips that the devil had over your
[3:07:15] children
[3:07:18] &gt;&gt; I pray father lord Jesus that you set
[3:07:20] them free lord
[3:07:22] &gt;&gt; I pray father lord that you deliver them
[3:07:24] from their afflictions Lord Jesus
[3:07:27] I pray that father lord that the power
[3:07:29] of god Lord Jesus may fall upon each and
[3:07:32] every one of their hearts
[3:07:34] don't just stop at the head don't just
[3:07:37] stop at the spirit but pierce all the
[3:07:39] way down to the soul, all the way down
[3:07:42] to the heart and bring real change in in
[3:07:45] our people's lives. Let the higher
[3:07:47] ground tabernacle, Lord, be a different
[3:07:50] church, Lord, because we have welcomed
[3:07:52] you in our hearts, Lord Jesus. Lord, we
[3:07:55] welcome you in our lives, Lord Jesus. We
[3:07:57] welcome you in our secret places, Lord,
[3:07:59] in our secret chambers, Lord. May you
[3:08:02] come, Lord. May we feast with you Lord

[3:08:10] our homes Lord help us to go make things
[3:08:13] right so that Father Lord that next time
[3:08:16] we take communion we can see Lord that
[3:08:19] the word took effect Lord Jesus and
[3:08:22] Father Lord we also don't want any
[3:08:24] hindrance
[3:08:25] your prophet told us that if there are
[3:08:27] people that haven't confessed
[3:08:29] and refuse to confess their sins they
[3:08:32] can cause the church from going forward.
[3:08:35] They can they can cause the people from
[3:08:37] getting delivered.
[3:08:39] They can stop the people from getting
[3:08:41] healed. Lord, we don't want that. Lord
[3:08:44] Jesus, Lord, whoever those people are, I
[3:08:47] pray that you expose them. Whoever those
[3:08:49] people that don't want to make their
[3:08:51] life right with you, they don't want to
[3:08:53] change. I pray father that you expose
[3:08:56] them, Lord, because we want to move
[3:08:58] forward. I pray that you also help them
[3:09:00] Lord Jesus. Maybe just a stony heart.
[3:09:04] And I pray that you break that stony
[3:09:05] heart that you give them a heart of
[3:09:08] flesh. Oh, the Bible tells us that God
[3:09:11] is a consuming fire. Lord, may you may
[3:09:14] you burn that stony heart to become a
[3:09:18] fleshy heart.
