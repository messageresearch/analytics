TRANSCRIPT
========================================
laughs at the law told me uh and nothing was seeing the vision let him that reader run amen and I've been running and I'm not tired yeah well get tired but we think our for His grace and His mercy and surely God has been good to us as we stand we'll work over to Roman's 9 Romans I will pick up where we left off tonight this morning Romans 9 one thing I love about the message it's just to me it's clear it makes sense if that makes sense it just I don't see where people make it so complicated because everything God reveals he real Veals it by way of simplicity it's mankind who make things complicated and complex they saw try to scientific fie the message in a way you know like it's something mystical it's not it is a mystery that needs to be revealed but there is not mystical it's plain and simple we think our Forge grace Romans 9 beginning at the eighth verse that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed for this is the word of promise at this time will I come and Sara shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that call it it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger and as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated let us pray father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us and Lord I pray this evening that you would bless us touch our tired flesh strengthen us in our bodies in spirit and father would be careful to give you the praise glory naanum in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated a lot of times we I guess we don't see the word in the way that it should be seen and I'm not speaking about everybody but I think if we thought about promise when it comes to God promising something that those promises are unconditionally if God says he's gonna do something he's going to do it it might as well just counted to be done and you and I must know that God when he brought us to this light and that's exactly what it is as light it's a revelation it's is identity when you can see yourself in the scripture and you can identify with yourself in that scripture you can see that God has opened your eyes to who you really are the thing that I love about Calvary is because Calvary cleared up everything it was the blood of Jesus Christ that was accepted before God as our perpetuation it was the blood of Jesus Christ and atoned us is his blood of Jesus Christ that set us free and so that's why the Bible saying it's not him now willeth know he that runneth but God who shows mercy I think that when a person is truly born again and really seen exactly what God is doing with him there is no room for pride because that individual understands that he he holds his position only by the grace of God it is God who raises up in God who brings down and in all of this I I think about like I said today or this morning when I think about Jesus and how he had all of the disappointments he had his disciples that constantly were bickering between one another and trying to see he was going to be the greatest among them and all of the things that day Jesus had to deal with you know who's gonna be the first and then on top of that I think about it sometime I think now when that lady came to Jesus and says lord I would that my son said one sit on the right hand and one sit on the left that had that I guarantee you whatever the Lord was going through that was the devil trying to punch him with something you know you know what I'm saying that last little thing that really gets to you and I was thinking to myself I said you know to me what a selfish question what a request as as if her sons and evidently I don't know whether it was pride whatever I don't know what the lady was thinking but she could not have really understood who he really was if she would just to ask a question and such to be honest with you I appreciate and I think and I believe that we all do we appreciate where God has us somebody might say oh I just wish I was a prophet no I'm glad to be exactly where I am and then I know how in myself if I could could have gotten out of this I would have gotten out of it because the truth of the matter is wherever God places you there is a lot of pressure there is a lot of things that goes with it it just doesn't come as easy as people think think about when God ordained Joseph gave him visions and all of that and all of the commotion and all of the stuff he had to go through it was not his choice it was God's choice so every storm he went through was handcrafted for Joseph and to bring Joseph to perfection and you know the thing that I love about it because I look at Stephen I look at Jesus I look at Joseph and I think the the the last tests that they all three had in common was forgiveness they had to forgive their brethren of their transgressions and I think about all of the things that we go through now I think the greatest thing that we can do when someone transgress us is to forgive now we we talk about promises because even when Jacob though God said Jacob I love Esau I hated Jacob was a shyster think about it God knew he was a shyster and for whatever reason and I don't know how else to say it but when Jacob was at his father-in-law house the angel told Jacob how to which will say shyster I don't know the angel told Jacob how to get more crop how how do you say that you know to me but it was it was it didn't it to the mentor I'm sure there's a great revelation behind it but his crop grew grew grew grew grew far greater than his father-in-law because the angel helped him and showed him what to put in the water that would change the spotted cows or the spotted whatever and you look at all of these things and God knew but you see what I'm trying to say is that when you are chosen and elected of God they're going to be a lot of things that we will do wrong but it doesn't change the position that you hold in God you understand me because the position in which you hold we hold in God was given to us we're an asteroid it was given to us and therefore if God has positionally placed you in the Word of God as his bride nothing you can do on earth that will change that only because God has made the decision it's not him nor will it know he that running for God that shows mercy not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord it's whom God has chosen and we can weaken they said who knows the mind of God as I read this morning is there anybody that's gonna counsel him and there anybody that could tell him that he's made a mistake or is anybody they can render their help to him so he can repay them no God is in control he's the only potentate he's the only lawgiver and however God judges is righteous is holy God can never make a mistake you understand me you and I must realize by God's grace that the purpose there's a purpose that all of us like I said we're connected who would have thought I would be here in Iowa but God by foreknowledge saw me making the trip he saw look what he did brought Frank all the way from the Congo because he was needed here but we were connected even then but we didn't know we were connected see and God didn't bring people from here and there you know connecting us why because in his mind though we have we were all in different countries different places there's a eternal connection and he knew at some point in time he would bring this all together as part of his purpose none of us can can refute or argue with God's election because God is perfect he doesn't have a second choice he doesn't say well if you don't work out I'll get someone else no God's choice his first choice is always the right choice and you said what do you mean I mean to serve his main purpose right you say well what do you mean let me say it like this God had in his mind to make David King way before they elected Saul and Saul was the people's choice but David was God's choice and God you saw to show the people that if they would have acknowledged him and kept the word they would have never had a song but because people get in their all minds and they're always thinking they have a better way God said go ahead o see and they went on and what this all do Saul did everything Samuel said that he would do and Sam you said okay you own the king but this King is gonna make slaves out of your own children your children excuse me tell you what we will do and Saul did all of those things and you say what brothers what are you trying to say I'm trying to say that God when he when it's all said and done we will be the one that's in all God is not going to be surprised at it because he's already seen the finished product of you and me will be the ones that's in all old and then you'll see that those are the Falls and those little scrapes bruises or whatever you did make was for your own benefit right sometimes God has to let us go in certain areas and certain places in our lives just to toughen us up you know we look at this thing in and I love to say I love the word because the Bible says born of color uncorruptible incorruptible I love that because I understand that the seed that I was born with in the natural is corruptible it was corrupted when I got it because of Adam and Eve it was corrupted but we find out that there's an incorruptible seed which is Jesus Christ himself did you put that seed in you did the preacher preacher than you or did Jesus planning in you before the foundation of the world he planted in you hallelujah you didn't ask for it he gave it to you hallelujah by his own counseling by his own wheel by his own desire Amen to see God in you become great you understand me God is in you to do what excuse me he's in you to become great oh now that sounds really strange but God loves to take nothing and make something out of it the Bible says being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever that life in itself is God life in you oh I love this thing because you got to realize that when God said be fruitful and multiply he had even himself in mind it was God's desire to bring forth of his kind that's why I can't fail if the first creation though it failed the second creation cannot it was God's design his own will he knew it was going to fall but with God being the law having a law of contrasts Amen did all of this so what so the true creation the real thing can have his glory is that right think about it because really you take about we always said the firstborn the firstborn the firstborn but here it was Cain was the firstborn but who got the benefits Abel right Oh Jacob and Esau but who got the benefits you see them saying something is something about that second one that God works with right and you - Oh brothers you know what is it all about God is a God of contrasts he knows what he's doing and he looks at us and he says oh look at all the people look at look this is what gets me because it was a powerful church when brother Branham was here it was powerful those who believed they saw they seen God do things that he had never done before but here we told we were told that the bride of Jesus Christ she superseded not one man but the body of Jesus Christ he is that right the body of Jesus Christ is symbol in symbol or type is Elijah and Elijah did twice as many miracles as Elijah and we look at this thing in which all but what are you trying to say now we are the ones that will see a translation right a changing we are going to see the completion of God's transforming power that God will transform us from this old natural man to a supernatural man and the two lives the two difference in not only just appearance but life itself is a million miles or more apart because one is eternal and one is natural and to think that God can take a sinful piece of clay and make it holy that's God's presence being in his presence look at the Angels the cherubims or seraphim's and all of them that's hallelujah up there and heaven all they can do is say holy holy holy holy holy amen why because they are in that Shekinah presence that's the kind of glory hallelujah and that's where God wants us as believers to live in that Shekinah glory now in order to live there you gonna have to fight to get there hallelujah you always got something or someone out there trying to pull you out from under the shekinah and you know what the Bible tells us that's why Paul said who shall separate me from the love of God what shall sir she have tribulation of famine persecution or whatever he said there is nothing that can separate me from the love of God that we might have friends who cut us off we may have friends who say I don't love you no more but that God will never tell you that when God said in his heart and his mind to love you nothing can change it hmm nothing can change you hallelujah think about it the grass with us and I love this part was because that's he said the grass withers and the flowers and the glory of man as the flowers of grass and that's so true everything here is so temporal look at all the people who gained all of those money millionaires billionaires it and then in a short moment of time they die and leave everything and they find themselves in a place where they're naked have nothing to cover their nakedness with money can't buy you nothing on the other side hallelujah think about it but here the Word of God comes to cover our nakedness I love that because you know without the word you're naked and that word has come to cover our nakedness you see my brother that's why they hide me in that cleft of the rock Lord cover me Lord so that my sin will not appear can you can you say your flesh isn't sinful all of our flesh is sinful but because of the covering because of the blood of Jesus Christ God only see the righteousness of Christ what up what a blessing what a promise that's what keeps me going when Satan tried to say oh you're not gonna make it you ain't this and you ain't that or however you know how his lies of gospel lies you got one statement you need to make God promise that'll shut him up because he knows no matter what he tries to do think about it look at all the things that he tried to take to get the men of God in trouble he made David do what he did right you know you look at you look at Moses he ends up killing a man cuz God knew you know the devil knew that Moses was chosen to be the deliverer he makes the man upset and he takes his life as if that's gonna change the mind of God Peter he denied Jesus Christ three times under the influence of the devil and the devil thought that was gonna change God's mind about Peter nothing can change the mind of God about you those of us who are chosen and elected to be the bride of Jesus Christ nothing hallelujah Oh God is so good she win election calls and this is what I'm this is what really gets me because God don't just call you and then when you when you when you respond he doesn't answer but God calls when you respond he answers to the call and it from that point on God takes you from point A to point Z Z is your completion and God will do it ha because you answered and you said yes remember there's a parallel about the men who who said Lord you know Lord Father I'll do it I'll do it and then he changed his mind then there was one says no I ain't going and all of a sudden he changed his mind and Jesus said which one did the will of the Father the one who changed his mind who said he wasn't gonna go but he win anyway right come on when you think about it you think about all the scriptures that we go through all of the things we've seen in our lives you think now who was this Jonah guy who actually got upset with God god damn blessed him and gave him a Gorge to hide the heat and as soon as the gorge died he gets mad with God does it make sense but it wasn't gonna change God's mind about him God knows we're nothing but flesh he knows we're nothing but clay you know God pity us at times and I know sometimes he feel like kicking us around but thank God he doesn't when we think about how God has been so good to us you know I love it the way Jeremiah says in the 29th chapter he said for I know the thoughts that I think toward you God ain't confused hallelujah God ain't confused when he looked at he looked at job and said Satan have you considered my servant job hallelujah joke did devil said well you know I I caused him to curse you and you didn't face God say it ain't gonna happen why I know what he's made out of that's what I'm saying God knows the material we made out of it ain't you that he have confidence in it's the material we made out of I'm not talking about the flesh-and-blood part I'm talking about the God part and God knows himself better than any of us you know and you think it's the oh lord have mercy he said I know my thoughts said the Lord thoughts of peace not of evil to give you an expected in so God is not up there standing there trying to find out how to make you sick and how to make you frustrated now he doesn't have those thoughts it's Lucifer or the devil that comes to God amen to say let me tempt him here and let me tempt him there however the case may be but when you when it boils down to it it's almost sound - like they say too good to be true we're already perfect we are already perfect in the eyes of God we are already perfect it's not your perfection its Christ's perfect perfection like I said a mountain can't be holy if the holy God is not on the mountain it's the holy God that makes us holy it's the perfect God in us that makes them makes us perfect right that's why the bombs just no weapon formed against you shall prosper none not one no weapon I love that the Bible even tells us that even in that day of judgment no voice will be heard no matter what they cook usual they can't win they can't win no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper in every tongue that shall rise against the in judgment thou shalt condemn I love it he said this is the heritage of the servant of the Lord and their righteousness is of misa their righteousness is of me I don't have my own everything our own is of God everything hallelujah if there be any credit everything goes back to him hallelujah mm-hmm think about it but the man who was telling the story about himself and he said had not God stepped in and I'm just paraphrasing it he said my daddy was an alcoholic and he said more than likely I was gonna be one too see because I was going to inherit his demon basically it's what he's saying but God rich in mercy he broke that chain he stopped that thing he called me sanctified me gave me the Holy Ghost can you imagine he said listen all my brand all of the branham's were a riotous people they did all kinds of stuff he said I've got nothing to brag on he said only thing I have to brag Jesus Christ himself and that's the way I feel ain't nothing in my family line I can brag on the only thing I could do is hide my face because of a shame hallelujah but there's one person I can brag on and that's Jesus Christ himself he's always been there for me Alleluia hallelujah you know sometime as I said earlier we got to be careful that this message doesn't become a science you can't figure it out and you can't work it out hallelujah this is a life hallelujah you understand me it is life that makes us who we are God's life is what makes us who we are is not your works are your doing is his life the prophet of God was talking about birds he said you know every bird has their own characteristic and I can tell what kind of bird it is by the way it flies or by the way it sounds but every bird has his own characteristic that distinguishes distinguishes them from other birds or another bird and he was liking that as people he said don't you know he said that's what makes it that's the difference between the sinner and the saint it's the characteristics they may look like what they could be twins one can be saved and one can be unsafe you understand me and they're the way they behave the way they act the way they do is what determines who they are and that's how it is with the Christian it's not about church it's not about half a for you here and how faith you there is the light that you live is all about life it's all about the Shekinah glory it's all about what Adam lost in the beginning and that was the life that God gave him that which was a covering for him hallelujah that's right he said but today we're not born under that parent Tobin denominations he said our parent is the word I like that our parent is the word this is my mama and my daddy lujah yes sir our parent is the word that's right I was born under God to for that age but this is the climax this is the age beyond anomic this is what I'm trying to tell people this is the age that is beyond denominations we can't settle into a denominational or spirit of denominations we must fight that and go forward into perfection Oh they've never seen it before but somebody gotta declare it somebody gotta say email to the Word of God somebody got to come to a place and then when they believe that God promised it and that promises has to happen that's what it was when Seymour Seymour saw the scripture he saw wherein they were gifts they saw he saw the the axe he saw all of the gifts and they all those people was undaunted other than that inspiration and they kept pressing into an Impreza dent to it impressing into it and that's how we got a zoo zoo Street because somebody believed it enough to keep moving even though people were calling them crazy many of them left without food they live without food and proper clothing but they were their minds were set only heavenly things and they were not gonna settle for anything less until his bride get to that place we're not gonna settle for ritualistic services as individuals we're gonna press into it it's out there for us we just got to go beyond that veil of unbelief that's holding us back see listen so we beyond those things there had to come forth must come forth God ordained did so and there must come forth is that right how long was the book of Revelation written all those things hidden mysteries and God said in Malachi 4 that it was going to come a messenger in the book for hundreds of years but it could not stop the purpose of God when that time and that season came Malachi 4:2 and if Malachi 4 was here in the days of Noah and Sodom was here and if those days were here then Malachi 4 still had to be revealed because there must come a burning of the world fire has to come and if the fire has to come there must be a people who's going to escape the fire they're here we are here and somewhere in our minds we've got that we got to keep calling on the name of the Lord Jesus until God makes it happen because that's what he wants they couldn't they would have never gotten out of Egypt if they would have kept sitting there oh well God will deliver some time but that was not the way it happened God said I have heard your cry somebody help me whenever the people get down to pray something is going to change I have the Lord your cry and I have come down that's the way God works mm-hmm when God I appreciate the Lord because in the Old Testament when God had the shewbread and prayed that manner that was actually behind the curtain of time God sustained it by his presence kind of like the word you know nothing to change it nothing can make it fail regardless to what age is in is always fresh and thinking about every general it had to be some good bridge you know they talked about it it had to be some good bread and I can imagine those priests could neither wait to get in there just to eat of that brand and here we have not in type the reality of what they had in tight manner and not spirit the bread is supposed to be as sweet and it's nice and it's holy to us as it was to them in the natural hallelujah it was so good people were that God told them not to hold hold it overnight how many times you've done that in a natural food is so good and you don't just throw it away you have what we call leftovers but God told him not to do it worms gonna get in it but it had to be good for them the wound the hole don't do it see that's what we must understand there's so many great things in this message and some of these things we've got to move forward in you understand me good when we saw that God would use Malachi for brother Banda was used by him a mighty prophet he meant on the face of the earth but now we must move on because the bride to move is on the bride then double of Norton has been on Dane for us I believe that oh I believe that God knows I believe that and I'm waiting I'm waiting with patience that God because God is gonna do it I can almost taste it he's coming with it hallelujah y'all know I'm saying there's a minute times you hadn't even seen the chicken in this in the kitchen but you smell it before you get there hallelujah that's all I'm talking about I could smell it it is I can see it coming how Oh God have mercy upon us oh my when the Holy Ghost came down and people received the gifts of God and oh my it's amazing how those people just had you know such an anointing they were staggering and drunken in the Holy Ghost and here with all of this word when have you last seen somebody drunk off the Holy Ghost you know what I mean I mean these people did they weren't ashamed y'all gotta understand in my day those people that went to those Pentecostal churches and apostolic churches they were laughed at marked at pointed and laughter people laugh at them not even knowing they were blaspheme in the Holy Spirit yeah it was not a good holiness oh man what how did you get into that mess that's the way they talk hallelujah not even realizing those people sent a real foundation call him Chuck whatever you want to call at least a shucks was shucks they did what they supposed to do now that the charm of life is coming to the seed what are we doing it's gotta be more for us God did not bring us to a maturity to say hey here it is Oh taste and see that the Lord is good that's what it's all about God gonna hit this world I'm telling you people of God anything gonna be a worldwide thing like it was with the prophet of God but wherever the bride is it's going to be shaken and God is gonna do it with the final outpouring hallelujah that will also increase the faith of God in the people I believe it they're going to see a lot of little Jesus's running around here Hey defying gravity defying every natural phenomena they're going to be a people that will call those things that be not as though they were Abraham's seed will be on display for a short quick work I believe that with all my heart I don't believe God is perfecting us and bringing us into this perfection Amen just to say okay we're done let's go hallelujah every good cake baked must be tasted hey how you gonna know what's good if you don't taste it and that's where God is God is going to give a little taste and then we get up out of here I believe that oh lord have mercy father we look at this thing and you say okay we're coming to the holy place and we understand that the holy places where the seven golden candlesticks are but we know that that's not our stopping place God's taking us into the Holies of Holies and like the prophet of God said there's a time where we were forbidden to go back there because only the high priest could go but now that our high priest Jesus Christ himself has gone beyond the veil the veil has been rent it's open for us and now it's death if you stay out of there so we must go into the Holies of Holies because that's what God intended for us to be we are the house of God we're the tabernacle of the Most High God hallelujah and I heard the Prophet God say something the other day I had never heard I'm looking for Mount Zion showdown and he said Mount Zion showdown is happening right now we didn't even open up I'm waiting for the squeeze and all of this stuff and right now we are doing things that we don't even realize we're doing and it's reflecting the bride of Jesus Christ it's showing who is the real right when you no matter what they say about your no job when it's time for them to pray who do they come to right they know you real Christians who can get real things are done by God's grace hallelujah see but not only a hot people whosoever will can have that same anointing of the Shekinah glory and walk a holy life holy holy holy unto the Lord and approach in his very presence of God through the blood of Jesus Christ the for him right it ain't just a preacher its whosoever will you don't have to be a prophet whosoever will you can be a housewife you can be a mean you can be a janitor whosoever will can approach unto God into that Holies of Holies whoo Oh Revelation chapter 4 4 so we look at this thing is your brother Brooks the closing is just a bit but you and I must understand there's a transformation and that's that's the part that I'm trying to emphasize that we must allow God to transform us we must allow God to transform us but transformation can only only happen if the transformer as it's on the inside you can't be transformed if he ain't in there we don't want no fake pregnancy we need the real deal we need to know he said in that day you'll know I'm in the father the father's in me and I am in you it's got to be real and I'm telling you when you don't see a rising of the Sun in you something's wrong the Sun must rise hallelujah no matter what your experience is if it's a headache if it's it's trouble if it's upset if it's this that or the other you still walking in the light of God you're living in this a kind of glory living there where Jesus is in the in his presence that all things work together for good to them that love God and you'll love him and you're walking in that mellow soft sweet humble Christian life mm-hmm I like that mellow sweet humble and you could only find a few like that mellow sweet and humble come out rock it in their Christian life a if anything if anything I'll be saying lord help us preach us it's hard to find out how much sweet and mellow preacher oh yes the thing that I love about is this you can't I'm going to the blood transfusion you can't transfuse a pig blood with a cow only pigs can be dead blood can be transfused to the other a human being even that you have to be careful about because it must match whatever type of blood it is it must match but in it funny that no matter how what your type of blood is is in the natural God can give you a blood transfusion no matter what you are a B or C you don't be B+ whatever God can still transfuse you and after the transfusion that blood of Jesus changes you and transform you into a son of God and you will no longer be or a or whatever it is the blood of Jesus Christ that runs through your vein is the blood of God think about it so the only way that God can give a transfusion to a person that person must be of the same blood type amen so it and you so what do you mean that's where the seed come in because the seed itself is Christ and that blood seed must match his blood in order for him to give you a transfusion and you live mmm right so you look at these things and like I said this morning nothing costs is cheap and you were not cheap God paid the highest price there was for your yo Redemption in mind and that's what he did so we think about it and the prophet of God was talking about women and he said how difficult it is to get one like this he said a meek and humble spirit is a great treasure to God and the Bible said for a woman to adorn themselves with the meat and humble spirit subject to your husband's and sweetness that's what a great price is in the sight of God so you got to understand that's a great price it's costly but the reward for a woman if she can humble herself to that will be twice as much of the ban when we get over there think about it knowing by God's grace that God is doing a great work in us and I'm a closing just a minute one thing I know in my life I don't know by anybody else's life but the boy I press the more difficult things seem to become and the more you press the more you begin to see more unexpected it's always the unexpected things that sometime catches you where you have to stop for a moment and regroup and I think by God's grace that wants you when the state Satan comes in here a texture because he comes on sometimes Satan comes with an ambush surprises you and the only reason the only way that you will be defeated is that you allow the ambush to place fear within you because the Bible tells us that perfect love casts out fear and so when the fear comes in it takes the Holy Spirit in you to put fear where it belongs and once fears moved away you are the Conqueror right faith comes and takes over according to Isaiah 59 and and close on this so shall they fear on the nineteenth first the name of the Lord from the West and its glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him now that's the part I don't know I understand but my point is is why people don't want the spirit you know what is it that people don't want the Holy Ghost moving in the church see they don't mind him shouting and dancing that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about when the Holy Spirit moves and and and the word of God word of knowledge or whatever it is God comes right through the preaching and whatever discern your thoughts or identify the word you know the Holy Ghost is there cuz you know that when you leave out here you changed see that's what I try to tell people I'm not interested in being stirred I want to be changed the Word of God came to change us has come to change us from glory to glory to glory I want to see progress in me and the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them that turned from dregs transgression in Jacob said the Lord as for me this is my covenant with
