[6:50] of Jesus you love the Lord surely God is
[6:56] good to us I could remember now that our
[6:59] brother Isaac said he had to go
[7:00] travelling but you know we we appreciate
[7:03] him a lot of times you don't really know
[7:08] what you got until he's not here
[7:09] so we thank God for him even in his
[7:12] absence we appreciate him we're gonna go
[7:15] right into the Word of God surely God is
[7:20] good to us I'm
[7:25] for a change of the body one thing I
[7:32] love about the Lord he he allowed us to
[7:37] make the choice and he sealed us in by
[7:41] way of his choice and you our choice
[7:46] Amen because we we stayed with him in
[7:49] the beginning
[7:51] he's now standing with us now even
[7:55] though we don't remember it but there is
[7:58] something about the name of Jesus and
[8:04] what once he has done something for you
[8:07] you could never forget him as we stand
[8:12] we're going to come from st. John 10 and
[8:16] from st. John 10 we're gonna run down to
[8:19] Ezekiel and from Ezekiel we'll read a
[8:23] little bit of Malachi in John 10
[8:28] beginning at the fourteenth verse I am
[8:34] The Good Shepherd and know my sheep and
[8:39] am known of mine you hear that I know my
[8:46] sheep and basically all that our mind
[8:49] know me as a father knoweth me even so
[8:53] no I the father and I lay down my life
[8:56] for my sheep another sheep I have which
[9:02] are not of this fold them also I must
[9:05] bring and they shall hear my voice and
[9:08] there shall be one fold and one Shepherd
[9:12] Jew and Gentile Ezekiel 34 please
[9:22] time we forget in our natural minds but
[9:25] one thing about the Lord Jesus he never
[9:27] forget Ezekiel 34 11 through 14 but that
[9:35] said the Lord behold I even I were both
[9:39] search my sheep and seek them out as a
[9:44] shepherd seeketh out his flock in the
[9:46] day that he is among his sheep that are
[9:48] scattered so will I seek out my sheep
[9:52] and will deliver them out of all places
[9:55] where they have been scattered in the
[9:57] cloudy and dark day and I will bring
[10:01] them out from the people and gather them
[10:04] from the countries and will bring them
[10:08] to their own land and feed them among
[10:11] the mountains of Israel by the rivers
[10:13] and in all the inhabitant places of the
[10:17] country I will feed them in a good
[10:20] pasture and upon the high mountains of
[10:22] Israel shall therefore be there shall
[10:25] they lie in good fold and in the fat
[10:28] pasture shall they feed among the
[10:31] mountains of Israel and I will feed my
[10:34] flock and I will cause them to lie down
[10:36] said the Lord God not only will I feed
[10:40] them when I cause them to rest I will
[10:44] seek that which was lost and bring them
[10:47] that which was driven away and I were
[10:50] buying up that which was broken and was
[10:54] strengthened that which was sick but I
[10:57] would destroy the fat and the strong I
[11:00] will feed them with judgment Malachi 3
[11:15] I sung a song one time with the choir we
[11:21] this this particular verse was one of
[11:23] the verses in which the brother I wrote
[11:27] the song
[11:27] and even when we he wrote this song and
[11:32] this has been some years ago I fully I
[11:35] didn't fully understand it but now it's
[11:38] become a powerful revelation to me
[11:41] Malachi 3 we're going to read the 16th
[11:43] through the 18th verse then they that
[11:48] fear the Lord speak often one to another
[11:54] when you fear God it produces fellowship
[12:00] your fellowship is around the Word of
[12:03] God and the Lord hearkened and heard it
[12:07] and a book of remembrance was written
[12:10] before him for them that feared the Lord
[12:13] and that thought upon his name can you
[12:17] that's powerful to me every time you
[12:20] mention God Oh speak his name it's
[12:23] placed in a book and they shall be mine
[12:26] said the Lord of Hosts in that day when
[12:30] I make up my jewels and I will spare
[12:33] them as a man spare its own son that
[12:38] serveth him then shall ye return and
[12:43] discern between the righteous and the
[12:45] wicked between him that serveth God and
[12:48] him that serveth it's not there is a
[12:52] time when God will gather us we'll go in
[12:56] a rapture but come back down and we will
[12:59] judge judge those who was righteous and
[13:02] those who who are wrong God is good to
[13:05] us
[13:06] let us pray father we come before your
[13:10] Lord as humble as we know how we thank
[13:15] you for your goodness in your grace your
[13:16] mercy in your love Lord we thank you for
[13:19] tonight because you have declared where
[13:22] two or three are gathered in your name
[13:23] there you are in the midst father we say
[13:27] Lord searches
[13:29] Oh God they'll be refining a thing that
[13:32] shouldn't be please take it out of us
[13:34] Lord is our desire to be lights of this
[13:39] world Lord give us grace that will not
[13:43] hide the light put it under a bushel but
[13:46] may we place it on the top of a hill on
[13:48] a top of a candlestick that the world
[13:50] may see help us now there would be true
[13:53] witnesses and witnesses in these last
[13:56] and evil days and you name Jesus Christ
[13:59] we pray you may be seated
[14:02] I like to entitle this message stone
[14:06] upon stone but also like to give it a
[14:10] theme they shall be mine God made that
[14:13] declaration you know we've been talking
[14:16] with various brothers brother rich and
[14:18] different ones for the Keith and
[14:21] different ones and so many thoughts have
[14:24] been going through my mind and I know
[14:27] that for a long period of time I
[14:29] preached about what God was doing with
[14:33] his Jerusalem cause every time I saw in
[14:36] the book of Revelation Jerusalem coming
[14:39] down and she was recognized as the Bride
[14:42] of Christ the wife of God III couldn't
[14:46] help but to understand even then that
[14:49] those those jewels those stones
[14:53] according to the scripture were
[14:55] significant to testimonies and you know
[15:02] what I see how that God through His
[15:04] grace have taken us through all of these
[15:07] ages how I got the thought of stone upon
[15:12] stone because I thought about how the
[15:15] foundation was laid Jesus Christ was the
[15:19] cornerstone and understand it that that
[15:24] cornerstone was the very foundation was
[15:27] built about it and you and I must
[15:30] understand that each age was built upon
[15:32] and Christ Jesus you and I really don't
[15:36] I would say it like this I don't know
[15:38] whether we realize it or not but I'll
[15:41] out of
[15:42] all of the ages even from the time the
[15:45] Jewish church this church or this people
[15:48] of this age I'm speaking of bride is the
[15:53] only one since the Jewish church who had
[15:58] been able to receive the headstone
[16:02] it's each age we built upon we laid a
[16:06] foundation we built the stone emphasis
[16:09] all the way up amen to Laodicea amen and
[16:13] now the capstone all of these things all
[16:17] of these layers all of these foundations
[16:20] you know built upon and then eventually
[16:24] that all of those stones become one
[16:27] stone we find out is that right because
[16:32] really Jesus prayed father I would there
[16:35] be one even as real one I'm speaking of
[16:38] the spiritual aspect because I want us
[16:40] to realize Amen that we are living in a
[16:43] scientific age and scientists are
[16:46] building all of these things they're
[16:49] trying to reach the moon and trying to
[16:52] reach other galaxies and sending out
[16:55] probes and all of these things we had a
[16:59] prophet in our day but the Brandon who
[17:01] told us they will come a day they'll be
[17:03] surprised to know that the things that
[17:05] they're seeing is not millions of
[17:07] billions or whatever miles light-years
[17:09] away but these things are bending and
[17:12] they they are different dimensions amen
[17:16] and they're actually moving around in a
[17:19] circle if you understand eternity the
[17:23] way we write it it's either an eight or
[17:26] circle Amen showing that this circle and
[17:30] this eight had no beginning nor no
[17:33] ending and so when we think about this
[17:36] age with brother Branham says Amen that
[17:38] we are in a time where science is going
[17:44] to backfire on mankind they building all
[17:47] of these atomic weapons we are now
[17:50] living in a time where not only are
[17:55] I ran you want to name them but every
[17:57] country is capable of mass destruction
[18:01] probably God said even in the time of
[18:04] Enoch science was so great far greater
[18:07] than than what we know of now because we
[18:11] cannot build a pyramid think about it if
[18:14] you've ever I'm going to to Egypt I've
[18:18] seen the Great Pyramid I've seen those
[18:20] huge stones we don't have an equipment
[18:23] nowhere that could actually take those
[18:26] stones and place them almost a mile high
[18:29] stones that I am be a wearing weighing
[18:33] turns after tons brother Edelman led by
[18:38] the Spirit of God he said they must have
[18:40] had a control atomic power
[18:44] he said gasoline power electric power
[18:46] would never lift those boulders and
[18:50] build such as the pyramid they weigh
[18:53] hundreds of tons and setting away in the
[18:56] air and almost about a city block high
[18:59] mostly and how they ever get them up
[19:03] there that's the mystery and so
[19:05] perfectly until a razor blade couldn't
[19:09] go between them hone down
[19:11] they are masterpieces mastermind and
[19:17] they got so smart and so screwed and the
[19:20] Bible said to become workers of good
[19:22] good wood and workers of brass and great
[19:26] days of science and it got so smart -
[19:28] they figured they'd just outsmart God
[19:31] and didn't need him anymore
[19:33] remember how they did that amen when
[19:36] they thought they can outsmart God and
[19:39] they built the Tower of Babel God came
[19:41] down and confused the language they
[19:44] thought they were so smart
[19:45] a man that they didn't need God no more
[19:47] so God just flood to the earth off but
[19:50] whatever it is it's something in the
[19:52] inner fallens man's nature that makes
[19:55] him think that he's smarter than God it
[19:58] is a trick of the enemy because that's
[20:00] the way Lucifer thought he thought he
[20:04] was smarter than God and anytime
[20:07] he can get a man or men on one Accord
[20:10] where they believe that they're smarter
[20:12] than God they are headed for destruction
[20:15] here's the prophecy that being God not
[20:18] willing that any should perish talked to
[20:20] a man out in the field one day and nor
[20:22] and and told him to erect an ark to
[20:26] protect him from the judgment God led
[20:29] him to do it
[20:31] in other words when we get to the place
[20:33] where we're so smart that we're gonna
[20:35] erase God out of the equation then God
[20:38] in in in return we races us out of the
[20:41] equation we're living in a scientific
[20:45] agent in the reason why I'm I'm bringing
[20:48] this because had not God determined to
[20:52] find us we would still be lost because
[20:56] there is no way that man could ever find
[20:59] his way back after the fall God had to
[21:03] be the one that was searched for Adam
[21:05] Adam didn't even have it in him to
[21:08] search for God but God would search him
[21:11] for Adam and God is still searching for
[21:14] his kind now scientific we are in an
[21:20] agent and at this time with man and and
[21:23] I love this because we find out that
[21:25] we're in an age where man is glorifying
[21:27] himself if you know and you've read
[21:30] about Esther you'll never find God in
[21:34] the picture because during that time
[21:36] that Esther is a book where where man is
[21:39] being glorified you know the king he's
[21:43] got everything you know and and and all
[21:45] that he wants you know he's got his own
[21:47] church why whatever and he doesn't need
[21:51] anything and and you won't find God in
[21:54] there because he was working with a
[21:55] Gentile king that only knew about idols
[21:59] but then God places himself in the
[22:03] picture by bringing Edessa into the
[22:07] king's palace and now in age where God
[22:11] has been vanquished vanquished out of
[22:15] the out of the the scene of things like
[22:19] our day
[22:20] we put him out of the church we put him
[22:23] out of everything is that right
[22:25] the Bible says according to Revelation
[22:26] the third chapter he's no longer in the
[22:29] church
[22:29] he's knocking at the door third chapter
[22:32] trying to get into his own church so it
[22:36] hasn't been the world that has placed
[22:37] him out is that the church has done the
[22:40] same thing but the Bride of Christ
[22:42] because God said he'll never leave
[22:45] himself without a witness and so God is
[22:47] placed in our lives a desire to serve
[22:51] Him and him only now scientists are
[22:56] scientific things are perishable right
[22:59] he said it comes from the earth but the
[23:02] unscientific things are the real things
[23:05] that come from heaven hallelujah amen
[23:08] you may be able to explain my natural
[23:11] existence you can say by God's grace
[23:15] that I was born of a woman by the name
[23:17] of Clara and whose whose husband at the
[23:20] time was at the nail name Isaiah but you
[23:23] cannot take it any further than that
[23:25] and what you see now Amen is not as real
[23:30] this is not to realize there this is the
[23:33] house of Isaiah the real Isaiah is the
[23:36] thing that you can't physically see with
[23:39] your eyes that's the real you right
[23:43] because you can fake it and make it with
[23:46] this outward appearance but on the
[23:48] inside God knows the real you excuse me
[23:53] here my shoe string came loose I don't
[24:00] want to get happy and trip
[24:08] god is so good to us we appreciate him
[24:15] for being so real to us but we thank God
[24:20] for His mercy and His grace thank you
[24:22] brother so we look at this thing and we
[24:24] say well remember it was always
[24:26] backfired other words we're living in a
[24:29] day well where science is about to
[24:32] backfire again right when in in the days
[24:37] of noir God made a way for noir to
[24:40] escape the destruction of science
[24:45] hallelujah and now God has made a way
[24:48] for us to the - to escape the
[24:50] destruction of science now he goes on
[24:54] the same but the unscientific things are
[24:57] the real things that come from heaven
[24:59] God holy spirit angels supernatural they
[25:03] are the everlasting things believe on
[25:05] the Lord
[25:06] don't try to scientifically prove
[25:08] anything just have faith in God remember
[25:12] there was two trees in the Garden of
[25:14] Eden
[25:15] how many knows that one was a them was
[25:18] the tree of science the other was the
[25:20] tree of faith as long as men eat from
[25:23] the tree of faith he lived but the first
[25:27] bite he took off of the tree of science
[25:30] knowledge he separated himself from God
[25:33] and he destroyed himself and every time
[25:36] man bites from the tree of science he
[25:39] destroys himself he he he bite off
[25:44] gunpowder kill the comrade he bit off
[25:47] automobiles off the tree of science kill
[25:50] more people than all the wars put
[25:52] together he did himself bit himself off
[25:55] a corporate bomb now wonder what he's
[25:58] going to do with that see science
[26:01] destroys faith deals I have nothing
[26:06] against the tree of science it's done
[26:08] wonders but you can't depend on it
[26:10] here's where you have to depend on your
[26:13] faith it's everlasting believe on God
[26:16] believe that he's raised from the dead
[26:19] and may he
[26:21] into your your lovely audience tonight
[26:24] and show himself alive to you by working
[26:27] to his church see you and I must
[26:30] understand Amen when it comes to science
[26:32] and this is where I feel like we've
[26:35] become weakened Amen because we fail to
[26:38] see where we come from this is not our
[26:40] home
[26:41] science is not our protection matter of
[26:44] fact science is the reason why most of
[26:47] us have been sick you know disease it
[26:51] carries admit because it meant before
[26:53] science there was no such thing as
[26:55] disease how to lose but when the word
[26:58] broke I was broken been suckers Amen
[27:01] feel the atmosphere controls everything
[27:04] because of science we are dying
[27:07] physically hallelujah but by faith we'll
[27:12] live forever
[27:13] [Music]
[27:15] that's right give me one more coat he
[27:17] says now we're living in modern science
[27:20] age and no at all age wherever they
[27:23] proves by science if you just go back in
[27:25] the Bible you find out that just exactly
[27:28] the kind of age they had before the
[27:31] antediluvian instruction all of you know
[27:34] that and the lineage of Caze children
[27:37] become scientists the lineage of self
[27:40] children were spiritual and those two
[27:43] different classes of people exist today
[27:46] scientists and spiritual minded people
[27:49] they should be workers together but it's
[27:52] very contrary in other words you can't
[27:55] work science and faith together they're
[27:57] contrary one to the other hallelujah
[28:01] you say why are you saying all of these
[28:03] things because look at yourself if you
[28:07] go by science it's impossible for you to
[28:09] be translated hallelujah but by faith
[28:16] your translation is inevitable
[28:19] hallelujah
[28:21] now you said what do you mean where are
[28:22] you going with this understand by God's
[28:25] grace that God when he created Adam he
[28:27] first created him or what a spiritual
[28:29] being then God took that spiritual being
[28:32] and put him in what clay
[28:34] right call it dust if you want to
[28:37] whatever the whole thing is you came
[28:39] this part of you came from the earth
[28:42] right but there's a part of you that
[28:45] never had a beginning and will never
[28:48] have an ending that part of you Amen was
[28:52] was came by way of faith hallelujah
[28:57] not just any kind of faith it was God's
[28:59] faith hallelujah
[29:02] I thought about a stone because I said
[29:05] they shall be mine you know when we talk
[29:07] about jewels we think about stole a
[29:10] jewel is a stone you know it's a
[29:13] different kind of stone it's a valuable
[29:14] stone it's not like a granite stone it's
[29:17] valuable I remember going to a brother
[29:19] house amen years ago he's deceased going
[29:23] on with the Lord amen but he travelled
[29:25] throughout South America and he had a
[29:28] big old box he said I want to come I
[29:29] want to show you something he took me in
[29:31] his room and he showed me his treasure
[29:34] all kinds of jewel stones rocks
[29:38] sapphires you name it he had it there
[29:41] and and he had a big box of those I
[29:45] don't know how many money was worth but
[29:46] if you could just take it to this
[29:48] somewhere I'm sure they were worth a lot
[29:50] of money he was a millionaire as it was
[29:52] but nevertheless a man he had all of
[29:56] these jewels that had not even been cut
[29:58] yet that was given to him by the native
[30:02] people as gifts and you think about all
[30:07] that he had and I thought Lord I said he
[30:09] did not rest his soul upon it because
[30:13] when he died he left those jewels with
[30:15] whoever was left in his family stones
[30:20] that could that that that are formed and
[30:23] you know every stone is formed by way of
[30:25] pressure see there's no way you could be
[30:29] a diamond without experiencing pressure
[30:32] has it have been told that a coal of a
[30:36] cold rock a rock of coal
[30:38] amen is a diamond in its early stages
[30:41] and it is pressured and pressured and
[30:45] pressured impression a mentally becomes
[30:47] a diamond
[30:49] that looks so impossible to me I don't
[30:52] even know how to explain it but listen
[30:54] you and I when God found us he knew we
[30:56] were diamonds but maybe some of us will
[30:58] steal coves and now he's got to pressure
[31:00] us into becoming diamonds but that's not
[31:04] the finished product after you become a
[31:06] stone that is a diamond you've gotta be
[31:08] cut and every diamond is an instrument
[31:14] all value real value to it until you cut
[31:16] it and guess what the purpose for is it
[31:19] now cutting a diamond is to make sure
[31:22] that whatever angles you being that is
[31:24] being cut in that diamond it will
[31:26] reflect the rainbow those seven
[31:31] brilliant colors of God amen
[31:33] and that's exactly what God is doing
[31:35] with you and I but God I heard brother
[31:39] Keith somebody said something about the
[31:41] temple of God and the limits said that's
[31:43] exactly who we are hello
[31:47] did you know you was a stone that's what
[31:50] the Bible call you a lively stone right
[31:55] first Peter says amen two and four four
[31:58] to five to whom coming as unto a living
[32:01] stone disallowed indeed of men but
[32:04] chosen of God and precious he also as
[32:08] living stones are built up a spiritual
[32:11] house that's why he said what what do
[32:14] you mean brother books I think about it
[32:16] man cannot build character just like no
[32:21] man could have built him in the Pyramid
[32:24] without the help of God and you and I
[32:27] know that Enoch beautiful as the prophet
[32:30] said so how he did it nobody knows but
[32:37] no man y'all understand what I'm saying
[32:39] and I'm almost jumping I'm getting
[32:43] excited cuz I'm trying to get to where
[32:45] I'm going you and I must understand that
[32:48] the stones these songs these songs that
[32:52] gotten out shaping why did God put you
[32:54] in this assembly because you are stone
[32:58] and you ought to be chipped and
[33:01] eight until all who are part of this
[33:04] church must become one stone stone upon
[33:10] stone that's how we must fellowship and
[33:13] that's why the prophet of God said he
[33:14] said now when that pyramid was made Amen
[33:17] there in Egypt he said it was so tight
[33:20] that you couldn't even slip a razor
[33:23] blade between it I've been to the
[33:27] pyramid and don't you know the beginning
[33:29] when they had that pyramid you can see
[33:32] how the robbers came to Egypt because
[33:34] when that pyramid was completely formed
[33:38] it had an outer covering that reflected
[33:42] itself like gold and you and I must
[33:47] realize they men by the grace of God
[33:49] that pyramid you said all brothers
[33:51] listen that pyramid withstood the flood
[33:56] hello somebody there was no other
[34:00] building that was able to stand but that
[34:03] pyramid why because it was prophecy it
[34:07] was a word that's right that's what the
[34:09] Bible said the Bible said the the grass
[34:11] will wither the flowers fade away but
[34:14] the word of the Lord shall stand and
[34:16] what was the pyramid it was a Bible a
[34:21] constructed Bible Oh Lord see cuz God
[34:25] rolled it in the heavens he wrote it in
[34:29] the pyramid and then he wrote it here
[34:32] that's why if you understand the
[34:35] construction of the pyramid you'll know
[34:37] that we're right at the King's Chamber
[34:40] hallelujah amen and going up to the
[34:43] King's Chamber it had seven steps and
[34:47] you and I must understand you must take
[34:50] several steps to get there a man his
[34:54] brother rich and I we were talking I
[34:55] said Darius had the capstone you had the
[34:58] space in between us and now everybody
[35:00] don't see it the way I see it and maybe
[35:02] I'm wrong but I said like this amen if
[35:05] we must grow up into Christ that space
[35:10] which is after the seven because we've
[35:13] been smitten out of the church ages
[35:15] but that space represents the invisible
[35:19] union of Christ and his bride hallelujah
[35:23] so in between we feel in the space as he
[35:28] comes down we feels of it we become him
[35:31] he becomes us hallelujah
[35:35] it's only one period he's only one god
[35:38] hallelujah is only one bride think
[35:43] stones were used for various things
[35:46] stones in the Old Testament was used for
[35:50] stoning it was a judgement weapon right
[35:55] even so in the Old Testament guess what
[35:57] the Bible says Amen that I forgot how
[36:00] many pounds of hail will fall from the
[36:04] sky can you imagine a two pound hail I
[36:09] think it was maybe more than that I
[36:11] can't remember but it comes it will
[36:14] crash if you had a head it wouldn't it
[36:16] would have been you would have no head
[36:17] after that events you know it's going to
[36:22] crush it's going to destroy it's going
[36:24] to tear up everything hallelujah
[36:28] is that right a stone is a seal it can
[36:33] be used as a seal it was our stone was
[36:37] used to seal Jacobs well you ought to
[36:41] get a little happy there
[36:42] hallelujah a stone was used to seal the
[36:47] tomb of Jesus you understand me
[36:50] a stone stones him in rocks Amen y'all
[36:54] must understand amen our seal is a stone
[37:03] he's strong and Dan you said I've seen
[37:07] that stone hewn out of the mountain well
[37:12] you're not gonna seal it seal something
[37:14] up valuable that Roman stone was so
[37:16] heavy I forgot how many turns in war and
[37:19] a weight and and and you know here Jesus
[37:22] said told Mary Martha
[37:24] y'all go and move the stone
[37:28] all the way to stone I don't know how
[37:32] they did it but they did it but what was
[37:36] a Lazar excuse me roll away the stone of
[37:39] Lazarus and what was behind there to the
[37:44] meeting out there it looked like nothing
[37:46] all they could feel it there was
[37:48] distance flow but there was something of
[37:51] value that was hidden behind the stone
[37:55] [Music]
[37:57] when God said let him come for guess
[38:01] what happened new life a man who had
[38:05] been bound for four days right he knows
[38:07] something The Magus blowed him up
[38:10] amen it comes out walking that all right
[38:14] and God comes along and says Amen loose
[38:16] the man take all them all them crease
[38:20] and dog was off of him
[38:21] hallelujah loose the man hallelujah and
[38:24] let him go and guess what when he became
[38:28] free of all his dog was and all of that
[38:30] guess what happened the next thing was
[38:31] that it's up in the evening time sitting
[38:35] at the table with Jesus feasting and
[38:38] that's where we are today hallelujah we
[38:41] must take away all the crease that dog
[38:44] was any and everything that's got us
[38:46] bound up Graco's is what they are
[38:53] hallelujah is that okay you and I must
[38:57] understand that Jesus the Bible says
[38:59] wherefore also it is contained in the
[39:01] scripture behold I lay in Zion a chief
[39:03] Cornerstone elect precious and he that
[39:05] believeth on him shall not be confounded
[39:07] remember jesus said foxes have holes
[39:11] birds have nests but the Son of man has
[39:14] no way to lay his head he was saying
[39:18] listen I am the Cornerstone I am the
[39:21] headstone but I am going to be rejected
[39:25] hallelujah how many of you would have
[39:27] followed a man who not even he was so
[39:30] poor he didn't even have a house of his
[39:34] own hallelujah he said basically if you
[39:38] follow me you follow me for the word and
[39:41] not for what
[39:42] can give you it's something about the
[39:45] word he said what what do you mean
[39:47] brother Brooks why did not God when God
[39:50] gave Moses Amen the commandments why
[39:55] didn't he take a see fit and in the
[39:57] engine right the King Commandments amen
[39:59] on some level something but he took two
[40:01] tables of stone amen like the right team
[40:05] in the left chamber of a heart and he
[40:07] roped it men those laws why because in
[40:11] the heart of land his heart was as stony
[40:14] as a stone that was hewn out of the
[40:16] mountain hallelujah
[40:20] but God Amen in Ezekiel I believe said I
[40:23] will take away that stony heart and I'm
[40:25] gonna give you a heart of flesh I'm
[40:27] gonna put my spirit in your spirit and
[40:30] I'm gonna cause you to be a new what is
[40:33] God doing he taking the stones that had
[40:37] no life is that right because he told
[40:40] Israel he said listen if you don't cry
[40:42] out I'll make these stones cry out for
[40:45] me hallelujah I don't know whether he
[40:48] had me in mind but all I know is that
[40:50] this stone will worship
[40:54] hallelujah stone upon stone God building
[40:57] a house that's why God said you are the
[41:00] temple of God you are a stone hallelujah
[41:04] is that right that's what they did they
[41:07] put Jesus in a stone they took a stone
[41:10] put him in a stone laid him on a stone
[41:12] hallelujah
[41:13] but when that resurrection came
[41:15] hallelujah the stone that had him bound
[41:17] had to what roll away hallelujah
[41:21] like they say a rock in a rock our Lord
[41:25] our God and you and I must understand he
[41:27] meant that's what God is doing
[41:29] Oh help me Jesus I hope I could get it
[41:32] over cheer like I see it unto you
[41:35] therefore which believing is precious
[41:37] but under them which are disobedient the
[41:40] stone which the builders disallowed the
[41:42] same is made this head of the corner in
[41:44] that amazing because jesus said as they
[41:46] did it in the green that should do it in
[41:48] the dry don't think you're going to get
[41:49] away with prayer from persecution
[41:51] persecution is going to come to you amen
[41:54] they had the real deal
[41:55] hallelujah Jesus Christ God himself
[41:59] amen and listen they literally wanted to
[42:02] stone the stone because he said I and my
[42:07] father are one
[42:10] hallelujah they wanted to stone him but
[42:13] they didn't understand who he was
[42:15] ha ha that Bible said that same
[42:18] cornerstone has now God made the head of
[42:21] the corner why because the Jewish Church
[42:25] rejected him
[42:26] but this Bride of Christ will not
[42:28] hallelujah ha because God has taken
[42:30] stones and laid him upon he stoned
[42:33] hallelujah oh I love this what was so
[42:36] beautiful nobody really knows where all
[42:39] of those stones and then came from that
[42:43] consent that made that Egyptian pyramid
[42:46] it really wasn't Egyptian pyramid it was
[42:50] just in Egypt is that right but listen
[42:53] what happens here here is this pyramid
[42:55] amen that represents Christ that
[42:57] represents God that represents the bride
[43:00] in Egypt hallelujah but Jesus was born
[43:04] in Bethlehem oh but when the enemy tried
[43:07] to kill him they just had taken down the
[43:09] eagle
[43:10] hallelujah amen there's a representation
[43:12] of him there hallelujah
[43:15] so by reading by reading the temple or
[43:18] by reading a Mende the pyramid Jesus
[43:22] realized - that one day I'm going to be
[43:24] rejected
[43:25] he understood the headstone was missing
[43:28] hallelujah
[43:29] but he also knew that they were coming
[43:31] of people that will actually be ordained
[43:34] to receive the hair sold we all
[43:38] understand what this message is this
[43:40] message is here amen to bring you into a
[43:42] place where you can receive the
[43:44] headstone United with Christ that's what
[43:52] our whole purpose for being here is to
[43:55] unite with Christ hallelujah you
[44:04] therefore which believe it's precious
[44:06] right
[44:08] but the Sun is a stone of stumbling a
[44:11] rock of offense to them which tumble
[44:14] that the word being disobedient wearing
[44:17] to all so they were appointed so
[44:19] understand that those who are
[44:21] disobedient those who are willfully
[44:24] rejecting the word they can't help it
[44:26] they were appointed herod was appointed
[44:30] Judas was appointed hallelujah but you
[44:33] take a man that desire God that really
[44:36] wanted a god to fulfill him in his heart
[44:39] that man came from God because the devil
[44:41] never had a desire to serve God
[44:44] hallelujah King was given the right
[44:48] things to do and all he had to do was do
[44:51] it and he wouldn't do it
[44:53] hallelujah but if you've got a thirst
[44:55] for the Living God the Bible said if a
[44:57] man hunger and thirst after me and he
[44:59] shall be filled right so you look at
[45:03] this and you say well oh Lord
[45:04] what is the problem what is it what is
[45:06] the whole thing behind it you gotta
[45:09] realize you are stolen in the building
[45:11] like I told you amen when it comes to a
[45:13] puzzle I'm a piece of the puzzle and the
[45:15] puzzle is not complete without me
[45:17] hallelujah
[45:19] and so without you either you act you
[45:21] got to understand Amen you might be just
[45:23] a part of the framework but you're not
[45:26] that that I don't care if you're not
[45:28] part of the big beautiful flower or
[45:29] whatever that's in the middle of it you
[45:31] are just as important to the person
[45:33] who's put the puzzle together you love
[45:38] the Lord listen you and I must
[45:40] understand that this thing is so
[45:42] spiritual it's like my mind can't even
[45:44] comprehend I can't even grasp what I'm
[45:46] trying to get over to you all I know is
[45:48] this that I am a part of the building
[45:52] and when the building is complete he
[45:57] would then come for us
[46:00] hallelujah oh come on somebody
[46:03] hallelujah Solomon thought he built a
[46:05] building huh come up with something
[46:07] harder even we realized Amen that was
[46:09] Solomon Amen built that that that
[46:12] building guess what he did he got stones
[46:14] from everywhere
[46:15] he got trees from everywhere hallelujah
[46:18] and he ordered Mason reason
[46:20] everything else and they hammered and
[46:22] they cut they hammered in the cut but
[46:24] when they came to the building there was
[46:27] no sound of a saw there was no lower a
[46:32] sound of a hammer
[46:34] oh come on somebody hey you got to
[46:38] understand what these are significant up
[46:40] it means that it was God shaping us it
[46:43] was God amen who was actually fitting us
[46:46] together hallelujah it's the truth it is
[46:49] God's program that's literally gathering
[46:52] these stones remember I just read to you
[46:54] no matter where you are on earth God is
[46:57] gathering your stones hallelujah you can
[47:01] be an advocate you come in Asia you can
[47:03] be in Germany you can be in Russia no
[47:04] matter where you are you God cannot
[47:07] finish a building without you I love it

[47:19] foundations of the earth that's what God
[47:21] is asking Joe declare if thou has
[47:24] understanding if thou has understanding
[47:27] who have laid the measure thereof and if
[47:29] thou North or who have stretched the
[47:31] line upon it wherefore are the
[47:33] foundation there are fastened or who

[48:21] there when John wept and the voice says

[49:17] mother couldn't read it right and I
[49:18] asked the Lord once I came got saved
[49:21] Lord how did my mom make this thing how
[49:23] how how she couldn't read or write she
[49:25] had to take whatever the preacher said
[49:27] whether it was right or wrong you see

[49:33] hallelujah and he said and this is what
[49:35] I saw this is my first vision I ever had
[49:38] I saw a big old hammer coming down on a
[49:41] big bold up breaking it into pieces and
[49:43] I went to a minister I said listen I
[49:45] just had a strange thing happened to me
[49:46] I saw right here I start a big hammer
[49:49] like a big mallet coming down and
[49:51] breaking that right oh brother he said
[49:53] that's the scripture took me right to
[49:55] the scripture that's when I realized how
[49:57] God dealt with my mom about my vision

[50:22] Sarah hallelujah he should have killed
[50:25] me but I was a part of him amen ah he
[50:31] said it's not my word like as fire said

[50:52] burning hallelujah sayeth the Lord
[50:55] and like a hammer that breaketh the rock
[50:57] in the pieces hallelujah when I heard
[51:00] that today when God gave me that
[51:01] scripture today I said Dada says right
[51:03] exactly what he's doing because the rock
[51:06] and the bread is the same is that right
[51:11] oh come on somebody jesus said I am that
[51:13] rock is that right he said I am that
[51:17] Brahe and on the road to Emmaus he was
[51:20] breaking the bread he still breaks the
[51:23] bread he still breaks the rock into
[51:25] pieces and give us revelation oh God I'm
[51:30] enjoying myself here or not I just know
[51:33] I'm dead I'm having a good time see you
[51:35] and I must understand is the power of
[51:37] God that cuts the stones no matter where
[51:41] you are is God will cut your stone and
[51:43] each and every one of us are shaped
[51:45] differently our cuts are different
[51:49] because our cuts must be cut according
[51:52] to way God wants them to be cut in order
[51:55] for us to join together the
[51:58] understanding is one body one bread one
[52:03] solid rock who Christ the solid rock I
[52:07] stand ah yeah I don't stand on that rock
[52:10] I do and what is that rock is the
[52:12] revelation of who Jesus is that's what
[52:17] the church was built on Paul the
[52:20] revelation of Jesus Christ is that right
[52:23] John said if any man say Amen that that
[52:26] that the crisis in come hallelujah If
[52:30] any man talk and speak about the Holy
[52:33] Ghost and say he's not coming to you
[52:36] that's what the whole purpose is the
[52:39] whole purpose of Christ's death is to
[52:42] bring life back to his people and how
[52:45] can life come back into old dead Rock
[52:48] it's by the Holy Spirit is that right
[52:52] oh come on somebody my God is God and
[52:55] you and I must understand
[52:58] listen when Joe I don't know how what
[53:00] was left of job hallelujah he may have
[53:04] had been maybe a teaspoon of ash left
[53:06] but when God called from all that ash
[53:09] came back together and what was missing
[53:11] was found hey man listen he said you
[53:16] know Solomon temple when it was cut out
[53:18] he was cut out in different parts of the
[53:20] world the trees the Cedars of Lebanon
[53:24] floated down to Joppa and from there to
[53:27] ox to Jerusalem and so forth and
[53:29] the stones Mason's in the years of
[53:32] cutting the different stones they shaped
[53:34] different ways but when they come
[53:37] together there wasn't a free stone among
[53:40] them every strong laid right to its
[53:44] place how did they do it
[53:48] and I think that's what gods are doing
[53:50] he's just cutting us out of Methodist
[53:53] and Baptist Presbyterian in a cautious
[53:56] but when Jesus come we'll all go strong
[54:01] to stone see minute with love of God and
[54:05] God would take his church mmm each age
[54:11] is C minute in other words you can't get
[54:14] to brotherly kindness without faith you
[54:18] can't get to patients without virtue
[54:21] each one of these stones must be laid
[54:24] correctly remember we read the rich
[54:30] we're having a good time of day and
[54:32] brother Mike
[54:34] amen you know the love the Lord it is so
[54:38] important that you have the Holy Spirit
[54:39] in you you know without the Holy Ghost
[54:42] you won't make a rapture God is like a
[54:45] magnet and the only thing he's pulling
[54:49] up is his Holy Spirit how is that right
[54:53] that's what you and I must be really
[54:56] careful because we're living in the last
[54:57] days God is now withdrawing his Holy
[55:01] Spirit from the earth if he did not do
[55:04] that
[55:04] Satan couldn't do what he's doing don't
[55:08] you know why the Pentecostal churches
[55:10] had to die out because their power what
[55:14] they were experiencing the Holy Ghost
[55:16] moving kept Satan a bank but when they
[55:22] began to fall Satan began to grow in
[55:26] strength when they began to look at
[55:29] Hollywood and want the things of
[55:30] Hollywood say to him again to grow in
[55:33] strength when they start looking at the
[55:35] world and all the things in the world
[55:37] Satan began to grow in strength
[55:38] hallelujah but God's Word it's perfect
[55:45] if God can called Lazarus from the dead
[55:47] he can call this church from the dead
[55:49] and that's what he did is that right he
[55:52] said Ezekiel can this dry bones live
[55:54] again
[55:55] I don't know why I'm going over some
[55:56] stuff I've already gone over he said but
[55:59] the true church all over the world has
[56:01] shaped down to a place that there's come
[56:03] a ministry among it just like the
[56:05] ministry of Jesus Christ now what
[56:07] they've got they've got the thing in
[56:09] condition now what's the next thing the
[56:11] rejected stone of the pyramid cut out of
[56:14] the mountain without what without hand
[56:17] God sent it do you see it you understand
[56:20] me so what are you saying brother Brooks
[56:22] when the prophet of God was here he was
[56:25] not trying to produce his own program it
[56:28] was they rejected stone it was Christ in
[56:31] the Prophet Amen that this generation
[56:34] rejected yeah you understand me
[56:37] cuz Laodicea had to reject Jesus Christ
[56:42] you say scripturally prove it
[56:45] revelations third chapter he's outside
[56:47] the door of the laird see interchange so
[56:50] they rejected Christ but God had
[56:54] predestinated a group a special kind of
[56:58] people that literally were word and is
[57:04] word hallelujah in them they were
[57:07] ordained to be word oh they had to be
[57:14] ordained word because he is the word and
[57:17] the word can all be compatible to the
[57:19] word so they were contain word they are
[57:22] the only group in in
[57:25] in all of the ages that will come to
[57:27] perfection and in their perfection
[57:30] they were then pull the rest up because
[57:34] like I said God is like a magnet and
[57:37] they cannot be completed without us and
[57:40] where does it comes right back down to
[57:43] the very thing that we lost in the
[57:45] beginning which was divine love because
[57:50] when we lost divine love then being came
[57:53] hatred and when hatred came in who was
[57:56] the serpent a man guess what he'd do
[57:59] this what you see you love the Lord it's
[58:04] shaped up image so that God it may can
[58:07] do great things for us
[58:08] right so Christ is that stone he wasn't
[58:14] born of a man he was born of God he is
[58:17] the coming he is coming for a church
[58:19] that's been reborn again by the Spirit
[58:23] of God think about it even David
[58:26] understood the power of a stone
[58:28] hallelujah he picked up five smooth
[58:31] stones but you see let me tell you
[58:33] something he did meet up and want to
[58:35] bring down Goliath you don't need a man
[58:38] a great education with all kinds of
[58:40] degrees all you need in men is one stone
[58:43] and that's the stone who is Jesus Christ
[58:45] our Lord hallelujah if he can bring down
[58:49] the kingdoms and kingdoms and Kingdom
[58:51] surely he can bring down the Devils and
[58:53] the Giants in your life right I'm
[59:00] chopping this up but I'm trying to give
[59:02] you something here to the overcomers
[59:07] remember Jesus said they shall be mine
[59:09] just remember that and we mentioned this
[59:12] the last time we preach revelation 2:17
[59:15] that he that have an ear let him hear
[59:17] what the Spirit said to the church to
[59:19] him that overcometh will I give to eat
[59:21] of the hidden manna oh is it
[59:25] that means everybody doesn't won't get
[59:28] it something that's hidden that God is
[59:31] gonna give you right my grandma used to
[59:35] do that she waited all the children
[59:38] give me how are you saying I was her
[59:42] favorite she knew I loved the little
[59:47] sweet biscuits used to make Ruth but
[59:50] anyway let me go on imited them down
[59:52] cometh will I give to eat of the hidden
[59:54] manna and we give them what a white
[59:57] stone I can't tell you what this means
[1:00:03] to me
[1:00:04] but all I know is even in that dream
[1:00:06] everybody was dressed in white remember
[1:00:10] brother Branham talked about he said
[1:00:12] when I went over there crosses beyond
[1:00:14] the curtain of time he said everybody
[1:00:16] was dressed in different attire this
[1:00:19] group had a color they had on and this
[1:00:20] color had this color that that's the way
[1:00:23] I see it you know because if I'm going
[1:00:25] to go with this then every age had a
[1:00:28] color they that represented them to st.
[1:00:33] God will Israel had certain colors they
[1:00:36] wore don't you know that we have four we
[1:00:39] had twelve tribes and four was under
[1:00:42] that Eagle banner for was under the Ox
[1:00:44] banner for was under the man's banner is
[1:00:46] that right
[1:00:47] so you got to understand Amen that God
[1:00:50] he dealt he deals the way he deals he
[1:00:54] you know me but at that top it's pure
[1:00:59] light whites how do you want to say it
[1:01:04] but it's so pure amen that's why you
[1:01:07] must understand this church must be
[1:01:10] without spot wrinkle implement right up
[1:01:14] diamond is that right did the Prophet
[1:01:17] God basically say that we're diamonds
[1:01:19] we're cut right and in this age where is
[1:01:24] the the beauty of a diamond is at the
[1:01:26] top it's where the light comes in and
[1:01:29] reflects through all the others Harlan
[1:01:32] oh when you see what God is doing with
[1:01:36] us it's not something that we can
[1:01:39] consider lightly and the reason why like
[1:01:44] the Prophet God said he said it won't be
[1:01:46] because of your goodness and all my
[1:01:48] goodness not that we so righteous that
[1:01:50] God is going to do this thing
[1:01:52] God has promised it y'all know what
[1:01:56] being a child of promise means Satan
[1:02:00] can't alter it when God promised Isaac
[1:02:07] didn't matter how good Ishmael could
[1:02:09] have been would've been shut up in the
[1:02:13] promise was Isaac's hallelujah he saw in
[1:02:17] Jacob God said I loved I loved Jacob and
[1:02:22] I hate II saw what was going to change
[1:02:24] that nothing God said it that's the way
[1:02:26] well look what Jacob did and God still
[1:02:29] made him a promise hallelujah
[1:02:32] what was was Jacob they're looking
[1:02:34] a mint for this angel to visit him no
[1:02:36] sir he did not know an angel was going
[1:02:39] to come but somehow in that season God
[1:02:42] put him in prayer y'all hurt me God put
[1:02:47] him in prayer and then god dispatched
[1:02:49] the angel who did that Jacob didn't do
[1:02:54] it God did it y'all understand me all of
[1:02:58] these things are orchestrated by God and
[1:03:00] I say to people listen they're all when
[1:03:03] the squeeze come well if the squeeze is
[1:03:05] gonna get us in line that's what we need
[1:03:08] it's under pressure
[1:03:10] hallelujah when we really call on God
[1:03:14] it's the truth
[1:03:16] the Prophet God brother I'm said it's a
[1:03:17] shame that God has to do with that way
[1:03:19] but if that's the way man is we we're
[1:03:21] just lazy and dilatory God has to let
[1:03:25] things happen to us in order for us to
[1:03:28] look up hallelujah I am a free woman are
[1:03:35] you free hallelujah who made you free
[1:03:39] Jesus made you free he'll Missoni set
[1:03:42] free is free indeed this is what
[1:03:45] Galatians says tell me he the desire to
[1:03:48] be under the law do you not hear the law
[1:03:50] for it's written that Abraham had two
[1:03:53] sons the one was by a bonds woman bonds
[1:03:56] made the other by a freewoman but he who
[1:03:59] was up the bonds woman was born after
[1:04:01] the flesh but he of the freewoman was
[1:04:04] born by what
[1:04:06] and are we not born by promised God
[1:04:09] promised there would be a bride
[1:04:11] hallelujah is that right when brother
[1:04:14] Brennan drew those those those seven
[1:04:16] church age is hallelujah later she'll
[1:04:19] was completely blacking out and God
[1:04:22] allowed him to put a little strip of
[1:04:24] light there what was that
[1:04:25] God promise lord have mercy
[1:04:33] which things are an allegory for these
[1:04:36] are the two covenants the one from the
[1:04:39] mount sinai which gendereth to bondage
[1:04:41] which is agar for this a guards Mount
[1:04:44] Zion in array Sinai in Arabia and
[1:04:47] answereth to Jerusalem which now is and
[1:04:50] is in the bondage and is in bondage with
[1:04:53] her children but Jerusalem which is
[1:04:56] above is free which is the mother of us
[1:05:01] all I'm trusting you can get over you
[1:05:10] you know because I realized by God's
[1:05:13] grace that we're living in a dangerous
[1:05:14] time the world is and we're living at a
[1:05:19] time where the bride has competition
[1:05:22] there's a false bride and a true bride
[1:05:25] right and you know you and I know how
[1:05:28] many of us know it it's very difficult
[1:05:31] to get anyone out of those mega churches
[1:05:35] to hear the word you know I was
[1:05:40] difficult because it's a cage they're
[1:05:44] not free then bondage they literally
[1:05:47] married the church
[1:05:49] it's whatever my church says and what
[1:05:54] the word says is whatever months but we
[1:05:55] don't believe it that way but the word
[1:05:57] said it but that ain't the way my church
[1:05:59] teach it see that's that's their
[1:06:02] explanation and by doing that they are
[1:06:05] bondage it shows that they're not born
[1:06:06] but their birth what they're born into
[1:06:09] is a fleshly car no experience and but
[1:06:12] the to trial of God is born spiritually
[1:06:17] hallelujah
[1:06:18] how can a man be born of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:21] and not know that God is his father
[1:06:24] that's all his mother how can a baby be
[1:06:27] born a baby when it comes out of the
[1:06:29] womb knows who mama is and every birth a
[1:06:33] man gives you a revelation of who your
[1:06:36] parents are how can you say you got the
[1:06:41] Holy Ghost amen and don't see Amen that
[1:06:44] God is the one who created you made you
[1:06:46] amen and because of him you exist hello
[1:06:54] you'll never get a baby in a place where
[1:06:57] that baby don't trust her mother that
[1:07:02] baby put all of her trust into that one
[1:07:05] who know he who gave them birth that's
[1:07:08] the truth and that's the way we supposed
[1:07:11] to do God we should never grow up so
[1:07:14] much till we feel like we can be
[1:07:15] independent from him absolutely not
[1:07:23] revelation 17 tells us and I'm almost
[1:07:26] done a little bit just a little bit just
[1:07:28] give me a little more time because I
[1:07:29] want you to realize him and how valuable
[1:07:32] this revelation is to you now what is a
[1:07:34] stone and you know the diamond is the
[1:07:37] hardest of all stones and God places you
[1:07:41] in a position where he puts you on top
[1:07:44] which is the hardest of all stones and
[1:07:47] he's going to cut you he's going to chip
[1:07:50] and cut until all those seven birches be
[1:07:54] seen flowing through you cutting and
[1:07:58] chipping is not I'm sure not a good
[1:08:01] feeling if a stone could speak you
[1:08:05] probably think say to you you're killing
[1:08:07] me and but in reality you cutting and
[1:08:11] shaping him so the beauty of what's
[1:08:13] inside can come out you understand me
[1:08:18] right
[1:08:19] so he says listen he so he carries me
[1:08:23] away in the spirit of the wilderness and
[1:08:24] I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet
[1:08:26] coloured Beast full of names of
[1:08:28] blasphemy having seven heads and ten
[1:08:30] horns and the one was
[1:08:32] raid in purple and scarlet color and you
[1:08:35] can just look at the way they dress and
[1:08:37] see that but it is I forgot what they
[1:08:41] call the priest or whatever they are
[1:08:42] with the red on then they have purple
[1:08:45] all kind of colors but anyway my point
[1:08:47] is if a man you gotta be blind not to
[1:08:51] see it right what church you know is
[1:08:57] more beautiful than that one who in in
[1:08:59] Rome it's kind of spooky to me but you
[1:09:02] know to the natural man you know seeing
[1:09:05] dead things and naked folks all over the
[1:09:07] wall it's alright with them
[1:09:11] y'all understand me but when I go in
[1:09:13] there when I've never been any but I've
[1:09:15] seen pictures I said that artist he was
[1:09:18] perverted you can say whatever you want
[1:09:20] to say for someone right in that milk
[1:09:25] and people that who that's holy holy
[1:09:30] that's sinful you mean to tell me God
[1:09:33] don't cover you and then in his church
[1:09:35] you're gonna make the people naked that
[1:09:37] makes no sense it took me a long time
[1:09:51] before I would go get a kewpie burger
[1:09:53] just because of the baby
[1:09:54] [Laughter]
[1:10:02] thank you just disturb me but anyhow
[1:10:10] let's go home Oh Lord listen up rate in
[1:10:17] purple it's dollar color dick with gold
[1:10:20] and precious stones and pearls and don't
[1:10:22] you see her daughter's doing the same
[1:10:24] thing you know you go to these big Omega
[1:10:28] churches they got to work when God said
[1:10:31] let there be light and they want to put
[1:10:34] on performances they cut off the lights
[1:10:37] it's just opposite and then they got
[1:10:40] their own you know their own pillar
[1:10:42] cloud coming out of pipes and you know
[1:10:46] and it's just beautiful to the natural
[1:10:48] man like being in a concert in the dark
[1:10:53] but I guess you can see better I don't
[1:10:59] mean to be funny but my point is you
[1:11:02] know those things that appeal to those
[1:11:04] people is because they've got they're
[1:11:06] blind they can't see but a man whose
[1:11:08] eyes have been open can automatically
[1:11:11] see something's wrong with this this is
[1:11:14] not worship this is entertainment it's
[1:11:20] entertainment
[1:11:21] you got your stars and the Bible said in
[1:11:24] this day they will worship the creature
[1:11:27] more than the Creator and that's what
[1:11:30] they do singing about Jesus saying about
[1:11:33] God but they're the ones that's being
[1:11:35] worshipped Revelation that's what the
[1:11:41] false church does that's what they do
[1:11:43] but not the Living God not the living
[1:11:45] church the living church only worship
[1:11:47] the Lord Jesus hallelujah
[1:11:50] oh listen revelations 18 7 through 10 it
[1:11:56] says how much she have glorified herself
[1:11:58] lived deliciously so much torment and
[1:12:00] saw sorrow gives her for she said in her
[1:12:03] heart I sit a queen and AM no Widow and
[1:12:07] shall see no sorrow therefore shall her
[1:12:09] plagues come in one day death and
[1:12:11] mourning and famine II what God's gonna
[1:12:15] destroy her ha she's false he saw her he
[1:12:22] saw her daughters destroy everything is
[1:12:26] all know that those who will escape are
[1:12:30] those whose names are written in the
[1:12:32] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:12:34] that's it if you take anything I don't
[1:12:39] care if it's a cross on your neck and
[1:12:41] you think that cross saves you you are
[1:12:43] lost mama can't save your daddy can't
[1:12:47] save you hallelujah you and I must
[1:12:49] understand Amen that this revelation
[1:12:51] brings us to a truth Easterbrook's how
[1:12:54] can you say the things you see let me
[1:12:57] put it this way what would be your
[1:12:59] attitude
[1:12:59] you found out you lived in the day of
[1:13:01] Enoch and you was left behind Enoch was
[1:13:05] the only one saved out of his whole
[1:13:06] generation he was the only one that made
[1:13:10] a rapture anak what a percentage of a
[1:13:13] percentage at least we can say with no
[1:13:16] it was eight out of maybe eight million
[1:13:19] and one out of a million
[1:13:21] Amen perhaps made it right but when it
[1:13:25] come to Enoch it was more than that
[1:13:26] what was the percentage and the bow said
[1:13:29] as it was in the days of Sodom as it was
[1:13:31] in the days of lot don't you understand
[1:13:33] that kind of thing is coming the same
[1:13:35] way I think most of the stones have been
[1:13:37] gathered already we are living in the
[1:13:41] place where the stones are scarce now
[1:13:43] God is searching looking everywhere for
[1:13:45] that last stone that he could place in
[1:13:49] position you just trusted hope you one
[1:13:52] of those stones you said what God ain't
[1:13:59] fair yes he is God came to do one thing
[1:14:02] and that was is to redeem his own and
[1:14:06] redemption means to buy back that which
[1:14:08] was already he is now he whatever Satan
[1:14:11] did and Satan has children right but I
[1:14:14] was said more the children are the bonds
[1:14:16] woman then those are that of the free
[1:14:18] Satan produced this world with his own
[1:14:21] children because he wanted his own Eden
[1:14:23] and that's what he's got we're now
[1:14:26] living in a Eden of serpents the true
[1:14:30] Bride of Christ and she's the only real
[1:14:32] jewel she's the only real valuable thing
[1:14:36] that's why God takes his jewels he said
[1:14:39] I come in the house I break in like a
[1:14:41] thief I'll rob you of my jewels
[1:14:44] I'm gonna take my jewels back they shall
[1:14:47] be mine see and that's what we must
[1:14:51] understand we never belong to the devil
[1:14:54] the devil stole us he took us away amen
[1:14:58] in a counterfeit way hallelujah but the
[1:15:01] blood of Jesus Christ was paid paid the
[1:15:04] price amen
[1:15:05] now God can take back his you
[1:15:08] I don't know about you but I'm part of
[1:15:10] the group and in Malachi he says I'm
[1:15:14] gonna gather my Jews what do you think
[1:15:15] he's doing a man because after the
[1:15:18] rapture then you see Amen the building
[1:15:21] of God that's what always got me they
[1:15:24] coming down like jewels sapphires and
[1:15:27] carbuncles in all kinds of jewels who
[1:15:30] was it representing you you the jewels
[1:15:34] that God gathered and built his house
[1:15:38] you say what do you mean brother Brooks
[1:15:40] because the Bible said in there
[1:15:43] there was no temple God was the champion
[1:15:47] hallelujah
[1:15:48] oh come on somebody there's no building
[1:15:50] but you the building that's in the
[1:15:52] building
[1:15:53] you're the ones you the house you look
[1:15:55] stone you're God you're the one a man
[1:15:58] that builds God's habitation or God
[1:16:00] builds his habitation by way of you
[1:16:05] [Applause]
[1:16:06] that's what he said and I saw a new
[1:16:10] heaven and a new earth for the first
[1:16:11] heaven and the first earth was passed
[1:16:13] away and there was no more sea and I
[1:16:15] John saw the holy city New Jerusalem
[1:16:17] coming down from God out of heaven
[1:16:19] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[1:16:22] husband hallelujah I love it they meant
[1:16:25] because what God did God told Joshua and
[1:16:29] Moses said you tell Moses you tell oh
[1:16:31] those daughters tell him to get all
[1:16:33] those jewels and stuff from Pharaoh
[1:16:35] gather everything you can gather amen
[1:16:38] let the daughters put on all kinds of
[1:16:39] jury because what we we have spoiled
[1:16:42] them we have we've destroyed them and we
[1:16:44] taken all the valuables with us
[1:16:47] hallelujah amen and what did he do they
[1:16:50] said let us bury this ha ha
[1:16:52] they knew they weren't gonna return
[1:16:54] hallelujah and they got all the jewels
[1:16:56] and took him out that's what God's doing
[1:17:00] and he's getting all the valuables right
[1:17:04] out of either before he destroy him Oh
[1:17:07] glory to God I'm almost done
[1:17:09] amen and I heard a great voice from
[1:17:11] heaven saying behold the tabernacle of
[1:17:13] God is with men and he shall dwell with
[1:17:15] them ah-dah-mah
[1:17:18] and they shall be his people where
[1:17:21] minute the tabernacle of God is with men
[1:17:24] and he will dwell with them and they
[1:17:28] shall be his people and God himself
[1:17:31] shall be with them and be their God and
[1:17:34] God shall wipe away all tears from their
[1:17:37] eyes and there shall be no more death
[1:17:40] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[1:17:42] there be any more pain for the former
[1:17:44] things are passed away and he that sat
[1:17:47] upon the throne said behold I make all
[1:17:51] things new and he said write for these
[1:17:54] words are true and faithful and he said
[1:17:57] unto me it's done I am Alpha and Omega
[1:18:00] the beginning and the end the
[1:18:02] Cornerstone a headstone I would give
[1:18:05] unto him that is athirst of the fountain
[1:18:07] of the waters of life freely
[1:18:09] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[1:18:11] things and I will be his God and he
[1:18:14] shall be my son but the fearful and
[1:18:18] unbelieving the abominable the murderers
[1:18:22] whoremongers sorcerers idolaters and all
[1:18:26] Liars shall have their part in the lake
[1:18:29] which burneth with fire and brimstone
[1:18:31] which is the second death so you see God
[1:18:35] even give the children of disobedience a
[1:18:37] stone but it's called brimstone oh lord
[1:18:45] have mercy
[1:18:46] I love this alas Kerchak lycée built on
[1:18:53] because that's what comes out of the
[1:18:54] earth
[1:18:57] brimstone don't come from heaven it
[1:19:00] comes out of the earth he comes right
[1:19:02] out of hell where they came from so you
[1:19:04] said we're Brotherhood's don't talk so
[1:19:06] hoarse but that's what it is
[1:19:07] Jesus talk hard she said hey you of your
[1:19:10] father the devil he whatever he did you
[1:19:14] gonna do it too right oh lord help me
[1:19:17] Jesus ate and the Builder the building
[1:19:23] of the walls of it was Jasper look at
[1:19:24] this and the city was pure gold like
[1:19:26] unto a clear crystal and the foundation
[1:19:30] of the wall of the drive were garnished
[1:19:31] with all manner of precious stones
[1:19:36] the first foundation was jasper the
[1:19:39] second sapphire the third you see what
[1:19:41] I'm saying
[1:19:42] he foundation and of stone and each
[1:19:45] stone was a different color the fourth
[1:19:48] an emerald the fifth sawdust the six
[1:19:52] dunks the sixth sardius the seventh you
[1:19:56] know it goes all the way down to the
[1:19:58] twelfth and you got to understand each
[1:20:01] what do you mean each one of those
[1:20:03] stones represented an apostle
[1:20:09] so each apostle had a stone that means
[1:20:12] all of them did works that were
[1:20:14] different from one or another and as the
[1:20:17] brother and I was talking today amen
[1:20:20] there are some of those apostles you
[1:20:23] haven't you haven't you didn't hear
[1:20:24] nothing about them other than they were
[1:20:27] apostles but they did what they were
[1:20:30] supposed to do and there are stones that
[1:20:33] represent them their victory many of us
[1:20:38] where are we you got you got william
[1:20:41] branham you can see his scriptures
[1:20:43] throughout the scripture but where are
[1:20:45] you you're one of those stones that's in
[1:20:47] their right laid out there with him
[1:20:51] is that right oh come on the truth is
[1:20:54] it's the truth he said my people that
[1:20:57] God gave under his ministry but look at
[1:21:00] this he's not here so whose ministry are
[1:21:03] you really under acts that's all I'm
[1:21:07] saying
[1:21:08] and don't you know this age gets a
[1:21:12] greater reward out of all of the ages
[1:21:15] your world war will be greater that's
[1:21:17] what he said that's what he said what
[1:21:23] are you saying
[1:21:23] because when L either left off the scene
[1:21:26] Isaac became Rebecca's husband it was
[1:21:31] Isaac that talk Rebecca from that point
[1:21:33] on you understand me
[1:21:41] lord help me Jesus but you got to
[1:21:43] understand he said nothing different for
[1:21:45] what
[1:21:45] but Eleazar said now and I saw no temple
[1:21:48] therein for the Lord God Almighty and
[1:21:52] the lamb are the temple of it and the
[1:21:55] city had no need for the Sun neither of
[1:21:58] the moon to shine it in but the glory of
[1:22:01] God did lighten it and the lamb is the
[1:22:03] light thereof y'all understand whoo this
[1:22:07] whole natural thing was spiritual from
[1:22:10] the beginning and even though we'll be
[1:22:14] witnessing natural things it's because
[1:22:16] of the spiritual things that stood
[1:22:18] before the natural hallelujah we'll have
[1:22:24] a body but it made a spiritual body a
[1:22:28] body that can walk through the wall a
[1:22:30] body that can travel like a thought
[1:22:33] hallelujah
[1:22:34] a body that can heat hallelujah and you
[1:22:39] say well high in the world that can be
[1:22:40] because God took a word body and he took
[1:22:44] that same dust that she was bought
[1:22:46] brought into this world with that was
[1:22:48] cursed because it was Harvard he took
[1:22:50] that same dust Amen and made a glorified
[1:22:53] body out of it but it's still dust still
[1:22:58] made out of the same stuff a rock is
[1:23:00] made out of y'all done I'm done
[1:23:03] yes I'm done and they shall bring listen
[1:23:07] you know when and I don't know whether I
[1:23:09] ever heard brother Chris Hall priest but
[1:23:12] he preached years ago about the glory of
[1:23:14] God and it was to me it was phenomena
[1:23:17] like I don't know too many preachers to
[1:23:20] this day that could bring the word like
[1:23:21] he did it's a strange thing but
[1:23:24] nevertheless when when I saw that
[1:23:29] scripture on the New Jerusalem ascended
[1:23:32] with the glory of God it meant God
[1:23:37] Himself was in there he was in her
[1:23:42] that's how come she had his glory she
[1:23:46] was in him he was in her and at that
[1:23:49] time they had become a wine right it's
[1:23:53] the truth because
[1:23:54] in the beginning it was Adam and though
[1:23:57] she had a feminine part the feminine
[1:24:00] part only recede the glory of the
[1:24:02] masculine part because the feminine had
[1:24:04] not yet been seen and after that y'all
[1:24:07] know what happened but now she becomes
[1:24:09] him and the same glory y'all is beyond
[1:24:13] comprehension you can grasp it in your
[1:24:16] mind you just got to believe it it's
[1:24:19] good to say she descended with the glory
[1:24:22] of God that Stan is beyond anything
[1:24:25] that's there it's beyond anything you
[1:24:27] can comprehend usually could only only
[1:24:29] thing you can do is believe what he says
[1:24:31] we are in a position and them telling
[1:24:34] you there is no way I pray this way we
[1:24:37] we talk like this we talk oh god please
[1:24:40] don't don't let me miss it but in
[1:24:42] reality of your bride you can't it's
[1:24:48] what he has done and he is determined to
[1:24:54] see you through do you really think like
[1:24:58] brother once said that God went through
[1:25:00] Calvary to lose one he went through all
[1:25:04] that agony with hope ah
[1:25:07] he understood the process he knew and
[1:25:11] seen the outcome and you and I are part
[1:25:15] of that outcome there is no way all I
[1:25:18] can say is if you have the faith to
[1:25:20] believe it then you have the faith to
[1:25:22] receive it that's all it is if you got
[1:25:26] faith to believe it just receive it and
[1:25:28] that faith by receiving it would become
[1:25:31] a reality to you old brother Brooks
[1:25:33] about how I'm gonna do it you're not
[1:25:34] doing it now it's God in you that's
[1:25:38] doing it hallelujah
[1:25:41] it's like Adam getting up out from the
[1:25:43] ground and said long look what I made
[1:25:46] God made Adam
[1:25:50] I don't wanna be whatever he would have
[1:25:52] been the dust of the ground whatever he
[1:25:53] would have been but it was God who made
[1:25:55] Adam and if God made the man like that
[1:25:57] in the beginning he must make the man
[1:25:59] like that I mean he is not by works it's
[1:26:04] grace you know that's the way it was
[1:26:06] supposed to be in the beginning by
[1:26:08] Sun God chose you you didn't choosing
[1:26:12] him and listen there is no failure in
[1:26:15] God hallelujah
[1:26:17] you said oh well I've got so many
[1:26:19] problems did you know God knew that
[1:26:20] before he called you you got Gardner
[1:26:26] said well this person is either that
[1:26:27] person is in bad shape I hope I can get
[1:26:30] it straight
[1:26:30] no God knew you know God don't take take
[1:26:34] easy things and work with he takes the
[1:26:36] bad stuff to work with y'all no but yeah
[1:26:39] do y'all know that look at his Bible
[1:26:41] look through the word God didn't take
[1:26:44] the righteous you know matter of fact
[1:26:46] everybody they thought there was
[1:26:47] righteous God Jesus said you lost if you
[1:26:50] say I see he said you're blind it's when
[1:26:54] a man can see his condition and won't
[1:26:56] out of it those are the people that God
[1:26:58] can work with oh I so love him I love
[1:27:03] him because every time I think if he
[1:27:06] took all that massive darkness all that
[1:27:08] chaos he said let there be light and
[1:27:11] everything had to go for myself right
[1:27:14] into him you just a little a piece of a
[1:27:19] rock you mean to tell me God can't
[1:27:21] handle your problem God can transform
[1:27:25] you he transformed so that you could be
[1:27:29] planted into it my God and our God is
[1:27:34] God and when I'm closing that's one
[1:27:39] thing I did learn from the 10
[1:27:45] commandments when the Pharaoh said his
[1:27:48] God is God
[1:27:55] I stuck with me amen and think about you
[1:28:06] and I serve the same God Moses Sarah
[1:28:09] whoo hallelujah let's just have a word
[1:28:13] of Prayer father so thank you you're so
[1:28:17] good to me

[1:28:41] doing with us it gives us great strength
[1:28:43] and hope it increases our faith and love
[1:28:46] in you Lord because we realize we don't
[1:28:49] deserve it Lord
[1:28:50] we really don't there's nothing good
[1:28:53] about us not within ourselves nor with
[1:28:55] fallen creature Lord we're more beasts
[1:28:57] than man and father you have transformed
[1:29:00] us by giving us your Holy Spirit by
[1:29:03] taking your word and recreating us O
[1:29:05] Lord we haven't come to that place where
[1:29:08] we desire but we see you changing us
[1:29:11] from day to day from glory to glory and
[1:29:13] father we are so thankful more than we
[1:29:16] can express because I know that all
[1:29:18] darkness at the end of the day will be
[1:29:21] expelled from each and every one of our
[1:29:22] lives we will be the true light will be
[1:29:25] the reflection the very image of your
[1:29:28] being Lord I don't know I've never been
[1:29:31] there before in my own mind but I can
[1:29:34] hardly wait till you have complete
[1:29:37] control and complete reflection through
[1:29:41] us let your perfect will be done out
