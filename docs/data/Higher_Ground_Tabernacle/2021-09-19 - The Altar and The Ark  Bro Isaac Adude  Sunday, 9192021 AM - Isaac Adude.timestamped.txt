[37:06] so i've
[37:20] and i will commune with you from above
[37:23] from above the mercy
[37:25] from between the two cherubims which are
[37:28] upon the ark of the testimony
[37:31] of all things which i will give the
[37:34] commandment unto
[38:02] first john
[38:05] [Music]
[38:11] my little children
[38:13] these things right unto you that you see
[38:17] not and if any man sin you have an
[38:20] absolute head with the father jesus
[38:23] christ the righteous
[38:24] amen
[38:26] and he is the prophetication for our
[38:28] sins and not for us only but also for
[38:32] the sins of the whole world
[38:42] remember
[38:56] but we pray your father god that you
[38:58] bring into reputation
[39:09] jesus
[39:11] christ amen

[39:54] from between the two cherubims which are
[39:56] upon the ark of the testimony
[40:02] of all things which i will give me in
[40:04] commandment unto the children
[40:22] in other words
[40:50] eve didn't need any order to meet god
[40:56] you need any kind of you know material
[40:59] to be in contact with god
[41:01] foreign
[41:51] [Music]
[42:27] which means to be aligned with god
[42:30] kissing
[42:30] me and the dream and because the law
[42:32] required death
[42:36] and then
[42:38] then the altar was in the holy in the
[42:40] holy place
[43:02] amen because
[43:03] passing because when you go uh in the
[43:06] holies of holy only uh the the chief
[43:08] priests were allowed to go there
[43:22] now the other court represented
[43:24] justification
[43:38] before the minister
[43:43] and the altar represented the sacrifice
[43:45] place where the punishment
[43:48] was put or expelled
[44:12] [Music]
[44:24] [Music]
[45:28] because jeremiah
[45:29] 31 33
[45:43] after those days
[45:52] [Music]
[46:02] [Music]
[46:24] [Music]
[46:38] jeremiah
[46:53] it will no longer write this word or it
[46:56] will it will no longer write its laws
[46:58] into you know stones
[47:04] but in that time the laws of god will be
[47:06] written in the hearts of people
[47:36] amen jeremiah
[47:48] will be placed in the heart of the
[47:50] people
[48:21] then said he lo i come to the lord i
[48:24] come to you thy will oh god
[48:27] he taketh away the the first
[48:29] that he may establish the second
[48:32] what
[48:43] we are sanctified through the offering
[48:46] of the body of jesus christ once more
[48:52] [Music]
[48:54] and every priest standeth daily
[48:56] ministering and offering oftentimes the
[49:00] same sacrifices which can never take
[49:02] away
[49:11] but this man talking about jesus
[49:14] after
[49:16] [Music]
[49:39] he has perfected
[49:40] forever them that are
[49:45] [Music]
[49:54] for after that he had said before
[50:10] and in their minds without right there
[50:14] and their sins and the iniquities will
[50:16] remain will not remember no more
[50:21] now where remission
[50:23] of this is
[50:38] amen he offered his sacrifice once for
[50:40] all
[50:44] for our sins
[50:47] and then he said that after that
[50:51] god will
[50:53] his rise or his soul in our hearts
[50:58] you know nobody will have to be a
[51:00] teacher of others
[51:04] because everybody will
[51:06] know the word
[52:23] [Music]
[52:30] we
[52:58] and then in the
[53:12] i want
[53:22] you know they can't deviate between the
[53:24] altar and the holiest and the holy
[53:26] spirit
[53:29] they can't deviate between the
[53:31] alternatives
[53:32] [Music]
[53:39] where the church are to be holy
[53:53] that's the reason we have our days that
[53:56] we have uh uh and the lack of faith um
[54:02] the monk before you know that that's the
[54:04] reason why we have the lack of faith see
[54:06] that something is the holy monk before
[54:08] when the
[54:46] is a scientific scientific proof
[54:49] that we are at the
[54:59] and here the church is still
[55:02] daily outside here it was
[55:47] uh light
[55:48] from the candlestick on the light from
[55:50] the kind of scene
[55:54] amen amen they had to depend on that lie
[55:58] amen if the light had oil
[56:43] was the voice based on the light from
[56:45] the candlesticks
[56:53] those people were depending on the sun
[57:10] amen you see those people
[57:23] remember when the sun goes
[57:37] now those people become cool
[58:32] jesus
[58:48] himself
[59:16] amen
[59:31] you know the sun has to shine for 12
[59:33] hours and then you have 12 hours of
[59:34] nights
[59:39] in life
[1:00:41] in the manner that was coming that was
[1:00:43] falling in the outer court
[1:00:47] that was a manner that people were going
[1:00:48] to eat for one day
[1:00:50] man
[1:00:51] that was a man
[1:00:53] image that people were waiting
[1:01:32] amen the holy spirit can fall you know
[1:01:35] to the righteous and the unrighteous
[1:01:54] [Music]
[1:02:04] and doing
[1:02:18] is
[1:02:31] kept in our hearts
[1:03:00] [Music]
[1:03:28] he
[1:04:38] amen
[1:04:52] and the prophet
[1:06:15] he's just wonderful
[1:06:55] but you haven't consecrated your life
[1:07:12] we
[1:08:50] amen even
[1:09:32] my children
[1:10:24] [Music]
[1:10:41] remember when jesus died on the cross
[1:10:44] the bible says that you read in the
[1:10:46] bible
[1:10:51] amen by him by rendering the bear
[1:10:54] on the shoulder amen he put the ark and
[1:10:56] the alter in the same room
[1:11:00] it meant to make a complete worship
[1:11:04] where you have the sacrifice and then
[1:11:06] you have the words
[1:11:09] together
[1:11:51] jesus christ
[1:12:06] is
[1:12:48] we had to
[1:13:01] he went to that place because if we read
[1:13:05] in uh uh uh
[1:13:07] a second chronicles
[1:13:09] of the syllogism
[1:13:11] the second chronicles chapter 26
[1:13:14] chapter 4
[1:13:15] 16 to 20.
[1:13:29] is
[1:13:44] because he wasn't a
[1:13:57] but when he was wrong
[1:14:00] his heart was lifted to his disruption
[1:14:05] because if you read that story
[1:14:11] became a king when he was
[1:14:26] himself himself
[1:14:28] it took the place of the chief priests
[1:14:37] bible says i continued
[1:14:40] but when he was wrong his heart was
[1:14:42] lifted up to his destruction
[1:14:47] for he transgressed against the lord
[1:14:52] and wanted the temple
[1:14:54] of the lord
[1:15:23] osia the king and said unto him
[1:15:27] uh uh
[1:15:28] he belongs not unto him
[1:15:31] to burn his incense onto the lord
[1:15:34] but to the priest
[1:15:36] but to the priest the sons of aaron
[1:15:39] that are consecrated to burn instances
[1:15:41] go out of the sanctuary for thou has
[1:15:44] transparency
[1:15:45] neither shall they feed or die
[1:15:49] from the lord
[1:16:14] in his hand to burn instances
[1:16:17] and while he was brought with the priest
[1:16:20] the leprosy even rolls up in his
[1:16:22] forehead before the priesthood in the
[1:16:24] house of the lord
[1:16:26] from society into his heart
[1:16:41] the chief priest and all the priests
[1:16:44] looked upon him and behold with leprosy
[1:16:59] is
[1:17:14] god
[1:18:07] will be heard from god
[1:18:25] uh uh elijah

[1:21:10] and until whom the word of the lord
[1:21:26] about the altar as the great as great as
[1:21:30] uh as greatest would contain two
[1:21:33] measures
[1:21:55] came here and said lord god of abraham
[1:21:58] isaac and israel
[1:22:00] let it be known this day the hell our
[1:22:03] god in israel and that i am thy servant
[1:22:06] and that i have done all these things as

[1:22:29] sacrifice
[1:22:31] and the wood and the stones and the dust
[1:22:34] and licked up the water that
[1:22:46] and when all the people saw it they fell
[1:22:49] on their faces
[1:22:50] and they say the lord is the lord is the
[1:22:54] god
[1:22:55] the lord
[1:23:02] amen
[1:23:31] amen and then after that you put

[1:26:09] amen people started to sprinkle people
[1:26:11] for the baptism
[1:26:18] amen but when he came he had to restore
[1:26:20] it to the immersion
[1:26:23] amen representing the death and the
[1:26:25] resurrection of jesus of jesus christ
[1:26:30] and then he had to restore the mystery
[1:26:32] of the father who the sonship and the
[1:26:33] holy ghost and
[1:26:46] amen it's not three separate beings or
[1:26:48] the father is not the the son and the
[1:26:50] son is not the holy ghost
[1:26:58] and then there is no three people there
[1:27:00] is no three people in god or three
[1:27:02] persons in god
[1:27:05] but it's the same god
[1:27:08] amen manifesting himself
[1:27:11] amen as the father they don't compare
[1:27:13] amen as the son cometh
[1:27:16] and that's the holy ghost
[1:27:27] in the name of jesus christ
[1:27:31] [Music]

[1:28:19] and he had the same spirit as elijah
[1:28:22] remember
[1:28:23] he restored all those things
[1:28:26] we're meant to restore the communion
[1:28:27] that that was between god and a human
[1:28:32] amen
