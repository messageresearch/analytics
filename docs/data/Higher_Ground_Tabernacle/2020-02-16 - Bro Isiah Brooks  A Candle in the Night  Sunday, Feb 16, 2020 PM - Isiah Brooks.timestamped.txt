[11:49] the Living God fall afresh on me break

[12:12] [Music]
[12:24] fresh fresh for Fred or me a melt me
[13:02] mold me feel me
[13:10] spirit of the Living God for you love
[13:25] the Lord we thank God for His grace
[13:32] looking at just Olivia she all dressed
[13:35] up looking real pretty tonight a man we
[13:40] think are for his goodness and God's
[13:43] grace I am so glad to know that I'm one
[13:50] of them
[13:50] and we're going to just get right on
[13:55] into the word of the Lord thank God for
[14:00] all of you who have come out to the
[14:01] house of God tonight seeing that we are
[14:05] in a time where there is a great falling
[14:09] away all over the world I think often
[14:13] times people think that a falling away
[14:16] means that they are not no longer going
[14:19] to the church assembly but not so
[14:23] falling away is when people fail in
[14:28] making God their first the first love is
[14:32] what he wants to be and wants to remain
[14:35] and we find out that the early church
[14:38] that's what their problem was that they
[14:42] had fallen away from their first love
[14:44] and and I think that's where we are
[14:46] today many people are feeling church
[14:50] buildings but there are so many who are
[14:54] not in love with the Lord Jesus Christ
[14:57] like they used to be anyway let us turn
[15:01] to 2nd Peter please we'll start there at
[15:05] the first chapter and we'll begin
[15:08] reading at the 8th verse first Peter God
[15:14] is so good to us really there are no
[15:17] words to explain or Express you know our
[15:21] gratitude to war
[15:24] there are no words in the English
[15:27] language that can say how much we really
[15:30] love and care for him I just have this
[15:34] thing in my heart that when we get to
[15:36] heaven there'll be a perfect language
[15:39] there where we won't have to worry about
[15:42] did I express it just exactly the way I
[15:45] felt to say it
[15:47] it'll be accurate it'll be perfect
[15:50] and it will be the exact thing that God
[15:53] will want to hear from us when we see
[15:56] what this confusion has done of course
[16:00] many people say that English is a
[16:05] legitimate language it's a better us
[16:07] another word for it
[16:08] but how but it is definitely difficult
[16:14] to express yourself in in the language
[16:18] of English because English words you
[16:22] could have many words spelt to say way
[16:25] but mean a different thing or you know
[16:30] it's just like the word God God in
[16:33] itself could mean a lot of things could
[16:36] mean people it could mean animals it
[16:38] could mean a lot of things so when we
[16:43] but when it comes to we're real worship
[16:47] when we say thank you God often time is
[16:50] which one you're talking about who are
[16:53] you talking about but when we say thank
[16:56] you Lord Jesus
[16:57] we know who we speaking of 2nd Peter 1 8
[17:01] through 11 for if these things be in you
[17:07] and abound they make you that ye shall
[17:09] neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
[17:12] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[17:15] he didn't like it those these things is
[17:18] built his blind scuse me and cannot see
[17:20] afar off and have forgotten that he was
[17:25] once purged from his old sins wherefore
[17:29] the rather brethren give diligence to
[17:31] make your calling and election sure and
[17:34] that scripture
[17:36] always strike me make your calling and
[17:41] election sure sure
[17:44] right so if you do these things you
[17:48] shall never fall for so an entrance it
[17:52] shall be ministered unto you abundantly
[17:53] into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord
[17:57] and Savior Jesus Christ one more
[18:03] scripture I believe this out of Matthew
[18:06] the fifth chapter
[18:19] Matthew 5:16 let your light so shine
[18:24] before men that they may see your good
[18:28] works and glorify your father which is
[18:33] in heaven now you're gonna probably
[18:37] wonder where I'm going with this but let
[18:40] us pray and let's see which way God will
[18:42] take us father God we come before your
[18:45] Lord Jesus as humbly as we know how we
[18:48] approach your throne in reverence and
[18:51] thanksgiving we thank you for being so
[18:54] good to us Lord as we say often you have
[18:58] been better to us than we've been to
[19:00] ourselves Father we pray Lord this
[19:04] evening there would be fewer of us that
[19:07] you will minister to each and every one
[19:11] of us even to the hearts of the young
[19:13] people bless us now as we surrender our
[19:17] body soul and spirit unto you have
[19:21] preeminence here tonight and father
[19:22] we'll be careful to give you the praise
[19:25] glory and honor in your name Jesus
[19:27] Christ we pray amen you may be seated I
[19:38] like to entitle this message a candle in
[19:42] the night all of us know what a candle
[19:49] is it's it's lit to give sight in the
[19:55] night and the Bible tells us that we are
[20:00] a city that sets upon a hill that when
[20:04] God likes to candle the candle is truly
[20:07] lit but we know by God's grace that we
[20:13] are living in a time where the darkness
[20:16] is perhaps the darkest has ever been in
[20:19] the history of man we see by God's grace
[20:24] that everything that the Bible has
[20:26] prophesied is coming to pass men ha
[20:32] it's a feeling because of fear we've
[20:35] never lived in such an age where heart
[20:38] attacks is on the ramp it we see the
[20:41] cancer is something that has flooded the
[20:46] human race and we know that this is the
[20:50] age that we're living in we see that man
[20:55] has destroyed the very thing that God
[20:58] created for him and that's Earth and
[21:02] when we see the earthquakes in diverse
[21:05] places and storms raging and all of
[21:09] these things we know the Bible says that
[21:13] we ought to look up because our
[21:14] Redemption draweth nigh we fail to see
[21:19] that this world is a world that is
[21:24] temporal there is no continuing City
[21:28] here I have expressed this many times
[21:32] how that when we think we have a place
[21:36] to stay in resides died somehow
[21:39] something happens and you've got to move
[21:42] to another location but sometimes the
[21:45] places that you once live is so torn
[21:48] down and there there's no nothing there
[21:53] left to identify that you once lived
[21:55] there but there is a place there is a
[22:00] kingdom that kid can never fail and in
[22:05] that place we are all looking forward to
[22:09] going to the gospel of Jesus Christ have
[22:14] been brought to us as a way of salvation
[22:18] and without the gospel of Jesus Christ
[22:21] there is no salvation because there's
[22:24] one Lord one faith and one baptism we
[22:28] know that by God's grace because of the
[22:31] sin that we have all been born in the
[22:35] Bible said we were conceived in sin and
[22:39] shaped in iniquity and we came in this
[22:43] world speaking lies but
[22:46] there is something on the inside that
[22:48] cries out this is not right something's
[22:54] wrong with this situation and and the
[22:56] more we look into that voice that's
[22:59] crying out we find out that we are
[23:02] looking for something greater something
[23:04] different than this world and what we
[23:08] have been born into we realized by God's
[23:12] grace by the powerful message that Jesus
[23:15] Christ brought to Nicodemus because
[23:18] Nicodemus a man wanted to know how to be
[23:23] saved and we know that the Bible said
[23:27] Nicodemus was of a Pharisee and and he
[23:31] came to Jesus by night and we find out
[23:37] that Jesus dropped something in on
[23:39] Nicodemus that he had never heard before
[23:41] and he said Nicodemus that which his
[23:45] flesh is flesh that which a spirit in
[23:49] spirit I wouldn't tell you something you
[23:53] must be born again and with all of the
[23:57] great intellect that Nicodemus had he
[23:59] could not conceive it he couldn't
[24:01] understand it it wasn't a stupid
[24:03] question because had I been Nicodemus I
[24:06] would have asked the same question well
[24:09] the only way I know that I was born I
[24:12] came from my mama do doesn't mean does
[24:15] it mean that I must enter into my
[24:17] mother's womb again and be born see he
[24:21] didn't understand it wasn't a stupid
[24:23] question it was logical but we find out
[24:28] that the Word of God is not logical
[24:30] jesus said unto Nicodemus that which is
[24:33] flesh is flesh that which is spirit and
[24:37] spirit you must be born again
[24:40] and we find out that that is the only
[24:43] way that we can leave this world there
[24:48] is a portal that scientists have tried
[24:51] to find there is a portal that actually
[24:55] exists in the only way the poor only
[24:59] open up to us
[25:00] is that we must be born again not of
[25:05] flesh and blood
[25:07] and not by the will of man but by the
[25:11] will of God we know and I'm jumping a
[25:15] lot of things because the message is
[25:17] quite long but I realized by this
[25:20] evening that a lot of people don't
[25:24] understand that the only way that you
[25:26] can get to heaven is that you must be
[25:29] born again and when I say born again I
[25:31] mean you must have the Holy Ghost and a
[25:36] lot of people in every denomination
[25:38] believe that they have the Holy Ghost
[25:41] but I questioned their testimony because
[25:51] everybody know and have heard that Jesus
[25:56] Christ is Lord preachers are saying it
[26:01] and they're right the Bible says it and
[26:05] is right mama can say it and it's right
[26:11] but you will never know that it's right
[26:15] accept it come by the Holy Ghost is that
[26:20] the Bible the Bible says no man can know
[26:23] that Jesus is the Christ accepted be by
[26:27] the Holy Ghost now the Holy Ghost is not
[26:31] just a thing it's God and the Holy Ghost
[26:37] amen we'll bring you to a full statue of
[26:43] Christ see that's the thing we claim to
[26:48] have it but we were to possess it but
[26:53] you don't want to possess it because it
[26:57] possesses you when the Holy Ghost comes
[27:01] it comes as an infant it comes as a
[27:05] child and as it grows it continued to
[27:10] grow and Paul says I like to see it like
[27:13] this if
[27:14] there be an evolution we move through
[27:19] this evolution from glory to glory right
[27:23] amen we move from justification to
[27:26] sanctification from sanctification to
[27:29] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[27:31] and from the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[27:33] we move into the person of Christ
[27:36] himself
[27:37] but the power of God is within the gene
[27:41] within the seed that he planted in you
[27:44] before the foundation of the world God
[27:48] did not tell us to be lights of the
[27:52] world and did not prepare us to be
[27:58] lights in the world I think about those
[28:01] little we call them lightning gales now
[28:04] I could be wrong in the pronunciation
[28:07] because I was a little boy and we
[28:08] twisted everything up we used to say
[28:12] grasshoppers and hopper grass you know
[28:14] to me but nevertheless those little
[28:18] little bugs that come out at night and
[28:21] they flash their little tails and we
[28:23] were little terrible little boys we we
[28:25] catch those things and then pull the
[28:27] tails off just to see whether the light
[28:29] would go out or not not realizing those
[28:32] little creatures have a right to live
[28:34] especially when they don't live long
[28:36] anyway but nevertheless we know that a
[28:40] lot of time people think that the Holy
[28:42] Ghost is speaking in tongues and
[28:44] shouting and dancing running up the
[28:46] aisle and of course a lot of those
[28:48] things are attributes but the Holy Ghost
[28:52] is life as simple is that the Holy Ghost
[28:59] is the life of God and if we say we've
[29:04] got the Holy Ghost
[29:06] then the Holy Ghost must live through us
[29:09] it will behave itself just like it
[29:14] behaved itself or himself in Jesus
[29:19] Christ is that right you take a person
[29:23] that speak with tongues and enough and
[29:25] still they can't control the
[29:28] temper yet they say they got the holy
[29:31] ghost
[29:32] hallelujah you take a person a man who
[29:36] talks about their neighboring and
[29:38] everything like that yet they say
[29:41] they've got the Holy Ghost the Holy
[29:44] Ghost is meekness joy peace low
[29:49] suffering patience gentleness right
[29:52] faith that's what the Holy Ghost is the
[29:56] fruits of the spirit
[29:58] now fruits of the spirit so if the
[30:03] spirit is in there when it produces and
[30:06] bring forth life it will produce
[30:08] patience it will produce meekness is
[30:12] that right you'll never see a orange
[30:14] tree at a grocery store shopping for
[30:17] oranges because the oranges are what the
[30:21] tree produces naturally and all that
[30:25] tree has to do is to stay in the
[30:28] presence of the Sun is that right listen
[30:32] we say Amen that we have the Holy Ghost
[30:37] but let me keep continue on as I say if
[30:42] the Holy Ghost is in a person it will
[30:46] shine it will manifest itself this is
[30:52] what I how how can I say this Lord but
[30:57] when I see a person like Daniel who was
[31:00] a candle in the night that's what I call
[31:02] him Amen there was hardly anyone coming
[31:10] to his prayer meeting I don't know where
[31:13] the Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[31:15] started out with him but in the depth of
[31:20] the night time for Daniel we find that
[31:26] he was the only light or candle lit in
[31:30] Babylon he was God's witness because let
[31:35] me tell you something God never leaves
[31:38] himself without a witness
[31:42] hallelujah I don't know about you but I
[31:46] want to be a candle in the night I want
[31:49] to be the light if everything around me
[31:52] is black and dark if everything around
[31:54] me you can't see I want to be that one
[31:58] that can be seen from a distance a
[32:01] candle in the night I know that I can't
[32:05] be that of myself but I know that God
[32:12] can make it happen
[32:13] Daniel see the key of being a candle a
[32:17] key of keeping the fire lit his prayer
[32:21] the Bible said that Daniel prayed three
[32:24] times a day he prayed and he kept that
[32:28] fire amen in a place where others got
[32:32] jealous hallelujah that's what you want
[32:35] you want the light of God to be so
[32:38] illuminating in you till others will see
[32:40] you either they will want it or they
[32:43] will hate you for having it a candle in
[32:46] the night we find out that that's what
[32:49] happened to Daniel the men of Babylon
[32:53] was so jealous of him they tried to get
[32:55] him killed and all he was doing was
[32:58] praying and worshiping God you
[33:02] understand me what a candle is sometimes
[33:06] you all by yourself but at the same time
[33:10] you've got enough light that can draw
[33:13] other men unto you you know what I'm
[33:16] saying now we realize
[33:18] Amen that many people don't understand
[33:22] that the Holy Ghost is not some mental
[33:26] uh-uh how can I say it something you do
[33:30] mentally work up you know work up the
[33:34] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is and the
[33:37] Bible tells us that they that received
[33:41] him gladly received him receive the Holy
[33:44] Ghost you can hear the word you can
[33:47] discuss the word you can do everything
[33:50] with the word but until you receive
[33:54] it ya hear me you must receive the word
[33:59] that's what's wrong with a lot of people
[34:01] they come here in the church they hear
[34:03] the word they go out they discuss the
[34:06] word they talk about how good it was or
[34:08] how bad or what the preacher said they
[34:11] didn't like whatever it is whatever
[34:13] their opinion of it of the word is it
[34:16] really doesn't matter but have you
[34:18] received you see them saying just like I
[34:22] was saying this morning I said they came
[34:25] to Baptist preachers in the book of Acts
[34:27] and they said have you received the Holy
[34:32] Ghost since you believe so oh I believe
[34:35] the message but just believe the message
[34:39] can become a Baptist doctrine you see it
[34:42] is not believing the message is
[34:45] receiving the message receiving the
[34:48] message will impregnate you receiving
[34:52] the message will bring forth fruits
[34:55] receiving the message why you say that
[34:58] brother books because the message is the
[35:00] Word of God and see form and if you
[35:03] allow God to plant the seed the seed
[35:07] will produce the word for the hour
[35:12] y'all understand me I used Daniel for an
[35:19] example and there were others who we
[35:24] could use but the next person I want to
[35:27] use is Esther I love Esther because she
[35:32] was a candle in the night now when it
[35:37] comes to Esther at Vesta you know what
[35:41] vast I mean that drinks she's a type of
[35:45] a drunken Christian a person who uh
[35:49] who's drunk of the word drunk off
[35:51] themselves you know people they love
[35:54] themselves more than they love God
[35:56] that's the Bible in the last day many
[36:00] will love themselves more than they love
[36:02] God
[36:03] drunken because only a drunk person can
[36:07] make
[36:08] such our decisions that makes no sense
[36:12] you saw what do you mean brother Brooks
[36:14] here it was vas die and I'm jumping but
[36:18] vast I was called by the king Asura to
[36:22] come and sit in his presence it is the
[36:26] king who chose her somehow she forgotten
[36:30] all the purifications that she had gone
[36:34] through to get there somehow she forgot
[36:37] hey men who she really was and maybe she
[36:41] was so blessed she thought she was more
[36:44] than what she really was now you know
[36:47] that's what happened amen in the time of
[36:50] Saul Saul was so blessed by God he he
[36:53] got out of position and began to offer
[36:56] up offerings when that was only meant
[36:58] for the priests and God took amen Saul's
[37:01] kingship away from him so that's what we
[37:04] do sometimes God can bless her so well
[37:06] till we forget amen our position and
[37:11] that's what happened a man with vast
[37:14] died of nasty she forgot her position
[37:17] and she said to the king I come in she
[37:22] was having her own party and that's
[37:26] what's happening to a lot of the
[37:27] churches they're like nasty they have in
[37:30] their own party their own church
[37:34] services comparing the word discussing
[37:38] the word dissecting the word but never
[37:43] receiving the word and vasti amen
[37:48] because she denied her headship
[37:51] oh come on somebody see every woman that
[37:56] denies her headship that man has a right
[38:00] to put her away hello now you said what
[38:06] do you mean because in that day polygamy
[38:09] was in effect a man could have as many
[38:12] wives as he wont to but that woman could
[38:14] only have one husband and that's where
[38:18] people don't understand that God
[38:21] there's all these people coming in
[38:24] auditioning wanting to be bribed now let
[38:30] me go to the story because I ain't gonna
[38:32] be low tonight because the next time I
[38:34] preach I'm gonna preach on this again
[38:35] but my point is this I think a lot of
[38:39] times people think because I'm bribed
[38:41] make that makes me wife it doesn't the
[38:46] Bible said that five were wise and five
[38:49] were foolish the Bible also says in the
[38:53] key in in the days of King a surah he
[38:55] meant there were many virgins that came
[39:00] how could I say to become part of the
[39:05] contest but you got to realize a man
[39:09] that really would call before you're
[39:14] chosen
[39:15] and we realized by God's grace he meant
[39:19] that many of those concubines not they
[39:22] weren't concubines at the beginning they
[39:24] were virgins but after the purification
[39:27] they had to meet up with the key now if
[39:31] the key wanted to make it intimate
[39:34] he made it intimate if he if she came
[39:37] unto him and she didn't even like her it
[39:39] at all it's still she was his wife or
[39:43] she was his bride and from that point on
[39:47] he could say well I don't even like you
[39:50] you're my concubine from now on you
[39:54] understand what I'm saying you see
[39:56] because you could not approach the king
[39:58] with any kind of character I think
[40:02] sometimes people think you can approach
[40:05] God by the outward appearance and the
[40:07] way you look you think you are beautiful
[40:09] but that's not the way God looks God
[40:12] looks beyond the outward appearance and
[40:15] he sees the heart that's why when Jesus
[40:17] came he said unto the Pharisees I
[40:20] wouldn't leave you look good but
[40:23] inwardly you're dead men bone hallelujah
[40:27] is that our high so we find out that you
[40:31] say what do you mean brother Brooks here
[40:32] was a prostitute
[40:33] who
[40:34] the candle in the night among law the
[40:37] Pharisees hey man she walks into Simon's
[40:40] house she felt falls at Jesus feet she
[40:44] began to kiss his feet she began to
[40:46] worship him she began to cry she began
[40:48] to wash his feet hallelujah
[40:50] so much so Jesus responded almost in the
[40:53] same way the king answered or said King
[40:57] answer Horace said unto Esther I give
[40:59] you a third or half of my kingdom
[41:01] whatever you want I give it to you Jesus
[41:03] said what is it that you want of me
[41:05] what would you have of me what was it
[41:07] her character she might have looked like
[41:10] a prostitute on the outside but the
[41:12] inside of her heart was nothing but the
[41:15] seed of God so anyway we know by God's
[41:19] grace that vasty was so drunk she didn't
[41:24] realize she was refusing the king and
[41:27] there was a man called Lemieux Caen and
[41:34] Moluccan amen was one who stood for the
[41:38] truth actually he his very name meant to
[41:45] constitute the truth and we find out
[41:50] that he said to the King King if you
[41:54] don't do something about vasty and her
[41:57] behavior all of the women in the church
[42:01] all the women in the kingdom it's going
[42:05] to behave themselves just like she y'all
[42:07] known him saying because remember miss
[42:12] Kennedy who was the first lady of our
[42:14] country during the time of of Kennedy's
[42:18] reign and what does she do she brought
[42:22] in the bobbed hair she brought in the
[42:25] tight dresses she brought in the pants
[42:27] she brought in everything and the whole
[42:30] world
[42:31] without their after her style so much so
[42:35] that the prophet of God called her
[42:37] Jezebel and he called Kennedy a half so
[42:45] it is influences bring
[42:47] to you but it's up to you to accept or
[42:51] not now we realize Amen that that's what
[42:54] master did and the mucus says no sir we
[43:00] cannot allow this to happen I'll tell
[43:03] you what you ought to do sir King I
[43:06] think in order to make an example out of
[43:09] her you need to put her away hallelujah
[43:14] don't have nothing to do her she's no
[43:16] longer queen and there are many virgins
[43:20] out there see that's what God did when
[43:23] the Church of Laodicea when God called
[43:27] upon earth come come whosoever will let
[43:32] him come come out of her my people come
[43:35] on
[43:36] hallelujah what does she do she says
[43:39] we're not coming I'm not coming we have
[43:44] a revival over here without you what did
[43:46] they do
[43:47] revelation the third chapter they said
[43:49] Jesus Christ is outside of his own
[43:51] church knocking trying to get in and we
[43:55] know about God's grace who was the
[43:57] pinnacle who was the church in that day
[43:59] it was the Pentecostal church
[44:02] it was a hapless taluk church that God
[44:04] liken as vasty because she failed to
[44:09] come at the king's call what was it she
[44:13] had a shouting she had her dancing watch
[44:16] read it read it there's so much amen in
[44:19] the book of Esther I don't have time to
[44:21] break it all down but they had the loud
[44:23] noise they had their applause they had
[44:26] their worship they had their praise they
[44:28] were pretty good they did not need a
[44:30] prophets voice and they didn't know that
[44:33] the prophets voice was God and so they
[44:38] refused it and God says you refuse me I
[44:44] reject you that's just the truth and
[44:48] still to this day they don't know they
[44:52] won't make heaven dear to this day they
[44:55] think they are in the presence of the
[44:56] god of the Lord and don't realize that
[44:59] God is not there is that description
[45:01] the Bob said there that he was outside
[45:03] not in then let me ask you the question
[45:06] then who's on the inside who is that
[45:10] impersonator
[45:11] on the inside he can get him to shout
[45:14] he'd given the dance he'd give him to
[45:16] run up and down the aisle but one thing
[45:18] that he cannot get them to do and that's
[45:20] produced if I love so what happens
[45:27] there's a esta whoo I love the scripture
[45:33] when the Bible says let us be glad and
[45:35] rejoice and give honour to him for the
[45:38] marriage of the lamb has come and his
[45:40] wife hath made herself ready y'all know
[45:44] I made yourself ready means that means
[45:46] that God didn't have to pull you through
[45:48] a hole he don't push you and he don't
[45:50] pull you through a pipe you've got to do
[45:53] something because at all Lord deliver me
[45:57] from cigarettes you've got to do
[45:59] something hallelujah Oh God deliver me
[46:03] from from drinking you've got to be
[46:05] delivered you must do something
[46:07] you must come to a place where you
[46:10] decide that you're going to be
[46:12] sanctified and all that is is giving up
[46:18] your own will and accepting his I told
[46:23] you it's all about receiving the word
[46:25] not just hearing it receiving the word
[46:27] that's how people get they healing by
[46:30] receiving the word not hearing the word
[46:32] receiving the word that's for me that's
[46:36] for me right oh come on somebody see
[46:40] Esther was to become bride so she didn't
[46:45] want none of the adorning of the world
[46:48] she wanted to go into the king just like
[46:52] she was who I love that yesterday more
[46:56] all the fine stuff she didn't have
[46:58] jewelry hanging everywhere she didn't
[47:00] have all I hear all messed up in all
[47:02] kinds of stuff she came in simple you
[47:07] know I love that because you know I love
[47:09] playing face with women cause at least
[47:11] you know what you get
[47:15] but when they got all that makeup on you
[47:17] don't know what you're good
[47:18] hey let me tell you something if they
[47:19] put on the false face they could put on
[47:21] false eyelashes and false lips and false
[47:26] everything right and by the time she
[47:29] finished taking everything off at night
[47:30] you don't know hallelujah let me move on
[47:35] Lord forgive me Father so you realize
[47:38] amen the Bible tells us the word tells
[47:40] us you want to go in key she wanted to
[47:43] go in just like she was she adorned
[47:46] herself like the Pentecostal women would
[47:49] work women up to and with the meek
[47:53] humble spirit and when all these fancies
[47:57] first lady comes by with all their new
[48:00] fandangled things the King looked at
[48:03] them and put them in the chamber with
[48:06] the concubines huh so God don't need all
[48:09] that remember the story of the ranchers
[48:12] daughter rent his son and he found his
[48:15] wife in the backdoor like backyard
[48:17] throwing out this washing Laura what he
[48:21] wants simplicity listen I love this the
[48:26] Bible says those Solomon was arrayed in
[48:29] beauty his beauty cannot be compared to
[48:32] the lily why because the Lily wasn't the
[48:38] Punto the lily is the lily what the lily
[48:42] was displaying what was inside
[48:46] but all this solomon arrayed with all
[48:53] his new suits and new robes in all that
[48:57] no matter what kind of peacock travelers
[49:00] he must have had it still wasn't real he
[49:06] understand me it wasn't real God wants
[49:10] real character he don't want put on he
[49:13] won't real character the kind that comes
[49:17] from the inside out
[49:18] right Oh anybody can dress holy the
[49:23] pharisees dress holy but inwardly they
[49:25] were dead men's bones
[49:27] the same Pharisees that looked holy are
[49:30] the same Pharisees that put Jesus Christ
[49:32] to death hello am I making sense a
[49:37] candle in the night when instr come into
[49:42] his sight he got a glimpse of that sweet
[49:46] humble meek spirit he said that's her
[49:50] now a lot of time we think this only
[49:52] applies to women but it applies to the
[49:55] bride of Jesus Christ would include
[49:57] which includes man and woman even men
[50:00] supposed to have a meek and quiet spirit
[50:04] hallelujah is that right it's the truth
[50:08] when you see loud women all the time
[50:11] that the Bible said that spirit is a
[50:14] spirit of stubbornness read your Bible
[50:17] that's what it says and you know it's
[50:21] difficult in this day and time to find a
[50:24] meek and quiet and humble spirit
[50:29] hallelujah everybody wants to be
[50:31] something and he got a glimpse of that
[50:34] sweet humble meek spirit he says that's
[50:38] her go get the crown and put it on her
[50:41] head she let them adorn themselves with
[50:45] all with that kind of a spirit not only
[50:48] the women but the men to adorn
[50:52] themselves with that kind of a spirit
[50:54] there you become ready for the bride
[50:58] sweet reverence amen Esther made her
[51:02] heart clean why are you reading this and
[51:05] I must say where it come from if you
[51:07] want to really know where your your what
[51:09] God is expecting of you listen to the
[51:12] message a message of the let the
[51:14] marriage of the Lamb 60 to 121 a meek
[51:19] and quiet spirit how did we how are we
[51:24] going to overrun how are we going to win
[51:27] in this competition if we want to put it
[51:29] as a competition how are we going to be
[51:32] identified different from all of the
[51:35] others character it's got to be your
[51:40] character
[51:41] it's not how faith will you come to
[51:43] church is not how faithful you pay your
[51:45] tithe is not how well you could sing or
[51:48] preach it's character one of the things
[51:52] that I love about Esther is that she
[51:54] purged her heart she allowed God to take
[51:59] the word and wash it wash it wash it the
[52:04] more he washed it the more sanctified
[52:07] she became the more meat she became huh
[52:10] y'all know it's true we have all changed
[52:13] since we've come to Christ but we're not
[52:16] where we should be and the thing that
[52:19] we're bringing us to perfection is when
[52:21] we receive the word that says God I
[52:24] don't know how to produce it but let the
[52:26] seed where the seed of God germinated me
[52:29] and bring a perfection the kind that you
[52:33] expect out of me under whatever cost
[52:37] Lord see we don't come here just to talk
[52:40] about the message we don't even come
[52:42] together to discuss it we we come
[52:48] together to get in the message and the
[52:50] message is Christ right he is the word
[52:53] that's right we're to get into it get
[52:57] beneath it yes sir
[52:59] in other words it's supposed to
[53:01] overwhelm us take control of us from the
[53:04] top of our head to the sole of our feet
[53:06] Christ in us now you say well why are
[53:10] you screaming this out I'm tired of
[53:13] religion religion will get us nowhere if
[53:18] we don't focus and say the Lord build
[53:23] yourself in me from virtue faith virtue
[53:28] all the way up I need to see the full
[53:31] statue is that right that is the product
[53:34] of being born again if you say I'm born
[53:37] again and those that those know that
[53:39] that character in time doesn't show up
[53:41] in your life something's wrong with your
[53:43] birth yet it's the way you and I can say
[53:47] I've been Christian for 35 years and you
[53:49] can't see the change something's wrong
[53:55] is that right when I see the token I
[53:57] pass over you and that token is the life
[54:00] of Christ in you you cannot even feel
[54:04] this save how can you feel like a saint
[54:07] Christian and you know the blood has not
[54:09] been applied you know the life of Christ
[54:11] is not living in you you're still
[54:13] getting furious you still are lusting
[54:15] after things you're still running after
[54:17] things you're still not doing what you
[54:19] should be come on
[54:21] only God can list all the things that we
[54:24] do yet we claim we have the Holy Ghost
[54:29] we need to check that experience because
[54:35] when the true holy goes comes and don't
[54:37] get me wrong when a man is begotten of
[54:39] God when he first get we call it the new
[54:42] birth that's when you say I confess the
[54:44] Lord Jesus Christ with my mouth I
[54:46] believe in my heart that he is my saving
[54:48] Lord be my saved he comes in right now
[54:50] at that point in time you've turned from
[54:53] death unto life that's just the
[54:55] beginning
[54:56] that ain't the end yeah you know a baby
[55:00] needs help and you become a babe in
[55:03] Christ hallelujah
[55:05] you know you got to learn first how to
[55:07] hold your bottle right it's the preacher
[55:11] who preaches and gives you and feed you
[55:13] food and everything
[55:14] amen but you gotta learn how to holler
[55:16] your bottle after that you gotta learn
[55:18] how to hold your fork in your spoon you
[55:20] got to learn how to feed yourself and
[55:22] then you know what is a process you grow
[55:25] up for so many times people to come
[55:28] babies and and you know just getting
[55:30] born you feel like you got a ministry
[55:32] how can that be
[55:35] you know God ain't never sent to be
[55:39] never we get ahead of God doesn't mean
[55:43] you don't have nothing but we get ahead
[55:45] of God prove it to me anywhere God sent
[55:51] to me you'll find that the before even
[55:55] God came the disciples had been with
[55:57] Jesus three-and-a-half years and still
[55:59] didn't happen it when I say that he said
[56:03] Peter strengthen your brother after you
[56:05] received the Holy Ghost they didn't even
[56:07] have it
[56:08] they were able to cast out Devils and do
[56:10] all kinds of stuff Judas was there too
[56:14] but you don't want to go down the road
[56:16] and then find yourself shipwreck that's
[56:22] what's going to happen when we say oh my
[56:27] god Shakespeare lives in me huh prove it
[56:32] to me if Christ is in you he's gonna do
[56:36] the very works not only that not only
[56:39] just signs and wonders he's gonna live
[56:41] he's gonna have the maturity of Christ
[56:43] in you hallelujah
[56:46] is that right oh I told the people one
[56:48] time before even here sometimes if I'm
[56:53] preaching like that people they oh he's
[56:56] anointed Jesus stood there and read the
[56:59] scripture fully anointed this day this
[57:05] scripture is fulfilled in your ears and
[57:11] our time when people stand still people
[57:13] don't feel like they in there nor take
[57:14] that's because they're not in the
[57:16] anointing the anointing is not with them
[57:19] so therefore they cannot pick it up that
[57:21] God is speaking through the man who's
[57:23] not even moving your understanding but I
[57:26] can put some Hollywood on you and they
[57:31] realize oh boy did he preach I just gave
[57:35] you a little show that's AHA preaching
[57:38] it's not the way you move your body or
[57:40] the way you you know I'll tick you late
[57:43] your voice preaching is taking the word
[57:46] from the pages bringing it to the
[57:49] audience so that God can quicken it and
[57:52] give them a revelation but we've been
[57:55] deceived by Hollywood too y'all hear
[57:59] what I'm saying that's what it is we
[58:01] can't hardly take it when when it with a
[58:03] man but you see it's it's the it's the
[58:05] anointing that flows with the word
[58:08] that's being spoken how many of that
[58:11] you've heard me say with Jesus it
[58:13] blesses the man blessed is the pure in
[58:15] heart for they see L see God and when he
[58:17] preached that mighty sermon on the seed
[58:19] you would have left out of there all
[58:21] confused
[58:22] no well he pre what in the world I'm a
[58:25] farmer I'd have never on this and then
[58:28] Jesus had to take such a simple message
[58:30] and break it down to his disciple to
[58:32] show them how deep it really was he
[58:35] preached the whole Bible and I see I
[58:37] love that but nevertheless let's go on
[58:43] see but if I'm dared to myself if I got
[58:48] Shakespearean me then Shakespeare is
[58:50] gonna do all of the poetry and
[58:52] everything else he normally do it's no
[58:54] longer me I may have the body of Isaiah
[58:57] Brooks but Shakespeare is too like this
[58:59] in me I will behave like a shameful act
[59:02] like Shakespeare react like Shakespeare
[59:05] everything I do will be Shakespeare
[59:10] there i john dealer amen was a Dillinger
[59:14] was a guardsman hallelujah him if I said
[59:17] I got John building me that means I can
[59:20] roll it back and prove if I can't do
[59:24] that I'm a liar y'all hear me most of
[59:28] Christians are false most of the
[59:33] Christians are imitations because until
[59:38] you and I come to a place where we can
[59:40] see Christ in US and the world can see
[59:45] the light of God in us because the light
[59:48] that's given to you is the light that
[59:51] God gives you to shine in the world in
[59:54] the darkness in the night and if the
[59:59] life of Christ lives in that person they
[1:00:02] become identified with him it's Christ
[1:00:04] in you not a church member not a system
[1:00:07] not a resurrected power it's the Holy
[1:00:10] Ghost is a token upon you that your life
[1:00:14] says amen
[1:00:16] to every scripture is that right you
[1:00:20] know even a preacher can't just like get
[1:00:24] saved and become a preacher overnight
[1:00:26] that's not right he's got to go through
[1:00:29] a process in that right he's got to go
[1:00:33] through first of all cleansing
[1:00:35] he's got to go through a process of
[1:00:37] cleansing y'all understand me like like
[1:00:41] like when it comes to to to Esther she
[1:00:44] had to go through cleansing purification
[1:00:47] hallelujah
[1:00:49] she's got to go through that amen the
[1:00:52] Bible that the bride of Jesus Christ is
[1:00:54] not a dirty bride she'll not be a filthy
[1:00:57] woman she's got to be clean
[1:01:00] Oh Lord people don't say old that's
[1:01:07] right like I said you know what happened
[1:01:12] to passed out she got put away listen
[1:01:17] and why did she do it because ma'am you
[1:01:19] can said unto the King I want you to put
[1:01:21] forth a letter to the king and I want
[1:01:23] you to tell him to the Providence's and
[1:01:25] everybody put it in writing from a king
[1:01:27] to every language that every man should
[1:01:29] bear rule in his own house and that it
[1:01:32] should be published according to the
[1:01:34] language of every people if not you're
[1:01:37] gonna have trouble now let me say it
[1:01:38] like this because we have had these 65
[1:01:41] preachers and because we have had these
[1:01:43] preachers who woke money and fame and
[1:01:45] whatever amen look at the church now
[1:01:48] they let everything go they let women
[1:01:52] wear these tight things short things
[1:01:54] every kind of stuff men do the same
[1:01:56] thing they come in naked and don't you
[1:01:59] know that for a woman to show her needs
[1:02:01] its nakedness in the eyes of God
[1:02:03] nakedness man to you know to take your
[1:02:08] shirt off in public its nakedness when
[1:02:10] Jesus came and found Peter after the
[1:02:12] resurrection he was on the scene naked
[1:02:15] that means he had it no shirt on same
[1:02:21] way today but we've got the Holy Ghost
[1:02:25] let me hurry up
[1:02:28] don't you know that potentially all
[1:02:31] those women were bribed all those
[1:02:38] virgins all of
[1:02:41] and the thing that gets me is because
[1:02:44] there's also a law and they'd ever did
[1:02:47] see it they didn't understand it what
[1:02:50] the King was looking for but the King
[1:02:53] said unto all the versions before you
[1:02:55] come I want your number take you into
[1:02:56] this Treasury room you can pick out
[1:02:59] anything you want everything in here is
[1:03:01] yours take whatever you want and you
[1:03:04] don't even have to bring it back it's
[1:03:06] yours
[1:03:07] all right you know you have people Amen
[1:03:10] almost wish they had a car to pull it
[1:03:12] with but they put all this jury on and
[1:03:15] all US on and everything else and they
[1:03:16] could barely walk in and the king so
[1:03:18] that's it out see because what they were
[1:03:23] interested in was possession they just
[1:03:25] want that's how it is with a lot of
[1:03:27] virgins a lot of people in God they just
[1:03:29] want to see what God can bless them with
[1:03:31] is that right that that's what that's
[1:03:34] what the but they call it the uh those
[1:03:36] those ministries now those prosperity
[1:03:38] ministries that's all they are those
[1:03:40] same kind of women in spiritual form and
[1:03:42] then looking to see what all God can
[1:03:44] bless them with and those were not the
[1:03:47] kind of women God wants
[1:03:48] God wants simple women he just want
[1:03:51] people to be content with what he made
[1:03:53] them as y'all hear what I'm saying amen
[1:03:57] and here they said to answer you can do
[1:03:59] whatever you want you can wear whatever
[1:04:00] you want yes I said no I don't none of
[1:04:02] that I don't want nothing of the world I
[1:04:05] don't care about all these tencel's
[1:04:07] utensils and fandango's and all that
[1:04:09] kind of stuff I don't need to wear this
[1:04:11] and wear that I'm not here to impress
[1:04:13] the King with my outward appearance I
[1:04:15] want him to see me
[1:04:16] I want the King to see me I want him to
[1:04:19] see my character hallelujah and so she
[1:04:23] says no I don't want any of that
[1:04:24] I want to walk in the King up to the
[1:04:26] King just as I I love this I love this I
[1:04:32] love this because at the end of the day
[1:04:33] only your character will be brought
[1:04:35] before the King nothing you have here
[1:04:38] would be able to do be able to take with
[1:04:40] it don't make no difference if you a
[1:04:41] millionaire you leaving all of that but
[1:04:45] one thing Esther said I wanted that she
[1:04:47] did she purged herself she cleansed her
[1:04:49] heart because she saw really
[1:04:56] you'll say how do I get there let me
[1:04:58] hear you let me read something brother
[1:05:01] madam says he's now I think each one of
[1:05:04] you a few moments ago when you were
[1:05:07] singing for you I am praying that's what
[1:05:12] I want you to do it's prayer that I
[1:05:15] depend on here's the punch here's the
[1:05:18] real thing the secret of all the
[1:05:21] mysteries of God that's the key that
[1:05:25] opens the door to everything of God is
[1:05:28] prayer if you pray and believe when you
[1:05:33] pray then believe that you receive what
[1:05:37] you asked for and God will make it known
[1:05:41] it's prayer it's a very thing that we
[1:05:45] lack and that's the thing that will get
[1:05:48] us to the place we need to be you talk
[1:05:52] about Seymour down there in and in over
[1:05:57] here California you know what make
[1:06:00] Seymour Seymour Seymour knew knew how to
[1:06:04] pray they said that Seymour would pray
[1:06:08] so that he would actually take a box of
[1:06:11] something and cover his head with it
[1:06:12] even when even preaching cuz he wanted
[1:06:15] the people to see God and not him now
[1:06:18] that's amazing that that is really
[1:06:22] amazing hallelujah
[1:06:24] remember this and never forget it the
[1:06:27] right mental attitude toward any promise
[1:06:31] of God will bring it to pass the right
[1:06:34] mental attitude toward any promise of
[1:06:37] God God don't hold us nothing the moment
[1:06:41] you think God owes you anything he'll
[1:06:44] leave you alone for a long period of
[1:06:47] time do you come to your senses and
[1:06:49] understand that the only reason why God
[1:06:51] comes to us is by it because of the
[1:06:53] blood of Jesus Christ and that because
[1:06:55] of God's grace he doesn't take gifts of
[1:06:59] healing to heal sick people or any
[1:07:02] person in here in it has a right to to
[1:07:04] meet Satan anywhere right well all he's
[1:07:07] got
[1:07:08] if it just anybody if you want to
[1:07:10] believe it and receive it you can have
[1:07:14] it if you're Christian and defeat him on
[1:07:17] any ground that he could stand on is
[1:07:21] that all right let me let me hurry up in
[1:07:25] to Indus for the moment because I want
[1:07:28] you to understand that you don't get
[1:07:32] here you don't come to divine love
[1:07:34] without a cleansing process and I mean a
[1:07:37] daily cleansing we have to clean up
[1:07:40] every day right we have to clean up
[1:07:44] every day that's what foot washing is
[1:07:46] all about in communion that we're able
[1:07:48] to wash each other feet and forgive one
[1:07:50] another right amen now we know by God's
[1:07:55] grace in order for us to make it we've
[1:07:58] got to cleanse ourselves prayer is the
[1:08:03] cleansing agent or brings that word into
[1:08:07] our lives to bring us into a character
[1:08:10] that we see and the thing is guess what
[1:08:12] you got to give it up everything give up
[1:08:16] everything give it up
[1:08:18] everything everything everything God
[1:08:21] must become your number one he has to be
[1:08:25] your number one he's got to be be far
[1:08:27] beyond father mother sister brother
[1:08:28] husband life that you must know that God
[1:08:32] is your number one he has to be now
[1:08:35] I just kind of threw a lot of things out
[1:08:37] at you tonight but by God's grace I'll
[1:08:39] take my time the next time we come to
[1:08:41] Minister this coming Sunday I go to New
[1:08:43] York I won't be here by God's grace but
[1:08:46] when I do come back God's willing
[1:08:48] nothing should happen to me I really
[1:08:50] want to take my time and go through this
[1:08:52] because it kind of ties us in also into
[1:08:56] Revelation because the bride made
[1:08:58] herself ready y'all know what I'm saying
[1:09:01] in other words she didn't have nobody in
[1:09:03] her room dressing her she had to dress
[1:09:06] herself she made herself ready that's
[1:09:10] something we've got to do and I think a
[1:09:12] lot of time that's what Paul says it
[1:09:14] will this this covenant is not sealed
[1:09:16] until you sealed that's what he said you
[1:09:21] understand all mysteries and have not
[1:09:24] charity the Covenant is not sealed until
[1:09:28] you sealed that's when God put his
[1:09:31] approval and said ha you made it you
[1:09:35] make it you have made it
[1:09:37] don't break the seal you coming so you
[1:09:41] love the Lord is the work people in that
[1:09:45] way that we must die daily Paul told us
[1:09:47] it's right there in the word we must die
[1:09:50] daily every day fighting this o flesh
[1:09:55] this Oakhurst thing that's attached to
[1:09:58] us but that's not the thing that God is
[1:10:00] trying to perfect he's trying to perfect
[1:10:03] the inside as long as you allow and the
[1:10:07] devil to get you so it's nothing wrong
[1:10:09] with being angry but when you anger you
[1:10:11] ain't angry anger and you sin you how to
[1:10:14] control those you allow Satan to take
[1:10:17] you out of control you're not where you
[1:10:19] should be you love the Lord Lester
[1:10:35] our God was talking about how God saved
[1:10:37] people and would take him out of bar one
[1:10:41] night the next night there in a pulpit
[1:10:43] or taking them out of a bar one night
[1:10:45] and putting them on an instrument in
[1:10:47] reality a man should not even be on the
[1:10:50] instruments unless he's got the Holy
[1:10:51] Ghost right because the Holy Ghost man
[1:10:56] and know how far to go with music a man
[1:10:59] who's not being converted he'll bring in
[1:11:02] jazz and everything else and if you
[1:11:04] don't know it he changed your atmosphere
[1:11:06] cuz God in jazz hello
[1:11:12] you know what just I won't go that jazz
[1:11:15] is not a good word in it and and it
[1:11:17] started in a bad place
[1:11:21] so know by God's grace that in order for
[1:11:25] us to please him everything must be done
[1:11:27] in his spirit you love the Lord let's
[1:11:30] pray father God we come before you lord
