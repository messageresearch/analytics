[10:04] Israel unto me and set before me and the
[10:10] word of the Lord came unto me saying son
[10:13] of man these men have set up their idols
[10:16] in their heart and put the stumbling
[10:19] block of their iniquity before their
[10:21] face
[10:22] should I be inquired of at all by them
[10:26] therefore speak unto them is saying to
[10:29] them thus saith the Lord God every man
[10:32] of the house of Israel that setteth up
[10:35] his idols in his heart and put us the
[10:38] stumbling block of his iniquity before
[10:40] his face and cometh to the Prophet I the
[10:44] Lord will answer him that cometh
[10:47] according to the multitude of his idols
[10:50] [Music]

[10:55] their own heart because they're all

[11:05] of Prayer Heavenly Father we just come
[11:08] into you together Lord in a solemn
[11:12] evening father with a solemn Scripture

[11:17] in the father that you Lord have given
[11:20] us a great and a mighty message in this
[11:21] day but all Lord won't to us father if

[11:27] acquire at your message father with the
[11:30] stumbling block of iniquity before the

[11:41] building father Lord there be guilty of
[11:43] such a thing father that that this would
[11:45] be the night Lord that you would convict
[11:47] them father or above their sins and the
[11:50] stumbling blocks of their new kitty's

[12:22] kept the holy place as a place of
[12:24] communion with you Lord and Lord we just
[12:27] dedicate this this night into your hands
[12:29] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[12:32] pray amen amen you can be seated a man I
[12:38] I have turned to the scripture many
[12:42] times over the last I'd say year or so
[12:48] your Bible with sometimes it's
[12:52] throughout the years it opens to certain
[12:55] places repeatedly you know and you know
[12:57] and you go in the opener Biola and you
[12:59] know a long time my Bible always open to
[13:01] Nahum chapter 1 I never did figure out
[13:03] why my bio would always dopant the name
[13:06] net chapter one but but repeatedly over
[13:09] the years my this scripture has caught
[13:12] my eye over and over and over again and
[13:15] the thing that bothers me the most about
[13:18] I shouldn't say bothers me but that
[13:20] disturbs me not about the scripture
[13:22] about about the implications of the
[13:26] scripture is that here the Prophet was
[13:30] Ezekiel was a prophet of the Most High
[13:34] God a man who is chosen and elected by
[13:38] God to carry the word for his day amen
[13:42] were the the people that were in
[13:45] captivity for their sins the people that
[13:49] had been taken in prison and they were
[13:52] dwelling in the in the promised land
[13:54] where all of God's promises lie there in
[13:57] Jerusalem they were at peace they were
[13:59] they were in comfort and but because of
[14:03] their repeated sin after sin after sin
[14:06] after a
[14:08] God and His Word and his prophets that
[14:11] they finally God had enough and he put
[14:14] them in captivity and when he put them
[14:16] in captivity they were taken in their
[14:18] imprisoned by Babylon and they were
[14:21] taken 500 miles away to go serve the
[14:24] land of Babylon amen for the for the
[14:27] sins that they committed but yet God in
[14:29] His great mercy and his kindness they
[14:33] even though they were living in a
[14:35] Babylonia SH age in a Babylonia City God
[14:38] still had mercy upon them and set them
[14:41] his word through a prophet even though
[14:44] they were in captivity he didn't just
[14:47] cast them off and say that's it you're
[14:49] done but but it is great mercy and his
[14:52] kindness that even in their chains even
[14:55] in their captivity even in the mists of
[14:58] lerner laying down in their sins even in
[15:00] the midst of them serving the foreign
[15:02] gods and serving the foreign government
[15:05] and serving the the money and the and
[15:08] creating value to Babylon instead of
[15:11] creating value in God's own kingdom and
[15:13] instead of instead of the instead of the
[15:16] children of Israel and the children of
[15:18] the Great God Jehovah being in God's
[15:20] promised land and creating value there
[15:22] now they are in the king of Babylon and
[15:25] creating value for the devil and all of
[15:28] his foolishness and yet in spite of all
[15:31] that God in His great mercy and his
[15:34] great kindness and it gave them a profit
[15:37] in which the Word of God could be placed
[15:40] in and so that in the midst of their
[15:42] chains in the midst of all their
[15:44] wickedness in the midst of all their
[15:46] other just ranked to file me are these
[15:49] they were defiled think about it they
[15:52] were defiled they there were what left
[15:54] what what was less it could have
[15:56] happened to it they lost all of God's
[15:59] promises they lost all of God's holiness
[16:02] they lost all of their priesthood
[16:04] they lost their sacrifices they lost
[16:06] their Kingdom
[16:07] they lost their throne they lost
[16:10] everything and now they are there
[16:11] serving the devil and yet God still in
[16:16] the midst of it had mercy upon them and
[16:18] gave them a profit upon whom the Word of
[16:20] God could come straight from
[16:22] from God's own mouth to the people in
[16:25] the myths of Babel but in spite of all
[16:29] of that in spite of the great mercy
[16:34] being shown to them in spite of the
[16:37] second chance the third chance the
[16:39] fourth chance the fifth chance the six
[16:41] genes in spite of every chance being
[16:44] given unto them that when God extended
[16:48] his hand down and put his words into the
[16:52] mouth of the Prophet that the elders
[16:54] when they came to oh and then when they
[16:56] came to realize that this man Ezekiel
[17:00] was a prophet of the Most High God and
[17:01] they say we need to go and inquire of
[17:04] this man because he has the voice of God
[17:07] we need to go and talk to this man we
[17:10] need to go listen to this man's words we
[17:13] need to go miss Liz because he is a
[17:14] prophet of the Most High God way to go
[17:16] listen to this man's tapes we need to go
[17:19] to a message church we need to go and
[17:21] listen to listen to what the message of
[17:23] the hour says and in spite of all of
[17:26] that great mercy that God has showed
[17:28] them they came in and they inquired
[17:30] before the Prophet and as soon as they
[17:32] it says their verse Allah then came
[17:33] certain of the elders of Israel and they
[17:37] set down before me as we all are sitting
[17:43] down tonight in what we call a message
[17:46] church before the message of the hour
[17:48] given to us by a prophet in the midst of
[17:51] this Mystery Babylon II they in spite of
[17:57] all that that they came and they sat
[17:58] down to enquire to see if God would say
[18:02] anything to them but when God spoke it
[18:06] was such such a chastisement beyond a
[18:11] chastisement a judgement because when
[18:15] God finally spoke out the thing that he
[18:18] said to them is he says these men these
[18:22] elders of the house of Israel are coming
[18:25] to enquire before my identified
[18:28] mouthpiece of the age they want to hear
[18:32] what I have to say to them
[18:33] be it when they come to me they still
[18:35] have
[18:36] the mystery of iniquity before their
[18:39] face they still have the things that I
[18:43] identified age after age after age is
[18:46] being wrong they still have not the
[18:49] thing that stumbled them back there in
[18:51] Jerusalem is the same thing as stumbling
[18:53] them here and know that my judgment has
[18:56] been made plain and clear they still
[18:58] want to come and enquire
[18:59] to see if I have some new thing to say
[19:02] to them when they would not even obey
[19:04] the old thing the last thing I said to a
[19:06] man if they will not obey the law of
[19:09] Moses why should they inquire at
[19:12] Ezekiel's mouth and the same thing today
[19:16] if we will not obey the words of our
[19:19] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ why should
[19:21] we inquire of the Prophet William
[19:24] Branham Amen if we knew if we will not
[19:28] obey the words of our Lord and Savior
[19:31] Jesus Christ why should we ever play
[19:33] another tape if we will not do if we
[19:38] will not do the the basic things of the
[19:41] gospel then why should we ever acquire
[19:47] of something further the God if we would
[19:53] come to a church such as this and clean
[19:55] and sit here underneath the
[19:56] manifestations of the of the of the
[19:59] message of the hour and and the revealed
[20:01] truths a man of this hour but yet we
[20:05] will not remove the stumbling block of
[20:07] iniquity before our face verse 3 son of
[20:13] man these men have set up their idols in
[20:18] their heart and put the stumbling block
[20:21] of their iniquity before their face
[20:25] should I be inquired of at all by them
[20:30] therefore speak unto them and saying to
[20:33] them thus saith the Lord God every man
[20:37] of the house of Israel that hath set up
[20:40] his idols in his heart and putteth the
[20:44] stumbling block of his initely before
[20:47] his face
[20:50] and cometh to the Prophet I the Lord
[20:53] will answer him that cometh according to
[20:55] the multitude of his idols you know we
[21:02] all would love to have an answer from
[21:04] the Most High God to have God speak to
[21:07] us face-to-face to have an answer to the
[21:11] questions of our life is a beautiful
[21:15] thing well you have a great question in
[21:19] your life and God comes and answers the
[21:21] question it's a beautiful thing when you
[21:24] have things that you just can't seem to
[21:26] get over or this or that and I also in
[21:28] God comes and answers the thing it's a
[21:31] beautiful thing
[21:32] Amen but what if you go to approach unto
[21:35] the Lord for an answer and he comes back
[21:37] to you and says you've known this was
[21:39] wrong year after year after year after
[21:41] year and you've let this sit before your
[21:43] face and now you want to inquire of the
[21:46] message of William Branham and see if
[21:49] that message will have some new
[21:50] revelation for you but you won't even
[21:52] take care of the iniquity that's in
[21:54] front of your face whatever of you I
[22:02] have looked at this scripture over and
[22:05] over again over the months and I have
[22:07] not preached shani as of yet until now
[22:09] and I every time I see it it shakes me
[22:12] it causes me to search my own soul if by
[22:16] any chance there might be something that
[22:18] that I have lord I have I have I looked
[22:21] over have I have I left something undone
[22:23] father am i failing at the simplicity of
[22:26] the gospel Lord am I am I missing some
[22:29] of the ABCs Lorna have I have I done
[22:32] something Laura is there anything in my
[22:34] life Lord that that is such a simple
[22:36] thing something I know that I ought to
[22:38] do that I'm not doing or is there
[22:40] anything in my life Lord Laura I want to
[22:42] come and inquire it the message of the
[22:44] hour Lord I want to be faithful to what
[22:46] the message says but O Lord is there
[22:48] something that I've missed from the very
[22:50] ABCs of the gospel it's
[22:56] something that we think oh you know
[22:58] we're here in Mystery Babylon we want to
[23:00] say that we'll stand up and say we are
[23:02] overcomers in this age we have done all
[23:04] that we can to overcome but but if we
[23:06] miss the simple things in the gospel
[23:08] then then we're no better than those how
[23:11] can we ever come against those elders of
[23:13] the house of Israel we could look at
[23:15] them and give out our judgments and say
[23:17] why couldn't they see why couldn't they
[23:20] obey why couldn't they do this why
[23:22] couldn't they pay their ties why
[23:24] couldn't they serve their serve their
[23:25] King why couldn't they worship Jehovah
[23:27] why couldn't they follow the Ten
[23:29] Commandments why couldn't they do these
[23:31] basic things and went but when they come
[23:33] to acquire the Prophet the Lord points
[23:35] right back and says the answer is right
[23:37] in your face you have the stumbling
[23:39] block of your iniquity as right there
[23:41] the idols that you were worship are in
[23:43] your own home and those idols are right
[23:45] there and you want to come and inquire
[23:47] before the prophet of the Most High God
[23:48] and seek a revelation from me and I says
[23:51] I will not answer you but I'll answer
[23:53] you according to the stumbling block of
[23:56] iniquity that you put before your face
[24:00] amen I know I've preached several times
[24:06] on Ezekiel 40 kaptur 42 43 recently and
[24:10] if you can remember at the risk of
[24:15] repeating myself over and over again
[24:18] when in Ezekiel chapter 40 zekiel there
[24:22] in the land of Babylon and is down by
[24:25] the river Chebar God all sudden picks
[24:28] him up and he sees the God of heaven and
[24:31] God picks him up he transports him all
[24:34] the way five hundred miles over to the
[24:36] land of Jerusalem but when he gets to
[24:39] Jerusalem God sets the prophet Ezekiel
[24:41] up on top of a great and high mountain
[24:43] and he looks over the land he sees this
[24:46] temple that is in perfect condition
[24:50] we're in the temple he knew and his mind
[24:53] had been destroyed and was laying in
[24:54] fire and ruins and he's standing there
[24:58] and he's seen this image of a perfect
[25:00] complete and pure and sanctified and
[25:04] holy temple
[25:08] he's like Lord what is this and the Lord
[25:11] tells them yeah I want you to go and
[25:14] take a tour of this temple I want you to
[25:17] go and measure every room I want you to
[25:20] listen and write down that is I'm
[25:22] getting ready to scribe this temple to
[25:23] you and I want you to write down the
[25:25] full description of this temple and he
[25:28] goes and spends three chapters telling
[25:31] the Lord is telling the prophet Ezekiel
[25:33] there are seven steps here there's a
[25:35] Paul there's a column here and has
[25:37] pomegranates all over it there's an
[25:38] archway over here and there's the holy
[25:41] place here and the walls here and this
[25:44] gate here and this gate me and he goes
[25:46] knee describes the entire temple into a
[25:47] great detail even though that temple was
[25:49] not yet standing on the earth and though
[25:53] after after he spends three chapters
[25:55] describing every single part of the
[25:57] stipple he says son of man I want you to
[26:00] go back and take this description to the
[26:03] to the elders of the house of Israel the
[26:05] ones we just got talking about here I
[26:06] want you to take the description of the
[26:08] house of this temple and take this
[26:10] description to them and make them
[26:12] jealous that their sins and their
[26:17] iniquities have prevented this temple
[26:20] from being built but their sins and
[26:24] their iniquities have prevented from
[26:27] such a temple standing in God's own holy
[26:30] land and so in when Ezekiel goes he
[26:35] takes this this description of the house
[26:37] to the house of Israel he says this was
[26:40] God's desire that he would have a house
[26:43] that is perfect and standing by you for
[26:46] your sins have made it a house be a
[26:48] house of fire and ruins there our animal
[26:51] animals are wandering through the
[26:53] holiest of Holies amen the unclean
[26:56] creatures are stumbling into the holy
[26:58] place and my house is supposed to be a
[27:00] house of prayer has now lay in a house
[27:02] of ruins and make them a shame because
[27:05] they're it's their bone iniquities they
[27:07] have caused that and we know that God
[27:10] has ordained all of us to be lively
[27:12] stones amen and every stone has a has a
[27:17] has a place
[27:21] you know tonight I had no idea what to
[27:23] preach and I don't think I've ever
[27:26] struggled so hard to find a message as I
[27:29] did today I went through all of my notes
[27:32] from here to back to 2009 to find a
[27:36] message to preach I couldn't find one I
[27:39] went through everything I could think of
[27:41] I leaf to the Bible couldn't find
[27:43] anything and finally I got down on my
[27:44] knees and I just opened my Bible and
[27:47] this is what I open to but while I was
[27:51] going through my notes I found a little
[27:52] drawing that had created a long time ago
[27:55] as a drawing of a pyramid that was
[27:58] missing the capstone and how the side of
[28:02] that pyramid here on the side was
[28:04] missing a little chunk of a certain
[28:08] shape and then I drew a little chunk off
[28:11] over here of that same shape and that
[28:15] little chunk had a little message bowl
[28:17] and it was crying out oh cleft in the
[28:19] rock place for me
[28:21] Lord let me hide myself in thee we are
[28:26] all designed to fit inside a certain
[28:29] shape we are designed to be a part of
[28:32] the temple the Most High God amen let's
[28:35] hurry to Ezekiel chapter 43 real quick
[29:00] after the description of the temple God
[29:04] went a step further after spending three
[29:07] chapters describing the physical nature
[29:10] of the building he in verse 1 of 43 he
[29:14] describes another attribute of this
[29:15] building and that attribute was the
[29:17] presence of the Most High God amen as
[29:21] zekiel chapter 43 verse 1 says afterward
[29:26] he brought me to the gate even to the
[29:28] gate to look us toward the east keep
[29:34] your heart facing the right direction
[29:35] sings and behold the glory of the God of
[29:40] Israel came from the way of the east and
[29:43] his voice was like the noise of many
[29:45] waters and the Earth's shined with his
[29:48] glory and he was according to the
[29:51] appearance of the vision which I saw
[29:52] even according to the vision that I saw
[29:55] when I came to destroy the city and the
[29:57] visions were like the vision that I saw
[29:59] by the river Chebar and I fell down upon
[30:02] my face and the glory of the Lord came
[30:05] into the house by the way of the gate
[30:07] was Prospect
[30:08] toward the east so the spirit took me up
[30:13] and brought me into the inner court and
[30:15] behold the glory of the Lord filled the
[30:17] house and I heard him speaking unto me
[30:19] out of the house and the man stood by me
[30:21] and he said to me son of man the place
[30:26] of my throne and the place of the soles
[30:29] of my feet where I will dwell in the
[30:31] midst of the children of Israel forever
[30:33] and my holy name shall the house of
[30:36] Israel no more defile neither they nor
[30:39] their kings by their whoredom nor by the
[30:42] carcasses of their kings and their high
[30:44] places and their setting of their
[30:46] threshold by my thresholds and their
[30:48] posts by my posts the wall between me
[30:50] and them they have even defiled my holy
[30:53] name by their abominations that they
[30:55] have committed wherefore I have consumed
[30:57] them in my anger now let them put away
[30:59] their hoard them and their carcasses of
[31:01] their kings far from me and I will dwell
[31:04] in the midst of them forever
[31:05] now son of man show the house
[31:08] up to the house of Israel that they may
[31:11] be ashamed of their iniquities and let
[31:14] them measure the pattern and if they be
[31:16] ashamed of all that they have done
[31:18] show them the form of the house and the
[31:20] fashion thereof and the goings out
[31:22] thereof and the comings in thereof and
[31:24] all the forms thereof and all the
[31:26] ordinances thereof and all the forms
[31:28] thereof and all the laws thereof and
[31:30] write it in their sight that they may
[31:33] keep the whole form there if and all the
[31:35] ordinances thereof and do them watch
[31:36] this the 12th verse and this is the law
[31:39] of the house upon the top of the
[31:42] mountain the whole limit their
[31:43] roundabout shall be most holy behold
[31:47] this is the law of the house the law of
[31:51] the house is that it shall be most holy
[31:55] amen and there is only one gate that he
[31:57] will come into there is only one gate
[32:00] and that is the gate this prospect is
[32:02] towards East Amen if your heart is
[32:04] facing towards the Lord Amen and you
[32:08] have opened up the gate and the the only
[32:10] way you can open up the gate is when the
[32:12] stumbling block of iniquity is put away
[32:13] from your face and the molten ooh of
[32:15] your idols are put away all your TV

[32:33] look at with our eyes that we hear with
[32:35] our ears and we touch with our senses
[32:36] amen all the wickedness that comes out
[32:39] our mouth when we put on a stumbling
[32:40] block of our iniquity away and we submit
[32:43] ourselves to obeying the Full Gospel the
[32:45] whole Word of God step by step amen
[32:48] and when we do it put our heart and
[32:50] repent of all of our sins and our fate
[32:52] on our heart is finally facing towards
[32:54] the east then because the law of the
[32:57] house is is in my house will be holy
[32:59] amen and if the house refuses to be holy
[33:02] then you will not be a part of his house
[33:10] is that clear
[33:29] they said my house will never be defiled
[33:34] 570 fears before Christ he said my house
[33:38] will never be defiled again that's a
[33:41] promise my house will not be defiled
[33:46] again amen his house will be sealed
[33:49] until the day of its Redemption amen
[33:53] there there will be a ceiling of the
[33:54] house and it cannot be defile amen and
[33:58] and Andy in the as we if you remember
[34:01] when we were preached the message called
[34:02] anointed kings and priests that the the
[34:05] priest was over the house it was over
[34:07] the temple they had to many of the
[34:09] temple but the king was to extend the
[34:11] dominion of of that that holy place to
[34:16] the furthermost boundaries of israel
[34:17] from north to south east to west amen
[34:21] and he had said in the Book of
[34:23] Revelations that he has made us kings
[34:24] and priests unto our God amen amen we
[34:28] are to - we are to repent of our sins
[34:32] step 1
[34:34] repent of all the foolishness repent of
[34:37] all our sins step 1 step to be baptized
[34:40] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[34:42] amen when you are baptized you are
[34:44] testifying I hear on the earth that I am
[34:47] done with the things of Babylon I am
[34:49] done with the things of the world I am
[34:51] dead to the things of the world so I can
[34:54] be alive under the things of the Lord
[34:55] Jesus Christ amen that is what we
[34:57] testify when we're going down into
[35:00] baptism that step - amen and if and if a
[35:03] time in our life we decide that we want
[35:05] to go back and rename it
[35:16] is and I will give you the gift of the
[35:18] Holy Ghost and I will seal you until the
[35:21] day of your destination step 4 we will
[35:23] submit ourselves unto the leadership of
[35:26] the Holy Ghost and commit ourselves
[35:28] under prayer and reading the Bible and
[35:30] when we find things that
[35:31] contrary that our grievious Thole ghosts
[35:34] that we will repent of them and if
[35:36] somehow by some by some stubbornness of
[35:39] our own nature that we allow our our
[35:41] conscious to be seared as with a hot
[35:43] iron and if we allow and we can no
[35:46] longer then we no longer feel guilty for
[35:49] our sins that we have allowed things in
[35:52] our lives to run contrary to the
[35:54] scriptures for so long and that our
[35:56] conscious has now been seared the hot
[35:58] iron and we have now agreed the way the
[36:00] Holy Ghost so they cannot impact us
[36:02] anymore he can't lead us anymore that
[36:05] somehow the God is some guy I'm gonna
[36:07] have to break through all of that and
[36:09] shake you back down to you off your high
[36:11] horse and knock you back down to the
[36:13] ground until somehow someway maybe
[36:16] perchance you might be able to hear his
[36:18] voice again otherwise you're just being
[36:24] stubborn this which the Bible says
[36:26] that's the same as witchcraft people
[36:30] sitting in the pews and the chairs of
[36:32] the church and guilty of witchcraft
[36:34] because of their stubbornness against
[36:36] the gospel their stubbornness against
[36:39] the revealed word for this hour and
[36:41] they'll come and enquire before the
[36:43] Prophet and listen to the tapes and
[36:47] listening to the anointed ministers that
[36:49] bring the quotes from the tapes and
[36:51] inquire of the Prophet but yet the
[36:53] stumbling block of their iniquity as
[36:55] before their face because they will not
[36:58] obey that the basic tenants of the
[37:00] gospel the law of the house is it will
[37:07] be holy that is the law of the house and
[37:11] Christ is coming back or a holy house
[37:14] and a holy temple amen let's turn over
[37:20] to Psalms 91
[37:44] we'll read Psalms 90 the first two
[37:47] chapters or first two verses then we'll
[37:50] read Psalms 91 the first two verses
[38:01] there's some prayer Moses here Lord thou
[38:06] has been our dwelling place in all
[38:08] generations before the mountains were
[38:11] brought forth wherever thou has formed
[38:14] the earth from the and the world for
[38:16] even from everlasting to everlasting
[38:17] thou art God Psalms 91 verse 1 he that
[38:24] dwelleth in the secret place of the Most
[38:27] High shall abide under the shadow of the
[38:29] Almighty
[38:30] I'll say of the Lord he is my refuge and
[38:33] my fortress my god in him will I trust
[38:38] amen you know God has always had at all
[38:44] times in all places God has always had a
[38:48] holy place he's never failed to have a
[38:52] place the Hagenbach all his holy place
[38:56] this and the holy place is a place where
[39:01] God has his throne
[39:02] it's a place where he is revered above
[39:05] all of all other gods is he has the
[39:09] preeminence in that place it is a place
[39:11] that is holy it is clean there is no no
[39:15] mess there there is no dust there is no
[39:17] no no other all idols there is no other
[39:20] worship to any other gods it is a holy
[39:23] place where God is worshipped amen and
[39:26] in that holy place God's Word has the
[39:29] preeminence over all other words and
[39:31] against over all over all other thoughts
[39:34] amen and before the foundation of the
[39:37] world when when when God was worshiped
[39:41] up in heaven by the Angels and and and
[39:43] Satan Lucifer the cherub that covereth
[39:47] as the Bible says when he this when he
[39:50] began to bring his word and exalt it up
[39:54] over the word of God and when
[39:56] start drawing angels after himself then
[39:59] there was no more room in heaven for for
[40:02] Satan and Satan bound a third of the
[40:06] Angels to himself who all who exalted
[40:08] the word of Lucifer over the Word of God
[40:12] and because of that there was no more
[40:14] room in God's holy place for for Satan
[40:17] and his angels amen
[40:19] so they were cast down to the earth as
[40:21] Jesus said I behold Satan fall from
[40:23] heaven like lightning and and why how
[40:25] did he behold me because because of the
[40:28] exaltation of over Satan's word over
[40:31] God's own word in God's own holy place
[40:33] which cannot stand amen
[40:36] and so when Satan found himself cast
[40:38] down into the end of the earth as the
[40:41] earth was being formed by God and he
[40:43] washed as God began to bring up the
[40:45] trees and and bring up the fish and he
[40:48] and he created the firmament and he
[40:50] created the sky in the waters and and
[40:52] the plants and all those things and and
[40:55] everything was good was good was good
[40:57] and when when God say I'm gonna create
[40:59] me any garden called Eden and he went
[41:02] and he took all the best things of all
[41:04] the Earth's why so that his people will
[41:06] have a holy place that they could dwell
[41:07] in amen and when he and when God had
[41:10] finished the Eden he placed his son and
[41:13] his daughter there in Eden so that they
[41:16] could dwell in the holy place of God
[41:18] where God's Word would reign supreme
[41:20] amen and what did Satan do being cast
[41:23] out into the earth roaming the earth
[41:25] looking for a place to dwell looking for
[41:27] a place he could call home looking for a
[41:29] place of comfort amen he could not find
[41:32] a place so he sneaks into God's own
[41:34] garden and he and he and he goes and he
[41:37] goes and he starts talking to Eve he
[41:39] once more starts exalting his word over
[41:43] the Word of God and not only that but he
[41:47] got Eve to do the same thing and so what
[41:51] happened now all of a sudden there is no
[41:52] more room in God's holy place for Satan
[41:55] but also now for her God's own son and
[41:58] daughter and so they had to leave Eden
[42:01] to gods because God's holy place once
[42:05] more God's own word was being detracted
[42:08] from and not given the free minutes and
[42:10] God
[42:10] holy place and so when when God started
[42:17] drawing the children of Israel out of
[42:19] Egypt he wanted to restore a holy place
[42:22] unto the children of men Amen so he
[42:24] created a so he got he God took his own
[42:28] work he inscribed it on two tablets of
[42:30] stone with his own finger he said thou
[42:32] shalt not do this
[42:33] thou shalt not do that that I should not
[42:35] do this I wrote out the Ten Commandments
[42:37] in stone with his own finger he took
[42:39] those tablets of stone and he had Moses
[42:41] create a box called the Ark of the
[42:44] Covenant amen and they put it over with
[42:47] gold they put the mercy seat on the top
[42:49] they anointed it with the sacrifice amen
[42:52] they put it inside the holiest of Holies
[42:54] to protect it
[42:55] amen and in there the kind of glory of
[42:58] God would watch over it amen
[43:00] and then they put that around the holy
[43:02] paste around that Amen protected some
[43:05] more and there on that to put a
[43:06] courtyard then they gave that dominion
[43:08] over to the priests to keep the to keep
[43:11] the sanctity of the holy place a man so
[43:14] thinking they had the priests over the
[43:16] sacrifice why so that God's Word would
[43:18] have some protection God's own word
[43:21] would be protected and revered and so
[43:23] nothing could detract from from God's
[43:26] Word and now not only that but they took
[43:32] all that and they surrounded that with
[43:34] two million Israelites let me tell you
[43:37] nothing was gonna get to the Word of God
[43:40] no nobody could had to get by the two
[43:43] million is White's they have to get
[43:44] beyond the priesthood get beyond the
[43:46] courtyard beyond the holy place into the
[43:49] holiest of Holies but past the Shekinah
[43:51] fire of the Lord and to get to the Word
[43:53] of God God was protecting his work why
[43:57] because God did not want in his holy
[43:58] place to be defiled again and in God's
[44:02] own holy place God's Word was gonna be
[44:04] protected but the priests time after
[44:10] time again Satan was finding his way
[44:13] into God's own holy place when David was
[44:17] a guy excited about the the the the the
[44:20] prom the Ark of the Covenant coming back
[44:23] to be set up on high
[44:24] upon the mountain he got so excited he
[44:27] wrote that Psalm like God be exalted and
[44:29] all of his enemies will fall down you
[44:31] know when God when God like God arise
[44:33] and all of his enemies be scattered he
[44:35] was talking about the Ark of the
[44:36] Covenant
[44:37] going back up Zions Hill amen but he
[44:40] decided to between the dark the covenant
[44:41] was saying go up Zions Hill that it
[44:43] should go up on a cart which was
[44:44] contrary to the Word of God so now the
[44:47] Word of God was riding on a cart
[44:49] contrary to the very word that was on
[44:51] the inside of the box
[44:57] amen and there's no wonder that when one
[45:00] of the oxen stumbled at the man driving
[45:02] the oxen got scared that the Word of God
[45:04] and had fall to the ground it reached
[45:06] out and he put his hand on the Ark of
[45:08] the Covenant and the man died God smote
[45:10] him dead why because God's Word was in
[45:12] danger of stumbling once again God's
[45:16] Word was put in danger of falling on the
[45:18] ground just like Eve let the Word of God
[45:21] fall on the ground and once more in
[45:24] God's own holy place God's Word was
[45:26] being detracted from amen and now we get
[45:29] to Ezekiel he says they look I want you
[45:32] to show them the pattern this is what
[45:34] their sins have caused why because they
[45:36] would not revere my holy place I
[45:38] destroyed it and I want you to show them
[45:41] the pattern of the house and description
[45:43] of it
[45:43] and I'm going to write it out it's gonna
[45:45] be a long writing he says write it all
[45:47] in their sight and he hits writing and
[45:49] writing and writing in their sight and
[45:51] give out the description and let them
[45:53] know that the law of my house is gonna
[45:55] be holiness the law of my house they
[45:57] will never to file again and let me tell
[46:00] you if you are keeping defilement in
[46:01] your heart then you will find yourself
[46:03] on the outside of the house because God
[46:08] has given his word and the law of the
[46:11] house is it will be holy with you or
[46:14] without you it will be holy with you or
[46:20] without you will be holy
[46:34] you know Christ died on the cross he
[46:37] bore our shame he bore our nakedness he
[46:43] bore our sins he bore all of our
[46:46] sickness all those things he died for
[46:51] and paid he felt pain amen
[46:58] he suffered for 33 years resisting the
[47:02] things that we give in to so easily
[47:05] think about that
[47:07] 33 years in a body of flesh resisting
[47:10] the things that we just so flippantly
[47:12] give into and then died to take away our
[47:21] sins and the Bible says that fools will
[47:25] walk the palm nail shoes where angels
[47:28] fear to try as the angels watch the
[47:31] sacrifice and the beatings that he went
[47:33] through and the reverence that they gave
[47:36] to him as brother branham said that
[47:39] every tree the trees were filled with
[47:41] angels as all of Mount Calvary was
[47:44] filled with millions and billions of
[47:46] angels waiting that if Jesus Christ
[47:50] would say one word save me take me away
[47:55] from this angels come get me off the
[47:59] cross that they were waiting for one
[48:02] command from his lips but yea he bore
[48:04] all the pain all the shame dying naked
[48:07] upon the cross he died naked for our
[48:09] nakedness a man he took beatings for our
[48:12] beatings a man and and then when we
[48:15] flippantly give in to the same things
[48:17] that he resisted we do despite against
[48:21] the grace which with we were purchased
[48:26] amen
[48:28] we ought to protect everything that
[48:30] Christ died for we ought to protect
[48:33] everything that Jesus Christ died for it
[48:37] amen if he died for our nakedness we all
[48:40] stay clothed in the baptism of the holy
[48:41] ghost if he died for our sins then I'll
[48:44] keep righteousness at the forefront a
[48:46] varied everything we do amen if he died
[48:48] that his spirit might come back on us
[48:50] and we all seek the leadership of the
[48:52] Holy Ghost and everything that we do a
[48:53] man if he died for all of our sickness
[48:55] then we are sick we all laying down upon
[48:58] the cross you say Lord deliver me and
[49:00] not have rest until he has came and
[49:03] given the answer in our mortal bodies
[49:07] amen he said in Zechariah I will be a
[49:10] wall of fire around about her amen he
[49:13] told he told the young man go measure
[49:15] Jerusalem what do you see I see a man
[49:19] with a measuring line in his hand he
[49:21] said go and measure Jerusalem he told
[49:23] the angel
[49:24] they wouldn't measure to how deep it was
[49:26] how wide it was how high it was he says
[49:28] I know exactly everybody that will be
[49:30] inside Jerusalem I know exactly
[49:32] everybody will be outside Jerusalem and
[49:33] I will be a wall of fire around about
[49:35] you
[49:36] Amen my brother BAM says is that sin
[49:39] didn't come into you you went out to it
[49:42] amen
[49:43] stay down on the inside amen amen he the
[49:48] dwelleth in the secret place of the Most
[49:50] High God shall abide underneath the
[49:53] shadow of the Almighty amen and how
[49:56] easily we would give that up to have our
[49:58] conscience seared for the sins that we
[50:01] allow and our moral being amen
[50:11] Christ's death was worth more than that
[50:13] st. amen
[50:17] it really was it was worth more than
[50:20] that
[50:20] a man Christ deserves better than what
[50:23] we give him amen
[50:26] he deserves a lot better than what we
[50:29] give them amen
[50:31] every man that seeks a bride deserves to
[50:34] have a bride that would seek his best
[50:36] and we ought to seek Christ best in our
[50:38] lives
[50:38] amen amen by the by the the habits that
[50:43] we form in life amen by the the well
[50:47] beaten path to the place of Prayer by
[50:49] the people that we associate with the
[50:52] people that we have to disassociate with
[50:54] are the things we decide we're not going
[50:57] to watch amen because we want to keep
[50:59] the campground holy amen we want to keep
[51:02] the throne-room we were going to protect
[51:04] the place where God's Word dwells bless
[51:08] the a chance we'd be guilty like E of
[51:10] letting the word of God be in danger of
[51:13] falling upon the ground amen they that
[51:17] come and enquire should I be inquired of
[51:19] by the men that keeps the stumbling
[51:21] block of iniquity before my face I will
[51:24] not be inquiring I when I answer them
[51:26] I'll answer them according to their own
[51:28] iniquities and when God answers you
[51:30] according to your sins and iniquities
[51:31] it's an answer of judgment and not a
[51:34] peace amen
[51:47] [Music]
[51:58] amen because thou has made the Lord
[52:03] which is my refuge and the Most High thy
[52:06] habitation there shall no evil befall
[52:09] thee neither shall any plague come nigh
[52:12] thy dwelling place for he shall give his
[52:14] angels charge over thee to keep thee in
[52:17] all thy ways and they shall bear thee up
[52:19] in their hands lest thou shalt - like
[52:22] foot against a stone
[52:24] thou shalt tread upon the lion in the
[52:26] adder the snake and the young lion and
[52:28] the dragon shall trample under feet
[52:30] because he has set his love upon me
[52:32] therefore will I deliver him I'll set
[52:35] him on high because he hath known my
[52:37] name amen he shall call upon me and I'll
[52:41] answer him I will be with him in trouble
[52:43] and will deliver him and honor him with
[52:45] long life I will satisfy him and show
[52:48] him my salvation amen but how can we
[52:53] seek the promises of the Most High God
[52:54] with a stumbling-block of iniquity
[52:56] before our face
[52:58] Amen we we know the steps of what Christ
[53:02] is looking for in this hour but but how
[53:05] to do them amen amen
[53:11] God says my holy place is called by my
[53:15] name shall be a house of prayer but you
[53:17] have made it a den of thieves amen
[53:21] you know in in the case of when the book
[53:26] of Acts when when the man and his wife
[53:30] they everybody was giving selling all
[53:34] that they had and giving it to the
[53:35] church so they might have all things in
[53:37] common the man his wife they they
[53:39] decided that they sell all that they had
[53:41] and they kept back a part of it for
[53:43] themselves amen and and and and what
[53:47] they did is the new one came and they
[53:49] they lied unto Paul they thought they
[53:52] were lying to Paul and they came and
[53:55] Paul asked him you know is this all that
[53:57] it was from from the
[53:59] sale of your things and and or I mean it
[54:03] wasn't Paul that sorry the disciples
[54:06] there and they said yes the man said yes
[54:11] that is all and and the in Peter said
[54:15] you know you you why did you seek in
[54:19] your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost you
[54:24] have not lied on demand that you've lied
[54:26] and to go and then when his wife came
[54:29] into that he fell down dead and then
[54:31] when his wife came into the house she
[54:33] came in and st. Peter asked her he said
[54:37] is this all you know from the sale your
[54:40] things and she says yes this is all and
[54:43] he says why is it that you have
[54:45] conspired together with your husband to
[54:47] lie into the Holy Ghost you have not
[54:50] lied unto men but you have lied unto God
[54:53] amen when we go bet and bat get go into
[54:56] the waters of baptized and declare that
[54:58] we are going to be separate from the
[54:59] things of the world and alive under the
[55:01] things of Christ and then we day after
[55:04] day will not repent of our sins we are
[55:06] not lying under the men but we lied unto
[55:09] God by bearing false witness of our
[55:10] baptism amen where we said that we would
[55:13] be separate from the things of the world
[55:14] but yet we come into the house and
[55:16] inquire before the Prophet but yet we
[55:19] have the stumbling block of iniquity
[55:20] before our face amen and we wish that
[55:24] God would answer us when our
[55:26] consciousnesses I've been seared as with
[55:28] the hot iron amen
[55:37] let's fear of the Hebrews chapter 6
[56:09] amen verse 4 says 4 is impossible for
[56:16] those who were once enlightened and have
[56:18] tasted of the Holy gift and were made
[56:22] partakers of the Holy Ghost and have
[56:25] tasted the good word of God and the
[56:28] powers of the world to come if they
[56:30] shall fall away to renew them again unto
[56:32] repentance seeing they crucify to
[56:35] themselves the Son of God afresh and put
[56:38] him to an open shame for the earth which
[56:45] drink thin the rain cometh that cometh
[56:47] off upon it and bring his forth herbs
[56:50] meat for them by whom it is dressed
[56:52] receiveth the blessing from God but that
[56:55] which Bharath thorns and briers is
[56:57] rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose
[57:00] end is to be burned but beloved we are
[57:03] persuaded better things of you and
[57:05] things which accompanies salvation
[57:07] though we thus speak for God is not
[57:10] unrighteous to forget your work and your
[57:12] labor of love but you showed toward his
[57:15] name and then you have ministered to the
[57:16] Saints and do minister and we do desire
[57:19] we desire that every one of you do show
[57:22] the same diligence to the full assurance
[57:24] of hope unto the end that you be not
[57:26] slothful but followers of them who
[57:30] through faith and patience inherit the
[57:33] promises amen
[57:38] stern warning Paul says there are people
[57:46] they will fall away after tasting all
[57:49] the good things of God they will fall
[57:51] away and they will take the Holy Ghost
[57:54] and drag it through the mud again and
[57:57] through all the gifts so he gives them
[57:58] gift after gift after gift yet they take
[58:01] that and they will not and they bring
[58:03] Christ to an open shame he says but
[58:06] we're persuaded better things of you and
[58:09] things that company salvation even
[58:11] though we're talking this way for God is
[58:15] not unrighteous to forget your work and
[58:17] labor of love that tells me this is the
[58:19] time for repentance there's still a
[58:22] chance
[58:23] amen there's still a hope a MEF it would
[58:25] be that we would go back and say Lord
[58:28] I'm coming back to my baptism I'm coming
[58:31] back to what I testified of in the
[58:33] waters that would be alive under the
[58:35] things of Christ and dad do things in
[58:38] the world a man otherwise why are we
[58:42] here and otherwise why are we come for
[58:45] me better if we had never heard the
[58:47] gospel then if we come to the gospel and
[58:50] refuse to walk in amen a man let's let's
[58:57] just stand
[59:13] [Music]
[59:21] Ezekiel 14 verse 6 says therefore say
[59:25] into the house of Israel thus saith the
[59:28] Lord God repent and turn yourselves from
[59:32] your idols and turn your faces from all
[59:36] your abominations for everyone in the
[59:39] house of Israel or of the stranger that
[59:41] sojourneth in Israel as the Gentiles
[59:43] which separate himself from me and
[59:46] setteth up his idols in his heart and
[59:48] put the stumbling block of his iniquity
[59:50] before his face and cometh to a prophet
[59:53] not to the prophet but just to a prophet
[59:56] to inquire of him concerning me I the
[59:59] Lord will answer him by myself and I'll
[1:00:02] set my face against that man I'll make
[1:00:05] him a sign in a proverb and I'll cut him
[1:00:08] off from the midst of my people and ye
[1:00:11] shall know that I am the Lord amen let's
[1:00:16] just power hasn't word prayer heavenly
[1:00:19] father I just pray father for myself and

[1:00:25] stern message father the Lord if I be
[1:00:30] guilty if any must be guilty Lord and I
[1:00:32] think we all know where we are guilty
[1:00:34] for your you Lord have not been slow to
[1:00:38] convict us of our sins father or but you
[1:00:42] Lord have been faithful father to remind
[1:00:45] us of the things we have done that a
[1:00:46] contrary to our work I don't think that
[1:00:49] any man can rightfully say that I do not
[1:00:52] know what I have done wrong or that
[1:00:55] cannot look down into his heart and find
[1:00:57] things that are contrary to the gospel
[1:01:00] the Lord I pray father that we would be
[1:01:04] quick
[1:01:05] Laure to repent father that we would not
[1:01:07] give chance father - to our souls being
[1:01:10] seared with a hot iron that our
[1:01:13] conscience would no longer work and
[1:01:15] doing the thing that it is designed to
[1:01:17] do that our conscience is there to lead
[1:01:21] us into repentance by God's direction
[1:01:23] but Lord if we allow damage to come to
[1:01:27] our conscience Oh Lord how can we repent
[1:01:30] and lord I just pray father that you
[1:01:33] would right now restore
[1:01:35] father the conscience 'as of men father
[1:01:37] or that through the tears father of
[1:01:41] those that cannot cry for their sins
[1:01:43] father that they would their tears would
[1:01:46] be restored to them father Florida that
[1:01:48] those are have hardened their heart that
[1:01:51] somehow you had softened their heart
[1:01:53] that once more they could be broken for
[1:01:55] their sins sake Lord there once more
[1:01:58] they could find themselves at an altar
[1:02:00] weeping and crying out for Lord how long
[1:02:04] they have allowed the stumbling block of
[1:02:06] iniquity staying in front of their face
[1:02:09] Wally while they inquired about your
[1:02:11] prophets message Lord
[1:02:13] but O God we ask your father you'd give
[1:02:17] these a chance father awhile mercy and
[1:02:20] grace is upon upon the altar Lord and
[1:02:24] while you were there to make
[1:02:25] intercession for us upon our confession
[1:02:28] father that we would confess to you Lord
[1:02:30] that we have sinned and and done against
[1:02:33] the the grace of the Almighty God and we
[1:02:35] have counted you or we we have done
[1:02:39] despite to the grace of God Lord and I
[1:02:41] pray father than us being this guilty
[1:02:43] father that somehow you would allow us
[1:02:46] to give us the grace to repent or no man
[1:02:49] can repent without your leadership
[1:02:50] father and without your conviction
[1:02:53] father so I just pray for these people
[1:02:54] now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:56] that you would have mercy upon them
[1:02:59] father and grant them this great
[1:03:01] repentance father not Lord we don't want
[1:03:03] a halfway repentance we don't want a
[1:03:05] partial repentance father but we want a
[1:03:08] true godly sorrow Lord repent after a
[1:03:11] godly sorrow Lord that would be a truth
[1:03:14] there would be to be accepted on your
[1:03:17] sight father though we could go on Lord
[1:03:19] of bonds life's journey being joyful not
[1:03:22] in the burdens of our iniquities the
[1:03:24] stumbling blocks father but alive unto
[1:03:26] the Lord Jesus Christ father Lord and

[1:03:31] easily

[1:03:45] sons of God Lord holding the things
