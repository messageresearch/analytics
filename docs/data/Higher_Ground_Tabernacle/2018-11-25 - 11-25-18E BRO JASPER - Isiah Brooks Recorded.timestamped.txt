[25:39] some time out of words when it comes to
[25:42] this this messaging and you know the
[25:45] thing that mostly I'm excited about is
[25:47] the changes I seek are doing in me you
[25:50] know I've seen all kinds of miracles but
[25:52] this is the greatest change the greatest
[25:55] miracle that God has ever done and I'm
[25:58] able to see changes that I had nothing
[26:01] to do with God comes along and changed
[26:05] me in his own time and this is what I
[26:10] love about it we're gonna ask our
[26:12] brother Jasper to come and just minister
[26:15] if you want to sing before then whatever
[26:17] you want to do I want God to have his
[26:19] way a manual we appreciate further
[26:25] Samuel he came in and I told her you
[26:29] could he says no he said no no no that
[26:32] I'm happy so thank you for that
[26:36] brotherly kindness we're not going along
[26:39] the time we're gonna let him have his
[26:41] way you may be seated I guess until ya
[26:46] is good to us how many out thankful just
[26:50] just thankful I wish I could say it like
[26:55] I feel it but
[26:58] [Laughter]
[27:17] stand to your feet just a moment so we
[27:19] can then get into the word a man giving
[27:22] honor to our Lord amen amen
[27:26] thanking God for the angel of this house
[27:28] and amen and sister Brooks amen yes and
[27:33] we just think off for the Saints I'm
[27:35] brother Keith amen
[27:37] brother Isaac in this absence amen
[27:40] oh there he is back there amen amen
[27:43] brother rich and those I've been able to
[27:45] fellowship with amen the soldiers in the
[27:48] gospel Amen that all up ahead of us
[27:50] looking back to y'all come on
[27:51] amen I've already seen great things
[27:54] y'all let's get on up here
[27:55] amen amen we thank God amen Peter said
[28:00] you know that how amazing it is that we
[28:03] can love Him who we have not seen we
[28:07] haven't seen them yet but how many
[28:09] you're in love with it and it just takes
[28:12] a little bit of inspiration from each
[28:15] preacher and you know God's prophets and
[28:18] a minute just take a little inspiration
[28:19] for them to just give us a glimpse of
[28:21] what he could look like y'all know the
[28:23] story you know that people try to paint
[28:25] him and there's no way to paint it
[28:27] there's no way to ink out that humility
[28:30] all the the magnitude of God and put
[28:33] into a picture frame you know but
[28:36] hummina still love him
[28:37] yes and so I thank God for preaching I
[28:41] think God that he gave all of us a part
[28:43] of it and if God had to make me a
[28:45] preacher I'd have been a big mouth
[28:46] shouting in the church will you please
[28:50] be quiet I can't help it I can't hold it
[28:53] amen amen and so I want you to turn to
[28:56] Genesis to eighth chapter you man
[28:58] picking up where we left off this
[29:00] morning Amen I told you this would be a
[29:03] seat of series on the seasons time
[29:06] seasons and purpose amen so we want to
[29:09] go a little farther with that tonight
[29:10] amen
[29:11] now y'all don't get sad on me tonight
[29:14] just because I get to preach on this
[29:15] amen but the title of this night
[29:17] semesters B night seasons
[29:19] amen amen so let's just see what God
[29:22] would give us amen I rather be obedient
[29:24] to him than for us to shout every time
[29:28] amen I would just rather be obedient and
[29:31] I've learned just to he'll work it out
[29:33] amen amen humming no even when it's dark
[29:36] the Sun is still shining amen
[29:38] yes all right Genesis 822 and I want to
[29:43] read there and let's read it says as
[29:45] long as the earth indoors
[29:48] see and I'm reading a different
[29:50] translation here let me get y'all have
[29:53] King James writes Amen I don't mean the
[29:55] home I like you know I mean I have to
[29:58] study different translations here amen
[30:00] but I like the old-fashioned I just
[30:03] don't mean no harm I'm old-fashioned I
[30:05] don't mind telling it so let me just get
[30:07] Genesis 822 from King James if I read it
[30:11] could read just a little different amen
[30:14] and amen
[30:19] while the earth remaineth seedtime and
[30:22] harvest and cold and heat and summer and
[30:27] winter and day and night shall not cease
[30:33] amen and I'll just read it from the NIV
[30:36] version too but it says as long as the
[30:38] earth and dualist seed time and harvest
[30:40] cold and heat summer and winter day and
[30:44] night will never cease amen let's buy
[30:49] his father we thank you O God we've read
[30:51] your holy scriptures and father as we
[30:53] know that your word is eternal and it is

[31:01] question mark and quotation that you
[31:04] spoken be is fulfilled Lord we pray that
[31:09] whatever our part in there if we're just
[31:12] a period if we're - just a - in the
[31:15] scriptures let that part that you've

[31:51] it you can't mess it up amen
[31:53] yes and not you know so I want to move a
[31:56] little closer to that amen dealing with
[31:58] the seasons and tonight we want to deal
[32:00] with on this evening
[32:01] deal with night seasons and I want to
[32:05] read another scripture here about night
[32:07] seasons
[32:08] David quoted this verse and I have it
[32:10] any mind know said but I don't want to
[32:12] leave it out before I get all stirred
[32:14] amen Psalms for those you take note
[32:16] Psalm 16 verse 5 and 7 before we get
[32:21] into the message tonight I'll recap a
[32:23] little bit so you know those who missed
[32:25] this morning amen and when you meet him
[32:27] cross the street they say well what was
[32:30] the message about you telling guess it's
[32:34] only had a guest preacher and guess
[32:36] amen amen it's always good to come to
[32:40] church you might miss something just the
[32:42] way sometime God will say it different
[32:44] something you know already you heard it
[32:46] before but it was said just a little
[32:48] different and it gets a little bit
[32:50] closer to your spirit amen amen so it's
[32:53] always good Amen God in simplicity amen
[32:56] but I want to read Psalm 16 verse 5 and
[32:59] 7 just to reiterate the subject here and
[33:03] outline it before we get into the
[33:04] message the Lord David said in verse 5
[33:06] the Lord is the portion of my
[33:10] inheritance and of my cup amen thou
[33:16] maintain it my lot thou keepeth my life
[33:20] remember I told you this that the place
[33:24] that we lived in akin and we went
[33:27] through a lot
[33:28] Amen I think the one we had a good
[33:31] neighbor on one side and we had a bad
[33:33] neighbor on one side and he just
[33:35] believed in cutting grass on my side and
[33:38] I said no please don't cut on my side
[33:40] how many know God has given us all a lot
[33:43] and you better sting on your own lot
[33:47] amen
[33:49] working out based on what God has given
[33:51] you though maintenance my lot David I'll
[33:54] say it's also said in verse 6
[33:56] the lines are fallen unto me in Pleasant
[34:00] places that's David looking at his own
[34:04] lines the lines are falling unto me not
[34:10] looking across the street and across the
[34:12] yard and across what somebody else has
[34:14] and what they have and I wish I had I
[34:17] wish amen but looking at your own lines
[34:19] and what everything what's surrounding
[34:22] you it has fallen I'm glad to be Who I
[34:26] am
[34:27] how many can say man the lines have
[34:30] fallen to me in Pleasant places yay I
[34:33] have a godly inheritance if you knew
[34:38] what God has left for us and what he has
[34:41] given to us
[34:41] you'd be a happy person it's like
[34:46] getting married and got some prizes I
[34:48] think when we meet my wife got man we
[34:50] had so many gifts we had stacked them in
[34:53] the closet and we will open them up
[34:54] little by little
[34:55] and God has stacked up so many gifts so
[34:58] many wonderful things in the closet for
[35:00] us and we haven't even unboxed it yet
[35:02] how many think God yes the lines are
[35:06] falling in Pleasant places I have a
[35:10] godly heritage I will what I will bless
[35:14] the Lord who has given me counsel my
[35:20] rains my spirit also and struck me David
[35:24] said in the night season sometimes you
[35:32] have a lot but sometimes you hit a night
[35:36] season and you can't see a thing all
[35:41] your spiritual experience how many no
[35:44] God can take you to a level and that
[35:46] what you thought you could use it ain't
[35:48] working now amen
[35:51] oh Jesus how many know what I'm talking
[35:55] about my mind is my thoughts are just on
[35:57] it right now but sometimes you just got
[35:59] to feel up in the air that's true you
[36:03] don't know you just got to feel hope the
[36:05] line is up there you just got the
[36:08] feel your weight but God is there in the

[36:45] sometimes when God get ready to
[36:48] transform you nobody won't know about it
[36:51] sometimes and God is getting ready to
[36:54] change the dimension of how you act
[36:58] anymore but you won't be mean and snappy
[37:03] no more you know when you get through to
[37:06] and when when this when it when you come
[37:08] up out of the ground you have a little
[37:10] more sweetness to you some sweet

[41:29] long as this time you can still plant
[41:32] there's still time that you can wait for
[41:34] harvest if you planted something you
[41:36] ought to be out there with a straw hat
[41:40] any man my daddy would plant every year
[41:43] and come out to the end of the garden
[41:44] and just look and all he see was a blade
[41:47] but he was so encouraged she's a son if
[41:50] you put three calls in the hell and
[41:52] three calls in the road so high he
[41:54] talked about I can't figure I put three
[41:56] he rolled ahead and two and three and
[41:58] two and three and I just plant behind
[41:59] him I didn't know what in the world I
[42:01] was doing hey man
[42:03] yes but if you put it in the ground
[42:06] harvest time when it come you watch for
[42:09] the blade watch don't look for big
[42:12] things the Bible said despise not the
[42:14] day of small beginnings
[42:16] don't try to start where somebody ND you
[42:19] know that's where people want to do they
[42:21] wanted to read the end of the story they
[42:24] want to start where these great beating
[42:25] mining minister started I mean where
[42:28] they end it and they don't want to start
[42:29] where they began young people listen
[42:31] people gonna laugh at you
[42:33] with all the power with all the
[42:35] anointing with all this that God and
[42:37] giving you you can't dump that into my
[42:39] lap and go running in it you got to
[42:41] start from ABC I'm gonna no you gonna
[42:43] have to be laughed at yeah you have to
[42:46] let him know because see people are go
[42:48] along
[42:48] with you lawns you go along with them
[42:50] then salut they say well let's drink
[42:52] let's take a drink you said well I don't
[42:54] drink you know what
[42:56] so let's take a smoke so I don't smoke
[42:58] what well let's cut a little bit well
[43:00] I'm never come see and then there's a
[43:02] denial period and see if you're gonna
[43:04] act like them are you gonna do not see
[43:06] you'll have to be laughed at how many no
[43:08] you don't have to be laughed at
[43:09] you're gonna have to be a oddball in
[43:11] order for God to use you don't pluck up
[43:17] your seed young people don't be like the
[43:20] rest of the young people be a standard
[43:28] amen yes because when harvest I'm coming
[43:33] whatever's in there is coming up cold
[43:37] and heat summer and winter day and night
[43:40] will never cease I want to look at this
[43:43] in st. John Levin because sometimes when
[43:46] the season changes it can be so
[43:49] devastating can be so devastating when
[43:56] season changes and so in the story we
[44:03] all know you know Jesus said in st. John
[44:06] 11 verse 10 but if a man walking tonight
[44:08] he stumbles because there is no light in
[44:13] him there's no direction in him there's
[44:18] no inspiration in him there's no
[44:25] instruction in the nighttime to him
[44:28] sometimes God will bring you to a place
[44:30] where you don't have an answer
[44:33] people won't ask us to everything that's
[44:37] why people go to psychic and if I could
[44:39] just make up something but make sure you
[44:41] pay the only thing real about that
[44:44] situation is the money how many know
[44:48] that and they make themselves believe
[44:50] that answer all right and so in the
[44:55] situation God in verse 11 these things
[44:58] said he
[45:00] and after that he says done Tim our
[45:03] friend Lazarus is sleeping but I go that
[45:09] I might awake him out of sleep see what
[45:13] happened it was a nighttime the season
[45:18] had changed something that happened that
[45:22] that wasn't when thinking it was gonna
[45:24] happen and how many know Jesus loved
[45:26] Lazarus he loved him he was good friends
[45:30] and the Bible said in verse 12 then is
[45:32] the sign said Lord you know if he's
[45:34] sleeping he's doing well but Jesus
[45:36] wasn't speaking about taking a regular
[45:38] sleep he was talking about he was dead
[45:41] but they thought that he spoke of taking
[45:46] rest in sleep so they thought he was
[45:48] talking about he was sleeping but Jesus
[45:51] a lathers is dead
[45:52] alright then jesus said unto them
[45:55] plainly Lazarus is dead and I'm glad for
[46:01] your sake that I was not there to the
[46:04] intent that you might believe
[46:06] nevertheless that's going to him now
[46:11] here it is the disciples trying to
[46:13] figure out you know I look at here
[46:14] Thomas get a little comical in verse 16
[46:17] and then Thomas said oh with just did of
[46:19] us unto the fellow citizen let us go
[46:21] let us go all so that we may die with
[46:23] him see Thomas getting a little comical
[46:26] trying to use God's Word let us go to
[46:28] that we may die with him you know what
[46:30] Jesus was talking about yes and Thomas
[46:34] had see he said that did Jesus said him
[46:36] when when Jesus came he found that they
[46:39] had laid him in the grave for days
[46:42] already it was past the normal time Oh
[46:48] God
[46:50] it was past three days it was past the
[46:53] time then it could have happened it was
[46:56] past the time where maybe people would
[46:58] have used their faith and sometimes
[47:00] things that you think well how to miss
[47:03] my day how to missed it but if God
[47:05] before you God can turn the time back
[47:10] oh god how many believe that that's not
[47:14] unscriptural now he made God meet time
[47:17] God made the clock amen
[47:21] all right Beth and one answered rules my
[47:24] 15 fur laws it wasn't right around the
[47:26] corner minute a minute the Jews came to
[47:28] Martha Mary to comfort them and just
[47:30] think about it everybody crying he meant
[47:33] verse 21 then said Martha to Jesus Lord
[47:35] if you had been here my brother wouldn't
[47:37] die see and when it happens he when it
[47:40] happened it was a ship and it left her
[47:43] breathless all the people crying
[47:45] everybody morning everybody I forgot
[47:48] well what didn't happen
[47:49] I was Jesus would have been here because
[47:51] if he would have been here and you know
[47:52] people think like that or if he would
[47:54] have been here it wouldn't happen no God
[47:56] ordained for it happen God meant for
[47:59] them because God had something else he
[48:01] was fixing a brain for oh god I hope you
[48:04] see where I am now
[48:05] Lazarus might be dead but I tell you I'm
[48:08] putting for your sake I'm glad that I
[48:12] wasn't down that I might come and go
[48:15] wake Lazarus oh people are not
[48:19] interested don't you worry God knows how
[48:22] to make them interesting people don't
[48:23] care about going to church God know how
[48:25] to bring them in if God could on non
[48:28] animals and the door open and nobody had
[48:31] you're strong where the door was listen
[48:33] when God start up they all find their
[48:37] way they'll find the true church they'll
[48:39] find somebody preaching the truth and
[48:41] they're just it is full well you know I
[48:44] just feel I feel like we need to turn
[48:46] left how many know God can tell you how
[48:48] to turn left God has said turn right go
[48:51] this way stand on the corner don't move
[48:54] and here comes somebody said well you
[48:56] know which way you're going I need to
[48:58] find a church and here they come into
[49:00] the Word of God God can still do it
[49:05] amen yes he can Lazarus was dead the
[49:09] scene had changed and the hope was lost
[49:12] and Jesus loved him I like that and I
[49:16] want you to know Jesus loved sentence he
[49:19] loves it when the condition gets up
[49:22] beyond
[49:24] you know God loves it when it gets
[49:26] beyond normal the loves are when you
[49:28] need a dog and the doctors say we don't
[49:30] have a cure
[49:31] God loves it when it get beyond what
[49:34] human beings can do so he can come be
[49:36] like a man so well I think we could do
[49:39] something about this I like the way God
[49:41] does that he becomes human and then he
[49:45] becomes God so God took this impossible
[49:50] situation here Amen it was all dog amen
[49:54] the season had been shifted Amen but
[49:57] Martha spoke the right thing and I wish
[50:00] the church was because she said but even
[50:01] now Lord whatsoever you ask God taught
[50:08] to give it to you now that's a lesson
[50:10] right there no matter how dark it is
[50:12] even now God could turn it back I missed
[50:16] a lot of opportunity I don't know about
[50:17] you but I know I missed a lot of
[50:19] opportunities I was timid I was afraid I
[50:21] was scared I didn't know how could I do
[50:23] it I didn't know if I could afford it
[50:25] but even now Lord he can tell me and
[50:29] I'll listen even now he can make a way
[50:31] out of no way
[50:33] yes he can oh yes he can even now Martha
[50:39] said even now Lord see and just that
[50:41] moment she blocked out in the morning
[50:42] that's what you got to do that's why I
[50:44] was trying to show you this morning
[50:46] amen amen Moses that had gotten so
[50:48] encouraged I believe you just beginning
[50:49] sometimes gotten encouraged your own
[50:51] self I believe Moses got that start
[50:53] being a Christian you know what I just
[50:55] killed a man and God come and talk to me
[50:58] I know how wretched a man that I am but
[51:01] I know God spoke to me now I can't get
[51:04] out of that and God told me this high
[51:06] this gift word God told me you use it
[51:08] this see God was teaching me how to do
[51:10] all this here and God said well when I
[51:12] tell you to sweet you speak God God told
[51:14] me God told me to raise the stick up
[51:16] there so I'm just gonna wait and all
[51:17] other noise was going away and that's

[51:42] could see the Son of man sitting on the
[51:44] right hand of God he could see the glory

[55:40] you there's gonna be a revival that will
[55:41] unmatch anything we've ever seen it's
[55:45] got to be because God is greater yes
[55:49] lather was put to sleep for a season it
[55:52] was to change things around and get the
[55:54] furniture moved around not you doing it

[56:22] when you see things start working and
[56:24] clicking like it's supposed to be you
[56:26] see all mine say the season is right the
[56:29] timing is right it's gotta be God this
[56:31] time Oh hallelujah and I'm gonna be
[56:34] right there when it happened
[56:36] Oh God give God praise night season see
[56:43] how good God could beat you even in the
[56:44] night time God can instruct you in the
[56:46] night when you don't know what's going
[56:48] on God can put an answer in your heart
[56:51] brother and it's the right answer and
[56:54] you can't say it but it is fulfilling
[56:57] itself by your heart and that's powerful
[57:01] and I just interpret that but that's
[57:03] exactly what happened
[57:05] God can give you answer well Lord should
[57:10] I or shouldn't I you know God got a way
[57:12] of answering me I'm gonna know that God
[57:18] got away he don't have to I am going to
[57:21] do it oh oh he doesn't do it amen
[57:27] yes but how many love you Amen all right
[57:31] so let's just move on this move a little
[57:32] close can we go a little further our lad
[57:34] was put to sleep for a reason I said
[57:36] that now and that that happened it shall
[57:39] happen again they'll put him to sleep
[57:42] amen and it'll be past three days and I
[57:44] tell you I believe I'm gonna believe
[57:46] this past three days oh my hate to say
[57:49] it but how many know all of us we stink
[57:51] I know you don't want to say Amen
[57:56] brother I'm not yeah it's just a little
[57:58] perfume you got on if you don't put none
[58:01] on tomorrow the truth will be told a man
[58:05] is nothing - none of us we're not how
[58:07] many - know that without God we are
[58:10] sinners that's right yes lathers death
[58:13] stuck in there unmoved Amy
[58:15] and the church seemed like is not there
[58:18] amen but for God God did that for a
[58:20] reason because God even got its internet
[58:23] power we don't need it
[58:24] God won't give us more and we don't need
[58:27] it
[58:28] no sir got old Jesus I'm gonna know what
[58:31] I'm talking about if the times get
[58:33] rougher than God got it that way because
[58:35] what he a man has appointed us to do
[58:38] what he spoke about that we will do in
[58:40] the latter days you know the Bible said
[58:43] that we shall do exploits a man no you
[58:47] just won't get by a man we're gonna need
[58:49] the power so if you need the power of
[58:52] God gotta let the devil do little more
[58:54] I'm gonna know right when God got ready
[58:56] to deliver the children Israel amen the
[58:58] taskmasters got harder and then wonder
[59:01] why is he getting off I don't know if I
[59:03] want to trust Moses and I know you
[59:04] better go with Moses it's gonna be rough
[59:07] either way go amen but I'd rather go
[59:09] with God hallelujah lads put back it was
[59:14] a night season things that change
[59:16] everybody crying and sometimes people
[59:18] get crying you get the cry don't know
[59:20] why you crying
[59:21] I mean I know what I'm talking about yes
[59:24] amen
[59:25] all right all right and so that's what
[59:28] happened here
[59:29] all right let's look at Luke 22 27 let's
[59:32] go here for who is greater the one who's
[59:33] at the table or the one who serves I
[59:35] want to give you another example here in
[59:38] me and then we're gonna stop here Amen
[59:40] but I want to show you how Peters I mean
[59:42] I love Peter but I want you to see this
[59:46] real quickly sometimes it changes and
[59:48] God don't have to warn you you just have
[59:50] to know it didn't change now yes you
[59:53] have two good long years or revived when
[59:55] you wake up your cup of coffee and you
[59:57] get to study nothing's distract you then
[59:59] God pushed the time back say you got to
[1:00:01] figure out how to get up earlier amen
[1:00:06] it's God's program I'm gonna know that's
[1:00:08] the truth God can break up your regular
[1:00:10] habits I told you you know you even your
[1:00:13] body play tricks on you I was telling
[1:00:14] the church I was preaching I'll see
[1:00:15] y'all I said don't worry about me I said
[1:00:17] this suit is small I mean the suit is
[1:00:19] big you know the body played tricks on
[1:00:22] you when the body knows that you going
[1:00:24] fast you just came fast normal so well I
[1:00:26] fast one or two hours well if he
[1:00:29] don't have about 20 years the devil got
[1:00:31] you I'm gonna know that yeah you know my
[1:00:36] body played tricks on me and I had to
[1:00:37] learn after several years ago I learned
[1:00:40] from I learned from your pastor yeah I
[1:00:42] learned from him and you know what I
[1:00:44] went fast and fast and not the way I
[1:00:45] thought my goodness
[1:00:46] it got said well you didn't give me a
[1:00:48] little more yeah you know the body
[1:00:50] played tricks on you body know so well
[1:00:52] oh yeah he going fast and you know and
[1:00:54] that's the time you swell up more I
[1:00:58] won't ask me about any witness death but
[1:01:01] yeah your body swells up because it says
[1:01:03] you know what it Fitness saw of me so
[1:01:05] what I'm gonna do I'm gonna stow up some
[1:01:07] more food and sometimes you swell up
[1:01:09] biggest I'll see you you better go on
[1:01:11] and fast anyway I'm gonna know what I'm
[1:01:13] talking about yes sir email it's just a
[1:01:15] little meat just a little food a man's
[1:01:17] heart so now let's look at Peter I want
[1:01:19] you to see how some time is it's hard
[1:01:22] the way God does it but it has to do it
[1:01:24] this way all right in Luke 22 verse 28
[1:01:27] you are those who have stood by me in my
[1:01:31] trials beautiful go with me just a
[1:01:35] moment I just want you to see this and
[1:01:37] you just think about all those apostles
[1:01:39] when Jesus came along and he picked a
[1:01:42] few guys I'd say they were bosom buddies
[1:01:46] youngja did you meet a person that's a
[1:01:48] real genuine article it seemed like you
[1:01:51] know them all along it's not a whole lot
[1:01:53] of issues you don't have to stand taller
[1:01:55] they accept you just hunt all y'all

[1:12:20] it you're gonna deny me three times
[1:12:22] I'm gonna tell you when it's gonna
[1:12:24] happen let me know God is just that
[1:12:28] accurate Jesus braces Peter up right
[1:12:33] here to understand that a time would
[1:12:36] come for him like never before
[1:12:38] that his own testimony showed he had no
[1:12:41] clue of a turning point in his life
[1:12:44] right here was a turning point for
[1:12:48] Peters life right here amen probably all
[1:12:51] the disciples they didn't see it either
[1:12:53] but you know the scripture has already
[1:12:55] declared that all of them was gonna deny
[1:12:58] every one of them smite the Shepherd and
[1:13:00] the Sheep he's got every but one of them
[1:13:02] eventually what's gonna turn back and go
[1:13:03] back to fishing how many know that's the
[1:13:05] truth he said I won't go see begin see
[1:13:08] God begin the prophesied that a
[1:13:10] nighttime was coming in sometime when
[1:13:12] the night time come you can't see it
[1:13:15] nobody else can see it
[1:13:16] and God can blind the whole nation and
[1:13:20] none of them see it and God can blind
[1:13:23] everybody and everybody looking at
[1:13:25] everybody and can't see who they are I
[1:13:27] mean I know God blind it Israel for
[1:13:30] lying on Joseph Joseph's brother lied on
[1:13:35] him amen and the lie blinded them and
[1:13:40] Joseph was still alive on the earth just
[1:13:47] a few miles away
[1:13:48] daddy something happened to him we don't
[1:13:50] know don't you tell a lie get it right
[1:13:54] the thing blinded the boys where they
[1:13:57] couldn't know they could they'd believe
[1:14:00] the lie they beginning to believe that
[1:14:03] the brother was dead and how many know
[1:14:05] Joseph was not dead they sold him they
[1:14:09] told her daddy a lie it blinded him it
[1:14:12] was a night time for Joseph
[1:14:15] but God was working right away anyway
[1:14:19] and there he was standing before his own
[1:14:22] brothers and brothers so blind they
[1:14:25] couldn't even see him but he could see
[1:14:28] them so this night time came for Peter
[1:14:36] right here it came amen amen
[1:14:40] verses verse 35 and I want to I want to
[1:14:45] stop right here
[1:14:46] but I want you to see something
[1:14:47] interesting here I know you wouldn't
[1:14:50] believe that Jesus would do this but he
[1:14:52] did it I want to stop right this poor
[1:14:55] Emily get I wanna make it clear to you
[1:14:57] that sometimes you night season come and
[1:14:59] you think God would do it God will allow
[1:15:00] it but if he allows it he'll bring you
[1:15:03] through it if God like if you got put
[1:15:06] you to something so tough and so rough
[1:15:08] and you don't have answers and you can't
[1:15:10] come back to tell the church what God
[1:15:12] gonna do just stand still
[1:15:17] amen
[1:15:18] what's so precious he is right at this
[1:15:21] moment you can imagine what it felt like
[1:15:23] that Jesus you know we can agree that
[1:15:26] Peter was kind of close to Jesus now
[1:15:28] yeah all the disciples had their time
[1:15:30] with him but you know you know Peter was
[1:15:32] just that kind of guy and it's probably
[1:15:35] close to him and imagine what it was
[1:15:36] like Jesus
[1:15:38] pushing Peter away from him i watch the
[1:15:43] scripture unfold right here Jesus be
[1:15:45] tendancy night you fish to go through a
[1:15:47] trial
[1:15:47] Peter said don't forget I pray for you
[1:15:50] and
[1:15:52] here in verse 36 he said now I mean
[1:15:55] verse 35 then Jesus actually said now
[1:15:57] when I sent you we're gonna finish it
[1:15:59] just read this right these verses right
[1:16:01] here Jesus asked them when I sent you
[1:16:04] without purse bag or sandals did you
[1:16:09] lack anything how many know when Jesus
[1:16:12] first came in this Minister he told him
[1:16:13] don't take purse bag on Saturday I
[1:16:16] watched this we got the beginning of
[1:16:21] Jesus ministry telling him don't take
[1:16:23] these things but then in verse 36 he
[1:16:27] said to them but now if you have a purse
[1:16:31] take it

[1:16:52] the scripture now I didn't make it up
[1:16:53] look at your Bible cuz I this is a hard
[1:16:55] place for a preacher to get through cuz

[1:28:30] make our hand feel that line Oh God you
[1:28:33] can in oh Jesus what it will be like the
[1:28:38] touch the line the right line and the
[1:28:42] move fault bring the church out of

[1:28:59] for that brother for groups I called my
[1:29:04] father no y'all heard you don't have to
[1:29:20] ask whether any of us have had
[1:29:23] experiences of night season you know and
[1:29:27] it's so key we will experience these
[1:29:30] seasons until Jesus comes so when you
[1:29:34] feel like you up on the mountain enjoy
[1:29:37] every morning because the night season
[1:29:41] is coming the valley is coming and you
[1:29:46] know I love the Lord because he tells us
[1:29:49] these things the Word of God says they
[1:29:52] get not strange when you fall into
[1:29:54] divers temptations knowing that the
[1:29:57] trial of your faith is more precious
[1:29:58] than gold we've come to be tested and
[1:30:02] sometimes I think we think that when
[1:30:04] we're Christians it's going to be easy
[1:30:06] I've never seen it where a man can carry
[1:30:11] a cross and call it easy
[1:30:14] and Jesus said if you are gonna be my
[1:30:17] disciples
[1:30:19] you must take up your cross and follow
[1:30:21] me
[1:30:23] sometimes we forget that we must
[1:30:26] experience those rain storms amen but
[1:30:30] understand that rain storm is just for
[1:30:33] you it helps you those roots to go
[1:30:37] deeper so we love the Lord in the word
[1:30:40] of God I appreciate the message this
[1:30:43] morning
[1:30:44] I appreciate the message now because we
[1:30:48] realize that every season will change
[1:30:50] yes that's what I love about it yeah you
[1:30:53] know I couldn't live in Alaska
[1:30:57] [Music]
[1:30:59] the season Shane from snow to more snow
[1:31:05] from coal DeMarco but I'm just glad that
[1:31:09] I live in a place where we can get awful
[1:31:12] awful yes because each peach season
[1:31:14] speaks to my heart
[1:31:16] y'all know how it is I know some people
[1:31:19] love snow and I'm so I'm gonna I just
[1:31:21] don't want to disappoint you but over
[1:31:23] there there is no snow snow is a
[1:31:27] perversion snow came by the fall amen
[1:31:30] now I want you to know that the
[1:31:32] temperatures a man was so beautiful and
[1:31:34] so perfect in HIDA
[1:31:36] they didn't have to wear clothes but
[1:31:40] will wear clothes this time but
[1:31:42] everything will be some regulated and
[1:31:45] after all of the day everything is over
[1:31:49] we'll live in a sin up in a city where
[1:31:53] the seasons won't affect us it will only
[1:31:56] affect those who are outside the city in
[1:32:02] that city
[1:32:03] we won't need no luck because the lamb
[1:32:07] will be the light you see it's a
[1:32:10] beautiful situation because where we
[1:32:14] will be there will be no changes we'll
[1:32:18] really see Jesus Christ as being the
[1:32:20] same yesterday today of ever he will be
[1:32:22] a constant he'll be we'll be in a place
[1:32:26] that we don't ever have to worry about a
[1:32:30] cloudy day is that right Oh God is good
[1:32:34] to us he changes everything for us and
[1:32:37] I'm so grateful for my brother speaking
[1:32:41] I missed out a little part because I had
[1:32:45] to go you know attend to some things but
[1:32:48] you know I thank God for the message
[1:32:53] this morning spoke so much to me till
[1:32:55] this change me it's I can't explain it I
[1:32:58] see it I understand it and and it has
[1:33:02] given me a greater hope if I could see
[1:33:04] it like that because sometimes you think
[1:33:07] you forget we all miss those chances
[1:33:10] but to know that there's another season
[1:33:12] there's another time there's another
[1:33:14] time where when you plant you reap but
[1:33:18] like I said if you don't plant nothing
[1:33:19] you don't get nothing right but if the
[1:33:22] seed is going down if you have planted
[1:33:24] and how do you plant your plant in
[1:33:26] prayer yeah you see them saying you you
[1:33:29] so you you claim things you you say god
[1:33:32] this is it that's that that and it has
[1:33:35] to happen and win that season calm those
[1:33:39] seeds of faith that have been planted
[1:33:41] has to produce the product exactly I
[1:33:44] think God and I'm gonna say this and
[1:33:48] closer you know when it comes to your
[1:33:50] relatives you never give up you fight
[1:33:56] like Abraham you may not have enough but
[1:33:58] a home but lot is coming back with me if
[1:34:02] that's what it be you understand me you
[1:34:05] don't give up on them God has set you in
[1:34:08] a priesthood and this priesthood you are
[1:34:11] the one that distributes the blood hello
[1:34:15] we're all your priesthood if they're
[1:34:18] going to escape they will seal it's
[1:34:21] gonna be by your prayer by you applying
[1:34:24] the blood for the velum center like this
[1:34:26] applying the token it doesn't matter how
[1:34:29] bad they look is anything too hard for
[1:34:32] God if he can raise a man that's been
[1:34:35] there for days rod it raised him up till
[1:34:39] he didn't even stake no more right every
[1:34:42] evidence of death was gone
[1:34:46] your situation may look like that the
[1:34:49] people that you so been praying for may
[1:34:51] look like they hopeless Alleluia it may
[1:34:55] look like a take it can't happen
[1:34:56] but there's a time yeah there's a season
[1:35:00] there's a sawing time and there's a
[1:35:02] reaping time yeah right and that's all
[1:35:05] we have to do all sake of God if our
[1:35:08] fathers is a farmer we're ordained to be
[1:35:11] farmers
[1:35:13] spiritual farmers planting sowing and
[1:35:17] reaping and we thank God for His grace
[1:35:20] we thank God for our precious brother
[1:35:21] and I just want to say to you you know
[1:35:24] even if you know right now crazy things
[1:35:27] are happening right sometimes the storms
[1:35:31] look like me gonna flood everything out
[1:35:33] but God has built a standard one thing I
[1:35:38] love about Jerusalem Jerusalem was a
[1:35:40] walled city and as long as Israel did
[1:35:45] right before God no enemy could come now
[1:35:48] that camp everything was destroyed and
[1:35:52] I'm saying you knew Jerusalem y'all hear
[1:35:55] what I'm saying you might go through
[1:35:57] some some seasons but like the brother
[1:36:00] said you always come out as a winner I'm
[1:36:04] sorry I I said like this I believe I
[1:36:06] believe the script when Paul said I'm
[1:36:08] more than a conqueror I believe that not
[1:36:12] just for me but for my whole house I
[1:36:14] believe that I'm more than a conqueror I
[1:36:18] believe I'm more than a conqueror
[1:36:20] brother just if I'm a king I got a
[1:36:23] kingdom you read it and just like Jesus
[1:36:30] has a kingdom I have a kingdom and one
[1:36:32] day my kingdom which is his kingdom we
[1:36:35] sit at the table of his kingdom but he
[1:36:41] gave me a portion of here and that's the
[1:36:45] way I look at it by God's grace his
[1:36:48] kingdom is there my kingdom in his
[1:36:50] kingdom it will be his kingdom and we'll
[1:36:52] be there right he made us kings and
[1:36:57] priests I could say the same thing I'm
[1:37:03] not even I don't know what he finished
[1:37:07] on Joe but you say Joe it wasn't all
[1:37:10] about Joe God started God finished it
[1:37:14] yes and then he looked over there and
[1:37:16] gave Joe rewards for being used by him
[1:37:21] in the bath
[1:37:24] hey don't think you're not gonna have a
[1:37:29] reward for fighting gods battle is that
[1:37:32] right
[1:37:33] yeah see God is the spirit you know we
[1:37:36] we can't see him in that follow but he
[1:37:38] choose us right
[1:37:42] he wanted the Angels and everybody to
[1:37:44] see what with behind the scene there
[1:37:46] were Lucifer and how we come down here
[1:37:48] in God seasons in God's time and we know
[1:37:57] if the devil go to defecate we he's
[1:38:00] ordained to fake you're the winners your
[1:38:06] danger wins I don't care what it looks
[1:38:09] like oh I'm leaving this word I ain't
[1:38:12] messing with this necess no board on
[1:38:13] that listen you don't hear the devil's
[1:38:16] lie is that right joe says woman you
[1:38:19] sound foolish you don't sound like my
[1:38:21] wife I love that you know God because
[1:38:24] Joe recognized his wife was not talking
[1:38:28] like Jesus recognized that wasn't Peter
[1:38:32] and he said Satan I rebuke you when you
[1:38:39] hit it
[1:38:39] your love was talking nonsense and you
[1:38:42] know they've been raised in this word
[1:38:43] you tell the devil you don't sound like
[1:38:47] my daughter you don't sound like my son
[1:38:50] because that is not your daughter that
[1:38:53] is not your son
[1:38:54] that is the inspiration of the devil if
[1:38:58] you don't see the devil you go see flesh
[1:39:00] and blood and the Bible says we wrestle
[1:39:02] not against flesh and blood it's
[1:39:04] spiritual wickedness
[1:39:06] you don't feel nothing when Satan comes
[1:39:09] around and try to throw his bluff on you
[1:39:12] don't fear him you look at that devil
[1:39:14] and say hey I know who you are and it
[1:39:19] ain't gonna stop me from praying and it
[1:39:21] ain't gonna stop me from believing you
