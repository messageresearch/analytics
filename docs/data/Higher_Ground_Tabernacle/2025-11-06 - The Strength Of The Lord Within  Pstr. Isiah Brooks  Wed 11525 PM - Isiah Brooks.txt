We're glad to be here by the grace of God and we're able to worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; Uh in spirit and in truth. And &gt;&gt; and so we thank God for truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; We um last message that we spoke, we were dealing with the living colors of the rainbow. And and in that we showed how we are elected of God, chosen by God. And because we are chosen by him, uh there is no one who could lay any type of negative charge to us. &gt;&gt; With that being said, uh it ought to give us power and strength. And I believe by God's grace that God has given us just that. &gt;&gt; We're going to be reading from Acts 1 and8. I'm just kind of sticking this in uh to the message we preached last &gt;&gt; because I'm not I'm not done with that particular message, the more I see God, &gt;&gt; the more I I think to myself, &gt;&gt; what is man &gt;&gt; that thou are mindful of him. I marvel. &gt;&gt; Uh to me uh the condition of man &gt;&gt; make God just that much greater. &gt;&gt; A holy God, &gt;&gt; a powerful God, the only true living God. &gt;&gt; Yet he would take interest in us. That amazes me. And you know, I love the way God works. He He doesn't work like men. &gt;&gt; He works like God. And what we the way we think is not the way he thinks. And so I'm so grateful tonight to understand the God of William Brandom. or may I say Elijah &gt;&gt; because we got to understand tonight that there are many gods and there are many Jesuses. But God said in the last day he would come as the son of man. And in that ministry, &gt;&gt; God revealed to us who he is. Otherwise we would be Baptist, &gt;&gt; Methodist, Pentecostal, &gt;&gt; Catholic, whatever. We would be some kind of denomination. But then we came to understand that God in his word as we stand, let us turn to Acts 1 and8 which is a familiar scripture. Excuse me. &gt;&gt; My My eye is a little bloodshot up here, so don't uh &gt;&gt; it's what happens ever so often. &gt;&gt; I I Excuse me. I'm almost I'm almost at the end of my journey, &gt;&gt; but I still have to get these injections. But my eye has improved tremendously. So that nobody but Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let us turn to Acts 1 and8. But ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you. &gt;&gt; And ye shall be witnesses. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. I like that. I like that word. Ye shall be witness unto me both in Jerusalem and in all of Judea and in Samaria &gt;&gt; and unto the uttermost parts of the earth. And we know what a witness is. Someone who's been there, who was there when it happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. Second Chronicles, please. We're going to start at the 32nd verse. &gt;&gt; Excuse me, the 32nd chapter. Forgive me. Beginning at the seventh verse, it says, "Be strong and courageous. Be not afraid nor dismayed &gt;&gt; for the king of Assyria, &gt;&gt; nor for all the multitude that is with him in him. &gt;&gt; For there be more with us than with him. &gt;&gt; With him &gt;&gt; is an arm of flesh, &gt;&gt; but with us is the Lord our God &gt;&gt; to help us &gt;&gt; and to fight our battles. &gt;&gt; And this is where I got love. And the people rested themselves upon the word of Hezekiah, the king of Let us pray. Our gracious father, we thank you for your grace and your mercy. We thank you for being so good to us. &gt;&gt; Lord, you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves. And Lord, we just pray tonight something will be said in this message. Bless your people. Strengthen them in their faith. Give them the courage and strength to go further and to go on. Help us now Lord Jesus because we are nothing without your guidance. You are our leader. &gt;&gt; You are our head. You are our Lord. And we pray that you would lead us and guide us into all truth. And may we obey you, Lord, not out of fear, but because we love you. Have mercy upon us now. In your name Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; I think I it just something that really uh in while I was praying &gt;&gt; uh struck me uh &gt;&gt; and I I need to say this when it comes to the Holy Ghost. Uh we may you may not get a a a sensation the first but somewhere in in your life &gt;&gt; God will v visit you &gt;&gt; and the best way I would say uh that a man has the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; is when he comes to his rest. You understand what I mean? You're no longer struggling on whether the blood is powerful enough to save you, but you have taken the simplicity of the gospel and you have applied it to your life. And that rest, remember, that's what Jesus promised in Hebrews. It says you'll labor or enter into my rest and that laboring is against unbelief. But if God said it, that's enough. There is nothing you can do other than to receive the word, believe the word, and act upon it. Matter of fact, brother Brandham said it like this. He said, "Even if you don't have a baby, adopt one." He said, "Adopt one." &gt;&gt; If you don't have the Holy Ghost, confess that you have it. &gt;&gt; Keep on confessing it. Keep on believing it. And then God will bring it to pass. See, &gt;&gt; it is important that we have the strength of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. on the inside of us. When I worked with the characteristics of God or the divine nature, I was actually uh uh working with his strength whether you thought about it like this or not. But the very divine nature that God is trying to place within us, &gt;&gt; it's the same nature that said, "Let there be." There's only one nature of God. &gt;&gt; And that nature he poured into Christ and then Christ poured into into the church. IT'S NOT DIFFICULT. GOD IS always revealed in simplicity. But we make things difficult because WE FEEL LIKE WE'VE got to have something to do with it. And at the END OF THE DAY, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. GOD IS IN CONTROL OF EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; Is that right? THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, &gt;&gt; "You can speak in tongues, you can dance, you can shout, &gt;&gt; you can GIVE TITHES, YOU GIVE ALL OF THOSE THINGS, BUT IF YOU DON'T have the Holy Ghost, if you have not come to your REST AND believe that Jesus Christ took your sins away, he is your perpetuation. He is YOUR ATONEMENT." HALLELUJAH. HE IS THE LAMB OF GOD THAT TAKES AWAY YOUR SIN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SIMPLE &gt;&gt; BUT POWERFUL. &gt;&gt; Because a lot of times people think is how much message you can quote. You are deceived. Because the devil can outquote you. And there is no way he can be saved. Y'all hear me? AND THERE'S NO WAY THE DEVIL CAN BE BORN AGAIN. &gt;&gt; Because if he's born again, then he becomes A SON OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU CAN BE AS DUMB AS A ROCK BUT FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST and you are bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Within that revelation, &gt;&gt; you have strength. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; NO FALSE DOCTRINE &gt;&gt; WILL EVER GET YOU &gt;&gt; IF YOU TRULY HAVE THE HOLY GHOST within you. You may not even BE ABLE TO QUOTE THE BIBLE OR EVEN QUOTE EVERYTHING BROTHER BHAM TELLS YOU, BUT YOU IT AIN'T YOU. IT'S A GOD IN YOU. AND GOD KNOWS HIS WORD. WHEN IT'S PREACHED RIGHT AND WHEN IT'S PREACHED WRONG. HALLELUJAH. IT'S NOT EVEN YOUR INTERPRETATION OF THE MESSAGE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Cuz God's word needs no interpretation. &gt;&gt; But we need revelation. Having the strength of God &gt;&gt; is having God set on the throne of your heart. &gt;&gt; Then he becomes king. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? And when we think about strength, &gt;&gt; it is the capacity of an object &gt;&gt; or substance &gt;&gt; to withand great force or pressure. Sometimes people think that having big muscles is being strong. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But you got to realize that many people have big muscles. and they're not strong. &gt;&gt; And you can take a thin man with hardly no muscles, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Who can whip a man with big muscles, right? Because he knows how to place HIS STRENGTH. COME ON, SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; And strength, when it comes to strength, &gt;&gt; it's here. &gt;&gt; It's what you receive in your mind. IF YOU BELIEVE you can do it, you can do it. &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT? THAT'S THE BIBLE. ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE to them that believe. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS WHERE STRENGTH COMES FROM. LIKE I READ THE SCRIPTURE WHEN IT CAME TO HEZEKIAH. HEZEKIAH SAID THAT THE ARMY THAT'S AGAINST US, THEY'RE THIS FLESH. THEY MAY HAVE A GREATER NUMBER than what WE HAVE IN THIS BATTLE. HALLELUJAH. BUT THE BATTLE IS THE LORD. MY STRENGTH OR OUR STRENGTH IS NOT FLESH AND BLOOD. BUT OUR STRENGTH COMES FROM THE LORD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WELL, YOU SAY, "WELL, WHY ARE YOU PREACHING THIS? WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS GOING TO TURN INTO." HALLELUJAH. BUT YOU BETTER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TURNING INTO. HALLELUJAH. IS THAT RIGHT? BECAUSE IT TAKES THE STRENGTH OF THE LORD ON THE INSIDE TO KEEP YOU FROM BECOMING WHAT THEY ARE. HALLELUJAH. YOU SAY, "WELL, WHERE DO YOU GET THIS FROM, BROTHER BROOKS?" THE BIBLE EVEN SAID, "AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF SODOM, is that right? AND ABRAHAM AND ALL OF HIS HERDSMAN IS THAT RIGHT? &gt;&gt; LOT'S HERDSMEN WERE ONCE CHRISTIANS. &gt;&gt; BUT ONCE THEY WENT DOWN TO THE CITY, THEY ALL CHANGED. &gt;&gt; AND THE ONLY RIGHTEOUS LEFT IN THE CITY WAS LOT AND his family minus his wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Minus his wife. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND SHE MAY HAVE BEEN A CHRISTIAN, BUT SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH WITHIN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THIS STRENGTH COMES BY THE FEAR OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAYS THAT THE FEAR OF GOD IS THE BEGINNING OF WISDOM and knowledge. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. SHE IS WITHIN YOUR HEAD. SHE HEARD THE WORD. WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T TURN AROUND. DON'T LOOK BACK. HALLELUJAH. Y'ALL HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING? BUT THE STRENGTH OF GOD WAS NOT IN HER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT IT WAS IN LOT. Y'ALL UNDERSTAND ME? AND BECAUSE OF THE INWARD STRENGTH, &gt;&gt; he was able to escape. &gt;&gt; Now, his strength didn't last but so long. But it was long enough to keep him from going into the fire because after they escaped, &gt;&gt; he got drunk. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; I mean, same thing with Noah, HE &gt;&gt; HE GOT DRUNK AFTERWARDS. &gt;&gt; AND WHENEVER he he you know, YOU GET DRUNK. THAT'S SOMEWHERE YOU'VE GOT BECOME WEAK. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE NOT IN YOUR FULL STRENGTH. IS THAT RIGHT? AND I'M TALKING NATURALLY AND SPIRITUALLY. YOU'RE NOT IN YOUR FULL STRENGTH. AND THE DEVIL CAN GET YOU TO DO THINGS THAT YOU WOULD NORMALLY NOT DO. HALLELUJAH. But the Bible says ye shall RECEIVE POWER. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID NOT NOT JUST POWER. HE SAID THAT WORD MEANS AUTHORITY. Now I I I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE YOU'RE NOT A MANAGER. MAYBE YOU'RE NOT A BOSS ON THE JOB. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT ONE THING I DO KNOW &gt;&gt; THAT WHEN YOU BECOME THE BOSS, &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T ASK THE QUESTIONS. HALLELUJAH. YOU TELL THE PEOPLE WHAT YOU WANT TO BE DONE. HALLELUJAH. AND THE ONLY QUESTIONS THAT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO ASK IS, can you explain that more? &gt;&gt; RIGHT. BUT THEY MUST DO WHAT YOU SAY DO &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU ARE THE person in authority. &gt;&gt; WHAT WE DON'T REALIZE IS THAT EVERY DEMON, EVERY DEVIL IS SUBJECT TO US. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU FAIL, FORGET IT. IF YOU FAIL AND FORGET IT, IT'S NOT NOT IN YOUR HEAD. It has to be in your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when it's in your heart, God will reign in you. &gt;&gt; He will be Lord in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, Satan comes by surprises sometimes. He will be. Hallelujah. Matter of fact, I had an incident today. Amen. And I almost lost control in the way of anger. But then the Lord checked me and and call me on now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Y'all looking at me like I don't know. Y'all don't even know what I'm talking about. Simple to you. &gt;&gt; But it's simple enough to be be used. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not a good hunter or I'm not one that know, you know, can just use any kind of rifle. that if it's new to me, you're going to have to explain it to me more than once. &gt;&gt; And that's what my friend did. He explained it to me. If I had it, oh, you I know you got it now. But the point is, &gt;&gt; I had a Kodak moment. &gt;&gt; Three deer &gt;&gt; lined up like a pitcher. You hear what I'm saying? One here, one here, and one here. &gt;&gt; I had the opportunity &gt;&gt; to TAKE ALL THREE OF THEM DOWN. NOW, IF I KNEW what I was doing, IT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. BUT WHEN I WENT TO FIRE the uh uh the rifle, &gt;&gt; it went click. &gt;&gt; It jammed. &gt;&gt; And I'm thinking, "Oh, &gt;&gt; how did he say undo this?" Make this thing work. It's freezing cold. It's freezing cold. I am in authority, power, life and death in my head. And because I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO WORK IT, my whole little click here went wow. See, that's what happened to us. We don't know how to handle the word. &gt;&gt; And when it jams or something, make it jam. We don't know how to unjam it. You hear what I'm saying? Because once THE WORD GOES OUT, IT CANNOT COME BACK FOR IS LITERALLY GOING TO ACCOMPLISH WHATEVER YOU ASK. WHATEVER YOU PUT IN THE RIGHT FOR WHATEVER REASON. HALLELUJAH. IT WILL KILL THE ENEMY every time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the strength has to be inward. Well, I came to conclusion I'm not a hunter. &gt;&gt; Especially in the cold weather. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm I'm I'm I'm speaking these things because I personally &gt;&gt; saw something within myself. &gt;&gt; You see, everything works together for the good. And when you fall short, God, that's God speaking to you. &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with being wrong. &gt;&gt; The problem comes in when you don't want to be right. &gt;&gt; Because when you're wrong, you're going to try your best to make things right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Y'all understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's that's even even sometime when you try to think make things right, it doesn't go the way you want it to go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But you make things right by way of confession. &gt;&gt; Can I say it like this? &gt;&gt; You dealing with a lust spirit. You can't say, "Lord, forgive me of my known and my unknown." &gt;&gt; You got TO YOU GOT TO NAIL THE THINGS. IT IT HURTS. SOME OF THE THINGS WE DEAL WITH HURTS TO ACKNOWLEDGE, BUT YOU GOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT. I'VE HAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT. SOMETIMES I CAN HARDLY GET MY TONGUE TO SAY IT. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad some of y'all know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; BUT ONCE you say it, &gt;&gt; IT EXPOSES THE DEVIL and then God goes after it. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Second Chronicles 32, please. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; We just read that. All right. So, let's go to Matthew 6. &gt;&gt; I try every day &gt;&gt; to allow God to rule me. &gt;&gt; I don't mind being ruled by the word. I want the word to rule me. I don't like myself being over the word. You understand what I'm trying to say? I want the world word to rule me so much. I want to be like Paul said I am a prisoner of Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now because you're behind the bars doesn't mean you don't have a desire to do something. But there is a there's a boundary. There is something that keeps you from going beyond that. THAT'S THE HOLY SPIRIT. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S the kind of strength you have within. &gt;&gt; Remember I was talking the other week about the rainbow. &gt;&gt; And brother and brother Bradam said he saw two of them. And he said they looked like they were they were moving. It was alive. And he was going up to see this thing. And he said something made him stop. He couldn't go. BUT SO FAR, GOD MADE HIM STOP. That's the kind of That's THE KIND OF CONTROL I want God to have over ME THAT IF I'M WALKING IN A WAY THAT'S NOT RIGHT OR EVEN IF IT IS RIGHT WHEN HE WANTS ME TO STOP, I WANT TO HAVE THE ABILITY SENSIBILITY STOPS. &gt;&gt; Matthew 6 My thought is this &gt;&gt; and I'm going to always be like this. &gt;&gt; What good what good would it do you &gt;&gt; to know all the mysteries of what William Brandon brought what God did through him. What good will it do you if you don't have the life? &gt;&gt; If Christ is not in you. You're wasting your time. You're fooling yourself. &gt;&gt; Your goal and my goal is to make ourselves ready. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And you're going to have failures. You're going to fall. YOU'RE GOING TO STUMBLE. WHATEVER IT IS, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO CRAWL SOMETIME. HALLELUJAH. BUT IT OUGHT TO BE IN YOUR HEART, IN YOUR HALLELUJAH. THAT YOU HAVE A GOAL. TO GO. HE DID NOT PRESS TOWARD THE MARK OF A HIGHER CALLING IN CHRIST JESUS. IT DOESN'T &gt;&gt; I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND SELFISH, &gt;&gt; BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS DOING. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And this is between you and God. people. It's got to be a personal thing. But understand, the grace of God got you covered. You go, you might MESS UP GETTING THERE, but the grace of God HAS YOU COVERED. NOW, THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK FOR YOU IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. YOU GOT TO BELIEVE THAT THE GRACE OF God takes you from glory to glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, come on. Show me a perfect man in the Bible. There is nothing but one that was Jesus himself. And the Bible said all sin and come short of the glory of God. It's been grace in the beginning in THE END. HALLELUJAH. THAT IS YOUR STRENGTH. WHEN THE DEVIL SAVES YOU NOTHING, LET HIM KNOW I'M COVERED BY THE BLOOD. IT'S NOT EVEN WHAT I THINK ABOUT ME. IT'S WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT ME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Tell the devil, I know what God thinks about you. &gt;&gt; And I think the same thing. &gt;&gt; You a devil. Nothing but a tormentor. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He rules in his kingdom. want him to rule. &gt;&gt; I was thinking about a young man today when I was in the apostolic church &gt;&gt; and his last name was Hooper. We used to call him minister &gt;&gt; and he would walk from his from college &gt;&gt; some down sometime to the church and some people thought he was crazy but he was one of the most sanctified Christians I had ever seen and known. Now he wasn't in this message that I know of but he was always quote &gt;&gt; add to your faith virtue. knowledge, all &gt;&gt; he would always and and he just throw his hand some like like he'd throw his hands up in the air like this like God is just pouring something in him. &gt;&gt; Wonderful man. And I was wondering whether he was still living or not, you know, but he was such an example &gt;&gt; because he would walk the street witnessing to people AND THE HOLY GHOST would hit him. He didn't care. &gt;&gt; And they knew him in college as a Christian. &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? He might have been a oddball, but he was a good oddball. &gt;&gt; And God ruled that man's life. &gt;&gt; Matthew 6. I wonder where he's at today, but he may be in glory already. &gt;&gt; Matthew 6:10, &gt;&gt; it says, "Thy kingdom come, &gt;&gt; thy will be done as it is in uh in earth as it is in heaven." &gt;&gt; Now I'm gonna say it. Thy kingdom come. So when the kingdom come, that's the Holy Ghost in you. That is the Holy Ghost in you. And the Holy Ghost in you in this earth is placed in you. So that the will of the heavenly is done in you because you on earth his will that means control. Hallelujah. EVERYTHING IS CONTROLLED. Everything is consumed. BY GOD'S WILL. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO BREAKING AWAY FROM IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OH, BUT LOOK WHAT JUST HAPPENED. Everything is moving by the power of God. HALLELUJAH. WHETHER IT BE GOOD OR EVIL, GOD IS STILL IN CONTROL. AND IF WE COULD GRASP THAT AND REALLY PLACE THAT WITHIN OUR HEART, THEN WE CAN SAY NO WEAPON FORMED AGAINST ME. AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, YOU WORK WITH THE SCRIPTURE, AMEN, THAT THE FOOTSTEPS OF A RIGHTEOUS MAN BY THE LORD. And every time we we hear that, we think that everything is going to run smoothly. lead you in the way and you're not going to have no stumbles and no falls, no trips. And when I look at the righteous men of the Old Testament, it was up and down. They were failures, but they knew how to get up. They knew how to cry out for mercy. They knew how to say, "Lord, forgive me." Now, come on, somebody. The Bible said that Abraham staggered not at the promises of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And and and we saw what he did IN THE OLD TESTAMENT. HALLELUJAH. But in the New Testament, there's no charge. You do nothing. And you being Abraham's seed, YOU GET THE SAME TREATMENT. HALLELUJAH. WITH ALL YOUR FAILURES, THERE WILL BE NO CHARGE AGAINST YOU. NOBODY CAN CHARGE YOU. THAT'S WHY PAUL SAID, "WHO SHALL LAY to God's elect? &gt;&gt; There's no charge." YEAH. The devil said, "You're bad." You're not bad. EVEN THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "EVEN CALLED OUR CHILDREN BAD CHILDREN IN THIS WORLD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And the blood keeps us all. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Luke 17:21. Listen, if you're not careful, &gt;&gt; the devil almost convinced you the rapture that took place and left and left you behind. Don't tell me the devil don't talk to you like that. Cuz he talks to me like that. AND I SAY, "YOU'RE A LIAR. I'M DEAR HERE." AND I know my God ain't going TO LEAVE ME BY. YOU GOT TO TALK TO THAT DEVIL like that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you don't know nothing about God, &gt;&gt; the one thing you need to know about him is that he's dwelling in you. &gt;&gt; Cuz he said in that day you'll know I'm in the Father. Father's in me and I in you. And as long as he's in you, the rapture had to take place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Luke 17. &gt;&gt; Luke 21. &gt;&gt; Neither shall they say, lo here or low there. For behold, the kingdom of God, wherein you thy KINGDOM COME, THY WILL BE DONE IN EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN. THIS IS YOUR FOCUS. YOUR FOCUS SHOULD BE LORD. YOUR KINGDOM HAS COME TO ME. LET YOUR WILL BE DONE IN THIS EARTH AS it is in heaven. WHATEVER the cost, &gt;&gt; your will be done. &gt;&gt; Right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Luke 12, please. 32. &gt;&gt; A lot of times people don't even realize why God be roadblocking them. Especially Especially if they don't have the Holy Ghost. God going to roadblock you. You know why? Because he wants you to put him first. He don't mind blessing you. But you got to put him first. But rather seek ye the kingdom of God. That's what it reads. &gt;&gt; All these things shall be added unto you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. You get the kingdom inside. YOU CAN ASK WHATEVER YOU WILL AND IT SHALL BE GIVEN to you. That's the Bible. FEAR NOT THE FLOCK. DON'T BE AFRAID, for it is your father's GOOD PLEASURE TO GIVE YOU THE KINGDOM. SO YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BEG FOR IT. If you REALLY KNOW IT'S YOURS, &gt;&gt; YOU GO GET IT like like the angel said. Here's the book. &gt;&gt; Come and TAKE IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; DON'T TAKE THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND AND WHEN YOU TAKE IT OUT, YOU EAT IT ALL UP. YOU INGEST IT. &gt;&gt; This book becomes you. &gt;&gt; YOU BECOME THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND THE STRENGTH OF THE BOOK IS NOW IN YOU. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, when the king is on the throne of your heart, &gt;&gt; he gives you inner strength. I have not yet seen a weak king, especially when he's sitting on his throne. There's something about that throne. Now, when do you overcome? &gt;&gt; You overcome when you receive the Holy Spirit. And he said it, if you overcome, I'll let you sit in my throne even as I have SAT IN MY FATHER'S THRONE. WITH IS IN YOUR HAND. GOD IS IN YOUR HAND. OR CAN I SAY IT IS IN YOUR MOUTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Cuz when Jesus CAME RIDING ON a horse, &gt;&gt; he was the scroll. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. CAME OUT OF HIS MOUTH. HALLELUJAH. WAS THE POWER AND THE STRENGTH TO DESTROY THE ENEMY. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AND RECOGNIZE THIS. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE BODY OF CHRIST. DO YOU HEAR what I'm saying? IF YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH, DON'T SPEAK IT IN VAIN. IT HAS TO. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. WHY? BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT RESTING. GOD was defeated. [Music] New hope of glory. Hallelujah. First John 4 and four. First John 4 and four. &gt;&gt; How many of y'all believe this? Amen. &gt;&gt; If you really believe that you're a true child of God, &gt;&gt; sometimes you just got to meditate on it and in your mind think within yourself how I DON'T KNOW, BUT HE SAYS it &gt;&gt; and therefore I'm going to act upon it. I'M GOING TO BELIEVE IT. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. First John 4. Ye are of God, little children. Now, did you hear what he said? Ye are of God. He didn't say ye are of the devil. He say of little children and having overcome them because what greater in you &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; You know, I worked AT ONE TIME. GREATER IS HE. WHO IS HE? &gt;&gt; GOD HIMSELF HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. CHRIST HIMSELF. THE REAL HOLY GHOST. THE ONLY HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; Y'ALL HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING? THE ONE WHO CREATED EVERYTHING. HOW CAN HE THAT IS SO GREAT DEFEATED BY HIS CREATION? IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. THE DEVIL COULD NEVER HAVE POWERS ENOUGH DESTROY. &gt;&gt; THE BATTLE HAS ALREADY BEEN FOUGHT, BROTHERS. I LOVE IT. JESUS WENT DOWN TO HIS TERRITORY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YEAH. He whipped HIM ON THIS SIDE OF EARTH, TOO. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE DEMONS WERE SCREAMING WHEN JESUS WAS WALKING AROUND. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD DEFEATED HIM. BUT ALL HE DID WAS GO DOWN TO HELL AND SHOW THE DEVIL who's the real boss. He went DOWN THERE. HE TOOK THE KEYS OFF THE GRAVE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I LOVE THE WAY BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID IT. THE KEYS OFF HIS SIDE the door in his face. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE GOD THAT'S IN YOU. &gt;&gt; DON'T LET THE DEVIL KICK YOU AROUND. Kicking him around. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Coming from a quote, &gt;&gt; fellowship with God through reconciliation, 1958, January 20. He said, "Fellowship. God wants to fellowship with man always wanted to do it. The Old Testament, all of it was full of of the shed blood. And without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sin. Where there's no remission of sin, there is no fellowship. You got to get away from sin before you can ever have fellowship with God. Now, he ain't talking about drinking and smoking and all that kind of stuff. He talking about unbelief. Sin is unbelief. Hallelujah. You got to get away from sin before you can ever have fellowship with God. Because God can't fellowship with sin. So you're born a sinner, saved in iniquity. Come to the world speaking live. &gt;&gt; And how can you ever do it? &gt;&gt; You just might as well quit right now to begin with. You can't do it within yourself. But there is one God to bring you to FELLOWSHIP BACK. Not only to fellowship, RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD, TO MAKE YOU SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD FOR FOR THAT PURPOSE. HE DIED FOR THAT PURPOSE. NOT ONLY JUST FELLOWSHIP, BUT RELATIONSHIP, RIGHT? COME HERE, PROVE HIMSELF EMMANUEL, OMNIPOTENT. &gt;&gt; I LOVE THAT WORD OMNIPOTENT. ALL POWERFUL. ALL POWERFUL. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; EMMANUEL, &gt;&gt; GOD WITH US, &gt;&gt; OMNIPOTENT, ALL POWERFUL. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And when omnipotence speaks, &gt;&gt; THE MIRACULOUS HAPPENS. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE WORD GOD SPOKEN? HALLELUJAH. LET ANY MAN OR WOMAN, ANY promise of God, WHEN A SPEAKS FROM THE BIBLE, WILL TAKE place seed set root in the heart of a man or woman. [Music] IT'LL PRODUCE JUST EXACTLY WHAT THE PROMISE IS because it's the word of the omnipotent. He said it has to hallelujah. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO BELIEVE IT. IF GOD SAID WITH YOUR HIS STRIPES YOU HEAL, going to give you pain. HE GOING TO BRING SOMETHING. BUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? Believe the devil's lie. I BELIEVE WHAT GOD SAID ALREADY. &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BEN TAKES IT ALL THE WAY BACK TO 200,000 YEARS AGO. 4,000. HOWEVER YOU WANT TO PUT IT. THE LAND WAS SLAIN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. The Bible said &gt;&gt; he was bruised for our iniquity. The chastisement of our peace was upon him THAT WITH HIS STRIPES WE WERE HEALED. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Well, I believe it so much that one day I'm going to change from mortal to immortality immortality. I'm going to put on my my imort immortal body. MY HEALING DON'T STOP HERE. &gt;&gt; HE'S HEALED MY SOUL. SO I KNOW HE CAN HEAL MY BODY. HEAL MY SPIRIT. SO I KNOW HE CAN HEAL MY BODY. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Now he's working on my mind, too. &gt;&gt; I'm trading that one in. I take his mind and he can have the Lord. Second Samuel, please. &gt;&gt; Samuel having that strength. And let me tell you like this. If you don't read your Bible and if you don't listen to these messages, you're going to be weak. &gt;&gt; That's your food. &gt;&gt; That's the vitamins that God sent down here for you. &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? And I don't mean hearing it with your head, hearing it with your heart, receiving it in your soul, thinking about what is said and applying it to yourself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Second Samuel 22 &gt;&gt; beginning at the 33rd verse &gt;&gt; down to the 43rd. &gt;&gt; God is my strength and power. And he maketh my way perfect. &gt;&gt; God is my strength and my power. And he maketh my way perfect. Make my way perfect. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How do you think Job was considered perfect? &gt;&gt; It was only by the sacrifice he made. the lamb that he that he made the the altar. That's what made him perfect and he constantly did it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God wouldn't have been able to really talk to Adam and Eve and have fellowship with them had not slain that lamb. The lamb, &gt;&gt; the blood of the lamb &gt;&gt; is what bridged that breach temporarily. &gt;&gt; The blood OF JESUS CHRIST IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT BR YOU KNOW BINDS a bridge, A PLACE OF FELLOWSHIP, A PLACE OF RELATIONSHIP. HALLELUJAH. Y'all hear what I'm saying? Even Paul said, you can understand all mystery. And this is what my head. You got people say, "Oh, HE AIN'T DEEP ENOUGH." BUT LET me say it like this. ARE YOU WALKING IN the light as he is IN THE LIGHT? HALLELUJAH. YOU UNDERSTAND ME? WHAT IS THE LIGHT OF GOD? IT'S A REVELATION THAT GOD GIVES YOU to walk in. HALLELUJAH. WHAT IS THE REVELATION HE GAVE YOU? GOD SHALL MAKE HERSELF READY. NOTHING ELSE. GOD MAKES HERSELF. THIS IS A WEDDING SITUATION. HALLELUJAH. IT AIN'T ABOUT JOBS AND ALL THIS OTHER KIND OF STUFF. EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW WE HAVE TO DO IT, BUT YOUR WHOLE FOCUS SHOULD BE MAKING YOURSELF READY. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And with all these mysteries, if we don't have love for nothing, nothing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And don't tell me love ain't being tested. &gt;&gt; Mine is. I'm just letting I'm just being honest, &gt;&gt; right? If a person is the enemy, it doesn't bother you. &gt;&gt; But it's always somebody that you love. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's what brings the firemen, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Let's move on. He maketh my feet like hind's feet and sitteth me upon my high places. Have you ever seen goats or deers in high places and you wonder how on earth did they get the rocks and the cliffs and all this thing? And they walk on them like it just to them it is because OF THE WAY THE FEET ARE MADE. Hind's feet. Hallelujah. And the Bible said he maketh my feet like hind feet. That means you can climb up high. You can reach those levels. I don't care where the storm the the the the the BOULDERS ARE. HAVE YOU EVER seen it? THEY THEY'LL LEAP RIGHT UP THERE AND YOU'LL never see THEM TUMBLE LIKE THAT. jump on that and catch it and move on to the next. &gt;&gt; He teaches my hands to walk. &gt;&gt; That means you don't know how to &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And why is he teaching you? &gt;&gt; Because they're going to be war. Amen. &gt;&gt; THE POINT IS, &gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T COME HERE FOR a picnic. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You came to prove &gt;&gt; that you're not from Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; WE ARE COME FROM GOD. WE GO BACK TO GOD. HOW THE WORLD is being shaped. GOD IS SHAPING A BRIDE. REMEMBER, YOU'RE NOT THE WORLD. CONTRAST. HALLELUJAH. WE'RE RIGHTEOUSNESS. WE ARE UNRIGHTEOUS. UNHOLY. YOU UNDERSTAND ME? THERE MUST BE A CONTRAST, NOT THE SAME. BUT WE MUST BE DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT GOD is teaching us. Teaching us how to what? War. He teaches my hand to war. Hallelujah. Fifth 35th verse. &gt;&gt; He teaches my hand to war. So that a bow of steel is broken by thine arm. Hallelujah. Thou hast also given me the shield of salvation. Thy gentleness have made and thy gentleness have made me great. &gt;&gt; Shield of salvation. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's you look at it, you're like no, it it means that you are protected by the revelation of your salvation and no errors CAN PENETRATE. NOTHING CAN DESTROY IT. THAT'S WHAT I'M talking about. That rest. Hallelujah. IT'S UNEXPLAINABLE &gt;&gt; because you don't even know HOW IT GOT THERE. WHERE DID GOD GIVE ME THAT REVELATION? And how come he gave it to me? &gt;&gt; I HAVE FAULTS LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. BUT THERE'S A REST IN meal &gt;&gt; and it's a peace. &gt;&gt; No matter what I go through, the devil can't take that from me. &gt;&gt; Like I told somebody, the only only person that could ever tell me that I'm not bride is Jesus himself. &gt;&gt; And he ain't going to tell me that cuz he's the one that told me that I was. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thou hast also given me the shield of my thy salvation &gt;&gt; and thy gentleness. 26. &gt;&gt; Thou has enlarged my steps under me. &gt;&gt; So that my feet did not slip. Hallelujah. That's another thing. As we grow in grace, the place we used to stumble, we don't stumble. But that's growth that don't happen overnight. I wish for years BEFORE I got an answer. [Music] &gt;&gt; But the next thing I know, it's gone. And he didn't even knock on my door like the UPS or whoever. It was gone. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Somebody know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I love this part preached this one time on the army of of David. He said, "I have pursued my enemy &gt;&gt; and destroyed them &gt;&gt; and turned not again until I had consumed them." Y'all hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you praying, you don't turn around. Oh, God didn't hear me [Music] whether I fell or whether I feel it or not. I will keep cons going after that enemy until he is completely done away with. HALLELUJAH. I'M NOT GOING TO TELL. IS THAT RIGHT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; We must come to a place as a bride of Jesus Christ where Satan &gt;&gt; and his temptation will know not know what to do with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HE GOING TO THROW EVERYTHING at us. It won't bother us. &gt;&gt; Y'all hear me? I DIDN'T QUOTE THAT VERBATIM, BUT that's what brother said. WE WILL come to a place where Satan won't have he won't have no nothing. HE WON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH US. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HIS WAY OF TEMPTING US WILL NO LONGER PREVAIL. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHAT I'M PRESSING TOWARD. YOU SAY, "ARE YOU THERE YET?" NO. I'M ON MY WAY. I'M ON MY WAY. &gt;&gt; I'M ON MY WAY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; NO. You said, "Well, wait, brother. Let me tell y'all something. &gt;&gt; I know there's a growth in me. &gt;&gt; It's the growth of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Right. More strength, brother, more power, &gt;&gt; more authority. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that I see in myself. &gt;&gt; But thou has girdled me with the strength of battle, &gt;&gt; them that rouse up against me, has thou subdued under my under feet. &gt;&gt; Thou has also given me the neck of my enemy, that I might destroy them that hate me. &gt;&gt; Are y'all taking this down? misly understanding &gt;&gt; that no matter what your enemy is, no matter what they are, &gt;&gt; you are victorious. &gt;&gt; No matter what demon come your way, God has given you the victory and you just got TO GO TAKE IT. I GOT TO GO TAKE. YES, YOU GOT TO FIGHT FOR IT. Everybody's fighting. Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to fight. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Then I did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 45th 30. Yeah. I did stamp them as the M of the street [Music] and then spread them abroad. I that's that's some beat. That's a whooping. Amen. I stopped them till they became D. &gt;&gt; David didn't play. You love the Lord. And and this is you know we read these things and it seemed LIKE SOME DRAMA BUT NO GOD IS ENCOURAGING YOU what the strength in you is capable of doing. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT PEOPLE DECLARE they they are. They can't overcome you &gt;&gt; because of the king that's in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; 1 Chronicles. I'm almost done. &gt;&gt; 16. I'm trying to give you a word of encouragement. People, all of us are fighting, &gt;&gt; but you got to have something to work with. The first attack is on you in your mind. As I spoke a couple of weeks ago, the first thing the devil tried to get you to do is reason. Then he attacks your worthiness. You're not even worthy. See, he he's always against the word because he's right and he's wrong. I'm not worthy. But he made me worthy. I take what he says, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Seek the Lord and his strength. &gt;&gt; Seek his face continually. &gt;&gt; Remember his marvelous works that he has done, his wonders, &gt;&gt; and the judgments of his mouth. Have not God been good to you? &gt;&gt; Every one of us have testimonies in it &gt;&gt; of what God has done. &gt;&gt; Think about those things cuz even when he was good to you, you never was worthy of it. &gt;&gt; I I can say that for myself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh ye seed of Israel, his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen one. Amen. &gt;&gt; It ain't good enough to hear the preacher say you're chosen. &gt;&gt; If you don't believe, let the devil know I'm chosen. I'm I'm the real chosen one. &gt;&gt; I don't know what they talking about on television, but I'm the real thing. You got TO LET HIM KNOW. I KNOW Y'ALL THINK, BUT I TALK TO THE DEVIL LIKE THAT. &gt;&gt; I do. &gt;&gt; That's right. He talks to me and I'mma tell him to &gt;&gt; especially when he don't get away like I told him tell him to do. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Listen what brother saying. I'm &gt;&gt; I think I'll close on this. This is from Patmas vision. You heard this. What I'm trying to say people, if you got the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; let use him. &gt;&gt; Or better yet, let him use you. &gt;&gt; You say you got it. &gt;&gt; Let him use you. &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed of what you possess. &gt;&gt; Let him use you. This is what we're here for. If anybody going to see Jesus or Christ, they're going to see him through you. &gt;&gt; We got millions of church people, but we don't have millions of anointed ones, truly anointed by the Holy Spirit. That's not ashamed of what they believe. &gt;&gt; Right. Okay. The Pat vision paragraph 215. What happens when two omnipotence meet? &gt;&gt; When God and man's come together, two, &gt;&gt; something's got to shake. Whatsoever you say with that creative power of of omnipotent power of God knowing that he promised it &gt;&gt; and he said it in his word. It creates a power out yonder bring things things to pass things that is not it makes &gt;&gt; them as though they are because two omnipotent have met there he stands oh isn't he wonderful &gt;&gt; let me tell y'all something brother could have went out there and said Listen, I want three squirrels today and he wouldn't have gotten nothing. &gt;&gt; But omnipotent told him omnipotent spoke to him and said, "How many?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Somebody says the other day uh when I was in Iowa City, &gt;&gt; I testified about how the Lord blessed me. &gt;&gt; That would have been my second house. how God cleared the records for me. And one brother who had just talked to his wife about my testimony, not saying who the brother was. And then I come down there and I'm testifying what he just testified to his wife about. And then he says to me after service, "My wife and I want a new house." I said, "Well, God spoke to you. &gt;&gt; Go get it." &gt;&gt; I don't understand it. &gt;&gt; Cuz God can speak through a man from the book, giving you your answer, and you let the devil reason it away. All things are possible &gt;&gt; to them that believe. &gt;&gt; And just like I told him, I told my wife or somebody I was talking to when it comes to taxes. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Go fish." &gt;&gt; And we know these things happen. One situation happened. &gt;&gt; Even in in in in Guyana, &gt;&gt; man didn't want his wife to go to church. He threw her keys in in in the river or whatever it was. She went fishing or he went fishing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And the first fish he caught he brought it she got the fish and there was the keys and he said he WAS TRYING GOD. DID YOU KNOW THAT MAN was converted because he came to find out that God is real? &gt;&gt; When two omnipotent and you ARE you are BECAUSE THE WORD SAYS YOU ARE. BUT YOU GOT TO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; Come on somebody. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. Here was Peter. &gt;&gt; Was he a failure? &gt;&gt; He cursed. &gt;&gt; He didn't. I'm not one of them. &gt;&gt; I don't know him. But it wasn't about whether Peter knew him. He knew Peter. They said, "Yeah, &gt;&gt; YOU YOU CAN'T DO YOU can't you can't strip election away. When God has elected YOU TO BE BRIDE, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH, IT DOESN'T LICENSE US TO SIN. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN WE DO, &gt;&gt; HE JUSTIFIES US." OH, &gt;&gt; it's the truth. Wasn't that Peter at the gate and said silver such as I have rise up &gt;&gt; too omnipotence. &gt;&gt; Okay, let me read this last scripture now. 1 Chronicles 29. 1 Chronicles 29:12-14. both riches and honors comes of thee, &gt;&gt; and thou reignth over all, &gt;&gt; and in thy hand is power and might, and in thy hand it is to make great strength unto all. Let me tell y'all something. When y'all, I'm g tell you how to how it works. Now, whether God it it's all according to his plan too. &gt;&gt; But first of all, can I illustrate it like this? &gt;&gt; Your husband coming home, been on a long trip and you come to you come to the door with a rag around your head and your cleaning clothes. He opened the door. There's no fragrance coming through, &gt;&gt; no food prepared. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you want HIM TO SAY, &gt;&gt; "OH, HONEY, &gt;&gt; I missed you." &gt;&gt; No. Nm. &gt;&gt; He's disappointed because he's been gone &gt;&gt; and he wants a real homecoming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me tell you something, sisters. You got that food ready right there. So when he comes through the door, he smells it before he gets in there. Dressed in a nice something. You don't have to be like you're going to a party dress. And for those of you that wear a little cologne, put it I'm telling y'all something. &gt;&gt; Better listen to I'm I'm a man. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THE ATMOSPHERE. &gt;&gt; ATMOSPHERE. &gt;&gt; You can almost say, "Honey, &gt;&gt; since you've been gone, I realize I need something." He gonna pull it. He gonna give it. I'm telling you the way a man thinks, you better listen to me. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; It's the protocol. &gt;&gt; When you want something for God, you don't you don't come to the husband and say, "Listen, since you've been gone, this broke, that broke THIS REPAIR. NO, NO, &gt;&gt; you mention none of that at FIRST &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU WANT YOUR FELLOWSHIP WITH HIM TO BE SWEET. That's how it is IN PRAYER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. YOU PUT SOME LOVING ON THAT MAN. SAY, "HONEY, you don't know how much I MISS YOU. I THOUGHT ABOUT you all day, every day." &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. Y'all think I'm playing. I'm serious. &gt;&gt; I'm real. I'm real. &gt;&gt; Right. That's how you talk with Jesus. &gt;&gt; When you want something from him, &gt;&gt; love him. Love on him. &gt;&gt; Worship him. Worship him. Hallelujah. You say it ain't scripture. It is scripture. Even when it come to Esther, she put ON THE GARMENTS. HE BOUGHT HER. THAT special garment and you think he didn't notice it. That's what you do. You talk to Jesus, tell him how much you love him and really mean it and oh Lord, and then you hear him say, &gt;&gt; "Is there something that you need?" &gt;&gt; You say, "That ain't scripture." It's scripture. &gt;&gt; When that woman came to Simon's house, she pulled that alabaster box all on his feet. &gt;&gt; She started crying. DIDN'T SAY A WORD. He knew what you He's the same yesterday. WORSHIP HIM. DON'T BRING YOUR HONEYDEW LIST FIRST. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And then you done worship him. You you've gotten the Holy Spirit and and you could ask whatever you will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HAD IT RIGHT. SAID THAT AIN'T NOTHING BUT the truth. &gt;&gt; SHE WAS ALREADY IN THE atmosphere &gt;&gt; and God dropped it. He's the same yesterday, today, and we just don't know how to approach it. Say, Lord, teach me how to approach it. Teach me how the things that you like for me to do and like for me to say. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You love the Lord. Okay, let me finish this. 1 Chronicles 29 12 14. &gt;&gt; But riches and honor comes of thee. And thou reignth over all, and in thy hand is power and might, and in thy hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all. I want my portion. Now therefore, our God, we thank thee and praise thy glorious name. But who am I? And what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly after this? &gt;&gt; This is it. &gt;&gt; For all things come of thee, and of thine own have WE GIVEN THEE. &gt;&gt; I DON'T HAVE NOTHING. MY PRAISE IS YOURS. EVERYTHING I GOT. HALLELUJAH. YOU GAVE ME AND I'M GIVING IT BACK TO YOU, LORD. I DON'T EVEN KNOW. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HOW is this? &gt;&gt; HOW IS THIS? EVERY AND EVERYTHING I OFFER IS what you've given me. &gt;&gt; That's right. It's yours. &gt;&gt; But I give it back to you. You gave me these testimony. That's why I try to tell people give your testimony. When we had that testimony service, y'all have no idea what that did for me. Hallelujah. I was just in a state of mind. Lord, I'm working hard. I'm doing all I can do, Lord, for you. WE HAVE GOOD SERVICES, BUT I DON'T SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, we had a testimony service and different ones were telling the miraculous that God had done. It lift me up. It made me see that the labor is not in vain. &gt;&gt; Not the glor. IT AIN'T GLORIFYING ME. IT'S GLORIFYING the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll just stop there. &gt;&gt; Let us stand. [Applause] Just got to praise him. &gt;&gt; The devil say you you you hypocrite. Call me what you want, but this hypocrite going to praise him. That's all I got to say. Whatever you want to say about me, devil, that's okay. But I know what he given me, and I'm gonna give it back to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me tell you something. Y'all, some of y'all don't want to dance. You don't know how good it is to have two feet to dance. &gt;&gt; You don't want to clap your hands. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the man who ain't got no hands. We got so much to thank him for. Hallelujah. One thing I know about the Lord, if you're not ashamed of him, he will not be ashamed of you. &gt;&gt; And he will bless you even when you don't ask him to. You love the Lord. Let that inner strength of the Holy Ghost flow through you. Let it be your prayer, Lord. Let this inner man reflect itself to the out that that not only do pe can he said let your light so shine that men may see your light and glorify the father which is in heaven. That's what we're here for. Let's pray. Father God, we come before you as humbly as we know how. &gt;&gt; We thank you for your grace. We thank you for your mercy, Lord. We just thank you for all that you everything that you have. There's nothing that I can claim. I'm no creator, Lord God, outside of what you have given me. But I pray, Lord God, that you give us the grace and the mercy to allow your Holy Spirit to consume us to rule over our lives. We want you to be Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us now. &gt;&gt; Father, look beyond our faults &gt;&gt; and see our needs tonight. We give you praise. We give you the glory. We give you the honor. Every one of us in here have fallen short of the glory of God. And without your mercy and grace, we would be all hell bound. But thank you Jesus for just being so real to us, allowing us to see and understand what our mission is in this world. Bless us now. Help us achieve what you have have set in order for us. We'll be careful to give you the praise, glory, and honor. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. [Music] Amen. Let's sing this song. It's already done. [Music] It's already done.
