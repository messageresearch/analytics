[34:04] surely God is good to us
[34:09] God has been inspiring me uh
[34:13] through the songs and
[34:16] everything
[34:19] I don't know whether
[34:21] or not our precious brother
[34:24] Samuel knew where I was going
[34:28] one of the scriptures that I'm going to
[34:30] read
[34:31] is Isaiah 54.
[34:38] and we'll read the
[34:44] I think I got that right
[34:50] 17th verse
[34:56] and from there we'll ask that you turn
[34:58] with us to
[35:01] Exodus 15.
[35:05] Isaiah 54
[35:09] 17.
[35:10] no weapon that is formed against thee
[35:14] shall prosper
[35:16] and every tongue shall rise against thee
[35:20] in judgment Thou shalt condemn
[35:24] this is the heritage
[35:28] you remember I touched on the Heritage
[35:31] the other day
[35:32] this is the heritage of the Servants of
[35:35] the Lord
[35:36] and their righteousness is of me
[35:40] says the Lord
[35:43] should I read that one again
[35:46] no weapon that is formed against thee
[35:49] shall prosper
[35:50] and every tongue that shall rise against
[35:53] thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn
[35:56] this is the heritage
[36:00] of the Servants of the Lord
[36:03] and their righteousness is of me saith
[36:07] the Lord
[36:09] let us go to Exodus 15.
[36:23] Exodus 15.
[36:26] we're going to read from the first to
[36:29] the 12th verse
[36:36] are you there
[36:39] then saying Moses and the children of
[36:42] Israel this song unto the Lord
[36:46] and spake saying saying I was seeing
[36:49] unto the Lord
[36:51] for he hath triumphed gloriously
[36:55] the horse and his rider has he thrown
[36:59] into the sea amen the Lord is my
[37:02] strength and song
[37:04] he has become my salvation now watch
[37:09] what he says what Moses says under this
[37:11] inspiration
[37:12] he is my God and I will prepare him and
[37:17] habitation
[37:19] I'ma say that again
[37:22] he is my God and I will prepare him in
[37:26] habitation
[37:27] my father's God and I will exalt him
[37:33] now
[37:34] in just a few words so much was said
[37:37] there
[37:39] basically Moses is saying I am going to
[37:42] prepare him a habitation and you got to
[37:45] understand he's not talking about a
[37:46] house
[37:47] all right he's talking about himself
[37:51] and he's exalting not only a God but his
[37:54] father's God meaning that there is no
[37:57] change
[37:59] the same God his father's served he's
[38:03] serving
[38:04] this is why Hebrews 13 and 8 says he's
[38:07] the same yesterday today and forever
[38:09] we're not serving a different God we're
[38:13] serving the same God
[38:15] and I will exalt him
[38:18] the Lord is a man of war
[38:22] the Lord is his name
[38:25] remember that every time you go through
[38:28] a battle remember the Lord
[38:31] is a man of war
[38:35] Hallelujah
[38:37] Pharaoh chariots
[38:42] and his host
[38:44] has he cast into the sea
[38:46] his chosen captains also drowned in the
[38:50] Red Sea
[38:51] The Depths have covered them they sank
[38:55] into the bottom as a stone
[38:58] the right thy right hand O Lord has
[39:01] become glorious in power thy right hand
[39:04] O Lord have dashed in pieces the enemy I
[39:08] want you to take inventory because he's
[39:10] he's literally going through something
[39:12] here so that you your heart and mind
[39:15] could be impressed he's exalting God
[39:19] and he wants you to understand what God
[39:21] is capable of doing not only what he's
[39:23] capable of doing but what he's already
[39:24] done
[39:27] The Depths have covered them they sank
[39:30] it to the bottom as a stone thy right
[39:33] hand O Lord It's become glorious in
[39:36] power thy right hand O Lord have dashed
[39:40] in pieces the enemy let me ask you
[39:43] something what is the right hand of God
[39:45] who is the right hand of God okay
[39:48] Christ was always there
[39:50] called the right hand of God
[39:52] and in the greatness of thine ecclesi
[39:55] thou has overthrown them that rose up
[39:59] against thee
[40:00] thou sent it forth thy wrath which
[40:03] consumed them as stubble
[40:06] and with the blast of thy nostrils the
[40:08] waters were gathered together at the
[40:11] flood stood upright as a heap and the
[40:14] depths were congealed in the heart of
[40:17] the sea
[40:19] the enemy said I will pursue
[40:22] now what he's saying is
[40:25] whatever God did he dried up the mud
[40:31] they were not walking through mud
[40:34] it congealed
[40:36] it became solid
[40:39] and they walked across on dry land
[40:42] that's the word
[40:44] the enemy said I will pursue I will
[40:46] overtake I will divide the spoil now
[40:50] listen the enemy is boasting against God
[40:54] when it comes to your life he's boasting
[40:56] against God
[40:58] he may have you in a disarray right
[41:02] sometimes you know we we get to a state
[41:04] of confusion
[41:06] but never despair amen that's right we
[41:09] always have hope
[41:11] and faith is always there for us
[41:14] my lust shall be satisfied upon them I
[41:19] will I will draw
[41:21] my sword my hand shall destroy them
[41:26] doubt it blow with thy wind the sea
[41:29] covered them they sank as the lead as
[41:32] the lead in The Mighty Waters
[41:34] who is likened to thee O Lord now he's
[41:38] telling the story and he's telling us
[41:40] he's now he comes to the point says who
[41:42] is liking in other words who can
[41:44] challenge you
[41:46] who can defeat you
[41:51] oh Lord
[41:53] amongst the gods
[41:56] who like thee
[41:58] who is like thee glorious in Holiness
[42:01] fearful in Praises doing wonders
[42:05] thou stretched out thy right hand
[42:09] the Earth swallowed them
[42:12] now
[42:14] let us pray
[42:16] father God we come before you Lord as
[42:19] humbly as we know how we thank you for
[42:21] your grace and your mercy we thank you
[42:24] for being so good to us
[42:27] surely there is no God Like You Lord
[42:31] and I love you Lord
[42:34] and I thank you for the victory
[42:36] in your name Jesus Christ we pray
[42:39] amen you may be seated
[42:48] I entitled this message it's worth the
[42:52] fight
[42:53] I know that sounds so
[42:57] you know but
[42:59] it's simple
[43:01] but yet it's powerful it fits for this
[43:05] moment
[43:07] I was thinking about how God
[43:11] is doing a great thing
[43:15] and in in all of this battling that
[43:18] Moses had going through a prophecy come
[43:20] out our word of Prophecy I would prepare
[43:23] him a tabernacle
[43:27] see because in that day God was with
[43:30] them
[43:31] but in this this this this this day God
[43:35] is in US
[43:37] so the Tabernacle is being prepared
[43:41] right now
[43:43] and you and I must understand what we're
[43:46] being prepared for
[43:49] we're being prepared for war
[43:53] and God Amen knows exactly what he's
[43:57] doing
[43:59] he knows by God's grace that he has
[44:02] chosen the people
[44:03] that won't turn back amen
[44:06] amen no matter what
[44:08] you see the the test of the Bride has
[44:11] not yet come
[44:13] we think that these little things that
[44:15] we're going through is tough
[44:17] but the greatest of tests
[44:20] will soon be presented to us
[44:24] and when it comes
[44:26] you will have to make a decision
[44:29] amen whether God is still God
[44:33] and listen when it comes to the battle
[44:37] Satan always look like he has the upper
[44:41] hand
[44:44] God always use the few
[44:49] we're Satan uses majority
[44:53] but one man in his hand
[44:56] could put a thousand to flight
[44:59] and so you and I must understand that
[45:02] this whole thing
[45:04] is getting ready to uh uh cap itself
[45:09] come to the crooks of the the point
[45:16] [Applause]
[45:18] the point I believe yes sir
[45:21] it's worth the battle
[45:24] I don't care what you say
[45:27] there's nothing in this world worth
[45:29] going to hell for
[45:36] I'm Not Afraid in that way
[45:39] like I said you know I was serving God
[45:42] is to be out of reverence and love
[45:46] never because we are afraid to go to
[45:49] hell or afraid to miss the Rapture and
[45:52] those kind of things that only come to
[45:54] your mind when you don't have a true
[45:56] revelation of election
[45:59] predestination that has not been
[46:02] revealed to you yet on who you are
[46:05] but when you come to know who you are
[46:08] it brings a peace
[46:11] it brings a satisfaction
[46:14] and it takes away the fear of all
[46:17] Satan's Army
[46:19] no matter how great they may seem to be
[46:23] never in the history
[46:26] of Egypt
[46:28] they had ever been defeated
[46:31] listen Egypt I read up on it they were a
[46:35] nation a a Empire amen for almost 2 000
[46:39] years
[46:41] listen we've just been here for a few
[46:43] hundred
[46:45] but this was a nation that ruled the
[46:48] world
[46:50] and God took a man
[46:54] one man
[46:56] who was able to obey
[46:59] a man who understood the instructions of
[47:03] God
[47:04] and was not afraid
[47:07] he did have a moment
[47:10] when the enemy came in as the scripture
[47:13] says like a flood God lifted up a
[47:17] standard
[47:19] not the waters that was in the standard
[47:22] the standard was God in Moses
[47:30] and God said God slow Moses
[47:33] speak listen
[47:37] for you need to know today your enemies
[47:40] are going to be destroyed
[47:41] amen coming from
[47:48] the word of God
[47:51] we found out that there was such a
[47:54] a Dramatical thing that happened in the
[47:57] days of Moses till the world could never
[47:59] forget it
[48:01] I remember when I went to Egypt
[48:04] and they said they didn't even have a
[48:06] record that Moses ever existed
[48:10] I wanted to say but we've got evidence
[48:15] because of where you are today
[48:18] you are literally the the suffering the
[48:21] effects
[48:23] of what God did with Moses
[48:26] yeah we know that he was taking off the
[48:28] books
[48:30] they tried to silence him
[48:32] but they could not
[48:34] because God wrote about him
[48:37] a word that's eternal
[48:40] and even now the whole world hate this
[48:44] book called The Bible
[48:46] because they hate truth and they love
[48:48] lies
[48:50] but the Bible is the truth
[48:52] and the truth will always stand
[48:56] Hallelujah
[48:57] is that right it's worth the fight
[49:01] Moses had to go through a lot of
[49:03] training
[49:04] before God could take him to Egypt
[49:08] God had to beat all the world out of him
[49:11] Hallelujah don't get mad with God you
[49:15] say I want to be just like him he's got
[49:18] to beat all of the world out of you and
[49:20] how does he do that how does he how does
[49:23] that come by about it comes by trials
[49:27] fiery trials
[49:29] but the Bible said don't you know that
[49:32] the trying of your faith is more
[49:34] precious than gold
[49:37] tried in the fire
[49:40] you'll come out like gold
[49:42] you hold fast
[49:44] it was given see the thing about it is
[49:48] we fail to see God said to Moses and
[49:52] Joshua I've given you the land
[49:55] go take it
[49:58] see what we say oh God what do you
[50:01] understand what I'm saying it's your
[50:04] inheritance
[50:05] yeah amen it's your heritage
[50:09] that's yours he left it for you
[50:16] amen you say well I will I have that
[50:18] glorified body that's my heritage
[50:21] I have inherited it
[50:24] Hallelujah but I've got to fight for it
[50:28] it's not just going to drop in your lap
[50:31] that's not the way of God
[50:34] he's a man of what war
[50:38] and when everything is going so sweet
[50:41] it's so peaceful peacefully in your life
[50:44] know that something's wrong
[50:47] right because you must fight every day
[50:50] the Bible said put on the whole of God
[50:55] right that's meaning clothed in the word
[50:58] every day if you fail to do that you
[51:01] leaving Satan with a Target
[51:04] and he's going to take every bit of that
[51:07] Target he can and more like they say if
[51:09] you give him an inch he'll take a mile
[51:12] Hallelujah let's read this quote because
[51:15] we got to understand that here God was
[51:18] doing a mighty thing for for Moses
[51:21] thought for him you know you think about
[51:24] it all Israel for 400 years had not seen
[51:26] the move of God
[51:28] and here come a man and God is moving in
[51:30] him
[51:31] not just moving in him but the pillar
[51:33] fire is following him
[51:35] I mean they've never seen anybody like
[51:37] Moses before it makes you wonder how
[51:39] could people
[51:40] not believe
[51:43] but that's the same thing that's
[51:45] happening all day
[51:48] they can't believe it because they don't
[51:49] have nothing on the inside to believe
[51:52] with
[51:53] this is why you ought to glorify God
[51:56] this is why you ought to praise God
[51:58] because God has given you eyes to see
[52:01] ears to hear and are hard to believe it
[52:05] you were not
[52:07] but you believe it
[52:09] if I can't believe Malachi 4 how can I
[52:12] believe Exodus 15. amen
[52:17] true but I believe it there's something
[52:20] on the inside of me yeah believe it and
[52:24] what God did for Moses
[52:26] if necessary
[52:28] he can do it for me amen
[52:32] but everybody think it's going to come
[52:33] easy no it doesn't come easy
[52:37] and God listen this
[52:40] all those millions of people
[52:44] think about it
[52:46] they allow Satan to dupe them in the
[52:49] journey
[52:50] trick them in the dirt Journey
[52:54] they were following a prophet they were
[52:56] following God
[52:58] and a man
[53:01] and yet they thought they could give
[53:03] their own ideas
[53:05] to how it should be done
[53:07] you've never seen a sheep
[53:10] leading a shepherd
[53:13] is always the shepherd leading the Sheep
[53:16] but it was always these people trying to
[53:19] lead Moses and trying to tell Moses what
[53:23] to do
[53:24] but Moses wasn't confused
[53:27] he knew who his Shepherd was
[53:30] like we know
[53:31] who Our Shepherd is
[53:34] but Joshua was learning
[53:38] he learned a great deal
[53:41] he saw God in a man
[53:45] defeat the greatest nation on Earth
[53:49] publicized it so much so it reached
[53:52] Jericho
[53:53] and all the other you know I don't they
[53:55] didn't have television like we but by
[53:58] Word of Mouth
[54:00] it went all over the world what God had
[54:03] done for his people
[54:06] it brought fear on the world yeah
[54:09] I'm saying it brought fear on the word
[54:12] and when Malachi 4 was here it brought
[54:16] fear
[54:19] yes
[54:21] yes right now
[54:23] the bride is supposed to have a life
[54:26] that would cause fear
[54:28] upon all the unbelievers
[54:31] they're supposed to be God is supposed
[54:34] to be seen in US
[54:36] not just heard with words it's supposed
[54:39] to be seen by a manifestation of him we
[54:43] are the Tabernacle
[54:48] but if we're not careful
[54:50] we'll think of our blessings
[54:54] assures us of the Promised Land
[54:58] but look what God did for all those
[55:00] people
[55:01] he fed them even in the complaints
[55:05] he gave them what they wanted he gave
[55:08] them bread he gave them meat their
[55:09] clothes never wore out the shoe didn't
[55:11] have to buy a new pair of shoes in 40
[55:13] years
[55:16] and yet they thought
[55:18] that was good enough
[55:21] but Joshua and Caleb had a different
[55:23] spirit amen
[55:25] amen they saw that there was someone
[55:26] greater than Moses
[55:28] you hear what I'm saying so when Moses
[55:31] left they just didn't faint Hallelujah
[55:34] no they recognized there was a
[55:37] progression of something happening
[55:39] because God called Joshua
[55:41] and said listen Joshua you're the next
[55:44] one in line
[55:45] [Applause]
[55:47] I'm taking Moses
[55:50] but I'm anointing you to lead my people
[55:52] across
[55:54] what happened in Joshua's Ministry
[55:58] and that's what happens in the message
[56:00] are the people that believe themselves
[56:02] to be Christians
[56:04] before they could ever cross over they
[56:07] had to be sanctified
[56:10] amen yeah You Gotta Die
[56:12] man you gotta cross over the Jordan
[56:16] hello somebody
[56:18] that's right that generation had to be
[56:20] re-synced uh recircumcised
[56:24] and they couldn't just call oh I'm a Jew
[56:26] no you had to be recircumcised there was
[56:29] a generation that knew nothing about the
[56:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[56:33] [Applause]
[56:34] Hallelujah and you and I are witnesses
[56:37] right now there are people that has
[56:40] nothing to they don't know nothing about
[56:42] it
[56:43] you know we we all get confused
[56:46] something still thinking speaking in
[56:47] tongues some still think it's jumping
[56:49] some thinking shouting and running all
[56:51] of that is good
[56:52] but the true baptism brings you into the
[56:55] life
[56:56] of the word
[56:58] Hallelujah it leads you into the life of
[57:01] the word
[57:07] not for yesterday
[57:09] this day
[57:13] God doesn't change his mind
[57:15] about his word reading from paragraph
[57:18] 174 he says now listen closely now
[57:21] when the word tests come
[57:23] okay excuse me when they went over and
[57:26] seen the opposition so great the
[57:29] greatest opposition they ever seen
[57:31] listen to the words
[57:34] because what's coming to us will be the
[57:37] greatest opposition we've ever had
[57:40] oh y'all think your flesh is your
[57:42] greatest Opera lost in all those those
[57:45] are those are little little demons
[57:48] compared to the demons that's coming
[57:52] thank God for Grace
[57:55] huh
[57:56] because the prophet God said in that
[57:58] Supreme hour
[58:00] God would give us Supreme faith
[58:03] Hallelujah he give it to us not that we
[58:06] deserve it not that we earned it but his
[58:09] grace will bring it to us
[58:13] Hallelujah is that right even Moses
[58:16] didn't have it until God says why are
[58:19] you crying speak
[58:20] he had it but he didn't know he had it
[58:23] just like you got it but you don't know
[58:25] you got it
[58:26] it's going to take pressure it's going
[58:29] to take a squeeze it's going to bring
[58:31] you to an opposition
[58:33] a great one
[58:35] the greatest opposition they ever seen
[58:38] the amalekites was ten times their size
[58:41] they said we looked like grasshoppers
[58:44] their fences
[58:46] on their cities are so so wall till they
[58:49] can run a chariot race around it two
[58:52] cherries as hard as they can go around
[58:55] the wall see of their cities you don't
[58:57] understand what I'm saying even when it
[58:59] came to Jericho the children of Israel
[59:01] marching around look like little ants
[59:04] compared
[59:05] but they didn't understand who was in
[59:08] battle
[59:10] Hallelujah and the children of Israel
[59:13] that group of people understood who was
[59:16] in battle whatever Joshua say will
[59:20] happen if he said walk around the wall
[59:22] seven times we're going to walk around
[59:24] the wall
[59:25] why they believe the word of a prophet
[59:28] and though it whatever he said came to
[59:30] pass amen
[59:32] Hallelujah
[59:34] it's worth the battle
[59:36] those people were tired they were weary
[59:39] oh come on somebody a big city walking
[59:43] around the walls
[59:46] huh
[59:47] and then the last time
[59:49] walk around seven times
[59:53] I'll tell you what I used to jog around
[59:55] Gray's Lake walk around Gray's Lake I
[59:58] went I went to Gray's Lake what a week
[1:00:00] or so ago and I was crying Lord have
[1:00:02] mercy the first round
[1:00:05] it's been so long ago yeah I'm out of
[1:00:08] condition right my feet start hurting
[1:00:11] you know what I'm trying to say now
[1:00:13] that's nothing like Jericho
[1:00:18] with all those people making fun of you
[1:00:21] trying to break your faith destroy
[1:00:24] that's what demons do don't they
[1:00:26] when you started move moving toward God
[1:00:29] that's when the Devils attack you
[1:00:32] and they're gonna oh you're not going to
[1:00:33] make it you make too many mistakes look
[1:00:36] what you just did that ain't got nothing
[1:00:39] to do with it it's all about God
[1:00:43] Hallelujah none of us would make Heaven
[1:00:45] if we had our own righteousness now I
[1:00:49] say it like this all of us somehow
[1:00:51] during the daytime has done something
[1:00:53] wrong
[1:00:55] thank God for his grace and his Mercy
[1:00:58] hmm but God chose you
[1:01:02] Moses was a man like Elijah
[1:01:06] they were human
[1:01:08] they made mistakes Moses got upset
[1:01:11] hadn't got upset in a long time
[1:01:14] the only person that could push his
[1:01:16] button
[1:01:17] was his wife
[1:01:19] but that day everybody got on this nerve
[1:01:22] huh and instead of speaking to the Rock
[1:01:25] he smoked the rock y'all hear me think
[1:01:29] about it people
[1:01:30] God is looking for a total surrender
[1:01:36] so that kind of thing won't happen
[1:01:40] when the Great opposition comes right
[1:01:43] see Peter didn't have the Holy Ghost so
[1:01:45] when the pressure came Peter pulled out
[1:01:47] his sword and went for the head
[1:01:50] but that's not the kind of warfare we're
[1:01:53] in
[1:01:54] your walk there is not carnal amen
[1:01:57] but it's worth the fight
[1:02:00] when you know that the Holy Ghost amen
[1:02:03] is your battle ax when you know he's a
[1:02:06] captain he's called in the shots
[1:02:08] you don't have to worry about trying to
[1:02:10] understand it
[1:02:12] sometimes it'll make you do things you
[1:02:14] wouldn't even understand how you wait a
[1:02:17] minute now Lord this is a great Giant
[1:02:19] and you inspired me to go pick up five
[1:02:22] stones
[1:02:23] and a slingshot
[1:02:25] y'all understand me see reasoning when
[1:02:29] the opposition comes you
[1:02:31] can send you can't try to figure it out
[1:02:34] if God say do this you do it
[1:02:37] and he will do the rest
[1:02:41] oh my God let me hurry up
[1:02:43] oh my god listen what it says they said
[1:02:46] we look like grasshoppers they're fences
[1:02:48] or their cities are so wild till they
[1:02:51] can run a chariot race around it too
[1:02:54] chariots as hard as they can go round
[1:02:57] the wall see of their cities why they
[1:03:01] spare their Spears are way out there
[1:03:04] long they're Giants why we look like
[1:03:07] grasshoppers we we cannot we can't do it
[1:03:12] see you can't see you can't do that
[1:03:15] that negative confession
[1:03:18] and sometimes we let it slip don't we
[1:03:20] but just as let just as soon as you let
[1:03:22] it slip you gotta repent
[1:03:25] quickly repent
[1:03:27] catch that that demon before those words
[1:03:30] before it Go eternal
[1:03:32] relaxing y'all understand me because
[1:03:34] once you release it only repentance can
[1:03:36] catch it
[1:03:41] and two men stood on that word Caleb and
[1:03:44] Joshua said wait a minute you two
[1:03:47] million people shut up just a minute
[1:03:50] now a lot of times people don't like you
[1:03:52] to say shut up
[1:03:54] but that's okay sometimes it sound crude
[1:03:57] but sometimes that's the only way you
[1:03:59] can get them to shut up
[1:04:02] [Laughter]
[1:04:04] yes sir
[1:04:06] right shut up a minute we are more than
[1:04:09] able to do it see we are more than a
[1:04:13] match for them now you might not know
[1:04:15] but this message is from me
[1:04:18] what was
[1:04:20] the basing on it what what was they
[1:04:23] basing on God said I've given you the
[1:04:26] land
[1:04:27] it's yours
[1:04:30] see if they can base their salvation and
[1:04:33] their victories on God has given us a
[1:04:36] land is that right God has given you the
[1:04:39] land
[1:04:41] you don't have to worry about your
[1:04:43] theophany it's there it's waiting on you
[1:04:45] your glorified body is waiting on you
[1:04:48] God is giving you the land but you've
[1:04:51] got to fight for it
[1:04:53] oh don't worry you'll win
[1:04:56] you've been ordained to win
[1:04:58] and the Bible says no weapon formed
[1:05:00] against you
[1:05:01] Hallelujah shall prosper I don't care
[1:05:04] how many times you make mistakes
[1:05:06] you know it's going to be a strange
[1:05:07] thing when that soldier who lost his ear
[1:05:09] by the by Peter look at Peter and see
[1:05:11] him sitting up on the throne there
[1:05:17] me but no weapon
[1:05:20] formed against you you can't speak Evil
[1:05:23] all you want
[1:05:25] amen it cannot stop the true seed of God
[1:05:29] it is what it is
[1:05:32] Hallelujah and I'm accepting every bit
[1:05:36] of it I don't know how God listen I I
[1:05:39] love this portion that David says Lord
[1:05:41] deliver me from this horrible pit well
[1:05:44] God we don't know where he was what he
[1:05:47] called the horrible pitch but we know
[1:05:49] one thing God delivered him
[1:05:51] [Laughter]
[1:05:53] Hallelujah you understand me sometimes
[1:05:56] we find ourselves in some dark places
[1:05:58] but all you got to do is cry out
[1:06:03] Mercy Lord
[1:06:05] at least while we're under Mercy
[1:06:08] while Grace is being found remember that
[1:06:11] door is going to shut
[1:06:13] and we don't have long
[1:06:15] it's going to shut pretty soon
[1:06:18] because once that Council of churches
[1:06:20] begin to pressure you the door is
[1:06:22] already shut when they come out that's
[1:06:24] what brother bam said when they come
[1:06:26] against the bride or when they when they
[1:06:28] you know turn this way it's over
[1:06:31] those who are out or out and those who
[1:06:34] are in or in
[1:06:35] that's it and at that point in time and
[1:06:38] he talks about it somewhere I don't have
[1:06:40] the quote with me he said when you see
[1:06:42] the world begin to have a a Revival he
[1:06:45] said that is the time of the rapture
[1:06:48] I'm paraphrasing it but don't you see
[1:06:51] what the what the world is doing what
[1:06:53] they call a Revival there's still no
[1:06:55] Revival
[1:06:57] but it looks like it they think that's
[1:07:00] what it is it is an anointing of God but
[1:07:03] that anointing is doing something
[1:07:04] different from them for them than us
[1:07:08] amen amen
[1:07:11] Hallelujah because the tag can't be a
[1:07:13] wheat
[1:07:15] but it has to be anointed and think
[1:07:18] about it people when they are when they
[1:07:20] come together in such a unity and you
[1:07:22] says no
[1:07:24] then you're going to look like the devil
[1:07:29] is that right you said what are you
[1:07:31] talking about they did it to Jesus
[1:07:34] Jesus looked like the devil
[1:07:37] because he would not agree with the
[1:07:39] organizations of that day
[1:07:42] help us Lord Jesus
[1:07:44] let me move on what was their basing it
[1:07:46] on God said I give you that it's yours
[1:07:49] and there's there they stood but the
[1:07:51] people had gotten married off against
[1:07:53] other things all kinds of Creeds and
[1:07:56] rituals among them and they just weekly
[1:07:59] wishy-washy didn't know which a way to
[1:08:02] turn and what to do that's right there
[1:08:04] come the word test see what I'm saying
[1:08:07] what happens look at us I want you to
[1:08:10] scope it
[1:08:11] so many Creeds and dogmas and traditions
[1:08:15] among us and we call it the word
[1:08:18] and you we we we won't admit the
[1:08:22] strength is gone
[1:08:25] when serves uncompromised
[1:08:28] they took his strength
[1:08:31] and we can't we don't want to admit it
[1:08:34] we need a Revival
[1:08:36] we don't want to remit admit that
[1:08:38] somewhere we got our course and brother
[1:08:40] by Adam said how do how do you get back
[1:08:42] to Jesus you go back to where you left
[1:08:45] him amen
[1:08:46] and where did they leave Jesus at
[1:08:48] Pentecost
[1:08:51] and where do we leave him at Pentecost
[1:08:53] we had a intellectual Revival
[1:08:57] that's what we had and they took that
[1:08:59] quote where where where where brother
[1:09:01] Adam said amen that you know the Holy
[1:09:04] Ghost is is without sensation and they
[1:09:06] did the same thing the Pentecostals did
[1:09:09] with speaking in tongues
[1:09:13] they did the same thing and what did we
[1:09:16] do we killed the people
[1:09:18] we kept them from going into the holies
[1:09:22] of holies
[1:09:23] I don't care what they think of me
[1:09:25] that's the truth
[1:09:28] and until we get back to that old-time
[1:09:30] religion there's only one way I think
[1:09:33] brother said in in the rising of the Sun
[1:09:36] and one of those two Easter message or
[1:09:38] something somewhere he said there's
[1:09:39] there's only one way that that the
[1:09:42] Pentecostal Church could have babies
[1:09:46] when they go to reproduce what they're
[1:09:49] going to reproduce those hauling
[1:09:51] screaming Acts 2 38 babies
[1:09:53] that's it when the last time you've seen
[1:09:56] that
[1:09:59] help us Jesus
[1:10:01] and then when I stop preaching stuff
[1:10:03] like this they're going to tell you oh
[1:10:05] he's off the message
[1:10:08] I'm off the message and you got people
[1:10:11] they've been sitting in your church
[1:10:13] they've been thinking they're living and
[1:10:15] they're dead
[1:10:17] help us Jesus we can't be afraid of the
[1:10:21] opposition
[1:10:24] we can't your songs are at stake
[1:10:28] and you've got to seek out God until you
[1:10:31] know that you know that you know and
[1:10:33] what you say what do you mean I mean
[1:10:35] when you know you got it you can't stop
[1:10:37] amen amen you can't stop talking about
[1:10:40] him you can't stop preaching or teaching
[1:10:42] or whatever the case may be he's on your
[1:10:44] mind all the time
[1:10:47] that's the True Church of God amen we
[1:10:50] got too many things on our minds
[1:10:53] that's where we lost and Satan knows
[1:10:56] he's given us all those fillers
[1:11:00] till we don't have time to read and pray
[1:11:02] like we should
[1:11:03] huh
[1:11:04] and you know have you ever had that
[1:11:06] struggle Lord should I read or should I
[1:11:08] look at this or that
[1:11:11] and it may not even be evil
[1:11:14] but but
[1:11:20] may God help us
[1:11:23] you know that was the danger of bringing
[1:11:25] that thing and all these other things
[1:11:27] into our home because the problem that
[1:11:29] God knew it was going to distract us
[1:11:31] bring us to a state of lukewarmness
[1:11:38] oh I'm not ashamed but I was telling
[1:11:41] somebody I said I am not hot
[1:11:46] how many are hot
[1:11:49] see I'm honest
[1:11:51] I'm honest
[1:11:53] I want to be hot
[1:11:55] somewhere I've lost the Heat
[1:11:58] but I'm going to get it
[1:12:01] man I'm gonna find where I left him
[1:12:03] y'all understand me
[1:12:06] oh you say oh wow you're in the puppet
[1:12:08] oh yes the anointing is here that's him
[1:12:11] but it's out of the pulpit I'm talking
[1:12:13] about
[1:12:15] I remember when God first saved me I
[1:12:18] stand on the corners and preach
[1:12:20] scream and I buy myself I didn't care
[1:12:23] saving Souls that's all that mattered
[1:12:26] what happened
[1:12:29] oh you matured brother Brooks you call
[1:12:31] that majority
[1:12:32] that's what people say in the message
[1:12:34] when you mature you'd get dead
[1:12:39] you sit there and don't say no amen and
[1:12:42] don't say hallelujahs or nothing like
[1:12:44] that don't even smile what church is
[1:12:46] that
[1:12:47] that's not the New Testament Church
[1:12:50] and I don't care what you say I hear I
[1:12:52] hear Brother Brown I hear the word of
[1:12:53] God I know what he says and I'm looking
[1:12:55] for that he said you can't say this is
[1:12:58] that until you see that become this or
[1:13:01] this become that y'all understand me
[1:13:04] I'm not gonna lie to me
[1:13:07] this is my only opportunity this is your
[1:13:10] only opportunity
[1:13:13] y'all don't know my prayer has been I
[1:13:15] don't care what it takes to make me
[1:13:16] fired up
[1:13:18] whatever it takes God do it for me
[1:13:22] I don't care if people love me hate me I
[1:13:24] don't care
[1:13:26] I don't want to be like nobody else but
[1:13:28] Jesus
[1:13:36] yet he Grant your permission to make per
[1:13:39] to make see permit you permit your will
[1:13:42] or permission will knowing that what's
[1:13:44] in your heart he knows it you say well
[1:13:46] brother Brandon I I do so and so I don't
[1:13:49] bother it it don't bother me God blesses
[1:13:52] me every day I sing in spirit I dance in
[1:13:55] the spirit he permits It Go a bit go
[1:13:57] ahead that's right but what you're going
[1:14:00] to do
[1:14:01] I wear shorts I do this I don't bother
[1:14:03] don't it don't bother me I know my faith
[1:14:06] is in Christ not in what I wear you know
[1:14:09] that's what people I can drink I can
[1:14:10] smoke I can do this I can do that it
[1:14:12] doesn't bother me
[1:14:14] but it's wrong with people they don't
[1:14:17] even know Satan has tied them up
[1:14:22] but the Bible said there is something to
[1:14:24] do with it see what you do you make a
[1:14:28] stumbling block
[1:14:29] like Balaam did before every one of the
[1:14:32] others women what you'll do you you to
[1:14:35] your your girls you'll have a bunch of
[1:14:37] ricketters that's exactly right a bunch
[1:14:39] of little painted up Jezebel see God
[1:14:42] will prosper you why he's blessed as
[1:14:45] he's being I don't doubt that he blessed
[1:14:48] Balaam too
[1:14:50] see certainly he will you'll walk in his
[1:14:53] permission will not his perfect will God
[1:14:56] doesn't change his mind God bless God
[1:14:59] cause He blesses you doesn't mean he
[1:15:02] changed his mind he's black he's blessed
[1:15:04] Israel out there for 40 years what did
[1:15:07] they do married wives raise families
[1:15:09] kiss children paid the tithing lived
[1:15:12] right on there out there and God blessed
[1:15:15] them in the wilderness fed them with
[1:15:17] with the Manna on and on and every one
[1:15:20] of them perish because they never kept
[1:15:24] his original or permit his original will
[1:15:27] his word they took his permissive way
[1:15:31] go ahead
[1:15:33] but you remember when they left kadish
[1:15:37] they never journeyed any further
[1:15:40] they just went around and around in the
[1:15:44] wilderness
[1:15:45] where they could have been out in two
[1:15:48] days after that they could be in the
[1:15:51] promised land you hear the word could
[1:15:54] have been could have been What About Us
[1:15:58] we could have been
[1:16:01] right oh well this is applying it to us
[1:16:06] it's worth the fight
[1:16:08] it's worth the battle
[1:16:13] Hallelujah like my old friend said I
[1:16:16] don't want no trouble at the river
[1:16:19] that's right
[1:16:24] they Journey 40 years and every one of
[1:16:26] them died but Joshua and Caleb the ones
[1:16:30] that stayed on the original were
[1:16:34] think about it listen what word Psalm
[1:16:37] says in Psalms 18 31 he said it is God
[1:16:41] that girth me with strength and make it
[1:16:45] my way perfect
[1:16:47] it is God who's doing this
[1:16:51] Hallelujah so what I look toward the
[1:16:55] hill what hill Calvary
[1:16:58] for which cometh my help
[1:17:01] and my help comes from who the Lord
[1:17:05] we can't do it but we know who get
[1:17:08] brings the help help me Lord
[1:17:12] Hallelujah you can't overcome this age
[1:17:15] with your intellect
[1:17:17] Hallelujah we need the Holy Ghost in
[1:17:19] power that that you know he said we're
[1:17:22] brothers I got the Holy Ghost and Power
[1:17:30] brother man said it like this
[1:17:36] he said there come a time in your life
[1:17:37] you need to you need to call a
[1:17:39] conference with God
[1:17:42] that means you got to get to yourself
[1:17:46] somewhere you got to get to yourself and
[1:17:50] you got to call a conference with him
[1:17:52] and you got to bring his word to him and
[1:17:55] said you said
[1:17:57] God I believe
[1:17:59] and you're the only one that can change
[1:18:01] me into what your word promised I would
[1:18:04] be
[1:18:04] right you gotta you gotta come with you
[1:18:07] gotta bring the word to God
[1:18:13] right
[1:18:14] when it was time for uh Israel to come
[1:18:17] out of Babylon somebody took the word
[1:18:21] and they brought that word back to God
[1:18:23] or God brought it down to him revealed
[1:18:26] 70 years is up it's time to get up out
[1:18:28] of here y'all understand me and when the
[1:18:31] prophet of God went off the scene that
[1:18:33] was our understanding it's time to get
[1:18:36] out of here
[1:18:37] why because Joshua is on the scene but
[1:18:40] you'll never cross over and listen the
[1:18:43] promised land wasn't uh how can I say it
[1:18:45] Canaan
[1:18:46] was it not was not heaven
[1:18:50] it was a time of battle
[1:18:52] and maybe we've crossed over to Canaan
[1:18:54] but that's not the ultimate amen because
[1:18:57] Joshua said give me my Mountain I want
[1:19:00] my inheritance I want the promises of
[1:19:03] Moses Hallelujah I'm still oh I'm old
[1:19:07] but I'm still young I can fight like I'm
[1:19:10] young anyway so we will not
[1:19:13] misunderstand
[1:19:14] it's worth the battle
[1:19:16] we sang that song is worth my crying
[1:19:18] it's worth my dying
[1:19:20] ah God I know it's worth it to make
[1:19:24] Heaven my home
[1:19:25] Hallelujah but you can't just do that
[1:19:28] like I said the other day
[1:19:30] we've got to learn the only way that
[1:19:32] we're going to defeat Satan is by the by
[1:19:35] the word l-o-v-e
[1:19:37] love love conquers all things
[1:19:41] and Satan is a thing
[1:19:44] yep
[1:19:45] and you can't have oh I just love no no
[1:19:49] no God has to give it
[1:19:53] I love God because he what first loved
[1:19:56] me
[1:19:59] Jesus help me Lord
[1:20:01] call a conference you bring his word you
[1:20:04] bring his promises Lord you promised how
[1:20:06] did Seymour and them get get the Holy
[1:20:08] Ghost to fall in on Azusa Street they
[1:20:11] saw the word there in Acts they saw the
[1:20:15] word that the Holy Ghost was promised
[1:20:16] and they got a conference they had a
[1:20:18] conference with God and they wouldn't
[1:20:20] stop it took months I don't know how
[1:20:23] long it took but they didn't stop until
[1:20:25] God fell until God came down and that's
[1:20:29] how it is I don't care how long you

[1:22:04] ain't got a chance
[1:22:07] it's a wonder it's amazing
[1:22:09] Hallelujah let's go to uh Psalms 19.
[1:22:13] it says 1913 he says to let the word
[1:22:16] this is so important
[1:22:19] Lord have mercy let the word of my mouth
[1:22:24] and the meditation of my heart
[1:22:28] be acceptable in thy sight
[1:22:31] O Lord my strength
[1:22:34] and my redeemer
[1:22:37] let the words of my mouth see that's
[1:22:42] that's keeping yourself
[1:22:44] James says a man who can Bridle his
[1:22:46] tongue is a perfect bag
[1:22:49] let the words of my mouth
[1:22:52] and the meditation of my heart Lord
[1:22:55] don't let me think on evil
[1:22:57] don't let me think on evil things or do
[1:22:59] evil things y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:23:01] I'm God this message is speaking to me
[1:23:05] be acceptable in thy sight oh Lord my
[1:23:08] strength in my redeemer

[1:23:20] don't have to turn amen Psalms 18 says
[1:23:22] the Lord is my rock and my Fortress and
[1:23:27] my deliverer my God my strength in whom
[1:23:31] I will trust my Buckler and the thought
[1:23:35] the the Horn of my salvation
[1:23:38] Hallelujah in my high tower it is such a
[1:23:42] man it's so amazing to me that these men
[1:23:46] of God like Moses and Joshua and
[1:23:49] different ones I mean you even take
[1:23:51] Hannah how she prophesied about things
[1:23:53] in the future she got so caught up in
[1:23:55] the spirit amen and you think about how
[1:23:58] these people when they get caught up all
[1:24:00] they do is praise God and worship him
[1:24:02] and give him honor where honor is due
[1:24:05] hey
[1:24:06] have I asked in church I'm uh anybody
[1:24:10] got a praise
[1:24:13] come on hey it shows something wrong
[1:24:18] I remember even in the Pentecostal
[1:24:20] Church would they answer that you you
[1:24:22] almost hear the chairs turning over
[1:24:23] people jumping out of their seat so fast
[1:24:26] yeah
[1:24:27] we did we had popcorn praises
[1:24:30] amen
[1:24:33] right did I get all those quotes that I
[1:24:35] wanted to
[1:24:36] there was another one too there brother
[1:24:38] um
[1:24:39] another quote
[1:24:43] three all together
[1:24:49] the first one is uh from God I just read
[1:24:52] that when uh God never changed his mind
[1:24:54] speak to the Rock
[1:24:57] um
[1:25:00] that that that's actually the uh and the
[1:25:03] one in a million
[1:25:05] maybe I didn't have it on there one in a
[1:25:07] million
[1:25:08] let that be the last one anyway okay
[1:25:11] you love the Lord
[1:25:13] one in a million that would be uh
[1:25:16] paragraph
[1:25:18] 54-57 I don't think I wrote that down
[1:25:21] I'm not sure
[1:25:23] now Joshua is this okay I'm almost
[1:25:27] Joshua had no way to knowing he could
[1:25:29] take that City Caleb had no way of
[1:25:32] knowing it
[1:25:34] but here's how they believed it because
[1:25:36] God says I have given you this land
[1:25:40] I've got an angel that'll go before you
[1:25:42] but take heed that you don't despise him
[1:25:46] because my name is in him
[1:25:50] now you've got to under understand let's
[1:25:52] bring it to our day
[1:25:53] I've got a messenger
[1:25:55] William Branham
[1:25:57] don't despise him
[1:25:59] because my name is in him right he won't
[1:26:03] pardon your sins he will tear you across
[1:26:06] a fireplace he will rougher up your
[1:26:08] feathers he will do things for you but
[1:26:11] remember follow him
[1:26:13] in other words he's not going to make
[1:26:15] excuses for your sins
[1:26:17] you must overcome them
[1:26:19] you gotta conquer it
[1:26:21] right but you continue to follow him he
[1:26:25] will lead you to the promised land but
[1:26:27] don't despise him don't reject him
[1:26:30] believe him
[1:26:32] now then we noticed in the journey
[1:26:35] Joshua had found out that he had seen
[1:26:38] the great God living there in that pill
[1:26:41] of fire had performed all kinds of
[1:26:44] Miracles he and Caleb had seen that and
[1:26:47] they had confidence that God would keep
[1:26:50] his word watch God way down in Egypt I
[1:26:54] have given you the land now go and
[1:26:57] possess it
[1:26:59] you can't you can't you can't you can't
[1:27:02] face god with Lord I can't do it
[1:27:08] we had a prophet with Joshua on the
[1:27:10] inside who did it
[1:27:14] yes amen right
[1:27:16] and you and I must understand by the
[1:27:19] grace of God now that the prophet of God
[1:27:21] is going who are we who voice are we
[1:27:23] listening to the same voice
[1:27:27] God given every sick person in here

[1:27:35] he didn't say God is going to give
[1:27:38] God's given every sick person in here

[1:27:47] our transgression with his stripes we
[1:27:51] were healed it's yours
[1:27:54] but you have to fight for every inch you
[1:27:57] possess
[1:27:59] everywhere the soul of your feet travel
[1:28:01] God told Joshua
[1:28:05] I've given I have given you
[1:28:07] Footprints and means possession let
[1:28:10] let's move in tonight amen let's go in

[1:28:19] us if
[1:28:21] Lord I'm getting excited listen
[1:28:25] let's take every ground that God has
[1:28:27] given us if you haven't got the baptism
[1:28:29] of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:32] Peter said the promise is unto you
[1:28:36] is to your children to them that are far
[1:28:40] off even as many as the Lord Our God
[1:28:42] shall call listen that's your
[1:28:44] inheritance that's your heritage

[1:29:00] possess it is God promise don't look at
[1:29:03] the circumstances don't look how hard it
[1:29:06] is let's possess the land
[1:29:08] we're having a meeting like this morning
[1:29:10] where where we were having a meeting
[1:29:13] there and the Holy Ghost falling in the
[1:29:15] place the people screaming and shouting
[1:29:17] and praising the Lord and then someone
[1:29:19] come up and said pray for me brother
[1:29:21] Branham I said hands on him I laid hands
[1:29:24] on him and prayed for him and I said now
[1:29:26] go and believe now here's what it is
[1:29:29] it's easy to feel the power of God to
[1:29:33] see it uh when you believe but then when
[1:29:36] it comes to The Showdown are you able to
[1:29:39] possess the thing that you profess to
[1:29:42] have
[1:29:43] y'all hear it that's the thing brother
[1:29:46] we've got to get it we've got to take it
[1:29:50] it's ours but you gotta fight for every
[1:29:54] inch
[1:29:55] Hallelujah screaming and shouting not
[1:29:59] standing still you're going to be crying
[1:30:01] somewhere something emotional is going
[1:30:04] to come forth
[1:30:07] amen I know when the power and the
[1:30:09] Revelation hit your soul you don't feel
[1:30:11] a thing but when that whale start moving
[1:30:14] from that last Dimension from your soul
[1:30:17] and start moving up into your spirit
[1:30:18] Hallelujah where all your emotions are
[1:30:22] now Jesus is not a liar
[1:30:25] he told the woman I give you water that
[1:30:27] will spring up
[1:30:29] didn't say stand still
[1:30:31] didn't say Still Waters Run Deep
[1:30:34] even though they do
[1:30:38] but you know what that devil has been
[1:30:40] sneezing he's a character
[1:30:43] and he's duped these people I've heard
[1:30:45] people say things
[1:30:50] you know what and I know it's going to
[1:30:52] sound funny to somebody
[1:30:57] I better leave that alone you know
[1:30:59] because I hear people say oh I just love
[1:31:01] brother Branham
[1:31:04] and I'll be thinking all the time you've
[1:31:07] never met him
[1:31:12] and what you've met
[1:31:14] is not William Branham
[1:31:16] it's Jesus Christ
[1:31:21] it's Jesus Christ who you love
[1:31:25] but people oh I just love brother
[1:31:27] Branham you know why they said because
[1:31:30] brother William said all that love me
[1:31:32] all that I love and all that love me and
[1:31:35] they take that quote and they just
[1:31:36] spread it all around and they live any
[1:31:38] kind of way but I love brother Phantom
[1:31:40] let me put it this way Jesus said if you
[1:31:42] love me keep my Commandments
[1:31:45] and if you love brother Branham keep his
[1:31:48] commandment because his Commandments
[1:31:49] with Jesus Commandments
[1:31:52] people something else that Devil's smart
[1:31:55] he just let him go on their way
[1:31:58] go on their way and he'll drive him
[1:32:00] right into idolatry and they won't even
[1:32:02] know it
[1:32:07] God had to show Moses
[1:32:09] that that serpent
[1:32:12] on the pole was now an idol among the
[1:32:16] people
[1:32:18] they didn't even know it
[1:32:21] but somehow they began to worship that
[1:32:23] thing
[1:32:26] and it was wrong in the eyes of God
[1:32:31] y'all y'all think I'm crazy I know
[1:32:34] you get you go I'm I'ma hit this and go
[1:32:38] ahead you're going to some message
[1:32:39] church today they don't have all these
[1:32:41] pictures
[1:32:42] and the first thing people said well
[1:32:43] there ain't no master Church
[1:32:46] they don't have the pillar fire
[1:32:49] that ain't the pilify that's a picture
[1:32:51] of it
[1:32:54] but they handle it
[1:32:58] it's such an idle way
[1:33:00] they don't understand what they're doing
[1:33:02] I'm not saying they're deliberately
[1:33:04] doing it
[1:33:05] but how how how can you define a message
[1:33:10] Church by the things hanging up on the
[1:33:13] walls
[1:33:16] well I'll show you how the holy how the
[1:33:19] Holy Spirit defines it
[1:33:22] saying spirit
[1:33:26] that dwelled in Christ dwell in you
[1:33:30] that's that's it Christ the hope of
[1:33:33] glory in you
[1:33:34] the other church
[1:33:37] not this room even though we come with
[1:33:40] revers and respect this is not it this
[1:33:44] is going to burn up
[1:33:45] but the real one amen
[1:33:48] cannot die
[1:33:53] I'm not saying people do that
[1:33:54] deliberately no they've been taught that
[1:33:56] and they just carry it on and nobody
[1:33:58] ever consider it
[1:34:02] is that all right amen you know it don't
[1:34:05] make no difference because I'm a preach
[1:34:06] it anyway
[1:34:07] the truth of the matter is we got to be
[1:34:09] set free from all of this if we're going
[1:34:12] to see Jesus as he is we need the naked
[1:34:16] word we got to do away with all of the
[1:34:19] stuff
[1:34:20] and allow God to build his character in
[1:34:23] US
[1:34:24] that's what we've got to do somebody
[1:34:26] told me the other we're not long ago
[1:34:29] when they left this church and went
[1:34:30] somewhere else and you mean to tell me
[1:34:32] that you're saying that the system that
[1:34:35] brother Branham set up is wrong I said I
[1:34:37] never said that
[1:34:39] we made it wrong
[1:34:44] hello
[1:34:46] we made it wrong because you know what
[1:34:48] we did we systemized it her brother
[1:34:51] random never ever stopped the moving of
[1:34:54] the Holy Ghost
[1:34:55] it's 30 minutes we done we done sang 30
[1:34:58] 40 minutes that's enough and the Holy
[1:35:01] Ghost is moving
[1:35:03] what nonsense is that
[1:35:08] he governed those people with a law
[1:35:11] because many of them didn't even have
[1:35:13] the Holy Ghost
[1:35:15] a lot of them jumping up speaking in
[1:35:18] tongues and everything and trying to
[1:35:19] interpret why the word was going
[1:35:21] so he had to put things in order but he
[1:35:24] never ever tried to stop the moving of
[1:35:27] the Holy Ghost and that's what we've
[1:35:29] done
[1:35:32] that's how carnal people is
[1:35:35] you you're saying that's a system no
[1:35:37] that's not what I was saying and if you
[1:35:40] thought that's what I was saying you
[1:35:42] were carnal in your thinking
[1:35:45] and your accusations are wrong
[1:35:50] who am I to correct the prophet you
[1:35:53] understand what I'm saying
[1:35:54] but what I'm trying to say is we don't
[1:35:57] systematic now I just think so much to
[1:35:59] people won't move
[1:36:01] they won't even say hallelujah glory to
[1:36:04] God and everybody's worried about how
[1:36:06] long you've been there
[1:36:08] I believe with all of my heart the Holy
[1:36:11] Ghost is a gentleman
[1:36:13] and when it's time for the word to begin
[1:36:16] he's going to make it so
[1:36:18] but let me ask you a question if I come
[1:36:21] up here and I preach 20 minutes and the
[1:36:23] Holy Ghost Falls what am I supposed to
[1:36:26] do you know what brother Venom says stop
[1:36:30] he said because that's what you've been
[1:36:32] preaching for
[1:36:33] you're preaching for him to come
[1:36:36] he can do in a split second what you
[1:36:39] couldn't do in 30 minutes or an hour
[1:36:42] yep
[1:36:44] we're preaching that the anointing of
[1:36:46] God would fall is that right
[1:36:50] when the Peter was preaching then what
[1:36:53] the Holy Ghost fail
[1:36:55] that's why we preach
[1:36:57] so that the Holy Ghost can fall but when
[1:37:00] the Holy Ghost fall I'm supposed that
[1:37:02] when that sister the Lord was really
[1:37:04] blessing her and I'm I'm adding it on
[1:37:06] because I wanted more to enter in that's
[1:37:09] what it's all about he was in the house
[1:37:11] and we treated him like a stranger
[1:37:15] people don't recognize the presence of
[1:37:17] God
[1:37:18] because we strip the message people from
[1:37:21] it
[1:37:21] that's something we don't do that's
[1:37:23] Pentecostal you better get it
[1:37:26] you better get something on that order
[1:37:29] God will do what you want that's what I
[1:37:31] love about God he took those staunch
[1:37:33] Jews
[1:37:34] and let the Holy Ghost fall on them they
[1:37:37] jumping all out the window screaming
[1:37:38] running up and down the street he's here
[1:37:40] you know he's alive
[1:37:42] staunch
[1:37:44] that happened in my church in Lima
[1:37:46] people who had never moved
[1:37:48] had a brother come from Africa preach
[1:37:50] about 15 20 minutes they were running on
[1:37:53] I mean the Holy Spirit came in this move
[1:37:56] I'm like oh my God I had never seen like
[1:37:59] that before and then from there we
[1:38:01] started our Revival
[1:38:04] yes I'm at the end here
[1:38:07] it's worth the battle
[1:38:11] let me tell y'all something people of
[1:38:13] God which you better recognize and I I
[1:38:16] say that with respect
[1:38:18] and honor you can be sitting here in
[1:38:21] your greatest of Health
[1:38:24] but you never know
[1:38:27] when your last breath
[1:38:30] is going to leave you
[1:38:32] we assume
[1:38:34] because we're young
[1:38:36] we've got more time
[1:38:39] that is the trick of the devil
[1:38:41] that's why the Bible said today the day
[1:38:44] did you hear my voice Harden not your
[1:38:46] heart
[1:38:48] but we'll walk out oh I got more time
[1:38:50] you don't know that
[1:38:53] and that's the thing you need to
[1:38:54] capitalize on Lord I don't know how much
[1:38:57] time I have but make me ready
[1:39:02] when Israel left Egypt
[1:39:05] there was approximately two million
[1:39:07] people left at the same time
[1:39:10] every one of them heard the message of a
[1:39:12] prophet
[1:39:13] every one of them saw the pillar fire
[1:39:16] every one of them was baptized to Moses
[1:39:18] in the Red Sea y'all y'all see all the
[1:39:20] all the ritualistic things that they had
[1:39:22] to do every one of them shouted in the
[1:39:24] spirit beat the tambourines and run up
[1:39:26] and down the banks with Miriam when
[1:39:28] Moses sang in the spirit they everyone
[1:39:31] drank from the same spiritual Rock they
[1:39:34] they very everyone each fresh Manna
[1:39:39] every night every one of them but there
[1:39:41] was two made the land one out of a
[1:39:45] million now let me say it like this
[1:39:46] because even Sunday when I was preaching
[1:39:48] I said if you think you know I don't
[1:39:50] know what it is but people instead of
[1:39:52] them taking God's word that it is God
[1:39:55] speaking sometimes they have this little
[1:39:57] thing about a pastor and you know what
[1:39:58] they do they think the past is hitting
[1:40:00] on them or really trying to rebuke them
[1:40:03] or say no that it's it's the attitude of
[1:40:06] the people
[1:40:07] your attitude toward the word and a lot
[1:40:09] of time people how can you use
[1:40:11] circumstances situations in this church
[1:40:14] that you can't help but to preach on
[1:40:16] nobody told you but God God speaks and a
[1:40:19] lot of times people that's why you know
[1:40:21] people don't understand the movement of
[1:40:23] God they don't know they don't know
[1:40:25] people say well well he he preached
[1:40:27] somebody told him I said what Paul said
[1:40:30] to the Corinthians I didn't heard about
[1:40:31] that adultery going on in that church
[1:40:33] somebody told me and you know what I
[1:40:36] believe it
[1:40:38] and he preached on it and not only that
[1:40:40] he said put him out
[1:40:43] he'd say put him out and he was going by
[1:40:45] hearsay
[1:40:47] but somebody told him
[1:40:49] that's the word
[1:40:55] what was the test they all drunk in the
[1:40:58] same Rock drink drinking the same Rock
[1:41:00] they all eat the same spiritual manner
[1:41:02] as we're eating this morning but the
[1:41:05] word test proved them when it come to
[1:41:08] time of cadence by Neil when they
[1:41:10] started over to the promised land and
[1:41:12] they could not go over till they was
[1:41:14] tested by the word do you hear me there
[1:41:17] will not be a rapture
[1:41:20] until that kind of opposition and that
[1:41:24] kind of test come upon us
[1:41:28] brother Ben call it the squeeze
[1:41:30] that's it
[1:41:32] and that's where you're going to have
[1:41:34] your final test that will be your final
[1:41:37] you know a way of saying I'm going to
[1:41:40] stay with God I will not
[1:41:44] that's the word
[1:41:48] amen unless you can tell me something
[1:41:49] else coming my way
[1:41:52] your final test ain't there ain't the
[1:41:54] cover shot
[1:41:57] you understand me that's just one of
[1:42:00] those little things that you know
[1:42:01] something bigger coming
[1:42:05] oh Lord have mercy let me move on I'm
[1:42:08] almost done
[1:42:09] the other ten the other 10 came back and
[1:42:12] said we can't make it the people are
[1:42:14] like we're like grasshoppers to them
[1:42:16] they're great wall City their opposition
[1:42:19] is too great you see what they're doing
[1:42:20] instead of being moved by faith instead
[1:42:24] of being moved by love they're being
[1:42:26] moved by fear
[1:42:28] but Joshua and Caleb's still the people
[1:42:30] they said we're more than able to do it
[1:42:33] why God said before they left the
[1:42:36] promise in I'm giving you the land I
[1:42:39] give it to you it's yours
[1:42:41] but there's where one of one of each
[1:42:45] million they there is approximately 500
[1:42:48] million so-called Christians in the
[1:42:49] world today and each day ends a
[1:42:52] generation and now what if the Rapture
[1:42:54] would come today and 500 people
[1:42:57] University would be taken in the Rapture
[1:42:59] you you would never know or even see it
[1:43:03] in the paper of them going and the
[1:43:05] coming of the Lord is secret is a secret
[1:43:08] coming he'll come and steal away and
[1:43:11] it'll be such a minority see right
[1:43:14] just like in the days when disciples
[1:43:17] said Jesus why does the scribe say Elias
[1:43:20] must first come
[1:43:21] see
[1:43:23] see and Jesus said he has already come
[1:43:26] and you never knew it see that's what
[1:43:28] the world don't know thank you brother
[1:43:29] so the quotes that's what we get we
[1:43:32] can't you know the thing about it is
[1:43:34] such a secret and a lot of times you
[1:43:36] know it ain't the big events that we
[1:43:38] really need to watch out for because in
[1:43:41] reality that the Rapture is overdue
[1:43:45] it really is it's God waiting on us
[1:43:49] where we should have already done it and
[1:43:52] somehow I mean I thank God for his love
[1:43:54] and compassion because I'm glad he
[1:43:56] waited for me
[1:43:58] you know and my thing is this people of
[1:44:01] God you got to stop it and when I say
[1:44:03] stop it stop looking at everything
[1:44:06] stop looking at everybody in the church
[1:44:08] and what all they're doing let them do
[1:44:09] what they're going to do you can't stop
[1:44:10] it my point is this you can't change
[1:44:13] whatever seed they are it is what it is
[1:44:16] right and you preach the word and people
[1:44:18] don't repent don't get upset about it
[1:44:20] they don't repent must be something they
[1:44:23] reason why they can
[1:44:24] you just be thankful that God giving you
[1:44:26] Grace to repent that give you a heart to
[1:44:29] say Lord have mercy on me
[1:44:31] you know I'm grateful that when I see my
[1:44:34] sins I see them as sins
[1:44:36] my shortcomings I see that and don't get
[1:44:39] me wrong like I was telling my son today
[1:44:41] I said but don't get me wrong I said God
[1:44:43] knows I'm covered by the blood
[1:44:46] I see my faults but I'm covered by the
[1:44:48] blood
[1:44:50] I'm safe
[1:44:52] right because I'm in Christ
[1:44:56] he doesn't see my sin that's the message
[1:44:59] amen amen but you see I love him
[1:45:03] and I want to love him more
[1:45:08] to the point amen that that Satan can
[1:45:10] look at me and says what can I do next
[1:45:13] I've tried everything and everything has
[1:45:16] failed
[1:45:19] that's what I'm talking about living
[1:45:21] such a Victorious Life
[1:45:23] battle after Battle Victory after
[1:45:25] Victory but understand every Victory
[1:45:28] gives us a a a a a place for Testimony
[1:45:32] we ought to have testimonies all the
[1:45:34] time huh it God God delivered me today
[1:45:36] or God help me today or God gave me
[1:45:39] Insight today God did this if it that
[1:45:41] should be our conversation
[1:45:46] well you can't you can't you can't you
[1:45:49] know uh I'll put it this way in closing
[1:45:52] God said don't even talk about the
[1:45:54] things that they do in the dark
[1:45:57] is that the word the law don't even want
[1:46:00] us to talk about things that people have
[1:46:02] done in the dark
[1:46:04] don't talk about it you know what
[1:46:05] because it it does something to you
[1:46:09] so let's move on people
[1:46:11] let's move away from where we are let's
[1:46:14] move forward
[1:46:17] some of you may and you may not know
[1:46:19] but I'll be leaving on Friday I'll be
[1:46:22] gone for about a week
[1:46:24] and and I'm going I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1:46:26] I'm going to meet my Lord
[1:46:30] and and and and I'm trusting and
[1:46:32] believing that this message that God is
[1:46:35] so how would you feel like this message
[1:46:37] is for you well first of all
[1:46:40] I thought another brother was supposed
[1:46:41] to preach
[1:46:43] so I didn't come really prepared
[1:46:46] and then I looked at my book bag
[1:46:49] and I left my tablet home
[1:46:51] if I had my tablet I would have been
[1:46:53] prepared
[1:46:55] thank you
[1:46:56] so I had to go into office and God
[1:46:58] started dropping it
[1:47:01] he gave me what to preach tonight
[1:47:04] and as he unfolded everything I knew he
[1:47:06] was talking to me
[1:47:09] I know he spoke to you tonight
[1:47:12] but he he gave me a word of confidence
[1:47:17] a surety
[1:47:20] that where I'm going and what I'm going
[1:47:22] to do he's going to meet me there
[1:47:24] I am so excited
[1:47:28] I'm really thrilled about because I know
[1:47:32] I just say like this I don't know how he
[1:47:34] what he's going what all he's going to
[1:47:35] do but I know I won't return the same
[1:47:38] man
[1:47:39] God is so good to us
[1:47:41] amen because God is going to do what he
[1:47:43] promised he would do
[1:47:44] and I believe this message with all my
[1:47:46] heart
[1:47:47] I really do and I believe that the bride
[1:47:50] is supposed to be a supernatural
[1:47:53] omnipotent bride
[1:47:55] and that's what I'm looking for in my
[1:47:57] life such a change
[1:47:59] that all can see
[1:48:01] Christ in me
[1:48:03] you love the Lord
[1:48:04] amen
[1:48:12] mine eyes have seen the glory of the
[1:48:17] coming of the Lord he is trapping out
[1:48:22] the Vintage where the graves around
