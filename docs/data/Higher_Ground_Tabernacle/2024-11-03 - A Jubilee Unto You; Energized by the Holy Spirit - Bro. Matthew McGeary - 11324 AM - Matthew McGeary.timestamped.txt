[1:08:58] Ruby
[1:09:00] invitation and the
[1:09:02] hospitality and we bring you greetings
[1:09:04] from our pastor Brother David
[1:09:07] mcgi M let's just read in Leviticus
[1:09:11] chapter
[1:09:13] 25 verse 9 and
[1:09:16] 10 say then shalt thou cause the trumpet
[1:09:20] of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day
[1:09:22] of the seventh month in the day of
[1:09:24] atonement shall you make the trumpet
[1:09:26] sound throughout all your
[1:09:36] land and he shall Hollow the 50th year
[1:09:39] and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the
[1:09:41] land unto all the inhabitants thereof it
[1:09:44] shall be a jubilee unto you and you
[1:09:46] shall return every man unto his
[1:09:48] possession and ye shall return every man
[1:09:50] unto his family
[1:10:06] and let's just go ahead and turn in Luke
[1:10:08] chapter
[1:10:16] 4 in verse 18 and 19
[1:10:21] Luke says the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:10:24] me because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:10:27] the gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[1:10:30] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[1:10:31] Deliverance to the captives and
[1:10:32] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[1:10:35] at Liberty them that are
[1:10:44] bruised to preach the acceptable year of
[1:10:47] the
[1:10:51] Lord amen we just pray a blessing upon
[1:10:54] the reading of the word you be
[1:10:58] seated uh uh last evening we spoke uh on
[1:11:02] the thought a jubilee unto
[1:11:07] you and we dealt with how uh the devil
[1:11:10] would try to fight against your
[1:11:14] Jubilee how a spooky spirit will try to
[1:11:17] rob you of your
[1:11:22] joy rob you of your peace
[1:11:26] rob you of your
[1:11:29] inheritance try to keep you in
[1:11:33] bondage and and and though the Jubilee
[1:11:35] trumpet has
[1:11:37] [Music]
[1:11:38] sounded he he's trying to cover up your
[1:11:43] ears he's trying to keep you from
[1:11:45] recognizing what the Jubilee trumpet
[1:11:48] really
[1:11:51] means and so last night we we were just
[1:11:54] dealing with how how Satan tries to bind
[1:11:56] you and lie to
[1:12:01] you and tries to anoint your
[1:12:05] mind and this morning I as a subject I
[1:12:08] want to preach to you a jubilee unto
[1:12:13] you but my subject would be energized by
[1:12:17] the Holy
[1:12:21] Ghost so here in our text in L Leviticus
[1:12:24] 25
[1:12:28] it's a time of
[1:12:30] Liberation it's a time of a
[1:12:33] homecoming where where people that had
[1:12:35] found them in a in a condition where
[1:12:37] their inheritance had been
[1:12:40] lost it had either been sold or taken
[1:12:46] away but there was a law of
[1:12:50] restoration that no matter what had
[1:12:52] taken place
[1:12:55] if they had lost their
[1:12:57] inheritance they had been sold if they
[1:13:00] had been taken away there was a law of
[1:13:05] restoration telling the people that you
[1:13:08] can go back that you could return and
[1:13:12] the prophet of God would say this in
[1:13:13] return in
[1:13:15] Jubilee He would say now if somehow or
[1:13:18] another the individual lost their
[1:13:20] inheritance that was given to them by
[1:13:21] God
[1:13:27] there come a year called The
[1:13:31] Jubilee every seven years they had rest
[1:13:34] a
[1:13:37] Sabbath every seven days they had a
[1:13:42] Sabbath every seven years they had a
[1:13:45] Sabbath and seven sabbaths was 49
[1:13:50] years and the 50th year was Jubilee
[1:13:55] and now I believe we're well
[1:13:58] taught we know there's been seven Church
[1:14:01] ages and through seven Church
[1:14:04] ages we have now come to the 50th
[1:14:09] year speaking to the church ages that
[1:14:12] this is a Year of
[1:14:15] Jubilee and he says and this
[1:14:19] Jubilee every man that had lost his
[1:14:21] inheritance by some means
[1:14:25] if he was a freeorn and true blooded
[1:14:29] [Music]
[1:14:30] Israelites no matter who held the
[1:14:34] possession it had to go back to him
[1:14:38] free he didn't have to pay a
[1:14:41] thing he didn't have to do a
[1:14:43] thing but just stop what he was
[1:14:47] doing and go back to his
[1:14:50] inheritance are you hearing what the
[1:14:52] prophet of God is saying he didn't to
[1:14:55] pay a thing you didn't have to do some
[1:14:57] type of works you didn't have to come up
[1:15:00] with a
[1:15:01] diary he didn't have to come up with
[1:15:03] some means by
[1:15:04] [Music]
[1:15:05] purchasing but when that Jubilee trumpet
[1:15:09] sounded I don't care how many people
[1:15:12] told you you couldn't go
[1:15:15] back care they told you you weren't
[1:15:18] worthy you're not
[1:15:20] able there was a law of
[1:15:23] restoration that said you can go
[1:15:27] back you didn't have to do a
[1:15:29] thing but just stop what you're
[1:15:32] doing I don't care if you had a
[1:15:36] Taskmaster I don't care if you were in
[1:15:39] bondage I don't care if you're working
[1:15:42] at
[1:15:42] McDonald's McDonald but if you had a
[1:15:46] possession you stop what you're
[1:15:50] doing say I'm going
[1:15:52] home going back I don't have to be in
[1:15:56] bondage any
[1:15:58] longer the father has given me is mine
[1:16:03] Oh my he had a right to
[1:16:05] it it was a god-given
[1:16:08] right because he by
[1:16:10] Grace had inherited
[1:16:13] it and it would been given to his
[1:16:16] fathers and handed down year after
[1:16:19] year no matter what had taken
[1:16:23] place if he had lost it
[1:16:26] it must go
[1:16:27] free no matter what had taken place if
[1:16:31] he lost it it must go
[1:16:34] free it meant Grace is a way provided
[1:16:38] for each
[1:16:41] individual to return to their rightful
[1:16:45] inheritance I get maybe a touch more
[1:16:50] monitor he says uh uh and what a picture
[1:16:53] it gives us tonight of the church in
[1:16:55] this last
[1:16:57] days you see what man can
[1:17:00] do and then you see what God
[1:17:03] does oh my we we just really enjoyed
[1:17:06] preaching on these things last
[1:17:09] night see what can
[1:17:11] do man messes everything
[1:17:14] up our
[1:17:17] efforts our abilities our works we just
[1:17:21] mess everything up you see what man can
[1:17:24] do
[1:17:25] but then you see what God can do you see
[1:17:29] what God
[1:17:30] does What man does is
[1:17:33] failing and will fail and has failed and
[1:17:38] always will fail but what God does is
[1:17:42] eternal and must forever
[1:17:45] remain nothing can ever take it
[1:17:49] away I said what God does is
[1:17:52] eternal God does is forever
[1:17:55] ever nothing can ever take it away then
[1:17:59] when your
[1:18:00] name was written on the
[1:18:03] lamb work there ain't no bad works there
[1:18:08] ain't no mistakes there ain't no
[1:18:10] failures there ain't no sin what God
[1:18:14] does is
[1:18:15] forever What man does will fail but when
[1:18:19] he wrote your
[1:18:20] name L's Book of Life there was nothing
[1:18:24] that could take
[1:18:26] and that ought to be enough to make the
[1:18:28] Church of God
[1:18:30] shout be enough to make you have a
[1:18:36] juile what God does is eternal and must
[1:18:40] remain nothing can ever take it
[1:18:43] away hey I can hear myself
[1:18:46] finally God give it it's his free
[1:18:50] gift and his Sovereign foresight solid
[1:18:53] and placed it
[1:18:55] nothing can move
[1:18:58] it
[1:19:01] eternally a jubilee was God's manner of
[1:19:04] expressing Grace to his
[1:19:08] people come on what have we received in
[1:19:11] this
[1:19:12] hour this message is the grace of

[1:19:37] mistakes my
[1:19:39] failures when I was out there in the
[1:19:42] world the prophet of God said you didn't
[1:19:45] Express
[1:19:46] nothing you didn't Express a thing
[1:19:50] because that wasn't who you
[1:19:52] are that's not who you are

[1:21:31] eternally a jubile was God's
[1:21:34] manner of expressing Grace
[1:21:37] to for
[1:21:39] restoring or being brought back to their
[1:21:43] rightful
[1:21:46] position now I believe this is an hour
[1:21:50] again
[1:21:52] Jubilee I believe it's a Time
[1:21:55] of Jubilee this is the hour of
[1:21:59] restoration back to your
[1:22:01] position to your
[1:22:04] inheritance now I like this in verse
[1:22:07] n he says then that you shall cause the
[1:22:09] trumpet of Jubilee to
[1:22:11] [Music]
[1:22:12] sound and on the 10th day of the seven
[1:22:17] month it's marched by the blowing of a
[1:22:22] trumpet re7
[1:22:25] apyp on the
[1:22:27] calendar you know in the Jewish calendar
[1:22:30] they put the the day before the month
[1:22:34] the of the seven month according to
[1:22:38] Revelations
[1:22:39] 10:7 the
[1:22:41] sounding of the seventh Angel's
[1:22:44] voice what is it a sounding of
[1:22:49] your the sounding of Malachi 4
[1:22:54] is the Jubilee TR you can go back you
[1:22:59] don't got to do a
[1:23:01] thing what you're
[1:23:05] doing return
[1:23:08] andile
[1:23:12] Hallelujah
[1:23:14] hallu he says it's the Jubilee is marked
[1:23:17] by the blowing of a
[1:23:21] trumpet I I just want to lay this in
[1:23:23] there for a thought
[1:23:28] a jubilee is two different
[1:23:31] words it it means one of it is is the
[1:23:34] blowing of the
[1:23:38] trumpet or if I can say the breath of it
[1:23:40] it's the actual blowing of the
[1:23:43] trumpet it's the shout or the sound of
[1:23:47] it but the other the other word for
[1:23:50] Jubilee it's the actual trumpet
[1:23:54] and I just want to say no
[1:23:56] trumpet no
[1:23:59] Jubilee no trumpet no
[1:24:03] jubile now the prophet of God would
[1:24:06] show in
[1:24:08] Leviticus how there would be people who
[1:24:10] would get into a walled
[1:24:13] City and if they got all walled
[1:24:16] in and they didn't hear the Jubilee
[1:24:20] sound and they missed
[1:24:22] it they stayed there in
[1:24:27] bondage because they didn't hear
[1:24:31] the now I don't know about
[1:24:34] you but you know in in my
[1:24:37] home and growing
[1:24:40] up there will be a call go
[1:24:42] out dinner is
[1:24:46] ready it's time to
[1:24:48] eat I can't tell you how many times I
[1:24:52] missed dinner
[1:24:55] I can't tell you how many
[1:24:57] times I come out of my office from
[1:25:00] studying and the food all put
[1:25:03] up there ain't no food on the
[1:25:06] table honey where's
[1:25:09] dinner I said dinner was
[1:25:13] ready
[1:25:16] didn't I didn't hear the
[1:25:18] trumpet saying dinner's
[1:25:22] ready it's time to eat
[1:25:25] come and eat is ready but I was all
[1:25:29] walled in I was studying or I was
[1:25:33] listening to something I had headphones
[1:25:35] down and when the Jubilee
[1:25:38] sounded I didn't hear the call I wonder
[1:25:42] Church you all in you hearing the
[1:25:49] Jubilee
[1:25:52] Hallelujah there is is a trumpet of
[1:25:57] Jubilee it's marked by a trumpet
[1:26:01] blowing Revelations
[1:26:04] 107y it's a jubilee to
[1:26:08] [Music]
[1:26:09] you but the prophet of God would make
[1:26:12] this
[1:26:13] statement he would say now a man in his
[1:26:16] family could go
[1:26:19] back to their original heritance
[1:26:24] if they could hear the
[1:26:28] Jubilee and a trumpet
[1:26:31] sound and know what it
[1:26:36] meant it's not just enough to hear
[1:26:39] it you got to know what it
[1:26:42] means not an
[1:26:45] explanation too many message
[1:26:48] Believers have received an
[1:26:52] explanation they let some man tell
[1:26:56] them this is what it
[1:26:58] means I'll tell you what it means this
[1:27:02] is what Malachi 45
[1:27:04] meant I don't see that pattern in the
[1:27:08] Bible in my Bible when Jesus said to his
[1:27:13] disciples and make no
[1:27:16] mistake this message is Jesus Christ
[1:27:21] this message is the person
[1:27:24] almighty God God's grace expressed to
[1:27:28] you for your
[1:27:30] Jubilee I ask you then who do you
[1:27:35] say I the message
[1:27:38] am who do you say
[1:27:42] I well he stood there and said some
[1:27:45] say this preacher said that brother so
[1:27:49] and so said that but who do you
[1:27:52] say I
[1:27:54] the son of man who do you say
[1:27:58] Revelations 10:7 is who do you say
[1:28:02] Malachi
[1:28:03] 45 who do you
[1:28:06] say oh yes he they gave their
[1:28:09] description some say
[1:28:12] you're some say you're a good
[1:28:15] preacher some say you're a
[1:28:19] prophet but who do you say that I
[1:28:22] am he said Thou Are the
[1:28:25] Christ the son of the Living
[1:28:29] God and Jesus looked at him and said
[1:28:32] Peter Flesh and
[1:28:35] Blood I said Flesh and Blood did not
[1:28:39] reveal that to you it wasn't some
[1:28:43] preacher it wasn't your carnal mind it
[1:28:47] some
[1:28:48] theology Peter My Father which is in
[1:28:52] heaven
[1:28:55] has
[1:29:01] revealed this
[1:29:03] rock this
[1:29:06] Revelation I will build my
[1:29:08] church he's the same yesterday today and
[1:29:14] forever who do you say
[1:29:16] I the son of
[1:29:19] man do you know what the Jubilee trumpet
[1:29:22] is saying
[1:29:26] all that Adam has
[1:29:29] lost his
[1:29:32] position has been restored
[1:29:35] back oh we we we could go into countless
[1:29:41] testimonies of how the message was
[1:29:43] manifested in the
[1:29:46] prophet with the power of the spoken
[1:29:49] word you say to the
[1:29:52] mountain not if I I say if you
[1:29:55] say then I ask
[1:29:58] you if this is the Year of
[1:30:01] Jubilee and this is the hour of
[1:30:05] restoration right what's the threefold
[1:30:07] [Music]
[1:30:08] purpose what's to manifest himself in
[1:30:11] Christ
[1:30:12] Jesus then to have preeminence in his
[1:30:15] bride and then take us back to Eden we
[1:30:19] saw a man standing on the Earthen
[1:30:25] condition wind had
[1:30:29] toey
[1:30:31] toey I'm not talking about just Jesus
[1:30:34] Christ I'm talking about a
[1:30:36] redeemed Son of God had been restored
[1:30:40] back to the position that Adam had in
[1:30:43] the beginning where when he
[1:30:47] spoke he
[1:30:49] speaking that wasn't just for the
[1:30:51] prophet that was for you that was a shef
[1:30:55] wave hallelujah what is a she wave we
[1:30:59] know that Christ was the original shef
[1:31:03] wave people
[1:31:05] at is the of
[1:31:10] restoration to the faith the Pentecostal
[1:31:14] Faith thou can't believe if thou can't
[1:31:18] believe all things are
[1:31:21] possible am amen
[1:31:25] where when you speak the
[1:31:29] word when you speak the
[1:31:32] word all of Heaven backs it
[1:31:36] up do you know what the Jubilee trumpet
[1:31:41] means to restore and being brought back
[1:31:44] to your right
[1:31:46] position now I like where this word
[1:31:48] Jubilee or ju in one way it's spelled in
[1:31:51] the Bible Ju j u b i l e
[1:31:57] but the root word for Jubilee comes
[1:32:00] from it means to carry you
[1:32:05] into it means to be
[1:32:08] led now I want you to think of this for
[1:32:10] a
[1:32:11] moment when Israel was in
[1:32:15] bondage uh when when when they were in
[1:32:18] Egypt they started to get into
[1:32:22] desperation they started to cry out for
[1:32:24] a
[1:32:27] deliverance and God sent
[1:32:30] Moses but you see it was God veiling
[1:32:33] himself in a
[1:32:35] man that wasn't a man
[1:32:37] coming that was just the
[1:32:40] veil my Bible tells
[1:32:42] me I am come down to
[1:32:46] deliver I am come down to deler he
[1:32:50] didn't just deliver them he was there to
[1:32:53] to carry
[1:32:55] [Music]
[1:32:57] them come on now he didn't just come to
[1:33:00] set you free and say now I want you to
[1:33:04] find yourself into the
[1:33:05] Rapture he came here to deliver you he
[1:33:09] came here to take you and to carry you
[1:33:13] into the body
[1:33:15] change Christ is here to carry you into
[1:33:21] the rure

[1:33:37] them and beat them and held them in
[1:33:43] bondage when they crossed that Red
[1:33:46] Sea and all of those horse
[1:33:49] riders you can make it spiritual
[1:33:52] too themse fighers started coming after
[1:33:56] him all of a sudden the waves started to

[1:34:00] down and they saw all of their
[1:34:04] enemy was dead you talk about a
[1:34:08] jubilee maram got the tambourine she

[1:35:57] economy I said you're living in the

[1:36:37] hour

[1:36:40] two hours he said just ask just take me

[1:37:00] in he's come to
[1:37:04] deliver he's come here to take you
[1:37:09] into but you got to
[1:37:12] hear the Jubilee
[1:37:14] trumpet and you got to
[1:37:16] know what it
[1:37:18] means now down in Texas we have
[1:37:20] something we call juneth
[1:37:26] and you know I I think about this
[1:37:29] often but you know down in galvaston
[1:37:32] it's it's tucked way down there in Texas
[1:37:34] out on the
[1:37:38] coast and and though the emancipation of
[1:37:41] proclamation had been
[1:37:44] made there's a there was a group of
[1:37:46] slaves that had never heard
[1:37:50] message and we we celebrate this in
[1:37:53] Texas called
[1:37:55] juneth because on June 19th in
[1:38:01] 1865 there was 2,000
[1:38:05] troops that rode into
[1:38:08] gston and they
[1:38:10] announced to more than 250,000
[1:38:15] slaves you're free
[1:38:19] oh you can imagine they heard the rumors
[1:38:23] heard explanations did you hear my
[1:38:26] cousin said over there that they were
[1:38:27] set
[1:38:28] free but they couldn't believe it
[1:38:31] because there was all the task masters
[1:38:34] with their guns and their whips tell
[1:38:36] them you can't go
[1:38:38] nowhere when that Army showed
[1:38:41] up when that Army showed up they came in
[1:38:45] and
[1:38:46] forced and they said don't worry about
[1:38:48] your
[1:38:52] tasm to Proclaim you are free you don't
[1:38:56] got to be in bondage
[1:38:58] anymore there was no slave owner there
[1:39:02] was noas Master nobody could stop them
[1:39:06] slaves and history tells
[1:39:09] us history tells us when they got the
[1:39:13] message that they were free they started
[1:39:16] to dance they started to shout started
[1:39:20] to sing they started to pray started to
[1:39:23] go in
[1:39:24] Jubilee because it was there Jubilee I
[1:39:28] say what about the bride of
[1:39:31] Christ
[1:39:32] People Sing and
[1:39:35] Shout is a people that have heard the
[1:39:42] Jubilee amen amen amen no matter what
[1:39:46] had taken
[1:39:50] place Grace
[1:39:55] Grace is here to tell
[1:39:57] you you can go
[1:40:00] free back to your
[1:40:03] inheritance but you know that Old Devil
[1:40:05] he's just a
[1:40:10] squatter my
[1:40:12] dad bought some
[1:40:15] land down the street from us a
[1:40:19] house he got it for a really good price
[1:40:24] and we found out
[1:40:25] why because I had a
[1:40:30] squatter you getting that right because
[1:40:33] this is
[1:40:36] important so a
[1:40:39] squatter is somebody who stays somewhere
[1:40:43] that's not theirs
[1:40:47] okay so there's a big problem
[1:40:50] nowadays where where people don't pay
[1:40:52] their rent
[1:40:55] and they stay in the
[1:40:57] house rent
[1:40:59] free and when the owner
[1:41:01] comes to evict them out of the
[1:41:04] house they don't
[1:41:06] leave and because of our government
[1:41:10] system there's laws in
[1:41:12] place where they can't kick them
[1:41:16] out they have to go through the
[1:41:19] court they have to go through the
[1:41:21] government well we come to find
[1:41:24] out this guy was living in the
[1:41:26] house he quit paying his
[1:41:30] mortgage and he had been living there
[1:41:32] for like three or four
[1:41:34] years not paying
[1:41:36] anything and so One Bank sold the house
[1:41:40] to another
[1:41:42] bank and that bank couldn't get them
[1:41:45] out that bank sold it to another
[1:41:48] bank and the guy just he he had some uh
[1:41:51] lawyer on retainer
[1:41:54] and every time the system just started
[1:41:57] over but you see they they finally uh uh
[1:42:00] sold the the property
[1:42:04] again and and the cost kept getting
[1:42:06] cheaper and cheaper because nobody could
[1:42:08] get this squatter
[1:42:12] out so it fell our
[1:42:15] lot that that my my dad saw the house
[1:42:18] was for
