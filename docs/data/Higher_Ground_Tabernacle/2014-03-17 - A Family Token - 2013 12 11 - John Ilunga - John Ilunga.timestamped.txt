[3:38] it and I think that will bless
[3:42] you what you want to talk uh tonight is
[3:46] about the
[3:48] Exodus we believe we
[3:51] are in the time of the Third
[3:55] Exodus the first one was just a type
[4:00] and we saw the second one but in the
[4:04] message we have a
[4:08] other but I want to share with you
[4:10] something that's very
[4:13] important and I want to tell you and I
[4:18] want to
[4:20] uh if I can I can call it it's like a a
[4:26] mystery of this fourth
[4:30] step we have a first step we have a
[4:33] second step we have a third one but
[4:36] today I we show you something I can call
[4:39] the mystery of the fourth
[4:45] step it's not a mystery for you but it
[4:48] can be a mystery for outside people but
[4:51] we want to share something very
[4:53] important and I want to go through like
[4:56] a family talk
[5:00] if you see in the message in The Exodus
[5:04] 12 verse 13 it say The Blood we serve as
[5:09] a
[5:10] talken
[5:13] amen
[5:15] and I want to read something from the
[5:17] message but before I want to show that
[5:21] when God sent the prophet to the first
[5:26] Exodus we will see in the message that
[5:30] that
[5:31] Exodus uh two
[5:34] parts the first part was like a
[5:39] preparation but the second part that was
[5:43] the important part was when the token
[5:47] was
[5:49] required Amen in that Exodus we can find
[5:54] two parts in the first part the prophet
[5:58] was trying just to prepare people he
[6:02] came with different kind of messages I
[6:05] say
[6:08] messages and through that preparation
[6:12] period the prophet tried to show a kind
[6:16] of uh miracles signs
[6:20] wonders it was just a preparation period
[6:24] preparation
[6:25] time but the important part of that
[6:29] Exodus
[6:30] was when this token was
[6:34] Reed amen and some sometimes in the
[6:39] message we Overlook that that thing when
[6:43] brother bam came he started for the
[6:47] message of
[6:49] preparation at that time
[6:52] period we saw wonders
[6:56] Miracles but after that time they
[7:01] would have a message we have a different
[7:04] kind of messages but we have a message
[7:09] for the bride
[7:12] amen and I want to share for you that
[7:16] it's very
[7:18] important there is two parts the first
[7:21] part in Exodus everybody can believe
[7:25] it but the second part is just for the
[7:30] bde of that
[7:32] Exodus and if you can see the message of
[7:36] talking was a
[7:39] secret it was a kind of Midnight
[7:46] Cry
[7:50] amen I want to read something in the
[7:57] message before we can continue to talk
[8:00] about it I think everybody

[10:01] but the B say he tried to bring a kind a
[10:04] lot of of
[10:06] messages okay you can go it
[10:11] now and now we come back what kind of
[10:15] now when bam came of the talken message
[10:20] he said now he come if what the church
[10:30] yeah yes you understand there's no more
[10:35] things there he say one thing that the
[10:40] church has got to to
[10:43] do it tried to bring a different kind of
[10:48] messages and we have a bunch of
[10:51] them but there is one
[10:55] message one thing the true church has
[10:59] got to to do is to apply the
[11:06] token okay go ahead
[11:14] now not just to apply the token but said
[11:17] the token must be displayed
[11:21] amen and if the token is
[11:23] displayed we can see there will be a
[11:27] manifestation
[11:32] we have more messages but we have one
[11:36] thing required
[11:40] true brother nothing else would work you
[11:45] say
[11:47] no
[11:49] nothing there's
[11:53] nothing One requirement the token must
[11:56] be
[11:57] displayed we can do whatever we want but
[12:01] the requirement is just one
[12:04] thing that the child has to
[12:09] do
[12:11] okay must be the blood now the holy GH
[12:16] is token you say now the Holy Ghost is
[12:22] the token for us from God Amen it's not
[12:26] something from a church it's not
[12:28] something from a group of people is
[12:31] something God must send us must give us
[12:34] it's a token what's a token but the say
[12:38] the Holy Ghost is the token for us from
[12:45] God only thing only requirement through
[12:50] this message is just the
[12:53] token try this one n six
[13:01] and
[13:02] HB and we we we try to give you the
[13:06] picture
[13:09] now before we
[13:11] continue let me say
[13:14] something brother does not
[13:17] say the bapst of the holy spirit is a
[13:23] talking you understand
[13:26] me I said there is no
[13:30] idea of the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[13:34] they say the Holy Ghost is the token for
[13:40] us from
[13:44] God that's why I say there's a kind of
[13:47] fourth step we already got the message
[13:51] of
[13:55] justification the message of
[13:57] sanctification and the message of the
[14:00] baptis of the Holy
[14:02] Spirit which was just a resoration of
[14:05] the
[14:08] gift but but not relay the token relate
[14:14] the token to the baptism of the Holy
[14:16] Spirit but he say the holy spirit is the
[14:20] token for us amen from God Amen that's
[14:25] what I want you to differentiate
[14:29] the baptism of the Holy Spirit was the
[14:32] message the last
[14:36] message and it was just a kind of
[14:39] restoration of
[14:40] gifts but the token is not the baptism
[14:44] of the ho
[14:46] spirit
[14:50] amen make sure that in the message we
[14:54] have a lot of
[14:57] messages but we get just one message and
[15:02] we can call it the message of the hour
[15:05] the message of the hour Through The
[15:08] Exodus is the token
[15:11] amen no more messages but only one
[15:15] message only requirement for The Exodus
[15:19] is the
[15:22] token and brother Contin say the token
[15:28] is
[15:30] like a
[15:33] bride and a uh and his husband they come
[15:38] together they
[15:41] unite go ahead
[15:44] first I wanted this to read Because
[15:47] sometime in Africa when I tried to do
[15:50] this even message churches it was a very
[15:55] complicated situation for them to
[15:58] understand they difference between the
[16:00] baptism of the Holy Spirit and the Holy
[16:03] Spirit
[16:04] itself the Holy Spirit itself is a token
[16:08] for the
[16:09] bride it's not for everybody it's not
[16:13] for churches even message
[16:15] churches but it's the only requirement
[16:20] experience for the
[16:23] bride we don't have the bride through
[16:27] justification sanctification
[16:30] for the spirit but we gu the bride
[16:33] through the message of the
[16:36] token and if you are here to be the
[16:40] bride that's your your home that's your
[16:45] message you can come to the Tabernacle

[34:12] churches ages they tried to believe that
[34:15] chemistry of the blood when they pray
[34:19] they have a representation of some
[34:22] chemistry red blood of
[34:24] Jesus that Came Upon people
[34:28] we don't believe that kind of
[34:31] religion the
[34:33] blood is the
[34:35] life that us in Christ and that life
[34:40] must be applied on your
[34:43] amen
[34:46] amen
[34:48] sanctification
[34:49] justification baptism of the Holy Spirit
[34:52] they tried to understand they were in
[34:55] another
[34:56] Covenant they
[34:58] of the blood but the bride at the end
[35:02] time they don't have that c
[35:06] again our cant is the life the leral
[35:11] life the True Life of Christ amen must
[35:15] be applied in our
[35:17] life where in our
[35:21] souls amen what's the difference between
[35:25] the bad of the Holy Spirit and the holy
[35:27] Spirit
[35:30] self the baptism of Holy Spirit is just
[35:34] anointing through your spirit
[35:37] amen and that can restore a kind of gift
[35:41] in your
[35:42] life that can restore a kind of ministry
[35:46] that's why I say I don't have anything
[35:50] even if I'm a
[35:51] preacher without the ministry of the
[35:55] Bible because the min Ministry the gifts
[36:00] are just in our
[36:02] SP but the true word The Life of Christ
[36:07] must be applied not in our spirit but in
[36:12] our souls
[36:14] amen we have three parts we have the
[36:17] body we have the spirit we have the
[36:21] soul if you get the experience of the
[36:24] holy spirit in your body you can shake
[36:30] you can show us that you have experience
[36:33] that's
[36:34] fine but we don't believe this kind of
[36:36] stuff
[36:37] again amen you can come to the church
[36:41] the Holy Spirit descend from God and and
[36:46] it's like anointing in your
[36:49] spirit speak in the
[36:51] tong you can
[36:54] preach that can restore gift
[36:58] Ministries but it's not the Holy
[37:02] Spirit the bride has the holy spirit in
[37:06] the soul
[37:08] hallelujah it's it's applied in the
[37:17] soul and
[37:19] tonight everybody if we areon and
[37:23] S we can our what the of our
[37:29] souls if there is not something there
[37:33] I'm not

[37:43] the true life that must be applied in
[37:47] our souls to be the toen and to
