[34:55] man let's just stand and honor the hope
[35:01] get right into the service here good to
[35:03] see everybody here this morning
[35:05] amen here to worship the Lord amen amen
[35:10] we came here for a reason
[35:12] amen we know that God is able to meet
[35:15] with us to heal us to deliver us amen to
[35:21] to bind up the brokenhearted amen to set
[35:24] the captives free his spirit is here
[35:27] Amen where two or three are gathered in
[35:29] his name Amen so let's just open our
[35:32] Bibles to Genesis first chapter
[35:40] and from there we'll go to psalms 133
[35:48] and Genesis 1 in second verse it says
[35:56] and the earth was without form and void
[36:02] and darkness was upon the face of the
[36:06] deep and the Spirit of God moved upon
[36:10] the face of the waters amen amen now
[36:16] stir her to psalms 133
[36:28] for either
[36:30] all three verses of the chapter Psalms
[36:34] 133 says behold how good and how
[36:37] pleasant it is for brethren to dwell
[36:40] together in unity it is like the
[36:43] precious ointment upon the head that ran
[36:46] down upon the beard even Aaron's beard
[36:49] that went down to the skirts of his
[36:51] garments and as the dew of Hermon and as
[36:55] the dew that descend upon the mountains
[36:56] of Zion for there the LORD commanded the
[37:00] blessing even life forevermore amen
[37:04] let's just bow our heads and word of
[37:06] Prayer Heavenly Father we just want to
[37:08] thank you Lord for coming into this
[37:09] place Lord we just invite you here Lord
[37:12] Lu the last Lord that you would be
[37:13] comfortable here Lord Lord we we we we
[37:18] give you the highest place Lord we bow
[37:20] down in your sight father floor we do
[37:23] not count ourselves worthy of your
[37:25] presence father but knowing Lord that
[37:27] you made the promise Lord that if we
[37:29] would just come and hide underneath your
[37:31] wings Lord if we would just come and
[37:32] hide underneath your blood or did you
[37:34] come and have fellowship with us one
[37:36] with the other and Laura saw oh and
[37:38] underneath that promise father we
[37:40] gathered here this morning there where
[37:42] two or three are gathered in your name
[37:43] you said you'd be right there in the
[37:45] myths and or that is the promise that we
[37:47] gather together underneath this morning
[37:49] father
[37:49] and we'll always want to thank you for
[37:51] coming into this place if we turn the
[37:53] entire service over your hands knowing
[37:54] that when you come you heal and you
[37:57] deliver and you set free Lorna you
[37:59] commune one with us or Lord you fill
[38:02] with your holy spirit father and slowly
[38:04] just and thank you Lord come to this
[38:06] place and we just give you the highest
[38:08] preeminence in the name of Jesus Christ
[38:10] we pray amen amen you can be seated
[38:17] amen I just wanted to speak a message
[38:19] this morning called
[38:20] the brooding of the Holy Spirit
[38:26] amen amen you know the Lord said in
[38:31] Revelations he said the spirit and the
[38:33] bride say come
[38:35] amen the spirit and the bride are both
[38:39] saying come come
[38:42] well where is he calling us to a many
[38:46] for the spirit and the bride to say come
[38:49] there must be somewhere that we are that
[38:52] he doesn't necessarily want us to be
[38:54] there anymore but wants to call us out
[38:56] of that into something else
[38:58] amen so in when God begins calling he
[39:02] has a place he wasn't he has a place
[39:04] where you are and a place where he wants
[39:06] to take you to Amen so so when God
[39:09] begins calling and it's just like there
[39:12] in Genesis chapter 1 when he when the
[39:14] Holy Spirit was brooding over the face
[39:16] of the waters the earth was in a certain
[39:19] condition and he began calling to that
[39:22] earth began speaking out to that earth
[39:24] because the earth was then somewhere
[39:26] where he didn't want that earth to be a
[39:28] menace why did God do he started
[39:30] speaking to the earth he started calling
[39:33] out to the earth as we said last week
[39:34] God put his word into the earth and what
[39:37] the plants sprung up out of the earth
[39:39] they meant as the as God put his word in
[39:42] the waters the fish started springing
[39:45] out amen
[39:46] but his God began to put his word down
[39:48] into the himself and say let us free
[39:51] forth what he create his own self amen
[39:54] turn the piano note yeah
[39:57] [Music]
[39:58] Amen so is so as God begins calling out
[40:02] he has he do he takes things he sees
[40:04] where they are he says I don't want that
[40:08] to be there I don't want that to be in
[40:11] that condition so he speaks to it and he
[40:13] calls to it and as his word goes out it
[40:16] goes out and is and when and when
[40:18] whatever it is he's speaking to if he's
[40:20] speaking to a person when that person
[40:22] begins to receive that word that person
[40:26] begins moving from where they are on the
[40:30] direction to where God wants him to be
[40:32] why because there was a willing heart
[40:34] there that was willing to receive the
[40:37] word of God amen
[40:38] when a willing heart begins to receive
[40:41] the Word of God it begins moving from
[40:43] where it is to where God has in his mind
[40:47] for it to be a man we saw that in the
[40:49] creation of the world where God saw the
[40:52] world was it a condition he didn't want
[40:55] the world to be in the condition that it
[40:57] was a man so he started speaking to it
[41:00] and because the earth was willing to
[41:02] receive the word the earth the earth now
[41:06] now Mars didn't receive that word yo and
[41:10] we and man as as scratching their heads
[41:13] trying to figure out how can we get
[41:14] there to live on Mars what can we do and
[41:16] you know if we get this machine and this
[41:19] machine and in this machine and all the
[41:21] things and why because God's Word didn't
[41:24] go there that's why we're all in all of
[41:28] our intelligence we haven't figured out
[41:29] yet how to get there and survive why
[41:32] because God's Word didn't go there God's
[41:34] Word came here amen and that's why this
[41:36] earth is a fit place to live because
[41:38] God's Word came here amen but now also
[41:42] but God's Word there in Revelation said
[41:44] the spirit and the bride are saying come
[41:46] amen now that's why I am here this
[41:48] morning
[41:49] amen because someone looked at me and
[41:52] said come amen someone looked at me one
[41:55] day they looked at me and they said come
[41:58] and when I looked at that that man was
[42:01] brother Keith brother Keith looked me in
[42:04] the face one day and he said come and
[42:06] when he sent spoke to me I knew that
[42:09] what he was saying he wasn't just saying
[42:12] come over to lunch yeah I knew he wasn't
[42:14] speaking there but when he spoke to me
[42:16] in the vestibule the church that I was
[42:18] attending he said come my mind
[42:20] immediately went to that scripture in
[42:22] Revelations that he was not just speed
[42:25] and mention that scripture but in my
[42:27] mind's eye I knew exactly that he was
[42:29] referring not to some natural coming to
[42:33] this event or coming to that event but
[42:35] that he was speaking from Revelation
[42:36] chapter 22 there where the spirit and
[42:38] the bride say come and brother Keith
[42:40] said to me that day come and I can't and
[42:44] Here I am Amen what happened the word
[42:47] came out of brother Keith's mouth unto
[42:50] me and I came
[42:52] and Here I am a man now I am saying to
[42:55] anybody here if you have not come yet
[42:57] let me say to you this morning come come
[43:00] why because there is a place where if
[43:03] you're not where you're supposed to be
[43:05] then let me speak to you this morning
[43:06] come why because God has a place he
[43:10] wants you to be amen and it's not over
[43:13] here it's over here amen if you're not
[43:16] over here yet then then by the speaking
[43:18] of the word it would get you from this
[43:20] place over to this place amen and what I
[43:23] know how did God do it in the beginning
[43:24] he did it by the brooding of the Holy
[43:26] Spirit they meant the very first step
[43:31] God created the heavens and the earth
[43:32] but God looked upon the earth and it was
[43:35] not in the condition he wanted it to be
[43:37] now God has created you are you in the
[43:42] condition that you ought to be in yet
[43:44] and we look down at our own selves and
[43:47] we say oh my I got this wrong of this
[43:50] that I do I do this it's not right we're
[43:52] not in the condition that God wants us
[43:56] to be so what does the Holy Spirit do
[43:58] when he finds a body whether it be a
[44:00] planet or a human being what does God do
[44:03] and he finds a body that's not in the
[44:04] condition that he wants it to be in he
[44:06] starts brooding over brooding over it
[44:10] brooding over the Holy Spirit just
[44:12] begins moving across the face moving
[44:14] around it and what does he do he starts
[44:16] speaking his word to it speaking his
[44:18] word to it
[44:19] why because he wants it to be changed
[44:21] transformed into the image of what he
[44:24] has in his mind amen and that's what
[44:27] he's doing the smart a mess so we read
[44:29] there in psalms 133 behold how good and
[44:33] how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell
[44:36] together in unity that's interesting cuz
[44:40] he's talking about two brothers two
[44:41] Christians a mint if you would to
[44:44] Christians and wonder they're both
[44:46] spirit-led believers of Jehovah amen and
[44:51] how good how pleasant it is for them to
[44:53] dwell together in unity what happens
[44:55] when two brethren start fellowshiping
[44:58] one with the other over the Word of God
[45:02] I'm on your way no when a one brother
[45:05] starts to fellowship with another
[45:06] brother all sin your heart begins
[45:08] burning within you you start talking
[45:10] about the Word of God and your heart and
[45:12] your mind gets excited why because you
[45:15] have things in common
[45:16] your fellowshipping over the word you
[45:18] guys start getting exciting your blurb
[45:20] and said you know some of the read one
[45:21] of the reasons why we don't have why
[45:23] Jesus doesn't come around us as much as
[45:26] we like him is because we don't talk
[45:27] about him enough amen B says the more
[45:30] you talk about him the more he comes
[45:34] Amen the more you talk about the Lord
[45:36] Jesus Christ the more he will visit you
[45:38] Amen lot of us don't see him in our
[45:40] houses very often and angels don't visit
[45:43] our places very often why because we
[45:45] don't talk about him enough amen but the
[45:48] more we talk about him the more we
[45:50] fellowship with them the more that he
[45:52] will come and visit our house amen
[45:55] so what so the more so there in Saul's
[45:58] 1:33 Jesus or the Lord talked about King
[46:03] David's writing there behold how good is
[46:05] for unpleasant is for brethren to dwell
[46:07] together in unity he says it is like the
[46:10] precious ointment upon the head that ran
[46:13] down upon the beard even Aaron's beard
[46:15] that went down to the skirts of his
[46:18] garments now why is it that two men
[46:21] fellow should be one with the other
[46:23] is just like a high priest being
[46:26] anointed to go into the holiest of
[46:28] holies why is why is King David linking
[46:32] these things two things together amen
[46:35] so think about who hears air in the high
[46:37] priests he's being prepared to go into
[46:41] the holiest of Holies amen now that
[46:44] morning he woke up in his tent right he
[46:49] woke up in his tent where he is home
[46:51] where he lived and as he woke up that
[46:54] morning he realized this is the day the
[46:57] one day a year that I go in with the
[47:00] blood of the lamb to to make the
[47:03] sacrifice for the sins of the nation
[47:05] once here and as he gets up out of bed
[47:09] he puts his garments upon it he knows
[47:12] that this is a solemn day and he has to
[47:14] go in to go
[47:16] to begin to prepare the service of the
[47:18] Lord hey man so as he goes in he begins
[47:20] he and he leaves his tent door and he
[47:23] walks down across the road there and he
[47:26] goes up to the to the tabernacle in the
[47:29] in the wilderness there and he parts the
[47:33] opens the curtain doors and he goes into
[47:35] the courtyard there what's he doing he's
[47:37] getting ready to fellowship with the
[47:39] Lord amen he's getting ready to
[47:42] fellowship with the Lord amen so what
[47:44] does he do he has to go into the outer
[47:45] court yes how the the the lamb has to be
[47:49] prepared the lamb has to be sacrificed
[47:51] lamb has to be ready a man he has to go
[47:53] to the brazen altar he has to wash he
[47:55] has to get prepared amen so then he has
[47:58] to go into the holy place he has to draw
[47:59] another curtain back amen and as he
[48:02] draws that curtain back he goes in there
[48:04] he's like he's fellowshipping he's he
[48:06] has the the manna is there he can eat
[48:08] the word he can he can worship in the
[48:11] church amen he can he can be there it
[48:14] protected from the elements you know as
[48:16] we've all heard the the steps the steps
[48:19] of a believer but then he prepares to go
[48:22] into the Holy of Holies he has to change
[48:25] his garments they meant he's got to be
[48:28] washed he's got to be changed he puts on
[48:32] the priestly garments he's got to be a
[48:34] prayer to go in to meet Joba amen he has
[48:37] to have the anointing oil upon him now
[48:40] when they anointed some well they didn't
[48:42] just put a little cup or just put a
[48:46] little dab on no but they took the holy
[48:49] anointing oil and they poured it upon
[48:53] his head and it ran down and it covered
[48:55] him amen now you remember that holy
[48:58] anointing oil I know if I preached about
[48:59] it in the past but when when when God
[49:02] gave them this recipe for the holy
[49:05] anointing oil he said this is a very
[49:08] specific recipe amen and when you make
[49:12] this it wasn't just olive oil but it was
[49:14] a very specific recipe and God says I
[49:18] want you to take a little bit of this
[49:19] and a little bit of this and a little
[49:22] bit of this and a little bit of this and
[49:24] this you get you know the cinnamon that
[49:26] would come from a hundred miles over
[49:27] here you know on the calamus okay
[49:29] from 100 miles over this direction and
[49:31] you get this from this field that grows
[49:33] off over here and from the whole
[49:35] boundaries around Israel they had to go
[49:38] and gather all these precious spices and
[49:43] things and gathering from all over the
[49:46] land and bring them into one place and
[49:49] prepare them in a certain way and mix it
[49:52] together and he said and God told them
[49:54] you cannot cannot have this specific
[49:58] recipe in your own house you can't try
[50:01] to make this in your own kitchen but you
[50:03] can only make it right here in the holy
[50:05] place that's the only place this recipe
[50:08] can be used amen so so when so an errand
[50:11] would go there and he'd be anointed and
[50:14] they'd cover him with that holy
[50:15] anointing oil it had a particular odor
[50:17] that no one could smell anywhere else
[50:20] amen and create a specific atmosphere
[50:23] that couldn't be recreated anywhere else
[50:26] amen because if you tried to recreate
[50:28] that that holy anointing oil and bring
[50:31] it into your own house and use it in
[50:32] your own house you could be judged for
[50:35] that you could be put to death for that
[50:36] amen why because this is a specific a
[50:40] specific recipe that God said this is
[50:42] only for the house the boy for the forth
[50:48] for the Levites amen so an errand would
[50:50] go in and get prepared and change his
[50:53] garments amen and be washed and ready to
[50:56] go into the holy place you'd be anointed
[50:58] with this holy anointing oil amen was he
[51:01] - he's getting ready to fellowship with
[51:02] Jehovah okay let's turn over to Psalms
[51:06] 91 think about it he's getting ready you
[51:13] wakes up that morning I am getting ready
[51:15] to fellowship with Jehovah what would
[51:19] that feel like what Mike you think about
[51:21] I'm gonna go through there I know it's
[51:23] been in those curtains in a year they
[51:26] meant we're getting ready to fellowship
[51:29] with Jehovah
[51:33] ninety-one verse one says he that
[51:36] dwelleth in the secret place of the Most
[51:39] High shall abide under the shadow of the
[51:43] Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my
[51:47] refuge in my fortress my god in him will
[51:51] I trust amen now I think I he that
[51:54] dwelleth in the secret place and the
[51:55] Most High God shall abide under the
[51:57] shadow of the Almighty that just does
[52:00] something to your soul when you read
[52:02] that doesn't it but think about but that
[52:04] was just for the high priest but the
[52:06] high priest as he was anointed with this
[52:09] holy anointing oil that down generation
[52:12] after generation here the tabernacle the
[52:13] wilderness and you had the tabernacle at
[52:15] Shiloh then you had the temple of David
[52:18] almost all those times it was only to
[52:20] the priests they were allowed to go into
[52:22] that holy place amen but God had a
[52:25] special way for them to approach into
[52:28] there but when when all those
[52:31] generations that they had that holy
[52:33] anointing oil all those generation after
[52:36] generation it was only allowed to be one
[52:39] place the anointing was only allowed to
[52:42] be one place if you were part of the
[52:45] tribe of Zebulun you couldn't have the
[52:47] holy anointing what amen yeah you
[52:50] couldn't enter into the holy suppose you
[52:52] couldn't enter into the holy place amen
[52:55] if you if you if Aaron the high priest
[52:57] would walk by you and you could smell
[53:00] that odor or you draw eyes I've never
[53:03] smelled that before I think I know where
[53:06] he's been Amen why because he had been
[53:10] fellowshiping with Jehovah amen and when
[53:15] he fellowship with Jehovah it changed
[53:18] his entire beam amen it changed him why
[53:22] because you cannot meet face to face
[53:24] with God without being changed
[53:26] he had been fellowshiping with Jehovah
[53:28] Amen and then oh that holy anointing oil
[53:31] would soak into your skin and that wood
[53:33] couldn't necessarily just be washed off
[53:35] so easily Amen so the whole day if he
[53:38] walked by someone you know the next day
[53:40] that odor could still be there you could
[53:42] still smell either where have you been
[53:45] where
[53:47] have you been I I that I've never
[53:49] smelled that before where have you been
[53:52] who who have you been fellowshiping with
[53:54] I've been in the holey Cipolla place I
[53:57] was in where the Shekinah presence of
[54:00] the Lord is I bore the sacrifice for the
[54:02] sins of Israel amen that yours your sins
[54:05] have been taken care of a man but you
[54:08] know that how many times you know from
[54:10] from that time from the from the time of
[54:15] the Tabernacle in the wilderness all the
[54:17] way to King Davis time those hundreds
[54:19] and hundreds of years that the holy
[54:22] anointing oil could not leave the
[54:24] tabernacle there all of a sudden one day
[54:26] that God 500 years after that pattern
[54:29] being the same the same the same the
[54:32] same the same that the that the the
[54:34] prophet Samuel is just going about his
[54:39] business there and God speaks to him and
[54:43] says go and take the Horn of oil and
[54:49] leave the tabernacle now this is an
[54:53] unusual circumstance amen when God spoke
[54:57] to the prophet Samuel and say go and
[54:59] take that Horn of oil and leave the
[55:02] tabernacle taking a waste where the high
[55:06] priest would use it and go down to
[55:10] Bethlehem five miles journey away and go
[55:13] down unto the house of Jesse something
[55:17] unusual is happening God was not just
[55:20] going to fellowship with the high priest
[55:24] but God had picked a man by the name of
[55:27] David that he wanted to fellowship with
[55:30] amen so he said go down to the house of
[55:33] Jesse and anoint a man by the name when
[55:37] one of his sons Amen and he goes down
[55:39] there and he lines up you know the
[55:41] eleven sons as he remember the story and
[55:43] and and samuel the prophet samuel look
[55:45] or as a Nathaniel Samuel Samuel I was
[55:50] looking at the signs that said and
[55:52] looked at him and said it's none of
[55:53] these you know and they bring David and
[55:55] he's off from the field they say well go
[55:57] get him and they bring David in and
[56:00] and the prophecy says this is the one
[56:02] that God desires to fellowship with this
[56:05] is the one that God has called it this
[56:07] is the one that the Holy Spirit wants is
[56:09] brooding over right now or is it God
[56:12] went and picked the David and says I
[56:16] have called him by name
[56:18] he is mine he's the Holy Spirit is now
[56:21] brooding over him he's taking it from
[56:24] where he is to change him into what he
[56:26] wants them to be and Samuel the Prophet
[56:28] same Allah takes the Horn oil and pours
[56:30] it over him it hits his head and it runs
[56:33] down his if he had a beard I don't know
[56:35] if he did that age probably not he runs
[56:37] down his face and he goes all the way
[56:39] down all the skirts and he's oh my
[56:41] I've been anointed I've been anointed
[56:46] what is it it's the Holy Spirit that
[56:49] brooded over the world back in the
[56:51] beginning has now hand-picked a man by
[56:53] the name David and says I want to
[56:55] fellowship with you I have been anointed
[57:00] just like the high priests of old now I
[57:03] who has never had a chance to be a high
[57:05] priest now I have been anointed
[57:08] God wanted to fellowship with someone a
[57:11] man that's why now again now David he
[57:14] takes these songs and he's Lincoln and
[57:16] he says just looing how pleasant is for
[57:19] men to fellowship one with the other
[57:21] whether they fellowship being in the
[57:22] spirit the holy spirit that's brooding
[57:25] over this man and the same Holy Spirit
[57:27] the broods over this man when those two
[57:29] men get together and they fellowship one
[57:31] to the other you begin to feel the
[57:33] effects of the Holy Spirit
[57:35] fellowshipping with the Holy Spirit amen
[57:38] God communing with himself through you
[57:41] oh my then you begin to realize that I
[57:45] am a son or a daughter of God amen amen
[57:51] how good pleasant is for men to
[57:54] fellowship and unity not one in doctrine
[57:58] not one in going to the same church but
[58:02] one that fellowships in the same spirit
[58:05] united by the same Holy Ghost amen amen
[58:09] when you realize that your brother is
[58:12] handpicked by God
[58:14] just like you were hand-picked by God
[58:15] and you could fellowship one with
[58:17] another Amen you know but you know what
[58:21] can block that fellowship you know like
[58:23] we reach people in the past about the
[58:25] leprosy in the Old Testament you know
[58:27] when a man was stricken with leprosy
[58:29] they had to take him outside of the camp
[58:31] a man he couldn't fellowship he was
[58:33] separated from fellowship with the camp
[58:35] amen
[58:36] and so is it like a man and women when
[58:39] they sent if you do not take care of the
[58:41] sin in your life and that sin is crying
[58:43] out and then you cannot fellowship one
[58:47] with the other
[58:48] amen amen how can the Holy Spirit
[58:51] fellowship one with the other when the
[58:53] sin blocks it amen
[58:54] sin separates you from fellowship a man
[58:58] what is that the horse Pharaoh wants to
[58:59] brood over you why because God wants to
[59:02] fellowship with himself amen God was to
[59:06] fellowship with his own kind amen you
[59:09] know we can we can have dogs and pets
[59:12] and different things like that but it's
[59:13] not like fellowshiping with your own
[59:17] kind
[59:17] amen and so is with God he wants to
[59:20] fellowship with his own kind you know
[59:23] his heart his thoughts are higher than
[59:25] our thoughts but when he puts his
[59:27] thoughts inside of you and puts his
[59:30] spear inside of you they began to you
[59:32] begin to think like God thinks Amen when
[59:35] you get anointed you can be when you get
[59:36] start being led by the Holy Ghost you
[59:38] begin thinking like God thinks a man
[59:41] you've been speaking God's words but you
[59:44] can only do that when you're filled with
[59:46] the Holy Ghost amen
[59:50] Alleluia you know brother band says that
[59:54] we only live in a three-room house you
[59:58] got the kitchen you got the bedroom and
[1:00:02] you got the living room and program he
[1:00:04] said you know when when when a sinner
[1:00:08] comes he comes into the kitchen he hears
[1:00:11] the Word of God amen he be he eat he's
[1:00:15] eating the Word of God and he begins to
[1:00:18] be changed from the sinner that he is so
[1:00:21] what so he can now fellowship with God
[1:00:23] he can have fellowship one with the
[1:00:26] other so he goes into the living room
[1:00:28] in the kitchen to the living room even
[1:00:29] fellowshiping one with the other amen
[1:00:32] but you know you know what but the
[1:00:34] bedroom is where people rest right amen
[1:00:38] as much community as you can have amen
[1:00:41] the the the you can commune with God in
[1:00:44] the living room but after a while it's
[1:00:46] time to go home and you have to leave
[1:00:48] amen but those that go to the bedroom
[1:00:51] are testifying this is my house
[1:00:53] this is where I live this is where I
[1:00:56] dwell now you can come to my house and
[1:00:58] you can eat in my kitchen you can you
[1:01:00] can commune with me am I am I in my
[1:01:03] living room but you know I don't invite
[1:01:05] just anybody to come and sleep in my bed
[1:01:09] that's designed for my bride a mess
[1:01:12] designed for my wife that's where my
[1:01:14] wife rests that's where I rest amen
[1:01:16] that's where we take our rest amen
[1:01:19] that's where we live and you can come
[1:01:21] you can dwell but the bed there's for me
[1:01:23] amen amen no I don't mind if you come
[1:01:26] and stay in my guest bedroom but but uh
[1:01:30] now think about it now but the time
[1:01:33] comes where that person has to go home
[1:01:35] I've had many visitors come to my house
[1:01:37] I've had some spend the night but
[1:01:38] they've all at some point gone home amen
[1:01:44] bus but when you come into the bedroom
[1:01:47] you're testifying this is where I live
[1:01:49] this is where I dwell this is where I
[1:01:52] live and move and have my beam amen and
[1:01:55] even so is it with God when you when you
[1:01:58] when you hear the word of God you invite
[1:02:01] Jesus into your kitchen amen you
[1:02:05] received that word you eat that word you
[1:02:08] see you're in agreement with it
[1:02:09] amen it was a do it allows you to go
[1:02:11] into the living room we start communing
[1:02:13] with God but at some point the Holy
[1:02:16] Spirit is still brooding over you and
[1:02:18] what does the Holy Spirit trying to do
[1:02:20] he wants to find a place where he can
[1:02:22] rest amen now think about it the Holy
[1:02:26] Spirit back in Genesis was brooding over
[1:02:28] the dark earth over the waters but there
[1:02:31] was no place he could land there was no
[1:02:33] place he could rest there's no place he
[1:02:35] could put his feet so when he started
[1:02:36] speaking to the waters and the earth
[1:02:39] came out and now there was a place where
[1:02:40] he could rest
[1:02:41] amen then what'd he do he kept brooding
[1:02:44] and brooding over the earth and told
[1:02:45] there was a garden called Eden amen and
[1:02:48] once that Garden of Eden was created
[1:02:49] what'd he do he took the tree of life
[1:02:51] and he planted it there and this is
[1:02:54] where the tree of life Jesus Christ
[1:02:56] lived amen this is where he took up
[1:02:59] house this is where he put down his
[1:03:00] roots amen this is where he what was
[1:03:03] this is where he dwelt this is where the
[1:03:05] tree of life was was in the garden the
[1:03:06] hoist spirit that was brooding now has
[1:03:09] found a place to take rest take root
[1:03:12] this is where it stays he had found the
[1:03:15] bedroom of the planet Earth the Garden
[1:03:19] of Eden was the bedroom a planet Earth
[1:03:22] it was a place where his shelter it was
[1:03:25] separate from the rest of the earth it
[1:03:27] was a sitz own place and so God put his
[1:03:30] Tree of Life right there so it could
[1:03:33] take roots that was the Holy Spirit when
[1:03:35] Noah's when Noah's we know is told to
[1:03:38] build the ark he was building the ark
[1:03:40] and building the ark and building the
[1:03:42] ark and but one day all of a sudden a
[1:03:44] little dove a pair of doves flew up and
[1:03:48] asked can I come in here and stay and
[1:03:51] take my rest and he's told the doves you
[1:03:54] know come on in and the holy spirit like
[1:03:58] a dove was in the ark amen so in so when
[1:04:02] when the flood covered all over a whole
[1:04:05] face of the earth
[1:04:06] a man Noah took the Dove and he sang out
[1:04:09] the window and the Holy Spirit the dog
[1:04:11] was going over the earth and it could
[1:04:13] not find any place to rest so it came
[1:04:16] back to the earth the Dove was looking
[1:04:18] for a place to rest but it could not
[1:04:20] find a place they meant who happened in
[1:04:23] the time of John the Baptist this the
[1:04:26] the voice came to him and said go and
[1:04:30] baptize and prepare a people for the
[1:04:33] coming of the Lord and make people make
[1:04:36] the people ready for the coming of the
[1:04:37] Lord and then later that same voice came
[1:04:40] and said the the the one that was
[1:04:43] promised to come will come and he and he
[1:04:46] will be the one that you see the Holy
[1:04:48] Spirit descending upon like a dove and
[1:04:50] when you see the Holy Spirit descending
[1:04:52] upon the one that descends upon
[1:04:55] that's the one that you baptized that's
[1:04:57] the one who that's the one who is the
[1:04:59] Christ amen that'll save his people
[1:05:01] Israel I saw John the Baptist's going
[1:05:04] around that day he's baptizing people
[1:05:06] get him ready getting ready getting
[1:05:07] ready and all sunny sees Jesus Christ
[1:05:10] says this is the Lamb of God it takes
[1:05:12] away the sins of the world this is the
[1:05:14] one that I saw in the spirit descend
[1:05:16] upon like enough was that the Holy
[1:05:18] Spirit had been brooding even visiting
[1:05:21] all the prophets they've been visiting
[1:05:23] the kings he'd been visiting men and
[1:05:26] women throughout all the Old Testament
[1:05:27] but he could not find a place to rest so
[1:05:30] every time the Holy Spirit came to visit
[1:05:33] someone like a Hannah was was praying
[1:05:36] and praying for a child remember amen
[1:05:38] but then someone came and visitor and
[1:05:41] healed her but that one the visitor left
[1:05:44] amen like Gideon you know he's talking
[1:05:48] to this person also he hasn't realized
[1:05:50] after he leaves that I was talking to
[1:05:53] God himself amen
[1:05:56] Abraham you know is talking to those the
[1:06:00] the three there and also me was really
[1:06:01] one is Jehovah but they left they came
[1:06:06] they visit and they left but that's how
[1:06:08] the Old Testament was there was
[1:06:09] visitation after visitation after
[1:06:11] visitation but every time they left but
[1:06:14] the Holy Spirit who been brooding over
[1:06:15] all the Old Testament now I come to
[1:06:18] Jesus Christ the Tree of Life and have
[1:06:21] found a place where he could rest and
[1:06:25] the voice told the voice told John the
[1:06:28] Baptist the one that you see the Holy
[1:06:30] Spirit descending upon and remaining on
[1:06:33] that is my son so it's not just the one
[1:06:42] that the Holy Spirit comes and visits
[1:06:43] it's not just the one that has a dream
[1:06:46] not just the one that has a vision not
[1:06:49] just the one that that God answers one
[1:06:51] of your prayers it's not just one who
[1:06:53] had chills going up and down their back
[1:06:55] it's not just one that that you maybe
[1:06:57] you have a religious mindset where you
[1:07:00] just like being a religious it's not
[1:07:02] just the ones that that enjoy going to
[1:07:05] church amen it's not just the one where
[1:07:08] the Holy Spirit
[1:07:09] and he goes where you feel good here in
[1:07:11] church but then you go home and you live
[1:07:13] any old kind of way that's not the kind
[1:07:15] we're talking about no the hoist bear is
[1:07:16] still brooding amen but the Holy Spirit
[1:07:18] is brooding over a people and he's
[1:07:21] looking for a place where he could stay
[1:07:22] and rest
[1:07:23] amen the Holy Spirit is brooding and
[1:07:26] once I have a place where he can rest
[1:07:30] where he can live where he can stay the
[1:07:33] one that you see that's what he told
[1:07:35] John the Baptist the one that you see
[1:07:37] the Holy Spirit descending upon and
[1:07:39] remaining on that is the Son of God amen
[1:07:44] well we're still looking for sons and
[1:07:46] daughters of God aren't we amen and they
[1:07:49] are the ones that the Holy Spirit
[1:07:50] descends upon and her beans amen repent
[1:07:55] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:07:57] Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift
[1:08:00] of the Holy Ghost amen for the promises
[1:08:03] unto you and to your children and even
[1:08:05] as many as the Lord your God shall call
[1:08:06] why because the Holy Spirit has been
[1:08:09] brooding and he's now wants to rest in
[1:08:12] you the same Holy Spirit from for 6,000
[1:08:16] years that's been brooding that brood
[1:08:17] over the planet that brooded in Noah's
[1:08:20] day that brooded over Jesus Christ that
[1:08:22] brooded over the hundred and twenty that
[1:08:24] same Holy Spirit is still here what she
[1:08:26] wants to do he wants to fellowship one
[1:08:27] with the other amen that's why when you
[1:08:31] talk about him he draws near because he
[1:08:34] wants to stay there he wants to dwell
[1:08:37] there
[1:08:37] Amen he wants to live and move and then
[1:08:39] you have the beam amen amen you know I
[1:08:45] just I was thinking about the the
[1:08:48] effects the Holy Spirit on your life you
[1:08:52] know the you know I got I got a new
[1:08:54] company truck and I didn't have my CDs

[1:09:04] so I can listen I'm driving around from
[1:09:06] place to place and listen to the
[1:09:09] messages and so I turned on the talk
[1:09:13] radio and what a week to be listening to

[1:09:19] and you know I used to listen to
[1:09:22] politics a lot as a teenager and I

[1:09:37] that but over time of a few years you
[1:09:42] know freshmen aged 1618 of listening to

[1:09:53] things you know and and you know when
[1:09:56] you think about you know the different
[1:09:59] types of conspiracies that are out there

[1:10:05] different things of liberals versus the
[1:10:09] conservatives and all the political
[1:10:11] things that go on in our country those
[1:10:13] things are out there to make you angry
[1:10:16] and to make you fearful amen if you
[1:10:21] listen to that long enough you will be
[1:10:23] angry and fearful a many others I was so
[1:10:28] I spent kind of a week I just listened
[1:10:31] to the talk radio and and and

[1:11:01] them do unto you then a lot of this
[1:11:04] would just melt to the ground like it's
[1:11:06] so quick quicker than anything Amen you
[1:11:09] know if the Holy Spirit could find a
[1:11:11] place to rest and our Congress right now
[1:11:13] or in the Senate chambers or in the
[1:11:16] judiciary chamber if the Holy Spirit
[1:11:18] could brood over that chamber and find

[1:20:08] passport I could go and I could visit
[1:20:10] another country but then I can come back

[1:20:35] mind is as gone because it has has left
[1:20:39] the presence of Jehovah I have a pass
[1:20:41] where I can come right back to it how do
[1:20:43] I come back to it by entering into the

[1:20:47] blood of the Lamb

[1:20:56] amen and be healed and live where I'm
[1:20:59] supposed to live amen the Holy Spirit is
[1:21:01] still brooding over man and women
[1:21:04] looking for a place where he can live
[1:21:05] where he can rest amen and he wants to
[1:21:10] live and rest in you and it gives you
[1:21:12] this privilege of living here on this
[1:21:16] world you're in this world but your
[1:21:17] honor of this world
[1:21:18] amen I can it's like when when the
[1:21:22] resurrection happened in the time of
[1:21:24] Jesus and the graves were open and many
[1:21:28] of the saints of old were seen walking
[1:21:31] around the city they might not have
[1:21:35] liked what the Roman government was
[1:21:36] doing amen you know him Abraham's like
[1:21:40] you know what this Roman government's a
[1:21:42] little bit different than they were this
[1:21:44] place was just a wilderness you know but
[1:21:48] I don't have to stay here
[1:21:50] amen I got a promise Amen this thing the
[1:21:54] things of this world are just temporary
[1:21:56] amen the way to eat Abraham when he was
[1:21:59] resurrected in the time of Jesus Christ
[1:22:01] had a ticket out of there amen he was
[1:22:04] seen about the city but he didn't have
[1:22:05] to stay in the city a man he knew he is
[1:22:08] going to another place Amen so are we
[1:22:11] we're going to another place this world
[1:22:14] is not our home we're just a passin
[1:22:17] through
[1:22:17] amen amen
[1:22:20] a man we've been filled with the Holy
[1:22:23] Ghost we've been washed in the blood of
[1:22:25] the Lamb we've been called the
[1:22:28] fellowship one with the other amen
[1:22:31] it's like if you're over in another
[1:22:32] country and you find so you meet someone
[1:22:35] who is from your hometown you guys have
[1:22:38] things in common you can fellowship
[1:22:41] together at the restaurant everybody
[1:22:43] over here is you will wonder what you
[1:22:45] talking about because they didn't grow
[1:22:47] up in the town you grew up in so is a
[1:22:50] soul with two brother and their
[1:22:51] Fellowship II and the Holy Ghost
[1:22:53] a man why because they talk about the
[1:22:55] things the Lord how good and pleasant is
[1:22:57] for men to dwell brethren to dwell
[1:23:00] together in unity it's like when the
[1:23:03] Holy Spirit flows down over Aaron's
[1:23:05] beard and he's covered with the presence
[1:23:08] of Jehovah amen
[1:23:11] covered in the presence of Jehovah let's
[1:23:15] turn to Isaiah chapter 8 I'm turning to
[1:23:24] the scripture just because of
[1:23:28] experiences that this country is going
[1:23:31] through just how divisive it is because
[1:23:45] sigh this our culture is gonna get worse
[1:23:48] and worse we haven't seen anything yet
[1:23:53] amen and Sodom and Gomorrah there were
[1:23:57] as crowds going from door to door
[1:23:59] knocking looking for people they meant
[1:24:06] you know it's gonna get worse things I
[1:24:10] don't know how long we're gonna be here
[1:24:12] but it's gonna get worse amen in Isaiah
[1:24:19] chapter 8 for the prophet Isaiah is
[1:24:23] everybody was worried about the Syrian
[1:24:26] government
[1:24:28] everybody in Jerusalem and all of Israel
[1:24:31] they knew they were getting ready to be
[1:24:33] attacked the Syrian government is gonna
[1:24:36] cross the border and was gonna attack
[1:24:39] them and overtake them and overcome them
[1:24:41] and they were scared they didn't know
[1:24:45] what to do and there was many they were
[1:24:48] wondering how are we gonna survive the
[1:24:51] oncoming attack how are we gonna survive
[1:24:55] the upcoming war when the Assyrians come
[1:24:58] to take away our place and Miam said let
[1:25:02] us go down to Egypt and seek a
[1:25:06] confederacy a union with Egypt so that
[1:25:10] their armies can be our armies and our
[1:25:12] armies can be their armies so when the
[1:25:14] Syrians come down we can trust in the
[1:25:17] armies of Egypt and so let's read here
[1:25:21] in a Isaiah 8 verse 7
[1:25:29] actually we'll start
[1:25:31] verse 5 it says and the Lord spake also
[1:25:35] unto me again saying for as much as this
[1:25:38] people refuse us the waters of Shiloh
[1:25:41] that goes softly the waters of Shiloh
[1:25:44] what was that that was where God well I
[1:25:46] meant that's where that's where God used
[1:25:49] to live that's where God's Tabernacle
[1:25:51] used to be but they refused that and
