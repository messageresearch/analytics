with his we blood he love me Lord and all my love is Du he plunged me Victory Bene the cleansing FL amen do you love him amen amen you got to have Victory in Jesus he says if you don't he says then what do you have amen amen I just tell you uh it I said Lord I I was just thinking Lord never had I really ministered that sermon this morning but then I was sitting there back there and I was just thinking right five minutes then right before he called me I was thinking Lord may you have me missing something different I was writing down a bunch of scriptures and I'm like right right so I said Lord help us Lord help us and so it's just something you know but you you just you want God to have his way you know andtime we have way but he say his way I just ask you um if you just turn with me to Jeremiah 29 Jeremiah 29 and uh let me just read two or three scriptures before you have your seat uh and um let look at this in verse 10 and it says for thus sayith the Lord after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good work toward you Amen in causing you to return to this place amen for I know the thoughts that I think toward you sayith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall ye call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and I will aren unto you amen and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart glory to God you know ain't that something he said when you search for me with all your heart then God said I got to do something for you man just think he said if you came tonight you give God all your heart you say Lord I came here and I want to see Jesus that's s got up in the church and says sir we would see Jesus and he says if you would just search with all your heart Jesus Christ being the same yesterday that's here that's tonight and then forever means he's obligated to keep the same promise now think about that now think about that but he says now he said I have thoughts that I'm thinking towards you tonight and he it's going to bring you to something but it all resonates on what you searching in with all your heart so it's responsibility now so it's something God putting on us let's uh look at this um second uh chronic 7 and 14 many you know this scripture amen just want to read it to you Lord uh he says if my people and this is he says this is after the Lord appeared unto Solomon at night he says if my people which are called by my name amen shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked wi ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin amen and will heal your land tonight now look at this now but he says if my people called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways this one more passage of scripture uh Genesis um no actually Let's Do Matthew 11 Matthew 11:28 Matthew 11:28 you know you know this scripture let you those you reference you read it it says come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and Jesus says I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your Souls now for my yoke is easy and my burden is light let us just bow one second oh Lord gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just come before your presence tonight Lord God knowing that without you we could do nothing Lord God and Heavenly Father we're all here tonight because we're such a needy people Lord God and Father we have need that you come by this way Lord Jesus and Heavenly Father we just want to ask father Lord that as we just lay this service into your hands father and we thank you for your sweet Spirit father Lord God here Lord we ask that you take over the service and have preeminence Lord God that Lord Jesus you'll have your will your way Lord God may you move me out the way for your glory Lord we ask you father in Jesus Christ's name we pray Lord we say amen amen amen amen just as you take your seats you know it's something uh say I had two little thoughts here but I just wanted to read these two little uh thoughts to you this is from the um this is from the message uh why and let me see here make it kind of short uh let look this look at this thought before just read this to you this is something this like 1962 and just think about this for a second he says I wonder tonight if Christ could come on the scene or over the nation today in drawing this nation to judgment if that same question wouldn't be asked and what is that question it says why is it is it why is it that we are doing these things why are we fussing in in the government whether we should read the Bible in public this 1962 think about this now and he says and he says now and why if we are reading all this nonsense it says did our did not our forefathers set this constitution in order did not this nation be born upon the principles of the Bible aren't we here for freedom of religion to act in God the way we feel fit to act the way that we are convinced is true now think about this now this 1962 and I say Lord Lord now it's 2013 and I want you to think now think about where our government sits we have a government shut down right people you know many years ago we hey couple years ago we got Obama you know we got Obama he going to take us to the the victory land now they like boy if I see him on my land I just see him at the stoplight I wish I could let him go let him go and let him know now you think about it now you see the the day and ages he said it would come people looking for a superhero yes right and now you look at it even in movies you look at on Billboard people with the Marvel Comics come back and now guess what you got the Green Lantern you got the Iceman you got Thor you got all these guys cuz people are looking for a superhero amen now once you think about that now so the spirit is now because people know it's so much pressure on the land that if we don't have a superhero we not going to get out of here now you got to think most superheroes I don't this ain't on my notes but Lord give me Grace you said this on my Note but I ask you this you say most superheroes they can do things above what the normal that's right they can fly amen they can run they quick he said they can see through walls you see think about it now you know there's super there's super men and women right but now that means that has to also be if this is the world getting in the spirit of looking at something super then I'm asking you it has to be a supernatural people still here in the land that has a supernatural Spirit that's getting ready now to do something because remember brother brandham he spoke and he said the bride will have a Ministry amen and when you read judges nine remember when they were going up in the tower it was a woman that took a stone and what did she do she threw it on what aimc amen and that woman now is a type of the Bride of Jesus Christ and they were in a tower that Tower was who Christ and as they're in that Christ he said that tower now he's coming against her and then he she throws a stone amen and now the stone it smashes his head right and now he's he ain't dead yet but now as he's sitting there on the books he says what happened he says he ask can somebody please kill me yeah cuz he did not want to see that what a woman killed him amen but you see Genesis and Revelations you see now that he said the books the devil hates the most right because it shows the beginning and it still shows in the end that he loses now I want you to see if it has the beginning and end of him then you have to also find your position in that tonight now your position means that if God you see if a maniac that man that was bound up with all those demons Legions of demons if he had over 2,000 suicidal demons you say why you say brother KY because remember when Jesus cast those demons out those same demons that was in him they went into the swine amen and those same demons when they got into the pigs the pig said I can't take this and you know they say a pig now a pig has a IQ higher than even a dog and a pig now as he's wiing and everything else he said hey I don't want this demon I'd rather drown and have a demon in me so now he said now that same demon killed that pig but it couldn't kill that predestinated seed oh I hope you see this now I hope you see this now so you say so now there was a reason that you see that man could not be slain by those en by the spirit of the enemy but now when Jesus came amen you see they had to recognize even in him that what that he was the Messiah that he was the son of God so you see in this hour when he asked this question in that message I tell you brother Bram he said if man he said if God provides a certain way for man yeah and he lays it out there for you yes sir and he says and man chooses not to walk in it amen he said then God has a right to ask why amen he has the answer he can ask you why are you not walking in my provided way amen and I want you to think about this now because you see in the end time it's going to be the same thing remember he said Matthew 24 he said that what he said that many false Christ shall arise and he said and false prophets and he said it's false prophets and he said it's not singular it's plural amen and they have a Jew a true true genuine baptism of the holy spirit that is motivating that gift to make them do what they're doing amen but he said what they cannot manifest the word amen so what does that mean now that means that they cannot help being a fle amen a thorn can't help being a thorn a seed can't help being a seed amen so now I want you to see remember Jesus said as they both goow together in Matthew 13 he told the parable he said now what as they grow together there the tears and the wheat he said they are what he said they're children of God and he said they're Children of the devil right and he said now they said you know what we don't like this and I want you to think think about this remember he said it was two different entities that planted two different seeds so the good s don't plant no bad seed come on now the good SE don't sow no bad seed but he SS only good seed in good ground but now he says another SE came and he says while the good SE slept right and he came in behind them and he planted now evil tears now the tears when he planted he said they both started growing right and he talks about how the rain comes and it falls on the just and the unjust and they both grow up and they say hallelujah he says we got a big church and we got a organ player and we got a choir but he said but there's no life there yeah the people he said are blind miserable naked and they don't know it and now you may have a small group like this and maybe you got a tamarine playing but maybe you don't got the god the drunk you ain't got that you know right so I know that kind of hurt you a little bit brother Isaac but you know but you see but something says you know we really don't need that if we can have the presence of God and I think now brother brand he said come to Gord he said now if we have a piano player let us have a holy ghost fi come on now he said let have a holy ghost fi piano playing so he said why because he plays the bass they play the melody and he got to keep the Rhythm so he says now what's there it has to add and help what the spirit moving over the people it's not no time for shine it ain't time about me it's time to help I want you to think about this now but now when you're waiting on God for things I don't know why but I tell you this you see when I was first in Atlanta and brother um uh Brooks know brother Perry and he was starting the church and it was a brother used to come down every now and then and uh would play and he had no used to song League no music and and the room was maybe maybe this big I done seen the lights go out jumping those fences boy what we going to do with the lights lady them forgot to pay the light bill we go down the Dollar General go tick tick you know get the little ones you can hang on the wall but we going to have church now go we still G to have church and I want you to think about this and it came down to even though I saw that sometime you didn't have different things it was all about when he comes yeah and when he comes it's like the worship that you give without anything guess what that goes back to the Garden of Eden yeah and the Garden of Eden remember he said they had no organs amen they had no drum sir he said they had no piano but he said but they had the presence of God now think about that now they had the presence of God Amen and now you see he said it wasn't until what remember Cain and his seed they went down and then they created the brass and they created the instruments and they went down and he said civilization started and then now that we had the instrument then now only still by David even having to train musician could now the Holy Spirit use still those vessels to make those instruments talk the way the Lord wanted to talk now what you think about this because you'll see at the end time you see those tears as they grow they're always trying to outshine the week yeah yeah and their spirit is to destroy the week amen you know think about this now you know you take a week you like well I ain't going to really bother you you know you know you had somebody in school that you ain't got you don't have no beef with right you cool but for some reason they always walking like man I just don't like you man you you you a punk let me put my finger in your nose think now and you're like I ain't you know why this God bothering me you know so now you see it's a spirit amen and that Spirit now started all way in heaven amen and it's only being manifested here in the Earth yeah and you see now you see as the two grow up together they go to church they look just alike and I want you to think for a second they all want the same blessing yeah they want the same blessing now and now the Bible says it's the same son yeah and it ain't a different Sun that sign on the the weeds right it is the sign the sunshine on the weed the same on the grass amen the Sun the rain that comes down on the wheat falls in the tear ain't no different rain that's right ain't acid rain for you and real rain for me it's the same thing so now when you see that now now it shows you that as they both grow we all here on Earth we want blessings but you see here and I may read this scripture is that but for the seed of God it says sometimes we got to press a little hard yes yes you got to think remember the Bible says that the kingdom of God suffer violence sir and the violent take by force and any man that wanted to the kingdom of God Amen they wanted God in them they wanted Fellowship he said they had to press their way into amen amen so I just want I want to read you this scripture won't be long tonight and I just want you to see you say as yourself the power to overcome amen now look at this with me please if you if you go to Genesis uh well I saying 32 I think with me I want you to uh please if you just read this just read with me uh verses 24 take just an example here too you know it was a man his name was Jacob yes sir and Jacob was his name mean deceiver yes sir and he was born to say man I take a dollar from you leave it on the table I'll smile and take all your money out your wallet brother that's your brother too that you know just Jacob yeah and you know in the Bible says that you know he was a mama's boy right he hung around brother BR dramatized around the 10 all the time am but he said now but he said now his brother he said now guess what Esau was the spitting him he was a hunter he was fast his father loved him he did everything his father said but he said now but him he was a deceiver yeah now as we know the Bible tells us Esau was the one who what had the birthright am Esau has born with the blessing but God knew that he would despise it God knew that he would turn it down for just a little meal maybe you think red P I mean I'm like red lentil you ever anybody had lentil bean I know I don't know I say all I can tell you is hey Lord don't ever let me get there Lord I say Lord I mean to give up you said your blessings he said for some red lentil beans you got to be right got to be real I ain't never been that hungry hey but you got to think maybe he was looking for that deer all day he was bow hunting and you know he didn't have a shotgun so he was bow hunting you get tired of pulling that bow you know like some people they say they work all week they got enough energy to maybe do what they want the weekend but he said but you know but when it come time for church service you know hey I rather eat my red lentil B I want you to think about it now they'd rather have the red lentil than to say Lord I'd rather Feast on the bleeding bloody word of the L now think about this sir so you see this is what he was faced with and he so so as you know the Bible basically when he got the birthright and he got the blessing from his brother then it always set in his heart because he know he deceived him he went before his his father who was said Jacob and he said now he had him fill his arms oh man let me fill them arms boy they just like your brother I tell you but your voice is like Jacob well you know Daddy got got a little C daddy got a look go and think about it now his arm was hairy and he put it in there he fell to me said come let me fill your neck well you know yeah that might be you and remember he said even God hid that from the prophet's ey now think about that and so he blessed him so God did this but now it sat with him and it definitely didn't sit good with his brother Esau and brother his brother Esau the Bible even tells that he got so vexed and he got so upset that he even went and married some unsaved women that his that his father and mother he knew would disapprove amen think about this now think about this so he went and the Bible say he did it knowing it would displease amen think about this and you see so now here he comes and Jacob he's been tearing on remember he reap what you s right 14 years he worked for laen he got tricked got a wife said man this ain't her wake up this Ain hurt you know think about whoa I know oh this work seven more years you can have him when you want hey hey you know think God have mercy right amen so he had worth seven more years and then he got what he got his other wife Rachel so now as he has his two wives he works hard God blesses him but then he still has to deal with this issue with his brother and his brother now is saying you know what I gave something up I shouldn't have gave and now he was scared to meet his brother and I want you to see now in this this little passage what it was like for Jacob let's just give you a little background for number 24 in verse 24 Jacob was left alone and there he wrestled with a man he wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day so all night long he's doing this wrestling he's like hey he's wrestling now we don't even know who the man is yet but Jacob is wrestling Lord Lord God and you got to think to wrestle now you say now it takes a lot of energy yeah you know you got to put all you got to put everything in it you need to hips you need your your your hamstrings you need your quads you need your hand you need everything to wrestle amen and see little does he know that this man is an angel yeah now I want you to see this and when he saw that he prevailed not against him that's the angel saw he couldn't get away it says he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him so you see sometimes for a Believer even though you want God to do something in your life you may have to wrestle a little bit you may have to now press a little bit you may now have to see cuz God sometime he test you just to see if you really really believe the promise so now remember he's holding on he's holding on and this supernatural being cannot get away from a man but it's a man that has an anointing God he has an anointing on him to say when you really want something from God man do you know that God can't get away from you until you let him go think about that now oh Lord God don't you know when that woman he said when Jesus looked at that woman he said it's not meat for me to cast the children bed to the dog and she looked down brother the books and he said and she she she something got her yeah and it was something called Faith y'all and that faith that got her she said you know what she says that's true Lord yeah and brother Bram he spoke remember he said he said Faith always recognizes the word is Right amen and see something rose up and you see she got down there and she couldn't even move yeah now most people the church for Less I want you to think about this but now the man the god that created her that gave her her being that gave her that gave her allow her to knew that she would be at this point yeah he said now look he said I can't do nothing for you woman cuz it's not your time yeah so you say huh what if God told you that what if God told you he said that I can't bless you tonight because it's not your you're just you're just a gentile dog brother Randy you're a gentile dog I'm sorry I'm sorry amen now what would you do I guess I guess I just go home think about it now because you got to make a choice but this woman yeah when she was there and now God is speaking to her yeah his angel I could see her maybe thinking she was like but you know what he's the only one that can solve my problem yeah and she looked at him and she said you know even though it's not my time you're still my Lord yeah and since you're my Lord he says you know what I just tell you this but even the dogs who you created yeah the Chihuahua oh he said the the cockadoo he said the labador the German Shepherds even those dogs he said even they eat the little crumbs that fall from your table amen and this remember she was on her knees and she didn't care who else was around I'm telling you this now so she's there and she's wrestling with God now I want you to see this and now he looks on her and he says according to her faith yeah he gave her what she asked for so it shows that now A True Believer in the presence of God that God can't even turn you away if you sincere Hallelujah God could not turn this woman away that's what that song it says I would not be denied I would not be Deni to Jesus comes and makes me whole oh come on sister I will not be denied come on now you see because now he said God you cannot deny me Lord because I'm your own I come from you you see it's like I'd be sitting in the car and I could be riding to my daughter say Daddy Daddy Daddy Daddy and I be like I'm thinking about something Daddy Daddy Daddy Daddy and I say sweetie what you want baby she has a revelation and she just keeps calling my name that some point I'm going to turn around you say even a child Hallelujah remember Jesus he said in Luke 18 he gave a type when he said with the unjust judge and he said the unjust judge he feared not God he feared not man and he said but this woman kept coming to his door and he said something hit him and said I don't fear nobody I could do what I want he said but he said if I don't answer this woman she's going to weary me yeah she going to she going to weary me so you think sometimes we think it's like a sin to weary God you can't remember remember they told Isaiah the prophet that he said oh we don't want to bother you god let's just leave him alone you know he said no he says I'll tell you something since you didn't ask King let me go ahead and tell you a virgin shall conceive think about this now he said is you can't wear with God no no sir but you see in this particular case Jacob had a revelation that you see that him even being a deceiver that if he could just hold on to God yeah and now guess what it was an angel so he had to hold on to the word of what an angel God's messenger came to speak to him about now I'm telling you if God did it then for them him then it must be the same for us in this hour you see because now you see as time gets worse you have to hold on to that message and God will reveal it to you as you keep walking and he says gives you Revelation as you have need of so you see it's not going to do you any good to know every quote and know every line but it's going to be everything when now God comes and reveals it to you you say how do I know Brother Kyle because it's not what you can say from your head is what you can live from your heart so now you become a walking epistle you're walking and talking and everything that God said he said you lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's for a man or a woman he said preach the word instance in season out of season and you always should have your testimony on your heart because you don't know who you got to share it with now think about this now tonight Saints God is calling a people a people that he predestinated from the foundation of the world and he said because I shed my own blood and I put that seed there he told Abraham that the uncountable blessing that I'm going to pour out on that seed you can't even number him in the star you can't even see him in the sand because God is the one who did it I want you to think about this tonight am so now you see you don't see how full this room is amen you don't see how packed this room is you said remember he said sometimes you be in a service and that little empty seat next to you where the angel of the Lord is what you see is who invites him who's wrestling to overcome you see that's why some people don't understand what it means to miss church you see it means you see like it's let me tell you something when God reveals to you who you are when you come to church you encourage somebody else I want you to think about this now you see it's not that you just coming only you coming to hear the word but I want you to see as you press God is using you as a testimony let me tell you like I was thinking about a brother as his brother from Congo and this brother he's 19 years old and I would see this brother he would catch the train in Atlanta the church and he would come on Wednesdays he come Sunday morning he come Sunday night and I say Lord God what is now pushing this young man when most young men in 19 years old by their self he said what what's causing him to push his way to church and I will tell you a testimony this brother he was thinking about leaving brother God showed uh brother Tony Pastor show him a dream a vision I can't remember which one and he showed him said the brother had a book pack on like he was leaving out the door and he told the brother and the brother said like amen that's the truth he said he was thinking about transferring to go to another the school I think somewhere down in Texas and he was debating with it he was struggling with it and then he ended up he said well I'm just going to be here but I'm waiting on the Lord and he was thinking about because his major he wanted to change the major and all that so what happened he he turned a little essay and the essay he turned in it was writing in for something and it was like you can win some money for a scholarship when he turned it in he's the one who won and now he said now I'm talking about $25,000 scholarship amen and now it's a man that serve God yeah come to church on time shirt tucked in Stand by the door how can I help you see I want you to think about this now 19 years old and you see here now you see you see God has testimonies yeah and I want you to think about this now the brother he went out brother y church he was interpreting we had French Brothers coming all time speaking French he'd interpret great interpretting and I was just thinking about you see how God always has to have a testimony so when he come to service he encourages someone else amen now want you think about that in your life you got to be encouraging somebody amen but you see I want you as we keep reading I want you to see it's because you're wrestling yeah it's because you're striving it's because you're willing now to say you know I'm going to go where some men don't want to go because I see the Promise amen now let me keep reading this let me tell you just as an example Jacob as he's wrestling he get touching the hollow was thigh and now it said even to this day even the Jews don't even eat the hollow of the thigh right he said why cuz the muscle strength the sineu and he says in verse 26 the angel tells to him he says let me go let me go said why for the day is coming the day break and I got to get out of here now as he's holding them Jacob he says I will not let thee go except thou bless me now here's an angel Brother Richard yes sir and he's asking permission from a Deceiver let me go let me go I can't let you go I can't let you go until you bless me I need a blessing now you say I want to speak to you tonight is he say don't don't he say just tell the lord I can't let you go till you bless me amen I can't let you go to you bless me now once you see you're wrestling now you're wrestling and you hold hold on to now this Angel but you know this Angel has a blessing just for [Applause] you the day is coming and he said there wasn't be a day remember it's night time it's Darkness but if you keep wrestling you see now you see you start to see a little day and now the angel said hold on maybe I need to do something a little different I done touch this sty already but let me talk to him now this is what he said but Adam he said this he says and he said to him what is thy name now you figure now they never had no dialogue he said before but now he asking what is your name what are you called by who speaks to you he said I want you remember brother he said names have significance amen now he says and he said Jacob and he said thy name shall no more shall be called No More Jacob but Israel for as a prince has has thou power with God and with men and has prevailed amen so the angel Taps out he Taps out come on he Taps him out give me all you you got me here's your blessing so now he says you'll no more be called Jacob but a prince with God so now here comes Israel Israel is born as a man overcame as he wrestled now let let me read this and Jacob asked him and said tell me I pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou does ask after my name and he blessed him there and now he named the place a certain place and I want you to see through the story is you as an individual if you wrestle you can overcome but you got to you see I was looking brother Brooks had this uh on that wall downstairs and it says about being a soldier and one things it says is I will never quit amen now come on now now I want you to think about this it said the first and the last says I'm American Soldier it ends when I'm American Soldier yes sir so it's telling you who you are and who you are amen so in life and in death you're still an American Soldier but he says now but I can't quit and it says the mission I will never put anything before the mission now God he says that he has to have soldiers yes sir now when he comes back on the White Horse He said now and his Saints came with him that's right now you got to think they can't have a quitting attitude because why on Earth they never quitted on Earth it was nothing too hard for God was their slogan there's nothing that now they said God could not fix for them was their theme now I want you to think about this because why because they knew as long as I don't let go of God he'll bless me amen right amen I want you to see this this this little story here this evening turn with me to 1 Samuel just talk about this little lady here and I know the time is a little lengthy but I want you to see this and definitely don't try to read it all but look at this with me as you see it's a man here and his a wife there's a man here that had two wives you see in verse one just kind of paraphrase for time his name was elkan now elkan means God has redeemed God has purchased and he had two wives p panah and Hannah Hannah means Grace he said panah means costly pearls Earthly woman so he had two wives now I want you to think as you say two Vines two two Spirits I want you to see that this man had two as rutes of himself and now he marries these women and one as you know panah she has children she's fruitful many children but Hannah her name means Grace Brother Richard and now this woman she was buried now her name means Grace but she has no kids yeah now you might ask if you was this woman you say where is my grace where's my grace he said how am I going to overcome Hallelujah she saids but brother Brook as she's sitting there she's now seeing that it seemed like God is giv the blessings all to pan how is she getting all the blessings so you see now her husband ask her God has purchased God has redeemed elkan he says he he says until he says uh am I not better to you than 10 Sons am I not better you than 10 Sons he says no I really want my own child she wanted to give birth to something she wanted to now mother something amen she wanted to now to be love into something I want you to Lord God just to see the an be was burning in her she wanted to display it the love but yet she was restricted because her wound was bad now let's just read this with me as the Bible says in verse n so Hannah rose up after they had eaten and sh sh and shilow as you know means peace and after they had drunk and now Eli the priest sat in the seat by the post of the Temple of the Lord and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the Lord and wept sore and now she's crying before the Lord and now the Bible says that she vowed a vow and said oh lord of hosts if thou will indeed look on the Affliction of thine handmade and remember me and not forget thine handmade but will give unto thine handmade a Manchild then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head so she's praying and she vows a vow and remember the Lord said you know you if you vow vow you should pay your vows amen and now she means it from her heart she's crying out to the Lord and now want you just see tonight is think of an individual think of a person coming before God with a need we all are needed people amen and every day we live we have to bring all our request unto him we have to ask God to say Lord in this hour remember God is looking for that sincere heart that really wants to worship him that wants to praise him in the beauty of his Holiness but he's wondering now as you bring things before him he say could you vow a vow to say Lord whatever you bless me with Lord God I will give unto you now think about this tonight whatever God bless you with he said I will give it all back to you amen now this was her vow and she said what I'm giving back to you I will consecrate to the Lord amen so that's that was all from her mouth the priest as she's praying the priest marks her mouth and he says she looks on her the priest Eli he thinks that she's drunk you think that maybe she's like you know like what's going on you know it seem like she's at the altar but I don't know what she's talking about but he marks her vow and he now this let me just drop down and read it in 14 he says how long will thou be drunken put away thy wine from thee Eli thought she was drunk but she says and Hannah answered no my Lord I a woman of sorrowful spirit I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the Lord count not thy hand made as a daughter of beow for for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto so now as all the years have gone by I want you to think about this the priest sees a mouth she speaks he sees what she bowed before the Lord and now as she's standing there Eli tells her go in peace for now he gives her a spoken word amen he gives her a word that she can live on she gives her a word that means more everything now I want you to think let's take for example there's two women in the Bible remember you got Mary and you also got what Eve in the garden of Eve and Eve and Mary were the same they both received a spoken word from the Lord amen and now the word that Eve had was don't touch the tree leave the tree alone don't you can eat of any tree of the garden but now but the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil leave it alone amen so a spoken word of God was hanging the world in the balance and now here Comes Mary as she comes and now this woman right here shees a spoken word from an angel now the Bible tells this Angel spoke to her but God directly spoke to Eve and Adam yeah and now you see here as he speaks to this angel speaks to Mary he says he tell him oh you're going to be overshadowed by the Holy Ghost you're going to have a child right and now I want you to see how both respond they both heard the word but one disobeyed the spoken word of God amen and now the fall Came Death came sin came but by another woman who received only the spoken word of God through her came life the second Adam amen now want you to think about it I tell you something you know brother Bram he was asked one time he was out hunting with some brothers they asked him they said you know brother brandom if you think about um if if Adam and Eve were here and they had children do you think they'd be like in the same image of their you know of their parents like all their children be just like Adam and Eve and brother brandham said almost but not all the way and I was thinking I said what what what brother Brandon mean by that and so when he when he says that he says he said what do you mean brother Brandon he says because he said there'll be one thing that I know Adam and Eve G have he said that's a nebor and I said I I said B I said Lord I I I ain't think about that Lord but he says enable he said why because you came from something amen now think about this everybody on Earth beside Adam and Eve and who else Jesus Christ he said when he came he had a neighbor so it showed he's our Kingman Redeemer because when he born he came the exact same way you did Brother chy Lord God and here's a prophet of God trying to show us how exact the word is now it's a blessing in this now because he's saying to this and right here for this woman he's saying that all of the word that the that the prophet or in this case the priest spoke Eli to this woman everything that was spoken as long as she didn't wrestle with it and grieve that word of God away and the spirit with it it was that remember she still had an opportunity to be blessed am and here she is as her mouth is marked she goes away from the presence of the temple with only a spoken word am now now think about this brother only a spoken that's all she left with that's all she left with and if you can leave tonight with an unadulterated spoken word of God spoken to you that's all you got to leave with for something to happen in your life because God will Mark your mouth and he'll Mark your heart now look at this now he speaks as he said he goes in PE in peace and 8 she said let thy hand man find Grace in thy sight so you see her name and what she desired are now becoming something amen the grace she desired and who she was he Brother Richard now was becoming one amen and you see it has to come a time he says when the bride will recognize who she is amen now I want you to think about that you as a person the Bible it tells us plainly that God is coming back for a bride amen now let's think about this this woman has to be able to handle the spoken word of God Amen she has to have a character that's just like her husband amen she has to be a woman that that she her W every one of his wishes is her command amen anything that he desires she's willing to walk in she's willing to do why because it's not for herself it's for him amen now she Lord let me keep reading she this woman Hera I mean Hannah it said when she went away she did eat now and her countenance will no more sad amen so a spoken word of God for a Believer it changes your face brother Homer brother Homer is laughing brother uh brother Brooks know brother Homer and he was saying you know I just sometime go places and preach and he says sometime even here at the church and he says I tell people I says if you're happy he said take your hand and let your face know and I was like Hey Brother BR he you got to know and be like Lord he said let your face they said and your hand just show that you happy amen and you know it's something you go to church and people in there I love the Lord and praise God and you be like man what we it don't the two don't do tell yeah and you say but he say in his presence is fullness of joy am you know now I say well you know why the PHR is so FR because maybe they haven't received that spoken Worden but when it comes the countenance the Bible says was changed so from the inside out there's joy that starts coming because you start seeing that he's bringing you to an expected end you say now Lord let me keep reading and he says in Samuel now so in verse 19 look at 19 they rose up now husband and wife with a spoken word of God in their life they worship before the Lord and they returned and they came to their house in Rama and elkan remember God has purchased God has redeemed he knew Hannah so Redemption means Grace Lord God Redemption brings grace to the household brother Brooks now I want you to see Redemption The Plan of Redemption has to come to your house amen now what do you see your natural house yes but let's be a little closer this house tonight amen this house tonight when the grace of God recognize Redemption it means something now I want you to see when those two come together with a spoken word of God Amen that now something is about to be unveiled to them and the Bible says it says and Hannah he knew is Hannah his wife and now the Lord remembers her Hallelujah now think about this brother Isaac now there's a remembrance that goes on now it's been the same act for many years it's been the same up and down the same child it's been the same things but when God and Hannah came together through the act of remembrance now God comes and he tells the believer he says as often as you even take communion he said do this in remembrance of me amen so he said to you think about the blood of Jesus Christ when you come to take the Lord's Supper every day he said think about what he did for you and he says you remember that your Plan of Redemption that was before you before the foundation of the world it comes to you when you recognize the grace amen amen God comes and now he's sitting there and he remembers her so now through the act of remembrance and an Act of Faith by the same spoken word it produces a life amen now look at this tonight he said the life that comes forth it came from the husband and the woman now look at this in holy matrimony believing God just like Abraham amen now let's bring this a little closer we come down and it came to pass that when the time was come after Hannah conceived and bear a son and called his name Samuel because I have asked him of the Lord that's his name so now remember there was no open vision and now there have not been any prophecies for a long time and now the vow that she vowed was going to give something not just for for her but now for the people now Lord God let me read this and the man remember the husband God has purchased he said redeem and all his house went up to offer unto the Lord a yearly sacrifice but they said this year Hannah says unto her husband I'm going to stay home so I can continue to nurse God's blessing so she's sitting home she kind oh Lord and she's nursing the blessing of God remember now Paul had to go three years on the back of the desert and he says what to now know that that light that spoke to him that that was the Messiah that that was Yahweh that was Elohim that that was the god of the Jews that spoke to him through his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and he now had a little time to nurse that spoken word that came to him this is just like Hannah here and she's nursing what God has manifested in her life amen so now she's taking care of this baby she remembers how she was laughing after that she remembers how she was scorn she remembers all the struggle but I think when she looks down at her baby she says I just all I can think of is the blessing all I can think of is how God brought you to our lives all I can think of is what you'll be one day all I know is that you have a Nazarite vow all over your life and that now you're not to even cut your hair you're not to even drink I even promised God that this is going to happen yes because you are God's Own seed now let me keep reading on down and it says and now in verse 23 the B her husband said do what seems good unto you and it says only you read down only the Lord establish his word so she stood there and gave suck to her child and now look at this now in verse 24 when she had weaned him and took him up with her that the three blocks and one F of flour and bottle of wine and brought him to the house of the Lord in Shiloh the child was young they had to give a sacrifice now remember she never put side what the child and stopped serving God the whole time the whole time while she was praying she was still continually going to church amen she was still continually worshiping God Amen but then on the other side now here she is and now after she received the child she still want to go and now give a sacrifice unto God Amen now what you think many people after they receive blessings it says they say well you know hey I stopped going to church cuz God done did it now God knew the heart already yes but now I want you to ask if God were to bless you tonight yes you says would your heart go cold on cuz remember now the more you have the more responsible you are because he said to much is given much is required am now I want you to think about this now because God has to prepare you for every stage of your life you say this you know he say Lord don't make me too poor but Lord don't make me too rich remember why he said Lord just make me where I can just Serve You Lord God with whatever you feel is just now I want you to think God wants to bless his people but now you wonder sometimes can your people handle it you know brother brand had an incident where the brothers they were going to they were going to get some oil but B he show what the oil is told what the oil was the guys go look for the oil and it's exactly the place where the oil is and they they dig and they can't get n and then some unbelievers come right behind them they dig in the same spot bukus of money yeah and you know that could be that very thing yes sir could keep their keep their salvation yeah amen and you got to think sometimes you people don't realize the life even financially it becomes hard because of why because of our own lust our own desires but then what God wants to bless us with is that he already knows our heart amen and our heart is not in a position that we want to give to God now once you think about this you pay your tith you pay your offering God knows that you're supposed to that's the Bible amen but then you ask what about your time now want you to think about this I don't know I don't know why we I don't know why we get on this but for a second time is something you can never get back amen when you give somebody a second that second's gone amen you give somebody five minutes that's gone and now you got to think the Bible says God is a good investor so why not if you want to invest with somebody why not invest on the number one team let's come on think about this now let's invest in somebody who has a 100,000 million time percent return it I want you to think about this now and remember how gave Abraham how do you get one son and we we still finding galaxies we still like boy Abraham still got more kids think about him now we still looking at the how anybody know how much sand is on the seashore all you can do is integrate get you an integral but you still don't know amen think about that now so I want you to see where we're at is see we the Bible says it hasn't anything to do the Mind nor even the heart he says the things that God has in store for them that oh come on now that love himen so he said there nothing that you can give up on this side that he said won't be restored unto you a hund fold now I want you to see that I don't know why I going this but I want you to see when you wrestle with God I don't care what the need is you can overcome but God is always looking at your heart that's right the Bible says for all day the prophecy of Malachi 45 was there he was sitting Elijah not the church he said the prophet and this individual he would turn for our day turn the hearts of the children to the fathers so the whole message was to turn the heart so if your heart has not been turned then now you're still in a place where you're not hearing and getting all the blessings of God because the Bible says if you believe in the Lord you what God you'll be established but he says but when you believe in a prophet you get a prophet's reward yeah and the Bible say if you now friend the prophet you are a friend of a prophet and a friend with God now I want you to say this I want you to see this because this hour we don't really see sometime the blessing of what a spoken word can do over your life you see a spoken word you see anything that you ever see in your life it always started with what a thought amen if you see a blade of grass it didn't tell me one thing you ever seen in your life that didn't start with a thought yes sir a piece of plastic a piece of glass I don't care what it that chair you are sitting on a thought right now amen amen now God said I know the thoughts I think towards you so now if God I'm going to bring you to an expected end then now you got to realize where you going amen so you realize the Bible said that's why Paul said what we go through in this life is not worthy to be compared of the things that God has in store for us for those who believe come on somebody he said I'm asking you now it's not it's you can't even compare it so you see when he's talking about the the future home of the bride and he said that future place is now he's saying how it comes he's trying to describe it with words but he say it's so beautiful that Lord God lord you see Lord in the temple right go back in the Tabernacle in the Tabernacle you say at the holy the holy place and then the most holies right and he say that most holy place where where there two chair with their wings outstretched they were sitting there that Mercy Seat was a mercy seat as long as it had blood on it right and the blood that is there beneath that was what two tablets The Ten Commandments and Aaron's Rod which buted brother BR actually gave me a lesson right there I said boy that's good but I want you to see in there was the place that only the high priest could go he could only go there at a certain time and he had to be dressed a certain way and he could not might be any spot any blemish he had already offered the sacrifice he had went through the Brazen lav he had washed and now he was ready to go in the presence of God and now with now the breastplate on and the effort and he now he had what he said on his on even on his tassles he had the little bells ringing that he went in there and now when he offered up the right sacrifice that now when he did it and God accepted it the Shak glory of God will come down now the Bible says that the people on the camps they were every man in numbers two they were in what by their standard they were on each side of the Tabernacle and remember he said you had Dan you had Judah you had Ephraim and he said you had Reuben in the South and now as you look at this is a perfect type of what we have of those four beasts around the throne the four the new gospel the four books of the Gospel as you see this he's trying to paint a picture to show you remember those that overcome L de seia they were given a promise and now he said you go past he says what everything God give you to be able to sit in the throne with your father so now God is trying to get all of us to a place that we see that we're Overcomers in his hour now oh Lord God I just want to say to you think about this we're getting ready Saints for a raptor yes sir and many people are getting so C they thinking about everything on this Earth and getting ready for a Rapture remember he said that last age would have an eagle anoint that's right and when you look at those four beasts only what the eagle was the only one that flies amen and you see now the eagle flies and he tyed it with the spirit of a prophet amen now I want you to think about this if God gave us a spoken word that he said you speak squirrels into existence he said that now he said talk to the storm that that old that color lady Angel mama he said she called on God God stopped the plane and now she asked where's my elij and she's standing out there and now man she never met God through her prayer stopped a airplane put it down down there now in Tennessee he walked by almost the same place brother um Andre he said he walked by Miles and he said almost the same place um Martin Luther King was shot and he walks past all of that and he walks down to this color District early in the morning and he sees a woman standing there by the gate now this woman is like Hannah this evening and she was wrestling for her child and she was sitting there praying and her child had stepped out and caught a veneer disease and now what happened was the child was sick and brother Bradon was whistling walking and all he's doing is he's walking he said the Holy Spirit hey brother have you ever been walking and and God tell you take a left you ever been walking and God tell you take a right that's he was walk God said take a left and he said God bless you Hallelujah now think about that now that's being led by the spirit this is how this real man was walking and as he was walking he's walking and he comes to he's walking by a black lady see look like an aunt your mama and he says hello Parson how you doing Parson how you doing hold on how this woman know my how she know I'm a preacher he said Excuse Me Miss how you know that I was a preacher he said well I was was up praying last night for my son and as I was praying I almost fell asleep and God showed me he says you coming by with your hat and he said your light color suit and even say you have a brief where's your briefcase at now look now BR where's your briefcase well I now he knows God is doing something it's back at the it's back at the room I let my Bree came back there he says so he said Parson he said can you come in and he said I come into this home he said I never felt so welcome I never felt so welcome Lord let that be that our hes tonight now I want you to see oh let me oh let me say if you don't got it claiming in Jesus Christ name go come on somebody you CLA you got to claim everything amen this ain't see this is for soldiers this God we have is for soldiers this is for soldiers let me tell you you going to fight till the day you leave out of here that's right so you see a soldier can't be scared to die especially when he knows he can't die oh I hope be SE him so all you want to do you got to know how to shoot just keep shooting remember L prophet he got mad at him he said why did you stop shooting them marrows keep shooting them keep shooting them he said why cuz they going to come back so when you ask God for something he said don't be scared he said ask God for a lot amen now you got to think while we working with his atomic bomb that's your faith tonight you got to claim every promise of God amen amen Lord God this woman she's sitting here in her home I believe she claimed that promise in her home she claimed that sweet Holy Spirit would always be in her home but her son stepped out and now he has his veneer diseas and he's sitting on the bed and he's speaking and he's saying he said oh Mama it's cold mama is cold and he's saying to brother brandom it's been like this for days it seemed like he's lost he's out in the ocean somewhere and now as he's sitting there in the bed then he says well he said okay well let's you go ahead and pray for him Mama and he said he said that woman could sure get a hold of God he said when she prayed is that he knew that she was getting a hold of God and then now he enters in the spirit with her and then he prays and he say as he prays he lays his hand on him and then he felt the body starting to get warm he say it's time to go cuz he knew that God was doing something and now he goes back to go get his airplane two hours later the airplane is still on the ground man now you tell me her faith could ground maybe a 737 bow I want you to think about this because she said she said do you remember that man in the Bible she says you heard about that shoa white woman she said eyes be that woman he said eyes be that woman and he say he said I was praying and she said he said I asked Lord where is my Elijah amen now it had to be something putting her in a spirit a channel to ask for the very thing that God had on the earth at that time now come on now and to show that it was God It produced something amen It produced a promised child amen now without Grace by The Plan of Redemption this child that's laying on the bed now gets a warm feeling and now the feeling comes over this child what happens he said Mama I'm seeing I'm seeing light Mama I'm seeing light I'm seeing light and now time goes on and one day brother brandham he's in a town and he's on this train and he got his Parson Parson Parson and he said I don't who is this he said you remember me he said no I don't know you he said Saidi the man you prayed for he said I'm him and he said I want to tell you not only am I heel he said but I was a Christian now I want you to think about this now you see this is God doing something and you see these are not just Stories the Bible said this thing wasn't done in a corner this thing was done all over the world Amen and I want you to just see it tonight we won't be much longer we close that this is the same thing with this woman Hannah tonight by the grace of God even though she has Grace on her life she is still willing to now struggle and oh wrestle with God to get her blessing am the promised child comes now Israel has a a a a prophet and now his name is Samuel now want you to see in verse 28 just 2728 for this child I prayed and the Lord had given me my petition which I asked him therefore also have I have lent unto him to the Lord as long as he liveth he should be lent to the Lord and He Worship the Lord there now look at this so she gives him as you know to Eli Eli raises him up in the temple but I want you to see now in chapter two I just want to hit this part of it you can see in chapter two that now What comes forth Hannah is rejoicing now after God does something for you yall want you to see the ne very next thing that happens is praise that's right now this praise come forth the Bible said that Hannah prayed and she said my heart to rejoice in the Lord my horn is exalted in the Lord my mouth is enlarge over my enemies because I rejoice in thy salvation now she's speaking the same thing that David said she didn't say my salvation but she said thy salvation oh Lord so she's happy about what God is doing and he says there is none holy as the Lord there is none besides thee neither is there any Rock like our God talk no more so exceedingly proudly she's talking to the other wife now panah let not arrogancy come out of your mouth for the Lord is a god of knowledge and by him actions are wed the bows of the mighty men are broken and they that stumbled are GED with strength they that were full of hide out themselves for bread and they that were hungry seed so that the baren have borne seven Oh Glory to God so God ain't give just one but God gave us seven and seven he said he completed the whole plan by Grace Oh Glory to God oh hope you see it tonight Grace is what got you here he said Grace and this is what he did Grace Now by Hannah seven children she had and she only did only had Oh Glory to God one she struggled so much just to get that one but when she gave the one she had back to God when you give God this one very life then God gives you more than what you can imagine you say oh I hope you see this but you got to give it to him and he says the Lord kill him and he says he said back in verse 5 and she that have many children is wax feeble so the one panile the one that said she had it going on now she becomes fee but the one that had nothing God blessed I want I want you to see this so names are important yes sir and I want you to see the name that we're under is now it's Christ's name amen Christ's name right so there's much responsibility but there's much blessings under that name and he says the Lord kth maketh a lie he bringeth down to the Grave he bringeth up the Lord maketh poor maketh Rich he maketh low and lift it up I want you to see that it's a praise song in verse 11 and El I went to Rama to his house and the child did Minister unto the Lord before Eli the priest now want you to see this he grows up into a good young man and as we about to close here I want you to see this little thought after she wrestled with God and after she had been given a blessing it was no different than what you see on that picture right there when Abraham went the message of the hour was him standing over his son's head with a knife his only son and what God's Plan of Redemption was it was being manifested in a man on Earth amen and you got to think sometime people say oh this message you know this seems so crazy have you checked out any of these websites he said have you seen you know brother you know that's just that's just too much you know a man in a cloud and you know a man got Dr I mean come on brother God is just simple then you go back and you say you know I heard a brother from Philippines say he says the Book of Revelations he said why do you think God added that book he said do you think God added it to make it thicker I I ask you I said Lord I'm in church just laugh I'm like Lord they said do you think God had to make it thicker I said he said no I said I'm like no I like no no bro then he said this he says so I asked people I said now look he said when you come to my country and he said we have these signs and he says it has a p on it and he say you see a p and you see a circle in this he said if you pull your car in front of this sign and leave it you have big problem now he said you might not understand the symbol but the symbol means something oh I hope you see this and if you don't understand what that simle mean it might cost you something now I want you to see God comes to give people a word and that people is us and you got to remember now you says it says we are just that Wild Olive Branch has been grafted he say we not know better than anybody but what we see we thank God for what he's done amen and when you thank God you just want to bless somebody else to say Lord I pray that it be a blessing to you but if not as he said just be the best Christian you can be now that's a word now that's but you see it's a warning and he said God first warns a man before he judges him yes sir and you see here in Samuel I just want you to hold on let let me just read this he finish he says in 1 Samuel 2 if you read on down the Bible says that this woman in verse 18 Samuel it was the blessing of God he was that Prophet that came to born by this woman and now you see we are born In His Image we are the image of God Amen and now in His image we have now his countenance amen so we have his same Grace we have his same look yes now this son he had the same thing as his parents but he was being taught to look and become into the image of the son see he worshiped and served in the temple you don't just we don't just teach our kids just to come to church no sir but it's to serve God that's right that's what e that's what uh Nebuchadnezzar want to do with Sarat meach and abedo use their gift to what change their tongue take them down to Babylon and now he wanted the gift and now look but what God put there even the devil wants to use that gift to serve him amen so each and every one of us having a gift we are that child that's before the Lord amen and I want you to see him as she wrestling over Cain sister's brother him being a child she made him a little F she made him a little G and now as he's in the temple she goes up every year to worship God look at my little boy look at my little boy he growing look at this brother bro he growing he he getting so big well that's my boy right there that's my Nehemiah he right he said that's my boy now you got to think that's her boy but she never never told me said no you got to stay in the temple you got to stay in the presence of God Amen God is going to use you God is going bless me over here you just keep I'm blessed by you just serving God Amen and now look at this now but as a child grows the Bible says that now every year then as a child grows she's also got to add to his Gard so when God does something for you it's a testimony on unto you amen and the Bible says you will overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of your testimony amen this woman when she wrestled and overcame is what she what she did and she never forgot she kept tending to her testimony amen she kept taking care of the testimony she kept her testimony the Bible says in Psalm 119 I will not even forget your testimonies oh God because a testimony in a time of trouble will bring you through Paul every time Paul got into a jam he told his testimony and the testimony now was I met Jesus Christ now if that's your testimony tonight then you might need to wrestle a little bit because after you wrestle you're going to have a testimony now when you have a testimony then now ain't no devil in hell can shake you from it brother then say well why you come to church on Sunday night because it's better than a Super Bowl [Applause] brother oh come on now he said why you going to CH because it's better than basketball brother he say why you go to church because it's better than Oprah sister you know come on you say oh why you come to church on Sunday night because I'm eating real good on Sunday night we got a buffet on Sunday night we eat good and the service come it ain't no ain't much unbelief in the atmosphere you just come and you say Lord thank you Lord for your grace Lord because you're wrestling to overcome so you see as time goes on people have less church service people want to pray less because now they have this big onee monster at home and I want you now brother said I blow it up with a shotgun but I want you to think about this now you see that one ey monster I heard this God say this he sent this to me I tell you we clo he sent me his email and it said it was talking about a guy in the house and he said this guy was in his house and he said this particular guy he says he's always there and he said this guy basically like a bum he said he didn't pay no bills he didn't try to help out around the house he didn't do nothing but all he tried to do was basically use up power and the power he kept using he said he sit there and you know every now he wasn't no Christian and he said every now and then he said he let out a cuss word and I said my you know you keep him in your house he said but let him let him cuss every now and then and he said I just want to tell you he said the bottom email said I'm your televis now I said I said now M now you see I want you to think about this I tell you I don't know why I'm saying this but I tell you this when you look at a cable B think about and you calculate how much you spend per month paying a cable $60 $70 a year say $70 a year what $840 a year $840 almost $1,000 a year almost $900 a year and you think about now if what if you say well one day I want to get a car for my kids or I want to maybe let them go to school ,000 every year and then just say you let it compound with interest and by the time they now get out of high school what do they have from you not watching t amen and say I sit there and they say well you know I like to watch you know the Cooking Channel I like Rachel Ray you know I just I just like Rachel right she's a good cook now think about his brother Richard well you know you know but I like you know I like you know the black guy with the beard he he can make some ribs now but I want you to think now but you watching one channel for $70 a month well you know I like Naas Geographic too now I like the whales I like to see the whales now think about that you see reasoning comes in and you see after you reason enough now it's well you know it's Sunday night but you know what coming on so guess what they do they say we got to fix let's get you a DVR brother we going to record it for you can see it when you come back it's just an extra 9.99 a month now you another $120 in the hole now you $1,000 in well you know Passion of Christ coming out you know if you want to see it on HD you know you know you want a clear picture it's Jesus Christ we talking about let's go ahead and get a 42 in flat screen and you know you need a Blu-ray come on you can't watch Jesus you got a blue you need a Blu-ray brother now think about it you see the reason it comes in and you go to Best Buy and you're like my and you know God tell you better keep on walking you better keep on walking you think now what you think you better keep on turn your head turn your head because you see it's entertainment yeah and you see that entertainment you see we don't remember he said without money and without price and you see the price is and say no yes there probably some excellent things brother may have DVDs Services whatever but you think about it what you're paying for that and you have to ask God is what is that what God wants you to do and you want to think about the pool that you'll have he says why to try to keep you from reading the word to try to keep you from your promises to keep you from building up the innermost man why because then you say then you see even why children have a hard time paying attention because they're so used to being entertained with their eyes amen so if you entertain with your eyes my my four-year-old two they can use his iPad like nothing daddy gang daddy where's your gang Daddy and then they get right to it I'm like and she too use a computer and they make it so easy you see they make it that's how s is they make it simple for you let me they put it and say one easy payment yes wo you better watch it you better watch it you know hey I'm me tell you cuz it comes in easy but let me tell you it come that wallet real hard and it creates op pressure and when that pressure comes and now it's harder to now do what God wants you to do so I just tell you this at this hour as we wrestle Saints is that let's wrestle and overcome not not because of what we can do but what Christ has already done for us and we just stand tonight as we stand you say I pray God tonight he bless you and I pray that not to keep you that Lord has something that would just bless your heart I just want to read this one scripture as we close and this second Corinthians oh I almost dropped this paper 2 Corinthians 4 I just want please read this with me right before we close it says now look at verse um seven but we have this treasure we have a treasure we have a treasure Sint a treasure that's something that's precious something that may be hid and it says in earn vessels Earth and beess brother Isaac in you is a treasure now want you think God puts a treasure in you and that treasure remember he's coming one day and all that have been seal and have that quickening power he's coming back to come and get you amen so there's a treasure there and he says that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair amen it says persecuted but not forsaken amen cast down but not destroyed always bearing about where in your body that's right now I want you to think this tonight in your body not a tattoo but in not not a pearing in your body there is present sufferings of walking this walk in your body but yet you're not perplexed you're not distressed you're now counted well faithful amen and I want you to keep reading here he says always Bing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body amen come on brother the manifestation that song says you know oh Lord God he says it's manifesting time he says the fruit are on the vine and I want you to think tonight is as we close when you wrestle with God you can't overcome but the only way you can overcome is by faith amen and the key he said the key to the a key a key in the door he said key to the door he says what he says that it's your faith in Christ that unlocks the promise amen as we just bow tonight as we close we just say as we just won't keep you you say Lord gracious Heavenly

come and just say I just love you and I just say oh I tell you it's it's always an honor to come before you you know I know it's don't get a chance to get up you know even here much but when I come it's always a blessing a blessing for me just to see your faces and you know for me it's something even to come back and still see the Saints pushing on Amen you know what I'm saying I mean come on it's got to be somebody pushing for and come on like here there you know everybody can't be fallowing off you know I mean you can't you see you thinking I want you to see this you see I tell you this you see like I tell you I I just thought about this on that man I met on the plane you know I told this guy I said you know what this man I showed you I said name William Brandon I said people I said if you go people pop put this man up like he's the God himself almost I said if you go on the internet you'll see that people say this man nothing but the devil but I said I tell you what God blessed me with was I had an opportunity to listen to him for myself it do say if you go and listen for yourself and if that's a seat of God then God will come and he'll speak to your heart amen because you see there's so many things that when when it comes to reasoning the devil you take a person you read half of the stuff you may see on the internet people you meet that say they know this know that if you read half of it what you'll see is most people don't even know the Bible that's right don't even know the Bible heard this one guy he would say oh I had the all these questions and you know people couldn't answer them and they say I said Lord nobody can answer your question and he said that's why he said now in in the first part of his thing he said he's at a church for a long time and he said I don't believe that everybody that that didn't believe all of John the Baptist said made I said I said he was a man that was sent from God and you think about this a man sent from God yes he's born by sex but a man sent by God and Jesus said there's no greater born among women save this man himself and Isaiah prophesied this man to come and you tell me that you don't have to listen to him to accept Jesus Christ now I want you to see this in this hour he said there'll be many false Christ false prophets but I want you to see as you wrestle may you come closer together in love and then let God always deal with your heart first and your family and then you'll see the grace of God in your life so I just wanted to I don't know why I just come about want to tell you that and may God richly bless you love you all love you bless you you brother Brooks amen you come bless you [Music] brother bless oh I was so blessed and still blessed amen he was talking about preachers don't know the Bible I had was at a funeral one of my close friends she thought she just wouldn't accept the message and she went want because she wanted to preach but when she died I went to a funeral and even her Pastor said well when I get to heaven I'm going to go straighten Paul out and tell him he was wrong about women preaching like you won't get to heaven and you see Paul to be from a distance but you know that just show you people don't have a revelation but you know the scripture calls us Lady Grace did you know that amen I saw some things in the scriptures while he was preaching that have never seen before and I thought oh here is Hannah coming before a prophet receive a a a word from a Prophet but Hannah I thought my God I said because every type and Shadow you have a type and you have a shadow and so an a birth seven son her name is Grace and Grace met Grace and The Headstone come down to Lady Grace saying Grace Grace and I thought if it wasn't for Hannah maybe we wouldn't be here she gave birth to seven that's right then I thought about Jacob who is Israel right because you know you you you you born Israel by seed amen so H and I thought if Jacob hadn't wrestle with the angel amen 144 wouldn't be sealed Amen in one day amen hallelujah one day hallelujah amen because Jacob wrestled with the angel and overcame Israel will wrestle with the same Angel and overcome is that right because a messenger would tell them that saying Jesus that you crucified that that was him and the Bible said they'll gather all to themselves and cry out wrestling with the angels word and be born again I feel the presence of Lord hallelujah amen oh I saw so much I'm like oh my God Amen Hallelujah you see because brother said the the bride reads between the lines amen so she sees what she's supposed to do Hannah set herself aside cried before the Lord give me a son you know it's like coming out of denomination we don't see what they're producing where's ours amen yes sir amen come on where's ours amen and we have to get before like Hannah did amen and says Lord I give him back to you amen amen amen yes Hallelujah if it works for Israel it works for us amen ain't God good amen that was a powerful message I really enjoyed the thing I like the thing I like was Lord I ain't going to let you go no sir and here the angel say let me go he said not denyall I'm not going to let you go I like that amen but you know what really got me was the woman because you know I I learned through Brother Rich you know he gave me a little uh little u YouTube thing you know because the word dog is the word God or the word God backwards is the word dog right and all I could think about was the Gentile dog I was that God made me a God he turned it around come on somebody is that right all you got to do is take one word and put it in the mirror and it'll change place with you come on right right the Bible say look in the mirror of the word come on somebody I won't forget where I came from but when I look at the word that I am Hallelujah come on somebody it's just the grace of God I've been blessed brother just just anointed I got a lot of work to do God is so good to us let's just give God a round [Applause] and I know for a fact like brother Bram say God will purposely try to discourage you he will purposely try to run you away but you got to say I ain't going nowhere right he tried to run Peter away he said I ain't going nowhere right that angel tried to discourage Jacob Jacob said I ain't going nowhere all right is that right amen tried to discourage that woman amen who who said Lord you dog oh come on somebody amen she said and that might be true it is I know what I am I'm a dog to me I want to meet her I want to shake her hand right we are so blessed people and somehow we're going to see how blessed we are one of these old days that's scripture at the end brother just for me a treasure a Earthly treasure treasure treasure treasure it was just so much I can't go over what he's all he said but I like the I like the I been you know this magnet thing is I like that magnet thing I like that magnet thing cuz if you get in in in contact if you get in the presence of a magnet and you magnet too or you attracted to the magnet you don't have to worry about getting to it you just get CL nothing go hey I'm going to let y'all go but it's I can't I'm just enjoying Jesus you love the Lord come give us a song brother and then we'll be dismissed like you said brother yes i' rather be here in front of T watching superl I'm serious I ain't never understood that even when I was Pentecostal still God was B more to me than the Super Bowl now y'all y'all know every one of us know God has personally talked to us you have heard from God there is no there are
