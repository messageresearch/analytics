[40:26] that was good thank you for appreciate
[40:32] you God is good to us we're living in
[40:39] the last days
[40:40] i'ma continue I'm gonna continue to
[40:44] remind you and remind us by way of
[40:48] saying those things because Satan is
[40:55] such a slicker here he'll make us forget
[41:02] that these are you know the last days
[41:05] I'm not gonna be long tonight but I just
[41:09] want to share a thought when I believe
[41:15] God would have have us to to minister to
[41:18] the stalk to yours tonight it's up we
[41:22] were talking about the strength of the
[41:24] Christian the other day we did a part
[41:28] two there in Iowa City but I'd like to
[41:33] even though it's kind of like the same
[41:36] message I would like to basically add I
[41:41] love something to what God would have us
[41:46] to do and if you would just turn with me
[41:50] right now to Isaiah 30 Isaiah 30 and 26
[41:58] yeah
[42:01] appreciate the law for being so good to
[42:03] us I know we're living in the last days
[42:06] and
[42:13] and
[42:18] that's a good thing I believe that's a
[42:25] real good thing and I know that God is
[42:26] going to do just what he said he was
[42:30] going to do I have no doubt in my mind
[42:33] because God is God is God and there's
[42:40] none like it
[42:41] I said Jeremiah didn't I I mean Isaiah
[42:45] did I say Isaiah that's what I meant
[42:46] okay yeah thank you
[42:50] Isaiah 30 and going to read the 26 verse
[42:55] by God's grace
[43:07] moreover the light of the moon shall be
[43:12] as the light of the Sun when the light
[43:16] of the Sun shall be Sevenfold
[43:20] as a light of seven days in the day that
[43:27] the Lord bind it up the breech of his
[43:29] people and he lit the stroke of their
[43:34] room
[43:38] let us pray
[43:41] our Father God we come before you as
[43:45] humbly as we know how
[43:48] Lord your words are past finding out
[43:53] when it come to describing you for
[43:58] there's none like You Lord and there's
[44:00] none that will ever be as you are you're
[44:05] the great one you have made us know that
[44:10] there is none like you father you said
[44:13] if there be another God you have no idea
[44:15] you don't know because you are tell him
[44:21] the self existing one and your master
[44:26] plan you did a great thing and your
[44:30] creation as we are still in all trying
[44:37] to comprehend the mighty grace that you
[44:45] have given unto us the Word of God has
[44:49] told us that the way you think and the
[44:54] way you move Lord has passed finding out
[44:57] when it comes to men but you are so
[45:01] gracious and kind to us that you reveal
[45:06] yourself by revelation we're so thankful
[45:12] we're thankful Lord for all that you do
[45:16] for us we pray Heavenly Father that you
[45:20] would be kind to us once again bless us
[45:26] in this word give us words to say speak
[45:32] through these lips of clay remove isaiah
[45:36] out of the way that your people may hear
[45:38] from you your father will be careful to
[45:41] give you the praise glory and honor in
[45:44] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[45:46] you may be seated
[45:54] we often sing that song what a mighty
[45:58] God we serve but I think sometimes we we
[46:05] sing it but not think about what we
[46:08] singing of course we don't know what my
[46:11] tea is unless you had a revelation of
[46:13] what my tea is and through these words
[46:20] we sing we must understand that there is
[46:22] definition there are things that have
[46:24] become mighty to us things that we know
[46:28] we could not have achieved or
[46:30] accomplished ourselves things that we
[46:33] know had to have come by the grace of
[46:35] God those things are mighty when you
[46:40] know as in our human ability we falter
[46:43] we come short but yet and still God
[46:47] comes in and he works it out oh my I'm
[46:53] really really tickled inside happiest of
[46:59] word joy how he won't express it because
[47:03] I realized that absolutely no way I
[47:06] could be lost and when that revelation
[47:12] strikes you there's a joy overflowing in
[47:18] denominations we we always hoped you
[47:22] know we tried to have faith but still
[47:25] there was a little element of
[47:27] uncertainty and the least little thing
[47:31] we would do we would condemn ourselves
[47:32] in not knowing where God was gonna stand
[47:36] with us and whether he was going to
[47:38] forgive us even though the word God said
[47:41] he would but somehow we we didn't have
[47:46] that full revelation of the grace of God
[47:49] and what he thinks about us I think even
[47:53] now in this message we we falter as if
[47:57] God and we judge ourselves as if God if
[48:02] we we think to ourselves that God didn't
[48:05] see that well he didn't know that
[48:08] and sometimes we do things that we
[48:11] should not do and we say God why did you
[48:13] let me do that instead of taking the
[48:16] blame
[48:17] instead of saying god this is me I did
[48:21] this through weakness you didn't let me
[48:24] I pushed over your will I'm guilty and I
[48:29] think when we approach God in that way
[48:31] we get a quicker answer because remember
[48:36] it is up it is the fallens man to always
[48:39] blame God yeah is that right the woman
[48:45] said Lord the man you gave me and the
[48:48] man said Lord the woman you gave me know
[48:52] though you know the the woman said the
[48:53] serpent and the man said the woman so it
[48:57] was always that where we we always like
[49:00] to look this way in that way instead of
[49:02] looking inward and I think that's why
[49:06] God gives us the Holy Spirit to check us
[49:10] every time we err in our way of thoughts
[49:14] he's there to keep us lined up with the
[49:18] Word of God as that song says it's me
[49:22] it's me it's me o lord standing in the
[49:25] need of nobody but me Lord I'm the one
[49:30] that needs the help yes we used to think
[49:35] that one time we could blame the devil
[49:38] and then brother branham comes along and
[49:41] tells us that our greatest enemy is
[49:42] ourselves so some of the things that we
[49:47] blame the devil for it was ourselves and
[49:50] did it so in reality there is no way out
[49:54] there's only one escape and that is to
[49:57] be hidden in Jesus he is our only hiding
[50:03] place
[50:04] and as I was teaching the strength of
[50:10] the Christian its Christ in you it's not
[50:15] your muscles and your natural Anatomy
[50:18] that's going to make you a strong man
[50:23] Samson even in his greatest strength
[50:26] could never have done what he did had it
[50:28] not been for the anointing of God we
[50:32] know that God always take the weak
[50:34] things to make them strong and we know
[50:38] by the message of the hour when perfect
[50:42] weakness is there so is perfect strength
[50:44] we used Samson for or illustration the
[50:49] other day and today and we're gonna use
[50:52] him again
[50:53] I like Samson because a men once he was
[50:58] anointed he he kept his eyes on his
[51:02] position and that's what we need to do
[51:06] the Bible tells us that we have been
[51:08] predestinated to to to to adoption we
[51:13] must keep our eyes on adoption because
[51:17] adoption is where we are we are maturing
[51:21] up into it but the authority of it is
[51:25] still ours the anointing in which we
[51:29] have been anointed with is greater then
[51:32] the anointing Pentecost was great
[51:34] anointed with the same Holy Ghost but
[51:38] God has come to do a greater work among
[51:41] the message among the people who are
[51:43] following the Malachi 4 in Revelation 10
[51:47] 7 Luke 17 30 you and I have been chosen
[51:53] out of all the ages you know in some
[51:58] ages you had one here and one there you
[52:01] know a prophet or so-and-so was never
[52:03] ever a great deal of people but now as
[52:08] the body of Christ God has chosen us and
[52:12] the thing about it is he believes in us
[52:16] that we are going to work as a body
[52:20] I like that scripture there in Isaiah
[52:26] now the Lord directed me to that
[52:29] scripture moreover the light of the Moon
[52:33] shall be as the light of the
[52:36] son and you know it didn't say exactly
[52:40] but it said it shall be as the light of
[52:43] the Sun and I have seen moves like that
[52:46] where I had to look in the inner
[52:48] different direction you know to make
[52:51] sure it was the moon and not the Sun
[52:53] anybody you know I've seen that and you
[52:57] know those kind of things they ever
[52:59] appeared before when I was younger but
[53:02] somehow the heavens are declaring the
[53:06] glory of God and it says the light of
[53:10] the Sun shall be Sevenfold and the light
[53:16] of seven days and you and I cannot even
[53:20] imagine the brightness the strength and
[53:24] the glory of seven days of sunlight
[53:29] mixed together to become one now I'm
[53:33] saying this because God is not talking
[53:37] about some scientific thing happening in
[53:43] the universe
[53:44] he's literally talking about a people
[53:48] that will express that kind of power and
[53:53] strength that's why I said the other day
[53:55] we cannot afford to be timid we can't
[53:59] afford to be weak because God is calling
[54:02] us to to manifest his strength in a
[54:08] bride a mini mimic bride and it has the
[54:14] light of the Sun days in the day that
[54:18] the Lord binded up the breach has he
[54:22] done it when the lamb took the book out
[54:27] of the right him hand of him that sat on
[54:31] the throne and when John saw the lamb
[54:35] hallelujah he they all fell down at his
[54:41] feet because amen there was no one
[54:44] worthy to take the book or to loose the
[54:49] seals
[54:49] they're uh Yoshi what I'm saying in
[54:52] other words dead the breach was a chasm
[54:56] it was a gulf it was the thing that kept
[55:00] God and man disconnected but the blood
[55:03] of Jesus Christ I ended up the breach
[55:07] that means we have true total connection
[55:12] with God that's if you want it but it's
[55:17] here that you can be how could I said
[55:20] plug into God without any interferences
[55:25] y'all know what I'm saying it's greater
[55:27] than what we call YouTube or these
[55:31] connections we do with the phone because
[55:33] sometimes when you go down low in a
[55:35] valley you lose connection or sometimes
[55:38] when you go up on a mountain you lose
[55:40] connection but not with Jesus Christ
[55:42] hallelujah if you're in the valley
[55:45] you've got connections if you're on the
[55:48] mountaintop you will have connections
[55:50] y'all understand me
[55:52] so when you see by God's grace that God
[55:55] has revealed to you that you are bright
[55:58] I'm not talking about your failures
[56:00] because God gonna work that out
[56:02] name me one man in the Bible who never
[56:05] failed or never thought you know what I
[56:08] mean who didn't it never did fall or
[56:10] fail everybody excuse me everybody
[56:15] failed except one man who is Jesus
[56:20] Christ hallelujah and that is what makes
[56:24] it so powerful because we are accepted
[56:28] in him I was telling the church and I
[56:31] was telling our precious brother Isaac
[56:35] were on their way back I said supposing
[56:38] he was in a battle or you was being
[56:44] challenging and you said okay I got a
[56:47] brother who's gonna fight for me and
[56:51] your brother says okay I'll fight for
[56:54] you when the when they began to fight I
[56:59] don't feel no pain
[57:02] I'm not getting the licks if anything
[57:07] I'm over there on the other side saying
[57:09] go ahead rather give him a left people
[57:11] all right all right because it's my
[57:15] brother who's fighting in other words
[57:18] I'm on the sidelines resting with joy
[57:22] because I know my brother is going to
[57:25] whip the man he's fighting and if we
[57:31] could see God in that way for the Bible
[57:35] said that the battle is the Lord's right
[57:40] that's what the Bible says and you and I
[57:43] must understand Amen that if the battle
[57:47] is the Lord's then we ought to be over
[57:49] here enjoying the battle because we know
[57:53] by God's grace who's going to win Oh
[57:57] somebody help me it gives you a strength
[58:01] when I said when we find ourselves in a
[58:07] place where a battle is wearing us out
[58:12] is only because you're trying to fight
[58:16] the battle hallelujah hide me or hide me
[58:22] in the clefts of the rock till the storm
[58:26] is passed over when I'm in the clefts of
[58:30] the rock
[58:30] none of the storm is touching me even
[58:33] though I'm viewing it from a distance
[58:36] I'm in a safe place that's where God
[58:40] wants us hallelujah he wants us in a
[58:44] safe place when we find ourselves in a
[58:49] safe place it does not wear us out it
[58:54] doesn't make us weary matter of fact why
[58:58] the battle is going on we are resting
[59:01] and we're gaining strength you know I
[59:05] must understand the Bible is right I
[59:07] told her you see this Bible is is
[59:09] absolute if you don't believe it
[59:12] then it can't be yours because if God
[59:15] only
[59:15] operates by faith by faith by faith
[59:19] hallelujah Hebrews 11 by faith they
[59:22] conquered they divided a day day day day
[59:25] day they conquered and they won every
[59:27] battle and even the battles that they
[59:30] did not see winning with their eyes they
[59:35] still fell asleep knowing that the
[59:39] battle was won you and I must understand
[59:44] we have a heritage the heritage in
[59:48] itself makes us strong I just love this
[59:52] because we remember when Tamar went off
[59:58] and she hid herself like a prostitute
[1:00:02] and Judah came and Judah wanted to buy
[1:00:09] her some food she says no that ain't
[1:00:15] enough tell you what I want from you
[1:00:18] I want no sickness your staff I want
[1:00:22] everything that you possess right now
[1:00:24] that represents your authority and your
[1:00:27] identity and come again I'll give this
[1:00:31] back to you see that's all we won't
[1:00:35] write whatever it takes to get from God
[1:00:39] his identity his authority his position
[1:00:46] whatever that is give it to me as a
[1:00:49] token - that's what the Holy Ghost is it
[1:00:52] is just our earnest and honest
[1:00:55] downpayment of the real deal of what
[1:00:59] you're going to get over there you see
[1:01:01] what this Holy Ghost is doing to you
[1:01:04] it's like how can I say it
[1:01:06] it's a germ of life or haha let me put
[1:01:09] it in a term that we can understand it
[1:01:11] but it's molding and making you into the
[1:01:14] very image you yourself up is being made
[1:01:18] and formed and shaped by the Holy Ghost
[1:01:22] his same material I'm gonna talk about
[1:01:25] this flesh I'm talking about the inner
[1:01:28] man
[1:01:29] the intamin like Jean upon Jean upon
[1:01:31] Jean upon Jean like a man even in his
[1:01:34] natural makeup it's not part harsh part
[1:01:38] dog part cow it's all man Jean Jean Jean
[1:01:43] Jean Jean all flash so is it with God we
[1:01:50] have not seen and is haven't heard you
[1:01:54] and I we just we just have no idea but
[1:01:58] we believe it we believe that over there
[1:02:02] like Paul said if this earthly
[1:02:03] Tabernacle be the SOB there's one over
[1:02:06] there waiting for me a building whose
[1:02:09] mill building whose maker is God think
[1:02:12] about it the hand of God the Holy Spirit
[1:02:19] in his I want to say molecular structure
[1:02:21] but if God is not that but I want you to
[1:02:24] understand that if God had to build a
[1:02:27] house for himself in that way he builds
[1:02:30] it according to his material
[1:02:33] he can't take man-made material it has
[1:02:36] to be eternal everlasting you understand
[1:02:40] me and God has taken that same material
[1:02:43] and he's building and making us
[1:02:46] hallelujah what a heritage it ought to
[1:02:51] make you feel better to know that you
[1:02:54] won't have to sin no more you don't have
[1:02:58] to fall to lust and desire anymore but
[1:03:01] God will grant you a body that will have
[1:03:04] none of that in it that's what I tell
[1:03:07] people if I could just get over there
[1:03:08] and have a body like that give it to me
[1:03:10] I'll be satisfied Oh glory to God see
[1:03:19] you and I must understand this Oh
[1:03:22] terrible body right now is so messed up
[1:03:24] and give us trouble all the time
[1:03:26] it's dirt you can't even skip a day from
[1:03:30] washing hallelujah you can if you want
[1:03:33] to but you know anyhow you and I know
[1:03:36] that this day always producing dirt
[1:03:39] right you wash your face in the morning
[1:03:41] and evening
[1:03:42] got more dirt on your face you don't
[1:03:44] believe it use a white wash coffee to
[1:03:46] show you my pond is this thing is dying
[1:03:51] it's rotting y'all believe that this
[1:03:56] flesh is rotting you gotta find another
[1:03:59] place to go you got to find another
[1:04:05] place to go and where are you going to
[1:04:09] go if you're not prepared to go there
[1:04:12] [Music]
[1:04:14] hallelujah
[1:04:15] what does a heritage it is something
[1:04:17] that comes or belongs to one by reason
[1:04:20] of birth Nicodemus you must be born
[1:04:26] again i'ma keep going in there because I
[1:04:29] feel just like you know I think I think
[1:04:31] when we see the fire of God when we see
[1:04:34] what God is doing and what God has done
[1:04:37] amen somehow it does something for you
[1:04:40] on the inside it does for me
[1:04:43] I know people gonna fall I know people
[1:04:46] gonna fall away hallelujah but like the
[1:04:50] psalmist says I'll be like a tree I'll
[1:04:54] be like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:04:58] waters hallelujah knowing that all of
[1:05:02] the virtues of God is flowing through me
[1:05:05] from the roots hallelujah
[1:05:08] not from the top of the tree from the
[1:05:10] roots because each one of my roots
[1:05:13] amen amen is tapped into one is into
[1:05:16] virtue of what is your faith run into
[1:05:18] temperance all of my roots are stressed
[1:05:20] out there and you're sucking the life up
[1:05:23] and guess what as it brings it up it
[1:05:27] will produce the fruits of the spirit
[1:05:31] hallelujah think about it people of God
[1:05:34] our heritage
[1:05:36] whether it be a poverty whether it be of
[1:05:39] suffering is that right did you know
[1:05:42] some of your heritage is suffering
[1:05:45] hallelujah
[1:05:46] Paul said I just don't want to know him
[1:05:48] in the power of his resurrection I want
[1:05:50] to know him in the power of his
[1:05:53] suffering hallelujah because
[1:05:56] man under pressure y'all know that's
[1:06:02] true a man under pressure is what he is
[1:06:07] under pressure fear doesn't matter how
[1:06:12] we fake it
[1:06:13] just put that person under pressure and
[1:06:16] you'll see the real character that's
[1:06:19] right
[1:06:20] the real true characteristics will show
[1:06:23] when it's under pressure that ride get
[1:06:27] him all riled up stirred up and then
[1:06:30] you'll see the real man comes out if
[1:06:34] he's got temper it'll show itself if
[1:06:40] he's meek and gentle it is sure itself
[1:06:42] but put him on the pressure watch and
[1:06:46] God puts all his children under test to
[1:06:50] see whether they're any flaws in them
[1:06:54] that's why you go through it when you
[1:06:58] think you've overcome things and God put
[1:07:01] them at all the devil to put the
[1:07:02] pressure and then you find out you're
[1:07:06] not where you thought you was only
[1:07:09] because you had a little flaw hey he
[1:07:12] didn't give that to you didn't condemn
[1:07:13] you order or to throw you out
[1:07:15] he's the Potter we're the clay
[1:07:19] hallelujah he's there working all you
[1:07:22] that's why the Bible said in all things
[1:07:26] give things hallelujah all things work
[1:07:30] together for the good of them you may
[1:07:33] not understand it and you may not need
[1:07:35] to understand it but know that God is
[1:07:37] the one who's working it out you ask God
[1:07:41] to you pray to God I want to be just
[1:07:43] like you and God see these things in you
[1:07:46] how else he's gonna get it out hmm
[1:07:50] if there's a little spirit of lust or
[1:07:53] whatever in you amen how can God get it
[1:07:55] out of you he's got to present something
[1:07:58] that's going to pull on that lust spirit
[1:08:02] hallelujah oh come on somebody it's the
[1:08:06] truth that's what James says gen say if
[1:08:09] there be Oh Tim
[1:08:10] station is it me God don't tell nobody
[1:08:14] hallelujah but Jesus said there is no
[1:08:17] darkness in me that's what we want to be
[1:08:20] like we want to get to the place where
[1:08:22] there is no darkness in us this is what
[1:08:27] I'm looking at
[1:08:28] I'm looking at a flawless bride a
[1:08:34] flawless bride no wrinkles no blemish no
[1:08:39] spots she's flawless because she's gonna
[1:08:43] need the blood she's allowed the blood
[1:08:46] the cleanser she's allowed the blood to
[1:08:49] give us strength hallelujah she's
[1:08:51] allowed the blood to give her power
[1:08:54] that's what she's doing
[1:08:56] God loves you just the way you are
[1:09:00] he's our unconditional love it it every
[1:09:03] time you try to walk out listen this is
[1:09:05] what I said every time you try to do
[1:09:08] right before God you think the devil is
[1:09:10] gonna say okay go ahead you all right
[1:09:12] you all right no the devil is gonna run
[1:09:15] and he's gonna try to trip you he's
[1:09:18] gonna try to do everything he can to
[1:09:20] make you think that the voice and the
[1:09:24] Commission that you heard earlier didn't
[1:09:26] come from God he's a smooth character
[1:09:34] hallelujah is not by my power
[1:09:37] it's not by might but it's by my spirit
[1:09:41] saith the Lord that's what people they
[1:09:44] don't understand in the grace of God hey
[1:09:47] man when you understand the grace of God
[1:09:49] you keep all hallelujah if I fall I get
[1:09:53] up hallelujah what is it I got a race to
[1:09:57] run hallelujah that's what we used to
[1:09:59] sing that song in that open the coast of
[1:10:01] church I believe I run on I got a race
[1:10:05] to run
[1:10:06] Levi run oh I got a race to run
[1:10:09] Levi Ronald I got a race to run all

[1:10:16] hallelujah hear me that ride the vision
[1:10:21] says let
[1:10:23] him that readeth run no time is short
[1:10:29] this is one of the shortest ages of all
[1:10:33] ages and we got to make every minute
[1:10:36] count
[1:10:37] what is it God forming himself shaving
[1:10:42] himself amen into the bride of Jesus
[1:10:45] Christ hallelujah oh man kenosis not
[1:10:52] that God threw up he's poured himself
[1:10:54] into as he was as we were said like he
[1:10:57] did Moses he stepped into Moses that's
[1:11:00] what we need God to do step into us
[1:11:04] hallelujah
[1:11:06] Christians are saved by grace so they
[1:11:09] should walk humbly before God no
[1:11:12] Christians should ever have a prideful
[1:11:13] spirit on them hallelujah
[1:11:16] the Bible says according to Ephesians
[1:11:18] for by grace are you saved through faith
[1:11:20] and that not of yourself
[1:11:23] it is a gift of God whew God gave it to
[1:11:27] you right now that works lest any man
[1:11:31] should boast for we are his workmanship
[1:11:34] created in Christ Jesus I love that
[1:11:37] created in Christ Jesus not over him not
[1:11:41] under him not around him but in him all
[1:11:44] in area that means why we're in him
[1:11:47] there are hands of God's creating us
[1:11:50] hallelujah unto good works which God had
[1:11:54] before ordained that we should walk in
[1:11:56] them for by grace are you saved through
[1:11:59] faith and that not of yourselves it is
[1:12:02] the gift of God not of works lest any
[1:12:06] man should boast
[1:12:08] we give testimonies but our testimonies
[1:12:12] our testimonies are not boasting now
[1:12:15] Alleluia but we are his workmanship
[1:12:18] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[1:12:21] which God hath for ordained that we
[1:12:25] should walk in them is ordained for
[1:12:29] ordained before we got here it's been
[1:12:32] ordained hallelujah and when it's all
[1:12:35] day is like
[1:12:37] David when he was anointed by Samuel
[1:12:42] hallelujah
[1:12:43] that little old lad nobody didn't like
[1:12:45] him I like the way that brother does
[1:12:47] said that even his daddy was ashamed of
[1:12:49] him ha yay you got another son somewhere
[1:12:56] me yeah I guess so go to God but that
[1:13:02] was the one that God wanted see
[1:13:05] sometimes you don't mess up so bad the
[1:13:08] family might look like they ashamed of
[1:13:10] you but you're the one God wants
[1:13:12] hallelujah you're the kind that God can
[1:13:14] use there's nothing like a person who
[1:13:17] saved who know they needed saving you
[1:13:20] find a person who don't feel like okay
[1:13:22] they're contributing to the community or
[1:13:25] the economy of God it'll never work you
[1:13:29] love the Lord whoo 2nd Timothy 3:12 says
[1:13:34] yay all that will live godly in Christ
[1:13:38] Jesus shall suffer persecution you're
[1:13:42] gonna get it
[1:13:44] y'all sounds so exciting hallelujah
[1:13:50] no don't bring me no bad news but
[1:13:52] they're here if you're gonna live godly
[1:13:55] in Christ you're gonna suffer
[1:13:58] nobody likes suffering but it's part of
[1:14:03] your inheritance jesus said if you
[1:14:06] follow me take up your cross and follow
[1:14:09] me is that right sometimes we look at
[1:14:14] things and we fail to see that in all
[1:14:17] this that we go through God is still in
[1:14:21] the mix of the whole thing who would
[1:14:25] have thought now think about it you
[1:14:27] would talk about as we said the other
[1:14:29] day they here was Goliath 9 feet 9
[1:14:35] inches tall and I don't believe a man in
[1:14:41] here would have went up and try to fight
[1:14:44] him
[1:14:46] on his own you know some people well if
[1:14:51] I was like David I would have thought
[1:14:53] that lying let's not lie David only chat
[1:14:57] fought the lion because he was anointed
[1:14:59] to fight it
[1:15:01] he only whipped a bear because he was
[1:15:03] anointed to whip the bear you can't do
[1:15:06] nothing without the anointing it is the
[1:15:09] anointing of God that destroys the yokes
[1:15:12] hey God's anointing Christ in you he is
[1:15:17] the victor that's why when he in the
[1:15:23] book of Revelation when those 24 elders
[1:15:26] saw him they threw their crowns down and
[1:15:29] they hit the floor showing humility
[1:15:35] because they knew that the victory came
[1:15:38] by that very Lamb hilarya and every one
[1:15:43] of us who are Christians know that there
[1:15:45] is no power within us we have no
[1:15:49] strength the only thing that we what
[1:15:52] makes us Conqueror is Christ that right
[1:15:55] Paul said we're more than conquerors
[1:15:57] through Christ Jesus it is Christ it is
[1:16:01] the anointing it's the god that's in you
[1:16:07] that's the only way we can defeat Satan
[1:16:10] I'm telling you these things because you
[1:16:12] know what in order for us to make a new
[1:16:15] city we must know how to get there how
[1:16:20] are you going to get there to that other
[1:16:22] world without God in you it's the only
[1:16:27] ticket we can't have summer God we must
[1:16:32] have the full statue to make a rapture
[1:16:36] that means you got to die or not I keep
[1:16:39] saying and the more I say this you know
[1:16:41] what's going to happen the more you
[1:16:43] going to fight because you didn't even
[1:16:45] know you had so much of yourself still
[1:16:48] living
[1:16:53] it is a daily fight hour-by-hour it's
[1:16:59] the truth
[1:17:00] it doesn't seem to say to quit I had a
[1:17:05] dream this morning I think it was self
[1:17:11] explanatory maybe it could be something
[1:17:15] I'm not a prophet usually it takes a
[1:17:18] prophet to interpret a dream but in this
[1:17:22] dream I was dreaming I was preaching to
[1:17:25] these Saints whoever they were
[1:17:28] witnessing to him and everyone seemed
[1:17:32] like they had their eyes open but the
[1:17:35] eyes were scaled they were blinded and I
[1:17:40] was trying to explain to them that I see
[1:17:44] and in this group of people there were
[1:17:47] some who were trying to scientifically
[1:17:50] understand what I was talking about when
[1:17:56] I told them I had sight as if they never
[1:17:58] had sight before and it got to a place
[1:18:03] where there were some who wanted to
[1:18:05] capture me and basically tried to
[1:18:10] dissect me to see why my eyes see and
[1:18:14] there's don't you understand what I'm
[1:18:16] saying we're working with a carnal
[1:18:18] church O'Connor people who's trying to
[1:18:21] Connolly understand this message you
[1:18:25] can't do it and there were those in the
[1:18:30] group that did not want to see because
[1:18:32] they never understood what seeing was
[1:18:35] they always have been blinded and when I
[1:18:40] woke up I thought Oh what was that
[1:18:42] you know I dream that thing twice I went
[1:18:45] back to sleep and dreamed again the same
[1:18:49] dream and I thought to myself Lord is
[1:18:53] this what we're going through no matter
[1:18:56] how I preach about a new world and the
[1:18:58] things to come there are people who just
[1:19:01] can't see
[1:19:04] this can't be scientific you can't put
[1:19:07] science in this it's not an equation it
[1:19:12] can't work it out like that
[1:19:13] this come by saying all things are
[1:19:18] possible to them that believe all things
[1:19:23] but if you don't believe if you don't
[1:19:27] believe if you don't take it as as God
[1:19:29] take this world and into my soul let it
[1:19:33] grow let it multiply let it produce the
[1:19:36] image of the word see because man you
[1:19:40] can't do it and I can't do it
[1:19:42] but one thing about sight is that when
[1:19:45] you see nobody can tell you you blind
[1:19:49] huh nobody can take away what you see
[1:19:53] but the blind man he's gonna always be
[1:19:56] stumbling and butting into all kinds of
[1:19:59] things but the man who can see he knows
[1:20:02] how to get around hallelujah is that
[1:20:06] Alright Davis eyes were open but his
[1:20:10] brother's eyes were not right his
[1:20:13] brother's eyes you know that like I said
[1:20:14] here they they capped about in a little
[1:20:18] camping place called Eli which means
[1:20:20] curse it curse it and and here was
[1:20:25] profound they had them profane God
[1:20:27] because here they were serving the
[1:20:29] Living God but they're letting the devil
[1:20:31] curse them just like we do we're not a
[1:20:37] cursed people we're blessed
[1:20:38] let us not cap at a place called Elim
[1:20:41] let us not play Cara a cap in a cursed
[1:20:44] place David didn't set camp he went to
[1:20:49] fight the Giant
[1:20:51] he took on the opposition like I said
[1:20:55] you know something how we understand it
[1:20:57] you know we let like the devil come in
[1:20:59] like Sam God the Philistines coming
[1:21:02] here's your inheritance here's you you
[1:21:04] don't work - all year - to give a
[1:21:05] harvest and here come the the
[1:21:07] Philistines coming up and eating all up
[1:21:09] your your stuff year by year by year and
[1:21:12] the Holy Spirit tells you that when you
[1:21:14] when you pay your tithe and you're gonna
[1:21:16] have an increase and we're let
[1:21:18] never come in and take it away by this
[1:21:20] storm in that storm and we say oh well
[1:21:22] it must be the hand of the Lord it's the
[1:21:24] devil the devil comes to steal kill and
[1:21:27] destroy hallelujah God don't give you
[1:21:30] something and then let the adversary eat
[1:21:32] it up we let the adversary eat it up and
[1:21:36] it's somewhere you need to put a stop to
[1:21:39] it
[1:21:39] hallelujah you need to get mad with the
[1:21:42] devil you need to say stop this and and
[1:21:45] put the Word of God on him you can't
[1:21:48] fight him yourself but the Word of God
[1:21:50] is superior hallelujah the Word of God
[1:21:53] is the absolute victorious winner
[1:21:56] hallelujah of every battle mmm that
[1:22:03] devil says listen this told David I'm
[1:22:05] gonna kill you the fella I'm gonna wipe
[1:22:08] you out mm-hmm
[1:22:09] David says not this one David knew who
[1:22:13] he was he said I'm chosen of God I'm
[1:22:15] chosen by God I've been anointed by the
[1:22:18] Prophet hallelujah he didn't give me a
[1:22:21] little cup of oil he gave me a horse a
[1:22:24] man I've been ordered I've been anointed
[1:22:26] amen from the top of my head to the sole
[1:22:29] of my feet I'm anointed hallelujah
[1:22:33] that's the way God wants us he don't
[1:22:35] want us to feel a little trickle he
[1:22:37] wants us to be an orchard all over
[1:22:39] hallelujah
[1:22:40] have you ever prayed for people and all
[1:22:42] of a sudden you feel that all just just
[1:22:45] go all over your hallelujah what a
[1:22:47] wonderful feeling hallelujah David says
[1:22:50] listen today I would the Lord the Lord
[1:22:53] will deliver you you understand into my
[1:22:57] hands the Lord will deliver you into my
[1:23:00] hands I don't care what the enemy is
[1:23:03] doing see the problem is we don't pray
[1:23:05] prayer is the key to every victory is
[1:23:10] that right when someone is in trouble
[1:23:13] he stood there and he says O Lord once
[1:23:16] more
[1:23:17] might have been a short prayer but it
[1:23:19] was enough hallelujah
[1:23:21] every to son and daughter of God when
[1:23:24] they get under pressure they don't curse
[1:23:27] they pray
[1:23:30] hallelujah y'all know what I'm saying
[1:23:32] that's when you converted Peter was
[1:23:35] under pressure hallelujah he would
[1:23:38] convert it right when he got under
[1:23:40] pressure and then guess what he did he
[1:23:42] cost it didn't mean that he wasn't a
[1:23:46] Christian it means that he who didn't
[1:23:48] have the Holy Ghost he was a follower of
[1:23:51] Christ but he didn't have the substance
[1:23:53] he needed for the pressure of the hour
[1:23:56] let me tell you now the squeeze is going
[1:23:59] to come and if you're not converted
[1:24:02] you'll be like Peter you're swear and
[1:24:05] deny that Jesus is your Lord may God
[1:24:09] help us David said to Goliath listen he
[1:24:14] said I was smite thee and take thy head
[1:24:17] from thee and I will give the caucus of
[1:24:19] the host your caucus of the hosts other
[1:24:22] uh right so we see here like you said
[1:24:25] like I said and I'm taking my time but
[1:24:27] here David did not even have his own
[1:24:29] sword as I said before but he already
[1:24:32] done spoke the word so David gotta find
[1:24:34] a way to cut this thing I love it see
[1:24:39] you don't even have to have the
[1:24:40] equipment ready as long as you speak it

[1:24:49] this giant today I'm tired of this giant
[1:24:54] ruling that's what he was doing he was
[1:24:57] making God look like a failure and the
[1:25:01] Christians of that day who was Israel
[1:25:04] was afraid of the devil and they were up
[1:25:07] in a corner scared like chickens and
[1:25:10] here they were Eagles here come a little
[1:25:16] eager by the name of David we need some

[1:25:24] bat or no matter how hard it comes and
[1:25:26] how disappointing it is god don't get

[1:25:54] repented from your heart God knows your
[1:25:56] heart and if you truly repented and

[1:26:01] repentance you go on hallelujah yeah

[1:27:13] the beasts of the field the beasts of
[1:27:15] the earth

[1:27:19] just that when you speak a word you
[1:27:23] follow through with the word is that
[1:27:29] right this is the this is the profound
[1:27:31] statement he made that I love David said
[1:27:36] to the Assembly you shall know that the
[1:27:40] Lord save it not with sword and spear
[1:27:45] for the battle is the Lord's and He will
[1:27:50] give you into our hands no matter who
[1:27:55] you are
[1:27:55] adversaries
[1:27:56] yes the battle is a lord you don't have
[1:28:00] to watch their moves like you playing
[1:28:02] some kind of checkers or or what's
[1:28:05] another game chess you don't watch that
[1:28:08] cuz God had already done checked make
[1:28:11] the devil already before the game
[1:28:13] started huh but you got to use what you
[1:28:21] got
[1:28:22] you say brother Brooks I ain't got
[1:28:24] enough but a little bit of faith that's
[1:28:25] all God need he don't need a mountain
[1:28:28] fool to do what he need to do he said
[1:28:30] you have faith of a mustard seed a lot
[1:28:34] of people say the size of them us to see
[1:28:36] but he's not working with the size he's
[1:28:37] working with the the quality of the seed
[1:28:39] the quality of the scene is that it
[1:28:42] can't be hybrid without it can't be
[1:28:44] mixed with anything it's silent
[1:28:47] hallelujah you're not gonna have a
[1:28:49] mustard and the oak tree put together it
[1:28:51] can't work is that seed is not designed
[1:28:54] that way y'all hear me
[1:28:57] right because did you know in order for
[1:29:00] seed to be hybrid you have to put in
[1:29:02] bacteria bacteria has to be injected
[1:29:08] into that particular plant of particular
[1:29:11] C in order to bring it to a hybrid state
[1:29:16] must of C can't receive bacteria no
[1:29:21] demon can get into this it is all pure
[1:29:24] faith hallelujah Lord of God no weapon
[1:29:29] that's why the Bible says according to
[1:29:31] Isaiah 54 I'm almost done no weapon that
[1:29:34] is formed against thee shall prosper
[1:29:36] y'all believe that I believe it no
[1:29:39] weapon none
[1:29:42] I don't care pick out a Ouija board I
[1:29:45] don't care if they fly on a broom I
[1:29:48] don't care if they got all kind of
[1:29:50] witchcraft I've stretched stuff all
[1:29:53] around the house no weapon y'all better
[1:29:57] hear what I'm singing Alleluia
[1:30:00] you don't know who you're pumping into
[1:30:02] sometimes you're pumping right up into
[1:30:04] witches and they know you even when you
[1:30:06] don't know them you can't be afraid of
[1:30:10] this stuff
[1:30:11] we're living in the age where the church
[1:30:13] is being led by a witch hmm witchcraft
[1:30:17] all throughout the church's signs and
[1:30:20] wonders that's what brother branham's
[1:30:22] was trying to tell us there were witches
[1:30:24] even in the Pentecostal churches doing
[1:30:26] signs and wonders and the people of God
[1:30:28] was so spiritually ignorant they thought
[1:30:30] it was the Holy Ghost and the same stuff
[1:30:33] is happening now no weapon y'all don't
[1:30:41] know what I'm talking about do you
[1:30:42] I've had several witches trying to put
[1:30:45] spells on me and God didn't allow it to
[1:30:48] happen
[1:30:48] it bounced right back they know me
[1:30:53] hallelujah whoa they know the God in me
[1:30:57] no weapon that is formed against thee
[1:31:00] shall prosper and every tongue that
[1:31:02] shall rise against thee in judgment thou
[1:31:04] shalt condemn this is the heritage of
[1:31:07] the service of the Lord and their
[1:31:09] righteousness is of me sayeth the Lord
[1:31:11] so let them come up there everybody
[1:31:13] who's seen my faults come up but God
[1:31:16] said that that day no tongue nothing
[1:31:20] they can say against me it's going to
[1:31:23] prosper hallelujah give me a couple of
[1:31:26] more scriptures Jeremiah 29 1 through 4
[1:31:28] 11 through 14 says for I know the
[1:31:31] thoughts that I think toward you says
[1:31:34] the Lord thoughts of peace not of evil
[1:31:37] to give you and expected in then shall
[1:31:41] you call upon me and ye shall go and
[1:31:43] pray unto me and I will hearken unto you
[1:31:46] ye shall seek me and find me when you
[1:31:51] shall cease your search for me with all
[1:31:54] your heart and I will be found of you
[1:31:57] said the Lord and I would turn away your
[1:31:59] captivity and we gather you from all the
[1:32:02] nations and from all the places whether
[1:32:04] I have driven you saith the Lord and I
[1:32:07] will bring you again in the place where
[1:32:09] I calls you to be carried away captive
[1:32:11] is that right whoo somebody I'll bring
[1:32:15] you right on back to Jerusalem oh the
[1:32:19] Lord according to Jeremiah 31:31 3 says
[1:32:23] the
[1:32:24] as appealing to me up old unto me saying
[1:32:26] yeah I have loved thee with an
[1:32:31] everlasting love therefore with
[1:32:34] loving-kindness have i drawn these don't
[1:32:39] thank god up here ready to whip you for
[1:32:41] your failures he's drawing you with
[1:32:45] loving-kindness all of us know we should
[1:32:48] be dead by now
[1:32:53] thank God we're not living under the law
[1:32:56] ha oh Jesus have mercy loving-kindness
[1:33:00] hallelujah amen Oh Lord I'm enjoying
[1:33:04] myself oh I know where the grace of God
[1:33:07] has been in my life that's why I can't
[1:33:10] just judge people I can't just look down
[1:33:12] on him because I know God has had plenty
[1:33:14] of grace and mercy on me
[1:33:17] romans 8:17 that if your children then
[1:33:20] heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with
[1:33:22] Christ if so be that you suffer with him
[1:33:25] that you may be also glorified together
[1:33:28] and you know what we ought to consider
[1:33:31] ourselves blessed but the Bible said
[1:33:34] those who live godly in christ shall
[1:33:36] suffer persecution and if we're not
[1:33:40] suffering persecution from some area
[1:33:42] some relative some something something
[1:33:46] is wrong because there is no way you're
[1:33:48] gonna live it right and somebody ain't
[1:33:51] gonna they gonna everybody gonna be
[1:33:52] happy about it
[1:33:54] no they gonna thank you oh you think you
[1:33:56] better than everybody else you know that
[1:33:58] they say I didn't say it you did right
[1:34:08] that's what that's what heresy our King
[1:34:12] Jesus said thou say you did right
[1:34:18] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:34:20] Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us
[1:34:22] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:34:23] places in Christ according as he has
[1:34:26] chosen us in him before the foundation
[1:34:28] of the world that we should be holy and
[1:34:31] without blame before him in now do you
[1:34:36] think God gonna fail
[1:34:37] at his word he said it when it's done
[1:34:41] when it's finished you'll be blameless
[1:34:45] you'll be holy you'll be full of love
[1:34:49] that's God's working you can't do it but
[1:34:54] you need to trust the God they can let
[1:34:56] him be strong and you put that word in
[1:34:58] you and when the devil comes and he
[1:35:00] makes you fall or makes you angry
[1:35:02] gets you upset you know as though you're
[1:35:04] saved by your own righteousness you're
[1:35:07] not say about your by your own you're
[1:35:10] saved by the righteousness of Christ oh
[1:35:13] Lord I don't know I feel like shout I'm
[1:35:27] enjoying myself I feel his presence I
[1:35:29] feel his love I tell you what I do
[1:35:30] having predestinated us unto the
[1:35:34] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:35:35] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:35:38] of his will see sometimes service will
[1:35:41] go like this I often think about it when
[1:35:44] Jesus was preaching heat the boss said
[1:35:46] he wasn't screaming in Holland like me
[1:35:47] the Bible said his voice was so soft you
[1:35:51] could barely hear him in the street all
[1:35:53] right he just spoke it and he captivated
[1:35:57] the people right so you got to
[1:36:00] understand it is a variety of ministries
[1:36:02] but sometimes God just want to talk it
[1:36:04] out oh yeah who John 17:20 for two more
[1:36:12] Scripture one more scripture acts a
[1:36:14] father I will that they also whom thou
[1:36:17] has given me be with me where I am that
[1:36:20] they may behold my glory which thou has
[1:36:23] given me for thou loveth me before the
[1:36:26] foundation of the world can you imagine
[1:36:29] when we get over there and we see a
[1:36:31] number that no man can number and every
[1:36:36] body has testimonies I don't know how
[1:36:39] long testimony service don't last
[1:36:41] problem it's coming
[1:36:45] hallelujah and to see everybody think oh
[1:36:48] my god
[1:36:50] especially this layer to C&H we'd only
[1:36:52] we only see a few people right you know
[1:36:54] hoping that you know trusting we're
[1:36:56] gonna be one of them and you say Oh God
[1:36:58] who's gonna come out of this right I
[1:37:00] mean come on it ain't like in brother
[1:37:02] branham's day when they had all those
[1:37:03] people thousands of people singing you
[1:37:06] know and you hearing the roar of the
[1:37:07] waters I actually I'll be honest with
[1:37:11] you I was back there listening to to
[1:37:13] y'all sing and I thought wow more people
[1:37:15] in there that I thought was gonna come
[1:37:18] and then when I got any on my okay this
[1:37:22] must be supernatural yeah I'm serious I
[1:37:28] thought it was more people praise the
[1:37:32] Lord amen my momma closed just now but
[1:37:36] but I wasn't wanted to understand the
[1:37:38] goal what God is trying to bring us
[1:37:41] through to in in this and all that I've
[1:37:43] been preaching tonight and for these
[1:37:45] three three services and it comes from
[1:37:50] Isaiah what I read earlier I want you to
[1:37:54] think and meditate on this if you if you
[1:37:57] just can remember this that the breach
[1:37:58] is already been bind God has already
[1:38:02] fixed it Christ has already feet fixed
[1:38:05] it you can have a permanent connection
[1:38:09] with God never to be broken again
[1:38:12] but it says moreover the light of the
[1:38:14] Moon shall be as the light of the Sun
[1:38:16] and the light of the Sun shall be
[1:38:19] Sevenfold as a light of seven days now
[1:38:23] that is a light that we always say we've
[1:38:27] hear people say when they approach God
[1:38:29] after death or whatever whenever they
[1:38:30] have these experiences they say that it
[1:38:33] was brighter than the noonday Sun or
[1:38:35] brighter than any light they've ever
[1:38:37] seen right this is the kind of
[1:38:40] reflection of God in other words God the
[1:38:43] fullness of Christ is being reflected
[1:38:45] through the bride right the Sevenfold
[1:38:48] attributes the Sevenfold power and of
[1:38:52] God is now being reflected through the
[1:38:55] but it must come to that otherwise the
[1:38:57] scripture is wrong
[1:38:59] and the Scriptures cannot be broken it
[1:39:01] cannot be wrong
[1:39:02] right as the light of seven days and in
[1:39:06] the day that the Lord binded of the
[1:39:09] breech of his people and he lit the
[1:39:11] stroke of their wound what was a stroke
[1:39:14] sin he heals it by telling us and
[1:39:18] showing us he meant that that Christ
[1:39:21] paid at all all our debt has been paid
[1:39:26] we can walk out of this world perfectly
[1:39:29] home because sin has been abolished in
[1:39:33] the in the Christians life now God has
[1:39:37] given us opportunity to let his life
[1:39:40] work and live in us is Christ in you is
[1:39:44] God perfecting you it's God taking you
[1:39:50] through the valleys and and all is God
[1:39:52] but at the end of the day you'll be made
[1:39:58] perfect we're standing it's image we're
[1:40:00] standing his glory hallelujah we'll be
[1:40:03] just like him and I'm gonna tell you
[1:40:05] something just like it's hard to believe
[1:40:07] it when I say not hard to believe you
[1:40:09] and I can't imagine what it is what it
[1:40:12] will be like to be just like him nice
[1:40:16] tan
[1:40:22] with all our failures
[1:40:36] and as the prophet of god said we were
[1:40:38] born failures failures to begin with you
[1:40:42] think God didn't know that not one time
[1:40:46] I have man been ever to be able to keep
[1:40:48] her covered not one time every time we
[1:40:55] promised God something most of time we
[1:40:58] come up short but when God is ready to
[1:41:01] deliver us he deliver us once and for
[1:41:04] all and then we'll never go back when
[1:41:08] God gets ready to take you to the next
[1:41:10] level he takes you there to the next
[1:41:12] level not based upon your goodness but
[1:41:16] based upon his grace and His mercy and
[1:41:19] his appointed time God has an appointed
[1:41:22] time for all don't get discouraged
[1:41:28] you hear me say many time every ear of
[1:41:31] corn don't butcher at the same time they
[1:41:34] could be in the same field they can be
[1:41:37] on the same plant and they still grow at
[1:41:40] a different rate and all of us we come
[1:41:43] into Christ at a different time we're
[1:41:46] growing at a different rate but the good
[1:41:48] part about it is that we all cause we're
[1:41:52] all wheats however you want to say it
[1:41:55] but God has a harvest and we are now
[1:41:59] living in that harvest time and as we
[1:42:03] say I hear the combine coming you can
[1:42:06] see the dust in the distance we don't
[1:42:09] have much longer to remain people of God
[1:42:13] don't look at yourself keep your eyes on
[1:42:16] Christ onward Christian soldier marching
[1:42:20] as to war with the cross of Jesus going
[1:42:24] on before it is not your way your work
[1:42:28] that gets you into heaven is the works
[1:42:31] of God because you have believed and
[1:42:33] trusted in his salvation and his
[1:42:37] sacrifice you love the Lord
