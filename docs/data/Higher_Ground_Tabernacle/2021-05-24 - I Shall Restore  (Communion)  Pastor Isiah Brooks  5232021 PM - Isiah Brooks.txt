TRANSCRIPT
========================================
cup there's nothing like drinking out of a dirty glass or cup so if god is going to use you he wants the inside cleansed and therefore if the inside is cleansed the outside is going to take care of itself amen this morning we showed you about the two trees we showed you how it was in the beginning and when god made uh nature or created nature nature he he created male and female and believe it you would not believe it or not it also uh this also applied to trees flowers everything male and female it was showing god's nature we talked about this morning where god wants to restore us where god wants where we're headed we must have a vision the bible says without a vision of people perish you see and you can't have a vision without a prophet amen because it's that prophet who's ordained to bring the vision to the people so let us read genesis 3 and 9 and the lord god and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou let us pray heavenly father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us we thank you lord for being our all in all and we appreciate everything that you have done for us and everything that you are doing for us it's so wonderful lord to know that you are eternal you are a god that cannot die you are the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end a god who had no beginning and has no ending we don't have to worry about the work not being completed because you completed this work before the foundation of the world and the bible tells us that you placed our names in the lamb's book of life before the world began for this we thank you lord because we realize oh god you master of the universe you are the sweet eternity that we're looking forward to spending with bless the service bless the peoples hearts and minds god give us what we stand in need of and we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated one of the things that i learned and heard by way of listening to [Music] the restoration of the bride tree uh brother branham began to tell us that there is a law or there are laws that uh make things work the way they work there is a law that the fish uses not consciously he is not at a drawing board trying to figure out the math to how to hold his breath as long as he does or how to swim to the top or sink to the bottom it's a law that's in his genetics or in his genes that seem to enforce the things that he needs to be done in order to survive uh and that is the same way with birds birds don't have to go to school to learn how to fly but they need to know how the law works and i don't know the bird language but i'm sure mama and daddy just knows how to tweet just right in order for that bird to understand that he must let go and let god because as long as the bird is afraid to fly he never will fly the reason being because he thinks flying is something that he really has to do and learn himself but the only thing that the bird has to learn is to let go and let god the element of flying is already in him the ability to do it is already in him he was born that way the burden itself could never be a fish and the fish could never be a bird because they are operating by two different laws so is it with every animal they have laws that they that are within them that god put in their nature and in that nature god operates in them to do and perform as he would uh according to his plan so is it with mankind when god created us we were under the law of life that's all we knew we didn't know evil we didn't know how to do evil it wasn't in our genes to do evil but we learn how to do evil by way of the knowledge the tree of the knowledge of good and evil now we know that when adam fell he because he was the amateur god of of the earth all of his kingdom all of his uh subjects were fallen to and you know that's how it is even in any battle if you can get to the king you have already destroyed the host and um you know that's how it was in the battle of the garden of eden when lucifer and uh in the form of a serpent uh fought and they battled in a spiritual way first of all and we find out that the the serpent won and of course this whole earth and his atmosphere became the property of the devil and that's why we wrestle now not against flesh and blood but we wrestle against principalities and powers kingdoms and rulers because of the fall satan has been able to take those demons that once was angel and give them territories where they can rule and reign but they rule and reign according to their own will yet and still god takes that will and work it toward our good now the bible according to joelle tells us that god promised to restore but before i go there i want to say that here in the beginning when god was questioning adam adam where art thou and that's basically the question that every sinner or every man should always answer you need to know where you are and adam a man knew that he wasn't in the same place he was before the fall he understood that something drastically had happened and now he's experiencing the absence of god now we didn't know what that felt like until we saw the second adam when he was on the cross and god had separated himself from him brother bannon said that that that was a time that was really hard for him because he had never been out of the presence of god but he became our sin that we might become the righteousness of god and so god could not fellowship with darkness god could not fellowship with sin even though his son jesus was made sin he separated himself and there jesus died as a man and he cried out and he cried out with anguish my god my god why hast thou forsaken me you see in this term god forsook adam but in the beginning the first adam forsook god but you see they had fallen one fell because of the flesh and the other one surrendered amen because of the sin that the first adam committed now we are at a place when you say restore what do you mean god's word cannot come back void and i know you hear me say this all the time but the earth still need to be replenished the earth has never been replenished with the sons of god and when god gave adam the first adam that commandment or that word he wasn't talking about the serpents he was talking about replenishing the earth with sons of god those who would be in the very image and likeness of the first adam before the fall now it took the second adam to come along because the first album was was made earthly but the second adam was from heaven and the bible said the second adam was the very lord himself so god came down clothed himself in human flesh understand to restore us hallelujah see mankind will not uh they do not go to hell because of the sin they commit it's not because of murdering lying and thieving they go to hell because they refuse to accept the moment they refuse to accept the pardon hallelujah now think about it uh how god works uh god is always giving he gives when you're a sinner he gives when you're a saint he's the one that takes care of the whole thing and when it comes to restoring everybody likes that to be restored even as you grow older you wish you could be restored did i use that that you used to have amen we long for it we do all kinds of things wanting to be restored we take pills we use creams we do exercise we do everything but none of that works there's only one place or one way to be restored and that's by god no man can add a cubic or statute to himself even though we like to be mightier or greater uh it takes god he's the only one he's the creator he is the very life now when it comes to fellowship we understand according to the message but it wasn't so from the beginning brother branham said jesus he was crucified for our sins and raised for our justification then through his righteous blood we are cleansed that god could come into us and fellowship god making his own way back to fellowship with adam's children as he did with the adam before the fall now god made the way made his way back adam couldn't find his way he was lost think about what i'm saying here god took his time to make him make the way back for us right and we are redeemed from all the curse of the fall and now we have the earnest of our salvation i want you to really take take this at heart not just in your mind we are redeemed from all the curse of the thought now if we are redeemed from all of the curse of the fall that means every sickness every ailment whether it be spiritual or whether it be natural is a lie amen amen hello and at some place in our lives we're going to find out that even old age is a lie there was no such thing as aging before the fall and i believe right in that revelation a translation is going to take place hallelujah because we're not supposed to be old we're not supposed to be crippled we're not supposed to be afflicted we're not supposed to have any of these things that were caused by sin hallelujah but the trouble is that we always have a tendency to lean to our own understanding that's the affliction of the fall your reasoning your thinking to make you the devil make you think you have a right to think when it comes to the word of god but when it comes to the word of god you have no thought coming amen the prophet god said it like this i trust that the church will understand this that we have no right to use our own thinking about things i'm going to read that one again i trust that the church will understand this that we have no right to use our own thinking about things when we become christians we totally surrender every bit of our mental power to god and follow after his leading amen as long as we try to go after our own feelings then we are using the fallen state of the being [Applause] amen hello think about it i told you just a week or so ago it was when when the devil made eve think she had a thought her reasoning right that ability of her will and she chose her will over god's will that's what your thinking does it causes you to take your will over god's will seek god because listen he said and as long as we try to go after our own feelings then we are using the fallen state of the being because god led adam before the fall and after the fall adam wanted to lead god that's why the bible says the children of god are those that are led by the spirit amen hallelujah not leading the spirit but led by the spirit now god provided adam away but he didn't want that way he wanted to make himself a religion and as we see that he wanted to do it himself he wasn't willing to wait on god and say lord you led me before this and now i'm fallen i'm lost now help me and show me how to get back to you lord he said we we or we would not have we wouldn't have never had all this trouble we've got today think about it all adam had to do was repent it would have changed the whole scene but he didn't because at that point in his life his will was in control and if a man would just come that close to god that when you're lost don't try to find your way back just surrender to him and he will lead you back don't try to figure it out that's the mental powers and that's what we do we try to figure it out and that's the mental how i'm gonna do this one plus one is two no no no no let go and let god hallelujah amen think about it people we're doing the same thing as a as a bird would do trying to mathematically or scientifically uh uh uh figure out how he fly you know all i know is that they enjoy it and one thing i love about the eagle the eagle learns how to take advantage of the nature hallelujah you don't hear you don't see an eagle flapping his wing till he just said i can't go any further no he learns how to catch the wind and that wind represents god he learns how to move into the spirit of god and let the spirit of god takes him as high as he can go and that's what we must learn how to do learn remember i told you this morning you got to learn how the law works in a christian and brother branham said it like this let go and let god amen hallelujah now we understand by god's grace amen that when the man fell he fell and he fell into his own system and as we described it some time ago he he fell into his own system of multiplying and this is why we had such overflow of people on the earth god wanted them to multiply but he never intended for the multiplying to be a problem but you got to understand even in science they said a man needs so much space in order to be in be sane and if you put him in such a close uh proximity amen is he's liable to lose his mind if it lasts too long for so long and y'all know how it is we with this covet we thought if we stay in the house another day or if we be confined to this math and mask another day sometimes i almost had anxiety attacks in those in those department stores just trying to breathe you see we we're not creatures like that we're not supposed to be that way we we we've been set free one of the things about the cowboy movies i used to love is when those horses when they were you know running and galloping you know you know in in in their herds and and just carefree and you know the the what they call the hair the mange you know just blowing in the wind and many times i could see myself carrying on like that now i'm a dreamer so that's okay so anyway you you see that's the kind of freedom i don't believe when we get to heaven amen we're going to see any restriction signs you know don't enter here don't you no no no we'll have such a mind where mine will be so connected with him he will know he won't have to say anything he will hear us according to isaiah the bible said here hear us before we even speak amen hallelujah you know what that means that's amazing to me that he can hear me before i speak now he's always been able to do that but there are going to be such a connection that when we need some how many times that happened to you even now you need it you never asked for it and you got it but he he caught your thought he knew your thought from afar off and you said you know how did you know how did this happen he heard you when you thought it and he blessed you with it and if that be the case what about when you ask him for it amen the church was in the first age already a fallen woman now we're talking about restoring and you understand that ah e typed out the church she had fallen right she was seduced and adam willfully sinned and what happened there amen we find out by god's grace god took a lamb slew the lamb amen as an atonement for them now we know that each jehovah had a bride jesus had a bride and brother branham tells us like before jesus can get to his own church his bride that the serpent the devil had already entered in and paul even says in corinthians he says you know uh you know it it it it behooves me you know i'm i'm afraid that even as the serpent beguiled eve you soon to be beguiled you know in other words he saw a spirit that was not of god a spirit that acted like christ but was not christ he called it the antichrist spirit because it was to take the church away from the word and bring them into a system and paul said amen that even before jesus could get to her she was already into a system and as satan had begotten eve before adam even now has satan seduced the church the bride of christ before the marriage supper of the lamb and what specifically was in her midst that caused the fall what but revelation 2 6 the deeds of the nicolaitans in other words another man's voice right because that's what happened in the garden of eden eve took on another man's voice instead of listening to her husband voice who which was adam who spoke the word of god she listened to the serpent and the serpent was an upright creature like a man right we know these things amen already see the deeds of the nicolaitans already that first age had turned from following the pure word of god they turned from god demand of a church absolutely dependent upon him depending entirely upon god to fulfill his word from from start to finish apart from human government you say what weather's had happened before yes the same thing happened to israel when they had samuel they were a real ephesian church they had a prophet amen and the word of god came and samuel never asked him for anything i mean he it was just amazing he just delivered the word of god they were free but what did they do they saw the neighboring churches they saw and looked around them and said we want a king and listen samuel took it personally and god said don't take it personally samuel they did not reject you they rejected me now let them know now when they get this nicolaitan when they get this king i want you to know amen what he's going to do he's going to use this their sons and their daughters and he's going to put them in slavery right he's going to give them a hard time guess what the people say okay but we still want a king now that's crazy to me right i mean but that's exactly where the church ages went to paul said beware of these people beware of the false brethren paul said you will allow them to slap you and still serve them paul says listen i'm trying to tell you that this thing that comes in the name of jesus christ is not christ it's come to deceive you now we didn't know throughout the church ages until the seals were open until the first seal came and we thought we saw this white horse that throughout the ages historians thought it was jesus and then we come to find out it was not it was the antichrist spirit posing as the word of god and listen it deceived the people and throughout the ages as it continued to deceive the people it changed horses hallelujah or the color of the horse same horse but a different ministry hallelujah and that horse at the end became a a horse that was a mixed horse and it had on it death see the breaking of the word is going to always lead to death and understand amen when it comes in it comes like like like that paul and the rest of this apostle says it comes in like an angel of light like a great revelation hallelujah but if you don't stay with the word of god amen you'll never be restored hallelujah it always comes in with a system touch not taste not hand a lot see what i'm saying but a true seed of god when they're born again is the holy spirit that leads them and guide them into all truth hallelujah there were certain things no man had to teach me the holy spirit taught me don't get me wrong god has teach us but he's the teacher of the teacher he will tell you he is the amen how many times you've heard preacher come in here and preach the word of god you know it's true and you never heard it before but something comes out and says amen why it's because god knows his word and he's going to always amen his word and so he puts the amen like i said the amen put the amen in you so you can amen all right so we're at this place and and here brother branham uses a message a scripture coming out of jesus 20 one through seven and i'm going to read it and abraham journey from this toward the south country and dwelt between kadesh sher and sergeant and gyro and abraham said of to sarah's wife she is my sister an abimelech king of gareth sent and took sarah what was happening here first of all abraham had no beingness being where he was he was he was going on in a place where god said don't go he went anyway yes no does it sound familiar abraham used his own will his own will got him in trouble and he goes to this egyptian king right abimelech sees now watch this now because this is after a transformation abraham and sarah is no longer abram or sarai they have been physically changed to a young man and a young woman and they go down there and this king looking through the window seeing this man riding with this beautiful woman she had to be beautiful because this king had already a heron and evidently she outshined whatever he had and he says oh my i gotta have her right not knowing abraham weak in his flesh you know he had to know he wasn't supposed to tell his wife what he told her tell her tell the king you're my sister cause if you don't he's gonna kill me and he's gonna marry you i still want to talk to abraham when i get there i want i don't want to talk to him what was in your mind you did that i know you was afraid but come on bro i shouldn't have said it like that but come on brother hey i still that still gets me it still gets me but nevertheless let's go on by the grace of god god intervened don't you understand when satan is there to take you out spiritually see the devil has boundaries he can't cross up he can't cross you up is that right and brother said once you come into christ and that seed germ comes and it's quickened he said god closes the womb he seals it up no other man can enter in no other doctrine nothing that can defile the wound or the other or the pregnation that you have nothing can stop it god will intervene and god told abimelech like listen here by way of dream that that's my servant he's a prophet and that's his wife don't you touch her you better return and abimelech says lord you know i'm a righteous man god said yes i know you are a righteous man that's why i came to help save you and if you want this thing to follow through not only i want you to give abraham his wife back but i want you to give him so many so many of this and so much of this and so much i want you to pay him for lying to you because that's what abraham did abraham lied to him i want to pray you know i still don't get i don't you know but you got to understand abraham had an unconditional covenant in the eyes of god abraham was still pure you know what i'm saying he did god didn't see his faults but he covered them he covered them hallelujah and abraham left gorilla far more a rich man far richer than he was when he first entered in don't you see that that every true trial makes you richer amen and closer to god than you were before you started hallelujah and guess what the god will even make the devil bless you amen amen hallelujah yes hallelujah and so you say what do you mean he uses the same passage of scripture in restoration of the bride tree telling us that god is going to restore you even though you have come into a position of egypt where it it it appears that you're not abraham's wife but nothing can change that you are the bride of jesus christ and though we walk in this egyptian territory god has already set a law amen y'all understand me touch not amen do not write do my prophets no harm touch not my anointed y'all understand me that's not just for a preacher or a prophet that for every saint of god that's been blood washed and united with christ huh the mystery of this whole thing and this is what has been heard from the first from the beginning of the year of the ages the mystery that was hidden from not only the jews but hidden from the gentiles the gentiles always looked like dogs they were called dogs right remember the time when that woman says lord you know have mercy on me and you know he he wouldn't even he not lord but he said thou son of david she said it first have mercy but she was a gentile amen she would he she would he was not a a son of david to her so you got to understand in order to give get god's attention your protocol must be correct hallelujah right he's not the son of david to us he's lord hallelujah and so when when it comes to him responding he couldn't respond until she said lord and then jesus turned and said but it's not neat for me to give the children's bread to dogs and guess what see when you want god and you want him as bad like you know what you don't care if he tells you to go dip down into a hog pin pray there put your nose in the mud right you want him that's all that matters you want him she wanted him she she needed a blessing and when she called he called her dog she says she humbled herself she didn't puff up you know what i mean oh lord and here in america you deal with an american woman whoo you betting that dog she'll tell you a thing or two right but she humbled herself and said lord even the dogs desired a crumb from the master table now you know that had to move him that had to move him right oh that had to move him because that's what i say lord even the dogs deserve listen if i can't get a loaf of bread give me the crumbs i eat the crumbs hallelujah because the crumbs just as powerful as the loaf hallelujah so what god did the mystery of this whole thing was that he set us in predestination a lot of churches today don't believe in predestination but predestination and election is my thing it's my heartbeat it's the very ink of my soul amen because i realize i can't do it and if if i'm not predestinated i'm wasting my time if i'm not chosen and elected i'm wasting my time but the bible said he called me that's how i know he called me to this message he called you to this message he chose you look at the millions or the thousands of people that would we rejected this thing but somehow you connected with it hallelujah predestinated there's the mystery he before christ or anything else was ever on earth you see his great mystery that he chose the bride knowing eve would fall from disbelieving the word knowing that she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall that would would hold to that word regardless of what all the rest of the world had to say about it they were hold to the word they are predestinated to stand there the adoption of children by jesus christ predestinated the church to that great glorious stand y'all understand me and others you can't even stand like that unless he's predestinated you to stand that's why you can't do things that everybody else does that's why you even though you falter you fall you come short but in your heart you believe it with all your heart that's that's the stand people that's that's something that god put in you amen that it determines who you are no turning back because you can't turn back there is no way out of it just pull me on lord yes sir now you see his secret what to do to restore from fallen eve as she was pre figured of the church and notice now as god opened up the side of adam ooh i love this part because you know i love this part as god opened up the side of adam and took out eve by his own flesh and blood and divided his spirit from masculine to feminine to feminine and then put it in eve took the real from under his side and made eve out of it so god did the same thing taking out of the side of christ blood and water and christ is the word and taking the word and making up his church eve see back to himself again redeemed by the blood that was to come from his body you see it now see see this is god's great mystery now being unfolded that been hid since the foundation of the world but prefigured it all the way down that's why i brought out this morning at the end of the message the two trees which was the one tree right because when we think about the tree of life we just think about one tree but the tree of life in order to multiply had to have a feminine hallelujah and adam and eve represented the feminine the masculine the feminine hallelujah they were the reflection of the tree of life before they fell y'all understand me right it was after the fall eve became the tree of death because the bible says you know if a man amen that's conceived of a woman this is just a few days few days hallelujah but you see now our birth don't it doesn't come by a woman anymore amen hallelujah when you're born again you're born again of jesus christ amen hallelujah it's a man that brings life because that's where the bloodline is hallelujah so i'm talking about enforcing so you got to understand everything is under law all nature is under law and god has a law of enforcement within every gene with every that little life that you can't see under the microscope there is a law you know we're trying to you know scientifically get into that and nanos and nano technology and all that these little little computers on the inside of your blood but god had that long time ago and you see what it is amen in there you know whenever you get sick that little computer kicks out the sickness go to battle for you right so you got to understand amen god already had that but in the natural show you got so let me better explain myself i'm excited i'm trying to not be so long but here it was god even in his nature took that sun the s-u-n and made that sun lord over the earth in the natural that sun regulates everything and the moon which is the bride or the wife of the sun regulates the night and the sun represents jesus christ regulates the whole thing amen right you know it's amazing because that sun no matter how the earth disappear and the earth represents you know the church and it's amazing how those two work together but anyway let's move on it's just the world excuse me and then the earth represents the world and when that when that earth moves out of the way of the sun it gets cold season changes everything dies right but there's a law no matter how messed it up messed up the winner brings it no you know what i mean you know i mean you look at some of those trees during the wintertime you think they could never live again they look pitiful they're naked kind of like the church in the wintertime naked you know but at the same time when that sun start approaching it doesn't matter where that life in that germ is it makes it happen y'all heard me preach this i think before one time i was walking and here was a blade of grass coming through a cement block and i thought to myself that's amazing that the power of the sun penetrated that cement or well however it did it and made the life of that little weed or whatever it was come out now if god was mindful of a little weed what about the wheat hallelujah no grave can hold my body down you understand me if i die if they burn me if they cremate me it doesn't matter if they scatter my my my ashes to the dust when god said come hither i don't care where if part of me is in japan pod might be in russia i don't care where it is you say why do you say it like that because god will take the very same elements he made you with and bring you back together because that is what a resurrection is the same stuff coming up again hallelujah you understand me so this message is a restoration message we thought pentecostal was restoring us but this message is restoring us to the very prince of the very power and amen from which we fail and god is enforcing it amen hallelujah you know we could get lazy on the job and god said but don't you worry satan think he's got us because he's got he's got this dollar towards this lazy spirit on us you know but you don't worry you know israel had the same same thing happening with them and then just before the exodus like i said this morning god had to put the pressure oh you don't have to worry about praying god's gonna make you pray he gonna put cause he knows even david had to go through trials and tests and you know david was a prayer warrior and when he fell and kept falling at times and things listen he says i look toward the hill from which cometh my help my help coming from the lord david knew how to turn toward the lord when he saw that he could not help himself and let me tell you something that's exactly what god will bring you amen if you think that you the control of your life god says that's human thinking you can't control none i'm the controller and all you and i must learn how to do is let go and let god and what we do instead of doing how you know brothers how do you know when you when you're not when you're you you're in your human element when you worry says satan has robbed you of the privilege of being a son or daughter of god we have a right this morning by the holy spirit to enforce the claim of god bring them back whether it be your children whether it be your loved one whether it be your daddy whether you be your father whoever whether it be you we have the right we have the authority amen to speak it and talk like we know what we're talking about amen you'll never hear policeman says would you please stop that's not the language of a policeman he says it with authority stop and you better stop consequences if you will come upon you if you do not right see he said if you if he's afflicted you and made you sick we have a right before god to enforce the laws of god by his stripes we are healed amen bring him back turn him loose you're taking him out yonder of death and we claim him bring him back now that's the enforcement restore it back to his natural condition again a man is sick baby is sick woman is sick see they're out of their natural condition then we have a right to enforce our claim what are you saying anytime we can see and recognize someone being out of their natural condition we have a right to enforce it we as children of god but you got to believe it you can't go up there and hope that god will heal them i was telling the brother the other day i said you know just like a lot of people they say it took us five hours to cast that demon out you ain't never seen jesus take five hours and another brother branham never took five hours that's the pentecostal i don't mean no harm they've seen too many movies that's hollywood speak the word because brother said when you repeat yourself like that he said it diminishes and decreases your faith when you see it that devil knows it too he'll let you holler there holler at the whole time by the time the end of the day you've got you've dropped from faith to hope that he doesn't move by hope only by faith right jesus told that man amen who had the episode episode epileptic come out and the devil threw that boy all over the place and jesus said oh my goodness he's getting worse no he stood there and waited now you you're done with your drama get out because the devil he just loved drama he loved drama just stay and wait he's got to go the word has been spoken yeah they're out of their natural condition then we have a right to enforce our claims not our claims it's our claim because god gives it to us it's like if you got somebody in your house and you don't want them in there get out they said no i'm not going oh you going if i've got to call the police you going if i've got to call the enforcer you're getting out of my house y'all understand me so it is with the spiritual if you know he want to move the devil call on the enforcer it's the holy spirit it's god he's there for you asks whatsoever you will and it shall be given that's the word not all claims is our claims because god gave it to us by his stripes we were healed he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed now we have a right to enforce the law the lawgiver the holy spirit himself is here the agent of god to see that is done that way you believe in the holy ghost the holy ghost is is more than a feeling it's more than a shout or dance or singing it's god hallelujah is that all right you and i must learn amen how to cope with the word now i'm going to have to hurry up because we we uh uh want to understand what this enforcer is he said now he was and i'm going to stop here and then we're going to uh the communion service because i want you to understand by god's grace i know i'm cutting this short but i have to because you know i want us to understand that when we talk about enforcing we're not talking about our natural muscles we're talking about letting go and let god um i mean you know when when queen esther couldn't do it herself she went to the king she had authority but she knew that haman was a little bit more than she could handle and she needed the king's help you understand me and so when you see things that are really difficult for you amen and you can't sing you got to go to god in prayer if the people could understood where prayer takes you right amen brother i said when you travail it means that you travel yes sir and when you travel somehow you see that thing you asking for become visible to you you get up and say praise god he answered prayer it's a revelation and you can't explain it but that's the kind of way it happens when you when you all of a sudden something happens and you your prayers seem to be over that means god just answered you ever been there you just praying praying praying all of a sudden boom yeah the weight of it is gone everything is gone why because god just answers your prayer then you get up and says hallelujah thank you you know you don't get up like i wonder did he answer no he just answered amen know how he works he has spoken a word and put a law with the word and and the law is his own law his own life behind it that's the reason he swore by himself there's none uh greater you know uh and i hope uh you know we we look at things and we say lord one thing about um i hope she don't mind me using i won't go into detail but sister chapels always amazes me and and one of the things i i love about her is her disposition you know and but one thing she had will always stick in my heart when she was going through the troubles with her daughter and it was the love of god that wouldn't let her release you know sometimes we want to give up but she was a prayer warrior i mean you could see that the fervency that she had and and look at it now look what god has done you know we've seen it work you know married and got a good husband and you know amen and uh you know and just like that i don't know exactly when but i believe sister god gonna give her a harsh desire i believe that with all my heart i do and i'm believing with you on that i'm looking forward to seeing glory to god it's perseverance it's literally taking god and his wife says lord you promised not that you're being disrespectful he loves it when you take his word and says lord but you said he loves it he loves it and by his own death burial and resurrection he proved his law was right you understand me he was dead and the bible said that he that god would not let his body see corruption and it didn't and he rose on the third day not an old man a new man hallelujah restored back to his youthful state wherein that only his disciples could not believe they did not recognize him because he died an old man looking looking like an old man over over what 70 years old 50 whatever it is they said you know when he was talking about abraham i was before abraham and they said but you're not a man what 50 what happened how many years it was but anyway they saw him as an old man but when he rose again they didn't recognize how on earth did they come to know who he was by the nail prince hallelujah i mean even tom says i wouldn't believe it i ain't gonna believe it unless i can thrust my hand into his hands and into his side jesus said look at me thomas comes at all my lord and my god but blessed are you blessed is the man who've never seen yet believe oh my brother jim is feeling pretty good up here amen and by his own death burial and resurrection he proved his law was right see you destroyed this body i'll raise it up again in three days i personally pronoun i'll raise it up again in three days i'll bring it up just destroy it and see what happens for he knew the law of god he knew what it was he knew it had to work according to the word he know that the word of god had been spoken through a prophet and said i'll not suffer my holy one to see corruption that settled him that settled it then the law of god has got to work by the word we're coming down to a great thing in a minute see where the law of god word the law of god is his word see so i'm gonna leave it right there if the word says so that's exactly what it means you don't have to argue with it you don't have the reason you take god at his word and says lord this is your word and i'm standing on it he'll make the impossible possible let's stand there are some things i may not know there are some places that i cannot go but there's one thing oh then i'm sure of my god is real for i can feel hear me my soul some folks may doubt oh some thoughts may scorn all can deserve and leave me alone [Music] but as for me yes sir i'm gonna take god's part my god is real oh i can't see him in my heart don't you know god is real he's real in my soul my god is real oh he had watched and made me whole oh his love for me yes sir it's just like to go my god is real for i can feel him in my soul amen god is real well we're going to change the order of the service into our communion service going to ask our brother as they come and give us a song as we prepare amen we ask him also to assist us in the communion service as well we appreciate each and every one of you coming out god is so real think about it people think about it we don't have much time left i know we've been saying it for years i thought years ago 1977 when i saw my first uh ufos didn't know what they were but i did tie them into the rapture for some strange reason i wasn't even in the message but i remember screaming and jumping on the side of the road lord whatever you do don't let let me miss the rapture and then it was in the early 80s god brought this message to me and answered my prayer but uh you know so i know that people are saying well the lord is delaying is coming they're way behind if they only knew that he's come in such a special way but a secret way and now he's transforming us bringing us together and i was thinking as i read the scriptures about how you know the dead in christ should rise first i'm like wonder what's going on in that dimension i can see what's going on in here but wonder what's going on in that dimension right guess what brother i'm saying he's gathering them he's gathering them together just like he's gathering us together something's going on amen yes sir something's going on and i believe they're having a hallelujah time amen by god's grace with you come brother i was wondering were you you okay you're resting i love you bro [Music] so [Music] foreign [Music] love you [Music] i [Music] i sing out a song i sing out of song to jesus [Music] i lift up [Music] love you [Music] love you lord love you [Music] me i sing out a song i sing out a love song to jesus [Music] love you [Music] singing [Music] amen as we stand we're going to read from the first corinthians we'll start at the 23rd verse read on down [Music] paul is writing to the corinthians church and he says for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this dude in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sup saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do e as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's deathly comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinking damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body but this caused many of us are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we would not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation and the rest will i set an order when i come for those who are participating you may come up front [Music] do let's pray father we thank you for the breaking of the bread we realize this is a symbolic lord of your body we pray father god as each one of us for taking this lord we are declaring that we are part of the bread that has been broken part of your body lord baptized in your precious name and filled with your holy ghost thank you father god bless these participants if there is healing needed we pray that they heal the bodies if they're strengthened they need strength in their spirit we pray that you do that whatever we come short of we pray that you would bless us lord in jesus christ's name we pray amen [Music] when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you there's two remembers of me let us eat [Music] do [Music] even though we take this communion none of us are worthy in ourselves to partake of the body of christ it is his grace and his mercy but is it at this time that god gives us the time to look into ourselves and if there be any shortcomings any faults or anything of that nature which i know as being human you will have but it gives us that time to confess and to ask for his forgiveness and to cleanse us because we know our unworthiness is is what it is and we became worthy only because of him and we are accepted in the beloved because of him so we thank him for that and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this as often as you drink it in remembrance [Music] [Music] so [Music] do [Music] knew it every morning so god is good to us amen we appreciate everybody [Music] we thank god for that amen we're now going to have uh feet washing and the brothers are here and the sisters in the front [Music] and then we'll be right back [Music] i tried [Music]
