hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] do you want it [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] i got it [Music] amen hallelujah we praise the lord for his grace and his mercy i trust that everybody was able to sing that song whether you got it you can get it if you got it you can have it you know how it works i think most people people in the message a lot of them are afraid of the upbeat song they'd rather s getting ready to die and uh they were saying and he asked the people who's dying you and me we appreciate everything that's been said and done here this morning glad to have everybody here today this morning amen uh let us turn by god's grace to the scripture i don't know where they announced it or not but uh uh our brother um lukuka was telling us that uh this paul was telling us that his mom's brother passed away and so they're gonna be headed down to iowa city this evening and let's remember her in prayer okay this is no matter how safe and sanctified we are we're coming from survey self death always affects us but let us pray for her that god will give her a strength in this time of bereavement first corinthians please we're going to come from the 15th chapter of first corinthians we're going to read the 53rd verse of that particular chapter mercy and from there we'll go to first peta the first chapter 23 through 25. first corinthians 15. uncle intentional for this corruptable was put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality we'll read that again for this corruptable must put on incorruption um we'll begin we'll read the 23rd to the 25th being born again not of corruptible seed but incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever. for all flesh is as grass and all the glory of man as the flower of grass the grass withereth and the flower thereof fadeth away from the floorboard [Music] and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you let us pray father god we come before you as humbly as we know we thank you for your goodness [Music] in jesus christ's name we pray amen i told you on wednesday that we would be uh trying to minister the second portion of the message we started out with the subject born from within this with the theme the anchor that god has done a wonderful thing with us his perfect his plan is so perfect and he has given us it's not that we're holding on to him but he is holding on to us we show by the grace of god that our natural birth represents death but the spiritual birth represents life this is why god told nicodemus you must be [Music] where god [Music] [Music] i'm not sure if everybody here this morning realize that after the bride is taken there is no more redemption for the gentiles and we must understand that we are here to do something not by chances [Music] that something can be the word that you can't defeat satan in this hour with luther's message alone i'm beginning to feel good now when it comes to wesley's message even though wesley was a man of god and his message was a true message from god we cannot preach wesley's message because that is a message now wesley's message today then we had the pentecostals come along with the power of the holy ghost i'm gonna say that again we had the pentecostals to come along with the power of the holy ghost hallelujah but you cannot defeat hallelujah the devil in this day with the pentecostal message alone what i'm saying because they're that message was just the beginning of something hallelujah and in that day it worked for them and we know that it did it because many great men came out of that air but now god has moved into another [Music] [Music] and he says that the light the sunlight like rides the fruit at the top of the tree i believe this is why brother branham told us that we ought to lay in the presence of the sun hallelujah we've been talking about the elevation of the mind [Music] you were born hallelujah no one likes to be a loser hallelujah but there is hope i'll say it again there is hope [Applause] amen the multiplication of god's seed it's almost over you understand me it's almost over the table is almost complete hallelujah and the prophet god says there will not be one extra in hallelujah not one extra [Music] and it will not be one person shorts [Music] of the total in which god has already ordained you hallelujah because he said i will not lose watch and i stress you are the purpose if god be with us are the signs and the wonders who saw these scenes where are the miracles hallelujah don't you get uh a little uh uh curious as to see what god did through malachi 4. hallelujah and we are the fruit of malaca hallelujah and the fruit and the tree are the same [Music] somebody help me here so that we'll understand i don't know that the problem of god could was truly an example it is an example god waved him among the people hallelujah it was not the man but it was god in the man hallelujah is that right you see we thought for years jesus did it all hallelujah but jesus declared i can do nothing here comes another son of god and his name was william who said he could not do anything except he see god move i'm wanting the voice hallelujah coming from the same tree coming from the same roots the bride of jesus christ will keep still but we'll see until she hear of thus said the lord till she sees the spirit move he's like a wheel in a wheel he's like a wheel in a wheel hallelujah we move when the wheel moves but you see if you've got a question like that if something is burning in your heart to see a move of god that gideon was burning then you in the right place at the right time hallelujah because we're not entering into just a pentecostal anointing but we are entering into the age of adoption hallelujah where the sons and daughters of god we'll do exactly the same exact moment as jesus did come same words members same power same authority everything will be the same remember hallelujah why is it why is it because they're born not on this world but of another world hallelujah and we're now in sitting in heavenly places christ jesus conquista now god said unto gideon basically i see what you're going through because at least you believe that the miracles can be once so what is he saying to you you're the one who's that who really believed the word of the things that brother brown who said would take place we call those things that be not as though they were alexis hallelujah the bible says that we are now sitting in heavenly places jesus on jesus hallelujah about [Music] [Music] those automobiles hallelujah but it was the uniform they gave him authority what i'm saying you don't have no power but god has given you authority after which the holy ghost has come upon you you shall receive power hallelujah salsa amen and brother branham said it like this hallelujah [Music] and the mighty angel revelation 10 came down hallelujah i wasn't there maybe you weren't there but how was that hallelujah where were you brother bro with the truth i was in him hallelujah come on somebody i i'm just beginning to see who i am where i came from and where i'm going [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] not some kind of mansion is it like we see god wants to work [Music] maybe you look like a loser this morning satan is just kicking you around saturn that's okay may see correct because god is on your side hallelujah and when god is on your side you may be the lowest person ever in the place [Music] if you're tired of the devil just doing you any kind of way you need to stand on the law's side he just wanted to see something he wanted the god of the past to be the god of today don't you see what i'm saying let's go forward we've seen what god has done through william branham and god has chosen you his precious fruit he calls you his name hallelujah oh somebody help me so you can understand i love the vic it is the devil who's lying to you hallelujah not one of us not one of us can make ourselves worthy this is why we needed jesus christ is that right i don't know about you but i need him not just just sometimes i need him all the time i said more performance hallelujah every minute of the day i need jesus christ hallelujah you see there's no power in the in your crosses that you wear all the little trinkets that the world has given to us there's no power in there all those little things that we use as representations are repre that represents christ there is no power in it hallelujah you can have pictures all over the wall there is no power hallelujah there are many people yeah who wore necklaces with other crosstalk [Applause] and god alone and we don't want the power around us we don't even want the power with us we want the power in us because he said in [Music] anybody here with me this morning i don't know about you but is the inside of me i am a warrior [Music] i can fail you every day but god [Music] [Music] is that right hallelujah greater in what way more of what jesus did he wants to do it through you blues could come just we have the people so you ex i'm explaining this you see you heard me say it many times very purpose of adam and i read that quote last week was to multiply objectives [Music] or more other children of the bonds woman the true believer will not be a greater great number one you see if you're caught without fruit see you will be cut down jesus came across a fig tree jesus supposed to bring forth fruit there was nothing on the tree and he cursed the tree is that all right remember the rich young rule jesus invited him to the ministry but he was so concerned about his worldly goods he couldn't give it up hallelujah but let me tell you something every time you've turned jesus down will face you it's going to face you it's going to come around again [Music] when he was hallelujah because let me say it like this when you die there's nothing you can take with you outside of your character song hallelujah you will you will you will who recall every time he knocked on the heart's door and you refuse to answer is that all right i just want you to understand by god's grace uh shaped in the mother's womb hallelujah not there to stay hallelujah just like we're being shaped in the womb of the earth but we're not here to stay don't listen to this [Music] that they're living in that god is getting ready to change your people let me say this to each and every one of you this morning as an individual listen to your individual motion hallelujah don't be foolish don't look at somebody else you're not here to judge others amen amen that's what paul said you need to judge yourself you be in the faith hallelujah we spend too much time judging somebody else hallelujah and when we do that he lost the physical he shows you naughty in the veins hallelujah we'll become a pharisee looking at somebody else when you got a beam in your own eye you know hallelujah think about hallelujah have you known anyone in your lifetime that's living still somehow somewhere every one of us have experienced death in our families among our loved ones associates we know we're born to die that's what the bible says we're born to die that amen so and the bible says that person who is born of god sin is not the best part hallelujah y'all you could never disbelieve the word i don't care if you it disagrees with your your thoughts the word is right hallelujah you've got a battle going on in you mostly everybody have a battle going on in you paul told us about it paul told us about it two natures that you've got to deal with hallelujah but but but understand only one can win vancouver hallelujah you got a jacob and eesof hallelujah battling right now for the birthright hallelujah but that in that birthright there was one that was ordained there was one who was elected there was one who was [Music] [Music] the father has given unto us hallelujah as we said last week amen um jacob had to wrestle jacob with god and the bible said he overcame but let me read this quote coming from jehovah christ that tree that was in the garden of eden there were two trees in the garden of eden these two trees were set there for a birth purpose it says when eve ever she was the tree of death christ was the tree of life only jesus christ can save you so jesus christ the church represents a woman hallelujah but jesus christ is the word only the word can save you hallelujah now the bible tells us that the word was manifested hallelujah and the word is one and that's why it was so made manifest manifesting in jesus christ so perfectly hallelujah that's the reason why god manifested himself so perfectly manifest because he was the seed word [Music] hallelujah there's only one life in a concern you know how can i say it are not aren't you tired aren't you tired of being just church people that promote [Music] you're going to be as weak as your god god took the prophet of god to a place that i think a lot of people are missing we see it we hear it and let's go just for a moment to the things in which god allowed him to do this hallelujah now we know that the revival of the 50s say heal figures osborne osborne we're all inspired by his ministry hallelujah and those men did great works for the kingdom of god hallelujah but they were so inceed don't don't do they were sowing seeds is it they don't don't the seed that was sown into their hearts he manifest was also what i'm going to do hallelujah and this sea was never to be a denomination this is the most even this is something that you're going to be able to be an organization most of the differences was supposed to remain free hallelujah is that right was to have the ability most of us hear the word of god this seed was to have the ability capacity to do the works of god the the family hallelujah y'all understand what i'm saying this seed it's a monster what's to manifest the very life of god dwarf manifested and if they are manifesting is it manifest what was in their seed we should be manifesting manifestations what was in our seed [Music] what you manifest sucrose manifesting is it tells us what seed was planted [Music] huh i hope we don't have nobody in here that goes down there and kneel down and pray before it's all right they have it but there's no power [Music] one provided and the bride of jesus christ knows where he's at hallelujah that one provided place discern is under the shed blood of jesus christ hallelujah i'm not talking about denominations call the shed blood i'm talking about the revealed words the bloody bleeding word of this hour the bible says make the tree good or make it evil god didn't accept the tree of knowledge of good and evil and he's not accepting it now matthew 12 23 you don't have to turn there it says either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruits he's not just talking about either being patient being long suffering being kind i didn't know what he's talking about he's not talking about bringing fruit the word it's more than wearing long dresses it's more than not cutting your hair don't grow up it's more than just shaving your face or whatever you do that is is to have the ability of the spoken word like [Music] [Music] but he wants to see it on display y'all hear what i'm saying it's more than just quoting william brandon it's more than just quoting paul it is a life that shows who you are is that right and he said the bride and the bridegroom [Music] it wasn't because no i'm gonna come out i've preached longer than i intended to oh but let me let me give you this one thought and i know a lot of people won't be here this evening probably but i do want to say this you see the tree the bride tree she must be compatible god you will never plant his seed in a beast you understand what i'm saying it has to be the one chosen y'all know what i'm saying now so you understand jesus christ was the male tree jesus christ and in order to produce you've got to have a female tree developer female is that right so even jesus showed us remember behind the veil dead rod that old dead rock was a female rod hallelujah because the males can't bring forth fruit that's good it's the female the freak that piece of wood that's what moses used that aaron used who and what it really was yeah [Music] and it's no longer what you do is it pleases what the life is doing through you hallelujah the stick didn't quicken itself look the stick did not quicken itself the rod did not quicken itself the baton is but it was the presence of the almighty god that's why the prophet of god stresses in the presence of the son hallelujah and that's get into the presence of the lord now pick up this evening by god's grace [Music] when you have come to that much truer state the maturity because god is going to give you a graduation program in this graduation situation is it situation it will not only be it won't be a private thing the angels will be invited and all heaven and earth will know and now we're going to have a full adoption ceremony and that from that point on yeah it's no longer what i say god says but whatsoever you say god have had a lot of church members right now he's working with the elected to make that seed grow so here you go and out of the ground may the lord the ninth verse god to grow genesis 2 9 to grow every tree that is pleasant to the site and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil dude now we know who that is and he changes it he sees something that the bible later later on tells us now understand you have never heard any preacher in all of christianity know anything about agriculture you know that even in in in the in the uh fruit and so you can remember the tree department don't you have a you have to have a male and a female um in order for it to dermatize focus it up with jeremy well look what david picks up oh we got this screw wow he he shows you he says and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water and bringing forth his fruit in season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper isn't that amazing he tells us that this tree is only one tree of life and that's jesus christ [Music] the sqv in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river it's really the boat was there the tree of life which bear twelve manners of fruit produced [Music] you say well what do you mean what are you saying and you know this is what i'm going to lose willing this evening though we've got communion for those who want to take communities i'm trying to get everybody you see out of this state of mind you said that where we could just go to the church go to work come back home go to church again and that's it it's more to your life than that you've been called for a purpose it's about god shaping you it's the very image and likeness of himself that is your ultimate goal i'm gonna say it again that's your ultimate goal when the pressure comes when the squeeze comes your knowledge of your mind won't do you any good well i know william brown because a lot of people that know him gonna gonna turn their backs to church that's not gonna do you you hear what i'm saying go listen to that message and see how the i can't tell you how many times he's done that it should be perfect in various messages before the final exit i vote for the final accident there is coming of persecution there is coming a squeeze hallelujah we will not be in the great tribulation but we will feel something something is coming people whatever it is you're gonna have to take a stand now if you can't see the union of this thing that's going on now acts yeah and uh but he said that samson samsung was the main attraction they're doing all of these acts they follow all of these laws they're unifying everything and the final attraction attractions i've been preaching about the system the system that we have allowed to form into this message when you know all the cliche you know all of the different quotes hallelujah and you think that puts you into the message because you're going through a message because your preacher claimed to be a message and if the dark forces of that hour i don't see the if the dark forces of that hour see the fossils y'all better hear what i'm saying we're dealing with power we're dealing with dark forces hallelujah now i know one thing same shows everybody has to battle every day some [Music] [Music] those three things are the things we must it was when peter was filled with the holy ghost then he was able has to be to to cause us to stand the test it's going to be mini that's true everybody that went to branham tabernacles no no and you can go to branham tabernacle right now and it won't make you brag that's a religious conception concept and when he came down in 1963 the pastor is a good pastor hallelujah but my true handshake is jesus christ alone you love the lord you see the bride can hear and she can see the hour she's living in the pools and she's making herself ready we all have distractions he if we're going to make this journey you've got to set your face like a flint keep your eyes on jesus hallelujah you love the lord amen amen let's pray i hope so they could prepare themselves lord we know we can we can't add a cubit to our
