bless the church amen we're so happy to be here the prince of the Lord and I will greet you all to the Lord for Lord Jesus Christ merry Christmas and happy familiar today this boy Lord you kept us safe in the Lord Jesus Christ Lord you give us all the blessings of what we just want to say Jesus Christ we reach up to four method chapter four of us Matthew chapter 4. that will say now when Jesus has buried their children was accustomed to prison and living Nazareth he came and dwelled in the premium which is upon the Sea Coast in the borders of several and Neptune that you might be fulfilled which was spoken by God uh foreign in my life and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and got divided the light from the darkness amen here in Genesis chapter 1 verse 3 first of all God had to speak the word let there be light amen and that word that God spoke in had that God spoke had to be manifested amen and then the thing that showed that that word was manifested was the result that that life brought amen when the light came when the Lord when the light was there that light was the Vindication of that spoken word amen that light was there to prove it meant that God had just created the light was there it meant to prove that a word was spoken and here's the result amen so the light is the mind is the Vindication of the spoken word when God speaks amen that word has to be Vindicated amen and the only way to see it amen is one you see the result is that the prophet says that the word of God interpret in itself amen God is the only has the interpretation of his own word amen when he speaks the word amen when you see that word coming to pass amen that's when you know that this word amen is from God Amen it's like in the Old Testament when uh uh God told Moses amen he says that when people will come to we come at you and with prophecies and with visions amen you have to you have to listen to them but you have to wait till if those visions and those prophecies and those dreams comes to pass amen that means that we was from God but if it doesn't come to pass amen that means it wasn't from God and those people have to come and repent amen because the word of God when it's spoken amen that word will never come back void amen that word will come with the result the man it's like the Bible says that one God sends down the rain amen that rain comes down for a certain purpose amen that ruins will never that ring will never go back unless he has fulfilled amen the purpose for which it was sent amen the word of God the light of God the light is the Vindication of the spoken word when God say let there be light amen that light was there to manifest that to show to people amen that the word of God is true the prophet says that what is the light he said that all natural life comes by a spoken word and the son is the spoken word he said he created the great light in the heavens for the day and lesser life for the night see and all natural life has to come by God's spoken word a flower cannot grow without the light without the light of God's spoken word shine upon it for the son is the s-u-n is the spoken word of God when he said let there be light see it's God's spoken life and no matter how much people try to say this that or the other it Still Remains the Same you have to have that son amen so life natural can only come by the spoken word of God it's a paragraph 78 it says that in spiritual life eternal life can only come by God's spoken word but God Spoken Word of Life life was the son the s-o-n this time life is a son that's why this time in him is light in him is no darkness and he is God's spoken light is that right I mean he said that God's spoken word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and it's forever God see and it takes the light of God to strike the word to make it leave here is uh uh uh what he spoke amen he said and now let the light shine amen the light shine and the light will bring every word to his right position it in its season amen oh you see when you come when it comes when it comes time he said that the light will bring every word in its right position Amen in other words he says that uh uh uh the light amen is the source of life amen that's why you see that I was asking myself a question why was the creation of light among the first Creations that God created amen because light in light in the light there is life in the light it meant light brings life amen the sun brings life amen in order for you if you plant something if you sow something in order for that seed to come forth amen it has to be positioned to the right angle you know facing the sun amen that that that that that seed amen has to have a and that has to have a a a I can say he has to have a fellowship with the son amen if you if you saw something in a room in a dark room and you keep it there that's it will never grow amen the way that's it is supposed to grow amen that seed has to it has to come in the presence of the sun s-u-n Amen in order for it to grow even our own personal bodies amen we need the Sun and we need those nutrients we need those uh uh uh protein and and all the good things that the sun has in our bodies in order for us to Amen to keep on growing it may not for us to be strong and to have energy amen the prophet said that in the spiritual life is still the same thing amen God the Jesus Christ the s-o-n amen he is also the the light amen because we're rather Hearing in John it says that I am the light amen you have to believe in the light amen because he was he is the light amen and in him there is life and every seed of God every child of God Amen in order for them to grow amen they have to come in the presence of that son amen they have to meet the son with the have to have a personal relationship with that son it meant they have to come in contact amen without son in order for them to grow Amen in order for them to receive their life amen that the son the son amen have to has to have an impact in their lives amen now otherwise they will not grow otherwise they would be malnourished otherwise amen they would die otherwise I don't know what will happen to them but but in order for you to have a good health amen you have to come in presence of that son the the light amen and Jesus Christ is the light amen he is the Vindication of that spoken word that was spoken amen here's the Vindication of that word that God gave Moses that I will raise unto you a prophet like a prophet like you amen he is that that spoken word that was given to Isaiah that the Virgin will conceive amen Jesus Christ he is their light amen he is that spoken where is the Vindication amen of that spoken word is the Vindication of the entire Old Testament amen Jesus the son of God is the life for every believers so you gotta be in this presence in order for you to grow in order for you to have life amen and you have to be positioned amen so that that lighting man come can he can hit you we meant to the right angle the prophet said that sometimes that grain lays in the earth dormant all through the winter like seed winter uh he said he said a a winter wheat sowed in the ground but when the sun gets just right it's got to leave see it can't be it can't live without the Sun and God has made promises for every age and every day and when the light gets right and shines upon that it will produce just exactly what this what the word said because he is the light and the life it may want the son amen when the light gets just I mean I mean it hits the right angle amen when that that light gets right amen and it shines upon you shines upon that seed of God that's inside of you amen he has to bring every word of God to pass amen he has to bring he has to bring him and your life will be fruitful amen your life will have result amen when you stay in the presence of the king when you stay in the presence of the son amen sometimes we have cloudy days and sometimes the clouds of Life comes and and it seems like the sun is not shining amen but the prophet says about if you look beyond the clouds in my design of the sun always shines I mean it doesn't matter it means how many how dark and thick the clouds are amen the sun will always shine amen the sun will always raise up in the morning amen and set in the in the evening amen the sun will always shine amen by you have to have the faith amen that will look amen through the clouds amen their faith that will look through the cloud amen when did life when your life gets dark it may know that the light of the god the light of God is always there for you amen when the life gets dark when when things seems like things are not going the way the way it's supposed to go in and when when when the clouds of Life image starts immense sickness and troubles at work at home and everywhere it may know that the Glides of God is always there God's face is always there amen God is always there you just have to have that face so strong it meant to look beyond the clouds amen you will see that light shining at you amen Delight of God came down on Earth and went through a virgin amen was born people made fun of that light and many people made fun of Jesus Amen but they didn't know that that light had a purpose they might notice that in that time amen people knew the word amen the prophet gave the example of Paul Paul knew the Exotic the entire word from Genesis chapter 1 to the last verse of the Bible amen all those Chief priests and men that could tell you exactly the word and where to find this chapter when to find this very verse when to find this and that amen they could tell you the entire Bible from beginning to the end amen but no matter how Intel intellect there were amen no matter how in my knowledgeable of the word that word but they were still living in darkness amen they were still living in darkness amen it's like in this time amen you see people quoting the prophet people know everything about the prophet people know everything about the message they know the Bible they can quote the Bible and everything but you see the still living they're not living in the light of God Amen because light amen it's not only the word amen light is the Vindication of that word amen if you read that I believe chapter one amen how John was talking to Amen to the church amen he was telling them that that you have to uh uh when you have the light of God you cannot hate your brother when you have the life of the Living spirit seven evil spirits and heal her from all the spirits amen that light of God went to that blind man wanted man and that blind man recovered it recovered his side him and he was able to see the light amen that light was was Christ himself walking down and people made fun of him people didn't want to believe that he was the light but yet they were still the light amen is still the same thing even today amen you have the word of God and you show people the truth but they still don't want to believe it amen they're living as the prophet says that they're living in the marriage of that light amen they're living in the in the in in the previous slide amen the light that has been passed amen if they're living in darkness even though they have the word even though that they still have the message amen but they don't believe in that message amen they don't want to believe the message of this present time and when Jesus is the light Jesus is the Fulfillment of of the word of God in Matthew 28 the Bible Matthew 28 uh amen is the light of Psalm chapter 16 verse 10 which says that for thou will not leave my soul in hell neither will thou suffer thy the Holy One to seek corruption amen Matthew 28 was the Fulfillment of that scripture amen when Jesus died and he was on the tomb amen the Bible says that God could not could never leave him he meant to seek corruption so he had to raise him up from the dead amen and the third day the Bible says that Jesus rose up from the dead amen you went to preach to the souls that was in prison the man he went to Amen to Abraham and to the center of old and opened the gates of paradise and let them all out amen all of them were resurrected amen doubt this scripture Matthew 28 was the light amen was the Vindication of that word that God gave to David amen that prophecy that he will never leave amen he's only he's only one to see corruption and then you have Acts chapter 28 I act chapter 38 amen is the Vindication of Joel chapter 2 verse 28. amen the Bible says that and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour my spirit I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old man shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days without poor uh will I pour out my spirit and I will show wonders in Heavens in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great day before the great and terrible day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass whatsoever you shall ask well whatsoever whosoever shall call on the Lord on the name of the Lord shall be delivered for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance and the Lord has saved in the remnant whom the Lord shall call amen he was that prophecy that it was that the Vindication was in Acts chapter 38 Acts chapter 2. amen where God poured out the spirit amen when the spirit of the Lord amen came into the man amen when the spirit of God him and started to leave inside of man amen people saw visions and and people get prophecies and people were speaking in tongues and just the atmosphere of the prince of God was there amen that was the prophecy that means that every promise is that God have made in the Bible amen those promises have to come to pass amen those promises amen they have to come to pass amen many of them amen almost all of them have come has come to pass already amen those promises have come there has to come to pass amen that's why amen when you're facing troubles when you're facing tribulations amen when you're facing hard times I mean you just have to take one of the promises amen and Lee known that amen because those promises will not go void amen but will not come back void that we have to have the result amen just lean on those prophecies amen and you will see the result just lean on that just have your faith in that amen and you will see God come in reaction amen because God didn't stop vindicating the word and the uh uh in 1896 amen when the last book of Revelation was written amen God did not stop vindicating his word then amen the promise God's word is still being Vindicated amen God is still proving that he's the same God Amen because as the prophet says that you will read the entire New Testament and you will see that the book of Acts is the only book of the New Testament that doesn't that is not finished with an amen amen you see every book of the eight in the Old Testament amid the New Testament as in amen at the End Amen you've seen it made Revelation finishes with an amen you see uh Jude and first John to three thirds that you know all of those books and man finishes within amen but the book of Acts amen is the only book of the New Testament that doesn't have any amen at the end why because that book is still that book has to be written amen that book has to be written amen written by and in every ages amen from amen from Ephesians amen from for me from from Faith to to to brotherly kindness amen that book has to be written amen that book has to be written by you that book has to be written by me it meant all the experiences that we have and God but all the experiences that we have with God Amen is the continuation of that book amen we have to walk that book because that book amen is the act of the holy spirit in the people amen it's what the holy spirit in the people make them believe women it's how the Holy Spirit made them walk amen it's how the Holy Spirit made them speak and it's how the holy spirit amen made them sing made them preaching man amen that's that's all that's what they wrote amen they wrote about the experiences that they had with God Amen it's that book amen has to be written again amen he has to keep on being a man you we have to keep written writing this book amen because God did not God didn't stop vindicating his word when the when he wrote when the the last book of the Bible was written amen God is the word of God is keep on the word of God is still alive amen the word of God is women every day every time every hour that word has been proven amen and amen every time that word has been tested amen he still has the same result amen Jesus Christ is the light of is the light of the world amen Jesus Christ is the light amen is that light that created the Heaven and Earth amen is that light in the beginning amen that logos amen is that light that led the children of Israel amen is that light that Paul saw amen is that light that Moses saw amen is that light that can't be remaining Services when brother Branham was preaching amen it's that same life from Genesis to Revelation amen that light is Jesus Christ the son of God Amen Matthew chapter 5 verse 14 to 16 it says that ye are the light of the world a city that is set on the hill cannot be hidden neither do men like the candle and put it under the bushel but on the candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light still shine before man that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven amen Jesus himself is calling you the light of the world Amen in other words is calling you you are the Vindication of God's spoken word amen in other words he's calling you you are the Vindication man you are the result amen of that spoken word amen you are the light of the world Amen Let Your Lights amen let your life amen be amen let your life amen let your light so shine before all men let your life remain so shine before all men amen so that men will see you amen they will look at you they will look at your life they will look at your light amen that we see Christ Living inside of you amen that we see the same cross who walked amen amen uh 2 000 years ago amen that we see the same cross walking with you amen Islam was like wow you guys remember uh you guys make us think about the man who wants to live here on Earth amen his name was Christ so therefore we called you we'll call you guys Christians amen because the word the manifestation amen of that word amen the word the literal amen they were walking like Jesus walked him and they were talking like Jesus talked amen they weren't doing the exact same thing that Jesus did so when they said when they saw them they was like well you guys are Christians because you you do live like Jesus Christ himself he do live like himself amen he is the light amen when you are in the light amen everybody will know that there is light somewhere amen you go to a city where there is Darkness amen is like back home and sometimes you you come back home and and night them and the entire city is dark amen there is no power there's no electricity but there's some worry I mean you'll see a house with the light on we see the house and man with the light on it meant that house from afar you will still know that that house is light it meant that that house amen you will see even even you miles away you will see that like what because the light cannot be hit by Darkness it meant the light will always have power over Darkness amen Delight will always have victory over Darkness amen and when if you are in Christ amen Christ is the light man you are in him amen you will always have power you have you always have power amen you always have victory over the devil amen because set in this Darkness amen and God is the light and if you are in him and you abide in him that means that you will always have power you will always have Victory amen when darkness will be there amen because Darkness can never hide the light and my delight will always shine amen we light will always Shine the lights always cast Darkness away amen and he said that he is the light amen you have to believe in the light in order for you to walk in the light amen if you believe in Jesus Christ amen you're walking in the light amen and when you walk in the light wherever you go it may even do that place is dark you mean your presence amen will bring the atmosphere of God Amen your presence will bring the light of God will change people atmospheres amen your Praises amen will bring blessings amen your presence amen will bring amen amen joy and smile on people amen it's like Joseph amen everywhere he was going amen wherever he was touching those things were blessed amen those things were being blessed even though he was in prison him and everything he was doing amen those things were blessed amen it was succeeding why because he was the light of God Amen why his presence was bringing the life amen his presence was bringing delight and so is every Christian amen wherever you are amen your job and everything in your school and everywhere amen they are blessed because you are there amen they're all blessed Because of You amen they are blessed Because of You amen because God said that you will he will bless you Amen in everything that you do I think it's uh Deuteronomy chapter 32 or chapter 30. I don't remember anymore it meant the presence of God they meant Delight amen wherever that light is amen there is no Darkness amen light got Cast Away Darkness amen and if you see that you're in darkness your life is dark and when you just go to Christ amen because he is the light as we read it amen hears the light and when you are in the light you become the light amen because he is Delight amen he made you the light he said that you are the light of the world Amen when this word is dark amen amen God is looking at you and he's still the light amen it's like if you go back and share with me uh Jeremiah chapter chapter the first thing the first three chapters of Jeremiah when Jeremiah was going to God and said Lord look at how the people are sinning and God was God wanted to to destroy the people in the seek God what if you find one person God God taught Jeremiah go go in the city go look if you find even one person I God will spare the seating amen if you find even one person amen if you find even one light in the city when everything is dark even if you find one light I God will spare the city amen that is the reason this world is not yet destroyed amen it's because you are still in here amen it's because you are still in the world Amen that's why God is keeping the world safe amen because you are in in here amen because you are in the world Amen once we're gone it meant the destruction will come amen because we are amen without you there is complete darkness without you there is no hope amen people look at you and they're working at home they see hope they see that one day there is still hope there are still Christians there are still people who are still harness they'll see people who still believe in the word of God Amen people your life your lives are examples to people amen you may not know it but I'm I'm pretty sure that people didn't know it they know it's your life they know it is how you speak and how you behave yourself and yourself they know that you are Christian amen you are the Son of God because there is that life that is coming from you I mean it's like one day I went to a store uh uh I think it was a JCPenney store and I was talking to uh uh uh uh I got my shirt and I was buying a shirt and I was about to check out and I was talking to that old that lady an old lady was uh was helping me to pay for my my shirt was helping me check out amen and she was helping me and she looked at me and she asked me if I was a Christian I didn't I before I didn't even say a word to her I mean she was asking me questions and I was you know answering all the questions about credit cards and stuff like that because she wanted me to apply for uh the credit card JCPenney credit card for having discounts and stuff like that and I didn't talk about God at all man she asked me if I was a Christian I said yes ma'am I'm a Christian I asked you how about how did you know because I didn't say anything about God or anything I didn't wear a shirt that says that God is God or something like that I didn't have on me anything that proved that I was a Christian she said well there is a light that is coming from you amen when I see you I see a light a certain light that is coming from you that's how I knew that you are you are a Christian because I feel that's with spirit in you that is coming that's what I could tell that you are a Christian amen wherever you go those people they know they know who you are amen they know who you are you man it's like it's like when G Jesus went to a uh to preach the souls that was in prison when he went to uh get the keys from the devil amen he knew who Jesus was amen when he came but you knew when Jesus went to here amen I forgot the name of that man amen that man who had Legion inside of him amen before he even got before he even started talking to women those Legion inside of him amen they knew who Jesus was they said but why are you coming at this time amen coming to coming to disturb us amen why are you coming they knew the presence of the Lord was there amen they know if you are in Christ amen if you have crossed inside of you amen the devil who knows exactly who you are amen that's why he's afraid of touching you amen that's why before touching you has to go ask for permission to God himself amen they know exactly who you are because you are the light amen the light has always victory over Darkness amen the prophet says that yes sir they're believed all all the way long so does Satan amen he also believed the word amen those Pharisees who could condemn them it may not be who could condemn them not believing but they didn't believe the word of the hour they were worshiping the glare of something else amen it's the same thing they're doing today see they're keeping up Luther's uh Traditions Wesley's Wesley's traditions and the rest of them the Pentecostal tradition but what what what what of the hour the Pharisees was keeping up their Traditions but behind the Traditions was the true word of God coming to shine forth and when he did he blinded their eyes he meant they couldn't see it because they was watching something else so it is today may God let that soak in till it really hits home to the people that should believe it it's later than you think amen those people those those Pharisees amen they knew the word amen inside today people know the word it looks like everybody can preach now amen the people know the word they can tell you exactly how God created the world that can tell you it meant everything that you want to know about God's love they can tell you everything that you want to know about Redemption amen they can quote the scriptures they meant from Genesis chapter 1 to revelation amen but they're not believing in that word amen they're believing their Traditions they meant they're hiding them from the truth amen Genesis chapter chapter 9 verse 12 to 16. amen the Bible says here that and God said this is the token of the Covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for a Perpetual Generations I do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of of a covenant between me and the and the Earth and it shall come to pass when you bring when I bring a cloud over the Earth that the bow shall be seen in the cloud and now we remember my Covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of of All Flesh and the water shall no more become a flight to destroy all flesh and the boat shall be in that is it meant that bow was what was it was was a sign that God gave to Noah a sign of Peace amen a sign of Amen that I will no longer destroy the world with with uh uh uh with the flood amen you see that the bow which is that the rainbow was talking about the rainbow has served seven colors amen and in physics Amanda says that uh Isaac Newton I mean he experienced this he said that when you take the white light amen and then you make that white light go through a pyramid amen that white light will divide itself to seven different colors of the world of the rainbow amen you see that before that before Genesis chapter 9 before God divided himself to rain boy man God was that one light amen he was that one light amen and he let himself be divided amen throughout the church ages amen he let himself be divided amen with from the be divided by the seven spirits of the seventh fruit of the spirit amen he let himself be divided Amen to so that his spirits him and go throughout the seven Church ages amen he let himself go through that pyramid Amen to divide himself to seven different colors Amen to seven different colors amen the prophet says that why why seven callers from one main light which is Christ the prophet says that what did God do to that perfect man amen he says that there is only one of them in the world only one in the world and that was him talking about Jesus and God chiseled him of of here Jesus Jesus him off here he was wounded for our transgressions because I was a sinner he let the rainbow light of his seven Church ages flush upon me to know that he was wounded for my transgressions there is your seven colored rainbow he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace upon him with his tribes we were healed God caught him that he might reflect through his dying wounds forgiveness of sin joy peace long suffering goodness meekness gentleness the seven spirits of God are the seven fruits of the spirit that would reflect back in his people he was bruised shaped and formed that the light of God shining through that one man's body might redeem the whole world I'll be lifted up from the Earth are draw all men through unto me watch those rainbow colors as they reflect amen he said I was the one perfect man he is the only one who's perfect amen he's the perfect image that God was looking from the beginning of the world Amen the prophet said that when God created the Heaven and Earth when God created the first man Adam and Eve amen amen the word perfect God was looking for that Masterpiece amen he created that's why he created an Adam and Eve amen they were perfect before but they had to fail amen the sin and then they lost it they went out of the picture amen and God didn't stop there I mean God was still looking for that perfect man God was still looking for that Masterpiece amen then after that self came and after that uh David came Joseph came which the prophet says that he is the perfect amen he's of he's the is almost uh his life is the perfect uh image of Christ but Joseph had to lie amen amen that that took him out of the picture and got through all the ages and when he was looking for that Masterpiece amen he was looking for that Perfect Image imagine meant to reflect himself in the world amen and then Jesus came amen Jesus was that Masterpiece when he created Jesus amen when Jesus came amen he said that this is the one I'm looking for amen this is the Masterpiece that I'm looking for amen this is the perfect image he meant that I was looking for amen this is the perfect man that I've been looking for him and since the beginning of the world Amen this is that perfect man that I'm looking for amen and God just didn't want to keep him for himself amen God had to divide that Jesus amen God had to divide that perfect man to break him him into different parts amen so that through him amen are the perfect men can come amen so that through him amen you might be so that through him you become perfect amen so that through him amen we become perfect amen God saw that Perfect Image amen God through God so Jesus was the Masterpiece of God's creation am I the perfect man reflecting God's word amen reflecting the word of God Amen he couldn't

just won amen God wanted to have children amen God wanted to have many perfect men walking down the Earth amen God wanted to have amen masterpieces amen walking amen that's why he had to strike that lamb amen that's why he had to strike Jesus that's why he had to strike amen that light of God Amen he had to let the light women go through the pyramid amen divide that light even seven seven
