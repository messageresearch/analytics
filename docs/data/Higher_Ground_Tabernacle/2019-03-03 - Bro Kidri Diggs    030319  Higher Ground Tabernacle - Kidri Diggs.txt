us by your spirit in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and we thank you lord it's amen amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to the Book of Ruth Book of Ruth the first chapter Ruth and then we're going to go to 2nd chronicles second chronicles I think I'm gonna chop to 18 Ruth chapter 1 Ruth chapter 1 if you have a say man the Bible says now came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn in a country of Moab he and his wife and his two sons in the name of the man was a limb elect in the name of his wife Naomi in the name of his two sons my lon and Kyle on e4 Knights of Bethlehem Judah and they came into the country of Moab and continued there and Elimelech Naomi's husband died and she was left and her two sons and they took them wives of the women of Moab the name of one was offer and the name of the other roof and they dwelt there about 10 years and Malin and kai-lan died also both of them and the women was left of her two sons and her husband amen let's go to second chronicles chapter 18 second chronicles chapter 18 we're also gonna start at verse 1 the Bible says now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance enjoying affinity with a hab and after seven at and after certain years he went down to a hab in Samaria and a hab kills sheep and oxen for him in abundance and for the people that he had with him and persuaded him to go up with him to ramoth-gilead and am king of israel said unto joseph at king of judah wilt thou go with me to ramoth-gilead and he answered him I am as thou are and my people as thy people and we will be with thee in the war and Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel inquire I pray thee at the word of the Lord today he made me the Lord of the Blessed reading of his word you can have your seats amen you know today I want I want to use for a subject a familiar for me a thought but we just with we're we're we're depending on God to bring this out a man you know and today I want to use for a subject under the influence a man under the influence you know and as we look at it influence is a powerful thing you know sometimes you can be you can be being influenced by something and you realize the effect of it you don't even realize the spirit behind what's influencing you you know and you know that's why they talk about you know sports and idols and all those things because whatever they like will influence your life you know one of the most influential women in the world today is Beyonce you know any kind of soul she come out with any kind of any kind of dress she come out with it influences the generations that are following her you know and she don't have to do much but just step out and show it she'll have to say much to do much but just because of a person she is you know it influences so many different people on so many different levels you know and you take a a man like Michael Jordan who's not even playing basketball anymore but he still has such an influence on the game that mean when they come into the league they go and study his field they're going steady the way he playing and his life has such an influence on the game today and he's not even playing you know church if we could just think about the spirit behind the spirit amen and look at your life right now and ask the question to yourself what's influencing you amen you know but I want to show two kinds of influences I want to show the influence and the Bible of of of the chapter Ruth you know what how how roof and and offering Naomi they all were under the headship of their husbands and then all of a sudden they didn't have time to prepare for death you know and the husband's dying and the influence of the husbands now we're going and it's like what can we do now hallelujah and we looked at Naomi her influence of our daughter-in-laws he told both of them I want you to go back to wherever you come from go back to your mama's house you know offer us she said okay i'ma go but Ruth Ruth saw something in her mother in her mother-in-law she saw something she had such a great influence she wasn't willing to go back where she came from she was willing to go back to the homeland everything that she was knew he had no longer other influence in her life the life that she was living it meant so much more greater to her that she wouldn't listen to the mother-in-law trying to get her to go back where she came from so chuckling we look at influence influence Amen you know when you think about a person that likes to drink and smoke and everything their body's being influenced by certain stuff and you know one thing I realize about a person listen maybe say he's an alcoholic you know when that man get something in his system and he's influenced you know always wonder why they call alcohol and beer spirits do realize that when you go and look at the store they have on it spirits because that alcohol oh yeah that substance it has the ability to make come out of you what you wouldn't already say or what you wouldn't already do it has the ability to take over your body take over your mind take over your actions and you can be under the influence of a substance oh my and you know just when we look at influences today there are so many different influences their influences of music and and influences of hardwood and influences of clothing and all these things but where are these influences coming from honey that's the question we have to ask ourself you ever ask yourself right now what's influencing you a man am I being influenced from a boss oh I'm being influenced from below haruya you know lean brother Brooks was riding back home last night and we got this we got this talking about when we were younger and kind of before we got saving things you know we started talking about horror pictures and in the movies and things like that and both of us agreed that we were never of that group that loves to go and watch horror pictures because they were something in our spirit that realized the influence of killing and murder and all these things it came from the underworld it came from demon powers and for you to give yourself over into that you're contributing to that influence and you refer yourself doing things earlier that comes from the underworld you know it's and it's really plain because where would the influence come from to cut somebody's hand off that wouldn't come from God but people easily give themselves over to these things and they don't even realize the spirit behind and they're watching it and it's born into their system but what they're doing they're feeling an evil spirit hey you know Church it's so easy to do things like that in the Bible you know there was a woman named Herodias you know she married a man and she should've married a man and you know John the Baptist he spoke about that he told them you know y'all shouldn't got married and she hated John because John spoke the truth John was under the influence of God and at that moment when her and her husband honey honey you got married she married her brother's husband she married her husband's brother and John said that ain't right you shouldn't be doing it and because she was under such an influence of getting whatever she wanted she couldn't even see the truth honey you know she got mad at that and the other day the King the one she married he had a celebration honey you know we all like the dance but be careful there's a spirit behind every dance and this particular woman Herodias daughter she got again and she starts shaking it up well she started to bring it down and you know the king he he was very enticed he was liking that dance he was liking the way she was shaking it out he liked it so much - it influenced him to tell her I give you whatever you want in my King just wanna dance that dance was so powerful that King said God you can have whatever I got dancing is powerful it's a spirit but am I in the book talk to the church they were in the book holy and the reason why it's so tight because this morning because we're dealing with spirits honey hey man but you know Church she danced and she danced and the King loved it and all the people around him they loved it again what makes Beyonce so popular the way she moves the way she days you need all about her singing it's about her body her movement the influence of her dress there is a spirit behind hallelujah and you know Church throat his daughter she danced and she danced in the king you know what he said he said hey girl I love the way you move it I love the way you shake it I'm gonna give you heylia whatever you extra and she said okay I want the hand of John the Baptist so what kind of spirit was behind that dance it was a spirit of Mara it was a spirit of death he was a spirit of death behind that dance even though that King liked it so we have to be careful what's influencing us honey cuz you can look at something and he can look pleasurable if you look innocent but it'll be an evil spirit behind hallelujah you can say hey I want to do this I want to do that but you have to be careful hurry and watch the spirit behind the things we like you know and some people they still like drink a little casual drink drink a little bit of wine take a little bit of juice hallelujah and they don't realize honey there's a spirit behind you've been casually that's what Satan wants us to be he wants us to be casual because you know what you do with these casual you don't see no harm in it that's why they call it a little white lie ain't no lie white oh my but you know treasure look they beginning to look at Ruth Ruth saw something that her sister-in-law couldn't see and she said you know what wherever you go I'm going whenever you do I'm doing the guy you service my god honey whenever you like I'm Allah whatever you need imma eat she saw greater influence in Naomi's life earlier not only Naomi but in Naomi's relationship with her husband oh yeah think about the influence Church I begin to look in the Bible and I begin to think of two men true fathers and their influence and I look at the influence of Noah look at his influence honey Noah he preached for 120 years young people I want you to get it the influence of your parents is not about stopping your fun especially if they are Christians holy the influence of a parent hurry is that you may make it to the rapture that's what it's all about they're trying to stop you full they trying to mess up relationships they're trying to save you it's so often God is misunderstood in his people and you know you look at Noah you think about it for the first 10 years he probably preached the same message he's gonna rain he's gonna rain honey he didn't change the text he probably even changed his suit he's gonna rain every time he came to church it's gonna rain and father came hurry up in the evening time he's go rain they came in the morning it's go rain they came on the holidays this terrain Easter message this terrain Christmas message mr. rain every holiday President's Day it's going honey he preached the same message hugs and his family his family probably looked at him and Noah was misunderstood but he knew he heard from God he knew that message he knew he's been influenced by higher power what was that influence that influence hallelujah was there that they may escape judgment honey and your family looked at him and you know can you imagine his boys you know they probably athletes because they said let's take a break from from the arc and it's gonna shoot some hoops today I want to work with my crossover you know I got on some new jobs I think I can jump now you know Noah he might have a son we ain't got time for that it's gonna rain huh and brother Adam they probably looked at they dad and they say this man crazy we can't have no fun we can't do nothing all right here is about this message it's gonna rain honey why church no I heard from God he was under the influence he was not doing his will he was doing God's will and him being misunderstood that whole message was dad to save his family it wasn't about him honey so you know it's ten years later nice 20 years it's the rain still preaching it's gonna rain 30 years later it's gonna rain 40 years later its terrain 60 years later there's no rain it didn't change why cuz the influence was great when you're being influenced by God you cannot shake it subtly it's not your wheel its history uglier remember Jesus was going to the cross he said lord if it be possible take this cup from me honey that was the influence of his fresh the god of glory honey got to a space where the devil tried to influence his fresh honey but the Commission the Word of God was greater in his life hallelujah and he says nevertheless not my will but thy will be done there was a greater influence and what did that influence you that influence changed the way we would live forever huh it changed our lives forever that's what that influence but you know you look at Noah and you think about it maybe one day maybe it's about 70 years later he's still preaching it's going you know there were other men and probably other preachers in that day as a man you need to preach someone look different the people need a little bit more entertainment but no one said all I got is just one message it's gonna rain oh yeah with that we don't want to be influenced by popular opinion we want to say well God has us to say hallelujah we want to be where God has us to be honey and I don't care that our prophet has been gone for 50 years I'm still under the influence hurry that there will be a rapture honey and that this message holier that our prophet honey William Branham was not influenced by the Catholic Church not influenced by the Pentecostal church not influenced hardly about a Baptist or the Methodist but his influence came directly from the pillar fire you say brother legs why are you so excited cuz I'm under the influence and I guarantee you I guarantee you heaven won't be like this ain't gonna be no language various and they're gonna be no cold steel worship they're gonna be none of us observing who goes out necks honey he ain't gonna be no comfortable seats earlier it ain't gonna be no I want to mess up my hand you ain't gonna be no I don't want to sweat you ain't ain't gonna be no I'm waiting on this I'm waiting on that it's gonna be a ha ha an eternal worship we don't be caught up we'll be under influence only influence that I escape judgment holy I escaped death hell and the grave I will be under the influence cause eternity I want you to think about what kind of influence you under right now honey just imagine just imagine how many of us want to be in heaven honey now your attitudes should reflect that because the Bible says we are now in heavenly places colors ain't waiting to get there to show you what imma be earlier I'm gonna what I am over here is what imma be over there huh you're ain't gonna be the raptures not gonna influence me to change I'm being changed right now Carly Turk do you realize we are the waters holy that's been losing the rapture to take place it's because of you and your lifestyle why the raptures gonna take place and you know if you think about heaven we ain't gonna just be sitting here looking around in our comfort zones Church what initiates worship what influence what influence hallelujah Miriam to grab that tambourine and start the shop start the dance hallelujah and then not only her but she influenced all the daughters of Zion all the daughters of Israel she grabbed a tambourine honey do you realize the tambourine Holly was an instrument that was produced in bondage oh they were in bondage and instruments of praise hallelujah Church can you imagine you read that story and do they get on the other side and she brings out the tambourine and she starts to dancing she's under the influence she's under the influence why is she so happy because the prophet of God said she looked behind her and she saw all her trouble hung up our depression earlier our slavery amen all the hate every attribute of the flesh she saw it being drowned in the sea and what did it do it produced a wash up I don't know my child but I'm not a promise of a body change and I will be influenced earlier but that body change so what is cold outside I'm sorry I come from a hot climate I ain't got time to be cold and starchy I was born to be loose brother Keith honey forget the heaven y'all won't see me honey I don't think can you imagine church when it's all over no Bo crying huh you don't have to pray anymore lord save my children it's over oh you don't have to pray anymore no I bring my child back home Lord open the eyes church is over because you are under the right influence and the devils line to some of you telling you it you know take all that will you tell me what does it take huh you know you think about it we need to have it it ain't gonna be no quiet time for us to sit there and gather our thoughts honey or for us to discern where the preachers going how do you discern what he's talking about you know you might even say well brother geez that's not my name we ain't talking about your nature we're talking about the influence of God and the influence of God has nothing to do it my nature but it has to do it who I suffer because of who is and you know who he is he's wonderful he's counselor he's Prince of Peace he's not mighty God think about that church when you speak of your God what kind of influences come to mind banana when I say he's wonderful honey wonderful means extraordinary hope you know like in in in in in in in real English culture when you figure something wonderful they don't just say wonderful they say oh my that was delicious going and we look at that we think about it something to eat but no it's an adjective to describe how great it was honey and they may say oh my that was beautiful they say no that was delicious honey church I want you to understand that our God is delicious the Bible says come and taste and see that the Lord is gracious our God this morning is delicious I want you to fall under the atmosphere follow under the influence this is better than chance this is better than cognac color this is better than swap colors wow we're talking about the grace of God and if you fall under the influence it'll change your life can you imagine being in heaven you got a body change and gonna be the most wedding church they ain't gonna be no high blood pressure huh ain't gonna be no low blood pressure ain't gonna be no worrying ain't gonna be no doubt there it's gonna be an eternal honey atmosphere of faith honey and you know we got a chance to experience that over here the prophet of God said death does not change who you are it only changed your dwelling place so what you're giving me right now would be the same thing that you give God and he was on this pulpit preacher let's make it real clear God is on this pulpit preacher hallelujah God is still standing behind skin the pillar of fire became a man hallelujah hallelujah God being misunderstood hallelujah we look at preachers as men no those preachers are ordained of God in there under an influence can you imagine when we get there get in heaven and we're under the influence of a celebration Kevin's going to be a celebration you think about it when we get together they have our little potlucks and you didn't prepare Joe dish and you said well they won't taste my beans today I cook these beans I put my foot these are real beans they're gonna take these beans they don't love these beans Church hurry up when we get to heaven it's gonna be the best of the best can you imagine those that we read about in the Bible we're gonna be there with them early then they might not hallelujah see my name in the Bible but when I get there they gonna know who I am they gonna know who you are because hurry up without them I ain't complete oh hey so there's be no power without me there'd be no Abraham without me earlier he's the father faint what made him the father faint us his children because we're the promise of that faith oh don't play but you look I'm gonna be long y'all know about clothes think about what's influency let me let me let me hit something the prophet of God said when we think about influence he says he's doing influence that there is an influence from above he said God saves you and he influences you to get the Holy Ghost and from the Holy Ghost you go into the presence of God hungry and to the presence of God hardly to the life of God to living with God all that starts were being influenced to give your life to be a believer and then Satan has this influence that comes from the underworld and it starts with backslide it starts with going backwards instead of forward and then you open yourself up to spirits earlier spirits that'll keep you from headed you see I Satan does he perverts the truth come on but when we look at a real influence hunger you know catch Ruth she knew nothing about God she wasn't more bite you know she come from a heathen background but she married into a family holier and she didn't know the full potential of that family honey and you know that she watched a limb awaken Naomi the Bible I mean the prophet of God said that Naomi and eliminate those two names put together it meant Pleasant worship so she watched the life she was a marriage a pleasant worship oh yeah so when it was time to make decisions all she could think about was what was in front of her all she could think about was that Pleasant worship and then Naomi says hey my daughter I have no more children I have no husband for you so you might as well go back to your mama all for said deuces I'm out of here loafers and peace I'm going back to my denomination I'm going back where I come from I'm out of here mother-in-law you've been good but my husband dead and I got needs don't let your knees influence you out of the presence of God oh my so she leaves and Naomi you know like I said no you only said wherever you go I'm going yo God is my god but you large I lost Naomi says basically who you are is life and she didn't even realize how you here what who Naomi really was Naomi said okay I'm going back home follow my influence I'm going back home and what did Naomi do honey Naomi how do you led her right to her kiss me Redeemer oh yeah so the right influence will lead you to the climax of your life hallelujah she thought she had a good husband but Naomi rather took a redeemer a kinsman redeemer a type of Christ hallelujah going and once she made that Union she begins connect in ways that she couldn't do with our first husband hallelujah and test she went from just being a regular woman honey to now she's married to the type of Christ she even realized her husband was under an influence her husband's mother name was rare honey Rahab was influenced earlier by God even though she had a life it looked like she was influenced by prostitution but that was the will of God you know we look at some things and we wonder why we go through what we go through the prophet of God say is simply God projecting himself let me encourage you if you got trouble in your life you got difficulties in your life you're wondering right now what shall I do let me tell you something God is in control oh yeah God is in control the devil can never sneak up on God and matter of fact God tells him who to give the child to did he do that the devil came to church one day when the sons of God were presenting themselves and the Bible says and Satan came also and he came and God say hey devil what you doing here today he's a man you know me I'm trying to mess somebody up you know what I'm trying to do I'm trying to mess up somebody like and then God says hey have you considered my servant Joe Dawsey I got somebody for you to try so stop complaining and say Lord I know you all myself I can't go through this unless you cosign God cosign my suffering he co-signed my trouble honey yeah why because he's trying to make something come out of me huh Church CDs down then you look door ads was caught on the in influence he saw roof one time one time he couldn't take his eyes off oh he's like who's damsel is this he was under such an influence he began to tell his workers hey I won't try to leave something special for her and I Ruth hurry it's being blessed because she followed me only honey but Naomi knowing honey that the kids were redeemable asses down there and once boy has got his eyes on Ruth honey that he wouldn't stop until he redeem oh wow God ain't gonna stop until you become will he call you to become hi Ruth she followed she did everything Naomi said do this and do that next thing you know she in the man bad change honey any other woman would die honey but there was something special about Ruth Hurley Branson man this is just enough I came taking them all I got to have her she got to be mine hug he said what my side dude he said the only way you can get huh as if you Holly you take me only to Holland so nail me new hallelujah and he can get hurt fall in love with Ruth and she'll be taking off so Holly turn how do you God holy has showed us his parents Holly if I can get God to take me he got to take everything that belongs to me look like I said earlier when I talk about the influences of parents that noise influence was so great 8090 years later of preaching it's gonna rain maybe one day his wife say honey you ain't quite uni Titleist you preaching something that nobody has never heard before you preaching something that the world has never seen before and nor all he could say was I know when my thoughts are coming from I know her I know it may look ridiculous building this big old boat that nobody else has ever seen but I want you to realize I've heard from God Church and when you've heard from God you ain't got time to turn around honey you ain't got time to see what the world is offering amen hariya there's nothing greater than being in the presence of God the in church 120 years up Suns in the boat wife in the boat and all of a sudden it starts to rain and that lightning comes down those boys probably sit there shaking and if I looked at they daddy and they brought us a old daddy we thank you so much Oh daddy we love you so much I'm so glad I listened to you Oh Lord I'm so glad I listened to you daddy father daddy I thank you so much then we follow Joey influence harlot because what he was preaching wasn't about himself he was about his family escaping the judgment they couldn't see it all tails are the right influence they look Turks the rain was coming so hard hurry that it lifts that big old massive boat up I believe it only had one window that can you imagine honey like a couple of weeks ago when y'all snowstorm came when it was so bad she couldn't even drive in this rain was coming down so hard you couldn't even walk in that's the hard it was coming down and you know they look out that window and they see that thundering that's light and everything Noah's wife she probably looked up her heard all that crackling was a thunder lightning and looked at her husband and say oh god I married the right man I so thank you that you are that you had the fear of God in you what good is a man or a woman to you and I without the fear of God in a life huh you're under the wrong influence but you look at that influence it saved this whole family and you take another man this man this man named light everybody all right y'all know this ain't no insurance seminar now I ain't going go pass out no cookies and drinks after this and go get you know booklets and pants holy this is about life surely not a shooting not not not not not insurance claims this is about eternal life surely this is about real substance a man holy this is a claim that will never expire you don't need no adjustments hurry we're going but you know Church you look at life the Bible says the Bible says the sins of Sodom thanks like righteous soul and you know what lies family fell under his influence that's why it's very important as demanding your house to keep your standards cuz your children depending on your wife's depend on honey keep your standards hold your ground man because yo if yo if your beliefs a weak it affect your family anyway honey if your Christian life is weak it will affect your family honey so you have to hire you be strong in the Lord and can you imagine like he's looking down at Sodom he wasn't even there yet but he's looking at Sodom and the glamour and the glitz of Sodom influenced him and he left where he was with Abraham and he went down the side so what lie did light put his family in harm's way why cuz he fell into the wrong influence I believe the prophet of God said he became governor over the city and you know we always talk about remember Lot's wife she was in our condition because her husband but now I'm gonna tell you something the influences of the world are nothing to play with don't play with the devil because I guarantee he's stronger than what you think huh they're people I know right now honey who got out there and they trying to do everything they can do to get back but it's so hard you know how you get back give up just tell God I can't do it God I need your help no I don't know what to do next Lord Here I am take me not I put my life in your hands honey you don't try to get good yourself you just give up let God do the rest one man told brother Bernie said I'm gonna come to church as soon as I stop smoking brother and say don't stop smoking you trying to get good he said dude don't try to get good you come as you are that God make you good and you know that's how the devil trick us we say well Lord you know I really want to serve you but I got this going on I got that going you think you don't know that you know what you're doing you know your shortcomings he know your mistakes let me tell you something God allowed it you say how did I get in this condition God allowed it that you st. you you sanctimonious a super spiritual holy people young away man me because you feel like I'm righteous I'm holy I ain't never did what they did let me tell you something that's because God didn't allow it it ain't because you're good it's because God maybe had a different path you husband but let me ask you something who's gonna give God more praise an angel or redeem Saint somebody that been through something somebody that no they don't deserve the grace of God somebody that was a right State Sheila honey somebody that didn't deserve the grace of God oh yeah we gonna praise God like we never did before and you stand there all you know and say well I ain't never did that so what I did and I still got the reward [Music] cuz what I want you to realize when I was in the cloud I was still a son of God when I was watching the roll Bango TV I was still a son of God and I made mistakes I was still another girl I want you to realize something your mistakes does not change the seed inside oh the Bible calls her Rahab the harlot but she still with the word that Jesus ready see come through so hard being a harlot did not change her destination [Applause] let me tell you something in the south we have hurricanes we have tornadoes you know sometimes the Hurricanes come and they tear up trees break branches but you know what when a hurricane is going in the Sun starts shining the apple tree it started produce apples all over again that storm earlier it doesn't stop the life that's within it that broken limb hallelujah doesn't stop the life within a man that pain that struggle those wheels roaring it does not stop the life better see so I want to tell you today embrace your struggle embrace the struggle embrace the struggle Paul said I am what I am by the grace of God God knows he know what he doing he said church is his plan he says in order to reign with me you got to suffer with me you know in the Book of Psalms I think it's 169 some win it the Bible says David begin to say unto the Lord David said it was good for me that I was afflicted whose bill for me that I was a fling he said because before I was afflicted I went astray honey what is God doing if you going through something it's God trying to put you on the right path we sit back and criticize one another and say but I wouldn't did this how would they did that huh let me tell you again God is in control one day you're always going through something and I started to think I was like me why this why that and just left out of church and my pastor made the statement he said you know what let's get this idly cuz I guess he could feel it in the room you know sometimes you can feel it in the room people were in a doesn't worried about that you know they got so many struggles and all the stuff he said let's get this out the way Satan can't do nothing to what God allowed and I have searched it's going down the road and I was think about my struggle I don't think about my trial and then you know what came the words of my pastor that Satan can do nothing but what God allowed do you know what I did from there had them I started laughing in the car I started giving God praise I turned the radio up I started the worshipping God cuz that let me know I'm right in the will of God Church thank you for your birth without any pain [Music] hallelujah but now we're in the time of climax we're in the time of climax one thing I love about the Bible is that God takes his man but he keeps his spirit he keeps that influence gone and you look at Moses the Bible says he talks about Moses there was nobody more humble than Moses it was another man like Moses but what was the climax was Moses ministry what was the greatest influence Moses had on the people it was Joshua because Moses ministry the climax of his ministry was a Joshua somebody that could in somebody that could could finish what he started somebody that was under his influence but not only under it when Moses left he continued early that's when you know you under the right influence people can leave church they can talk about the pastor all these things but you ever meet God you ever meet God you'll continue hallelujah and you know when we look in the Bible and we see that God brought a profit on the scene named Elijah what was the climax of Elijah's life it was Elijah oh hey man he likes her lujah influence he likes a man and remember just like roof he he tried to get rid of me say nope well there you go I'm gonna yo God is my god when you crossed the river I'm across the river your next step gonna be my next step oh he was under the influence what influence he was under he was under divine intervention huh he wasn't just following the elijah he was following God huh in church as we look through the Bibles and we see how things go you looked at John the Baptist was such a great man but what was the climax what was the greatest influence that John could ever give to the people it was Jesus huh cuz the dough that followed John they met up with Jesus earlier that was the climax of his influence a man because he said I must decrease so that he can increase honey so church yo influence should lead you into your adoption this church thing about brother Bruce's churches about you hallelujah if you take the message of the hour and you ask yourself what was brother branham's greatest achievement who's the third pool it was it was it the boo wasn't stopping storms no his greatest achievement was not getting in God's Way and preaching a message that we could hear and understand honey so the climax of brother Benno's ministry is you and I hurry because we're taking this message and we're making it really good this message is no longer see when it climaxes it changes into a greater form Haru you just like from John the Jesus amen Church the climax of this of this message honey is changing the form of it from boots and tanks to a person hallelujah we are the climax of this message will you see me hurry you see the revelation of Jesus Christ but when I see you I see the opening of the seals but I see you I see the word I see spoken word authority holy play but instead influence and to close with my opening statement my opening scripture God comes we're already here in second chronicles the story between 1/2 and Joseph and Joseph and was a king hey I was a king ahab's red was the king of Judah hey I was the king of Israel let me say this yeah new by God but what men say I'm up he's falling his wife he had a wicked wife we get James Jezebel and you know they did one day they went and killed an innocent man and took his vineyard neighbors and God didn't like God said you're gonna pay for that the dogs gonna lick your blood in the same spot where you killed neighbor that was a prophecy but you know it looked like it wasn't gonna happen cuz am a hab new God am praying honey that God have mercy go back and read read in your Bible the Bible says God says you see how am humbled himself before me through fasting and prayer I'm not gonna bring the judgment on in him i'ma bringing in his sons day honey that's because this man was influenced he was still under the influence even though he had a wicked wife but he messed up cuz he found his wife so God still had to make it work on the past I preached a message called God being politically incorrect the thing that you think he gonna do he do something different a lot I need you to do this I need to do they do a completely different way so lord I need another car he's doing a whole different way Oh Lord I need money to pay these be he doing a whole different way he's not politically correct he does it incorrectly why to show us that all we have to do is believe and you look Church he could easily gave Abraham and Sarah a child but God being politically incorrect Kolya he does things earlier that seemed impossible to make it possible you took a woman that was old a man that was overly and gave him a child after 25 years of it being spoken and believed politically incorrect honey but you know Church he tears he says Jehoshaphat they have am coming together he's hey you help me go and take ramoth-gilead and jobs Vance a foot show me you bro we brothers I got your back what to fight I fight who make you mad make me mad we're in this thing together the Dean it was just something a little strange about in in Joseph and spirit Joseph si but wait let's inquire of the Lord even though he agreed he still had another influence inside he said is there not another voice in the lake honey and then a I'm says yes it is yes it is but he never says anything good about so he was already under the influence that he was wrong he knew if he with the mic macaé that Mikael was gonna tell him that he was wrong see a lot of times we do things that we already know we on the wrong influence preachers turn out to come and preach all that like you living in what you're doing and all that stuff you already know if you are a human being you have condemnation already a woman a woman that's been in the presence of God she knows she dressing roll sometimes she only want to look in the mirror because she knows too sure what do you think about this the Prophet God said you got a question don't wait you got a question that means doubt that's it we make things too complicated just simpler we live the more we see God now like Church but you see these two that come together and in a abscess and says hey we're gonna inquire for him but I'm gonna tell you right now he goes thing than good so they go down to mkhaya him they send the messages down there and Micaiah said hey go up okay go take the land go am say did not tell you to tell me what the lord say he already know he wrote simply because the prophet mkhaya is telling him what he won't hear but he's no hero so he said can be what god's sake he said well if you even come back God never even spoke to me he gets mad because the man told him the truth he smacks the prophet he said oh you eat on that give him bread of affliction in water and so forth I did with you and I get back but what I want you to realize about this whole story God had already said the air will you kill neighbors the dogs gonna kill blood huh so not anybody to go to battle and God says who what can I do to influence am to go to this battle and then the Bible says God now being politically incorrect come hallelujah the Spirit comes up and says Lord send me what kind of spirit wasn't it was a lying spirit oh man those prophets saying God God they were under the influence of a lying spirit but Church God allowed it God used a lying spirit hallelujah that is word may come to pass I can do what he want and you don't think that's heavy check this out the Bible says in Proverbs that is second thing God hate one of them is what a lying tongue and not lying spirit come up to God he said Lord use me gods they go in spirit prophesy why did why did God allow that lion spirit to move so he's working come to pass sometimes we wonder why things happen and why we're got this way God in control y'all ain't doing it right on me God letting it happen oh yeah you told David don't worry about it everything under control let it go in he said I let the head is his dog there's a no don't worry about everything all right you know when David died he told Solomon he said everyone to tell me about that I want you to kill honey the time gonna come but the thing over this church you want to be on the right side of influence amen we're in a time now where there's so much going on but we need to take a step back take a step back seeing what I love about Jehoshaphat once Jehoshaphat escaped she house the fans ain't no we're gonna turn this thing around we don't turn this around i hain't fellowship with him Domo let's get this together huh - faint calling Solomon seamless not a fast and pray everything turned the whole kingdom around don't be afraid to backtrack and turn things around you do matter what you've done God's grace is great I got I got I got something I like to say to myself but rich I like to say God is greater than greatness can you believe that he's greater than greatness now they say they say that uh Muhammad Ali was one of the most greatest boxers ever to live but God is great surely they say they say uh-uh Abraham Lincoln was a great president but God is great holy you say Solomon was a great man but God is great a honey the greatest thing you can think about God is greater he's greater than greatness honey things that the world may exalt God is great honey that's who we serve so let's make sure we're on the right side of influence cuz like I said not him with just you take a drunk person we all we all may have family members that go to the cookout and then cook out the real them come out and come up to you cuz they got that spirit in a system and they got courage and now they're gonna tell you how they really feel about you you think you too good I never liked him see that spirit that influence is allowing the real them to come out but with name other day influence they play it cuz how you doing good seat you need anything can I do something with all this just put on because we ain't ain't able to control their thoughts anymore the real them comes out and that's what God wants us to be he wants us to be in a place where we're not able to control our own thoughts that's the problem with church we love control and you know even in the atmosphere like just where I can feel the power of God moving y'all can feel it too but you got better control than I got nobody's everything all right but I ain't gonna shout today so I feel it enough going though I don't see enough going on you better stop being influenced by your eyes your eyes a lot to you huh I didn't oh don't trust your eyes your eyes can't see the angels in this room hallelujah your eyes can't see the divine all in this room your eyes can't see that God is in this room don't trust your eyes floors by the Word of God hosts your eyes I lied to you honey your eyes I'll make an S look like an eight don't trust your eyes you trust the Word of God let's follow them to the right influence holy and you know Church one thing I realize is that there's nothing the enemy can do honey I said again then I'll catch God by surprise you know like it like I always say here you got practical jokers you know like family members and different people you walking in the room and they jump I shake you up a little bit scare you a little bit practical jokers but you know some people when they get scared they're scared is this aggressive so why you jump out on him you find something you find something you weren't ready for and that's how it is with God in the jump you imagine Satan sneaking up on God and God just death he he's all-knowing he knows Satan every move every step he know what he gonna do before he do because God ordained it you know Satan thinks he's sneaking up on God I'm gonna miss this life up and then he jumps out thinking God ain't ready he's just like oh my gosh Wow every time and it ain't no mistake God don't miss he knows exactly how to deal with the enemy huh let's understand something God is so great he created his own enemy he knows how it takes who knows his strengths and his weaknesses hallelujah God can't even take the battery out of the devil that's not great our God is and y'all y'all want to tell me that it's not a good thing to be able to that kind of influence with a God who is all knowing hallelujah he knows our every move out every step and he's put things in position Church think about it honey before he saw and Jacob was ever born God said I love Jacob and Haiti song they hadn't done anything got it already put Jacob in the past that would favor his life even though it wasn't it didn't look politically correct look like he saw was a better man honey but Jacob has promised huh why because God had influences in his life certain things had to happen huh he had to he had to trick his daddy with a lie can you imagine God ordaining God ordaining his puppet daddy to be deceived why so he get the birth right cuz you already said that the older goes serve the younger so god I gotta let certain things take place so it's working come to pass honey oh yeah that's what happens in our life nothing happens by chance God is in control Amen this bliss let's pray let's pray I want y'all to believe that this service this service this morning it's just the beginning of what God gonna do today honey I want you to believe that we haven't even experienced the greatness of God today there's more of God to get hungry let's pray let's pray let's bow our heads let's pray Lord Jesus father we thank you we give you the honor the glory Lord and we know that your word is true don't help us to fall under the right influences and all many of us we may have done wrong we've made bad decisions but that doesn't change the seed inside so we know that you're in control oh my god we know that your righteous hand is upon our lives so father help us to let go and let God Father we pray that the Spirit of the Most High God would continuously moving this church though a god to fulfill your word in our lives though we thank you we give you honor we give you glory in the name of Jesus Christ we pray the church say Amen amen amen
