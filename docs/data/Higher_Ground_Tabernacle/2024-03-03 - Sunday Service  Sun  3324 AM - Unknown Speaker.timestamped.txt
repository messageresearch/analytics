[43:14] that then I something I felt like
[43:16] something told me to go and and the
[43:17] preacher will pray for
[43:20] you then I stood up and I I arrived here
[43:24] and I told him about my issue
[43:27] [Music]
[43:29] then he
[43:34] prayed just while he was praying I just
[43:36] felt that the pain that I was
[43:38] feeling
[43:40] left
[43:43] because those a time when I could not
[43:52] walk I I could not even walk from here
[43:55] to to to that road over

[44:02] I would stop walking because I was
[44:04] feeling I was feeling I was feeling heat
[44:07] on my leg I I I had to
[44:10] stop for like a minute and then continue
[44:15] walking and I was getting used to that
[44:18] pain
[44:20] already but when brother Jess pray I
[44:25] just felt that the pain left
[44:27] me and then I started I
[44:31] walked and I walked all the way to get

[44:36] car and then I just felt that the pain
[44:39] just left me while I was
[44:49] walking and usually you guys know I'm

[55:04] brother remove
[55:09] [Music]
[55:14] your and may God bless every one of
[55:20] you without further Ado let's open our
[55:24] Bible in Matthew chapter
[55:31] 17 let's pay attention to what we're
[55:33] going to be
[55:36] reading and start from verse
[55:41] 15 now here there's a man who's coming
[55:44] to
[55:49] see and then he
[55:53] says verse 15 okay Lord have mercy on my
[55:57] son for he is
[56:00] lunatic now just highlights the word
[56:10] Lun and also highlights this other part
[56:13] and sore vexed for often times he
[56:16] falleth Into the Fire and off into the
[56:19] water he he he suffers he suffers great
[56:30] I brought them to thy disciples and they
[56:32] could not
[56:35] curent when we're
[56:38] sick we think that prayer can remove
[56:41] that
[56:43] sickness but when prayer cannot do
[56:46] anything for
[56:48] you it means that there is a another way
[56:51] for for for that for that sickness to
[56:52] leave
[56:53] you now Jesus says let's let's hear what
[56:57] Jesus
[57:00] says he says oh oh faithless and
[57:04] perverse
[57:07] generation how long shall I be with
[57:13] you I don't know if I'm going to be
[57:16] facing such such such uh generation
[57:21] today because he's talking to his
[57:23] disciples here
[57:26] and just look how he's calling
[57:30] them and what about
[57:34] us now listen how Jesus Christ
[57:38] speaks how long shall I be with
[57:41] you all the issues happening Among
[57:44] Us
[57:48] sickness we we we're not
[57:51] Prosper go for it seems like nothing's
[57:53] working
[57:55] it's because of
[57:59] unbelief should I be with you because I
[58:01] gave you my
[58:04] word you can resolve your issues with my
[58:08] word but how long shall I be with
[58:14] you and Jesus rebuked the
[58:20] devil it was not a small and little
[58:23] prayer it was it was sever
[58:26] pray it means that those Devils
[58:31] resisted now be careful with the
[58:35] scripture and the child was Cur from
[58:37] that very
[58:41] hour
[58:43] verse then verse 19 then came the
[58:45] disciples to Jesus apart and
[58:49] said and they said why could we not cast
[58:52] him
[58:53] out
[58:56] why are you unable to cast out demons
[58:58] who are in your
[59:01] children they're watching
[59:06] pornography they're watching dirty
[59:13] things why are we not why are we why are
[59:16] we unable to cast out demons who are
[59:18] tormenting our children or our
[59:20] couples there is something
[59:23] here because we're
[59:28] Believers and the Believers have a
[59:30] different
[59:32] Lifestyle the Bible tells us
[59:39] here Jesus said unto them because of
[59:42] your
[59:43] unbelief now
[59:49] look and then the disciples came to him
[59:51] and
[59:53] he verily I say unto
[59:56] you if he have
[1:00:01] faith as a grain of mustard
[1:00:04] seed he shall say unto this
[1:00:08] mountain remove H to Y
[1:00:11] place and it it will do
[1:00:16] what it shall remove and nothing shall
[1:00:19] be impossible unto you
[1:00:22] amoss nothing shall be impossible unto
[1:00:26] you so there is a
[1:00:28] place when you read the same
[1:00:33] scripture Jesus says for this kind of
[1:00:39] demons they're only casted out when you
[1:00:42] when when you when you fast and pray
[1:00:46] amen because
[1:00:48] child the child was a lunatic
[1:00:52] same he's talking about the type
[1:00:59] those kind of demons can only be cast
[1:01:01] out when you pray and
[1:01:06] fast and the solutions to our problems
[1:01:09] resides in our prayer and our
[1:01:12] fastings church and the church today is
[1:01:15] no longer praying
[1:01:17] enough we're busy trying to find
[1:01:23] money forget that there is a dark side
[1:01:26] that's going to happen to your
[1:01:28] life and that dark place is going to
[1:01:30] happen to you and when it will reach
[1:01:35] you you you have to you have to be aware
[1:01:37] of what's going to happen to
[1:01:39] you don't just say oh God you don't love
[1:01:42] me this and that no you have to be aware
[1:01:46] of that you can you can rece you
[1:01:50] can may God add blessings to his word
[1:01:53] amen
[1:01:55] may God bless you
[1:01:57] all now we're going to talk about
[1:01:59] anointed bodies this
[1:02:01] morning anointed
[1:02:07] body no
[1:02:09] no anointed
[1:02:13] bodies anointed bodies
[1:02:18] am how are anointed
[1:02:22] bodies and who are those anointed
[1:02:28] bodies I'm going to introduce this with
[1:02:30] a little quote from the prophet in the
[1:02:31] sermon the only place of
[1:02:35] worship paragraph two French
[1:02:40] version uh uh November 28th
[1:02:43] 19 wait
[1:02:46] 1965 November 2 November 28th 1965
[1:02:51] paragraph paragraph 2 French version
[1:02:55] now let's put our foundation
[1:03:00] here says while we were singing singing
[1:03:02] and I was sitting
[1:03:07] there and I was talking to my old friend
[1:03:10] brother
[1:03:12] Brown and he
[1:03:14] said he says brother
[1:03:17] Bram until
[1:03:22] yesterday I was not understanding what
[1:03:25] you were talking
[1:03:26] about he
[1:03:32] said he says if people could penetrate
[1:03:34] could listen to what you
[1:03:36] said he
[1:03:41] said every obstacles would have been
[1:03:44] removed from their
[1:03:48] ways If people could penetrate what you
[1:03:53] say
[1:03:54] If people could understand what you say
[1:03:57] Amen because we read
[1:04:00] here until how long
[1:04:03] Jesus Jesus said I won't leave you
[1:04:06] orphans Jesus left us the Holy
[1:04:09] Ghost it's it's to lead us to guide
[1:04:14] us now are we understanding those
[1:04:17] things are we even understanding what
[1:04:20] what the message is if I ask you a
[1:04:23] question what is the m
[1:04:25] message people won't be able to
[1:04:28] answer brother gave an answer now I'm
[1:04:32] going to ask you a question all of you
[1:04:34] this
[1:04:37] morning tell me what is the
[1:04:49] message brother defined what is the
[1:04:53] message what is the
[1:04:56] message I'm in the message but what is
[1:05:00] the message what is the
[1:05:04] message we always talk where in the
[1:05:07] message in the message what is the
[1:05:10] message
[1:05:12] brother and he said the
[1:05:15] message is when the Holy
[1:05:17] Ghost takes the word of
[1:05:20] God and interprets that word in your
[1:05:23] heart
[1:05:26] amen it's when the Holy
[1:05:29] Ghost takes the word of
[1:05:32] God and interprets that word for you in
[1:05:35] your heart because as we were here we
[1:05:38] are
[1:05:40] different we are two groups
[1:05:42] here we have two
[1:05:44] races there is a race of God and there's
[1:05:48] the race of the ser and the two
[1:05:51] SE can never cross each other that's
[1:05:55] right
[1:05:59] Amen
[1:06:02] brother he asked if people could
[1:06:06] understand could understand what you
[1:06:10] say all
[1:06:13] obstacles would have been
[1:06:15] removed now brother Bram says one thing
[1:06:21] here in sermon don't lean on to your own
[1:06:23] understanding
[1:06:25] PR January
[1:06:27] 2th paragraph
[1:06:30] 18 some
[1:06:34] people he says some people will never be
[1:06:39] quickened see he says some
[1:06:43] people will never be
[1:06:46] quickened you can preach the
[1:06:50] word those people will always remain the
[1:06:53] same
[1:06:55] so don't worry about those people
[1:06:57] because this
[1:07:00] morning this morning I'm talking about
[1:07:02] people who are going to be brother
[1:07:08] says he says it's just not in
[1:07:12] them he says
[1:07:16] period he says
[1:07:19] it's is that as if you put
[1:07:21] a a corn
[1:07:24] a seed of
[1:07:26] corn and that seed of corn
[1:07:29] never he says if you take an
[1:07:32] egg the Egg of of a
[1:07:35] chicken and you put it under a
[1:07:38] dog it it will it will it will uh uh it
[1:07:41] will open
[1:07:44] up it's because of the heat that's right
[1:07:47] amen the
[1:07:49] life is not in the
[1:07:52] dog but life
[1:07:54] is in that EG brother says there are
[1:07:59] eggs that don't have but they are also
[1:08:02] eggs they're good but they don't have
[1:08:06] life but other eggs they have life a
[1:08:12] Believer without the Holy Ghost is not a
[1:08:15] son of
[1:08:18] God they're
[1:08:19] eggs they're eggs without
[1:08:22] life
[1:08:24] so as we put our
[1:08:27] foundation let's go in the message
[1:08:31] attitudes brother Bram says paragraph
[1:08:36] 20 every spirit that fights the word of
[1:08:41] God is a is a is an unbelieving
[1:08:44] spirit that does not love the
[1:08:47] Brethren I'm going to repeat it every
[1:08:52] spirit fights against the word of
[1:09:00] God the spirit of the
[1:09:04] devil that does not love the
[1:09:08] Brethren every
[1:09:10] man without Christ is a
[1:09:14] sinner you are an unbeliever you are a
[1:09:17] lost
[1:09:19] man you're on your way to
[1:09:21] heaven but when Calvary
[1:09:25] get on your
[1:09:27] way when it gets on your
[1:09:30] way your destination Chang brother
[1:09:35] says if you were a child of God in
[1:09:38] heaven that you arve here on
[1:09:41] Earth you become even a prostitute or
[1:09:45] whatever but because you were a child of
[1:09:47] God in
[1:09:48] heaven before leaving this
[1:09:51] Earth You will become what you were
[1:09:55] [Applause]
[1:10:01] before since have it don't worry about
[1:10:07] anything the condition of your life on
[1:10:10] Earth does not change your
[1:10:14] destination the the thief on the
[1:10:18] cross was condemned by
[1:10:20] Society they were he was forsaken by all
[1:10:24] but he didn't
[1:10:25] know that he was a Son of God brother
[1:10:31] says he says watch the person that's
[1:10:33] sitting next to you if you don't see
[1:10:36] Jesus in that
[1:10:37] person look
[1:10:40] again if you don't see Jesus in that
[1:10:43] person there is something bad in
[1:10:48] you because you don't know who's the son
[1:10:50] of
[1:10:52] God no man
[1:10:54] man can know
[1:10:57] God from his five
[1:11:00] senses your five
[1:11:03] senses that's in the greatest
[1:11:05] battle they were given to
[1:11:08] us just so we could contact each
[1:11:11] other when did God act in us God worked
[1:11:14] in
[1:11:15] us when the five the five senses are
[1:11:19] sleeping the subconscious is AC that's
[1:11:23] why
[1:11:26] brother I have with
[1:11:29] me I have with me I have a knife with me
[1:11:32] all the time often
[1:11:34] times brother says but
[1:11:37] today he says he left the knife
[1:11:41] and he says but if I
[1:11:45] say I want that knife to be in my suit
[1:11:48] right now I will have the knife with
[1:11:52] me
[1:11:54] that's the faith I'm I'm going to talk
[1:11:55] to you
[1:11:57] about it's not an imag imag Faith
[1:12:04] IM because R says 80% of people talk
[1:12:07] about faith but they don't have
[1:12:09] faith now brother says this there are
[1:12:13] two
[1:12:15] things that make that a church does not
[1:12:18] Prosper the
[1:12:22] first
[1:12:24] is that there is not enough rejoicing
[1:12:26] when the word of God is
[1:12:30] preached there is not enough rejoicing
[1:12:32] when the word of God is
[1:12:34] preached I'm going to tell you what
[1:12:39] rejoicing look when when the when the
[1:12:41] the cup of
[1:12:44] AFC some Africans did not come to
[1:12:48] church because they were rejoicing in
[1:12:51] the soccer
[1:12:52] games
[1:12:54] because they wanted to see who was going
[1:12:55] to
[1:12:57] win and when a person is watching those
[1:12:59] soccer games when he's a
[1:13:01] [Applause]
[1:13:03] sport he's rejoicing in his spirits for
[1:13:06] that for
[1:13:07] that and he can
[1:13:09] shout he can do
[1:13:13] things and they never sleep when a
[1:13:15] penalty is about
[1:13:17] to and when it's about his country
[1:13:20] that's that man cannot sleep
[1:13:24] but he's not
[1:13:25] rejoicing in church here he's sleeping
[1:13:29] when he comes to church he sleep but
[1:13:31] when he's watching soccer he never
[1:13:34] sleeps this is that's what it means
[1:13:38] that's what it means we being
[1:13:42] rej say the church does not go
[1:13:45] forward because the church is not
[1:13:47] rejoicing when the word of God is
[1:13:50] [Applause]
[1:13:52] preached if you see that one we preach
[1:13:54] the word and you see that someone's
[1:13:57] always like this it means that that
[1:14:02] person in
[1:14:03] heaven that person was also just like
[1:14:06] that because we all come from Heaven if
[1:14:09] you were dancing in heaven if you were
[1:14:11] saying Amen in heaven you're going to
[1:14:13] say Amen here you're going to dance here
[1:14:16] as if you were not saying amen there if
[1:14:19] you were not dancing there you're not
[1:14:21] going to say Amen here you're not going
[1:14:23] Dan
[1:14:24] [Applause]
[1:14:27] here second
[1:14:31] thing people don't know who God
[1:14:37] is people just don't know who God
[1:14:40] is if I ask you a question who is
[1:14:44] God oh God is the best no no no I just
[1:14:48] asked you a question who is
[1:14:50] God tell me who's God this morning
[1:14:55] respond to me who is God this
[1:14:57] morning people don't know who God is
[1:15:00] they're just imagining who God
[1:15:02] is they see
[1:15:05] Jesus they see Jesus like that like
[1:15:09] this and they're imagining oh Jesus oh
[1:15:14] Jesus I want to pray
[1:15:17] Jesus imagine
[1:15:19] Jesus one imagine Jesus with hair down
[1:15:22] here
[1:15:24] but don't imagine Jesus Jesus is his
[1:15:27] word amen Amen brother
[1:15:33] says if you were part of the word in the
[1:15:37] beginning and did you get on this
[1:15:40] Earth if God is not looking for you it
[1:15:44] will be
[1:15:46] incomplete God is complete with you
[1:15:50] without you God is not complete
[1:15:54] Can someone say glory be to
[1:15:55] [Applause]
[1:15:58] God let's talk about anointing anointed
[1:16:01] body let's get an example of an anointed
[1:16:05] body because I want you to Rejoice now
[1:16:07] that's right anointed bodies let's just
[1:16:11] say for example
[1:16:13] Jesus he was an anointed
[1:16:15] body
[1:16:18] Jesus
[1:16:19] Moses he was an anointed body when he
[1:16:23] was born brother
[1:16:27] says God put 10,000
[1:16:31] angels in in the in the the river in the
[1:16:34] N
[1:16:36] River to control
[1:16:40] Moses when the crocodiles were
[1:16:44] coming and the angels could tell the
[1:16:46] crocodiles to go why because
[1:16:50] Moses was an anointed body
[1:16:54] so I get let's take Jesus for an example
[1:16:57] I take Jesus Jesus was also an anointed
[1:17:01] body he could take
[1:17:05] water and make it
[1:17:08] wine
[1:17:12] Jesus went on the other side of the of
[1:17:14] the sea it was at night time and he
[1:17:18] tells his disciples go
[1:17:21] home take your your
[1:17:24] transportations the last the last
[1:17:27] transportations and I'm come and I I
[1:17:29] I'll come I'll come to you how was he
[1:17:31] going to come to them he was an anointed
[1:17:35] body
[1:17:37] Jesus got in the Tomb he was an anointed
[1:17:42] body he resurrected from the tomb an
[1:17:46] anointed
[1:17:48] body I'm not talking about just
[1:17:51] Jesus now I'm talking about brother BR
[1:17:54] brother says this that one
[1:17:57] day he went he went to
[1:18:00] Illinois he got into a
[1:18:03] room and sick people were standing
[1:18:08] brother his presence in the
[1:18:12] room simply his presence in the
[1:18:15] room made that all the sick people were
[1:18:17] healed
[1:18:19] why because God
[1:18:21] said go to
[1:18:23] world and preach the good
[1:18:26] news the one who believes and who will
[1:18:29] be baptized will be
[1:18:32] saved this is the sign that will
[1:18:37] follow those who will believe
[1:18:43] those only for those an anointed
[1:18:46] bodies in my
[1:18:49] name they lay their hands on the sick
[1:18:53] and
[1:18:53] and it's not you that's healing but it's
[1:18:57] Jesus
[1:18:58] Christ through the anointed
[1:19:00] body even a
[1:19:02] sister can lay her hands on someone and
[1:19:06] the baby will be healed even the
[1:19:09] brother even if he's not a even if he's
[1:19:13] not a
[1:19:14] treasur if he takes the name of
[1:19:16] Jesus as a child of God and lay his
[1:19:20] hands the sick will be healed
[1:19:23] why because it's a
[1:19:27] promise I will send to you pray for the
[1:19:30] sick and the sick will be
[1:19:33] healed we are those anointed
[1:19:36] B now they ask brother Bram a
[1:19:39] question who is an anointed
[1:19:43] body and who are the anointed
[1:19:46] bodies who is the anointed body Jesus is
[1:19:50] the anointed body Who are the
[1:19:54] ano it's the mystical body of Believers
[1:19:57] the Believers comp are
[1:20:01] composed they compose the mystical body
[1:20:04] of the Lord Jesus Christ now the
[1:20:09] church they need to reach the level of
[1:20:12] Jesus
[1:20:13] Christ if there is a a paralytic he
[1:20:16] needs to walk if there is a
[1:20:21] problem is it that the church is not
[1:20:24] able to perform Miracles
[1:20:26] anymore it's because the church
[1:20:30] today is is dwelt the the church today
[1:20:34] is dwelt by is dwelt by by demon
[1:20:39] demons demons are in the in the church
[1:20:41] is in the church today how did those
[1:20:44] demons get in let's see
[1:20:47] this now let's go
[1:20:49] forward brother Brown
[1:20:51] says
[1:20:53] to stimulate a
[1:20:54] [Music]
[1:20:57] Believer God sent preachers
[1:21:00] amen Pastor Isaiah
[1:21:04] Brooks is one of the
[1:21:08] Believers who have the task of
[1:21:10] stimulating youra you in this place you
[1:21:13] have a
[1:21:14] place if you lost your if you lost your
[1:21:18] faith come listen to the word of God and
[1:21:22] you will be
[1:21:24] reestablished the devil
[1:21:26] also has his
[1:21:29] agents to remove Faith from your
[1:21:32] heart
[1:21:34] true God is
[1:21:37] Believers God has
[1:21:39] people to stimulate your
[1:21:42] faith brother Bram
[1:21:46] says when you doubt the word of
[1:21:49] God doubting the word of God brings TR
[1:21:52] three
[1:21:55] because no one can know God through your
[1:21:57] five
[1:21:58] senses your body
[1:22:01] your let's leave those five
[1:22:04] senses sense of your
[1:22:08] spirit do you know why the Bible says
[1:22:10] blessed is are the poor the the the the
[1:22:13] the the the poor in
[1:22:16] spirit because they will inherit the
[1:22:18] kingdom of
[1:22:19] God poor in spirits what does it mean
[1:22:25] now spirit is written with
[1:22:27] with
[1:22:32] lower because when the Bible says walk
[1:22:34] in the spirit it's upper ass it's God
[1:22:40] Amen now the man the man has three
[1:22:46] dimensions every man here whether you're
[1:22:49] Pagan or
[1:22:50] Christian they have the spirit of God
[1:22:55] I'm not talking about the Holy
[1:22:56] Ghost because the spirit is
[1:22:59] life every life on Earth whether they're
[1:23:03] animals whether
[1:23:05] they're from botony they come from God
[1:23:09] Amen that's for this
[1:23:11] body now
[1:23:14] us God promised to us the Holy
[1:23:19] Spirit if we walk in our human spirit
[1:23:23] brother says we're sinners in in it
[1:23:27] we're Sinners on our way to
[1:23:29] Hell only thing that changes our
[1:23:32] destination is when the Holy Ghost gets
[1:23:35] in
[1:23:36] us our destination changes that now
[1:23:41] let's take the
[1:23:42] spirit the spirit has five senses
[1:23:48] imagination
[1:23:51] reason
[1:23:56] feelings now you see a lot of people
[1:23:58] among us they have
[1:24:01] feelings instead of walking with the
[1:24:03] Holy Ghost you walk with your
[1:24:06] feelings the feelings of our
[1:24:09] country no we're not from this
[1:24:13] country we are from
[1:24:15] Heaven we're out from from
[1:24:18] above we walk like
[1:24:21] Jesus we talk like
[1:24:24] Jesus the talking of
[1:24:29] Jesus is it is a talking that talks in
[1:24:32] favor of the
[1:24:33] sinner when you see a
[1:24:36] sinner don't make yourself too
[1:24:40] holy no you have your mistakes
[1:24:43] too no one caught you in your mistakes
[1:24:47] but you're a
[1:24:49] hypocrite when you want to talk about
[1:24:51] somebody
[1:24:53] now you also have your own
[1:24:56] mistakes start fighting with your own
[1:24:59] mistakes first
[1:25:01] say help me
[1:25:05] fight because the the journey is
[1:25:09] hard Paul says I
[1:25:12] fight so I so
[1:25:14] I so I don't I don't lose my crown amen
[1:25:18] amen amen IM imagination
[1:25:24] okay now let's take
[1:25:27] imagination we are the
[1:25:30] church and I'm going to get into the
[1:25:32] feelings as
[1:25:34] well because when when it's about when
[1:25:37] it's about a family issue we defend the
[1:25:40] family no no no no no oh no this is our
[1:25:43] family this is our
[1:25:45] family but in Christ there is not that
[1:25:47] kind
[1:25:48] of it's the same principles that you
[1:25:50] apply for everyone in Christ because we
[1:25:52] are the mystical Body of
[1:25:54] Christ you are
[1:25:58] disqualified the five senses of the the
[1:26:00] human
[1:26:02] Spirit blessed is the poor in
[1:26:05] spirit be poor in your
[1:26:08] feelings poor in
[1:26:11] imagination be poor in having in in
[1:26:14] being
[1:26:15] right Some People Want to Be Right In
[1:26:19] Everything Jesus said blessed is the
[1:26:21] poor in
[1:26:23] spirit you want to be right then be
[1:26:27] right I'm wrong brother says even when
[1:26:31] you're right and you see that he wants
[1:26:34] to be right you say my brother be right
[1:26:37] and I'll be
[1:26:38] [Applause]
[1:26:40] wrong that's the language of
[1:26:43] God every other
[1:26:46] language against this it's not God it's
[1:26:50] the
[1:26:51] devil
[1:26:57] let's take for example
[1:26:59] imagin Jesus left us a
[1:27:03] cup to take
[1:27:07] wine now what did people do to
[1:27:11] us they say oh on use the same
[1:27:16] cup I'm not going to drink the saliva of
[1:27:18] somebody
[1:27:20] else the one person use one cup you use
[1:27:24] the same cup and you
[1:27:26] drink that's why you're still
[1:27:29] sick you know why because
[1:27:33] Jesus served with the same C and in his
[1:27:37] words there is
[1:27:39] power that heals your
[1:27:43] body when you apply the
[1:27:45] word when you don't
[1:27:47] think you you apply the Divine
[1:27:50] principles God also comes down where you
[1:27:54] were sick and he heals you where you had
[1:27:58] issues where you had difficulty God will
[1:28:02] give you
[1:28:05] solution what do we
[1:28:07] do in communion we're going to use those
[1:28:10] little
[1:28:11] Cops where did you see
[1:28:13] those men introduced those C because
[1:28:17] Jesus says let's take this one it was
[1:28:20] one C
[1:28:23] they were not little cups like that now
[1:28:26] myen go back to the word second
[1:28:30] thing be poor
[1:28:33] in poor in
[1:28:35] reason reason the word of God believe
[1:28:40] the word of
[1:28:44] God second
[1:28:47] thing in the
[1:28:50] reasonings now look when there one is
[1:28:52] the washing of the
[1:28:55] feet people according to their
[1:28:59] feelings they only choose their friends
[1:29:01] to wash their
[1:29:07] feet in that states you are one
[1:29:09] kilometer away from the kingdom of God
[1:29:12] if God
[1:29:14] Jesus
[1:29:17] God who's greater than Joe
[1:29:20] Biden
[1:29:22] [Music]
[1:29:23] can wash the
[1:29:25] feet of
[1:29:30] Peter a
[1:29:33] Fisher even Peter said no don't wash my
[1:29:36] feet you're this great you can't do this
[1:29:38] to me he told him you have to do this
[1:29:42] and
[1:29:44] us when we look at
[1:29:46] someone with with a wound on on his on
[1:29:50] an injury on his on his
[1:29:54] toes he has an injury on his
[1:29:57] toes if if he put his feet in the water
[1:30:01] brother if it was you you would have
[1:30:03] said oh
[1:30:05] brother I'm going to leave there I'm not
[1:30:08] brother oh brother
[1:30:10] brother can I
[1:30:13] preach can I
[1:30:15] preach no no no brother oh no brother
[1:30:19] um because in this
[1:30:24] for this brother
[1:30:27] brother but Jesus said that he's there
[1:30:30] to heal us but
[1:30:34] us we're not rejoicing enough in the
[1:30:38] spirit because when we watch soccer
[1:30:42] soccer you don't even know where this
[1:30:44] this drink come from you don't even know
[1:30:46] who drank it it went through the mouth
[1:30:49] of went through the mouth of out there
[1:30:52] rejoicing and then you're drinking out
[1:30:55] there you're so
[1:30:58] rejoicing you should have been rejoicing
[1:31:00] the same way when you listen to the word
[1:31:03] of God and you're going to
[1:31:05] prosper the fact that we
[1:31:09] refuse to fulfill the word of God that's
[1:31:12] why we have those many
[1:31:15] issues we cannot go
[1:31:18] forward if we continue to act this way
[1:31:22] believe the word of God with all your
[1:31:25] hearts I have to go
[1:31:27] forward to
[1:31:30] finish when you doubt the word of God
[1:31:32] doubting the word of God how did you
[1:31:36] doubt in the communion you didn't drink
[1:31:39] with the same
[1:31:41] cup you didn't wash your feet with the
[1:31:44] one who's
[1:31:45] sick doubting the word of
[1:31:49] God brings darkness in in your
[1:31:52] soul one
[1:31:57] secondarily the deity leades
[1:32:00] you because when God
[1:32:03] created in the sermon the
[1:32:06] Messiah God placed in the heart of
[1:32:10] man a little white
[1:32:13] light that's that lights that
[1:32:16] quickens it's that lights that
[1:32:18] quick if you're
[1:32:20] born with that little light you are you
[1:32:24] are you are good but if you're born
[1:32:27] without that light you're never going to
[1:32:30] understand what I'm talking about
[1:32:32] this is for
[1:32:35] people who are born with that lights in
[1:32:38] their
[1:32:44] souls it leaves a de in your
[1:32:48] heart
[1:32:50] third
[1:32:53] the devil will put his dwelling in your
[1:32:56] soul when you doubt the
[1:32:58] work I'm going to talk to
[1:33:02] people I'm going to talk to people who
[1:33:04] have the Throne of the devil in their
[1:33:07] souls and this morning I'm talking to
[1:33:12] them because we're talking about
[1:33:14] anointed you have to cast out the
[1:33:17] devil because in the
[1:33:19] heart where the serpent dwells there's
[1:33:22] either the serpent or the dog that's
[1:33:24] right amen it's either the
[1:33:27] two the two cannot
[1:33:30] cannot because the the serpent will try
[1:33:33] to eat the
[1:33:35] Dove and that Dove is
[1:33:38] Supernatural it's going to it's going to
[1:33:40] burn the
[1:33:42] Ser now they cannot live they cannot
[1:33:46] coexist now in your
[1:33:48] body you either accept God or the serp
[1:33:53] this
[1:33:53] world is led by two the devil leads and
[1:34:00] he has influence on the lives of people
[1:34:03] a group of
[1:34:05] people a group of people are led by the
[1:34:07] devil and another group of
[1:34:10] people composed of anointed bodies they
[1:34:14] are led by Life by the
[1:34:17] heavens if you have God in you it's a
[1:34:20] great blessing
[1:34:26] says in
[1:34:30] demies uh 12th November 1953 now that
[1:34:33] we're
[1:34:34] getting now we're getting in
[1:34:39] this paragraph
[1:34:43] 14 the greatest
[1:34:46] demon is
[1:34:49] [Music]
[1:34:50] unbelief demon the greatest
[1:34:54] demon it's not the greatest Witch of
[1:34:57] Africa
[1:35:00] no the greatest
[1:35:03] demon is not the biggest Witch of of
[1:35:07] India neither of the biggest Witch of of
[1:35:11] America the greatest
[1:35:14] demon according to
[1:35:17] brother is
[1:35:20] unbelief
[1:35:22] when you have
[1:35:24] unbelief it removes
[1:35:27] in
[1:35:30] De it brings
[1:35:33] demons it makes demons to dwell in your
[1:35:38] body and your soul becomes
[1:35:41] dark paragraph three of the same
[1:35:43] sermon in the same
[1:35:47] sermon November 20th
[1:35:50] 19
[1:35:53] now after making a great
[1:35:56] statement I'm going to tell you
[1:35:58] something I've never said in my
[1:36:01] life that I've never said in
[1:36:05] public of what I
[1:36:10] know less to that was under the the
[1:36:14] spirit in a
[1:36:16] moment in
[1:36:20] fact
[1:36:22] I do some some things without even
[1:36:24] knowing what I'm
[1:36:25] doing when you're rejoiced in the spirit
[1:36:28] you do things and you don't even know
[1:36:31] what you're
[1:36:34] doing you're going to see your wife
[1:36:36] start speaking in
[1:36:37] Tong and then you came here as a as as
[1:36:40] an intellectual
[1:36:42] person you see the power of God fall
[1:36:45] fall falling down your wife and she
[1:36:47] start rolling on the
[1:36:49] floor and then you're just out there now
[1:36:53] when the Holy Spirit comes down you
[1:36:55] don't know what he's going to
[1:36:57] do for many times on the
[1:37:01] pulpit now this is where my I took my
[1:37:03] message
[1:37:05] from brother says many times on the
[1:37:07] pulpit I see the spirit that leavs one
[1:37:11] person there he is in all kinds of
[1:37:15] states the same way that the holy the
[1:37:18] spirit
[1:37:19] shakes demons also
[1:37:23] also catch people in the
[1:37:26] church now be careful when the word of
[1:37:28] God is
[1:37:30] preached you can be an accumulation of
[1:37:35] clouds instead of being an accumulation
[1:37:38] of the
[1:37:40] CL there is a difference between the
[1:37:43] clouds and and the
[1:37:47] CL the devil walks through dark clouds
[1:37:51] and
[1:37:52] God walks with
[1:37:58] the the wings of
[1:38:02] God is the the
[1:38:05] clown brother
[1:38:09] says the spirit leaves one
[1:38:13] person I'm I'm get the book ready about
[1:38:17] demonology if what I know myself
[1:38:24] because he says he personally worked
[1:38:27] with with those demons brother
[1:38:30] says he worked
[1:38:33] personally with those
[1:38:37] demons
[1:38:40] Jesus worked personally with people that
[1:38:43] had those
[1:38:44] demons not with people with demons he
[1:38:47] worked personally with those
[1:38:50] demons
[1:38:53] Jesus worked
[1:38:55] personally with those
[1:38:58] demons even the demons
[1:39:01] themselves because some people say when
[1:39:03] I
[1:39:04] pray God always answers my answer my
[1:39:06] prayers everything I've asked the Lord
[1:39:09] God has given it to
[1:39:11] me God also answers the Demon's
[1:39:15] prayers even when the demons kneel down
[1:39:19] and they ask God also gives to the
[1:39:22] when demons
[1:39:23] pray demons said demons the demons asked
[1:39:27] God to give them to give them
[1:39:30] job said give me job it's my
[1:39:34] prayer the demons can also ask about you
[1:39:38] amen they also
[1:39:40] pray and God said amen take him but not
[1:39:44] his
[1:39:45] [Music]
[1:39:47] soul so God gives the limits to Satan
[1:39:52] amen now brother
[1:39:55] says when demons get and enter a
[1:39:59] person or when a demon leaves a
[1:40:02] person they they come out in the form of
[1:40:06] clouds now while brother is
[1:40:09] here he's he's seeing a a a being that
[1:40:15] rises and they leave a person in the
[1:40:18] form of a of a
[1:40:19] dark
[1:40:23] Shadow brother says they look they
[1:40:26] resemble to each
[1:40:28] other they they look like they look like
[1:40:32] bats now I want to tell
[1:40:35] you if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:40:39] this is what's in you
[1:40:43] amen as simple as I can tell
[1:40:47] you that's what makes that's what makes
[1:40:50] you it makes that you don't have
[1:40:51] strength to
[1:40:53] pray you don't have the strength the
[1:40:55] strength to
[1:40:59] eat to eat you have all that
[1:41:02] strength that's for this
[1:41:04] body there is a strength to e to to
[1:41:08] break all those to drink drink that
[1:41:12] water but for your soul to eat you don't
[1:41:16] have that
[1:41:17] strength this is the
[1:41:19] guilty
[1:41:23] demons I saw them in the form of
[1:41:26] bats I saw
[1:41:28] them they look like like some of them
[1:41:31] some of them look
[1:41:33] like for about this
[1:41:36] length they have long
[1:41:38] hair that that
[1:41:40] go they they go all the way down here I
[1:41:43] saw them I saw
[1:41:46] them some of them look like
[1:41:49] turtles or those big big
[1:41:52] spiders those spiders that
[1:41:54] weigh those spiders those spiders that
[1:41:57] weigh 22
[1:41:59] kilog
[1:42:01] brother was
[1:42:04] able it was able to toit to put us on
[1:42:07] the weight to put to wait on the demons
[1:42:10] the waights on the demons that live in
[1:42:12] you because we read the
[1:42:16] scriptures that young man who
[1:42:18] had epilepsy who was
[1:42:22] who was falling in the
[1:42:26] fire now some people other people didn't
[1:42:29] understand what it was but brother Bram
[1:42:33] understood and he
[1:42:35] gave and he gave the names of
[1:42:38] those you know that our Christian
[1:42:41] life is a
[1:42:44] journey and right
[1:42:45] here it's it's a whole case for for a
[1:42:49] journey Aman lines with American
[1:42:53] Airlines how much does your
[1:42:56] case they they usually recommend 23
[1:43:00] kg that for your
[1:43:01] suitcase that's the suitcase that's the
[1:43:07] kilogram so when a person is has demons
[1:43:11] in he has those kill he weighs
[1:43:14] those he has
[1:43:17] 22.6 about 23 kg of those demon in
[1:43:22] some have the form
[1:43:25] of now you as
[1:43:27] Christians if we
[1:43:30] come they say oh this sister is
[1:43:33] sick we're going to pray for
[1:43:37] her the the doctors diagnosed
[1:43:41] cancer now you as
[1:43:43] Christians according to
[1:43:47] demonology brother saw spiders
[1:43:52] amen he
[1:43:54] saw
[1:43:57] epilepsy what what shape
[1:44:02] does it's a demon that has the shape of
[1:44:04] a
[1:44:06] turtle so when you cast out a demon
[1:44:09] of it's the most complicated demon on
[1:44:11] Earth because
[1:44:14] Darwin to declare the law of
[1:44:19] selectivity he went to
[1:44:22] Equador to study turtles
[1:44:27] amen and the
[1:44:31] turtle is the strongest of all those
[1:44:35] demons it's the
[1:44:38] demon the shadow of the turtle that's
[1:44:41] what epilepsy is if we tell you that
[1:44:45] this child is falling this brother is
[1:44:47] falling he has epil he has this thing
[1:44:50] you as a Christian you see you already
[1:44:54] see the demon and you can you can say
[1:44:57] you demon of
[1:45:01] epilepsy with a shape of a turtle I tell
[1:45:05] you in the name of Jesus Christ leave
[1:45:08] this
[1:45:08] [Applause]
[1:45:10] body because you cannot leave a person
[1:45:14] you cannot leave a a that demon cannot
[1:45:17] leave until
[1:45:18] you you have to know those demon
[1:45:21] to cast them
[1:45:22] out you have to know how they how how
[1:45:25] they
[1:45:26] are I'm going to say something I'm going
[1:45:28] to say something
[1:45:30] about said I saw something move over the
[1:45:35] assistant I saw some the some of
[1:45:43] them when the assembly was in one ACC
[1:45:46] now brother says this is the first
[1:45:49] part
[1:45:51] when the assembly is not in one Accord
[1:45:53] he could see those demons lead those
[1:45:55] people those Shadows that were getting
[1:45:57] into people but
[1:45:59] now when the
[1:46:02] assembly I saw I saw
[1:46:05] them I those thing move over the
[1:46:08] assistance I saw it
[1:46:11] sometimes when the assembly was in one
[1:46:14] Accord
[1:46:17] now it's the Believers themselves in the
[1:46:21] assembly they can see demons
[1:46:26] themselves because you are an anointed
[1:46:29] body demons cannot come here
[1:46:33] until see L that you
[1:46:36] know because God gave us power to cast
[1:46:39] out
[1:46:40] demons when you're anointed of the Holy
[1:46:43] Ghost you in one Accord in that
[1:46:47] moment you're also going to see those
[1:46:49] demons
[1:46:50] you're going to see sometimes the
[1:46:52] light sometimes the pastor is preaching
[1:46:54] here there's someone there he says

[1:47:22] here some people come to look for
[1:47:26] friendships some people come to look for
[1:47:29] jobs and some people come to look for
