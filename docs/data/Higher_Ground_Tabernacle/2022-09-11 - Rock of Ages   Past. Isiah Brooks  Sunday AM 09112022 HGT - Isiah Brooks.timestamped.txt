[1:04:42] stubbornness it seems like that did you
[1:04:44] test don't dissolve that to hold a spot
[1:04:50] it turns you around 180 degrees so if

[1:16:33] up
[1:16:38] i liked what brother keith said
[1:16:42] about that alligator
[1:16:45] and he had no idea of what
[1:16:48] uh what he was saying other than
[1:16:50] testifying
[1:16:56] but i know that in your spirit
[1:17:00] if you're not
[1:17:09] someone who
[1:17:11] breaks up brotherhood
[1:17:14] and
[1:17:29] and our righteousness has come by way of
[1:17:31] him
[1:17:34] amen and i thank god for that
[1:17:37] the bible said contain for the faith
[1:17:41] that means we're supposed to fight for
[1:17:42] it
[1:17:56] you can let the battle overtake you
[1:17:59] or you can overtake the battle
[1:18:02] as we preach not long ago
[1:18:06] when david saw the giant
[1:18:09] when he heard the boasting of goliath
[1:18:15] he took the battle to the giants
[1:18:19] we as christian we don't run from a
[1:18:21] battle
[1:18:24] i don't run from
[1:18:36] and if you stand with the words
[1:18:38] the word will
[1:18:52] places
[1:19:01] there's already 10 minutes of six
[1:19:04] minutes to eleven
[1:19:06] uh
[1:19:19] all right
[1:19:20] as we stand let us turn to
[1:19:23] matthew the tenth chapter
[1:19:28] one service on service
[1:19:33] the next time we have communion
[1:19:37] i might keep you after 12.
[1:19:41] so we can have communion
[1:19:45] because some of you all don't know what
[1:19:47] communion is okay so thank
[1:20:00] hey man
[1:20:02] did you hear that brother keith this was
[1:20:04] that was oh was that you and somebody
[1:20:05] else
[1:20:08] by the grace of god i didn't hear a lot
[1:20:09] of amen
[1:20:12] you know one thing about communion what
[1:20:13] it does
[1:20:16] it helps you clean yourself cleanse
[1:20:18] yourself
[1:20:20] you're damned if you do
[1:20:22] without making it right
[1:20:27] and you're damned if you don't
[1:20:31] do people understand what communion is
[1:20:34] when you are afraid of communion
[1:20:37] when you don't come to communion
[1:20:39] you're literally declaring that you are
[1:20:41] not a christian
[1:20:45] you're telling me you're living your two
[1:20:46] two lives
[1:20:49] or three lives
[1:20:51] maybe four
[1:20:54] but we know it's not just one
[1:20:57] you love the lord
[1:20:59] amen
[1:21:00] as we stand let us turn to matthew 10.

[1:21:13] starting at the thirty-fourth verse from
[1:21:14] zone matthew's the tenth chapter

[1:21:25] it is my bread see
[1:21:34] starting at the 34th verse of the 10th
[1:21:36] chapter
[1:21:41] think not
[1:21:42] that i am come to send peace on earth
[1:21:46] i came not to send peace
[1:21:50] but a sword
[1:21:57] for i am come to set a man at variance
[1:22:00] against his father
[1:22:02] and the daughter against her mother
[1:22:05] and the daughter-in-law against her
[1:22:07] mother-in-law god
[1:22:09] [Music]
[1:22:25] he that loveth father or mother more
[1:22:28] than me
[1:22:29] is not worthy of me
[1:22:31] and he that loveth son or daughter more
[1:22:34] than me is not worthy of me
[1:22:44] and he that taketh not his cross
[1:22:48] and follow after me is not worthy of me
[1:22:59] he that finds his life shall lose it
[1:23:03] and he that loses his life for
[1:23:14] matthew 16 matrices says
[1:23:21] we'll read the 18th and the 19th verse
[1:23:24] of matthew 16.
[1:23:31] and i say also unto thee
[1:23:34] that thou art peter
[1:23:36] and upon this rock i will build my
[1:23:38] church
[1:23:40] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:23:42] against it
[1:23:53] and i will give unto thee the keys
[1:23:56] of the kingdom of heaven
[1:23:58] and whatsoever thou shall bind on earth
[1:24:01] shall be bound in heaven
[1:24:03] and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[1:24:06] shall be loosed in heaven
[1:24:09] [Music]
[1:24:27] in abundance in grace
[1:24:30] the glass lord we pray this morning
[1:24:34] that you look beyond our faults
[1:24:40] lord we commit the service into your
[1:24:42] hands
[1:24:58] but our enemy is the adversary
[1:25:02] i pray father god
[1:25:04] this morning lord
[1:25:06] they'll reach down that you would reach
[1:25:08] down did you please fulfill this take
[1:25:24] that we are
[1:25:51] jesus christ's name
[1:26:12] you and i must understand who's the one
[1:26:15] component that we're living in a
[1:26:16] dangerous time
[1:26:19] we're at a time in history
[1:26:23] where men hate each other
[1:26:27] without a call
[1:26:30] uh we know by god's grace
[1:26:34] that satan always know how to divide
[1:26:39] but this is not a time of division
[1:26:43] this is a time of union
[1:26:46] the only way that we'll be able to
[1:26:48] understand
[1:27:16] i can wash
[1:27:30] and god put that heart in there he
[1:27:32] dropped the sister girl because he
[1:27:34] wanted it to be his personal job
[1:27:39] you and i must realize
[1:27:41] that we're living at a time
[1:27:44] where the deception of the devil is
[1:27:46] greater now than ever
[1:27:50] i could really tell you some stories
[1:27:53] where people were being led by the devil
[1:27:56] and they thought they were being led by
[1:27:58] god
[1:28:00] but thank god for the revelation
[1:28:04] of this message message i was thinking
[1:28:07] about the church the other day
[1:28:10] and i was thinking about uh i was
[1:28:12] thinking on behalf of all the people
[1:28:14] here
[1:28:16] and i was wondering
[1:28:18] how many people
[1:28:20] in this church
[1:28:22] really knows jesus christ
[1:28:25] as your personal savior
[1:28:34] [Music]
[1:28:43] [Applause]
[1:28:55] a wolf with sheep clothing
[1:29:00] you are identifiable
[1:29:04] by your character
[1:29:07] hallelujah
[1:29:08] this is the age of the capstone
[1:29:12] of the faith this is the age of divine
[1:29:14] love
[1:29:16] this is the age that god see
[1:29:19] it's uncovering the devil's tactics
[1:29:22] hallelujah
[1:29:47] [Applause]
[1:29:48] when you stand for the truth of the
[1:29:50] world
[1:30:03] he wants you to let down your guard
[1:30:14] no matter what the devil says about
[1:30:18] him hallelujah
[1:30:22] right see why
[1:30:24] the thing that gets me like
[1:30:27] is because the bible says
[1:30:30] that the enemy
[1:30:32] will be someone in your own house
[1:30:36] hallelujah
[1:30:38] enemies in the world
[1:30:41] they don't bother us
[1:30:43] but when they church
[1:30:45] when they come to church
[1:30:50] [Applause]
[1:30:58] is that when confusion comes in the
[1:31:00] church
[1:31:16] i have eight children
[1:31:18] and maybe i always say one and a half
[1:31:22] i'll say it like there's two serving the
[1:31:24] lord
[1:31:25] who earned himself according to the
[1:31:27] revelation of the message
[1:31:41] they believe that they are doing the
[1:31:43] right thing
[1:31:45] even though they've been taught the
[1:31:46] message
[1:31:48] they never had a message of birth you

[1:32:46] they moved into the anointing
[1:32:49] hallelujah of their age
[1:32:52] hallelujah
[1:33:31] but that's not the anointing of the day
[1:33:34] the unknown

[1:36:46] is everybody paying attention

[1:40:01] historian says this is
[1:40:03] that he was so badly beaten
[1:40:06] that he
[1:40:19] forgive them
[1:40:30] for they know not what they do
[1:40:32] that's what divine love does

[1:56:52] [Music]
[1:56:58] in elementary school a little uh grade
[1:57:01] school
[1:57:05] every year you had to take a test shock
[1:57:07] factor
[1:57:08] a new saving
[1:57:15] [Music]
[1:57:24] when you don't pass the test
[1:57:28] you can't go forward
[1:57:30] until you pass the test
[1:57:34] i was here wednesday for those of you
[1:57:36] who weren't here
[1:57:40] i was at the atm
[1:57:43] atm
[1:57:44] uh uh checking on my uh account
[1:57:49] and while i was at the
[1:57:53] uh i heard somebody bump their horn at
[1:57:55] me
[1:57:57] and i was i was leaving the atm
[1:58:00] atm so i thought maybe did i leave my
[1:58:02] car she was actually saying did i leave
[1:58:04] something
[1:58:04] there well i got out of the car
[1:58:08] and this man began to curse me out
[1:58:15] just curse me
[1:58:17] would you say
[1:58:18] there's no way i could say what he said
[1:58:19] but in my head i can hear it
[1:58:23] but what came out of me
[1:58:26] what's the thing that surprised me
[1:58:29] all i could say
[1:58:31] was god bless you sir
[1:58:34] god bless you sir
[1:58:37] god bless you sir
[1:58:40] and i said to him
[1:58:42] sir i can't move no faster
[1:58:45] then the machine allows
[1:58:49] hallelujah
[1:58:50] and and when i went back in and got back
[1:58:52] in my car
[1:58:54] he still was cursing he's continuing
[1:58:56] after i said god bless you
[1:59:01] but the thing that got me man
[1:59:03] because i was confused
[1:59:05] the first thing i asked the lord
[1:59:07] was what did i do
[1:59:09] you deserve this
[1:59:11] you see and as i rolled around the bank
[1:59:14] yeah
[1:59:24] he doesn't know what he's doing
[1:59:26] and i'm sure he didn't mean it you just
[1:59:28] think you could
[1:59:47] because there was a time
[1:59:49] i may have said god bless you
[1:59:52] but all the hairs on my neck would have
[1:59:54] been standing up mentally
[1:59:56] alive
[2:00:25] i hope you all understand
[2:00:27] this is what the danger is
[2:00:30] with you
[2:00:32] and everyone
[2:00:34] you cannot talk to each other
[2:00:36] any kind of way
[2:00:38] without
[2:00:47] raising eight children elevate we don't
[2:00:50] fall the kids would get in trouble lisa
[2:01:07] because i knew by whipping both of them
[2:01:08] secondly
[2:01:10] i was going to get the right one
[2:01:13] and then the innocent one
[2:01:15] song was going to come back and say but
[2:01:17] daddy i didn't do it
[2:01:19] what i'm saying
[2:01:21] see what i'm trying to say is because i
[2:01:23] don't have concerns
[2:01:25] i had to use the right the the the the
[2:01:27] only means i could use
[2:01:30] it to bring the truth out
[2:01:32] but see that's how god is
[2:01:52] i'm trying to find out where i should
[2:01:53] preach from she said
[2:01:57] because i want you to understand that
[2:01:58] god
[2:01:59] will always prevail
[2:02:02] now if we're going to brother brandon
[2:02:04] said each one of these virtues is
[2:02:06] victory
[2:02:08] amen
[2:02:10] if you like in temperance
[2:02:13] you're going to be tried
[2:02:17] if you like patience
[2:02:20] you're going to get into uh and how many
[2:02:22] of us know that
[2:02:24] you you in a rush
[2:02:27] you're speeding when you know you
[2:02:28] shouldn't be speeding
[2:02:30] and
[2:02:49] what are they doing
[2:02:52] we don't realize
[2:02:54] that god is protecting us
[2:03:00] can i go further
[2:03:02] i won't see
[2:03:03] the bible said
[2:03:05] but if that if he that lacketh these
[2:03:08] things
[2:03:09] but he the ninth verse but he that
[2:03:12] lacketh these things i'm back to peter
[2:03:14] okay
[2:03:16] but he that lacketh these things is
[2:03:18] blind
[2:03:20] and cannot see afar off
[2:03:23] and have forgotten
[2:03:25] that he was purged from his old sins
[2:03:34] purification
[2:03:37] [Applause]
[2:03:40] give diligence
[2:03:50] [Music]

[2:04:09] into the everlasting kingdom of our lord
[2:04:11] and savior jesus christ
[2:04:15] hallelujah
[2:04:17] it is the key you see like that god used
[2:04:20] peter
[2:04:21] to express to us
[2:05:03] how many y'all people came straight to
[2:05:05] the message
[2:05:07] and you bypassed the cross
[2:05:13] you never went to calvary
[2:05:16] you never asked god to cleanse you from
[2:05:18] your sins
[2:05:47] hello
[2:05:48] because that's what they say
[2:05:50] if you believe the message that's all
[2:05:52] you need
[2:05:53] that's the baptist doctrine
[2:05:56] that is filtrated into the message
[2:05:58] it's more than believing the message
[2:06:13] i hope this is a blessing to you jesus
[2:06:16] second corinthians
[2:06:18] seven and one people
[2:06:20] y'all might as well just wait
[2:06:22] because i'm not gonna stop until i'm
[2:06:24] dead stop
[2:06:25] until i'm done
[2:06:28] second corinthians
[2:06:32] having therefore these promises dearly
[2:06:34] beloved
[2:06:37] let us cleanse ourselves from all
[2:06:40] filthiness of the flesh and spirit

[2:15:55] who died
[2:15:57] thinking they had the holy ghost

[2:16:05] understand what i'm saying
[2:16:07] there are a lot of messaged people

[2:16:13] thinking they had the holy ghost
[2:16:18] and they did not in in a viper hello

[2:16:45] hallelujah the bible said they had two
[2:16:48] their spirits were different
[2:16:51] that's what i'm saying
[2:16:53] brother preached one in a million
[2:16:55] hallelujah you gotta understand this is
[2:16:58] a narrow way
[2:17:01] in a narrow way
[2:17:04] and the bible tells us only a few be
[2:17:06] that finds it
[2:17:08] that means you got to search justified
[2:17:11] you got a dig in there
[2:17:25] if you think hard times are now

[2:17:32] and produce it's going to get hard
[2:17:35] all over the world

[2:17:57] now let us lay us out our traditions
[2:17:59] this morning
[2:18:03] sunday schools lessons
[2:18:06] and be sure that we find that one place
[2:18:14] [Music]
[2:18:36] church
[2:18:38] who is his church jesus
[2:18:40] the bible said by one spirit
[2:18:42] are we baptized into one body
[2:18:45] that one body is the church of christ
[2:18:48] it's the church of god
[2:18:50] that's the
[2:19:04] as a christian
[2:19:06] are you going to suffer as a devil
[2:19:09] either way you're going to suffer
[2:19:11] but there's one suffering
[2:19:14] that will reward you at the end
[2:19:18] precious
[2:19:30] [Music]
[2:19:46] do you worship me
[2:19:48] teaching the god for doctrines
[2:19:50] the commandment of man
[2:19:53] or their denominational creed
[2:19:57] is it sincere
[2:19:59] just as religious as they could be
[2:20:04] [Applause]
[2:20:13] absolutely came in the same attitude
[2:20:18] was just as religious
[2:20:21] they both built altars
[2:20:25] they both love god
[2:20:27] they both sacrificed
[2:20:29] feel sacrifices
[2:20:35] both done everything just like they
[2:20:37] don't fit
[2:20:39] able
[2:20:40] by faith
[2:20:41] which is the revelation
[2:20:53] the word of god revealed
[2:21:09] made the offering you can have if you
[2:21:11] know god didn't vindicate it
[2:21:14] by the true channel
[2:21:16] see
[2:21:18] give me this last one this morning and
[2:21:19] then i'll let you go
[2:21:22] there's another quote
[2:21:24] but we must meet the conditions of the
[2:21:26] day
[2:21:28] as i said
[2:21:32] the lutherans
[2:21:33] got into the spirit of luther
[2:21:38] god in the spirit of
[2:21:51] that those who believe in malachi 4
[2:22:07] you understand me
[2:22:08] if you start listening to brother
[2:22:10] branham
[2:22:12] even after 63.
[2:22:15] and you begin to see the change
[2:22:18] in his ministry
[2:22:20] and he began to talk more with the bride
[2:22:26] and what she's supposed to do
[2:22:28] how great she's supposed to be
[2:22:31] and then he goes into how god
[2:22:34] was
[2:22:50] why do you think god gave him those
[2:22:52] things
[2:22:54] this is true this wasn't just to make
[2:22:55] brother branham feel good
[2:22:58] he was supposed to lay on the tape for
[2:23:00] the bride
[2:23:02] so that she can see that this the jesus
[2:23:04] jehovah of old testament
[2:23:07] jesus christ of the news
[2:23:09] and she's got to enter into that you're
[2:23:11] going to say you can't you can't go into
[2:23:13] this condition
[2:23:16] any kind of
[2:23:18] [Applause]
[2:23:28] no no no you won't get there
[2:23:52] so in order of us to go in behind the
[2:23:54] curtains
[2:23:56] you got to be justified
[2:23:58] sanctified
[2:24:09] [Music]
[2:24:12] now let me say this in closing
[2:24:16] in in the message
[2:24:19] god's only valid place of worship
[2:24:22] 11 28 um
[2:24:24] yeah november november yeah yeah
[2:24:27] uh dude
[2:24:30] thank you for your patience merciful
[2:24:32] hallelujah
[2:24:34] now think hello
[2:24:36] these men
[2:24:38] well
[2:24:39] why was they called and was put in this
[2:24:42] condition
[2:24:45] these pharisees
[2:24:47] by jesus said
[2:24:50] in vain you worship me
[2:24:54] worship him
[2:24:56] genuine worship
[2:24:59] true worship from their heart
[2:25:03] you worship me
[2:25:05] teaching for the doctrine
[2:25:07] the tradition of men the traditions
[2:25:21] they are supposed to
[2:25:36] hallelujah
[2:25:37] is that right
[2:25:38] even when brother branham
[2:25:40] said he wanted three squirrels
[2:25:42] and he just took the one squirrel
[2:25:45] and he was getting ready to leave he
[2:25:47] needed to pray the angel said to brother
[2:25:49] branham
[2:25:50] but i
[2:25:58] see when you ask god for something
[2:26:00] be specific swipe specifically and hold
[2:26:03] to it
[2:26:10] absolutely absolutely more tests will
[2:26:13] come the trials will come the devil will
[2:26:16] come and try to shake you from what you
[2:26:18] believe
[2:26:37] [Music]
[2:26:46] put it on the park with the looses and
[2:26:48] shields it will hatch
[2:26:51] it's the warmness
[2:26:53] the condition that makes it hatch the
[2:26:55] conditions so it was to be under
[2:26:58] conditions
[2:27:06] [Applause]
[2:27:15] two men don't sit there and this church
[2:27:17] is just dead and cold
[2:27:19] there is no worship
[2:27:22] and there is no praise
[2:27:24] and you don't bring the warmth of the
[2:27:26] holy ghost in here
[2:27:28] i don't care if there is elect seed in
[2:27:30] here
[2:27:32] they'll never hatch
[2:27:34] because you have produced the wrong
[2:27:37] condition basically
[2:27:41] atmosphere
[2:27:43] hallelujah
[2:27:45] well
[2:27:46] that's the way it is in this age
[2:27:50] that we're living in don't you care
[2:27:51] you've got to find what is god's way of
[2:27:54] doing it for this age
[2:27:56] that's
[2:28:16] [Music]
[2:28:25] i'm almost done
[2:28:26] my heart goes out for those of you tired
[2:28:28] i know some of you guys just came from
[2:28:30] work and all that
[2:28:31] but but i'm almost done i'm almost done
[2:28:34] now
[2:28:35] the pentecostal that brother
[2:28:37] i believe
[2:28:39] one of his eyes was out
[2:28:41] a colored brother
[2:28:43] who really started the pentecostal
[2:28:45] message in california
[2:28:52] because he was a negro pascal
[2:28:55] he was made funner
[2:28:57] but he brought a message for that age
[2:29:02] fellow couldn't hardly sign his own name
[2:29:06] but the lord
[2:29:20] but everybody
[2:29:22] [Applause]
[2:29:47] in the world
[2:30:03] you don't that killed it
[2:30:05] wasn't it goes right on see so that's
[2:30:07] important
[2:30:08] then they started separating yes
[2:30:13] and making denominations
[2:30:15] now you know what i'm trying to say
[2:30:29] if you don't say these kind of words
[2:30:32] and when they did that he lost his own
[2:30:35] faith
[2:30:36] right there so more solution that's the
[2:30:39] prophet's message
[2:30:41] hallelujah it is so amazing you see how
[2:30:44] we want to put people in and out of
[2:30:46] heaven
[2:30:48] when we don't have a message we don't
[2:30:50] have a heaven to put them in and now
[2:30:53] they met
[2:30:54] here
[2:30:59] and your pastor can't guarantee you
[2:31:01] heaven
[2:31:09] the holy ghost guarantees you the
[2:31:10] sentence
[2:31:12] hallelujah but then when he went and
[2:31:15] pinned it down right it was literally on
[2:31:17] francina shoes let me jump back up then
[2:31:20] they started separating this that
[2:31:23] they're making denominations
[2:31:25] and one coming on a cloud
[2:31:36] and we're doing the same thing because
[2:31:38] right oh we're still having problems
[2:31:40] with the clouds we're still having a
[2:31:42] problem with the the literal body coming
[2:31:45] up we have all these issues
[2:31:47] what the focus is
[2:31:49] you need to be born again
[2:31:51] the focus is
[2:32:05] mercy lord god
[2:32:12] this is my last quote
[2:32:15] god's own provided place of worship
[2:32:17] paragraph 102.
[2:32:20] it's your love to god you see vodka
[2:32:24] lord i don't care what you want me to do
[2:32:28] i'm willing to do it
[2:32:31] then you're getting somewhere
[2:32:35] but if you don't do it that way
[2:32:38] the way he said do it coming
[2:32:41] see it's his choosing
[2:32:44] the place i have chosen
[2:32:47] that's where you worship with your
[2:32:50] sacrifices
[2:32:52] and that's what people don't understand
[2:32:55] god chose this message
[2:32:58] the bloody bleeding word
[2:33:00] for this day
[2:33:02] as a place of worship come on
[2:33:08] you can't read it like a newspaper
[2:33:11] or hand it like an intellectual
[2:33:13] something where you're just going to
[2:33:14] learn everything brother branham said
[2:33:16] intellectually
[2:33:17] and you're not going to do it
[2:33:20] you know it's true so why people will
[2:33:22] fight you over things that brother adam
[2:33:24] says
[2:33:28] he didn't say it
[2:33:31] but one thing he did say come to church
[2:33:33] a half hour early
[2:33:36] i'm gonna always get you on that one
[2:33:38] until you get it
[2:33:40] he did say come on now some of y'all i
[2:33:42] know you can't make it
[2:33:44] i'm not talking
[2:33:45] but i'm talking to those guys amen uh
[2:33:47] whoever it may be they're late right
[2:33:49] there
[2:33:50] [Music]

[2:33:55] they just don't know how to be on time
[2:33:59] my natural children myself
[2:34:02] they go to work late
[2:34:05] and then get mad at the boss it's just
[2:34:07] going to the boss
[2:34:09] for saying something
[2:34:12] you're coming like what
[2:34:14] you're
[2:34:21] they'll know they have to be to work at

[2:34:38] on time and that's okay i'm not working
[2:34:40] with you
[2:34:40] don't let the devil fight your neck it's
[2:34:55] and that's okay i needed it
[2:34:58] hallelujah
[2:35:00] you know it's it's amazing
[2:35:03] but i i say this to all of us all that's
[2:35:05] been said
[2:35:08] don't let the devil think municipalities
[2:35:24] i don't care where you came from
[2:35:27] i believe in all of you
[2:35:29] and i do believe your bride
[2:35:32] i wouldn't be preaching my heart out
[2:35:34] like this if i didn't
[2:35:37] hallelujah people said well you know you
[2:35:39] always have three kind of believers
[2:35:43] i don't know who they are
[2:35:45] i don't really want to know
[2:35:48] i want to preach to everybody like they
[2:35:50] bribe
[2:35:52] you understand me because i want to see
[2:35:55] everybody make it
[2:35:59] but i can't do it on my own
[2:36:04] each and every one of us has to take on
[2:36:05] that responsibility
[2:36:08] if you're going to be in the church if
[2:36:09] you're going to be part of the church
[2:36:12] like i preach on on wednesday
[2:36:15] i think that's recorded right brother

[2:36:42] right i'm making peace with each other
[2:36:46] invest in this church
[2:36:48] to make this a supernatural
[2:36:50] church
[2:36:52] right now we're leaning more toward the
[2:36:54] canality of of the message
[2:37:06] and so to help you
[2:37:07] you'll see
[2:37:09] one of the things you're going to have
[2:37:10] to overcome
[2:37:13] is the spirit of gossip is
[2:37:18] amen
[2:37:21] amen
[2:37:23] amen
[2:37:29] it's true
[2:37:30] it's killing the church
[2:37:34] people taking sides

[2:37:43] and for those of us who spread it
[2:37:53] [Music]
