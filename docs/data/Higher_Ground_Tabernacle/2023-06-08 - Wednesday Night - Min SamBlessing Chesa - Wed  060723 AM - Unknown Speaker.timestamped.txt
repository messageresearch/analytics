[19:34] amen
[19:38] [Music]
[19:49] just a word about what's happened in my
[19:54] life
[19:55] I first of all I don't believe in
[19:57] wearing hats in church so I asked the
[20:00] Lord to forgive me ahead of time and
[20:03] read a give this testimony that he would
[20:06] put on the hearts of the song leader
[20:08] that's exactly what he did because we
[20:11] had no arrangement
[20:14] yesterday was a day of culmination where
[20:17] I had biopsies dying on my head and
[20:20] that's why I have the hat to hold my
[20:23] stitches and everything together because
[20:25] I have internal and external stitches
[20:29] the biopsy showed the The Physician that
[20:34] one of two areas that I had cancer
[20:38] and
[20:40] so but he wanted to take tests before we
[20:44] did any removal and so he did he took
[20:48] two tests yesterday
[20:51] and then because that they were switched
[20:55] and what they thought the results were
[20:58] you took two again
[21:00] and so when he came back into the his
[21:04] office the
[21:06] physician assistant came with him and
[21:10] she was crying and
[21:12] and I said to him I said is everything
[21:14] okay and he says yes uh you're totally
[21:20] clean
[21:21] he said there was there was absolutely
[21:23] nothing there he says I I've never seen
[21:26] this before but I I guess we can say
[21:29] that Miracles still do happen here on
[21:33] Earth
[21:34] and so it was really a blessing and his
[21:39] name is Dr Love which I thought was very
[21:44] unique so forgive me again for the Hat
[21:49] I know the Lord understands
[21:51] just bow our heads
[21:54] all the God we do come to you and
[21:57] the name of Jesus Christ for there is no
[22:00] other name
[22:01] which man can be saved

[53:44] amen let's stand upon our feet
[53:47] and open our Bibles to the Book of
[53:49] Genesis Chapter 18 and verse 11.
[54:03] the Bible reads now Abraham and Sarah
[54:05] are old and was well-stricken in age
[54:09] and it ceased to be with Sarah after the
[54:12] manner of women
[54:15] therefore Sarah laughed within herself
[54:17] saying after I am waxed old shall I have
[54:20] pleasure my Lord being old also
[54:25] and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore
[54:28] did Sarah laugh saying shall I offer
[54:31] sure to Bear a child which am old
[54:35] is there anything too hard for the Lord
[54:37] at the time appointed I will return unto
[54:41] thee according to the time of life and
[54:43] Sarah shall have a son amen may the Lord
[54:46] add blessings to the reading of his
[54:47] words might take our seeds
[54:52] amen
[54:54] for a short while this evening I want to
[54:57] speak on is there anything too hard for
[54:59] the Lord
[55:00] Hallelujah we know that there is nothing
[55:03] that's too hard for God he has never
[55:06] ever failed and we know he is not
[55:08] failing and he still will never fail in
[55:11] our lives amen
[55:12] if he did it for Abraham and Sarah he
[55:15] can do it for you and me amen and this
[55:18] word that we read it is God's Own word
[55:20] that he spoke
[55:22] the same words that said let there be
[55:25] light the same person who said let there
[55:28] be light and there was light as the same
[55:31] person who was talking to Abraham amen
[55:33] and the words he told Abraham is is they
[55:36] is anything too hard for the Lord and
[55:40] the answer we all know is no there is
[55:42] nothing that's too hard for the Lord
[55:45] and Abraham and Sarah they've been
[55:46] waiting for his son for oh for 25 years
[55:51] they had been they were almost losing
[55:53] hope Sarah could not believe it anymore
[55:55] as we read it in the Bible Sarah loved
[55:58] one day she heard the man who was
[56:01] talking to Abraham which was God in
[56:04] flesh she did not believe it she said
[56:06] how come he said how is that going to
[56:09] happen to me I'm old my warm is dead
[56:12] there is no way I'm going to be able to
[56:14] conceive and bear a child but God said
[56:17] is there anything that's too hard for
[56:19] the Lord amen
[56:20] it doesn't matter how much hope you are
[56:22] losing just hold on to that word and say
[56:25] father You Did It For My Father Abraham
[56:28] so his promise goes down through from
[56:31] all from all of Abraham's seed down to
[56:34] you so you can take that word and also
[56:37] say is there anything too hard for the
[56:38] Lord in my life hold on to it God will
[56:41] is able to make his word come to pass in
[56:44] your life
[56:46] and this was God came to Abraham and
[56:48] Sarah at a time
[56:50] when they had tried all they could and
[56:53] there was no hope all hope was lost
[56:56] and we know that it's always darkest
[56:58] before Dawn
[57:01] the darkness is most intense just before
[57:03] the sun is about to come out
[57:05] so when you are losing hope when you
[57:09] think you have come to the end of all
[57:11] your wits and you have tried all you can
[57:13] and you feel like this is my worst no
[57:16] that's when your promise is about to
[57:18] come around
[57:19] because
[57:20] it is always darkest before Dawn
[57:23] just before the sun is about to break
[57:25] the Horizon that's when the that's when
[57:27] it's darkest so don't lose hope
[57:31] keep on holding on to this word and know
[57:33] that there is nothing that's too hard
[57:36] for the Lord amen
[57:37] the scripture says weeping may endure
[57:40] for a season but joy comes in the
[57:42] morning it doesn't matter how long your
[57:44] night was it doesn't matter how many
[57:47] years you have been weeping but there is
[57:49] a word that says if you have been
[57:51] weeping throughout the whole night as
[57:53] soon as that Sun starts breaking through
[57:55] Horizon know that your joy is coming
[57:58] amen that's the word of God and the word
[58:01] of God never fails so it does not matter
[58:04] what your night is it does not matter
[58:06] what you are Weeping for just keep on
[58:09] holding and know that as soon as the sun
[58:11] is about to rise
[58:13] Joy is coming your way your weeping is
[58:16] about to end your trial is about to come
[58:19] to an end why
[58:21] God's word never fails whipping may
[58:24] endure for the night but joy always
[58:26] comes in the morning
[58:28] when you are sick and your disease is
[58:31] about to leave that's when it hurts the
[58:33] most that's when you have most pain the
[58:36] prophet of God describes it and talks
[58:38] about how when the germ dies
[58:41] you see a swelling and the pain
[58:43] increases it does not mean that it's
[58:45] getting worse it means that you have you
[58:47] have been already healed
[58:50] you have seen when you are driving on
[58:52] the on the on the road you see a deer
[58:54] that's been hit by a car after three
[58:56] days or so it swells
[58:58] but it's already dead it doesn't mean
[59:00] it's still alive so those germs whatever
[59:03] causes diseases when it's dead it might
[59:07] cause you a lot of pain but that does
[59:10] not mean it's still alive that does not
[59:13] mean it's still afflicting you it means
[59:15] that's the end of it and the prophet of
[59:17] God says don't doubt when it gets worse
[59:19] because when you doubt the life that had
[59:23] left out of this demon the life that it
[59:25] left out of this germ as soon as you
[59:27] doubt and Faith your faith is gone and
[59:30] doubt Creeps in that life comes back in
[59:32] and then you start getting sick again
[59:35] and you lose your healing so brother
[59:38] sister it does not matter what you're
[59:40] going through when you have believed
[59:42] when you have prayed when your healing
[59:45] is coming your way
[59:46] keep on holding on
[59:49] pain might increase but keep on holding
[59:51] on because Joy is coming in the morning
[59:54] that germ is gone hey man so brother
[59:57] sister don't doubt
[1:00:00] Keep On Believing in God because there
[1:00:01] is nothing that's too hard for him
[1:00:03] doesn't matter what you are going
[1:00:05] through know that all things work
[1:00:07] together for them that love the Lord
[1:00:11] it might not look good to you but it is
[1:00:13] good for you amen
[1:00:16] it doesn't matter how ugly it might look
[1:00:18] but just know that the word says all
[1:00:21] things work together for your good it
[1:00:24] doesn't matter how bad it is it doesn't
[1:00:27] matter how painful it is I will keep on
[1:00:29] trusting God and holding on to his word
[1:00:32] and say Lord I know whatever you are
[1:00:35] sending me through is for my girl I
[1:00:38] might not like the process I might not
[1:00:40] like what I'm going through but your
[1:00:42] word says everything works out for my
[1:00:45] good
[1:00:47] for them that love the Lord if you love
[1:00:49] the Lord This Promise applies to you it
[1:00:53] does not matter how long your trial
[1:00:55] you've been going through it just know
[1:00:57] God allowed it
[1:00:59] it might hurt
[1:01:02] you might say I'm not able to Bear it
[1:01:04] but know that God is orchestrating it
[1:01:07] for your good he is trying to work out
[1:01:09] something to you it might be like
[1:01:12] Jonah's plans God is sending you where
[1:01:14] you don't want to go but you know that
[1:01:16] God is sending you there for a purpose
[1:01:18] he wants to show out his glory because
[1:01:21] everything he does is for His glory it
[1:01:24] might be like job he takes everything
[1:01:27] away from you he takes your riches he
[1:01:30] takes your hope away from you and he
[1:01:33] takes everything that you hold so dear
[1:01:35] you might not like it and yes you will
[1:01:38] not like it but know that it is working
[1:01:40] out for your good
[1:01:41] amen if you love the Lord whatever you
[1:01:45] are going through it's working out for
[1:01:47] your good amen
[1:01:49] so you know whatever he sends you away
[1:01:51] God has permitted it
[1:01:54] before Satan could touch an afflict job
[1:01:57] God had to give Satan permission
[1:02:00] so anything that comes your way know
[1:02:03] that God has permitted it and he has
[1:02:06] trusted you knowing that you can
[1:02:08] overcome it because he can never give
[1:02:10] you a trial that you cannot handle he
[1:02:13] cannot give you a disease that you know
[1:02:15] you cannot pass through it he cannot
[1:02:17] give you an Affliction he cannot give
[1:02:20] you a Temptation that he knows you
[1:02:22] cannot handle so when it comes your way
[1:02:25] you say Lord I Trust You Lord I Thank
[1:02:28] you I know you are building character in
[1:02:31] me I know this trial I know this
[1:02:35] temptation it is for my good
[1:02:38] because God is intentional whatever he
[1:02:41] does he does it for a reason whatever he
[1:02:45] allows he is doing it for a reason so
[1:02:47] when he does something he is doing
[1:02:50] something for you
[1:02:51] and when he does not do anything he is
[1:02:53] doing something because God is
[1:02:56] intentional so when he sits back he is
[1:02:59] doing something he's allowing you to go
[1:03:01] through that so he can show forth his
[1:03:04] power so he can show his glory
[1:03:07] that's why you gotta trust him God sees
[1:03:10] when you see to the corner God sees
[1:03:12] around the corner where you see to the
[1:03:14] mountain God sees behind the mountain
[1:03:17] amen because he says I know the plans
[1:03:20] that I have for you plans for you to
[1:03:22] prosper so God's plans in your life they
[1:03:26] are not to destroy you God's plans in
[1:03:29] your life they are not for you to suffer
[1:03:32] it might look like you are suffering but
[1:03:34] God has a greater purpose so you say
[1:03:37] Lord I know you have a plan for my life
[1:03:40] I know you are intentional
[1:03:43] Hallelujah
[1:03:45] like the singer said we will only
[1:03:47] understand it better by and by you might
[1:03:49] not understand why you're going through
[1:03:51] what you're going through right now but
[1:03:53] you will understand when you are past it
[1:03:55] and you look back and you say that was
[1:03:57] God if I hadn't gone through this I
[1:04:00] wouldn't have built this character
[1:04:03] Good Friday was not a good Friday the
[1:04:07] Friday that Jesus died that was the
[1:04:09] worst day in human history
[1:04:11] because everyone all the disciples had
[1:04:14] lost hope the person whom they thought
[1:04:16] had come to save him was dead and gone
[1:04:18] but good Friday only became good after
[1:04:23] Jesus resurrected when they could look
[1:04:25] back on Sunday and look back and say
[1:04:27] that Friday was a good Friday although
[1:04:30] it was not good for us then but we knew
[1:04:33] God was working it for a greater purpose
[1:04:36] Hallelujah so when he died it was the
[1:04:39] worst thing ever they never expected
[1:04:42] Jesus to die although he was prophesying
[1:04:44] it each and every day
[1:04:46] but he died so you and me could be saved
[1:04:49] he died for you and me to be healed So
[1:04:53] Good Friday did not look good on that
[1:04:55] Friday it only became a good Friday
[1:04:57] after Sunday so you trial and Temptation
[1:05:00] does not look good right now it only
[1:05:03] looks good after you have passed it and
[1:05:06] you look back and you say Lord I Thank
[1:05:09] you I know it was you thank you for
[1:05:11] resurrecting me from that problem thank
[1:05:14] you for taking me out of that Temptation
[1:05:16] when I look back I thought this trial
[1:05:20] was going to kill me but I thank you
[1:05:22] because it made me stronger now I can
[1:05:25] trust you now I can believe you
[1:05:28] because when you went through what you
[1:05:30] went through
[1:05:32] you you didn't know anyone to turn to
[1:05:35] you remember those sleepless nights you
[1:05:38] had and God seemed like he couldn't hear
[1:05:40] you at all but when you look back you
[1:05:42] say Lord I thank you for that because
[1:05:44] now you trust him more than you did
[1:05:47] prior to that Temptation prior to that
[1:05:50] trial now you believe and you can tell
[1:05:53] and say Lord I know you are a Healer
[1:05:55] Lord I know you are a savior Lord I know
[1:05:59] you are a deliverer because when you are
[1:06:01] past it and look back that's when you
[1:06:04] can say I understand you will understand
[1:06:07] it better by and by
[1:06:10] you might lose a job and don't
[1:06:12] understand why did I lose my job
[1:06:14] I'm a Son of God I'm supposed to prosper
[1:06:17] in this job but you don't know why you
[1:06:19] lost it you might not understand but
[1:06:22] just trust in God and say Lord I know
[1:06:24] you made me lose this job for a reason I
[1:06:27] trust you later by and by when I look
[1:06:30] back I'm going to say thank you Lord for
[1:06:32] making me lose that job because if I
[1:06:34] hadn't lost that job I wouldn't know
[1:06:37] that you would give me something better
[1:06:39] I wouldn't know that you can provide for
[1:06:41] me I wouldn't know that you wanted to
[1:06:44] elevate me
[1:06:45] what you thought was a breakdown after
[1:06:48] you are through it you will understand
[1:06:50] you say Lord I thank you that was a
[1:06:52] breakthrough it looked like a breakdown
[1:06:55] when you were in it but after you were
[1:06:57] past it and looked back and see what God
[1:07:00] has brought you from it you will say
[1:07:02] thank you for giving me that
[1:07:03] breakthrough amen
[1:07:05] what you thought was a rejection what
[1:07:08] you thought God was not allowing you you
[1:07:11] look back and you see that it was not a
[1:07:13] rejection but it was God's redirection
[1:07:16] he was pointing you and turning you out
[1:07:19] in a better direction for you
[1:07:22] because he says I know the plans that I
[1:07:24] have for you trust him the Bible says
[1:07:27] consider the Lord in all your ways and
[1:07:30] he will guide your footsteps so whatever
[1:07:32] you do be it at your job be it at home
[1:07:36] be it whatever you do consider the Lord
[1:07:39] in each and everything you do he will
[1:07:41] guide your footsteps because he knows
[1:07:43] the plans that he has for you
[1:07:45] so you trust him you will see when he
[1:07:48] takes you out of it amen because Joy
[1:07:51] comes in the morning amen your blessing
[1:07:53] is right after that trial you know exams
[1:07:56] might be tough but after you are done
[1:07:58] with that exam you are so happy when you
[1:08:01] see that grade and you will you're not
[1:08:03] gonna remember how tough that exam was
[1:08:06] you're just going to rejoice when you
[1:08:08] look at that certificate you will you
[1:08:11] won't remember all those sleepless
[1:08:12] nights you just look at that diploma or
[1:08:16] degree whatever you have whatever you
[1:08:18] get after passing through that test and
[1:08:20] you say it was worth it you look at it
[1:08:23] and you smile so when you are done
[1:08:25] through the test that God has sent you
[1:08:27] through and you see how he has taken you
[1:08:30] you see how he has healed you you see
[1:08:33] the blessings he has given you you will
[1:08:35] look back and you smile at it and you
[1:08:38] say it was God and you say thank you
[1:08:40] Lord for taking me through this hey man
[1:08:43] so every time you go through a trial
[1:08:46] know that God has a way out for you and
[1:08:49] you will appreciate it when you look
[1:08:51] back and see what God has brought you
[1:08:54] out of
[1:08:54] so don't disbelieve Keep On Believing
[1:08:58] Sarah
[1:09:00] disbelieved what God Said the prophet of
[1:09:03] God tells us that if it was not because
[1:09:04] of Abraham God would have killed Sarah
[1:09:07] because she did not believe God so not
[1:09:12] believing God will make you lose your
[1:09:14] blessings the prophet of God says
[1:09:17] he was speaking about himself he said
[1:09:19] Satan's been after me all day so I just
[1:09:22] believe that there is a blessing in
[1:09:23] store here in this city somewhere and I
[1:09:26] know when he tempts and tries to block
[1:09:28] out what's he trying to do he's trying
[1:09:31] to get you to disbelieve the worst thing
[1:09:34] you can do is disbelieve God and as soon
[1:09:37] as you get a little scared well maybe I
[1:09:40] haven't done this I haven't done that
[1:09:41] right then Satan's got that blessing
[1:09:44] conquered for you so every time you see
[1:09:47] Satan trying to fight you you know that
[1:09:50] there's a blessing right around the
[1:09:51] corner there's a blessing right there
[1:09:53] for you because he's trying to distract
[1:09:56] you so he doesn't you don't reach that
[1:09:58] destination
[1:10:00] so you don't disbelieve God actually
[1:10:03] when you see that the situation or
[1:10:07] whatever you're going through is getting
[1:10:08] worse you know that you're about to
[1:10:10] arrive there you are about to arrive to
[1:10:13] your destination you are about to get
[1:10:16] what you have been praying for amen
[1:10:18] because Satan starts to try to distract
[1:10:21] you when you're about to get where you
[1:10:23] want to go to when you are just out of
[1:10:26] arm's length of your blessing that's
[1:10:28] when Satan comes to try and distract you
[1:10:30] but brother sister Keep On Believing do
[1:10:34] not lose your focus keep on looking to
[1:10:37] the promise Giver for he is more than
[1:10:39] able to do what he said he will do
[1:10:42] Hallelujah
[1:10:45] and we read in the book of um in the
[1:10:47] Book of Genesis we read
[1:10:49] Abraham God came to Abram and he gave he
[1:10:52] had given them a promise but Sarah was
[1:10:54] already disbelieving but Abraham
[1:10:56] believed that despite it being so long
[1:10:59] despite the situation of Sarah despite
[1:11:03] his own situation being sterile in his
[1:11:06] womb his wife was now barren
[1:11:09] he didn't look at those circumstances
[1:11:10] because he know that there is nothing
[1:11:13] that's too hard for the Lord if God said
[1:11:16] it then that settles it
[1:11:19] when God gives a promise he is the one
[1:11:22] who's responsible to transform you to
[1:11:26] change you to to condition you for you
[1:11:30] to receive his promise that he gave in
[1:11:32] his word so it is not my duty to to know
[1:11:36] how it's going to happen Abraham was not
[1:11:40] worried about how
[1:11:42] their bodies were going to be
[1:11:44] biologically reversed
[1:11:46] they just knew there is nothing that's
[1:11:48] too hard for the Lord he believed on God
[1:11:51] God said I will have a son so I will
[1:11:54] have a son God said it that settles it
[1:11:57] that's the
[1:12:00] that's how you're supposed to take each
[1:12:02] and every of God's promise that's the
[1:12:04] attitude you were supposed to have
[1:12:06] whenever you see the scriptures that
[1:12:09] applies to you when you see anything
[1:12:11] that you need take that attitude and say
[1:12:13] Lord I don't care how situation how the
[1:12:15] situation looks I don't care how the
[1:12:17] circumstances look like I don't know how
[1:12:19] I'm getting out of this but I know your
[1:12:22] word is true your word says ask whatever
[1:12:25] you will in my name you said you will do
[1:12:27] it so I know you will do it how I don't
[1:12:30] know I don't care I'm not the one who's
[1:12:31] doing it so I'm trusting in you anyways
[1:12:34] because there is nothing that's too hard
[1:12:36] for you so brother sister don't
[1:12:39] disbelieve God take him at his word have
[1:12:42] the right mental attitude to all of his
[1:12:45] promises and he will make his word come
[1:12:47] to pass to you
[1:12:48] he had a confidence with Abraham and he
[1:12:52] gave the Covenant to Abraham and to all
[1:12:54] of his seed and all of his see the
[1:12:56] children of Israel that came after him
[1:13:00] he had a covenant name he he told him I
[1:13:04] am Jehovah and Jehovah
[1:13:07] means becoming or I will be that's all
[1:13:10] it meant Jehovah it meant I will be so I
[1:13:15] will be blank that's how he gave it to
[1:13:17] the children of Israel
[1:13:20] when Moses asked um at the burning bush
[1:13:23] and said whom shall I say has sent me
[1:13:26] when I go back to the children of Israel
[1:13:28] God told him you say I am have sent you
[1:13:32] I am what I am blank you fill in the
[1:13:36] blank whatever you need that's what I am
[1:13:39] going to become to you so he gave them a
[1:13:42] covenant name Jehovah Jehovah who meant
[1:13:45] I becoming or I will be blank which is
[1:13:49] for you to feel
[1:13:51] and he had all the seven Redemptive
[1:13:53] names everything the children of Israel
[1:13:56] needed he was them for them because that
[1:14:00] was his Covenant with them and God never
[1:14:04] breaks his Covenant
[1:14:06] when he made a covenant with men men
[1:14:08] always felt that their part but God says
[1:14:11] this Covenant is all to do with me
[1:14:14] so I said I will do it I will do it so I
[1:14:18] am Jehovah to you all the head they just
[1:14:22] had to go to him whenever they needed
[1:14:24] him to provide they say Jehovah Jireh
[1:14:27] whenever they needed healing they would
[1:14:29] call on Jehovah Rapha whenever they
[1:14:32] needed him to lead them they would go to
[1:14:34] Jehovah rohi the Lord my shepherd
[1:14:36] Jehovah Jireh the Lord my provider
[1:14:39] whenever they were in battle they needed
[1:14:41] peace they were called on Jehovah shalom
[1:14:45] whenever they needed him to be their
[1:14:47] Banner they called on Jehovah Nissi they
[1:14:49] called on Jehovah tikenu Jehovah the
[1:14:52] Lord my righteousness they called him
[1:14:54] Jehovah shama the Lord who is there for
[1:14:57] me he was all that for them and if he
[1:15:01] had that Covenant with Abraham you are a
[1:15:04] son you are a daughter of Abraham call
[1:15:06] God on his name and he is able to do it
[1:15:09] for you amen
[1:15:13] in the days of Abraham they were in a
[1:15:15] polyethylstic culture they worshiped
[1:15:18] many gods there were so many gods they
[1:15:21] worshiped the son God
[1:15:23] they were heathens they worshiped idols
[1:15:27] and God wanted to establish his name
[1:15:29] that's why he called Abraham out so he
[1:15:33] can be identified as the god of Abraham
[1:15:36] when Moses asked them whom shall I say I
[1:15:39] am he says I am the god of Abraham Isaac
[1:15:42] and Jacob so he called Abraham out of
[1:15:45] the land of the heathens and he raised
[1:15:48] them up so God could be identified with
[1:15:51] Abraham everything he Abraham did they
[1:15:55] will say that's the god of Abraham so
[1:15:57] God wanted to show himself wanted to
[1:16:00] have his identity through Abraham
[1:16:03] everything he did for Abraham it came
[1:16:06] back to him because the Bible tells us
[1:16:08] that he is a jealousy God he wants all
[1:16:11] the glory amen so when they would call
[1:16:14] on the god of Abraham they knew
[1:16:17] everything that the god of Abraham had
[1:16:19] all the victories the children of Israel
[1:16:21] had they would call him the god of
[1:16:24] Abraham the god of Isaac the god of
[1:16:27] Jacob the god of Israel
[1:16:30] and they would see everything the
[1:16:32] children of Israel had come through and
[1:16:34] they would attribute that as the
[1:16:36] characteristics of God so God wants to
[1:16:40] show himself through you he says
[1:16:43] after he was after after he resurrected
[1:16:46] he says I will be even in you
[1:16:49] till the end of the Earth why is he in
[1:16:51] you because he wants to show himself
[1:16:53] through you he wants to be identified
[1:16:56] when he does a miracle in your life when
[1:17:00] you are living your holy life God wants
[1:17:03] to show himself through you you being a
[1:17:06] reflection of him so God is a jealousy
[1:17:10] God he is jealousy about his name so
[1:17:13] when you call on him he knows you're
[1:17:15] representing him so when you call on him
[1:17:17] and say Lord I need your help he knows
[1:17:20] you are his Ambassador so he's going to
[1:17:22] come through for you amen he's not going
[1:17:24] to fail you
[1:17:26] he was Jehovah
[1:17:29] I will be whatever you need him to be he
[1:17:32] is that to you this evening Hallelujah
[1:17:34] but we thank God after the cross of
[1:17:37] Calvary we know that Jehovah of the Old
[1:17:40] Testament that's Jesus of the New
[1:17:43] Testament Hallelujah everything that
[1:17:45] Jehovah was we know that that's what
[1:17:48] Jesus is
[1:17:50] so instead of
[1:17:51] naming all of the names of Jehovah and
[1:17:55] all his characteristics Jehovah rohi
[1:17:58] Jehovah Jared Jehovah Rapha all you just
[1:18:01] need to do now when you are praying just
[1:18:03] call on the name of Jesus
[1:18:05] when you call to say Jesus he is a
[1:18:09] provider
[1:18:10] when you call Jesus he is a savior when
[1:18:13] you call Jesus he is your peace
[1:18:16] Hallelujah so you call on the name of
[1:18:18] Jesus he is everything everything that
[1:18:22] was in God was poured into Jesus so
[1:18:25] whatever you need call on his name he
[1:18:28] will be there for you that's why he died
[1:18:30] on the cross of Calvary so he can be all
[1:18:32] that to you when he said it is finished
[1:18:35] he opened it up for you Hallelujah for
[1:18:38] you to be able to go to the throne of
[1:18:40] God claim everything that you need claim
[1:18:43] all your heart's desires claim your
[1:18:46] victory
[1:18:47] whatever you're going through just know
[1:18:50] there is nothing that's too hard for the
[1:18:52] Lord
[1:18:54] whenever unit saving call Jesus you need
[1:18:57] peace call on him because the Bible says
[1:19:00] there is nothing that's too hard for him
[1:19:02] he is able to do everything that he said
[1:19:05] he will do so I will look in the Bible
[1:19:08] and look at everything he said he will
[1:19:10] do I know he will do it because he will
[1:19:13] never fail
[1:19:16] Jesus is a gentleman he does not force
[1:19:20] himself on you
[1:19:23] he will only give you what you ask for
[1:19:25] he is not going to force this I'm going
[1:19:28] to give it to you anyhow whether you
[1:19:30] like it or not I'm going to give you you
[1:19:31] have to be wanting it for him to give it
[1:19:34] to you
[1:19:38] so you get what you are expecting
[1:19:43] because Jesus is a gentleman he waits
[1:19:46] for you to ask then when you ask that's
[1:19:48] when he provides
[1:19:50] that's why every time when we come to
[1:19:53] church we have to come expecting
[1:19:55] whatever you come expecting that's what
[1:19:58] you come to get if you come to church to
[1:20:01] criticize you will go back home with a
[1:20:04] long list of things to criticize because
[1:20:07] that's what you came expecting but when
[1:20:10] you come expecting a blessing you will
[1:20:13] get that blessing when you come
[1:20:15] expecting God to speak to you you will
[1:20:18] hear God speak to you because he always
[1:20:21] gives you what you are expecting
[1:20:24] he will supply your need that you need
[1:20:26] so if you need to come here to see
[1:20:29] everything that's wrong with everyone
[1:20:31] then you'll see everything that's wrong
[1:20:33] with everyone but remember when you
[1:20:35] point one finger the other three are
[1:20:37] pointing back at you so you have to
[1:20:39] examine yourself so come expecting
[1:20:43] the prophet of God says here well I
[1:20:46] still I see the angel checks his chair
[1:20:48] he was talking about when uh
[1:20:51] God came with the two angels and they
[1:20:53] were speaking to Abraham he says I see
[1:20:55] the Angel takes his chair leans back
[1:20:58] towards the tent and Sarah lists
[1:20:59] listening through the tent you know she
[1:21:01] was eavesdropping
[1:21:04] through the tent and she was uh in an
[1:21:06] awful mood that morning
[1:21:09] you don't see things when you come to
[1:21:11] church in that kind of a mood
[1:21:13] you just no need of trying it you might
[1:21:16] as well have stayed home
[1:21:19] you won't get nothing out of it this is
[1:21:22] the prophet God's speaking says you
[1:21:25] don't see things when you come to church
[1:21:27] in that kind of a mood he says Sarah had
[1:21:30] been in the mood in that morning that's
[1:21:32] why she doubted the word
[1:21:34] she didn't believe what God says because
[1:21:36] of the mood she was in
[1:21:38] and here the prophet of God says you
[1:21:40] just don't try it you might as well just
[1:21:43] have stayed home
[1:21:45] and you won't get nothing out of it you
[1:21:48] won't get nothing out of the service
[1:21:50] when you come expect when you come
[1:21:52] expecting to see everything that's wrong
[1:21:55] when you come to church come prayed up
[1:21:58] come in the atmosphere come expecting so
[1:22:03] you have to pray when you are coming
[1:22:04] into church you remember on the day of
[1:22:07] Pentecost they sold tongues of fire each
[1:22:10] and everyone had a leak of fire above
[1:22:12] them so when you come to church the
[1:22:15] prophet of God tells us you come prayed
[1:22:18] up
[1:22:19] so that you come in with that atmosphere
[1:22:22] you bring your piece of atmosphere he
[1:22:25] brings his peer of atmosphere the sister
[1:22:27] brings in has a piece of atmosphere and
[1:22:30] well then when you come there is an
[1:22:32] awesome presence in the house of the
[1:22:34] Lord
[1:22:35] but why you come to church in a mood you
[1:22:38] don't even want to come to church
[1:22:40] whatever vessel you bring that's what
[1:22:43] fills up when you come with the critical
[1:22:45] vessel you're gonna go back with that
[1:22:47] vessel filled up you come to church
[1:22:50] Moody and you expect everything to go
[1:22:52] right you just fought at home you were
[1:22:55] just quarreling and arguing and you
[1:22:58] don't even pray and you're just coming
[1:22:59] straight into the chair into the house
[1:23:01] of God and You're Expecting
[1:23:04] to have a wonderful time
[1:23:06] the prophet of God said don't do that
[1:23:09] don't come to church in that kind of a
[1:23:11] mood make sure you come pray it up come
[1:23:14] in that atmosphere come expecting
[1:23:18] there is no way you're going to be
[1:23:20] blessed you come in Grumpy you just come
[1:23:22] in and sit there you fold your hands and
[1:23:24] you're just looking like you are grading
[1:23:27] the sermon and you're expecting God to
[1:23:29] speak to you and you're expecting a
[1:23:31] blessing that's not going to happen you
[1:23:34] need to bring your atmosphere you need
[1:23:37] to come pray it up and you say the song
[1:23:39] service was boring why because you came
[1:23:42] with a bad mood you came in Grumpy you
[1:23:45] were supposed to come and sing for
[1:23:47] yourself when the song leader is singing
[1:23:49] here he's he's conducting you to sing
[1:23:53] he's not singing a special to you
[1:23:56] you have to come in participate bring in
[1:23:59] your fire
[1:24:01] change that mood change that atmosphere
[1:24:04] remember we are creators we create an
[1:24:07] atmosphere
[1:24:08] demons can run out of this church
[1:24:11] by an atmosphere through the singing of
[1:24:14] songs demons can get out so you make
[1:24:17] sure when you come to church come pray
[1:24:19] it up
[1:24:20] amen
[1:24:29] and you probably when you come to church
[1:24:31] you probably come very late I mean
[1:24:33] Wednesday is different because we're all
[1:24:35] coming from
[1:24:36] work and a lot of different things but
[1:24:39] on a Sunday
[1:24:40] at least when you come late at least
[1:24:42] come pray it up but you come in late as
[1:24:45] almost you are ready to come and close
[1:24:46] in a word of Prayer
[1:24:48] and you're expecting to be blessed it
[1:24:51] does not work that way
[1:24:52] coming pray it up bring in your
[1:24:54] atmosphere
[1:24:56] Hallelujah Whatever You're Expecting
[1:24:59] that's what God will give you you're
[1:25:02] expecting the preacher to to to uh to
[1:25:05] jerk you up to Jack you into the
[1:25:07] atmosphere You're Expecting the song
[1:25:09] leader to take you out of your grumpy
[1:25:11] mood and put you into the atmosphere and
[1:25:13] say oh he took me from this to that no
[1:25:15] you have to pray you have to put an
[1:25:18] effort because God wants to speak to you
[1:25:23] there's a song that says put on the
[1:25:25] Garment of Praise And The Spirit of
[1:25:27] heaviness will flee away so at least if
[1:25:30] you are grumpy at least if you're in a
[1:25:32] bad mood come early so when the songs of
[1:25:35] Zion are being sung that Spirit of
[1:25:37] heaviness can flee away and then you can
[1:25:39] be delivered because in the house of the
[1:25:42] Lord there is Liberty when you come in
[1:25:45] here bound you are supposed to be set
[1:25:47] free the prophet of God says the house
[1:25:49] of the Lord is supposed to have an
[1:25:51] atmosphere such that when the sick
[1:25:53] people walk in they are supposed to get
[1:25:55] healed without even getting prayed for
[1:25:57] when someone comes in here with their
[1:25:59] burden
[1:26:00] through the singing of songs just the
[1:26:03] atmosphere and the church they're
[1:26:04] supposed to feel alleviated why because
[1:26:07] you brought your atmosphere because you
[1:26:09] came prayed up because you're expecting
[1:26:12] God to speak you are expecting God
[1:26:16] to do a miracle
[1:26:18] amen so brother sister
[1:26:22] we need to come expecting God to speak
[1:26:25] to us and whatever you expect that's
[1:26:28] what he will give to you Abraham was
[1:26:30] expecting that Miracle that's why when
[1:26:33] that word came and God told him is there
[1:26:35] anything too hard for me he didn't doubt
[1:26:37] it he just took it straight away but
[1:26:40] Sarah because he was not expecting it
[1:26:42] because of the mood she wasn't
[1:26:44] she doubted this is like there is no way
[1:26:47] that can happen and God does not like
[1:26:50] Disobedience to his word the prophet
[1:26:52] says God could have killed Sarah if it
[1:26:55] was not for Abraham
[1:26:57] but if you come expecting
[1:26:59] God will perform a miracle in your life
[1:27:02] he will grant you your heart's desire
[1:27:05] amen he will turn your night into
[1:27:08] mourning he will give you a dance he
[1:27:11] will give you Joy it will turn your
[1:27:13] sorrow into gladness
[1:27:15] when you come expecting because there is
[1:27:17] nothing that's too hard for him the
[1:27:20] right mental attitude to each and every
[1:27:23] of the God's word will bring all of his
[1:27:26] promises to come to pass in our lives
[1:27:29] amen let's turn upon our feet
[1:27:49] brother sister there is nothing that's
[1:27:51] too hard for the Lord
[1:27:52] [Music]
[1:27:54] if he did it for Abraham he can do it
[1:27:56] for you and me if he did it for Sarah he
[1:27:59] can do it for you and me remember Rachel
[1:28:02] was also barren
[1:28:04] foreign
[1:28:06] for Abraham because God needed for Sarah
[1:28:09] he did it also for Rebecca he did it for
[1:28:12] a Rachel and he opened up their walls
[1:28:16] because they believed in him and they
[1:28:19] believed that there is nothing that's
[1:28:22] too hard for him
[1:28:24] I don't know what you were dealing with
[1:28:27] but I know that God is the same
[1:28:30] yesterday today and forever he is the
[1:28:33] same he never changes if he did it
[1:28:36] before he can do it today brother kids
[1:28:39] gave his testimony earlier on I was
[1:28:41] blessed by it the doctor said he had
[1:28:44] cancer but when they chat they say there
[1:28:47] is no cancer Hallelujah and the doctor
[1:28:50] said God is still doing Miracles why
[1:28:53] because he is the same yesterday today
[1:28:55] and forever the doctors might say there
[1:28:57] is no cure for cancer but we have a
[1:29:00] living testimony right in front of us
[1:29:02] that God can do
[1:29:04] The Impossible he can do the things that
[1:29:08] people say is undoable things that's
[1:29:11] impossible he can do it amen
[1:29:14] problems that don't have a solution God
[1:29:17] will give you that solution why because
[1:29:20] he is a God who turns impossibilities to
[1:29:24] possibilities
[1:29:25] amen he gave Abraham and Sarah
[1:29:29] a child after waiting for 25 years
[1:29:32] something that we don't hear of old
[1:29:34] people getting getting babies that's
[1:29:37] impossible but God did it
[1:29:41] so if you have a desire this evening
[1:29:44] just say Lord I am no different from
[1:29:46] Sarah I am Abraham's son I was bought by
[1:29:51] your blood and I know when you said on
[1:29:54] that cross of Calvary it is finished
[1:29:59] of Abraham the when you say it is
[1:30:01] finished
[1:30:02] all your promises apply to me and I am
