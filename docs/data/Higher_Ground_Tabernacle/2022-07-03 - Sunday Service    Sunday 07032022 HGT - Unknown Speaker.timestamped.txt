[35:08] see
[35:44] daddy
[36:05] foreign
[36:52] foreign
[37:06] foreign
[37:16] five
[37:29] christ
[38:02] for
[38:27] it is
[39:54] man
[40:05] amen amen
[40:20] so
[41:01] as we were saying
[41:15] the billboard god's billboard
[41:28] so as i was meditating on what i had to
[41:30] preach
[41:43] we have to look um search where the
[41:45] spirit has to take us
[41:50] based on what has already been
[42:00] preached so we just pray that god gives
[42:03] us a message that can impact people's
[42:05] lives
[42:08] we don't just preach to preach
[42:16] but we pray so that we be taken in the
[42:18] spirit of god
[42:22] the little topic that we're going to
[42:24] talk about this morning
[42:26] it concerns all of us
[42:30] it doesn't concern just one person
[42:32] one brother or a sister
[42:35] it concerns every one of us
[42:40] and the good attitude that we're
[42:41] supposed to have
[42:56] to see if your life gets up to the word
[42:59] of god
[43:01] the word of god is not preached
[43:03] and when the word of god is preached
[43:07] you don't when someone when the word of
[43:08] god is preached you don't look at
[43:09] somebody else
[43:13] when the word of god preached you're
[43:15] saying you're always saying uh you're
[43:17] always looking at somebody else
[43:21] but when the word of god is preached
[43:24] it's always new
[43:27] you don't get used to the word of god
[43:34] that's why i want every one of us this
[43:35] morning
[43:38] to be careful
[43:41] it's a little sermon that's not going to
[43:43] take long
[43:49] if the lord helps us help us we can
[43:51] finish in 45 minutes
[44:06] its taste
[44:11] from where shall it be salted
[44:14] [Music]
[44:18] it's good for nothing but to be cast out
[44:20] and to be trolled trodden under food of
[44:22] man
[44:24] because imagine
[44:26] you have salt on your hands
[44:29] but you try to taste salt
[44:31] it doesn't have its savory
[44:37] what can you do with that salt to make
[44:39] it to to give back its savior
[44:42] it's no good for no for not for nothing
[44:44] just to be cast out
[44:47] no more
[45:02] that's why
[45:10] [Music]
[45:14] to be salted
[45:28] and that's why the lord says you are the
[45:30] salt of the earth
[45:37] [Music]
[45:58] you don't put the lights onto your back
[46:01] but you put it on the table
[46:05] you put it on the place where it can
[46:06] light up everybody
[46:11] we learned that jesus christ himself
[46:13] said he's the light of the world
[46:17] but jesus is not the only one that's the
[46:19] light of the world
[46:22] he says that we are also the lights of
[46:24] the world
[46:26] and when
[46:29] [Music]
[46:38] he has to light up those who are in
[46:40] darkness
[47:08] as he
[47:32] there are all kinds of
[47:34] things on the billboard women and all
[47:36] kinds of things
[48:18] that
[48:32] sometimes
[48:42] [Music]
[48:43] and it was well organized it had a good
[48:45] appearance on the billboard
[48:49] but when you actually get to the place
[48:51] that the billboard said that place
[48:52] existed
[48:54] they're gonna tell you know
[48:55] that's all you that's all you can see
[48:57] here
[48:59] but the advertisement remains
[49:10] does not exist no more
[49:16] just imagine you saw a good hamburger
[49:20] and that you're hungry you're you're
[49:22] craving for an amberger
[49:27] now looking at the the advertisement for
[49:30] that amber hamburger
[49:32] and now you're hungry to eat that embryo
[49:36] now you go to mcdonald's
[49:39] they tell you that there is no that
[49:41] hamburger will no we no longer have that
[49:43] hamburger here
[49:45] i think you're gonna tell them
[49:50] you're gonna ask them why did you leave
[49:51] that billboard there with that image
[49:54] you should have removed that image on
[49:56] the billboard
[50:21] [Music]
[50:22] now when the world will come to us
[50:28] [Music]
[50:35] when pagans will come to us
[50:38] when they will come to
[50:53] but the problem is that today
[50:57] when those the one who doesn't pray come
[50:59] to the believer
[51:02] where he was supposed to find peace
[51:06] where he was supposed to find the pizza
[51:08] joy of the heart
[51:11] where he was supposed to find all the
[51:12] virtues of god
[51:17] knowledge and patience
[51:20] but when he
[51:34] this thing was for peter and paul
[51:41] but we're supposed to be billboards of
[51:43] god
[51:46] all the virtues of god have to be found
[51:48] at us
[52:01] but i came to build individuals
[52:29] so that when pagans will come to them
[52:32] they will find all the virtues of god
[52:40] brother brother says here
[52:42] what i just told you it is
[53:12] christ
[53:24] of jesus christ
[53:43] [Music]
[54:08] that's why
[54:14] [Music]
[54:22] so that we become distributors of the
[54:23] word of god by his power
[54:28] that's the purpose of the the message
[54:30] the purpose why the message came
[54:35] that's why brother brethren says
[54:57] so that you understand that you are also
[54:59] messengers
[55:03] the messengers of this message that's
[55:05] what brother branham says
[55:14] there was one day
[55:19] [Music]
[55:45] and his boss organized a party like that
[55:52] because he had a lot of benefits in his
[55:55] business
[55:58] and as they gathered that morning
[56:01] that night
[56:03] and that they were playing
[56:07] or after making the
[56:09] lolo
[56:14] now brother says we had a little dinner
[56:16] they had a little dinner
[56:18] it's in the sermon
[56:20] thirst for life
[56:24] preached in 1960
[56:27] [Music]
[56:29] now he says they gave a little topic
[56:34] and then we had they had this little
[56:36] thing and everything
[56:38] and after everything was done
[56:42] the people um back backed up back down
[56:45] and his boss told him
[56:52] you can help back up because we're gonna
[56:54] have some um we're gonna have fun here
[56:58] and brother brown says
[57:01] what kind of uh fun are you going to
[57:03] have
[57:04] his boss told him
[57:08] is it going to bother you if you can go
[57:10] just stand at the door
[57:13] says he says
[57:17] this little the
[57:19] the the person told him brother brahman
[57:20] i believe you don't believe in dancing
[57:23] but those people here will dance
[57:38] [Music]
[57:50] and she ran in
[57:52] in the
[58:49] a comfort for for a person working at
[58:52] night
[58:53] and then she could play with her little
[58:55] children
[58:56] and then have a good life
[58:59] a good free life
[59:15] astonished to see the way this little
[59:18] girl was acting
[59:22] and she this little girl was running
[59:24] touching every man
[59:27] and she got back to me and said
[59:30] my voice
[59:40] you can hear me without the mic maybe
[59:59] all the every man there
[1:00:02] now she got back to brother
[1:00:05] and she told birth brother if you don't
[1:00:06] say can you dance with me
[1:00:10] brother brown says i said we might
[1:00:11] damage you
[1:00:12] yes yes madam i want to dance
[1:00:16] and she said well come dance with me
[1:00:20] and brother brown says i got to the the
[1:00:22] dancing floor
[1:00:23] and i said
[1:00:25] i i held her hand
[1:00:40] there is one thing that i used to that i
[1:00:42] always do
[1:00:43] before anything
[1:00:45] and we're going to do that
[1:00:49] but there is one thing that i always do
[1:00:52] before anything else shut up what is
[1:01:08] i
[1:01:21] then i told her about uh get on your
[1:01:24] knees and then i held her here
[1:01:27] and she couldn't do anything
[1:01:31] now we stopped that thing in just a
[1:01:33] couple minutes
[1:01:35] certainly
[1:01:36] brother branham
[1:01:46] and they took all their instruments
[1:01:49] their brother brown says i said
[1:02:03] you can fire me if you want to
[1:02:07] you can fire me if you want to take a
[1:02:09] second
[1:02:10] with whatever i just did
[1:02:13] i disturbed all your progress program
[1:02:15] here
[1:02:17] but his one
[1:02:23] [Music]
[1:02:45] i always pray before doing anything
[1:02:48] that's the question that i'm going to
[1:02:50] ask everyone
[1:02:53] before doing one thing
[1:02:56] do you always pray
[1:03:14] it's very easy to see a brother in the
[1:03:16] restaurant
[1:03:18] ordering food
[1:03:19] and then it starts eating
[1:03:24] brother brothers
[1:03:46] tries to eat when the pork tries to eat
[1:03:51] he's only going to eat it
[1:03:53] he never looks up
[1:03:55] where the apples come from
[1:04:04] [Music]
[1:04:24] they don't pray no more
[1:04:28] we're ashamed of the masses
[1:04:31] we're ashamed to pray
[1:04:37] to identify ourselves as christians
[1:04:40] because we are we have we are ashamed
[1:04:45] our boss we don't want our boss to know
[1:04:47] that we're christians
[1:04:50] we don't want our friends to know that
[1:04:52] we're christians
[1:05:05] because those who represented
[1:05:06] christianity
[1:05:20] but when christianity was christianity
[1:05:23] caring the name of the christians
[1:05:26] was a great responsibility
[1:05:29] and it was joy
[1:05:33] the christians
[1:06:02] samson was raised
[1:06:04] [Music]
[1:06:05] to destroy the nation of the first time
[1:06:10] but because he forgot who he was
[1:06:13] that nation destroyed himself
[1:06:28] the thing that god raised us foreign
[1:06:52] [Music]
[1:07:08] and you're gonna see the caller uh how
[1:07:11] he gets mad
[1:07:32] [Music]
[1:07:39] he should be the one that's the nicest
[1:07:41] person on earth
[1:07:44] it's a sweetest person on it because he
[1:07:46] represents christ
[1:07:49] christ was a gentleman a judge a man of
[1:07:52] 33 years old they they they
[1:08:21] and as christ
[1:08:22] was screaming as he was crying
[1:08:26] the angels told him
[1:08:27] but master
[1:08:29] the marston just do a sign just do it
[1:08:32] just point something and we're gonna
[1:08:34] destroy the earth
[1:08:35] because you cannot suffer like that
[1:08:38] jesus told them
[1:08:41] you don't know
[1:08:44] what the son of man came to do
[1:08:47] the son of man did not come here to lose
[1:08:50] but he came
[1:09:04] it was
[1:09:17] just raise your hand like that
[1:09:30] the son of a man did not come to loose
[1:09:46] christianity
[1:10:09] that they recognize that they were
[1:10:11] disciples of christ
[1:10:14] but
[1:10:14] today the love that we face
[1:10:18] it's just a a simulated love
[1:10:23] christian is on everything
[1:10:26] they're criticizing gossip
[1:10:28] they're
[1:10:41] christian was supposed to be the most
[1:10:42] respected person in the society
[1:10:49] the christian would should identify
[1:10:51] himself with a good education
[1:10:54] because outside of the school that he
[1:10:56] had
[1:11:23] find problems with you
[1:11:38] without even going to the word
[1:11:44] there are some pagans unbelievers that
[1:11:47] when their brother is angry they know
[1:11:49] that they have to refrain themselves
[1:11:53] their drug problem so
[1:11:56] they resolve big issues without even
[1:11:58] going to the word
[1:12:02] but what about us
[1:12:06] no problem how much how much issues can
[1:12:09] we resolve
[1:12:11] with all humility
[1:12:14] with all peace
[1:12:20] i am ashamed
[1:12:46] she's falling
[1:12:50] and we're just looking at it
[1:12:54] when you try to
[1:12:56] when you try to show something to your
[1:12:58] brother or your sister
[1:13:00] they will always give you reasons
[1:13:09] christianity of today have produced a
[1:13:11] lot of intellectuals more than
[1:13:13] christians
[1:13:14] real christians
[1:13:28] and there is intellectual christianity
[1:13:41] we're talking about the face of the
[1:13:43] heart
[1:13:54] who can live like that again
[1:13:58] [Music]
[1:14:00] who can accept that somebody takes his
[1:14:02] beer
[1:14:04] like jesus christ accepted it
[1:14:07] that they spit on you
[1:14:10] who can accept that today
[1:14:26] in the good way what did you say paul
[1:14:29] was saying
[1:14:32] in hebrew chapter 12
[1:14:34] he said no
[1:14:36] he said we
[1:14:37] also
[1:14:39] know
[1:14:52] and sin that's that beset
[1:15:34] there's always someone that's trying to
[1:15:36] get an influence from me
[1:15:38] that's what paul was saying
[1:15:43] because we're so compassed with the
[1:15:45] clouds of witnesses
[1:15:47] let us lay aside every way
[1:16:24] [Music]
[1:16:33] it's not the word of god anymore
[1:16:36] it's not the sermons anymore
[1:16:42] it's not the sermons
[1:16:56] but if we act just like the world
[1:17:11] that's why the church is without power
[1:17:17] that's why the church is now full of
[1:17:19] intellectuals more than christians
[1:17:25] the world is tired
[1:17:28] they're tired
[1:18:10] don't let anything uh dirty come in
[1:18:15] my little children
[1:18:18] pleading
[1:18:19] [Music]
[1:18:22] don't let anything defiled come to
[1:18:51] during the dark ages
[1:18:53] [Music]
[1:19:04] because of god
[1:19:06] yeah
[1:19:20] you know the story
[1:19:49] was was uh running
[1:19:52] they were taking pregnant women
[1:19:56] they will split their stuff their
[1:19:58] stomach and take their child
[1:20:01] just because of the word
[1:20:30] because they were defending the values
[1:20:32] of christians
[1:20:34] the only thing they did wrong
[1:20:37] was to believe in jesus christ
[1:20:39] that's why they killed him
[1:20:42] but today of us today
[1:20:54] so that you don't represent the word
[1:20:56] in the good way
[1:21:24] that contains the blood of your sisters
[1:21:26] and brothers
[1:21:38] so that we betray the world
[1:22:08] what testimony are you going to have
[1:22:11] what are you going to tell when you
[1:22:12] stand in front of those people that lost
[1:22:14] their lives because of the word
[1:22:20] my brothers and sisters
[1:22:34] and when blood will dry out on your
[1:22:36] veins
[1:22:57] [Music]
[1:23:03] what testimony is going to come behind
[1:23:05] you
[1:23:10] what works are you going to leave in
[1:23:12] your life
[1:23:14] are you going to leave on this earth
[1:23:31] i would have left that for my children
[1:23:34] maybe if i had a bear
[1:23:37] i would have left it for my children
[1:23:40] maybe if i had a wrenches
[1:23:43] i would have left that for myself
[1:23:46] but i don't possess all the goods of
[1:23:48] this world
[1:23:50] the only thing i can leave for my
[1:23:52] children
[1:23:53] of one thing i'm certain enough is the
[1:23:55] word of god
[1:23:57] because it's eternal
[1:24:28] bankrupt
[1:24:31] all those things
[1:24:33] this wrench can burn
[1:24:40] but the thing the only thing that's
[1:24:41] going to stay eternally is the word of
[1:24:43] god
[1:24:46] that's why us as parents
[1:24:50] we have to be responsible for every act
[1:24:52] we make because we have children behind
[1:24:54] us who are looking at us
[1:25:05] the parents will carry the burden of
[1:25:07] every action they did on earth
[1:25:15] [Music]
[1:25:24] he would always
[1:25:25] [Music]
[1:25:37] and as he was doing that
[1:25:40] his boy his little boy also tried to
[1:25:42] imitate him he also tried to walk just
[1:25:44] like him
[1:25:46] no the dead the father stopped and he
[1:25:47] said
[1:25:48] he said oh son why are you doing this
[1:25:51] the son told him
[1:26:14] [Music]
[1:26:33] the responsibility that we have as
[1:26:48] a true love
[1:26:50] they need to find that love
[1:26:54] without hypocrisy
[1:27:02] a
[1:27:12] we may stand
[1:27:25] you can
[1:27:26] give a song

[1:34:18] coming to to your your throne of grace
[1:34:24] to ask for your grace
