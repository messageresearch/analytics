we're so happy to be here this evening and uh just about to spend a good time with the Lord amen let's open our Bibles in the Book of Job we'll read the uh chapter 33 verse 27 to 30. Job chapter 33 verse 20. job it's right before Psalms generally if your staff owners description amen the Bible says he looked upon man and if any say I have sinned and pervert and perverted that which was right and he profited me not investment city is all from going into the pit just life shall seek the light in it low on these things worketh God oftentimes with man to bring back his soul from the peat to be enlightened with the light of the living is let's turn to Romans chapter 5. verse 8 we are say wheat it's a very familiar chapter and verse foreign Romans chapter 8 or uh let's start from verse 1. Romans chapter 5 verse 1 to verse 8. when the Bible says that therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ but whom also we have access by faith into his into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God um and not only so but with glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patients and patience experience and experience hopefully perseverance verse 5 and I hope maketh not a shame because of love because the love of God is shared abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us persons for when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly for scarcely for a righteous man will won't die yet her adventure for a good man some would even Dare To Die Apen but God commendeth his love toward us well we were yet sinners Christ died for us amen let's continue verse more than being now justified by his blood which shall be saved from wrath through him I prefer is Heavenly Father Lord come before Eternal Grace this evening Lord just to say Thank You Lord thank you for everything that you have done Lord thank you for everything that you're doing for us thank you for everything that you would do foreign tonight we have a really small subject I wanted to share with you Allah we intellige the magnitude of the love of God teach you later that magnitude amen I was trying to find uh titles I couldn't come up with one so uh when we uh the musician came to the room there and I'll call him musicians but at first I gave lists uh another title and then the thought just came to me I was like hey why not talk about the magnitude of it is so that's what we'll be talking about hello and then we'll see wherever God will bring us amen because we just want to be under his leadership it went to start I will start with the short story that most of us know hello I think in the message [Music] there is here greater than Solomon yeah I can't remember I was listening to this today and it's the story of him and one of his friends they usually go hunt together and his friend he kills animals or deers just for fun amen he knew exactly that the brother Branham didn't like you know when he was doing that but he was doing that on purpose yeah man he was doing that on purpose because he knew that brother Brennan didn't like it if it is so every time that they will go together that man would just kill deers for fun would just joke with them and shoot at them and things anymore and brother Brennan would tell him we're asking about why do you do this and he will say well I'm pretty sure if you were in a pasture you will be doing the same thing yeah if you were in the pasture or a preacher you'll be doing the same thing killing animals and just living there so it happens there is this uh day that they went out and you know hunting and and also evangelo's instrument that was imitating the the sound of the little deer alone so when he was doing the the mom will come to look for you know thinking that it's his baby that uh that's in trouble so he will come she will come to try to help him out uh man amen so he will come and try to see if there is uh one of the little deer is in trouble or not yeah so it happened that when he did that and and the deer saw the gun and then turned back hey this is when she came as close as just she called and once you saw the gun and then she turned back and then you're starting doing the same notes again remember and brother Brennan said that normally that deer will go back and will never turn back if you think she will go back she will fly and she will go as far away as she can the love of a mother that she had amen every time that that man was making that noise she was coming back amen she was coming back to make sure that one of her kids are not is not in trouble even happened that brother Branham was praying for him because he was like Lord this is really mean and he started praying for him saw how the love of their mother amen seeing the gun but she was still coming to them the Bible says that can a woman forget her sucking child that you should not have compassion on the son of her wombly yet will I not forget thee Memoir behold I have gravity upon the palms of my hands their walls are continually before me can a woman forget her sucking child that's good can a woman forget her baby it doesn't matter how long she's been away from that kid two important amen she will always remember that there is a time I had a son or a daughter that I gave away and cause that love is there with a little Bond it will be there forever the Bible said that even if that happens amen but the love of God for you will never God will never forget you know amen the love of God will never forget because himself he has grown you upon the palms of his hands could remember amen he has Graven you upon the palms and you will always be there with him amen that is the love of God that is the love of God he doesn't matter what you do amen you are craving in this land amen you are there every time you'll be looking at it it will think of you amen that is the love of God Amen that is why God died new amen the prophet says that one amen sin the prophet when men sin the Garden of Eden he crossed the great chairs from separating himself from Eternal one is man at that time was eternal with God he had no sickness sorrow or death man was not made to die hell was not made for men hair was created for the devils and not for mankind because they were created on Earth to be Sons and Daughters of God but when men seen and stepped across the bondering line the boundary line between remind he separated himself from God leaving himself no way back he says he was totally lost he could not come back because he had sin and when the prophet continues and said that by God rich and mercy the prophet the judge accepted the substitute have accepted teacher because he had said the day you eat thereof that day you will die and God's justice and his Holiness requires death because it's because it is his word and he must keep his words and now amen no the love that he had for the human race and yet had to see them separated from him and the fellowship that he had with his children in the Garden of Eden Community broken condition that he has had to be in the in in all the in all that time conditions because his word said the day you eat that day you will die amen God it was the one who gave the word amen by because of his love he created this aptitude amen the Lamb's blood was there for his aptitude amen because of the magnitude of the love of God do that magnitude he didn't want to see his creation to be separated he didn't want to see you and me being lost amen he didn't want to see us amen being away from him it was for us since advanced amen he will see the threefold of God's love to the church when you would see that in this verse in these three verses that we are about to read when you see that the love of God for the church was in the past present and the future verse 27 verse 25. Ephesians the Bible says that husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and give himself for it amen if you look at the word love this in the past amen that's the first he loved the church and by loving the church pushed him to give himself for for the church verse 26 verse that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the of the Water by the word amen he might sanctify the church and clean the church with the washing of the Water by the word amen that's what he's doing right now cleansing the church things that you used to do you do them foreign foreign foreign I think of you that's why he didn't give up because he was thinking of you amen that's why he didn't take the cars cause he was thinking about it because you wanted to see you by himself because he wanted you to build with him he endured all everything that's why he endured all democracies he can't be written down in the very boy the Bible nobody can explain it even the prophet when he was preaching about Allah he said I'm just gonna take a little portion try to stay in that portion of that portion that he was explained that himself couldn't tell at all the entire Bible still doesn't cover the entire levels all the trees and try to amen he created Casey there was the next morning got up and there was some little Wafers laying over all over all over the ground down the Man Out Of Heaven that's a very that's a very that's a very beautiful type of Christ coming down from heaven to that on the earth to perish on Earth he might rescue the the perishing amen he was Heavenly

with him less [Music] live the thing live the rest to him let's do the let's do it man he will do the entire thing let's let's keep fighting fast too because there are men will never rest amen amen and God will never rest until you are with him so you just rest hello hello that's the purpose of his love amen that's why that's the reason why we sing that song of Victory in Jesus amen because I heard enough stories amen there was a savior amen who came from glory amen that savior he came down here on Earth amen he gave his life on Calvary he like donations to save the violence of the Sinners

else person nobody else could have come and people thought I was a lost cause amen people thought that it was done for me Jean Paul that I would not even be a church one day went there if you're new to look for me when Adam and Eve were lost used to come I don't have men hiding themselves the love of God Allah foreign foreign their love of God said I'm ordered you one day he found me he sent one of my friends to come to talk to me Amen to talk to me about him that's when I give my life amen because the Allah didn't care about the word I didn't know anything about it knew exactly where I was amen his love knew exactly what I needed knew exactly what my name was and he called me by my name and I had to respond to this from that time from that time amen I can sing the video foreign how rich come on rich the love of God it's measureless it's so strong amen you can save a sinner the love of God that more the Jew it was because of his life amen the Bible says in John chapter 3 verse 16. for God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son see that donation foreign it meant to die for you that you by believing in him amen you will be saved amen you will not be perished but you will be saved amen that's that is the love of God now the prophet says here in the Lamb of the lamb and the Lord um the remedy is this is now he hasn't flew very far hello he just flew up right out on the tree just ahead of you there it is longing and waiting to see a time when you're just surrender yourself hello guys come back to my heart again amen God is waiting for you hello he gave his love to the world they made fun of it they're rejected it is but all of that was for a purpose the World by doing that they thought that this this would take care of this it's nailed on the cross and that we should never talk about it but they didn't know that what they were doing it was just God wanted them to do that because if he didn't die on the cross you're like what I wouldn't be safe I wouldn't be here the purpose because notice that in the Old Testament us Gentiles we were not even allowed to go to the town amen there were no place for us there were no rooms for us in the temple uh foreign amen he says that the remedy is this you just be the language God is still the dog God doesn't change his love will never change nature will never change no he hasn't gone very far hello it's just there on the tree just ahead of you it is longing and he's went to see a time when you were just um when we started with the word uh in in the job 27 33 27. he says that he looketh upon man and if any say I have sinned and and perverted that which was right he would deliver his soul from going into the pit and his life shall see the light though all these things worketh God often times with men to bring back his soul from the pit to be enlightened with the light with it because a man looks at himself and said Lord I have sinned I have prevented that was right correct and I didn't take any profit of it is right now remember he's there longing and waiting waiting for that time when you will say oh precious death of God oh pleasures and my dad always come back to my heart come back to my
