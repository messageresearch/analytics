evening may the Lord bless them especially with a great sacrifice the cubanos family is going through somewhat a crisis over there in in the Congo some issues going on there where they're going to meet all on not only your prayers but your financial support and help if you can the sister who underwent a operation some years ago and they're just finding out that the doctors sewed her intestine to her stomach and she has several children they've got to operate on her and it's looking pretty bad but God is more than able so if you want to understand more detail you can ask our sisters she could tell them tell you and I told her that it would be fine to make an announcement on just coming Sunday morning as well as we stand we ask that you turn with us to Isaiah the 14th chapter as you have 14 and then we'll read psalm 6i there 14 beginning at the 12th verse how r dot fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the nation's but thou have said in thine heart I will ascend into the heavens and when I exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation and in the size of the north I will ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the Most High yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the size of the pit they that see the shall narrowly look upon thee and consider these saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble that did shake kingdoms that made the world as a wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that opened not the house of his prisoners all the kings on the nations even of them lying glory every one is in his own house but thou art cast out of that grave like an abominable wrench and as the remnant arraignment of those that are slain thrust through with the sword that go down to the stones of the pit as a caucus trodden on the feet Psalm sweet Psalm 6 beginning at the 6th verse Psalm 6 beginning at the six verse six and eight blessed be the Lord who have not given us as a prey to their teeth our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the Fowler the snare is broken and we are escaped our help is in the name of the Lord who made heaven and earth let us pray thank you sir father God we come before your Lord we thank you for your amazing grace father we pray that you forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness Lord we pray father God that the service this evening would be a blessing to all the heroes father may may may may the word of God fall on good ground Lord here in our Des Moines in Iowa we have been experiencing a lot of rain and all we ask Oh God if that that you would allow your rain to fall into this place Lord give us that spiritual rain that I help us to grow and mature bless us now tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated as we look around the world we can see by God's grace that the world is in a mess whether you want to look at from look at it from the spiritual aspect social aspect whatever it may be people are looking for some type of way of escape the reason why we are in this mess it's because of Lucifer we do understand by God's grace he lured or deceived Eve and because of that the world is now in chaos my subject tonight is Satan's mess or the mess of Satan when we think about a mess we think about something that is dirty untidy or disorderly conditioned like for example young people they like to keep a messy room but when a room is in a mess is not of the Lord because God is of order and we used to say this so probably when we were in the denominational Church sanctification is how do we say the holiness is sanctification or sanctification is holiness basically when you are sanctified that's the next step to holiness and so God loves order he loved for things to be in order when the earth was in a mess and it was in chaos God by His Word set things in order set things in place so things could be clearly seen and recognized and that's the way we are to be when the Holy Spirit come upon us it brings us order it literally brings sanctification with that now we look at this thing and we think to ourselves I say it like this have you ever been in a place and exactly you know I try to keep my car clean but there are times it gets a little disarrayed and you know you get a little embarrassed when you see a little bit of trash and somebody's coming in your heart into your car you so forgive me man ID you know what what is that it because we are like God there are things about us that that it reflects God and God loves to have things in order the only time this world became disarrayed was when Allen Eve strayed from the word understand we are now experiencing chaos disorder even in the world that that's trying to be orderly everything is just a mess nobody knows what to do and throughout all history people have tried to straighten things out or make it easy but God's way is the only way to put things in its proper place if you have a mess understand that Satan is the author of confusion and God is the only one that can straighten out that confusion Satan has always tried to mimic God and mind you because many of us have gone into situation as we may call man it was just a mess I don't even know how I got out of that mess well you know David described it as a horrible pit when you think about a pit there is no light in the pit except that which is coming from above and the only way that you can ask access that light is to look up that's how it is with you are in a mess when situations are in such a place where it's so disorderly how to controlling you don't know what to do that's when you look to order here for which cometh your hell we know by God's grace that when when you and I get to heaven it is not gonna be any filth there everything that's going to be holy everything is going to be in place and guess what none of the Angels will be confused on what they're there for neither will you you won't have to clock in to find out what the boss wants you to do for that day because is in God by way of his own mind you would have his mind you will know his thoughts just like Adam News God's thought in the beginning when he named the animals Adam never had to ask God what to name them because he and God was so connected they were in such an order the head of man is Christ and the head of Christ is God right just that art of communication no one had to write a letter or do a phone call it was automatically sit down and they caught it that's how it is with a prophet a prophet amen is so connected with God he can hear God when he thinks and when he hear God think is not just God thinking it becomes a word right oh it may not even make sense but but but they're so connected till he speaks what he hears is that right and that's the way God wants us to be remember the story the prophet of God talks about when he was on that field trip when he was on that little trip and God told him there was gonna be a little resurrection of a little animal think about it and his question was not how it's going to happen it was wind we're not if he heard the voice of God and when that opportunity came for him to speak light to the fish he did it and the fish came to life now you say well what do you mean why are you saying all of these things because I'm telling you tonight Satan is the author of confusion and if he can take your piece away he has disconnected you with God all you're gonna hear is static because you have been disconnected with the voice of God and when he he he he brings forth the static what does man knew he leaves to his own understanding and God said lean not to your own understanding that means if I'm not supposed to lean to my own understanding that means there must be someone who should be talking to me and communicating with me that someone is God because when he communicates and talks with me I don't have to lean to my own understanding I'm leaning to what he wants me to do see it's a mess and this is why we are the way we are we know by God's grace in the beginning you know after the fall man always tried to outdo God but think about it God is perfection you can't get any higher than that but the devil always see things that God has and he tries to bring it down to earth and says that's mine I created that no you perverted that think about how Satan at the beginning when when when when mankind fell he he established this Babel and Babylon which was one of the major cities the big cities that that was in China and then we find out that he he did what he tried to pattern the God are the after God's heaven he's new heaven and is that right according to the book of Revelation we know that the that's the life the stream of life the river of life were flowing from under the throwning and that's the way he designed babylon babylon was once called the gate of god it was beautiful go look it up if you find any kind of historical pictures of what people imagine babylon to be you see all the Hanging Gardens and understand there's 12 ways to the city and there's Gardens on every level and the River of Life flows under the throne of God it's beautiful the birds are singing the flowers are blooming and this is what he tried to establish but guess what he was evil there is no other way to say it and out of Babylon that you can find Babylon Amen that what I'm talking about in the book of Genesis but we find out that these this way of this man you know it started out with Nimrod from Nimrod it went with two Nebuchadnezzar from never never cogniser it went to best advantage hence I invented chess I was the real proud one they all were they had that little in their DNA but this one bet the chance I should have known better because he's seeing what God had done to his father's grandfather had him out there eating like an animal because he lifted himself up that that sounds funny see because when you connect it with God you don't get lifted you understand who you are and what you are it's only when you leave to your own understanding and think that what you are doing is because of you and you have these abilities on your own no God gives you everything every good and perfect gift comes from God hmm momentum tells us that everything that is only earth today in the way of spirit two things such as the Spirit of God and the Spirit of the devil and all the cults and everything that we have today in the world they began in Genesis and Genesis means the beginning and all those things yet under another name on another form but the same spirit that begin in Genesis bring it out and it's just like the tree growing coming up to a head where it will come to a climax in the end for the great judgment of God is that right it started with tree it started with the Tree of Life it started with the tree of good and evil hello and what's happening now we are now seeing the tree of good and evil flourish it looks like the tree of life doesn't exist anymore but we know it does but God must allow this tree of knowledge of good and evil to flourish to bring forth his purpose in who you and me and like I said he brought a mess Babylon was a type of today's world all these great men a men that think there's something must know that one day they must answer for the deeds done in the flesh nebuchadnezzar failed to Chezza whoever you he was a meant that none of them understood that they was going to answer before God until God raised up a prophet by the name of Daniel in Daniels and Word of God for that day you see God let you walk in ignorance but once the word comes in that day the day of ignorance is over the Bible said amen that God was winked egg England that means that God would alive things that happened and wouldn't bring such a harsh judgment but once the word would come you see before God could even send a flood he had to send Noah Noah had to preach warning had to come right and we find the same thing happening by the time God it was such a mess it was such chaos and then the god the Buzzard that God repented that he made man hallelujah there's none righteous the Bible says no not one so without Jesus Christ even though God has every right to destroy this world but God fixed it think about the mercy of God he fixed it so that he himself could not even cross over the bloodline he failed it by his own the blood of his own son so that he himself could not come through to judge the world hey that's why it's important to stay under the blood and like I said even Babylon was founded with Nimrod and Nimrod was a dictator in all the cities in whatever log that was around that place a man had to bring tiling into Nimrod it was a force system it was a system Amen that that mandated the cooperation of those countries and cities and tribes or whatever was that was around him sound interesting because that same sea still lives today and the same thing that they dealt with is what we're dealing with but now it's picking up speed key Nimrod might be dead but the Spirit that anointed him live still is that all right I'm saying all that he sings because I'm a brother come to America in a moment not just America but the whole world is in a mess because we believe that this stuff like science is the answer but you and I understand where it all came from it was after the fall right it was Cain who moved outside of the presence of God and all of his offspring began to build that's the word but what they were doing they instead of her and God desired God desire was that the sons of God will replenish but it wasn't the sons of God that replenish the earth it was the sons of it of the devil it was the serpent that replenished and even as it was in that day it is now it is the Serpent's who I have replenish the earth look around your people of God you have no idea that's why the people live the way they live that's why they do what they do because of the CG that they carry you ought to be so thankful that God chose you and selected you in this day and separated you by the word teen is the word that separates us from them when Adam and Eve could not touch or eat of the Tree of Life thanks be to Calvary because God has allowed us in our state to eat of the tree because the Bible said if you eat up the tree you'll never die you'll live forever but what did God do in that garden he put a flaming sword cherubims right and then with that but he said what do you mean war was on you don't carry a sword if there is no war and those angels were saying from that point on there is war in earth there's law in earth the war that once was in heaven has now come down to her there's war in earth and you can't get to this tree know anybody can't get here that that's what Satan thought he hadn't incorporated himself into the human race so he thought by getting there he could get to the Tree of Life but no sir God fixed it hallelujah he had a angels there with flaming swords keeping the way think about it a mass and now God is straightening out the mess hallelujah and guess what we start with he stars with his own sons and daughters because once we are straightening out the world itself will be straightened young God is not going to produce a holy world with a sinful people all sin must be dealt with and done away with before the New Jerusalem comes down hmm I don't know whether you are enjoying this but I am now you got to realize that everything that that happened was because of a straying when the family strays away from the word is chaos when the church strays away from the word it's a mess when politics strays away from the word it's a mess it's chaos only the Word of God can keep it straight only the Word of God are you hallelujah that's why the Bible said Abraham would teach his children if we don't teach them they will be strained they will stray and guess what you will have a dysfunctional chaotic family you see it all it all connects Lucifer plan was to take the sons of God and make them servant to him he wanted to rule over them but God had a book that he put every one of their names in that book before the foundation of the world to do what to protect them from Lucifer's purpose and plan oh yes sir think about it the Bible said we all were once children around we had the appearance for the random said we was a kookabura with the wheat genome inside thank God for the weak gene God sold that seed in you because he knew that seed would bring order in your life hallelujah is not him that will it no he that runs but his God who shows mercy it is the seed demon you that literally brings order in your life you can try all you want to you can bring your religion like Cain did he thought his religion was going to do your religion won't work God don't care if you can quote this Bible up and down back and forward you still got to be born again hallelujah come on somebody who could outdo the Pharisees of Jesus day oh we look like some dumb fella and then next to those kind of those people if they stop quoting the Old Testament I knew we can't even caught one or two but they could quote the Bible they took the whole scroll and they had to die and children tiddle everything they couldn't miss not even appeared on comma think about it they spent their entire life day after day of the day of the day memorizing and repeating and getting these things so into their hearts or into the minds and it meant nothing because when Jesus came he told them the only way we can defeat Satan's plan is that you must be born again you can't be of this world because this world is a part of his system and his system is a mess and as long as you're part of his system I don't care how often you try to make it right you're gonna be a mess until God comes and straighten it you got to be born again hmm think about it look even in that day people joked about God you know how he is what was lacking Sampson when Sampson was was being ridiculed they joked about it hmm it showed things were out of order the Philistines made mockery and that's how yesterday America's doing the same thing they make light the word Jesus Christ they mark us in the Bible they they they make movies about us making fun of us but they don't realize they're making fun of God not us we're not the ones that out of order there at all whoa think about it it had gotten so bad amen that that the world itself had become an abomination to God vile shameful detestable it'll kind of remind me of that smell when I came in here something's leaking something's out of order you understand me and it's amazing amen because we've tried to report it you know you know I wouldn't be myself nothing is being done at this point but my point is until someone comes to repair it is going to continue and get worse now all Brotherhood's what are you saying when God came in the day of Noah he came to repair but they rejected the one who could repair it when God came in this day in Jesus day Jesus came to repair it because the scientific world the educational world the intellectual world amen had made this Church of God stray away from God they got into Crees and got into dogmas is that right listen they they knew the word but the Word of God said Jesus example you left off the weight of your things love mercy and grace all these good things the real the real character you've left them off you practice it and you look pretty good but God is not making robots God a man is making a people into his image and his likeness abdominal detestable stench in God's nostrils you see because God's Way is the only way and there's only one way I don't care what they say Buddha and Allah and Muslims stuff that means nothing to God they had all of that in Nimrods day Babylon had all of that worshipping of the moon and the stars and killing babies and all that that's nothing new Solomon said there's nothing new Under the Sun everything that has been is now so you and I must realize they meant we're in a mess and God has provided a way but well it's a web is actually a web of Satan let me say like this rest is a weapon by God did you know that when God gives you rest Satan don't know what to do with you hmm the enemy hates it because a man he wants to stress you out he wants to occupy you but you at peace you at rest he can't handle rest he likes it when he can disturb you that right look at the Sun the storms how beautiful it is when he's not around heaven but look what he does he like to tear up things the tornados that we've been having that's the way he is he love a mess you think there's healing order in hell I don't think so the Satan himself is not an orderly God or person everybody is running everywhere running from this will and running from that one people has no idea hell is not just an imagination of your mind it is a real place it is a dimensional world where people are tormented day and night but the worms never die we can't even imagine what it's like and definitely don't want to go there but you and I must understand by God's grace amen we're seeing what Satan has done look at look at see how the tree is growing there used to be like you had a city here Sodom you had a city of Gomorrah you had your North day just a little places on the earth that were really polluted Calpurnia you know places like that the whole world wasn't like that but now the tree has grown it's flourishing huh hello the Tree of Knowledge is good at y'all believe that let's think about a hundred years ago 200 years ago look at the communication system then versus now why because God said knowledge would increase men would run to and fro all of this thing is is running this thing into the end time and think about it in such a dark time God is developing a bride a people that would defeat Satan in his own Eden he defeated he defeated Adam and Eve and had them straight away but now there's another bride and brother Brendan said this bride will not fail he's afraid of you because he knows you're here and he can't stop you he tries to him to you he tries to distract you but he failed to see once that seed is quicken oh there's no stopping why because that seed is not us seed is God in you something about the Holy Ghost I can't explain it all I know is that when the Holy Ghost truly comes in you lose desires things of the world you lose without even missing them come on somebody think about it we're living in an age that's called later see the Bible said there be rich and really good they'll be naked and don't know it and y'all know this scripture that scripture was written hundreds of years ago and now what we know we see how can people dress like that look oh my me it's just amazing and they don't know they're naked it's hard to believe it but I must believe because the Bible said they don't know so therefore they don't know but they're running around and and the clothing is getting smaller and smaller and the Prophet God said chill with fig leaves before it's all over hello don't go to the beach fig leaves are there but they're wearing them in grocery stores and all of that things are happening all the Lord I seen what I saw something that was so wrong anyway let's go on it becomes a spinch now I'm coming to something here because y'all think Satan is going this this sit back I said well you know there's nothing I can do no he's a warrior he's kind of like like what they said up to David David this this Goliath has been a warrior from his youth and every time I think about Goliath I think about Satan who began his rep rebel rebelling when he was I don't know he that's all he knows now and who can defeat Satan you think you can do it know that one of us in here can defeat Satan it takes God it takes to Lord Jesus Christ it takes the same so if see if we could do it God with a toll Adam and he'd stand by the tree guard me but they they had no power God had to dispatch angels with swords hello and those angels was also a shout at a type of a preacher with the sword he's the only one with the sword and now he's not the only one is what I'm saying but I what I'm saying he protects you or the world protects you through his mouth hallelujah but now God has given each and every one of us the saw heart because he is now calling us kings and priests people of God see where we are look what God has done for us but if you don't believe it it won't work if you don't believe it it won't work without faith as I spoke last week it's impossible to please God is that right you don't believe it say God help my unbelief God made Gideon a believer huh he was really a coward pretty much but God call him thy mighty man availa hah he hated Satan system y'all don't hit his system I hate it this man over here making $30 an hour I'm making fire but you see all his system is developed to keep everybody divided it is also there to promote pride you know that's what it is it's always been designed to keep man against each other and when he couldn't get to the jobs he went to color somebody's the truth he anything he can do to keep people divided he knows that he's got them conquered anything Satan can do to keep the church divide it he knows he has them conquered that's why God didn't say when the church didn't want to call he said 2 or 3 is gathered in my name there the church that's what you will and it shall be given unto you two or three hey somebody then brother Adam come along with the message just get me one give me one man give me one man but man in the hand of God he can turn the city upside down hallelujah hey somebody does all we me even we need somebody who's going to be convicted enough to know that this is our day in our hour but we must stay connected we must stay connected by way the word by way of prayer and by way of listening to the messages because if we stay connected we can hear it we're hear him say things to us we're here we'll get that we'll get that inspiration and we won't have to question is that God because we'll know within ourselves somehow we know it in ourselves that is the voice of God when the Lord told brother and said oh that squirrel is good judge this question is a is that you Lord know there was something on in here why because of God in him Amen to God that was speaking to him yes the way people they don't understand like you know everything is to become so abominable not know order to nothing everybody's doing whatever will whatever make you happy just do it and the devil said yeah whatever make it make you feel good do it because when you get the hell you won't feel good right he'd given him all their feelings now the brother cries ain't worried about feelings she's more concerned about her faith her steadfastness in doing what he's saying Satan is a stalker see that we got stalkers in the world a young man just called me the other day and told him told me that that this this this lady was talking here yeah they stopped they should stalk me with house in high school that if I want anything to say but it's true even then they did it so what about now see if you see the way people act you understand Satan spirit because they are noted by him to do what they're doing and he must have stopped Eve even him in the in the beginning he waited to a time he saw that was she was vulnerable and that's the way the devil does where does he hid the Christian most of all when you're tired you weak that's when the devil comes hmm when he knows you're distracted he can come and he could talk to you like he's giving you some kind of sensible solution to your problem but if you listen to him it ain't nothing but death leave that to your own understanding I don't care what he says acknowledge the Lord bring it back to the word if the world don't speak it the devil is a liar he comes alone sometime and he offer gifts to people and people are in such a cover that's lose now people just they just oh I gotta have it you know every I love I love cold stone and every time I go to coast on they got like it love it and got to have it and every time I say God I have it I feel so funny cuz I really don't have to have it it's just but just saying I gotta have it it makes me it's a culture statement you ain't got to have nothing that alright to say it that way you ain't gotta have nothing you see and and we realize it is yes just the size just give it a big cup you know and we fail to see that's the way the devil does he works with you a little bit don't you like it don't you right that's the way he works and in in that entice in that lust and then he keeps driving you and driving you into the next thing you know if you don't cut him off you gotta have it down all right that's what it did with David David saw bad basil it I know you like it oh I know you love it hey I know the sound Carla but it's the truth oh I gotta have it he forgot in his own senses that the man had a wife he saw it and yet he didn't see it he knew it was true but he didn't know it was true you understand me that's how the devil gets us he blind you to the reality of what he's trying to get you to do and then when he gets you to do what he wants you to do he brings the chopping block he brings he acts come on she's about a young kid quiet but it's true it's a mess David found himself in a mask and he had to pay for it all the rest of his life the devil has a prison house hello didn't I read that I said say he won't even open the door of his prisoner prison he traps us oh come on somebody it's the truth I know her sister amen she had diabetes and you know that's why I say stay connected to God God might want you to take medicine God may not want you to take medicine but you need to find out what God's will is you don't lean to your own understanding you seek the will of the Lord because if your leader to you oh I know God can heal me I know God can hear me but has he revealed it to you Healing is a revelation oh because you feel blue goosebumps running up and down your spine that don't mean not there when God reveals to you his will you can spin on it too and know that His perfect will be redone in your life and you'll never have to question or doubt what's happening with you ever because you know you in the will of God hmm Oh Satan is a mess and anytime he can bring your life to a mess he's going to do it sunshine and my soul sunshine in my soul yes you keep it there because just a shoe it sunshine is your so sing that song the devil gonna say I'm gonna see how much sunshine you got in your soul and how long you can keep it there y'all know what I'm sayin he doesn't run up into you listen al boom I'm Satan he's a creeper slowly moves on you hmmm is this blessing somebody because I want you to understand the only way you gonna able be able to keep order in your personal life is to stay with the word if you deviate from this Satan has reason calls to cause a mess in your life hello I forgot what country was remember when brother branham was supposed to I think he was supposed to go to India South Africa he's with the Indian y'all know each other and he caught that amoeba God told him not to go to a certain place and the preacher said but brother branham we don't advertise it and they are expecting you and and brother branham told Billy Paul danger the Lord told him not to go but boss said you better not go daddy but he listened to the preachers and though the meeting was a great meeting he caught an amoeba and almost died yeah y'all hear them say only because he failed to listen to what God told him to do later on that years later God shipped him to the place and they had a great revival but you keep with that's why I say it's so Li not know it your revelation is not based upon what somebody wants you to do you must know the will of God for yourself hallelujah I'm feeling pretty good this evening the Bible tells us when when when joshuaryan went over there amen in a new land he says by little and little will I Drive and out before thee until thou being and inherit the land y'all understand me see that's why God takes his time building us first of all if he zapped us into it will be full of pride but when you should struggle for something hmm struggling helps your attitude hallelujah Amen if you were such a small person you could get your doctor at any kind of way just zip zip zip zip zip you would never appreciate it but you got to come across some struggles in school you got a struggle come on amen oh he's a straight-a student but listen I'm a straight-a student too I'm not saying I am I'm just saying the attitude would be different because I had to work hard for mine my brother was like that he was such a mathematician he could skip class he'd go to school and test time and hasten I struggled one plus one is three no one press when it's wet to y'all to catch it mercy but the point is you and I must realized by God's grace Amen that it is God who makes you struggle struggling is wonderful the Bible says thinking that strange whenever temptation try you knowing that the trying of your faith is more precious than go it's alright to struggle it's good to have hard time because once you come out that joy is only speak unspeakable godliness with contentment is great gain but we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we carry nothing out we're having food and raiment let us be therewith content now we may not understand how contentment is so important because if you're not content Satan can agitate you he irritates you he would take away your peace and while your peace is gone God might might be trying to tell you something how many times God has blessed you or blessed me and you know you didn't deserve it well you know he's probably probably was trying to tell you not to worry don't worry about it I got it all under control but we just get all it's the devil's work that's the way he does it I don't believe Cain went out there amen I'm gonna kill Abel today no the devil was on his back little by little by little by little the next thing you know a man he's killed his brother was that right the Bible said even in this day they will kill you thinking that they did have done God a service thinking they doing the will of God understand I'm coming to something now when you and I were in a position you're not as far as I'm concerned I don't know what over there in Europe is like I don't know what France is like I do know what America is like America this is written in the book of Revelation 13th chapter she comes up like a lamb she starts speaking like a dragon she is one of the forces that help moves the world into the into the mark of the beast hallelujah come on now if the devil is moving in that way then we must understand with all of this confusion with all of this chaos with all of this mess what is the mark of the beast somebody says oh is six-six in your forehead some other says it's 666 on your hand nonsense it might come to that but the mark of the beast has always been who say well the mark of the beast started we came and came without amen amen the building what what happened see if you watch Cain the problem was that when that winning mark he no longer here he was he wasn't submissive a them in the beginning but he went out to establish his own Kingdom he was a great man his lineage was the great even now in Babylon they think they're great bears love the one great and that's Christ hallelujah how do you know a Babylonian system because it is a system of of hierarchy they don't tell you that the bishop and the elder and the pastor is the same thing preach us and you know they got all this hierarchy amen is man ruling over man moodle of a man rule and it makes it sick God's sick because it's just another spiritual form of sodomy no man is Pope's rule you know man is supposed to rule you hmm you said what what do you mean it is God who have saved us and called us with this holy calling it's not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which he given us in Christ Jesus before the world began unlike statements like that because I realized amen I am by His grace invincible come on hey you said what do you mean every step I take he's already justified in me ah he's not looking at my outward appearance he's not even looking at my mistakes he's looking at what he designed in me for his purpose and you I'm almost done honey you know I'm looking at that I'm asking you now what house are you building what house are you building how is your house what's going on in your house what light is in the house listen what if you straight you got to understand Satan comes in right through these senses he comes right through these senses and he comes right into your house if you let him hello you blood dose that's what about that gird up the loins of your mind your mind is your spiritual part of you turning it up tighten it up don't let the nonsense come in said no leave a thing before your eyes and all of us need helpful net help us Lord Jesus the Bible says listen but in in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of earth and some to honor and some to dishonor if a man therefore purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor sanctified and meat for the Masters use and prepared unto every good work then he goes on and says under Timothy flee also youthful lusts but for but far the righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart but you think well I'm you know do you know that even when you witness and the people you're not supposed to strive y'all that y'all know that you don't strive with a man you don't strive with the scripture you don't fight over the scripture if I said avoid foolish and unlearned don't even worry about it well how can God look like he made two men in the Genesis Genesis he started here and he started there but it what are you asking that for what that has to do with your salvation you need to be saved right if a man don't want to talk salvation to you you don't talk doctrine get him to the water first get him to repentance first if you eat oh you don't need to talk all that other stuff cuz he ain't gonna understand nothing the Bible said I'm a common mind cannot perceive the thing that our God you feeding a bird brain the part the point is you've got to get a command man must be converted in order to understand God it can't be religion like I said the other day and I'm almost ready to close I'm just throwing these other things out because I'm building on this I'm not done with it it's just too much material but the point is I'm trying to find a little basis because I want you to understand like Sabo said what was is now and there go the people who gonna overcome and they're gonna people be people who will not overcome there will be people who were being snared and trapped hello y'all understand that being Sodom down there when the fire came you think what would they do it it wasn't look at them like all the fires gonna fall they were so in a delusion God came to repair they rejected the repair man and when the fire fell they were guilty judgment call them y'all understand what I'm trying to say now I'm using these things because I want you to understand every spirit of noise day of last day of Egypt's day every spirit has been loosed on us they tell me that's not a mess and guess what you and I have to fight it and the only way we can fight it is to stay under the blood he is I better like he is I come on somebody God will fight for you oh it's just so much but let me let me try to find a closing point brother Adam said it like this in the day of the scripture so Phil he said sometime God lets the things get so dark that you can't see up around or anywhere else and then he comes and make a way through it for you that you might say this day the scripture is being fulfilled that he promised to do he let the children the Hebrew children walked right into the fiery furnace they said o our God is able to deliver us from this fire in the furnace but nevertheless we're not bow down to your image when they walked out there the smell of the furnace upon them no smell of the furnace rather came upon them they could have said this day the scripture is fulfilled hallelujah your eyes are true you know how people you know I don't know how they do it now because I hadn't seen you don't see people fast no more like they used to but when people used to fast they used to they used to put their face in some light yeah they wanted you alright I'm just fasting yeah you know and people did that it was a religious spirit but they did it and another way you could tell they were fasting because they would put all those oil Oh Oh God have mercy anyhow that's not what it really is my back when you fast and nobody should know except for your spouse or someone close to you that you know that will affect it it will affect but that's what religion it'll do for you and guess what that's Satan's mess Satan always want to be seen hello it's the truth that's how you know when you in air if you're preaching if you're singing or whatever and you want to be seen then you know you are in a mess only you're singing you're playing it does is it will bless you but it's to God it goes up first and then down and out not down and out and then up no up first then down and out hmm right now I'm moves done when then you came from the lion's den he could have said the same thing see God will allow you to get in a mess now the real mess God want you to get in a lot of people don't want to get into that you know what mess I'm talking about the birth yeah yeah Ragosa it's a mess but that's the mess a lot of people don't want to get into they took pride for their like Kane cases ah ah that's too messy man look at my beautiful rolls of corn oh I'm almost done yeah y'all know what I'm saying my point is this if we're gonna serve God let's serve God with all our heart now we make mistakes I'm not just preaching on that so it comes this way I'm guilty just like you are but you know what God has to preach to me first before I can preach to y'all hey judgment first begins me here yeah because if I preached something that that that I'm not trying to do or trying to repent from or whatever the case may be it makes me a total hypocrite there's so much that's all I've been telling my lord I said God I'm trusting you because sometimes things get so out of line and so out of order you don't even know how to bring it back and only God can bring it back and that's just the way I feel so many things that seem to be so out of out of order I don't even know how to bring it back but I do know how to pray I do know how to pray right it's like Shem God Lord I'm so tired of the Philistine coming in and eat my wheat and everything every time I look like I got everything just right here they come y'all know it's true every time I look like I got it just right here they come and God says okay now your season coming go season coming I'm gonna put it in your hand and when I put it in your hand I want you to tell me hey man and you and I must understand by God's grace we don't have to remain in the condition that we're in let me use this example enclosing the man who was born blind he says I can't there I've never seen sight in my life I've been born blind all my life whatever blindness is that's what I am I don't know what it is to see I don't know nothing about colors I don't know what the tree look like I don't know what the sky look like I don't know nothing and Jesus says do you want to see what is sight I don't even know what it is I've heard everybody talk about it all my life I've felt around I could feel shapes and things like that I don't know what that is but whatever it is you're offering I want it you don't know what eternal life is we've never experienced it on that debt that level but whatever it is if you've been walking behind for thirty years what difference does it make Jesus is here to offer this height I pity I can't describe it to you but whatever it is Jesus I want it and that supposed to be our attitude right now it's a mask lord I can't straight my life out I don't know how to start I've dealt with these demons all my life and God how do I get rid of them jesus said I am the way sometimes you got to get like you got to get like blind bottom as you can see no he screamed he hollered and then God didn't hear that God hurt his heart cry that's where the law that's where the volume came from the heart cry there was a does monster to God Jesus couldn't hurt him with being a man but the heart went up that SOS went up and came down in Jesus turn said what would you have of me hmm so you and I must understand we cannot please people of God I know I don't know you your failures I don't know what you struggle with I don't know these things he does but you don't have to remain that's the point what are you saying nobody else it ain't about nobody else it's about you it's about me every man and woman is responsible for themselves you know it's a mess you noticed it's just chaotic everywhere and look what the devil even in the message has done so many so many varieties of it now how you gonna know the real one you stay with the real one that's why I was in book form and on tape so you stay with the real one you ain't got to be deep it doesn't have to be complicated the message came to change you it came to change your inner man not to stimulate your brain it came to change you and that message will change you if you say Amen parlor even when I hear the proper praying on the tape I pray and I let him let go many times I'm weeping getting God help me because I'm not listening to a man I'm listening to a voice that's a supernatural voice hmm how much tell you something many times people say well what's wrong with you brother Brooks I'm telling you I am desperate and look like the closer Christ comes and I jumped a lot of things i'ma tell you like this if God and you heard me say this last week of it was he held up the Angels their four wins and in World War one we river Euphrates all the demons left that we see the manifestation of all of that we see his mess hmm from from Israel all the way over here we see the mess now in all of that mess there's got to be light because God said I never left myself without a witness when the prophet of God died and went on to heaven amen he didn't stop the program it was just the beginning of it is that right he said a real prophet comes my messenger comes up at the end of the age not the beginning it was the end of later seer but the beginning of what we call the bride age the move is on the bride and we must come out of the sting we must realize there's a straight way and God can make it happen in our lives it doesn't matter what everybody else is do stop stop thinking about what everybody else is doing and think about you as an individual called by God to manifest Christ in this day that's what he wants godliness with contentment is that right just like that once instead in envenom tabernacle who is it there where all the time and God didn't see fit for her to be healed she didn't get mad she didn't have a attitude she stayed true to God hmm what good if God healed me of anything and my soul be lost I take what he give me I'm gonna be content you understand me and I tell you I'm telling you because that's what the devil was Lucifer was not content with what God gave him discontentment started with him it came down the cable cane came with discontented as long as you can stay content it doesn't mean God don't prosper you you know if right out of to God don't prosper you ain't no ands ifs or buts about it it's the truth I mean we got a witness don't look at this man back there I'm embarrassing that problem but I remember when he worked with down down downtown in the building 666 Rouen and look what God is done with you everybody in here has been promoted since I've been here I'm still the pastor but my promotion I just wait on it but you know I love the Lord and I love the people of God if you can follow me understand all confusion has a beginning and that's the devil that's Lucifer and God wants all these things to be straight is that right because he said he's coming for a bride without a spot or wrinkle so everything has to be straightened we can't say well oh you know grace cover me but grace is covered you so you can make it right grace it's not on Avenue sir well all I'm just gonna be I'm broken and I'll just be broke till he come not on grace came and the power you try to tell me that the power of the blood came straight in you when the power of blood can it raised a man from the dead open the eyes of the blind you trying to tell me the power of the blood can't change your character huh he stopped a prostitute on her track who had been a prostitute all her life and made her a godly woman hmm Simon and Matthew and all of them who were thieves and rose and cheetahs and whatever they else they were attacked collectors and say come follow me that's Dan remember this is Satan's amass and the church is not supposed to be a mess
