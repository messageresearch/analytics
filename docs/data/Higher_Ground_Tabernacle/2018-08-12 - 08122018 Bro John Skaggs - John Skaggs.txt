TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we will be having community for those who want to come back and fellowship with us in the word and around Communion and then we'll appreciate you brother Travis didn't try to wouldn't you know we we understand so just understand that everything that we do is to glorify God and the Bible says whatsoever you do in word or deed do it all in the name of Jesus Christ so this is what we do and this is how we do it in and not to try to offend you or anything else it's just that if it's not glorifying God we just we can't use it you love the Lord and let's tan [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] see my voice is worn but my heart is not before I forget I want the pillar fire picture back up so if somebody could do that this day today sometime I'd appreciate it thank you Barrett it Oh yep somebody was gonna rescue me thank you you may be seated it's very good to see everybody again it's some I've not seen some i-i've seen it's very good to see the children of God we come from a place where there is no message churches it's just my family and myself and my my youngest boy just moved away and and so just leave me my wife and so I I get a little jealous when I come to places like this where there's a lot of people a lot of Christians and so we are very grateful to be in your presence today if I'm too quick just let me know I don't want to be too too fast god bless you brother we are very very thankful today for God's grace we want to take our Bibles this morning and we're going to read a very very familiar scripture and we want to speak on a subject that may not be familiar and the subject we're going to speak on is witchcraft if you could all stand with me as we read the scripture this morning in the book of Luke the 17th chapter a very very familiar scripture in the 30th verse even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed I'd like to turn to one more scripture in the book of second Thessalonians chapter 2 second Thessalonians chapter 2 and we're going to read from verse 8 and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness may the Lord bless the reading of his word you can be seated it seems perhaps a strange scriptures to read concerning a subject of witchcraft but we want to look today at the wits that is here in the message every everybody has always heard of the witches and warlocks and the different things that can cast spells and and disrupt life and and and can hurt people and to be honest with you those things are pretty small compared to what goes on in the world because first place a witch or a witch person s in witchcraft they worship Satan so that is not something I've as a missionary been in contests with witches and had them put the curses try to kill my children different things that they've done and in that realm there's nothing they have no power over a son of God they got power yes but it's perverted power they take God's power and pervert it to their end the laws that God set in motion they take those laws and twist them to make their works come to pass and so when you stand in God's way the truth it can't be perverted and so when that power comes to pervert or to twist it can't do it because the one who gave the law is standing there making sure it stays right and so the witchcraft of those kinds are powerless now they would try but they can anything to a son of God but if we come into a little higher perhaps into where a demon or a witch or something can harm you is a professed believer whether it be Christian message Lutheran Baptist it doesn't matter why because they can enter in where you are they can speak to you on the grounds that they believe in Jesus Christ I remember a couple years ago a demon-possessed man that a family had called me and asked me to go pray for this man and so I went to the man he was demon-possessed and the demon began to speak through him to me and I asked the demon I said what gave you the right to enter into this man and the demon spoke to me and he said he believed we were God when we came to him I said what did you tell him that he believed you were God he said we told him we were gone and he believed that and accepted those demons into his life and by God's grace the demons had to leave uh and uh I when I began to speak to the man at first I asked who was I speaking to and he said you don't need to know who you're speaking to he spoke that to me and so I just waited until the presence of the Lord came and when the presence of the Lord came then I said in the name of Jesus Christ tell me who you are and he told me who he was and he was Beelzebub and he was asked out then another spirit raised up in the same place and I said in the name of Jesus Christ who are you this demon spoke and said I am Christ what does Christ mean anointed one that's what this person believed when this demon came to him that's pretty strong but that demon had to leave there was several other demons in this man and by God's grace they all left but that's what we want to speak on this morning how the demons will come to you how they will come to me how they come to each person in the message because the highest form of witchcraft is not stirring the pot with the big stick in casting curses on people the highest form of witchcraft reads the message books listens to message tapes and that's what we want to look at this morning has witchcraft come in here into this place does witch does demonology speak to you does it speak to me in order to do this we want to go back to the beginning where brother Branham said the highest form of deception took place in the book of Genesis and this highest deception that took place was by a preacher it wasn't by a witch it wasn't by a warlock or wizard it was by somebody preaching the Word of God what was the first thing that this great wizard spoke has God said he didn't say there wasn't no God he didn't say there is no divine healing he took her to the word for her day and twisted it he wasn't afraid of the word for that day he was afraid if that word became flesh for that day that's what made him afraid so before that could happen he decided to stop it and let his word become flesh and so he took God's word just like the witches take God's laws and they twist them around just like the warlocks do their greatest curses in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit one of the witches that tried to kill my children he has every message book that's able to be had he has every tape he's got it on his computer you don't get any debate with him because he can make you look very bad and he's a witch but he knows this message better than anybody I've ever met and he tried to kill my children with curses so when Satan at the very beginning he used the Word of God to deceive Eve by and because of that you were born in sin you were shaped in iniquity you came to the world speaking lies because the Word of God was perverted was taken out of its original state and caused to be told a lie we all know what I was that I was you shall not surely die but she died now let's go a little farther in the same book of Genesis and we're going to go to the place where Jesus said it would be like when the Son of Man is revealed in Genesis I believe it's chapter 12 I'm just referring to these we don't necessarily have to read them but it's in chapter 12 of Genesis where Abraham the father of the faith got out of God's will how did he get out of God's will he went somewhere where he wasn't supposed to be he went to a church he wasn't supposed to be in he went to a denomination and in that denomination he told a lie and his wife told a lie and then strange that the very first deception was on a lie and we follow the same pattern in Abraham's life when he got out of the will of God it was on a lie that's in chapter 12 where he's told the king this is my sister and Sarah told the King this is my brother he was afraid he was afraid they would kill him he was afraid they would disfellowship him he was afraid they would take his possessions and then we we follow Abraham's life and God began to meet with him in different ways after he pulled him out of this denomination we all were caught in some kind of a denomination at one time every one of us we all believed a lie that we had to be part of that somehow or we weren't saying it was a lie what do you have to be part of to be saved Jesus Christ it does not say in the scripture believe on the Lutheran's and you shall be saved believe on the Lord Jesus Christ but Satan begin to tell us through his great witchcraft that we had to be part of a church we had to belong to some group we had to identify with some basic doctrine and we believed that lie and God had to pull us out of that so we can find ourselves right with Abraham we can't look back and say aha poor guy we did the same thing we find where God began to visit with Abraham and he would come to him in a dream or he would speak to him some way and then we find he'd come a little closer that that God changed Abraham Abraham's name to Abraham and then God Himself created a body and he stepped into that body and he came and visited Abraham and he spoke things to Abraham he knew the thoughts he knew the heart what was in Sarah's heart behind him in the tent and he gave a promise turn with me I believe it's Genesis 19 or 18 I'm not sure which one it's actually 1718 yes chapter 18 Genesis chapter 18 and we want to be with verse 9 Genesis chapter 18 verse 9 and they said unto Him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I not you I I know where in this scripture is you involved you he said have to do nothing but wait he didn't tell Abraham to do anything he said I will return unto thee Abraham had nothing to do he didn't say pray he didn't say listen to tapes he didn't say go to church all the work was up to God Abraham had nothing to do he was required nothing let's read on and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him did that happen in our day was God manifested in a flesh body called William Branham discern the thoughts and intents of the heart look back through people's lives told things it happened even before they were born told things that would happen God fulfilled that did he not now after God left Abraham all he said was wait that's all he said God left Abraham went down into Sodom he walked around he looked do you believe there was a message churches in Sodom there was because it wasn't very long before this that Abraham had taken his servants and went and set Sodom free out of bondage remember when the five kings come against Sodom took him as slaves took him and killed lots of them and Abraham said I will go set him free with my servants so no doubt Abraham was a hero to the sodomites there was no doubt people said this is a prophet of God this is a man of God because look what he did with three hundred people against thousands of people trained warriors there's not a doubt in my mind that there was churches set up that acknowledged Abraham as a prophet of God why because jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the Son of Man is their churches set up that honors William Branham then it was in the days of Sodom so god goes down into Sodom after he is promised Abraham I will return unto thee and he begins to look around he goes to one of these message churches in Sodom what does he find did lot believe the message yes he did he walked with the messenger he knew who Abraham was did Lot's wife believe the message absolutely so where does that put us today that puts us right as it was in the days of Sodom God couldn't find the ten righteous so he took the four and said take him out and they left and judgment struck did not the Prophet take the rock and throw up in the air there's a judgment striking the westcoast judgment is in the land I want you to notice right after that son of man ministry what did Abraham do he went back to the same lie that he had told before the same lie not a different lie the same lie what did he do God said wait I will return these learned the thoughts and intents of Sarah's heart Abraham says it's getting pretty dry I better go to church but when we get to this church Sarah you lie for me the same lie he had told before now what was the lie that you believed before you have to be part of something besides Christ the same lie has come in the message that's in the denominations the same lie not a different lie the same lie what did this lie cause to happen this lie caused the very thing that was going to bring the promised son the very thing that the promised was going to come by was taken away Sara was the one who was going to bring the promised son and because of this lie she was taken away and given to another man and it's the same thing in the message to believe the lie that you have to be in this message to be saved causes you to be joined to the wrong man no where did brother Branham say you must believe this message to be saved he said you must come to Christ and that is that there is no other way this message is true but the demon of witchcraft has come in our midst and perverted the truth that would set you free and has caused us to believe a lie and be damned by it it's not a different lie that's what's out there in denominations it's the same lie in the days of Jesus there was two thoughts one was called the Pharisees one was called the Sadducees which one did Jesus belong to neither one he called from both sides and he said come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest in the days of William Branham there was two great thoughts one was trend one was oneness which one was brother branham neither one but he called from both sides come to Christ now what have we got in the message today two great thoughts you have to listen to tapes or you have to be part of a church is that true which one are you where is Christ he ain't in either group he's calling from both groups come unto me don't come under your knowledge of this message don't come unto what you think is right in this message I'm sorry I get too fast where are you today what did Abraham have to do when God rescued him from the king again he had to leave he had to do some repenting he didn't stay there did he can you imagine the bickering and fighting that took place between Abraham and Sarah because of that that wouldn't be very good can you imagine Abraham was just like us Sarah was just like you ladies in their mind they were probably thinking what have we done why did I do that how come I didn't trust God you do the same thing when you get caught in a mistake what do you do I hope nobody finds out about that but did God hold it against Abraham no did God hold it against that nation yes God held it against that nation for what Abraham did wrong no how many people are condemned for when you do wrong if God won't hold it against you who does he hold it against how many people will God strike dead because of the mistakes that you made if God did that of Abraham and Jesus said as it was in the days of Abraham so shall it be at the coming of the Son of man I know this is much different than what you've heard I'm not trying to start a move I'm not trying to start look what I preached we need to come back to Christ the book of Revelation chapter 18 if you could take your Bibles with me beginning with verse 1 I see some have the Bibles in the book and I see some have the Bibles on the little phone that's very fine it isn't this - no this isn't life but to know him is life so if I read it in this way or I read it in that way to know him is to know is to his life Genesis Revelation chapter 18 beginning with verse 1 and after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the Great is fallen is fallen and become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird is that not the message is that not what William Branham did did not he cry out who Babylon the Great was did he not denounce and show every hateful an unclean bird was in that place verse three for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies verse four and I heard another voice jesus said my sheep know my voice starting heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people if you are a sheep of God and you hear his voice what is that voice saying to you come out of her my people now brother Brooks has family here and if brother Brooks was to stand up here and say my family needs to be in the parking lot would you go out do you not have Brooks anybody that's not a Brooks would stay here because you know who you are and when God's voice cries come out of her my people not everyone will come out only God's people why they know who they are when let us read on verse 4 and I heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues what are her sins taking this and putting it aside for a church Creed taking this putting it aside for good works taking this and putting it aside for a certain doctrine taking this and putting it aside for a certain culture brother brian said putting the person of Jesus Christ aside for good works putting Jesus Christ aside as the person of eternal life for going to church what happened when Abraham did this told this lie Sarah was taken away from him for what reason so she could be impregnated with another man seed the very thing that God promised to take place was taken away now what happens to you when you believe that lie the very thing that God promised to take place in this day it's taken away from you the very reason for the message coming forth the very thing that you were called out of you go right back into it wasn't a different lie it was the same lie when Eve believed that lie what happened to her she was impregnated with the wrong seed that's why serpent seed had to come out in this day the same thing happened was trying to happen in the days of Abraham brother Branham said the same thing tried to happen in the days of Mary but God turned it around wasn't pregnant with a man its impregnated by what the Holy Ghost that which is in you is of the Holy Ghost it is say it's of the word they said it's of the Holy Ghost and when that Holy Ghost impregnated her what did it bring forth the Word made flesh and so is it today if you will take God's Word and let that Holy Ghost come in here it will make you the Word made flesh but if all you take is the doctrines if all you take is a church order if all you take is I can't do this but I got to do that you have believed the lie how it wasn't very long ago when the Holy wouldn't fill a lady so much get her drunk husband would go to the bar and brag how much of a Christian she was and they say oh no they know such a thing he said come on let's find out and he got his old buddies all of them and he said let's really act drunk let's really put it on and I'll prove to you there's a Christian and they go home two o'clock in the morning get her out of bed fix us up need to get some thick something he throw it on the floor kicking around call her bad names run outside and they looked through the window what's she doing is he reading a message book is she listening to a message tape no she's cleaning up the mess and she's singing a song must Jesus bear the cross alone and what happened those drunks became Christians how come we don't see that in the message how come we got we got the message we've got the laws we've got the doctrines we've got the bylaws we've got all of these things but where's the life where's the one that will change that Drive where's the life that will take that that the the dope addicts where's the one that will reach down into hell and pull that one out of the gates of hell not by the laws of the message but by the word being made flesh in you why do we have that in the message anymore because we've believed a lie and that lie is you're all right if you believe the message you're not all right the very thing you say you believe will condemn you the very thing that you say you believe will stand against you in that day I believe the message but without Christ you have nothing without him you're dead Peter the great apostle of God of Jesus Christ perhaps the leader of the Apostles he believed on the Lord Jesus Christ he left his boat to follow Jesus he believed the message of Jesus but he was not converted until the Holy Spirit came in him he was not converted when he believed the message Paul said to some believers have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed believed what the message of the hour they believed the message they were proving the message by the scriptures how much more proof can you have but they had not received the Holy Ghost so what did they I had to turn around go with me to the book of Acts chapter 2 and we want to read verse 5 of Acts chapter 2 and there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven these men were not murders these men weren't liars these men did not commit adultery these men did not look at pornography these men worshipped Jehovah and they came at that time to present a sacrifice to Jehovah they followed everything that the messenger Moses had told them to do then they heard of this new religion so they went to see what it was and Peter about men and said repent these were devout men they were good men what did they have to repent of their religion because they were in a religion that was dead did God receive their sacrifice of the Lamb that they presented to the high priest he did not because the real Lamb was hanging on the cross and so when Peter says to them repent what he was saying was turned from your religion and come to Christ and I say to you today repent turn from your religion of the message and come to Christ when Paul this great devout Jew he made a statement and he said I have learned all many great things under these teachers he believed in one God he believed in pillar of fire he believed the 10 commandments he believed the prophets and he said I count all of that as dung to know the excellency of Christ and his cross he didn't just lay down the wrong parts he laid down the right parts as well he didn't say I counted some of it as dung oh why because it was only knowledge it was not the new birth and if you stand today with knowledge of this message and not the new birth in you repent and come to Christ what has caused all these message churches to fail knowledge let us stay on our feet the great witchcraft of this day comes from right here it comes from the pulpit brother Branham said and the message the Feast of the trumpets I don't mean brother Brooks I don't please die if somebody thinks I met him personally I didn't mean that because I'm a preacher too and so I have to be careful because Satan can use me in that witchcraft you have to be careful you have to watch what I say you have to watch what brother Brooks says brother Branham said in the Feast of the trumpets that in a second world war Hitler Eichmann Mussolini released two hundred million demons into the earth and he said those two hundred million demons went after the Jews they shot him they poison them they did everything to erase that race of people but then he said twenty years later after that war when the seals opened up those two hundred million demons changed form and he said they would only come against the bride he said they will not go to the denomination's are you part of the bride so those two hundred million demons here today yes they are what are they trying to do how what form are they in you can't take my word for it you can't take brother Brooks's word for it but we can take a messengers word for it the messenger said they took the form of a church and an ecclesiastical spirit what is eco ecclesiastical preachers I'm a preacher is there any other preachers in here besides me and brother Brooks welcome sir that's where those demons are fighting you in a church spirit if you will believe just to be part of a message church makes you okay you are under witchcraft if you believe that your pastor will get you to heaven you're under witchcraft there's one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus was Eve a daughter of God absolutely why she came from a son of God she was part of that son of God was Sarah a daughter of God said in the last days it will be so close as to deceive the very elect if possible that pyramid gets sharper sharper sharper until at the very top brother brand said it is razor sharp where are you today where am i today have I believed this message have you believe this message without coming to Christ first if you have that can be changed that can be changed today that can be changed right now when this is this your wife when this brother asked this lady to be his wife long did it take to say yes not very long say the word yes that's how long it took that's how long it takes to repent that's how long it takes for God to save you that's how long it takes for you to become God made flesh today it don't take years of study it don't take crying out at the altar for hours and hours and hours it takes turning to God those power heads some of you the Holy Spirit is speaking to and he's saying to you will you let me in will you accept me for who I am I'm not great glamorous I'm just Jesus will you accept me on those basis I'm not a great person I'm just Jesus few will accept him in that simpleness will you raise your hand to him I will ask you one more question will you turn from everything that you think is right and let Jesus Christ be your guide will you say Lord God I'm so sorry I didn't realize I had done this thing will you please forgive me if that is your prayer just raise your hand to him and there is a still small voice that comes into your heart and it says you are forgiven take up your cross and follow me Oh as you see each hand that is raised to you Lord and you see this sincerity that's down in that heart may your peace come to them today may it be God and we will never do this thing again that we can walk free of every burden may it be that we can walk free of every man and follow you we commit ourselves to you Lord I want to ask today to those who have raised their hands if you find yourself here today without the Holy Ghost you've believed all the right things but his spirit isn't there if you find yourself that way that can change also if you would like that you've accepted Jesus Christ in the simplest form there is at the foot of the cross come off of that cross and into your heart if you would like that I would ask you to come forth and stand up here to the very front if you find yourself lacking and say I don't really know if I have that Holy Spirit I've believed the message but I just am Not sure the Apostle Paul spoke to some message believers this kind of a message that was spoken today and when they repented they were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and he laid his hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost if you've never been baptized correctly if you've never repented and been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you need to do that but with each one that has come up here today brother Brooks if you could come the brother that come yes you help us you help us pray we're going to anoint each one brother if you will anoint each one and we will pray for each one that from this day forth the Holy Spirit is upon thee and he will direct thy ways my brother if you will pray this pray Lord Jesus thank you for our friend that has come today we ask Lord that your spirit come upon him Lord not in some great flourishing thing but in that quiet gentle way let it be done that he can go forth from this day knowing that the presence of Jesus Christ is in him now when these demons come to try to torment him and tell him these things that he will cast it away in the name of Jesus Christ that he is a child of God these oppressions that try to bind his thoughts begone from him in the name of Jesus Christ amen aimée our sister here today Lord Jesus as we come once again with our sister here seeing that great struggle bind in her mind as it was listening to the Word of God Satan trying to tell her it's okay don't worry about it but God you have prevailed and she stands before you this day Lord in answer to your call we ask Lord that your spirit come upon her take every doubt every fear from her Lord and let her raise up in the admonition of the Lord that she can be a light today's announcer forgiver of everything that has happened in her life let her be your daughter in Jesus name Amen aiming god bless you sister Amy Lord Jesus you said when the disciples went forth that you've seen Satan falling from heaven as lightning and we see the same thing take place again today that our sister has come to stand before you give Lord in humility forsaking her position and it stand before you Lord God where one time she prayed all through the night may that return to her again the Lord God whenever she calls upon your name the demons tremble and now when that token is displayed over her children those brave chains of hell will break loose and set them free that the power of God could reign within this league in Jesus name we pray amen amen Lord God on earth once again we stand with one of your children he has stood upon your word and he's taken you at your word that he can know from this day forth that there is no doubt in his mind that the Spirit of God reigns within him and that from this day forth Lord he can go conquering and break every chain that tries to bind his family with the love of God everything that tries to hinder him and his children and his wife from walking free in the Spirit of God may the sword of the spirit come into his hand the sword of the word and strike the enemy down we thank you for this man Lord may your spirit come to him in its fullness in jesus name amen amen Lord God once more can she understand Lord Jesus if we are still before God I say this because he I'm sorry I turned it off I say this because there is a stillness in here today why because he's still working he's still talking to somebody there's a great battle taking place even in this man as we speak is this true what is this battle this battle that says it can't be so because you didn't scream you didn't jump you didn't shout you didn't feel some great big thing is this true what the battle you were facing exactly yes we go by feelings we go by things that we think it should be but do you believe God's Word that's not what I asked if you believe his word then quit trying to live it what does the tree do to produce leaves they drinks the water and the leaves come out it is the same with you if you will quit trying to be a Christian and let Christ be the Christian in you we go by emotions we go by jumping we go by shouting we go by these things but when the shouting is over where are we at we're still in the same place but if something anchors deep inside and begins to grow didn't matter if you shall it don't matter if you feel good it matters that the seed of God is in you how do you get the seed of God in you you just accept it you just accepted if you had me to their soil and I already bought it and I say it's yours how do you get it you just take it that's what Christ did at Calvary you have to do nothing just accept it just accept it that's it you don't have to feel good does that change God that's the problem yes yes will you let it go are you greater than God did God forgive you yes then why won't you that's where God wants you [Music] I do anyone else needs prayer of any kind is that there's the sister needs a prayer come what are you doing pray for I'm talking to this lady here please do you have a husband is he here come bless you sir you are a child of God this is a daughter of God everything that comes against this has to come through you it cannot touch him if you won't let it no matter

him for don't we amen I don't even I can't even think of a song it's so brother Brooks come up Leena sent us all [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that we all know we are faith civilization everything we do is based on faith faith is being able to call those things that be not as though they were if you can see it you can believe it you can name it and then claim it you see it first you'll faith bring sight and we appreciate everything that's been said and done if you really believe that God moved in your heart he moved you can receive that you got it and that's just the way I look at it I appreciate the service how many were blessed I was truly blessed because that is so true I've said Lord many years I said these people they believed the message but they don't have the Holy Ghost that's the truth not all but some and if you can believe this message is okay but think about the messenger that brought the message from Jared to Jesus right in the face of Jesus with a message and he turns his back on he turn a life instead of saying lord have mercy on me and I thank God for the service I really thank God for what was spoken as it is to know Christ's salvation is of the Lord now we see why so many have fallen believing the message but they never made it to Christ ain't God good he would have mercy upon us and give a sight to see so the what if we were doing something wrong ignorant me we now know what a mighty God less best is by the word of Prayer will be dismissed surely God has met us this morning have any father God we thank you Lord Jesus for your servant we pray father that you give him straight and guidance Lord we thank you for all that has been said and done Nord we realize Lord that the day is so late it's about the breaking of a new day Lord we're right in that period of time Lord when Moses and Elijah is about to pick up here and Lord we can't go home till all those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life has been sealed ha there's not enough to know about the statue of Christ but we must become that statue and the only way we can Lord that we must have your holy spirit on the inside a living written epistle read of all men bless each and every one of us Lord may we continue to press toward the mark of a higher calling which is in Christ Jesus let not the words slip from our hearts but father I pray that the word will bring forth a hundredfold in each one each here's a heart Lord thank you father for the victory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen we're dismissed [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
