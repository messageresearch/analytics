[1:16] lion of the tribes of Judah the root of
[1:19] David has conquered thus he can open the
[1:23] scoll and e seven SE
[1:31] [Music]
[1:39] then I saw standing in the middle of the
[1:42] throne and of the fourth living creature
[1:46] and in the middle of the elders a lamb
[1:50] that appeared to have been killed he had
[1:54] seven horns and seven highes which are
[1:58] the seven Spirit of the God sent out
[2:01] into all the Earth verse 8 and
[2:21] 10 and verse eight verse eight and when
[2:26] he had taken the scroll the f creature
[2:30] and the 24th Elders threw themselves to
[2:35] the ground before the lamb each of them

[3:11] have appointed them as a king and
[3:16] Priests to save our God and they will
[3:19] reain on the
[3:23] earth God bless his
[3:25] word you may be seated
[3:45] we are talking about uh about Adam uh
[3:50] who's receiving the uh
[3:57] book that is the title of the hor who
[4:06] uh that is the ti of the horor of the of
[4:11] Earth and the uh etal life eternal
[4:15] life that's what Adam lost when he fall
[4:19] in
[4:21] the when we talk about
[4:24] about we are not talking about the book
[4:26] with papers like this
[4:35] but we are talking about
[4:38] Authority the power and authority that
[4:41] was given which was in the
[4:48] hand that Authority which was called the
[4:50] title which cannot
[4:53] be contested
[5:03] that's what we are reading here John saw
[5:06] a book in the hand
[5:09] of the book was which was sealed with
[5:13] which was sealed
[5:19] with that book is nothing else but it's
[5:22] that title that him had lost
[5:33] that that that that
[5:36] book The Lamb got it from heaven and he
[5:40] descend with it and give it to the

[6:26] the the the right to have the eternal
[6:28] life and the right to have
[6:34] authority if you look at clearly in this
[6:37] message God has opened the Seven
[6:44] Seals and we believe that whatam had
[6:46] lost it has been returned back to the
[6:53] bride now that is being called by
[6:56] Prophet that it's a title which canot be
[7:03] conted even the devil cannot contest us

[17:24] says that lamb was far in the eternity
[17:34] and the lamb came from eternity and
[17:37] toward the
[17:40] human and when he coming
[17:44] closer I
[17:51] I I was I was trying to show you what
[17:54] what was happening in eternity
[18:02] the first things that was
[18:06] shown it was the the the Lamb of God who
[18:10] was
[18:11] killed who was slain
[18:21] before the first thing that happened in
[18:24] the history of
[18:25] redemption is the the the lamb was l
[18:30] world he came

[20:15] he there were some people
[20:34] what that's
[20:40] what that's what giving the
[20:44] manifestation the
[20:48] difference the difference between what
[20:51] is anointing
[20:52] us anointing they had people in the
[20:55] other
[20:56] churches is
[20:59] that Dimension that Adam had L very
[21:03] different with what is happening in
[21:05] other
[21:14] church this is
[21:18] something the creation of this world
[21:23] Amen you've got the value which is hiden
[21:28] maybe you you not see
[21:31] that let's move
[21:34] [Music]
[21:36] forward in the message who's
[21:46] God it says look the communion that Adam
[21:51] lost when he
[21:54] fall restor that to us when he died
[22:05] take a man back to the communion with
[22:09] God the fellowship
[22:15] God now the the church is being risen
[22:19] the church is moved up moved up at that
[22:23] fellowship with God and it is a
[22:27] communion amen like Adam who had it at
[22:31] the
[22:38] beginning after the of
[22:40] Jesus what happen when
[22:45] the
[22:51] get it back in the position in which
[22:55] Adam before
[23:01] to return the church back to the
[23:03] position where Adam was at the
[23:08] beginning what what beginning I'm
[23:10] talking about the original
[23:13] beginning the beginning there was a word
[23:16] the Word was God and that's the
[23:18] beginning I'm talking about that's the
[23:20] beginning where the bride is going
[23:24] back let me ask you one
[23:26] question where where where was the
[23:29] Garden of
[23:31] Heaven who knows who knows

[24:03] we are talking about here is not
[24:05] something natural it's something
[24:08] Supernatural you cannot
[24:17] see that's why I was talking in the
[24:19] morning that it's it's a space from
[24:22] eternity which came toward a humankind
[24:29] and when a man sined he lost
[24:38] that now you see what comes to us is
[24:40] something from
[24:45] eternity now

[32:33] in his
[32:34] church and we going to see that how he's
[32:38] going to work in his
[32:42] church that is the church that I Bram
[32:46] wants to see what kind of church brother
[32:49] Bram Sing
[32:52] Sing trying to exercise trying to work
[32:57] kind of church I want to see and that's
[33:00] the church I want to be
[33:02] in
[33:04] amen it now the believer today most
[33:08] people say I'm a good man I'm paying T
[33:13] I'm doing this I'm good member that's
[33:16] fine but that's a moral life
[33:20] amen moral life
[33:28] you are a member of this church you pay
[33:31] your that's not the problem that I'm
[33:34] preaching
[33:36] here I'm preaching about the people who
[33:38] are in
[33:42] Christ being a good member moral life
[33:46] that's not about the
[33:51] book A lot of people who are good they
[33:54] do that
[33:59] you you you go to to to Rome you're
[34:02] going to
[34:04] see the priest they walking like that
[34:07] they don't steal they don't
[34:10] smoke that's not that's not what makes
[34:13] difference the difference
[34:16] is a man
[34:27] pra Our God who in heaven not our God in
[34:34] here you worship the God in your
[34:40] heart if that thing happen the healing
[34:43] of sick this will be something easy we
[34:45] must exercise step in God yes sir and we
[34:49] start caring Victory
[34:53] amen God in us waking and showing some
[35:01] sign being a good good member it's moral
[35:15] life and that is not our
[35:18] message speaking in Tong is not our
[35:24] message possess
[35:27] and lost and if you have that you not a
[35:32] man like
[35:35] other you are one of the
[35:39] eternity and on Earth nobody can touch
[35:46] you today the church is going back to
[35:51] what that's where that's kind of church
[35:54] where I want to
[35:56] be even if you are a good member that's
[35:59] okay but it's a moral life
[36:04] now I don't have anything bad that I can
[36:07] talk
[36:09] about but it's not what I want to it's
[36:12] not what I'm preaching
[36:14] you
[36:16] Jesus he judge a person if he's a
[36:23] Christian for Jesus to say you are a
[36:25] believer
[36:28] he look at the character that you
[36:31] have what kind of character he talks he
[36:34] talks
[36:38] about his life his own life in you
[36:42] that's what he wants to see not not
[36:45] moral
[36:46] life for you to be a believer for Jesus
[36:51] is looking at his character in
[36:54] you it doesn't look at the and
[37:03] Christ wants to see that book in
[37:09] you look at the last word of
[37:13] Jesus he say
[37:16] go preach the good news to
[37:21] all those that believe they will be
[37:23] baptized and they will be
[37:25] saved those who not believe will be
[37:28] condemned now look at every
[37:33] church now we are going to see that the
[37:35] churches are even far from the
[37:39] reality and they they are far behind
[37:42] from the
[37:44] thing it is the sign that has to follow
[37:47] the
[37:51] Believers the people goes to church and
[37:54] they are baptized
[37:57] the people goes to to the church and
[38:03] they now when we talk about the sign
[38:05] that has to follow those that believe we
[38:07] don't see we don't
[38:11] see now it it has to be that that sign
[38:15] for it to be to be seen it means the
[38:18] honors of the sign has to
[38:20] be to be
[38:25] seen and pick some the disciples among
[38:30] the people with great
[38:34] joy and they preach the word

[40:01] enough in that message he said
[40:07] this when God made
[40:10] everything and he saw that everything
[40:12] was good now he
[40:15] said let's make a man in our
[40:19] image and that man
[40:21] is a being on on
[40:24] earth now look
[40:29] before he was Loos the logos came out of
[40:33] him and he became
[40:37] a on Earth and that what what happened
[40:40] the beginning and he said let's make
[40:43] make a man in our image and that man was
[40:47] made in His image and he was was
[40:54] Supernatural if you want to see that
[40:56] read Genesis
[41:07] and there was another man who can
[41:10] cultivate the soil can the
[41:19] soil God cre that man with the the dust
[41:23] of the head
[41:30] in Genesis 28 he create a
