inside Jesus Christ amen when you receive him when you receive Christ you have everything you have need of in this life's journey once you receive Christ down on the inside everything you have need of from this moment on to the end of your journey even through to the rapture as inside Christ and when you receive him into your heart you receive everything that you have need of a man let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father I just pray Lord that tonight Lord that your message would get across and all of its purity father Lord not my words Lord but your words Lord not that I would speak of my own my own thoughts Lord just your thoughts and Lord that we know that this is possible father because you gave the promise wherever two or three are gathered in your name you'd be right there in the midst of them Lord and throughout the ages you have proved father that you were able to select Oracle's out of me Lord and you gave gifts unto men so we claim these gifts father as part of the ministry though we claim these gifts Lord that you for the perfecting of the Saints would speak to us tonight and nor those tonight as we can go home we can go home and say that surely Jesus Christ showed up tonight and we have been made closer into his image like him Lord we just thank you Father we you desire to give you the preeminence tonight father or that we might be made and your image and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we turn the service in your hands and your name we pray amen amen let's just turn in our Bibles to colossians chapter 1 amen will read from the fourteenth verse on down through the 18th and then we'll go over to John chapter 15 and Auctions 1:14 it says in whom we have the redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him we were all things created that are in heaven that are in the earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning and the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence amen and we want to give him the preeminence tonight Amen let's turn over to you and turn over to John chapter 15 I want to speak a message called the preeminence of Jesus Christ John 15 verse 6 jesus saith unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if he had known me he should have known my father also and from henceforth you have known him he his forth you know him and have seen you know they didn't realize they had seen the father a malicious you can be seated we'll just go straight on into the message you know one thing that amazes me is Christians that will start upon the path that will claim the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then somehow in their lives neglect to give Jesus Christ the preeminence amen now now Jesus Christ is the head of the body and for our body to not give preeminence unto the head that is a sick amen if a body does not give preeminence to the head that body is sick Amen if you if you're if you're suddenly your body ceased to give the preeminence to your own thinking to your own mind you had run to the doctor right away you know his brother branham he said that you know people enjoy alcohol and enjoy drinking that they will drink until their mind has completely thrown themselves - they don't even know what's going on they'll stumble around they'll trip and the fall they'll say things they shouldn't say they'll do things they shouldn't do and they are powerless to have control over their own body because of the influence of the alcohol it's in their system and brother ban says they'll go to the bar and they'll pay money to drink that and so that they can enter into that state but then if somehow they entered into that state without the influence of alcohol they would run to every doctor in the country trying to find out what's wrong with them now if they they'll they'll pay money to enter into that state so that their body is no longer giving preeminence to the head but their body is giving preeminence to the spirit of the alcohol but if somehow they were to slip into that state of mind without the influence of alcohol right away they would run to the doctor looking to find out what's wrong and Stan and it amazes me when I see Christians who have named the name of Christ amen who but who somehow are not giving the preeminence the they claim be a part of the body of Christ but they are not giving preeminence to the head which is Christ amen and now the body of Christ is ran by a spirit amen there is a spirit within this body it's not a dead body it's a live living body amen and there is a spirit that gives that body life and that body must give priam under that spirit because the head because from the head gives control through throughout the whole body through that spirit the spirit is life if the life leaves the body it doesn't matter whether the head is still attached or not amen if the life leaves the body then the body cannot listen to the head amen but there is a life that flows through that body and that life is there because of the Spirit amen and so is the body of Christ connected to the head must have the spirit the life of the body which is the life of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost amen and by giving preeminence amen and and by be giving preeminence to the Lord Jesus Christ it seals it creates a sealing amen so that you cannot listen to any other spirit amen when you give the preeminence to that body all other spirits are sealed away from you and you cannot give the preeminence to the other spirits you give the previs to the one which is the head Christ amen and when that happens then all of a sudden what happens to your actions your actions are whatever the head says for you to do which the head is Christ because you gave him the preeminence therefore now the Holy Spirit can tell you what to do and also and also also in your actions our actions our Holy Ghost actions your thoughts our Holy Ghost thoughts amen your your your your emotions are now Holy Ghost emotions controlled by the control tower of the Holy Ghost but when you see a somewhat who names the name of Christ and their emotions are dragging them off over here and dragging them off over there and there are no longer giving preeminence to the head which is Christ but they're giving preeminence to some other spirit that has dragging them off to the other side there's something wrong they are not giving preeminence to the body amen now he is the image of the invisible God he is the firstborn of every creature for by him we're all things created that are in heaven or visible and invisible whether they be Thrones dominions principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him you know one thing you know is you know my viewpoint I grew up in a Pentecostal churches and one thing about growing up in Pentecostal churches and seeing all the phenomenon I I grew up with people seeing demons and and telling dreams and miracles happening and and all those things I grew up seeing all the phenomenon the speaking in tongues interpretations I saw all of that but yet when I ever I heard about the Holy Ghost it was always this object that gave you power to do this phenomenon if you wanted to get ahead in your Christian life you might seek after this Holy Ghost so that it would give you the power to do this certain phenomena or do this nifty thing over here or the safety thing over there but the thing of it is is that Holy Ghost is not just a power it's not just speaking in tongues it's not you know you can't just say that's the evidence it's not just this little neat thing over here or this little thing we we do over here over there but it is Jesus Christ himself the one that we are giving the preeminence to amen he is the the one that created the world by his own word amen he is the one that is before all things he is the one we worship it's not a third person a man it's not the lesser of the Trinity it's not the one that no one ever thinks about in the Trinity where they give all the premiums to the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost is this little spirit off over here but he is Christ himself the word and he is the one that is the that is giving the power to the body the life to the body to do the things that the head was done and when you give the preeminence to Jesus Christ you are creating that link between the head and the body so that the head can have can have that can do exactly what the head wants done the body is acting upon what the control tower says to do because it is linked the body and the head are now linked so tightly so closely that as soon as the head says arm go out it goes out amen leg kick up it kicks up you know feet move why go do think act talk live love amen because you are linked you have given preeminence to the head amen and the head has answered and the body has been filled with the Holy Ghost and you are alive and well in him we live and move and have our being why because we gave Christ the preeminence but it is possible that the body could fail to give the head the preeminence is it possible it is possible Amen it is possible for the body of the Lord Jesus Christ to cool off to fall asleep to slumber amen and now a sudden even though the head is still talking is still trying to act but now the the body has gotten sluggish and to where the head says go do this and you're like oh is that and you're in this dream world and you're no longer acting upon what the word is saying because the word is still speaking he that thoughts are still there that the thoughts are still speaking but just can't get the body to act why because your as some others slumber yours you're not awake you're not giving preeminence the body is now tired it's asleep it's slumbering because it's not giving preeminence to the head amen that is not the position that the body is to be in amen there was a time where a cry went out at the time of the wedding and wake yourself wake up go ye out to meet him the bridegroom cometh the time has arrived go out and the cry went out go out to meet him and they all woke up and they began to trim their lamps and five of them found out that they were connected to the head and they could take instructions from the control tower and five of them found out that they had no connection to the control tower they were not connected to the head the head was speaking but though the foolish virgins couldn't couldn't get the instructions to act out in their body because there was no link there was no power there was no life a man there was no fire in their vessel amen amen that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all the fullness dwell in who Christ Christ is the Anointed One he was anointed he was the reason that there was an ark of the covenant he is the reason there was a Horn of oil he is the reason there was a Sabbath he is the reason there was a rock in the wilderness he is the reason there was manna coming down from heaven amen he was the reason for all of that be yet late when they they followed all of those little things but yet when he came they didn't recognize him the very head came to the body but the body said we reject him amen what a shame amen let's turn over to theya chapter 28 giving christ the preeminence he deserves a previous test has now he'd done all things well Isaiah 28 verse 7 I think about the body should be in direct control from the head the body should be now the body of Christ what will be preached last Wednesday we preach on the body of Christ we are the body of Christ we call ourselves so if I ask you brother are you part of the body of Christ and say yes amen I am a part of the body of Christ then the head should have the preeminence for it to sin down it's instructions and you would act upon whatever those instructions are amen now we also talked about what drunkenness drunkenness causes the body to not do act upon the spirit of the body but to act upon some other spirit amen verse 7 but they also have erred through wine and through strong drink are out of the way the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink they are swallowed up of wine they are out of the way through strong drink they err in vision and they stumble in judgment for all the tables are full of vomit and filthiness so if there is no place clean whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to understand doctrine to them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts watch verse tenure for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little what's he doing he's building something amen what precept upon precept Commandment upon commandment word upon word he is building a building he is building a house amen he is building a pyramid he is building a temple amen a place where the calf stones in come down amen but in order for the capstone to come down there first must be a cornerstone a man soy's he do he starts building word upon word he sends down the cornerstone which is Jesus Christ amen and everything he is the word and everything must be in line from that one cornerstone and the walls go out from the cornerstone lying upon line here a little there a little amen and it's what those lines what are those lines have you ever seen how they build a building they set the corners first when you're building a foundation you set the corners first amen and you what before you can build the corners first you have to set out the lines amen so then what do you do you build the lines you dig the hole and then you get a plumb bob and you and you go and you make sure that the the bottom of the wall is going to be right with it from the top you have to bring the thought from up above and translate the higher thought using the plumb line all the way down to the bottom amen so what so that the corners will be straight they'll be square this way they'll be squared this way and then we square this way a mint line upon line line upon line here a little and there low it's all correct with the cornerstone he says for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people then he says to whom he sayeth well he's speaking to a people what's he doing he's trying to get a people to be in line with what the Spirit is saying amen who so he went to whom he sayeth this is the rest wherewith he may cause the weary to rest and this is their refreshing yet they would not hear now we're going to keep going on later down here in a little bit but think about it what'd he do he created the world in six days the seventh day he rested from all of his works then he told the people honor the seventh day and rest and that will be that is the Sabbath rest and then wait til I'm going to you're gonna enter into the promised land that is the rest where you cease from your own works amen amen and what would they do it to Hebrews he says but they entered in because not because of unbelief all those years they observe the Sabbath they observe the Sabbath they are so faithful throughout the desert to observe the Sabbath but when they got up to the true Sabbath they could not enter in because of unbelief word upon word Sabbath upon Sabbath Sabbath upon Sabbath obedience upon obedience but they came to up to the final line their attire foundation was built upon the wrong foundation so so even though they had the form they were building a building they had some corners they had some obedience but the foundation wasn't there there was no cornerstone so everything they built upon all those Sabbath rearing all that when they got up to the River Jordan no we can't do that they could not enter in because they didn't give the head of the preeminence now they would give previous to the form and the function they gave preeminence to obeying the Sabbath they gave preeminence to you know speaking in tongues so doing this or doing whatever they gave previous to all these things that came to church we can't wake out but they didn't give preeminence to the head which is Christ says but the word of the Lord were searching was unto them precept upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon here a little and there though that they might go and fall backwards and be broken and snared and taken God didn't stop building but because they had no foundation amen verse 16 let's uh think you know and Luke it says in Luke remember Jesus gave the parable he said talking about the man that builded a house a man he said that there was a man who built his house he what'd he do he hurt the boy he is given a parable about those that heard Jesus's Saints and he compared to men those that heard Jesus the sayings and did them and those who heard Jesus sayings and wouldn't do them they both heard one was a doer and one was not amen so and he gives up parable the one that heard and did is the one that was like a man which built a house he dig down deep and he laid the foundation upon a rock amen and he built up his house and when the flood arose the stream beat vehemently upon the house and could not shake it because it was founded upon a rock they gave preeminence to the rock but the other man the he that heard and did not was like a man that didn't dig down to the rock but just started building this house right away right away he started coming to church they meant started observing all the observances spada's ties his offerings and all those things a man came to church day-in day-out but he didn't give preeminence to the foundation which is Jesus Christ amen now remember this building has a cornerstone the capstone is going to come down to it but if your building doesn't have this cornerstone the capstone ain't coming to that type of a building it's coming to one building the one that gives the premise to the head amen let's go back to Isaiah 28 in verse 14 it says wherefore hear the word of the Lord ye scornful men that ruled this people which is in Jerusalem because he have said we have made a covenant with death and with hell are we at agreement what were they doing they believed that they could do a little bit of sin they had a covenant that sin could only come so far I wouldn't overtake them they talked to the devil and told the devil you just stare right there a mint they may have an agreement with hell the hell can come into my life right here but stop right there they made an agreement with death I can accept a little pinch of death in my life by not giving premisis of the word here of all gift freeman's to the world over there and they had these agreements with the devil because he if we made a covenant with death and with hell we are at agreement when the overflowing scourge shall pass through it won't come unto us for we have made lies our refuge and under falsehood we have hid ourselves they set in the church he's talking about the people in Jerusalem verse 14 says wherefore hear the word of Lord East scornful me and what are they doing there scouring the word that rule this people which is in Jerusalem they had made a covenant they were there seeking they were seeking refuge under the lies while proclaiming to be the bride of Jehovah amen and now we claim to be the Bride of Christ amen how they built their entire Christian walk up upon a lie because they would not get preeminence under Christ the head so they said that when the overflowing scourge shall come through and won't hit us now you can live a long time with your agreements with death and hell right those will stand for Oh quite awhile and people will stand with one foot in the world and one foot in the church for a long long long long time but one of these days that flood is gonna come you know that prayer but we were I just read you it from Luke 6 he is like the man the man that heard the word but didn't do the word was like a man that built his house without a foundation now the house did get finished they got finished he built his house without a foundation it was built upon the sand he got it all up he put the shingles on put it in the windows put the door lock the door and everything is good and well but when this when the floods arose shook the whole house down and great was the ruin of the house Amen why he had made it he was taking shelter underneath lies that he didn't need the solid rock which was Christ the word we have to preeminence to the head we have to give preeminence to Christ the word amen we can we can we can do all kinds of religious things we can we can listen to the messages we can talk the talk we can do all those things but if we don't get preeminence to Christ the word you are taking refuge in a pile of lies and when the stream the stream with the river will flow the flood will come amen it will beat upon your house amen and if he'll find out what your house was built upon and whether you gave preeminence to the word which is Christ or not amen amen God gave them a Sabbath day and they followed it he gave them manna and they ate it he gave them a rock in the wilderness and they drank from the water amen he gives us the Holy Ghost we sit here we worship in the services we we enjoy the feeling of his presence we we drink from the we say oh my that was a great sermon and all those religious fine religious things well given the offering and all that but now you know we eat the manna from heaven but but one of these days will come up to a point where we'll find out if we've been given preeminence to Christ the head or if we become drunken and given preeminence to some other spirit besides the Holy Spirit amen and that becomes when we don't give preeminence to the word which is Christ amen Christ is the word he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a foundation build a house though this house with no foundation let's turn over to Colossians chapter 2 you can get away with with with not following the word for so long that it will fool you and you will be fooled by being foolish you will become fooled into thinking that you are okay amen amen people will get lulled into a false sense of security by standing on something other than the word their own thought that they came up with that something that Satan gave them a little thought I can get off the word over here and I'll be okay away from the word and I can stand and then they come to church the next Sunday and why God didn't seem to notice at all I seem to have gotten away with it and you stand week after week after week and you you know boy I I see Mike I can get away from this word pretty far and I'm doing okay I can still worship I can still pray I can still do this like I still preach I guess so do all these things and yet I'm so far off the word now I'm no longer given the word the Prima it's because I think I'm okay I've made what have you done you've made an agreement with hell because you can say I can be this far from the word and still keep hell at bay hell you just stop right there I'm going to get close to you but I don't want you to take over my life now right I don't want I don't want the devil to take over my life I don't want the devil to to overflow me but I don't want necessarily the word to have the preeminence so I'm gonna stand right here between the two and I made an agreement with hell I made a creamy with death that the you will stop right there and you're looking at my you stopped right there I got away with it and how long someone can get away with being off of the word and their their agreement with hell seems to stand and so there they stand boldly between the two thinking that they got away with it amen clashes to verse six as he therefore received Jesus Christian as he have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walky in him rooted and built up in him established in the faith as he have been taught they had they have to listen you have to listen to the preacher now don't you amen as he have been taught abounding therein in with Thanksgiving abounding your your alive in the church giving Thanksgiving staying upon the word that you have heard amen verse eight beware watch out be careful beware lest any man spoil you now how does how can you be spoiled you know the word spoil there can be a couple things either one you turn rotten or the army of enemy comes in and Rob's away the things that are most valuable in your life amen always spirit the most valuable thing we have is the sealing of the Holy Ghost amen and the evidence of Christ walking and living moving in our lives amen but he that the thief comes to steal kill and destroy and robbed that experience out of your life and beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy what is philosophy just another way of thinking some type of thinking is not upon the word amen and vain deceit they meant what you've deceived yourself and your own vanity that's when you get all the way over here and you're far off from the word and in your vanity you think that your barrier with hell is gonna hold up you don't realize that's just a paper wall and Satan could come right through that any time he wants to and because and you think that you can get back to the word anytime he comes through you don't realize you've been separated from the Word of God and people will stand there and think that they can get back to the Word of God anytime they want to amen jesus said be careful because the thing that you seemeth to have you might find out that it doesn't actually belong to you amen beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men oh it's ok to do that after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily and ye are complete in him amen in him dwells the fullness of the God we gotta give him the preeminence we gotta do it every day we gotta give him the rule of our life if we don't you'll be like those and Isaiah chapter 28 making an agreement with hell that I can be this far from the word and he'll won't touch me that's a dangerous place to be amen let's turn over to Hebrews chapter 3 Hebrews three verse 18 talking about those in the wilderness he says and to whom swear he that they should not intern it at his rest but them that believe not what do you do he swore they will never enter into my rest they started they left Egypt they followed Moses they listen to what the prophets said they did all that the Prophet told them they rejoice in church they they they they believed in the Sabbath they followed all those things by Jeep but God Himself was swearing by himself they will never receive the Holy Ghost they will never enter into my rest why because they just would not believe they didn't build their house upon the foundation amen so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief let's go to verse 1 of chapter 2 the next chapter let us therefore fear lest a promise being left of us entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it so there is a promise of entering into his rest amen no God created the world in six days the seventh day he rested from all his works amen he gave them the Sabbath as a type of that saying there's a chance an opportunity of you entering into your rest also amen and they are obedient to the type but they didn't come to the fulfillment now we have a type we have the fulfillment which is the Holy Ghost where you cease from your works and your own ideas your own thinking your own actions amen your own drunkenness your own foolishness and you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and now your what you have you are a new creation you are a brand-new man you are no longer living your own life but you have a life of Christ is now living in you and you've been transformed into the image of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and now you are the body of the Christ upon the earth amen you know every farmer when he plants his field was he do he Labor's he Labor's he Labor's and everything that he does after the winter is over as soon as the ground starts thawing he starts working he's got a he's got a plow up his feet he's got to put in all the nutrients he he does all those things he prays for rain and and he then he prays that the field won't be too wet and he he struggles he looks he watches he waits he it finally he gets the seed into the ground and what does he do he rests because he knows that the the power of the seed that he put into the ground will bring forth the crop that he is looking for and then he can rest and was he do he ceases from his own works now what happens if he decides to rest going through all that labor to prepare the ground and then rest before the seed actually gets in the ground and man won't have a crop they'll have a lot of weeds they won't have a crop amen you got a you got a cease from your own works once the seed is in the ground so once that word enters into your heart and you realize you believe on it it's yours you accept you say Lord I believe your word Lord I have got you latch on to that then you know you're gonna get a crop a mint why they entered in not because they didn't believe Amen but for the man that receives the word believes it and then that man is gonna get a crop amen and why do people fall away was it in here to enter into his rest they didn't do it they didn't rest upon Jesus Christ so what is it troubles came something came and instead of giving their troubles over to Jesus Christ they fall away because they lost their foundation amen they made an agreement with hell and the flood came and destroyed their entire house amen what happens because people will leave the word the word didn't change but they left the word and Satan just he slow walks you off the word you knew you were doing wrong you knew you were doing wrong but you allowed yourself be slow walked off the word and they'll sudden the flood comes and you want to run back to the word but you're so far from it and you had the agreement with hell and it passed over you let's go back to Isaiah 20 I want to read that again now that we've drawn the picture let's read that one more time after they fell what verse 7 they fell through their drinking they drank the strong drink they started being obedient to a spirit other than the Holy Spirit amen so they weren't given Christ the head the preeminence so the another spirit entered in and they gave the preeminence to that other spirit so but the whole time God is giving out his message every Sunday his message every Wednesday his message on the tapes amen God still giving out he's getting out what's he doing precept upon precept God is building a house amen but they couldn't enjoy this house because they were taken out of the way verse 10 for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there little a mint for with the stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people amen us talking about the Spirit of God speaking to the church amen people will say Austin speaking in tongues and they don't realize what speaking in tongues is they don't realize what it means for the Holy Spirit to speak to the church amen it's not just some nifty thing for us a gate banghak get going hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches he meant the Spirit is talking to the churches isn't he amen to whom he sayeth wait for with stammering lips and no tongue he'll speak to this people what people the people are drunken they're listening to some of their spirit to whom he sayeth this is the rest wherewith he caused the weary arrest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear he's standing there he's Christ is standing there holding his word saying this is the line this is the precept this is the spirit that makes this happen this is the Holy Ghost stay right with us stay right in it stay with what you've been taught stay with what you're hearing stay with what's been preached you stay with the gospel stay with what the pastor's saying but yet they would not hear this is the refreshing be it they would not hear but the word of the Lord was still unto them verse sir precip was still upon the precept precept upon precept the line was soap on the line the line is helpline God he gave to him here a little there a little that they might go and what they do they fell backwards they were broken they were snared and they were taken why because Christ the word was here but they were off over there amen verse 14 where for here the word of the Lord he's scornful meant their rule as people which is in Jerusalem washe was read verse 15 again because here is the cause of all this the cause that they fell back the cause they were broken even though God was building his house lying upon line they still fell back they're still broken why because they had made a covenant with death and with hell they were an agreement and when the overflowing scourge shall pass through it shall not come unto us for we have made lies our refuge and under falsehood we have hid ourselves verse 16 the entire time God has laid in Zion a foundation a stone a tried stone a precious cornerstone a sure foundation and he that believeth shall not make haste amen amen you rest upon that rock now even the gates of Hell come against you amen though the stream beats upon that house Amen though it shakes it will never fall down why because that man has built his house upon a rock he gave Christ the word the preeminence amen and it came here a little and there a little Sunday after Sunday Wednesday after Wednesday every time I read my Bible every time I prayed in the morning every time I opened it up and Cape kept giving it he's building the house here a little there a little here a little little but that because that man has his found his house is being built upon a foundation now you can still come to Sunday every Sunday and every Wednesday you hear the same message but if you're not standing upon the foundation which is Jesus Christ the flood will come and you will be sucked away you are making your house built sheltered around with lies and it cannot stand amen amen upon Christ the solid rock I stand amen all other ground is sinking sand amen and Christ has to have the preeminence in her life yes I had the preeminence over every habit over every habit he has to have the preeminence over every temptation Amen yes to have the preeminence over every shortcoming every weakness in our lives Christ has to have the preeminence Amen we have to give it to him amen why because Christ is still the mediator who has been may he is standing there to mediate between two which is us and the perfect word between us and the judgment of God between us and God's righteous judgment God has a righteous judgment amen amen and that righteous judgment is true amen now remember you know God talks about the plummet line throughout the Bible if you ever heard him talk about the plummet line though the plumb bob you know you when you're building a house and you or you you or you want to take something a point that is way up here and you want to build something didn't you want to start here upon the foundation and as you build it up you want make sure it meets this point it doesn't meet over here it doesn't meet over there I mean doesn't meet over there but because so what you do take a string you tie a heavyweight on the string and you put it right at the point right there and you wait till stops moving and then you make your mark upon the dirt you have transferred the line from the higher place down to the lower place God's righteous judgment his righteous word is established in the heavens forever he has established his word it shall never ever change its established assured in the heavens and he has marked it up here and then he has this line he marks it down the earth and he says you stand right there Amen what does he do he has the ability God has the ability to take His perfect word and transfer it into the dirt into your body into your life amen to make sure that you are in the exact same points was Ethan he starts building you've been stood right where the foundation is you're built upon Christ you're going up to Christ you start with Christ the cornerstone you end with Christ the capstone amen amen let's just in closing let's go over to second Timothy Christ has to have the preeminence over everything in our lives every temptation every habit every weakness Christ has to have the temptation has to have the preeminence 2nd Timothy chapter 2 verse 19 second Timothy 2:19 nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure God has a foundation amen having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity amen when you believe when you have those two things in your life you believe you know you were chosen by God you know who you are God has come across the threshold of your life and revealed unto you that you know who you are revealed unto you that you are a part of the bride of Lord Jesus Christ you are flesh of his flesh you are a body a body of his body bone of his bone amen when you have that revelation you have that seal God knows those there is you say I am part of the body of Christ how do you say that you say by revelation you say that's me Amen well there's another fold of that the second part of the verse nevertheless first verse 19 says nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his and everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity that's how you know that you're gonna get from the foundation to the capstone God placed a cornerstone upon the earth now everybody has their own he placed the corner so what's he doing where'd he place it in Zion God has placed a cornerstone in Zion what was that cornerstone it was the first stone of the building God was building a house think about it they built the temped a the the the temple and the time of David and they said this is the temple and they got destroyed they built it again in the time of Herod and they the disciples took Jesus on tour of it and they're showing oh look at all these great buildings and all those things looking at this great artwork and they took Jesus and they're walking through and they're trying to show off trying to impress them you know and I don't know I know you were born off over in Nazareth and I don't know if you spent a lot of time here in the temple but we just want to show you you know we've grown up around here and we know this place really well and we're pretty impressed with this building we think this temple Herod's temple is really splendid you know this is the temple of Jehovah look how great it is it took us 46 years to build this place and this temple this is the temple of Jehovah and Jesus looked at him and said tear this building down I will rebuild it again in three days and they looked at him and he said we spent far father spent 46 years building this temple we built we quit and we took the cornerstone we hewed it out of the rock and we placed it over here and we put our inscription upon it this is Herod's temple and we built everything off of that corner and for 46 years we put all of our effort into this building until the final touch at the pinnacle of the house Herod's temple was complete and you say that you will you could tear this down and rebuild it in three dates and yet the prophecy clear back at the time of David said the cat left corner stone that the builders rejected became the head of the corner they rejected the corner stone which was Christ and they took some other stone some stone selected by man and not the stone they're selected by God and they built a house and God tore down Titus 80 70 they burned it down and great was the room of the house now he rebuilt it three days well he rose again on the third day he was that cornerstone and let me tell you we must give preeminence to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ if we fail to give preeminence to the Lord you are so the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ every single thing we build is in ruins you know and I and you know I grew up in all going to all kinds of different churches I've seen all kinds of religion in my life and let me tell you I got sick of it and tell you what when I come to the message and I see people not giving Prima's to the Lord Jesus Christ I don't want any part of it because I have one cornerstone that I stand upon and that's Jesus Christ and I will give preeminence to one I remember you know there was a time you know as a teenager that I quit calling myself a Christian because I had seen so many things go on in the name of Christianity that I said I'm gonna just gonna call myself a follower of Jesus Christ in my own my own you know young Christian mind I had gone from church to church to church and I just I could always find a couple people that were more interested in Christ than the world but just a few such a small few I finally I was just I was sick of it I kind of I was like Lord I'm just gonna call him and call myself a Christian was gonna call myself a follower of Christ because I don't want to be linked with those that are standing between the world and Christ and so so when I you know what and I studied I studied other churches I read about the Methodists I read about the Lutheran's I read about and I I marveled because I had friends that were Baptists I had a lot of friends or Baptists and they would make fun of me for being Pentecostal and you know and all those things and you know making fun of all the gifts in the church and everything and and I was thought Lord you had me born in a Pentecostal family what would have happened if I'd been born and a Baptist family I would be just like them believing the Baptist theology and I saw our Lord if you had me been if I would have been born in a Catholic family I would have grown up believing the Catholic doctrine and these were my thoughts as a teenager and I like Lord where are you and where is your church and I went from church to church I and I finally and I looked and I always saw how every church was created by a revival you know and I looked at the read about his oozes Street and all those things and and and I looked and I saw that there was always there was always a revival that got me in started and then after a while they would drift away and then after a hundred years or so the people that lived in that church were no longer had the same zeal they're no longer on the same foundation so those that founded the church stood upon a solid rock Christ but when they set their doctrine here they were off the word and then there and then word they got off further and further and further amen and drifted away from the word so that the grandchildren canola's Holy Spirit couldn't lead them they are no longer connected to Christ the head Amen so when I came to this message I was pretty excited when I I don't know if you can envision how excited I was to hear the things that brother Graham said about denominations because I'd seen I was sick of it I was tired of it amen and I started listening I had listened to the tapes day in day out day in day out and then one day I heard somebody start talking about creating a message cheer in the morning and I wanted nothing to do with it so I'm just telling you my thoughts I wanted nothing to do with a message search into one because I was excited about brother Bram's message but when I found out that there were entire churches that had been following the message for 50 years I thought oh well this is gonna be the same thing I've seen all over that that they might have been true 50 years ago but there is no way that they have kept the revival up over 50 years and I am NOT interested in building a church here in des moines you know I'm not that was my thoughts now I wasn't right in my thinking I really was not right in my thinking because I do believe in the local ministry I do believe in a local church and what I didn't realize was the thing that keeps the church is giving Christ they had the preeminence and every single thing we do not just in token not just in word but in our every action and our very in our prayers we are so connected to Christ the head that we love him we adore him we love everything that he does we love everything that he says we are in love with the Lord Jesus Christ amen we love the way he acts the way that we love the way he moves and we hate everything that is against him in his word and we refuse to allow anything to draw us off away and the only way we can do that is by following the leadership of the Holy Ghost so my thinking was that there was no way that there could be a message church that could still be in living according to the vision of brother Branham I was wrong it's possible it's possible but there's only one way that it's possible and that's by the Holy Ghost the church has to be alive amen and it won't be a denomination it can never be a denomination when brother Branham says they will never denominates he was talking about a Holy Ghost filled Church it cannot it's the bride what'd he do he was a prophet he put forth the word there will be a bride of the Lord Jesus Christ now when brother Branham said that where did that word go the word went out he was a true prophet of God and when a prophet prophesies that word is a seed and it has to go out and bring forth of its kind amen and let me die I'm here to announce today that that word has come into my heart amen is bringing forth of its kind amen and I am a part of the bride of Lord Jesus Christ I've heard it I believe it I accept it yes and amen amen and every single promise of the book is mine amen I believe it I will be a part of the Bride of Christ so there's certain promises that are coming my way and they are that I will be without spot without wrinkle I will be believing when he comes there will be faith on this earth when he comes when the son of man comes because it will be in me amen and I will be believing I will enter into his rest amen these signs will follow them to believe and I am a believer amen and that is the truth I will says every true church will write a book of Acts behind it that's what brother Graham said Amen well that word is a seat amen and I've received the seed and I am resting on that seat because I have entered into his rest amen i the word has been planted inside of my heart my trust has been playing in your Savior amen so like the farmer I have done the labor I've cleared out all the rocks of unbelief I've cleared away all the weeds I've good you know I've let everyone the name with the name of Christ depart from iniquity amen I've done the best I know how to do to do that amen and what I am rusty why am i resting because the seed has been planted in my life and the Holy Ghost will water it will see it grow a mint and day in day out I am gonna cherish that seed and I'm gonna keep my ground clean amen and watch by giving preeminence to the Lord Jesus Christ all the fears I had as a teenager will be taken away because we're not here to live in fear we're here to live in faith amen amen we don't have to be lukewarm we don't have to be lukewarm we've been given permission to not be lukewarm through the fire of the Holy Ghost amen and I believe a man let's just stand hey man god is good isn't he Saints hey man let's just pray Heavenly Father our sincerest desire Lord is to be real Christians Lord connected to the head which is you Jesus Christ Lord a life filled with the Holy Ghost Lord when you gave the Holy Ghost the way that you described it has never left my memory Lord Lord you said that we would be filled with the Holy Ghost you said we'd be baptized into the Holy Ghost you said it'd be the baptism of fire Lord that we'd be anointed Lord amen that you would be in us Christ the head in us Lord and those those descriptions Lord will never leave me Lord because I believe that a man can be immersed and the Holy Ghost a man that he can grow up his feet is upon the foundation that when the when the stream rises up Lord and when the when he'll tries to overrun it Amen that we still stand we don't fall away we stand because upon Christ the solid rock we stand we're beholding the head which is Christ we have become real Christians Lord you said that that many in this last day would be lukewarm the Lord that we could hear what the Spirit is saying to the church and we could be ally of Lord and remaining when you come or it's a promise you said we you gave us permission Lord to be real Christians when you gave us your word and Lord we won't be faithful Lord Lord I pray father's we give you the preeminence Lord we give you the preeminence over every bad habit over every negative thought over every unbelief and every doubt that's within our hearts or all the sins that do so easily beset us we lay them aside giving preeminence to you the Lord Jesus Christ we love you we adore you father Lord and we believe Lord and the message that you gave us father and Lord we believe that brother Branham was a prophet Lord and we want to be faithful to the vision that he had Lord that there will be a seed bringing forth of its kind so there will be a bride and the last day it looks just like the bride and from the first day Lord be it unto us according to your word Lord or we believe it's possible when I say in and out we're not saying it I wish it was our wish so I hope so we know Lord and we believe because you told us we could believe so we believe in the name of Jesus Christ we pray let it be amen amen god bless you amen amen but if you come Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh be glorious our OB glorified today [Music] [Music] ha ha today again [Applause] no glory for me glory far [Music]
