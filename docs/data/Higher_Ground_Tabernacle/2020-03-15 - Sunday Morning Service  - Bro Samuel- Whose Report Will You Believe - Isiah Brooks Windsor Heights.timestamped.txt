[38:44] to be seated let us just spray before we
[38:52] read the Evan Lee father we approach the
[38:54] throne of grace and mercy this morning
[38:56] father thinking you father for bringing
[38:58] us in your house you said in your word
[39:00] wherever two or three are gathered in my
[39:02] name is you said you will be there so we
[39:04] don't have to wait for any any feeling
[39:07] or anything because we know Lord that
[39:09] our feelings may deceive us but we know
[39:12] that your word will never deceive us and
[39:14] when you speak a word it will never
[39:16] return to you back void but after it has
[39:19] accomplished that which you have sent it
[39:21] for now we are standing on that word
[39:23] knowing that you you are in our midst I
[39:25] just pray our Father God that when you
[39:28] make yourself known in our merest touch
[39:31] the hearts that need to be tired father
[39:32] give answers to those Lord that has to
[39:35] be answered I do not know Lord what the
[39:37] children want but you do know father God
[39:39] and you promise that that you will
[39:41] supply it according to all our needs or
[39:43] father God according to your riches and
[39:45] glory I just pray O God this morning
[39:47] that may you come down speak to your
[39:50] children in a mighty way speak to us Oh
[39:51] father it may your anointing be in our
[39:53] midst so that in the end of it all we
[39:56] might say for sure Lord you spoke unto
[39:57] us with no shadow of doubt now as we're
[40:00] reading your word father gotta pray that
[40:02] you give inspiration to it in Jesus
[40:04] Christ's name I pray believing saying
[40:06] thank you lord amen let us read the Book
[40:10] of Numbers chapter 13 verse 1 and 2 and
[40:16] the Lord spake unto Moses saying send
[40:20] our men that they may search the land of
[40:23] Canaan which I give unto thee I wish I
[40:26] give unto the children of Israel of
[40:28] every tribe of their fathers shall ye
[40:31] send a man everyone a ruler among them
[40:34] may take our seat
[40:40] we're going to read further down the
[40:43] chapter here we'll look at our the LORD
[40:47] commanded Moses he is saying send one
[40:51] representative from all the tribes of
[40:53] the children of Israel so he is sending
[40:57] 12 spies to go spy the land of Canaan we
[41:00] all know the story and they all went to
[41:04] see this promised land that God had
[41:07] already promised their father Abraham to
[41:09] see how it was like before they went to
[41:12] go and overcome it because they were
[41:14] told that for each and every ground that
[41:17] God promised them they had to fight they
[41:20] had to fight and go get it so before
[41:22] they went for it they were sending spies
[41:25] to go and see how the land is like so
[41:27] they probably know how to to fight what
[41:31] strategies to use so they sent 12 men
[41:34] that were representing the two million
[41:36] children of Israel let us go down to
[41:39] verse 30 let's started 31 actually but
[41:47] the men who went up with him and said we
[41:50] be not able to go up against the people
[41:52] for they are stronger than we and they
[41:55] brought up an evil report of the land
[41:58] which they had searched unto the
[41:59] children of Israel saying the land
[42:02] through which we have gone to search it
[42:04] is a land that eateth up the inhabitants
[42:06] thereof and all the people that we saw
[42:09] in it are men of a great stature and
[42:11] there we saw the Giants the sons of anak
[42:15] which come of the Giants and we were in
[42:18] our own sight as grasshoppers and so we
[42:21] were in their sight so this is the
[42:24] report the other 10 men are giving
[42:26] they're saying we cannot take it it's
[42:29] just too much we're gonna get these
[42:32] people will just part us to them would
[42:34] look like grasshoppers and they are
[42:36] giants so we cannot go and take it but
[42:39] let's take a reading at verse 30 verse
[42:42] 30 and kaleb's till the people before
[42:46] Moses and said let us go up at once and
[42:49] possess it for we are well able to Oh
[42:53] commit you see this man were looking at
[42:56] their physical stature they were looking
[42:58] at their physical abilities and in
[43:00] abilities
[43:01] that's what discouraged them but we look
[43:04] at Calif he is a different kind
[43:06] altogether he saw the man but he was not
[43:10] looking at that he was looking at the
[43:12] promise that God gave because he knew
[43:14] that God never fails in any of his
[43:16] promises and he knew that this was a
[43:19] land that God had promised Abraham their
[43:23] forefathers so he knew that God is able
[43:26] to do what he promises and now these 10
[43:30] men they say we cannot go to take this
[43:32] land because it's a land of giants so we
[43:36] cannot do it this is this is a mission
[43:38] impossible and look they're saying and
[43:42] there we saw Giants the sons of anak
[43:44] which come of the Giants and we were in
[43:47] our own sight as grasshoppers and
[43:49] they're saying we cannot do it because
[43:51] they are the sons of anak let us look at
[43:54] verse 22 to see how many would the sons
[43:57] of anak verse 22 says and they ascended
[44:00] by the south and came unto he born where
[44:03] a he-man she shy and Tom I the children
[44:06] of anak were how many how many names did
[44:09] we read here a he-man she shy and tommye
[44:14] the children of anak were just three
[44:21] just three children of anak but now
[44:25] they're saying they don't come in they
[44:27] don't come and say we saw three children
[44:30] of anak they say we saw giants children
[44:32] of anak we cannot we are not able to
[44:34] take it so they're giving a false report
[44:37] because the the the hosts of Israel was
[44:41] two million people and they were
[44:42] supposed to go and fight and get the
[44:44] land but he's saying well they sold
[44:47] three people they are saying because of
[44:49] these three we cannot go do it so they
[44:52] were giving a false report so this
[44:55] morning we just want to talk for a
[44:57] little bit on the subject who's the
[45:00] report will you believe so this is what
[45:03] we are seeing Caleb was not looking at
[45:07] the physical other physical limitations
[45:09] he was looking at the promise of God
[45:12] because God promised Abraham he said I'm
[45:15] giving you this land and your seed shall
[45:18] possess it so that's what they were
[45:21] looking at you see when God gives a
[45:23] promise no matter how things look like
[45:26] he is going to shift things around to
[45:29] make sure that promise comes to pass
[45:30] look at Abraham he was given the Abraham
[45:34] and Sarah and they were given a promise
[45:36] of a son but they were old in their 90's
[45:42] and hundreds they were not able to
[45:44] conceive and get a baby but because God
[45:47] had kept a promise it had to happen so
[45:50] he had to recondition their bodies to
[45:53] make them younger so that they could so
[45:55] that he could perform his promise to
[45:57] them so this is what God does no matter
[46:00] how things look like no matter what his
[46:02] situation looks like look into the word
[46:05] his promises will never fail his word is
[46:09] not going to change but it is you who's
[46:11] going to change so that the word can be
[46:13] made accomplished to you amen so we
[46:17] ought to have faith like Caleb another
[46:19] prophet of God tells us that Caleb is a
[46:21] he's the type of the Gentiles and we are
[46:24] the Gentiles the Gentile faith it is
[46:27] known to be the strongest faith in the
[46:28] Bible so that's what we ought to do we
[46:30] don't look at what things at what
[46:33] circumstances tell us we look at what
[46:36] the word says we look at the promises of
[46:38] what God say to us amen
[46:40] because you see the devil tries to make
[46:43] that he tries to put that fear in you
[46:46] because he knows the moment you realize
[46:49] what you can do its trouble to him so
[46:54] that's why he tries to give you this
[46:56] false report and try to make you fear
[46:58] because fear is the greatest weapon that
[47:01] the devil uses look what's happening out
[47:03] here in the media everybody is so scared
[47:06] I mean people have been having flu I
[47:10] mean who hasn't had flu in their whole
[47:12] life everyone did but look at what what
[47:17] what fear is doing to people
[47:21] that's the greatest fear that's the
[47:23] greatest tool that the devil uses
[47:24] because he knows if you are not afraid
[47:27] you are going he's going to be in
[47:29] trouble so the devil is already afraid
[47:31] of you because he already knew he
[47:33] already knows what you hold he already
[47:36] knows who you are
[47:37] for example let's take a look at just
[47:40] read chapter 2 you don't have to open it
[47:43] though just to chapter 2 all of you read
[47:45] verse 9 to 11 it says this is this was a
[47:49] Rahab she says she said unto the men I
[47:52] know that the Lord had given you the
[47:54] land and that your terror is falling
[47:57] upon us and that all the inhabitants of
[47:59] the land faint because of you we have
[48:02] heard how the Lord dried up the water of
[48:04] the sea of the Red Sea for you when you
[48:08] came out of Egypt and what he did unto
[48:10] the 2 kings of the amorite and we're on
[48:13] the other side of Jordan Sehun and AAG
[48:16] whom he utterly destroyed and as soon as
[48:19] we heard these things our hearts did
[48:22] melt needed neither did there remain any
[48:25] hope courage any more courage in any man
[48:28] because of you for the Lord your God He
[48:30] is God in heaven above and in the earth
[48:33] beneath so you see the enemy already
[48:36] knows they know your testimonies so they
[48:41] are scared the enemy is already scared
[48:43] of you but it's not what the devil tries
[48:45] to do he's trying to make you fear so
[48:48] that you do not overcome him because he
[48:52] knows he knows what you are holding so
[48:54] that's why he tries to to bring things
[48:57] around you and you you know you are
[48:59] scared and you don't get to do anything
[49:01] about it
[49:02] but now if you get to know that the
[49:04] devil is already afraid of you there
[49:07] won't be anything that can stop you and
[49:09] you will stop living under your own
[49:11] privileges because you know the power
[49:14] that you have you know the authority
[49:16] that God plays in your hand and you know
[49:18] what God can do for you so we gotta you
[49:22] gotta learn to refuse the devil's report
[49:25] and I believe the report of God because
[49:29] what everything that the devil says is a
[49:32] lie
[49:33] the devil is never tells you the truth
[49:36] if you say something is up to something
[49:38] you take if he say something take the
[49:41] opposite of that because the devil
[49:43] always lie his report is always false
[49:46] and we gotta take God's report a man we
[49:49] readin the Bible of a man code we know
[49:52] Hezekiah he was an arm he was sent a
[49:57] letter by the king of Assyria his name
[49:59] was a Sennacherib and he was sent a
[50:03] letter and it was threatening him and he
[50:06] was saying I'm coming to destroy you you
[50:08] and your land and in that letter he
[50:11] wrote a lot of things and he wrote all
[50:14] the names of the kings that he had
[50:16] overcame he wrote a list of all the
[50:19] kingdoms he had utterly destroyed and he
[50:22] sent it to Hezekiah and he said he sent
[50:24] it with a message and he said I'm coming
[50:26] for you
[50:27] Hezekiah opened it and he saw it it was
[50:30] true and he knew that this man is coming
[50:33] for him but he looked at it and he
[50:36] decided that I'm taking this report as a
[50:39] false one and he took it into the house
[50:42] of the Lord and he went to God and he
[50:44] said Lord read what Sennacherib has said
[50:48] but I'm not believing it I'm believing
[50:50] in your word because he knew the promise
[50:53] that Ezra had been given that they shall
[50:56] be no enemy that will stand before you
[50:58] so he knelt he went to the house of God
[51:00] and he gave the letter to God and he
[51:03] said lord please read this and then
[51:06] after he prayed God sent a prophet to -
[51:09] here's a kind he said I have heard your
[51:11] prayer
[51:12] hallelujah that's what we ought to do
[51:15] bring whatever problem you have into the
[51:17] house of the Lord if you lost your job
[51:20] Yury take that as a false report and you
[51:23] say to God I know this is what they are
[51:25] saying but no I don't believe it I am
[51:28] believing what you say Amen because the
[51:30] Lord says I know that thoughts that I
[51:32] have for you thoughts for you to prosper
[51:34] those that are good for you amen this is
[51:37] what God has for us so even if you are
[51:40] sick the depth the the doctor give you
[51:43] the doctor gives you a letter it has all
[51:46] this disease
[51:47] in it you say okay that's what their
[51:49] machines are saying but this is not what
[51:51] God says you bring it into the house of
[51:53] the Lord you look at the report at God's
[51:56] report God's report says that you are
[51:59] healed you were healed
[52:01] 2000 years ago and but now the doctors
[52:04] report is saying he was sick so you have
[52:07] to decide which report you believe just
[52:09] believe on God's report and he will
[52:12] never fail we have seen him in all
[52:14] history that he has always come through
[52:16] hallelujah so you have to come to a
[52:19] point in time where you have to choose
[52:21] which which report to believe God will
[52:25] never fail you amen
[52:27] because we know the promise that was
[52:30] given to Abraham like we were saying the
[52:31] other day that Abraham's the promise was
[52:35] not to Abraham only but it was given to
[52:37] the seed of Abraham naturally and
[52:40] spiritually so the promise that was
[52:44] given to Abraham he says thy seed shall
[52:47] possess the gates of the enemy so that's
[52:51] that promise already is going to whether
[52:54] you are capable or not that promise is
[52:56] going to condition you for you to be
[52:59] able to possess the gates of the enemy
[53:01] we look at our Shanga there is not even
[53:05] a lot that is reading about Shamgar in
[53:07] the Bible his name is just mentioned
[53:09] twice he was not even a warrior but one
[53:13] time he was there he was a farmer he was
[53:16] not even he was not even a trained
[53:18] soldier he was there he was a farmer and
[53:20] then one day older
[53:22] the Philistines had been had been taking
[53:25] the the children of Israel for granted
[53:27] every time they would plant their
[53:30] harvest and everything after they after
[53:32] they harvest it then they'll just come
[53:34] and take everything and go back with it
[53:36] and feed their families so the children
[53:39] of Israel were just working and things
[53:41] were just being stolen from them their
[53:43] produce
[53:44] but one day Shambo was looking at his
[53:47] family his daughter was so skinny
[53:50] she wasn't having enough food and the
[53:52] wife is right there they have no food
[53:55] they just have whatever they had just
[53:57] they had just garden then he is standing
[54:00] right there he's
[54:01] since the Philistines coming to the
[54:03] prophecy he was dramatised and he says
[54:05] he was telling by the window he souls he
[54:08] sees a six hundred Philistines coming
[54:11] towards him
[54:12] then he looks at them then he looks at
[54:15] his family then he says no not today
[54:18] that's a false report I'm looking at
[54:21] what God said and he remembered what God
[54:25] said to Abraham he says your seed shall
[54:28] possess the gate of the enemy so he
[54:30] looked at his blood and his blood told
[54:33] him that he was he was Abraham's seed so
[54:36] he said whether I'm a soldier or not
[54:38] whether I have the training or not I am
[54:40] going anyhow that blood is going to keep
[54:44] me because God is bound to keep his word
[54:47] because if anything was going if
[54:49] anything was going to happen to Shamgar
[54:51] he was going to go back to God and say
[54:53] you didn't keep your word so he was just
[54:56] throwing himself they had the enemy he
[54:59] knew that victory was certain he knew
[55:01] that God is able to keep his word
[55:04] so he took whatever that was closest
[55:07] there was an ox God you know he's just a
[55:09] small stick that has a small meadow at
[55:12] the end and he took it and he jumped out
[55:15] of the window and he went and he smote
[55:17] 600 trained trained soldiers who had who
[55:22] had been in the Army for so many years
[55:24] but this was just a farmer because he
[55:26] realized that God keeps his word and he
[55:30] took what the devil was bringing to him
[55:32] as a false report and he says I'm only
[55:35] believing what God says and God says I
[55:38] shall possess all the gates of the enemy
[55:41] so that's what you gotta do
[55:43] you're gonna come to a point in time
[55:45] where you gonna have where you're gonna
[55:47] have to stand those circumstances you're
[55:50] gonna have to stand and you take it back
[55:53] to the enemy because sham goers not just
[55:57] being defensive he had to go on the
[55:58] offensive that's that's what that's how
[56:00] that's how worry is like so you gotta
[56:03] choose anything that comes your way you
[56:06] gotta choose with how you want to PLASA
[56:08] fie it as a false report or as a true
[56:11] report a man is all right
[56:14] because we have the power when God gave
[56:17] us the Holy Ghost in the book of Acts he
[56:19] essayed after the Holy Ghost has come
[56:21] upon you
[56:22] you shall receive power what's that
[56:24] power to do it is to withstand all the
[56:26] forces of Satan you see many people
[56:29] think that when you receive the Holy
[56:31] Ghost life is now easy no sir
[56:35] when you receive the Holy Ghost that's
[56:37] you have just declared war a man when
[56:41] you receive the Holy Ghost you have
[56:42] drawn enemy lines with the devil because
[56:45] before you received it you are on the
[56:47] same side with him he really didn't have
[56:50] a reason to fight you but now when you
[56:52] have decided to say I'm following Christ
[56:55] I am now saved this is what I want to do
[56:58] you have drawn a line to say Satan we
[57:01] are no longer on the same side so you
[57:04] have declared war so when you decide to
[57:08] serve Christ you know that it is now a
[57:11] time of war with the devil so if the
[57:14] warfare is not a picnic that's what it
[57:17] is
[57:17] we gotta you gotta stand and fight you
[57:21] see and how do we fight you know the
[57:23] devil he always tries to stop us from
[57:25] praying because the prophet of God tells
[57:28] us that prayer is the most powerful
[57:31] weapon that God placed in the hands of
[57:34] man he said it's greater than an atomic
[57:37] bomb when you know the power of an
[57:39] atomic bomb and he says prayer is
[57:41] greater than that gentleman's shift
[57:44] things change
[57:45] Hezekiah changed the mind of God with
[57:48] prayer prayer is the most powerful thing
[57:51] so Satan knows that prayer is powerful
[57:55] so that's why he's gonna stop you from
[57:57] praying the prophet of God says when the
[58:02] weakest Christian kneels down to pray
[58:04] they're able to shake hail all the
[58:07] demons they are gonna shake if the
[58:09] weakest Christian kneels down to pray so
[58:11] you don't have to worry about much if
[58:13] you just know you are desiring to serve
[58:16] the Lord and you know in your heart you
[58:18] are a Christian don't let the devil tell
[58:21] you you are not a pastor you're not a
[58:23] deacon or you don't have so much
[58:25] experience in the word just by be
[58:28] a Christian you have the ability to
[58:30] shake the foundations of hell because
[58:33] that's the Word of God so that's why
[58:35] Satan tries to stop you from praying
[58:37] listening to the word reading the word
[58:40] because he knows that's where your power
[58:43] that's where your power comes from and
[58:46] he knows that's where his destruction
[58:48] comes from you see many times you try to
[58:52] wake up in the middle of the night you
[58:55] try to wake up and pray then you set an
[58:58] alarm you wake up your snoozy do you say
[59:03] you have five minutes it's probably
[59:06] three in the money you snows you say
[59:07] I'll wake up in five minutes time I have
[59:09] the whole night is yes too early you
[59:11] snooze that alarm until you wake up in
[59:13] the morning and you never did pray it
[59:17] happens a lot too many of us right it's
[59:20] why it's the devil he's trying to stop
[59:22] you from praying because you know the
[59:24] moment you start praying he is in
[59:26] trouble many times when you start
[59:30] praying that's when you get destructions
[59:32] your phone goes off or suddenly you have
[59:36] something very important to do it's
[59:38] because he's trying to stop you from
[59:40] praying because he knows when you start
[59:43] praying it's too late for him so we
[59:47] gotta be we gotta get up our loins and
[59:49] always stand fast and we gotta be
[59:52] offensive no defense if you do not win a
[59:55] war by being defensive you gotta be
[59:58] offensive
[59:59] look at the what happened at Pearl
[1:00:03] Harbor
[1:00:03] you see that's what the devil does he
[1:00:05] tries to sneak up on you when you are
[1:00:07] least expecting it the Japanese they
[1:00:11] launched there they launched their their
[1:00:14] airplanes their of their fighter jets
[1:00:16] and everything and the US wasn't even
[1:00:19] expecting it they thought maybe they
[1:00:21] were going to attack their resources
[1:00:22] maybe in the Philippines or Southeast
[1:00:24] Asia that's what they were thinking they
[1:00:26] were like they are not coming here so
[1:00:29] they were not even prepared for it and
[1:00:30] then just one morning bombs are dropped
[1:00:35] and they're and they're in trouble
[1:00:37] that's exactly what the devil does
[1:00:39] because they were waiting you are
[1:00:41] defense waiting for the enemy to come to
[1:00:44] you you do not do that you go into the
[1:00:46] enemy's camp you have to take the fight
[1:00:50] to the enemy
[1:00:51] they had to realize that for us to win
[1:00:54] this war we have to go fight that's why
[1:00:57] you see the Hiroshima and Nagasaki thing
[1:00:59] they had to you had to be offensive
[1:01:02] that's how you win a war so the devil
[1:01:05] tries to attack you once you are
[1:01:08] relaxing because you don't see it coming
[1:01:10] that's why we gotta stand fast keep on
[1:01:13] praying and be on our knees because he
[1:01:16] is so sneaky and he is just he's a bluff
[1:01:21] he is not he is not for real the Bible
[1:01:25] says he's he's like a roaring lion
[1:01:26] seeking whom he made before he is like a
[1:01:30] roaring lion not air but he is like a
[1:01:33] roaring lion so he is just a bluff he is
[1:01:36] not a lion he's not dangerous at all if
[1:01:38] you gotta realize that then you will
[1:01:41] stop living under your own privileges
[1:01:43] and the devil he is so persistent he
[1:01:46] don't stop until he gets you he does not
[1:01:50] stop at all and you also you are not
[1:01:53] supposed to stop resisting
[1:01:54] imagine for how long for six thousand
[1:01:57] years the devil has been trying to
[1:01:59] disrupt God's plan he knows he's not
[1:02:01] ever gonna overcome but somehow he just
[1:02:04] can't stop if if a Christian could have
[1:02:07] if a Christian could have as much
[1:02:09] persistence as the devil has we wouldn't
[1:02:13] we wouldn't have many problems
[1:02:15] we'll always be victorious if you fall
[1:02:17] down get back up if you fall down get
[1:02:20] back up you know you are going to stand
[1:02:22] it because you have a promise so the
[1:02:25] devil is so persistent but you also
[1:02:27] resist because the scripture says resist
[1:02:31] the devil and he will flee away from you
[1:02:33] so the more he is persistent you resist
[1:02:36] he is persistent you resist because the
[1:02:40] God keeps his word resist the devil and
[1:02:43] eventually he's going to flee away and
[1:02:46] but he's gonna come back again with
[1:02:48] another method so we gotta make sure we
[1:02:53] know that we have the power
[1:02:55] resist the forces of the devil because
[1:02:57] we have a promise that was given to us
[1:03:01] to our feather a brother Abraham that we
[1:03:04] have to possess all the gates of the
[1:03:06] enemy hallelujah and nothing can go
[1:03:09] against us I read what the prophet of
[1:03:14] God says who says refused to sign
[1:03:17] anything the devil brings he will have
[1:03:19] to take it back say I refuse to have it
[1:03:22] I just won't have it no sir
[1:03:26] he will have to take it back in the name
[1:03:29] of the Lord if you believe it and
[1:03:31] confess it and say I've accept Jesus
[1:03:34] Christ as my healer
[1:03:35] there is no affliction or disease can
[1:03:37] stay on you stay right with it
[1:03:39] so that's what you got to do you got to
[1:03:43] come to a point where you refuse it and
[1:03:45] you say no I don't accept it I am only
[1:03:48] accepting what Jesus Christ says when
[1:03:51] the devil brings to you sickness you
[1:03:55] look at the sickness and you say no I do
[1:03:58] not receive it Christ died for me not
[1:04:01] that I'm going to be healed but I was
[1:04:03] already healed 2,000 years ago
[1:04:06] you see because it was already done once
[1:04:10] you just have to do is receive it take
[1:04:12] it and apply to yourself because it was
[1:04:15] already done you because he was bruised
[1:04:18] for our iniquities all your sins that
[1:04:21] you did and you are going to do they
[1:04:24] were already forgiven for you just have
[1:04:27] to accept Christ as forgiveness and take
[1:04:29] it and apply it to you for it to be for
[1:04:32] you to be a effective I'll read another
[1:04:36] quote as well
[1:04:37] it's a symptoms they're lying vanities
[1:04:40] don't receive them don't have nothing to
[1:04:43] do with them if you look to them you're
[1:04:46] looking away from God we look at the
[1:04:49] unseen not at what we see no one could
[1:04:52] look at what they see and be a Christian
[1:04:55] you have got to believe that things
[1:04:57] that's unseen for is by faith you are
[1:05:00] healed not by sight or by feeling what
[1:05:04] if someone came up in the morning to you
[1:05:06] to your door Express agent and throw you
[1:05:09] a whole basket full of rattlesnakes and
[1:05:11] had your name on them said here they are
[1:05:14] they're yours you know they you know
[1:05:17] they are they're just like you know your
[1:05:20] symptoms are there if you receive them
[1:05:22] they're yours but you don't have to take
[1:05:25] them you can say I don't want them if
[1:05:28] they's a package does deliver at your
[1:05:31] door it has your name on it and your
[1:05:33] address is it and you know that's your
[1:05:35] name and that's your address that
[1:05:37] package is not yours until you sign for
[1:05:40] it you can deny it and you say take it
[1:05:42] back I don't want it yeah and then you
[1:05:46] take it back it's no longer yours
[1:05:48] although it has your name on it so it's
[1:05:51] just your duty you see you refuse it
[1:05:53] it's just that simple
[1:05:55] amen when you see something coming your
[1:05:58] way it is directed to you you say no I
[1:06:02] refuse it the doctor's report says I
[1:06:05] have cancer yes it has my name on it yes
[1:06:08] your machines say that but it is not
[1:06:11] mine until I accept it and you know what
[1:06:15] I am NOT deciding to accept it right now
[1:06:17] so you take it back because it is not
[1:06:20] mine
[1:06:20] that's how simple you gotta take it it
[1:06:24] is that simple and they say your names
[1:06:28] on them you say I don't want them I
[1:06:31] won't have them he can stand there and
[1:06:34] argue as much as he wants to you but
[1:06:36] until you take them and sign for them
[1:06:39] they belong to the Express company until
[1:06:42] you sign for them
[1:06:43] don't sign for nothing the devil brings
[1:06:46] everything the devil brings to you is a
[1:06:48] lie and it's meant for your detriment
[1:06:51] the devil is not your friend he is an
[1:06:54] enemy no matter house and the devil is a
[1:06:57] smooth talker too no matter how smooth
[1:07:00] he tries to talk you into it and tries
[1:07:02] to reason do not accept it
[1:07:04] it's the devil it's not good for you you
[1:07:07] see many times the devil is so slick he
[1:07:10] makes you think that it's yourself
[1:07:12] telling you that he comes through
[1:07:15] reasoning uses your five senses and
[1:07:18] reasoning you look at it and you say but
[1:07:20] you know what well I think
[1:07:23] just accepted this that's what it is you
[1:07:26] know us Matic you got diabetes like yeah
[1:07:30] this I just gotta accept it you know but
[1:07:34] no don't it's not yourself who's telling
[1:07:37] you that anything that's negative is is
[1:07:39] the devil he brings to you he talks to
[1:07:43] you through your reasoning through your
[1:07:45] imagination and you think you are having
[1:07:48] a conversation with yourself but if you
[1:07:50] no you are not you are having a
[1:07:52] conversation with the devil so he's
[1:07:54] gonna make you think that you are the
[1:07:55] one who came up with that but it's not
[1:07:57] it was him so you gotta realize oh you
[1:08:01] gotta realize all the tactics the
[1:08:03] prophet of God says overcoming is really
[1:08:05] recognizing the devil or his techniques
[1:08:07] so the moment you realize that that's
[1:08:10] your first step in overcoming you just
[1:08:12] have to say no it's the devil I see you
[1:08:14] not happening hallelujah that's what you
[1:08:17] gotta do he says date is though date is
[1:08:21] yes though I refuse to have it take it
[1:08:24] back have nothing to do with it
[1:08:26] if you won't testify that you've got it
[1:08:29] then when you testify you still have
[1:08:32] your sickness the devil keeps it with
[1:08:34] you but you refuse to testify you're fit
[1:08:37] say I won't have it no sir that's when
[1:08:42] you're getting faith your faith give
[1:08:45] give your faith a chance turn it loose
[1:08:48] and brittle let let it work you've got
[1:08:51] it all bound down with traditions turn
[1:08:54] it loose cut your faith loose let God
[1:08:57] have his way with that somebody's word
[1:09:00] is right either what you're looking at
[1:09:03] or what God says that's the two reports
[1:09:06] whose report are you gonna believe what
[1:09:09] you are seeing and in most cases the
[1:09:11] devil can fool the other five senses so
[1:09:14] most likely what you are seeing with
[1:09:18] your five senses the devil is showing it
[1:09:19] to you if it's not good for you is the
[1:09:21] devil so you gotta get you gotta put it
[1:09:24] away and take what God says for you amen
[1:09:27] either what you're looking at or what
[1:09:29] God says God's Word is true and always
[1:09:32] believe it
[1:09:34] alright but the first time you testify
[1:09:36] if you
[1:09:37] sickness it brings you right down to the
[1:09:39] realm again you sign for it refused to
[1:09:42] sign for it
[1:09:43] testify of what you believe so you see
[1:09:48] that's that's what the devil does he
[1:09:49] comes to you with the reasoning and the
[1:09:53] devil he he attacks believers in a
[1:09:57] different way you see you know many
[1:10:01] people we think we our our trials and
[1:10:05] temptations they are different from the
[1:10:07] rest of the worlds because we are
[1:10:09] believers the devil tempts you by the
[1:10:12] word and we are not altogether spiritual
[1:10:16] beings we have that natural aspect in
[1:10:19] that spiritual aspect and take for
[1:10:21] example of sickness heats your home or
[1:10:25] maybe you lose a job that's affecting
[1:10:29] your natural part but how is the devil
[1:10:31] gonna afflict you in that how is he
[1:10:34] trying you he's going to come to you
[1:10:37] when you are in that situation and he
[1:10:40] makes you look at the word you were sick
[1:10:44] probably can't pay the bills he lost his
[1:10:48] job and the devil is going to show you a
[1:10:50] scripture where he says many other
[1:10:53] afflictions of the righteous but God
[1:10:55] delivers out of them delivers them out
[1:10:57] of them all and he says what are you and
[1:11:01] he's tempting you using the word the
[1:11:05] devil uses a scripture that's out of
[1:11:08] season to tempt you that's how he get us
[1:11:10] using our five senses
[1:11:12] using reasoning you see the devil is the
[1:11:16] greatest theologian than all of us
[1:11:19] he's a had 6,000 years to study the
[1:11:22] Bible he knows it back to back through
[1:11:25] and through so you can never out quote
[1:11:27] the devil looking at the Bible he knows
[1:11:30] all of it
[1:11:32] he looked at Jesus he came to tempt
[1:11:34] Jesus when he came he said he he he told
[1:11:38] him you got the power turned the stones
[1:11:41] into bread and eat that's the temptation
[1:11:43] he was using and does the word say that
[1:11:45] yes Jesus had the power to do it but it
[1:11:48] was a scripture out of season and he
[1:11:51] all them he put him up he put him on a
[1:11:53] on a pinochle and he says cast yourself
[1:11:55] down
[1:11:56] they a God will send His angels before
[1:11:58] your foot - is the ground God will do
[1:12:01] that but that was a scripture out of
[1:12:04] season that's how the devil tempt us
[1:12:07] because that's that's our temptations
[1:12:10] that's how our temptations are different
[1:12:11] from anybody else and that's the most
[1:12:14] discouraging thing when you look at the
[1:12:16] word and it seems like it is not
[1:12:18] happening and it looks like God is not
[1:12:20] fulfilling his word so if you try to
[1:12:25] rely on your knowledge then yeah you are
[1:12:29] not going to outwit the devil by that
[1:12:30] you see the Bible tells us that do not
[1:12:33] reuse what you're going to say in the
[1:12:34] court of laws but the Holy Ghost is
[1:12:37] going to give you a Turin's that's why
[1:12:39] you got a that's why you you got a
[1:12:42] depend on the Holy Ghost many times you
[1:12:44] are seated right right that you don't
[1:12:46] know nothing but the Holy Ghost just
[1:12:47] drops the right scripture what you need
[1:12:50] right there and you know this is God so
[1:12:53] that's what you gotta depend on you
[1:12:55] gotta depend on God you see the devil
[1:12:58] uses a scripture out-of-season to tempt
[1:13:02] you that's the temptation of the word
[1:13:04] that's the temptation to the believer I
[1:13:06] can imagine
[1:13:08] Lazarus the beggar he was begging for
[1:13:11] bread
[1:13:11] I can imagine he looked at the scripture
[1:13:14] that says what David says I'm a young
[1:13:16] but now I'm old I've never seen the
[1:13:18] righteous begging for bread imagine what
[1:13:22] was going on through his mind he is
[1:13:24] begging and he's seeing that Scripture
[1:13:27] if it was any of us I mean then God is
[1:13:32] not keeping his word but we gotta be
[1:13:35] stronger and hold on fast and be like
[1:13:39] job and say even though he slay me I
[1:13:42] will still serve him hallelujah is that
[1:13:44] attitude you have towards God just like
[1:13:48] that Sarah Phoenician woman when God
[1:13:50] told her that I cannot give way I cannot
[1:13:54] give the bread of the children to the
[1:13:56] dogs
[1:13:56] you see she wasn't going to a priest she
[1:13:59] was going to Jesus the word itself she
[1:14:03] walked she went to the word
[1:14:04] flesh and she had a petition and the
[1:14:07] word said you are a dog but it was her
[1:14:10] attitude she said if this the word the
[1:14:13] word never lies and if the word is
[1:14:16] calling me a dog that's right I believe
[1:14:18] it and she said that's nothing but the
[1:14:20] truth and she accepted it it's her
[1:14:23] attitude and she ended up getting what
[1:14:26] she wanted because of her attitude
[1:14:27] towards the word she didn't let the
[1:14:30] devil take that because if it was any of
[1:14:32] us you call me a word a dog you see this
[1:14:36] is not even a priest but this is Jesus
[1:14:39] the word itself yeah I mean if it was
[1:14:43] any of us like right I'm out of here you
[1:14:46] see but it was here attitude towards the
[1:14:49] word and just holding on fast the
[1:14:52] prophet of God says I love God so much
[1:14:55] that even if he sends me to hell I would
[1:14:57] still love I'll still keep on loving him
[1:14:59] that's the attitude we gotta have and we
[1:15:02] will overcome the devil at all of his
[1:15:05] tricks and we know that that's what the
[1:15:08] devil is good at so we gotta keep on
[1:15:10] holding on and know that we gotta
[1:15:14] believe God's report and not the devil's
[1:15:17] report I'm gonna read our brother
[1:15:22] branham's own testimony he said he had a
[1:15:24] he had a stomach problem he says when I
[1:15:27] started to eat and swallow the first
[1:15:28] mouthful the doctor said one mouthful if
[1:15:31] he eats would be in digestion boy you'll
[1:15:34] die right now and I eat the beans and
[1:15:37] cornbread and onions yes sir
[1:15:40] I took in the house the blessing over it
[1:15:42] and got it in my mouth and chewed it up
[1:15:44] and swallowed it devil said you'll die
[1:15:47] and here it come right back up I held my
[1:15:51] hand over on my mouth swallowed it back
[1:15:54] again I said no sir ha ha
[1:15:56] I refuse no sir somebody's right either
[1:15:59] while my system says or what God says
[1:16:02] but I decide to look at what God is
[1:16:04] saying I went out on the street and the
[1:16:08] hard water running out of my mouth down
[1:16:10] my mouth as soon as soon as I was
[1:16:12] singing I can I will I do believe that
[1:16:14] jesus heals me now someone said how you
[1:16:17] feeling I
[1:16:18] wonderful you healed sure you how you
[1:16:22] feeling fine anything wrong nothing
[1:16:26] how you feeling fine are you healed sure
[1:16:29] you see he was looking at God's Word
[1:16:32] that I am already healed not at what his
[1:16:35] system was telling him is that right not
[1:16:38] what his five senses were telling him
[1:16:40] those symptoms because he knew that
[1:16:41] that's the realm that the devil operates
[1:16:44] with and that's why you gotta have the
[1:16:47] sixth sense faith the devil cannot get
[1:16:50] to that he can only affect this five and
[1:16:53] faith is the superior sense so when you
[1:16:56] have that sixth sense when the devil
[1:16:58] comes to try and talk to you to this
[1:17:00] five so the 6/10 was just told the other
[1:17:02] one shut up I'm the boss here and we are
[1:17:05] looking at what God says I stayed right
[1:17:08] with it day after day and week after
[1:17:09] week and I was healed one morning I
[1:17:13] believed in my to come at his word
[1:17:15] nobody ever cast it away from me but the
[1:17:17] word said so and the word of God will
[1:17:20] defeat Satan any place anytime anywhere
[1:17:25] and on any condition so you keep on
[1:17:29] believing it's going to turn out right
[1:17:31] anyway just keep on holding it you
[1:17:35] remember that that blind person who was
[1:17:37] prayed for he kept on saying I can see
[1:17:40] although his eyes were closed he kept on
[1:17:43] professing it he was not he was not
[1:17:45] believing what his sense of side was
[1:17:48] telling him his sense of side was
[1:17:49] telling you me you cannot see we cannot
[1:17:52] see nothing our eyes are blind but he
[1:17:54] says no I'm looking at the sixth sense
[1:17:56] the sixth sense tells me that I can see
[1:17:59] and he was believing on that he kept on
[1:18:02] believing it until God made him God
[1:18:06] answered his prayer and honored his
[1:18:08] faith and he's eyes open hidden he was
[1:18:11] saying so that's we got to do you got to
[1:18:13] be persistent Widow and just believe the
[1:18:16] word of God you believe God's report and
[1:18:19] he will never fail you just remember
[1:18:22] that anything the devil says to you it
[1:18:24] ain't true
[1:18:25] you gotta reject it amen I'm going to
[1:18:29] read you all know the story of David
[1:18:32] David and Goliath when David came he was
[1:18:35] coming from you he was coming from from
[1:18:38] the heading the Sheep and he was sent by
[1:18:40] his father to go
[1:18:42] I'll give his all the brothers food and
[1:18:45] then that's when he says Goliath he's
[1:18:47] trying to defy God the Living God amen
[1:18:51] and then he had to go fight I'm just
[1:18:53] gonna read through the story read our
[1:18:57] first Samuel 17 44 year and have to open
[1:19:00] it I'll read too fast and the
[1:19:01] Philistines say to David come to me and
[1:19:04] I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of
[1:19:07] the air and to the beasts of the field
[1:19:10] the scent first time in 1744 I'm going
[1:19:13] to 45 then say David to the Philistine
[1:19:16] thou comest to me with this word and
[1:19:19] with a spear and with a shield but I
[1:19:22] come to thee in the name of the Lord of
[1:19:24] hosts the god of the armies of Israel
[1:19:27] whom thou has defied this day will the
[1:19:31] Lord deliver thee into my hand and I
[1:19:33] will smite thee and take thy herd head
[1:19:36] from thee and I will give the carcass of
[1:19:39] the host of the Philistines this day
[1:19:41] unto the fowls of the air and to the
[1:19:43] wild beasts of the earth that all the
[1:19:46] Earth might know that there is a God in
[1:19:48] Israel I'll go to 51 and he says
[1:19:52] therefore David ran therefore David ran
[1:19:57] and stood up point the Philistine and
[1:19:59] took his sward and drew it out of the
[1:20:01] sheet thereof and slew him and cut off
[1:20:04] his head therewith so here if we look if
[1:20:11] if we look here the Philistine if we
[1:20:14] look at verse 44 Goliath says to David
[1:20:17] come to me and I will give that flesh to
[1:20:21] the fowls of the air and to the beasts
[1:20:23] of the field but David refused it and in
[1:20:28] verse 46 he is taking back what Goliath
[1:20:31] I say to him he is taking it back to
[1:20:32] Goliath and he says no you are not going
[1:20:35] to cut my head but I am going to cut
[1:20:37] yours and I out if I will feed it to the
[1:20:40] beasts of the field so he was refusing
[1:20:43] Goliath he was refusing go Lions report
[1:20:46] and he says no I'm taking it back unto
[1:20:49] you and David was not waiting
[1:20:51] defensively waiting for Goliath to come
[1:20:54] to him and he can block him no he ran to
[1:20:57] Goliath because you know that's how you
[1:21:00] win war you you go offensive you be on
[1:21:03] the offensive not on the defensive and
[1:21:05] you take back what the enemy is saying
[1:21:07] to you those threats you take them back
[1:21:10] and that's how God will deliver you so
[1:21:13] here's a giant he is trying to here's a
[1:21:17] giant he's trying to - to defeat David
[1:21:19] but David is looking up unto unto God's
[1:21:22] Word he's remembering the testimonies
[1:21:25] that God had with him through him and he
[1:21:28] knows God cannot fail so he was
[1:21:30] confident you see this other soldiers
[1:21:33] soul and he's all the brothers they were
[1:21:35] scared they never had any experiences
[1:21:37] but because David had these experiences
[1:21:39] he knew God was gonna come through for
[1:21:41] him so that's why he he had the ability
[1:21:44] he had the guts to take back what the
[1:21:47] devil had say to him and send back the
[1:21:49] threats to the - Goliath and then he his
[1:21:53] lot he slew Goliath and cut off his herd
[1:21:57] and when the Philistines saw their
[1:21:58] champion was dead they all fled so he
[1:22:02] had victory he won who he wrought
[1:22:05] victories for the whole nation
[1:22:06] by defeating one man begins because he
[1:22:10] refused what Goliath has said and took
[1:22:13] it back to Goliath and then all the
[1:22:16] smaller Devils ran away from him after
[1:22:18] they saw that their captain had fallen I
[1:22:21] read another quote where brother branham
[1:22:24] he also had he also had a similar
[1:22:26] experience when he was in a prayer line
[1:22:29] and this manniac of Oregon wanted to
[1:22:31] come to him and he wanted to teach it to
[1:22:34] destroy him but he says no when the
[1:22:38] Spirit of God came upon him he says no I
[1:22:40] am not the one who's going to fall but
[1:22:42] you were going to fall at my feet and
[1:22:44] you said the man you say you snake in
[1:22:47] the grass I'm going to show you how much
[1:22:50] servant of God you are I'm going to
[1:22:52] knock you way out in the middle of that
[1:22:54] audience he said I'm going to knock you
[1:22:56] out
[1:22:58] the middle of the audience the speed of
[1:23:00] God's aid you fall over my feet this was
[1:23:03] not william branham speaking but it was
[1:23:05] God when God takes over you can rest
[1:23:08] rest assured because God never fails and
[1:23:12] he said I'll show you whose feet I'll
[1:23:14] fall over he drew back his arm to strike
[1:23:17] me and still there was no fear and I was
[1:23:21] in there because I wanted to be seen I
[1:23:23] was there with the commission from God
[1:23:25] to the people and when he started to
[1:23:28] strike something happened he said Satan
[1:23:30] leave this man and when it did his great
[1:23:33] eyes seemed to push out his teeth said
[1:23:36] together and he turned around and fell
[1:23:38] over fell over my feet till the
[1:23:41] policeman had to come and roll him off
[1:23:43] you see because I believe this was this
[1:23:47] was this was like a similar experience
[1:23:49] that happened to David because this man
[1:23:51] was this man was like a giant in these
[1:23:53] tranches he's trying to say you are
[1:23:55] going to fall over my feet and God now
[1:23:58] after God had taken over and God had
[1:24:00] taken control he says no you are going
[1:24:02] to follow my feet and a similar thing
[1:24:05] happened he says when he was speaking
[1:24:08] you could be he could have heard a pin
[1:24:10] drop the old saying is he says when all
[1:24:14] the Legion saw that their chief man had
[1:24:17] been slain every sick person rose to
[1:24:19] their feet
[1:24:20] every cot was empty every wheel chair
[1:24:24] emptied and the whole group was healed
[1:24:26] at one time and walked out so there
[1:24:30] never was a prayer line in this in this
[1:24:32] sermon it's because a similar thing
[1:24:35] happened when David slew Goliath all the
[1:24:37] Philistines ran away in this case I
[1:24:39] believe God is a God of presidents what
[1:24:42] he did before he can do it again so all
[1:24:46] the all the sick people all the quotes
[1:24:49] or the paralyzed people they just got
[1:24:51] healed instantly after this man fallen
[1:24:53] because the chiefest of them all was
[1:24:55] slayed so that's what you gotta do look
[1:24:58] for the chiefest demon in your life you
[1:25:00] slay it the rest of them will run away
[1:25:02] he's a god of presidents isn't he we
[1:25:05] said he did it in the Old Testament he
[1:25:08] did it in this age for our example so if
[1:25:11] you
[1:25:12] believe what God says take the enemy to
[1:25:14] the fight get on the offensive God is
[1:25:18] always God will always come true on his
[1:25:20] word and he will never fail you amen
[1:25:23] just go for that the bigger demon go for
[1:25:26] it don't be scared go for it attack him
[1:25:30] cut off his head fitted to the Beast and
[1:25:33] all the little devils will run away
[1:25:35] hallelujah that's why I believe God
[1:25:40] always if you look at what God did
[1:25:42] before he can do it again look at Auntie
[1:25:44] Jemima she looked into the Bible and she
[1:25:47] saw herself in there and she said Lord
[1:25:49] you did it for this woman I'm in the
[1:25:51] exact same position why not me and she
[1:25:55] was saying right there and God said well
[1:25:57] you have seen yourself I did it before I
[1:25:59] can do it again so just if you just have
[1:26:03] faith that $0.06 like that black David
[1:26:06] had you go take the fight to the enemy
[1:26:09] God will show up to brought you victory
[1:26:11] amen
[1:26:12] I want to say um I'm gonna give a little
[1:26:16] story I don't know I don't know if you
[1:26:18] ever heard it before it's about the owl
[1:26:21] the owl when it was um a couple of years
[1:26:25] back then so they say he was he used to
[1:26:28] lie to the birds of to all the birds and
[1:26:31] say I'm the king of the birds because I
[1:26:33] have horns you know you know the
[1:26:35] furthest that stand up like that and he
[1:26:37] said I'm the I'm the only bird that has
[1:26:40] got horns so I'm the king of the birds
[1:26:42] so he used to stand right there and send
[1:26:45] all the birds doing all his dirty work
[1:26:46] and everything find food for the owl and
[1:26:49] everything and he was standing right
[1:26:50] there and this keep kept on going for a
[1:26:53] very long time and then one little Robin
[1:26:58] one day it was just so the AH would
[1:27:01] sleep all day
[1:27:03] well they say that's the reason why he
[1:27:05] sleeps all day he would he was just
[1:27:08] sleeping all day
[1:27:08] lazy not doing any work just sending the
[1:27:11] other birds to do the job for him then a
[1:27:14] little Robin was perched by a branch
[1:27:16] close by one day he was closely paying
[1:27:20] attention to the horns and then a soft
[1:27:24] breeze come through
[1:27:25] seize the horns shaking like what and he
[1:27:30] the Robin gets a little bit closer
[1:27:32] it looks clearly that won't look like
[1:27:35] horns gets a little closer you see the
[1:27:39] breeze going through and the furthest
[1:27:40] deer shaking like that guess so closer
[1:27:43] and then he he used his beak to peck on
[1:27:47] the feathers then when you pegged there
[1:27:49] was no Holmes then he got off there told
[1:27:52] all the birds it has been a lie the owl
[1:27:55] has no hones we have been set free so
[1:27:58] all the birds were set free because of
[1:28:01] this little robin which went and
[1:28:02] investigated and so that days it was a
[1:28:06] lie and they were set free from the
[1:28:08] slavery that they were under you see so
[1:28:12] the devil has been has been trying to
[1:28:14] scare all of us with death through the
[1:28:17] Old Testament and everything no one had
[1:28:19] power over death all the sages of old
[1:28:21] but Jesus Christ when he died on the
[1:28:23] cross of Calvary he decided to call the
[1:28:26] devil on his bluff and he went down he
[1:28:30] went to hell during the three days when
[1:28:32] he was with during the three days when
[1:28:34] he was dead he went down to the hell and
[1:28:37] he went and called out the dab on his
[1:28:39] bluff kicked him and he took the keys of
[1:28:41] death hell and the grave and he called
[1:28:43] him out
[1:28:44] so now death has no hold on you the
[1:28:48] grave has no hold on you because Jesus
[1:28:51] Christ went and he called out the devil
[1:28:53] his bluff and he came he rose up
[1:28:56] triumphant to tell us that it's a lie
[1:28:59] the devil doesn't have no horns it's a
[1:29:02] lie death has no power over you
[1:29:05] hallelujah that's what so we cannot live
[1:29:07] under our own privileges we got to
[1:29:09] believe God's report unto us you see
[1:29:13] Satan is not eternal Satan had the
[1:29:16] beginning so he's gonna have an end
[1:29:20] that's how it is
[1:29:22] creatures of eternity if you had no
[1:29:24] beginning then you have no end
[1:29:26] and we are creatures of eternity is that
[1:29:29] right so when the devil was created you
[1:29:33] were already there on the back part of
[1:29:35] God's mind you saw the devil being
[1:29:38] created
[1:29:39] but it's just because of this birth you
[1:29:41] cannot remember so bye-bye years
[1:29:45] chronologically you are older than the
[1:29:47] devil so don't let the devil fool you
[1:29:49] for no reason
[1:29:50] and when the devil was created when
[1:29:54] Satan was created he was created as an
[1:29:57] angel who was the Archangel and when in
[1:30:00] the in the original creation in God's
[1:30:03] part he angels are of a lower order than
[1:30:06] man when he created Adam before the fall
[1:30:09] men way above angels because angels they
[1:30:13] are servants they wait on us when we
[1:30:16] pray to God for protection it's angels
[1:30:18] that do that it's because they are
[1:30:20] servants
[1:30:21] so when Satan was created he was of a
[1:30:23] lower order than men so Satan by virtue
[1:30:28] said Satan has no authority over you but
[1:30:30] after the fall that's when humanity fell
[1:30:33] to be lower than angels but now after
[1:30:36] the cross of Calvary Christ redeemed us
[1:30:38] back to our original position now we are
[1:30:41] of a higher order any man born again any
[1:30:44] more any man born of the Spirit of God
[1:30:47] you have the authority of the devil
[1:30:50] because you are of a higher order than
[1:30:53] the devil because he is going to have an
[1:30:56] ending but you and I we do not have an
[1:30:58] ending we are going to go back to where
[1:31:01] we came from hallelujah because Edom was
[1:31:04] of Adam was a fair high order but he
[1:31:06] fell so men didn't have no authority
[1:31:09] during that time but after 2000 years
[1:31:12] ago God gave back the authority to the
[1:31:16] bride so it you and I gotta use it when
[1:31:19] URIs refused the devil's report you take
[1:31:23] that and you say I have authority over
[1:31:25] the devil so you have to speak you have
[1:31:27] to keep on praying believing that your
[1:31:30] prayer will overcome all the force of
[1:31:32] the evil one because God gave us back
[1:31:36] the title deed you see when God created
[1:31:38] Adam he gave him dominion over every
[1:31:40] living thing so that that includes
[1:31:43] everything everything created by God
[1:31:46] Adam had dominion over it so now
[1:31:49] everything God created
[1:31:51] which includes Satan and his Devils
[1:31:54] which are the Angels Darwin that fell
[1:31:56] out you have authority over them he's
[1:31:59] only a bluff so if you realize that you
[1:32:02] have the authority over Satan he will he
[1:32:06] will not have anything over you no
[1:32:09] sickness can stand against you you gotta
[1:32:11] go back you gotta fight him
[1:32:13] take back your peace take back your love
[1:32:16] the joy of your salvation you don't
[1:32:18] longer have it go and get it you have
[1:32:20] the authority you have the power to do
[1:32:23] it because you are above him you are you
[1:32:25] are a creature of a higher order than
[1:32:27] the devil himself now because Christ
[1:32:30] went to investigate and called out Satan
[1:32:32] on his bluff we no longer fear we have
[1:32:35] no longer the spirit of fear because
[1:32:37] fear is what any man who was already any
[1:32:40] man who has fear has already overcome
[1:32:42] you're already defeated if you have no
[1:32:44] if you got fear but now because we have
[1:32:47] no fear nothing can stand before us no
[1:32:50] death no cancer no disease no
[1:32:53] afflictions brought to us no coronavirus
[1:32:56] can stand before us because we have the
[1:32:58] authority over everything that the devil
[1:33:01] tries to bring to us because God gave us
[1:33:04] authority amen you see God is a God of
[1:33:07] precedence he like repeating what he did
[1:33:10] before before the found a before Genesis
[1:33:13] 1:1
[1:33:14] he kicked Satan from from from heaven
[1:33:17] after he tried to be prideful and he
[1:33:20] kicked them out back he kicked them on
[1:33:22] the earth and he was now a fallen angel
[1:33:25] an evil angel I'll say and then so he
[1:33:29] liked kicking him that after the cross
[1:33:32] of Calvary he went down when he goes
[1:33:35] when he went to hell to catch the keys
[1:33:37] of death hell and the grave the prophet
[1:33:40] of God dramatized and he said he went
[1:33:42] they and he kicked them he liked he
[1:33:45] liked that experience and now so he
[1:33:48] kicked them before the foundation of the
[1:33:49] world and now he kicked them after the
[1:33:52] cross of Calvary but now Christ left
[1:33:55] there's the scene of the earth but now
[1:33:57] we are representing him you and I we are
[1:33:59] housing Christ in us when you are born
[1:34:02] again of the Spirit of God you have
[1:34:04] Christ within you
[1:34:05] and now cry God was to repeat the same
[1:34:07] kicking so now because you have Jesus
[1:34:09] within you it is your duty to kick Satan
[1:34:12] because since God likes doing it he is
[1:34:15] going to do it with you so don't be
[1:34:18] scared just go just kick he is going to
[1:34:21] fall off and you're going to get that
[1:34:23] victory amen
[1:34:24] you will never fail the first Eve failed
[1:34:27] by the second Eve you and I will never
[1:34:30] fail because our second Adam he will
[1:34:32] never fail Amen so we are taking the
[1:34:35] fight back to the enemy's camp we are
[1:34:38] being offensive not defensive and we
[1:34:41] will overcome nothing can stand in our
[1:34:44] way
[1:34:44] amen how many I agree with me - did this
[1:34:47] morning that we are taking back the
[1:34:49] enemy to the the fight to the enemy's
[1:34:51] camp and we are refused we are refusing
[1:34:54] the enemy's report and we are believing
[1:34:57] God's report only a man and we wanted we
[1:35:01] will when you get and know your
[1:35:03] authority you begin - afflicting your
[1:35:05] afflictions and you begin troubling your
[1:35:07] troubles because you have the authority
[1:35:10] and you got to keep the devil on the run
[1:35:12] amen
[1:35:12] we do not accept terrorism we do not
[1:35:16] negotiate with terrorists
[1:35:18] we do not any negotiations when the
[1:35:21] devil start negotiating with you know
[1:35:23] that he is up to something don't accept
[1:35:25] it when he tries to negotiate with you
[1:35:27] just be offensive get on the offensive
[1:35:30] and victory is sure because you are a
[1:35:33] seed of Abraham you will have a promise
[1:35:36] to possess all the gates of the enemy so
[1:35:38] that by being a child of Abraham you
[1:35:41] have the royal blood of Abraham flowing
[1:35:44] within you go fight that blood is going
[1:35:47] to keep you that faith is going to keep
[1:35:49] you because you are a son of Abraham and
[1:35:51] God will help you a man and he will rot
[1:35:55] victory through you amen let us stand
[1:35:58] upon our feet amen let us sing we've got
[1:36:09] the power in the name of Jesus amen
