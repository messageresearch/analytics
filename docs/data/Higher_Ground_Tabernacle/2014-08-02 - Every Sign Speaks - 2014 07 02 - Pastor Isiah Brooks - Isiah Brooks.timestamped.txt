[0:00] As we stand, let us turn to the word of
[0:03] God. We're going to be coming from
[0:05] Hebrews the 6th chapter. And if somebody
[0:08] up here said, "That looked like my
[0:10] Bible." More than likely, it is.
[0:15] I misplaced mine. I know where it's at.
[0:17] It's in the mail. But, uh, anyway, this
[0:19] was in my office, so I thought I'd
[0:21] utilize it by the grace of God.
[0:24] And you can have it after service.
[0:26] Hebrews 6,
[0:29] you love the Lord.
[0:32] We are a blessed people
[0:34] and uh we are so blessed. Words cannot
[0:38] express
[0:39] our gratitude to the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:43] for what he is doing in our lives.
[0:48] Uh we are so blessed and and and you'll
[0:51] see by the grace of God. I trust that
[0:53] God will give us understanding uh in the
[0:56] word. He will anoint us that we'll be
[0:59] able to minister the thought that he
[1:00] gave unto us unto you. Amen. Uh as we
[1:04] turn to Hebrews 6:17
[1:09] through 20, we'll read there.
[1:13] We also read uh Joel 2.
[1:18] No, we'll just read 1 Timothy. We'll
[1:20] we'll we'll mention that.
[1:22] Hebrews 6 beginning at the 17th verse.
[1:25] wherein God willing more abundantly to
[1:27] show unto the heir of promise the
[1:31] immutability of his counsel confirmed it
[1:34] by an oath that by two immutable things
[1:37] in which he was it was impossible for
[1:41] God to lie we might have a strong
[1:44] consolation who have fled for refuge to
[1:48] lay hold upon the hope set before us
[1:51] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[1:54] soul
[1:56] both sure and steadfast and which
[1:59] enterth into that within the veil.
[2:03] Whether the forerunner is for us enter
[2:05] where excuse me whether the forerunner
[2:08] is for us entered even Jesus made an
[2:12] high priest forever after the order of
[2:15] mazdc.
[2:16] Let us turn to first Timothy 3.
[2:21] Where would we be without the Lord
[2:22] Jesus? Amen.
[2:25] He is he is uh he is our all in all. 1
[2:28] Timothy 3
[2:33] special in a day and time like this
[2:39] 3:16
[2:58] Let's just uh start uh basically at the
[3:04] 13th verse.
[3:11] Oh, excuse me. 12th verse. It's all
[3:12] good. Fight the good fight of faith. lay
[3:16] hold on eternal life where unto thou art
[3:19] also called and has professed a good
[3:23] profession before many witnesses. I give
[3:27] thee charge in the sight of God, who
[3:30] quickenth all things, and before Christ
[3:32] Jesus, who before pointest Pilate
[3:35] witness a good confession, that thou
[3:38] keep this commandment without spot,
[3:41] unrebukeable
[3:43] unto the appearing of our Lord Jesus
[3:46] Christ, which in times he shall show who
[3:50] is
[3:52] the blessed and only potentate, the King
[3:55] of Kings,
[3:57] and Lord of Lords, who only have
[4:00] immortality, dwelling in the light,
[4:03] which no man can approach unto, whom no
[4:06] man have seen, nor can see, to whom be
[4:10] honor and power everlasting. Amen.
[4:13] Charge them that are rich in this world,
[4:15] that they are be not hotminded, nor
[4:18] trust in uncertain riches, but in the
[4:20] living God, who giveth us richly all
[4:24] things to enjoy.
[4:28] Let us pray. Heavenly Father God, we
[4:30] come before you right now thanking you
[4:33] for your grace and your mercy. Lord,
[4:35] without you, Father, we are nothing. And
[4:38] we pray, Father God, that you would
[4:40] bless this service in a special way.
[4:42] Lord, give us utterance here this
[4:44] evening. Give us grace to move
[4:46] completely out of your way. If we have
[4:48] said or done anything, Lord, that has
[4:51] not been pleasing in your sight. We pro
[4:53] pray, Father, that you forgive us and
[4:55] cleanse us, Lord, with your holy fire,
[4:58] Lord, as we commit the service into your
[5:00] hands. Let that perfect and divine will
[5:02] be done. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[5:05] Amen. You may be seated.
[5:17] We are
[5:23] blessed in such a way.
[5:26] And the more I think about the message
[5:29] that God has sent us,
[5:33] the more I realize
[5:35] how blessed we are.
[5:39] Uh
[5:41] when we look and see
[5:45] how great God is
[5:49] and we can see that God himself
[5:54] is such a powerful man if I could say it
[5:56] like this of character.
[6:01] Do you realize amen that God doesn't
[6:03] reveal himself to everyone?
[6:07] There are those whom God actually hides
[6:10] himself from itself from.
[6:13] But the scripture tells us that those
[6:15] who are chosen elected of God to be
[6:19] bride, God will reveal himself. Matter
[6:22] of fact, the scripture tells us it is
[6:24] given to us to know the mysteries.
[6:29] We have had a prophet to come
[6:33] and the world missed it.
[6:37] But we shouldn't be shocked by it
[6:40] because the world or the word declare
[6:44] that the world would miss him.
[6:48] Whenever God would move,
[6:51] the world at large will all always miss
[6:54] God.
[6:55] They look right at him
[6:58] and wouldn't have the
[7:01] faintest idea of who he was or what he
[7:03] was.
[7:06] Many of them would look at God in many
[7:08] cases, especially in the New Testament
[7:10] when Christ came and was
[7:13] in flesh,
[7:15] call him be elab,
[7:17] the devil, false prophet, you name it.
[7:22] They call him a liar.
[7:25] But you see, they were ordained
[7:29] for that.
[7:34] We read and have heard many times uh
[7:37] where the prophet god uh spoke about uh
[7:39] God unveiling himself
[7:44] before the fall. God would walk in the
[7:46] cool of the evening and Adam and Eve
[7:49] would wouldn't have to
[7:52] fear him.
[7:54] And even then he was veiled.
[7:59] God has always veiled himself. And
[8:01] that's why the Bible said, "No man have
[8:03] seen God at any time."
[8:07] Even when Jesus Christ said to his
[8:11] disciples, "When you see me, you see the
[8:14] father,"
[8:16] he was not talking just about his flesh.
[8:20] Because in reality, you can look at my
[8:24] house.
[8:26] 29:12,
[8:29] "But when you see my house, you don't
[8:31] see me."
[8:34] So, he was talking about something
[8:36] greater than the flesh, because remember
[8:38] when Paul came along, Paul said, "We
[8:40] don't know him anymore after the flesh."
[8:43] Amen.
[8:45] So, if it was the natural part of God
[8:47] that we were looking at, you're missing.
[8:51] Amen.
[8:52] Amen. This natural part of God was born
[8:55] in Bethlehem.
[8:57] The natural part of God lived in Egypt.
[9:00] The natural part of God lived, Amen, in
[9:03] Nazareth. And and the and the and the
[9:05] and they said the the Jews said, "Could
[9:07] any good thing come out of Nazareth?"
[9:09] Hallelujah.
[9:11] See, but here there was a woman at the
[9:15] well.
[9:18] And God was veiled.
[9:24] Nobody could see him. And really when
[9:26] she saw him, she thought he was just a
[9:28] Jew.
[9:31] But when he began to tell her things
[9:34] that no man would have known except God,
[9:40] the words that he spoke began to unveil
[9:44] to this woman who he was.
[9:47] Hallelujah.
[9:50] All of a sudden,
[9:53] she said, "We know that when the Messiah
[9:58] comes, he'll tell us these things."
[10:03] And immediately when he said, "I am he."
[10:07] Come on, somebody.
[10:09] The revelation was clearly
[10:12] made to her.
[10:14] Hallelujah.
[10:16] Why? Because she was a seed of God.
[10:18] Amen.
[10:18] Amen.
[10:19] She was a true seed of God. But you take
[10:21] the Pharisees who studied the scriptures
[10:24] and perhaps knew more about the word
[10:27] letter than this woman.
[10:29] Amen.
[10:30] Now, she was no dummy. Now,
[10:32] she had some education, too.
[10:34] But her her understanding was more of a
[10:37] revelation than an education. So when
[10:40] Jesus spoke the word, her eyes were open
[10:44] and she didn't even question anything
[10:46] else on where he was born, where he came
[10:48] from. She knew she had met God in flesh
[10:52] because to the Jews, the Messiah
[10:56] was God in flesh.
[10:58] Amen.
[11:01] I love God.
[11:02] Hallelujah.
[11:04] And I just love the way he does things,
[11:06] you know.
[11:08] I love the drama of the Bible.
[11:12] Amen. You know, uh, brother Keith been
[11:15] sharing some things that God has been
[11:16] opening up to him on in the book of
[11:19] Songs of Solomon. And I don't think
[11:21] nobody could write it that way. It is
[11:24] such a perfect way and it's such so many
[11:27] hidden things
[11:29] in that book, but only the bride could
[11:31] catch it.
[11:32] Amen. To those who are intellectual,
[11:34] it'll be a a book of poems or of some
[11:38] sort, you know, uh they they just never
[11:41] come to know whether it's true or false.
[11:45] Some have been wondering who this damsel
[11:47] is, who this woman is, and you know,
[11:49] some some, you know, they have all kinds
[11:52] of things, but the bride,
[11:54] she's not in question of the book.
[11:56] Amen. because she's the only one that
[11:58] can unlock
[12:01] the mystery that's hidden in there.
[12:03] Why? Because she recognized that that
[12:06] book has been written directly
[12:09] to her.
[12:10] Yes.
[12:12] Now, let me move on. When we look at
[12:14] this thing, Brother Brandham tells us
[12:17] there in in in the unveiling of God, he
[12:20] said God is the God of immorph.
[12:24] And that word immor
[12:27] means to mean that something that cannot
[12:30] be seen
[12:32] right but the thing is already there
[12:37] and what god does is he changes and he
[12:40] when he he he become immor
[12:44] visible right right because remember
[12:48] amen without a mask without a covering
[12:52] you'll never be able to see him Right.
[12:55] Amen. The Bible said he dwells in light.
[12:58] Yes.
[12:59] But the light itself is not God.
[13:04] Because of God, the light exists.
[13:09] Amen.
[13:10] We don't worship a light. Therefore, if
[13:12] that be true, we could just all of go
[13:14] out there and worship the sun.
[13:17] But it's not that. It's what's behind
[13:19] the sun
[13:21] that makes it light. Amen.
[13:24] Now, we look at this thing. You say,
[13:26] "Well, brother, what are you trying to
[13:27] say?" I I'm coming just a moment. I try
[13:30] my best not to be long here tonight. But
[13:32] God in morphe,
[13:35] he's always been that way. And you know
[13:36] what he does? He always hides himself
[13:40] from the wise and the prudent.
[13:42] He always hiding himself. We might call
[13:45] him the serpent seat or or those
[13:47] unbelievers or make believers. He's
[13:49] hiding himself. For an example, God
[13:53] comes down to Sodom and Gomorrah, right?
[13:55] But before he goes to Sodom and
[13:57] Gomorrah, he reveals himself to Abraham.
[14:01] God never revealed himself to Sodom.
[14:07] Never.
[14:09] So why would we be upset
[14:12] about the world and all of those who are
[14:15] falling away?
[14:18] Hello.
[14:20] The matter of it is
[14:23] they never had a revelation
[14:26] of who God is.
[14:28] Hello. You see, I didn't fall in love
[14:31] with Eloa.
[14:34] I fell in love with Isaac.
[14:37] But if it hadn't been for Eloa,
[14:39] I would have never met Isaac. Y'all hear
[14:41] what I'm saying?
[14:43] So, I want you to see here tonight.
[14:47] I'm working on every sign speaks.
[14:53] Every sign speaks.
[14:56] And as I was riding down the road, I I
[14:58] saw all of these signs.
[15:01] And a sign is an indication
[15:04] of something.
[15:07] It literally brings you to a place
[15:11] that you know,
[15:13] Amen. that whatever the signs say
[15:17] once you reaching the sign
[15:20] you reach what it is declaring.
[15:23] Amen.
[15:23] It is a way of communicating. Now we got
[15:27] signs that literally talk.
[15:30] We got signs that flashes words. We got
[15:33] signs. Amen. That gives you full
[15:35] picture.
[15:37] Communicating so that you would have no
[15:39] wondering about what they're trying to
[15:42] advertise.
[15:45] Every sign speaks.
[15:48] God always use signs.
[15:51] Is that right?
[15:52] He said when Jesus would be born, he
[15:54] talk about a star and he talked about a
[15:57] scepter.
[15:59] This would be a sign.
[16:01] He told Isaiah, "I want you to prophesy.
[16:04] A sign."
[16:06] He said, "I give you a sign.
[16:08] A virgin shall conceive." What happened?
[16:11] It was it was actually Mary,
[16:14] she was the sign that Messiah was
[16:17] coming.
[16:20] Amen.
[16:21] And whoever would keep up with Mary
[16:24] would know that Jesus was on the earth.
[16:28] Amen.
[16:29] Hallelujah.
[16:30] But you see, before you could know that,
[16:32] you had to know that Mary was that
[16:34] virgin. Yeah,
[16:37] she was a virgin that literally brought
[16:39] forth the Christ child.
[16:41] Amen.
[16:43] Think about it. God used signs.
[16:46] Amen. The prophet of God said God took
[16:48] three stars and put them into one. And
[16:50] there was wise men who followed the star
[16:53] and they said that star was a sign,
[16:56] that the king of kings,
[16:59] hallelujah,
[17:00] was now on the earth. Amen.
[17:04] Think about God in morphing now because
[17:06] God is so powerful.
[17:10] I was thinking and I think I shared this
[17:12] the other morning, the other day when
[17:14] when God comes along in the Garden of
[17:17] Eden, this this this just this just this
[17:18] just this just this just this just this
[17:18] just this just this just this just this
[17:18] just just this just just this just just
[17:18] this just just this just just this just
[17:18] just this just just this just this just
[17:18] this just this just this just this just
[17:18] this just this just this just this just
[17:19] it it floored me in a way because you
[17:22] know all the time I would read where God
[17:24] would take a lamb why brother talks
[17:26] about it he said a lamb the scripture
[17:28] doesn't say a lamb but you got to
[17:29] realize the reason why he could say a
[17:30] lamb because there was a lamb slain
[17:32] before the foundation of the world now
[17:34] understand this wasn't just any lamb
[17:40] Prophet God tried to show that through
[17:42] blind bottomas when the priest said
[17:45] listen blind bottom said you can't give
[17:48] that lamb away.
[17:50] He said get get another lamb or
[17:53] something. He said but no I didn't
[17:54] promise him another lamb.
[17:56] I promised him this lamb.
[17:59] Right? And so you got to realize, amen,
[18:01] that when God took this lamb in the
[18:04] Garden of Eden, that was a sign.
[18:09] That was a tight.
[18:10] Yes. Amen.
[18:11] God was expressing himself.
[18:14] He was basically saying, "No, no, no,
[18:16] no, no.
[18:17] You mean so much to me. You're more
[18:20] valuable than myself."
[18:22] Oh, come on, somebody. You're more
[18:24] valuable to me
[18:26] and I'm going to skin myself
[18:32] that you might have life.
[18:35] So when when God put that bloody lamb's
[18:39] skin around Adam and Eve,
[18:43] they were wearing the skin of God.
[18:49] Not just the skin of God, but the the
[18:52] God that died for them.
[18:55] And and and it was you got to see what
[18:57] I'm saying.
[18:58] It wasn't just a lamb.
[19:00] That lamb typed out God himself.
[19:04] When he chose that lamb, that lamb
[19:07] represented God, Elohim, the invisible
[19:09] God.
[19:10] This is me.
[19:11] Amen.
[19:13] and I'm going to lay in my life down
[19:18] to redeem you.
[19:22] Come on. It had to be that
[19:24] because God didn't send a second person
[19:27] or third person. Hallelujah. God came
[19:30] down himself.
[19:32] Amen.
[19:34] Huh? Think about this now. Now, when God
[19:38] would lay down his life for you and I,
[19:41] why I've said this many times, not just
[19:44] only fellowship, the relationship was
[19:47] always there, never could be broken,
[19:49] but he wanted the fellowship. He wanted
[19:51] you to know who he was. Not only that,
[19:57] who you were.
[19:59] Amen.
[19:59] Because the fall took away your
[20:01] identity. It took about took away who
[20:04] you really was. Hallelujah. And God
[20:07] through his own life was the only one
[20:09] who could restore it.
[20:11] Oh, come on, somebody.
[20:12] So, you got to realize that's why people
[20:15] say, "Oh, we're beyond Pentecost."
[20:16] Because, see, we're beyond the shouting
[20:19] and the dancing and the speaking in
[20:20] tongues. Don't get me wrong, we do all
[20:22] of that.
[20:23] Amen.
[20:24] We do all of that, but that ain't it.
[20:26] Amen.
[20:27] The thing that Adam and Eve lost in the
[20:30] garden was life.
[20:32] Amen. Amen. And the blood of Jesus
[20:35] Christ come back to restore what? Life.
[20:38] Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[20:40] Life is come to be be restored back to
[20:44] you.
[20:46] Hallelujah.
[20:47] That's why it's so important because we
[20:50] could not stay just in the church ages.
[20:54] Come on, somebody. We had to take a
[20:56] rocket ship.
[20:57] Hallelujah. We had to be led. We had to
[21:00] take off.
[21:05] Let me stop. Let me stop. My point is
[21:08] this.
[21:11] Even when God slew that lamb,
[21:16] that lamb, as I said, had to be a
[21:20] replica
[21:21] of the one that was slain.
[21:24] It was a sign
[21:27] that you can go free.
[21:29] It was a sign that anybody that believed
[21:31] in the blood of this lamb, hallelujah,
[21:34] could go free. Come on, somebody.
[21:37] And remember now they we're wearing this
[21:41] bloody coat so they could never ever
[21:44] forget the experience
[21:47] that someone, not just someone, God
[21:51] himself laid down his life
[21:55] for you and I. Think about it now.
[21:59] When we look and you say, "Well,
[22:00] brother, what can this really be?"
[22:02] Listen, God told Moses, gave him the
[22:05] orders, amen, of the outer court, the
[22:08] inner court, and the holies of holies.
[22:11] And all of the years of the law and of
[22:15] the tabernacle, carrying, Amen. uh uh uh
[22:18] the the ark of the covenant on the the
[22:20] shoulders of the priesthood. All of
[22:23] these years, Israel wondered, "What's
[22:27] behind the curtain?"
[22:30] What's behind the curtain?
[22:32] Huh? But every time they pick up that
[22:35] ark, it was a sign.
[22:38] Come on, somebody.
[22:40] It was a sign that God just doesn't stay
[22:42] in one place, he travels.
[22:44] Y'all hear what I'm saying? Amen. It was
[22:46] a sign. Amen. that you couldn't just put
[22:48] God anywhere because you see, you
[22:51] couldn't put him on a new cart.
[22:53] David done them got in trouble for that.
[22:55] The only way you could place God was
[22:57] over your heart. Oh,
[23:00] come on, somebody. The cart only fat
[23:03] properly over the heart of the priests.
[23:09] Hallelujah. It was a sign that one day
[23:12] God was going to restore back the
[23:14] temple.
[23:16] Come on, somebody. You said, "Well, what
[23:17] do you mean?" Every time the temple was
[23:20] destroyed, was a symbol, was a sign of
[23:25] man's failure.
[23:27] Y'all hear what I'm saying? Because God
[23:28] never judged Israel
[23:31] until the priesthood got a line.
[23:35] Hello, somebody. When the people of God
[23:37] got out of line, hallelujah, then Israel
[23:40] was judged.
[23:41] Amen.
[23:42] Come on.
[23:42] Ezekiel said, "Listen, start at the
[23:45] church." Hallelujah.
[23:47] Start at the engine of the days.
[23:49] Start at all of those folks who's hiding
[23:52] sin in their lives.
[23:53] Amen.
[23:54] Come on.
[23:55] Amen.
[23:55] That's what the word say.
[23:57] Ezekiel said, God told Ezekiel, listen,
[23:59] there's a wall and I want you to look in
[24:00] there.
[24:01] Amen.
[24:02] I want you to see what the people of God
[24:04] are doing behind the closed doors. I
[24:07] want you to see. They say they in the
[24:09] message. They say they believe this
[24:10] word, but watch the sin. Look what they
[24:13] doing. Ezekiel,
[24:16] the very thing that God called them to
[24:18] be, they were far, far, far, far away
[24:22] from it.
[24:23] They were so worldly. Hallelujah. Come
[24:25] on, somebody.
[24:27] Amen. But God said, "Listen, start at
[24:29] the door. Start at the priest. Start at
[24:31] the ancient. Start at the ones who ought
[24:33] to know better. And I want you to sweep
[24:35] through them."
[24:36] Amen.
[24:37] And every man that doesn't have the mark
[24:40] on their forehead, he said, "I want you
[24:41] to slay them.
[24:49] God. They always wondered what was
[24:51] behind that veil because if the priest
[24:54] was living wrong, he never came out to
[24:57] tell.
[24:58] Amen.
[25:00] Hallelujah. And only only the high
[25:01] priest could go back there once a year.
[25:03] Come on, somebody.
[25:05] And they wanted they wanted to see God.
[25:07] They wanted to see God at Mount Si. They
[25:09] wanted to hear him. They wanted to speak
[25:11] to him. Come on, somebody.
[25:14] But you see, they couldn't handle his
[25:16] presence. Why? Because their hearts
[25:18] weren't right.
[25:21] Moses. Moses shut him up. We'd rather
[25:24] listen to you than to him.
[25:27] That's how it is now. People rather
[25:30] listen to the man
[25:33] and they can't even hear God.
[25:36] But what they failed to see. Amen. And
[25:38] when brother Brandham spoke, it was a
[25:40] voice in a voice.
[25:43] Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. And the
[25:45] Bible tells me, Amen, that there were
[25:47] only two out of that old generation,
[25:49] Joshua and Caleb, that could hear the
[25:51] voice of God.
[25:53] Amen.
[25:53] Hear the voice of God. When everybody
[25:56] else was backing up, we can't take the
[25:58] land. Woo. There was a Joshua and a
[26:01] Caleb. Amen. Said, we're more than able
[26:04] to take the land.
[26:06] There are some Joshua and Caleb's right
[26:08] now.
[26:09] Amen. They're saying, "We're more than
[26:10] able to take the land.
[26:13] Let them all go back.
[26:14] Let them look at the giants.
[26:16] The giant churches."
[26:18] Hallelujah. The giant Amen. Preachers,
[26:20] let them look at that. Hallelujah. Yes,
[26:22] there are giants in the land. But let me
[26:24] tell you something. I don't need nothing
[26:25] but one stone to slay Goliath.
[26:27] Hallelujah. One stone. And that's Jesus
[26:30] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[26:32] forever.
[26:34] Hallelujah.
[26:37] Hallelujah. God come down.
[26:41] God and Morphe.
[26:44] He's always been there because you
[26:47] remember when he sent Noah. Noah was the
[26:50] Christ of his day. Did you know that?
[26:55] Amen.
[26:56] Not No, Christ means anointed. Noah was
[26:59] anointed of God.
[27:01] Amen.
[27:01] Y'all hear what I'm saying? Not with a
[27:03] spirit. The same Holy Ghost we claim to
[27:06] have is the same anointing Noah had.
[27:09] He was anointed.
[27:11] Amen.
[27:13] In other words, he became God to his
[27:16] generation. Y'all don't like that, but
[27:18] it's true. Anyhow, Jesus said he did.
[27:22] He said, "You want to crucify me and
[27:24] kill me because I say I'm the son of
[27:26] God." He said, "Even your own scripture
[27:29] declared that whoever whosoever the word
[27:32] of God comes through are not their
[27:33] gods."
[27:34] Amen.
[27:36] Now, I'm just talking about something
[27:38] here.
[27:39] Hallelujah.
[27:40] Because here, the son of man, Ezekiel
[27:42] was anointed. Hallelujah. Jeremiah was
[27:44] anointed. Hallelujah. Come on. Noah,
[27:46] Moses were gods of that day. What about
[27:49] David?
[27:52] Hallelujah. God said, "I've not found a
[27:54] man like that one." Hallelujah. Amen.
[27:57] Look at him. He's a man after my own
[27:59] heart.
[28:02] Come on, somebody. I love the scripture.
[28:04] You know what I'm saying? The Bible
[28:06] tells us, Amen, that God is impossible
[28:08] for God to lie.
[28:14] Hallelujah. Remember, he comes as son of
[28:17] David. Did you know that? Amen. Is that
[28:20] right? When he walked among the Jews, he
[28:22] was son of David. Son of David was
[28:24] nothing but a prophet.
[28:26] But what was that prophet? He was more
[28:28] than a prophet now
[28:29] because he was Jesus Christ.
[28:32] He was the anointed of all ages.
[28:34] He was an the anointed redeemer. Oh my
[28:37] god.
[28:38] And all of them were in him. Moses was
[28:41] in him.
[28:42] Noah was in him.
[28:44] Moses, Joshua, all of them were in him.
[28:47] He was a fullness of the Godhead bodily.
[28:50] Come on somebody. He's packing all of
[28:52] that in him. Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[28:54] He said all the New Testament. Y'all
[28:57] hear what I'm saying? Amen. That's why
[28:59] when he unveiled himself to the prophet,
[29:01] he said the Jehovah God is the same God
[29:03] as Jesus Christ or Jesus Christ is the
[29:06] same God as Jehovah of the Old
[29:08] Testament. Hallelujah. What was he
[29:10] doing? Unveiling himself to the prophet
[29:13] so that the prophet can come and unveil
[29:15] him.
[29:16] Amen.
[29:16] Is that what Moses did? He got the word
[29:18] from God. He brought it down to the
[29:20] people. Amen.
[29:22] What did Jesus say to his disciples when
[29:24] they were on the road to Emmas?
[29:29] H Have you not believed
[29:32] all of the things, all of the
[29:34] scriptures? All
[29:36] that the prophet spoke of me?
[29:39] Not some of it. All that's the problem
[29:42] with everybody now. They're not
[29:43] believing it all.
[29:45] Lord,
[29:46] y'all hear what I'm saying? He's trying
[29:47] to open himself. He's trying to reveal
[29:49] himself to us. Amen. But he he can't
[29:52] reveal it except you re receive all.
[29:55] Amen.
[30:00] Think about it.
[30:02] And that same son of David will be
[30:04] sitting in the on the throne one of
[30:06] these old days.
[30:08] He comes in our church. And that's the
[30:10] problem. You know, he comes in the
[30:12] church as a son of God. You know, the
[30:13] Holy Ghost comes and anoint the people
[30:15] and they say, "Oh, praise God. I got
[30:17] it." But they failed to see God had
[30:19] another move coming.
[30:22] Y'all hear what I'm saying? The same God
[30:24] him offered. They saw Joel too. God
[30:26] said, "I'm going to pour out my spirit
[30:28] upon all flesh." What was he saying? Now
[30:31] understand this now. The whole purpose
[30:34] of this whole redemption plan is to
[30:37] restore man back to what? Being the full
[30:40] tabernacle of God.
[30:41] Amen.
[30:42] Like Adam and Eve, the full tabernacle.
[30:44] God and tabernacling in man in his
[30:47] fullness.
[30:47] Amen.
[30:48] That's the whole purpose. It's nothing
[30:50] less than that. That's why brother
[30:52] Brandon tells us, he said, "God is
[30:54] coming back for character."
[30:55] Amen.
[30:56] Not your man-made character, not
[30:58] psychology. He's coming for one
[31:00] character that he loved.
[31:02] Amen.
[31:02] And that was his own.
[31:05] Hallelujah. And that same character must
[31:09] be found in you.
[31:10] Amen.
[31:12] Come on, somebody.
[31:15] That's that's that's that's the missing
[31:17] part. That's what Pentecost didn't get.
[31:20] They shut him out. That's what Leo was
[31:22] all about.
[31:23] When God was coming to to to make
[31:26] himself known, let's put it this way.
[31:29] Let's put it this way. When he came,
[31:31] Amen. to invite them into his tent,
[31:35] they refused him.
[31:38] You see what I'm saying? Amen. They had
[31:41] uh uh things that that that uh uh God
[31:44] had given them. But when he come to
[31:46] impregnate them to to to wed them, they
[31:49] refused. Why? Because they were married
[31:52] to another.
[31:54] I'm a Methodist. I'm a Baptist. I'm a
[31:56] Presbyterian. And watch what you say
[31:58] when you come to say I'm message.
[32:02] What do you mean by that? This is a
[32:04] message, right? But if you don't know
[32:07] what the message is, you don't know what
[32:08] you're saying.
[32:09] Amen. Amen.
[32:10] You'll be conforming yourself, amen, to
[32:13] men's do dogmas, creeds, and doctrines.
[32:16] Amen.
[32:17] Hello. That's not message.
[32:20] The message is Jesus Christ.
[32:22] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[32:25] forever. Hallelujah.
[32:27] That's what it is.
[32:28] Where? Not in heaven, in you.
[32:33] You become the message.
[32:37] Hello.
[32:39] God told Moses, he says, "Listen, you
[32:41] going to be a sign. I'm taking you down
[32:43] to Egypt and you going to be God to
[32:45] Egypt."
[32:46] Hallelujah. You'll be God to Egypt.
[32:49] Amen.
[32:50] How come Moses become God? Because God
[32:53] stepped out of the bush into Moses.
[32:55] Hallelujah. Why you become God? God
[32:58] steps into you. Hallelujah. And then you
[33:01] become God.
[33:06] But they can't see it. They look at you
[33:08] and says, "Oh,
[33:10] that fell, he say he Christian. He's so
[33:12] boring. He don't do nothing. All I know
[33:16] he does is just go to church. All I he
[33:19] all he does is hit make Christian
[33:21] music." And you know, he ain't he's just
[33:24] boring.
[33:26] I like being boring.
[33:30] I like that's if that's that's what
[33:32] boring is. Praise God. I like it.
[33:39] I was telling somebody the other day, I
[33:42] said, you know, remember when we were
[33:44] children, the stars used to fascinate
[33:46] us.
[33:47] Now we can look up sometime and sometime
[33:49] we don't. It don't mean a thing to us.
[33:52] Now, it becomes common.
[33:54] You know the sun, we don't never thank
[33:56] God. God, I just thank you for the sun.
[33:59] We take it for granted. It's going to be
[34:01] there always.
[34:03] No, it ain't. the one day that the sun's
[34:06] going to pass away. That's the word. But
[34:09] we act like it's going to be there all
[34:11] the time. Come on, somebody. We don't
[34:13] thank God like we ought to, do we?
[34:17] Let me move on.
[34:19] The Bible said, "Without controversy,
[34:20] great was the mystery of godly God was
[34:22] manifested in the flesh." Is that right?
[34:25] God manifested in the flesh.
[34:28] Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[34:29] God manifested in the flesh. Amen.
[34:32] And you and I must understand God must
[34:34] be made manifested in your flesh.
[34:37] Otherwise, there is no token.
[34:40] Amen.
[34:42] The token didn't come to make you sing
[34:43] and shout.
[34:45] It didn't even come to make me preach.
[34:48] It came to exemplify and to declare the
[34:51] life of Jesus Christ
[34:53] is alive. He's risen and he's alive and
[34:57] well. Hallelujah.
[35:00] Oh, glory to God.
[35:02] Come on, somebody.
[35:04] Listen,
[35:06] he comes along and like I said, they
[35:09] always uh
[35:12] fail to see what we come to do. You
[35:15] know, you let me you see where Adam and
[35:19] Eve fail in worshiping God in their
[35:23] life.
[35:25] They chose another life.
[35:31] You hear what I'm saying? And God don't
[35:34] care how gifted you are from the pull
[35:37] pit to the back of the door.
[35:39] If you can't live it, it means nothing
[35:42] to him.
[35:44] Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[35:46] You say, "Oh, Brother Brooks, I got it."
[35:48] I'm not saying you don't have it, but
[35:49] you got to let go and let God have his
[35:52] way.
[35:52] Hallelujah.
[35:53] Y'all hear what I'm saying? You got to
[35:55] let go and let God have his way. Let him
[35:58] beat the clay. Let him shape the clay.
[36:01] Let him get all the drought out of you.
[36:03] And you still ought to say,
[36:04] "Hallelujah."
[36:08] God, I don't want to be suffering. Well,
[36:11] you can't take up his cross.
[36:13] Cuz if you pick up your cross, you going
[36:15] to suffer.
[36:16] Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. Now,
[36:19] listen what he says.
[36:21] Even Even let me read something here.
[36:23] Let me just read this out of out of the
[36:25] unveiling of God if that's okay. Amen.
[36:28] He says, "But it isn't so in the world
[36:30] word, Elohim." Because you see, anything
[36:32] could be God. Come on. And we're not
[36:35] just a God to that people would worship
[36:39] us.
[36:40] Uh-uh. The whole point behind God in us
[36:43] is that God might glorify your father
[36:46] which is in heaven.
[36:48] That they might see your good works and
[36:50] glorify God in heaven. Amen.
[36:52] That's it. Not no man glory here.
[36:55] Amen.
[36:56] Right.
[36:56] Amen. But you got to realize, Amen. when
[36:58] God comes. And that's where a lot of the
[37:00] people in the message is missing it.
[37:02] They think, Amen, that it's just, you
[37:03] know, because I can quote the prophet
[37:05] and quote the scriptures and, you know,
[37:07] uh, how can I say it? Righteously or
[37:10] self-righteously make it the church and
[37:13] do this and that and the other and
[37:15] practice this and practice that. And I
[37:17] still don't like that word practice.
[37:21] It's yielding.
[37:24] It's overcoming.
[37:25] Amen.
[37:26] And God lives it.
[37:28] You don't live it, God lives it.
[37:29] Amen.
[37:30] Right? Y'all hear what I'm saying? It's
[37:32] God living himself out of you. He said,
[37:35] "I am the vine. You are the branches."
[37:38] Amen.
[37:38] It's God's life.
[37:40] Amen.
[37:40] Producing fruit
[37:43] in you.
[37:43] Amen.
[37:44] You don't produce the fruit.
[37:47] But how is it going to happen if the
[37:48] life is not there?
[37:51] God immort. Can I say it like this? I've
[37:55] said it many times. You going to be
[37:56] born.
[37:58] You either birth, you born in this
[38:00] world, and the only way you get out of
[38:02] here is you're born in another one.
[38:05] There's no other way. You won't take no
[38:07] uh ship, you're not going to take a
[38:09] flying saucer or anything like that. The
[38:12] only way you going to get in heaven, you
[38:14] got to be born again. That's what he
[38:16] told Nicodemus. You have to have a
[38:18] birth.
[38:20] And this is the thing. I I I love it. My
[38:22] wife has had many children. And you know
[38:24] what? I can't ever recall her not
[38:26] groaning and moaning,
[38:30] but people don't want to do it. They
[38:31] don't want to get down and agonize no
[38:33] more. The prophet said that's the way
[38:36] you get it.
[38:36] Amen.
[38:38] I ain't talking about what these people
[38:39] theologically have told you in this
[38:43] message. I'm saying
[38:45] desperation
[38:48] will take you there.
[38:51] Hallelujah.
[38:52] Amen. You listen to the token message.
[38:54] Amen. You'll find out desperation will
[38:57] get you there.
[38:58] Amen.
[39:01] Amen. He said there is no other way. He
[39:03] said every birth is a mess.
[39:06] Amen.
[39:07] Every birth
[39:08] is a mess.
[39:12] Can I can I say it like this? I don't
[39:14] mean to be long, but let me put it this
[39:16] way. Amen. And you know, character is a
[39:18] victory.
[39:21] Character is a victory. So listen,
[39:23] whether it be virtue, knowledge,
[39:25] temperance, all the way up to the py, it
[39:27] doesn't matter. You're going to fight.
[39:30] Amen.
[39:30] You got a battle and you must overcome.
[39:34] Hallelujah.
[39:35] Amen.
[39:37] Like I love that. I love that that what
[39:39] that brother said the other day. It's
[39:41] too many Baptist message people.
[39:45] But let me read the quote here.
[39:48] But it isn't so in the word Elohim.
[39:51] Y'all understand me? We're not just
[39:53] talking about being a statue
[39:56] of Mary or something. No, no, no. It's a
[39:58] living a living statue,
[40:03] right? It's got to live.
[40:06] It's got to walk. It's got to talk. It's
[40:09] got to speak.
[40:11] That's what God is looking for. Living
[40:14] vessels.
[40:16] And the only life there is is Elohim's
[40:19] life.
[40:21] See, he goes on. See,
[40:24] it means the self-existent one. Elohim.
[40:27] See that piano cannot be self-existent.
[40:31] Nothing else can be self-existent. So
[40:33] the word Elohim means he that always
[40:37] existed.
[40:39] God can can mean anything. See the
[40:43] difference in the word. That's true. You
[40:45] can make anything a god. Your children,
[40:47] your family, your wife, whatever.
[40:49] You can make them a god, right?
[40:51] But that's not the same as Elohim
[40:54] because whoever they are and whatever it
[40:56] is is not self-existent.
[41:00] Now when it said here that the that he
[41:03] emptied himself or poured out now we
[41:06] would think like this that he vomited up
[41:08] the English word of emptied or uh uh
[41:13] poured out from him. See something went
[41:16] out of him. See something went out of
[41:18] him that was different from him. But the
[41:22] word kenos in the Greek does not mean
[41:25] that he vomited up or something.
[41:30] his arm went off or his eye went out
[41:33] another person
[41:38] that he changed himself.
[41:41] He poured himself into Amen.
[41:45] into another mask into another form. Not
[41:49] another person without him called the
[41:52] Holy Ghost, but it was himself. You get
[41:55] it? He himself poured himself into the
[41:58] people.
[41:58] Amen.
[42:00] Amen.
[42:01] Christ in you.
[42:05] Huh? How beautiful, how wonderful to
[42:07] think God pouring himself in the human
[42:10] being into the believer. Now, now my
[42:13] thing is, how can God pour himself in
[42:16] you and you don't know it?
[42:20] It's not even possible
[42:22] for God to pour himself in you and you
[42:26] don't know it.
[42:27] Amen.
[42:29] Amen.
[42:30] Maybe you don't know what you used to
[42:31] be.
[42:32] Amen.
[42:33] But I can remember what I used to be
[42:36] and I know what I am now.
[42:38] G.
[42:38] And the only reason why I am what I am
[42:41] now because God
[42:44] poured himself in me.
[42:45] Glory.
[42:46] Amen.
[42:47] Amen.
[42:56] Brother Vam said it was just part of the
[42:58] drama.
[43:00] God all the fullness. All the godhead
[43:03] was in Jes uh uh in in in in in this
[43:06] person Jesus Christ. He was God and God
[43:09] alone. Not a third person or a second
[43:12] person or first person but the person
[43:15] God veiled in human flesh.
[43:18] Now why are he saying these things? So
[43:20] that you can understand. Pentecost
[43:22] didn't get this.
[43:24] They didn't get this. This this is this
[43:26] is another age. This is something that
[43:28] God is doing for a special handpicked
[43:30] people
[43:31] so they can make a rapture.
[43:33] Amen. He can tabernacle himself in you
[43:36] and you become God veiled on the earth.
[43:39] Amen.
[43:41] Ah,
[43:43] you shall have power after which the
[43:45] Holy Ghost has come upon you.
[43:47] Amen.
[43:54] That's the way God did. He bred this one
[43:58] to that one to this one is to that one
[44:01] to this one to that one till he got
[44:03] exactly what he wanted. That's how he
[44:08] came down. Y'all understand me?
[44:11] Your makeup is not a mistake.
[44:14] Maybe you might be disappointed, but
[44:16] that's the way God made it.
[44:19] All right. God unveiled himself in a
[44:23] pillar of fire down through the prophets
[44:26] then into the son of God which he was
[44:28] God. See it's the same God
[44:33] bringing out exactly
[44:36] you from perfection to perfection from
[44:39] glory unto glory. That's the way the
[44:41] church goes. Notice through the ages the
[44:44] same way by his prophet he was revealed
[44:47] himself
[44:50] them wasn't exactly prophets they were
[44:53] gods.
[44:55] He says so for what they spoke was the
[44:57] word of God or God's word they were the
[45:01] flesh that God was veiled in.
[45:04] Huh?
[45:05] That's why God Jesus Christ could go
[45:07] down in the days of Noah said how come
[45:09] you rejected me? They could truly say,
[45:11] "Well, we never saw you."
[45:14] And they would be completely right. They
[45:17] couldn't see him. Why? He was veiled
[45:19] behind Noah.
[45:20] Amen.
[45:23] And that's how the world look at you if
[45:25] you're living right.
[45:26] Amen.
[45:27] They can't see God, but it is God that
[45:29] is behind you,
[45:32] veiled in your skin, your flesh.
[45:34] Is that true?
[45:35] Amen. That's why I say this day, the
[45:38] word of God said in this day you'll know
[45:40] that I am in the father. The father's in
[45:41] me and I am in you.
[45:43] If you don't know he's there in you, you
[45:46] better get to the altar somewhere. I
[45:48] don't care where it's at. In the
[45:50] backwoods, in your closet, wherever it
[45:52] is, you need to know that by revelation,
[45:54] God is in you.
[45:57] Amen.
[46:01] They were the flesh that God was veiled
[46:03] in. They were gods. Jesus said himself
[46:05] said, "How can you condemn me when I say
[46:08] I'm the son of God and your own law says
[46:10] that that them who the word of the Lord
[46:13] came to was God?" See h what do you say
[46:17] about that? And you say to yourself,
[46:19] "Brother Brooks, what are you trying to
[46:20] say?" I'm not trying to say it. I'm
[46:22] trying I'm saying it.
[46:25] If God is tabernacling in you, that's
[46:27] God in flesh.
[46:29] Amen.
[46:30] Amen.
[46:30] You know, I'mma tell you something.
[46:34] God's not schizophrenic.
[46:36] That's why God said, "You got to die."
[46:39] Because he's the only one that he wants
[46:41] living in the house.
[46:42] Yes, sir.
[46:44] Huh? He's the only one. Paul said, "It's
[46:47] not I that live, but it's Christ that
[46:49] lives in me."
[46:51] So Paul was saying, "I'm dead." You see
[46:53] the outward appearance of Paul, but
[46:55] that's not me. Oh, Lord have mercy. I
[46:58] live in him and he and me, we have
[47:01] united together. Hallelujah. And we're
[47:03] one. I am alive because I am in him. You
[47:07] don't see me no more.
[47:10] Come on, somebody.
[47:12] Is that okay? You say, "Well, brother,
[47:14] sign, sign, signs." You remember Tamar?
[47:17] I love Tamar. Tamar was wise woman. She
[47:21] said, "Give me that signate bracelet and
[47:23] u and and and and staff."
[47:29] Amen. He said, "I'll bring back that
[47:31] sheep. I bring the sheep back. But she
[47:33] wasn't worried about the sheep.
[47:35] Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. Amen. She
[47:39] She knew that somehow this thing was
[47:42] going to be unveiled.
[47:45] She'll be caught in the act. Hallelujah.
[47:47] Per se. Because she knew nature was
[47:49] going to tell on her.
[47:51] And I can almost see the girls, amen,
[47:53] around tell, you know, something wrong
[47:55] here. Her husband's dead. And and that's
[47:58] not fact. Amen.
[48:01] Something else going on. We better tell
[48:03] Judah something's going on. Her his her
[48:06] his daughter-in-law done played the
[48:08] harlot.
[48:10] Hallelujah. Amen. But she understood.
[48:14] Amen. What that signant meant? You know
[48:15] the signate is just a sign.
[48:18] It is a signate. Amen. Si g n t. Sign
[48:22] it.
[48:24] Hallelujah. And that signate, amen, was
[48:27] was given to her. So she realized, Amen.
[48:29] Listen, I got you now, boy.
[48:31] Hallelujah.
[48:32] Hallelujah. He said, "This woman, she
[48:35] deserved death."
[48:39] He say, "Wait a minute now. I got the
[48:41] sign. This ain't just anybody's child."
[48:46] I got the man's signet.
[48:49] Hallelujah.
[48:51] I got the man's signet.
[48:54] Who? What man? I'm the man Christ Jesus.
[48:56] I got his signet. Amen.
[48:58] This pregnancy, Amen. Amen. is just not
[49:00] by denomination or something like that.
[49:02] This pregnancy is by Judah himself, the
[49:05] lion of the tribe of Judah.
[49:07] Amen.
[49:08] I got it.
[49:09] Amen.
[49:10] Death can't strike me.
[49:13] She said, "Discern within yourself." I
[49:15] don't mean to be moving, but I can't
[49:16] help it tonight. She said, "Desern
[49:19] within yourself." Amen. Who who these
[49:21] things belong to.
[49:24] Judah looked at and said, "You're a more
[49:25] righteous woman than me."
[49:29] Hallelujah. You are more righteous woman
[49:31] than myself. Hallelujah.
[49:34] She was freed.
[49:37] Free. Hallelujah.
[49:39] Ain't God good?
[49:41] Oh my my my my. Is that all right?
[49:45] Amen. The word of God tells us amen to
[49:48] Haggi 2:23. And in that day, sayith the
[49:51] Lord of hosts, will I take thee uh A
[49:54] Zurubel, my servant, the son of Shotel,
[49:58] sayeth the Lord, and will make thee as a
[50:00] signate, for I have chosen thee, said
[50:03] the Lord of hosts. Now you say, what do
[50:06] you mean? Every prophet
[50:10] was a sign, was a sign.
[50:14] Hallelujah.
[50:16] And you know what? Let me put it this
[50:17] way. throughout the church ages, whether
[50:20] they be reformers, every man of God that
[50:22] was led by God
[50:24] was assigned,
[50:26] Luther, Wesley, right? And you know who
[50:29] made it out of those church ages? Those
[50:32] who followed that ministry,
[50:35] who heard the voice of that day. Come
[50:38] on, somebody.
[50:39] It's true. There was no other way to get
[50:42] out of there. There was no other way to
[50:44] escape the flood except by Noah.
[50:46] Amen.
[50:47] Oh, come on, somebody. But you got to
[50:49] realize now the power of God has gone
[50:52] off the scene. There is no other way to
[50:55] escape except you come to know the Lord
[50:58] Jesus.
[50:59] Amen.
[51:00] Amen.
[51:01] You got to come and understand who the
[51:03] pillar of fire really is.
[51:05] Amen.
[51:06] It is God in veil. That's right. But you
[51:09] got to realize when God, Amen, ripped
[51:11] that temple in two, you know, the
[51:14] prophet of God said they could look
[51:15] through the and see the see the real
[51:18] lamb of God.
[51:19] The temple was so situated they can look
[51:21] through the wall of where the rent was
[51:24] and they can see the real lamb of God.
[51:26] And they never did catch it.
[51:29] He said, "Why do you think he read the
[51:31] veil?" He wanted them to see what was
[51:34] behind it. For thousands of years, they
[51:36] wanted to see it.
[51:37] And he read the veil and they still
[51:39] couldn't see it.
[51:41] Hallelujah. But there was a little Roman
[51:44] soldier. Amen. Whose eyes was opened
[51:46] just a little bit. He said, "Surely,
[51:49] this was the son of God."
[51:51] Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. There was
[51:54] a thief on the right hand said, "Surely,
[51:57] this is the son of God. Have mercy on
[51:59] me."
[52:00] He saw God in plain view. And because of
[52:04] it, he said, "You'll be with me this day
[52:05] in paradise."
[52:07] See, when you see God in plain view,
[52:09] that mean you are a true seed of God.
[52:11] Amen.
[52:12] Hallelujah.
[52:13] Amen. Why? Because the devil can't see
[52:15] who he really is.
[52:17] He served him for eons and he still
[52:19] didn't know him.
[52:20] Amen.
[52:22] If he knew him, his children would know
[52:23] him.
[52:25] Hallelujah.
[52:26] For eons he served him and still didn't
[52:28] know him. He still don't really know
[52:30] him. He came up and said, "If you be the
[52:32] son of God,
[52:33] if you be the son of God," Hallelujah.
[52:36] He should have known he was,
[52:39] but his reasoning kept kept messing with
[52:41] if you be the son of God.
[52:44] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He he
[52:46] questioning. And here the woman at the
[52:48] well say, "Surely
[52:50] will the Messiah come." Hallelujah. We
[52:52] know he'll tell us these things.
[52:56] Come on. Ask the blind man. They that he
[52:59] he saw it all. Is that right? As the
[53:02] blind man, he saw it all. You said,
[53:04] "What do you mean?" They said, "Blind by
[53:06] the males." He saw it all.
[53:08] When everybody was thrown in him, amen,
[53:11] and wondering about him when they said,
[53:12] "This is Jesus of Nazareth." You know,
[53:15] amen. This is the man who's doing all
[53:16] the healing. He says, "Oh, thou son of
[53:19] David, have mercy on me." He questioned
[53:21] it not. Couldn't even see with his
[53:23] natural eye, but his spiritual eye knew
[53:24] that was him.
[53:25] Amen.
[53:26] Oh my God. I see. You know, when you got
[53:29] spiritual eyes, you don't question it.
[53:30] Amen.
[53:31] You just go on with it cuz you know it.
[53:33] You can see things that the carnal mind
[53:35] can't even see.
[53:39] Glory to God. Have mercy on us.
[53:43] Now, amen. When we look at the
[53:44] scripture,
[53:46] I want to say this to you here. God
[53:49] comes along and he gives us Malachi 456,
[53:52] St. Luke 17:30, Revelations 10. Now, and
[53:56] I'm going to say this. He comes and he
[53:59] shows us a sign.
[54:01] A sign.
[54:03] A sign.
[54:05] The pillar of fire all over again.
[54:09] First pillar of fire since the Old
[54:10] Testament was the pillar of fire they
[54:12] saw
[54:15] on on the road of Damascus.
[54:19] Paul, which name is was Saul at the
[54:22] time, saw the pill of fire. What was
[54:24] that all about?
[54:26] See, the veil had been rent and now he
[54:29] had no need to be hidden.
[54:32] Come on, somebody. The very thing that
[54:35] all these Jews wanted to see, Paul saw
[54:37] it, and it blind him.
[54:40] Who art thou, Lord? I am Jesus.
[54:44] You persecute me, Paul. And it's hard
[54:47] for thee to kick against the prick.
[54:50] Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[54:51] Amen. And that pillar of fire comes
[54:53] again in this day. Amen.
[54:56] As a sign
[54:58] that God is unveiling himself again
[55:02] to the bride of Jesus Christ.
[55:04] Hallelujah. Because he wants you to know
[55:06] who he is.
[55:07] Because once you can see who he is,
[55:09] you'll begin to know who you are.
[55:15] Amen. I'll never forget it. There's a
[55:17] difference between being saved. There'll
[55:18] be a lot of people saved.
[55:20] Y'all hear what I'm saying? You can save
[55:21] a car. You can save a boat. Hallelujah.
[55:23] Y'all hear what I'm saying? Amen.
[55:25] There'll be a lot of people saved by
[55:27] just giving a drink of water, but
[55:29] redeemed mean I came from him. I go back
[55:31] to him. Hallelujah. Amen. I go back to
[55:35] where I come from. Hallelujah.
[55:37] Glory to God. I've been with him and he
[55:39] got bought me back. Hallelujah.
[55:42] Glory to God.
[55:43] Done brought me back.
[55:46] That's all that matters to me right now.
[55:48] I've been bought with a price
[55:50] and I'm not my own. Hallelujah.
[55:52] Amen. Is he that justifies me is he he
[55:56] that sanctified me. Is he that filled me
[55:58] with the Holy Ghost? Hallelujah.
[56:00] Amen.
[56:00] Is that all right?
[56:03] Oh my my my. Think about it. God himself
[56:08] in human flesh. I brought all this to
[56:10] say. I brought all this to say at the
[56:13] end of this message, don't you settle
[56:16] for nothing less than the life of Christ
[56:19] in you.
[56:21] Belonging to this little fellowship will
[56:23] not secure you.
[56:25] The only securance you assurance and
[56:28] security that you would ever have is
[56:30] when you've been sealed by the Holy
[56:31] Ghost.
[56:33] There is nothing else nothing out of
[56:35] that. You can Paul say you can
[56:37] understand all mysteries.
[56:39] Come on somebody.
[56:40] And still not have it.
[56:42] That's all I'm telling you. So it ain't
[56:44] all that. But you look at all of these
[56:45] people who thought they were so deep in
[56:47] the message. Look what's happening to
[56:48] them. See, because they they thought
[56:50] that was the Holy Ghost.
[56:53] Come on, somebody.
[56:55] I can I can write my wife from Ohio or
[56:58] wherever and send her a letter, but the
[57:00] letter ain't me.
[57:03] I can tell her what I'm doing and
[57:04] everything else and she can envision
[57:06] everything, but the letter ain't me.
[57:09] But she know me and know what I'm doing.
[57:13] Amen.
[57:13] That's what the people have done.
[57:15] They've taken the letter of it so they
[57:17] know how he works.
[57:19] And they failed to say, "Wait, I got to
[57:21] have him.
[57:22] I can't hardly wait till my husband come
[57:24] home." Y'all know what I'm saying?
[57:26] Hallelujah. Cuz when he comes home, I
[57:29] got him.
[57:30] And the letter becomes secondary.
[57:38] That's what so many people have done.
[57:42] [Music]
[57:43] They fought. Many people fought me for
[57:45] years. Oh, brother Brooks, I don't
[57:46] believe the Holy Ghost. You got to do
[57:47] all of that to get the Holy Ghost. Let
[57:48] me ask you, do you have it yet?
[57:52] Like you really want it.
[57:54] Is he in the outer court, the inner
[57:56] court, or the Holies of Holies?
[57:58] Come on, somebody.
[58:00] There's a veil that a baby must break to
[58:02] come through.
[58:03] And there's a veil that you must break
[58:05] through to come out.
[58:06] Amen.
[58:07] If I'm making sense,
[58:10] you love the Lord.
[58:12] Amen.
[58:12] Let's stand.
[58:21] God is getting us ready.
[58:27] Hallelujah.
[58:33] Oh, ain't God good to us?
[58:40] Let's sing that song. It's manifesting
[58:42] time. that's been on my heart this
[58:43] morning, this evening.
[58:46] Amen.
[58:48] You love God,
[58:51] people of God. He's real. He's real.
[58:54] He's real. He's real. Darkness can't
[58:58] comprehend light. You know, right? And
[59:01] light can't comprehend darkness.
[59:04] Some of the things people I just can't
[59:06] comprehend it. Thank I thank God for it,
[59:09] though. I I do. I really do. I'm not
[59:10] boasting. I'm just saying you think
[59:12] about the world and the things the way
[59:14] things are going. I I just thank God I
[59:16] can't comprehend that. Amen. You love
[59:19] God.
