he's the only one who will never leave you because he said I will never leave you I will never forsake you I will always be with you amen we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we're so happy to be here this morning with you amen anyway Let's uh go straight to the word let's turn to John uh first John chapter 5. we only read one verse first John chapter 5 verse 4. when the Bible says that for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith amen I'll read it again for whatsoever is one of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our face faith is a victory La foreign amen you know that yeah man let's bar ahead and clean nanotech father God will come before your Eternal Grace Lord just to say Thank You Lord we thank you Father God for being so good to us Lord you protected us father God lord and you brought us our here father God in your praise us again Lord that's why we prayed for the Lord and you'll be with us Lord Jesus that you take control of the services Lord and you lead everything well we want you to speak to our hearts oh God lord we want you to answer our questions Lord to provide to all our needs one Lord to heal our sickness certainly the Lord was with us that's why amen here in first John where we read I'll read it again where's that first John chapter 5 verse 4. for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that Overcomers the world in our face amen you need to have faith to have the victory you need faith for your deliverance you need faith for your salvation foreign [Music] Brenham I really want to get rid of this spirit and I want you to pray for me for her but that spirit will never but that spirit will still was still there the prophet's messages go to the prayer line and the prophet will pray for her but every day I'm really I really want to be delivered from this Spirit everything my name is but the prophet was praying for her but the spirit that she was still smoking the prophet but you wonder but so uh you we know all of us know that the prophet always the prophet had Faith amen the prophet uh here is you know sickness that word you know uh uh uh uh worse than that the prophets miracle happened that was even you know worse than you know smoking is the thing that was happening that sister had the willing to get I mean to be delivered said sure I've been I've been uh but she wasn't desperate enough amen because if you're not desperate that's because it doesn't matter who's praying for you man you will not get whatever you asked you need to have that desperation was keep on coming she was always coming to the prayers sick she was sick and she went to the doctors said that you have you have cancer this cancer will kill you so once you heard that the cancer that she had will kill her that sister became desperate because it was a matter of life or death he was either um healed or I'm dead she went back to the prophet and the prophet prayed for her and she was healed because Faith needs a desperate foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign foreign foreign truly in vain his salvation hoped from the Hills and from the multitude of the mountains truly in the Lord our God is salvation of uh his salvation of Israel amen it's that's where the Salvation comes from the Lord say oh don't understand yeah that's where you find yourself amen because if we go again in Isaiah chapter five verse 29 to 31 verse when you see that the Bible says that he giveth uh he gives strength to the weary and increases the power to the weak if that is [Music] uh uh uh grow tired and weary and young men stumble and fall ma'am college but those who hope in the Lord comes and not to be famous those are the people who hope in the Lord amen they put all their strengths [Applause] amen the Bible says that their strength will be renewed it'll be ridiculous foreign I'm worth coming from my help comments which made Heaven and Earth he that keepeth Israel shall neither Slumber or sleep The Lord Is Thy keeper the sunshine the Lord shall preserve the Lord shall preserve thee from all evil together we shall preserve thy Soul the Lord shall preserve that going out and thy coming in from this time force and even forever amen the Lord will always be on YouTube the Lord will always be with you [Applause] um it's a plane yeah amen where do I go amen there is only one rock and yes where I know where I stand on that rock is your sacrifices because when you are with him hello look at the disciples and you were there going uh forget where they were going to imagine Jesus was there slipping and the devil said well since Jesus is slipping now it's my time to kill him and then the water became amen water that was still amen and lose the controls the Tempest The Tempest was coming you many felt like for the disciples felt like that was their life that that was the end of it can you imagine that those disciples they were used to the waters they were used to they were fishermen did they picture all kinds of Tempest at all he said he said that all kinds of waves but this one was was acceptable this one was one was one of the kind I don't miss it this one kind of woke them up this is not the usual that we usually say is that woke up Jesus Lord help us and when he woke up he steal everything when the Tempest is coming even when those big waves are coming back sometimes Jesus [Applause] let him come listen you won't find the solutions say Jesus help me I need your help like that sister amen she had cancer death was knocking on that boy from that time she became desperate amen desperate the inspiration is something really good faith in action foreign foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign thanks [Applause] I know you have the answers foreign yeah man you have the answers for all my questions amen you provide to all my needs women you heal me when I'm sick you deliver me when I need deliveries [Music] amen you watch me when I'm dirty life concentration you might give me anything Lord I don't want to send you women I will take it it's your favorite part because I have confidence because I put in my face that's just remain my foreign talking about imagine for 38 years I don't imagine if you put on Twitter amen waiting to be the first person to get into the pool I don't know for 38 years amen every time you're trying to go you want to go to the pool hello and nothing has changed amen I've been trying for 30 years but I'm still here amen I've been praying for 38 years there is no change and a certain man was there which had an affirmative 38 years when Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time and in in that case versus amen that was Jesus asking him on this kid repossessed do you want your healing the impotent man answered in him saying sir I have no man when the water is troubled to pull me into the uh I have no man wondering Waters travel to put him into the waters [Applause] I am coming another another step is down before me Jesus saith unto him rise take up thy bed and walk is this really left wild with this report only a match amen this man the Bible didn't say that this man started asking questions but how am I going to do it come on I've been laying here for 38 years how how is this how how is this gonna happen amen by the Bible says that and immediately amen and took up his bed and walked it doesn't matter how long you know you've been asking for that same thing Bots come here so says no matter how long you've been waiting for that delivery because it might have been longer than 38 years what was that question hold on the way the answer is on the way Amen to conquer means to override um [Applause] [Applause] foreign uh amen you ask yourself foreign doesn't come from the hills my help doesn't come from the mountains [Applause] let us find a solution to your problems solution you know ever let us reason together whatever your problem is about problems just talk to him hello he's really excuse me the reason why we don't see any victories it man you feel a little bit sick amen you run straight to the doctor amen you have a little headache you want to get a appeal an ibuprofen ibuprofen amen did you talk to your god did you talk to your makers why did you ask him hey man did you ask him to deliver you tomorrow you want to make a big decision yeah David [Applause] [Applause] yeah I knew exactly where to go because you knew that same God is the same God Amen who will do it again David didn't rely on one experience you didn't just rely on one victory that was building amen there's a story of a man it happened in 1800s amen a man who was pushing uh uh a hand car uh no McDonald's the pump it it's like you know for it to go you have to pump it and then it's I don't know okay all right French sometimes is hard yeah it's just a car so comment share you I'm pretty sure you yeah so for it to go uh faster you have to pump it yes because he uses the train tracks thank you so that man was going from a county to another County and also so it's the time so he got on that that hand car and it started pumping it he said as he was pumping it so hard and fast um started going it says that man got shot and when you have happens in our lives cities sometimes we get one experience with the Lord performance our own experience and experience that is so great an experiences and that's that experience built to momentum experience amen people are neighbors are friends they see how God worked with us amen but there's people they don't see that you know sometimes in our life before we know we got so lazy amen that we let the devil to come in and yeah so we're just going and living Our Lives based on the past reputation news experiences since it's because of something that happened five years we need a daily experience we need an experience every day amen you ask yourself when was the last time I experienced it is have experimented women and God pray and ask for another one just don't stop with one experience just don't stop with one experience will build a will build a reputation amen which happens a lot with preachers and pastors they all start with you know great they have you know build built the reputation and everybody knows them as great men in reputation amen Ministry of pastorous forsaken God long time because of an old miracle that happened in his life somebody resurrected somebody who protected people are still believing that he's still the same as he was yes amen but they don't see the apostle that the devil has come and understood taking that experience it's a thing that happens to a lot of Believers amen will leave on yesterday's news the experience that we had yesterday the experience that needs to help us face what is coming amen it's not something that we had yesterday and then stopped there say Patrick it's something that will set us on the road [Applause] amen amen amen I'll read the prophet here it's really early and uh three kinds of Believers though the message paragraph 81 and 82. he says that and there it was standing there is um yeah the odds was them odds odds so everything was so come see don't have no Bloodshed he said don't have no Bloodshed let some men come fight me it is the story of

met the littlest man in the car in the country little stoop shoulders he said do you mean to tell me that the army of the Living God will stand there and let that uncircumcised Philistine defy the army of the living why he was shocked at it because because he was a Believer the others were make-believers he was a genuine believer he said if you were afraid I know I'll go fight him what a
