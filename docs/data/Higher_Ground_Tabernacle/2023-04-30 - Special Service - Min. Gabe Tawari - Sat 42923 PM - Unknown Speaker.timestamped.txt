[36:29] you know sometimes I'm I'm I may seem
[36:32] like I'm putting on a show
[36:34] but I I know one thing I come to
[36:36] entertain him
[36:38] and you know it's not to entertain no
[36:40] one else
[36:41] you know so I can act the way I want to
[36:44] and I can worship him the way I want to
[36:46] because I'm pleasing him
[36:49] amen you love the Lord I'm not going to
[36:52] take long but uh you know I think I'll
[36:55] thank God for our brother Gabriel to
[36:57] worry I'm I'm on my tongue is you know I
[37:01] mean it's anointed right now so I got to
[37:04] keep it from speaking
[37:05] uh but we we we're going to have our
[37:08] brother
[37:09] introduce his family
[37:11] but Gabe and I and his wife uh we go
[37:15] back
[37:17] for many years even when I was in Lima
[37:19] Ohio and you know we did a recording
[37:22] together and uh I still have some of
[37:24] those CDs I didn't bring them with me
[37:26] today but I'll bring some tomorrow
[37:28] uh if you will they're free for you if
[37:31] you want them you'll be blessed
[37:34] and uh we just thank God for all that
[37:37] God has done for us
[37:39] and I'm he's a he's a and I don't want
[37:41] to praise him uh because I realize it's
[37:44] the god that's in him uh but since he's
[37:47] been here I have been truly uplifted in
[37:50] my spirit just because of the words of
[37:52] wisdom that God speaks through him and
[37:55] uh I just know that he's a man that
[37:57] lives it and I appreciate him by the
[38:02] grace of God and we appreciate every one
[38:04] of you who have come out tonight I was
[38:07] expecting a bigger crowd but I figured
[38:09] because of the rain you know and I don't
[38:11] know where ever you know
[38:15] somebody will have an excuse me
[38:19] nevertheless I appreciate it we we come
[38:22] for the blessing
[38:24] you know I don't know about y'all but
[38:25] when I was a boy
[38:27] you know we I love to eat then
[38:30] so around dinner time I made sure I was
[38:33] at home
[38:34] right because I wanted my portion now I
[38:37] understand you my mama had a lot of
[38:39] children
[38:41] you know I got a lot too I got eight of
[38:43] them but nevertheless they didn't have
[38:45] to wait in line like I did and so I knew
[38:47] that if I didn't get there early and
[38:49] early enough that my food was going to
[38:51] be eaten it was going to disappear and
[38:53] nobody would know who ate it and so I
[38:56] knew that if I didn't get there so I
[38:57] didn't want the the ghost or whatever to
[38:59] eat my food I wanted to eat my own food
[39:01] so I would be there on time
[39:04] and that's the thing that's what people
[39:05] don't understand
[39:06] the ones that come early you get the
[39:09] bigger
[39:11] right so I appreciate our brother I can
[39:14] go on because I'm feeling pretty good
[39:15] right now they call that stimulation
[39:18] but uh we're gonna let our brother come
[39:20] if he would hi brother Gabriel and uh
[39:24] when we uh he has some singing and he's
[39:28] a great musician a great brother and
[39:32] we're going to have him come and uh his
[39:34] family I guess he introduced them uh
[39:37] don't mean to take up so much time I I
[39:40] always say I'm not going to do that
[39:42] I don't mind
[39:45] I was enjoying the spirit I could have
[39:49] just sat back there and enjoyed the the
[39:51] service
[39:52] um
[39:54] we got some people from the
[39:57] congoose my French is no longer any good
[40:00] but but I remember that
[40:05] praise God um I'm gonna have my family
[40:09] come on I'll just introduce him as he
[40:13] would come
[40:14] yeah that's my oldest son leading the
[40:17] charge you might not be able to tell but
[40:19] he is a one-quarter Indian so my father
[40:23] is from from India
[40:25] I'm half Indian and he's he's quarter
[40:28] Indian and so when he was born we wanted
[40:31] to give him an Indian name
[40:33] so we named him
[40:35] amen which means divine grace Sundar
[40:38] which means beautiful so his name is
[40:40] beautiful divine grace but when people
[40:44] from India see his name and then they
[40:45] see his face they don't think that's the
[40:47] right the right uh the right person he

[56:59] family
[57:01] you know
[57:03] tell you a funny story
[57:06] and it's not to make you um
[57:09] laugh but sometimes we we hear things
[57:12] and it makes us um
[57:15] just feel more comfortable with one
[57:16] another result
[57:22] but he was pastoring in Lima years ago
[57:26] and I was visiting him
[57:29] and he told me a sister in his church
[57:31] was complaining to him
[57:34] and her complaint was
[57:38] that she brings in
[57:41] I'm sorry that he brings in
[57:44] all these no-name preachers
[57:50] she wanted some big name preachers
[57:55] and he brought in no name preachers no
[58:00] but what Jesus said when he came
[58:04] he said I come in my father's name
[58:08] and you receive me not if
[58:11] another shall come in his own name I'm
[58:14] reading from John 5 43.
[58:19] he said him or you received
[58:22] and then he asked a question
[58:25] how can you believe
[58:30] which receive honor one of another
[58:33] [Music]
[58:36] and sickness
[58:39] the honor that Cometh From God only
[58:48] in Psalm 20
[58:51] I'm sorry in Psalm 34.
[58:54] David says I will bless the Lord at all
[58:57] times and his praise shall continually
[58:58] be in my mouth is
[59:05] my soul munam shall make her boast Suga
[59:14] the humble lumbler
[59:17] shall hear thereof he is
[59:21] and be glad
[59:23] o magnify
[59:26] the Lord with me
[59:29] so tonight meant to know I don't come in
[59:32] mind no name
[59:34] but I come in Jesus name the name above
[59:38] all names
[59:48] they rejoice and they are glad because
[59:52] my God it's high and lifted up
[59:56] in his name is
[1:00:04] and you should be glad tonight
[1:00:07] that my name doesn't matter
[1:00:10] but his name does
[1:00:12] his name matters
[1:00:14] his name matters
[1:00:17] because at the name of Jesus
[1:00:21] as it says community
[1:00:24] and Philippians 2 Don Philippines and
[1:00:28] verse 9 and 10.
[1:00:31] that God has highly exalted him
[1:00:35] and giving him a name
[1:00:38] that is above every name then at the
[1:00:43] knee at the name of Jesus
[1:00:51] of things in heaven and things in Earth
[1:00:55] and things under the Earth
[1:01:01] and it says
[1:01:04] also USI and I believe it's uh
[1:01:08] uh Colossians
[1:01:10] that they will never
[1:01:12] be any name higher than the name of
[1:01:15] Jesus
[1:01:17] in this world is
[1:01:22] so in the name of Jesus there's
[1:01:25] Authority tonight yeah there's Authority
[1:01:28] tonight there's Authority tonight
[1:01:32] there's power amen
[1:01:38] amen amen so we started with this verse
[1:01:44] in Romans chapter 5.
[1:01:48] and when you read the Bible
[1:01:52] we recognize
[1:01:55] that what it says is
[1:01:57] exactly what it means exactly
[1:02:00] what it means
[1:02:02] and sometimes we don't read the Bible
[1:02:04] carefully
[1:02:08] so we read the Bible
[1:02:10] and we're feeling one way yeah
[1:02:15] and so we think the word of God
[1:02:19] says something different because we're
[1:02:21] feeling a certain way
[1:02:24] for instance
[1:02:29] being
[1:02:31] Ito
[1:02:32] can anybody tell me what tense that is
[1:02:38] anybody went to grammar school here
[1:02:43] what tense is this is
[1:02:46] present tense
[1:02:47] continuous
[1:02:50] it's not something for the future
[1:02:54] do you know what Justified means
[1:02:57] it means righteous
[1:03:03] how many feels righteous don't answer
[1:03:05] Justice
[1:03:07] how many feels righteous don't answer
[1:03:09] but answer it in your heart
[1:03:14] but this is talking about a present
[1:03:16] tense righteousness
[1:03:20] regardless of what we feel like
[1:03:26] it says we have
[1:03:28] no we will have
[1:03:31] but we have
[1:03:34] amen we have peace with God
[1:03:37] anybody ever felt it's like like God was
[1:03:41] angry with them
[1:03:44] there's an old song we used to sing yeah
[1:03:48] it's called he brought me out the masoti
[1:03:51] and it starts out is
[1:03:54] and remember this first verse is talking
[1:03:56] about somebody who's now born again
[1:04:01] and it says my heart was distressed
[1:04:08] Jehovah's Jehovah dread frown
[1:04:14] Calera
[1:04:16] is rap
[1:04:19] and low in the pit
[1:04:23] where my Sensei dragged me down fancy
[1:04:30] but then it says I cried to the Lord
[1:04:35] I cried to the Lord
[1:04:37] from the deep
[1:04:40] Mary clay
[1:04:42] who tenderly brought me out
[1:04:45] to Golden day
[1:04:49] there was a time yeah
[1:04:52] and I know I'm talking to everybody
[1:04:54] tonight
[1:04:56] so I'm talking to Believers and maybe
[1:05:00] some unbelievers
[1:05:01] I'm born again
[1:05:04] so maybe not born again
[1:05:06] and I don't know but I'll tell you this
[1:05:10] is
[1:05:10] it's the same word
[1:05:12] if you're born again
[1:05:14] and if you're not born again and it
[1:05:18] doesn't matter how long
[1:05:19] you've known about God
[1:05:22] he wants you to know him
[1:05:25] he wants you to know him
[1:05:28] and this verse in chapter five
[1:05:33] is talking about Fowler people Dijon who
[1:05:38] have been born again
[1:05:42] so if you haven't been born again
[1:05:44] it doesn't apply to you
[1:05:47] but I've got good news
[1:05:50] okay so what I said it first
[1:05:53] that's the bad news
[1:05:55] if you haven't been born again how many
[1:05:58] knows Romans 6 23.
[1:06:07] wages of what you earned
[1:06:10] some of us
[1:06:14] I heard Billy Graham say it this way one
[1:06:17] time
[1:06:18] he says people sow their Wild Oats all
[1:06:21] week
[1:06:24] that means not good to see
[1:06:28] and they come to church on Sunday
[1:06:31] and they pray for crap failure
[1:06:35] but that's not how it works
[1:06:38] whether you're dead in your sins or
[1:06:40] you're born again
[1:06:48] [Applause]
[1:06:54] foreign
[1:06:55] amen amen so we want to sow good seats
[1:06:59] and you know what the best seat is
[1:07:02] the word of God the word of God said
[1:07:06] apology so by the grace of God as a
[1:07:09] servant of God
[1:07:10] so in the feet of the word
[1:07:14] not in me I have the Holy Spirit but the
[1:07:18] life is in God
[1:07:21] and the life is in his word
[1:07:23] so if we just speak the word of God
[1:07:26] brings forth life
[1:07:28] that's what we're going to talk about
[1:07:32] amen so talking about faith a little bit
[1:07:36] and we're going to go back to that verse
[1:07:38] and look at the tenses Lord willing
[1:07:45] it might have been brotherless somebody
[1:07:48] asked me the title of the sermon
[1:07:52] and I found my experience
[1:07:56] I have a bad track record
[1:08:00] of titling the service
[1:08:04] because I write down my notes
[1:08:08] and what I think God wants to say is
[1:08:16] sometimes he flips
[1:08:19] not a different gospel but it's a little
[1:08:22] bit different so we're just going to let
[1:08:25] God say what he wants to say
[1:08:27] we're expecting from him amen God wants
[1:08:31] to show up
[1:08:33] and he's here he's here so in Ephesians
[1:08:37] 6 and 16.
[1:08:40] above all taking the shield of Faith
[1:08:43] wherewith ye shall be able to clench all
[1:08:46] the fiery darts of the wicked is
[1:08:55] okay so let's go back in our um our
[1:08:58] story here
[1:09:01] when we read the word of God
[1:09:04] let's read what it says
[1:09:06] and examine that with our experience
[1:09:15] okay
[1:09:16] ready
[1:09:18] a quiz
[1:09:19] you know interrogation
[1:09:22] we all read the verse
[1:09:27] how many fiery darts
[1:09:30] on
[1:09:34] get through the shield of Faith
[1:09:37] um
[1:09:43] okay don't answer all at once
[1:09:46] but you could answer this in a few
[1:09:48] different ways
[1:09:51] you can answer it by what you've
[1:09:53] experienced
[1:09:54] experience you could answer it by how
[1:09:57] you feel um
[1:10:02] the things
[1:10:07] but the things that are not saying
[1:10:13] so if we want to know how many fiery
[1:10:15] darts
[1:10:17] get through the shield of faith
[1:10:20] we gotta look at what the word of God
[1:10:22] says about it
[1:10:23] and you know how many get through the
[1:10:25] shield of Faith
[1:10:27] somebody say it with me
[1:10:32] how many darts get through the shield of
[1:10:34] Faith
[1:10:37] sometimes we go through our week
[1:10:41] and we feel like oh the devil hit with
[1:10:44] me at the dark oh
[1:10:49] you know flesh
[1:10:52] that's how we feel
[1:10:55] and it could be what's happening
[1:10:58] because I don't know your life
[1:11:02] but I know what the word of God says
[1:11:07] and the truth is in the word of God
[1:11:10] it was available
[1:11:21] foreign
[1:11:38] in first John 5 and 4.
[1:11:44] for whatsoever is born of God overcometh
[1:11:46] the world
[1:11:50] first John 5 and 4.
[1:11:53] for whatsoever is born of God overcometh
[1:11:55] the world
[1:11:57] and this is the victory
[1:11:59] that overcometh the world
[1:12:02] even our faith
[1:12:05] I don't care how you feel tonight
[1:12:09] not that I don't care about you
[1:12:13] but God wants our feelings
[1:12:17] to be directed
[1:12:19] by his word by the Holy Ghost that's
[1:12:23] what he that's her he wants for us
[1:12:25] tonight
[1:12:26] it doesn't matter if we feel like an
[1:12:28] overcomer
[1:12:31] can hurt us tonight
[1:12:33] there's protection available to us
[1:12:37] Victory available for us tonight
[1:12:41] now in Luke chapter 6 and 46.
[1:12:47] Jesus says
[1:12:49] and why call ye me Lord Lord and do not
[1:12:52] the things which I say
[1:12:58] um
[1:13:02] in the Hebrew culture
[1:13:05] um
[1:13:07] they had a way
[1:13:10] of emphasize the the
[1:13:15] issue in the American culture I don't
[1:13:19] like to chew American when we want to
[1:13:22] emphasize
[1:13:25] oh we pound our fists
[1:13:29] oh we wave our arms
[1:13:32] that's how we emphasize
[1:13:35] in the Hebrew culture
[1:13:37] when they wanted to emphasize
[1:13:40] they wouldn't do it that same way
[1:13:43] they would repeat
[1:13:45] so when Jesus would say verily verily
[1:13:50] that was the strongest way he could say
[1:13:53] a point to you
[1:13:54] he says verily verily
[1:13:57] Jesus
[1:14:00] that's how they did it
[1:14:05] he's talking about people
[1:14:09] that are emphasizing G and sister
[1:14:12] that Jesus is Lord
[1:14:16] but they're doing something different
[1:14:24] so let's read on I don't even live
[1:14:27] whosoever cometh to me
[1:14:29] um
[1:14:30] and here with my Saints and do with them
[1:14:36] I will show you to whom he is like
[1:14:39] he is like a man which built in house
[1:14:42] and digged deep it's wrong
[1:14:47] and laid the foundation on a rock yeah
[1:14:53] and when the flutter Rose Avenue
[1:14:57] the stream beat vehemently upon the
[1:14:59] house
[1:15:01] and could not shake it
[1:15:04] before it was founded
[1:15:07] somebody say it was founded it was
[1:15:11] building
[1:15:12] this Foundation is a foundation
[1:15:15] was on the rock it is
[1:15:19] but he that heareth
[1:15:21] and there was
[1:15:24] like a man is that without a foundation
[1:15:31] built in the house
[1:15:34] upon the Earth means on the dirt
[1:15:39] in the Book of Matthew he uses the word
[1:15:43] bad foundations
[1:15:52] against which the stream did beat
[1:15:54] vehemently
[1:15:58] and immediately
[1:16:01] and the ruin of that house was great
[1:16:06] now let's look at this portion of
[1:16:08] scripture
[1:16:12] on the outside
[1:16:14] um
[1:16:15] exterior you couldn't tell the
[1:16:17] difference
[1:16:19] they both built houses
[1:16:23] they both said Lord Lord
[1:16:30] when was the time of the difference
[1:16:32] known
[1:16:35] for the trials
[1:16:38] when the trials came
[1:16:41] when the trials came
[1:16:43] and some of us
[1:16:46] we walk in our life
[1:16:48] from one failure
[1:16:51] to the next uh are you not
[1:16:55] but the Bible says were to go from
[1:16:58] strength the only to force the strength
[1:17:01] on false from glory to God to Glory from
[1:17:05] Faith before to Faith that's what the
[1:17:07] word of God says
[1:17:09] amen amen so that's what we want this is
[1:17:14] so I don't judge anybody here tonight
[1:17:18] but as we're reading this is
[1:17:24] foreign
[1:17:42] tells us how to live in Victory
[1:17:46] and even if you've been born again
[1:17:51] that same old devil serves you
[1:17:54] they'll try to get you you continue to
[1:17:57] live as a slave
[1:17:59] even after you've been set free
[1:18:05] and God wants you to walk in the freedom
[1:18:07] of his word
[1:18:09] where the fiery darts
[1:18:12] everyone
[1:18:14] somebody say everyone
[1:18:16] stop
[1:18:18] by the shield of Faith
[1:18:21] Hallelujah
[1:18:24] yes yes
[1:18:27] and if you're not yet born again
[1:18:30] you can be born again today
[1:18:34] amen amen amen but what is the
[1:18:37] difference
[1:18:38] the difference is the foundation the
[1:18:41] difference
[1:18:42] in Matthew 16 and 17 you don't know
[1:18:46] Jesus was talking to the disciples
[1:18:50] firstly asked them who do people say
[1:18:52] that I am
[1:18:54] um
[1:18:56] they say some say this some say this
[1:18:58] something
[1:19:00] you know John the Baptists
[1:19:05] then he said who do you say that I am
[1:19:10] and Peter says
[1:19:15] you are the Christ
[1:19:18] son of the Living God
[1:19:20] and Jesus answers in verse 17 blessed
[1:19:23] art thou Simon barjona is
[1:19:31] for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it
[1:19:33] unto thee is
[1:19:35] but my Father which is in heaven
[1:19:39] and I say also unto thee that thou art
[1:19:43] Peter and Upon This Rock it is
[1:20:02] shall not Prevail against it
[1:20:07] we're in we're not in Ankeny anymore
[1:20:09] right what city is this uh what's that
[1:20:13] Windsor Heights Windsor Heights Windsor
[1:20:15] Heights when I came into winter Heights
[1:20:18] there was no gate of the city
[1:20:22] but in all days
[1:20:25] there were Gates
[1:20:27] and you may have been to a city
[1:20:31] where there's a gate
[1:20:35] in different countries there's borders
[1:20:40] has anybody ever crossed the border of a
[1:20:43] country
[1:20:45] has any has anyone here ever been to war
[1:20:48] yeah
[1:20:51] but you know if you know of wars
[1:20:56] did you ever hear of any War that's
[1:20:58] because
[1:20:59] where somebody picks up
[1:21:01] Hamas they're border gay
[1:21:05] and carries out to war
[1:21:08] and says this would be a good weapon it
[1:21:10] is to beat the enemy over the headwind
[1:21:15] so we have to understand
[1:21:17] the picture that Jesus is talking about
[1:21:22] because some people read this and this
[1:21:25] is what they think Jesus is saying
[1:21:29] he's building his church
[1:21:33] and the Gates of Hell won't beat it to
[1:21:35] death
[1:21:39] that's not what he said
[1:21:42] do you know when the gates of the city
[1:21:43] come into play
[1:21:46] videos
[1:21:49] are going to destroy that City
[1:21:52] that's when the gates of hell yeah
[1:21:55] so he's talking about a church
[1:21:58] not a surviving church but a Victorious
[1:22:01] church
[1:22:02] because when Jesus died
[1:22:05] and he rose is that all power
[1:22:10] in Heaven and Earth is
[1:22:15] and he poured that power
[1:22:18] into the church
[1:22:21] and it says that he's waiting
[1:22:24] at the right hand of God is
[1:22:31] enemies he made his footstool yes
[1:22:36] does anybody know who the Last Enemy is
[1:22:41] in First Corinthians 15.
[1:22:44] The Last Enemy to be destroyed
[1:22:51] it's this so this is talking about a
[1:22:53] Victorious Church
[1:22:55] the same life that was in Jesus he
[1:22:59] walked out into the church until the
[1:23:02] church
[1:23:03] takes away those Gates
[1:23:13] the Church of the Living God
[1:23:17] that's the church that doesn't
[1:23:19] understand the Mandate or the gospel
[1:23:21] evangelo
[1:23:26] and so Jesus said who's going to build
[1:23:28] the church
[1:23:33] and the Gates of Hell
[1:23:35] won't stop it will not Prevail against
[1:23:40] it
[1:23:41] so now we begin to understand
[1:23:45] why the thing the Devil Comes against
[1:23:48] most
[1:23:52] is the foundation is
[1:23:54] the foundation
[1:24:00] it says if the foundation be destroyed
[1:24:04] foreign
[1:24:38] be destroyed
[1:24:41] the devil will try to destroy the
[1:24:43] foundation
[1:24:44] he'll try to destroy your foundation and
[1:24:48] if you don't have a solid foundation
[1:25:07] in the old days
[1:25:13] maybe uh some of you have heard it it
[1:25:16] was an awesome time and it went like
[1:25:18] like this I'll just sing it
[1:25:20] hold the fort for I am coming Jesus
[1:25:24] answer still anybody ever heard that
[1:25:27] wave the answer back to Heaven by thy
[1:25:30] Grace we will
[1:25:32] I used to sing that song I used to like
[1:25:35] that song
[1:25:36] I hate that song
[1:25:40] I am not holding any farts
[1:25:45] the devil's trying to hold the gate say
[1:25:48] hell the job is he say he said
[1:25:51] do you know what holding a fort is about
[1:25:54] something about you camping out waiting
[1:25:56] for the rescue
[1:25:57] but Jesus already won the victory
[1:26:01] and he said he's the one
[1:26:07] and that Victory comes from the
[1:26:10] foundation
[1:26:11] so God doesn't care how your house looks
[1:26:15] like tonight
[1:26:17] and don't misunderstand me um
[1:26:22] it is important how we build simple
[1:26:25] important than how we build is what we
[1:26:27] have built upon
[1:26:30] the day will try every work the Apostle
[1:26:34] Paul said that the day will try it
[1:26:39] 'll be Tried by fire
[1:26:45] but the church WIll exist God has
[1:26:48] equipped
[1:26:49] to walk victorious
[1:26:52] in First Corinthians chapter 2 and verse
[1:26:55] 12 you know
[1:27:03] it says this this you see now we have
[1:27:07] received
[1:27:08] not the spirit which is of the world but
[1:27:12] the spirit
[1:27:13] which is of god
[1:27:15] that we might know
[1:27:18] the things that are freely the shoes
[1:27:22] given to us of God
[1:27:26] a few verses back is
[1:27:30] the Apostle Paul quotes
[1:27:36] from the prophets of the Old Testament
[1:27:39] and he said I have not seen
[1:27:42] you have not heard
[1:27:45] either have entered in the heart of man
[1:27:50] hath prepared for them they love him
[1:27:55] but those eyes Mrs you are talking about
[1:27:57] natural eyes
[1:27:59] those ears I'm talking about natural
[1:28:02] ears and so sometimes people
[1:28:05] uh
[1:28:20] the things that God has prepared
[1:28:23] for them to love him
[1:28:25] but they didn't read the next verse half
[1:28:33] all right somebody tell me what tense
[1:28:35] hath is
[1:28:40] so God has already revealed them
[1:28:44] by his word
[1:28:46] but he said you need the Holy Spirit
[1:28:52] it freely belonged to you
[1:28:55] it freely belong to you so I have the
[1:28:58] spirit of God in Me
[1:29:00] And even if you haven't been born again
[1:29:03] the spirit of God
[1:29:05] can still speak to you but he's going to
[1:29:09] speak to you one thing
[1:29:11] one thing
[1:29:15] and if you ask God to save you
[1:29:20] he's not going to do anything to save
[1:29:22] you
[1:29:24] he's going to send you to a preacher
[1:29:27] who's going to tell you about
[1:29:30] the finished work
[1:29:33] the things that are already done things
[1:29:39] through the Holy Spirit open our hearts
[1:29:41] tonight to the things that are already
[1:29:44] done
[1:29:46] Complete because we're not running away
[1:29:48] from Gates
[1:29:51] and we got a shield
[1:29:54] that stops every fiery dark
[1:29:58] amen amen
[1:30:01] and if you don't have that yet
[1:30:03] you can have it tonight
[1:30:06] and if you do have it the devil's
[1:30:09] tricked you out of using it
[1:30:11] you can have a shield of Faith how many
[1:30:14] knows the shield doesn't work unless you
[1:30:16] lift it up
[1:30:19] [Music]
[1:30:23] to me
[1:30:26] female
[1:30:30] Ephesians
[1:30:35] taking the shield of Faith
[1:30:40] it's useless
[1:30:45] something that is already done
[1:30:49] come on come on so just like I said
[1:30:54] God won't do anything to save you
[1:30:56] tonight
[1:30:59] except from pointing to the work that's
[1:31:01] already been finished
[1:31:07] but if you have been safe
[1:31:10] he uses the same thing
[1:31:13] to give you Victory
[1:31:16] and he tells you the same way
[1:31:21] um
[1:31:29] [Applause]
[1:31:53] these are different pictures
[1:31:56] but they're telling the same story
[1:31:59] in one picture
[1:32:02] there's victory yeah
[1:32:06] there's defeat yeah defense but God's
[1:32:10] desire for the church
[1:32:11] is Victory
[1:32:15] and so the devil tonight
[1:32:18] will want to destroy your foundation
[1:32:24] in first John 4
[1:32:26] and verse 17 it says this
[1:32:30] is
[1:32:31] hearing is our love made perfect
[1:32:36] that we may have boldness in the day of
[1:32:38] judgment
[1:32:42] um
[1:32:50] how many knows what boldness is
[1:32:54] if it's okay I'd like to say a few words
[1:33:05] we have some of you who are married here
[1:33:09] [Music]
[1:33:12] and he to get married
[1:33:14] you have to do something called a
[1:33:16] proposal
[1:33:19] and it works different ways in different
[1:33:22] cultures
[1:33:26] and some you might go to the father
[1:33:28] first is
[1:33:32] come in
[1:33:35] sir
[1:33:35] [Music]
[1:33:38] and you may
[1:33:40] sir I really admire you know Mr your
[1:33:44] family
[1:33:45] and your daughter
[1:33:47] and anyway
[1:33:51] but you're now bold
[1:33:53] sir I'm gonna marry your daughter
[1:33:55] nothing you do that's not how you go all
[1:33:57] right
[1:34:02] but this is boldness
[1:34:08] the day of judgment
[1:34:12] now answer this question
[1:34:14] in your heart
[1:34:18] when you go stand before the Lord
[1:34:28] will he say to you yes
[1:34:33] guilty
[1:34:35] or righteous
[1:34:38] foreign
[1:34:43] now there's some people yeah digital
[1:34:45] that have been in church a long time
[1:34:49] and they don't know the answer to that
[1:34:51] question is
[1:34:56] they're trying to pray you should say
[1:34:58] that they're trying to do everything
[1:35:00] that they can you just said
[1:35:02] to make up for what they did
[1:35:05] [Music]
[1:35:06] um
[1:35:15] when they get up there
[1:35:17] by some Miracles
[1:35:22] now I didn't write
[1:35:24] first John 4 17.
[1:35:27] Jesus he wrote it through John but that
[1:35:32] was the spirit of Christ in him
[1:35:35] from this place is our love made perfect
[1:35:41] now notice he's talking about a process
[1:35:45] but it's talking also from a starting
[1:35:49] point
[1:35:52] and he says from this starting place on
[1:35:56] oh the love is made perfect
[1:36:02] we'll read some more of that verse but
[1:36:04] I'm just going to break it down by the
[1:36:06] grace of God
[1:36:10] once again the word of God means exactly
[1:36:12] what it says
[1:36:15] so if he says from here
[1:36:18] means from right where he's saying right
[1:36:20] there
[1:36:24] I don't know how this will translate to
[1:36:26] French
[1:36:30] there's a word
[1:36:32] context the context
[1:36:37] if you take the text
[1:36:40] out of context the old context what do
[1:36:44] you have left
[1:36:47] and there's people that take the word of
[1:36:49] God yeah and they take it out of context
[1:36:51] and they don't read the whole thing and
[1:36:55] they twist it all around and make them
[1:36:57] say things that the word of God doesn't
[1:36:58] say
[1:37:00] what it says right here he's talking
[1:37:03] about a place by which we grow to
[1:37:06] Perfection but it's not the place that
[1:37:09] you start from
[1:37:10] not the place that you end from the
[1:37:13] place that you start from there's a
[1:37:16] place of baldness he found the place
[1:37:18] that you started
[1:37:21] you start knowing already
[1:37:25] the answer is
[1:37:27] when you stand Before the Throne of God
[1:37:34] if you don't know the answer to that
[1:37:37] God wants your foundation to be sure
[1:37:41] and that doesn't mean you're not born
[1:37:44] again
[1:37:49] when I was in my early twenties
[1:38:04] he's preaching on Grace
[1:38:08] and he was just sharing the simple
[1:38:10] gospel of grace
[1:38:14] and how did it works
[1:38:17] and how it takes the work off of you
[1:38:24] and I was hearing him preach and I've
[1:38:27] been a Christian a long time
[1:38:32] I have been born again
[1:38:35] filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:38:39] leading Bible studies
[1:38:41] with the young people
[1:38:45] on the campus of the University of
[1:38:47] Michigan Michigan
[1:38:52] but when he was preaching yeah and I was
[1:38:55] saying Amen to the word because he was
[1:38:58] just reading the word
[1:39:00] but after the service was over
[1:39:03] my feelings
[1:39:05] said this
[1:39:07] yeah I know there's Grace
[1:39:11] but that's too easy
[1:39:14] there's something more
[1:39:20] religious ideas
[1:39:23] religious ideas
[1:39:27] they weigh us down
[1:39:29] you sit outside
[1:39:31] they weigh us down
[1:39:35] when God wants us to walk
[1:39:40] now don't misunderstand it Grace is
[1:39:43] powerful Grace would change your life in
[1:39:47] the book of Titus it says the grace of
[1:39:48] God has appeared oh man
[1:39:54] we should walk holy Grace will change
[1:39:58] your life
[1:40:00] in the modern world
[1:40:03] people this is what they think race is
[1:40:08] not that he could ever die but it was
[1:40:10] his body right
[1:40:13] um
[1:40:13] but
[1:40:18] they think he died so that you don't
[1:40:20] have to feel guilty
[1:40:23] and so people preach this gospel
[1:40:27] tell them you don't have to feel guilty
[1:40:30] it is
[1:40:35] but he didn't come so you didn't feel
[1:40:37] guilty
[1:40:40] but he came to give you New Life
[1:40:42] new life universe
[1:40:46] right that isn't camping out at the Fort
[1:40:49] waiting for the next attack
[1:40:53] this is whether you know it or not the
[1:40:56] church's mandate degrees
[1:40:59] and Jesus
[1:41:02] the church has finished that mandate
[1:41:07] [Applause]
[1:41:33] [Applause]
[1:41:51] [Applause]
[1:41:59] but he fears the church because God is
[1:42:03] in his church
[1:42:13] it says these staggering words do you
[1:42:16] see
[1:42:17] astounding words
[1:42:22] I'm all off the notes now I said that
[1:42:25] could happen
[1:42:26] but God says what he wants to say
[1:42:29] it says
[1:42:31] only under who Jesus
[1:42:34] be glory is in the church
[1:42:38] by Christ Jesus
[1:42:41] throughout all ages
[1:42:44] World Without End
[1:42:47] amen
[1:42:49] amen amen
[1:42:51] do you notice
[1:42:54] when Jesus was introducing himself
[1:42:56] reintroducing himself to John in
[1:42:58] Revelation
[1:43:01] some of his Divine attributes
[1:43:07] and he said I am the amen amen in other
[1:43:11] words when I say
[1:43:15] it'll be done just as I said
[1:43:19] amen it'll be done just I said
[1:43:25] amen
[1:43:27] think about it
[1:43:30] in Ephesians 3 and 21.
[1:43:37] it talks about God getting Glory he
[1:43:39] boundaries but how does it say he would
[1:43:42] get glory
[1:43:44] in his church
[1:43:47] do you know what glory is
[1:43:52] something you behold
[1:43:57] this water bottle
[1:43:59] not that glorious
[1:44:02] a certain type of Glory as far as water
[1:44:05] bottles are concerned
[1:44:06] it doesn't leak
[1:44:08] right it's got a straw yeah
[1:44:14] when I put it behind here
[1:44:16] you don't know anything
[1:44:19] about the glory of the water bottle
[1:44:21] because it's not revealed
[1:44:25] in Romans chapter 8
[1:44:27] it says that the sufferings
[1:44:30] of this present time
[1:44:33] how many are in this present time
[1:44:36] all of us
[1:44:38] are not worthy
[1:44:41] to be compared
[1:44:43] with the glory
[1:44:45] that shall be revealed in US
[1:44:51] but what's the glory that shall be
[1:44:53] revealed in us
[1:44:55] that means God's Own Divine lives
[1:45:01] so that people know
[1:45:05] foreign
[1:45:07] [Applause]
[1:45:36] amen amen
[1:45:38] so when we think about Glory
[1:45:41] we got to think about how God wants to
[1:45:43] get Glory come on
[1:45:46] we can read all through the Bible
[1:45:49] people who wanted to give God glory
[1:45:54] but God wants to be glorified
[1:45:58] according to his Holiness
[1:46:00] his attributes to who he is
[1:46:04] right it's not just his power
[1:46:07] so it is his power
[1:46:10] it's not just his Mercy but it is his
[1:46:14] Mercy it's not just his justice but it
[1:46:17] is his Justice you know there's people
[1:46:19] that want to walk in the power of God
[1:46:21] but they don't want to walk in the
[1:46:23] Holiness of God
[1:46:25] that's not God
[1:46:29] but when God's glorious revealed
[1:46:34] when The Last Enemy is put under the
[1:46:36] church's feet
[1:46:39] you're also going to see God's holiness
[1:46:47] you're going to see his righteousness
[1:46:49] but you know how you're going to see it
[1:46:50] see the glory of the water bottle this
[1:46:53] is the silly examples
[1:47:02] Jesus is seated in heaven at the right
[1:47:05] hand of the father
[1:47:07] these are symbols because we know God
[1:47:10] feels all spaces
[1:47:13] and have our being in him it only so
[1:47:17] he's everywhere
[1:47:18] but how did he want to be glorified
[1:47:24] in Psalm 19. you know Psalms it says the
[1:47:27] heavens
[1:47:28] declare the glory of the Lord
[1:47:33] and they do you eat the phone
[1:47:36] but when God wanted to be glorified he
[1:47:38] wanted to show off who he is
[1:47:41] before the foundation of the earth
[1:47:44] there's one thing that he did yeah
[1:47:48] and you know what he did he flew the
[1:47:51] lion
[1:47:53] he flew the lamb so that he could have
[1:47:57] his dream home
[1:47:59] so that he could have his dream home so
[1:48:02] that he could have his dream home we
[1:48:05] don't serve a week
[1:48:08] so when he starts he finishes he
[1:48:12] finishes he finishes
[1:48:16] amen amen anybody ever tried to build
[1:48:19] something let's get going
[1:48:22] you get started you do something wrong
[1:48:26] oh I gotta undo that you should do it
[1:48:29] I'm an engineer
[1:48:31] sometimes I'm working on things to these
[1:48:34] shoes and I have to rip something out
[1:48:36] and redo it it's just uh
[1:48:39] software engineer sometimes I build
[1:48:42] things on my home
[1:48:45] I get it's almost done one thing's wrong
[1:48:49] gotta rip it out in my face start over
[1:48:54] there's other things yeah the shoes
[1:48:58] try to do just say do fail you want to
[1:49:00] do it
[1:49:02] and you're just not able to
[1:49:05] do it the way you want to do it
[1:49:07] I'm a musician musician and
[1:49:12] there's certain things that I can play
[1:49:14] yeah
[1:49:15] and there's certain things that I cannot
[1:49:17] yeah yeah
[1:49:20] but I can hear the music in my mind
[1:49:23] and I move towards it is but I can't
[1:49:27] play it yeah
[1:49:30] but God doesn't have any of these
[1:49:33] problems he's not confused he's not weak
[1:49:37] and he knows how to get the job done so
[1:49:41] he doesn't have to go backtrack
[1:49:43] the way that he designed
[1:49:54] so we can be assured
[1:49:57] that the Mandate that he has given us we
[1:50:02] are fully
[1:50:03] equipped equipped to carry it out
[1:50:08] amen
[1:50:10] you know I was thinking one time
[1:50:20] I was sitting at a youth camp
[1:50:25] a man was preaching yeah and
[1:50:34] how many knows the name of Williams
[1:50:38] how many knows he was a prophet the
[1:50:41] prophet
[1:50:45] in the gifts of discernment
[1:50:48] and healing that at least we haven't
[1:50:52] heard about you um since the book of
[1:50:55] Acts
[1:50:59] and anytime we see a man gifted like
[1:51:01] this
[1:51:03] [Music]
[1:51:04] um
[1:51:06] and he would pray for people
[1:51:08] and they would get healed and he could
[1:51:12] look into their life somebody would come
[1:51:15] as for prayer
[1:51:17] and if they had a secret sin is
[1:51:20] God would show him what it was
[1:51:23] and he would tell what it was away from
[1:51:26] the microphone
[1:51:28] so that they would know when you say if
[1:51:31] you deal with this is you'll
[1:51:34] um you'll get healed
[1:51:39] and it was God working through him
[1:51:43] William Branham didn't heal a single man
[1:51:46] brother did not heal a single man every
[1:51:50] man that has been healed from beginning
[1:51:52] but
[1:51:57] sometimes we did we get in these uh you
[1:52:01] know we were talking about boldness
[1:52:05] and sometimes we get to wondering we get
[1:52:08] to wonder am I okay am I okay
[1:52:13] and this this brother said yeah
[1:52:17] many of us
[1:52:20] if brother Branham was here right now
[1:52:24] he looked in your life
[1:52:28] that you were okay is it okay
[1:52:33] and if he walked in right now
[1:52:36] we'd all probably be pretty excited by
[1:52:39] the resurrection and if he looked at you
[1:52:42] and told you you were okay was it okay
[1:52:46] you'd be feeling pretty good but let's
[1:52:49] take it another level
[1:52:51] what if Jesus walked in the door now
[1:52:54] we're getting excited
[1:52:56] what if Jesus walked in the door
[1:52:59] burdens yeah
[1:53:01] acting out a little bit all right
[1:53:12] just one second we're gonna do a little
[1:53:14] drama it's impromptu
[1:53:17] all right we'll we'll go right out here
[1:53:46] okay
[1:53:48] so brother John and this drama
[1:53:53] he's gonna
[1:53:54] um
[1:53:55] be Jesus
[1:54:01] now come with me
[1:54:03] in your imagination right now
[1:54:08] and he's gonna walk in evandre
[1:54:11] and let's just do a drama together
[1:54:17] when Jesus appeared
[1:54:20] to the disciples on the road to Emmaus
[1:54:26] in The Book of Mark don't leave the mark
[1:54:28] it says they didn't recognize him
[1:54:30] because he appeared to them in another
[1:54:34] form
[1:54:35] in other words he didn't look like he
[1:54:38] looked
[1:54:41] spending time with them
[1:54:44] and I don't know why he did this
[1:54:46] but he did it so it wasn't like they're
[1:54:49] just looking at him and couldn't
[1:54:50] recognize him
[1:54:53] it says I believe it says their eyes
[1:54:55] were holding
[1:54:56] but in mark it tells us why they didn't
[1:54:59] see him because he was in another form
[1:55:04] so Jesus could walk in here tonight
[1:55:08] looking just like Brother John
[1:55:12] but I'll tell you this
[1:55:14] if you know Jesus
[1:55:17] when he comes in the room
[1:55:20] I don't know it's him
[1:55:24] and so I'm just asking you to come with
[1:55:26] me he's coming in another foreign okay
[1:55:43] thank you
[1:55:49] Glory Hallelujah
[1:55:52] Praise Your Name Lord
[1:55:55] blessed be your name Jesus we worship
[1:55:58] you now don't bow to him but
[1:56:11] [Music]
[1:56:13] all right go ahead and actually carry on
[1:56:15] for a little bit what you would do
[1:56:17] somebody would do this I guarantee you
[1:56:21] hmm
[1:56:32] [Music]
[1:56:35] we'd be hugging his neck we would be
[1:56:38] lined up
[1:56:42] okay thank you brother
[1:56:46] brother Brooks had more Liberty to help
[1:56:49] help with the drama here we might be
[1:56:50] dancing but we would be we would
[1:56:52] probably just be all just hanging on to
[1:56:55] him weeping and some of us been carrying
[1:56:57] burdens oh yeah
[1:57:01] there's something stacked up against us
[1:57:05] we thought about oh if I see you know if
[1:57:09] a mighty Prophet was here I would feel
[1:57:11] good but then if Jesus walked in I was
[1:57:13] just you owned them suddenly all those
[1:57:15] things you were you would just know
[1:57:18] you just know that it's okay okay
[1:57:22] and everybody would just
[1:57:25] I'm safe
[1:57:29] it's okay it's okay it's okay okay
[1:57:34] and I want to read
[1:57:36] something
[1:57:38] from John chapter 16.
[1:57:47] in this portion of scripture
[1:57:50] John 14 through 17.
[1:57:55] it's the it's the last sermon that Jesus
[1:57:58] gives to his disciples
[1:58:02] before he
[1:58:04] um is offered up for them
[1:58:07] it's before Gethsemane
[1:58:11] it's
[1:58:13] um after the what they call the Last
[1:58:15] Supper
[1:58:17] Judas is gone
[1:58:20] it's just him and his closest disciples
[1:58:24] and he begins to unfold
[1:58:27] what he's doing
[1:58:30] and he tells them he's leaving
[1:58:34] now you can imagine or if Jesus walked
[1:58:37] in the room
[1:58:39] and we just spent
[1:58:48] the disciples had spent three and a half
[1:58:50] years with him
[1:58:51] [Music]
[1:58:56] they had performed Miracles with him
[1:59:00] he took two fishes and Five Loaves
[1:59:06] and he didn't feed the people he gave it
[1:59:09] to them he gave it to them he gave it to
[1:59:12] them and he said if you feed the people
[1:59:15] and they went out and they fed the
[1:59:17] people they did that and and you know
[1:59:19] you can see how the the crowds responded
[1:59:22] when he did that they said this is the
[1:59:23] king they were going to make him a king
[1:59:25] he started preaching the truth to them
[1:59:31] but now it's just his disciples
[1:59:36] the plan to them
[1:59:39] and he's telling them I'm going away
[1:59:42] and you can imagine how they felt
[1:59:47] sorrow have filled your heart
[1:59:52] now remember what they had
[1:59:54] with him I agree all the time
[1:59:58] for three and a half years
[2:00:02] and he said because I said these things
[2:00:04] unto you yeah
[2:00:05] sorrow have filled your heart
[2:00:08] nevertheless
[2:00:10] nevertheless you know more I tell you
[2:00:12] the truth
[2:00:15] do you believe it
[2:00:17] it is expedient
[2:00:22] Expedia means better
[2:00:25] advantageous
[2:00:29] so there's what we think will be better
[2:00:33] and there's What God Says is better
[2:00:37] how many knows what God says is better
[2:00:40] it's better than what you think will be
[2:00:42] better and he said it's better that I go
[2:00:46] away it's better that I go away
[2:01:04] or even if Jesus would come here
[2:01:06] physically because he said himself
[2:01:10] it's better that I go away because if I
[2:01:14] go not away
[2:01:18] I will not leave you orphans
[2:01:21] he was talking about putting power in
[2:01:24] the church
[2:01:29] that could Advance towards the gates of
[2:01:31] hell thank you
[2:01:33] so we don't sing songs anymore
[2:01:35] oh the fort for I am coming
[2:01:39] a lot of people
[2:01:42] saying oh I can't wait till Jesus comes
[2:01:45] back and Rescues Me from this evil age
[2:01:51] but what he said
[2:01:54] is the life that I'm putting in my
[2:01:59] church
[2:02:01] will shine forth in this evil age to the
[2:02:06] point
[2:02:07] that all of the enemy's weapons
[2:02:14] there was crushed to Calvary we'll
[2:02:18] finally be put under the feet
[2:02:19] of the church
[2:02:22] of the church so we're talking about
[2:02:25] Victory
[2:02:26] we're talking about victory
[2:02:30] you know it doesn't matter how long
[2:02:32] we've been to church
[2:02:34] it doesn't matter how sincere we are
[2:02:38] and so
[2:02:40] the message of the Gospel tonight
[2:02:44] it's the same message that it's always
[2:02:46] been
[2:02:48] through all of the ages
[2:02:52] but there's something that happens at
[2:02:54] the last stage
[2:02:56] when we get in the time we're close to
[2:03:01] taking the last enemies
[2:03:03] and that's when the power is
[2:03:08] to Manifesto
[2:03:15] and you can know about it you
[2:03:19] can talk about it
[2:03:24] but talking about it and knowing about
[2:03:27] it
[2:03:28] it's not the same as having it
[2:03:32] and God wants you
[2:03:36] he sent me tonight
[2:03:39] to tell you that he wants every one of
[2:03:43] you to have boldness in the day of
[2:03:46] judgment where you can know from
[2:03:48] starting right now
[2:03:50] [Music]
[2:03:51] here it is our love made perfect
[2:03:55] [Music]
[2:03:57] chapter four we'll we'll read that
[2:04:08] that we may have boldness in the day of
[2:04:10] judgment
[2:04:12] because as he is
[2:04:14] so are we
[2:04:17] in this world
[2:04:20] once again
[2:04:26] what tenses is
[2:04:30] the one that was that is and that is to
[2:04:33] come
[2:04:35] when he's talking about you here
[2:04:38] he says as he is
[2:04:44] right so are
[2:05:15] a lot of people read this verse
[2:05:20] but they haven't read the whole text
[2:05:24] but read the whole text
[2:05:27] he's talking about going to Perfection
[2:05:32] from a place of security
[2:05:35] he doesn't say as he is
[2:05:38] so will we be in this world
[2:05:42] but he says as he is so are we in this
[2:05:46] world
[2:05:47] and you may be listening to this right
[2:05:50] now
[2:05:56] amen but God doesn't lie so it doesn't
[2:05:59] matter what we feel
[2:06:01] the angel came to Mary
[2:06:04] and he told her something to sounded
[2:06:06] ridiculous
[2:06:08] and she said how can this be how do you
[2:06:10] mean
[2:06:12] he said the Holy Ghost will under
[2:06:14] overshadows
[2:06:16] is it is
[2:06:18] Amen to the word of God Amen and so
[2:06:22] whether we understand it in our flesh
[2:06:25] it doesn't matter but there's something
[2:06:28] in our spirit when it says as he is so
[2:06:31] are we in my experiences yes yes yes
[2:06:35] so are we so I can be bold so I don't
[2:06:39] have to wait to get to the gate and
[2:06:41] wonder they all what's he going to say
[2:06:42] but I can be both I can be bold the
[2:06:46] boldness
[2:06:47] it's the starting point
[2:06:49] the foundation from
[2:07:06] he tells you from the day you were born
[2:07:09] again
[2:07:10] best
[2:07:11] [Music]
[2:07:29] [Music]
[2:07:33] same hungering and thirsting
[2:07:38] to hear it like the rest
[2:07:43] and when
[2:07:44] in scenes of Glory
[2:07:48] I sing the new new song it will be
[2:07:55] stand before the Thrones
[2:08:03] but it's a place of boldness
[2:08:06] it's a place of security security and
[2:08:10] when it says perfect love casts out all
[2:08:12] fears
[2:08:13] do you know what the fear is
[2:08:17] that God's Gonna damn you to hell
[2:08:22] in Romans 8 and 1.
[2:08:24] it says this is
[2:08:27] there is therefore
[2:08:31] now no no
[2:08:34] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[2:08:39] Jesus
[2:08:42] I don't know what it's like in French
[2:08:45] but in English when we hear the word
[2:08:48] condemnation
[2:08:49] we think it means feeling guilty
[2:08:54] but this word condemnation here
[2:08:58] comes from the Greek word katakrima
[2:09:07] and it means
[2:09:10] that the judgment is passed
[2:09:12] and the sentence is rendered
[2:09:18] and it literally means
[2:09:19] there is no damnation to hell
[2:09:23] if you're in Christ Jesus so you can see
[2:09:27] how you can grow from maturity because
[2:09:31] family
[2:09:38] he's put his life in you and that's the
[2:09:42] same life it brought him up from the
[2:09:44] grave
[2:09:57] and if you don't have it
[2:10:00] he wants you to have it today
[2:10:02] and he wants you to have it so bad
[2:10:06] amen that he despise the shame
[2:10:16] and for the joy
[2:10:19] as it says in Hebrews 12.
[2:10:23] that was set before him he endured the
[2:10:27] cross so that he could see his own life
[2:10:32] exploding explosions
[2:10:36] out of you I don't know all your names
[2:10:39] but God knows your name for you because
[2:10:42] he wants to see his life
[2:10:46] in there
[2:10:49] to take the gates of hell
[2:10:51] but he wants you to believe it that the
[2:10:55] devil can't get you out of his hands
[2:11:31] you don't have to worry that Satan's
[2:11:34] gonna pluck you out of his hands
[2:11:37] in John 14 when he said he was going to
[2:11:40] send the Holy Spirit
[2:11:43] he said I'll abide with you forever
[2:11:47] I'll never leave you nor forsake you
[2:11:50] didn't
[2:11:51] and the Epistle of Timothy is
[2:11:57] it says if we deny him
[2:12:02] when you're born again
[2:12:06] sometimes before
[2:12:09] you don't believe as you should
[2:12:12] but you never
[2:12:14] deny him
[2:12:19] you never deny him
[2:12:22] but it says
[2:12:25] if we believe not
[2:12:31] he
[2:12:34] abideth faithful
[2:12:36] how many has believed how they should
[2:12:41] neither one of us can put up our hands
[2:12:48] putting up the scripture
[2:12:51] you got it there okay if we believe not
[2:12:54] yet he abideth faithful
[2:13:16] [Applause]
[2:13:46] you can have a foundation tonight
[2:13:51] the devil's got nothing but bad news
[2:13:54] but the Gospel of Jesus Christ is
[2:13:58] nothing but good news
[2:14:00] if you're not saved
[2:14:04] the doors are open
[2:14:07] and if you are saved
[2:14:10] the holy spirit is open in our hearts
[2:14:12] right now
[2:14:15] things that belong to us
[2:14:24] and like I said about sincerity
[2:14:28] brother Branham said this absolutely
[2:14:32] like a doctor giving medicine
[2:14:36] he might give you or arsenic
[2:14:41] that's poison
[2:14:43] sincerely since salmon he might give you
[2:14:46] sulfuric acid
[2:14:48] you know
[2:15:10] and anything contrary to God's word
[2:15:14] I don't care what it is and how long
[2:15:17] it's been in existence
[2:15:21] and Peter give them an eternal
[2:15:23] prescription
[2:15:26] on the day of Pentecost he said repent
[2:15:30] and be baptized every one of you in the
[2:15:35] name of Jesus Christ
[2:15:36] for the remission of your sins
[2:15:38] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[2:15:42] Ghost
[2:15:43] for this prescription
[2:15:46] is to you and to your children
[2:15:59] it's an eternal prescription
[2:16:03] amen like we read in the Psalms
[2:16:06] if the foundation be destroyed the
[2:16:10] tweets what shall the righteous do just
[2:16:14] the devil the Diablo first of all is
[2:16:18] trying to make sure
[2:16:19] if you say the people in the church
[2:16:23] don't have any foundations
[2:16:26] and there's lots of it going on
[2:16:29] I don't have to point it out
[2:16:31] but I guarantee if you've been in church
[2:16:34] you know about it that everybody that's
[2:16:38] sitting in the church
[2:16:39] doesn't have the life of God
[2:16:42] but it's not because there's not life
[2:16:46] and sometimes that could be us
[2:16:51] not if we've been already born again
[2:16:55] but I was raised in church
[2:16:57] and for people raised in church
[2:17:01] it's really hard on our flesh
[2:17:05] and hard on our pride
[2:17:09] to go all these years
[2:17:12] and see something in the word
[2:17:15] and admit to ourselves
[2:17:18] that we don't got it
[2:17:21] and I'm not trying to talk anybody out
[2:17:23] of their faith
[2:17:26] but God's speaking the hearts
[2:17:30] and I know what he's doing
[2:17:34] not saying I'm telling God what he's
[2:17:36] doing
[2:17:37] but the word discerns and that's why I
[2:17:41] say that I know it is
[2:17:46] and if you've been born again
[2:17:50] he's anchoring you right now
[2:17:52] it's strengthening you
[2:17:54] but if you haven't been born again
[2:17:57] he's convicting you
[2:18:00] and he's telling you
[2:18:02] [Music]
[2:18:03] you don't have to go
[2:18:08] in your house
[2:18:10] that on the outside
[2:18:13] looks like everybody else is
[2:18:18] wondering
[2:18:20] if this next storm is
[2:18:25] going to take you out of
[2:18:30] because when the foundation is there a
[2:18:33] foundation
[2:18:37] you can stand you can have boldness in
[2:18:41] the day of judgment you can know that
[2:18:43] you have it right now
[2:18:44] from that point you can walk no and even
[2:18:48] if you mess up
[2:18:51] you're in him
[2:18:53] he's not going to leave
[2:18:55] the devil can't pluck you out
[2:18:58] you've got a new heart
[2:19:00] so you don't want to leave
[2:19:03] you mess up
[2:19:05] the devil's gonna accuse you see but
[2:19:09] there's a blood me on song that speaks
[2:19:12] better things than evil
[2:19:18] when King killed Abel
[2:19:22] God came
[2:19:24] to King
[2:19:26] and he said your brothers
[2:19:30] Christ to me
[2:19:36] do you know what it was crying for who
[2:19:38] says
[2:19:40] foreign
[2:20:04] [Music]
[2:20:10] Hallelujah
[2:20:50] amen
[2:20:52] so you say brother
[2:20:56] how do I get that boldness
[2:20:59] I was telling that story
[2:21:02] brother Brooks was preaching
[2:21:07] and it was a good sermon I couldn't
[2:21:10] quote it back to you
[2:21:12] but he was preaching the gospel of grace
[2:21:17] but my flesh myself
[2:21:20] and the religious things
[2:21:23] that I had picked up
[2:21:27] I hadn't learned
[2:21:28] to walk in grace
[2:21:31] to walk in Freedom
[2:21:33] to work
[2:21:37] so every time I messed up
[2:21:40] try to make it up to God
[2:21:44] and I'd ask him
[2:21:47] did I really get your Holy Ghost
[2:21:51] and I heard the Holy Ghost is free
[2:21:55] but the devil's a full-time liar
[2:21:59] how many of those thieves don't care
[2:22:02] about laws
[2:22:04] that's why they call them
[2:22:09] the devil was a thief from the beginning
[2:22:11] a lion from the beginning
[2:22:14] [Music]
[2:22:16] so do you think
[2:22:18] if you're born again
[2:22:21] he's not going to tell you that you're
[2:22:23] not even if he's not going to tell you
[2:22:25] that you're going to hell I'll tell you
[2:22:28] that every day in your life
[2:22:34] and the devil's beating her up
[2:22:38] and she asked for prayer
[2:22:41] in my my heart she was she was
[2:22:45] struggling
[2:22:46] and she told me the devil was beating
[2:22:48] her up yeah
[2:22:50] and you know he's telling her these lies
[2:22:54] and she wanted me to pray for her
[2:22:58] that he wouldn't do that anymore
[2:23:03] and I told her privately
[2:23:06] but I said sis I can't pray that for you
[2:23:12] and that's not exactly what I said I'm
[2:23:14] paraphrasing
[2:23:16] but he's a liar
[2:23:18] and he's always going to do that I will
[2:23:22] pray for you
[2:23:24] is that God shows you
[2:23:26] the freedom that you have in him the
[2:23:30] victory that you have in him
[2:23:33] so when he's lying to you
[2:23:37] can't stop you I like to say it this way
[2:23:44] I can't stop the devil from attacking me
[2:23:50] but he can't stop me from defeating him
[2:23:54] and you might say who do you think you
[2:23:56] are it's not who I think that I am is
[2:23:59] who God said that I am
[2:24:03] not Gabriel
[2:24:06] Jesus
[2:24:08] church
[2:24:12] will not Prevail against it
[2:24:15] so I know you should say that he can't
[2:24:18] stop me from beating him
[2:24:21] because that's what Jesus said and I
[2:24:25] believe it
[2:24:27] and so
[2:24:28] going back to that that sermon
[2:24:31] I would hear those from time to time
[2:24:37] and we hear lots of preaching
[2:24:40] from well-meaning ministers
[2:24:44] but I'll tell you this is
[2:24:50] the law made nothing perfect
[2:24:53] it's Hebrews 7 19 if you're bringing it
[2:24:56] up the law made nothing perfect it was
[2:24:58] said
[2:24:59] but to bring it in of a better hope did
[2:25:06] and they want to know why the law made
[2:25:09] nothing perfect
[2:25:13] because we can't keep it
[2:25:15] it wasn't a problem with the law this is
[2:25:18] a problem with us
[2:25:21] and that's why he had to give you his
[2:25:23] own life
[2:25:25] where he wanted to be
