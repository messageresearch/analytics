[5:32] amen because the prophet I believe in
[5:34] the message that one of the message of
[5:36] the Holy Ghost he says
[5:41] that in order for you to have the holy
[5:44] spirit
[5:45] amen you have to know what is the holy
[5:48] spirit
[5:50] why was he why is the Holy Spirit
[5:53] giveness
[5:54] and what the holy spirit will do when it
[5:57] comes in you
[6:07] amen the prophet says that it's the
[6:09] pillar of fire
[6:11] amen that was divided in different
[6:14] portions
[6:16] amen Jesus was made flesh Jesus Amen in
[6:20] the beginning was in the beginning was
[6:22] the word
[6:23] you know in order for God in order for
[6:26] God to create
[6:27] okay amen he had to condense himself to
[6:30] a form
[6:32] in a form that we call the logos
[6:36] amen and the prophet says that that love
[6:38] God is the same it's the pillar of fire
[6:43] it's a pillar of fire
[6:45] amen God created started to create with
[6:48] that form
[6:50] amen so you wanted to redeem us
[6:53] amen you wanted to become one of us
[6:57] so he couldn't die as a dude
[8:03] he said that this same one who was known
[8:07] as Jesus after the flesh went back to
[8:09] the pillar of Fire
[8:21] but he promised he will come again and
[8:25] dwell among his people by the spirit
[8:30] um
[8:33] and on the day of Pentecost that pill of
[8:36] fire came down and it separated itself
[8:40] in tongues of fire upon each one of them
[8:47] is
[8:52] it what was God doing
[8:55] amen he was separating himself into the
[8:59] church
[9:02] giving all those men and women a part of
[9:05] himself
[9:08] he divided himself amongst he divided
[9:12] himself amongst his church just as he
[9:15] said he was
[9:19] am I giving you and me a part of himself
[9:24] amen so that he can live inside of us
[9:27] so that we can never be comfortless
[9:32] we can always have the comforters
[9:37] will lead us in our truth
[9:42] tell us what to do
[9:45] you mean you will always tell us how to
[9:48] walk
[9:49] amen the prophet says here the prophet
[9:52] to do this in the questions and answers
[9:55] uh number two
[9:57] paragraph 107.
[9:59] [Music]
[10:00] so I said it says now
[10:04] he's comparing the pillow fire to the
[10:07] logos
[10:10] he says now that Pillar of Fire is
[10:14] the logos
[10:16] that went out of God
[10:19] the logos which is actually the
[10:23] attribute of the fullness of God
[10:28] Amen so if that logos is inside of you
[10:32] amen you have the attribute of the
[10:35] fullness of God
[10:39] Amen when God become into into a form to
[10:44] where it could be seen
[10:46] on a former
[10:50] it was the anointing of of the great
[10:53] spirit that went forth
[10:59] It's condescending
[11:02] coming down
[11:03] God the Father the logos that was up
[11:08] over Israel
[11:10] he was holy
[11:12] bear sin
[11:15] there had to be a blood offering right
[11:18] in Eden
[11:21] amen
[11:24] become flesh Among Us
[11:28] and where these logos dwelt in the human
[11:31] body
[11:34] which was the sacrifice
[11:36] when man was made in the image of God
[11:41] and then God came down in the image of
[11:44] men
[11:49] to redeem
[12:47] of the creation of the creator foreign
[13:50] same attributes
[13:54] Jesus Christ
[13:56] was able to create
[13:59] showing us that he also always you
[14:02] always have that that same attributes
[14:07] amen the prophecy that has come down
[14:15] different portions
[14:17] amen and dwells now inside of us
[14:21] amen having the same attributes he only
[14:24] remembers even having the same power
[14:27] that means that if if something is going
[14:30] wrong
[14:32] that spirit that is in you women is able
[14:36] to speak the word
[14:38] and the situation will change
[14:47] amen he needed he needed a a created a
[14:51] squirrel
[14:57] he stopped the snow and by the Tempest
[15:01] amen him and he gave a life to a little
[15:05] fish
[15:09] give love to that little boy who had an
[15:12] accident
[15:15] his body was all over the place
[15:35] amen that same quickening Powers
[15:43] it was the same thing with the disciples
[15:46] amen with the disciples
[15:50] foreign
[16:20] [Music]
[17:02] you'll be able able to speak the words
[17:05] and bring people back to life again
[17:09] because of that same Spirit
[17:12] if that spirit is
[17:15] jeans from the Dead images
[18:26] thousand people received the holy spirit
[18:29] amen 3 000 people were added to that
[18:32] first number
[18:35] and they went on they started speaking
[18:37] the words
[18:40] and we have the same word
[18:43] amen because Malachi said he meant that
[18:46] he will bring the the hearts of the
[18:48] children to the father
[18:51] bringing it back it may bring it back to
[18:55] that Pentacles
[18:57] let me bring it back to that first
[18:59] church
[19:13] because we have the fullness of the
[19:15] words
[19:16] we have received the fullness of the
[19:19] world
[19:20] the thing that Paul was longing foreign
[19:26] foreign
[20:26] man is the logos that created everything
[20:28] through logos the Bible says I think in
[20:32] Revelation chapter four
[20:34] because he said that he created
[20:36] everything for his pleasure it's exactly
[20:44] that was leading the children of Israel
[20:47] when danger were coming
[20:52] the Bible says that that pillow fire
[20:54] left from being before them
[20:58] and went in there
[21:00] it meant to protect them he meant to
[21:04] become their Shields
[21:11] don't be afraid that pillow fire will
[21:15] protect you
[21:19] know what David said even though I walk
[21:23] in the valley of darkness
[21:26] amen I wish I shall not fear because I
[21:30] know that God will always be with me
[21:32] because I know that God is inside of me
[21:35] so I will not fear
[21:43] Elijah
[21:45] amen and then he was he was raptured it
[21:47] was translated
[21:51] received the double portion of the same
[21:55] spirituality
[21:58] was one bird
[22:01] with two Wings
[22:03] amen representing the type of of of the
[22:06] sins that are alive in the sense that
[22:08] are asleep
[22:20] Elijah was translated
[22:22] [Music]
[22:24] Elijah was translated Transfiguration
[23:26] foreign
[23:59] [Music]
[24:07] [Music]
[24:48] he said that this is a dying spirit in a
[24:51] dying body
[24:54] um
[24:54] but now you can be in two bodies at the
[24:58] same time at one time
[25:01] but there can be two Natures in in you
[25:05] at one time
[25:09] now the nature
[25:11] of the spirit of the Lord
[25:14] when you're born again
[25:17] you're not born of of physical like a
[25:20] baby was like the baby was
[25:24] baby but what happened the spiritual
[25:28] Birth has come to you make this past
[25:33] and while the spiritual birth is growing
[25:36] into your heart
[25:42] into your heart
[25:44] amen there is a physical or a Celestial
[25:48] body growing to receive that Spirit yeah
[25:55] while this spiritual birth is growing
[25:58] into your heart
[26:02] there is also a physical body there's
[26:06] just a Celestial body
[26:08] amen that's growing
[26:11] receive their spirit
[26:15] amen he continues he said that and when
[26:17] the life leaves this body it is
[26:24] when the baby when the body is presented
[26:27] to the Earth
[26:30] the spirit comes in this is
[26:34] you know when the baby is inside of the
[26:37] womb that's gonna be big amen he doesn't
[26:40] have the breath of life yet
[26:42] the prophet says that it's only muscles
[26:44] that's a stretching the prophet is a
[26:46] song Amen but when that baby amen comes
[26:49] out
[26:50] the spirit will automatically come in
[26:54] so it's the same thing with us
[27:02] just Justice when the body is presented
[27:05] to the Earth it it comes
[27:09] the spirit comes in this is and when the
[27:13] spirit goes out of the body
[27:18] for we know that after this Earthly
[27:21] Tabernacle with the soul
[27:26] we have one already waiting
[27:30] I mean it's already there
[27:33] that's it that's the spiritual body of
[27:36] the People sisters
[27:42] amen the prophet says that it's already
[27:44] there
[27:45] and he says that that's where you get
[27:47] your power from it is
[27:51] not charging a battery
[27:53] even when you feel weak yeah you get the
[27:58] power from their body
[28:04] that's already there
[28:06] man it's waiting foreign
[28:15] is the earnest of that change that's
[28:17] coming see look look guys

[30:37] it's God's word made manifest in the
[30:42] manifested it isn't the man it's
[30:45] a man that's died
[30:48] it can be a hybrid in the sun it is
[30:59] amen he has either to be a son of of
[31:02] death or a son of life
[31:06] so if he's the son of death
[31:11] I give it over to God oh
[31:16] give it over to God
[31:19] and let him kill the devil that's in you
[31:24] run him out
