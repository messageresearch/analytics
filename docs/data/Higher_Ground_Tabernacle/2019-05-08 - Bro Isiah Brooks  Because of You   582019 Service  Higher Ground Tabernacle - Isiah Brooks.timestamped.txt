[27:15] [Music]
[27:16] he came back I started my message
[27:31] planned out and I did something I don't
[27:35] know but Jesus is the first chapter
[28:02] we're going to read the 26th and the
[28:05] 27th first Genesis 26 I'm sorry Genesis
[28:09] 1:26 Jews is one trustus is such a Bible
[28:28] thing for us today we find ourselves
[28:31] battling and garden things but we
[28:36] Genesis 1:26 to the 27th verse and image
[28:44] after our likeness and let them have
[28:47] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[28:49] over the fowl of the air and over every
[28:54] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[28:56] earth so God created man in his own
[28:59] image and in his image of God's maybe
[29:02] male and female created he them and God
[29:06] bless
[29:07] and God said to them be fruitful and
[29:08] multiply and replenish the earth and
[29:11] subdue it and have dominion over the
[29:13] fish of the sea and over the fowl of the
[29:15] air and over every living thing that
[29:18] moveth upon the earth one more scripture
[29:23] we go to revelation 7:3 revelation 7 we
[29:31] read the first verse 1 through 4 and
[29:37] these things are holding the four winds
[29:43] of the earth that the wind should not
[29:46] blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on
[29:49] any tree and I saw another angel
[29:52] ascending from the east having the seal
[29:55] of the Living God and he cried with a
[29:58] loud voice to the four angels to whom it
[30:00] was given to her the earth and the sea
[30:03] saying hurt not the earth neither the
[30:05] sea nor the trees till we have sealed
[30:07] the surgery
[30:11] the number of bill which were sealed and
[30:14] there were sealed 144,000 of all the
[30:18] tribes of the children of Israel let us
[30:21] pray father God we come before you Lord
[30:23] we thank you for your grace and your
[30:25] mercy we thank you for keeping us and
[30:27] guiding us and strengthening us we thank
[30:30] you for this wonderful day that you have
[30:31] given to us father if there be anything
[30:33] we have said and done the Lord is not
[30:36] even in that side forgive us Lord
[30:38] cleanse us from all unrighteousness and
[30:40] father will be coming to give you the
[30:42] praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's
[30:44] name we pray you may be seated
[30:47] I like to entitle this message because
[30:50] of you coming from the message amen
[30:55] adoption for the velum sinners God
[31:00] before the foundation of the world as we
[31:05] took him down through the lessons young
[31:08] people how we seen God was self existent
[31:11] how that India was loved and him was to
[31:14] be God there
[31:19] he was by himself nothing if God is not
[32:02] saying to preach the gospel I have an
[32:12] inheritance and inheritance of eternal
[32:14] life that God's it to make Jesus give me
[32:18] God sent Jesus to make that inheritance
[32:21] real to me because there was nothing I
[32:24] could do God just all the time
[32:36] Jesus the Lamb to be well what
[32:47] inheritance the sonship to be a son of
[32:50] God no I'm just saying this now because
[32:53] you remember I just ministered on
[33:03] because he is the creator
[33:08] [Music]
[33:39] and now this may just choke you to death
[33:43] but did you know that me then are sons
[33:47] of God are amateur gods and how many
[33:49] ever know that how many know Jesus
[33:52] saying the Bible said Jesus said did not
[33:55] your law say itself that you are God's
[33:58] you called them God's because they were
[34:05] [Music]
[34:18] he he he we are when the up to the top
[34:45] [Music]
[35:00] of God that is true that was the son of
[35:03] God then he made man that little God he
[35:06] said if they call those the Word of God
[35:09] came to the prophets if they called them
[35:11] gods who the Word of God came to and God
[35:15] said to himself that they were gods he
[35:18] told Moses
[35:19] I'll make you a god and make Aaron
[35:29] [Music]
[35:39] [Music]
[35:41] he he he said he said you can have is
[36:23] because okay
[37:00] [Music]
[37:23] [Music]
[38:13] [Music]
[38:25] [Music]
[38:53] [Music]

[43:09] [Music]
[43:44] [Music]
[44:36] [Applause]
[45:29] Jesus was a man and he agreed to God he
[45:34] agreed to be sacrificed because we're
[46:26] living in the worst of all
[46:38] but by my spirit saith the Lord is that
[46:42] right is that right Roma zation who what
[46:47] who shall separate me from the love of
[46:50] God who that can separate you from the
[46:55] love of God why because God shield you
[46:59] as a prophet of God said before the
[47:01] foundation of the world he called you he
[47:04] liked you he sealed you hallelujah and
[47:07] he wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of
[47:09] Life be encouraged tonight everything
[47:14] you going through will work for your
[47:15] good that rie the Bible says so but the
[47:20] donors he doesn't want us to really
[47:25] think about God and what he's done for
[47:27] us why because he realized if we really
[47:30] consider and meditate with God like God
[47:32] has done for us he's a he's a he's a
[47:35] sick folk a dead dead dead devil that's
[47:43] right he has no power over us none
[47:46] whatsoever
[47:49] and why is because God held up before
[47:55] wins for you brother Bela means besides
[48:00] the servants but I want to say let's
[48:02] look me in between before the servants
[48:05] come there's a mighty drama that's going
[48:08] on now the Jews know nothing about it
[48:12] hallelujah but there's a choosing of a
[48:15] bride hallelujah you said what do you
[48:20] mean brothers let's go on you know what
[48:23] what what God's ways of past finding out
[48:26] is that right if I said who's gonna give
[48:28] him counsel his easiest his ways is way
[48:32] before far above whatever we can think
[48:34] of look what God did he gives a boy by
[48:39] the name of Joseph dreams hallelujah and
[48:42] Joseph is a prophet and he gets to dream
[48:46] these dreams and he begins to tell his
[48:48] brothers about these dreams why God
[48:51] what the soin type what the future hold
[48:55] what the future would hold for the true
[48:57] believer is that right oh yes he goes on
[49:02] and he's working with Israel now and he
[49:04] shows and then the Joseph who
[49:06] represented Jesus Christ is that right
[49:09] he was a Charlaine type of Jesus Christ
[49:11] and we find out that God comes alone
[49:13] through Joseph and Joseph is mistreated
[49:18] hello you say what do you mean that
[49:22] spirit came in our day brother also had
[49:26] the spirit of Joseph the ministry that
[49:31] Joseph Amon was able to go into
[49:33] Pharaoh's Kingdom and become the second
[49:36] man in other words he came into a place
[49:38] it meant that he stored the food for
[49:41] time of famine did not the prophet of
[49:44] God preached messages so that they would
[49:47] be restored in book form on take fall
[49:51] hallelujah because he knew that was
[49:53] coming a famine in the night and even
[49:59] Pharaohs people went down to detention
[50:02] to the granary to use some of the the
[50:05] food that jaws of Cristal story that's
[50:09] what the preachers are doing the day
[50:10] they are taking some of the food that
[50:13] Joseph's stories start up preaching it
[50:17] when not telling anybody where they're
[50:19] getting it from hallelujah come on
[50:23] somebody
[50:23] but look like God knew that Joseph was
[50:27] going to go through these things because
[50:30] he understood that Jesus Christ had to
[50:32] go through the same thing jaws were jet
[50:35] rejected of his brothers Jesus rejected
[50:38] of his brothers Pharisees Sadducees
[50:41] whatever they didn't like him is that
[50:44] right amen and Joseph was thrown into
[50:49] the ditch
[50:49] Jesus was thrown into the grave
[50:52] hallelujah
[50:53] but he was resurrected is that right and
[50:57] when he was resurrected where did he was
[50:59] resurrected to he was resurrected aiming
[51:02] to the right hand of
[51:03] father and with jaws it was resurrected
[51:05] where was he resurrected on the right
[51:08] hand of Pharaoh so you and I must
[51:11] understand this was done and look God
[51:18] allowed his brethren to mistreat him and
[51:22] to betray him hallelujah
[51:25] is that right and when Joseph was ready
[51:29] to present himself
[51:30] Oh somebody help me the Bible said it
[51:33] again - he wanted to present himself to
[51:36] his brethren he dismissed his wife which
[51:40] is the Gentile bride which means she was
[51:42] raptured before Joseph identify himself
[51:46] to the Jews somebody help me now watch
[51:51] this you're not we know these things but
[51:54] Charles who says to his brothers because
[51:56] they were afraid once they did see him
[51:59] they were afraid that Joseph was going
[52:02] to kill him and so when Jesus revealed
[52:05] himself through Moses and Elijah the
[52:08] Jews will think that God has come to
[52:12] kill them and they said well where did
[52:16] we get though where did you get those
[52:17] scars did you say to Jesus where did you
[52:20] get those scars he said in the house of
[52:22] my friends it would be then the Jews are
[52:25] recognized then they crucified the
[52:27] Messiah now what all of this was done
[52:30] for what to preserve chosen said listen
[52:36] don't be mad with yourself God did this
[52:40] he worked a wonder on the devil he was
[52:46] the one - oh the devil somebody help me
[52:51] here and he dug jaws up
[52:54] he took Benjamin and put them right in
[52:57] on the devil's territory hallelujah and
[53:00] time went on and through that line guess
[53:05] what God brings the deliverer Moses
[53:10] raised up in Pharaoh's house Pharaoh's
[53:14] daughter fed him taught him
[53:16] all these things hallelujah you
[53:19] understand me all these things were done
[53:22] that the Jews would be alive today
[53:30] you see Jesus does things in such a way
[53:34] that it we can't comprehend it you know
[53:37] I think sometime he does it in the way
[53:39] he does it because sometimes we don't
[53:40] have control of our lips we talk too
[53:43] much so it keeps us in a wonder you give
[53:49] the plan away hallelujah
[53:51] so he keeps us in that thing says trust
[53:54] me I'm the leader here you the Lambs
[53:58] you just trust me I'm doing everything
[54:00] everything that I'm doing right now is
[54:03] for you whew
[54:06] hard times I'm gonna trust you that's
[54:10] what Paul said he said I've learned it
[54:13] meant to be obeys I've learned a mentor
[54:16] to keep myself to keep my job to be
[54:19] happy in every situation he didn't say
[54:23] it automatically came he said I have
[54:25] learned and every trial and test we go
[54:28] through is a learning experience and
[54:30] that experience is to bring us to a
[54:32] greater trust in God all for you is that
[54:38] all right now you you let's turn the
[54:41] Romans quickly I quote it a little bit
[54:44] but let's turn turn there you love the
[54:47] Lord my voice had not even been horse
[54:51] all day somebody gonna be a blessed
[54:55] somebody's being blessed he's gonna come
[55:01] and take my voice and everything but
[55:03] it's alright because I realize one thing
[55:08] no weapon formed against us can prosper
[55:13] none I don't care what it looks like it
[55:17] might look Oh sometimes the devil comes
[55:19] and his financial problems seem to be
[55:21] overwhelming don't let it all the way of
[55:24] you stand still trust God and here
[55:28] divided up for you he will he'll open
[55:32] that she and you say oh my god I'm in
[55:34] the promised land now you understand me
[55:38] it's not that God is not Brian he like
[55:41] he's blind he doesn't know your
[55:42] financial needs God knows them and he's
[55:46] easier if he supplied the needs for the
[55:49] his disciples go find the fish
[55:52] catch one and the first fish you catch
[55:55] your taxes and everything isn't gonna be
[55:58] in there enough for me y'all understand
[56:03] me that's the God we serve but he puts
[56:06] us in tests see to see if we really
[56:09] trust him and depend on him absolutely
[56:14] some of these things are uncomfortable
[56:17] to the flesh but you know what when you
[56:20] die and you die to yourself and live
[56:23] unto Him
[56:24] you can always say like Paul I glory in
[56:27] everything Paul said I don't care what
[56:31] come my way I'm going I'm glory I might
[56:34] look a little crazy but I'm gonna grow
[56:36] if I got what I'm gonna glow if I God
[56:41] rollers ain't pleased you love the Lord
[56:49] you know God is God is so good to us
[56:52] let's start by God's grace at the
[57:03] they started to do that alright so you
[57:14] call I want you to understand ain't no
[57:15] demon I don't care what you've done when
[57:17] you are under the blood you you're free
[57:21] you absolutely you know people are
[57:23] afraid of that because the devil always
[57:25] showing us our flesh you know showing us
[57:28] our failures but you know you make
[57:31] mistakes sometimes we do but God says
[57:34] gonna lay in the charge today y'all
[57:36] understand me
[57:37] either you're free I don't care oh I
[57:40] remember you don't it doesn't make any
[57:41] difference to me whether you remember my
[57:44] failures are not in the eyes of God I
[57:46] could never be a failure you hear what
[57:50] I'm saying
[57:51] in the eyes of God you can never be a
[57:53] failure because the Bible said who God
[57:56] justified he also glorified
[58:01] hello he didn't even say sanctified he
[58:04] said glorified he justified you did he
[58:07] glorifies you cuz he know you will be
[58:09] sanctified and filled that goes to be in
[58:13] on the Alpha and the Omega so you and I
[58:17] must understand by God's grace and then
[58:19] what God has done
[58:21] what for you you know Satan so mad at
[58:24] you Satan is really upset he made one
[58:28] mistake and he got kicked out of heaven
[58:31] the hummers mistakes you've made huh and
[58:36] God said but see this is my son this is
[58:39] my daughter who's going to lead the
[58:42] charge to them because Satan if it
[58:44] wasn't for you they would have never
[58:46] made us mistake is that right brother
[58:49] BAM said all our sins go back to the
[58:51] accuser Oh somebody help me here Oh
[58:56] everything I ever done the devil is in
[58:59] trouble understand me I'm not in trouble
[59:05] here who shall lay anything to the
[59:11] charge of God's elect it is God that
[59:15] justifies
[59:16] who is he that condemneth it is Christ
[59:19] that died yea rather that is risen again
[59:23] who's given you is even at the right
[59:26] hand of God who also maketh intercession
[59:28] for us now watch this now jesus prayed
[59:32] in the seventeenth chapter of Saint John
[59:34] he's his father I would they be one even
[59:36] as we are one now understand Jesus
[59:39] prayers can never go back come back void
[59:42] it's a certainty whatever he has he said
[59:46] father I know that you always here with
[59:48] me did he say that at the tomb of
[59:52] Lazarus as lord I know you hears me now
[59:54] I'm praying not for me but for their
[59:57] sake hallelujah so even now he's praying
[1:00:01] for our saying that we would know he's
[1:00:05] already praying for us and so therefore
[1:00:08] we've already overcome by his plan I
[1:00:11] didn't say your prayers by his prayer
[1:00:16] because you're not I read that quote
[1:00:18] last week whenever you pray in the name
[1:00:21] of Jesus Christ it is no longer your
[1:00:24] prayer it is transferred over to Jesus
[1:00:27] and it's like Jesus praying for you and
[1:00:30] he answers his own prayer God answers
[1:00:34] his own prayer but he prays to you when
[1:00:37] you say in the name of Jesus is no
[1:00:40] longer your prayer is his prayer and God
[1:00:43] answers those prayers somebody help me
[1:00:47] here remember that now when you sign it
[1:00:50] in the name of that right that's the
[1:00:53] check that he gave you so therefore when
[1:00:56] you sign it it has to be cashed because
[1:00:59] it has the right name on it and that's
[1:01:02] Jesus Christ all you got to do is wait
[1:01:06] our biggest problem is just waiting
[1:01:09] trusting is that right you get in
[1:01:13] trouble not you know you get in trouble
[1:01:15] by not trusting like so when Sam you
[1:01:19] said I'll be back you wait till I get
[1:01:21] back so right and the pews come on come
[1:01:25] on we need to do the sacrifice we need
[1:01:27] to do the sacrifice
[1:01:30] Sam he coming back he ain't coming y'all
[1:01:34] know him second and they you know people
[1:01:36] will get you into a bad situation if you
[1:01:40] listen to people that put an anxiety on
[1:01:43] you is that right oh it's the truth
[1:01:47] these people call you oh this kind of
[1:01:49] money and if you don't pay I'm like
[1:01:50] forget it my god it controls you my god
[1:01:58] controls you that's right am I in the
[1:02:04] right line when here at told Jesus don't
[1:02:07] you know I can take your love easy you
[1:02:09] can't take my life you don't even have
[1:02:11] any power and the power that you give I
[1:02:13] have is what my God has given you
[1:02:16] no police and nobody else got power God
[1:02:20] has the power and if God willing to see
[1:02:22] me go through something he gave you that
[1:02:24] so I can go through something otherwise
[1:02:27] you just you're just wasting your time
[1:02:34] now is that right it's the truth you
[1:02:37] know that just like I gave that
[1:02:39] testimony of our sister when the doctor
[1:02:42] says uh you know you notice this cancer
[1:02:45] whatever she has say you don't have long
[1:02:47] to live and you're gonna die and she
[1:02:49] said did Jesus tell you that oh really
[1:02:54] what doctor can tell you when you go die
[1:02:58] he's looking at science and we're
[1:03:01] looking at faith we've got a promise if
[1:03:06] we accept his diagnosis you gonna die
[1:03:08] but if you accept what Jesus says
[1:03:11] hallelujah you go on with your life
[1:03:15] is that right Oh somebody help me here
[1:03:20] mr. truth he goes and who shall separate
[1:03:24] us from the love of Christ shall
[1:03:26] tribulation or distress or persecution
[1:03:28] or famine or Nick nurse of pearls or
[1:03:31] sword as it is written for thy sake we
[1:03:35] are killed all the day long we are
[1:03:37] accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay
[1:03:40] and all things we are more than
[1:03:42] conquerors through him that
[1:03:43] thus for I am persuaded that neither
[1:03:47] death now you come on now I'm persuaded
[1:03:52] that means there's no space no room for
[1:03:54] doubt I'm feeling up with persuasion
[1:03:59] well somebody helped me here cuz you and
[1:04:03] I must understand Pauline this is north
[1:04:05] he's literally telling you something
[1:04:08] these words they're not just for him
[1:04:11] it's for you and me that's Christ
[1:04:13] preaching or speaking to the Prophet
[1:04:17] right Paul yeah it is written for thy
[1:04:22] sake we are killed all the day long as
[1:04:24] we are counted as sheep for the
[1:04:25] slaughter nay in all of these things we
[1:04:28] are more than what conquerors through
[1:04:30] him that loved us women conquerors to
[1:04:34] you know through him you gotta believe
[1:04:40] God your father if you believe God is
[1:04:41] your father you can get some things done
[1:04:44] but if there's just an inkling of a
[1:04:46] doubt it won't work faith is pure faith
[1:04:53] cannot be happy without it is so pure it
[1:04:57] becomes so real to you
[1:04:59] you can't even explain it it's true just
[1:05:04] a little bit of doubt message the whole
[1:05:06] program up is that right listen here
[1:05:09] Jesus trying to teach his disciples that
[1:05:11] they came from him cuz he had already
[1:05:14] told him I knew you and you were with me
[1:05:17] before the foundation of the world but
[1:05:19] now we're in this dimension I'm gonna
[1:05:21] teach you how to be gods
[1:05:23] whatsoever you say and believing it is
[1:05:27] yours if you say to this mountain is
[1:05:30] yours you saw how I cursed that tree is
[1:05:33] yours by the spoken word hallelujah you
[1:05:38] saw how I created the bread I did that
[1:05:41] for you so that you can see by faith you
[1:05:44] can do the same thing
[1:05:45] why because I called you brethren and
[1:05:48] when I call you brethren that means you
[1:05:50] are made of the same material we came
[1:05:52] from the same parent hallelujah
[1:05:55] and you can do the same thing is that
[1:05:57] right
[1:05:58] he said these signs shall follow them
[1:06:00] that believe in my name that cast out
[1:06:03] Devils that's right there trailed upon
[1:06:07] serpents if they should dare drink any
[1:06:09] deadly thing he said it shall not harm
[1:06:11] them is that the way Paul knows about it
[1:06:16] when that serpent bit Paul Paul remember
[1:06:18] the word that he had yeah he shook the
[1:06:21] shepherd in the fire and guess what all
[1:06:24] those who saw says we have a God you
[1:06:30] understand me
[1:06:31] that's the kind of life we are to live
[1:06:34] everybody looking at William Branham
[1:06:37] William Branham came to us and Jesus
[1:06:40] Christ through him showed us what kind
[1:06:43] of people we ought to be it wasn't just
[1:06:47] for the one man he was the beginning of
[1:06:50] this somebody help me here and we are
[1:06:55] here and listen let me tell you
[1:06:57] something until we come to a place where
[1:06:58] we can love him like the Prophet loved
[1:07:00] him he surrendered everything and you'll
[1:07:06] never see God in the way that you want
[1:07:08] to see God until you surrender
[1:07:09] everything an empty shell
[1:07:13] you must surrender to God you must love
[1:07:17] him that that is that that is a
[1:07:19] propelling force or you know that that's
[1:07:21] the force that drives you to surrender
[1:07:26] is your love for him hmm
[1:07:31] somebody help me here y'all understand
[1:07:34] me brother Ben didn't come here to
[1:07:36] establish another Church God didn't send
[1:07:39] him to here for that it was to produce a
[1:07:42] bride
[1:07:43] one day when Adam woke up and saw Eve
[1:07:46] she was born of his bone and flesh of
[1:07:48] his flesh before she fell she was just
[1:07:52] like him and you and I must be just like
[1:07:55] Christ
[1:07:56] this ain't no religion y'all understand
[1:07:58] me it's this is life
[1:08:02] or death life or death and that's why
[1:08:05] the Prophet God even preached the mark
[1:08:07] of the beast that's why I got the
[1:08:08] scripture revelation 7 he preaches the
[1:08:11] mark of the beast you go to either get
[1:08:12] the mark of the beast or you go to get
[1:08:14] the mark of Christ which is your sealing
[1:08:16] of the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy
[1:08:19] Ghost he says hmm is this ok so you and
[1:08:25] I must understand preachers are
[1:08:27] preaching everything but that I remember
[1:08:31] I told you and Peter last week Paul says
[1:08:33] keep this in remembrance don't you
[1:08:35] forget this right he says add to your
[1:08:38] faith virtue of knowledge temple ease
[1:08:40] they go all the way up he said if you
[1:08:42] want perfection this is it because this
[1:08:44] is the divine nature of God is that
[1:08:47] right and the Prophet God says listen
[1:08:49] every virtue is a victory
[1:08:51] you just God don't just pull you through
[1:08:53] I'll pull you up I'll pull you out
[1:08:55] you've got to press into the kingdom
[1:08:57] it is a press it is a dying out and
[1:09:01] that's why we don't see the power of God
[1:09:04] because people don't want to die out we
[1:09:07] stop we stop somewhere some of us don't
[1:09:10] have the tempers that we should have
[1:09:12] some of us don't have the godliness that
[1:09:14] we should have but you've got God that
[1:09:17] little sheet has been quickened but you
[1:09:19] got to mature and nobody's highly
[1:09:22] preaching it anymore why because we can
[1:09:25] believe that God can open the blinded
[1:09:26] eyes we can believe that God can raise
[1:09:29] the day we can believe that God can heal
[1:09:31] the crippled but we're having problems
[1:09:34] believing that God can change your
[1:09:37] character we've been so long the way we
[1:09:41] are we find it so difficult to really
[1:09:44] believe that God can change me
[1:09:47] hallelujah if he can change your woman
[1:09:50] that was a prostitute on the other side
[1:09:53] of the blood changed her hallelujah and
[1:09:58] over the branagh yes he did that but
[1:10:01] look at the people he changed he said
[1:10:06] what I don't know who Stephen was before
[1:10:09] he got saved but I know one thing when
[1:10:11] he died he died with a testimony then
[1:10:14] he had the Christ on the inside so much
[1:10:17] so his face was transformed and
[1:10:20] illuminated like an angel that's the
[1:10:23] only ghost I'm talking about
[1:10:26] there ain't no religion and the devil
[1:10:30] you know that's what is it his business
[1:10:31] his he wants us to be so busy and we all
[1:10:36] are
[1:10:37] anybody in here is not busy we're busy
[1:10:40] with something right but you see the
[1:10:44] thing the devil doesn't understand is
[1:10:45] that the word is going out and it can't
[1:10:49] come back boy hallelujah you see he gets
[1:10:55] us thinking Oh Lord oh Lord now you
[1:10:57] understand what I'm saying about virtue
[1:10:58] see because you can't establish that the
[1:11:02] only thing you can do is ask for it and
[1:11:04] he said you have not because you ask not
[1:11:06] if you don't pray and ask for these
[1:11:08] things on a daily basis you see them
[1:11:10] saying you got the call we've come
[1:11:12] before God says Lord I want to be a door
[1:11:15] out adorned because the garment in which
[1:11:19] we are to be adorned is this which is
[1:11:21] the divine nature of God hallelujah
[1:11:24] religion is everywhere that's why
[1:11:28] preachers fighting one another they need
[1:11:31] it it's the truth you know you find
[1:11:37] brothers breaking churches up is that
[1:11:41] right do say they had the appearance of
[1:11:44] a brother they look like a brother
[1:11:47] because they were not a real brother
[1:11:52] we'll never break up a church Lucifer
[1:11:56] was the first breaker upper you
[1:12:01] understand me so you and I must realize
[1:12:04] amen that when it comes him into the
[1:12:06] guard take to the Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:12:08] are all about unity o Peter denied him
[1:12:16] she said leave him he couldn't let you
[1:12:18] just take her you know he denied me
[1:12:20] three times
[1:12:21] hidden Oh Peter Peter denied leave him
[1:12:25] tell me what he said he said no
[1:12:28] Oh Peters a part of this body when I
[1:12:31] broke the bread I gave him a piece to
[1:12:34] show him where I came from
[1:12:36] where he was and where he came from I'm
[1:12:39] the bread of life I gave him a piece of
[1:12:41] me
[1:12:42] yah ha ha ha hallelujah so you can
[1:12:45] understand why would he said no we need
[1:12:47] Peter Oh Thomas how can you doubt me he
[1:12:57] didn't say that did he
[1:12:59] no he said Thomas here
[1:13:02] you want the evidence I'm gonna give you
[1:13:05] I'm gonna give you that's what he said
[1:13:06] Thomas said I need some evidence now if
[1:13:09] you are believer and you're like Thomas
[1:13:12] say God I want some evidence God will
[1:13:14] give you evidence is that right remember
[1:13:18] the lady
[1:13:19] amen brother Brown said she had the Holy
[1:13:21] Ghost but she couldn't believe it
[1:13:22] because she did not hadn't had never
[1:13:24] spoken in tongues and the probably God
[1:13:26] says Lord bless her that she could speak
[1:13:28] in tongues
[1:13:29] he didn't criticize her let us see if
[1:13:32] that's gonna seal it for her give it to
[1:13:35] her sometimes people need evidence and
[1:13:40] God didn't say Thomas you're not a part
[1:13:42] of me all these said was blessed is the
[1:13:45] man who believed who and have not seen
[1:13:47] say Thomas you believe because you saw
[1:13:49] right listen what I'm trying to say it's
[1:13:52] all done all the Scriptures laid out
[1:13:55] there for you and me so we can look in
[1:13:57] this and hey somebody was like me I'm
[1:14:00] having the same struggle here Lord of
[1:14:02] you did it with them you can do it for
[1:14:03] me it's in there huh so you what you
[1:14:10] saying brother which I'm saying the love
[1:14:11] of God he is so powerful you saw I know
[1:14:14] what I'm talking about because I see God
[1:14:17] changing me from glory to glory I see it
[1:14:22] and the thing about it is when you crowd
[1:14:25] the God lonely not God will answer I'm a
[1:14:30] clothes a little bit lemony he said I'm
[1:14:32] saying but it's ok
[1:14:37] the book is inside
[1:14:39] so you and I must understand listen
[1:14:42] pulses nothing nothing nothing should
[1:14:44] separate did I tell you about that that
[1:14:48] testimony I had it got quickly to me one
[1:14:50] time years ago I was coming to church
[1:14:52] and this person was driving me driving
[1:14:55] me right there all 486 that exit coming
[1:14:57] up on 86 from 80 or 35 where that is
[1:15:00] you know about by the coffee shop and
[1:15:08] anyhow if the lady that the man was
[1:15:12] driving him like no no no I'm gonna
[1:15:15] speed through that light and just the
[1:15:18] shoes I stopped cuz I was thinking I was
[1:15:21] having a battle am I gonna let him push
[1:15:23] me out the way what I'm gonna do and
[1:15:25] just as sure as I stopped a car went he
[1:15:31] would have told me up and no doubt I
[1:15:33] would have been dead you know what the
[1:15:35] man in the back of me did he ain't stop
[1:15:40] to say I'm sorry he just threw up his
[1:15:42] hands you hear what I'm saying
[1:15:47] who did that God stopped me from going
[1:15:51] forward you understand me
[1:15:54] y'all got to understand everything every
[1:15:56] little thing that happens to you it's
[1:15:58] ordained by God but somebody mistreat
[1:16:03] you don't get mad at them God told him
[1:16:06] to do it that's what David did so don't
[1:16:11] get mad with him God told him do that is
[1:16:15] that right he's all what do you mean
[1:16:18] brother you know sometimes we feel like
[1:16:20] we're overwhelmed with the days of the
[1:16:21] day but I understand every little thing
[1:16:24] that comes your way has already been
[1:16:26] placed
[1:16:27] put in place for you and guess what you
[1:16:31] are to conquer it you must conquer it
[1:16:35] that's why he's testing you so you can
[1:16:38] conquer it right you're gonna either
[1:16:41] concrete with patience or knowledge or
[1:16:43] temperance or godliness you gonna
[1:16:45] conquer whatever it is that virtue of
[1:16:47] God is there to be seen Oh somebody help
[1:16:52] me here
[1:16:52] I'm almost done
[1:16:54] but my point is when I think that God
[1:16:58] held up everything now you think about I
[1:17:02] love this little portion of the
[1:17:03] scripture where God made Israel wander
[1:17:08] in the wilderness for 40 years that gets
[1:17:12] me because had they come like brother
[1:17:16] Brown said they could have crossed over
[1:17:17] in seven days
[1:17:18] Rahab would have been a child hello
[1:17:24] you know she was no old woman out there
[1:17:26] and she got married to a well a captain
[1:17:32] so she must have been a beautiful lady
[1:17:34] you understand me
[1:17:36] so God did all of that he held it up you
[1:17:44] understand me there you go brother
[1:17:46] this rapture could have taken place in
[1:17:49] the time of William Branham they were
[1:17:52] ready those people was riding there with
[1:17:54] Elijah they believe they followed him it
[1:18:02] could have happened
[1:18:03] but there in the book in heaven there
[1:18:07] were names that had not yet come to
[1:18:11] manifestation yet
[1:18:12] and God has held this thing up for you
[1:18:16] and me all for you and me you understand
[1:18:21] me so we should be diligent as much as
[1:18:26] possible to make house come up how can I
[1:18:30] say diligent to his word as much as
[1:18:33] possible so that God can bring us to
[1:18:35] perfection not only that but we must ask
[1:18:39] God give us a spirit of I could say like
[1:18:47] Ezekiel a burden for the souls of people
[1:18:52] because he said he's this angel will
[1:18:54] only seal those who saw and cry because
[1:18:59] of the abomination that is done in the
[1:19:01] city you understand me what city
[1:19:06] come on Jerusalem he was talking about
[1:19:10] Jerusalem in other words bring it back
[1:19:13] your plain language the abomination is
[1:19:15] done in this message among your people
[1:19:20] the world is dead
[1:19:22] they already counted out right remember
[1:19:26] I told you as long as the church was in
[1:19:28] order the death angels wouldn't come in
[1:19:35] Ezekiel says Lord but where do you start
[1:19:37] he's a star at the house start at the
[1:19:41] church start with the elders and go all
[1:19:45] the way down don't even spare the
[1:19:46] children but as lower they wear the salt
[1:19:49] of the earth is stayed God's wrath hmm
[1:19:54] and that's everywhere if you want to see
[1:19:57] Des Moines continue to prosper as long
[1:20:01] as we keep ourselves as the salt of the
[1:20:04] earth God would bless them in order to
[1:20:06] bless us but when we go bad everything
[1:20:12] go bad y'all understand that's how God
[1:20:15] is always work he told Israel you were
[1:20:18] the salt of the earth
[1:20:19] you were the preserver the bride is the
[1:20:22] preserver
[1:20:23] therefore when God takes us out there is
[1:20:25] nothing to preserve us we have a role
[1:20:34] we're doing things amen in the spiritual
[1:20:36] realm we are not even aware of
[1:20:39] we are staying the wrath of God somebody
[1:20:44] help me that's why it's important that
[1:20:46] we stay right before God if we lose our
[1:20:50] Savior that's what the Bible said
[1:20:51] Whitworth it'll be trampled on do you
[1:20:57] love the Lord people this is beautiful I
[1:21:00] didn't even touch what but nevertheless
[1:21:04] God said he what he wanted to say
[1:21:06] and I'm gonna tell you something by the
[1:21:08] grace of God when you think about
[1:21:10] everything you know you think about this
[1:21:16] iPad a lot of people don't like it but
[1:21:19] this was made for me I don't have the
[1:21:23] memory like a lot of people have hello
[1:21:27] and you know what you know I remember
[1:21:30] the time I had to write everything out
[1:21:33] what happens when it gets wet from my
[1:21:35] sweat yeah
[1:21:38] tell me there were some setbacks there
[1:21:40] too but at least I know when this goes
[1:21:42] all I got to just plug it back in and to
[1:21:44] come back up to his original self my
[1:21:47] point is the Bible said in the voice in
[1:21:50] the days of the voice the tape recorder
[1:21:53] was made so that voice could be recorded
[1:21:59] think about it all of that all of these
[1:22:02] inventions were done for you and me can
[1:22:06] you imagine how long it would take for
[1:22:09] us to you know how brother and I drove
[1:22:12] from one part yeah you know they were
[1:22:14] built out of different material then we
[1:22:17] can't do that right think about it how
[1:22:21] far it would take if we didn't have an
[1:22:22] airplane we would have to take a boat or
[1:22:25] something to cross over seas but the
[1:22:28] gospel had to travel so God allowed and
[1:22:31] anointed people to invent things that
[1:22:35] will make things go faster and quicker
[1:22:37] for the Gospels sake so you must
[1:22:43] understand that everything that you see
[1:22:45] around Amen that you know you if it used
[1:22:48] wisely
[1:22:49] you can prosper by it because all these
[1:22:54] things were done for you think about it
[1:22:56] y'all remember I remember I do I
[1:22:59] complain about the cellphone but you
[1:23:01] know what I remember what what the cell
[1:23:03] phone look like it looked like a phone
[1:23:06] booth on your back yeah everybody
[1:23:14] thought they was cool brother there
[1:23:18] big ol box like that oh lord help us
[1:23:23] Jesus and so now God don't put it in
[1:23:26] such a little small thing right but
[1:23:30] think about all of the research and
[1:23:31] everything if you use it wisely how it
[1:23:34] accomplished and how you how it perfect
[1:23:37] and bring things into clearer focus you
[1:23:40] and I study the message right on this
[1:23:43] thing here now we get a thought we could
[1:23:46] just boom we're not to read every
[1:23:49] message you know when I find good quotes
[1:23:51] they all good but I found a good one
[1:23:54] I play the whole thing I play the whole
[1:23:59] thing so it encouraged me now I'm saying
[1:24:02] all of this so that you and I may know
[1:24:07] that God has it all under control
[1:24:12] you got a bit you got to trust him that
[1:24:15] way because that's how Israel got in
[1:24:17] trouble you brought us out here I can't
[1:24:21] get over it they talking to God Moses
[1:24:24] you brothers are you in a parish it
[1:24:26] would have been better if we had been
[1:24:28] over there eating garlic's and leeks and
[1:24:30] stuff and none of that stuff sounds
[1:24:31] exciting to me you know but they said we
[1:24:37] could have remained there and they're so
[1:24:39] blind to the fact that God is leading
[1:24:43] them they're so blind here and God hear
[1:24:46] all of that nonsense that back that back
[1:24:50] talking to him and the same time he's
[1:24:52] blessing him their shoes are not wearing
[1:24:54] out their clothes are not wearing out
[1:24:56] he's feeding them with manna for 40
[1:24:58] years he drop him he dropping quail
[1:25:01] don't even have to go hunting nothing
[1:25:04] and he's giving them all of that and it
[1:25:07] was never enough and that was the
[1:25:09] problem with Lucifer all that he had was
[1:25:13] not enough don't ever
[1:25:15] that's what about the contentment
[1:25:17] godliness with contentment is great gain
[1:25:20] you must be content with just being
[1:25:24] godly right so what if you your clothes
[1:25:28] are angry but I got God you understand
[1:25:31] me
[1:25:32] oh you see that's where Israel messed up
[1:25:36] that's where the devil unknowns you when
[1:25:39] you can't find contentment and where God
[1:25:41] has placed you be contented glorify God
[1:25:45] in every situation because there's
[1:25:48] always somebody worse thank you let's
