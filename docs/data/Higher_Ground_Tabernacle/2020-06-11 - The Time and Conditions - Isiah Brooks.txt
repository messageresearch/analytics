Lord because that's what we come to believe we want him everything that we do as we stand let us turn to Ecclesiastes 3 hallelujah surely God is good to us we're still gonna work with try to end up with voice of of the scripture I was working on something else and somehow God's only back this way but I want to entitle the message tonight times and conditions and so we're going to start at please est 3rd chapter we first through the fourteenth verse verse is glad to see everybody tonight it's a good crowd for Wednesday amen beginning at the first verse to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn that have been a time to dance a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing but time to get in a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away a time to Rend and a time to sew a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time to war and a time of peace what prophet have he that worketh in the we're we're in elated I have seen the travail which God has given to the sons of men to be exercised in it we have made everything beautiful yeah also he have set the world in their hearts so that no man can find out the work that God make it from the beginning to the end I know that there is no good in them but for a man to rejoice and to do good in his life and also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labor it is a gift of God I know that whatsoever God do it it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and God do it there that man should fear before him that which have been is now that which is to be have already been and God required that we father God we come before you we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord you have been better to us and we have been to ourselves and father we know Lord God that we are in your care you the caretaker Lord your the provider you our shelter you are all in all and we thank you tonight for being so good to us bless the service and bless those who are listening by way of YouTube or the radio however we just pray Lord that you bless them we thank you God for our sister Joanne and others who are listening we pray father that you continue to bless her house and our household pray Lord God for my son out in California my son there in Ohio different ones Lord that are listening we pray father god that the word will find place in their hearts and bring forth a hundredfold we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray you may be seated I I think about the Lord and basically all that God has done for me and I become overwhelmed because I realized that it is God who is doing everything I am so how can I say it at a time when the world is in chaos I have such a peace that I know that only God could have given and you know I think about how so many people are in turmoil fear is seen to overtake them but you and I who are in this place of safety we only got here because God chose us and when when I think about this Bible and how the Bible is so simple if you really know the author of the Bible he is not one that will complicate anything but he does he says in his word that the only way that you can understand this book you must have his spirit this book was written in such a way to to those who are humble and meek those who are are willing to die to themselves God makes it so simple and so plain I think that we have seen how basically education have destroyed the effects of the Bible traditions and all of these things but God is God and I know one thing that if I am born of him I don't have to worry about living like him because his Spirit conquers everything and we know that in God there is no failure and there is no fear but even so the Bible tells us that it's a it's not how can I say it it's not a way that man can find out himself it's not something that you can you can't put God in science because God is the creator of science you can't put him in a place in your mind of reasoning and you know things of that nature because God in order to understand him he reveals himself he gives himself to you you can't really find him because none of us within ourselves looked for him and if we think that we looked for God it's only because God put it in you to look for him because he knew that if you would look for him in the proper time you would find him we're at a time that we are in what we call a faith generation a generation where a faith is considered ignorance but everybody has a measure of faith but the kind of faith I'm talking about tonight is the faith that God gives you his own thing hallelujah because when you receive the faith of God all things are possible we understand by God's grace that no flesh since the fog has been able to produce a perfect man in all of their efforts men has a tendency to pay first of all we were born failures and so therefore it is what it is but the Bible tells us that in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us he knew us even when we didn't know ourselves you can go throughout all the patriarchs in and all of the prophets and everything else and you find out that somewhere in their lives they messed up I think the closest one a man that ever walked like Jesus Christ was was Joseph himself because there was really no marks against him but if you search the scripture you'll find that that Joseph made a little mistake and he lied to the Pharaoh and he told the Pharaoh that his people were her shepherd herdsmen of cattle instead of shepherds of sheep because in order in Egypt to be a sheep a shepherd was an embarrassment it was low life so if I have been in Egypt I would have been considered low life because I'm a shepherd and you see that means that a true preacher even in this world today is considered ignorant you would believe such a thing as Jesus Christ and him raising from the dead and bringing life to you absolutely you believe that in this man dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily you you believe that and you believe that this Bible is real well I want to say I'm beyond belief I'm a witness hey man because when you become a witness it's that you've been there you've done that amen and there's a time for everything you know God created everything and that scripture says there's a beginning and there's a ending there's a bill these are coming down and nothing really change because even the spirits that that Michael fought in the beginning this year the same and they're doing the same thing now as they did then that's why the Bible says that we are not ignorant of Satan's devices Satan comes to kill steal and destroy but Jesus comes to give us life and that we might have it more abundantly see the conditions in which we're living now is nothing new because the Bible said there is no new thing under the Sun what people are doing now is not new they've done it before and because they did they done it before God also brought his judge has brought his judgment before we look at conditions and the Bible says as it was in the days of Noah answer was in the days of Sodom and we look at these things and we said oh my god can't get any worse well I said like this if the fire of Babylon or Nebuchadnezzar however you want to put it is to be heated up seven times harder that means the demonic power is to be multiplied as well you and I understand that out of the year river Euphrates I believe it's two hundred million Oh demons came out and we've seen with our own eyes what they did and what they have done and what they're going to do because the Bible tells us that these demons that were loosed out of you the river Euphrates are the same demons that Noah had to work with hallelujah and the Bible tells us that these demons influenced the world so much that only eight souls were saved not including Enoch because in the Enoch era only one so was he hallelujah and thank God that we realized amen who built the pyramids when scientist don't have no idea of who built it we know because without a vision the people perish and houses of years before the flood came God had already pronounced by the building of a pyramid what this age was going to produce it was going to produce a church age that would literally reject the capstone hallelujah but then you saw the capstone then you said I saw a stone hewn of the mountain rolling down to Babylon destroying all the works of the devil hallelujah and I'm so glad tonight to know that we're living in the same time and conditions and because of it we can expect God to do something hallelujah something great within the people you understand me so we understand that if we're living in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah there must be an Abraham hallelujah and this Abraham he's no longer here himself but he brought a seed but understand this the seed of Abraham is not by science is not by flesh hallelujah is that right is not by the will of man but is by the promise of God Abraham the Bible said staggered not at the promise of God if you read Romans the fourth chapter you'll find out that Abraham received his circumcision before he was circumcised the sign of circumcision so I'm trying to encourage you this morning or tonight don't worry if God has chosen you to be bride he'll give you the sign of circumcision what was it abraham believed god hallelujah he even though the works had not yet been made manifest he believed God and God said because you believe me of him I'm counting down as righteousness hallelujah and that's how it is with the of this message if you truly believe it with all of your heart God is already accounted the seal done hallelujah you're gonna go through tests you're gonna go through trials hallelujah but at the end of the day you're gonna recognize God's sacrifice in the way God recognized it because Abraham tried to offer up Isaac as a sacrifice and God says not so Abraham but I know that you love me because you were willing not only give your own life but the very thing that meant the most to you you gave it up see what I'm saying Abraham she will also give up the thing that's most valuable to them to please God and when you do that hallelujah you please God and what God says under you don't you worry about it I have provided myself for sacrifice you understand that sacrifice that sacrifice is perfection hallelujah the Lamb of God it was eternal we don't know where the lamb came from but Abraham was on the top of the mountain hallelujah and the Lambs are Rams are usually in the valley somewhere along there hallelujah hi you understand me when Abraham was God put a ram caught in the thicket and you didn't hurt him you say that I love the thickest you know that does something to me because my lord who was the Lamb of God also was caught in the thicket they put a thorn a crown on his head hallelujah they marked him hallelujah but even so they had to acknowledge he was still king of kings King of the Jews hallelujah you loved the Lord let me hurry up so we realize that if that be the truth about Abraham you also must know that when Sodom and Gomorrah was carrying on to that stuff and I'm not I'm telling you this so you can understand your promise see it ain't got nothing to do with how bad you are is God's promise yeah Oh God I think about the promises of God yes we tried to live right but when we fail we can look to the one who live right he's our sacrifice he's our lamb he's our perfection hallelujah there was something going on there because in the time of Sodom ah everybody in the days of song about all you see its perversion no there was something going on in the household of faith God was working with Abraham and he was working with Sarah to do what change their bodies hallelujah and that's what we must be looking at Abraham's seed you must be looking at the change of the body it wasn't anything that Shara did it wasn't nothing that Abraham did every process that made their body change from the old state into a new state was all about God so is it with us tonight everything we got to be the happiest people in the world to know that times and conditions means nothing to you it will not affect what God has purposed in you hallelujah is that right you look at this time and you understand that the burning of Sodom was that was a type of the burning of the world because the whole world has become peoples were lost you know and all of them no no no no the whole world has turned their back on God the whole world will be destroyed again hallelujah but there's a people I'm coming to it there's a people that's going to be changed in the moment and the twinkling of an eye hallelujah not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord hallelujah look at it in that time of Noah the intellectuals great intellectuals building towers and Hall kind of things you know it's amazing that even Nimrod when he built the ark heaven on me the tower he must not have heard Noah's message either he heard it and ignored it and didn't believe it hallelujah is it to say this is the same God sent a vision in this day hallelujah and the visions had made the vision praying that he that readeth hallelujah would run you understand me the Bible said make the peace write the vision make it plain this is the only age of the seven church ages where the vision was written hallelujah we may call it the message but whatever it was a vision written that we might see what the vision is and he said read the vision let him run because the time is at hand y'all understand me this message didn't come to show you the end of the world for you to sit back and eaze in giant the Bible says make your call and election sure Paul said press in hallelujah labor to enter into his rest hallelujah when you are in the rest of God you don't have to worry about what's happening on the outside because you're on the inside hallelujah and where God moves you move hallelujah I'm not gonna be long hallelujah look at the building I preached this somewhat messaging in I Ohio you know but I'm putting some more to it so you can understand him in by God's grace the time that we're living in he said what what do you mean brother look at these people Nimrod tried to outsmart God smart smart God by building the tower the Bible said he built the tower into heaven hallelujah had not God come down he would have achieved it now look at these people if the ungenerous the sinner the wretch if they can get on one Accord and build such a power think about what the bride of Jesus Christ can do if we would just get on one Accord is that right brother branham said it like this he said if I can get ten people in one charts on one Accord the rapture would take place whoa so that means somewhere we're lacking this one according us here is that all right somehow we need to pray that God would put us on one Accord folks folks I don't know about you but I'll be I would feel wonderful to be able to pull on God enough that the rapture would take place hallelujah you say that's not possible he is possible Enoch did it about said Enoch walked with God hallelujah he was a man born of a sinful woman and father hallelujah you understand me but he's so walked with God God opened up the portals of heaven and said that's enough Enoch come on up with me that's what I'm talking about I'm not talking about church Hannah day I'm talking about living like God walking like God talking like God acting like God with all of the gifts like God walking in the among us we don't need a cathedral i'lli'll ooh yeah we just need some people to get on one a car hit up the Lord just the other week you know they launched that spaceship right what they want they want to build a space station up there Wow they know the world is falling apart I'm sorry poor people there's no room for you only the rich in the wealthy how do so so listen but but what they fail to see it's the Bible said they haven't an earth will be on fire so no matter where they are I don't care if they have in the end of the game the Bible said the cave and the mountains and always say Amen I can't hide you there's no place there's only one place of a ton of hottie and that's increase the old Maya feel good tonight just to know that we're right in the right shake the same time and conditions for something mighty to happen hallelujah I'm looking for that time I'm looking for that day I'm an expectation hallelujah I was telling my family only way over here said we gotta make a rapture this is rapture time this is translation tiny yeah we go stumble you gonna fall but you get up the Bible said adjust men fall seven times in a day he gets up hallelujah don't make them let the devil make you feel ashame paranoia because Jesus Christ died for your shame that's why he was naked on the cross he died for your shame your shame my shaking if I follow I get up and say thank you Jesus thank you for allowing me to get up thank you for allowing me to press on thinking Lord Jesus for being so good to me I love your grace I love your mercy even the devil he tried to take your joy because she stumble in you fall hallelujah but I deserve a loving father hallelujah I serve a God who cares hallelujah and you know what before he saved me he knew I wouldn't make mistakes before he gave me the Holy Ghost he knew I would make mistakes some people said when you got the Holy Ghost you don't make mistake me oh yes you do paul said the good that I would I don't do and the things that I don't want to do I find myself doing Paul the prophet of God was admitting that he makes mistakes all Christians do but we have a blood we have a blood that are never loses power hallelujah we have a blood hallelujah that's Justin properly there was there there's bloody so powerful amen God was able to put our names on the book before the foundation hey man this blood was holding the very life of God in it hallelujah and now if people could realize what the true Holy Ghost sealing experiences really is it is a total blood transfusion it is when God's D and E began to work in you instead of the DNA that your mom and your daddy gave you yo mama was a failure daddy was a failure hallelujah but the God that I serve that God that you sure we call him the Lord Jesus Christ he's my father he's my brother hallelujah and we had the same DNA hallelujah hallelujah Matthew 17 18 18 through 20 and Jesus rebuked the devil he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour came to disciples to Jesus apart and said why could not we cast out Devils now this was before Pentecost this would come before Pentecost these people were not even converted yet because remember one time he said to Peter when you are converted you strengthen your brother go straighten him out earlier so some of these people these people they had Jesus with them but they needed Jesus in them hallelujah Jesus there's a lot of Christians who's got Jesus with them they got Jesus around them above them but that's not where Jesus want to be you have a heart and God's desire is to live in your heart you are the temple of God not your head but your heart hallelujah that's why you got to lay down everything says Lord enter into my heart and Jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for Fairleigh I said to you if you have faith as a grain of a mustard seed you should say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible for you that's the Bible hallelujah we just had a sister who who would experience a horrible accident and you know she's born you know I don't know how much or how what the percentage of her body but but she's in critical condition but they thought she was going to die but but you know we got people praying you got people praying and you've got God who's listening you got God who understands amen you know what God he loves to see people who love people that's what touches God when you can enter into somebody else infirmity and pray for them that's what God wants to see he wants to see the love on this plane you don't have to know the person but you can feel it you can feel the person you can enter into that that that that feeling and right now she's recovering you know she's responding now because she was in a coma you know and they got on a lot of medication because of the skin grafts and things they had to do you know a husband if he wasn't there he no telling where she'd be and this is a lovely sister but we're gonna continue to pray for her as well because I believe that he's the same yesterday today and family I just believe that I if you call me of Jesus with an addict that would be a great compliment for me hallelujah because I believe he's the same if he's not the same how I'm gonna make a rapture if he did it for me I can't do it for me hallelujah you love the Lord and when you when you say well well the only reason why you see the church not moving is because somebody has unbelief you know it's not I said oh I believe God that's if it's your head it ain't going nowhere it's gotta come from the heart I believe God from the heart hallelujah because the Bob said it is from the heart the mouth speaketh oh go to God is that right remember I've talked about this kingdom come let thy will be done and I'm talking about things that are happening now amen and if God says let the kingdom of God be on earth as it is in heaven we need to be strong for that whatever they're doing in heaven is what we want to do here hallelujah don't you believe Paul Paul said you must die daily you got to kill this flesh every day you can't because it will revive and when the devil revived when the flesh revived you feel like you unsaved hallelujah thank God he doesn't judge us by the flesh is that right there's no condemnation to those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit hallelujah and once the Holy Ghost is in you once the seal is in you you covered by the blood that's why the Bible said grieve not the Holy Ghost where about you were sealed hallelujah and I believe with all my heart that God is in his word how you gonna have confidence if you don't read his word you got to have confidence enough to read his word if this word is not for yesterday this word is for today is that right Hebrews 13 and they said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's a god that changes not so his word is for today he's still the Alpha and Omega he still the beginning and the ending he's still on this yet he's still omnipotent he still Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Nissi y'all know he's still God and the Bible is another God he knows not who he doesn't know him so concentrate on the true and living God and that God live in you those things that seems impossible is possible he when he told his disciples he said Lord why can't why couldn't we cast out the demon he said because of your unbelief but I say yeah I like the way you when you say that I say if you say to this mountain mountain be thou removed that mountain has to move oh not a demon just not a demon but a mountain it means the faith is at the faith of a mustard seed a little bit but let it be don't let it be habit which a musta see cannot be hybrid let it be pill and if you have pure faith that means faith will never accept defeat except defeat I don't care how long it takes is will happen see but you're the temple of God and the Bible says let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus how about condition but what do you mean brother Bush what I'm talking about God coming along and perfecting me hmm God coming alone and perfecting me well what I'm listening to his voice now if his voice is a voice of resurrection which it is and his voice went down to the last resort ooh there when Lazarus had laid for days rotten and stinking and his voice call for a man to come from the grave and this man gets up you say what do you leave brothers let me say like this if you die in faith you will be raised in faith and I don't know how it's actually done and wherever Lazarus was he knew he had to come back to where he used to be and God there wasn't another person never does the same person that went into that body but by the time the spirit of a lesser God and the body was made whole hallelujah and that's what I'm trying to tell you tonight amen it doesn't matter if you feel like you dead like Lazarus all you got to do is hear the voice of God and God will raise you up again hallelujah roll away the stone of unbelief hallelujah is that right the same kind of conditions hallelujah look as I said Nimrod didn't hear noise message they study building and just like the day today they didn't hear the I didn't hear the message of william branham do you know the world knew did you not know thousands millions of people were healed and delivered during his time where are they don't don't say where the White House didn't know God even God went to the White House made a miracle at the White House they picture there at the White House but if they don't believe it they're just like us you gotta believe it if we are the children of the generation of faith we must be like God hallelujah and God said let there be and it was so hallelujah that's the reason why the seals were open that's why the thunders rolled hallelujah because the sons of God there were time that God waited and he waited and he waited and that scripture laid there but the Bible said that the whole creation waits and grows for the sons of God not anymore the sons of God like it was in the days of Noah in the days of Enoch but they are here and they're speaking and a lot of people have no idea of what's happening God is building a pyramid all over again but it's by the hand of Jesus Christ just like he went to say how prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also hallelujah he told his disciples is good that I go away cuz when I come again and that won't be with you but I'll be in you thank God for the Holy Ghost thank God for this temple that God has decided your temple that God chose to live in hallelujah that's what he said he said to decide but you better fear God don't you feel man he maybe even destroy your body but God is able to destroy your body and your soul hallelujah of the Lord it's going home time I believe that with all of my heart it's going home time let that mind be in you you are the temple of God and that beam case we need to learn how to do a hardness as a good soldier hallelujah y'all heard me in your hardness as a good soldier every time I think about that I think about Lazarus let the rich man table that only had a hard time he had a hard time and you actually wonder you you know what was it you know never has seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread I'm like where that laughter he looked like he was begging but he wasn't cuz the bread that he needed he had it hallelujah and that Brad was God I'm working on the message right now amen you know I look at this thing Lord i'ma just touch on it a little bit don't you know that Bethlehem means the house of God's bread oh and guess who was there who started you know it was it was a sad moan and started there and out of that lineage came who David and all the rest and you think about God using the prostitute to bring forth the Messiah hallelujah by the time he got to Mary it was a virgin but understand it wasn't a natural seed that Mary produced that wasn't it because God built himself a body according to the Word of God he was not only blood but he was also the seed and the end the body hallelujah but it was what happened to Jesus within that John Oh somebody help me here take that's what people don't understand in this last day you got to meet John before you meet Jesus in order to make a rapture they lied Oh hallelujah because it is the orry's the only one that knows who Jesus is nobody in the crowd knew him and he's the one the only one who knew who Jesus is he's not a denomination he's not organization he's the word hallelujah Oh glory to God and when you meet John John points you to Jesus hallelujah glory to God I'm talking about rapture material he can't change and guess what just like they beheaded John it has something to do they tried to destroy him that's why but they did in a spiritual way have nothing to do with this message he's a false prophet how can he be how could he be when they're bad well at least a man who they're doing the same thing same time same condition oh this man is up the devil and the blind man's are talking to be of the devil even you know scripture teaches that only God can heal all your chicken tells you that he said I know you can come to their whatever conclusion you want to come to but I can tell you this I once was blind but now I see that's all I'm saying I know it's real cuz I once was blind spiritually but now I see who could have opened my eyes for Jesus himself for Word of God and the Bible says according to proverbs 29:18 where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he hallelujah so the vision and the law or the word must be the same hallelujah he told us that this day was going to be Sodom no one's day he told us how the people are going to act he also told us that this world would be so insane the only people that would have their sanity would be the bride of Jesus Christ and they calling us crazy because we live in holding you gotta preach this that's the time and condition we're living in you you can't you can't get away from it it's polluted the whole world I preach I said like this I believe all day and seven times worse than their day was hallelujah go back to Rebecca and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak did not he spoke the book was open the lamb took the book out on the right hand of him who sat on the throne when people read that they think is - they think it's three but they don't understand hallelujah the lamb was in the very bosom of God and he walked forth as a man and took it and the Bible said that when John look for lamb he saw a lion and that lion was a tribe of Judah what was it he come to break order because that same angel stood there on the land and the sea and declared that time would be no more listen to the voice of the scripture will finish the only thing that God is doing now is working on his bride everything has been already judged that's why I Rome is coming in whatever virus is coming but his judgment like it was in the time of Egypt oh but there is a Goshen hallelujah there's a place of hiding there's a place of safety it's not a physical building it's not a physical place but it's all spirits hallelujah you love the Lord I'll say consider what I say and the Lord give the understanding in all things is that right we're under the same inspiration hallelujah if you're gonna preach this message you can't leave out nothing hallelujah that's what made the message so great because the Prophet didn't leave nothing out he hid everything every sin everything everything as preachers children of God we must preach it we must live it the same thing hallelujah you said was a prophet perfect know the Bible said Elijah was a man of like passions he had to fight just like you and I hallelujah but the God in him was perfect just like the God and you was perfect with faith seed we can't help ourselves hallelujah that's like asking the Lord street why are you producing orange I can't help myself hallelujah I can't think like a banana tree I can't think like a pear tree I'm an orange tree and all I could do is produce produce oranges is that right see the seed in you is the thing that God's looking at folks hallelujah it ain't whose parents you had where you was born you could come back like the Bible tells us Jacob and Esau they came out of the same womb by the same mama same daddy and he saw was a devil see so it goes back to election hallelujah right you can have a Isaac and Ishmael hallelujah and he came from a different room and he was a devil but he had the same daddy yes grace its election is a choosing of God that's why I try to tell people when you sit back there and you act like you don't love the Holy Ghost and you don't want all to go something wrong with you you understand that the Holy Ghost is your life it is the life of the blood hallelujah o God have mercy without the life of the black there is no blood hallelujah that's what people understand no matter if your mama or your daddy are in the message it's still God's choosing mom and daddy can't get you there it's still God's choosing everybody got to have the seal of token other token seals right this is what he says every word in the Bible is God's thoughts laying in seed form so if the seed of God is in you you God's word it's the word that's laying in you that's why when you were younger you always felt differently I know I'm speaking cuz I mean cleaning grapes up here hey you felt different you thought different you active and even though you wouldn't you will sooner you know something would always condemn you and your friends could go and do what they want to do but have a good timing but something was different about you that's what we call the election no matter sister right now it doesn't matter so much so we're autumn in marriage six seven times God don't care if the seed is in you see the woman at the well she was married all those time she's still in the bride hallelujah see what people don't understand it ate the trap that God gets you in I mean the devil gets you in God wants the devil to get you in the traps so God can show you how much of a deliverance he deliver here hallelujah hey you said Oh what about what about what about you know Tamar and all of those people listen Tamar was guilty of incest hallelujah but God so say divide her she in the book of generations look at Ram it doesn't matter if he was a drunkard a drug addict hallelujah a prostitute in seven it doesn't matter what you are if he was a man standing on the street with a dress God still can save you hallelujah God still can save you it all depends of that scene is in you he said whosoever will let him come hallelujah if you're willing to become a Christian God is willing to change you you can be a murderer and God can still save you you'll still be see hallelujah is right the Bible said no murderer were entering there but when God catches you as a mother he changes you he transformed you from a murderer to a saint hoping God this what's wrong with the world they need some power we need some Holy Ghost power hallelujah they let these people know you don't have to die like that you can live hallelujah right a seed if you receive into the human being let me read this over and every word in the Bible is God's thoughts laying in sea form that if received into the human being and spoke by the same thoughts that materialize the Bible it brings the thing to pass you understand that's what Paul was saying let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus because the very thought of Christ man was God's mind and when he spoke something he it happened right he spoke to the tree and said because you didn't bring forth no fruit you bewildered and they come right back and the tree is dead hallelujah is that right what was it it was the son of God speaking that are you not a son of God man fact Jesus call you his brothers hallelujah is that right and Paul said with joint heirs with Christ if you got Christ once you speak something and believe it hold fast don't let the devil make you waver don't look at your eyes oh it's getting worse it's not getting worse most the time when things look like it's getting worse it's getting better Union hope fences and praise God never you defeated a man you're trying to make it look worse is that right what about the man when Jesus cast those Devils out of him right he had epilepsy and you know what the devil did he tried to put fear and panic in Jesus he started talking to the boy the boy around everywhere all through the fire whatever and Jesus stood there says okay when you finish use this time during tandem you doing you got to go you show it out okay I'm just gonna wait till you finish but you still got to go but you still got to go same conditions hallelujah when you pray for a person I don't care what it looks like don't ever doubt that your prayer fail Jesus stood at the tomb of Lazarus says I know you hear me father I know you hear me as sons and daughters of God if the blood of Jesus Christ is covering you you ought to be able to stand there since Lord I know you hear me well you just did that well if you just did it you made it right he still hear you huh if God stopped hearing you he wouldn't hurt your prayer God said let there be before it could be a word it had to be a thought so God in the creation created the world by his thought is that right he spoke it and the thought expressed become material see what I mean y'all understand me well a lot of time we think is our thoughts well you know you can't cash out loaned ever surely the God gives you the thought to cash out of debit must come from God and if it come from God you need to speak it in faith and it happens I cast out devils try to give him me I can't oh you got to go like don't fellowship with darkness you got to go right now if that same spirit that said let there be and there was life that said let there be learned there was there was trees in the cage was mine that was in Christ being you how much could it say let there be no cancer let it would be gone let them let the blind eyes be open and it would be so see is your thought Jesus said right let there be y'all can y'all handle that that's a Bride of Christ can you handle that let there be let there be no more cancer you ain't got to carry on oh whoa whoa you don't shake nobody they don't have to fall out just speak the word believe it hallelujah but wait a minute see have faith in God for very verily I said to you if you shall say to this mountain be moved pluck up and cast into the sea and don't doubt it in your heart but believe that what you say will come to pass you will have whatever things you say it and there are situations in our lives that seems like mountains but those mountains are there in your life to be cast away not to stand in the front - it's there to be a castaway hallelujah is that all right what shall we say to him that Abraham our Father as pertaining to flesh had found if Abraham was justified by works he had we're out to glory but not before God for what said the scripture abraham believed God and was counted unto him for righteousness now i'ma jump back because remember when the seals were opened the prophet of God said it put the Christian man back into a place in Eden before the fall and the Bible even tells us that Adam was not deceived so Adam that he never disbelieved he just did it willfully did what he did to say he he never been safe never broke and so if that be the truth this message is supposed to create a fake in us they Adam had let Jesus had a fake that couldn't can't be broken hallelujah I think that had no space without our fear what it is what is it creating in you Christ must be formed in you hallelujah you love the Lord now I ain't about words and that's what the devil gets us some time to call listen what works we gonna do now the world only wanna hear gospel but what are you gonna find the true seed you know we're not about proselyting hello but we're at a time right now where majority of the people in the world are serpents they don't want God he said Lord lead me to somebody and what does God have to go through just to find somebody that even would talk about Jesus in public and Christians who don't want to talk about Jesus in public you can say God they don't mind you saying God but when you say Jesus and you better not tell them that Jesus Christ is God you are you ready for a fight you love the Lord but let me here let me say something to you and I'm a close in just a minute I've actually gone farther than I wanted to but let me let me say like this the scripture tells us blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven let me jump up even as david also described the blessings of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without words you tell me I did not know God didn't gave you his righteousness you gave him your sins he gave you his righteousness oh but I ain't done nothing neither did the man on the cross the thief on the cross never did nothing he didn't do anything but he's there in glory cuz Jesus Christ said so he believed God if thou be the Christ God have mercy on me remember being in you when you come into your kingdom that was Abraham's seed I don't think he was among the thousands or that that actually fit you know had the fish in the lobes and I don't believe he was around those who who actually saw Lazarus raised from the dead or anything of that nature he came right at the end a changing of the dispensations and the grace of God caught him and pulled him oniy you can come right at the end and gotta pull you right on in it is the time [Music] crucified Jesus Christ refresh they're doing it all over again hallelujah but the grace of God Oh times the conditions has caught has been our favor hallelujah you love the Lord excuse me blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered you got iniquities when you know to do good and you do it anyway you know not to you know not to see and you know not to do this and you know not to do that and you do it anyway as they over Lord forgive me God God died for that with the stripes we were healed the iniquity we know that y'all y'all like y'all look at me like I'm crazy because because i'ma tell you something if you got the Holy Ghost it's very seldom you accidentally do something wrong you got the Holy Ghost you don't already thought about it you're not to temptation for you to get sin yeah and you can show all Lord the devil the devil made me do it no did they ever didn't make you do it brother and said if you got the Holy Ghost you he can't get into you but you went out to him and the only way God gonna heal you or better said Lord is me standing in the need of prayer I'm the one did it I did it Lord forgive me I did it that's when God can help you but as long as you keep blaming the devil like II did God needs a man woman that's gonna own up to their problems you love the Lord oh come on somebody blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute sin don't you see how favorite you are and somebody say whether God don't have no favours yes he does I'm one of them I know the way he treats me has got to be favor Jesus had a favor didn't he and who was it John and John is a type of what the bride so evidently he favors the bride hallelujah you say God don't help faith yes she does Peter denied him three times Judas did it once and God feel that Peter preached on the day of Pentecost and preached a mighty message three thousand so cool just know I didn't have to pick me off the floor of a hat off preach somewhere and a hand about three or four thousand and all I'm coming it's a dapper pig y'all go get brother blood y'all know what I'm saying can you imagine the anointing in the power that was in the place this was on the street this wasn't even my room Jesus help me Lord let me hurry up so what come at this blessed being upon the circumcision only upon the uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness and we know where the Abraham seed so your faith is reckon that's why the devil mad with you he makes you make mistakes he causes you to do a lot of things that you shouldn't do but guess what you still have a rapture a date for translation because it's not your righteousness is here but he's going to see that the blood of Jesus Christ before it's all over you stand like God's on the earth his God's working not ours hallelujah and I'm so glad as he's working hallelujah well the time is now for the voice of the scripture speaks this afternoon that this is the hour this is the time Sodom and Gomorrah and all of these other things are setting just the way they were supposed to be setting and here you are showing to the royal seed of Abraham that you alive and the son of man is being revealed in this day of Sodom Heavenly Father grant that the people will see and when they come back that they are take God's Word just like Abraham did no matter when no matter where hallelujah you love the Lord I'm just gonna start right now but I love the Lord and I say you know we must understand that this is the Lord's doing you being here it's the Lord's doing mmm don't fear don't don't let the devil put you in such a place where you look like a miserable Christian y'all ever seen anything like that I've seen I've gone to malls and everything else and and you see Christian women you know and and you know look like they look holy but they're not expressing holiness you know what holiness is joy it ain't just just a clean life it's Joy's life holiness it's the Holy Ghost is God's life in you and when you sitting up there like Oh Lord I just you know you know lost your best friend as they used to say prayer is a place where God takes you the joy of the Lord is my strength and when the devil comes to you to cause you to lose your joy understand say look listen devil this is the rising of the Sun the Sun is riding right and the Bible said that when the enemies shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against now y'all know what that mean flood means people right and so when those two hundred million demons come in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard and you are the standard can you imagine I don't know how many I have to fight but the Bible raised me up at a time like this to fight demons why to defeat Satan it's the season in a time we're now reliving if I could say it like this the time of Myka and Lucifer and they were at war I stood with him then I'm standing with him now Jesus Christ it's long he defeated Lucifer in the beginning he succeeded Lucifer on the mountain hallelujah he defeated Lucifer at Calvary he said he defeated Lucifer before he comes again and I'm closing on me don't worry God has already made a wave xscape for you with every temptation the Bible said God makes a way of escape and you are the raw your seed of God is that right when devil tried to fit the Coquille oh yeah he killed Abel right he killed Abel so he figure from now on I'm killing everything to look royal but then God brought both sin hallelujah self was a Holy Roller there's that right whatever and however even wash himself a god Seth King doing the same thing hallelujah because the Bible said was set before being men began to worship God again hallelujah and that's what that's what the devil hate he hated know God's love worship he know that you and I was created for worship hallelujah God has said of him he had child him he had the four living creatures and all of them and he still wasn't satisfied until he made you and me he wanted something in his own image worshiping him Oh somebody help me here he wanted a Sarah they can call Abraham long y'all understand me Sarah was a type of the bride Abraham was a type of God hallelujah and guess what what's he whatever Abraham decided to do Sarah this lady why because she somehow all things work together for the good that didn't that love alone is that right and you got to understand Abraham he had all these experiences God was telling go left and he would go right however it would and you know he he had the Babylon experience he had different experiences all because he didn't listen to God and that's what happened to us sometimes we get in trapped sometimes we get caught and God has to pull us out like God pull Abraham out right but when it never changed because Abraham's covenant was unconditional y'all understand me so the bride of Jesus Christ it's unconditional you know what I'm saying so we go on and he said what love was what are you trying to say you keep going by God's grace and then you know how Moses God said no that's wrong you'll see they're right you came touch him and with all of those Babylonians Egyptian swordsmen and then went to kill all them children why what does the foolish virgin what is it she takes Kiko really she is she'll be killed while we escape what about with Jesus right row you see Harrison kill everything two years and under and why heaven was working Jesus was working God was working let me tell you something when they come in on us God has a way of escape hallelujah and Jesus the angel comes down as in Jesus taking Joseph take Jesus to Egypt why because I must call my son out of Egypt did he do it he did it and he's gonna do it again hallelujah every one of those patriarchs from the church first turn change all the way down could have escaped but that day of escape was dying sedated for you and I Paul I had to go to the chopping block Polly knew you Yahoo what I'm saying John who typed up the bride he was the only one that died of a natural death all of them died killed by the Roman and everything else but there's a bride and ever tried to find out who she is he knows she don't look like him cuz his his bride look like a prostitute she's looking like Eve did you know that how do you know well because I'm gonna tell you something when the devil is anointing a woman he makes her strip he stoop he makes her proud of her nakedness hallelujah but not a true woman of God of God she's not a proud of her nakedness she covers everything because she was the word to cover everything he loved the Lord know this enemy comes in you know how we don't have to worry about it because Revelation chapter said that just before the woman when the woman gave birth see the devil was coming but the woman gave birth before he got there and right now brother Branham preached a message birth pain and right now the bride is in birth and she's soon to be delivered because before that the enemy comes she will be already delivered a child she already will produce Jesus is that right and the Bible said once she produced Jesus that child was caught up into the heavens hallelujah and she had to go in the wilderness for three and a half years I said Lord what does that mean he said that's where the northing of God would go back to the Jews and preach to them the oh they goes attract chat tracks how many was it it transitions and will be up there three and a half years now heaven is not a wilderness Moses and Elijah will come and preach to the Jews the same message what a powerful house God said in one day can you see a hundred and father foe not that just count you mean children down south we say chillings can you imagine that's why the private God said to go to leap over walls and run through the mouth oh Jesus hardly knew against where folks I don't know where that was gonna interrupt my dinner with him or not but I sure would love to see you blessed and we're right at the dressing for the threshold of this lovely thing that God has done we ought to be so happy time hard times are going to come it's gonna get rougher but that's okay you got peace maintain your peace if you keep your minds head on him he said here grant your feets keep your mind on him God is good to us I love the Lord [Music] leave it there Oh [Music] Oh leave it believe it [Music] body and
