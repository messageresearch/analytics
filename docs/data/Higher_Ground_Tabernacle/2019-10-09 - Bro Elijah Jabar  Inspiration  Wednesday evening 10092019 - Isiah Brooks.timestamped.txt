[19:11] amen
[19:14] I was in motion to get them to
[19:17] reapportion the Scriptures I would still
[19:20] not feed me the book of Matthew chapter
[19:23] 16 the early portion of the world
[19:31] Matthew chapter 16 amen
[19:45] Matthew chapter 16 verse 13 and every
[19:51] goes word amen
[19:59] when Jesus came into the coasts of
[20:03] Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples
[20:07] saying whom do men say that I the Son of
[20:13] man came and he said some say that thou
[20:16] art John the Baptist and some eli's
[20:21] ordered Jeremiah or one of the prophet
[20:25] and Jesus Saturday for whom say ye that
[20:30] are and Simon Peter answered and said
[20:36] thou art a Christ the Son of the Living
[20:38] God and jesus answered and said unto Him
[20:43] blessed are thou Simon Simon bar Jonah
[20:49] for flesh and blood are not revered on
[20:52] the D but my father which is in heaven
[20:56] and I say unto thee that thou art Peter
[20:59] and upon this rock I will build my
[21:02] church and a gate of Hell shall not
[21:05] prevail against it an hour gave on the
[21:09] deed a key of the kingdom of heaven and
[21:12] once they were - a burn on earth shall
[21:14] be bound in heaven and was what - and
[21:17] loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
[21:20] in law a blessing to the reading of his
[21:23] word
[21:23] plea be seated amen now from this
[21:29] portion just word I just do encourage
[21:33] the sins on subject code inspiration and
[21:39] saying Jesus when he came into the
[21:45] coasts of Caesarea Philippi he asked his
[21:48] disciples say who do men say that I the
[21:52] Son of Man and the disciples are giving
[21:57] deaf
[21:57] opinions say some say what do you wear
[22:02] or a say who Jesus was
[22:04] say some say you are John the Baptist
[22:07] others say Elijah or Isaiah Jeremiah
[22:12] I want the Prophet that was the opinion
[22:16] of others what was saying about Jesus
[22:18] you know Jesus being the Word of God
[22:22] we've seen the opinions of others were
[22:25] speaking every word of God what was
[22:28] saying concerning the world but Jesus
[22:31] turned to them ask them because how do
[22:34] your personal revelation so he turned to
[22:38] them an example who do you see what what
[22:42] is your conviction what do you know
[22:45] about me what do you see a an ordinary
[22:49] was talk no could see anything no was
[22:53] speaking
[22:54] there was talk in the shell and know who
[22:57] come out but we see that in the
[23:00] scriptures
[23:01] we see that the Bible said but Simon
[23:05] Peter Anthony said thou are the Christ
[23:07] you add another one you had a son of the
[23:11] Living God you are God in flesh you are
[23:15] God manifested in this out but Jesus
[23:19] unless a blessing a doubt now why Jesus
[23:22] call Peter blessed because it is Peter
[23:25] cash in Revelation and the only way you
[23:28] can catch a revelation of God's Word you
[23:31] have to be blessed so you see that what
[23:35] Jesus say in the word a blessing a down
[23:39] some about journal for flesh and blood
[23:43] I'm not reveal it unto you I'm not an
[23:46] inspiration is a special influence of
[23:50] the vanity upon human flesh so you see
[23:54] as God Tommy done in a special way
[23:56] because Peter were blessed that is like
[23:59] who see oh go go open his eyes to catch
[24:02] the revelation and church the son that
[24:05] if you are not blessed to see it you
[24:07] will never see it so you see
[24:11] that is what Jesus was emphasizing the
[24:14] pita hey who do you say I am actually
[24:17] the question and broblem said in a
[24:20] message yeah you're him he made this
[24:22] statement either you see salvation is
[24:25] not passed upon what somebody else think
[24:29] it is what you think of him
[24:33] is it divine healing isn't based on what
[24:37] criticisms or what the judge says it
[24:40] based upon your best fit in the inspire
[24:45] world and how you inspire to believe
[24:50] that that bring the result it is her
[24:53] inspiration but the world now what does
[24:57] it hallelujah and take note the world is
[25:03] our inspired this word is inspired
[25:07] because according to the scriptures in a
[25:11] Bible of 2nd Timothy chapter 3 verse 16
[25:13] the Bible said our scriptures hallelujah
[25:19] it's the soul it's the field but our
[25:22] scriptures is getting by inspiration of
[25:26] God and is profitable for doctrine for
[25:31] reproof for correction for instruction
[25:35] in righteousness so the Word of God
[25:39] before the foundation of the world is
[25:42] already being inspired hallelujah and
[25:46] take note and in this word is inspired
[25:50] they take you to be inspired to K the
[25:54] inspired Word so the one of them is
[25:58] complete but it's the human being
[26:01] that is what techno before Peter who
[26:04] gets the revelation of the word God how
[26:07] to inspire him some of our inspiration
[26:11] you can never get the inspire word so it
[26:15] that God will not give of your eyes
[26:17] before you can catch the revelation of
[26:20] this word and that is where Christ
[26:23] because Christ
[26:24] the world and they're bad with their
[26:27] hoarding we'll move on the inspiration
[26:29] on the power of the Holy Ghost and I
[26:32] write that one of the other inspiration
[26:35] and they see inspiration again from God
[26:38] they write the word the same inspiration
[26:41] have to come upon you before you can
[26:45] catch the revelation of this world or
[26:49] earth you will never see it hallelujah
[26:53] and so you see that is why Peter through
[26:57] the scriptures the producer we realize
[27:01] that we in the Bible you do not read it
[27:05] like who asked newspaper because it had
[27:10] been a wisdom of the Holy Ghost and
[27:12] hidden things from the wise and the
[27:15] prudent and result of its source that
[27:19] will a hallelujah so you see it thank
[27:23] God because you don't take no church
[27:26] it is God how to open your eyes the word
[27:30] do understand the scriptures they were
[27:34] cannot understand it hallelujah is it
[27:37] all structures as given by inspiration
[27:40] and n was reinterpreted by inspiration
[27:44] and then the skirt just be compared with
[27:47] scriptures hallelujah and that is what
[27:51] church if that inspiration hit your life
[27:56] then it will cause it will go and price
[28:00] and price gotta be pay and sometimes it
[28:06] causes separation in homes hallelujah
[28:12] because it take inspiration it will
[28:15] cause separation homes because many
[28:18] people will not honest in you so now in
[28:22] their homes their families their
[28:24] relations they don't understand what you
[28:28] are talking about its what if Gregor
[28:31] said sometimes this cost
[28:37] - lettuce it sometimes it causes
[28:40] separation hoops sometimes it causes
[28:44] separation in touches sometimes after
[28:48] separation enlarges in all walks of life
[28:54] sometimes between husband and wife
[28:58] hallelujah he said by a lack feet he has
[29:04] a lot of mistake like a half but this
[29:07] one time he was really inspired
[29:11] he stood up quickly said thou art the
[29:15] Christ what a statement
[29:18] thou are the Christ and Jesus said
[29:22] blessed are thou for flesh and blood
[29:27] have not revealed it unto you but the
[29:31] father which is in heaven not that no
[29:34] church has a son that you can never see
[29:39] the world that is well aunts many people
[29:43] the question what I couldn't bring you
[29:45] to this message because Jesus Christ is
[29:49] the same yesterday today and forever and
[29:52] now in order in nineteen supply the full
[29:56] word came down and a Babel because a new
[29:59] book what in spiritual you have to see
[30:03] this message what I click draw you to
[30:08] this message because let me tell you is
[30:11] somebody taught you in to add somebody
[30:14] ask and talking out of it his summary is
[30:19] really people add Shambhala influencial
[30:22] of head and when somebody pair you into
[30:25] it some okay you out of it
[30:30] hallelujah so you see church that is
[30:33] what what actually draw you to this
[30:35] message it has to be an inspiration it
[30:40] have to be a regulation or as you are on
[30:44] a plane church and you'll be confuse
[30:49] because they were disorder inspire the
[30:53] word is inspired before the foundation
[30:56] of the world and Jesus press is the word
[30:59] and Christ is a message of this out so I
[31:03] take an inspiration of God to come upon
[31:07] you and church you hardly bless you have
[31:12] them in a program of God in our case the
[31:17] revelation of this message hallelujah
[31:21] so we see that where Jesus had blessed a
[31:25] does some but Journal because no man can
[31:31] teach you this nor me make sure to you
[31:36] that is what even when a preacher
[31:38] preaches he don't know how God convict
[31:41] hot he just preached and he goes come
[31:46] down take the world because Emma Tecna
[31:49] hula girls were inspired Word of God in
[31:52] your heart and I see has to be there and
[31:55] a power of God of Thunder everything I
[31:58] see before your eyes can be open for
[32:02] cash the word hallelujah and when you
[32:07] cash it then no one can take it from you
[32:12] hallelujah os you're going to be playing
[32:16] Church you'll be wondering and it is
[32:19] true and so how long you stay in the
[32:22] message here is I can be ball right in a
[32:25] message but take an inspiration they
[32:29] take a revelation and inspire revelation
[32:32] and now tech note is it an upon this
[32:36] rock I will build my church and a get of
[32:41] Hell cannot prevail there you are
[32:45] inspiration inspired revelation and how
[32:50] he was inspired standing there in front
[32:53] of the Messiah who was the world thou
[32:57] are the Christ they were flesh and blood
[33:01] and reveal unto you but upon this rock
[33:04] and not Church what is it upon
[33:09] inspiration problems that you see it
[33:12] upon inspiration of the Lord Jesus
[33:16] Christ through his word I will build my
[33:21] church and they get of Hell cannot
[33:25] prevail he said though it shows that
[33:29] gift of hell will be against and that is
[33:35] well they get of hell is always against
[33:40] the message they always against the
[33:43] world because a full truth Jesus Christ
[33:46] act of eNOS age and they get of hell and
[33:49] against the world the revelation of the
[33:51] world but then the church is celebrating
[33:56] the fight against it they're gonna go
[33:59] against that but techno judge is your
[34:01] inspire and you state the revelation he
[34:05] wouldn't fight but I can never they can
[34:10] never prevail hallelujah amen because
[34:17] the Bible said when I L met them in like
[34:20] a frog but a spirit of talk with the
[34:24] revelation of the world will rest a
[34:26] standard against hallelujah
[34:29] so church is sooo how to be inspired to
[34:34] cast a spy a word every night spire
[34:37] Church he will never see it and why
[34:41] Jesus said that gate of hell is against
[34:46] free time dealers pokers word is
[34:49] happening today that is where the good
[34:54] of her I give this message Friday anyway
[34:58] Tommy in churches can Amin brightest
[35:02] cestus men estas
[35:06] hallelujah because it had to be a
[35:08] revelation to you the other see for
[35:12] yourself
[35:15] do you if you don't see it yet your
[35:18] place is the author hallelujah
[35:23] your place is Auto areas their reasoning
[35:27] out and he still wondering what it is to
[35:30] or not if he not stable yet the other
[35:34] ask God hallelujah a man so you see a
[35:40] church if Ferguson is upon the
[35:44] inspiration of Jesus Christ which the
[35:47] world I will be my church and the get of
[35:51] Hell will not prevail against it
[35:54] it's a dirt it shows that all depths of
[35:57] hell will be against it but they can
[36:02] never prevail they cannot prevail said
[36:06] God said when I animate come in like
[36:09] Ephraim and say ah going just speaking
[36:13] because it's a revelation however is a
[36:16] standard so go and do it
[36:18] he said when all the gates of Thamud
[36:21] it's pressing against that little church
[36:24] and the church is individual it's a car
[36:28] I want is an owner get of hell is
[36:31] pressing against another church as I a
[36:34] big another Church
[36:38] hallelujah another church yet and will
[36:42] never prevail because she is going right
[36:48] on she'll keep pressing the back and
[36:51] change that is father act with a
[36:54] question what I couldn't bring you to
[36:57] this message what I didn't bring you
[37:01] well Arthur coalition to countless
[37:06] message and you say you believe it no

[37:23] he will flood all means to make you lose
[37:28] coffee
[37:28] in the world the mayor doubts to make
[37:36] you reason out but the Word of God has
[37:39] no reason it's not intellectuals
[37:44] hallelujah amen
[37:47] there is no reason that their
[37:49] intellectual not afraid or taught us the
[37:53] importance of revelation but that spirit
[37:57] where true believer can never be over
[38:00] emphasized if the revelation means more
[38:04] to you that the heart she realized is
[38:10] that I'm not talking about revelation to
[38:12] you I'm talking about our regulation and
[38:16] it's a tremendous in commanders are
[38:19] important to the church they said do you
[38:22] remember Marty succeed why you say to us
[38:27] that this body opposed to all day

[39:23] equation what people think of me they

[1:33:43] we just want to say by God's grace I
[1:33:47] know the Lord spoke
[1:33:54] all of us I know I heard from God
[1:34:01] and I just think
[1:34:07] we were here earlier today pray
[1:34:10] [Music]
[1:34:11] and that brother was nowhere to be found
[1:34:20] God
[1:34:24] I believe in all my heart and I know not
[1:34:27] not just believe but I know that God and
[1:34:30] every hard
[1:34:38] I told you just last week to listen to
[1:34:43] enticing spirits cuz that's what's
[1:34:46] happening to the people anointed but
[1:34:50] with the wrong
[1:34:54] being taken as a week from the word
[1:34:56] instead of bringing us clothes anything
[1:35:00] that takes you away from the word is not
[1:35:03] of God especially nowadays I could care
[1:35:08] less about what it may be but God is not
[1:35:13] looking for excuses I was thinking
[1:35:19] how we really need and you know
[1:35:21] everybody knows that I've been really
[1:35:23] praying for revival in this church
[1:35:26] because we need a revival one thing I
[1:35:30] know that if we're going to find the
[1:35:32] right position in Christ it must come by
[1:35:36] if I love we must learn how to say the
[1:35:44] right thing if you're not going to speak
[1:35:47] positive about a brother or sister you
[1:35:49] shouldn't speak at all I've heard the
[1:35:52] Word of God I know it's true I was
[1:35:55] talking to her brother in South Carolina
[1:35:57] today and we were saying the same thing
[1:36:00] that this brother preached today about
[1:36:04] how in a lot of places a lot of right
[1:36:07] things are being said but there are no
[1:36:10] there's no inspiration
[1:36:12] there's no life and this is what I was
[1:36:16] trying to say on Sunday morning when I
[1:36:19] came in
[1:36:21] to this auditorium when I came in here
[1:36:23] tonight I felt what I felt I got very
[1:36:27] jealous for the Lord Jesus cause God is
[1:36:31] worthy of all praise and and I wasn't
[1:36:36] gonna freak and will never preach again
[1:36:38] if I come in a place and the power of
[1:36:41] God is not already in here we gonna sing
[1:36:43] and praise God until he comes because
[1:36:46] I'm not gonna try to preach ever again
