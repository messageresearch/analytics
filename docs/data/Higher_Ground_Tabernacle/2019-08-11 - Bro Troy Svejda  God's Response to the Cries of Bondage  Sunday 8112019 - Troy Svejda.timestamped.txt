[38:08] of our lives without you as a guide for
[38:11] us Lord we are in total totally hopeless

[38:20] comes up before you Lord and Lord we
[38:23] need you so much or we cannot live our
[38:27] lives without your we've tried Lord

[38:50] we pray you would seal your response

[38:56] to your response maybe we say yes and
[38:58] amen to it
[38:59] for you are true and faithful and you're
[39:03] the same yesterday today and forever and
[39:05] so is your response the same in the name
[39:09] of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[39:12] amen you can be seated now I don't want
[39:22] you to think that it's a strange thing
[39:24] that the children of Israel were in
[39:29] bondage God prophesied of their bondage
[39:34] before it ever happened now let's go
[39:38] back in time a little ways to the time
[39:40] of Abraham you remember Abraham was
[39:44] living in spiritual bondage he may have
[39:51] had physical freedom amen he may have
[39:55] been living at peace in his father's
[39:57] house in the land of ur of the Chaldees
[40:00] but spiritually he was in bondage he was
[40:05] serving the gods of his father's he was
[40:09] serving the gods of his land but God
[40:11] called him to come out of that to be
[40:17] free from that and to walk in the
[40:20] freedom of the Holy Ghost
[40:22] he said I will lead you to a land that I
[40:26] will show you and when you get to that
[40:30] land you will be free why was he good
[40:35] why was Abraham going to be free because
[40:37] he was not going to be living in the
[40:39] land where his own natan his own natural
[40:43] being chose he wasn't going to be living
[40:47] in the land that his father chose he was
[40:52] going to be living in the land that God
[40:54] himself had chose he was going to be
[40:57] living in the land where the Holy Ghost
[40:59] was leading him step by step go Abraham
[41:05] wherever your footsteps will lead you
[41:08] that will be your possession this land
[41:11] was to be a Holy Ghost
[41:13] amen and that's where he's left them but
[41:16] the moment that God prophesied that to
[41:19] Abraham this is when the smoking light
[41:22] went in the midst of the sacrifice that
[41:25] God immediately said I am giving you the
[41:28] land but your children will leave this
[41:33] land they will serve in the land of
[41:38] Egypt in bondage for 400 years but I
[41:43] will bring them out by a mighty hand
[41:45] they will serve until the cup of the
[41:49] Lamb rights for their sins and their
[41:51] iniquities is full until I can judge
[41:55] them rights they will serve the enemy
[41:59] they'll be in bondage to the enemy but I
[42:01] will bring them out by a mighty hand
[42:04] amen so what happened the children Oh
[42:08] now remember when how did how did the
[42:10] chong'er of it of Abraham get to Egypt
[42:15] they got there in peace and prosperity
[42:20] they went to the land of Goshen they
[42:24] went to the place where all of God's
[42:27] blessings were upon them and God
[42:30] showered his blessings upon to them in
[42:33] the land of Egypt and Goshen as Joseph
[42:38] the great grandson of Abraham
[42:40] great-great grandson as Joseph left
[42:44] Egypt behind he called to his father
[42:47] come to meet with me and they went to
[42:50] the throne of Pharaoh and they stood
[42:54] before the throne of Pharaoh that
[42:55] Pharaoh said look over the entire land
[42:58] of Egypt I give you the best of the land
[43:02] and they went and they went down to
[43:05] Goshen and it was the best part of the
[43:08] land of Egypt this wasn't the best part
[43:11] of God's land this was not the best part
[43:14] of God's inheritance this is not the
[43:17] best part of the holy ghost land but for
[43:21] the time being they're giving the best
[43:22] of the land of Egypt it was a land of
[43:25] Goshen
[43:26] of bland where they can be at peace they
[43:29] could be at rest all of their needs were
[43:32] taken care of they lived at peace but
[43:36] for all of that peace that they had this
[43:39] was not the promised land this was not
[43:42] the holy ghost land doesn't matter how
[43:45] they keep the bow and they could build
[43:46] their house they might my mind
[43:48] look how God has blessed us look how God
[43:51] has taken care of our needs look how we
[43:54] we have our vats are flowing over we
[43:58] have money in the bank everywhere all of
[44:00] our needs are taken care of my the God
[44:03] of Abraham has taken care of us he is
[44:05] Jehovah Jireh oh my he is provided for
[44:09] all of our needs think how good our
[44:11] Jehovah God is to us living here in the
[44:14] land of goshen but for all of that they
[44:17] were not living in the land that was
[44:19] promised to them no matter how good the
[44:23] blessings were they were not living in
[44:27] the land that Jehovah promised them
[44:30] temporary blessings think about that
[44:34] temporary blessings you know all of us
[44:37] have temporary blessings you know we all
[44:40] have things that we enjoy upon this life
[44:43] that make our lives here a little bit
[44:45] more comfortable they make our lives a
[44:48] little bit more ease you know when we're
[44:51] driving down the interstate and the car
[44:53] gets a little too hot for us we just
[44:56] reach out our hand and turn the knob a
[44:59] few degrees and all of a sudden we begin
[45:03] to get a little bit more comfortable go
[45:06] in and we get a little too cold then we
[45:09] just reach out our hand and we turn the
[45:12] knob back the other direction and now we
[45:13] begin to get a little bit more
[45:15] comfortable
[45:16] we have temporary blessings we have
[45:19] things that God has given us on this
[45:22] land the benefits of civilization the
[45:27] fruits of mankind's labor upon this
[45:29] earth to live a little bit more
[45:31] comfortable and we enjoy those things we
[45:34] use those things but for all that there
[45:36] is something that within me there is
[45:39] crying out because I know
[45:40] oh that is not God's promised land that
[45:43] is not the promise that God has given us
[45:46] we are going to a land where the lamb is
[45:49] the light amen I can walk into my house
[45:52] where it is dark and I'll go and all
[45:55] turn on the light switch so I can walk
[45:59] in the light but it's not supposed to be
[46:01] that way I'm supposed to live in a land
[46:04] where the lamb is the light that is my
[46:06] promise so that's a temporary blessing I
[46:09] enjoy that blessing but the Bible says
[46:12] if your riches increase set not your
[46:16] heart
[46:16] upon them why because that will be a
[46:19] snare unto you and it'll take you away
[46:23] from the desire for the promised land
[46:26] and set your desire upon the land of
[46:30] comfort instead you can live in Goshen
[46:33] living in the land of comfort but you
[46:37] don't have the land of promise
[46:39] Goshen will fail you now let's think
[46:42] about what happened to them in Goshen
[46:44] they lived there in peace and
[46:47] tranquility until until until God began
[46:57] to make their lives a little
[46:58] uncomfortable I think now brothers
[47:01] you've got all that you have need of you
[47:04] you're living in comfort you have a
[47:05] promise but the thing is is they weren't
[47:07] living in the promised land so then God
[47:09] had to make their lives a little
[47:12] uncomfortable he said you'll live here
[47:14] for 400 years and you'll live there in
[47:17] bondage but I'm gonna bring you out
[47:19] under a mighty hand amen amen so what
[47:24] caused the cry God did what caused the
[47:29] children of Israel to cry out unto the
[47:31] Lord God caused that cry I say no
[47:35] brother would what God caused the cry
[47:37] now I want you to think about it
[47:39] remember Hannah in the Old Testament she
[47:43] wanted a baby you know what the Bible
[47:46] says about her womb says God shut her
[47:50] wound
[47:53] went into the temple and cried out to
[47:56] the Lord but what caused the cry God
[47:59] caused the cry so that God could be the
[48:03] answer
[48:04] amen what about Jonah who created the
[48:08] fish that Jonah went into God created
[48:13] that fish a special fish
[48:15] a man was Jonah crying out in that whale
[48:17] you better believe John was crying out
[48:19] in that whale he had a lot of symptoms
[48:22] as brother Bram said but his cry went
[48:24] into the ears of the Lord
[48:26] you know God sometimes has to bring us
[48:28] to a place where we begin to cry out to
[48:31] him Amen it's a shame that we get that
[48:34] way there's just something about mankind
[48:36] that that we get so comfortable living
[48:39] outside of God's promises that God has
[48:42] to bring something in our lives to make
[48:45] us cry out unto Him amen now when when
[48:50] we begin to cry God's people there's
[48:56] something funny about God's people is
[48:58] when they crowd to the Lord they always
[49:00] cry out for a partial a partial
[49:05] deliverance that's just the way people
[49:09] are God's people when they cry out it's
[49:12] very rare to find anybody that's gonna
[49:14] cry out for a total deliverance they're
[49:17] always going to cry out lord save me
[49:20] deliver me from my task maskers so I can
[49:23] go back to Goshen and live in peace
[49:29] isn't that how it goes well I want the
[49:32] deliverance without the pain but God
[49:35] always has to bring a certain way God
[49:37] leads you by a certain path to make sure
[49:40] that you get a total deliverance amen
[49:44] he's not going to bring you the easy way
[49:46] he's going to bring you in a way because
[49:48] if you ever once if your cry ever comes
[49:51] before the throne of the Lord and it
[49:53] will if your cry ever gets there it will
[49:56] he is going to bring a response but that
[50:00] response is to bring a total deliverance
[50:04] it's always going to be for
[50:07] complete and total deliverance God's
[50:09] vision is perfection God's vision is
[50:14] completeness God's vision is perfection
[50:17] but it's not going to come the way that
[50:19] you think is going to come amen remember
[50:22] there in Romans it says that the Holy
[50:24] Spirit searches the hearts amen and when
[50:28] he searches your heart
[50:30] he brings a groaning that cannot be
[50:34] expressed to God amen so now first you
[50:38] were crying
[50:39] but now the Holy Spirit Himself is
[50:41] crying but let me tell you the Holy
[50:44] Spirit when the Holy Spirit begins to
[50:46] cry out for you he's not crying out for
[50:48] you according to your desires he's not
[50:52] crying out according to your wishes he's
[50:55] not crying out for the things that you
[50:56] want the Bible says he cries out for you
[50:59] according to the will of God my so so
[51:06] what was the end result of your cry now
[51:10] you've got the Holy Spirit's attention
[51:12] now you have the Holy Spirit's full
[51:15] attention upon you why because you are
[51:17] groaning you are crying out you are
[51:20] suffering and you said O Lord save me O
[51:23] Lord deliver me O Lord heal me O Lord
[51:26] take me away these things out of my life
[51:29] Lord I'm sinning Lord I'm failing Lord
[51:32] I'm doing this wrong Lord I'm doing that
[51:34] wrong lord I need deliverance Lord I
[51:37] need this loretty that and your cry
[51:39] inches up to the Lord of Heaven and now
[51:41] a sudden the whole you got the Holy
[51:43] Spirit's attention the eyes of heaven
[51:47] are upon you and he sees you crying out
[51:50] there why does he do now the Holy Spirit
[51:53] joins in with you and he begins groaning
[51:56] he begins crying but he hasn't grown out
[52:00] Lord send him back to Goshen and peace
[52:02] Lord sent him back speaking of there he
[52:04] says Lord shake that man down shake him
[52:08] out of his own self will shake him out
[52:12] of his own ideas shake him how his own
[52:14] desires bring him down to his knees so
[52:17] he can be a total deliverance bring him
[52:21] act into compliance with the will of God
[52:26] how does a man get into compliance with
[52:29] the will of God how does that happen
[52:33] because God's will will not mix with
[52:36] your will it doesn't it will not work
[52:39] that way
[52:40] so if you ever find yourself in a
[52:43] position where you're crying out to God
[52:46] for something let me assure you that
[52:49] God's first step is going to find as to
[52:52] search your life and find out if you're
[52:54] in compliance with the will of God my
[52:59] what would think about that what would
[53:02] happen in your life right now if the
[53:04] Holy Spirit were to search your heart
[53:06] and look to see if you're in compliance
[53:08] with the will of God Arab become a great
[53:13] shaking there come a great what why is
[53:16] why a shaking because if you're not in
[53:18] compliance with the will of God he's got
[53:20] to shake you down to nothing
[53:22] before he can build you back up so the
[53:26] end result of your crying is that your
[53:31] situation gets worse lower I cried out
[53:36] for healing I'll cry out for deliverance
[53:38] yes but God is determined to bring you
[53:41] to his will to bring you to his desire
[53:44] oh I wanted to be healed oh I wanted to
[53:46] be delivered but now I seem like I'm
[53:48] getting worse I seem like it's faintly I
[53:51] seems like it's not working no God is
[53:52] just trying to get you to die he's
[53:55] trying to get you to the place where you
[53:57] can finally be like job and die out and
[54:01] have the nothing but lord save me think
[54:06] about it
[54:07] how I ain't here would love to have a
[54:09] job experience who here would love to
[54:15] have a job experience your bank account
[54:18] it's gone your children your family it's
[54:23] gone everything's you have your wife is
[54:27] turned against you it's gone but God is
[54:32] trying to conform you
[54:34] to his will my powerful say brother
[54:39] that's that's not a very fury sermon but
[54:45] this is how God at this is how he
[54:47] operates God has a vision of you that
[54:51] has been of old before the foundations
[54:54] of the world amen and that vision he
[54:57] doesn't want anything to get in the way
[54:59] of that vision amen and when you begin
[55:02] to cry out to God he first goes back to
[55:06] what the vision was amen and then he
[55:09] looks why because that vision is his
[55:11] will for you God has a will for your
[55:14] life amen but if you are not living in
[55:17] compliance to the vision in compliance
[55:20] to the will then guys got to shake you
[55:22] down for a while to bring you back to a
[55:26] total deliverance amen remember if God
[55:29] ever wants his gonna deliver you he's
[55:31] not here for a half-hearted deliverance
[55:33] amen God doesn't do that God is not
[55:37] interested in half Christians hey I
[55:40] wanted to read a quote brother Branham
[55:42] when he was a preaching there in a total
[55:49] deliverance he says just like you he
[55:53] says if you are a Christian God don't
[55:57] make any halfway Christians my God
[56:03] doesn't make halfway Christians we can
[56:06] try to be halfway but that's not God's
[56:07] idea and when you try to be halfway
[56:10] about it let me tell you there is going
[56:13] to be a sharp correction coming down the
[56:15] road why because God has a vision for
[56:18] your life
[56:18] and it's not your vision it's his Amen
[56:22] God makes complete Christians he said
[56:27] God don't make halfway preachers but the
[56:31] preacher can be halfway and God makes
[56:34] his children Christians but sometimes
[56:37] they're halfway Christians it's not
[56:41] God's intention for them to be that way
[56:43] it's just their own ways got mixed up
[56:47] with the
[56:48] of God for their life my a blending took
[56:52] place they took their ways they mixed it
[56:56] with God's ways and they tried to march
[56:59] forward amen
[57:01] and that's what makes them the way they
[57:04] are God doesn't want them to be halfway
[57:07] Christians or halfway preachers
[57:09] compromising on either side he wants
[57:12] them to stand completely in the breech
[57:14] he wants them to stand completely saw
[57:17] right they're rock solid Christians amen
[57:21] living in the promises of God amen but
[57:23] let me tell you if you're ever once
[57:25] going to be in the promised land God if
[57:27] you're if God is ever going to take you
[57:29] to the promised land where all this
[57:31] promises are made manifest God's first
[57:35] guy get you out of the way that's just
[57:38] the way it is Saints say oh I would love
[57:41] to live in the power of God and see his
[57:43] manifestations I'd love to see how he
[57:45] heels how he delivers how he sets free
[57:48] amen let me tell you you got to die and
[57:50] rot before you ever get to that place
[57:52] hey man you got to die and rot before
[57:54] you ever get there amen it's just the
[57:57] same way God does not make halfway
[58:00] Christians he just will not do it amen
[58:03] he just will not do it amen no God has a
[58:07] habit of listening to the cries of his
[58:10] people amen you know he judged Sodom and
[58:13] Gomorrah because the cries of the land
[58:15] came up to him amen they were oppressing
[58:18] the people in life the people were
[58:20] suffering amen but what'd he do he
[58:22] brought the deliverance but no one
[58:25] really wanted to be delivered Amen think
[58:27] about it he judged no no he came down he
[58:31] sent the angels to Sodom and Gomorrah
[58:34] because of the cries of the people the
[58:38] cries ended up before the Lord but who
[58:40] wanted to be delivered no one really
[58:45] wanted to be delivered
[58:49] they had to drag them out kicking and
[58:51] screaming the few that came lot and his
[58:54] daughters but no one really wanted to be
[58:57] delivered now they cried because of the
[59:00] witness of the city they cry because the
[59:03] oppression of wickedness they cry
[59:05] because their house got broken into they
[59:07] cry because their family was ravished
[59:09] they cry because of this they cry
[59:11] because of that but when the deliverer
[59:13] came they would not follow the
[59:15] deliverance out and they ended up dying
[59:17] in the fire God sent the judgment upon
[59:21] Sodom and Gomorrah because the cries of
[59:24] sodom and gomorrah entered into his ears
[59:27] a man but who got delivered very few let
[59:31] me tell you not everybody that cried in
[59:34] sodom and gomorrah got deliverance from
[59:36] songs more actually their cry instead
[59:38] brought judgment down upon themselves
[59:41] that's powerful think about that your
[59:46] own cry can bring judgment upon you and
[59:49] there is no no consolation that you will
[59:53] actually be delivered why because it
[59:56] only comes by a total submission Amy
[1:00:00] there's a lot of people crying to God
[1:00:02] all over the world but when God does
[1:00:05] come to deliver them if they do not come
[1:00:07] out and then what's next
[1:00:08] judgement we can we can cry out about
[1:00:13] faith and the power of God in our lives
[1:00:15] all day long seven ways to Sunday aim it
[1:00:18] we can cry out all day long for the
[1:00:20] deliverance of God amen but when the
[1:00:23] deliverer comes he is coming to take you
[1:00:26] out of living in your in your hot off
[1:00:29] your high horse he's coming to take you
[1:00:31] out of living according to your will
[1:00:33] he's coming to deliver you from yourself
[1:00:36] from your own fleshly waste he's coming
[1:00:39] to deliver you from the nature of the
[1:00:41] beast amen that's what he's coming to do
[1:00:46] and when that deliverer arrives at your
[1:00:49] doorstep when the cry of the deliverer
[1:00:52] enters into your ears when you're
[1:00:54] sitting there and all sudden you hear
[1:00:56] the cry of the deliverer come out of her
[1:00:59] my people because you've been crying
[1:01:01] unto them for healing you've been
[1:01:03] to him for salvation you've been crying
[1:01:06] into him because you're beginning to get
[1:01:07] a little uncomfortable
[1:01:10] why because Goshen has now become
[1:01:13] bondage amen that which was peace unto
[1:01:16] you in Egypt now is becoming bondage in
[1:01:19] your life and you're beginning to get a
[1:01:21] little uncomfortable you're beginning to
[1:01:24] get a little oh I don't like this oh I
[1:01:26] don't like that Lord I wish you would
[1:01:27] save me Lord I wish you to deliver me
[1:01:30] but once the deliverer comes and starts
[1:01:32] preaching in your ear let me tell you
[1:01:34] you better listen to what he has to say
[1:01:36] amen because those that were in Sodom
[1:01:39] and Gomorrah did the same thing they
[1:01:42] cried out for the oppression of the
[1:01:44] wickedness but when the deliverers came
[1:01:47] they would not listen they would not
[1:01:49] hearken they would not they would not
[1:01:51] get their deliverance instead they were
[1:01:53] those that cried to God receive God's
[1:01:57] judgment that's powerful as a dangerous
[1:02:02] thing I think go to the Christian
[1:02:06] bookstore look up and down the shelves
[1:02:08] they all will tell you how to believe
[1:02:11] for God's deliverance how to receive
[1:02:14] God's deliverance but the messenger
[1:02:17] comes he's coming to bring you to his
[1:02:22] perfect will he's coming to get you to
[1:02:25] live in accordance with the vision what
[1:02:28] was the vision for this day it's a
[1:02:30] message a message window a message a
[1:02:36] last day message went out to the people
[1:02:38] why did the last day message come out
[1:02:40] because those that are living in comfort
[1:02:45] we're getting ready to go into bondage
[1:02:48] those that are living in a city that has
[1:02:51] no walls
[1:02:52] remember Jerusalem they're living in a
[1:02:55] city they had no walls they were living
[1:02:57] in a place of comfort they were living
[1:02:59] in a place of comfort and God says
[1:03:01] armories gonna come upon them suddenly
[1:03:03] in America we are living in a land that
[1:03:06] has no walls living in a peace crying
[1:03:09] out but we're living in comfort outside
[1:03:11] of the will of God so God sends a
[1:03:15] message God always sends a message
[1:03:17] time amen so when the message came that
[1:03:22] people have a choice they can live in
[1:03:23] obedience to the will of God to the
[1:03:25] vision of the day to the message of the
[1:03:28] hour
[1:03:29] or they can ignore it and keep crying
[1:03:33] out to God for deliverance to go back in
[1:03:38] peace but living in Goshen they want to
[1:03:42] go back and live in peace and Egypt
[1:03:44] God's trying to bring them to the land
[1:03:46] of the promise
[1:03:47] but they want to stay in Egypt amen they
[1:03:51] want just enough deliverance to make
[1:03:53] them comfortable again but not enough
[1:03:54] deliverance to go to the land of all the
[1:03:56] promises bye
[1:04:04] Hannah was crying out gosh shut her
[1:04:08] wound
[1:04:08] I tell the cry got they went up year by
[1:04:12] year every year they go up to Shiloh
[1:04:14] they'd worship the Lord they go home and
[1:04:16] the next year that she'd cry a little
[1:04:18] bit stronger and then they'd go home the
[1:04:21] next year they'd cry a little bit
[1:04:22] stronger but God got her to the place
[1:04:24] where she had gotten down on her knees
[1:04:26] she was crying out to the Lord Lord I
[1:04:29] need a child Lord I need a look this is
[1:04:33] the burden of my heart I'm crying out
[1:04:35] Lord and Eli the priest look learners
[1:04:37] this is a drunk woman what happened she
[1:04:40] got to the place where she was crying
[1:04:41] out to God the cry got she had finally
[1:04:44] given up on everything in her life and
[1:04:47] said Lord if you'd if you don't give me
[1:04:50] a child I'll perish why the child was
[1:04:53] the promised God and when the cry got to
[1:04:56] a certain place to a certain condition
[1:04:58] to where he knew she had died out to
[1:05:00] herself then God brought the promise and
[1:05:03] brought her to the promised land amen so
[1:05:06] many people do not like the Pentecostal
[1:05:10] way of crying out for the Holy Ghost it
[1:05:13] offends them the the Baptist's are
[1:05:18] offended at the Pentecostal message why
[1:05:24] are they offended when the Pentecostal
[1:05:27] message came in 1906 why were the
[1:05:30] Baptist's
[1:05:31] offended that message because they said
[1:05:34] we do not have to cry out for the Holy
[1:05:37] Ghost we automatically get it without
[1:05:39] crane oh we don't have to cry to the
[1:05:43] Lord we get to live here in comfort and
[1:05:46] so they were offended at the message and
[1:05:49] so they've gone on in that offense and
[1:05:52] in that offense crying out against the
[1:05:54] Pentecostal walk why because they didn't
[1:05:56] want to cry out for the promise God has
[1:05:59] to bring his people to a place where
[1:06:02] they will cry out it's God's Way it's
[1:06:05] God's way God has to shake us off of our
[1:06:08] high horse when we live in things that
[1:06:11] we know that are wrong and yet we
[1:06:13] continue to do them anyway then God has
[1:06:16] a great shaking ahead in store for you a
[1:06:18] man and there's no guarantee that you're
[1:06:22] going to to be saved or not be saying
[1:06:24] unless your name you'll it written upon
[1:06:26] the Lamb's Book of Life amen but you
[1:06:29] have to find that out for yourself
[1:06:31] amen amen
[1:06:35] many people are happy to live in bondage
[1:06:38] they want just enough comfort just
[1:06:41] enough comfort they do they're satisfied
[1:06:44] with not living in the Promised Land
[1:06:45] they really don't want to go to the
[1:06:47] promised land they would rather just
[1:06:49] live in bondage because it's a little
[1:06:50] bit easier they don't have to die out
[1:06:52] it's easier for their flesh it's harder
[1:06:55] for their spirit they try to find that
[1:06:57] balance that's not God's way God's
[1:07:00] response to the cries of the people is
[1:07:03] always I will bring you a total
[1:07:06] deliverance but it will be according to
[1:07:09] my will
[1:07:10] amen and my will is my word amen you
[1:07:14] will come in compliance to my word to my
[1:07:17] message why every time your cry comes
[1:07:24] the holy spirits are crying but he
[1:07:27] checks your life by the word and by the
[1:07:31] promise guaranteed if you've ever once
[1:07:35] cry out to Lord for something he did
[1:07:38] come and he searched your heart amen and
[1:07:41] he's and he's groaning out for you to
[1:07:44] bring you back in
[1:07:45] compliance to the word and to the
[1:07:47] promise how does he do it
[1:07:49] he has many ways that he can do it and
[1:07:51] they're not always easy amen but they
[1:07:54] all involve dying out they all involve
[1:07:57] dying out to yourself amen
[1:08:00] if you refuse that message when he comes
[1:08:03] and speaks in your ears he can leave you
[1:08:06] behind for years years there's no
[1:08:10] guarantee that he'll come back
[1:08:11] amen when people reject that when the
[1:08:15] message comes amen he comes because you
[1:08:19] cried amen but when the messenger comes
[1:08:21] and you reject that message there is no
[1:08:24] guarantee you ever get a second chance
[1:08:25] you could just live laissez-faire until
[1:08:30] the Judgment Day comes that's a scary
[1:08:34] thing amen amen amen God's expectation
[1:08:45] for your life is always a willingness
[1:08:51] for a full deliverance every time that's
[1:08:56] God's expectation God's expectation for
[1:09:00] your life every single time you cry is
[1:09:04] that you will have a willingness for a
[1:09:08] full deliverance through dying out to
[1:09:10] yourself that's the message my you die
[1:09:15] out to yourself you have to do it
[1:09:18] there's just no other way Amen let's
[1:09:20] turn her to job chapter 36
[1:09:38] I'm just going really slow this morning
[1:09:40] I just want this to seek in deeply we've
[1:09:44] all cried to the Lord but we've all
[1:09:48] cried half-heartedly the Lord before too
[1:09:50] and it's not our position to cry
[1:09:56] half-heartedly to the Lord if we ever
[1:09:59] once cry to Lord we have to expect that
[1:10:01] God will bring a full and complete
[1:10:03] deliverance and they'll be according to
[1:10:06] his will which will not match up
[1:10:08] necessarily with your will amen
[1:10:12] Joe chapter 36 verse 5 we're going to
[1:10:16] read the next eleven verses here just
[1:10:18] going to go through them one by one
[1:10:21] verse job 36 five it says behold God is

[1:10:40] get anything if you don't first know

[1:10:44] know that he's Almighty he is completely
[1:10:47] able to fulfill your deliverance he is
[1:10:51] completely able to give you the total
[1:10:54] deliverance that you are looking for he

[1:11:19] that he is able to bring you to a place
[1:11:24] to where you were completely died out
[1:11:26] and a prisoner to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:29] if only you will he's able he's mighty
[1:11:33] he can do it that which he starts in
[1:11:36] your life he will always be able to
[1:11:38] finish amen if you will amen
[1:11:43] behold God is mighty and despise us not
[1:11:46] any nobody no one he will not despise
[1:11:50] you
[1:11:51] he is mighty in strength and wisdom but
[1:11:55] verse 6 he preserveth not the life of
[1:11:59] the wicked but giveth right to the poor
[1:12:02] he was draweth not his eyes from the
[1:12:05] righteous but with Kings are they on the
[1:12:08] throne the righteous will reign with the
[1:12:10] kings amen
[1:12:13] yeah he does establish them forever and
[1:12:16] they're exalted but look at verse 8 and
[1:12:20] if they let's talking about the
[1:12:22] righteous if they be bound in fetters
[1:12:26] and holding in cords of afflictions you
[1:12:30] know the righteous could ever get like
[1:12:31] that
[1:12:32] yeah they can get like that that could
[1:12:34] happen to the righteous amen if they
[1:12:36] ever be bound in fetters and hold and
[1:12:38] cords of affliction verse 9 then he show
[1:12:42] us them their works he show us them
[1:12:44] their transgressions that they have
[1:12:47] exceeded and he openeth also their ears
[1:12:51] to discipline and he commandeth that

[1:12:58] blessing that is a blessing that the
[1:13:01] righteous he'll open up their ears to
[1:13:04] that he's given them a chance to repent
[1:13:06] God always gives the righteous an
[1:13:08] opportunity to repent from your sentence
[1:13:11] from your iniquities from doing the
[1:13:13] things that are wrong
[1:13:14] anytime you've exceeded the Word of God
[1:13:16] gone past what the word told you to do
[1:13:19] he's going to give you a message to come

[1:14:49] days and prosperities and their years
[1:14:52] and pleasures what is that that's not
[1:14:57] going
[1:14:58] oh no no don't don't don't
[1:15:01] are you thinking though if your mind
[1:15:03] went to Goshen right there that's not
[1:15:06] the case he's taking you to the promised
[1:15:08] land hey man he's going to wear all the
[1:15:11] promises he's not gonna restore Goshen
[1:15:14] to you he's gonna restore the land of
[1:15:17] the promise to you amen that's the
[1:15:20] prosperity that you will get a man you
[1:15:23] live at peace and the Holy Ghost
[1:15:25] wherever the Holy Ghost lives and moves
[1:15:27] the Holy Ghost is like the wind nobody
[1:15:31] knows where he's coming from nobody
[1:15:33] knows where he's going and so is
[1:15:35] everybody that's led by the Holy Ghost
[1:15:37] they are know where he's coming from
[1:15:39] they don't know where they're going they
[1:15:41] might work here for a while and go over
[1:15:43] there they may they may they may they
[1:15:45] may a commute communion with this group
[1:15:48] people for a while and then withdraw
[1:15:50] themselves and go over here
[1:15:51] amen they may they may be witness to
[1:15:54] this person for a while they may go
[1:15:55] witness this person for a while amen
[1:15:57] they had no one knows where the Holy
[1:15:59] Ghost sled man is gonna go why because
[1:16:01] he's being led by the Holy Ghost like
[1:16:04] the wind he comes and he goes he's no
[1:16:06] one knows how he's going no one can
[1:16:08] judge him because he's being led by the
[1:16:11] Holy Ghost amen sometimes he might go
[1:16:13] through a hard time but that's okay he's
[1:16:15] being led by the Holy Ghost God might
[1:16:17] pair his life down
[1:16:19] nothing but he'll rejoice I'm being led
[1:16:23] by the holy ghost that's what God does
[1:16:26] that's who he is
[1:16:27] that's how he acts amen if they obey and
[1:16:33] serve Him they shall spend their days
[1:16:34] and prosperity in their years and
[1:16:36] pleasures verse 12 but if they obey not
[1:16:42] they perish by the sword they shall die
[1:16:46] without knowledge Amen they won't even
[1:16:49] know it'll die they won't even
[1:16:52] understand
[1:16:53] they won't even realize why they're
[1:16:55] going through the things that they're
[1:16:57] going through with not that knowledge
[1:16:59] will be held away from them why because
[1:17:01] of their disobedience
[1:17:03] that's the deceitfulness of disobedience
[1:17:07] that you could actually die in your sins
[1:17:10] without ever realizing why the holy
[1:17:13] ghost never led you that's powerful if
[1:17:17] you ever get to the promised land let me
[1:17:19] know assuredly you'll get there by the
[1:17:20] leadership of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:17:23] but the man that refuses the leadership
[1:17:26] of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:27] he will die without knowledge won't even
[1:17:30] know why he never made it to the
[1:17:33] promised land until he gets up to the
[1:17:36] white throne judgment and he also
[1:17:37] realizes because you rejected my message
[1:17:41] when I came to deliver you I came to
[1:17:44] pull you out I came I said oh come out
[1:17:46] of her my people that you be not
[1:17:48] partakers of her sins but you would not
[1:17:52] my they died without knowledge amen
[1:18:02] verse 13 but the hypocrites in heart
[1:18:06] heap up wrath now what are the
[1:18:09] hypocrites in heart they are they that
[1:18:12] these are those that say they are
[1:18:15] Christians but all the time every time
[1:18:20] they have a chance to go back to the
[1:18:22] word they go back and they do something
[1:18:25] else instead they say that they are one
[1:18:28] thing but they're going and they're
[1:18:29] doing something different they say
[1:18:31] they're in compliance with the Word of
[1:18:33] God when they call themselves Christians
[1:18:35] but in their mind they never actually
[1:18:38] choose by their own will to bring
[1:18:40] themselves in subjection to the word my
[1:18:44] God calls them hypocrites amen let's
[1:18:48] read that again verse verse 12 but or
[1:18:51] verse 13 but the hypocrites in heart
[1:18:53] heap up wrath and they cry not when he
[1:18:57] binded them who binds him God knows God
[1:19:02] allows or he'd rather he allows Satan to
[1:19:05] bind them but no matter what God is the
[1:19:08] one that allows it
[1:19:09] amen and what happens they don't even
[1:19:12] know it
[1:19:13] they are bound they cannot be free they
[1:19:16] will stay in Sodom and Gomorrah why
[1:19:18] because they will not receive the
[1:19:20] freedom when it comes therefore they're
[1:19:22] bound in iniquities and how can they
[1:19:25] ever be set free how can they and look
[1:19:28] their cry they still cry these are a
[1:19:32] people that they will still cry because
[1:19:35] of their bondage amen but what does it
[1:19:37] say about their cry they cry not when he
[1:19:41] binds them now they will cry later in
[1:19:44] their bondage but they don't even cry
[1:19:46] what he's they don't mind that God is
[1:19:49] binding them in their bondage now later
[1:19:53] when it affects their well-being they'll
[1:19:55] cry but think about right here
[1:19:56] they don't why don't they cry when he's
[1:19:59] binding them because they love their
[1:20:01] sins they love their iniquities they
[1:20:06] love the things that they're doing wrong
[1:20:08] so much that they don't even mind that
[1:20:11] the binds are getting stronger their
[1:20:14] arms are getting pulled tighter
[1:20:15] and they don't cry out for the sins
[1:20:19] because they enjoy them too much and so
[1:20:23] they do not cry when they're being bound
[1:20:25] they'll cry later after they're after
[1:20:28] the binding is finished they will cry
[1:20:29] God won't hear their cry unless say
[1:20:34] unless God grants them mercy God won't
[1:20:36] hear their cry my that's strong words
[1:20:41] that's a strong word that's a strong
[1:20:43] message they will not cry when they're
[1:20:46] being bound because they enjoy their
[1:20:48] sins too much verse 14 they die in youth
[1:21:01] and their life is among the unclean they
[1:21:07] die while they're young they never come
[1:21:11] to perfection they never come to
[1:21:14] completion they never come to the vision
[1:21:17] that God had for them and they lived
[1:21:22] their life amongst those that are
[1:21:23] unclean they can't come amongst the
[1:21:26] believers why they're bound in their
[1:21:29] sins their sins pulled them away from
[1:21:31] the believers and that's where they live
[1:21:32] all their days going on to judgment and
[1:21:36] they don't even won't even know won't
[1:21:38] even won't even have their ears open to
[1:21:40] know that they are bound amen
[1:21:44] that's a solemn message the
[1:21:48] deceitfulness of our sins the
[1:21:50] deceitfulness of iniquity
[1:21:52] Satan is coming as a roaring lion
[1:21:54] seeking whom he may devour amen and he
[1:21:57] always lays a little sin across your
[1:22:00] path something small for you step into
[1:22:02] you to see if you will leave the word to
[1:22:05] behind and walk into that comfort that
[1:22:07] he's laid before and when he sees you
[1:22:09] take the first step he knows uh-huh I
[1:22:12] can lead this man amen and as he and he
[1:22:15] just goes he'll lay one that's just a
[1:22:17] little bit further out of the way and a
[1:22:20] little bit further out of the way you
[1:22:21] don't even know you're being slow walked
[1:22:23] away you don't even know that you're
[1:22:25] being bound don't even know that you're
[1:22:27] being bound
[1:22:29] until all sudden you wake up in your
[1:22:31] eyes I'm not even free I don't have the
[1:22:34] freedom of a Holy Ghost
[1:22:35] someday you'll see a man there's walking
[1:22:38] in the freedom of the Holy Ghost and you
[1:22:40] realize that there's a vast difference
[1:22:42] between you and him you look at a man
[1:22:46] that's filled with the Holy Ghost being
[1:22:48] led by the Holy Ghost you like why can't
[1:22:51] I be like that brother because you're
[1:22:53] bound your sins your iniquities have
[1:22:56] bound you and you cannot be free why
[1:22:59] can't I be like so-and-so
[1:23:01] why can't have the faith to cry out to
[1:23:03] God why can't I have the deliverance for
[1:23:06] my oh I'm sick I can't be healed
[1:23:08] I need deliverance I can't get rid of
[1:23:10] this I can't grow that why because
[1:23:11] you're bound you didn't cry out for the
[1:23:15] sins now you're gonna be forced to cry
[1:23:18] out for the consequences why if God ever
[1:23:28] once convicts you for your sins
[1:23:30] remember the righteous we set out he'll
[1:23:32] open up their ears and give them a
[1:23:34] chance to repent amen that's the time to
[1:23:37] repent otherwise you play the heart of
[1:23:39] the part of the hypocrite amen and you
[1:23:42] how can you get to the land of promise
[1:23:44] how can you ever get there remember
[1:23:47] God's expectation is always that you
[1:23:49] will have a willingness for a total and
[1:23:54] complete deliverance that is God's
[1:23:57] expectation for your life if you do not
[1:24:00] have that willingness for a complete
[1:24:02] deliverance then God does not can't lead
[1:24:06] you to the promised land you want to go
[1:24:09] back to Goshen and live in peace but God
[1:24:12] is true bring on the bondage and sell
[1:24:14] you cry out to get out of that thing so
[1:24:18] that you can accept the message for your
[1:24:20] day amen a man we all know what the
[1:24:28] promises are but they don't come to
[1:24:30] people that are in bondage amen you know
[1:24:33] don't don't don't don't seek just the
[1:24:35] promises don't do it don't don't just
[1:24:38] cry out for the promises of God cry out
[1:24:40] for the deliverance from your sins
[1:24:43] cry out to be set free you got to get in
[1:24:45] order to get to the promised land God
[1:24:47] has to completely set you free otherwise
[1:24:52] you won't get there people say oh I God
[1:24:56] did this miracle and they'll rejoice and
[1:24:58] all the miracles and signs and wonders
[1:24:59] but don't you realize the children of
[1:25:02] Israel that died in the wilderness did
[1:25:03] the same thing and he could rejoice and
[1:25:05] all those signs and wonders so much but
[1:25:07] we got to we got to look for a total
[1:25:10] deliverance without that total
[1:25:12] deliverance we're lost since we're lost
[1:25:15] we can't get there we can't get where we
[1:25:17] were supposed to go without that total
[1:25:20] deliverance but God has a total
[1:25:22] deliverance for you amen amen let's turn
[1:25:26] to Hebrews chapter 11
[1:25:42] now Hebrews chapter 11 we call it the
[1:25:46] faith chapter has a description of a
[1:25:51] mini believers throughout history that
[1:25:56] received the message for their day and
[1:25:59] believed it and walked out now many
[1:26:05] people will take this chapter and they
[1:26:09] look at these these believers and they
[1:26:12] just say oh by faith they just had faith
[1:26:16] for the benefits but when you go back
[1:26:20] and read the lives of these people they
[1:26:23] didn't just have faith for the benefits
[1:26:26] they had faith for the total deliverance
[1:26:29] they had been shaken down to nothing and
[1:26:32] they believed in God alone that's the
[1:26:36] faith that they had there was not a
[1:26:38] half-hearted deliverance for them amen
[1:26:41] thinking that by faith Abel offered unto
[1:26:44] God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain
[1:26:46] but Abel had to get to some sufferings
[1:26:49] in order to do that
[1:26:51] amen by faith Enoch was translated they
[1:26:55] should see not death but in order for
[1:26:57] Enoch to get to that translation he had
[1:26:59] to walk with God isn't that right amen
[1:27:04] verse 6 it says but without faith is
[1:27:08] impossible to plead him to please him
[1:27:11] for he that cometh to God must believe
[1:27:13] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[1:27:16] them that diligently seek Him and that's
[1:27:20] what all these had in common is they are
[1:27:22] diligently seeking the Lord they became
[1:27:25] the righteous they were set up on the
[1:27:27] Thrones with the Kings a man and they
[1:27:29] reign here in Hebrews chapter 11 amen
[1:27:32] and it also says that they're not
[1:27:34] perfect without us we have to make the
[1:27:36] same choice amen we have to have the
[1:27:39] same total deliverance we have to accept
[1:27:41] the message for our day and walk out of
[1:27:44] it amen and walk into the promised land
[1:27:47] that God has laid in store for us
[1:27:49] God is waiting for you to cry unto Him
[1:27:53] amen and when you cry he
[1:27:56] we'll begin to cry for you to bring you
[1:27:58] into obedience to his will
[1:28:02] amen and you have to be ready for that
[1:28:04] I want you to think about that every
[1:28:07] time you are suffering in your body in
[1:28:10] your spirit in your mind amen and you
[1:28:13] get down on your knees because you're
[1:28:15] suffering that you remember you are
[1:28:18] setting in motion a chain of events it's
[1:28:22] guaranteed it's got to happen it's going
[1:28:25] to happen your cry will go up into the
[1:28:29] ears of the Lord and enter into his
[1:28:30] temple it'll enter into his temple where
[1:28:33] the blood of the Lamb is laying upon the
[1:28:35] altar and as your cry enters into his
[1:28:39] ears the Holy Spirit will come down and
[1:28:43] he will search your heart a halo look at
[1:28:47] your heart and then when the Holy Spirit
[1:28:48] has searched your heart and he's looked
[1:28:51] around and all the doors of your heart
[1:28:53] and he's looked at all things in there
[1:28:55] then he begins to cry out with utterance
[1:28:58] and groanings that cannot even be
[1:29:00] understood and as that Holy Spirit
[1:29:02] begins to cry out oh my Jehovah God he
[1:29:08] has this wrong in his life he's doing
[1:29:10] this over here he's not in obedience to
[1:29:13] the message over here he's not doing
[1:29:15] this
[1:29:15] he is diseased he's being loose he's
[1:29:19] being slothful he's groaning Oh Lord
[1:29:22] Oh Lord bring him back to compliance
[1:29:24] bring him back to the Word of God bring
[1:29:26] him back to restore him to righteousness
[1:29:28] and he's bringing you he's crying out
[1:29:30] unto you according to the will of God to
[1:29:34] bring your heart into back to the will
[1:29:39] of God and now when the Holy Spirit
[1:29:42] begins to cry out for you they're all
[1:29:44] son it sets into motion a chain of
[1:29:47] events that will do one of two things
[1:29:50] that chain of events will either bring
[1:29:53] you into submission to a willingness for
[1:29:57] a total deliverance or will bring you to
[1:30:01] a hardness of heart so you can go out to
[1:30:04] the judgment that's powerful
[1:30:08] what caused it you did you cried out to
[1:30:12] the Lord and that's what happened say
[1:30:15] brother where is that in the scriptures
[1:30:17] that's her to Romans chapter 8
[1:30:29] romans chapter 8 verse 26
[1:30:38] likewise the spirit also helpeth our
[1:30:41] infirmities for we know not what we
[1:30:45] should pray for as we ought but the
[1:30:48] Spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[1:30:51] with groanings that which cannot be
[1:30:54] uttered no one can pray like the spirit
[1:30:57] prays for you amen
[1:31:00] but he will do it amen thank God he does
[1:31:04] do it
[1:31:04] amen well verse 27 and he that searches
[1:31:09] the hearts knoweth what is the mind of
[1:31:12] the Spirit because he makes intercession
[1:31:15] for the Saints according to the will of
[1:31:19] God
[1:31:21] so our infirmities causes us to pray but
[1:31:26] we don't necessarily know how to pray
[1:31:27] what do you mean we don't know how to
[1:31:29] pray because we'll pray against the will
[1:31:31] of God we'll do it
[1:31:34] we will pray against a little gun but if
[1:31:37] we say Lord let thy will be done and
[1:31:39] guaranteed the Holy Spirit's coming he's
[1:31:41] coming to search your heart amen and to
[1:31:43] groan for you to make intercession for
[1:31:45] you according to the will of God but if
[1:31:47] you're not walking in the will of God
[1:31:49] then he will bring forth a complete and
[1:31:54] total deliverance for you but if you
[1:31:57] don't want to be delivered then you'll
[1:31:59] be driven further away from God that's
[1:32:04] I'm telling you this is what happens
[1:32:07] when you pray when you cry out to the
[1:32:09] Lord this is what happens
[1:32:10] we don't always realize that this is
[1:32:12] what's happening but this is what
[1:32:13] happens and God
[1:32:15] many people they'll cry out to God but
[1:32:17] they're never willing for a complete and
[1:32:20] total deliverance and they're not
[1:32:22] willing to come into compliance with the
[1:32:24] will of God or the Word of God so then
[1:32:26] they cry out and their cry actually
[1:32:28] drives them further away from the Lord
[1:32:39] let's read a ornery 1/4 brother
[1:32:41] branham's here another quote from a
[1:32:44] total deliverance he says and that's
[1:32:49] when the church shall be completely
[1:32:52] delivered when everything comes under
[1:32:55] the blood when your sins kind of come
[1:32:58] under the blood when you're smoking when
[1:33:01] you're gambling when you're cheating
[1:33:02] when you're stealing when you're lying
[1:33:05] when everything is brought under the
[1:33:07] blood then there will be a total
[1:33:09] deliverance you've wronged somebody make
[1:33:12] it right you can't bring that under the
[1:33:14] blood it won't stay you can't bring it
[1:33:16] something won't let you do it but when
[1:33:20] your self is completely totally brought
[1:33:22] under the blood there will be a total
[1:33:25] deliverance and then you'll have a
[1:33:27] freedom like you've never known before
[1:33:29] when everything is brought under the
[1:33:31] blood brought in submissive to the
[1:33:34] kingdom of God then there will be a real
[1:33:37] deliverance that's when it happens there
[1:33:40] we go amen total complete deliverance
[1:33:45] amen it can happen if you want it to if
[1:33:49] you will whosoever will let him come
[1:33:53] into me there's no what jesus said
[1:33:55] whosoever will let him come to me it
[1:33:57] sounds so simple but many just plain
[1:34:00] don't have the will they just don't have
[1:34:03] the will to submit themselves under God
[1:34:05] they can't come to the altar and cry out
[1:34:07] to him they don't have time for that
[1:34:10] they don't have time to cry out for God
[1:34:13] they don't have the they don't have time
[1:34:16] for it they don't they don't want to
[1:34:17] they just don't have the desire for it
[1:34:19] they they just and they'll never see it
[1:34:21] they won't see it because it's lost not
[1:34:23] for them if they because it's only for
[1:34:25] those who will whosoever will let them
[1:34:28] come if you have the will then you can
[1:34:30] come if you don't have the will you
[1:34:33] can't come you gotta have the fortitude
[1:34:35] of mind saying I am going all the way if
[1:34:39] I'm gonna take one step I'm gonna take
[1:34:41] all the steps amen because I'm going all
[1:34:44] the way I would need you to total
[1:34:46] deliverance I gotta have it I must have
[1:34:49] it
[1:34:50] whatever it takes I want a total
[1:34:52] deliverance got your cry to the Lord
[1:34:55] amen will bring God's response but God's
[1:34:58] response is always to bring you to a
[1:35:01] total deliverance Amen it's the only way
[1:35:03] it's the only thing that can happen it's
[1:35:06] the only way the guard can ever do it
[1:35:07] amen is to bring you to a total
[1:35:10] deliverance amen amen we know what the
[1:35:18] promises are but they don't come to
[1:35:20] people living in bondage
[1:35:21] they just won't do it they just can't do
[1:35:24] it when you're living in bondage you
[1:35:25] just cannot experience the promises the
[1:35:28] Lord you can't go to the promised land
[1:35:29] you can't not have it you have to have a
[1:35:32] total complete deliverance and you have
[1:35:34] to trust and who your deliverer is amen
[1:35:37] God will send you a deliverer amen but
[1:35:40] you have to submit to him everyone they
[1:35:42] cross that left Egypt in the Red Sea
[1:35:44] were baptized unto Moses amen and when
[1:35:47] they would not listen to Moses they were
[1:35:49] judged according to their baptism amen
[1:35:53] and so is the same with us every single
[1:35:55] one of us that was baptized into the
[1:35:57] name of the Lord Jesus Christ left our
[1:36:00] sickness life of sin behind amen and
[1:36:03] we'll be judged according to that
[1:36:04] baptism if we will not submit ourselves
[1:36:07] unto the Lord Jesus Christ your baptism
[1:36:10] will become judgment to you Amen why
[1:36:14] because you walked out through the Red
[1:36:15] Sea saying I will follow Moses
[1:36:18] everywhere he goes I will be obedient
[1:36:20] while he says you walked out through the
[1:36:22] water to the Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:36:24] Baptism he said I'll follow him
[1:36:26] everywhere he goes but then when his
[1:36:27] word comes oh I'll do this instead you
[1:36:30] will end up in the world dying in the
[1:36:32] wilderness judged because you would did
[1:36:34] were no disobedience to your own baptism
[1:36:38] my Amen when the cry comes he checks
[1:36:44] your life by the word and by the promise
[1:36:46] a man remember naman in the New
[1:36:50] Testament God told him dip in the door
[1:36:53] or dip in the river Jordan seven times a
[1:36:55] man the man was a Syrian and he says
[1:36:58] aren't the rivers in Syria better than
[1:37:00] the rivers in Jordan Amen why do I have
[1:37:03] to go to
[1:37:04] why do I have to go and dip in that one
[1:37:05] I don't want to dip there I am a king I
[1:37:08] am dressed to my royal clothes I have to
[1:37:11] disrobe myself in the presence of my the
[1:37:14] enemy's land amen
[1:37:16] I have to disrobe myself amongst the
[1:37:18] Israelis amidst amongst the Jews amen I
[1:37:22] don't want to put myself a humble myself
[1:37:25] before then why should I do it by his
[1:37:27] services but if he had asked you to do
[1:37:30] some great thing and give a million
[1:37:31] dollars or do this whenever you've done
[1:37:33] it but he asked you to just humble
[1:37:35] yourself in the sight of God's people
[1:37:38] and your leprosy will leave you amen and
[1:37:42] so isn't the same thing God asks us to
[1:37:44] humble ourselves in the midst of God's
[1:37:46] people to to cry out for the sins that
[1:37:50] we've done in our flesh and to that we
[1:37:52] might receive forgiveness for our sins
[1:37:55] amen but you got to humble yourself you
[1:37:59] got to make things right amen why
[1:38:01] because if you cry out to the Lord he
[1:38:03] has an expectation they're gonna go
[1:38:06] willingly to a total complete
[1:38:07] deliverance Amen God knows how to get
[1:38:14] you out of the bondage that you're in if
[1:38:16] you're willing
[1:38:18] amen and that's what it all comes down
[1:38:20] to whosoever will let him come unto me
[1:38:24] amen amen
[1:38:32] let's just stand
[1:38:35] say brother you're gonna end the message
[1:38:38] right there and the message right there
[1:38:45] the Holy Spirit is able to convict every
[1:38:49] single one of us amen and the Holy
[1:38:51] Spirit has a desire to bring every
[1:38:53] single one of us to a total deliverance
[1:38:56] but we have to be willing to do it we
[1:38:59] have to actually set in mind
[1:39:01] oh if God asks us to do some great thing
[1:39:04] wouldn't we have done it if God asks us
[1:39:06] to publicly give a hundred dollars to
[1:39:08] someone who needed it for deliverance
[1:39:10] wouldn't we have done it amen if God had
[1:39:13] asked us to do - to give groceries to
[1:39:16] the poor - or to do some marvelous thing
[1:39:20] that we could have the praise a man for
[1:39:22] it wouldn't we do it but God asks us to
[1:39:25] humble ourselves to lay down in his
[1:39:29] altar to seek for a total deliverance
[1:39:31] amen but it only comes if we desire to
[1:39:35] go all the way a may say oh brother I
[1:39:38] have this this pain in my body I'm
[1:39:40] crying out to the Lord to heal me well I
[1:39:42] I can't seem to get rid of this bondage
[1:39:45] I I keep stumbling in this area I do
[1:39:47] this over and over again I can't seem to
[1:39:49] get the victory over it Amen God has a
[1:39:51] plan to bring you out of that God has a
[1:39:55] plan and he has the ability to back up
[1:39:58] that plan but it only comes through you
[1:40:00] humbling yourselves to a total
[1:40:02] deliverance because God has doesn't make
[1:40:05] halfway Christians God doesn't do it he
[1:40:08] doesn't make halfway Christians he makes
[1:40:10] Christians they follow him to the
[1:40:12] promised land
[1:40:13] amen and they go through the heart
[1:40:15] through thick and thin I say I will
[1:40:18] follow them and never goes the Bible is
[1:40:20] full of people Amen from the children of
[1:40:22] Israel through the wilderness from
[1:40:24] Hannah trying to have the baby amen
[1:40:27] Jonah down into the whale people
[1:40:29] everywhere that God put them in a
[1:40:31] position where they could finally come
[1:40:34] down into submission to the will of God
[1:40:37] and all of us have things that we've cry
[1:40:39] out to God for amen but God has a
[1:40:42] greater desire for you that you would
[1:40:44] come into obedience to the will of God
[1:40:49] that's God's desire for your life amen
[1:40:51] then you'll live in prosperity then
[1:40:53] you'll live in peace then you'll live in
[1:40:56] the plan to the promise where all the
[1:40:58] little promises come to pass amen but to
[1:41:00] expect that without going through
[1:41:02] through through the hard time amen
[1:41:05] it just isn't going to happen Saints God
[1:41:08] has to bring you into obedience to his
[1:41:11] will you have to become circumcised to
[1:41:14] the world and the things of the world to
[1:41:16] live in the promised land it's got to be
[1:41:20] that way
[1:41:20] amen so look we're just gonna pray here
[1:41:23] right here right now
[1:41:24] amen I want to say the altar is open if
[1:41:27] you have things you need to make right
[1:41:28] before the Lord the author is open amen
[1:41:31] if you need to write make things right
[1:41:32] with someone else you need to go to them
[1:41:35] amen and you need to make sure that you
[1:41:37] do it well I'll do that tomorrow well
[1:41:39] you need you better make sure you do
[1:41:41] because God brought the message God has
[1:41:44] a plan for you to bring you to his
[1:41:46] Promised Land amen and if you refuse to
[1:41:50] go to the promised land then you be
[1:41:53] bound in hardness of heart and you will
[1:41:55] not even know where you meet I'd say
[1:41:59] brother that's wrong wait we can't live
[1:42:01] halfway we just can't do it we can try
