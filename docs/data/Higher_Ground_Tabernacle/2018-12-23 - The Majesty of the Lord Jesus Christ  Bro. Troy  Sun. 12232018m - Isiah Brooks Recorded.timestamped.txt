[27:12] the Day of Atonement here's verse 8 it
[27:15] says and Moses took the blood and
[27:19] sprinkled it on the people and said
[27:22] behold the blood of the Covenant which
[27:24] the LORD hath made with you concerning
[27:27] all these words and then wind up Moses
[27:30] and Aaron and naida
[27:32] and about who and seventy of the elders
[27:34] of Israel and they saw the God of Israel
[27:38] and there was under his feet as it were
[27:40] a paved work of sapphire stone and as it
[27:44] were the body of heaven in his clearness
[27:46] and upon the nobles of the children of
[27:49] Israel he laid not his hand also they
[27:52] saw God and did eat and drink even now
[27:56] let's skip down to the fifteenth verse
[27:58] there and Moses went up into the mount
[28:01] and a cloud covered the mountain and the
[28:04] glory of the Lord abode upon Mount Sinai
[28:07] and the cloud covered at six days and
[28:10] the seventh day he called unto Moses out
[28:13] of the midst of the cloud and the sight
[28:15] of the glory of the Lord was like a
[28:17] devouring foul that devouring fire on
[28:20] the top of the Mount in the eyes of the
[28:23] children of Israel and Moses went into
[28:26] the midst of the cloud and got himself
[28:28] up into the Mount and Moses was in the
[28:31] Mount forty days and forty nights a man
[28:35] let's stop right there Bauer Ezra word
[28:39] of Prayer Heavenly Father we just thank
[28:41] you Lord for your word for your gospel
[28:43] for your presence for your holy spirit
[28:45] here Lord in the midst of us father
[28:47] dwelling in us Lord for for filling us
[28:50] with your Holy Spirit for for writing a
[28:52] word to us for making a covenant with us
[28:54] spot for washing us by your own blood
[28:56] for all these things Lord we do give you
[28:59] thanks Lord and we just glorify you and
[29:01] give you all the majesty and honour and
[29:04] glory do unto your name father lord I
[29:06] just pray Lord as we preach this morning
[29:08] father that you would bring the word out
[29:10] perfectly that all that sit here that
[29:13] are in this building this morning would
[29:14] know if surely that that your word was
[29:17] true where you say where two or three
[29:18] are gathered in your name that you were
[29:20] right here in our myths and you open
[29:22] your word to us and we saw just like
[29:25] Moses saw we saw your Majesty as we did
[29:27] eat and drink of your work and we just
[29:30] thank you Lord for all things we turn
[29:32] the service into your able hands in the
[29:34] name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen
[29:37] you can be seated
[29:41] Amen you know as Moses you know I'm sure
[29:53] all of us could think my I wish I was
[29:56] there maybe I wouldn't have been a nice
[29:59] thing to say
[30:01] you know as the children of Israel he
[30:05] Moses he's been given the leadership
[30:11] over the children of Abraham and all
[30:15] those years he had heard about Abraham
[30:17] and how great Abraham was but now that
[30:19] all the children of Abraham were given
[30:20] into his hands
[30:21] amen and now God gave him the assignment
[30:26] to bring his people out of Egypt amen
[30:30] and to gather them together in one place
[30:32] and there God would be revealed unto
[30:36] them amen so as the children of Israel
[30:39] they the the children of Abraham they
[30:41] left Egypt and they went out into the
[30:44] wilderness amen and and as they gathered
[30:46] there in the wilderness that God came
[30:49] down upon the top of the mountain you
[30:51] know and this says they saw him as a
[30:52] cloud they saw him as a as a burning
[30:55] fire consuming the top of the mountain
[30:57] and and and Moses grabbed a Aaron and
[31:00] and the brothers and their and seventy
[31:02] of the elders and they went up into the
[31:05] mountain and they saw God to me that's
[31:11] just a it's just incredible to me it's
[31:13] amazing it's majestic you know God knows
[31:16] what Majesty is amen you know when we
[31:20] think about the word majestic it's it's
[31:22] when you when you go to a place that is
[31:24] majestic and you set your eyes and all
[31:27] of your senses on the majesty of
[31:30] whatever is around you the purpose of
[31:33] that is to gather your focus on one
[31:36] thing amen when you when you when you go
[31:39] up into the mountains you know you into
[31:42] the where the grandeur of the mountains
[31:44] like say in Colorado or in Alaska you
[31:46] know and you and you're just impressed
[31:48] with all that God has created and how
[31:51] great all the mountains are all
[31:53] everything that surrounds you and all of
[31:55] God's creation and how little you are
[31:57] and how big those are amen as there's a
[32:00] majesty to that when you begin to
[32:02] realize that my God created all of that
[32:04] amen and it draws your focus the focus
[32:08] of a Christian to How Great Thou art
[32:11] a meant to how great our God is when you
[32:15] realize how small how small we are and
[32:19] how great what he is able to do you know
[32:23] and then back in the olden days you know
[32:25] they used to build these giant
[32:26] cathedrals you know and there and they
[32:29] and that the goal was to to impress the
[32:33] the churchgoers and when they walked
[32:36] through this Cathedral that they are
[32:37] walking into a sacred place that this
[32:40] would be where God would dwell you know
[32:42] when they had the Tabernacle in the
[32:44] wilderness God created all that after a
[32:46] certain specific pattern so that the
[32:49] people would have a very specific they
[32:53] walked into it there would be a majesty
[32:55] there a meant a man and there was
[32:58] something majestic about it why because
[32:59] it came after a pattern of heaven he
[33:03] meant and so when when when you know God
[33:05] he is when the when
[33:09] Moses in them they walked up under that
[33:11] mountain that was a majestic sight they
[33:15] were being drawn from the thoughts that
[33:17] were behind them
[33:19] amen they ate walked up into the
[33:21] mountain amen and as soon as the cloud
[33:24] cover them everything else was taken
[33:26] away
[33:26] they became small and God became great
[33:29] amen amen
[33:33] I think about it Moses leaves them
[33:41] behind he says I will be back and he
[33:44] walks right up and as they had been
[33:46] staring at this cloud and Moses walks
[33:49] right into the cloud and there he is
[33:52] face-to-face with God and the Bible says
[33:56] that he was there for forty days and
[33:57] forty nights I think about that's from
[34:01] now until the beginning of February
[34:05] face-to-face with Jehovah face-to-face
[34:08] with him where the world is shut out hey
[34:10] you know to me that's that's that's all
[34:12] the qualifications I need for Moses III
[34:15] know I know where he got his his
[34:18] material amen I know how the book of
[34:20] Genesis got wrote I know how I know how
[34:23] the book of Exodus was written I know
[34:25] how the Book of Leviticus was written
[34:27] everything that Moses wrote I know how
[34:29] it was written because he was face to
[34:31] face with God amen amen I I know where I
[34:34] know what kind of a man he was I know
[34:36] his qualifications
[34:37] I know his experience why because he was
[34:40] a man who was face to face with God amen
[34:43] he left the world behind he shut himself
[34:45] into a place God met him in that place
[34:48] and for 40 days and 40 nights he was
[34:50] face to face with God that's all the
[34:53] qualifications I need to hear about amen
[34:56] and everything let everything that he
[34:58] said let it be truth they meant he
[35:00] experienced the majesty of Jehovah he
[35:03] experienced the majesty of Lord Jesus
[35:06] Christ and he saw things up there that
[35:08] he couldn't help but bring those things
[35:12] back amen and the Lord instructed me
[35:14] says whatever you saw up here I want you
[35:17] to recreate it down there they meant and
[35:21] so he was instructed
[35:23] take everything each you saw up there
[35:25] whatever it is and I want you to build
[35:27] it on the earth in the same pattern that
[35:30] you were shown when you're up here face
[35:32] to face with me that's how he built the
[35:34] tabernacle like you see that picture on
[35:36] the wall there all of that was built
[35:39] according to a very specific pattern
[35:41] that Moses saw when he was face-to-face
[35:43] with Jehovah Amite is majestic his
[35:48] majesty
[35:49] amen when when Aaron the high priest
[35:52] when he when he walked in and he had
[35:56] certain steps say like on the day of
[35:57] atonement
[35:58] you know once a year they would have the
[36:01] the day of atonement and Aaron the high
[36:04] priest had certain specific things that
[36:07] he had to do on that day amen so he
[36:11] would get the bow lock he'd get the the
[36:15] two goats a men who'd slay the Moloch
[36:18] for the for the children of Israel and
[36:21] you would sprinkle the blood upon the
[36:23] altar and you know and then he would
[36:25] take the two goats and they are cast
[36:27] lots and one of the goats would be
[36:29] assigned to Jehovah whichever one the
[36:32] lot fell upon that was Jehovah's
[36:34] Jehovah's sacrifice Jehovah's goat and
[36:36] then the other one was tied up right
[36:38] there and left for late a mint and so
[36:41] then when when and then you take the
[36:43] goat that was assigned to Jehovah and
[36:45] they would sacrifice it amen and then
[36:48] all and then they would catch the blood
[36:51] from the sacrifice and he'd go into the
[36:53] holiest of Holies and you'd sprinkle
[36:55] that blood upon the mercy seat he
[36:56] sprinkle it towards the curtain back
[36:58] towards the people Amen seven times and
[37:00] seven times
[37:01] amen and as he's to use what was he
[37:03] doing he was instituting a day of
[37:07] atonement where the children of Israel
[37:10] would know without a doubt my sins were
[37:13] gone amen and God had a very specific
[37:17] November all of this came from what
[37:19] God's what Moses saw up and Moses
[37:21] standing up there in the mountains saw
[37:23] something that caused him to come down
[37:26] and Institute the day of atonement there
[37:29] is something that Moses saw up there
[37:32] that caused him to cut march down into
[37:35] the mountain
[37:36] build that Tabernacle right there and to
[37:39] Institute the pattern a holy day called
[37:44] the Day of Atonement he saw something he
[37:48] saw something there's something that I
[37:51] just keep repeating that there's
[37:53] something Moses saw when he was up on
[37:55] that mountain when he peered up into
[37:57] heaven there's something that he saw
[37:59] that caused him to come down and build
[38:02] that tabernacle and to Institute the day
[38:05] of atonement I wonder what he saw
[38:10] it was majestic it was beautiful it was
[38:13] powerful let me tell you it was perfect
[38:15] it was glorious amen so Moses he or
[38:20] Aaron the high priest would on the day
[38:23] of atonement he would sacrifice that
[38:25] goat there was a sign to Jehovah in you
[38:27] he'd do the sprinkling of the blood and
[38:28] he walk into the holiest of Holies and
[38:31] he would take that blood he would
[38:32] sprinkle it upon the mercy seat so the
[38:36] mercy seat there you know they had dark
[38:38] in the Covenant I had the Word of God
[38:40] there on the inside
[38:41] amen by if there is anybody in the
[38:43] children of Israel that had done
[38:45] contrary to the word the word was
[38:47] covered over with a lid called the mercy
[38:49] seat hey man they took the blood of the
[38:51] sacrifice and they would sprinkle it on
[38:53] the on top of that mercy seat on top of
[38:55] that lid there was the mercy was
[38:57] covering over the word amen so between
[39:01] the children of Israel and the Word of
[39:03] God there was a layer of mercy a man in
[39:06] that and blaming that mercy was covered
[39:08] over with the blood of the sacrifice
[39:10] amen and the Bible says that the air in
[39:14] the high priest when he walked in there
[39:15] that he had these stones that were
[39:18] written upon all the Nate the names of
[39:21] the churner of Israel and it was written
[39:22] over his heart and so when he went in
[39:25] there he'd walk in there to do the
[39:26] sacrifice he'd have the names of the
[39:29] children of Israel and scribed on stones
[39:30] upon his heart amen
[39:34] where did all that where did that idea
[39:36] come from I think about this where did
[39:40] that idea come from Moses wasn't just
[39:42] making this up he saw something up in
[39:46] the majesty of heaven amen
[39:48] he saw something that caused him to come
[39:50] down
[39:50] to institute all of this amen so then
[39:53] all the the children of Israel be
[39:55] waiting outside of the tabernacle door
[39:57] and they're there waiting and there's
[39:59] all silence they don't hear anything
[40:03] they're there waiting they're waiting to
[40:05] see what what what you know as Aaron
[40:08] gonna reappear or not it is Aaron going
[40:12] to come back out of that tent is the
[40:14] sacrifice being completed are our sins
[40:16] gone or not amen
[40:18] have our sins been taken care of or not
[40:21] and and when Aaron would after
[40:23] completing everything that he was
[40:24] supposed to doing there he come back out
[40:25] and he'd walk up to that other goat the
[40:28] second goat and he would lay his hands
[40:30] on it he would transfer in a figure the
[40:33] sins of the people after they've been
[40:35] atoned for and upon the mercy seat
[40:38] transfer the sins of the people on that
[40:40] scapegoat and then they'd lead that
[40:42] scape go out into the wilderness to
[40:44] never be seen again and those the people
[40:47] would watch as that scape goes leaving
[40:49] the camp they'd say praise God my sins
[40:53] are gone amen
[40:55] we have been atoned for amen we go God
[40:58] gave us the word we've done contrary to
[41:00] the word but praise God with the
[41:02] sacrifice my sins are gone amen what a
[41:07] feeling a mint quite an experience
[41:17] Amen ex
[41:18] chapter 25 when gali was talking to
[41:23] Moses about building this the the
[41:25] tabernacle and verse 25 verse 1 he says
[41:28] and the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[41:30] speak unto the children of Israel that
[41:34] they bring me an offering of every man
[41:38] that giveth it willingly with his heart
[41:40] he shall take my offering a mint it's
[41:44] where they go they're gonna build the
[41:46] tabernacle with a willing heart
[41:48] sacrifice amen everything all the
[41:51] materials that were used in building the
[41:54] the tabernacle were built with an
[41:57] offering that was given by willing
[41:59] hearts amen
[42:01] let's go down to verse 8 it says and let
[42:05] them make me a sanctuary that I may
[42:08] dwell among them according to all that I
[42:12] show thee after the pattern of the
[42:13] tabernacle and after the pattern of all
[42:16] the instruments arif even so shall you
[42:18] make it a mint so moses saw this god has
[42:24] struck to him go down and take up an
[42:26] offering you're not you're not doing the
[42:28] work yourself a man Moses you're going
[42:31] to build this using what they're willing
[42:33] our sacrifice amen and out of the out of
[42:36] this the willingness of their own heart
[42:38] will create a pattern of what you saw up
[42:42] in glory amen amen and what was the
[42:48] purpose of building all this verse a it
[42:50] says right there let them make a
[42:52] sanctuary that I may dwell among them
[42:56] why what what was the purpose God wanted
[43:00] to dwell amongst his people amen
[43:08] now
[43:09] you when you go down further in the
[43:12] chapter it starts talking about the and
[43:14] the holiest of Holies there let's go to
[43:15] verse 17 there Amen it says I've already
[43:20] talked about building the the Ark of the
[43:21] Covenant now they're talking about
[43:22] building the mercy seat to go on top of
[43:24] the Ark of the Covenant verse 17 it says
[43:26] and thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure
[43:30] gold
[43:31] two cubits and a half shall be the link
[43:34] theraph and a cubit and a half the
[43:36] breadth thereof and thou shalt make to
[43:38] cherubims of gold of beaten work shalt
[43:40] thou make them in the two ends of the
[43:43] mercy seat and make one cherub on the
[43:45] one end and the other chair up on the
[43:47] other end even of the mercy seat mercy
[43:50] seat shall you make the cherubims on the
[43:53] two ends era and the chair rooms shalt
[43:56] stretch forth their wings on high
[43:58] covering the mercy seat with their wings
[44:00] and their faces shall look one to
[44:03] another to where the mercy seat shall
[44:05] the faces of the cherubims be and now
[44:07] shall put the mercy seat above upon the
[44:10] ark and in the ark thou shall put the
[44:12] testimony that I shall give thee and
[44:14] there I will meet you amen
[44:18] there I will meet thee and I will
[44:20] commune with thee from above the mercy
[44:22] seat from between the two cherubim I
[44:25] wish our upon the Ark of the testimony
[44:27] of all things which I give thee and the
[44:29] commandments under the children of
[44:31] Israel a man so what does he do remember
[44:34] what do we read back in the beginning in
[44:38] in chapter 24 he says hey Moses spoke to
[44:42] the children of Israel he God is making
[44:44] a covenant with you I've sprinkled you
[44:46] with the blood I've sprinkled the word
[44:49] with the blood and Here I am bringing
[44:50] you the testimony the Covenant thank God
[44:53] right now is making a covenant between
[44:55] himself and you amen and all of these
[44:59] words that God has written we've
[45:00] inscribed them down upon stone or
[45:02] putting them in in the in the the Ark of
[45:06] the Covenant Amen God has made a
[45:08] covenant between you but between you and
[45:11] the and the Covenant is going to be a
[45:13] layer of mercy amen between you and the
[45:17] Covenant that God has made with you a
[45:19] man is going to be a layer a lid a
[45:22] covering a cut
[45:24] / of mercy a mana called the mercy seat
[45:27] and that that word mercy seat has to do
[45:30] with is the same root word as the word
[45:33] atonement I am going to atone for you on
[45:37] your sins so then there on the day of
[45:39] atonement you would take the blood from
[45:41] the sacrifice and he was sprinkle it
[45:43] upon the mercy seat on the day of
[45:45] atonement he's take the atonement and
[45:47] sprinkle it upon the atonement and
[45:49] that's where God would meet them he
[45:51] wouldn't meet them there on the word he
[45:53] met them there on their mercy that
[45:54] covered the word Amen and that's where
[45:57] God met them and issued his covenant
[46:00] with them he meant or the blood met the
[46:04] Covenant right in the midst of the word
[46:11] there is mercy and that's where he will
[46:14] meet you I will meet you right there
[46:17] amen bye what a powerful ceremony the
[46:24] day of atonement one day a year our sins
[46:29] are gone they've been taken away they
[46:34] the the sins are have been atoned for at
[46:37] the mercy seat where God made a covenant
[46:39] with us when we and we in our own
[46:42] failings our own failures we've done
[46:44] things against the Covenant that God has
[46:46] has given unto us but God meant us right
[46:49] there at the point of mercy amen and the
[46:52] and the blood of the cub has been
[46:53] sprinkled amen and our sins were taken
[46:56] and they were assigned upon the
[46:58] scapegoat and the scapegoat went out
[47:00] into the wilderness and we washed and
[47:02] now we know we have on a surety we have
[47:04] this overpowering ceremony showed them
[47:08] gave them a visible sign that praise God
[47:10] our sins are gone
[47:13] praise God my sins are gone why because
[47:18] they prayer in the high priest would
[47:20] take the sins and he put his hands upon
[47:23] that scapegoat and transfer the sins of
[47:26] the people on did I go and hear you go
[47:28] out into the wilderness amen
[47:32] our sins have gone we have been accepted
[47:35] by Jehovah
[47:37] Amen Jehovah has looked upon us and
[47:40] smiled amen
[47:43] who have been accepted by Jehovah and
[47:45] the thing of it is is the entire thing
[47:47] was something that Moses saw up and have
[47:50] it so there is something now as great
[47:56] and as powerful as that is and how I
[47:59] would love to go back in a time machine
[48:01] 3000 years and go and see this in
[48:04] operation or 3,500 years ago and watch
[48:06] this take place how much I would love to
[48:08] see that with my own physical eyes there
[48:11] is a greater testimony than that Amen
[48:14] why because there is a better testament
[48:16] than that there's a greater covenant
[48:18] than that for that that was the Old
[48:20] Testament amen that was the Old Covenant
[48:23] but God says I have made a New Testament
[48:25] with you that's why we call it the New
[48:27] Testament being God has said I have made
[48:30] a new covenant with you amen
[48:33] let's turn over to Hebrews chapter 9
[48:51] verse chapter 9 verse 19 says for when
[49:03] Moses had spoken every precept to all
[49:07] the people according to the law he took
[49:10] the blood of calves and of goats with
[49:12] water and scarlet wool and hyssop and
[49:16] sprinkled both the book and all the
[49:19] people saying this is the blood of the
[49:22] Testament which God hath enjoined unto
[49:25] you
[49:26] moreover he sprinkled with the blood
[49:28] both the tabernacle and all the vessels
[49:31] of the ministry and almost all things
[49:35] are by the law purged with blood and
[49:37] without shedding of blood is no
[49:41] remission and Moses saw something in
[49:46] heaven that signified all that there was
[49:49] a testament there was a covenant that
[49:51] Moses saw being given a man in that
[49:54] covenant between God and man was seal
[49:57] with blood amen amen
[50:01] so in so in Moses what he do when good
[50:04] Moses when he went before he went on the
[50:06] mountain he spoke to the people and he
[50:08] gave the Covenant of God to the people
[50:10] and he took and he the sacrifice he
[50:12] sprinkled the people he sprinkled the
[50:14] the book he sprinkled all he says now
[50:16] there has been a covenant made between
[50:18] God and you and if they thing if you
[50:23] break the covenant then God will meet
[50:25] you right there at the mercy seat and
[50:28] then any weapon in the heavens and he
[50:31] had been to the mountain and he saw the
[50:33] pattern there everything was patterned
[50:34] off of amen now now let's keep going
[50:39] verse 22 it says and almost all things
[50:44] are by the law purged with blood and
[50:47] without shedding of blood is no
[50:49] remission it was therefore necessary
[50:52] that the patterns of things in the
[50:55] heavens should be purified with these
[50:57] but the heavenly things themselves with
[51:00] better sacrifices than these
[51:02] heyno so there was a better sacrifice
[51:04] Amen now we think about why Christ came
[51:11] when God sent the Lord Jesus Christ sent
[51:14] himself into the earth well you do he
[51:17] came to shepherds he sent an angel band
[51:20] an angel came to Mary amen and the whole
[51:24] thing was majestic you know when you
[51:26] read the Bible there's a lotta there was
[51:28] a lot of prophets there was a lot of
[51:31] magnificent things that happened
[51:33] majestic things amazing things when you
[51:37] look at Mary when when when she hears
[51:39] the angel choir when she when she hears
[51:43] the the angel speaking to her you'll
[51:45] bear child you'll call his name Jesus
[51:47] we're in the Shepherds when when the
[51:50] Shepherd's have the angel come and speak
[51:52] to them and say and the angel choir
[51:54] singing and they're like what is going
[51:56] on but now it's no longer now they'd
[51:59] hurt now all those people Mary the
[52:02] shepherds Joseph all of them they had
[52:06] all been to Jerusalem amen they had all
[52:10] seen the majesty of the ceremony amen
[52:14] they all seen how majestic the ceremony
[52:16] was when their high priest would go into
[52:18] the tabernacle amen to it into the
[52:20] temple that David had built and uh and
[52:23] and they saw how that the majesty of
[52:27] that tavern amen and how and how much
[52:30] and how much Majesty that the people
[52:33] assigned to that you know when Herod
[52:36] built that tabernacle they assigned it
[52:38] unto it majesty by building it a man and
[52:41] they and it was supposed to be a place
[52:43] so it fill you with awe you would walk
[52:45] in you'll remember when the when the
[52:46] disciples walked in they're like oh
[52:48] Jesus look how great this building is
[52:50] look how beautiful this is how I'll
[52:53] stand forever you know and Jesus says
[52:57] tear this thing down I will rebuild it
[52:59] in three days and they were impressed
[53:02] with it but Jesus says there's a better
[53:04] building than this
[53:05] amen there is a better place than this
[53:09] you know and we can we can think about
[53:12] how great a worship service is or we can
[53:14] you know and then the Christmas
[53:16] season there's an orchestras and choirs
[53:18] all over the land in there and they're
[53:20] trying to institute a atmosphere of
[53:23] majesty you know to when they when you
[53:26] get though all the band with all the
[53:28] brass instruments and all the stringed
[53:30] instruments and and they sing the they
[53:33] sing the Christmas carols and the songs
[53:35] and all over the land there that people
[53:39] are trying to celebrate the holiday of
[53:40] Christmas amen but I wonder sometimes if
[53:44] they I've ever been with Moses upon the
[53:50] mountain and which Testament are they
[53:54] looking at amen because you know when
[53:57] when Jesus and the disciples went into
[54:00] Jerusalem the disciples works getting
[54:04] excited about the Old Testament the Old
[54:09] Covenant where God had a place where he
[54:12] would meet with his people and they were
[54:15] talking to Jesus and they said look how
[54:17] great this Old Testament is look how
[54:21] great this Old Covenant is this old
[54:23] temple where God will meet with men amen
[54:26] in all of our lives we've been taught to
[54:28] to revere how great this this temple is
[54:32] and how great this priesthood is and how
[54:35] the high priest who who has donned
[54:37] himself with these with these fine
[54:40] garments and he goes through and he he's
[54:42] holier than thou and how how great the
[54:45] high priest appears to be and they'd all
[54:48] had assigned these thoughts in their
[54:50] mind that this is a majestic place and
[54:52] it was majestic but while they were
[54:55] speaking to the New Testament the Lord
[54:57] Jesus Christ they were speaking to the
[54:59] New Testament lamb
[55:01] trying to point back and say look how
[55:02] great this Old Testament is and the New
[55:05] Testament spoke back to him he meant the
[55:08] lamb spoke back to him the Lord Jesus
[55:11] Christ spoke right out and he says tear
[55:13] this building down I will rebuild it
[55:17] again in three days amen
[55:20] tear this building down yo and every
[55:24] time I read about the the sacrifices in
[55:27] the Old Testament that that thought
[55:28] comes in your mind my
[55:30] wish I could have been there to see that
[55:31] why how I'd love to see the the majesty
[55:36] of the high priest Amen the the the
[55:39] anticipation of the people waiting for
[55:41] the high priest to come out and announce
[55:43] your sins are gone
[55:44] they've been cast away from as far as
[55:46] the temple is to the wilderness amen
[55:50] your sins have been transferred upon
[55:53] this go and now your sins are our
[55:55] separate as far away from the temple is
[55:57] from the wilderness amen
[55:59] but we have a greater testament to them
[56:02] we have a greater covenant because now
[56:04] in the new covenant God says as far away
[56:06] as the east is from the west your sins
[56:09] are gone a man you know he didn't say
[56:14] north and south because if you start
[56:18] heading north you get to the North Pole
[56:21] and now you're going south again and if
[56:24] you go south and you get to the South
[56:26] Pole and you keep going else and you're
[56:28] going north again but if you go east
[56:31] you're just always going east always
[56:35] going east as far as East cannot become
[56:37] west west cannot become East and so when
[56:40] your sins are gone they cannot come back
[56:42] to you amen
[56:44] the process cannot be reversed your sins
[56:47] are gone amen
[56:48] a New Testament God has given unto you
[56:59] amen
[57:01] hebrews chapter 9 verse 22 it says and
[57:04] almost all things are by the law purged
[57:07] with blood and without the shedding of
[57:10] blood is no remission it was therefore
[57:13] necessary that the patterns of the
[57:17] things in heavens should be purified
[57:19] with these but the heavenly things
[57:22] themselves with better sacrifices than
[57:24] these so everything that moses saw up in
[57:28] the heavens needed a sacrifice amen
[57:33] there had to be a sacrifice for those
[57:35] heavenly things amen and now Christ
[57:38] verse 24 now Christ has not entered into
[57:41] the holy place made with hands he didn't
[57:43] go just go into the Temple of Jerusalem
[57:45] they meant when Jesus died upon the
[57:48] cross when he rose again he didn't go
[57:50] and present himself back to the high
[57:52] priest said I am I'm the bloody
[57:53] sacrifice no he entered up into the
[57:56] heavens of heavens he went to the same
[57:58] thing that Moses saw amen verse 24 for
[58:03] Christ is not entered in to the holy
[58:05] places made with hands which are the
[58:08] figures of the true but now into heaven
[58:10] itself watch now to appear in the
[58:14] presence of God for us not just that he
[58:21] has went up there to appear in the
[58:22] presence of God but he went up there to
[58:25] appear in the presence of God for us a
[58:30] meant every single one of us remember
[58:33] Aaron uh it's in let's turn to the
[58:38] Exodus chapter 28 I just got to read
[58:40] this verse I was just going to quote it
[58:42] to you let's turn to it
[58:50] X's 28 verse 29 Jesus Christ Adrian's in
[58:57] the heaven itself to appear in the
[58:59] presence of God for us for us amen in
[59:03] Exodus 28 says verse 29 and Aaron shall
[59:08] bear the names of the son of Israel and
[59:10] the breastplate of judgment upon his
[59:12] heart that when he goeth in under the
[59:14] holy place for a memorial before the
[59:18] Lord continually that there be set up a
[59:21] memorial unto the Lord of your name
[59:23] continually and now Christ is sick a
[59:27] turn into the holiest of holies for you

[1:00:32] thing though the whole plan for 6000
[1:00:35] years is now finished my sins are gone
[1:00:39] I've been raptured up into the heavens I
[1:00:41] am meeting my Savior face-to-face and we

[1:00:49] the Lamb

[1:00:54] majesty amen you know we've had a lot of
[1:00:57] good worship services here in this room

[1:01:02] getting ready to experience amen because
[1:01:06] one of these days soon in a moment in a
[1:01:09] twinkling of an eye we will appear
[1:01:12] before our Savior with our garments
[1:01:16] washed and the blood of the Lamb amen

[1:01:22] the Lord Jesus Christ adorned for her
[1:01:25] husband amen majesty lift up on high His
[1:01:30] Majesty why because now that now we've
[1:01:32] seen a lot of majestic things we've seen
[1:01:35] temples and Tabernacles of man but one
[1:01:37] of these days we're gonna enter in to
[1:01:41] the greatest majestic thing that has
[1:01:44] ever been seen upon the earth amen
[1:01:48] because there's there's only one man in
[1:01:50] the Bible that went and spent 40 days of
[1:01:53] 40 nights face to face with God and that
[1:01:59] was Moses and when he came down he had
[1:02:02] to give a pattern of everything that he
[1:02:03] saw I was up there and what did he get
[1:02:05] would he come down what was the most
[1:02:08] majestic of all the things that he saw
[1:02:10] up there of all the things that you know
[1:02:13] when he what will did he see up there
[1:02:15] when he went up there he saw the world's
[1:02:17] beginning to form he saw God say let
[1:02:24] there be light they meant he saw the
[1:02:28] Spirit of God brooding upon the face of
[1:02:31] the waters
[1:02:33] he saw the guy
[1:02:35] edan being created he saw God walking in
[1:02:39] the cool of the day in the midst of the
[1:02:41] garden amen he saw all these things but
[1:02:44] when he came down he began to express
[1:02:46] the majesty of the covenant amen the
[1:02:49] majesty of the mercy the majesty of the
[1:02:52] sacrificial lamb why is why is that
[1:02:54] though that was the most majestic thing
[1:02:57] this is what I'm going to express to you
[1:02:59] this is one can express to you that
[1:03:01] Christ the lamb is going to die for his
[1:03:05] bride amen and then when and he is going
[1:03:08] to forgive her for all of her sins he's
[1:03:10] gonna redeem her back from the fall a
[1:03:12] man he's gonna bring her back up into
[1:03:15] glory
[1:03:15] Oh Majesty this is what he came when he
[1:03:19] came down off the mountain he didn't
[1:03:21] start talking about I saw the creation I
[1:03:23] saw the heavens and the earth created he
[1:03:25] didn't say I saw the Garden of Eden he
[1:03:27] didn't say all those he wrote them later
[1:03:29] but but well the one thing he expressed
[1:03:31] he saw building after the patties on
[1:03:32] heaven was the majesty that the people's
[1:03:35] sins were forgiven he meant that there
[1:03:37] was at Christ not just a lamb not just
[1:03:40] uh not just an animal not just a goat
[1:03:42] not just a bull walk but Jesus Christ
[1:03:44] the Son of the Living God was dying for
[1:03:46] the sins of his bride amen and that was
[1:03:51] the majesty of the sacrifice he but he
[1:03:55] made it into a pattern so that the
[1:03:57] people could see it and they turned it
[1:04:00] into a dry dead religion amen and they
[1:04:04] took the pattern and turned it into a
[1:04:06] dry dead religion amen but that that's
[1:04:09] covenant that there's that that that
[1:04:12] testimony is still there the thing that
[1:04:14] Moses saw is still up in the heavens
[1:04:16] amen even if the the the pattern on the
[1:04:20] earth grows old even if the pattern on
[1:04:22] the earth you know they build a
[1:04:24] tabernacle it they lose it amen they had
[1:04:26] the Ark of the Covenant and they lost
[1:04:28] that amen they build a temple and then
[1:04:30] they it was ruined and destroyed they
[1:04:32] built another one and man destroyed that
[1:04:34] one amen but yet the pattern that was
[1:04:36] built off is still standing up in the
[1:04:38] heavens Amen the pattern was your
[1:04:43] husband
[1:04:45] the Lamb of God the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:49] Oh majesty How Great Thou art
[1:04:53] amen because these things were built off
[1:04:58] the patterns of what was up in the
[1:04:59] heavens amen you know and we call it the
[1:05:03] Old Testament but the Old Testament is
[1:05:04] only referring to the things on the
[1:05:06] earth
[1:05:07] amen because the things in the oven can
[1:05:09] in the heavens can never become old amen
[1:05:14] only the things on the earth can become
[1:05:16] old but the things that have had never
[1:05:18] become old that new testament was the
[1:05:20] pattern all along amen Christ and his
[1:05:26] bride amen
[1:05:30] our sins are gone the high priest the
[1:05:35] Lord Jesus Christ amen he walked up the
[1:05:38] hill to Calvary amen and and he was the
[1:05:42] Lamb of God amen he was the Lamb of God
[1:05:46] that was going to be slain amen he was
[1:05:48] the goat that was gonna be slain amen
[1:05:50] and he was nailed upon the cross amen
[1:05:54] our sins were died but then he was also
[1:05:56] the goat the way into the wilderness
[1:05:57] right amen because he took our sins and
[1:06:00] he bore them far away not just as far as
[1:06:03] the temple is from the wilderness but as
[1:06:05] far as the east is from the west he took
[1:06:07] our sins back to Hell where they came
[1:06:09] from amen amen and now and now he just
[1:06:12] sended it from up on high giving gifts
[1:06:14] unto men and that's what is he is
[1:06:17] preaching to you as they gifts this
[1:06:18] morning amen and now he is standing at
[1:06:22] the altar making intercession for you
[1:06:24] with your name standing there as a
[1:06:26] memorial before God upon his heart upon
[1:06:29] the heart of the Lord Jesus Christ your
[1:06:31] name so how do I assign this great
[1:06:34] atonement to myself how do I that's a
[1:06:37] great story but how do I take this
[1:06:38] atonement to myself you just put your
[1:06:40] name there amen because Christ is
[1:06:44] standing there at the throne for you
[1:06:46] amen Christ is standing there at the
[1:06:49] altar for you with his own blood to make
[1:06:52] intercession for you based upon your
[1:06:54] confession
[1:06:59] amen
[1:07:03] let's read Hebrews chapter 9 verse 14
[1:07:10] says how much more I just read verse 13
[1:07:15] for if the blood of bulls and goats and
[1:07:18] the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the
[1:07:21] unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of
[1:07:23] the flesh how much more shall the blood
[1:07:28] of Christ who through the Eternal Spirit
[1:07:30] offered himself without spot to God
[1:07:32] purge your conscience
[1:07:35] how's your conscience doing this morning
[1:07:38] amen
[1:07:40] purge your conscience from dead works to
[1:07:43] serve the Living God and for this cause
[1:07:45] he is the mediator of the New Testament
[1:07:49] that by means of death for the
[1:07:52] redemption of the transgressions that
[1:07:54] were under the first Testament they
[1:07:57] which are called might receive the
[1:07:59] promise of an eternal inheritance amen
[1:08:03] are you the call this morning have you
[1:08:06] felt the call of God upon your life amen
[1:08:09] have you felt the call of God upon your
[1:08:12] life amen if God has called you a man
[1:08:15] then he's called you right here to this
[1:08:17] sacrifice if God has spoke to your heart
[1:08:20] if he's drawn you if God has spoke to
[1:08:22] you if he's drawing you to himself this
[1:08:24] is why to bring you to this New
[1:08:26] Testament to bring you to the same place
[1:08:28] where Moses was to still go and let all
[1:08:32] the things of the world be behind you to
[1:08:35] leave Egypt behind to walk up into the
[1:08:38] mountains with him face to face and see
[1:08:40] the sacrifice where your sins are gone
[1:08:42] Oh Majesty worship His Majesty amen
[1:08:49] there's a New Testament with his own
[1:08:51] blood he meant
[1:08:56] I just wanted to read this from Malachi
[1:09:01] chapter 1 it says Malachi 1:1 says the
[1:09:10] burden of the word of the Lord to Israel
[1:09:12] by Malachi verse 2 says I have loved you
[1:09:16] stay at the Lord yet ye say wherein has
[1:09:22] that loved us was not Esau Jacob's
[1:09:26] brother
[1:09:27] and yet saith the Lord yet I have loved
[1:09:30] Jacob and I hated Esau
[1:09:32] amen if God has chosen you accept it
[1:09:36] Amen if God has chosen you if John if
[1:09:40] God has called you if you have felt the
[1:09:43] call go up on your life then run to him
[1:09:45] amen rolling to him why because he's
[1:09:47] standing there waiting to make atonement
[1:09:49] for you based upon your confession
[1:09:52] amen amen god is good you see all no
[1:09:59] matter how majestic that looks to us
[1:10:01] there is a greater pattern up in the
[1:10:03] heavens amen and when we and we enter
[1:10:06] into there by prayer by a contrite heart
[1:10:09] by a contrite spirit and we just like
[1:10:12] them can say praise God my sins are gone
[1:10:15] that's the you know you know it's me
[1:10:17] that's greater than any building I can
[1:10:19] ever go to it that those experiences are
[1:10:22] greater than than any mountain I've ever
[1:10:26] climbed they're greater than any
[1:10:29] tabernacle or temple
[1:10:30] they're better than E Cathedral all the
[1:10:33] earthly choirs I've ever heard sing all
[1:10:36] the great music I've ever listened to oh
[1:10:38] you know they grab your emotions and
[1:10:41] they bring them up high and then three
[1:10:42] minutes later they - them back to the
[1:10:44] ground and songs over amen but there is
[1:10:46] something about this that is so majestic
[1:10:49] that it just never ends praise God I've
[1:10:52] met my Savior face-to-face and I know my
[1:10:56] sins are gone amen amen
[1:11:03] it's a more majestic scene when you can
[1:11:07] finally assign that atonement to
[1:11:10] yourself when you can finally realize
[1:11:14] that God has given you permission to
[1:11:18] believe that your sins are gone
[1:11:21] amen now now back then when the when the
[1:11:25] when the children of Israel waited at
[1:11:28] the tabernacle door and they'd see the
[1:11:32] high priests come out with the scapegoat
[1:11:34] and thence one would lead that escape go
[1:11:37] out into the wilderness as the scapegoat
[1:11:39] was leaving they'd say we have we have
[1:11:42] we have done what Jehovah has required
[1:11:45] now on this day of atonement we know our
[1:11:48] sins are gone they're leaving the camp
[1:11:51] their goats they had a visual
[1:11:54] confirmation that their sins were gone
[1:11:57] but you know your eyes could lie to you
[1:12:00] but there is a greater thing than the
[1:12:03] sense of sight there is a sense of faith
[1:12:06] amen let every man that can see with the
[1:12:09] eyes of his faith they meant that his
[1:12:12] sins are gone to believe on the Lord
[1:12:14] Jesus Christ to believe on the sacrifice
[1:12:16] that man sins they're gone amen amen you
[1:12:23] think oh I wish I could be there you can
[1:12:25] be there right now oh I wish I could
[1:12:28] have seen that you can see it right now
[1:12:29] oh I wish I could see that Old Testament
[1:12:33] there's a New Testament right here
[1:12:34] waiting for you a new covenant that God
[1:12:37] has made a covenant between himself and
[1:12:39] you I will never leave you nor forsake
[1:12:43] you
[1:12:44] I'll come again I'll receive you into
[1:12:47] myself a man I go to prepare a place for
[1:12:50] you and if I prepare if I leave I will
[1:12:53] come again and receive you unto myself
[1:12:54] and one of these days I make a covenant
[1:12:57] with you then in a moment in a twinkling
[1:12:58] of an eye I'll come back and I will take
[1:13:01] you up to glory with me amen a covenant
[1:13:04] that God has made between you and him
[1:13:09] amen a New Testament and he sealed it
[1:13:12] with his own blood he was the high
[1:13:14] priest he was the Lamb
[1:13:16] he was Jehovah's the goat for jehovah he
[1:13:19] was the gopher the scapegoat he did it
[1:13:21] all he performed every single part of
[1:13:23] that ceremony he performed every part of
[1:13:27] the ceremony that all you had to do is
[1:13:30] stand outside stand at the door and
[1:13:32] knock amen amen and all you had to do is
[1:13:36] go to the dory men and meet Christ there
[1:13:40] at the door open the door let them in a
[1:13:42] mint how do you my sins are gone that's
[1:13:52] when you can assign the atonement to you
[1:13:55] amen you know the the Word of God as a
[1:13:59] seed and it can only grow in a heart
[1:14:03] that has faith you know faith is the
[1:14:09] good ground that seeds grow in you know
[1:14:12] if you do not believe if you're
[1:14:15] wondering if you're doubting then then
[1:14:17] the Word of God can't grow there amen
[1:14:19] but if you have a heart of faith where
[1:14:21] you say you know what Lord I'm just
[1:14:23] gonna take you at your word I'm just
[1:14:25] gonna believe in you I'm gonna take you
[1:14:27] at your word my sins are gone
[1:14:29] amen amen let's read it just here in
[1:14:33] closing let's read Hebrews chapter 10
[1:14:35] the next chapter over
[1:14:47] - Stan I'm gonna read here Hebrews
[1:14:53] chapter ten nine through twenty five
[1:14:57] it's a long read but I just want to read
[1:14:59] all of this to read along with me amen
[1:15:03] you got to read out loud but just read
[1:15:04] make sure you read along with me here it
[1:15:06] says then said helo I come to do thy
[1:15:09] will o God he taketh away the first that
[1:15:12] he may establish the second by the which
[1:15:15] will we are sanctified through the
[1:15:17] offering of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:15:19] once for all and every priest standeth
[1:15:23] daily ministering and offering
[1:15:24] oftentimes the same sacrifices which can
[1:15:28] never take away sins but this man after
[1:15:32] he had offered one sacrifice for sins
[1:15:35] forever set down on the right hand of
[1:15:38] God
[1:15:39] from henceforth expecting until his
[1:15:42] enemies be made his footstool
[1:15:44] you know Jesus knows exactly what's
[1:15:47] gonna happen he are he's already seen it
[1:15:49] he knows exactly what's gonna happen
[1:15:51] amen it's the same thing with us if you
[1:15:54] have already seen it you know exactly
[1:15:56] what its gonna happen but that scene
[1:15:58] only comes by revelation amen for by one
[1:16:02] offering he hath perfected forever them
[1:16:05] that are sanctified we're uh can you
[1:16:10] believe that Saints Christ died for your
[1:16:13] sins by one time he died for your sins
[1:16:17] for by one offering he hath perfected
[1:16:20] forever them that are sanctified whereof
[1:16:24] the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us
[1:16:26] for after that he had said before this
[1:16:30] is the Covenant that I will make with
[1:16:31] them after those days saith the Lord I
[1:16:34] will put my laws into their hearts and
[1:16:37] in their minds will I write them and
[1:16:39] their sins and their iniquities
[1:16:41] I will remember them no more now where a
[1:16:44] remission of sin of these is there is no
[1:16:47] more offering for sin a man now what
[1:16:51] does Paul do he gives us a little bit of
[1:16:53] instruction here take these things a
[1:16:55] mint these next few verses he's gonna
[1:16:58] give us instruction
[1:17:00] this is what would seeing that you know
[1:17:02] all this this is what we need to do it
[1:17:04] says verse 19 having therefore having
[1:17:12] therefore brethren boldness to enter
[1:17:15] into the holiest by the blood of Jesus
[1:17:17] by new and living way which he hath
[1:17:19] consecrated for us through the veil that
[1:17:22] is to say his flesh having a high priest
[1:17:24] over the house of the God lest draw near
[1:17:27] with a true heart in full assurance full
[1:17:32] assurance of faith having our hearts
[1:17:34] sprinkled from an evil conscience and
[1:17:36] our bodies washed with pure water let us
[1:17:39] hold fast the profession of our faith
[1:17:40] without wavering for he is faithful that
[1:17:43] promised and let us consider one another
[1:17:45] to provoke unto love and to good works
[1:17:48] not forsaking the Assembly of ourselves
[1:17:50] together as the manner of some is but
[1:17:53] exhorting one another and so much more
[1:17:55] as you see the Day approaching amen
[1:17:59] that and that is the pattern of the
[1:18:01] Christian life that they are gathered
[1:18:03] together often rejoicing in the majesty
[1:18:06] of the sacrifice the majesty that their
[1:18:08] sins are gone that the Day of Atonement
[1:18:10] has been that the sacrifice has been
[1:18:13] accepted for you amen and you've been
[1:18:16] washed but now let us live one to
[1:18:19] another exhorting much other all the
[1:18:22] more as you see the Day approaching a
[1:18:24] malicious borrower has a word of Prayer
[1:18:26] Heavenly Father I just want to thank you
[1:18:28] Lord for your atonement Lord I don't

[1:18:36] thing to me when I realized that that I
