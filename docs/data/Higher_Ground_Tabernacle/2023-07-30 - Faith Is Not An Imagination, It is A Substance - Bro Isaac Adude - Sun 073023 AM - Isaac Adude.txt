gave me a ride yesterday yeah and he's here this morning amen and all the visitors visiting from afar hey visitors amen we welcome you in Jesus name this is request let's go to Mark chapter 11 I will read the verse 22 to verse 25. the verse you mean the Bible says that and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God is unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and shall not doubt in his heart but shall be shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass whatsoever he says now verse 24 verse the Bible says that therefore I say unto you what things so ever you desire When you pray believe that you have believed that you received them and you shall have them I love this verse because he says that whatsoever you desire that's right Amen in verse 25 the Bible continues and says that and when you stand praying forgive reversible against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive us father God we humbly come before your throne of grace Lord just to say thank you Mercy Lord we thank you Father Lord for your grace and your mercies thank you Father God for keeping us alive Lord we thank you for the holy spirit inside of us thank you for your presence this morning that you helped me to be successful to the Holy Spirit amen verse 25 I'm going to read it again the Bible says the end when you stand praying forgive read the whole thing oh and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses because we know that faith is based upon forgiveness amen faith is upon forgiveness amen you might be standing here and the brother comes to you asking for prayer and you have a grudge against that brother even how are you expecting to pray for that brother unless you forgive him and you won't even have faith so you have to forgive first I have faith that once you pray your prayer will be heard so that's what I said that faith is based upon forgiveness amen and faith is also based upon the unity amen because God says that if he abide in me amen and my word abides in you then you are able to ask whatever you want Allah you abiding in God and letting his word abiding in you in other words you become one with this word you go along you become one with his word and abiding in God in other words means that to have faith in God so that scripture amen it's uh uh I believe John chapter 15 verse 7. uh Jean verses that if you abide in me Liberia and my words abide in you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you if you have faith in me and once you have faith in me my words will abide in you Jesus knew who he was amen that's what he's telling you that if you're abide in me amen he knew that he was a counselor he knew that he was a provider he knew that he was The Giver of all perfect and great gifts and he knew that he was the one who can forgive him and he knew that he was the one who could multiply he knows that when he makes a sad face or mom cannot say no he said okay his mom will always give it to him amen amen so a child knows who he is so um yes we do have space in the front here for the people in the back um and so we are hello in foreign even for the Statue of the perfect man memories Paul says that add to your faith Paul ADI amen so faith is the foundation on which you will build your house you need to have faith without faith you can't please God without faith you can't have the healing of your body without faith you cannot have the answer of your promise to your prayers without faith you can't have a blessing soon amen so we need to have faith faith is very important so the key in faith is the hand that holds the key element amen the key is the scripture like amen and faith is the hand that unlocks it is the key is the scripture but to have that promise applied to your life and you have to have faith amen the face to unlock their problems God promised healing when God promises us God promised to bless us and God promised to protect us God promised to always be with us and that promise will not serve you any good yourself amen if you're only reading it but that promise will help you if you have the faith to unlock series if you have the faith you unlocked amen that's why faith is very important amen we need to have faith and faith is not an imagination imagination that's good to have that that thought amen you've got to know something the faith you've got to know something about what you're having facing before you can before you can have faith in it foreign the kid can go to his mother or dad mouthful foot and the father will provide it that's the same relationship we have to have with God you know who he is asking him as a father asking him as a friend and he will give it to us amen there is something about friendship you know me and my friends they know very well that I'm not really good at paying my debts but I'm honest about this is you know can I have a hundred bucks and I'll give it back to you next week they know very good that that next week will never come until they remind me about it it's okay um women within their friendship amen I know I can't trust them we need I can go to them they will give it to you amen so is your relationship with God you have a friendship relationship with God um to John chapter 15 verse 14 to 13 to 16. amen here's what God is calling you uh in my John 15 14-16 Jean King the Bible says that you are my friends if you do what I commend amen this is Jesus talking amen this is Jesus speaking power amen you are my friends if you do what I command amen then verse 15. reverse accounts it says that I no longer call you servants because a servant does not know his master's business instead I have called you friends for everything that I learned from my father I have made known to you man you did not choose me but I chose you mean itably I think [Music] yeah because I can tell you everything that my father has told foreign the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are foreign yeah amen that's who Jesus is amen I am the Tree of Life from the Garden of Eden amen that's who Jesus is amen I am all of these things I am that I am and he knew with that perfect face amen that the spirit of God was upon Him surely he said that now I is myself do nothing but it's my faith in God Andrew and God was in him the word was made manifest and when the word of God comes in you he made my it's made manifests for you are a Believer and the believer is the faith of God that moves in here [Music] amen Jesus knew who he was so that's why he could be live in his own words to have faith in what the Bible says you have to have faith in what you are foreign foreign amen Roman chapter 33. Roman chapter 33 yeah chapter 8 verse 33 to 39. who are you amen the Bible says here Liberia who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elected amen you are the elect of God Amen you are the elect of God Amen so who will lay anything Amen to charge of God's elect it is God that justifies amen who is he that condemneth amen nobody can condemn you personally because it is Christ that died yeah rather amen that is reason again amen who is even at the right hand of God amen amen he also make it intercession for us [Music] [Music] he won all the battles foreign [Music] [Music] hey man that car was just slowing down amen because if it doesn't slow down and you will get a ticket amen so that is what God wants you to do I lost the secretary the one said God wants you to have say circled the mindset of a policeman who knows who he is amen who knows the authority of his uniform uniform and he knows that one is standing there with his cars will have to slow down and now because he's strong enough to stop the carport vehicles [Music] so you have to know who you are along with the vehicle once you know who you are there is no power in hell in your country songs [Music] [Music] nor any other creature because [Music] I know that God loved me that's because you're sick of your mind me amen that's why he died for me I know who it is amen who are you who amen Revelation chapter one verse six um amen the Bible says liability he has made us Kings and Priests the sacrificator unto God and his father to him be glory Lewis forever and ever amen amen who are you I'm a king you have dominion I tried I do call the line come on a king has a domain amen a king as servants a king doesn't go and and and and and and do some hard work and wonderful the trouble right A King is there and why expecting things to be done foreign [Music] is that me calling you the elect who can condemn you Allah amen have faith in what you want have faith in what the Bible says amen the Bible says that you are God's friends amen friends sometimes things happens between friends amen we've seen every day no patience actually amen we lie everything but because I am God's friends amen I know how to fix it with him at the end of the day because [Music] that's what I love I love this song I know who I am just say amen I know who God says I know what God says I know where God says where God says amen amen I know who I am so therefore Allah I'm walking in power I walk in the mirror and I will live a life of favor because I know who I am sweet nothing can bother me amen amen the challenges of life um [Music] I know the relationship that amen he called me even sometimes friends are more than Brothers amen sometimes friends are more than Brothers there are certain stuff in our lives that we don't talk to our brothers yes but we go to our friends first God is calling you his friends that means that there are certain things that he can only tell you Allah that means that there are certain Revelations that he can only give to you yes not everybody else amen he revealed the Seven Seals not anybody else about you my name and he explained the Book of Revelation for you he likes book his father foreign he knows who he is don't know and I'm degenerated brings forth Faith amen because he has promised amen everything is in line Dude shows the only thing you have to do to get the electricity is to push them that's all you have to do when this scripture is supposed to be fulfilled Now concept a creature is repositor complete press the button Don't Be Afraid take all the promises of God the promise is already there to get the electricity electricity if we turn off the lights are constantly running through the water [Music] [Music] amen sometimes I know that you might be praying for something you've been praying for some I mean the brother uh had some you know problems so you went to the doctors and the doctor told him that he would not be able to have any kids so him and his wife and Men they've been trying to have kids amen nothing was working amen if the you know if the wife gets pregnant imagine it will lose and then he saw a title of a sermon of one of the preachers it was entitled that God I I believe know your purpose in life I mean the devil knows who you are but he will try to you know take you away from the purpose so instead of shooting himself we met with the gun he stopped and he started listening to that sermon we listened to that sermon and he made some promises to God the Lord if you save me Lord I will serve you so then one time his wife texted him was like well go again go do the test amen he knows that he knew that he didn't want to hurt his wife so he texted back to his wife in saying that you know even if this doesn't work you know just be strong and and be courageous God knows the thing that really mocked me in that testimony of his wife and his wife texted back and said amen I know that I might be delayed is I know that my prayers might be delayed but my prayers are not denied amen now they have kids they've been trying to have a daughter now they have a daughter because the wife had faith knowing that she knows that even if her prayers might be delayed amen but her prayers are not you've been praying to God for things [Music] the Bible says that in those days in those days I Daniel was mourning three four weeks I ain't no pleasing bread neither can flesh or nor wine in my mouth anoint myself at all three whole weeks were fulfilled then said he unto me illmoji fear not Daniel this is Michael talking me Michelle then said he unto me fear not Daniel Lucario for from the first day that thou did this said done hard to understand thyself before thy God Amen the Bible says that thy words were hurt in other words your prayers were heard and I am come for thy words and the reason I'm here because your the first day you open your mouth now let's go to verse 13. amen your prayers were heard the first day you open your mouth now verse 13 the Bible says that but the prince of the kingdom of Persia verses with stood me one and twenty days you know let's continue but Lo Michael one of the chief princess Chef came to help me and I remained there with the kings of Prayer of Persia but the prince of the kings of bread of kingdom of pressure withstood me 1 and 20 days Now understand the story verse 1 to 3. that's Daniel praying say Daniel now verse 12 Michael answering today yeah the first day you open your mouth your prayers were heard when God sent the answer now in verse 13. amen hear Michael's saying you see but I was delayed for 21 days but it was a little bit delayed he took longer than he was supposed now in verse 14. now I am come to make thee understanding before the uh the people in the latter days your prayers were hurt amen the first time you open your mouth your prayers were hurt but it's just been delayed messages amen for Abraham was delayed for 25. amen foreign [Music] the night might be as dark as you want to uh the night might take as long as you want to uh but we have a promise that the sun will always shine and joy will always come in the morning don't be afraid don't lose your face keep that same face God this is meant for amen don't be discouraged and keep that same Faith oh God this is meant for because your prayers have been hurt your prayers have been hurt I think Luke chapter 2. [Music] foreign [Music] uh Luke chapter 1 verse 13. Luke says that Liberia DC by the Andrew said unto him amen here's the Andrew talking to zacharius for that prayer is hard and our wife Elizabeth shall bear to your son and Del shall call his name John amen this couple has been bearing for a long time it's like Abraham looking for his son remember God sent him somewhere praying for other people and they have children so here Elizabeth they have been praying foreign but surgery [Music] [Music] foreign Jesus is amen it's a little bit delayed the answer is yes there is only one thing that you're asking you today go to God and say Lord I want that Revelation I want you to reveal [Music] don't be like somebody who has been denied be happy it may be like somebody who just got an offer for a really good job so welcome because you know that something good is coming so you pray to God and you had faith when you prayed so believe as if that thing has already come already behave yourself as if that thing has already happened [Music] amen God wants you to be happy to smile all the time the reason why he gave us all the promises when we're lacking some let's have friends [Music] we are a challenge [Music] is Excellence all I require for
