and worship you and we just bless the musicians and bless the rest of the song service Lord we love you we thank you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen thank you foreign thank you for this is not a note presentation but it's something the Lord really laid on my heart that I have not shared quite a bit with the uh the family of God here at Higher Ground um I retired a couple retired from working at uh a place called Seneca Tank about two years ago I'd worked there about 20 years worked along Brother Rich and uh just uh had a great opportunity there uh to witness the Lord uh I had customers coming in put me in the out of state fly in and but the the whole poll to to leave Seneca Tank a couple years ago is when I was out in Charlotte South North Carolina and the Lord I heard his voice and and I proceeded to tell my wife at the hotel that night that I'm pretty sure that it was time to retire and she said what she said are you sure can we talk about this and I said well God's already showed me and that was right before the shutdown many of you know and uh that shutdown happened and I went home and it just seemed like it that call for me was put on the back burner and uh shut down happened and went back to work months later and guess where I was at I was back in Charlotte again I'm not playing not thought out that was just God had opened doors for me there and it was an opportunity they had their first ever uh tornado there they had a lot of hurricanes and and but never a tornado and helped a lady get through that fear of tornado but it was a a day that my last day it was in November a couple years ago and and uh the day after I walked out of there the last time I had a guy call me and he was a customer I had worked 21 years at one company and then consulted for personal consulting company for about six years and then another 20 years at this last company and uh don't you adding all that up so a it was uh it was a time when I sensed some emptiness walking out of there and I didn't know what was going to happen well the Lord had something on the agenda first day had a guy call me he used to be a Executive Vice President of a company downtown and I hadn't seen him for 20 some years 25 years and and uh and Jeff this Jeff as it was his name and he called and he said do you remember me and I said well sure I do and he said well um is this a bad time and I said no matter of fact this is my first day off from work we call what we call retirement and he said well can we talk and I said sure So we set up the next day and we met and come to find out he had a very rare cancer he had Mayo Clinic had as a client and uh he uh they did all kind of face time if you will with maybe a dozen doctors around the world and nobody knew how to come up with a plan for him in some sort of uh medicine he may take and to help the process and and so he I just told him I said we've got all we need right here and he was not a Christian and uh explain to him what the word said about afflictions and I said I'll be glad to walk with you on this path and he says how how would we have ever known it worked out this way but you know God had it all in hand and uh I'm still walking with that man today his numbers improve right away and have held uh since then and uh so if you saw him today I think brother Isaiah has seen him before and I pointed him out to him and who he was and he said I would never have guessed he had any cancer at all he looked so healthy and but that's that's brother Jeff and he and I see each other at least once maybe sometimes twice a week and uh and sometimes it takes uh he needs a little bit of what he doesn't know how to call upon the Lord to circumcise and I have helped him through that and with the prayer Faith even though you may have a a Believer but he's not walking close like he needs to but just having the grace for him and I thank God for for Jeff and uh and I just pray for his completion whether it's on this side of river that completion of healing or on the other side of the river I just praise God for what he has for him amen praise God Amen Hallelujah God is good amen hallelujah in all of our Lives amen whatever he's got us going through amen I praise him amen like Paul said when he's in the good and the bad I Praise Him amen Hallelujah let's sing amen he's never failed me yet amen it's a

read the verse 9. the Bible says and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore without rather glory in my infirmities that the power in my infirmities oh sorry that the power of Christ May rest upon me amen let's turn again to uh Second Corinthians thank you uh Second Corinthians chapter five we read uh verse 21. second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 21 the Bible says uh for he has made him to be seen for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him amen uh bless blessed by our heads father God we humbly come before Eternal Grace Lord just to say thank you Father Lord thank you Father Lord for the grace of God that Lord that you have give you that you give us Lord Jesus Lord we unworthy people father God we didn't we didn't deserve that Christ Lord it's like the Bible says not by power not by might by your spirit Lord it's your grace that saved us o God that your grace oh Father Lord that is keeping us alive Lord It's Your Grace So father Lord Lord Jesus Christ that is keeping us so father that is giving us the strength of Father Lord to serve you lord lord it's not father God by all works oh lord it's not father Lord for something that we did oh God it's not the reward of something that we did or father Lord that's why you saved us Lord but Lord Jesus Christ Your Grace father

be so sensitive to the Holy Spirit oh God so that I can say exactly what you want me to say Lord bless us oh Father God let us O Father Lord have a great moment Lord in your presence Jesus Christ Lord we thank you in Jesus Christ name we pray amen and then you may be seated uh this morning I have uh sorry tonight I have a little subject that uh wanted to share with you uh I intelligently his grace is sufficient and then I'll read again uh Second Corinthians chapter 12 verse 9. uh Second Corinthians chapter 12 verse 9 he says that my grace is sufficient for thee for my strengths he's made perfect in weakness amen his grace is sufficient amen that's all I care about man that's that that's all I want to know amen when I know that his grace is sufficient amen uh you know I'm happy because I know it's not you know what I do or it's not works that I would do or it's not how I will leave my life but it's just Grace in me amen when we talk about Grace amen but the perfect example that I could come up with uh uh uh uh tonight it's about the life of David amen I was just thinking about David and I saw how his life was and and David's life was Grace I mean it was early but it was all the grace of God look David uh first of all he had Brothers amen they were stronger than him and taller than him and bigger than him and they had everything that David didn't have they made a matter of fact even the his own father favorite those Brothers you know more than David but when so uh I'm sorry once Samuel came even even Samuel by seeing those brothers and he was like well these are the ones that God told me this is this is the Fulfillment of the prophecy right here amen because he saw them he was like yeah these people are worthy to be Kings amen and he wanted to to anoint them with the oil but God said no that's not him the second one came God said no that's not him the third one came God said no that's not him then Samuel was like well uh do you have any other son that may say about his father but David's father said yes I have one but he's he's away he went to work and he's not he's not he's not here they met when Samuel came and he saw David amen it wasn't something that was attractive to to the eyes I mean it wasn't he didn't have the composure of a king and when he was there and been sitting there with uh his heart playing for for the ship and everything but Samuel anointed him and God said this is the one amen he wasn't Devin wasn't elected King because he was wrong David wasn't elected King because he was tall or he was big but he was the grace of God that took him from where he was it meant to put him there on top of Israel to lead his children amen he was the grace of God it wasn't the might of David it wasn't the power of David but he was the grace of God when he had to face the lion amen David was not strong enough in himself to defeat those like to defeat the lion amen David was not strong himself to this I mean himself to defeat uh uh the bear but it was the grace of God that was protecting the gift that was inside of David even when he came against Goliath a man's Soul was there him and was supposedly the strongest man in the Army but he couldn't face Goliath because Goliath was it was a big and then giant man but he was the grace of God that was in David that defeated amen that Goliath he wasn't because David was wrong or he had a power in his arms or something like that but he was the grace of God Amen in other words the grace of God was sufficient for him the grace of God Amen was keeping David all this dead around me throughout this entire life and God had a purpose it meant God had a vision for him amen there was a prophecy for him that he had to be the king so no matter amen no matter what danger all the dangers that could have come to David those danger couldn't destroy him now the word David couldn't be killed until until he fulfilled it meant the promise that God has probably that God has put for him until he has fulfilled that prophecy that was given for him amen so David you heard from the prophet that he is Anointed to become a king amen that was the free that was uh that was the grace of God and David amen as the Bible says that he had five stones in his uh behead Five Stone that's the thing that you want to fight Goliath with amen if we tried to imagine that with a human mentality and a human mind that's that's impossible a man a giant man he was uh uh he had all those buckles and armors and shield and all of that and you go fight those men that man with only five Sons I mean people will make fun of you people will say but well you know you're dreaming or you know you want you you wish to you know to die but David knew the God that he was serving it meant David knew that he wasn't gonna die until that promise came to pass so he went there with five Stones amen which the prophet says that those five Stones represented Jesus Christ amen Jesus had five letters amen that represented the grace amen David was going with the grace of God Amen sometimes I asked myself a question I was I asked myself I said Lord why did you leave all those great mans in the world why did you leave all those great teachers why did you leave all those great amen those great people and then rich people and you came to reveal to me you came to reveal you came to reveal your word to me amen I tried to steal myself amen what if I'm worthy but you know I look at my life I was like Lord you know I'm not worthy you know to receive this Grace I mean it's not the thing that I do every day or it's not what I did when I was a little kid that you saved me I try to think of of a reason why God served me but what God saved me but I just can't find one amen by the only reason I could find it was because of his love amen it's his love in me amen that he loved me before the foundation the word that's what the prophet says that and so will it be upon the bride and so is it on the bride we unworthy creatures deserving of hell by his grace holds us through it look at how many lost and blind how many Sinners was there in the world the hour I got saved God saved me from purpose and I'm determined by his will to do that purpose I don't care what any else what anything else goes I want to do it amen there were so many Sinners amen there were so many people that God could save amen but God chose you and when it was not a random story or multiple choice that God has still a man just to uh choose like that but he chose you for a purpose amen he saved you because he knows that I mean he has a work for you that there's a work that you have to do there is a in the picture of God Amen there is a part of that picture that you have to fulfill there is your place in that picture amen that's the reason why you were saved amen but we have to make sure Amen to do that purpose we have to make sure we're meant to fulfill the purpose for which we were saved amen it's like the prophet says that I'm determined by his will to do that purpose amen I'm determined amen I'll Give All My Life to do that purpose and when you have to ask God lord what is my purpose Lord why what is my purpose Lord what what what what what is what is the work that you want me to do for you amen and when God revealed you that work when God revealed you Amanda the job that he wants you to do for him amen do it with all your hearts you made me suck we're hurting on wash night and God doesn't God doesn't call halfway Christians amen God doesn't call halfway singers God doesn't call off with preachers but amen it's you you're a Christian 100 Christian amen when that works is being revealed to you amen that work has been revealed to you I mean you have to pray God lord just give me the strength amend to do your will it's like the prophet says I'm determined by his will to do that purpose First Chronicles chapter 17 verse 16 the Bible says and David the king came and said before the Lord and said who am I oh Lord Oh Lord God and what is my house that thou has brought me this far amen he started to think about the Lord he started to think about what the Lord has done for him and he asked himself he said Lord who am I Lord what is my house that your Grace has brought me this far Lord I've been to to so many bottles and that so many times I faced death but Lord you still keeping me alive Lord you're still keeping me alive in my Lord and so many people try to kill me I have so many enemies and the enemies everywhere in my right left and before me behind me and they're trying to find a way where I'm where I'm sleepy or or I'm not looking and to try to kill me amen by Lord but you're still keeping me alive Lord I go to work and I go to school I come back home safe Lord I I drive and I I fly but Lord I'm still living today Lord because of your grace Lord because you're still keeping me alive well so many times I was driving and I missed accident now you know but I I came too close to death but Lord you still keeping me alive amen he's keeping you a left for a purpose amen because the prophet said that once God once God is done with you God will take you out of this life amen God will take you out of this world Amen but because you are still alive amen there is a purpose for what there's a purpose behind it amen by you have to pray God you have to ask God for that Revelation Lord reveal me the purpose will reveal me and Lord I'll be determine to do your will amen it's like the story of John Newton amen John Newton is the one who wrote the song The Amazing Grace that we sing BM ideas The Amazing Grace that almost everybody sings it might even do sometimes people sing the song but they don't understand the purpose and they don't understand the powerful words behind the song Amen the story tells us that that John Newton amen was selling slaves and when he was going to Africa and by the slaves and and coming and then sell them but one day on this ship it was just driving it was uh on the ship amen and then and then the storm came and killed almost everybody but he was still there amen and he cried Lord have mercy on us and God saved the sword and from that time it meant the best story says that from that time John Newton his life was changed and when he started serving God and he wrote the song Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound it might that sound of that Amazing Grace amen that had to save the rich like me and and when other people they were doing good works and how the people were going to visit other people who visit uh sick people in the hospital other people amen they were giving money to the Poors other people that were doing so many great things and so many great works but Lord you didn't save them but you came to save me a Wretch like Me I once was lost but now I'm found I once was blind I couldn't see your grace but now I can see amen why it's the grace of God amen is the grace of God it's like it's like the prophet says that if you try to compare amen Jesus versus the Pharisees amen you will see that the Pharisees they were doing all those great works women if somebody needs care needs a consolation that will go to the Pharisees and they will give them you know those sweet words and and if the people are sick they will go and pray for them in the hospital and if people are hungry those Pharisees will go and feed them and feed people need money those Pharisees will go and give them the money amen by Luke but but Jesus said that they were still in darkness despite those great works that they weren't doing amen because we're not safe by our works remember we are saved by the grace of God Amen we are inside where Paul Roden and uh uh I think First Corinthians or second Corinthians chapter 13 about love it says that even though I'll be able to give my my own body to be burned for my brother amen look the person to reach that level Amen to sacrifice his own body to be burned to save his brother God but even though I do that great work but if I have I don't have love inside of me even if I don't have Chariot inside of me that will be in vain amen it's not it's not about it's not a gravity or or or of the work that we do amen but it's what's inside and then what's inside it's about the grace of God the Caribbean zecharia chapter 4 6. the Bible said that so he said to me this is the word of the Lord to the robo bill not but might nor by power but my spirit saith the Lord amen it's not by might it's not by power but it's God's spirit it's by his Spirit saith the Lord amen is that same Grace that was with Noah amen when everybody was turning the the their back against the word And when everybody was rejecting the word amen by the grace of God went to Noah the grace of God helped Noah amen build that Ark and the grace of God saved Noah amen Noah God gave him the word that God built the archives the wind I will send the rain the flood will come amen it was that grace of God it wasn't the life of Noah that made him amen that it wasn't the life of Noah the the the uh or something that Noah did that God chose him amen it was that grace of God the grace of God saw him amen he was the grace of God that kept him if it was the grace of God Amen that made Noah a different man amen amen among compared to to inspire uh uh in Star City a man is the grace of God amen he was the grace of God amen that took Abraham in his house in his father's house amen the grace of God that led him Amen to that country that he didn't know to that City that he didn't know amen he was going he was being led by the grace of God Amen he was the grace of God that was telling him but Abraham you have to turn left and Abraham you have to go this way amen he was the grace of God Amen he wasn't Abraham himself sometimes didn't understand but Lord where are you leading me I don't know where I'm going amen but the grace of God was with him amen the grace of God gave him that promise that I will give you a child the grace of God Amen give him that promise so Abraham knew it meant that I'm not gonna die on this until my child I'm not gonna die until I see the promise of the Lord amen so we have many promises in the Bible amen that promise was given to us by God Amen is the grace of God Amen that gave those promises to us amen and if you have the faith of God it's like we preached the last time amen if you mix your faith amen with the with the word of God Amen you have to see those Works those promises coming to pass even when you say that Lord I'm not gonna die amen until I see those promises being fulfilled Lord I'm not gonna die amen is like the prophet says that if you need the Holy Spirit you come to the altar you stay there all night and when you stay there you pray until you receive the Holy Spirit and you say that Lord I'm not gonna lift this place until I receive the Holy Spirit Lord you will find my bones here unless you give me the holy spirit amen is like Jesus told the disciple he said go wait until you are filled with the Holy Spirit he didn't tell them that go wait for 10 days or go wait for a year or we say God go wait until you feel amen go wait until you're satisfied amen go wait until amen you felt that change inside of you amen until manage the grace of other leaders amen was the grace of God that led Abraham amen he was the grace of God that led Moses amen when his parents amen threw him in that River amen he was the grace of God that was leading that Ark that little argument was the grace of God that kept him alive amen he was the grace of God that raised him amen he was the grace of God that wasn't him amen he when he fled uh uh Egypt and he came back and he was still the grace of God that was with him amen though amen the children of Israel rejected the law but the grace of God was still there with them amen the grace of God was still there fighting all their battles amen when they didn't even ask for it amen but God was coming there man Joshua had to to fight amen the angel of the Lord came there and and then he fought for them amen when they face Jericho amen the wall of Jericho the grace of God was there with him amen the grace of God told them exactly what they had to do to break the wall of Jericho amen he was the grace of God all the day long the grace of God from the beginning Amen to the end it was God's grace leading them amen is the grace of God the prophet said that let me say this my sinner friend you may be here this morning or this night a prostitute you may be here this morning a woman chaser you may be here a drunker or a gambler or a murderer you might be here as an impure husband an impure wife you might be the violence of sinners you say I'm past that stage of redemption no you're not or you wouldn't be at the church this morning Grace will make a way for you in this dark hour if you're just accept it Adam had to be willing to accept it so do you accept it I mean it doesn't matter what you did amen but you have to you have to accept it amen the grace of God will always make a way for you amen the grace of God the fact the prophecy that the fact that you hear me the fact that there is something inside of you that is telling you that you have to repent that the refactor there is the little voice inside of you that is telling you that you have to serve God that the life that you're living it's not right amen that is the grace of God for you amen that is the grace of God and that grace of God Amen will create or we will make a way amen for your return it's like The Prodigal Son amenity took all these worth and he took all the money from his dad and said Lord he said my dad give me my inheritance amen and he went away and he started spending their money in the filthy way amen and he spent all the money but the grace of God was there amen that Grace was there when he came back to his father's house and man the father didn't blame him but the father amen welcomed him with the with his arm open amen is that Jesus amen it's like God to us sometimes we we amen we do things that are not correct sometimes we want much things that are not correct sometimes we think of things that are not correct but when we go back to him and we repent our sins amen Sorry God doesn't reject us amen but he welcomes us amen with his brain with his arm wide open say that you are my son he welcomes us amen because he shared his blood for us amen he shared his blood for us amen he gave his only begotten son even so that we who believe in him amen we might be saved amen is the grace of God and you try to think about Peter amen Peter walked with Jesus amen Peter was with Jesus all of that Peter was there and and when he didn't have money or fish didn't find fishes amen Jesus told him exactly where to go fish mnp that was the one that God said God told him that uh Peter one win when Jesus told them taught all the rest of the disciples to go and Peter said that where will we go amen Peter was the one who Jesus told him to take care of the ship amen Peter was the one to whom the revelation of Jesus Christ was given to amen and Jesus said upon this Revelation I'll build my church but look at that Peter when the persecution came and Peter denied Jesus amen that we want to be one persecution came amen amen Peter amen denied Jesus Peter wanted that didn't want to take part of that of that sufferance amen Peter did not believe the Bible even says it I think in Matthew 26 uh verse 73 that the Bible said that Peter began to curse and swear amen Peter began to do the amen but but the grace of God was inside of him the grace of God told him that what you did was wrong amen and he started to repent and sin amen but when you see that when the the the the the angel came with the word amen and the Bible says that here in Mark 16 Verse 6 and 7 he said that and he said unto them beating up for being not afraid you seek Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified he is risen he's not here behold the place where they let him but go your way tell his disciple and Peter amen the angel had to specifically name Peter amen because Peter was also the disciple the angel could just stop there but but God wanted to show Peter's Grace and he said go tell my disciple and Peter that he goeth before you in the Galilee there shall you see him and he said unto you amen no matter what Peter did it meant the grace of God was there for him amen the grace of God was there for him to forgive all his sins even the grace of God was there for him and when it was the curse of God Amen that made him realize that what he did was wrong so now you say well brother Isaac but but since we have the grace of God that means that we don't need to repent anymore that we can't sin and we can do things and and as we see it please amen the grace of God that is inside of you will keep you from doing those things amen the grace of God that is inside of you will tell you exactly when you did when you do something wrong amen will never make you feel comfortable and it will push you to go repent amen is that grace of God Amen is that grace of God inside of us amen that that makes us repent amen is that grace of God inside of us that said Lord forgive us I mean it was the grace of God in Minnesota Peter amen sometimes after sinning the devil will come to you and say that you're not worthy to talk to talk to God and and and and he and and you're not worthy to talk to him God will not listen to you amen and hear the devil we will make you sin we devil will make you do something and then after that when you want to pray and you come to your mind and say well don't pray just wait a little while until that sin go until what a little while until you forget about that don't pray right now because God will not listen to you God will not forgive your sin right now because your sin is just fresh there is no time it meant limits amen there is no specific time when we have to go and repent our sins amen whenever you feel that desire you're meant to go repent him and just go in here just go ahead and repent amen just go ahead and say Lord forgive me Lord I need your help Lord I need you Lord in My Heart Lord Lord I've done that Lord I know what I did was wrong but Lord I just need your grace Lord I need you to deliver me Lord I need your deliverance Lord Lord I need you to save me Lord I need you to watch me to claim me to make me news that I want to become a new person Lord I know that I love that thing that I did Lord I know that by myself this body loves it too much but Lord the Bible says that I'm not supposed to do it Lord but I just need the strength Lord I just need you father God help me and God will help you because God the God because God here is that sincere heart amen God hears that sincere it's that sincerity that moves God Amen is that prayer that's in spirit in your prayer it might that be that moves God and that that pushes God to come and answer you amen is that grace of God amen he says that my grace is sufficient for you amen my gracious of him before you were even born amen before the foundation of the word amen God saw you amen his grace was there amen he knew exactly amen what to do with you he knew exactly man it meant the work that he would do with you amen he knew exactly amen where you will be and he knew exactly amen his grace was there with you from the beginning amen from the day that you came out of the your mother's womb and his grace was there amen and it's the same Grace that is keeping you alive right now the man it's that same grace even sometimes when you don't when you think the amen things are not working the world the way they were supposed to be amen sometimes amen amen things are not working amen it seems like all your planes are not working well amen is still the same grace of God trying to teach you a lesson it's still that same grace of God Amen try to make a great try to form your character amen because remember the prophet says that the character is not a gift it's not a gift but it's a victory amen it's something that you have to fight for it I mean it's something that has to be formed on me and you I mean it's something that comes with experiences so when those things comes amen sickness come amen you pray God and God heals you amen it's that character man it's that faith that has been strengthened inside of you man so that when something else will come amen you will remember amen those testimonies that you had amen and it will give you Faith Amen to to just to see more result amen it's that grace of God Amen he says that his grace is sufficient for me amen you see that the grace of God was in the Garden of Eden amen God says that the day that you will eat from this tree and that day that same day you will die amen it was the word of God that word was clear you eat and you die amen but when the Bible when uh Eve ate it and he gave it to Adam remember God when God came amen certainly the Adam and Eve they were expecting for they were expecting to die over death or something like that but when God came amen God gave them the grace amen God killed the lamb but man he killed the lamb and he shed his blood and when he gave them that Grace that unmerited Grace amen when they were not worthy of living amen God came and he presented to them another way out and many presented to them a Grace amen is that same Grace that that sent Jesus on the cross amen when we we did all those things and and amen amen that's the Bible says that we us Gentiles amen we were not even worthy to go in the temple amen by Jesus God sent Jesus to Down the Cross Amen to to divide the veil Amen to give us that opportunity to go in the holiest of holies Amen to go there and to repent our sins Amen to to go there to meet God personally Amen to talk to him Amen to have a one-on-one conversation with him amen whenever we need him amen we can go to that channel and talk to him he will talk back to God to us and when he was that grace of God him enough to sin Darkness came amen and all the leaves and will work quiet amen and then Adam started hearing a thunder rolling and calling out his name Adam where are you amen he tried to hear to try to tickle fig leaf and men to cover himself remember he didn't know that that fig Leaf had the pre-order period amen he didn't know that that fake lift will wither one day it meant by God when he came in man he gave them a way out and then he gave them that that true amen close the true clothes and Men of his grace it meant that he didn't have to change the Fig leaves and day after day after day remember he shed that blood amen because the prophet said that when God sees you God sees you through his blood amen when your sins are ready man and God sees you through his red blood amen you are seen as white as no amen God will make away somehow amen God will create a way God Will Make Her Way amen you just come amen imagine Adam and may none of them even repented none of them even said the lord it's my fault none of them amen say that look but but God asked Adam what did you do that Adam said by Lord It's the wife that you give me Lord I didn't choose this wife but Lord you gave me this Weapon It's your problem if you didn't give me this wife and I wouldn't have sinned amen fbias uh if but if why did you do it Lord It's that serpent Lord if you didn't cast Lucifer out there man and serpent it wasn't here it didn't come here on Earth Lord I wouldn't have sinned it's him amen none of them amen repented of their sins but the grace of God was still there amen the grace of God still created the way up for them and when it's dark crazy man sometimes you you try to think about that Grace and you try to understand it you try to study it but it's just some it's it's it's impossible to study it's impossible to they meant to to bring that Grace in a simple words amen because you will see it meant many different examples in the Bible but you see but Lord this one you say that we're supposed to repent but this one didn't repent amen you see the thief on the cross amen this one didn't even say a prayer but he was saved it and you see this one he had to pray for I don't know how many years and you see David amen he has to pray to pray for days and lay on the floor and and and and and and and and and and all of that but but Lord you still had to save them amen there is not a simple word they meant to describe that grace of God Amen it's just so big and it's just so amen it's just the grace of God Amen Lord why did you save me amen I don't know why but it's only because of his love amen the grace of God amen the Bible prophecies that God had to transfer our sins upon him he says that now it isn't what I can do it isn't whether I'm good or not it's whether he was good I can never be good enough to make it you can't you can't be good enough to make it if you ever make it you stand in the merits of Jesus Christ I tell you that now because there is nothing else you can do but God transferred all our sins upon him and he died and because he died a sinner the Bible said his soul went to hell that's right and while he was there he preached to those that were in prison that reprie that re uh that repented not in the long-suffering of the days of Noah but it wasn't possible that he would leave his body see corruption neither he's so in hell and on the third day he rose up for a justification showing to us that as our faith is confessed in him and we've been born Anew of the spirit they are as sure as he come from the grave we will rise also in the second coming oh what a perfect hope even that's the play that's that's where we have to put our faith in amen as he has he left that tomb empty amen amen that's that's the promise that sure will rise up again and that that second commandment will rise up again amen it wasn't why we did man but he was that Grace of him amen he transferred even our sins upon Him amen who he who was sinless amen became sin amen he who amen he left Israel he left his home above him and came to this world and didn't find the house and people made fun of him people rejected him people called him devil people called him all kinds of names amen people make made fun of him even in his last time in the last minute of his breath on Earth demand people were still making fun of him amen but he had to endure all of that because of you and me and when he had to go through all those pains amen because of you and me amen amen he had to go through all of that because of you and me man because of that love that he had and when the prophet says that because of that law of God couldn't send an angel to come and save us in many words because of that law of God couldn't send uh Micah if God couldn't send all those great angels to come and save us amen but he had to come himself Amen to make himself a body it meant to save us it's like we we said it uh the other time amen God when he created the man and many created them in this in the image of God Amen but to save the man amen God had to create himself in the image of the man amen in order to come and died for us on the cross amen so that the Heaven and Earth could meet together so that heaven and earth could hug amen it was that thing that happened on the cross amen he didn't have to do it but he did it anyhow because of his love the prophet says that when people asked him but you saved people and you you raised Lazarus for people call Lazarus back from the dead and you you raise the people you state people but say why why aren't you saving yourself from that cross in my the prophet said that Jesus was able to save himself from that place amen Jesus was able Amen to kill all those Roman soldiers amen Jesus was able to to escape the the death but he decree he didn't want to do it amen because of his love amen even when he was praying he said that Lord father take this cup away from him look father take this cup away amen but that love was so deep that love was so marvelous and then he said that Lord but thy will be done Lord I just want to do your will Lord that will be done because that was the purpose for which it was sent on Earth amen he was to save you and me even he wants to take our places and to die on the cross for us amen we were supposed to die because the Bible says that amen the the Every Soul that sinneth that Soul Shall Perish amen he was our place to die amen he didn't sin he didn't insult anybody man he didn't do anything that was against the word he was the perfect man he meant but he had to die him and he transferred our sins on him and he died on the cross amen but you sit today and people rejecting him and people making fun of him and and people rejecting that Grace that that Grace that he did they meant that work the work of the Cross amen there is a song that says that there is a fountain open in the House of David to you who will believe and there are streams of Grace that's flowing down from Calvary come now and receive it there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's van and tell me what can wash away my sin nothing but the blood of Jesus oh precious is the flow that makes me wide as snow and there is no other found that I know then the fountain open in the House of David amen that Fountain was open on the crossing and that Fountain was open there where where the Bible says that blood and water and blood came out of him it meant to wash you and to make you clean water and blood came out of him it meant to wash you and make you clean them and to purify you to wash you it meant to cleanse you from all the from amen from all the sins it meant to cleanse you from everything from every filthy thing amen he did that for us amen but he says that we only think that we have to do is to come and receive it am I the only thing that we have to come we have to say that come and receive it amen he says that uh uh uh we spend money paying buyings things that that doesn't help us a lot but come and when buying water with no money and not paying anything amen because that Fountain was open the fountain was open in the House of David amen where you don't have to pay anything when you don't have to do anything just come with the faith and receive it it may come and ask for it and receive it amen God cannot force that on you amen God cannot force that on you because if you do that even has to come he has to uh really resurrect all the people that he killed in time of Noah he had to keep resurrect all the people that he killed in a town of Lord amen and then repent because he didn't because he didn't force that on them amen God would never force that on you amen but but but but but we have to willingly come amen because the way to open it the Bible says that behold I stand on the door and knock amen the Bible the prophet says that God is unable to open that door from the outside amen but you have to stand up and go to the door and open that door from the inside and let him in amen that's the only way for you to be saved amen that's the only way for you to receive it amen you have to stand up and open that door say Lord I invite you in my house Lord come and take full of authority Lord come and and be my Lord and Savior Lord come and interest in all the doors and because that's the prophecy that those within doors amen you let him in and all they do let him take charges of all those doors and let him take control of your entire life say Lord I want you to be my Lord and Savior Lord I want you to about my below that invite you tonight in my house Lord you are welcome amen that was the grace of God to us man amen as long as you're in Jesus God don't see you but he sees him amen because it's that blood that is that blood that he shed for you amen God doesn't see you but he sees him and when it's like the prophet says that when you pray in the name of Jesus amen God doesn't see your prayer but he sees Jesus praying for you amen when you're praying in the name of Jesus amen he was that grace of God that he had to kill the lamb to save the mule I mean he had to kill the lamb Amen to save me amen an unworthy creature amen somebody who was not worthy of that Grace somebody who was not worthy to be saved amen but he had to kill that lamb he had to kill his son his only begotten son it meant to save me amen so don't worry if you've sin are too much amen that's the specialty that's God's specialty amen that's God's specialty amen it doesn't matter how the the amount of your sins I mean it doesn't matter it mean what you did amen the specialty of God Amen is to set you free Amen to break all the bond that you're meant to wash you clean him into to save you from all amen from all sins amen because want perfect had to die for the unperfect amen he was perfect and he died for me who was not perfect amen by dying on the cross him and he made not he made me perfect amen amen I'm perfect through Jesus Christ amen that's why the Bible says that amen amen a child of God doesn't sin amen because he sees Jesus Christ inside of me amen is that Soul woman it's that holy spirit inside of me that doesn't sin amen I know that this body will make mistakes I know that this body every day will make mistakes I know that this body amen every hour every minute amen will desire some worthy things amen worthy thought will always come inside and we we always come in my head amen things up amen I'm not amen I don't have a shield for it amen even the prophet says that the our mind is the No Man's Land amen is the place it's the free place where the devil can come and bring all those thoughts amen but the thing that is inside of us God sees that soul that is inside of you amen God says the holy spirit amen the spirit that he had to send Amen to dwell inside of us demand is the spirit amen is the grace of God that tells you exactly hey brother you need to repent a sister what you did to what you said to your sister was not right then you need to repent you need to go back and and ask for forgiveness amen it's the grace of God amen inside of us Amen in closing about read the prophet and he says that we are your people Lord we're not under any bondage we're free the sun has made us free and we are free indeed to serve our Lord and our father we thank we thank thee talk about the Thanksgiving day for freedom every day is a Thanksgiving Day every hour is is a Thanksgiving Day who was once blind can now see who was a sinner I who I who was a sinner am now saved oh God how free we are how we can give you or give you Thanksgiving Thanksgiving from all from our heart that Jesus brought the Son of God he's not dead but he's alive among us tonight proving himself Alive by signs wonders and miracles pouring out the Holy Ghost upon his church in marvelous things and the god of Heaven o Hallelujah giving praise and glory unto God or how we thank you for these things it's a real Thanksgiving heart receive your Praises of your people receive the presence of your people Lord we love you we know that you are a rewarder of those that diligently seek you I mean every day is a Thanksgiving Day amen when you try to think about that works and the things that he did on the cross amen and and then you you think that God didn't have to do it a man he was not required Amen to do it remember he did it out of love amen that's why it was so powerful I mean it was that amazing grace that Sweet Sound Of The Amazing Grace that saved the Wretch like Me amen even though when I was lost a man down deep Amen in darkness amen he was that love of God so powerful him and reached out his hand and then pulled me out amen he was that love of God amen amen who saw me amen wherever I was and doing those things and then down there in darkness Amen in the modem and he took me out amen and he washed me clean and amen and and he gave me a purpose to leave and he gave me a purpose to serve him they may like the prophet I will say Lord with all my heart I will do with that purpose as long as I'm alive Lord I will do that purpose Lord just reveal that to me what is my purpose Lord what what do you want me to do for you Lord what do you want me what is my my place for the bride of Christ amen what what is my position Amen in that being the Bride of bro what is my position in that picture and Lord revealed that to me and I would do it with all my heart with all my soul but I will give my life for you amen thou has to be the prayer of every believer amen that has to be the prayer of every Christians amen and when you think about that grace of God when you think about what God did for you I mean when you think about how many times and God saved you from accidents amen when you think about how many times God healed you from sickness when you think about him at the times that amending that you weren't facing an impossible a situation but God brought the solution amen and when you think about all those things amen what you have to say Just Praise Him and thank him amen and Paul says that the better thing the better way to say thank you it's not just without words but with with our lives it means to thank him with our lives amen because saying thank you with our words amen anybody can say that a prostitute a man can be healed today and and say thank you Lord and go back and go do whatever she was doing before amen somebody can become today and and say thank you Lord and go back and start sinning again amen by the prophet a way to say Thank You Lord the proper Thanksgiving that we have to give him amen is our life and look to give him a consecrated life amen as a as Paul said as a Living Sacrifice amen died by ourselves and men died and killed this this body and died by ourselves amen and live for him alone as a Living Sacrifice said Lord I give you my life and do do with it whatever you want Lord just use it Lord whenever whenever you want and whenever you want and in whatever way you want to use me Lord as long as I'm serving you Lord just use my body Lord Lord use my voice Lord use my hands Lord use my feet go use my eyes Lord use my mouth and every part of my body every inch of my body Lord use it for yours for your work Lord use it for the advancement of the word of God Amen that has to be our prayers amen that has to be amen amen that has to be a resolution amen especially for the beginning of the year amen to say it to the Lord I just want to serve you this year more than I did yesterday morning than I did the year before Lord I just want to be more consecrated Lord I just want to spend more time with you Amen to have that fellowship with you Lord I just want to serve you lord lord I want to go out man and help others amen and witness like brother brother Keith was saying in this testimony Lord I just I just want to be there for you Lord and serve you just work for you just work for the kingdom of God Lord that's my desire Lord that's my prayer Lord for this year amen Lord I know that I will fail so many I know that I will I will be you know hard times and sometimes failures where sometimes I will feel like I'm failing and sometimes Amendment and things will not work the way I want it to work but Lord steer even in those days even though when the clouds are so thick but Lord I just know that the sun is always showing Lord just give me the faith to look beyond the cloud Lord just give me the faith Amen to look through the clouds and I will see your sun shining Lord just give me the faith Lord and I just want to serve you just give me that Faith amen that thick skin that fist that can't be broken amen that safe that Faith amen that that so that's unshakable that revelation amen of your word amen because when you have the revelation of your word amen you can't move the story of Adam and Eve and you'll notice that when Ed when God told them not to eat from that tree even God told Adam alone amen God Adam Eve was not created then amen but Adam had to teach e of them this is what God's saying amen but Eve amen just took it as a as a knowledge as a common knowledge that God told us that we're not supposed to do this but it wasn't really a revelation amen that's what one the devil came to tempt her amen she failed and that's why when the devil came to tempt her amen she was easily moved amen because that word amen was not revealed to her it was just a simple knowledge that that she quoted to the devil that as you call it to the serpent that God told us not to eat from that tree amen but when Adam came a man he knew that Revelation amen amen was not only a a knowledge a common knowledge but it was a revelation amen that's what he didn't that's what he chose amen the prophecy that he chose a man to eat that that treatment to save Eve amen it's the same thing with Jesus amen amen he knew exactly what he was doing him and he chose to become a sin Amen to save us Amen to save us cement that's why you had to die that's what the item women had to forsake his rightful place he meant to go down and then sin with his wife in order to vote through him and his wife can have the Redemption amen and that is the same thing that God has to forsake his rightful place it went up in heaven amen so that through him the blood of Christ you have amen the Redemption amen through him amen so that would make be redeemed amen he was that Grace that grace started back then amen from the beginning of the world and many was still the grace of God Amen that Chris went all along amen with you know up throughout all the ages and when he was the grace of God throughout the seven Church ages amen the grace of God that was building the spiritual Church of the Living of the body of Jesus Christ amen Faith virtue knowledge Temperance passion godliness brotherly love and and holy spirit amen it was the grace of God throughout those entire uh what was the grace of God throughout those entire church ages amen was the grace of God preparing you for this time amen it was the grace of God Amen preparing you amen for this age amen that's why amen all the sins of all they had to go through everything that they went through him and that's why David and I had to go through that that's what Abraham had to go through him and W to wait for 25 years he meant to to receive a son amen that's what amen amen uh uh and Noah had to go through that man to be rejected to be all alone and believe in God by himself amen that's what lot Iman had to go through that when everybody rejected him and when everybody rejected that Grace Lord and his when his family and his two daughters were the only one I mean all those people from the Old Testament in the New Testament all those people from all those ages amen they had to go through everything that they went through because of you and me amen because God knew that in this last age amen will be the hardest Asian man so we will need all those experiences from those people women to help us through this age amen we will need the experience of Abraham with Israel the experience of the faith of the faith of Abraham to help us through this age amen when will we when we'll be facing problems and we will have that faith we will remember that God once did that with Abraham so we have to have that same faith and God will do that for us amen God did that but they went through all of that because of you and me amen because we were preparing us for this age amen all of that was the grace of God Amen so we don't have to neglect it so we have to take it considerably amen we have to come like the song says come now and receive come with the faith come with the faith and receive it amen because the Bible says that he gave us out the prophet says that amen we preached today about healing that God will heal everybody amen that by Israel's we are all healed it says that amen we preach it but it's not for it that promise it's not for everybody amen it's only for those who have faith in men it's only for those that are chosen one amen it's only for those that the grace of God is shown upon them it meant the same thing we preach about salvation amenities only Amen to those that the grace of God will be given to them amen so you have to come and and amen if you feel something and God is telling you to pray amen you don't have to waste time amen you have to go right on it and stop praying and start asking God for his grace amen as long as you have faith and come and reclaim it come and claim it amen God will heal the sincere pray amen God bless you thank you Amazing Grace how sweet this sound let's save the rich like me man it was that sweet sound of
