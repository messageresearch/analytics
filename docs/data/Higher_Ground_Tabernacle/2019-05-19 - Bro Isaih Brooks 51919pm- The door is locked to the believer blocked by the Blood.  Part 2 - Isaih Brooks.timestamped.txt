[31:59] [Music]
[32:03] is called up yonder when the roll is
[32:13] called nothing to have nothing to hide
[32:29] amen well there's seven of us in this
[32:34] place am i counting right yep
[32:37] got me that's a good number Lord as we
[32:45] stand we're just going to get right into
[32:46] the word of the Lord
[32:55] yeah I appreciate what you did today
[32:59] brother Vincent I went home and I told
[33:01] my wife about that I just to love their
[33:05] sister because a lot of times you know
[33:08] I'm up here preaching and I don't see
[33:10] something sometimes I see you sometimes
[33:12] I don't so I appreciate when they're
[33:14] with so you know god is good to us and
[33:20] we love Lord I was expecting my wife to
[33:24] come but evidently I've misunderstood
[33:27] but with greats leaving as well it's
[33:31] really uh she's like a daughter to us
[33:35] when she came she just fell right in
[33:37] mind my daughter said they were very
[33:40] close to the hurry so anyway as we stand
[33:45] let us turn to Ephesians two second
[33:47] chapter our brother Frank did an
[33:55] excellent job today and I appreciated
[34:02] that kept right in there didn't didn't
[34:03] uh there was no problems at all so I
[34:07] appreciate he knows he's done it once
[34:10] now he's got to do it again so
[34:14] appreciate that
[34:17] Ephesians the second chapter will begin
[34:19] at the fourth verse III you know
[34:23] sometimes as a preacher you want to
[34:25] preach it like you get it
[34:28] flesh gets it away sometime you know it
[34:31] just seemed like the revelation of the
[34:33] Spirit can't seem to breathe brought out
[34:35] by the way of the tongue you know what
[34:38] I'm saying you see in things you
[34:39] understanding things but the the
[34:43] language barrier it's really difficult
[34:47] you can't explain it but that's how it
[34:50] was this morning I was really trying to
[34:53] really get to people to see how perfect
[34:58] God's redemption plan is
[35:01] it's flawless it's perfect it's flawless
[35:07] it's in it and it's nothing it can make
[35:11] it better
[35:12] you know like that Psalms 23 they've
[35:16] tried to perfect it but Psalm 2023 you
[35:21] know how can you change it right
[35:24] so anyway God is God is good to us
[35:29] Ephesians 2 and 4
[35:41] something else
[35:50] beginning at the fourth verse but God
[35:53] who is rich in mercy for his great love
[35:58] wherewith he loved us even when we were
[36:02] dead in sins have quickened us together
[36:04] with Christ by grace ye are saved and
[36:09] have raised us up together and made us
[36:13] sit together in heavenly places scuse me
[36:16] Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he
[36:21] might show the exceeding and riches
[36:24] exceeding riches of His grace in his
[36:28] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus
[36:32] for by grace ye are saved through faith
[36:36] and that not of yourselves it is a gift
[36:41] of God not of works lest any man should
[36:44] boast for we are his workmanship created
[36:50] in Christ Jesus unto good works which
[36:54] God have for or before ordained that we
[36:58] should walk in them so you can
[37:02] understand and we do understand that we
[37:05] only walk in a good way
[37:07] because God ordained it to be so let's
[37:11] pray father we thank you for your grace
[37:14] and your mercy we thank you for being so
[37:18] good to us Lord without you where would
[37:22] we be I pray tonight that you bless the
[37:27] service blessed to hear of the word and
[37:31] your name Jesus Christ we pray amen
[37:34] you may be seated so we started out we
[37:38] talked about the door is locked by
[37:41] locked is locked to the believer and
[37:44] we're working with hell the door and
[37:47] understand that the the gate is locked
[37:50] to the unbeliever and the make-believe
[37:56] that is heaven storm and God has the
[38:00] keys of death hell and the grave
[38:04] you know I they stay I guess this is a
[38:10] saying of a church that Peter has the
[38:14] key but Peter has the keys and the key
[38:19] was to salvation and we know that the
[38:25] key and what he he taught us and that
[38:28] was repentance and being baptized in the
[38:31] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[38:33] remission of sin that opens the door for
[38:36] you right so you and I know that
[38:40] whatever God has laid out in the
[38:43] scriptures it will come to pass
[38:47] God will prove to all men his word is
[38:52] right and when we look that's why I
[38:56] brought the scripture that took it out
[38:58] of Psalm 16 where I'll not leave my soul
[39:02] in hell I won't see you know and Andy in
[39:06] God brings and shows us by God's grace
[39:10] amen how that same scripture is reported
[39:15] in the book of Acts when Peter began to
[39:19] preach the first message showing that
[39:23] Jesus Christ resurrection was of
[39:28] something that wasn't scriptural
[39:30] but it was written in the Psalms
[39:33] according to David and understand it
[39:36] came to pass uh just like Noah when he
[39:42] was preaching 120 years it may have
[39:46] taken a long time before rain but it
[39:52] rained it actually came to pass and
[39:55] everything that God has spoken will come
[40:00] to pass his purpose will be accomplished
[40:04] now you you look at us and and and
[40:07] compare ourselves and
[40:09] when I look in the Bible I think to
[40:11] myself I mean this generation that we're
[40:15] living in is definitely the weakest of
[40:17] all generations because the Bible says
[40:20] so and it's evident the the Bible tells
[40:25] us that this generation would be weaker
[40:27] and wiser but but at the same time look
[40:30] at us we were so vulnerable I think
[40:35] about my myself when I like our brother
[40:38] was talking brother Vincent was talking
[40:40] about a real farmer you know his hands
[40:42] feel like gravel almost I forgot what
[40:44] the phrase he but I have I have taken
[40:48] the opportunity to shake men from
[40:51] foreign countries and it would have
[40:53] shake their hands I'd get embarrassed
[40:55] because mine feels so soft compared to
[40:58] this but they have labored for those
[41:01] hands you don't I mean those hands are
[41:04] their trophies because they have labored
[41:07] to get those kind of hands you know what
[41:09] I'm saying
[41:10] and to be honest with you if I had a
[41:12] choice to have this softness or that
[41:15] hardness give me the hard hands I like
[41:17] that but you know you look at these
[41:19] things and but God chose me to be in
[41:22] this and he knew the kind of man I would
[41:27] be now he knows you and I and and
[41:32] because it's so small that the group is
[41:34] I won't take my time tonight I want us
[41:36] to realize by God's grace that nothing
[41:39] can alter your salvation not even you
[41:43] if God has chosen and elected you to be
[41:47] bride you can't do one thing against
[41:52] that because you didn't choose him he
[41:57] chose you and the thing that I love
[42:00] about God and you've heard me say this
[42:02] so many times in the past God loves to
[42:06] to make something out of a mess he loves
[42:11] to see things in chaos to show his
[42:14] ability to show that he can he can bring
[42:17] light in structure to something that is
[42:22] chaotic and out of fall
[42:23] he started out that way and God loves it
[42:27] people think well I have sinned too much
[42:29] I've done too much wicked God loves that
[42:31] kind he knows how to straighten that out
[42:34] and make me and marvel at the product
[42:38] that's our God he is because he's
[42:42] dealing with we were working with divine
[42:44] love we work with a love that passes all
[42:48] understanding we can't understand that
[42:51] all I know is I crave for it I thirst
[42:54] for it I so desired that kind of love
[42:58] amen they can love the unlovable and
[43:02] love the enemy and you know I just I
[43:04] just somehow I I think oh this is this
[43:08] is amazing to me that God can can take
[43:11] this love that he have and he can
[43:15] actually feed and clothe those who hate
[43:18] him and blaspheme his name and all that
[43:21] and he he doesn't without any
[43:23] reservation and he takes a man like you
[43:28] and me a you and I and then he takes us
[43:31] in knowing we gonna make mistakes after
[43:34] he saves us huh he knows every little
[43:38] every little falter every failure that
[43:43] we have in this life it may come to us
[43:46] as a surprise but God knew when he
[43:50] called you exactly what you're going to
[43:53] do thereafter
[43:55] he's never surprised by our actions and
[44:00] yet he loves us and to secure his love
[44:08] for us he makes sure we get the Holy
[44:11] Ghost come on somebody all right look at
[44:16] this the Bible said that Jacob wrestled
[44:19] with an angel
[44:21] Jacob Amen was a shyster he you know how
[44:26] we say in the world he terms he got over
[44:29] on his brother he stole his brothers
[44:32] birthright and God honoring it
[44:36] oh I got that God knew listen listen my
[44:41] kind would do whatever's necessary to do
[44:45] to get me you understand me
[44:50] that's how Jake Jacob did whatever was
[44:52] necessary I feel this pull I know this
[44:56] call and whatever it takes I'm going to
[45:00] get that huh oh you say well what what
[45:06] what you know we fail to see just how
[45:11] God God's people do and God's people act
[45:16] you take the the sister who does that
[45:23] deceive Judah Tamar right here was Tamar
[45:29] and she wanted that seed she wanted that
[45:32] she wanted to be really in the family
[45:35] and just being married to to Judah son
[45:38] wasn't good enough she wanted to produce
[45:40] Judah you understand me because his son
[45:44] would produce Judas seed because it was
[45:48] from the same tree and so she she
[45:52] couldn't she couldn't get that and her
[45:54] sir her husband died and y'all know the
[45:56] story and she pretended to be a
[45:59] prostitute just to get Judah to lay with
[46:06] her that's right brother
[46:08] whatever it takes I see the promise in
[46:12] the book it's mine and whatever it takes
[46:16] for this to come to pass in my life this
[46:19] is what I'm going to do right it doesn't
[46:22] matter what other people think about it
[46:25] and she something drove her now watch
[46:29] this cuz see if God was behind all of
[46:32] this the enemy may have done what he
[46:34] needed to do but when Tamar Amen who
[46:38] slept with Judah listen even he knew
[46:42] that God was the only one that could
[46:45] give life so when she slept with the
[46:49] serpent what
[46:50] she say God has I have received a son
[46:54] from the Lord
[46:56] she knew that even in her wrong action
[47:00] God allowed that seed to come to pass
[47:03] somebody help here cuz you must
[47:06] understand that even when it came to
[47:07] Tamar God allowed that seed to could be
[47:16] quickened in Thema twins the understand
[47:25] what I'm saying
[47:26] what was it fulfilling God's purpose a
[47:30] lot of times when you fulfilling God's
[47:32] purpose it may not even look right to
[47:36] the natural man and yet God is in it oh
[47:41] you take Ruth and how ha ha ha
[47:46] Naomi and her husband went down to Moab
[47:48] Moab was a place they should have never
[47:50] gone they were in a backslidden state
[47:55] and that's why so much so many bad
[47:58] things happened to them because they
[48:00] were in a backslidden state but then
[48:02] Ruth said listen I'm repenting
[48:05] everything he's told I'm going back home
[48:08] where my blessings are and when she went
[48:12] back to the Ruza
[48:13] what was she willing back for blessings
[48:17] and when she got there guess what God
[48:21] met her there oh come on somebody God
[48:25] allowed beau ass not to have a wife
[48:29] a rich man could have whatever Israelite
[48:35] woman he wanted but God kept him because
[48:40] there was a certain kind of woman he
[48:42] needed and she was in Moab and God had
[48:46] to bring her out of Moab to fulfill his
[48:48] purpose you understand me
[48:52] what I'm trying to say is your life may
[48:55] look like it's chaotic it may not be the
[48:58] luck is in the right place right now but
[49:00] it still to God's glory all things work
[49:03] together
[49:04] for the good of them that love God all
[49:06] who are called into it have faith in God
[49:09] he's gonna bring it out at the end
[49:11] you'll see it you'll look back and
[49:13] wonder how I got over that's exactly
[49:16] right
[49:17] he is the mastermind he knows what it
[49:21] takes
[49:21] amen to get you where he wants you to be
[49:26] is that right
[49:28] oh brother branham just taking a bus one
[49:30] day and guess what a medium is on the
[49:34] bus cuz here brother Brandon was down in
[49:39] his gift he didn't know what it was what
[49:40] it was all about and here is a meeting
[49:43] him on the bus
[49:44] tells him about the light above his head
[49:48] do you see that did you know there's a
[49:50] light do you know what that signifies
[49:53] did you know that you were born on the
[49:57] same day Jesus was born under the same
[50:00] sign and God did this as a memorial and
[50:04] he didn't even want to hear it and God
[50:08] took a which to tell him who he was Oh
[50:16] somebody help me here God uses whoever
[50:19] he wants to you it's so amazing me
[50:30] because God that's exactly right
[50:33] sometimes we want to put him in a box
[50:35] right but let me tell you something God
[50:38] you can't put him in a box God is a God
[50:41] of a more fair with that right God
[50:46] clothed himself as a donkey spoke to a
[50:49] donkey to obey them you better stop that
[50:52] nonsense
[50:56] yah hear me so God is a God of him all
[50:59] things God can use a man he can use a
[51:02] woman he can use a cloud that's right
[51:06] listen he was a pillar cloud by day and
[51:10] a pillar of fire by night and the Bible
[51:14] said that pillar of cloud never left
[51:17] why because that day it was a cloud but
[51:21] that same cloud turned into a fire
[51:24] hey somebody cloud is made out of water
[51:28] fire is made out of something else but
[51:31] it was all supernatural it wasn't to
[51:35] gods it was just a pillar cloud
[51:37] transformed itself into the pillar of
[51:40] fire then the pillow fights went went
[51:42] back to the pillar cloud Oh somebody
[51:46] help me here that's the way God works
[51:53] what's going to happen at the end of the
[51:56] day when we come to a place and the
[51:59] people find out that God was really
[52:01] behind the veil of brother Brooke oh you
[52:05] got it what I'm saying not brother
[52:09] Brookes he makes too many mistakes yes
[52:11] God was behind that veil people say wait
[52:17] a minute now how can God use Paul when
[52:20] he's a murderer Paul helped a lot of
[52:22] people you know Christian be killed I
[52:26] could name some of them don't know what
[52:29] I'm saying
[52:29] they were afraid of Paul and yet God
[52:33] took the same man put him among his
[52:36] disciples and told them loved him
[52:39] and guess what he gave him a higher
[52:43] office made him a prophet and so now
[52:49] these people who was afraid of Paul who
[52:51] was solved has to obey what Paul
[52:54] preaches humility making sure they were
[53:01] kept humble and that's the way God does
[53:06] it God don't always choose the people we
[53:10] think he ought to choose or use the ones
[53:13] that right you you heard the story here
[53:16] was you know uh Jesse had all those sons
[53:18] and he was a shame of David and David
[53:22] was the man that God had already chosen
[53:25] already anointed him y'all know what I'm
[53:30] say
[53:31] David nuke with God before the anointing
[53:33] oil the real anointing was on David
[53:37] he had a testimony I killed a lion I
[53:40] killed a bear his brothers were nowhere
[53:42] around with all that happened but God
[53:47] had used that a lot of times these are
[53:49] the testimonies that you have are done
[53:51] when most people are not around but
[53:54] they're given to you
[53:55] because they're coming a time when God
[53:58] will do something great in the front of
[54:00] the people but he wants you to keep
[54:01] humble with it he wants you to always
[54:04] remember who did it so you and I must
[54:10] understand nothing can break the blood
[54:12] the DNA of God hallelujah it never loses
[54:17] its power and we wouldn't have never
[54:21] known but God did something great in our
[54:24] day Moses was great Joshua was great all
[54:28] of the Old Testament Saints our prophets
[54:31] were great John the Baptist Jesus ed
[54:33] dared not live one that's greater than
[54:35] John but that was their whoo y'all said
[54:41] you said brother but you better be
[54:42] careful let me tell you something the
[54:44] seventh angel messenger was the greatest
[54:47] of all prophets outside of Jesus Christ
[54:53] it wasn't just a man he didn't choose to
[54:57] be the angel God chosen to be danger
[55:02] hallelujah Moses led the children of
[55:05] Israel out of the natural Egypt this
[55:08] messenger literally delivers us and
[55:10] brings us out of the spiritual Egypt and
[55:14] it was a mystery
[55:15] we call it Babylon the Great we always a
[55:19] part of it but God use an uneducated man
[55:23] by the name of William Branham to bring
[55:26] the most powerful message ever it
[55:29] unfolded unveiled
[55:31] listen Paul talk about this what I said
[55:33] earlier today Paul says listen I'm
[55:35] trying to tell you some things some
[55:37] great things are going to happen and and
[55:39] and I want you now so I took the
[55:41] scripture and I thought okay what was is
[55:44] and what now is and will always be in
[55:46] other words solid songs with Solomon
[55:48] says there is no new thing under the Sun
[55:51] here we got all of these you know
[55:55] electronical things and we say oh we
[55:57] soap to surpass the older men of old day
[56:00] we have no idea why because God got rid
[56:04] of all the evidence we don't know what
[56:09] all they had hello
[56:13] we don't know for the one thing we do
[56:15] know by a prophet was that they were
[56:17] able to harness the rain the laser in
[56:22] order to build a pyramid they were able
[56:26] to buy the laser beam lift blocks huge
[56:31] stones tons and stack them yeah we're
[56:40] just getting into the laser and we want
[56:43] to use the laser just to kill each other
[56:45] you understand me
[56:49] but they had that technology hello oh
[56:55] come on somebody people all the man to
[56:58] Titanic was a tide telling what the
[57:00] greatest ship ever built Noah built the
[57:03] greatest an old farmer who followed
[57:11] God's blueprint was the Titanic wouldn't
[57:14] wouldn't have made it through the flood
[57:17] but God's boat did he see that I'm
[57:24] trying to tell you listen if you stick
[57:27] with God you become the greatest you are
[57:31] militant because of God right nothing
[57:36] can break the blood chain the line is
[57:40] pure it cannot be broken and when Christ
[57:43] is in you you become him he becomes you
[57:46] hallelujah it is the devil that's
[57:49] keeping us down like this because we
[57:53] mentally we we in an age of reasoning
[57:55] and thinking and processing
[57:57] and God don't ask for that he said have
[58:00] faith just believe my word walk in it
[58:03] you don't have to process it God say do
[58:07] it just do it is that right William
[58:10] Branham throw up a rock he didn't say is
[58:13] that guy wonder what God want me to do
[58:16] what is that all about I would look
[58:18] pretty silly in front of these brother
[58:20] in know he threw the rock up and when he
[58:24] threw the rock up the whirlwind started
[58:28] what happened it blasted three crosses
[58:32] out of the mountain there I've seen it I
[58:35] was there
[58:36] amen and let me tell you something each
[58:38] one of those rocks that were blast out
[58:39] of that mountain were in pyramid shape
[58:43] hello and guess what
[58:46] it was then God other than him that
[58:49] judgment has has now struck the west
[58:53] coast hallelujah
[58:56] you know what it was it was like Moses
[58:59] when they wouldn't believe the three
[59:01] signs of Moses guess what happened Moses
[59:04] took some dust from the earth threw it
[59:06] up and fleas came it began to change
[59:09] everything around because they rejected
[59:12] the gospel and because America I
[59:15] rejected the gospel that the Lord came
[59:18] right down and burst through those rocks
[59:21] three crosses represented the three
[59:23] crosses on Calvary actually there was
[59:27] four when it comes to Judas I had one of
[59:34] those rocks but somebody whose claim to
[59:36] be a Christian took it yeah I was one of
[59:42] the few that was able to get a rock oh
[59:44] lord have mercy but nevertheless let's
[59:47] move on you and I must realize that God
[59:49] will use you if you allow him is that
[59:52] right brother Brahim said one man in his
[59:54] hand and a lot of time we think he's
[59:57] talking about himself now any one man
[1:00:00] God want to use every man that could
[1:00:03] literally wipe themselves out and let
[1:00:05] God come in that's all he needs one man
[1:00:10] one
[1:00:11] person just surrender that could he that
[1:00:13] one person amen
[1:00:15] could do some exploits listen the Bible
[1:00:20] tells us and he says now listen Jesus
[1:00:22] Christ was raised from the dead and then
[1:00:25] guess what all that died in him rose
[1:00:27] with him can you imagine one day we
[1:00:32] won't have to imagine because it's gonna
[1:00:34] happen to us it is our inheritance it is
[1:00:38] what God is gonna do for us you
[1:00:41] understand me
[1:00:42] hey come on it's your truth if the point
[1:00:45] is if people can't believe that God sent
[1:00:47] a prophet in this day they don't really
[1:00:49] believe Moses they don't think about the
[1:00:55] people in Moses they all think about the
[1:00:57] people in Jesus day here they had
[1:00:59] established churches there and here come
[1:01:01] Jesus born where a poor man foxes have
[1:01:09] whole bird have nests on a man have no
[1:01:11] place to live here and didn't born with
[1:01:13] a bad reputation that is mama committed
[1:01:16] fornication bad reputation and then God
[1:01:20] puts him right into Nineveh
[1:01:22] one of the most wickedness cities their
[1:01:24] walls that's why the disciple said Kenny
[1:01:27] any good thing come out of Nineveh y'all
[1:01:30] hear what I'm saying God put it there to
[1:01:33] be a stumbling block for all those
[1:01:37] intellectuals but he said then again my
[1:01:42] sheep hear is my voice
[1:01:43] see that's what I'm saying that's why
[1:01:46] the world can't see this that's why they
[1:01:47] can't be attracted to it because only
[1:01:49] the Sheep of God can hear his voice not
[1:01:53] just talk about any preacher he said my
[1:01:55] sheep hear my voice and a prophet is the
[1:02:00] voice of God not that he's to God he is
[1:02:05] just a voice
[1:02:06] he is the instrument that God uses when
[1:02:10] Jesus descended into the lower regions
[1:02:13] he said why did not you listen to Noah's
[1:02:16] message because Noah preached my message
[1:02:21] he was my instrument he was my voice
[1:02:24] that's what we must understand God
[1:02:26] created us to use us to use our eyes to
[1:02:30] use our mouth to use our legs to use us
[1:02:33] because no man have seen him at any time
[1:02:35] so he uses us as his veil Oh somebody
[1:02:40] help me here oh please he says the first
[1:02:46] job says what prophet have a man of all
[1:02:48] his labor which he taketh Under the Sun
[1:02:51] one generation passes away another
[1:02:54] generation cometh but the earth abideth
[1:02:56] for ever the Sun Also Rises and the Sun
[1:03:00] go it down and hastens to its place
[1:03:02] where he arose the wind that goes toward
[1:03:05] the soft and turn about unto the north
[1:03:08] it were about continually and the wind
[1:03:11] returned it again according to his
[1:03:13] circuits like I was saying last night
[1:03:15] everything always returned back to its
[1:03:17] place wherever you originated from is
[1:03:21] where you're going to return hmm oh it's
[1:03:26] the truth and listen how that you should
[1:03:29] all we're brothers what about look what
[1:03:31] Judah Judah's got right there in the
[1:03:33] face of God had supper with him broke
[1:03:38] bread win but Judas could not change his
[1:03:42] nature
[1:03:42] no matter what he followed he heard the
[1:03:46] same voice he was anointed by the same
[1:03:49] voice all the others did but he was born
[1:03:53] when he was born
[1:03:55] is that right brother ever said he just
[1:03:58] could not go to Pentecost that's why I
[1:04:01] try to hit this thing so much so much so
[1:04:04] much because of a man deserves our
[1:04:06] desires the Holy Ghost God will feel it
[1:04:08] if you thirst and hunger after
[1:04:11] righteousness that's God making you
[1:04:14] thirst after her and hunger after
[1:04:17] righteousness cause you and I don't have
[1:04:19] the ability to do so why would we want
[1:04:22] God if we not of God if you was enough
[1:04:28] God you wouldn't thirst for him God put
[1:04:31] the thirst in you the thirst after him
[1:04:33] and if you see this message you know
[1:04:37] what you if you
[1:04:38] really see it that's God that means God
[1:04:41] open your eyes
[1:04:42] that means you heard his voice which is
[1:04:46] a good thing he didn't say you had to
[1:04:49] understand all of it if you believe it
[1:04:53] on him whom I have sent this is your
[1:04:57] words yes Lord what works what we do he
[1:05:00] said believe on Him whom I have sent
[1:05:02] that sure works all those who really
[1:05:07] followed Moses were saved really
[1:05:10] followed him y'all understand me
[1:05:12] all who really followed Jesus were saved
[1:05:17] you see that I'm saying all who followed
[1:05:20] Paul's teaching was saying all those
[1:05:23] angels everyone why because they were
[1:05:25] ordained for a certain group of people
[1:05:27] and everybody that caught the voice of
[1:05:31] of appall and in arenas and all the
[1:05:34] restaurants right Lutheran West I mean
[1:05:36] the real ones that caught a hold to that
[1:05:38] voice and followed them we will meet
[1:05:41] them there we'll meet them there
[1:05:45] that's your words abraham believed God
[1:05:50] and it was imputed unto him as
[1:05:52] righteousness
[1:05:54] Yohe what I'm saying he didn't say he
[1:05:56] did all that he believed but he believed
[1:05:58] it was true because every believer will
[1:06:01] make mistakes you will say Lord forgive
[1:06:03] me and Lord I'm sorry but it doesn't
[1:06:06] change the fact that you believe it is
[1:06:11] that right the Bible said that Abraham
[1:06:13] staggered not at the promise of God but
[1:06:16] if you look through the history you find
[1:06:17] out something went wrong but deep in his
[1:06:22] heart he knew it was right but flesh
[1:06:26] will make you stagger
[1:06:28] but the soul says amen
[1:06:31] the soul is either faith without the
[1:06:34] soul says Amen and because that soul was
[1:06:38] a man God imputed it as righteousness Oh
[1:06:42] somebody help me here it cannot stop the
[1:06:46] devil can't stop you he makes you think
[1:06:50] the call you're not doing great
[1:06:52] and wonders let me tell you something
[1:06:53] you are a sign in a wonder if you can
[1:06:58] live in this fantasy they eat you are a
[1:07:00] sigh and a Wanda live righteously in
[1:07:05] this age you ha no wonder no doubt Hey
[1:07:18] the scripture says the corner
[1:07:20] Ecclesiastes 11450 I know that
[1:07:23] whatsoever God do it it shall be forever
[1:07:26] nothing can be put to it
[1:07:28] no anything taken from it and God do
[1:07:31] with it that man should fear before him
[1:07:34] you understand me if God elected you he
[1:07:37] elected you to be bribed and there is no
[1:07:41] way he made a mistake
[1:07:45] hey don't make no difference you know
[1:07:49] but Paul says shall we continue in sin
[1:07:51] that grace may abound god forbid we do
[1:07:54] all we can do to live right before the
[1:07:56] Lord right live Lord but God who is rich
[1:08:05] in mercy you know you know what I'm what
[1:08:08] I'm trying to do is get you to do it
[1:08:09] just not on just to look now but look
[1:08:11] look back there and see you know Solomon
[1:08:14] how he made such a bad mistake and yet
[1:08:17] and feel god names himself or liken
[1:08:21] himself as the son of David and the son
[1:08:24] of David is Solomon and Solomon took
[1:08:29] another man's wife now it doesn't give
[1:08:32] us right to do what we do know we're not
[1:08:34] trying to justify that but I'm trying to
[1:08:37] show you how election words election is
[1:08:42] a certainty
[1:08:47] nothing can break it gossip oh I'm sorry
[1:08:51] I didn't mean to choose you then he's
[1:08:53] not God God when he saw you why you were
[1:09:00] in him
[1:09:01] everything that bout God is good so how
[1:09:06] can you be bad everything I don't care
[1:09:12] how small it might be it might be
[1:09:15] something you might have to look under
[1:09:16] microscope to see but if is in God is
[1:09:19] good it's holy and it's a part of him I
[1:09:30] love it because you know how God is not
[1:09:32] a tease
[1:09:33] you don't put something before your says
[1:09:35] ah you can have you reach 46 no you
[1:09:37] can't give it you know how we used to
[1:09:39] play with games with those kids you know
[1:09:43] but God doesn't play games it's real my
[1:09:50] mind
[1:09:52] Ecclesiastes says 1 through 7 1 & 7 says
[1:09:55] all the rivers run into the sea
[1:09:57] yay the sea is not full unto the place
[1:10:01] from which the river come hither they
[1:10:03] return again you mean all that water in
[1:10:08] the ocean how does it get all the way
[1:10:11] back up to where it came from
[1:10:13] God has a system gotta take that same
[1:10:17] water down in that in that ocean and
[1:10:19] calls the atmosphere to pull it up out
[1:10:21] of there and transport it all the way
[1:10:23] over down over here and drops it we know
[1:10:27] it is rain that rain accumulates again
[1:10:29] get back on his ride move back all
[1:10:32] around yeah only God can do that
[1:10:37] wherever it came from it returns back to
[1:10:40] and let me tell you something wherever
[1:10:42] you came from you will return back to it
[1:10:48] every single son and daughter of God
[1:10:51] that he thought of in the beginning will
[1:10:54] be there in heaven he said I have lost
[1:10:57] none
[1:11:00] one because His grace is sufficient I
[1:11:10] love it because Romans 131 and y'all
[1:11:13] know that when Paul was writing this
[1:11:16] Paul I believe Paul was under
[1:11:17] inspiration of Holy Spirit but I also
[1:11:19] believe that when Paul was writing this
[1:11:21] he probably was jumping and shouting at
[1:11:23] the same time what shall we say then to
[1:11:28] these things if God be for us who can be
[1:11:32] against us he that spared not his own
[1:11:36] son but delivered him up for what us all
[1:11:39] how shall he not with him also freely
[1:11:42] give us all things not some things all
[1:11:46] things who should lay anything to the
[1:11:50] charge of God's elect it is God that
[1:11:53] justified who is he that condemneth it
[1:11:57] is Christ that died yea rather that is
[1:12:00] risen again who is even at the right
[1:12:03] hand of God who also make intercession
[1:12:05] for us who shall separate us from the
[1:12:09] love of Christ shall tribulation or
[1:12:11] distress persecution or famine or
[1:12:13] nakedness or peril or sword aw as it is
[1:12:17] written for thy sake we are killed all
[1:12:20] the day long we are accounted as sheep
[1:12:22] for the slaughter right nay in all of
[1:12:27] these things we are more than conquerors
[1:12:30] through him that loved us now why would
[1:12:34] God give you a sword if you didn't have
[1:12:37] to fight people who want to Christianity
[1:12:42] with no battle nonsense put on the whole
[1:12:45] armour of God why would you put on a
[1:12:48] whole armor god and didn't happen you
[1:12:50] won't have to fight why would God give
[1:12:52] you a sword not just a sword a king so
[1:12:55] why because in this day you are king is
[1:12:59] that right oh he gives you the Kings
[1:13:02] sword because what the king became a
[1:13:05] king because he knew how to handle the
[1:13:06] sword that's what made him a king he
[1:13:10] wasn't just some amateur
[1:13:14] he was a king y'all understand what I'm
[1:13:18] saying
[1:13:18] think about the Kings and Roman every
[1:13:21] King had to know how to fight because at
[1:13:24] some time he one time I know that he had
[1:13:26] to be a Centurion
[1:13:27] some kind of man in the army of some
[1:13:29] sort f---eighteen right he just didn't
[1:13:33] pop up then bill King he had to work his
[1:13:36] way up and URI we are Kings and God
[1:13:41] allows us to work our way home right by
[1:13:46] his grace mmm well I am persuaded Paul
[1:13:51] says listen I'm persuaded that neither
[1:13:54] death nor life nor Angels nor
[1:13:57] principalities nor powers nor things
[1:13:59] that present nor things to come nor
[1:14:01] height nor depth nor any other creature
[1:14:04] shall be able to separate us he didn't
[1:14:07] say just me I love it when he put the
[1:14:09] u.s. there
[1:14:10] he said no thing can separate us from
[1:14:13] the love of God which is in Christ Jesus
[1:14:17] our Lord
[1:14:18] hello think about it and God used the
[1:14:23] illustration even with Adam when Eve
[1:14:26] sinned right Adam sacrificed his whole
[1:14:32] kingdom for her and she was just as
[1:14:38] guilty as all get out but he forfeited
[1:14:44] everything he possessed and if God had
[1:14:49] been a man as such this is what he
[1:14:53] wanted you to know that what Lucifer did
[1:14:57] was so evil it took God Himself to
[1:15:03] correct it Michael no other angel could
[1:15:06] do it it took Jesus Christ himself and
[1:15:11] why did he do it because of l.o.v.e
[1:15:19] he loved us so much he didn't wanna lose
[1:15:23] us and I love the Scriptures Wyatt when
[1:15:26] the scripture says in that while we were
[1:15:28] yet sinners whoo oh my god you think
[1:15:34] about it
[1:15:35] so cuz the devil thing Oh see you're bad
[1:15:36] boy you too messed up the day and God
[1:15:38] gonna put you away no but I was a sinner
[1:15:43] he loved me when I was a sinner he died
[1:15:47] for me when I was a sinner I'm no silly
[1:15:49] anymore I'm a sign to--if he died while
[1:15:53] I was a sinner what will he do for me
[1:15:54] when I'm a slang David said his mercies
[1:15:57] and do it forever his mercies are
[1:16:00] renewed every Mon immersion grace is
[1:16:03] different mercies you caught you
[1:16:06] red-handed you done it you did it
[1:16:08] the evidence is there I'm gonna still
[1:16:10] give you mercy grace is unmerited none
[1:16:18] you could do I'm gonna give you grace
[1:16:20] cuz just I just like you you know you're
[1:16:27] the one I want to give grace to right
[1:16:30] the man over here can say no no no no
[1:16:33] Lord I've been a better person I didn't
[1:16:38] make no mistake I knew I was giving
[1:16:41] grace to you understand me it's just
[1:16:45] it's just the way it is
[1:16:46] look how blessed we are we come at the
[1:16:50] eleventh hour we are called eleventh
[1:16:53] hour were cups and we get the same
[1:16:56] reward
[1:16:57] God promised to the Ephesian age I'm
[1:17:01] gonna give you a penny
[1:17:02] whatever that pity is you know it's good
[1:17:06] I'm gonna give you a penny it doesn't
[1:17:12] matter if emphasis and all the rest I'm
[1:17:13] getting wait a minute long we don't work
[1:17:15] hard yeah y'all we had to go to the gas
[1:17:17] chamber we had to get our hair stock we
[1:17:19] had to do this we had to do this and
[1:17:20] here is this man we almost finished with
[1:17:23] it and they come in at the last minute
[1:17:25] and they gonna get the same thing I said
[1:17:28] that's all that promise
[1:17:31] and we get all of that think how blessed
[1:17:35] you and I are here in the last age God
[1:17:38] brings us into a message number to tell
[1:17:41] you something I wasn't looking for this
[1:17:42] message it came to me
[1:17:44] Abraham wasn't looking for God God came
[1:17:47] to Abraham see God came to me he found
[1:17:53] me in a denomination I wasn't out there
[1:17:57] somewhere he took some people out they
[1:18:00] heard the message then they started
[1:18:02] giving me to gave it to me I gave it to
[1:18:04] a person
[1:18:05] let me change them by the time that that
[1:18:07] message circulated the church hours in
[1:18:10] it was about 62 to 72 people left one
[1:18:12] time they thought it was a conspiracy
[1:18:14] and it was but God was the one that was
[1:18:18] behind me oh yes deacons and preachers
[1:18:24] and and trustees and all that we needed
[1:18:27] to start a church God pulled it all out
[1:18:29] at one time y'all understand I'm saying
[1:18:36] God does what he wants to do so let me
[1:18:39] let me let me let me say it like this
[1:18:42] and in looking back looking back to see
[1:18:45] and seeing now to the presence if we're
[1:18:51] sitting in heavenly places in Christ
[1:18:53] Jesus understand we're living in
[1:18:57] eternity there's no other way we dis
[1:19:01] flashes of a vessel of time but we're
[1:19:05] literally living in eternity we are and
[1:19:09] one on one of these old days it's going
[1:19:11] to catch up with us brother it's going
[1:19:14] to make it happen this eternity we
[1:19:16] serving that serving enough I heard a
[1:19:18] brother using analysis just a day and I
[1:19:21] was looking at a friend of mine and you
[1:19:23] know what he said he says just like a
[1:19:24] chicken and an egg you don't even know
[1:19:28] how much that chicken is growing inside
[1:19:30] that egg the egg doesn't grow bigger
[1:19:33] it's just dead and then all of a sudden
[1:19:38] the chicken is so big it's got to make
[1:19:41] room it's got to come out of that egg
[1:19:44] and he said that's how it
[1:19:46] you can't tell how much a person is
[1:19:48] growing on the inside by the way it
[1:19:51] looked on the outside hmm
[1:19:54] that life is constantly being added to
[1:19:56] and built upon and he said one of these
[1:19:58] old days we're gonna break out of this
[1:20:00] thing like a chicken out of an egg
[1:20:04] hallelujah ain't God good it can't help
