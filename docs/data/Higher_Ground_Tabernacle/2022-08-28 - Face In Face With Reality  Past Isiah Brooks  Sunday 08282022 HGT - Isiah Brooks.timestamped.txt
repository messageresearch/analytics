[46:05] 23rd verse there john only of the events
[46:09] um
[46:17] for rebellion is as the sin of
[46:19] witchcraft
[46:21] and stubbornness is as iniquity and
[46:24] idolatry
[46:26] because thou has rejected the word of
[46:29] the lord
[46:30] he hath also rejected thee from being
[46:33] king
[46:38] resistance
[46:52] we thank you for your amazing grace
[47:00] you have been better to us than we have
[47:02] been to ourselves
[47:06] and forgive us for anything we may have
[47:08] said or done
[47:11] that has not been pleasing in your sight
[47:15] but we pray father this morning
[47:18] that you'll look beyond our faults
[47:22] and see our
[47:28] [Music]
[47:34] in your lovely name jesus christ
[47:50] reality it is very difficult for people
[47:56] to face reality
[48:00] and oftentimes it deform
[48:02] instead of facing reality
[48:06] reality they blame others
[48:11] for their shortcomings
[48:15] when we
[48:16] talk about reality lost
[48:25] to know that this thing exactly actually
[48:28] exists
[48:30] exist
[48:58] that my personality had the ability of
[49:00] swinging from left to right
[49:05] or from right to left in just a moment
[49:09] and it all depend on what was said to me
[49:14] what was done to me
[49:16] that would put me in a bad mood
[49:21] and to be in a bad mood
[49:24] it's not to be
[49:25] under the influence of the holy ghost
[49:42] uh perception
[49:46] but others have thought the same thing
[49:51] the message is not only the message
[49:54] god still a prophet
[49:56] prophet
[49:58] but we must understand
[50:01] that when william branham did come on
[50:03] the scene pilasko william
[50:06] he had the message of elijah
[50:23] denominationalism
[50:49] now i don't know how long you've been in
[50:52] the message
[51:03] like this what's coming to the message
[52:01] hallelujah
[52:03] so let me say it like this listen
[52:05] the bible says
[52:07] that the world will know
[52:10] that you are his disciples
[52:12] because of the love
[52:15] that you have one toward another
[52:18] example hallelujah but in galatians
[52:23] when the christians fought
[52:26] and when they went through all of these
[52:27] changes in corinthians
[52:46] where the prophecy is being made clear
[52:50] la prophecy andrew claire hallelujah
[52:54] you know this is going to be a tough
[52:56] message on some of you all
[52:58] if not all of you all
[53:00] it was a tough message for me
[53:02] so i i've got mine
[53:05] and now you got to get yours
[53:12] we're not living in darkness
[53:16] and we must come under we're not living
[53:18] in darkness
[53:19] and we must understand
[53:22] if this message is not changing
[54:08] is that the believers in the message
[54:13] many of us have not crossed over
[54:18] we're still wandering in the wilderness
[54:22] we're stealing our own cells and
[54:24] ourselves we're still murmuring against
[54:27] moses
[54:33] when the message have given us
[54:49] but the bible says
[55:01] [Music]
[55:04] we're
[55:19] the whole world
[55:21] will become will go totally insane
[55:26] only those who are the brides
[55:29] of christ
[55:32] hallelujah will remain in in their same
[55:36] mind
[55:39] for a long time
[55:44] but now that i see the attack my mentor
[56:14] when she believed
[56:42] 1965.
[56:44] he said the human brain
[56:48] is rodney
[56:54] and the reason why it's rottening
[57:01] hallelujah
[57:03] because everything is
[57:06] being hybrided
[57:08] from animals these are humans humans
[57:12] everything dude we're living in a
[57:14] perverted age
[57:19] hallelujah anyhow see what we must
[57:22] realize
[57:23] is that the holy ghost is the only thing
[57:27] that's going to get you through this
[57:29] shows
[57:31] you see your religion
[57:33] won't work
[57:35] you can come to church every day
[57:37] you can pay your tithe
[57:44] [Applause]
[57:49] you've got to have the holy ghost
[57:53] hallelujah
[57:54] and what's so frightening in sikhi
[57:57] people it's because many of the people
[57:59] in the message
[58:01] married the system of the message to
[58:03] somebody else
[58:05] come in contact with jesus
[58:20] i'm talking to everybody in here
[58:29] and because this religion
[58:33] has been passed on to you pascal
[58:37] many of you
[58:39] you have been brought up
[58:44] but it was the message system
[58:47] systems
[58:50] and the only way you're going to
[58:52] overcome
[58:53] this
[58:54] is that you've got to press through the
[58:56] system
[58:59] jesus christ yourself
[1:00:13] face to face
[1:00:15] fast
[1:00:16] with reality
[1:00:18] you need to examine yourself
[1:00:20] to see whether you pee in the face
[1:00:28] it's been a long time
[1:00:30] since i've seen broken and contrite
[1:00:33] spirits
[1:00:36] people weeping at the altar
[1:00:40] seeking the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:00:43] it's been a long time
[1:00:45] since i've seen people repent
[1:00:54] face-to-face reality
[1:00:56] reality if you don't repent
[1:00:59] you won't make it
[1:01:03] repentance is something
[1:01:05] christians do
[1:01:07] repentance
[1:01:18] but what is it when you're under the
[1:01:19] influence of witchcraft
[1:01:36] you're not yourself
[1:01:41] is that right so why and it comes right
[1:01:43] down to the fact that you're stubborn
[1:01:47] you feel like you got a right
[1:01:50] but that's what
[1:01:59] god is building a civilization
[1:02:02] god is building a civilization
[1:02:17] all about
[1:02:18] education hallelujah but understand what
[1:02:21] that can do will do for you my
[1:02:23] components
[1:02:24] you're not born again
[1:02:27] will make you think
[1:02:45] he had to let all
[1:03:12] because sometimes people look at me like
[1:03:14] they can
[1:03:15] do something
[1:03:19] very unfair
[1:03:22] god didn't give you a pastor who fears
[1:03:24] dreams
[1:03:26] there's not a person in here you might
[1:03:28] can whip me but like i tell people
[1:03:30] [Music]

[1:32:16] when you come face to face with
[1:32:18] realities
[1:32:24] you'll
[1:32:37] i didn't play in this message he planned

[1:33:03] with the sinner
[1:33:05] position
[1:33:08] against the christian contro

[1:34:17] that if satan can get you divided
[1:34:21] your children are endangered

[1:36:59] what my comes says she'll get over
[1:37:01] it or if i if i know she's not going to
[1:37:04] get over it no it's because women are
[1:37:06] not made like this

[1:43:15] when i came to the message
[1:43:18] some of the things they taught me
[1:43:21] was not according to what malachi 4 said
[1:43:25] on a cohort

[1:47:44] let me read what brother adam says in
[1:47:45] the message thirst this is

[1:48:03] peter did hallelujah have the holy ghost
[1:48:05] even though he was elected of god
[1:48:14] he literally failed
[1:48:16] and jesus said if you fight with the
[1:48:18] sword you will die by the species
[1:48:26] when paul heard about the rumors of wars
[1:48:29] and lost
[1:48:43] i know what prayer can do jesus christ
[1:48:45] prefer
[1:48:46] i know what confessing can do jesus call
[1:48:49] a confession
[1:48:51] and i don't know about you

[1:49:16] and i'll let nothing else
[1:49:18] stand in my way
[1:49:21] from doing what i know god wants me to
[1:49:23] do who felt good let me say it like this
[1:49:26] that means
[1:49:52] because this is
[1:50:05] what god saw in his vision
