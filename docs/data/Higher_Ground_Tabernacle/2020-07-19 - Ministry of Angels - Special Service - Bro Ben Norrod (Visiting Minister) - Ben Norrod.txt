put it back normal [Music] let's start out with the one we wrote do you want to try that one first so samantha and i uh what would you say about a month ago i guess something like that we were we were talking about psalms and we do a lot of what the world calls covers means that you do other people's songs and sing their songs and i told her i said wouldn't it be great if the lord would just give us a song somehow we could just start maybe packing about five or ten or twelve or fourteen of those songs around and and uh and we were just talking and kind of going back and forth and this little chorus began to develop and uh and i just wanna share it with you tonight it's called [Music] help [Music] do [Music] life is full of guilt [Music] yet the oil spoke of one who could forgive she [Music] cries [Music] come and touch my life [Music] ashamed of [Music] anybody ever been there and as i bowed down at the streets he made my life complete healing oil flowed from calvary i [Applause] [Music] come and touch my life don't touch me now [Music] now come touch me now [Music] [Applause] come touch me now and now i can sing thank you lord i thank you now yes sir you have touched my life

praise the lord tonight thank god thank god let's go to jerusalem was shaken cause pentecost had a ride and in an upper room chamber they would walk on a new ride and peter stood among them and he said there is no doubt in this holy ghost and fire it will make you dance and shout just like fire shut up in my bones [Music] he was filled with god's spirits i'm born to prophesy the prophet he would lift his voice and cry you'll be quiet folks demand it go home and leave us alone but how could you be quiet when there is [Music] [Music] is [Music] some people get offended because we sing and shout they say too much emotion and it's too much moving about but don't tell me to be quiet [Music] that now some people get offended because we sing and shout they say too much emotion and it's too much moving about but don't tell me to be quiet and go sit down in my view because if you feel like i felt you'll be shouting shut up in my phone [Music] holy is good saying see why bring her along amen hallelujah oh bless the lord how many believes in the power of prayer tonight just raise your hand up like this amen i i believe in it with all of my heart i want you to listen to the beautiful beautiful beautiful song called i can pray [Music] or i'm too old and i can't sing or teach and no titles do i heard what can i do for i want to do my part and i want to help the hurting with all of my heart i can pray until the war [Music] calling on your name that's something i can do [Music] i can't cry [Music] my family shows no interest and lord my child has gone so far and though i tried my best to reach them oh their hearts seemed so hard what can i do lord you bring them back to you for my family's lost and dying and my work they don't get [Music] that's something i can do [Music] i [Music] [Applause] you may be a singer you may be a preacher you may not be any of those things maybe just a regular old joke the world may look at you and say oh nothing spectacular about that one they may pass you by in the street never even give you a second glance but there's one thing that we do know if you have been baptized by the holy ghost when you open up your mouth all of heaven perks their ears down to hear what you've got to say that's right no matter if it be the day don't matter if it be the night no matter what you might be going through or the size of your difficulty if you've got the holy ghost you've got the ability to pray and the bible said he would hear from heaven and he would answer your prayers if you believe it why don't you shout a [Music] man [Music] in my secret place [Music] i can [Applause] [Music] i can't [Applause] [Music] pray [Music] care [Music] hallelujah praise the lord i believe it with all of my heart don't you hallelujah let's stand together tonight let's get right into the word of the lord amen you love the lord oh any good to us oh he's good to us all right you got your bible tonight hebrews chapter 1 verse 6 and 7. good to be in the saddle with you boys again tonight amen hallelujah hallelujah hebrews chapter 1 verse 6 and verse 7. i will speak to you tonight the lord helping us amen upon the subject of the ministry of angels the ministry of angels i mean believe in him well if you don't you will before tonight or you just amen wouldn't say amen to any of these scriptures and quotes i got laying up here if you're smart you'll keep your heart and your mind open tonight and so all right lord now this may sound like a stretch to me but if i can hear it and see it in the bible i believe it to be the truth say you've never seen an angel no you've never talked to an angel no how do you know they're around because i believe that this book up here is the infallible word of god and i believe what it says that's how i know amen by faith i believe it don't you all right now hebrews chapter 1 verse 6 amen greetings to the invisible audience tonight amen those that may be at home streaming perhaps maybe trying to avoid public gatherings amen may the lord bless you as you get this service as well and all those that may stream or pull it up on the feed later may the lord bless you and may you just god make it so real to you be just like being in the service right here tonight we come to have revival amen and i guarantee if you come with your glass empty lord jesus will fill it up i believe that yes sir i believe that with all of my heart now i'm going to make you a promise i'll preach my heart out but you've got to pull amen is that a deal you pull and i'll preach how about that we'll have church tonight you say what's that got to do with anything oh you'll see after a while amen all right hebrews chapter 1 verse 6 and 7 and again when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of god worship him and of the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire i want to read to you out of the message called christ is the mystery of god revealed and this is um just one little quotation here i want to draw your attention to brahman said so my opinion the first thing that he made was angels let's pray together over the word can we with your heads bowed tonight if you'd like to be remembered in prayer just let it be known by the lifting of your hand tonight god bless you my hands right up with you as we talk to the lord a little while father we love you lord what a privilege it is to be in your presence god what great joy we get out of being able to assemble together again in the name of the lord jesus christ lord for a little respite of time father the church doors were vacant lord preachers had to stand at the post of duty and bring the message with invisible congregations gathered around them lord for so long it seemed like the church of the living god for these past few months has been completely alone but lord jesus as i look into your word tonight and this text laying before me i am sufficiently impressed that we have never been alone nor will he ever be alone but we walk in heavenly places in christ jesus with a host of angels around us i pray father that as we look into the word tonight that you will come with thy great holy spirit that you'll anoint me standing here in the feeding place that what goes forth from here will be the word of god that will not be my idea or my thoughts or what i may feel or think about something but it will be the mind of the holy spirit then lord i pray that not only anoint me but may you go out there and anoint this body tonight the lord this little handful of people gathered in this room tonight lord may they be caught beyond this place into a heavenly realm where the angels of god and the holy spirit are dwelling lord jesus may we for a period of time be able to close our eyes to this outside world and open our hearts to that which lay before us in thy word we pray that you will bless it that you will manifest it that you will demonstrate it before us lord and in our hearts may we be receptive of everything you'll do from that word may the holy spirit fall on every need tonight every uplifted hand may the holy ghost i pray come now and minister to every heart whether it be physical emotional spiritual lord ever what the need might be financially ever what it might be may the holy ghost come tonight in the name of jesus christ we pray in jesus name amen and amen and all the saints said amen god bless you may be seated may the lord bless you real good now i don't want you to get nervous tonight what i'm going to bring to you is not going to be something so far-fetched that it'll be hard for you to comprehend as a matter of fact what i want to speak to you on and what i want to try to show you out of the word of god is something that really all of us have been acquainted with at some time in our life uh even some of the younger ones sitting around here tonight i'm sure that there'll be spots in their life even now that they can testify you know that the angels of the lord have encamped about them and have gathered around them indeed and i believe that you'll be able to see what importance this is to you and i as the body of christ and what it means to have such characteristics of the holy spirit around us as he is tonight in this way now one thing i want to try to get to you and you that's got your pencils and your papers i see you got your notes out and that's good i want you to write something down for me and i want you to write these words we do not worship angels i want you to write that down if you got your pencil in your paper we do not worship angels but we do give credit where credit is due now we could say well as a christian the bible promised us that he would be an ever-present help in the time of trouble and that's true but when we say that god is with us and that god watches over us and that god is taking care of us i want you to realize that brother branham taught us that god being omnipotent also makes him omniscient which makes him omnipresent which means basically to make it simple is that god dwells but god can't be everywhere at the same time all the time but because god knows the end from the beginning and because the holy spirit knows how to bless at certain times in our lives he knows when to show up he knows when to stay away he knows when to allow us to have prayers answered as we sung about a moment ago and when to let those prayers just linger in space for a while and god is so aware of our lives and our walk with him that nothing goes unnoticed i want you to understand that he knew the very end from the very beginning he knew what was going to take place way young before any of us ever even begin to think about what would take place in life and god knowing how everything would operate remember that the holy spirit as brother banham gives it to us in the revelation series and also in the seals he sets upon the throne of mercy and sets there and intercedes until every name that is under that lamb's book of life or on that lamb's book of life is splashed under that blood of jesus christ and brought to redemption so if the holy spirit is there then how can he be here and here and here and here and here and here will you say god is everywhere that's true and that's not true which is part of what i'm trying to bring to you tonight that the holy spirit has employed if you will a host of helpers and assistants to be able to carry out the works of god and to watch over the elect of god even though there are times that the holy spirit himself may not be felt that he may not be seen that he may not the presence or the manifestation of god may not be visible before us but because we are the sons and the daughters of god there are always present helps around the elect of god then you say brother ben well what about where where jesus said i will never leave you i will never forsake you yes that's true a part of god or the holy ghost lives inside of my heart and if i'm born again by the holy ghost the holy ghost is always there but remember the presence of the lord or as we would say the pillar of fire or the very august feeling of the holy spirit that isn't always around us and sometimes god himself will have certain responsibilities delegated out to this angelic community where you might be praying and asking for a certain thing and then maybe rather than the holy spirit deliver it himself he will send it down to an angel and an angel will deliver it to you y'all are looking at me like i'm from the planet mars or something but this is in the bible i'm going to show you after a while now i want you to think about what it means when brother branham said the first thing god made was angels now we know that in the mind of god there's this entire plan right everything that god's going to do he already got he's got it mapped out in his mind how that everything's going to be orchestrated how you and i are going to walk in the very will of god and be able to do so uh you know in whatever age or time that we would come and then we'd be able to come right to the spot of where god saw us in his mind before the foundation of the world no matter if you're 30 or 100 or like moses you're 80 or ever what you are amen whatever god planned for you brother keith that's what god intends to bring to fruition are you with me amen are you with me tonight now you notice that then the holy spirit then if in his mind he had a plan lay down then just like any good carpenter just like any good strategic planner or somebody that's maybe uh gifted at making plans i i i i probably sometimes in my own mind i wish the lord would just bless me with the gift of planting anybody ever feel that way but god is a great planter he knows how to lay everything out just in a certain way let me give an example what i mean when he created this earth the prophet of god said that he created all of the material that would be needed to make your glorified body i'm not talking about your flesh here but your glorified body and every glorified body of every saint of god that will receive a new body is already laying in this earth right now i don't care what condition she's in or how much satan's eden has perverted it and pulled out iron ore and pulled out gases and cosmic lights and what more everything that we have need of to make a glorified body it's already laying right here on this earth amen you talk about a new heavens and a new earth god ain't going to reach out there in outer space and create anew he is going to renovate and he's going to recreate and redesign this earth refashion it in the image of god of what he had in his mind of a new city new earth and he's going to use the elements of this earth to do so hallelujah it's all laying right here already and then brother bannon said that if you're a christian and you've got the baptism of the holy ghost then he said everything that you have need of for this life's journey listen to me even the rapture has already come already inside of you when you receive the holy ghost amen it's already on the inside god is a great planner he already laid out everything you have need of you don't have to reach out here in outer space you don't have to wait for him to find a new tape in jeffersonville or some new preacher to raise up or some new sermon series to come forth you don't have to wait for a new church to rise up or some new evangelist to pass by everything you have need of is already here in the form of the holy ghost and the revelation of his word all i got to do is tap into it if i understand how to get in there and reach into that revelation and pull it into myself then i can make something happen oh you say we ain't supposed to make anything happen i believe the bible said work out your own salvation with fear and trembling amen we are supposed to make something happen god didn't lay all of these elements on the earth and just let them sit there and let them work for themselves he put man on this earth to be a teller and a keeper of the garden amen and then then of god the holy spirit then if he has given me all of the elements that i need amen then it is my responsibility to call on and work with what he has laid in my lap are you listening to me amen and if i don't reach in there and get a hold of it it ain't god's fault it ain't a preacher's fault it ain't the church's fault it's mine amen because if he's laid everything in my lap then i ought to be smart enough to use what god's laid in my lap are you with me all right now you realize this is one reason why the bible said then if you don't have it it's because you ain't asked for it the words amen in case some of you all forgot it if i don't have something it's not because god didn't give it to me already it's not because i can't possess it it's because i didn't ask for it i haven't worked with what god's laid in my life it's my responsibility then to reach into the promise of god and make it work for my life amen god can't read my bible for me god can't pray for me huh god can't come to church for me god can't pull those tithings out of my wallet and put them in the envelope and god can't do that for me i've got to do that i've got to work within the confines amen you say but that's wrong the holy spirit does it all i beg to differ brother why did he say in the book of james then if any be sick let him not god but him call for the elders of the church and the prayer of a righteous man avails much let him anoint them with oil why there's something for the church to do we are co-workers with jesus christ amen i am working with him and he is working with me i feel the holy ghost in this place tonight amen it's not him doing all the work it's not me doing all the work but we are fellow laborers together in christ jesus i work and he works he works and i work amen all right then if god has all of this laid out then there is a community of angels that watch over me oh my now let's begin to dig into this a little bit shall we now i'll just go ahead and give you a little preview i'm going to preach this tonight and more likely i'm probably going to preach more of it tomorrow so if you are bored i dismiss you right now because you got two more services of this to get through tonight and tomorrow now but if this will bless you i hope you'll hang with me even tomorrow morning as i try to show you the benefit of how how all of this works together for the economy of god so let's let's dig into what the angels of the lord are all about now first of all let's look again in hebrews chapter 1 there in verse 6. now notice that the bible talks about the lord jesus he brings the first begotten into the world how many knows that's the lord jesus christ amen he was the only begotten son of god or the first begotten into this world god the jews don't think god has a son we've got the revelation he does amen god does have a son god did have a son the son said i and my father are one and now the son and the father are the same amen it's a very simple revelation if you allow yourself you yield yourself to the understanding of it amen god is not two but god is one but in order for god to redeem man god had to create a virgin born body you say virgin born sure and if you can explain to me why it was virgin born i'll tell you what happened to garden of eden amen amen if you can understand why it was virgin born i'll tell you what happened between the serpent and eve one day amen it was sexual things amen in the garden of eden that caused the fault therefore jesus had to come born above sex amen now don't don't don't don't turn your set off on me out there amen stay a little while now remember jesus coming to redeem man jesus had to come in the nature of humans not in the nature of angels but he had to come in the nature of a man watch this then let all the angels of god he said worship him then all the angels he said who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire so now we know that of course the lord jesus was then not an angel but the lord jesus was a human being now then that means that the angels of god then are a part of god's economy but they're a different level or a degree of the plan of god now we understand that the angels of the lord were created for one purpose you know what that purpose was to serve you i know that sounds strange because you don't think of yourself as being royalty but if you ever get that old hog pin mentality out of your brain you're going to start getting some things with god i'm just going to let that soak a few minutes huh oh glory to god i'm a nobody don't you never call the queen of heaven nobody. amen oh this is your them quiet places that's your that's your that's that's your turn huh oh i'm a nobody don't never call that predestinated germ inside your heart of nobody that part of god that placed it in you and i know we look at our flesh and we say i am scum i am nothing i'm a gut why in the world would god fool with such if you're a nobody and a nothing then how come the holy spirit keeps dealing with you come on somebody because you're not a nobody you are a somebody oh my you are a vip a very important person y-o-u v-i-p that's what you are you are important to god and i want you to notice that when god creates these angels their one purpose is to serve the elect now we know that the first battle that ever took place did not take place on the earth but actually the first battle between good and evil took place in heaven between michael and lucifer because remember the being the creature that that that person that we called the devil was actually an angel created in heaven now you say to yourself how in the world can people be so deceived by religion i'm fixing to tell you if you listen to me if the devil was in heaven and if the devil was created to be everything that god was except for a creator himself don't you think the devil understands religious things this is why the devil is not a drunk the devil don't live in honky tonks he resides in religious institutions satan is the author of religion i notice i didn't say a relationship with god i said religion and there is a true religion i guarantee that's a relationship with the lord jesus but the devil is the author of many of these churches that we see around the world today sure he is you take these men and women that's got this idea that if you want to become a real authentic christian just walk up and shake a preacher's hand what in the world does that got to do with being born again that is not jesus moving inside of your heart putting your name on a book believing a certain creed in a certain dogma oh glory to god i'm a christian how do i know because if you've been born again of the holy spirit then you have a birth from heaven that sets you apart from the rest of the world i am not a christian because i pack brother branham's pictures around in my house i am not a christian because i pack a bible under my arm being in a church house doesn't make you any more of a christian than being in a garage makes you an automobile whoa come on preach to me amen to be a child of god means you must be born again of the holy ghost it must be an experience deeper than religion deeper than churchianity deeper than just associating with religious people it must be an experience with almighty god you got to meet the man one-on-one and you got to come to a place that you know him and even greater than that he knows you because if you don't then you're just playing church sure and you are a target for the devil satan loves those kind of people the devil is always looking for some of these folks that are willing to trade a relationship for religion and message people are famous for it so they are why do you think we got so much nonsense running around our ranks well be careful brother being you'll discourage somebody from the truth that they're the seed of god god himself couldn't run them away from the truth amen i think it's time we start telling some truth we walk around with our little silver spoon in our mouth acting like we're the elite of the elite of the elite we ain't nothing but a 98 cents pound of dirt that needs the baptism of the holy ghost and a move of revival in our souls but i pack a picture of brother adam so so to the devil oh he can do that kind of stuff sure he can it can be religious just like me and you i'll ask you a question who started preaching to eve first so one of the first earthly preachers we have is the devil yeah hath god said he was preaching to her he was taking a text and preaching to eve he might have not been standing at a pulpit like this but he had his own platform sure he did tried to convince her against the true nature of what a christian's all about and that is having a relationship with god don't you understand the very reason that god told him not to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil was it because god was looking for a reason to to hit him over the head with a lightning bolt a reason to correct him a reason to be mean to him god told him that because that was the conditions for having a relationship if you want to serve me in other words you've got to these are the parameters you've got to work within these boundaries if you want to serve me you want to love me you want to hear my voice you want to walk with me in the cold and the cool of the evening rather this is the way you got to do it how different it was when the devil come down and begin to talk to her very thing that he tried to do was convince her that god was hiding something from her do i feel the holy ghost now that's the way the devil likes to do you and i he likes to lead us to believe that somehow god's quietness is a sign of his lack of favor lack of concern lack of care well i don't feel it i don't see it oh in a moment may god like gaza open up your eyes to what's really around you i'm trying to set a stage for you so you can see something remind you of reminding you now that the devil was the first one to preach to angels he had a brightness that was greater than all the rest of him he had a beauty that was greater than all the rest of him he had an ability that was greater than all the rest of them and he began to preach this beautiful kingdom gospel we could do a whole lot better than michael around here boys all we got to do is set this up here and have a bishop with a turnaround caller and get some of the rest of these angels over here to form a choir and sing real pretty you know we got the best singers on our side anyhow get some of these boys over here to you know run the sound in heaven and deacon in heaven and play the music in heaven we got a better bunch anyhow we can make this thing a whole lot more beautiful and can you imagine this angels that had never smoked never cursed never lied never committed adultery never had a mean thought they listened at what the devil had to say and gave up their positions in heaven over the devil's lie and you thank you with your little canary brain is going to overcome a being like that he has been at the deceiving business for 6 000 years who do you think it was that talk hitler into amen and the holocaust who do you think it was that talked napoleon into conquering the world who do you think it was that inspired alexander the great amen you think you're going to wake up with a few message quotes in your hands and using brother batman's name on your lips you're going to get anywhere you better have the holy ghost you better have greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world or you're in trouble my flesh is a human being by myself i am no match for the devil come on somebody preach to me i am no match and neither are you but with jesus on my side i am the majority amen now notice this satan then falling from heaven remember this is isaiah 14. how at the fallen from heaven o lucifer now remember when these angels fall they do not lose their gifts let's just use numbers to explain this if you had say 20 angels and all 20 angels had a 10 gift 10 being one of the highest then you had 30 more angels and they were eights and then you had 40 more angels and they were sixes and fives and ones and so on and so forth then when those angels fell from heaven they lost their estate they gave up their real estate in heaven but when they fell they didn't lose their number if they were an eight they remained an eight if they were a six they remained to six if they were a five they remained a five whatever they was they remained that way if the lord will help me i'll show you tomorrow morning that when the angel gabriel comes to see daniel remember that gabriel comes from heaven to answer the prayers of daniel and as that angel gabriel descends there was an a demon or another fallen angel that had more power than gabriel and gabriel could not overcome him until michael come and helped amen you see around us there's all kinds of activity we just don't see it i know this is hard maybe for you to fathom but let me give you a picture of what it looks like as we sit here in iowa there's all kinds of activity going on in new york do you see it how about chicago you saw them boys trying to pull down the statues just last night i think it was or today sometime and they had that big raiden and police out there throwing that tear gas they got that big war because trump told them leave them statues and things alone remember you see it on the news or read it in your phone or something there's all kinds of things going around i read a story today that there's the coronavirus is surrounding iran in a way they've never saw since the beginning surge activity is going on around you in this little place we call earth there are people that woke up in china and ate breakfast and put their clothes on did you all see it were y'all aware of it you mean to tell me that around you there has been multiplied tens of thousands of actions and behaviors and words spoken and emotions traded and money spent houses bought and cars started up and you didn't even know it well how in the world did the world even operate without you knowing all that oh come on now church so look at me that way what it goes to prove to us is that just because we don't see it or understand it doesn't mean there's not activity going on around us oh glory to god oh thank you jesus you know it's kind of like in an election they go into a room they shut the little curtain behind them or they put them off to the side and they go and they hit their little buttons and they vote for whoever they vote for you ain't got no idea whether or not that person went in there and done jumping jacks made three turns and walked out and didn't vote at all you don't know activity went on and you didn't see it i wonder friends if we could stop and be spiritual for a moment i wonder if we could ever get it placed in our minds that right now even in some of the most trying and difficult challenges of your life whether you saw it whether you didn't see it whether you felt it whether you didn't feel it there was activity going on around you god doing things that you didn't even know was possible praise be to god praise be to god now notice the angels that fell from heaven they become what anybody know tell me demons the very spirits that torments you on a daily basis they once resided in heaven holy holy holy is the lord god almighty never smoke never cuss never drank never done any of those things and the moment they fell god kicked him out of heaven praise god now let's look here notice that angels can take on a nature and a human form if you'd like to see this let's write down if you if you're writing this down or if you're looking at it later in genesis chapter 19 verse 1. notice the bible said there's two angels that went to sodom and lot sat in the gate of sodom and seeing them rose up to meet him bowed himself with his face toward the ground now brother bram explains to us exactly what took place he said he reached down grabbed the calcium the pot after the elements he went and said step in michael michael stepped in he went step in gabriel gabriel stepped in god picked up elements and stepped in a body himself now because lot was a heathen when he saw the two he said my lords but abram wasn't a heathen when he saw three he said my lord because heathens believe in more than one god amen to believe in more than one god is heathenism i don't care if you're a indian heathen african heathen or an american even north american heathen that gets the canadians too you see huh person that believes in three gods trinitarianism that's a catholic doctrine that never came from the bible god is one jesus could never be no eternal son as the catholics tell us he was born he died he rose again from the dead god is one amen now notice that when abram sees these men coming down the road hallelujah god is standing there embodied in flesh but these angels are also embodied oh praise god notice if you want to see a new testament picture of this in hebrews chapter 13 verse 2. now you can try to turn if you'd like but if you can't keep up then write them down at least watch us now he said be not forgetful to entertain strangers anybody know where i'm going for thereby some have entertained angels unawares now you know the way we are as holy ghost people as pentecostal type people and you know we we like the move of the holy spirit if we walked outside this church tonight and we saw you know a big ufo looking thing that comes it'd be all over facebook and go viral before midnight those unidentified flying objects and such right aliens from another planet some people think but i wonder if you know brother said the reason those angels come they investigate to see the condition of the world to report back to god what kind of condition the world's in god also the bible said that in the days of israel sent evil angels among the children of israel for the purpose of testing them you all didn't know your bible said that huh go look it up he did whenever these evil angels come amongst the people their mission then unawares is to sow discord but i also wonder if god don't sometimes send not unidentified flying objects but maybe god would send into the church house unidentified flying visitors maybe people that would come in and maybe god would allow that to be a check to our attitude praise the lord to see how we're going to treat a stranger or how we're going to behave to somebody that's not a part of our group i hate that expression we don't have a group we're a part of a collective of heaven amen we're christians full of the holy ghost we don't have a group or a collective or a club this ain't no club you're either born again or you're out i mean as far as children of god go right wonder how many times the lord has sent people into our lives just to check our attitude maybe somebody to your job to see how you'll react to them lord if it gets any quieter in here tonight we're going to have to call this an unidentified flying methodist church now come on now i want you to preach to me now i want you to think about what it is that you might be looking at remember god can send angels unaware you wouldn't even know they were here some guy just popped in off the street where in the world did he come from be careful what your gps tells you because it may be completely out of this or it may not even be registered on the gps where they come from [Laughter] might be a heavenly visitor oh you say well how could that be i want you to think of the hundreds of testimonies you've heard down through your life somebody be in the middle of nowhere needing gas and somebody just step up behind them out of nowhere what do you think that is i didn't just spook stories that end up on unsolved mysteries and those type of television shows it's the angels of god that encamp about the believers oh praise the lord now notice again in psalm chapter 8 verse 5 speaking of jesus again made him a little lower than the angels now i want you to notice that the difference between the angels and jesus was as far as the body and the bodily way was as an angel can be tempted in certain ways but an angel has no reproductive system there are no sex glands in an angel there are inhumans i read a study just the other day it was a peer-reviewed study from doctors and experts and people that did this kind of work and you remember when the prophet of god said for a boy not to kiss a girl on the lips because they crossed them sex glands now critics and different people throughout that's read this message they say oh it's a bunch of nonsense and trash you know what they proved just the other day they prove it when a man and a woman kiss that that those two individuals trade dna and up to 40 years later they can still find traces of that other person's dna in your mouth 40 years later don't tell me brother brahm didn't know what he was talking about when he was under that inspiration he was he was led by the holy ghost he knew what he was talking about now notice in matthew chapter 22 verse 30 jesus talking about you and i that in the resurrection we would neither marry nor be given in marriage because we would be as the angels of god in heaven now what does that mean it means that we will have no sex clans we will have no reproductive organs our bodies will be changed can you imagine never again having a sexual thought never again feeling the pressure of a sexual temptation all of that is taken out of your physical person you'll be more like the angels of heaven however you're not an angel some of y'all are trying to act like once now but put your halo away huh amen oh glory to god glory to god brother ben i'm a christian yeah i know i know you're a christian wrapped up in that old nasty good god-forsaken body of yours too and i've been preaching nearly 30 years i know what human beings are made up of sludge we're we're a walking compost of stuff come on don't you look at me that way passed down from our great great great great great all the way back in our generations that temper that impatience all of that pours right down inside of you so you just don't have your your temper but you got your great grandpappy's temper come on now well you got his nose in their ears and they're why not have all that too but an angel does not procreate therefore an angel has no progeny oh glory in luke chapter 20 verse 36 he said neither can they die anymore for they are equal unto the angels remember jesus now is referring to the flesh and are the children of god being the children of the resurrection that's what you and i are we are children of the resurrection my body is dying every day proves that the bigger my bold spot gets the more it proves i'm dying amen praise the lord you just hang on you young boys your day is coming thank god you've got the good genetics to keep all your hair thank god i've been able to keep every hair i've got thus far i mean everyone i've got not the ones i've lost but the ones of god now i want you to notice that the angels then are on a different category altogether so when the angels of god fell from heaven they fell and god kicked them out and god didn't even shed not one tear i'd like you to show me one place in the bible where god ever looked over the banister of heaven when the angels were kicked out and they become demons that god ever shed one tear for him but now let's change the scene let's go down to the earth where adam and eve are dwelling and eve gives her womb over to the devil for adultery sake has an affair with the serpent then she lives with her husband and in the womb of this woman are two seeds being conceived and birthed in the forms of cain and abel shortly thereafter now i want you to know the bible said that god did not reserve those angels unto anything once they fell he said get out but the moment that adam steps out from behind the word god goes running through the garden adam adam where are you adam do you remember in the bible when it said that in the days of noah that it repented god you know what that word repent means it means it grieved god till he cried when he looked at his fallen creation it actually brought god to tears that the man he had created had fallen into such a condition because you know he didn't preserve those angels that fell but he's been preserving me time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time again and he keeps on preserving me and he's going to keep on preserving me hallelujah because as his son i may be less perfect in the term of i can fall a lot easier i got all these conditions in my human body you'll never find an angel that has his great great granddaddy as anything angels were created in a certain level on a certain degree as we say a certain playing field if it was just my battles if it was just that then i might be you know might have an easier life to live but you realize you're not just fighting your battles you are fighting 6 000 years of your heritage of your genetics of the irish and the african and the come on you're fighting all of them generations before you all of that has been dumped into your lap you're not just fighting your own temper you're fighting 12 generations of it don't you see friends while the last day abroad is going to have to be a greater overcomer than any other group on the face of this earth amen the angels don't have such battles a human needs to sleep an angel has never slept never we have to eat some of us like to keep on eating we enjoy eating which i used to feel bad about that until i realized one day that's that's the blessed thing about being created a human even in heaven i'm going to be allowed to eat some of y'all ain't moved all night but you started moving on that one i am allowed to enjoy eating sure an angel ain't never had to stop and say uh hey boys when we're having lunch around here i'm hungry starved to death you realize that's what makes the devil such a powerful adversary the devil has never taken a vacation even while you're asleep he's pounding away at some sort of plan or some little scheme waiting for you to reach that spot are you with me the word that he can catch you when you're either weak or tired or hungry or some other kind of thing catch you in your weakness and then pounce on you makes a big difference between humans and the rest and angels an angel has never felt what it means to be pressured by worldly goods remember ladies see is a day of everybody having everything that's what makes the church so lazy we've had too much good singing good preaching soft pews nice climate makes us lazy we really don't respect what we have not like we should well friends come on be honest with me we don't respect our bibles nearly like we should we make coffee coasters out and all kinds of things the bible ain't no coffee coaster respect that book men's blood have been shed to give you that book right it's the infallible word of god this is god's quote book an angel has never had to stop and get a drink of water because he's thirsty the difference between us and them our frailties oh it looks like it would almost be pathetic notice again in hebrews chapter 2 verse 16 he said about jesus again he took not on the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham now notice again that angels do not have infinite knowledge in mark chapter 13 verse 32 but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father so the angels do not know the moment of the rapture amen even right now they don't know it in revelation chapter eight verse one when he opened up the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half an hour you know why there was silence he tells us right here christ the mystery he said because the secret nobody knew nothing about it not even the angels understood it so when the mystery of god broke open to the bride all of heaven went completely mute they had never heard nothing like that before glory to god hallelujah notice in matthew 24 36 again in the day and the hour no man no not the angels of heaven so they don't have infinite knowledge and so if the devil was an angel at one time then then that means the devil doesn't have infinite knowledge about me as he tries to make you believe he does he tries to make you believe he knows everything about you hello well don't the devil try to come to you and try to act like he knows the very desires and secrets of your heart don't he try to play you like he knows more about you than god does you know it's the same thing he done to eve yeah if god said where in the world did he get more knowledge in god how does the devil know what god's thinking god didn't even reveal that to man much less than anybody else praise the lord now notice again in first peter chapter 1 verse 12. now let's let's turn if you've got your bibles first peter chapter 1 verse 12. now i want you to i want you to notice this i love this i hear simon peter is talking about how the angels of the lord the ministers of the gospel then was preaching of course and then he says the angels of the lord did this certain action when these men of god preach watch us unto whom it was revealed first peter 1 12 not not of themselves so about the disciples now but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent down from heaven that's always the best way to hear preaching you know these guys that come around they preach are good talkers but they ain't got no real revelation ain't got no anointing you know power points and all of this listen i got nothing wrong with the powerpoint but bring your power with your point please all right intellectual talks is not how the message was delivered it was delivered with the holy ghost from heaven oh i i'm going to show you something in a minute amen keep your socks on oh oh watch us now by them that preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into this word look means to stoop down to bend the head and the body to investigate or become acquainted with something amen so the day you got saved because the angels do not understand redemption nor can they understand redemption once an angel falls they're done the day you come to the altar and the holy ghost wonderfully and beautifully delivered you the angels of god which had followed you all the days of your life remember i'll read to you in a moment jesus said there is an angel that beholds my father's face for every single one of you i don't care who they are the minute that person takes the breath of life there is an angel of god commissioned to watch over them the day they take the breath of life that's scripture hitler had an angel of god watch after him oh he said that's crazy no it's not god is an equal opportunist savior he gives everybody a chance to get saved now once that person comes to the age of accountability and then they turn away god well then they turn away the angel that watches over them you reject your own protection when you reject heavenly things and you reject god you reject heavenly things and everything that goes with god amen that's why you hear stories of people that don't even serve the lord today can point back to earlier times in their life where the holy ghost would intervene and things would take place and they'd be saved and and and delivered from certain things maybe maybe death was coming their way and they'd be saved from it oh i knew at one time something took place of course you did because the angels of the lord watched after you to give you a chance to get right with god reject god you reject the angel and everything else that comes with it elvis had such in his life don't forget that elvis presley was a twin and brother adam said whenever you were getting ready to be born there was an angelic presence that got close to your mother that made her real sweet oh i know that's your little body your little spiritual being coming into that thing but don't kid yourself that's also the presence of that angel of the lord seeing you through to birth making sure that the other presley twin lived because he had a role to play oh my god well y'all ain't got an a-man cd made up in here do you and then i can cue you and get his a-man's going i may need it before this thing's over with come on now stay with me now notice oh my that the angel of the lord that watched over you all your life they watched you when you ran and drank and cussed and that's right but now here you are at the older getting ready to get saved they see the holy ghost fall on you in a way that you can't even explain it yourself and the angels the bible said the angels of god bent over stooped what is happening is taking place why does our faces look that way we'll never understand it oh no they can't because we who are born again and have been saved by the blood of jesus christ we understand what the touch of redemption looks like whereas they will never understand what it looks like my now listen to this angels of god are servants to the elect you remember me telling you that let's turn to matthew chapter 4 verse 11. don't worry i'm only going to keep you two more hours don't get nervous some of y'all didn't even respond i'm just trying to catch you sleep it's what i'm trying to do wake up wake up amen i'm just teasing now watch that matthew chapter 4 verse 11. now now watch here's jesus in a fight with the devil right now after the devil has hit jesus with everything he can he's failing but remember jesus is tired he is tired he is weak he is hungry he has been tempted with the world i'm not just talking about a corner of it satan said fall down i'll give you the kingdoms of this world he had the ability to do it y'all all he had to do was move on this nation and that nation remember the prophet of god tells us in a message called in sierra vista called victor day he said that really the nations that are controlled by the devil he said it's one demon that resides over another and a nation and a demon resides over another nation he said that when wars are caused on the earth it is because those two demons residing on those two nations got jealous of one another and started a war on the earth don't ever think that trump controls this nation or any other president the devil controls the united states oh you say you know you don't sound much like a patriot i got news for you i'm american from the top of my head to my soul or the soul of my feet i was born in this country i respect this country i will stand by this country right or wrong as an american just like you be loyal to your family or your nation i'd be loyal to this country until they cross the word of god and then i'm not loyal to them no more where they do right i'll amend them where they don't i stay with the bible and the bible said not canada not ireland not new zealand he said this nation would make an image unto the beast in the last day yes sir she's been sowed up by the devil already no don't you don't you never put hope and and this make america great again oh they will one day sure they will when the antichrist steps down he'll make manufacturing and everything to prosper you all think that this chaos we're seeing around us is a precursor to the tribulation you need to read your bible because the bible said before the rapture would come they wouldn't be crying chaos chaos and then sudden beasts they'd be crying peace peace and then sudden destruction would fall on them remember jesus comes in a dare an hour when nobody is looking for him amen everybody's wanting to be religious right now don't kid yourself this is nothing at all like what we've been prophesied to see god has released this virus on this earth he has a purpose behind it there is a reason the nations have been shook up it could be everything from a social experiment to communism to romanism we don't know what's behind it or it could be just a simple germ making everybody sick this is not what we are looking for the devil is not trying to deceive us by the coronavirus satan's already got many of them to see with the greatest virus he could ever have him plagued with that's unbelief in the word of god message people in all have fallen prey to it amen they needed an inoculation from calvary amen they did a blood transfusion by the holy ghost and then to heal our soul of unbelief against the word of god and yet satan is so in charge of everything he tells jesus fall down worship me and i'll give you all of it and jesus had enough understanding about his bible to know that one day he would fall heir to it anyways he wasn't about to take the devil's easy way out thank you lord for that thank you for being that kind of man thank you for being a man's man jesus oh thank you lord i don't know if i'd have been brave enough i don't know if i'd have been strong enough i don't know if i'd have had the willpower the ability thank god he did now watch here in matthew chapter 4 verse 11 then the devil leaveth him that's a pretty good thing ain't it and behold angels came and what what ministered unto him oh so this was not just an old testament thing but the angels of the lord were commissioned to watch over jesus and minister unto him would you all like to know the meaning of this word i like to shout at what little shoe heels i wear off when i found this sister bruce but the word here that he uses for ministers diaconio which is in the greek to mean to wait at a table to offer food and drink at a table so glory to god so in other words these angels of god are like when you walk into a restaurant y'all and a waiter comes up and says hello my name is darren i'm here to take your order so these angels were created to serve you and i want to ask you a question if you're sitting there in the restaurant and you ain't had no drink in about 30 minutes are you gonna sit back here in the corner and say well hi they're just busy i guess if you're like most americans and most human beings you're going your blood pressure is going to shoot 200 over 445. hey amen you're going to jump up from there you're going to finger yourself around to anybody that'll listen and say get out of here i want more to drink well brother if that be the case then why don't we call for the angels of god when we're low on the holy ghost when we're low on joy when we're low on peace when we're low on victory why don't we call for the angels of the lord come and bring me a refill all of these helpers have been set to serve at your need they serve at the pleasure of the queen of heaven all right and yet we sit around like we don't have anybody to help us at all that's not true they've been commissioned to watch over us oh my listen to this rhythm says an angel of the lord he said my said we unworthy mortals have been brought to be sons and daughters of god. oh i get to shouting he says notice in that realm where angels can't even come you say angels yes sir but we are sons and daughters of god angels are servants amen the servant cannot go where the son and daughter can go the servant cannot enter into that relationship but i can with all of my sludge i can become one with the lord jesus christ where angels can only worship him and angels can only serve him i can have a relationship with him friends don't you understand what the world has tried to project to you even in their advertisements they're trying the world tries to get you to live like an angel with all these great powers of god you realize in world war one now this is just plain old bible in the book of revelation that there were the angels of the lord that was empowered and authorized by god to hold back the winds of war that's the four winds of the earth and on the 11th day at the 11th month and the 11th hour and the 11th week eleven eleven eleven eleven eleven second eleven minute ever what it was brother madam said that the entire world would have fallen to the it would have been completely wiped off altogether armageddon would have set out but the angels of god that had the four winds of the world and the four winds of war stepped out on the 11th month the 11th day and the eleventh hour and said stop and war one came to a mysterious cease and nobody understands what happened it was the power and the authority of them angels of god don't you understand the world tries to place in your hands through education through science the religion power but listen to me very very carefully i don't care how much power you attain if you miss that relationship you have nothing i said nothing amen paul even said so in first corinthians 13 though i have all knowledge all mysteries all gifts all this all that if i don't have love that's a relationship amen come on somebody if i don't have a relationship with god it means absolutely nothing i was telling my wife coming up the road you realize that's why people are the way they are society ladies has pushed women that's all you sisters for just a moment women and general not sisters so much but women has pushed women into a place of authority that they've never been called of god to be in and because they're not gifted nor do they have the ability to rule they have to harden themselves steal themself use education use prowess use psychology sink to the depths of every old ungodly underhanded method and sneaky trick when they should be at home taking care of a family sure working that's all right i'm not against a woman working but my god when she fell in the garden of eden the bible said he would be her head not the other way around i don't believe she should be no doormat either but there is an imagery that a woman should keep but ladies here says no you go out there and take your rights uh-huh what's it done pushes him into positions of great power that they don't belong in and they make a mess out of it same thing with men oh here comes your term brother just hang on amen when some men should not be authoritarians maybe just little simple things that maybe don't even have should just be raised in their family and go on to their job and come at home mowing the yard yet they become leaders and this and that through education science pushing them and elevating them into positions they don't belong in and what does it cause they have to either order to keep that position they've got to pull every underhanded trick in the book to keep it i don't care who they step on who they lie about who they cheat on let me tell you something i have been preaching since i've been a boy and i've never had to step on nobody to get a pulpit i've never had to pull an underhanded trick or play politics to have a ministry why i'm called to this so god opens up the door and the gift makes room for itself but what does society do try to treat humans like they're angels push them into power positions that they don't have the character to sustain amen well hallelujah right oh you sound very sexist brother ben against women well i'm not i don't hate women i'm not against women a matter of fact i think a woman can do anything in the bible that a man can do except for preach sex is sexist that's ladies talking but the bible said she's not allowed to do it and that means on facebook or twitter or youtube or any other place ah but i've got great knowledge you might even be smarter than your husband but if you've got wisdom not smarts but if you've got wisdom you know your place and that is to be a support to be a help mate oh god ain't none of y'all brought rotten tomatoes or rocks or daggers or something tonight what i'm trying to tell you is that if we're not careful the world system will push us into a mode of thinking that god never wanted us to get into not into all of this political push and oh we got to have big houses we got to drive fine cars and after you get all of that are you really happy you know there was a study conducted out of yale yale university in connecticut you know the big famous school ivy league they did a study on what makes people happy they found out that a person that began making a lot of money was no more happy than when they made a little bit of money they found out that when a person had a car a brand new fancy speedster some expensive deal their happiness lasted about that long and if any of y'all ever had a new vehicle or you've ever wrote in something that was practically new the first time you get a scratch on it or one of your kids throws an ice cream cone on the floor there goes your happiness they proved now this is science now i'm not talking about bible stuff i'm not about science they prove that what makes a person genuinely happy was a bit the ability to maintain a good relationship with their family with their friends people they loved and people that love them well if the scientists have enough brains to see that why don't we as christian as the christian church have enough brains to see that our happiness doesn't come from the degrees we attain or from the money we make or the jobs we make or how fancy our position becomes come on now but our happiness is based on our relationship with god career man career woman i want to be a career christian that's what i'm interested in i want to be a career believer i want to spend my life trying to achieve the top of the pyramid and i don't want to stop until i get there and i'll say it this way i don't care how many devils i have to step on i don't care how many devils i got to cheat to get there notice i didn't say christians devils right but an angel cannot enter into a relationship notice the thrust of satan's abilities i will ascend i will be like the most high i will build a kingdom i will do this isn't that the thrust of the world today that they'll tell young people and you should get an education sure learn how to do something sure please do learn how to do something more than just learn how to cook learn how to change the tire oh god some of y'all done went dead on me some of the older people don't know how to do that dude come on learn how to do things that matter things that build relationships right satan said i'm going to have the biggest kingdom of them all and that when all of that is said and done you know what the bible said about the devil that when he is brought before all humanity on the day of judgment the bible said we will narrow our eyes down into him and go is this the man this is the man that made nations to tremble so at the end of it after all his pomp and circumstance what good did it to him anyhow but if i'm standing there i've got a relationship with god i may not have authority i may not have smarts i may not have a position i may not be in the upper echelon but if i've got a relationship with god that is all that matters praise the lord oh listen to this in colossians chapter 2 verse 18 let no man begow you of your reward reward involuntary humility and worshipping of angels and we don't worship angels but we do give credit where credit is due an expectation someone said brother madam why don't you give praise to the holy spirit and say that's the holy spirit he said i had said brother i must be truthful he said he said he was sent from the presence of god he said when he comes it don't feel like the holy spirit when it comes the holy spirit makes me feel happy but when that comes it's a very sacred august feeling it's different but it's sent from god now brother branham the ministry of angels is back in the old testament that's heir that's wrong the holy ghost leads the church the man said he said that's right but there are ministering spirits sent from god special gifts to do what to do what what is the purpose of these men of these beings to guide us in a relationship with god amen maybe you've heard this so much maybe it doesn't strike your heart like it used to but friends what a pitiful condition it is for us as religious folk to come to such a place in our heart to where that we seek for anything outside of relationship you see it today in the world listen that people talk they're striving for everything else except for a deeper walk with god at the end of the day brother sister i don't care what you do in this life nothing matters unless you learn to put god first don't you realize that's what i'm talking about these angels of god with all their power all their position all their authority it means nothing at the end of the day he said that makes me happy when he comes but when this angel comes he said it's solemn it's sacred now notice here the greatest battle ever fought i'll just paraphrase this to keep from avoid reading too much tonight but notice that he said when a minister comes to the platform because angels are ministering spirits remember if they are servants their their their responsibility is to serve the needs of the body so when a minister comes to the platform an angel of god comes down to bring the anointing upon the gift in that man's life now friends i want to tell you something i want to share this with you and i hope you don't make me crazy but i i've sang and worshipped and you sat at that piano for a lot of years and i enjoy the presence of the lord i've i've you know i've been involved in music and and and played instruments for other brothers and come up to the platform and help pray at all their calls and worked and took up offerings and done all kinds of services in the church but for the last 30 years of my life as i felt it a few moments ago when i stepped up here and opened up the bible i felt it again and again and again since i've been a boy i stepped up to the platform and i can feel a presence of a being fall right in behind me what is that that's what brother bam said right here the angel of god comes down as a ministering spirit to minister to the lives of the body don't don't you understand friends that if you get a preacher or so-called preacher in this platform and that doesn't accompany his ministry don't you realize what you've got you've got somebody that knows how to read and somebody that may know how to speak but nobody that knows how to serve what is it about a preacher that god will pull him off of his notes what is that if that angel is your waiter glory and i've got a stack of notes sitting up here but you've got a need that ain't laying in my notes the angel of the lord will bring the anointing down that anointing will strike that gift i will leave those notes to be a servant to you why it's not my smarts not another man's intellect not our ability to read it's the angel of the lord that's in the camp that's why when a man steps behind here he better make sure he's met the pillar of fire before he does such a thing because i have seen it time and time again because god will represent this office up here and because god will honor this pulpit i've seen men who wasn't called step behind this desk the angel of the lord come looking for a gift to serve and because there's no gift there that guy get bomb foosled get confused stutter around never hardly say nothing make a mess out of it and walk away defeated amen but if a man of god is called just like here tonight now you don't know it because you don't know what i got laying up here but about eight different times i've left these notes up here and i keep veering here and there you don't talk about brother troy here and here and here and here and here you know why because your waiter knows that you may need a half more glass of this you may need more napkins spiritually speaking now you may need civil wear glory and he will lead the man of god anoint the man of god following the holy spirit to meet the need of the body that's sitting right there amen that's why we need gifted men not just men who know how to talk but gifted men because when a man is truly gifted of god the angel of the lord comes to that platform to anoint that word and if he is a true angel of god he will only vindicate and say what the word says because remember the apostle paul said in galatians 1 the we or an angel from heaven preached anything contrary let that angel or that man or whoever be accursed so the true angel of god it will always say what the word says you said brother be it does that make you anything yes a child of god with an economy of angels around me thank you for asking [Laughter] glory yes it makes us something that makes us royalty praise god this is why song leaders brother branham said for you to study just like the preacher does why what's the benefit well we just throw some song we've sang these songs 100 times everybody knows them let's just sing them that ain't it you're looking for the inspiration as brother knows looking for that little solemn something of the holy spirit that leads you these are the ones and every time you get right in the middle of them songs and you think well i don't want to sing that one this morning but you feel pulled to do it i know i've done songs before and how it goes i mean one time i remember i was getting ready to go entirely different i had it in my mind i'm going to sing that one i am not singing that one i had somebody come up and they sang a special i had it set in my mind all right here we go i'm going to sing that certain song and you know what i did i walked straight up to that platform and i sang the other one why not because of me the angel of the lord that's in the camp he knows the needs of the people praise god oh let me read you just a little bit of this he said that's right ministering spirits he said thy word is always confirmed in heaven oh my ministering spirit sent from the presence of god to be ministers no wonder he said they would be visited like a flame of fire now you think these angels aren't around but they're commissioned to watch over you you remember the story about the man or excuse me the two women that come before brother branham in the prayer line the one had a very very serious type of stomach trouble and the other one had cancer on a tumor hanging off her they come before brother branham and both of them are in real bad shape they both lived in the same neighborhood glory now remember these angels of god are commissioned to bring to you everything you have need of in genesis chapter 28 12 the bible said that when jacob dreamed a dream he saw a ladder and the angels of god ascending and descending upon that ladder what were they there bringing healing joy deliverance all kinds of things to the body of christ so these two women come up before brother branham he says receive your healing and go on a few days later the lady wakes up one had the stomach trouble she's feeling hungry she gets up she scrambles some eggs ate that and tasted pretty good to her and she got a cup of coffee and that seemed pretty good made her up some sausage and some bacon and she just kept eating before long she realized i'm healed my stomach's alright i'm healed well she got excited about it and she ran down the street to go tell her neighbor friend about it who was in the prayer line just with that same night and she was shaking the bed sheet looking for that cancer that had fallen off her body brother badam said what it was the angel of the lord was passing through that neighborhood glory and it brought healing to the one and it brought healing to the other why they are servants i never will forget when i was a boy i was bullied quite a bit in school you can tell from looking at me i'm not an athletic i'm a musician you know i never was really somebody that did a lot of outdoor sports and let me tell you something when i played basketball in my backyard i was michael jordan i don't care what anybody says michael jordan that was my era my time and i never was you know one of those kind of guys like that i always stayed indoors and played music and things like that i was bullied quite a bit in school when i was a boy before i was even saved i don't mean a christian now before i was even saved of course i was raised in a message church and you know we went through all kinds of little things here and there and i was sitting at a desk one time in school really really discouraged upset feeling really really down and depressed because of how you know just just mean kids can be so mean and i somehow another i just felt my arm go like that underneath the desk and i just you know just kind of went with it my arm just kind of went like that under the desk and i felt a piece of paper under there i just pulled it out and many of y'all may not know this but years ago when i was a boy they used to have this chewing gum called bazooka chewing gum you know what bazooka is yeah they had that little comic strip wrapped up in the bazooka remember so them kids they'd pop that gum in their mouth and they'd shove that paper up underneath that desk and they always had like one of them chinese fortunes on the bottom of it now this sounds ridiculous to you but i'm going to tell you what the lord did i pulled that little piece of paper i remind you i was sitting there i felt my arm go and i wiggled and i felt that little piece of paper and i pulled it out and i looked down just that very day i've been asking god god are you even here are you even around me is there anything lord are you even around and i picked that little piece of paper up i looked down at the fortune and the fortune said quit worrying i've got angels around you now you may think brother ben that is the most ridiculous thing oh it might have been to you but to me it was god in a very subtle and simple way let me know you have never been alone and you will never be alone let me tell you something little bride in your darkest hour in your greatest hours of distress with all hell is breaking loose around you you are never alone god has always got somebody surrounding you to watch over your life angels given charge to watch overs according to matthew chapter 18 verse 10. jesus said take heed that you despise not be one of these little ones by saying to you that they had in heaven they're there ain't there they're angels you know what i love when you go to number in the devils the bible said there are two hundred thousand thousand devils i can put a number on them but when i read in the book of hebrews what paul said paul said we are caught up in a mount zion with an innumerable host of angels around us i can number the devils but i cannot number the angels oh glory glory to god let me tell you something that's what i'm trying to tell you a little bride amen it is not what you see with your eyes but around you every day of your life amen remember there is more with you than there is with him out here in the world the wonder the bible says greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world we're surrounded we're surrounded my angel that gets me wanting to speak different languages i get to feeling that way i might break into french or congolese or some other lame someone dialectic ah glory always behold the face of my father which is in heaven psalm 911 speaking of jesus for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways did you notice when jesus is standing there in saint john 1 51 he said verily i say hereafter you'll see the heaven open and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man the very thing that jacob saw in genesis 28 here jesus in saint john 1 is identifying them same angels are standing right here when he was born who was it serenaded him into the world an angelic choir hosanna to the king amen now watch him hear in death luke chapter 16 verse 22 notice it came to pass that when the beggar died he was carried by the angels into the abraham into abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was buried notice no angels when the beggar died the angels were there to pack him home oh god come on somebody when the rich man died he died he was buried there was nobody to pack him why there was no longer obligated to serve him he'd done cross the line between mercy and judgment well the bible tells us what happened jesus tells him to sell all he has and come follow he didn't want to do it he walked away grieved because he had many possessions he goes on he gets richer and richer his stocks get bigger he gets more of a position more of a power all of a sudden he gets to the very pinnacle of everything he'd worked for and god speaks to him and said that's not your soul is required of you well why would god send angels down to entertain a person in death that rejected him in life that's right amen praise god but now notice in luke chapter 24 verse 23 when they found not his body they came saying they'd seen a vision of angels saying he was alive here's the disciples come to the tomb and they see that jesus is alive well it wasn't old testament only because why didn't them disciples say hey y'all we don't believe in none of y'all that's old testament when they saw them angels they believed immediately who do you all think it was that got peter out of prison y'all been to walmart where the doors go right well what do y'all think happened when peter was in prison and then saints got to praying the angel of the lord walked in between them soldiers and he come to the door and the doors went peters walked right out of them things the angel of god invented power doors way before wally world ever thought of it amen hallelujah but now watch here even in death saint john chapter 20 verse 12. let's grab this one watch in the death of the lord jesus christ in the tomb glory and seeth two angels in white sitting one at the head and the other one at the feet where the body of jesus had lain why do you all reckon they was there remember psalms said he would keep him in all of his ways and also remember david said that he would not suffer that body to see corruption so the angels of god while jesus was in hell by the way of his soul his theophany but down there defeating the devil and taking the keys out of the devil's hand amen the angels of the lord was watching taking guard standing guard over the body of jesus christ as they proved the other day about coronavirus it has tentacles and those tentacles reach out and grab another part of the virus and that's how they go i imagine them angels of god stand there for coronavirus if one of them roman soldiers would have went and that coronavirus would have started toward the body of the lord jesus stretching his tentacles out that angel will pull that sort of like cry from here my one self could corrupt in that human body so them angels of god even in death we're standing right there wanted to head one at the foot guarding the body of the lord jesus christ what do you think they do to you why do you reckon the prophet said satan can't touch you until god has done oh come on somebody why do you think the devil can't touch you he's got a whole brigade to get through there are angels all around you all the time angels are witnesses let's go a bit further let's pick it in the morning watch this in luke chapter 12 verse 8 and 9 also i say unto you whosoever shall confess me before men him shall the son of man also confess before the angels of god he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of god imagine the prophet said even in this place this heavenly realm that when the cry went out in revelation 5 how is worthy you realize i found brother brahman said it the other day i had never read this before not that i knew of brother baby said the angels of god could have stepped forward and said i am remember angels had never sinned never smoked never cursed never drink never lied never done nothing they could have answered that call who is worthy to take the book and loose the seals angels could have said i'm worthy but you know why the prophet of god said on top of what i read with that he goes on to say the reason the angels of the lord didn't say anything is because that book didn't belong to angels they had no possession of the title deed they had no claim oh come on somebody they had no rights to that title deed of redemption so the angels never stepped forth to claim their worthiness because that book did not belong to the hand of an angel brother troy it belonged to the hands of the who believer worthy them angels knew better if one of them would have stepped out he said stay in your lane girl forgive me huh well i'm worthy i've never sinned i've never smoked yes but you're not a part of this redemptive plan either as an angel of god their name was not placed on this book before the foundation of the world it's placed on mine and yours was placed on there mine and yours was placed on there but they are witnesses interesting isn't it that in the very last day before the seals was going to come open what happens to brother brown let's take it in 1962 a message called reproach for the cause of the word he said there i was sitting i broke into a vision he said these little birds coming flying in a pyramid these doves come flying in a pyramid and then he said angels of god flying in a pyramid such a blast he said surely it would be the end of my life i came to myself standing in the room oh god he said nobody could survive the blast that come i said lord if this means the end of my life let that super feeling come and he said nothing happened he said but lord if this is the visitation of the angels of the lord and the loosing of the mysteries of god let it come to the light to pack him out of the room amen what was it that preceded the opening of the seven seals seven angels in the form of a white wig one descend upon sunset mountain remember the angels of god always appear when great supernatural things are getting ready to take place oh praise the lord let's read this and let's pick up a pick up in the morning presence of the lord jesus brother says in 55 here he said now there's minor angels he said perhaps that's the angel that comes with us he said that's your humble servant he said probably a minor angel when gabriel comes he said brother something's really on the road gabriel announced the first coming of the lord jesus and gabriel will announce the second coming of the lord jesus well you know how pentecost thinks about it apostolic and many of these people that have a wrong conception of the second coming of the lord planes will be falling out of the heavens trains will be derailing cars will be turning upside down no drivers like the left-behind series with jenkins and lahay they'll have piles of clothes laying everywhere but no bodies in them that's hollywood's idea of it but do you realize that gabriel could have blew his trumpet and there have been activity in another realm and we would have never known by the sound of our ear what gabriel blew how do we know that something's happened we see the manifestation of it here on the earth it tells if something is happening here something was happening over there as well when the seven seal book come open and brother brown returns to jeffersonville to preach the seven seals look at the activity that's taking place in heaven at the time of that opening of the book none of us knew what was happening but there he's standing there on the breach and he's getting ready to tell us about the opening of them seals and brethren you can feel it on the tape he said maybe i'm just feeling this way he said but but let let him come and take his book you know i was talking that way because there was a cry going out throughout heaven who is worthy who is why are they take his book and open up these seven seals there was activity in another realm i'll show you in the morning the lord helping us these angels of god that are witnesses you realize that's how they know what's taking place in the bride you ever wonder how do these preachers stay on the same way the same wavelength because these angels of god are having conferences with daddy they know what's being preached in kinshasa they know it's being preached in roseville they know it's being preached in ireland new zealand and europe in the uk in the united states and canada they are you think you're a good note taker in church y'all ain't nothing compared to them angels of the lord that's why you should always be mindful of your attitude toward the word because one of these days if you have to stand before god and give an account to being a rejecter of it you stand there all day long so oh i didn't just be careful because the angel of the lord will just go through his notes on certain certain day in july certain time certain preachers said dust and us and lord let me tell you what i observed is that true no i preached for you i prophesied all right roll the tape glory to god so if they take notes on things to report back to god i'm never going to get through it i'm going to start blubbering what do you think they do when you do the right thing and nobody sees it when you pray and nobody hears you when you believe god in the middle of a trial and nobody's there to clap you on the back don't you ever think that the angel of the lord is there taking notes you know the bible said the bible said that when we talk about him god keeps a record when we're sitting at the restaurant and we're talking about the lord god keeps a record on such and such day they were sharing the word of the lord with one another the angels of god follow you around and take notes oh they take the bad ones too but if you don't want the bad ones to be held against you there's a way you can do that he just writes it down oh they got mad they lost their temper. lord i'm sorry about that lifts his pencil over but see this type of eraser it erases to those never been done in the first place you know how it was when you was a kid you'd raise something you you shouldn't have erased it and you'd squint you'll look and hold it up to the light i'm going to tell you something brother there's not a light bright enough to ever call your sins back up hallelujah here stands daniel on the earth he is one of the literally one of the very few in all of israel that still believes god he starts praying lord reveal to me the end time reveal to me what's taking place we'll pick it up in the morning and there daniel begins bombarding heaven with his prayers about his people israel because imagine this prophet is looking out his window and watching tens of hundreds of thousands of his people bowing to his image remember it was daniel the prophet that they made the image of because daniel done great things in the eyes of the king and the kingdom set him up as a god heathen it's hedonism to serve more than one god and this little prophet throws his windows open and see them israelites down their bow no doubt it must have gripped his godly little heart and he probably started crying lord what is going to be for the people you see that's a real mark of a god-called christian they sigh and they cry for the abominations done amongst their people they see that people get in a condition i will never understand and i realize this is going on record and it could go around the world but let me bear record and say my heart now i'll never understand some of these cold-hearted preachers around the message that will never take a burden or be concerned about the direction the people of this message are going in and then when you preach it or say something about it they say don't tell the people about it it confuses them well who in the world is going to start telling the truth so they know what's going on around them then we put our big spiritual message blinders on and pretend like there's nothing to see wrong and everything and the message is all right it's not all right our churches are getting deader and colder and more stooped at idolatry than they've ever been and yet our preachers go to conventions after convention after convention and preach good feel-good sermons and talk about the bride's authority and where she's at and yet people in their veil churches don't even have enough victory to pray through to god to be able to have the victory to last a week from service to service it ought to do something to us brother keith like it did daniel when he looked out the window that day and saw them children bowing down it ought to grip our hearts when we see people come to church and they don't have enough joy to raise their hands they don't have enough joy to say amen they don't have enough joy to worship and when they do worship you can see them they're so under bondage they're just fighting through and they're just going through the motions and they'll raise their hands or they'll clap their hands but it doesn't really have that certain something behind it that shows that they're really free they can sing i'm so glad jesus set me free but they don't even know what the taste of freedom is like it grips the heart of any true child of god to look at our people and say what is going on when you call an altar call and people are too prestigious and righteous and self-righteous they don't want to come down here and pray they don't want to have somebody lay hands on them and ask them for help we're message people i wonder on that day what the angels of the lord are going to have to say about our many attitudes but daniel looked out he saw the condition of his people and he began praying oh god what will be the condition of this thy people israel and her future state daniel so moved the heart of god at the moment he started praying there was activity in heaven i'm trying not to let the kitty out of the bag but i got to say this when you start praying with that kind of sincerity no matter if you're riding down your road in the car you know and you don't even have the words all you can just anybody ever been there you just don't know what to say you just it's enough you know it's enough that it catches god's attention and the moment you make some little motion toward him just some little insignificant thing just to let him know god i need your help it causes activity in other realms listen to this again let me read to you one more time and whosoever shall confess me before men him shall the son of man also confess before the angels of god let's buy our heads together while your heads are bound tonight let's let's just think sincerely now about what it is that's amongst us lord jesus we love you so much god what a privilege it is to be in your house and heavenly father as we are gathered into this place we come here lord not because we at least i hope that our intention isn't to come just for the sake of coming but lord truly we come to the house of the lord it is for the purpose of being able to receive from the presence of god lord all around us there are angels powers authorities even this is what the bible said about even evil things and so we don't fight flesh and blood we don't wrestle against flesh and blood but principalities spirits powers and wicked things in high places now lord i said this the other weekend and lord when i said it it surprised me that the words come out of my mouth but i feel led to say it here and that is this for some of us lord that spend every day of our life feeling like we are alone god won't you let us be able to see today that we're never alone no matter what's going on around us no matter what's taking place around us no matter what kind of difficulties or troubles we might be under we are never alone now god i don't know the hearts of the people that are here tonight i know some of these folks preached to them for a lot of years i recognize most of the faces here but lord i don't know their heart only you know that but lord would you allow some of them tonight that really need this to be like gaheza when he stood there that day elisha got the word got the message across yeah he said there's more with us than there is with him when you opened up his eyes the mountains the hills valleys everything around was full of chariots of fire and angels of the lord oh god brother brandon said they don't go away on missions he said then camp about those that fear him now lord if they are our waiters then lord whatever we have need of tonight we call for the angels of the lord to deliver to us if it be healing if it be deliverance if it be faith if it be peace it could be joy whatever it is lord we want to call for the angels of the lord not a worship of angels but lord we

[Music] oh bless the lord amen hasn't been good to be in church love the lord did this help you yeah now for you listening here and over this internet when you walk out of here tonight when you shut the little click the little x on your system i don't want you to walk out of here thinking no more i'm alone nobody cares nobody's watching nobody's paying attention nobody's protecting me when you walk out of here i want you to remember one thing and the first thing god ever did was create angels to walk with you every day of your life when you get behind the wheel of a car when you step through the doors of that hospital the angels of the lord start standing at your side and every time you make a move this way they follow you around when you go this or that they follow you they walk before you oh friend no wonder brother branham taught us we live so far below our privileges we just don't realize what's around us but now after tonight i hope you can walk out of here with a new confidence i noticed in these prayers holy spirit i just kept saying confidence courage yeah that's what we need i mean let's face facts if you listen to the propaganda that the media is shoving down our throats we ain't got a hope in a world our only hope is to spend the rest of our life walking around and mask and sanitizing our hands every time [Music] none of this was a surprise to the lord none of it none of the world's conditions it's not a surprise to god and the minute we start feeling afraid always remember you're not alone let me tell you one more thing because i may not i may go a different direction in the morning i've just about got her done tonight got i got the log but i want you to think about something real quick remember when joshua was getting ready to march around the walls remember that remember the bible said be strong good courage be not dismayed lose heart as i was with moses i'll be with you remember when moses stopped up there before pharaoh he had a he had aaron at his side remember through down the staff so on and so forth like that when the death angel come through the camp they had the blood on the doors when they stepped out into the wilderness they had a pillar of fire by night they had a cloud by day and then he says i'll be with you joshua the same i was with moses when he's getting ready to march around the walls he's standing there and all of a sudden he's looking kind of off to the side perhaps and sees a man standing there with a sword full armor on perhaps joshua grabs that sword said friend or foe he said i am the captain of the lord's host don't you understand because the angels of the lord were commissioned to follow moses when moses left here you think the world knows how to hide waldo those angels hid moses body so good that the devil still don't know where he's been hit at they have disputed about the body of moses for years now they still don't know where he's at but they'll find him one day god will take that body from wherever he's hit and he'll drop back out here in this tribulation period he'll stand right before him for three and a half years but the minute god takes moses off the scene and joshua steps forward into his commission what shows up i am from the captain i am a captain of the lord's host oh it goes to prove they wasn't alone in the exodus he wasn't alone when he was on the backside of the desert he wasn't alone when the pestilence and the coronaviruses of their day and the plagues of their day and the bird flu and the hog flu and every other the cow flew and oh it'd be just something else the next thing they break open in a laboratory will be worse than this one but don't forget children of god don't forget this message was accompanied to us by the angel of the lord why do you think he set that prophet on a platform around the world and he'd say he's not two foot from why do you think that was given to us don't you think god didn't know in the last day that it would become such a dismal bleak time that every child of god would begin feeling alone why would he let us come all the way down to the end and let us fight this out by ourselves that's what i'm here to tell you tonight we've never been alone we will never be alone amen when you're in your room and you are scared to death because you're scared of the dark little boy little girl just say lord the angels of god are here when you're going down the road and you're on a job or you got to go some far away hey coming here i got to thinking oh god some of these places i got to run in and out of they don't tell them what i'll come up against but i remember what the prophet said when a man is in the line of duty god cannot allow nothing to happen that man that's going to hinder the work he's got before him why he said the angel of the lord will go before him hallelujah i love you friends thank you for bearing with me tonight i know i get a little long-winded but it's all right it ain't gonna kill you you sat at home for months you ought to be excited for some long-winded [Music] preaching you love the lord do you let's just take a moment thank you why don't you just raise your hands in your own way i want you to think on all the times that angel of god has been there for you just thank you lord that time i was riding down the road i could have been killed that time that gun went off and it didn't shoot that time and i swallowed that thing that poisoned but it didn't hurt me oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah bless your holy name bless your holy name bless your holy name lord we give you praise we give you glory in this house oh god i feel like revival's about to break loose on us right now hallelujah let the holy ghost sweep through this place tonight lord you said you inhabit the praise of your people we give you praise tonight we give you glory in the house of god we lift your name on high we exalt your holy name oh hallelujah bless your name lord thank you for your protection thank you for your mercy thank you for watching over us thank you for deliverance thank you for the glory of god and cries out on us every day thank you lord for the strength to keep moving forward thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord thank you jesus thank you lord thank you lord blessed be his name blessed be his name and we'll give all the glory to jesus [Music] is [Music] through jesus [Music] glory god bless you friends you're dismissed tonight go on the fear of the lord [Music] worship as long [Music] oh [Music] um all the glory is [Applause] all the glory to jesus [Music] is [Music] it's cause he loves you [Music] i was in [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] me
