[0:20] enough to say how much we love you and
[0:22] have always loved you we
[0:24] met you so many years ago i think it was
[0:27] in the 90s
[0:29] when we came to your place and you
[0:32] treated us like family
[0:34] brother steve was such a kindred spirit
[0:39] and i just know by god's grace that i
[0:41] came to love him with an eternal love
[0:45] truly going to miss him i just know that
[0:47] many times that i did come to south
[0:49] africa
[0:50] my goal was to visit there and just
[0:54] at times times did not allow it to
[0:55] happen
[0:57] but i can remember see also meeting uh
[0:59] brother steve i believe it was the first
[1:01] time at brother
[1:02] isaac norriega church there in tucson
[1:06] arizona
[1:07] and i got to meet brother alistair as
[1:09] well
[1:11] there and we became family it was just
[1:14] uh something that automatically happened
[1:17] we thank god for uh you brother allison
[1:21] as well
[1:21] uh for being such an example and a
[1:24] reflection
[1:25] of brother steve's character and the
[1:27] character of jesus christ
[1:29] um we love you we've had
[1:33] numerous times of fellowship and
[1:36] especially around the word
[1:38] brother steve was a very intra
[1:41] instrumental
[1:42] in helping me to learn how to study this
[1:45] message and
[1:46] so i thank god for him will always
[1:48] remember him
[1:51] i was very saddened about his leaving
[1:53] because
[1:54] it was my earnest desire to see him
[1:57] again i have been planning to come to
[2:00] south africa
[2:01] and uh as soon as possible so hey the
[2:04] plan still is on
[2:06] as soon as the lord opened the door we
[2:08] we're coming
[2:09] but we just want to say thank you once
[2:10] again thank you for being a part of our
[2:12] lives and
[2:13] i thank god for the true example that
[2:16] our brother steve
[2:17] left and um
[2:20] i saw him live not through only through
[2:23] himself but
[2:24] i saw him live through you all as a
[2:27] family it was
[2:28] i think maybe the one of the first
[2:29] families i had ever seen
[2:31] uh that loved and respect one another
[2:35] so much and i know we must contribute
[2:38] that to the word of god in the way
[2:40] uh brother steve taught all of you uh so
[2:43] in this time of bereavement we say by
[2:45] the grace of god it's just a little
[2:47] while longer and we'll all be united
[2:50] we thank you for your love and your
[2:52] fellowship and you will always be in our
[2:54] hearts
