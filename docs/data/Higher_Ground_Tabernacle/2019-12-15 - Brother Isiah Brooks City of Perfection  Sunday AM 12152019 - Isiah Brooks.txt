the victory amen [Music] [Music] thank God for His grace amen yeah without the Lord what where would we be we thank God for each and every one of you and as we stand we're just going to get right into the word of the Lord we're going to come from Habakkuk please Habakkuk 2 will read the second and through the fourth verse then we'll read the scripture that I'm sure we are familiar with that will be Hebrews 13 and 8 so we're going to read from Abeka the second chapter beginning at the second verse and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it Terry wait for it because it was surely calm it will not tarry behold his soul which is lifted up it's not outright in him but the just shall live by his favor Hebrews 13 and 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever let us pray father we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us you have been gathered to us and we have been to ourselves we pray Lord that your perfect will be done here this morning break and destroy the yolks of the enemy and father we pray that you give each and every one of us a heart to hear as well as receive and your name or Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated hi I'm Marvel I marvel at people we all struggle we all battle we all must understand that this world is time is running out my fears or my fear is that in all that we see and all that we are experiencing the people are failing to dry draw nigh nigh are closer to God if there be a time where we should know God this is the time the veil has been read we know no church can save you no bishop no Pope salvation is of the Lord and so therefore salvation is of the Lord we must all come to know the Lord when I read the scripture there in Ibaka I thought about the vision because the Word of God says without a vision of people perish what makes us so different from organization and denominationalism is that we have a vision we had a word come through Malachi 4 and of course Amon through Amos 3:7 said God will reveal nothing except show us anything except he revealed it to his servant the prophet this is why it's important that you understand the position of brother branham and what God did through him but what good would it do you if you never catch division the message was more than just telling you that the Lord is soon to come and that the world is about to end and that the world is going to go up in fire the message in itself was a message of grace it was one that God gave us it was one that God gave us to escape because God always give men an Avenue out he's a just God he's a God that that's so merciful David even said that his mercy endures to all generations they are renewed every morning and I don't know about you I know I have grace but I desire his mercy all the time why because I have been born in sinful flesh and when you're born in sinful flesh that means you will do sinful things we are growing into Christ we don't become the very image of Christ immediately just like a seed doesn't become corn immediately it must go through a process that process it must go through in-county must encounter summer winter spring and fall it must have various seasons to to make it mature when you and I as a Christian must understand that all of the trials in the tests that we go through is is ordained to bring you to maturity I entitled this message because a city of perfection and we have been working with that dealing with the new world and a higher calling a higher being and how that God by His Word is I like that word evolving causing us to evolve it into his very image it's a higher calling it's a being that we can't even comprehend but it is the being that God is developing us into man was the highest of all God's order but man fell and then Jesus Christ became the highest of all orders and so therefore because of the fall we all came into the image of Adam but now God is trying to get us to come into the image of Jesus Christ I'm taking my time here this morning because a little story was told and this story was concerning a man by the name of Daniel curry and Daniel curry was an evangelist and had been one for a long period of time Danya curry dreamed that he had died then the Korean dream that he had gone into the to up up and I like that idea because he went up he didn't go down he went up but when he came to the gate the gate keeper could not find his name who that's bad when you go up and you got to face the gatekeeper and he finds out that your name is not on the books and we find out that the gate keeper went through all the books and he came back and he said to mr. curry I'm sorry to inform on you I'm almost about ready to faint but your name is not here see there have been a lot of disappointments in life but when it comes to that I think that could have been and more than likely what's the greatest disappointment that Danielle Curie had ever experienced the angel said I can't find it it's nowhere to be found and so therefore you've got to appeal before the white throne judgment brother Daniel Curie said he began to travel through light and he said it's a different thing when you are in the presence of that light say in the presence of that light the little things everything becomes basically illuminated you began to see things about yourself maybe perhaps you forgot and something said to Daniel Kerr you can't come here because only perfection comes into this place and then the angel began to ask Daniel Currie have you ever lied have you ever stolen have you ever done deals and different things and everything that angel asked Daniel Kerr he says I'm guilty I'm guilty of it and he said amen at a moment's time he said his bones began to get you know to pull apart because he was expecting that blast from God to come say depart for me he said but instead of that he said he heard the sweetest voice that ever heard no mother could speak like that voice and he said I turn to look and I saw the sweetest face any mother's face I never seen anything he said that could compare with that face and he walked close to me he put his arms around me and said father no Daniel Currie wasn't perfect on earth but in earth he stood for me now in heaven I'm standing for him what a relief that it was the grace of God even then that made Daniel Currie worthy but what if you have a report that you didn't even stand for him on earth because Jesus said if you are ashamed of me among men I will be ashamed of you before my father I was working and working with this perfection because none of us within ourselves could ever produce it it's not by power it's not by might but it's by the extolling spirit and I was reading and I was studying seeing that Jesus Christ was the expressed image of God and all of us must understand the oneness of God by now God was in Christ Jesus was the very body that held the fullness of God being that he was still did not limit God because God is omniscient he knows everything he's honest I'm the present because of his knowledge and you and I must understand that he understands everything we're going through he knows our thoughts whether they be good or bad he knows every intent of the heart in other words there's nothing you can hide from him but there's something that God intends to do with you no matter how no-good you think yourself yes to you you may be the greatest hypocrite in the world but even then is not what you think about yourself it's what God thinks about you and when you and I understand the love of God the Bible said how rich and how pure the love of God move beyond all of your limitations and your boundaries and the whole purpose of disick creation was to express his love to his creation you understand me because it's not him that will it no he's and run it but God this shows mercy this is why I don't understand Christians there are so many Christians with so many sad and faces and it just I can't comprehend it when such a love and such a grace and such a mercy has been to you and all you can do is look down instead of looking up it makes no sense to me the only thing that I can understand is that somewhere you missing the revelation of Calvary and you can't even be truly saved without that you must understand that Calvary took away all your guilt and shame hallelujah he became naked that you and I would become clothed hallelujah he suffered all of your reproach he suffered all and bought all of your sins and when you cast yourself upon him is that right the Bible says he became sin that you might become the righteousness of God I claim this righteousness I wear his righteousness you understand what I'm saying it's like putting on the garment this flash is filthy but the garment is holy hallelujah it is his blood it is this is anointing it is his blood that covers me hallelujah and without his blood I'm yet the sinner what God needed is genuine Christians I'm coming genuine Christian with genuine faith I'm not talking about a faith that works with hope I'm talking about a faith that has been revealed to you it's like when Mary didn't understand Amen how on earth was this child going to be born with me not knowing a man and with God amen address Marian and began to tell her that the Holy Ghost he's going to overshadow you it ain't your doing it's his doing all I need is a vessel to express myself through somebody help me here she is not you oh if I could just make the heaven oh sure it's not you it's God that makes you make it to heaven he just need a vessel of some time to express himself through that's all he asking he's asking you for your body he's asking you for your heart and all you need to do is give God your heart and he will do the rest hallelujah Mary said be it unto me according to your word and then she began to rejoice without any signs of her being pregnant without any signs of a baby being inside but she knew it meant by God's grace that her experience was real and in that experience nothing could take away from her and saying you can't be you can't be pregnant you never knew a man that was the natural order of things but God when God wants to get something done he doesn't work with the natural he was with the supernatural well because he's supernatural we're looking at ourselves and we're looking at our fault we're looking at our failures and we're saying how is it going to be done just like Mary said it it ain't your doing just let the Holy Ghost over shouting you let God in and he will do the work for you but we need a genuine faith how can you believe in a resurrection when you can't have faith for God to heal you you know what we do we limit ourselves because Satan brings faults and failures and it makes us judge ourselves son righteously you don't deserve it he's right you don't deserve but by God's grace God said we become we can go boldly before the throne of God hallelujah not by your works by God's grace then if God has allowed me to come boldly before the throne that means I have a petition that I can set before him and God will answer according to his divine and perfect will hallelujah but he need genuine faith he needs a faith that no matter what it looks like hallelujah God said so and that's exactly what it is pressing toward perfection is that right brother Brennan said a real Christian him impresses to war perfection he doesn't saddle for just knowing his ABCs he's a Christian that wants to know about algebra he's a Christian that not want to know how it works so he can put it in to motion you understand me if God wanted this to occupy a statue he would have made him one but God wouldn't his statue to live like Moses when the man struck Moses on the knee and said speak Micah Angelo yeah what he wanted he wanted a livid image and that's what God is looking for he's looking for a living image someone to express a Living Word a Living God you can scream Jesus Christ is the same yesterday over and over and over again but if you don't believe it he will not be able to express himself because God only works by faith is that right Christians hallelujah he and I must understand we are pressed to our perfection until the world is dead and you become a new creature in Christ in otherwise we don't settle for sin we don't settle and allow sin to control us hello somebody when you find fault in you what do you do as a real Christian you go before God because you want to be delivered you want to conquer this thing y'all hear what I'm saying this is a different message but I'm gonna tell you something only perfection goes there and you and I must find out what kind of perfection I'm working with hallelujah innate human perfection is cause perfection and that perfection must dwell in us and live in us you say what are you saying people buy one spirit we are baptized into one body is that right God it doesn't matter whether you Jew or Gentile will you be bother free or have been all we have all been made to drink into one spirit but this is what gets me all of us know that we have heard about the Holy Ghost but you know what we must go beyond the veil about traditional beliefs hallelujah show us a man got to put pillock also believe some of us got a Baptist believe nothing is captain wherever you come from but that there must be ripped you've got to get rid of all of what you thought you knew in order to receive this you understand me brother Branham didn't bring us left all of us he brought us real mana and don't you know why have you ever thought about why the bread beyond the veil didn't go bad what made it last forever it was the Shekinah it was the Shekinah glory they kept the bread fresh and if you and I could get back there we'll never have to worry about being stale Christians we'll never have to worry of men about having jar because that glory would keep you fresh when the vision is made plain when that vision is made clear the Bible said you need to run he didn't say walk he said run because a vision is set for an appointed time hallelujah what vision brother Brooks the vision that God gave unto us because we lost sight of the kind of man you know kind of people was supposed to be we all thought oh I'm a Baptist I'm a Methodist I'm a Pentecost whatever that is but all of that had to be ripped apart why because it never produced the perfect image of Christ it never happened it never will we need a word that can transform us into the very image unlike miss of Jesus Christ and God has given us the manner that will do so that write the word for this age is what we need hmm somebody help me here you see that's why the message that we have is not a Pentecostal yes the message in a sense and then it's toward the gifts I wonder where are they are where are they if they have been restored where are they honey something has taken place and something has tired but it's trying to away from Christ instead of into Christ five identifications of the church you've got to have all those gifts and if you don't have them if we don't have them amen the Prophet God said God would liken us as a prostitute and yet we have mean a men who have cloaked us again placed us into a system and I don't care if your spiritual your press toward the mark you wrap that veil or away from you it's not about who says who is what God says hallelujah we find out just like I said last week we find out that people amen they come to a place and that's why we should never have mean greater than others oh I got a great preacher here and I got a great preacher there not ice cream this preaching ice cream that preacher and what you're doing is evil be evil brother yes when God gives you a pastor and you run to somebody else's screaming you are spiritually committing adultery especially especially when you begin to compare his preaching with your pastors preaching who I could get deep with this but I got children here that's why I so much confusion that's why people can't live it because they got so many voices they don't know which one to listen to hello somebody but you better believe God sent you one prophet one voice came through that not two three or four one voice and every preacher supposed to resound what he said only one husband and that is the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah you see this calling supposed to be higher we've got to be great we've got to be more than just church members I'm so Tyler just church members people come in here and all they are church members ain't got no fire not everybody but it's a sad thing that we become church members we set up in here and you said what brothers what are you trying to say I'm saying there's a veil something's got you blind you think you see but something has you blind because when you see Jesus no matter what you go through all is well somebody help me here is that right that Sheriff releases woman says are when Elijah a substance are you okay she's as all as well all is well supposed to be the response of the bride no matter what I go through all is well ba because I know the promises hallelujah that lady says hey I didn't ask he lied you forgotten I told him to go ahead on I'm okay but he'll I just said I was going to produce a son now you caused this traumatic thing to come upon me what am I supposed to do well thing I know if God could give me a son when I was a barren woman he can raise that boy back up y'all hear me that's what I'm trying to tell you when Satan comes me like a fraud you become the standard the God and you live supper standing against him no matter how bad the report is it can't get no worse then report that Lazarus was dead and rotted for days it looked impossible but not to the bride she had the genuine faith she has a faith that can create hallelujah she has a faith by Joshua spoken word with Chaney atmosphere I'm not a church member I refuse to be just a church member I am the word of God made manifest you said brothers you don't look like anything all over yet at the end of the day I be just like him I walk like him I talk like him I live like him everything about me will be like him hallelujah I will not give up I will not st. and will not allow the devil to kick me around not when I not when I know what I possess hallelujah and who possess me hallelujah is that Alright I told you this dream mama tell it to you now I had a dream if I haven't told you all my telling it now and I dreamed my brother branham and in this dream I didn't understand that's why I can tell you to dreamed I didn't understand it until just a few days ago when I was in Lima discussing the same thing but in this dream brother Brandon was preaching he was standing there and our so long those groups that group of people a big room and all of a sudden something happened in the back and I turned in about two thirds of the people left and went out and how I was about curiosity forgive me but this is the dream in my curiosity I went to see where they went see let me tell you something everybody that left there are some that will return there are some that I don't care what some people thinking because some people out of curiosity went to see because that in my dream I went to see and when I went to look I saw my sister driving a convertible now my sister has going on but the resurrection was on and she was smiling and she had this great big glow on her face and for some reason she said nothing but I knew that I had to follow her and what happened when I I followed her she took me right back to where brother Brandon was preaching yeah I mean the resurrection will make him turn oh come on somebody you don't know it's a dream I'm telling it as a dream I believe what I saw and when I got back in brother Branham looked and I didn't understand it but he looked at me like he was a little um agitated because I left but it he was glad that I returned and all of a sudden he then this is what confused me and I was afraid to tell the dream he said there will be a tent meeting there will be attending I never fully understood it and all of a sudden and let me tell you something he said it emphatically with authority and all of a sudden he said something and then we left flank like that now everyone left was in white robes and we began to march west with me oh Jesus it was dead I understood our this trail again he's riding your trail is not with the man he's riding the trail again is with his bride she's the one that's in he taught authority because she would have reached hallelujah perfection at that time and that's where we are right now look how many is left hallelujah and at the same time I saw my sister we're going with before the Lord amen resurrected smiling we said why what do you mean cuz she was in a converter bought and that convertible was to show that the grave was open what I'm trying to say is closer than what you think this whole thing that's happening now it's what what's happening because now you said I tell the people as it's a rebuke to the believer that God has to raise up somebody to tell you that go go back and listen to your tanks you should have never stopped here's a rebuke that you got to have somebody raised opposites you need to play your dates I never stopped since I came to this message I never stopped playing my tapes and reading all come on somebody it's a rebuke when God said lay in the presence of the Sun what you laying in the presence of how you going to be ripened how are you going to ever know Amen what God is requiring of you how would you know if the preacher preached something that's not in the message how would you know you supposed to study to show yourself approved not only just the tape for the Bible itself I don't mean to be fussing I mean I'm saying this out of love I'm concerned because we have become so religious we think our religions gonna save you rip that mail up rip that veil up it ain't your religion it'll never be your religion you say all will praise God I follow prophet listen millions follow Moses hallelujah is that right and you got to understand Moses position Moses because of the pillar fire out of the bush into Moses became God unto Egypt with Moses was giving you ten commandments that was God not a man but when Moses got angry and smoke the rock that was a land in that God y'all better understand it because if you don't understand the position of the Prophet you'll never understand the position of his children that same God that was in him must be in you hallelujah you have a different office some of us have good great faith and some of us have small say but it's not because you chose to be so God did that everybody's measure of faith is different somebody help me here and whatever that measure say God gave you it's enough to do what God has ordained you to do people say God ain't ain't no God hasn't changed we're the one that's changed we've got so much stuff so we don't even know to have faith in God hallelujah you understand me it's not enough to say well we're written epistles rid of all men if you're not expressing the word for your day then you need to drive draw closer to God hello maybe this is not a shouting hallelujah message but I'm trying to tell you something this morning you and I must understand that only the word expressed for this hour will make a rapture hallelujah Jesus is in me and they nothing happening in the house wherever Jesus lives here wherever he's at there's always action hallelujah you put a dad stick behind the curtain in the shekinah and it comes to life not by the will of the stick but buying the will of the god of the stick that's how it is you lay with in the presence of God you don't have to worry about changing yourself it will change you you got to understand that everything that was spoken of Jesus Christ concerning in the Book of Luke everything in Matthew everything in Mark everything everything of Christ was fulfilled you know he said listen if you don't believe that I am the Messiah if you don't believe that I him he he said believe me for my works sake if you don't believe the word if I'm not the expression of what eyes and all the other prophets Jeremiah and all of them prophesied about if I am NOT the Living expression of that you don't have to believe it because my works declare Who I am hello bride of Jesus Christ your works are supposed to declare who you are you don't have to wear a sign on your back hello somebody and to the sisters you understand wearing long dresses and everything else all of that is good but that does not declare who you are Muslim over dress they can outshine you in that so it can't be that what is God looking for all he's looking for a changed heart whoa somebody help me here because I want you to know Daniel Kerry thought he was okay but then he Kerr didn't go far enough even though he was a preacher he was an evangelist he won people's souls he won souls to Christ but he himself had not yet gone there by God want to do for you though redness about the message if you then comes over yourself somebody helped me here you got to die to your own flesh is that right Paul said I must be careful lest I myself become a castaway I'm not here to preach about you know all of these deep things when I realize hey man we've got people in here that still needs to be born again we've got people in here a men who have perhaps a man coming you know the the life of God is in you but you're not pressing toward perfection oh I'm saying I've been baptized in Jesus name and now you know I know God sent a prophet but what your life what is your life reflecting what are you reflecting hallelujah some of us got so many lights is psychedelic there's only one light and that's the light of God hallelujah the light of God is life it will change you and take that anger out of you it'll take that evil spirit amen that that that makes you so frustrated so easily some of us have we saved and we Justin Lena snakes I'm not preaching he is and he knows you better than I do hallelujah come on somebody you and I must understand amen it is the Word of God that discern the thoughts and intents of the heart we are here for God to operate on us wash me clean if you find a thing in me take it out o Lord God help us here we won't God to sanctify us and purify us we don't want to be anybody in here live to be a hypocrite I don't think so nobody wants to be a hypocrite genuine Christians genuine faith did that right let me tell you something about genuine faith when God tells you something and it may be contrary to the doctors reports genuine faith says no I believe God is that right it's the truth when the doctor says oh you got cancer and you're gonna die you got this to end my wife God prayed apart but when God ain't good it in me I was talking to her brother the other day I said when God drops faith in you there's no questions there is no doubt and there is no room for questions or doubt you can't even explain why you believe it but you know you do and it happens because it's no longer you think it's his faith the just shall live by what his faith that's why Rebecca that scripture was so important because we kept saying to just shall live by faith but there in her doctor says the just shall live by his faith with the vision is made plain ha because the son of man God Himself comes and he delivers his faith to his church hallelujah the Prophet God said it like this all that was in God he ported it to Christ all that was in Christ he poured into his church he said it wasn't like God throwing up something no son it was God in feeling it was that God kenosis and then took himself and put himself in you when God put himself in you there is no excuse when God puts himself in you faith his faith operation not yours help us is that all right a born-again Christian is tied to Christ and the Bible people say I love God I did not ask you one question when the last time you picked this up and read it that could be you Christ and you won't even read his Bible it's this his love letter to you this is how he feeds us you understand me brother Bailey was sitting like this he said he said the message would turn your hearts back to the fathers and you where do you find them here you understand me in some other your heart hasn't been turned that's what I'm trying to tell you I'm trying to tell you you've got a rent that veil of religion that's what we're now fall into how you know because so many people think because I'm in the message I can live in a kind of way I want to I can do this understand and grace become disgrace and the devil has deceived you you can't keep your attitude and go to heaven there's only one thing that makes it into the gate and that's perfection and what kind of perfection you're talking about I'm talking about the full statue of Christ it was the divine nature of God that opened the gate even in the first resurrection when the Old Testament Saints got up even the Angels asked who is this King of glory who is he you and I must understand amen he meant that same king of glory is no longer in a bush he's no longer denominations where is he he's in his bride he's in the heart of every man and woman that will receive him is that right that's what he said I stand at the door knock If any man open up to me I will come in to him and I would I will have sup with him our stop with him that means you suffers while eating you can eat Amen unless you doing something your Bible plays a part oh come on somebody see that's the point like what one day when I was in my kitchen I don't told y'all this God told me that you are this and boy I didn't understand it at first but old bored that I rejoice you see what I'm saying now let me say it like this because I'm veiled you can't see what I see and because you fail I can't see what you see but if anybody knows that God is in the house the man who holds the house knows he's in there somehow to help me here to you and me like me look like God in the house but I know God is in the house somebody help me here so that you understand if God is in the house I am suffering with him you say what do you mean brothers let me tell you something I did not sit down and say okay let me just decide on what I'm gonna preach this morning every message I've ever preached has been ordained by God I don't care how simple it may seem to you I know where I get my messages from I don't get my messages by looking at somebody else on YouTube I get my messages from God himself that's why I know who's preaching every morning whether you see it or not I know who's preaching the Bible says my sheep will hear my voice and I know them and then they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand wait a minute he said I give them you didn't have to work for it he said I give them y'all know what giving is I give them eternal life and they never Perry they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand Oh God I just hope I'm naked what are you talking about that's the devil talking it ain't no hope in making it you better be glad it's not by works because all of us fail every day if it's not omission it's commissioned somewhere in the line we must ask for grace him forgiveness every day now I don't know about you but I do now let me go hold on is it listen you'll never pass how many y'all know how many I really believe y'all say you know how many you believe that the grace of God has come to you do you really listen you well let me tell you some gosh still got doubting Thomases some people still got a feel touch yeah but they still a part of the part of the group hallelujah don't worry these hot temples you got you won't make it to heaven with it because God don't take it from you and the thing about it ain't gonna always be pleasant God like for you to give it up he said my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand hallelujah here I come to where we're going the vision is made plain Jesus says I and my father are one and in st. John 17 he prays father I would that they be one even as we are one I love these scriptures because that's what I see in order for us to make heaven we must become one not with the church not with higher ground but with Jesus Christ hmm we've got all these examples before us and I'm almost done with this portion of it we've got all these examples before us but people of God living Morrow doesn't save you being able to even lay hands on the sick and they recover that that's not salvation those things are part of salvation but you know the thing is Jesus had depart from me you did all these things but I never knew you I've never had an intimate relationship with you hallelujah you know what I never union with you God wants our union hallelujah ooh is this okay Jesus remember when Jesus said I my father one day wanted to stone him and that's what happens to us well when I get to that scripture I my father's wondering like something just blocked the minds of the people you know you could never become one with God that devil is a liar you must press toward that remember I told you let me put it this way the image in which Paul saw he said I press toward the mom it was the image of Jesus Christ it was his character it was his behavior it was he said listen he said it's a high calling yes I know it is he said but I'm pressing toward that I'm moving toward that hallelujah I love it the way Paul said it he says listen at the end of my journeys that I have fought a good fight in otherwise I thought all the way hallelujah every turn I made I had the fight but I had an image in my mind I had a goal in my mind and that was to be just like him hallelujah that's my goal to be just like him hey I'm not weighing and weighting on what other people are doing everybody are you looking around the world and everybody's just seem to be messing up and doing all kind of stuff and you said Oh God I listen that has nothing to do with me when I was born naturally you weren't there and when I was born spiritually you weren't there you understand me a man it's been me alone all the time and so is it with you hallelujah you said you think you think by God's grace because you religious man we can't even come close to the Pharisees of Jesus's day and it was so so amazing because they did all an update they performed as Christians and Jesus said but see I see you dead men's bones hallelujah you love the Lord I can't make it easy I can't this is a harder way this is a way that you and I have to really think is as what what are we gonna do with this are we gonna really press on when everybody else is slacking up everybody is distracted and then you allow that to affect you because everybody else is fainting they're mean I'm feeling faint I got to keep moving so to you God must become first in your life that's the first commandment love the Lord thy God with all that heart mind and soul it still holds he must become first he will never take second place no the pillar of fire was it Moses I'm gonna say give me a five just till he's finished I said five the other night the brothers they made it I said give me ten nothing was it then once to say take 20 I said I'll take the 20 so you're not must understand that we're at a place y'all knows the truth when we're sitting at a restaurant we never think about time we think about getting back up and going again so you know when it comes to the Word of God this eating is far more important is that right Mary Martha Martha do you know and she said but she taking a better part she sat still relieved the house the way it's supposed to be I don't care if it's this that in the other when God says it's time to feed it's time to feed because when God called dinnertime you don't show up he keeps moving when God calls for you to pray you stop and pray when he says read read if you don't you'll find that anointing has gone and when you get to reading you can't find him nowhere so you have to stop you don't say okay wait a minute long you don't wait a minute long with him he's gone y'all understand me the veil has to be written I'm closing on this thought Jesus Christ was the invisible or the image of God the invisible image of God the visible excuse me right in other words he was housing God right and the Bible says know ye not you are the temple of God why can you be the temple of God in God in the temple God must be in the temple he's no longer just a baby in a manger that's why this age can not you can't make it heaven with being a baby when I'm in a rapture you come to a pool full of a Jewish state because that was the image that God made out of in he was a matured man he was a full-grown man like I said in the other message is there no babies in heaven so therefore you won't get there as a baby you've got to go to heaven at supper too but your image that is the creation of God in you and Jesus Christ I ain't creating babies he's creating full matured women and men got to go back to the beginning you start off as a baby but he that begun the good work is faithful to complete it it has to be a completion in you you understand what I'm saying you and I must understand by God's grace we must Express him that means we must reveal that he's living in us it's a is a revealing of Christ in you it's not say oh I'm a Christian no it's a revealing it's an expression something being seen when so much of what I know that person is a Christian well they know you were Christian by the expression right I had somebody tell me that some years ago says this man who was a pastor say he he got so anger he started cursing I said a real Christian don't do that you got the Holy Ghost in you you do not profane oh man I hit more than that it's true if you can cost with this time the only reason why Peter was able to do it because he had not yet going to Pentecost but when the Holy Ghost is in you and you can cuss like a sailor you don't have it God will not allow that filth you can't have a sweet and bitter fountain at the same time like I said God through our ages how dealt with good and evil the tree of good and evil but when Jesus came he says it's over you either make the tree good or you make the tree evil there's nothing such thing as a good and evil Christian oh Jesus I'm talking about something now we do not want to end up like i'ma stop here we do not want to end up like Daniel curry mmm I don't want to go up to the gate and can't get in and it doesn't tell us how long Daniel curry traveled but he traveled but the better get got ready to say something and he stopped but he went through time-space and all that and now he's at the white throne no way do I want to go there and you and I got to make up our minds this time is running out on us Justin the other day I forgot was it New Zealand or Australia they just had a volcano erupted several people were injured and think of course I know her one person died it was silent which was unusual and when it erupted it caught them off God and all I could think about is that pressure building up everybody is thinking well when it went when California rumbling a little bit no sir I believe it will break silence it'll catch them when they least expect it and just like that that volcano erupted can you imagine you're on a mountain and all of a sudden it shakes and erupts and you don't have no place to run and that's the way it is you think God had oh I'll see it in or weather report on Sodom well tomorrow is going to rain brimstone and fire oh it caught them partying it caught them doing their everyday deeds no warning no funny feeling the word had already gone out God don't know not on us nothing all he's gonna say is why didn't you hear why didn't you obey what made you love yourself more than you love me fellow people I'm saying these things not to be mean I'm saying these thing because it's late in the evening you know the Lord showed me yesterday was it yesterday other day I had a little selfishness about something I had a little selfishness and you know and I thought Oh Lord deliver me from this selfish spirit break and destroy this veil in my life y'all hear what I'm saying whenever you put yourself before God it's selfishness it ain't got to be with other foolish you whenever you know that God say don't do it and you go do it that's you selfish you're there to please yourself and not God hello let's tan a city of perfection how are we going to get there I'll try to get more into that that's coming this evening a city of perfection it almost seems impossible it is impossible for a man to do when God says in his word no man can add one cubit to his stature I think about it and let me tell you something know when you going through hard trials and temptations God don't expect you to put on a fake smile because I don't think Jesus had one when he was growing up Calvary I don't think he was smiling in everybody no he was feeling the pain when you feel the pain is not it's not easy to smile but let me tell you something there's a there should be something in the inside of your heart that's peace a peace supposed to be there that that is supposed to surpass all understanding a peace of God that should never go sad no matter what what you're going through there's something that's supposed to be there that that should always be stable when everything else has seen be unstable this part of you supposed to be stable like job though he slay me I'm gonna trust him so you know because a lot of time we think God because he doesn't move when we want him to move and we don't even see that the moment you give give God your requests to prayer he hears it he answers he said Daniel I heard you the first time you prayed it took me 21 days but I heard I was on my way did I not fix it Mary and Martha they cried out to God and and you know they thought God didn't hear him because the Prophet didn't show up when he went when they thought he was supposed to show up and he didn't he didn't you know do the Superman thing that he wanted him to do but you see in the mix of this equation God has something for them to do and he says roll away the stone see sometimes God don't answer you in the way that you wanted me to because somewhere your faith needs to be lifted up and he gave Mary and Martha a task roll away the stone I mean a huge stone he didn't say gather help he told two women go roll away the stone and to this day I'm gonna act when I see their mama says how did that happen somewhere your faith struck let me tell you something this toll could be heavy it could be be beyond you know yo yo yo yo your abilities how I'm gonna roll away the stone but at your word I'm gonna roll this stone it's gonna move out of my way I don't care if it's blocking everything because I know that once I remove the stone of unbelief I'm gonna be whole a miracle a dead man that has been dead for days rotted is going to come back to life you see that's what I'm trying to tell you God is able to restore your life he doesn't do patch-up job part way jobs when God does something he's a perfectionist and he perfects it genuine faith will say I don't care what the doctors say I don't care what the psych psychiatrist say I don't care what anybody says God's Word is right and that's where I'm going with it when I talk about heaven I'm talking about a place a man that I am I am I in this dimension I don't remember but something on the inside of me make me know it's there you know I'm like I'm like Christopher Columbus I ain't never been to America but I'm headed well how you know something tells me that landed somewhere and I'm gonna keep going no matter what the storms may bring before I won't sink I can't sing cuz I'm caught up under inspiration and that's I wanted to touch on that this morning but that's alright when God inspires you to do something do it don't worry about it don't try to break it down don't try to process it just it and when you do it God will bring it to pass if there be anyone that is our prayer maybe all of us maybe pray I know we all need I'll tell you what God is able I've seen God do a mighty mighty that many things we preach down there it's just a Karen's mom funeral mm-hmm if you thought this morning was rough you should have heard me down there I didn't even know things could come out my mouth like that but he was in control God own women preachers and didn't know I had all those preachers up in there you know what happened some of those women repented they've met me at the service they ask questions and they received the word tell me who could have done that nobody but Jesus the kind of spirit that God brought in their even the pastor said brother books I've been there services he said but that's the first time I was seeing God jump and went higher the way he did because it wasn't me with myself I would not have known to say some of the things I said and and I said that didn't record it but God was perfect what I'm trying to say if God can can can make a woman preach up repent and here we are the bride and we're so he can tell me if God is in you that you can't see your your erring ways the Holy Spirit grieves when things ain't right and every one of us that has the Holy Spirit we can tell when God is not pleased I just say by God's grace examine yourself see whether you be in the faith you know I appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ I appreciate our sister father we come before you Lord Jesus my sister is dealing with the facial rash Lord I don't know but you know all things you know creative all things and by your spoken word by the word in which you have probably given unto us Lord I bind this spirit and I call it out in the name of Jesus Christ Satan the blood of Jesus Christ is against you I speak healing and restoration to the face and body of my sister in Jesus Christ's name we pray father we are God we come before your Lord we thank your father

her the Lord even when when we can't be there bless her now strengthen her Lord and then steal that love give it to a Lord that it makes press itself you through her in all opposition in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen say brother books how do you know the things we struggling we were struggling with because I struggle anybody in here I fight every day sometimes all day sometimes my battles some days are worse than the days before but I'm determined to make heaven my home I don't want to be left behind and I know it's a secret catch no way have y'all heard that there's a message called a secret catching away that means everybody ain't gonna know when it happens and I don't want to be one that wake up and find out that he's gone you understand me I said like this because Paul says I gotta be for less I become a castaway here was a prophet said I gotta be careful and that's all God is saying be careful don't take this gospel for granted don't take it for granted if you ain't living it it's okay we all were all growing we're all maturing we fall we falter we get up that's that's the beauty that the grace of God is with us to bring us to a perfection y'all believe that Lord Jesus we pray for our system names in Lord then God you know her desire Lord God I believe this sister Lord Jesus is a real Christian Lord Lord I've seen what you've done in her life father
