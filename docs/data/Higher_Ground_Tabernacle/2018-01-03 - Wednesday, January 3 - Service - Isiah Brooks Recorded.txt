John the sixteenth chapter we're still working with one bread but we're like to entitle this portion we are in him see you god is good to us we had a wonderful time on New Year's how many of y'all heard the angel sing yeah yeah God was mighty I was mighty I'm like what praise the Lord it was a real blessing God meant us in a special way even while I was singing I'm like it was just too perfect it was and I heard just like we heard that hallelujah song and and I would I didn't say nothin until I got home and I would stop mentioning and I thought it's just she kinda was gonna lose it in the kitchen she said what I said I did I said well anyway it was wonderful and they're not brother Isaac heard and different ones you had there anyway God was in the place say John 16 beginning at the 25th verse these things have I spoken unto you in Proverbs but the time cometh when I shall no more speak unto you in Proverbs but I shall show you plainly the father and that day ye shall ask in my name and I say not unto you that I would pray the Father for you for the father himself love with you because you have loved me and have believed it that I came out from God I came forth from the father and them come into the world again I leave the world and I go to the Father his disciples said unto Him lo now speaketh thou plainly and speaketh know proverbs now are we sure that they'll knoweth all things and needed not that any man should ask thee by this we believe that thou came and forth from God jesus answered them do you now believe behold the hour cometh yea is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet I am NOT alone because the father is with me these things have I spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world what a blessing what a blessing I love it because because be of good cheer because I have overcome the world amen first Corinthians 12 we're gonna read the 13th verse there first Corinthians 12 and 13 God is rich mercy by one spirit are we baptized into one body whether we be Jew or Gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been me and have been all made to drink into one spirit I just love the way he says drink into one spirit let us pray father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for your goodness hallelujah father you've been gracious to us we thank your father for your mercy Lord and all that you have done for us lord I thank you for how you cleanses us every day every hour of the day we think it for your precious blood Jesus and have been shared for us and we thank you for our hiding place and that is under the shed blood of your dear son Jesus thank you Lord for being so good to us lestor service now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated we were talking about the one bread and being of one body last time i ministered I talked about talked about how Jesus identified as a mature as a harvest who was of God and who wasn't and basically he talked about those who could hear his voice he was telling those who say that they were of Abraham's seed and Abraham was their father that if you were Abraham's seed then you do the works of a preparer because Abraham is my seed and not only that if you would if you knew Abraham then you would do the works and then you would hear my boy because Abraham saw my day and rejoiced in it and before he bruh ham was I am I shared by God's grace how one loaf God always took one loaf even when he was doing communion it was one loaf whatever it was it was one because that oneness that one had to represent him right one all right one father law one Holy Ghost one son of God and these three are one in three different manifestations but there is only one Holy Spirit that Holy Spirit made Jesus holy now Holy Spirit will make you holy right but we realized amen when Jesus said also that man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God here he's telling his disciples in this particular verse st. John 16 that he proceedeth out of the mouth of God and what was he the word he is the Alpha and the Omega and therefore you and I must if we gonna eat any bread it must be his bread I share with you just the other night amen the only way that you can have eternal life is you gotta feed upon God right that's what he did amen you said what do you mean by that the angel told John you must eat the whole book you must eat the Alpha and the Omega right because Jesus Christ said that man does not live by bread alone and he was working with the natural bread but then he says I am that bread that came down from God down from heaven and here he's basically saying I am is that right the Bible said in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God well you know it is God so you and I must understand if God is going to give you eternal life and you were in that eternal life there's only one eternal life so how you gonna get eternal life if you don't feed upon eternal life and eternal life is the word of God hallelujah so man does not live by that bread but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God who is Jesus Christ he is the voice of God he is the god he is the spoken word he is and in order to live we must feed as a prophet of God said on the bloody bleeding were flesh of God is that ok so we realize Amen that our overcoming is only because we are part of the brain I was showing you about communion communion is basically fellowship II right and listen that's why Jesus when he broke the bread he gave you a piece you piece you piece if there were twelve disciples that meant there were twelve pieces of bread nothing was left over because he told a said in one a place he said eat it all up drink it all up right and that drinking is the blood that drinking is the spirit let it saturate you right that bread is given to you because listen bread in the Old Testament it was the vital source of life bread means meant life right it was the source of life so Jesus was saying that the source of life I'm speaking up because remember that well the Jesus understood that the woman thirst he said but I can give you water that you'll never thirst again so he took him from the natural and brought it into the spiritual and even when he speaks he says listen man does not live by bread alone right because Jesus had daughters this is natural bread I can turn it into the stone into bread but it won't give me what I'm looking for it's not he turned a life he said well what do you mean remember it was the word broken in the book of Genesis that took away eternal life or living forever it wasn't natural things that broke it it was a spiritual disobedience which was God's word that they rejected and that was the real source of life hallelujah so when you now understand that's why the Bible says we must not add or take away because remember adding or taken away is allowing give him space for what we call leaven in a loving is anything that will puff it up that's why Amen when you and I come to the communion table when we get ready to take communion we're dealing with in the unleavened bread that's why you and I cannot allow sin to be in our life when we take communion because if there is sin in your life and remember I told you the other day Amen that this what makes it unleavened you 11 is when you identify yourself with the unleavened bread you understand me and therefore you must examine yourself to see whether there be any leavening in your life he kind of unconfessed sin in a kind of attitude any kind of thing that will not make God pure or you pure it must be taken out of you and that's the only way it can come out is by way of confession so now you break yourself to this place and you're saying when you come to communion right he overcame I overcame he is the bread I am the bread right is that right brother Branham said it like this the Holy Ghost came to you you know me he said God rotated a piece of himself off of himself one life but he broke it right there was one pillar fire on the day of Pentecost was 120 hallelujah here what was God doing breaking the spiritual bread breaking the spiritual life and therefore giving to each individual hallelujah and God can break himself up in whatever pieces he want to I'll tell you what when John saw his body the Bible said there was a number that no man could number and it still was God one one Holy Spirit one people what fellowship hallelujah in one holy place yeah so even in the breaking of bread he said one of these things you're gonna understand what I'm doing here right he said I'm washing your feet but one of these old days you're gonna understand you sir Peter said I won't wash your feet he said well then you would have no part of it right because in this portion of the bread who is the Lord will humble himself and wash his brother's feet that means forgive him and love him and whatever it takes hallelujah if you can't do that that's it that shows you're not a part of this bread ooh one body one bread and one baptism right and we're born that's oh I love it because you and I cannot receive the Holy Ghost in your soul except you came from God hallelujah because each and every one of us have been predestined leyde you know what that means God has already determined you in he knows he was going to choose him and he was going to choose you he knows a man that this what God is doing it's so powerful and yeah like I said it's so simple really my brother Adam said it's just simple now you can show me anywhere in brother branham's life he chased god no no no no even at his birth God showed up when he was a sinner and care no like he was yes what God showed up hallelujah and I guarantee you you can change your life the same way what are you thinking about God and God showed up ha because when you are predestinated it meant to be bride God will intervene in your life when it's time to turn you and to change you God will turn you and change you right because remember I said unto you just the other night Amen that listen is that context our puzzle you know how yes I mean the big piece big puzzles you don't mind doing the smaller the pieces get the more difficult it becomes right but all of those pieces of that puzzle is necessary to make the picture complete hallelujah and you got to understand there's a beautiful picture on that you might have looked up and say oh I wish I was part of that son piece no but God has colored you a piece of the trunk of a tree hallelujah wherever he cut right brother you are in the picture and I think this is what we fail to see we cannot excommunicate anybody that's part of the picture because if we do that then therefore oh this is wonderful hallelujah understand there are portions of this beautiful picture that has been designed just to be the framework holding everything together hallelujah and there are those postures in this picture I mean there might be more exciting hallelujah but nevertheless each picture each piece of the puzzle is needed and there's nothing like trying to complete a puzzle and the main piece you looking for you can't fire you can't frame a piece you can't frame a puzzle that's not completed that you can but it would always look awkward hallelujah and so you saw old brother roots i'ma tell you something brother Branham gave us a clearer picture of the body of Christ we have divided our lujah and you know the Prophet God said except he said when you say except you believe that not the way I believe he said ooh that's wrong uh-uh come on you're not gonna make it I don't see that in the message except you believe the way I believe Oh No then I know you off-track hallelujah Elijah said Lord there's only me I'm only one here God said not so I have 7,000 that have not been found themselves to debayle hallelujah and because that 7,000 wasn't among Elijah didn't mean that God didn't have him there God is the one who judges the heart and God knows every predestinate is so you have me so I'm gonna ease your conscience God will never give you a thirst for the Holy Ghost or perfection imperfection and the Holy Ghost was not yours because only God can make you thirst and the Bible said whosoever thirst after righteousness they shall be filled hallelujah he didn't say when he said they shall be filled that's the word hallelujah listen but through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father you know we're not like I said the other night when I heard brother Branham say Jesus didn't leave you an inheritance I'm that what he said no he said the father gave you the inheritance hallelujah you listen we might call on the name of Jesus but do you know who comes it's the Holy Ghost and who is the Holy Ghost the father that's why jesus said if you have me the son you have a father and a son [Applause] so you understand by God's grace that God is unveiling himself and we're seeing who Jesus Christ he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily that's what I was trying to tell us he was just a hole he was just a shell hallelujah to manifest the fullness of God but he was the being that God wanted us to see because he said listen if you can see Who I am then you'll come to know who you are oh come on solo you can't have eternal life unless you was with God in the beginning he's eternal life and though we we may not remember all of these things we were with him we were in his bed we were attributes we were part of him when he just existed God didn't say well I would think of these things they were there all these attributes and God saw each and every one of us in our perfection and he will not stop working on the house until you and I are completed oh you may run out of patience and say Lord I don't know why you deal with me gossip but I know hallelujah I can tell you exactly where you were in my mind when I thought of you hallelujah oh my I really got excited today uh-uh uh-uh I won't call him a friend but an associate said when he was early this morning he saw the Sun Rise and he said in the sky it looked like three separate suns rising my daughter saw a supernatural thing this morning I saw it happening but I didn't think no more but I thought wow that's powerful it look like fire was coming up from the earth but I didn't think no more but I went on about my business I said well Lord you know but when he showed three sergeant and this man I started smelling I got happy on the inside I said yes Lord I believe it's your time hallelujah and they said well is because of the water vapors and the crystal things and hey I don't care what is from God did it he paints it the way he won't the payment hallelujah my son a rainbow on the side and a rainbow on that side and then in the Sun was a big kind of fire type and yet in it was a dark spot right and all of a sudden the Sun broke through it sound like a resurrection to me hallelujah a covenant of the Old Testament our Covenant to the New Testament and then here come the Sun through the darkness hallelujah it's real my soul even though I didn't see it hallelujah now therefore ye are no more strangers foreigners but fellow-citizens with the Saints and oh I love that the household of God that's it right the whole house of God hallelujah and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone oh don't you see what I'm saying because in this age we are the only ones that have been able to receive that the capping of the pyramid the very cheap cornerstone hallelujah the very finished work of God comes down into us no like a rocket we take up and that's how that fire looked this morning when we saw it would go like this right brother I didn't know what it was I really didn't know or if I had known how to weigh that you see I knew it was the Sun but I didn't understand what was causing that anyway let's go on so the moon as beautiful as it was oh my god and I built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple of the Lord well growing we all are growing in whom he also a built I like this together now separated built together for habitation of God through the spirit huh so what's happening now I've got a little note here since judging our hearts a judge our hearts see but them says I am a Pentecostal Nazarene Baptist so that's the way we are we're just represent the Lord Jesus Christ in His mercy that's right for by one spirit are we baptized into the body becomes one people right that's what Jesus was saying and remember now this is one of the reasons why Judas could not go to Pentecost because he wasn't part of the body and just when God was gonna do some great God dismiss him and say go do what you got to do what did God do he got rid of the leavening a little people don't understand what God is doing he's getting rid of the Lebanon oh don't tell see he told those seventy he owes his disciples except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you shall have no part of no life in you what happened they left he was deliberately getting rid of the Lebanon y'all hear what I'm saying and that's the way it is right now hallelujah God is deliberately getting rid of the Lebanon ah because you see what's happening with the bride of Jesus Christ she's going to eat every bit of it she won't all the world hallelujah for example can I use it like this if somebody say well hey you you want your husband with both of his rounds of wine y'all understand me that's no charge to me I want my husband about you know another woman I want my wife I wanted to do this see I don't want pie I don't want to Jesus with one foot one eye or whatever the case may be I want it for statue Alleluia in me right and that's why Jesus said listen if your arm your I would ever fin you cut it off your leash you enter into the kingdom maybe maybe but you at the end of the bed while she walked through that door you fool you complete but at least you get in there what was he saying if there be 11 whether it be your are you up you don't mean you go and plug your eye on he's speaking spiritually here right the seriousness of this body part is that you can see that how detrimental these things can be to you if right you got to make a decision that means if I got to go in name I'd rather go in Lane than to be whole and left behind and that makes sense I think if I say this because I don't listen I want everybody to know listen you didn't come here tonight and then for some entertainment you came because there's a part of you that's keep pulling is the part of you that love God's word hallelujah and let me tell you like this I love it because I couldn't get rid of him if I wanted to yeah he what I'm saying I can't get rid of him but he can get rid of me but he can't get rid of me why no more than Abraham could get rid of Sarah no more than Adam could get rid of me this is what this is the bride that loves him that he's foresaw in his mind that would take every word above all these worldly things we've made pause and I know the word but how to perform it is where I'm having problems but at the end of the day anything about your performance is his performance must remain grace it must remain grace only way we can perform it is because of His grace hallelujah first community services number one spirit how does that spirit come through the sacrifice where did the spirit lay within the blood why couldn't he have a comeback it was an animal hallelujah wait a minute somebody ought to help me here why didn't they handle my blood come on us when Jesus he was an animal y'all scared to see that in it he was part animal God had to make him in this flesh in the image of an animal but God wasn't working with that there was a life that was behind that natural man that produced a spiritual party hello if the natural man can produce a natural body the spiritual body has to produce a spiritual body and we call it the glorified that's where the blood takes us to a complete adoption so much so we're changed from this model to immortality the first atom was made and created out like I'm like buddy verbatim says here's like feet like a monkey how he said it I was like a bear and he goes on like that he was all too touchy to feel and they communicate with this world hallelujah and the second atom what he gave in us was not only a theophany but he comes he brings us a a glorified body we'll be able to walk through walls if there be in here whatever y'all understand me if I said just like the natural man the image the natural man produced the image of a natural man he said just like the spiritual Adam which will produce a heavenly body a spiritual body and that's where we are hallelujah that's what the property God was trying to tell us we are our inheritance is of Elohim God accept existing one whatever then you were Jehovah Jireh and they're all of them this is where our inheritance come from you understand me we are it's the only difference is that God gave us a body after after Jesus y'all know what I'm saying but in those spirit in that Holy Ghost we're just a piece of God I don't know how else to say it and God call it a son if you and I don't get these things not hard in our minds how you gonna go to where you're going faith comes by hearing hearing by the Word of God right now you can't stand back and say well I'm Elohim no he's our him in him we existed you see all thing consists of him so that means there's nothing on the outside of him everything is in there is no space outside of God he feels everything yeah in the same time for the velum said as he is a mishit he said he's a person but he cannot be everywhere at the same time but because of his knowledge in his understanding he explained that with anybody better take it by faith and move on our little brains can't even comprehend their hmm all we know is this thing locked up in here it ain't a lot of room in there either you know I'm saying mine anyway let's move on by God's grace y'all understand what I'm going see we have to be careful and it is true we have been taught whether we realize it or not and in saints of God when God saved me honestly I was in a Baptist Church yes I would whether you know that or not when God saved me and I gave my heart to the Lord I was at 12 years old a Baptist Church and nobody can tell me otherwise we've got saved brother Branham where was he he wasn't in a Pentecostal church he was in the baptist but came to a Baptist Church God could have took him somewhere else he said but in that he learned he thought he thought one time that if you were in the Baptist you ain't got it and then he met these Pentecostals who had more than a Baptist so he learned he learned but a buck takes wherever but Len said that even an eagle can hatch I mean a a chicken Hatcher Eagle producing the right temperature oh that a hallelujah you can be born in the streets a lot of people was born in car over manure piles in the barns y'all hit me it's wherever they now to meet God is where God met them but we don't remain there that's just justification hallelujah and this is what I love about the Holy Spirit he will draw you but you can't move out of those churches if God don't draw you and my point is why would God said come out of her my people if he didn't have people still in there there may come a day that all God's people that out I'm talking about bride now right but until that day we can't this fellowship o Lord ourselves from people because they believe differently and that's where he says he called a colonization didn't colonized put walls around ourselves hallelujah I marvel at the prophet of God because there was a time he was at a me Macpherson's blessed her gravesite hello talk about how she was a wonderful pioneer and he knew the word I heard him call as this lady was up in the prayer line don't get me wrong folks I don't know what God is doing but be careful because you don't know the next step or the next place that person might be because they here today don't mean they they're not gonna go Father yeah and I'm saying how do we judge we look at the Holy Ghost by one spirit hallelujah don't get me wrong brother bellum blob eighty Bisco but any biscuit didn't get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ until after brother Branham was gone but he was a brother I'm not saying you got a walk exactly with them and do what they do but I just don't be Christianized people I had a wonderful experience today when I bought my car I witnessed to this young man he's of Spanish orient and I told her I said well down a road we'd get together and we have dinner on lunch together didn't know that his parents his grandparents his parents his gram waist up in the church all his life but he backs me and he said the other day when I call him he said I just whatever he said they get excited when I talk about church because they know I he said I was just telling them that you and I had planned on lunch or dinner he said in the phone way he said that was that was kind of strange that you call it the time I was talking about you he plans to come here I was so shocked he don't look up our church he know what we stand for every day he done searched me out tell you what I'm saying something is stirring in this young man's heart and God somehow made the connection it was powerful you know he talked about God I think more than I did today it was wonderful to know that God is making I've been praying I need help god help me I can't do all this by myself not talking that later but anyway cane religiously and a worshiper of God walked over and laid down his sacrifice got back and said Lord receive my sacrifice all this I have done and you know my regards to you and my faith in you look what a religious man he was Lord I built you a church and I paid into it and I pay hear me on the plate and I worship you everyday with the sincerity integrity of my heart you know me and I worship you and God refused him now if God only respected membership or just a person looking in the face of God and worshiping if God respects that and that is his requirement then he would be unjust to condemn king after Cain had done all of that that's exactly right but the scripture says there is a way that seemeth right unto man but the end thereof is the way of death so be careful Church why are you in this last days and things are floating and being these spirits are coming to the head and the wheat and the barley and the vines and everything are coming to a head don'tjump see it Israel is coming to a head and if Israel we who is the barley and we are the wheat we're coming to a head this thing is running out and I wouldn't want to be caught not willfully obey are disobeying the Word of God they're gonna be number or numbers of people who are saying but they got to go through the tribulation period because they fail to be obedient right I heard someone not long ago condemning the Lutheran age and condemning the Wesleyan age he said that was divine just the same as the church is today but the thing of it was they were only put forth Lee there is putting forth fruit now the vine is grown up the same charge and then well was old leaves is still left leaves but if it makes by sea like the week coming up among the weeds and the week put forth hits see the week put forth his fruit and the wheeze put forth of his fruit we're at the end time we're at the last day hallelujah and let me tell you something a desire I love this because a desire to be perfect by Christ knowing that the only way that you can do it or can be done you must depend upon him hallelujah he said I am the vine and you are branches hallelujah when he said I brother Brooks how do I come to perfection yield yield yield right because you know a men when they get though bushes of apples or grapes or one they said this that tree yielded more food fruit see the fruit was already in it hallelujah but it gave way to the manifestation of the fruit the Holy Ghost which is Christ in you is in you and every perfect gift comes so the Holy Ghost is perfectly perfect in you and it can bring for perfect character if you hear to it is this okay so I want you to see by God's grace you know as at the scripture we were talking about how did the children of Israel they you know are sawing and they said one to another it is a manna and they wish not what it was and Moses said unto them this is the bread which the Lord has given it to you to eat this is the thing that the Lord had commanded commanded gather up it every man according to his eating and Omar for every man according to the number of your persons taking every man for them which are in his tents and the children of Israel did so and gather some more and some less and when they did meet it was a NOLA he that gathered much had nothing over and he that gathered little had no life they gathered every man according to his eating and moses said let no man leave it leave of it till the morning in other words there are some people a man who eats a lot they've fully studied and and that it just feels enough and then there who doesn't require as much and it feels it but whatever they eat they're not supposed to leave it till tomorrow that means you must have daily bread teach us how to pray give us this day our daily bread see Jesus couldn't do no different anybody commanded them to do in the Old Testament you understand me so that means when you don't read a study every day you're breaking the word because it must be daily you the one that would get weak God never gets weak but you will become weak because you're not feeding on his word you saw brothers I don't know where to start God listens he you can talk to him and he'll tell you exactly where to go just for your daily bread some of us are not great readers huh and God knows that all you got to do is say Lord just show me something give me something for the day he'll do it hallelujah give us our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debt toss see give us our daily bread but don't forget to forgive your brothers and your sisters because if you don't do that this bread won't do you no good God will not work over unforgiveness hello you got a problem with forgiveness you know we all do I was telling somebody the other day it took me three years to get a brother for what he did he said three years oh I did I would say Lord I forgive them Lord I forgive them Lord I forgive them please help me Lord but that's what I'm trying to say I said please help me see because I'm gonna tell you something some of us might not want to acknowledge it but when you feel those funny feelings about people that supposed to be okay with you that's unforgiveness God's warning you that there's something unpure in you and sometimes we show we think his discernment that that other brother or that other sisters wrong huh that's dig deep and see where the error is I did wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord and let me say like this god no I was telling the brother the other day I said you know what the Bible said if you have the will to do God has already counted in each other because he know eventually it get it will is going to happen oh you say well if I die like this if you die like that God then call it already done that's the scripture if there is a will to do God look it up God is already counting down but there must be a will to overcome it the reason why I was able to overcome cuz I don't like to be in bondage I don't like nobody controlling me the only person I want controlling me is God nobody but him we must examine ourselves hello whether whosoever shall eat this bread see you gotta understand I don't know your heart and I could only preach what he's telling me to preach but I know God is in this my thing is I'm just sayin examine yourself it's good to say it's to see whether you be in the face is this okay drinky all of it I love this you know I'm trying to come to a close and I just got a few more because I want you to realize by God's grace that if you and I are not constantly filled with this Holy Spirit we're going to come up short what happened because then you began to drink like you began to think like a carnal mind the Holy Spirit keeps you in the mind of God is that right oh come on we looked at it this way when you are drunk let's say offline whose mine you have been it ain't yours it's whatever spirit or not at you and when you drunk all the holy ghost whose mine do you have exactly you say things that you didn't knew didn't have no intention to say sometimes we prophesy didn't even know we were prophesy your blessed people you never curse you bless him that's blessed blessed blessed because about said blessed and cursed aha see here you good you're drunk you know and I love drunk folks now understand me that the scenario of it because when they're drunk of real wine there is no prejudice among them you can smell like a coup and that drunker to drink that both in here you won't and they didn't criticize you if you don't want any y'all remember the day it's real and that's how it is when it comes to spiritually being drunk you want everybody to feel what you feeling you want him to have that joy y'all know what I'm saying call Holly nothing listen that's how come a lot of drunks and then they die Nicole because they're so hot they can't even feel the cold weather some of them I don't know about all over this somebody truckin can feel it I'm just saying but you know that that alcohol in their body they don't feel how cold it really is yes that's what I better say it that way listen oh man I love the Lord God is perfect in all this way listen and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it I look at people day I try - I don't do it no more cause it discourages me when people don't taking the wine company going didn't really get any I had a sister there and in Lima you almost had to put her ass at the end of the line because she took whatever there I don't know how she did and I was I really wanted she said that's right she said I take the best piece of bread and I take the biggest gulp I can because I'm it represents Christ and I won't all and from then on I'd be taking y'all she betray I try to drink as much as my mouth and I tear the brand up when nobody else want the rest of it I failed to leave it that's what I'm thinking in my mind when I do communion I'm thinking God I won't as much as you could keep me who be sippin off of it and that's all I get in it spiritual life just the sale you know people are messed up in their mind you know they can trust these restaurants with their food and drink and then when it comes to the cup don't make sense to me you don't know what those people in that restaurant doing you trust them more than you do the cup of God that's why I said we're not wiping that glass we're wiping germs we're just making it you know wet dry that's it we don't have to do that but I know some people can't take it any way that's gone this is my blood of the New Testament you know that new tested that word Testament means wheel this is my law this is my wheel which is to share which is was shed for the remission of sin mmm hallelujah so it is God's will to multiply ooh that's what his will was the first thing he said to Adam and Eve he said beat multiply replenish the earth that was his will they have more of him oh and the only way he could have lured him was the shed his blood so that life that bypassed us because of sin could come back to us his wheel is faster be perfect that's what he said be perfect as your father which is in heaven is perfect the prophet god said the only way that that could be done God himself had to make a way for us to be perfect you go out the daughter your will all of us all the time every day we hear Jesus said Lord not my will but thine be done he wasn't just saying that he was fighting battling with his with his humanity and yet you listen I'm gonna tell you something if you think and this is what I want you to understand I want everybody to understand that every Christian when you become a Christian you have signed up not just for the allow me of the Lord but you have signed up to go to the battlefield immediately you arm yourself to war every day don't you think you go get some kind of vacation a break not in this one I don't care how old you get the devil go still be fighting you you posed to put that armor on you going battle hallelujah listen I've been saved since I was 12 years old I said like that before the foundation of the world um you want to go there but my point is I've battled all my life hallelujah there were times I even went AWOL but you know when you're in the Army of God God go send somebody for you he gonna arrest you you'll be in prison for a while but by the time he's done with you you be ready to fight God won't lose one I like it the way Jesse said it the other death egg was Jesse he said in the midst of the battle no that was that brother brother Maryland Sunday night in the midst of the battle he is is David taking a a window break looking through the window Yahoo was that no that was our brother brother Troy I remember the word I just couldn't remember who was saying it and that they stopped with me I said we spend more time looking through the window then we do fighting and battling for god this thing is of the devil we you know we use it for God but if you know if you're not the controller of this thing it will control you it will command you and dictate to you it becomes your Bathsheba yes sir I said that's right iPhones iPads and uh everything ah everything it's the truth listen I'm closing on these thoughts you and I and let me tell you something what brother Adam said he says when a man has the ball we supposed to rally about the law the man with the ball we're not supposed to want to take the ball from the man and we're not supposed to want to do something different you understand what I'm saying I'm going with the pastor's vision I have been here 11 years and I still have yet to see a full response with the pastor on his vision it just seems like everybody going their own little way and and that's that's that's why you have all that aha church hopping because the everybody said where the Lord led me and the Lord lead me and you know I talked with a brother who who's from Jesse church and the brother him in the church a long time with a lolly dingly to visit and here's your pastor suffering because you are not taking the vision that God is he can go little further he can if you're not gonna follow behind his vision his work here is in vain now he's running he and his wife all over the place amen and Jesse's there needing him and that's what we find it in this place there may have been some people telling me they weren't gonna come Sunday night but I said oh my god I I mean you know what I'm saying it was it was embarrassing that this church was full of Iowa City and only a few people from Des Moines now I don't know about you and I jumped with my saw but I'm gonna finish it I don't know about you but I would feel pretty bad if I was from Iowa City cuz nobody ever goes down there but they make the sacrifice to come up here and then when they do make the sacrifice to come up here the people that goes to this church disappears then I sent him some bad advice so I made a plan told me but my point is this there are those who've never called never texts never did anything and didn't even show up and I was very very disappointed I had a battle of my lifetime and on top of that you no longer took don't text me the very a few hours or so before getting here he's not coming so when he's not coming that mean his group is not coming but it's okay the Holy Ghost showed up and my thing is this there was such a unity in this place oh it felt good and when the Lord came down through that song it was awesome y'all understand me and I look at this thing and I said lord have mercy you know it was so funny it happened the way it did because I had just went down there Friday spoke to them on this suddenly similar to this and I told my said Iowa people are different I said when I was in Ohio I said these people would even travel with me even from state to state I said but I'm not asking for state to state I said even when I came here I said I came in so well anybody need rides will help you can go with us we're glad for you know body yet I wish everybody was here tonight I will live I will encourage him to take this message and I'm gonna encourage them also to listen to the last portion because my point is I'm a recent scripture here in just a minute to back up what I'm saying if we are bribed we've got to have one head and one hand over the head but Jesus Christ is the head of this church brother Brooks is the pastor who's the head of the church local right you know I was so blessed when Pilate and brother Colley weekend when y'all came in as cold as it was and ice is the road that goes down your Road I'm like Oh Lord a real rebuke I'm glad you did too it made my night yes you know and my thing is this you know the scripture tells us that you know let me read something just first Chronicles 12 38 through 40 says all these men of war that could keep rank came with the perfect hard to heed room to make David over all Israel and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David King and they went out with they were with David three days eating and drinking for their brethren had prepared for them now you got to understand this is a type of the Millennium this is the type of the wedding supper because they come to crown here King right and when we go to crown him King three years really have it's just three days so and they were listen what they were doing and they were with David three days eating and drinking for their brethren had prepared for them moreover they that were nigh them even unto in Sakhalin simulant and Ethel I brought bread on asses and cameras and amuse and own auxins and meat and meal and cakes of peas and bunches of raisins and wine and oil and oxen and sheep abundantly but there was joy in Israel hallelujah but what is it they came with one heart I'm not telling people to come make me king but I will I want to see God King whether it be in Des Moines Iowa City with one body and that's what I want to see that's what I've been called for I did not come here to play Church you understand me this is on my heart and I'm gonna say it just like he wants me to said I just wish everybody was here they're people that leaves charge go anywhere they want to go and don't never call me never say anything and and this is what I'm saying you see well who are you brother works I came making nothing but you know what there's a word called RESP ECT and that's respect you ain't gonna be in somebody else's army what sergeant I just thought I'd go to the restroom I didn't mean it that way brother but my heel because he does go to the restroom but my that ain't the point my point is you got to say sure sir yes sir can you go can I be excused or whatever and he's got to respond yes or no that's the natural army I would never try to stop anybody from doing whatever they want to do but this is a respect of somebody saying brother Brooks I'm not gonna be here and then I won't be able for you that was our I see guys my thoughts what good did they get an accident well I'm a watchman that means i watch everything now the holy spirit moves right away from the Pentecostal age what did they do they organised made themselves we are an assembly of god we are oneness we are two years we are Church of God we are this or that you don't belong you you can't get into heaven unless you got your name on our books oh such nonsense I don't care if you are Baptist Methodist Presbyterian you put your name on the book of life when God puts it on day oh did he do it and when did he do it before the foundation of the world Oh Lord I got saved today hello you just acknowledged your salvation today god save you in the mind in the line right I don't care if you're Baptist Methodist resident you put your name on the book of life when God puts it on there if you were a predestinated to eternal life God will call you some way somehow some way or other he sure will all the father has given me will count no matter what church you belong to that has nothing to do with it but the denominations will never do one thing to you but light can do you a lot from going on with God that's all I can do him to you that'll never do nothing else congregation you get together with a bunch of believers and unbelievers of course you hit that everywhere you go and they even had it in heaven so it's alright but you're looking to your denomination look to Jesus he's the one to look to that okay let me read this one more screw the scripture here that I overlooked the Bible says and I showed you there in David how they wouldn't break ring-ring right all these men a war that could keep rank hello whatever position God put you in that's where you stay so they shall run then this is Joelle 2:7 they shall run like mighty men they should climb the wall like men of war and they shall march everyone on his ways and they shall not break their ranks you know that's why I'm so happy tonight because God vindicated that service so I I have the right and the authority to preach it like I'm preaching because God Himself indicated it I would tell you something and and I don't know how it is how it can be but all I know is that when that man who was leading hallelujah hallelujah I said oh my god that sound just like me I said but that's impossible but he did in my years he did and I kept singing and kept listening and I'm like oh that's impossible but God can make all things possible I don't understand it but I was among that choir well somebody didn't sound like me Oh God have mercy listen Joe to $0.07 they shall run like mighty men they should climb the wall like in a war and they shall march everyone on his ways and they shall not break their ranks neither shall one thrust another y'all know what that means you're not gonna kill your brother you're not gonna warn your brother not on purpose you're not going to thrust him right they shall walk everyone in his path and when they fall upon the sword they should not be wounded I'm gonna tell you something a lot of the times you know we look at this call message you know what we do we say to ourselves well we need to get on a car but we leave everybody else out hallelujah and we fail to recognize the body of Christ the body of Christ is not everybody that's around this message the body of Christ are those who are sealed with the Holy Ghost that's the body of Christ well say what hey listen I believe it all my heart that a man knowing that he should be baptized the name of Lord Jesus Christ will Pitt be penalized for not being in fact baptized right but you got somebody that don't know it but yet God is giving them the Holy Ghost how are you gonna judge it and I know a lot of message people wouldn't like that but I care I don't care not like that I'm just interested in the way the Prophet preacher I'm taught about all it's all nonsense that people have thrown in here because they brought their denominational spirit in this message and he ain't never been born again you understand what we've done but brother Branham said watch that's all watch that spiritual bride there is a spiritual bride and I'm part of it yes sir if there be therefore any consolation in Christ I'm closing on this if any confident love if any fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfil ye like joy this is what he says Paul he said that ye be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord and of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others that means you should be more concerned about your brothers and your sisters than you are yourself we're all guilty where it comes to me just like it comes to you we're all guilty and sometimes here's a brother Jared he hadn't come yet or Jeremy I don't know whether he's gonna ever visit us or not but anyway this brother he said listen he's looking for fellowship and I was hard in my spirit only man who's not looking for fellowship and really none of us should ever feel lonely because we got more than two people in this church but there are those who do we just got to work on it let God help us you know that love the Lord I'm almost done look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things other that's the mighty God unveiled before that's the message that came from in 1964 the man I used that scripted and it was too People of God rapture ready rapture ready means love in loving one another more than we love ourselves that's what it is I need to be there I'm not saying I'm there I need to be there I was telling a brother earlier I said you know what how many times I'm called at times for witnessing people go down witness with me and what I get just my family too busy for that is everybody's in their own thing and following leadership is important is this okay if you fall on the sword it won't kill you but I want correction and when God came here the other night that really blessed my soul and I'm gonna tell you something it was not my imagination I threw it out there and I had no idea other people that heard I just hoped but I told what people in Iowa City because it was filming everything I said wouldn't that be wonderful give his own tape the God would grant us to hear those voices again I need help y'all pray for me because my desire is to really see this church but until this little group you don't want to court stop colonizing ourselves and separating ourselves and and we sometimes think I don't know what you think but all I know is everybody in hitting to stop it just home allow sales and think about one purpose and that is to see that this message shake Iowa I told those people in Iowa City because they they love to have me come down but I told me you know what I said I don't know what all God is gonna do and I don't know what all God's doing I said but God brought me here I'm not gonna be distracted I know God is doing something down there you understand me but I'm not getting it's place it's been vindicated but how can I get everybody to see what I'm trying to get him to do brother branham's talked about the people who in his day on listened to it option on the adoption for any brother man talks about how there's one brother died with a beat but uh not Bosworth um the man from our Chicago Way he's like a Swedish man huh Jose he said Beau's a he's even he tells all the things Jose don't even need this message but he loved him and he said look what Beau's a has done for Christ don't have no gift at all but he can't breathe and he said he took what he had and has won thousands of people maybe millions to people to Christ with just what he had he said what about those of you who believed this message and he said it's so sad because the time has passed their time to do what they needed to do was not done I don't want my time your time to pass and we have not done what God has done ordained us to do look at what we got look at this message he said you ought to be zealous about this message every day that's what he said don't listen to it every day not some day every day somebody need to be told I need help lord y'all know what I'm saying my point is this Russia you should believe in this message if you have no zeal enjoy it's like the rich girl ooh you got all this food on the table and you don't even give Lazarus none that is a poor man that needs it he's got to eat crumbs from your cake may God help us physically I know some of us are not able time time with the ones of us who are able you know that's what he says he said look at me and what was his assistant brother never he said we're getting old he said we won't be able to do as much as we used to do basically I'm paraphrasing but don't listen to it these are look at all these young people he said that's what we needed to understand we must prepare him prepare for their tomorrow he saying how down it down there and Jefferson field how they were taking the fish in the nets and catching them and killing them in his stitch just do whatever they want to do with the fish he said they're not even thinking about the generation to come is it because if they keep going the way they go on from my son or somebody to catch the so-called fish would be outlaw what was he doing you killing more people or fish faster than they can multiply because of greed and whatever more he said they're not preparing for their children now this message have been prepared for us there have been people who have stood and did the best they could do for us we don't know how long GOG Andheri I trust he don't tear into you know I'm hoping Easter early Easter like my son-in-law said it's April Fool's Day first day of up up up April right what if God take that same term and rapture us on that day let it let them who didn't believe be fools that ain't mind that has he hit but you know just think about it he said he gets the last laugh and what are we seeing in this atmosphere and everything that's happening folks you will be foolish if you can't see the coming of the Lord may God help us let us stand Father we come before your Lord as humble as you know how we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy Lord we thank you for being so good to us so kind we're nobody Lord we're just trying to do what you want us to do Lord I don't know I know it's got to be each and every individual that must have that desire to serve you with all their hearts I pray father God that while you're sending out those blessings bless me to know if it means fanatical if it means out of my mind crazy whatever they call it laws so let it be I don't want to be a lay or DC I want to be fired up hallelujah my mind my body my soul Lord if I must suffer persecution for your name sake cause you said they that live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution so help me father some where the target is not being struck stricken missing the target somehow I don't know it's judging their own self I don't want to be a different kind of Christian if I got the same Holy Ghost my Holy Ghost supposed to make me act just like it made Peter James John and the rest of the law help me help us Lord God only you can do this we ask o God that you do this thing for us know that we may love you with all our heart mind body and soul because I know if we love you with all of our heart mind body and soul we will love our brothers and our sisters we'll be willing to lay down our lives with
