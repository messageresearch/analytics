the lord we're just gonna get right on into the word of god we do thank you appreciate all of you for being here uh just a simple message just tonight but simple but but i believe uh if we could see it it would be a great blessing to us to understand it we appreciate uh god for just being so real to us i think he's more real now to me than he's ever been in my entire life and i'm grateful because it's nothing that i've done to deserve this goodness i was speaking with a sister today and i was just telling her that with the way god has been dealing with me uh it's i'm surprised that i'm still standing here because sometimes i feel like an explosion and i thank god if he would give me everything the way he gives my god where would i be now we realize by god grace that we're living in the last days and everything is tough you know don't expect it to get any better if we're living in the days if we're living in the last days take god at his word and trust him turn with me now to luke the 11th chapter uh beginning at the first verse uh so that you understand everybody is going through tremendous battles right now we just had a sister call me today and um we're going to pray for her at the at the end of the service but the enemy is attacking her business that she's had for years don't want to go into detail but except unless god intervenes uh you know we really don't know what it's going to be like but she was telling me today regardless to what happens truly she will continue to serve god it's it's a real big situation where uh basically uh she wasn't expecting it as far as i know of and and you know the government has a way of doing things but you know when you stand for christianity uh you're putting yourself in harm's way when it comes to the world but christianity is it's it's not a religion it's a life it's a life so before i get into the message let us turn to luke 11th chapter i've been trying to rush with thoughts i was on my way down to the church and while i was driving thoughts were coming there was no way i could type these things down or write these things down and i missed a few of them and i thought you know i've got to find a way of a machine that i could just talk to while i'm driving because sometimes things come to mind and if you don't get it right then you seem to miss it but i hope by god's grace that god will give us what he wants us to have tonight i was gleaning from some other notes that i had and trying to pull everything together i'm not the fastest typist in the world and i feel somewhat embarrassed sometimes but i do know where i'm going uh when god helped me to preach the word uh sometimes you get back in that room and then new thoughts comes and it just continues but luke 11 1-13 amen we're going to read there everybody's there amen and it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him lord teach us to pray as john also taught his disciples and he said unto them when ye pray say our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day out by day our daily bread and forgive us of our sins for we also forgive everyone that is indebted to us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil and he said unto them which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him friend lend me three loaves for a friend of mine in his journey has come to me and i have nothing to set before him and he from within shall answer and say trouble me not the door is now shut my children are with me in bed i cannot rise and give thee i say unto you though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend yet because of his impotunity he will rise and give him as many as he needed and i say unto you ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you now if if you realize what jesus is saying there is a door there's a way there's an entrance into prayer and he is the door he said if you ask and you seek and you knock on my door it will be open unto you and everyone that seek it everyone that asks us receive it and he that seeketh find it and to him that knock it it shall be opened you love the lord if a son shall ask bread of any of you that he is a father will he give him a stone or if he asks a fish will he for a fish give him a serpent or if he asks an egg will he offer him a scorpion if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him amen let us pray father god we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us lord we thank you father for being who you are you've chosen us from the foundation of the world to be your temple your body in this day and i pray father that you will open our eyes and give us greater revelation of who we are and what we are to be in these last days lord we thank you for being the god the only true living god that has made yourself known unto us have thine on the way in the service in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen we may be seated when it comes to prayer prayer is a a real serious situation it's a thing that some people really think they know how but prayer is not the multitude of words or the the way a person may say it i can recall the time with brother brannon when he first met god he says lord i don't even know how to pray and he began to say abcdefg and he said listen god knew exactly what he meant
