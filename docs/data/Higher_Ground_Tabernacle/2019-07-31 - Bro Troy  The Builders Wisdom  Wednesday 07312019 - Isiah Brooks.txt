book of Exodus chapter 31 a man who believes that they're the called of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen Exodus chapter 31 we'll read first verse down all the way through the eleventh verse these scriptures here talk about some men of God that were called a men called and anointed by God he meant for a special purpose Amen Exodus 31 1 it says and the Lord said spake unto Moses saying see I have called by name Bezalel the son of your I the son of Earth of the tribe of Judah and I have filled him with the Spirit of God in wisdom and an understanding and in knowledge and all manner of workmanship to devise cunning works to work in gold and in silver and in breasts and in cutting of stones to set them and in carving of timbers to work in all manner of workmanship and behold I have given with him a holy of the son of Ozma of the tribe of Dan and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom that they may make all that I have commanded thee the tabernacle of the congregation and the Ark of the testimony and the mercy seat that is there upon and all the furniture of the tabernacle and the table and his furniture and the pure candlestick and with all his furniture and the altar of incense and the altar of burnt-offering with all of his furniture and the labor and his foot and the clothes of service and the holy garments for aaron the priest the garments of his sons to minister in the priest's office and this anointing oil and the sweet incense for the holy place according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do amen let's just borrow has no word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just want to thank you Laura for tonight for another evening Lord where we would get gather together in your name law father in your presence according to a promise that you gave to us Lord and Laura we came tonight to claim that promise father or we claim it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or we will reject all the power of the enemy and all the foolishness of the world father and we turn to you and we receive your promise tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or whatever it is that you'd have for us we say yes Lord and amen to a father and we're just asking you right now Lord to reveal your word to us Father and in the by the power of your Holy Ghost Lord through this vessel that you gave me father that that your word we may know and they get once more to the people father and we're claiming it Lord according to your promise just now and the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you can be seated trust everybody's had a good week in the Lord so far amen I just this scripture here is speaking after as Moses was receiving the vision of the tabernacle from the Lord he spent 40 days and 40 nights face to face with Jehovah amen and as he received that pattern of this of the Tabernacle in the wilderness as Moses received the vision God foresaw that there will be someone anointed to put the vision into action a man that there will be not not that Moses wouldn't be the one doing all the work no but there would be someone who could take the vision of the Prophet and actually take whatever so well this is how the thoughts that were upon the mind of God transferred to physical items upon the earth amen is that God had something in his mind and what he did is he sit that thought that idea to his prophet to his sermon upon the earth amen and the oldest prophet there will be those upon the earth they will take this vision and they will run with it I have anointed them I have called them by name I know who they are and they are able to reach and grab with the 19 that I give them and they're going to have a wisdom that I have imparted to them and their hands will be put to the work and when they are done your the vision that I have given you will be made perfect upon the earth and the thing is is it worked amen it actually worked when when the tabernacle was created when the tabernacle was finished upon the earth the vision that God had given unto Moses had actually been created according to the pattern amen and God saw and it was good amen amen so that whatever the vision was by the wisdom that was given unto these men the workmanship was made perfect amen God gave them the wisdom look what says there in verse three and I have filled him with the Spirit of God step 1 amen the very first thing God mentions about this man is that first he says I have called him by name amen and then he who takes the man that was called by name and he fills him with the Spirit of the Living God amen this is beginning to sound familiar who here has been called by Jehovah Amen if you've ever once had the call of God upon your life God has something for you to do amen there's a vision in this day amen and let let him who hears run by him who hears be faithful to what the vision says he meant why because if God ever once calls you that means he has certain expectations for you in this world amen and we have to be faithful to me about our father's business amen why because we received a call I think we can all testify that we've heard said over this pulpit that we were called by name Amen we were called by name well there's a certain responsibilities that are given to unto people who God is called by name we are called to be the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ that's a high and holy calling a man and that gives us certain responsibilities amen so God called us and he ordained us to be filled with that great mysterious Holy Spirit of God that we've been talking about amen the same one that created the heavens and the earth now as down to fill you a man is not here to fill you so you have something to brag about not so - you have something - something that you can check off your list something you've attained something you've acquired but we're here to me about the father's business a man what we're here to take what the vision has been made plain in this day of what there should be on the earth in this day the vision has been made plain someone's got to take the wisdom of God and make sure it comes to pass now now now this man here bezel ill when he began to realize who he was and what he was ordained to do upon the earth the next step was he actually had to do it amen he actually had to do what he was called to do amen that's what every single one of us have to come to that point in our lives where we realize that we were put here for a purpose that we are called for a certain reason and we have to actually put it into action amen first you have to realize who you are amen once you've been called you have no ability to sit down say what I wonder if you really meant that no once you've been called you must run amen let the man who is jesus said the man that looks back is not even worthy of the calling amen but once you've been called you have to put your hands to the plow and move forward amen God says expects you to see the sign once and believe forever once you've seen God do something in your life in yours to take that up and run with it amen amen see I have called by name bezel ile of the son of your are the son of or of the triad Juba and I have filled him with the Spirit of God amen he's been in power what'd he give him I gave I fill him with the Spirit of God in wisdom and understanding and in knowledge and all manner of workmanship amen so the things that he was actually good at God had had ordained things in his that were rising up they were abilities in his life that were spirit that were spiritually set on fire amen he was good at certain things why was he good at certain things because the spirit was anointing those things and bringing them to the surface so that the things that you know it's like the things a lot of times you see people I wonder if so-and-so's call for this so-and-so it's called for that usually men are called for what they're you find them doing a man usually you don't have to wonder too much about what someone's called to do because you'll just naturally find them doing what they're supposed to be doing amen we'll try to put our titles to it I wonder if so-and-so is called to be this or if so-and-so is called to do that well you just let so-and-so get underneath the Holy Spirit of the Living God and then watch those fruits start coming up out of his life amen and then you can say oh I see what brother so-and-so is called to be why because once you submit yourself to the Holy Ghost there are fruits they'll come up in your life and those fruits generally state what you're called to do there's not really a much of a wandering about it oh I wonder if I'm this are wandering off on that you don't really have to wonder too much you have to submit to the Holy Ghost and let the fruits come up out of your life the more you tent spine the more time you still spend praying the more time you spend in the anointing of the Holy Ghost the more time you spend asking here am i Lord send me Lord I am available for service Lord I've washed my life Lord I've gotten myself ready Lord Here I am Lord send me anoint me Lord fill me what would you have me to do Lord I'm ready for service the more time you spend doing that in your life then pretty soon you'll it's not going to be a mystery what you're called to do what because the spirit itself that God gives you will drive you to in the direction of your calling yeah what Paul say see that you walk worthy of the vocation wherein you are called amen and as like the but like the Bible said or like a we said a while back you know when a when a plumber walks into a restroom say there's water all over the floor and and and so it walks into the bathroom they say I don't know what's going on here I better call a plumber why cuz there's water in here and it's not where it belongs the water is supposed to be in the pipes or in the fixtures in anything it's on the floor so what they do they call someone who knows and they call a plumber the plumber comes in and he immediately starts envisioning all the pipes inside the walls he knows where all the vent pipes are and where the drain lines are where the supply lines are where the valves are and where the main sewer line is and he can begin to discern where the problem is and what what the issue is amen and he'll go like it's this water from the supply lines there's this water from the sewer what's going on here amen and he begins to envision all that but a man that has no training and plumbing just walks in there I don't know what's going on better call someone better call someone that knows amen they better call an expert someone in the field but you know if you if you call so if you call Christian to go in that room who doesn't have money for a plumber what does he do he gets Lord I need help Lord I need you to fix my restroom why now if you call plumber to go in there he's he reaches to his own self to his own knowledge to fix the problem but you call Christian in there and he's like I don't know how to fix this I'm going to my Lord and Savior amen why because a plumber does that well he's called to do but we're not called to be plumbers were called to be believers amen we're called to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ amen were called to trust in Him in all things this is like you know a mechanic sometimes naturally have a hard time trusting the Lord for his car a man why because he knows what's he could first his first sighs they go to his own mental thinking to fix what's wrong with this car a plumber oh I have a hard time trusting Lord for fixing his bathroom because he his mental thinking knows what's wrong with his bathroom but we're not called to be plumbers or mechanics were called to be believers well a doctor might have a hard time having trusting in the Lord for for some natural remedy and a problem with the body because he knows all this little surgical fix this or this this medicine here we'll fix that but we're not called be those things our vocation is is that we are to be believers amen we are to trust in the Living God we know that if there is a problem that God knows the solution amen and we are in we've been called and anointed to trust the Lord amen amen so when God gave a vision of there being a headquarters upon the earth a place where he could place his name he had a vision of a of a restoration amen a restoration in type of the Garden of Eden a manner where a place where people could come back and get in right relations with Jehovah amen here was a vision that was given and the Prophet took the vision and went out and expressed the vision to the people amen and what do and what happened the God had a people ready to give a willing heart where the materials comfort from the tabernacle it was from a willing heart sacrifice the Bible says that they took up offering of those that were willing a men everything was nothing was done by force everything was done by the willing hearted people amen Moses had be willing to be the Prophet they meant he had to submit himself underneath the rulership of Jehovah amen the people had to be willing to give their resources to the work of the Lord they had to bring in the RAM skins they had to bring in the oil they had to bring oh they had to be willing and they gave a willing heart sacrifice for the people and then what this man here had be willing to accept the wisdom of Jehovah you know it takes submission to get that wisdom you don't just get that wisdom without first submitting yourself to the Lord and you've got to happen you actually have to possess this wisdom we cannot get by without it you think well I'm a pretty smart guy we have to forget all that we know and reject all that to receive the wisdom of the Lord Jesus Christ amen why because God is not interested in using our own natural thinking our own for wisdom but God has a wisdom to give you a man but it only comes through submitting yourself to the Lord Jesus Christ it only comes through humbleness through humility amen oh it only comes through weakness through perfect weakness comes perfect strength but as long as you hold on to your own natural abilities your own natural intelligence as long as you think you're smarter than everybody else are smarter than this then God's wisdom is not for you God's wisdom can't penetrate amen God's wisdom will never penetrate through your own natural thinking amen first you have to lay that down to receive the wisdom of the Lord Jesus Christ amen but it is for you anybody that is can look down and identify themselves as the call you have to receive that amen you have to actually receive that a man once God calls you upon your life it's your job and your duty to receive that if you never receive that call it passes on to someone else amen God will not always strive with me amen if God ever once touches you if you ever once feel God drawing you then you have a responsibility to respond and say here my lord I'm submitting myself to you God ever once cause you you have to submit to him amen amen but look how powerful that calling was once they submit to it they were filled with wisdom understanding and knowledge and all workmanship amen they're ready to do what they were called to do they couldn't just sit around and do nothing they or knew is the more they submitted to God the more they submitted worked underneath that Holy Spirit the more fruits sort of popping up in their life a little bit of this a little bit of that a little bit of this and it became evident Amen that they were the called a man you know there was a lot of buildings on the earth back then and that date but this Ark of the cover is time and the wilderness excelled every single one of them why because they weren't builded built by men that just had a natural idea amen every building is built by the wisdom of some men but these men use the wisdom of God to build something amen they used they they were given a portion of the wisdom of God by amen - submitted to the idea of Jehovah you know I think about our day we've been given a vision we've been given a vision there will be a bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen there will be a bride she'll be without spot she'll be without wrinkle she'll be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus Christ she will be filled with the Holy Ghost she has received the message of this hour amen and she is and she has walked in accordance to that vision amen arrey though there has been a willing heart sacrifice in this day amen but the willing heart didn't come from the people this time it came from Jehovah himself Jehovah himself gave the sacrifice this time amen back then the people gave the sacrifice amen but now Jehovah himself sent his own son to be the willing sacrifice this time I am giving it myself I am doing it myself and now the the willing the the people that are given the wisdom the called is now the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ she has received the vision of the Prophet amen who spent time face-to-face with Jehovah brother Branham spent time face to face with the Lord Jesus Christ he received a vision in this day he identified the material and says it is the Holy Spirit of the Living God and it is for you amen this time this day the willing heart sacrifice came from Jesus himself amen when he laid down his life for us amen he laid down his life for us amen why did Christ come he said I came to call sinners to repentance amen he says I came to fulfill the in the profits I came to bring a sword to the earth a man I came to divide family say men I came to divide a mother from her children a mean I came to divide a son from his father a men and that sword comes to the earth and divides between the called and the uncalled a men divides between the called and the uncalled it will separate families it will separate friends it will celebrate separate you from your acquaintances it will separate you from all kinds of things why because you are the called Amen and as soon as you receive that call you begin being separated from the natural things of this world you begin B to be separated from the natural relationships in this world because your joining to him amen that's the law of the marriage when a man is joined to his wife amen he he leave he forsakes his father and his mother and he Cleaves unto his spouse a mansoura we called joined as the bride to the Lord Jesus Christ as we are separated from our friends were separated from our families were separated from from from everything that in this world and were joined to the Lord Jesus Christ amen and he submitted he came that we might have life and that we might have life more abundantly a man he came to save that which was lost a man he came to give life to the world like a like it was a loaf of bread amen he came to give sight to the blind and blindness to those who say they see amen there was a dividing line amen all those that claim that they see will receive blindness all those that say Lord Lord healed my vision he'll give their sight amen a man went through the New Testament I was just reading all the things that Jesus came to do and I was just writing them down he says he came that they might have life and have it more abundantly he said I also came as a light to the believer that they should not abide in darkness amen Jesus Christ your husband came that you might be a light to the believer why that you might walk in life amen but when you walk in light it gives you a certain duty to behave according to the tenets of this Bible a mean you have to actually be obedient to it if you say that you are the called you have to become obedient to this gospel amen all right he also says I came so that no one would have a cloak for their sin he's dividing it's a dividing time what is sin but when you know how to do something you won't do it it's unbelief amen amen the church was built by this wisdom think about the Twelve Apostles did they know how to build a church they didn't know how to build a church they're fishermen but God gave them a wisdom to build something think about it when they when they when the scribes and the Pharisees came to Jesus and Jesus says tear this building down I'll build it again in three days and they sat into him we built this building it took us 46 years to build this thing and how can you rebuild it in three days well they were there what it wasn't they were the builders again hey they were supposed to be the same builders just like it was back in the day they are supposed to have the same anointing there's a bond this man Bentley though why because they are supposed to be building the temple of God and to have it in a condition where people could come and meet Jehovah amen say brother were they builders let's go to Matthew 21 Matthew 21:14 Jesus comes into the rides into the Jerusalem on the back of a donkey a man he's worshiped and he goes into the temple and and as he enters into the temple this is rafter he casts out all the money changers with the whip a man and it comes down to verse 14 and it says and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and He healed them my Jesus was showing what should be happening this is what should be going on amen there should be a place in the temple where people who are people can come and have their problems taken care of amen where they can come and meet Jehovah amen and when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did and the children crying in the temple saying Hosanna to the son of David they were sore displeased and they said unto Him hearest thou what these say and Jesus and oh yeh have you not never read out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou has perfected praise amen now Jesus leaves the temple and he goes out and spends the night outside town in Bethany and then the next morning he comes back to the temple again in verse 23 and verse 23 the the the chief priest had come back to him to talk to him about the things that took place the day before what happened they saw Jesus come into Jerusalem they saw him worship they saw him fulfilling the Old Testament they saw him fulfilling Old Testament Scriptures and they wanted to know by what authority do you take these scriptures claiming to be for you what ye do why are you claiming that these Old Testament Scriptures are applying to you amen verse 23 it says and when he has come into the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching and said by what authority doest thou these things and who gave thee this authority and jesus answered and said them I will also I'll also ask you one thing which if you tell me I will and likewise will tell you by what authority I these things the baptism watch where he says there the baptism of John whence was it from heaven or of men I'm gonna give you a question God sent a prophet to the earth did you listen to him or not Amen God sent a prophet with a vision to the earth were you obedient to the vision where did that vision come from that of John the Prophet had a man did it come from God or they come from men when God told John about baptism in this day did you what would you think about his instructions about baptism did it come from men or they come from God and they were supposed to be the builders amen and they're supposed to be building the tabernacle of God so the people of God could have a place for the Kakuma meet Jehovah they weren't about their father's business hey man why because people came to the temple and they weren't meeting Jehovah amen amen what where was that God was working with the Prophet John the Baptist and these builders were rejecting the vision that was given and so they were supposed to be the builders taking that which was given John the Baptist the vision and giving that to the people but they rejected the Prophet that was sent and when they reject for the Prophet they were sent they became foolish builders they wouldn't build a place where people could come and meet Jehovah amen let's keep going Jesus starts giving him a couple parables he gives him a parable of of the vineya of the two sons doing the will of the Father and then he gives them a parable of the the the man that planted a vineyard and I'm not gonna read all this but you remember the parable there there was a certain man that went and he planted a vineyard he hedged all around it he dug a winepress a man he built a tower and then he he rented this vineyard out just to certain men and then the man left and expected to come back and receive the fruit again a man so he's given this parable to the high priests amen he's trying to say he's basically he's telling him I put you in charge of my building I put you in charge of my building what did you do with my vineyard what did you do with my building I put you in charge and what did you do with it and then and then what he says that he sent his messengers to go claim the fruits and they killed him and they beat the messengers and sent them away right he bit the and versa verse 34 says and when the time of the fruit drew near he sent his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits of it what did he they took one of the servants they beat one they killed one they stoned another he's telling them this is what you've done to every prophet that's coming every prophet this come you've beat them you've killed them you've sent them away and you didn't listen to what they said amen and then verse 40 he says and then he says then they sent his own son and then they killed him and slew him a man then verse 40 Jesus asked the high priests a question he says when the Lord therefore of the vineyard cometh what will he do unto these husbandmen what will he do to these high priests he says they will miserably destroy those wicked men they're pronouncing judgment upon their own selves when the high priest said this they are pronouncing judgment unto themselves and then verse 42 look what Jesus says did you never read in the scripture the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner they were the builders amen they were supposed to be anointed to build the house of the Living God amen they had the vision of the Prophet John the Baptist they had everything given to them that everything like if they if they could have just entered into the calling of the Lord what they couldn't do it they could not enter into the calling they couldn't do it there was nothing in them to respond to the calling of the Lord when the Lord sent the message when the Lord sent the vision there was nothing in them to respond to the vision but I think what they do that they rejected the very stone that they were supposed to use to build a mint they didn't know the vision they didn't know the material they didn't know the profit they didn't know therefore they couldn't do what builders are supposed to do amen how many remembers the we spoke while back about the the ceremony of the Feast of the Tabernacles we're doing the when the during the Feast of the Tabernacles the the priesthood the Feast of Tabernacles was supposed to be done with extreme exceeding great joy during the entire ceremony you're you're you're commanded to be dancing and singing and rejoicing during the entire ceremony and in the Feast of the Tabernacles was a ceremony where you rejoiced over all of the fruits of the harvest amen you're now at the time of the harvest has come you're at the end of all feasts amen you're at the end of all things God has provided all the year long he's given you everything you had need enough and as soon as you realize all the fruits of the field and everything's coming to fruition you're supposed to have great joy amen great joy and singing and dancing amen and as they would as they would go and they would begin to praise God for the rain that gave them the harvest throughout all the land amen so they would so they would stay up on Mount Zion and and they would march down to the very base of Mount Zion and they would sing and dance as they go and then they go down to the base of Mount Zion and they take pictures of water and they would and they had filled up with water at the Sprint at the spring there at the base of the mountain amen and the only way that there would be a spring of water there is as if it had rained enough in the year that Mount Zion had filled up with water they would overflow and the pressure would create a little spring at the bottom amen and the spring it was spring up as a little well at the bottom of Mount Zion and they would go and they'd grab a jar of that water and they would march back up the hill singing and rejoicing singing and rejoicing and they'd get up and then and they'd get into the temple and they would pour out that water every day of the feast once a day amen then and then on the last day of the feast they would go and they would get seven jugs of water and pour out seven jugs of water on the top of Mount Zion showing the size of water that would fall down from heaven go into the dirt bring up the fruits and then return back and come again amen a constant refreshing of the water of the Holy Ghost and they would cut in there and do it while they're singing and rejoicing Jesus was watching this ceremony in John 7:37 amen let's go back I read this a few months ago but I want to read it again as Jesus was watching this ceremony he gets a little excited on the last day amen John 7:37 he says in the last day that great day of the feast this would be the day that they hadn't pour all the jugs of water Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this he spake he of the Spirit that they which were which they would have believed on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified oh my he's saying the time has changed the building is changing from this natural Mal's ioan but it's changing to me this out of this body shall flow rivers of living water amen and whosoever comes and drinks of me he'll be filled with the Holy Ghost amen and then out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water my Amen that's what Jesus spoke of himself but you know that promise is now transferring to what to what who is now the builders we are now the builders we are called to build a house of the Living God amen a place where out of our belly shall flow rivers of living water amen let's turn over to Acts chapter three remember Jesus went into the temple he healed the sick and then once he healed into the flame then the sick they went and he began to talk to him and begin to express to him about what the builders acts chapter 4 will start with verse 3 there were chapter 3 verse 1 it says now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer being the ninth hour and a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried whom they lay daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful task alms of them that entered into the temple what I love about this story is you know this man was there when Jesus was there he had been lame long enough that he was there when Jesus came into the temple but Jesus had not healed him yet amen but now Jesus is going to still heal this man don't think that was just Peter and John the healed them Jesus was still gonna heal this man he didn't heal me oh he's there physically in the body he waited till he was there in Peter and John Jesus still healed this man don't ever get that in your mind there's Peter and John they healed him it was Jesus Christ inside Peter and John but Jesus had left him for this very hour amen when and when this man saw Peter and John going to the temple he asked them for some alms and what verse 6 Peter then Peter said unto this this beggar this lame man he says silver and gold have I none but such as I have give I thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk all he had he gave I have oh I do have this sword Jesus a man what are we seeing let us express what are we seeing as we got up here amen the less talked about his name the more we talk my letters expressing let's praise his name let's praise him in the midst of all people let's tell the people what he is done for us amen and he lifts him up by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength and he and he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising God now think about it he is now fulfilling the the Feast of the Tabernacles amen he's rejoicing what that God has come down inside of man amen and the and he's leaping and rejoicing because what God has done amen it wasn't or just a religious ceremony to him he had actually experienced this water why because out of the out of John Peter and John's belly was flowing rivers of living water the Holy Ghost that reached out his hand their hands and was soon as he grabbed that hand the Holy Ghost strengthened the ankle bones that man's body he was experienced in the water and what'd he do he leaped up rejoicing it was the Feast of Tabernacles he's were joy seeing in the rain the Holy Ghost rain coming to the people amen you know God's people should do that God's people should rejoice over the things that God has done a many ought not to be a secret amongst the people that we live around the things that God has done for us a mass one thing I love to do is when I meet someone who is just a complete unbeliever to start giving them some testimonies of things that no natural man can do because they have nothing they can say against it we've seen God in action we know who he is the great Almighty God has come into our midst the same Holy Spirit has come into our midst with power we've written a book of acts behind us amen and we know who we serve we know who we are serving amen and he's the same yesterday today and forever let no man trouble me amen because I've seen Jesus Christ in action I know who then howl ooh yeah if you're if you are experienced I've I've seen the looks on their faces when you tell an atheist about the miracles of the Living God it's a amazing thing why because they have a chance an opportunity to see something they have a chance to become the call if they could just walk in it could just be something inside of them to rise it up and accept that and say maybe there is a God in heaven amen it's a blessing Saints to have a book of Acts written after you and all true Christians are called to be in that number that has them amen amen amen so Peter and John as they as this man went leaping walking into the temple everyone began to recognize him and they saw that he was healed amen and Peter when he sees every way marveling at this in verse 12 he says ye men of Israel why do you marvel at this why do you look so earnestly upon us as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk and he says it was the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob the same one that she that hath glorified His Son Jesus whom you delivered and denied him in the presence of Pilate amen hosanna he says and you killed the Prince of life amen whom God has raised from the dead verse 15 whereof we are witnesses they become witnesses of the one that was dying he meant and in his name through and and his name through faith in his name have made this man strong whom you see and know yea the faith which is by him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of all the faith which is by Jesus Christ has given this this poor beggar healing in the presence of everyone hi and then what when they get done preaching that sermon what happens the builders come to him verse chapter 4 verse 1 and they spake unto the people the priests the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them being grieved that they taught the people and preached through Jesus the resurrection of the Dead and they laid hands on them and put them in prison till the next day remember what Jesus did Jesus went to the temple he healed them and he was teaching and he came back the next day now Peter and John are doing the exact same thing they come into the temple if someone gets healed and they're preached he is and they come back the next day amen and then it came to pass verse 5 chapter 4 verse 5 on the morrow that their rulers are the elders and the scribes and Anna's the high priests sons ke Ephesus and John and Alexandra and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest were gathered together at Jerusalem God brought them all together for a witness amen sometimes God will choose you now judgment must come on this world this world must be judged and God will choose you to be a witness against those that are to be judged amen they you by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ when the book of Acts has written behind you and you bear witness of that amen you become a judge to the world Amen why because they would not receive the vision amen verse 7 the council asks and when they had set them in the myths they asked by what power or by what name have you done this and it just amazes me the motives that they had for asking that because they're the motive that they had wasn't so that they could find out and serve Him and so they could punish them and put them in jail and then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said unto them ye rulers are the people in elders of Israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done to them potent man by what means he has made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified whom God has raised from the dead even by him to this does this man stand here before you whole and the next verse this is a stone which was set at nought of you builders which has become the head of the corner corner amen they're still expressing talking about this stone Amen why because they had a responsibility to build the house of God in their day every generation is given a responsibility to uphold the house of God in their generation every generation is given a responsibility to provide a habitation for the Holy Ghost on the earth constantly throughout history generation after generation from Adam to Enoch to Noah to Abraham amen to the churn of Israel to Moses to through all the kings and the prophets to the Lord Jesus Christ to the disciples to every church age messenger aiming on down to this day every generation someone the people have been given a responsibility to provide a dwelling place for the Holy Ghost every generation and now that responsibility has come to you the called amen you are the builders of this day what house will you build it amen every will single one of us has a responsibility to provide a place for the Holy Ghost to dwell a man but how do you do it how do you build this temple how do you how do we do it how do we lay our hands to the work Amen how do we where do we get the material amen where do we get the vision where do we get the blueprints how do we find about this where who is the Prophet for this day what do we do with this this great responsibility has come to us what do we do God has called us what do we do amen we've been given a vision God has sent a blueprint to a prophet in this day remember when they when they came to Jesus how do you do this by what authority do this he says I also will ask you a question who is the Prophet for your day John the Baptist did you listen to him yes or no was his vision did it come from man or did it come from God mine he pointed him back to the Prophet Jesus Christ referred back to the Prophet John the Baptist for their day did you listen to the prophets message did you become obedient to the prophets baptism my think about it Jesus Christ Himself they come to come to the Son of God and he refers back to the baptism preached by the prophet and the Prophet rnai says repent go look at he said go look at acts 2 36 through 38 go look at it examine it G a brother Brant said look at it examine you must become first if you even want to have the first step along this road is repent and then the next step be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ if you don't walk down that road then you don't even have a thought coming mine you want to be a builder but you've rejected the message of the Prophet you want to call yourself one that is here to build a habitation for the Holy Ghost on the earth but you won't listen to what the Prophet said then you'll be judged amen amen you have to submit yourselves to the vision that's what they did back in Moses day those men had to submit themselves to the vision of Moses and receive the material that was given to him and this day the material is given to us is the body of the Lord Jesus Christ and we have to be baptized into that body a man we have to repent and be covered by the blood of that body amen he was the freewill offering that was given by God our Father amen and the vision or the prophets said submit yourselves to that and then you can come and build the tabernacle of the Living God's will in place then you can be the living tabernacle of the Living God's dwelling place my let's enclose in here let's turn over to first Corinthians three first Corinthians three verse ten first nine verse nine it says for we are laborers together with God but we're called we are the ones that were given the wisdom you can't labor unless you have wisdom Amen we are called to have that wisdom and to labor together with God and if you don't do that then you aren't about your father's business amen for we are laborers together with God ye are God's husbandry ye are God's building according to the grace of God which is given to me as a wise masterbuilder I have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon but let every man take heed how he built a theropod for other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid which is Jesus Christ amen everyone has a responsibility to come upon this way take heed be careful how you built why because you will be judged how you built verse 12 it says now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire amen and the and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort of this amen every single one of us everything that we do will be tried by fire whether you acted according to the wisdom of the Holy Ghost or if you acted according to your own thoughts your own wisdom what works did you do when you did on the earth did you act according to your own thinking or did you use the wisdom of the Holy Ghost that was given to you to build a habitation for the Holy Ghost amen amen and last scripture does turn of first Peter to all of us are given a responsibility to build the house of the living gun first Peter chapter 2 verse 4 if so be he have tasted that the Lord is gracious how many has tasted that the Lord is gracious amen to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men the stone was rejected but chosen of God and most precious ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ the work is now in your hands you aren't working together with God you are God's husbandry you are the builders what house will you build for him amen are you satisfied with the house that you have built for the Lord are you ready for the day of judgment amen are you ready to to go and and explain the house that you have built to the Lord right now if you were to go up to heaven and stand before the throne of Lord Jesus Christ are you ready to - to - to show the house that you've built the Lord those eyes a fire when they look upon it what will happen to it will it be will it be a house at those eyes of fire recognise if those eye is a fire recognize yes this is the house that I ordained this is the house it will withstand but those eye is a fire if they look upon and inside that house is built something do you try to build up your own life out of your own wisdom I have your own thinking if you rejected the vision Amy if you rejected the word of the Prophet that God sent if you rejected this if you rejected that then those eyes of fire will burn away that house that you have built and you'll be left standing holding nothing why because you rejected the word that was given to you you are called to build the house the dwelling play for the Holy Ghost on the earth you were called to build the temple of God but you would not and what you go away was weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth why because they would not build the house of God even though the material was given amen even though the message was given though the vision was made plain but you didn't run when the vision was come and then you were brought to judgment day to explain the house that you built for the dwelling place of the Holy Ghost amen every single one of us will have to explain the house we built why because now in this day we are the builders and we've been given the wisdom we've been given the vision we've been given the materials but take heed how you build your house we build it day by day day by day you have to actually put your hands to the work a man that man back there in Exodus that was called by John by Jove himself see I have named him I have called him by name and I've given him wisdom once he realized who he was then he had to act upon it then he had to act upon it it didn't all happen at once he had to act upon what he was given amen once you realize that you are the call and you have to act upon it Amen but God has given it to you amen God is if you once feel God's calling upon you that gives you permission to come before him in prayer and ask for the wisdom to build the house of God it gives you permission to those things you say oh I don't know how to do this I don't know how to do that God has given you permission to walk forward in his gospel let no man trouble me I've seen the vision as I'm a plane everything has been given me in heaven and earth everything I have need of all power and heavenly earth has been given to me and is behind me to make sure that I fulfill his purpose says when you're brought before the council so you're brought before the kings of the earth to explain the things that you have done don't prepare in advance the words but it'll be given to you in that hour to explain yourself to be given to you the whole Lagos will speak for you in that hour don't you fear to go anywhere or do anything because never-failing presence of the Lord Jesus Christ will be with you everywhere you go but you have to be you have to know what the vision of your hour is I know what the vision of your day is amen John the Baptist he came with the message of baptism they had to come and submit themselves and repent and be baptized now was the vision in our day come the the vision comes repent be baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ go back to the faith of the father's have a book of Acts written behind the church and have the Holy Ghost working in your day men being called to build that kind of a house but you have to actually put your hands to the work and do it otherwise you'll be judged we're not working according to the vision amen let's just stand amen God has made the vision plain walking in it amen Heavenly Father I just want to thank you Lord for the message tonight laura's you have made us why is Builders Lord you've given us the wisdom you've given us the calling Lord let's go forth and faithfulness Lord to do to receive everything that the Holy Ghost has called us to do and to reject everything that our flesh calls us to do Lord so when the end comes Lord there that our that our faith will not be in the things of flesh Lord but our thing or our trust will be in the things that the Holy Spirit asked us to do that we walked according to the spirit and not according to the flesh yeah that's how we receive life according to Paul by not by rejecting the things of the carnal nature and receiving the walk of the Holy Ghost Lord let's be faithful to that in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Laura femaie here under the sound of my voice Lourdes has been dilatory Lord has not been obedient to the vision Lord has not been obedient to the when the visions may plain I pray you give them a path to repentance Lord that they could get back on the path Lord to find the vision of their day and to walk in it to receive the wisdom of the Holy Ghost or that they would not go into the judgement father let it let it be into us Lord according to your word we stand like Mary father when the vision of her day came she said let it be unto me Lord according to you I work and lore well here we are Lord the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ let it be unto us Lord according to your word and lo we might go into all nations Lord preaching the gospel why because we can go to the to the temples and Tabernacles and high places of this day preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ healing the sick raising the dead the lame will walk the blind will see because the power of the Holy Ghost is inside of us and we thank you for our Lord no man trouble me for we bear in our body the marks of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord let us go forth Lord and your name and your power and your wisdom proclaiming the works of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask for it you to give the evidence of it in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen who believes it's possible a man you believe it's possible do you believe that you can do it do you believe you can actually build a habitation for the Holy Ghost on this earth that you can have a book of acts written behind you now when you are brought for kings and and the judges of this day the denominations of this day that you can give that the Holy Ghost will answer for you that when you speak when your mouth opens that out of your mouth will come the Oracles of Christ the words of Lord Jesus Christ do you believe that'll happen Amen with your the called filt the Holy Ghost it'll happen why it's a promise a man I just happened to me the other day someone was calling me out for for for the things that I believed saying you believe this you believe that and they had it all wrong

did God did my God is able he will answer for you and whether it be a matter of healing you meet someone that needs to be saved someone needs to be delivered someone's possessed of a devil I don't care if they're snarling whatever they're doing don't don't don't even take a matter into your own thought but just trust in the Lord we're not called to be plumbers we're not called to be
