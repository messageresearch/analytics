[51:26] to break
[51:28] through yeah because most of the time
[51:31] preaching is not about reading and
[51:34] ques it's like a
[51:37] relationship yeah
[51:40] friendship
[51:42] connection that's why sometimes I can
[51:43] make my
[51:46] notes and I can be off notes and until
[51:48] we
[51:49] finish yeah don't just
[51:52] stick but sometimes when they so they
[51:55] call you
[51:57] you feel
[51:58] like something is burning in your heart
[52:02] you start with that one is in your heart
[52:04] but always be very attentive to the
[52:08] spirit when you start to take me to the
[52:12] right I just follow the
[52:15] flow and and we continue God bless you
[52:19] richly you can stand up we pray already
[52:22] you can read the scripture
[52:27] we pray already
[52:31] okay let us read in
[52:35] ecclesiast
[52:48] 12 chapter 12 verse 13 and 14
[53:03] okay I'm reading let us hear the
[53:06] conclusion of the whole Mar fear God and
[53:10] keep his commandment for this is the
[53:13] whole duty of man
[53:17] [Music]
[53:32] H for God shall bring every word in into
[53:36] judgment with every secret thing whether
[53:39] it be good or whether it be
[53:49] evil
[53:51] oh I'm lost it's okay okay maybe sit
[53:56] yeah God bless you
[53:59] richly so
[54:01] uh my SM out this morning
[54:06] is but I told you already most of the
[54:10] time I don't stick on my
[54:12] not I'm not that's not
[54:16] sticker but this these things it's it's
[54:19] a burning in my
[54:21] heart uh for a certain
[54:25] time uh uh I was just meditating upon
[54:28] the
[54:30] word for the
[54:34] elders they they they received the
[54:38] message when we were very
[54:41] young some they were not yet
[54:45] born
[54:47] oh
[54:48] sometimes I S to realize
[54:53] that
[54:55] sometimes why
[54:57] somebody can stay so so long in the
[55:03] message then there's no
[55:07] change it start to bothering me so
[55:12] much some the ERS 40 years 30
[55:17] something some young young people I can
[55:20] understand
[55:21] sometimes yeah they just come you know
[55:24] they hot hot you know but Elders at
[55:27] least when you stay long under the
[55:32] atmosphere of the
[55:35] word what what change must
[55:39] come even if a hand when he just want
[55:43] the the cheeks to come
[55:48] up hand hand cheeks to come
[55:52] up is I just sleep on the legs for the
[55:55] cheeks
[56:01] [Music]
[56:07] he he need a certain
[56:11] atmosphere and as long as those eggs is
[56:15] under
[56:18] atmosphere the life will come
[56:23] up so I I was just crying
[56:27] and
[56:29] praying I just tried to see how brother
[56:32] Bram start the
[56:36] ministry and I tried to check what was a
[56:39] burden in
[56:44] brother didn't have 3,000 4,000 Church
[56:49] Believers in this
[56:52] church and if you notice the ministry of
[56:55] babam was very successful out of United
[57:01] States he talk about 30,000 thousand
[57:09] overse but here and the Pentecost Church
[57:13] they start to use his
[57:17] ministry just to feed their
[57:20] churches
[57:23] Miracles as Believers we can't run for
[57:27] the
[57:30] Miracles now some people they've been
[57:32] deceived because of they've got gift
[57:38] of you can't measure a preacher about
[57:40] the gift of
[57:43] healing you measure a preacher by the by
[57:46] the the word of
[57:49] God
[57:51] am when you have a gift of healing 100
[57:54] can get healed 300 but
[57:58] if if there is no
[58:01] life that's there is
[58:04] confusion but this message came to bring
[58:08] life if there is no life we
[58:14] question what make me to study so much
[58:17] I'm an evangelist but you bear with me a
[58:19] little bit teach a little
[58:24] bit God send me to uh the job I'm doing
[58:30] now those are successful people in what
[58:33] we are doing
[58:37] today they succeed by using only
[58:40] principle of your God put upon the
[58:47] Earth and you supposed to be better than
[58:51] them because you is the father your God
[58:55] your
[58:56] father create the
[58:58] universe put
[59:00] principle come on now clap the hand for
[59:03] the
[59:06] Lord so that's what I I I was
[59:12] confused someone was a
[59:16] smoker
[59:18] proud all those stuff but only using the
[59:21] principle and he changed
[59:26] he become a better
[59:28] person
[59:31] honest but when you enter in the
[59:33] Assembly of the
[59:35] message we don't know who to trust
[59:41] today it can jump scream good nice but
[59:46] put the money on the
[59:49] table the eyes become
[59:53] red hey brother is not your mind
[59:57] it's not your
[59:59] money I know I'm going to give
[1:00:08] back so it start to eing
[1:00:11] me I start to study the word and
[1:00:16] pray so I realized
[1:00:20] that there is one thing a big thing
[1:00:24] missing in many
[1:00:29] assemblies you know let us let us not
[1:00:32] first point to the holy
[1:00:34] spirit because Holy Spirit become like a
[1:00:40] song it become like a song yes and
[1:00:44] preacher when you said you don't have
[1:00:47] the Holy Spirit you are not you can
[1:00:50] be let's speak about the
[1:00:53] seal because there is baptism in the
[1:00:55] seal
[1:00:57] yeah the same genuine Holy
[1:01:01] Spirit it can baptize you around in your
[1:01:04] spirit yeah and we are talking about the
[1:01:07] same genuine but in the soul that's way
[1:01:09] things
[1:01:12] change yeah when you said uh brother you
[1:01:15] need the baptism of the Holy Spirit I'm
[1:01:18] going to brother
[1:01:21] me I'm a preacher don't play with me and
[1:01:24] espe preacher will very proud
[1:01:28] is us we are sending the people in the
[1:01:36] bush it's us because us we have a
[1:01:40] microphone and you have only speaker you
[1:01:42] can't
[1:01:46] ask there I can when we give me two
[1:01:49] hours all whatever one hour I'm going to
[1:01:52] just say it no one going to answer me
[1:01:53] there
[1:01:59] so that's why sometimes sometimes a lot
[1:02:01] of peoplee they don't like
[1:02:04] me I preach against us if you are not
[1:02:09] okay ah we we don't protect there
[1:02:13] everybody we must we must receive the
[1:02:16] spirit the soul change Pig nature to be
[1:02:18] a
[1:02:23] lamb that's about the message you will
[1:02:26] never understand this message until the
[1:02:28] genuine Holy Spirit enter in your
[1:02:35] soul is not about explaining and
[1:02:38] memorizing and the quotations and
[1:02:41] quotations people they start to make a
[1:02:43] quotation they fighting one is like is
[1:02:46] fighting
[1:02:52] against my
[1:02:54] attitude even the one who believe Bram
[1:03:00] God if he just read brother
[1:03:04] Bram and I'm reading also in my side
[1:03:07] because he must not
[1:03:09] drop that quotation okay me also I found
[1:03:12] it let us read
[1:03:15] brother and it's okay I say Amen
[1:03:20] first I swallow first it's brother
[1:03:23] Bram and I I turn to
[1:03:26] him you don't
[1:03:30] understand now when you you start to
[1:03:34] reject already the fight you you you
[1:03:37] mess up the
[1:03:41] atmosphere you will never change a Bram
[1:03:44] God to believe something else is a
[1:03:47] strong
[1:03:54] demon they're very
[1:04:01] excited I said
[1:04:04] brother is a prophet I
[1:04:07] love everything he
[1:04:10] said before he finish a
[1:04:13] sentence I say
[1:04:19] amen
[1:04:21] amen that's the I believe the prophet
[1:04:26] that's why when they say is God you is
[1:04:29] Christ when they you are
[1:04:33] Christ he didn't say you are
[1:04:37] wrong they are not far away they were
[1:04:39] very
[1:04:42] close why because you can't say no
[1:04:45] because because to see God you have to
[1:04:49] see God in the
[1:04:52] man if you miss God in the man
[1:04:57] you also you can't have
[1:05:03] God God that's why
[1:05:06] life it's it's from the body to the
[1:05:12] body that's why God sent philli he
[1:05:15] didn't send the
[1:05:18] angel you need a body
[1:05:21] [Applause]

[1:06:29] it he didn't know what he
[1:06:33] had but he had it and I I want somebody
[1:06:37] to tell me tonight what electricity
[1:06:42] is we're just talking about electricity
[1:06:45] this
[1:06:46] morning they don't know yet what
[1:06:50] is but we got it
[1:06:58] that's right there is no man knows what
[1:07:00] electricity
[1:07:04] is they can Hest it make it
[1:07:11] light make it
[1:07:13] burn make it
[1:07:16] act it's generated by
[1:07:24] generators gener okay two
[1:07:30] pieces running together like
[1:07:33] that it's produced that and all they
[1:07:37] know it will give light and it's got
[1:07:41] power in
[1:07:46] it I love the
[1:07:49] prophet when the prophet start to speak
[1:07:51] about electricity is more than
[1:07:56] you know and they explained that he said
[1:07:59] they don't know and them they thought
[1:08:02] they
[1:08:04] know he said they don't have
[1:08:06] electricity but they know how to to make
[1:08:09] it
[1:08:13] happen and that's like the spirit of
[1:08:17] God you get one
[1:08:20] piece is you and the other piece is God
[1:08:25] yes hallelujah hallelujah and get them
[1:08:28] running around
[1:08:31] together like that it will go something
[1:08:36] for
[1:08:37] you that's right it will give light to
[1:08:41] give power you don't know what it is and
[1:08:46] never will know what it
[1:08:49] is but you know when you got
[1:08:53] it that's one thing being
[1:08:56] sure and it's for
[1:08:58] you it's
[1:09:00] yours the

[1:09:29] it two
[1:09:31] pieces you know butam was trying to
[1:09:35] correct the
[1:09:37] science they can give some words but a
[1:09:39] certain level they can't be like us as
[1:09:42] we are very
[1:09:48] high I discover
[1:09:52] something God is in the physics
[1:09:56] God is the
[1:09:57] nature God is in the
[1:09:59] color God is in the
[1:10:02] number for the Lord amen
[1:10:05] [Applause]
[1:10:09] amen you can you can take two
[1:10:12] stones you just uh uh brush
[1:10:17] them even there is it's
[1:10:21] raining you going to get the fire
[1:10:25] hallelujah hallelujah but they can't
[1:10:28] explain
[1:10:30] why praise the
[1:10:32] Lord yeah just bear with me it's I don't
[1:10:35] know I don't know I can drop this I
[1:10:38] don't know I don't know I'll try it's a
[1:10:40] long teaching but pick up pick up we see
[1:10:43] how God going to help
[1:10:49] us this called electromagnetic
[1:10:55] there cannot be magnetism without there
[1:10:58] being
[1:11:04] electricity these two Force work
[1:11:08] together because magnetism work with
[1:11:12] electricity this is the second Force
[1:11:15] discover when they discover the force of
[1:11:21] gravity and people didn't understand
[1:11:24] that in gravity there was the magnetic
[1:11:28] and electron I love
[1:11:34] this praise the Lord hallelujah there
[1:11:37] are two forces in force
[1:11:40] gravity there is strong
[1:11:43] force and a weak
[1:11:45] Force strong force act as a
[1:11:52] glue to put things together
[1:11:56] which for this one causes this to break
[1:11:59] down into
[1:12:08] [Music]
[1:12:10] radioactivity now Albert inin that's why
[1:12:14] it's
[1:12:16] soting who can correct
[1:12:20] alberstein hallelujah hallelujah there
[1:12:23] he was trying to find a formula to put
[1:12:28] together but butam said science they are
[1:12:32] going in the wrong
[1:12:35] way praise the
[1:12:37] Lord because one is in one another this
[1:12:40] one is in this one in this
[1:12:44] one until today they still searching
[1:12:47] they never found it until they recognize
[1:12:50] the one who created
[1:12:55] the
[1:12:58] Lord and do you know
[1:13:03] that what produce the
[1:13:07] electricity let us go is is a
[1:13:11] Dynamo yeah D the
[1:13:14] Dynam
[1:13:15] correct a dyn okay let us go the
[1:13:23] vision Africa
[1:13:25] that's the day to give
[1:13:31] them
[1:13:36] 53 someone
[1:13:38] okay okay then he went away
[1:13:43] again I started rejoicing
[1:13:46] there and was a real
[1:13:49] happy and just
[1:13:51] then here he he come again and the take
[1:13:58] away listen close
[1:14:02] now have your paper
[1:14:07] [Music]
[1:14:09] ready but when he comes this
[1:14:12] time he set me down in the dean
[1:14:19] meeting geographically Geographic I was
[1:14:22] looking just the way the de was looking
[1:14:28] [Music]
[1:14:36] South I was in the in the
[1:14:39] north and there was a great Duran
[1:14:44] meeting just the same
[1:14:47] meeting and I noticed that the meeting
[1:14:50] begin to turn blue
[1:14:55] I stop first there this blue is not a
[1:14:58] blue
[1:15:01] color I don't know put it it start to
[1:15:04] get so big you
[1:15:07] know the prayer start to move fire
[1:15:10] dancing it start to take another
[1:15:15] level and that's why I I stopped there
[1:15:17] because this is it's turning
[1:15:21] blue it's not the blue
[1:15:23] color praise the Lord raise up off the
[1:15:28] ground the people and FedEd away toward
[1:15:32] the
[1:15:34] west now I I talk
[1:15:37] slow now so the people can get
[1:15:40] it and is is is written is is written
[1:15:46] faded toward the worst and the just then
[1:15:49] I look in the front of me again this
[1:15:52] this way
[1:15:56] it was toward the
[1:16:00] South and there was
[1:16:03] aing greater than the other one
[1:16:09] was and there there was beautiful
[1:16:16] people men and the
[1:16:18] women with their hand
[1:16:21] up praising God and I said
[1:16:26] are all
[1:16:28] white
[1:16:31] people I stopped there but those people
[1:16:33] they were so beautiful and handsome and
[1:16:36] he asked they all
[1:16:40] white and I look at and I see the
[1:16:46] Africans the Great Dark race standing in
[1:16:51] there and just then
[1:16:54] I heard something
[1:16:57] going just making a real humming
[1:17:03] noise like a
[1:17:05] Dy running for the
[1:17:14] Lord so you know
[1:17:17] what don't miss when this this message
[1:17:22] is taking a corner or is taking a left
[1:17:25] or
[1:17:27] right drop what you are
[1:17:31] thinking it's not what you think is what
[1:17:34] God is
[1:17:37] doing so God got his own way of doing
[1:17:41] things butam saw himself in the
[1:17:45] South and he said that
[1:17:48] Maring is is a bigger than a
[1:17:52] death and the noise what a d
[1:17:57] praise the Lord so you know as we are
[1:18:01] privileged because we have a
[1:18:05] prophet and the prophet is clear
[1:18:09] it God couldn't take off
[1:18:13] Bram if the Big Dam was not
[1:18:17] on I'm going there we're going
[1:18:20] slowly I I'll jump but to drop something
[1:18:25] because the D produce the
[1:18:29] electricity and the way in the
[1:18:33] miring praise the Lord you know when
[1:18:36] Samson lost
[1:18:38] eyes they cut his hair it's like there
[1:18:41] is no prophet in the
[1:18:45] camp and the eyes represent a prophet
[1:18:49] and the body is a church when there is
[1:18:51] no Prophet people they just trying
[1:18:54] can read the same
[1:18:56] Bible but they don't
[1:18:59] understand the difference between this
[1:19:01] Pentecostal denomination because as we
[1:19:03] have a prophet
[1:19:08] will we are sitting here it's because we
[1:19:13] have a William
[1:19:16] Mar I love to say that because there's
[1:19:19] some people that don't want to hear that
[1:19:23] name that's why why they going to St in
[1:19:25] the
[1:19:31] sins you have to recognize your time and
[1:19:34] your
[1:19:36] Prophet stand at your position Jesus at
[1:19:40] his
[1:19:41] position then God will come God will
[1:19:43] never work out of his Prophet the MTH of
[1:19:47] God is Willam
[1:19:51] Mar we are going to stand this message
[1:19:54] and
