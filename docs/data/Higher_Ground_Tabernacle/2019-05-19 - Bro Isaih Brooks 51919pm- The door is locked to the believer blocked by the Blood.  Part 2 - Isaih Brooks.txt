yonder when the roll is called up yonder when the roll it's called up yonder when the roll is called up yonder after lettuce lay before the master from the dawn till Setting Sun let us talk of all this wondrous love and care then when all of life is over and our work on earth is done and the roll is called up yonder I'll be there when the roll is called up yonder I'll be there [Music] is called up yonder when the roll is called nothing to have nothing to hide amen well there's seven of us in this place am i counting right yep got me that's a good number Lord as we stand we're just going to get right into the word of the Lord yeah I appreciate what you did today brother Vincent I went home and I told my wife about that I just to love their sister because a lot of times you know I'm up here preaching and I don't see something sometimes I see you sometimes I don't so I appreciate when they're with so you know god is good to us and we love Lord I was expecting my wife to come but evidently I've misunderstood but with greats leaving as well it's really uh she's like a daughter to us when she came she just fell right in mind my daughter said they were very close to the hurry so anyway as we stand let us turn to Ephesians two second chapter our brother Frank did an excellent job today and I appreciated that kept right in there didn't didn't uh there was no problems at all so I appreciate he knows he's done it once now he's got to do it again so appreciate that Ephesians the second chapter will begin at the fourth verse III you know sometimes as a preacher you want to preach it like you get it flesh gets it away sometime you know it just seemed like the revelation of the Spirit can't seem to breathe brought out by the way of the tongue you know what I'm saying you see in things you understanding things but the the language barrier it's really difficult you can't explain it but that's how it was this morning I was really trying to really get to people to see how perfect God's redemption plan is it's flawless it's perfect it's flawless it's in it and it's nothing it can make it better you know like that Psalms 23 they've tried to perfect it but Psalm 2023 you know how can you change it right so anyway God is God is good to us Ephesians 2 and 4 something else beginning at the fourth verse but God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins have quickened us together with Christ by grace ye are saved and have raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places scuse me Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding and riches exceeding riches of His grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by grace ye are saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is a gift of God not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God have for or before ordained that we should walk in them so you can understand and we do understand that we only walk in a good way because God ordained it to be so let's pray father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord without you where would we be I pray tonight that you bless the service blessed to hear of the word and your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated so we started out we talked about the door is locked by locked is locked to the believer and we're working with hell the door and understand that the the gate is locked to the unbeliever and the make-believe that is heaven storm and God has the keys of death hell and the grave you know I they stay I guess this is a saying of a church that Peter has the key but Peter has the keys and the key was to salvation and we know that the key and what he he taught us and that was repentance and being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sin that opens the door for you right so you and I know that whatever God has laid out in the scriptures it will come to pass God will prove to all men his word is right and when we look that's why I brought the scripture that took it out of Psalm 16 where I'll not leave my soul in hell I won't see you know and Andy in God brings and shows us by God's grace amen how that same scripture is reported in the book of Acts when Peter began to preach the first message showing that Jesus Christ resurrection was of something that wasn't scriptural but it was written in the Psalms according to David and understand it came to pass uh just like Noah when he was preaching 120 years it may have taken a long time before rain but it rained it actually came to pass and everything that God has spoken will come to pass his purpose will be accomplished now you you look at us and and and compare ourselves and when I look in the Bible I think to myself I mean this generation that we're living in is definitely the weakest of all generations because the Bible says so and it's evident the the Bible tells us that this generation would be weaker and wiser but but at the same time look at us we were so vulnerable I think about my myself when I like our brother was talking brother Vincent was talking about a real farmer you know his hands feel like gravel almost I forgot what the phrase he but I have I have taken the opportunity to shake men from foreign countries and it would have shake their hands I'd get embarrassed because mine feels so soft compared to this but they have labored for those hands you don't I mean those hands are their trophies because they have labored to get those kind of hands you know what I'm saying and to be honest with you if I had a choice to have this softness or that hardness give me the hard hands I like that but you know you look at these things and but God chose me to be in this and he knew the kind of man I would be now he knows you and I and and because it's so small that the group is I won't take my time tonight I want us to realize by God's grace that nothing can alter your salvation not even you if God has chosen and elected you to be bride you can't do one thing against that because you didn't choose him he chose you and the thing that I love about God and you've heard me say this so many times in the past God loves to to make something out of a mess he loves to see things in chaos to show his ability to show that he can he can bring light in structure to something that is chaotic and out of fall he started out that way and God loves it people think well I have sinned too much I've done too much wicked God loves that kind he knows how to straighten that out and make me and marvel at the product that's our God he is because he's dealing with we were working with divine love we work with a love that passes all understanding we can't understand that all I know is I crave for it I thirst for it I so desired that kind of love amen they can love the unlovable and love the enemy and you know I just I just somehow I I think oh this is this is amazing to me that God can can take this love that he have and he can actually feed and clothe those who hate him and blaspheme his name and all that and he he doesn't without any reservation and he takes a man like you and me a you and I and then he takes us in knowing we gonna make mistakes after he saves us huh he knows every little every little falter every failure that we have in this life it may come to us as a surprise but God knew when he called you exactly what you're going to do thereafter he's never surprised by our actions and yet he loves us and to secure his love for us he makes sure we get the Holy Ghost come on somebody all right look at this the Bible said that Jacob wrestled with an angel Jacob Amen was a shyster he you know how we say in the world he terms he got over on his brother he stole his brothers birthright and God honoring it oh I got that God knew listen listen my kind would do whatever's necessary to do to get me you understand me that's how Jake Jacob did whatever was necessary I feel this pull I know this call and whatever it takes I'm going to get that huh oh you say well what what what you know we fail to see just how God God's people do and God's people act you take the the sister who does that deceive Judah Tamar right here was Tamar and she wanted that seed she wanted that she wanted to be really in the family and just being married to to Judah son wasn't good enough she wanted to produce Judah you understand me because his son would produce Judas seed because it was from the same tree and so she she couldn't she couldn't get that and her sir her husband died and y'all know the story and she pretended to be a prostitute just to get Judah to lay with her that's right brother whatever it takes I see the promise in the book it's mine and whatever it takes for this to come to pass in my life this is what I'm going to do right it doesn't matter what other people think about it and she something drove her now watch this cuz see if God was behind all of this the enemy may have done what he needed to do but when Tamar Amen who slept with Judah listen even he knew that God was the only one that could give life so when she slept with the serpent what she say God has I have received a son from the Lord she knew that even in her wrong action God allowed that seed to come to pass somebody help here cuz you must understand that even when it came to Tamar God allowed that seed to could be quickened in Thema twins the understand what I'm saying what was it fulfilling God's purpose a lot of times when you fulfilling God's purpose it may not even look right to the natural man and yet God is in it oh you take Ruth and how ha ha ha Naomi and her husband went down to Moab Moab was a place they should have never gone they were in a backslidden state and that's why so much so many bad things happened to them because they were in a backslidden state but then Ruth said listen I'm repenting everything he's told I'm going back home where my blessings are and when she went back to the Ruza what was she willing back for blessings and when she got there guess what God met her there oh come on somebody God allowed beau ass not to have a wife a rich man could have whatever Israelite woman he wanted but God kept him because there was a certain kind of woman he needed and she was in Moab and God had to bring her out of Moab to fulfill his purpose you understand me what I'm trying to say is your life may look like it's chaotic it may not be the luck is in the right place right now but it still to God's glory all things work together for the good of them that love God all who are called into it have faith in God he's gonna bring it out at the end you'll see it you'll look back and wonder how I got over that's exactly right he is the mastermind he knows what it takes amen to get you where he wants you to be is that right oh brother branham just taking a bus one day and guess what a medium is on the bus cuz here brother Brandon was down in his gift he didn't know what it was what it was all about and here is a meeting him on the bus tells him about the light above his head do you see that did you know there's a light do you know what that signifies did you know that you were born on the same day Jesus was born under the same sign and God did this as a memorial and he didn't even want to hear it and God took a which to tell him who he was Oh somebody help me here God uses whoever he wants to you it's so amazing me because God that's exactly right sometimes we want to put him in a box right but let me tell you something God you can't put him in a box God is a God of a more fair with that right God clothed himself as a donkey spoke to a donkey to obey them you better stop that nonsense yah hear me so God is a God of him all things God can use a man he can use a woman he can use a cloud that's right listen he was a pillar cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night and the Bible said that pillar of cloud never left why because that day it was a cloud but that same cloud turned into a fire hey somebody cloud is made out of water fire is made out of something else but it was all supernatural it wasn't to gods it was just a pillar cloud transformed itself into the pillar of fire then the pillow fights went went back to the pillar cloud Oh somebody help me here that's the way God works what's going to happen at the end of the day when we come to a place and the people find out that God was really behind the veil of brother Brooke oh you got it what I'm saying not brother Brookes he makes too many mistakes yes God was behind that veil people say wait a minute now how can God use Paul when he's a murderer Paul helped a lot of people you know Christian be killed I could name some of them don't know what I'm saying they were afraid of Paul and yet God took the same man put him among his disciples and told them loved him and guess what he gave him a higher office made him a prophet and so now these people who was afraid of Paul who was solved has to obey what Paul preaches humility making sure they were kept humble and that's the way God does it God don't always choose the people we think he ought to choose or use the ones that right you you heard the story here was you know uh Jesse had all those sons and he was a shame of David and David was the man that God had already chosen already anointed him y'all know what I'm say David nuke with God before the anointing oil the real anointing was on David he had a testimony I killed a lion I killed a bear his brothers were nowhere around with all that happened but God had used that a lot of times these are the testimonies that you have are done when most people are not around but they're given to you because they're coming a time when God will do something great in the front of the people but he wants you to keep humble with it he wants you to always remember who did it so you and I must understand nothing can break the blood the DNA of God hallelujah it never loses its power and we wouldn't have never known but God did something great in our day Moses was great Joshua was great all of the Old Testament Saints our prophets were great John the Baptist Jesus ed dared not live one that's greater than John but that was their whoo y'all said you said brother but you better be careful let me tell you something the seventh angel messenger was the greatest of all prophets outside of Jesus Christ it wasn't just a man he didn't choose to be the angel God chosen to be danger hallelujah Moses led the children of Israel out of the natural Egypt this messenger literally delivers us and brings us out of the spiritual Egypt and it was a mystery we call it Babylon the Great we always a part of it but God use an uneducated man by the name of William Branham to bring the most powerful message ever it unfolded unveiled listen Paul talk about this what I said earlier today Paul says listen I'm trying to tell you some things some great things are going to happen and and and I want you now so I took the scripture and I thought okay what was is and what now is and will always be in other words solid songs with Solomon says there is no new thing under the Sun here we got all of these you know electronical things and we say oh we soap to surpass the older men of old day we have no idea why because God got rid of all the evidence we don't know what all they had hello we don't know for the one thing we do know by a prophet was that they were able to harness the rain the laser in order to build a pyramid they were able to buy the laser beam lift blocks huge stones tons and stack them yeah we're just getting into the laser and we want to use the laser just to kill each other you understand me but they had that technology hello oh come on somebody people all the man to Titanic was a tide telling what the greatest ship ever built Noah built the greatest an old farmer who followed God's blueprint was the Titanic wouldn't wouldn't have made it through the flood but God's boat did he see that I'm trying to tell you listen if you stick with God you become the greatest you are militant because of God right nothing can break the blood chain the line is pure it cannot be broken and when Christ is in you you become him he becomes you hallelujah it is the devil that's keeping us down like this because we mentally we we in an age of reasoning and thinking and processing and God don't ask for that he said have faith just believe my word walk in it you don't have to process it God say do it just do it is that right William Branham throw up a rock he didn't say is that guy wonder what God want me to do what is that all about I would look pretty silly in front of these brother in know he threw the rock up and when he threw the rock up the whirlwind started what happened it blasted three crosses out of the mountain there I've seen it I was there amen and let me tell you something each one of those rocks that were blast out of that mountain were in pyramid shape hello and guess what it was then God other than him that judgment has has now struck the west coast hallelujah you know what it was it was like Moses when they wouldn't believe the three signs of Moses guess what happened Moses took some dust from the earth threw it up and fleas came it began to change everything around because they rejected the gospel and because America I rejected the gospel that the Lord came right down and burst through those rocks three crosses represented the three crosses on Calvary actually there was four when it comes to Judas I had one of those rocks but somebody whose claim to be a Christian took it yeah I was one of the few that was able to get a rock oh lord have mercy but nevertheless let's move on you and I must realize that God will use you if you allow him is that right brother Brahim said one man in his hand and a lot of time we think he's talking about himself now any one man God want to use every man that could literally wipe themselves out and let God come in that's all he needs one man one person just surrender that could he that one person amen could do some exploits listen the Bible tells us and he says now listen Jesus Christ was raised from the dead and then guess what all that died in him rose with him can you imagine one day we won't have to imagine because it's gonna happen to us it is our inheritance it is what God is gonna do for us you understand me hey come on it's your truth if the point is if people can't believe that God sent a prophet in this day they don't really believe Moses they don't think about the people in Moses they all think about the people in Jesus day here they had established churches there and here come Jesus born where a poor man foxes have whole bird have nests on a man have no place to live here and didn't born with a bad reputation that is mama committed fornication bad reputation and then God puts him right into Nineveh one of the most wickedness cities their walls that's why the disciple said Kenny any good thing come out of Nineveh y'all hear what I'm saying God put it there to be a stumbling block for all those intellectuals but he said then again my sheep hear is my voice see that's what I'm saying that's why the world can't see this that's why they can't be attracted to it because only the Sheep of God can hear his voice not just talk about any preacher he said my sheep hear my voice and a prophet is the voice of God not that he's to God he is just a voice he is the instrument that God uses when Jesus descended into the lower regions he said why did not you listen to Noah's message because Noah preached my message he was my instrument he was my voice that's what we must understand God created us to use us to use our eyes to use our mouth to use our legs to use us because no man have seen him at any time so he uses us as his veil Oh somebody help me here oh please he says the first job says what prophet have a man of all his labor which he taketh Under the Sun one generation passes away another generation cometh but the earth abideth for ever the Sun Also Rises and the Sun go it down and hastens to its place where he arose the wind that goes toward the soft and turn about unto the north it were about continually and the wind returned it again according to his circuits like I was saying last night everything always returned back to its place wherever you originated from is where you're going to return hmm oh it's the truth and listen how that you should all we're brothers what about look what Judah Judah's got right there in the face of God had supper with him broke bread win but Judas could not change his nature no matter what he followed he heard the same voice he was anointed by the same voice all the others did but he was born when he was born is that right brother ever said he just could not go to Pentecost that's why I try to hit this thing so much so much so much because of a man deserves our desires the Holy Ghost God will feel it if you thirst and hunger after righteousness that's God making you thirst after her and hunger after righteousness cause you and I don't have the ability to do so why would we want God if we not of God if you was enough God you wouldn't thirst for him God put the thirst in you the thirst after him and if you see this message you know what you if you really see it that's God that means God open your eyes that means you heard his voice which is a good thing he didn't say you had to understand all of it if you believe it on him whom I have sent this is your words yes Lord what works what we do he said believe on Him whom I have sent that sure works all those who really followed Moses were saved really followed him y'all understand me all who really followed Jesus were saved you see that I'm saying all who followed Paul's teaching was saying all those angels everyone why because they were ordained for a certain group of people and everybody that caught the voice of of appall and in arenas and all the restaurants right Lutheran West I mean the real ones that caught a hold to that voice and followed them we will meet them there we'll meet them there that's your words abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him as righteousness Yohe what I'm saying he didn't say he did all that he believed but he believed it was true because every believer will make mistakes you will say Lord forgive me and Lord I'm sorry but it doesn't change the fact that you believe it is that right the Bible said that Abraham staggered not at the promise of God but if you look through the history you find out something went wrong but deep in his heart he knew it was right but flesh will make you stagger but the soul says amen the soul is either faith without the soul says Amen and because that soul was a man God imputed it as righteousness Oh somebody help me here it cannot stop the devil can't stop you he makes you think the call you're not doing great and wonders let me tell you something you are a sign in a wonder if you can live in this fantasy they eat you are a sigh and a Wanda live righteously in this age you ha no wonder no doubt Hey the scripture says the corner Ecclesiastes 11450 I know that whatsoever God do it it shall be forever nothing can be put to it no anything taken from it and God do with it that man should fear before him you understand me if God elected you he elected you to be bribed and there is no way he made a mistake hey don't make no difference you know but Paul says shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid we do all we can do to live right before the Lord right live Lord but God who is rich in mercy you know you know what I'm what I'm trying to do is get you to do it just not on just to look now but look look back there and see you know Solomon how he made such a bad mistake and yet and feel god names himself or liken himself as the son of David and the son of David is Solomon and Solomon took another man's wife now it doesn't give us right to do what we do know we're not trying to justify that but I'm trying to show you how election words election is a certainty nothing can break it gossip oh I'm sorry I didn't mean to choose you then he's not God God when he saw you why you were in him everything that bout God is good so how can you be bad everything I don't care how small it might be it might be something you might have to look under microscope to see but if is in God is good it's holy and it's a part of him I love it because you know how God is not a tease you don't put something before your says ah you can have you reach 46 no you can't give it you know how we used to play with games with those kids you know but God doesn't play games it's real my mind Ecclesiastes says 1 through 7 1 & 7 says all the rivers run into the sea yay the sea is not full unto the place from which the river come hither they return again you mean all that water in the ocean how does it get all the way back up to where it came from God has a system gotta take that same water down in that in that ocean and calls the atmosphere to pull it up out of there and transport it all the way over down over here and drops it we know it is rain that rain accumulates again get back on his ride move back all around yeah only God can do that wherever it came from it returns back to and let me tell you something wherever you came from you will return back to it every single son and daughter of God that he thought of in the beginning will be there in heaven he said I have lost none one because His grace is sufficient I love it because Romans 131 and y'all know that when Paul was writing this Paul I believe Paul was under inspiration of Holy Spirit but I also believe that when Paul was writing this he probably was jumping and shouting at the same time what shall we say then to these things if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for what us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things not some things all things who should lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justified who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also make intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword aw as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter right nay in all of these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us now why would God give you a sword if you didn't have to fight people who want to Christianity with no battle nonsense put on the whole armour of God why would you put on a whole armor god and didn't happen you won't have to fight why would God give you a sword not just a sword a king so why because in this day you are king is that right oh he gives you the Kings sword because what the king became a king because he knew how to handle the sword that's what made him a king he wasn't just some amateur he was a king y'all understand what I'm saying think about the Kings and Roman every King had to know how to fight because at some time he one time I know that he had to be a Centurion some kind of man in the army of some sort f---eighteen right he just didn't pop up then bill King he had to work his way up and URI we are Kings and God allows us to work our way home right by his grace mmm well I am persuaded Paul says listen I'm persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things that present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us he didn't say just me I love it when he put the u.s. there he said no thing can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord hello think about it and God used the illustration even with Adam when Eve sinned right Adam sacrificed his whole kingdom for her and she was just as guilty as all get out but he forfeited everything he possessed and if God had been a man as such this is what he wanted you to know that what Lucifer did was so evil it took God Himself to correct it Michael no other angel could do it it took Jesus Christ himself and why did he do it because of l.o.v.e he loved us so much he didn't wanna lose us and I love the Scriptures Wyatt when the scripture says in that while we were yet sinners whoo oh my god you think about it so cuz the devil thing Oh see you're bad boy you too messed up the day and God gonna put you away no but I was a sinner he loved me when I was a sinner he died for me when I was a sinner I'm no silly anymore I'm a sign to--if he died while I was a sinner what will he do for me when I'm a slang David said his mercies and do it forever his mercies are renewed every Mon immersion grace is different mercies you caught you red-handed you done it you did it the evidence is there I'm gonna still give you mercy grace is unmerited none you could do I'm gonna give you grace cuz just I just like you you know you're the one I want to give grace to right the man over here can say no no no no Lord I've been a better person I didn't make no mistake I knew I was giving grace to you understand me it's just it's just the way it is look how blessed we are we come at the eleventh hour we are called eleventh hour were cups and we get the same reward God promised to the Ephesian age I'm gonna give you a penny whatever that pity is you know it's good I'm gonna give you a penny it doesn't matter if emphasis and all the rest I'm getting wait a minute long we don't work hard yeah y'all we had to go to the gas chamber we had to get our hair stock we had to do this we had to do this and here is this man we almost finished with it and they come in at the last minute and they gonna get the same thing I said that's all that promise and we get all of that think how blessed you and I are here in the last age God brings us into a message number to tell you something I wasn't looking for this message it came to me Abraham wasn't looking for God God came to Abraham see God came to me he found me in a denomination I wasn't out there somewhere he took some people out they heard the message then they started giving me to gave it to me I gave it to a person let me change them by the time that that message circulated the church hours in it was about 62 to 72 people left one time they thought it was a conspiracy and it was but God was the one that was behind me oh yes deacons and preachers and and trustees and all that we needed to start a church God pulled it all out at one time y'all understand I'm saying God does what he wants to do so let me let me let me let me say it like this and in looking back looking back to see and seeing now to the presence if we're sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus understand we're living in eternity there's no other way we dis flashes of a vessel of time but we're literally living in eternity we are and one on one of these old days it's going to catch up with us brother it's going to make it happen this eternity we serving that serving enough I heard a brother using analysis just a day and I was looking at a friend of mine and you know what he said he says just like a chicken and an egg you don't even know how much that chicken is growing inside that egg the egg doesn't grow bigger it's just dead and then all of a sudden the chicken is so big it's got to make room it's got to come out of that egg and he said that's how it you can't tell how much a person is growing on the inside by the way it looked on the outside hmm that life is constantly being added to and built upon and he said one of these old days we're gonna break out of this thing like a chicken out of an egg hallelujah ain't God good it can't help but happen blessed an it's a wonderful thing to be not to know that we're locked out of hell God done locked us out we can't even go there amen why he went there for us and when he left there he took the keys with him God is so good to us he just waiting for us to come up their name is on the book the gate will be open just for you think about it only because you're bearing his name father we show thank you for this time and opportunity you've been so good to us you have been better to us that we've been to ourselves if we look at ourselves that we will account ourselves unworthy so unworthy we shouldn't be calling upon your name but because of your acceptance we acepted in your dear son Jesus Christ you have given us boldness there and they access to the throne lord I pray that the little messages that were preached to die today would take root in us and bring forth a hundredfold bringing us to that perfect identity in Christ help us now keep us and
