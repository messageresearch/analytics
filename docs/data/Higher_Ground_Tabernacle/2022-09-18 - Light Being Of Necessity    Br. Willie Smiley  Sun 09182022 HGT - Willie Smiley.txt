morning it's it's just good to be up here you see in iowa are you on it's been a long time since we've had the privilege of being up here i'm normally good with faces but you because they frequent florida questions even in florida before when there's a meeting we look forward to having them their musical talents hey man they they sing and play [Music] we appreciate them uh it's it's good to see young men do everything that they can to serve the lord that's a real tremendous blessing in itself they drive a lot of miles it conduces the long distance i can't drive like that anymore so we had we had the fly no no because i realize it's it's a difficult job we passed it for 23 years now we're just an associate with my brother-in-law brother [Music] it's [Music] [Music] so you have to keep them in prayer genesis chapter 1 verse 1 uh we want to start the first verse and it reads in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep yeah and the spirit of god moved upon the face of and see you on suarez let's just buy his for a word of presence we come this morning humbly as we know just to get ourselves out of the way we're just an instrument this morning uh we're not here to be uh seen in somebody we're just here to express jesus christ so just annoying us oh god you know when new bear anoint the heroes of the word of god this morning uh we just trust that when we leave this place we can leave here blessed this morning we just thank god for the revealed word of the hour is that right you thank god for the message of the hour we thank god for god sending us a prophet in this hour because uh without a prophet in this hour we wouldn't have the right interpretations to the scriptures because one of the things we realize is there were so many things that were tied up and hid is that right so we we appreciate uh a prophet one of the things that um brother branham taught uh we can go further than genesis 1 and 1. uh we can go back to what was in god's mind before the foundations of the world and i appreciate that being able to understand what was the motive of god what would what was god doing when he started creating yes uh there's a purpose in the things that god does yeah an objective god doesn't do things foolishly during the faith uh we have a tendency of doing things without purpose we a lot of times humanly we don't give things thought upon some people but god thinks about the things or he thought about the things that he was doing one of the things that we find in studying the word of god uh and one of those attributes was to be a fob elon he helps us a lot when we look in the book of genesis because we see fatherhood in the book of genesis it may not look like it but what we find is fatherhood in the book of genesis because he had a family in his mind [Music] he put a lot of thought in in creation god wanted to create a perfect environment for his children post his own phone knowing that he would have a family for me see that that should help us as fathers this morning amen amen we want to make sure in order for our children to be uh prosperous come to full manifestation of their uh natural and spiritual potential they need to have the right kind of environment zombies is that right come on church how many believe that said right we must create the right kind of environment the right kind of situations situation correct for our family is that right you know uh i wish a lot of these principles i could have understood as a young man and this is why we try to relate things to this younger generation it's important for for for men it's important for it's important for you to create the right kind of environment in order for your seat to come to a much a place of development and maturity maturity the scripture lets us know it was out it was void of darkness uh uh and he saw he love you that it was necessary because it didn't necessarily is something uh necessary security or when you're young and you're immature it was that mature uh you don't see things as necessary necessity sometimes young people don't see why it's necessary the fallacions so i believe this morning that is it's it's necessary because it necessary to to just to walk in the light of the word of god because one of the things we've learned from studying the message is that god can only be identified by certain characteristics no characteristic there are certain things that god will not be identified with yeah yeah these shows okay is that right amen and as as ministry there's certain things that we won't be identified with with family in his mind realizing that he wanted to create realization a positive environment a place where they they could have a oneness a place that that you know uh that would be a harmony a place that there will be joy uh amen don't you just love harmony in the house don't you just love peace in the house because of its characteristics wouldn't be the right kind of environment corrector for his children to raise up it focuses on foreign is that right light was necessary necessary light is necessary is that right if if we're to ever see manifestation pokemon realizing uh in a message called um it's the rising of the sun so that we could see the characteristics of the characters of darkness uh and see why it was necessary for god to bring light who could drop amen brother branham he talks a little bit about bowler and he uses this term gloom um g-l-o-o-m g-l-o-o-m and what it represents it's it's it's darkness uh despondency the despondency the dependence depression depression dejection la rejection is that right so so you could see why god god looking at this darkness because there's always this law of contrast to everything no on to chosen and then in the beginning god wanted to bring forth a separation opportunity hey man god wanted his children juventus is on phone to be in light uh and we are the one our children in new zealand who wants to be depressed right no one wants to be depressed no one wants to be down come on is that right who who wants to live give a viva in those conditions under those conditions is that right being dejected is that right so we we we have to thank god for life we have to thank god for a condition god brought something into existence of existence that he can identify himself with avec [Applause] a coma right glory to god god you god because he can only be identified by his characteristics and according to scripture it's only true and the characteristics you know i have six children i know she sees on phone and i thank god that i was birthed under the evening time message which is light in this age brother branham preached a message uh call shalom shalom y'all heard the message right and he used the scripture is this like real uh from the book of isaiah we don't believe right and and what was brother branham trying to relate to us right because the the patterns of god don't change what do you think if god brought light in the book of genesis and and light is a is a positive term right it represents the oneness of the family is that right it it represents fulfillment of potential accomplishments right because brother branham makes this statement those seeds needed the power and he realized that could never come to because what darkness represents those seats this samosa needed the power of light oh glory to god see that was a predestinated scene because hey man i was walking in dark that's because your mouth is only the neighbor hey man as a drug addict a gang member a mumble dude the ganga but that was a sea lion and all that i had to do the principles of god that's not changed see we one thing i i've learned and studied in the world is that that redemption keeps a pattern that right and he looked at what darkness represented yeah we got the observation representative and he realized in order to bring forth these seeds i got to bring i got to bring something else if we understand the principles of scripture right to bring light do it temporary and wait like the ponte la lumiere comes home and y'all ought to be more happy to do that if you understand what light represents simple components if you really understand what your message is this preacher is trying to show you something we're living we're living it you know in a day [Applause] we thank god for light being in the church is that right amen we thank god for the light of the world being in the church because gross darkness is upon the people pascality never amen gross darkness is upon this world it's it's only getting worse and worse and worse and it's only getting worse it's getting worse for our children it's getting worse for our families but thank god for life is it shows me uh how to be a husband it opens up our understanding see this is what paul paul taught in ephesians says crippled uh i want you don't listen the eyes of our understanding do thank god god saw that it was necessary is that right thank god he saw her necessarily what is and how and what god starts out with it's good right because jesus is the light that's jesus glory [Music] amen so you can see why god thought it necessary necessary to bring light damn and life because i love the is it true jesus brought something into ex god brought something into existence do applications of existence that he could be identified as right because he's a positive particular positive is that right he's positive light is positive because of light i can have joy i cause that should be available right amen because you know we're all living in in a time of gross darkness and we could see now why brother branham preached alone is that right because being a prophet he could see what was coming upon this earth the unimaginable imaginable bunny priest the message shalom amen the glory of the lord is rich that's it the glory of the lord is racist like the jewish the glory of the lord is here that grant do do it to see because god don't change his principles i'm so glad about that i'm so glad for life amen amen it's just in the midst of you know this lay out of scene light elevated me la lumiere [Applause] you you find people going back to the world going back to denominationalism because yes maybe that deeds are evil observers or just maybe they they lack the understanding that god had in the beginning of what bringing light into existence would represent for us i'm grateful for life [Music] oh is a positive attribute unfortunately some people don't see it as that certain person they see light void as constraining um we sing the song it's grace it's grace it's grace to serve the lord is that right it's not constraining it's not restricting and these are the things that we have to relate to a younger generation there's things that we can do as christians outside of church on del delisa [Applause] is that right because rap music that's good rap music i think i'm speaking french i i i asked the brothers this morning was i talking too fast once i get started it's another language [Music] so i try to slow down we we we don't want to hurt the young man i like this guy right here amen but there's a lot of positive things that we can do as christians we we just got to understand the boundaries frontier right this this scripturally scripture there's always been been boundaries is that right there's there's a heavenly host brother branham taught us that that that the stars in the moon and all right yes and so who wants to live in chaos even people right not me i like harmony study peace with our man sadness which is produced [Music] by walking in darkness people don't realize this the genre [Applause] amen amen you have to make a choice this morning that's why i love the word of god that's why i love this message because what's been produced man didn't do this brother branham as a man to bring back [Applause] amen on crack cocaine avec cocaine a young man miserable miserable a young man depressed despondent about you but the sovereignty of god my name was written on the land book of life god had predestinated [Music] to send us a 20th century prophet zomboy um prophet du vintiem siekler how many believe that god saw that you have usually it was necessary because in redemption there see amen you don't have to walk in darkness is that right young people you don't have to walk in darkness well my friends are the people around the people around you you got to make a choice whether you want to walk in darkness but it's your choice is that right glory to god god you because you live and die by the choices that you make [Music] amen not the choices that your parents made because right wrong sets before all of us right even the smallest kids knows when it's doing something wrong is that right there's an intelligence in a kid at a very small age you could tell it not to do something smack his hand and the moment they get ready to do something it'll remember that snap out of hand and then look back for the parent if i would go on to see if it's there y'all gonna preach with me now i had six children when i got six children she's on phone right amen but they make the choice either i'm gonna do that and get the smack um the more i grow in christ jesus christ the more i thank him for life the more i praise him for this word people are going back i thank god for walking in life glory to god i thank god like like kane is that right because it's dark out here let's get some boise look at the things that we see it's terrible see i i experienced a lot walking in darkness [Music] themselves for for drugs of the world in that manner you thank god for life glory to god amen good man gang violence to those experiences dance's experience it's grace it's grace it's grace to serve the lord jesus amen thank amen when god thought about life let's drop on see he had me in his mind amen when god thought about life he thought he saw me praising him he saw me worshipping my that he saw it necessary necessary to bring forth a positive positive instead of a negative negative because i'm a part of the family of god and you're a part of the family of god hallelujah amen aren't you grateful to be a son and daughter of god [Applause] amen a rapture is going on this morning is that right there's a rapture going on this morning [Applause] [Music] that's why we gotta constantly pray is that right amen because it's gross darkness amen amen darkness is is pressing upon the people gross darkness but it's a sign that morning is coming is that right amen glory to god because he get it it gets [Music] no matter how dark it is morning is coming we're going in the rapture how many is going in the rapture i'm glad to see your hoes this this morning hallelujah no matter how dark it gets i know god's got me is that right god's got me he he's my victory daddy has you thank god for life i thank god but i'll tell you what we can't say this enough amen was brother brandon perfect in christ on christopher in christ just like me i ain't perfect you super perfect in the flesh don't i share i make mistakes in the flesh brother brooks make mistakes in the flesh being in christ we pray glory to god we we meet the requirements hong kong by being in christ hallelujah amen amen amen i appreciate that but he never gave up on me [Music] [Applause] he he he keeps on proving himself he continues over uncle and over and over again amen because let me tell you something listen with your truth we get weary on the journey no no no because his word is bigger than our human emotions his word is able to keep us able to keep me from falling i i see some of y'all look just as old as me so you all know what i'm talking about when you're 15. 16. when you're about 20 what is the event on oh you know all the answers of constitution but you know you don't even know the question it ain't till you get by 600 and when when the light struck him down he lost he said no i i counted all i counted all done and that's what a whole lot of young folk need to do and a whole lot of old folk need to do because we just need to realize we don't know nothing so god can teach us something the man that's teaching us ain't this crazy the the man that baptized you the lump keeps about to see in the name of the lord jesus christ that's a shame before god sent on to the wonder but it's the truth you see it on all levels i'ma say something here and i hope it's not offensive i'll just talk [Music] in order for your ministry to progress what what kills a young ministry lee john minister is young brothers get a little knowledge with no real experience experience because if you're 20 years old you don't even know the hardship because the difficulty of raising children deliveries on phone and and paying bills with a little bit of money you know nothing it takes it it takes a lifetime you fall in uh right just just to come to a place of maturity at 60 years old it's taken all my life and i still haven't arrived i'm still have i still haven't arrived when i look at my life let's regard my viewers it's like man what have i been doing just because you're faint and i thought i've been doing something physically because when light comes it shows me what i do not know amen right it shows me at 60. right i don't know at sixty i'm learning me i'm i'm a ponder y'all ought to preach with me glory to god hey i know y'all saying wow that's profound is it performed that's the truth you don't know yourself the way you think you know yourself because if light starts shining on you come on the most hurting thing for me is is is watching my own my own son so we got them on proper fees get

somebody gonna have to help me out maybe they could express their [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you trust oh [Music] if you trust [Music] is [Music] is [Music] we thank god for the word of god [Music] but the bright light here kept it from being as dark as i wanted it to be i wanted everybody to see what darkness really is like [Music] i appreciate that brother [Music] but not only did god quicken my soul but he's still transforming me he's still changing me and thank god for the light thank god for this message i give my amen just for a moment you may be seated i just want to uh just uh say a little something kind of connecting with our brother's ministry the word he brought you should never miss church because brother brooks is not here it takes a five-fold ministry to perfect you before the minister the president of young brothers at this point in time they're being they're learning to be evangelists or they're learning to to become a pastor they're in their early stages of ministry need your support and the most difficult part about it is learning how to move out of the way so god can have his way so i want to encourage this church it doesn't matter if i'm here or not if you truly believe god [Music] how young hallelujah is that right god calls josiah at the age of 12. it's not the man he's the god behind the man a life of sanctification giving me the certificate that gave me the strength i needed to to have stuck as a young person and young people need young people as examples hallelujah at least the young people always say amen it's the truth why i needed young people when i was younger i needed to see somebody young living the life [Music] amen you love the lord i appreciate my brother so much [Music] amen it looked like there was something else i wanted to say oh i wanted to say we're going to get some more headsets right now we we're in the process of looking at some new ones for those who don't understand english and and some who are struggling uh with french as well as healing even when you got a headset you could still say hallelujah now some of y'all came in here with gloom on you and what's amazing how the brother was preaching on light is it and i could feel the happiness and i said oh [Music] and you're making it difficult for the preacher to preach am i the only one that felt the heaviness in here and and you know it's because listen we understand one thing the lord has shown me you got to learn how to release those things is that right you got to learn how to confess it that's the only way you're going to ever be free believe that you're truly the seed of god and if you believe you truly the seed of god no weapon formed against you can prosper all of us need to be full of joy people of god don't you see the enemy the enemy is trying to keep you in the anointing of the atmosphere of gloom and darkness came [Music] sometimes i feel like uh a spectacle the fashion song come on because when i come in here you come to [Applause] is that brother billy back there to see you you'll look alike right here hey man good to see you brother but my point is this i'm on point we sunday who was here sunday last sunday such a sweet spirit of unity came in this place and all was it that we reached out to one another um by one blood and that's the spirit of jesus christ hallelujah i believe this message if we take it for what it really is will set us in heavenly places in christ jesus christ and we're coming here rejoicing and i guarantee you god will break every yolk [Music] that's the light we're living in look how brother branham lives so so before the lord regardless to god came to him and say how many squirrels you want [Music] but i believe if you enjoy jesus jesus will enjoy [Music] is that right you look at that woman that that was at jesus feet washing his feet worshiping him she had more than probably a long list of things protecting long list but god caught in the spirit what she needed the most she needed forgiveness [Music] the bible says amen god inhabits the praise of his people i'm not talking i'm not saying no more but i'm saying this brother god used him to preach light i can't imagine i can't imagine if the atmosphere had been on another level [Music] like i said i went and cut that switch off and i forgot about this big thing up here i really wanted y'all to see what darkness felt like while he was preaching if it had been dark enough i was going to leave it on for a bit let it off for a bit said him preach in the dark so you can understand what god has done in your soul god has done a wonderful thing in your soul hallelujah and i tell you what don't don't ever reject the light when you reject the light amen you rejecting god and you're rejecting life brother i haven't forgotten about you i know you called me i've been busy i'm gonna get to you don't you worry i'm gonna get to you sometimes i think a lot of times people so you understand i'm a busy man but i do my best to get to you when i can get to you you understand me [Laughter] and i just want you to understand i love everybody we have our differences but don't ever think i don't love and care for you guys hallelujah we fast we argue but family is right it's true family when y'all stop seeing each other as the other brother and the other sisters you'll learn how to really love each other the way you should love each other like a true family of god i'm sorry brother you left that anointing up here amen amen we got our brother brother isaac who's a deacon in iowa city jaguar iowa city azer matama has been a blessing to me [Music] uh but i'm gonna have him come and say a word to you [Music] and i don't want to tell a story but i'll say this we was hoping she would be able to come this way but as time goes on it seems like our brother isaac is going to have to meet his wife [Music] it's a happy sad situation [Music] amen so that's all i'm going to say i'ma have my brother isaac come and share with you what why he's leaving he's not mad with the pastor amen in fact i i can remember the time when he had covet and uh i don't know something moved on me to pray for him i called him and and forgot if i got him right he said he at that time he thought he was gonna die or something like that he can tell a story but god touched him and i thank god for my brother today amen god bless you sir excuse me and i want to thank pastor brooks [Music] who led us through throughout all this time [Music] has been a great help for me personally um and so during that period it was almost impossible to have someone help you and when you would call the hospital they will just give you instructions on the phone personnel and the first night i just slept just sick like that i started losing my breath uh the situation and then the situation just got worse and i told him maybe this is going to be the last word i'm going to tell him i'm dying right now [Music] and i started saying that the situation at some point until i slept i was like lost stage glory to god i want to say thank you [Music] what did you do to bring your pastor to come all the way to canada sir somebody possible yeah i couldn't understand it foreign so they they're really they they were really lost that your pastor like my pastor came all the way to canada to attend my wedding and so they they really
