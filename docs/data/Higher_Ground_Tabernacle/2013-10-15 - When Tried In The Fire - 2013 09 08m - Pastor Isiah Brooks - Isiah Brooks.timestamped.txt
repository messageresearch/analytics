[14:03] to carry on a conversation about the
[14:05] word of
[14:07] God and uh I've seen it but it's been a
[14:10] while since I've seen
[14:12] it and I really believe by the grace of
[14:14] God if we don't get the word to our
[14:17] young people now it's not so limited but
[14:20] for the most part those that's the age
[14:22] I'd like to have uh because I realize by
[14:25] the grace of God is later than what we
[14:27] think and uh we just want to get that
[14:30] word into the young people if you don't
[14:32] know what you're fighting against you're

[15:37] to First Peter
[15:43] 4:12 first Peter
[15:46] 4:12 uh Brother Rich and I was
[15:49] fellowshipping the other day and he said
[15:52] something that struck me I had some
[15:54] other thought on my heart and mind I
[15:56] might Minister that this evening if the
[15:58] Lord with Terry uh but when it struck me
[16:02] it just really hit and I thought I he
[16:04] Brother Rich I said that's what I I
[16:06] believe God want me to minister on so
[16:08] let us turn to 1 Peter
[16:11] 4:12 everybody
[16:14] there beloved think it not strange
[16:17] concerning the Fier trials which is to
[16:21] try
[16:22] you as though some strange thing
[16:26] happened unto you
[16:30] but
[16:31] rejoice in as much as ye are partakers
[16:34] of Christ's
[16:36] suffering that when his glory shall be
[16:39] revealed you may be glad also with
[16:44] exceeding
[16:45] Joy you love the
[16:47] Lord Daniel
[16:50] 3 I know y'all like that
[16:53] scripture Daniel 3:25
[17:07] after Daniel we go to
[17:09] joob Daniel
[17:12] 3:25 he answered and said lo I see four
[17:17] men
[17:18] loose walking in the midst of the fire
[17:23] and they have no
[17:24] hurt and the form of the fourth is like
[17:29] the Son of
[17:31] God one more scripture job 23 and10 you
[17:36] ought to be encouraged already by
[17:41] now you see I realize by the grace of
[17:43] God we all are in major battles maybe
[17:48] you're not but I know I have
[17:50] been but it has been a
[17:53] real good
[17:57] battle especially when you come out as
[18:00] the
[18:01] winner job 23
[18:04] and10 but he knoweth the way that I
[18:08] take when he hath tried me I shall come
[18:13] forth as gold now if that's not good
[18:19] stuff amen we like to in uh uh entitled
[18:23] this message when
[18:25] tried in the fire father God we come
[18:29] before you Lord we thank you for your
[18:31] grace your mercy and your
[18:34] love without you where would we be and
[18:38] father I am just astounded at your love
[18:43] and your grace that you have had
[18:46] personally toward me and your people
[18:49] Lord you have not dealt with us
[18:52] according to our iniquities our sins
[18:56] your mercy and your grace have been
[18:59] our hiding place and Lord we hold the
[19:03] banner of love thank you for being so
[19:08] real to us and oh longsuffering patient
[19:12] merciful and kind Lord give us Grace oh
[19:17] Lord to
[19:18] continue to walk before you Lord bless
[19:22] each and every heart in this assembly in
[19:26] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen am man
[19:29] you may be
[19:39] seated we have heard many
[19:45] times about how God is going to test
[19:50] us of course Peter said think it not
[19:53] strange when you fall into fiery trial
[20:00] now we know that when we talk about
[20:03] fiery trials we're talking about
[20:08] calamities or trials that test the
[20:14] character because that's what you're
[20:16] being
[20:17] tested your character is the only thing
[20:20] that's being tested right
[20:22] now because remember the prophet of God
[20:25] said you won't take nothing else with
[20:27] you
[20:29] job said naked I came into this world
[20:31] and naked I returned but literally the
[20:35] only way that you can get into heaven
[20:37] you must have Christ's
[20:40] character so we know by the grace of God
[20:43] trials are going to come tests are go
[20:48] going to come is that right listen the
[20:50] word of God said don't even think it's
[20:52] strange it's
[20:54] coming whether you like it or not you
[20:57] can be on the Mountaintop today and
[20:59] tomorrow you'll be fighting in the
[21:02] valley but understand it it's a true
[21:05] known fact that everything grows in the
[21:10] valley only little things are small
[21:13] things or sometimes no thing grow on top
[21:16] of the mountain hello somebody so we
[21:20] realize amen by the grace of God that we
[21:22] must understand that we must arm
[21:26] ourselves that's why the Bible said put
[21:27] on their whole armor of
[21:29] God we are in a time where God is
[21:33] perfecting a church he called this
[21:36] church the Bride of Jesus Christ and I
[21:39] don't know about you but I don't mind
[21:41] being tried I don't mind the fiery
[21:45] trials as long as I know that the fourth
[21:47] man is in the
[21:49] fire as long as he's there I'm going to
[21:53] be all
[21:55] right one thing I love about
[21:59] um this thing this illustration with
[22:02] Daniel because the Bible tells me amen
[22:06] that in these Hebrew boys that were uh
[22:09] literally thrown in the
[22:11] fire they bands were
[22:14] loosed in other words when you are Tried
[22:18] by a fire or a test it should not put
[22:22] you into bondage amen amen come on
[22:26] somebody but the father fire is there to
[22:30] loose you from bondage amen because
[22:35] remember they were Bound by uh the
[22:39] Babylonians but the closer they got to
[22:42] the fire the fire in itself broke the
[22:46] bands and they were loosed Hallelujah so
[22:51] if your trial has you in bondage
[22:55] something is not quite right you have
[22:58] not amen allowed this fire to loose you
[23:03] now one thing I love about the grace of
[23:06] God is that God gives us the spirit of
[23:10] repentance amen see Satan can put
[23:14] anything on us he can cause us to fall
[23:17] and come short but that word repentance
[23:21] hallelujah amen will clear the Slate
[23:23] every time and all you and I have to do
[23:27] is confess and make known unto the Lord
[23:30] amen our
[23:32] sorrowful HHH Spirit our our desire to
[23:35] live right and to live holy and the
[23:38] Bible said the blood of Jesus Christ
[23:40] cleanses you from all
[23:47] unrighteousness Psalms 80 And1 it says
[23:50] give ear oh Shepherd of Israel thou that
[23:55] leadth Joseph like a flock
[23:59] thou that dwelleth between the
[24:02] cherubims shine
[24:04] forth and when I read that I thought my
[24:07] isn't that
[24:08] wonderful amen that we have a Shepherd
[24:11] amen that dwells amen between the uh
[24:16] cherubims there on The Mercy Seat
[24:19] Hallelujah and if the shepherd is
[24:22] between the cherubims the Sheep must be
[24:25] also amen because amen it is the glory
[24:29] of God now I thought to myself here God
[24:34] is
[24:35] perfecting uh and bringing up a Perfect
[24:38] Bride for Jesus Christ and here he calls
[24:43] this A Flock
[24:47] Joseph Joseph that leadth Joseph like a
[24:51] flock and of course Joseph was
[24:54] Perfection hello we're talking about
[24:58] Joseph down in in Egypt hallelujah amen
[25:02] uh we talked about Joseph amen being
[25:06] perfect amen and God was leading him uh
[25:11] and and we realize by the grace of God
[25:13] that's what God is doing now but where
[25:15] is he leading us you know the prophet of
[25:18] God said that there's a Time amen when
[25:21] mankind fell God drove uh them out of
[25:25] the Garden of Eden and he put a flaming
[25:27] sword there to keep them from the Tree
[25:30] of Life he said but those same cherubims
[25:33] those same angels are now driving us
[25:37] back amen into the holies of holies
[25:40] Hallelujah why it is where we came from
[25:43] it is where we're going to
[25:46] return Hallelujah so we look in Isaiah
[25:50] 40 And1 says he shall feed his flock
[25:54] like a shepherd He Shall Gather the
[25:57] Lambs with his arm and carry them in his
[26:01] bosom and shall gently lead those that
[26:05] are with young now that is a promise
[26:09] hello and God keeps all of his promises
[26:13] I don't know about you but I believe
[26:15] that there is no safer Place uh to be
[26:20] other than into a bosom amen of the
[26:23] shepherd is that right amen that's where
[26:25] Lazarus when he died he was found in
[26:27] Abraham bosom hallelujah amen and he was
[26:31] Sav he was sound amen and he was out
[26:35] without harm is that okay now I'm
[26:37] working with the shepherd just a little
[26:38] bit because we know that we call and
[26:41] claim ourselves to be
[26:44] sheep come on somebody amen and we are
[26:48] dumb creatures we don't know how to lead
[26:51] ourselves and every time we try to lead
[26:54] we make a mess amen you don't have to
[26:57] tell me amen Amen on that cuz I know
[26:59] flesh I know what human beings do and
[27:02] every time we try to lead ourselves we
[27:05] get in trouble you're not designed to
[27:08] lead yourself you literally need a
[27:11] Shepherd Hallelujah come on somebody hlj
[27:14] but there's something good about sheep
[27:17] because once they come to know who their
[27:19] Shepherd is no matter how many Shepherds
[27:22] there are in the field that sheep will
[27:25] only hear its Shepherd's voice
[27:29] David said the Lord is my shepherd and I
[27:33] shall not want that means I shall not
[27:37] lack
[27:39] nothing I love it because you and I are
[27:42] still gleaning from the blessings of
[27:44] David now you and I listen if you're
[27:47] lacking that's your problem
[27:50] amen hello somebody if you're lacking
[27:54] that's your problem because David said
[27:57] who's in the old Testament I shall not
[28:01] want oh come on somebody so if you're
[28:04] wanting it's only because you didn't ask
[28:06] and if you asked and didn't get it it's
[28:09] because you asking a Miss to consume it
[28:12] upon your own lust Hallelujah but if you
[28:14] asking because there's a really need a
[28:16] real need God will furnish you so much
[28:20] so you like nothing there is nothing
[28:23] lacking in the shakina glory
[28:29] he said he maketh me lie down in Green
[28:32] Pastures he leadth me beside the Ste
[28:35] Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me
[28:40] in the path of righteousness for his
[28:43] name sake oh he leads you in the path of
[28:46] righteousness because you're
[28:48] good cuz you think you all of that come
[28:51] on somebody oh maybe it's your family
[28:53] inheritance you think amen that that's
[28:56] why no no no no it's only for his name
[29:00] sake don't you ever forget
[29:04] it you and I ain't nothing but a clog of
[29:07] dirt full of worms right without God
[29:11] Amen oh yeah amen listen in the message
[29:17] Supernatural the prophet God talks about
[29:19] the way of a shepherd with his
[29:22] sheep and he talks about how this custom
[29:25] or this thing is done in the Eastern
[29:27] countries and
[29:28] you know if you've ever seen it or
[29:30] witnessed it you find it so fascinating
[29:34] because in the Eastern countries for
[29:35] those of us who've gone down to the
[29:37] farmers market basically that's how
[29:39] their markets are I mean just in the
[29:42] street and you just have one street you
[29:44] know you don't have sidewalks and you
[29:47] know it's not like how they have it down
[29:49] here where the dogs want to stray but
[29:51] when when a Shepherd uh is leading his
[29:54] sheep it doesn't matter how much fruit
[29:57] and how how great the attraction is that
[30:01] sheep knows how to stay in line he says
[30:05] now the easterners put all their
[30:06] dainties out on the street even their
[30:09] meats and everything else lay on the
[30:12] streets and all their fruits and produce
[30:14] lay right on the street here's your
[30:17] store like this they keep their stuff
[30:19] back in there but you buy right off the
[30:23] sidewalk and there's no sidewalk it's
[30:26] just a street so everybody walks right
[30:28] in the street just right down the street
[30:31] the cobbler Stone streets and here come
[30:33] a Shepherd down on the street walking
[30:35] walking along and behind him a string of
[30:38] sheep a shitty block long now I want you
[30:42] to imagine that just place that in your
[30:44] mind there's only one Shepherd there's a
[30:47] sheep behind the uh uh in front a sheep
[30:50] behind the Sheep behind the Sheep behind
[30:52] the Sheep behind the Sheep one straight
[30:56] line and you mean to tell me dumb sheep
[31:00] know how to stay in line in order sir
[31:03] and we're supposed to be more
[31:04] intelligent than that and we don't know
[31:07] how to stay in a straight
[31:12] line here come the shepherd down the
[31:14] street walking alone come on somebody
[31:17] and them sheep right walking right by
[31:19] the produce and things and won't turn
[31:22] right or left I'm going tell you
[31:24] something a Shepherd amen he Shepherds
[31:27] sometimes times more than
[31:29] sheep he might have camels he might have
[31:32] goats he might have a lot of things
[31:37] right but I want you to know there's a
[31:40] different
[31:42] behavior when it comes to the Sheep let
[31:44] me preach all right so they kept their
[31:47] eyes on the shepherd moving right on
[31:50] through I thought oh god what the
[31:53] shepherd means not look right or left
[31:56] nor be tempted by this or that but walk
[31:59] in the footsteps of the shepherd they
[32:02] want to follow the shepherd I noticed
[32:05] one day while we were in a little
[32:08] British Jeep riding along there was a
[32:12] Shepherd that had a whole lot of animals
[32:14] up on the hill there and he was feeding
[32:18] them they were leading them and taking
[32:21] them places and in there he had sheep
[32:25] and in there he had goats
[32:28] and in there he had mes and camels and
[32:31] everything he was feeding them all they
[32:35] were all grazing and the shepherd was
[32:38] watching them I said my a Shepherd here
[32:42] means many things Shepherd is a gay
[32:45] Grazer but he said you know the strange
[32:48] thing is when night time comes you watch
[32:52] all those sheep go right straight to the
[32:55] shepherd
[32:57] the mes would stay out in the pasture
[33:01] the camels would stay out in the pasture
[33:03] and the goats would stay out in the
[33:05] pasture but said the
[33:08] Sheep all come straight to the shepherd
[33:12] when come midnight time why said because
[33:15] the Sheep are put up at night and kept
[33:19] safe oh
[33:21] Hallelujah he said Mr don't talk like
[33:23] that I can feel brother R right now he's
[33:25] getting ready to get exited he said Mr
[33:27] don't talk like that right now he said
[33:31] you'll make me start shouting right in
[33:32] the middle of the
[33:37] road see night times are coming many are
[33:40] grazing on the same thing but only the
[33:43] Sheep will he recognize see what I mean
[33:47] just the Sheep the Born Again many are
[33:51] called few are chosen he said oh I love
[33:54] him today don't you
[33:58] now he said talk about in the other
[34:02] message here he talks about it there in
[34:04] Shepherd of the sheep F he said what
[34:07] about the fell he said them sheep is so
[34:11] devoted to the shepherd
[34:15] to W pay they pay no attention to
[34:19] nothing but they follow
[34:23] him real sheep Born Again believers
[34:28] they're so devoted to the
[34:31] shepherd till they pay nothing else
[34:34] attention they follow him I thought oh
[34:38] God your church should be so devoted to
[34:40] you that the Temptations of the world
[34:43] has nothing to do with them they keep
[34:47] their mind on the shepherd the shepherd
[34:50] could make one step this way they'll go
[34:53] back this way and every sheep coming
[34:56] right behind the other one make the same
[34:59] kind of a step follow the shepherd oh to
[35:04] follow the footstep of the shepher
[35:06] that's it don't be tempted tossed about
[35:09] worried tempted here and down here and
[35:11] today you got the Victory and tomorrow
[35:13] you out of the victory follow the
[35:15] shepherd he's a
[35:17] leading so my sheep knows my voice and a
[35:23] stranger they will not follow amen thank
[35:27] you Lord

[35:31] means the devil the devil has a strange
[35:36] voice why follow him
[35:39] then oh y'all quiet this morning it's
[35:42] all right but I'm preaching anyhow

[35:48] that has been given you you know we've
[35:50] had it so easy you know oh the Bride of
[35:53] Jesus Christ is this and the Bride of
[35:55] Jesus Christ is that she is is she is
[35:59] but I find out that there's so many
[36:01] people who claim to be the Bride of
[36:04] Jesus Christ and as of yet have not the
[36:06] Holy
[36:10] Ghost listen even in
[36:14] Trials even in
[36:17] Trials we fail to seek the one that
[36:20] could help
[36:22] us when job was going through a lot of
[36:24] things he had his confidence and I'm G
[36:26] tell you something sometimes when you
[36:28] got uh going through things it's best to
[36:30] keep your mouth shut amen because the
[36:33] people who you think going to encourage
[36:35] you will condemn
[36:38] you nobody knows your heart like
[36:43] God job 35 and 10 and you know I don't
[36:47] know
[36:48] uh let me move on but none saith where
[36:53] is God my
[36:55] maker who giveth some songs in the
[37:00] night come on somebody I don't care how
[37:04] dark your night is there's one that can
[37:06] give you a song Amen now I don't know
[37:08] about you but there's been many times
[37:11] I've gone through things and God had
[37:13] drop down a song it didn't come from the
[37:16] radio or the TV or anything else it came
[37:19] from Heaven am encouraging me and what I
[37:23] do I join right in with that
[37:26] song well you think think it came from
[37:29] where where do you think it comes from
[37:30] it comes from Heaven he said he give you
[37:32] a song in the night
[37:35] amen who teaches us more listen you
[37:38] ought to be uh conc uh how put how can I
[37:41] say it God listen what he says in and
[37:43] then I go on who teaches us more than
[37:46] the Beast of the earth and maketh us
[37:48] wiser than the fils of Heaven now here
[37:51] God has made you in His image right he
[37:54] is our comforter he made us in His image
[37:57] and likeness he gave us and made us in
[37:59] the highest form of his creation amen a
[38:02] man in the image and and likeness of God
[38:06] listen and yet we find
[38:09] ourselves less
[38:11] connected than most
[38:15] beasts you said explain that to me even
[38:18] brother brandham said when he was in
[38:20] India and the earthquake was getting
[38:23] ready to come he said all of those birds
[38:28] moved away from the
[38:30] wall right and then brother bam goes on
[38:33] to say and he talks about the Great
[38:35] Earthquake he talks about the trials and
[38:37] tests that about ready to attest us and
[38:40] so many of us are still at the
[38:43] wall the world
[38:47] Wall come on somebody we still don't
[38:51] know how to pull ourselves away from the
[38:52] world and we find we see the thing
[38:56] coming and we failing to get away from
[38:59] it come on
[39:01] somebody now Birds got better sense or
[39:04] better connection because listen all a
[39:07] bird have is a bird
[39:10] brain but he has a sensory something
[39:13] that lets him know trouble is coming
[39:16] amen and we we you know it's like us you
[39:19] know we'll play with a snake until it
[39:20] bites
[39:21] us but listen we are once connected with
[39:26] God we didn't knows the mind of God we
[39:30] we didn't know where to turn and where
[39:32] not to turn where to go and where not to
[39:35] go learning Amen to be followers of the
[39:39] holy spirit amen because remember the
[39:41] Bible said they that are led by the
[39:42] spirit they are truly the sons of God
[39:47] Amen every age had that trials and so
[39:51] don't think you you you exempt and
[39:53] you're going to go through this thing
[39:54] without it so many of us want to be we
[39:57] say we're bride and you know I'm I'm
[40:00] just wondering you know what is being
[40:01] produced in your life that sounds kind
[40:04] of kind of tough but it it's it's good
[40:07] because you must examine yourself Paul
[40:09] says and see whether you be in the faith
[40:12] so you and I must examine ourselves to
[40:15] see whether we be in the
[40:17] faith right because every age must
[40:22] produce the seed that was sown for that
[40:25] age
[40:27] Luther produced his seeds Wesley
[40:30] produced his seeds Pentecost produced
[40:33] their seed but we're now in the bride
[40:35] age and you know our Prophet who was
[40:38] William brandham sold those seeds
[40:41] they've been sown a long
[40:43] time and we're now in
[40:46] Harvest God didn't call us to a a church
[40:50] anity hello somebody God didn't call us
[40:53] Amen to be just a large or a group we
[40:57] supposed to be a
[41:01] Powerhouse it ain't God's
[41:04] fault the word has been
[41:07] sown he just needs somebody who going to
[41:10] take it by faith and act upon it that's
[41:14] why I love brother brandham his example
[41:16] he said when he got saved he looked into
[41:18] all the
[41:19] drawers right he wanted to know all of
[41:21] his blessings he want to know this he
[41:23] want to know that he said and then if if
[41:25] it's if the draw is too high he said get
[41:26] you L and climb up on
[41:29] it all of the blessings that God Amen
[41:32] has set for us is for
[41:34] us but we've got to be willing Amen to
[41:38] die to ourselves search it out am
[41:41] searching this word out is not coming to
[41:43] knowing it intellectually but it's
[41:46] proving it and let it prove
[41:49] itself Hallelujah
[41:52] listen Psalms amen 12 and 6 says the
[41:56] word of the Lord are pure pure
[41:58] words nah come on somebody y'all
[42:00] understand with that it means it's pure
[42:03] that means it will produce what it says
[42:06] it'll do is that right as silver tried
[42:10] in a furnace of Earth purified seven
[42:14] times every Church age had to be
[42:17] purified it had to go through his
[42:21] fire and we're not
[42:23] exempt what is your trial what is your
[42:26] fire
[42:28] what are you going through it's not your
[42:30] enemy the fire is your friend it comes
[42:34] to take the draws out of your
[42:38] life oh the trial is not to consume you
[42:43] it's only to consume your thoughts it's
[42:46] only to consume your fears it's only to
[42:49] consume the darkness in your life it's
[42:52] not to consume you matter of fact the
[42:55] fire comes to set you afraid
[42:58] amen hallelujah amen Remember by the
[43:03] grace of God
[43:05] how the devil thought that he was going
[43:08] to get rid of the Hebrew Boys in Daniel
[43:10] and he thought that he had set the fire
[43:12] 7even times harder brother bandam said
[43:15] in this day the fire is set seven times
[43:19] harder you say oh my God yes you and I
[43:23] are our trials are
[43:25] greater than any other
[43:28] age and God chose
[43:31] you thank you Lord to throw in the
[43:34] furnace
[43:36] amen hallelujah amen but we don't have
[43:39] to worry you said what I prayed and and

[43:51] word from God but they would not bow
[43:54] hallelujah amen they kept the C they
[43:57] held on to it amen they held on to it
[44:01] and and and and when they held on to it

[44:29] time Hallelujah come on wormwood stood
[44:32] up and said God let me go down I'll turn
[44:35] the world upside down you know I've done
[44:38] it before amen and God said no sir this

[44:46] said I'll go down hallelujah amen come

[45:02] trial if you hold fast to your character
[45:06] God will come down and answer and you
[45:09] know what's so powerful about it even

[48:59] y'all got me
[49:01] started oh so look that's what James
[49:04] said he said a double-minded man is
[49:06] unstable in all his ways so you got to

[49:11] you've got two natures and you haven't
[49:13] fully been baptized maybe you got the
[49:15] Holy Ghost on your spirit and not in
[49:16] your soul you got two Natures working

[49:41] to live in you yes sir up to that point
[49:45] you going to be wishy-washy With God all
[49:48] the time with God I spoke in Tong with
[49:50] all our Spirits you know the uh the Fire
[49:52] H that's all right all those things are
[49:54] good but you can't stop there you got to
[49:57] go all the way into the Shina glory of
[50:01] God that's your age cuz that's where
[50:03] perfect love is behind the
[50:07] veil is that all right amen listen when
[50:11] you are
[50:12] unstable double-minded listen what
[50:14] happens to you second Peter 3:16 he said
[50:18] as also in all his Epistles speaking in
[50:21] them of these things you know the things
[50:23] that should come how men would be in
[50:25] which are all some things hard to be
[50:29] understood we find that even in the
[50:31] message people can't understand what
[50:32] brother brandham said he didn't say you
[50:34] had to understand he said believe it
[50:36] amen but they wrestle with the same
[50:38] stuff well this don't go there and that
[50:40] going go there you keep on wrestling the
[50:43] problem is you're unstable which they
[50:46] are unlearned and unrest unstable rest
[50:50] and I said to myself what is wrong with
[50:52] people amen that ain't got no power no
[50:55] gifts no no signs no wonders and yet
[50:58] they want to correct the
[51:02] prophet oh lordy lordy
[51:05] lordy which they that are unlearned and
[51:08] unstable rest as they do also other
[51:11] scriptures where un their own
[51:15] destruction and somewhere you're going
[51:18] to have to Anchor your soul in this
[51:20] world or you're going to always be
[51:22] unstable that's right moving with every
[51:25] win of Doctrine is that right amen let
[51:28] me tell you about a man by the name of
[51:29] Reuben he was the first born of Jacob of
[51:31] Israel is that right the Bible said when
[51:34] Jacob began to put out his blessings he
[51:35] said Ruben Thou Art my first born my
[51:39] might and the beginning of my strength
[51:41] the Excellency of dignity and the
[51:44] Excellency of power now this is what he
[51:46] was supposed to
[51:47] be he said but unstable as
[51:52] water and anybody know water is very
[51:55] unstable
[51:56] come on Thou shalt not exceed Excel
[52:00] excuse me as long as you are unstable
[52:03] there is no way you going to excel in
[52:05] God the Bible said don't even think a
[52:07] double-minded man is going to get
[52:08] anything from
[52:11] God because thou wentest up to thy
[52:14] father's bed and then defileth thou it
[52:18] and he went up to my couch is that right
[52:21] for one little sin being unstable like
[52:25] that amen and that word word comes into
[52:27] a recklessness sometimes you don't even
[52:30] know what you're getting ready to do but
[52:31] you'll let Satan tempt you and try you
[52:33] into something amen and make you fall
[52:36] into something that will be
[52:40] Reckless I'm going say it again so
[52:43] you'll know where you are this is the
[52:44] mirror of the word amen hallelujah you
[52:47] don't want to be unstable Holy Ghost
[52:50] feel in the church today and and don't
[52:52] know what you believe on the outside

[52:57] being blessed this morning we're here to
[53:00] endure you know why I'm preaching like
[53:02] this a man said to me the other day a

[53:05] person's church he said and I just fear
[53:07] that I was too hard I'm going to tell

[57:15] need to do or give you a list of things
[57:18] that's going to carry you out through
[57:19] the week of the things that you must
[57:21] need to do and that's how it is with
[57:23] Jesus Christ is that right ain't no
[57:26] using us fooling ourselves we're
[57:27] Christians and we're
[57:29] not Jesus defeated Satan by the written
[57:33] word showing that it could be done the
[57:37] things it to that brings it to the baby

[58:18] power but he didn't he used the word he
[58:22] said it's written men shall not live by
[58:25] bread alone but by every word that
[58:27] proceeded out of the mouth of God and he
[58:30] stood there uh three times and defeated
[58:34] Satan all three times three it's the
[58:37] confirmation of a witness amen he

[1:06:38] strength is in thee whose heart are the
[1:06:41] ways of them listen in the message amen
[1:06:45] Israel in Egypt he says without the
[1:06:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost he said you're
[1:06:50] lost you won't have to worry about
[1:06:52] getting to Heaven if there is nothing in
[1:06:55] here

[1:07:21] isn't in there the spirit of God inside
[1:07:23] will un unhinge the door got to have the
[1:07:26] thing in here to unlock it Yonder that's

[1:13:26] the most to you that's
[1:13:29] right a
[1:13:31] sacrifice is not a
[1:13:34] sacrifice unless it's something
[1:13:38] connected or so much so it will be
[1:13:44] painful remember brother bandam talk
[1:13:46] about little blind
[1:13:48] Bas is it blind botus had his little uh
[1:13:52] cni ey sheep
[1:13:55] and blind B said to God if you heal my
[1:13:59] daughter is that right he said I give
[1:14:02] you this
[1:14:03] sheep and now we wouldn't have known
[1:14:06] this about except a prophet told the
[1:14:08] story amen and then you know he comes
[1:14:10] along and he says listen he said the
[1:14:12] priest said blind M you can't give this
[1:14:14] sheep to how you going to see H H this
[1:14:19] sheep has been loyal to you he said I
[1:14:21] didn't promise God a
[1:14:24] sheep I promis God this sheep see so
[1:14:28] understand if God did it to Abraham cuz
[1:14:31] God had Abraham Isaac was Abraham's
[1:14:36] sheep he was his his love his listen if
[1:14:39] God would have taken ISAC amen from
[1:14:42] Abraham there would not have been
[1:14:43] another reproduction of his
[1:14:45] seed Abraham would have been
[1:14:49] dead so it meant something there was a
[1:14:51] connection there had to be something
[1:14:54] given and I'm going to tell tell you
[1:14:55] something the greater the sacrifice the
[1:14:57] greater the reward amen hey God don't
[1:15:00] want some of your life he wants all of
[1:15:03] your
[1:15:04] life and that's the thing you and I
[1:15:06] that's the greatest of all sacrifice
[1:15:09] because most human don't want to give
[1:15:11] God all you want to give him some and
[1:15:14] some will not make
[1:15:16] it he must have all or none at
[1:15:22] all is that all right amen so blind
[1:15:25] Mount
[1:15:27] ofus offered up that Lamb with
[1:15:32] Thanksgiving not knowing that Jesus the
[1:15:37] true Lamb of
[1:15:40] God was going to pass his way Hallelujah
[1:15:43] let me say it like this see that's what
[1:15:45] you don't understand the prophet of God
[1:15:46] said it like this God will owe no man
[1:15:49] nothing if you give God God will give
[1:15:51] back to you with interest amen

[1:15:59] investment so what happens amen he gave
