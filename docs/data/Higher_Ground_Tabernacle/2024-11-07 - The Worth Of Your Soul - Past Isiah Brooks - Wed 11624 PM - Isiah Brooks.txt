[Music] name amen hallelujah we're just going to go right on into the word of God thank God for his grace and his Mercy amen amen amen you love the Lord I trust everybody has still enjoying what God gave us on the weekend those are the kind of services I like praise the Lord as we stand we're going to ask that you turn with us to First Peter the first chapter I'm sorry yes first Peter first chapter we're going to read the 18th and the 19th verse 18th verse for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversations received by Traditions from your fathers but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot Philippians 3 pH we'll read there beginning at the 14th verse down to the 17th verse but all that is said in done I trust that nobody ever forget the message of Grace pre brother uh preached to us this last weekend amen amen beginning at the 14th verse of Philippians 3 it reads I press toward the mark of the prize of a high calling of God in Christ Jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if anything ye be otherwise minded God shall reveal even this unto you nevertheless where to we have already obtained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing amen amen 17th verse Brethren be followers together of me and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an example let us pray father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for your goodness and all that you have done for us Lord at at the end of the day you will be all that we would have even as job said naked we came into this world but father God your Prophet said that we will not leave out here naked that we will be closed by the character of Christ and even as Paul desired it Lord he desired to be clothed upon so Lord this is our Earnest desire to be in a position where your mercy and Grace would clothe us and therefore we will appear before you clothed and not naked we ask these things in your name Jesus Christ am amen you may be seated we appreciate everybody here tonight you know I'm the kind of person if I could have church every night I would nor when I say things like that it it makes people nervous I'm just getting ready for heaven you won't have no dismissal there and like I always hear those old folks say every day will be like Sunday and we'll never have to say goodbye I like to entitle the message tonight the worth of your soul I think often times we we we get so busy uh with our everyday lives and we forget get the cost what it took for us to be free get the person who freed us think about it Jesus said if you be afraid ashamed of me in this adulterous generation he said I will be ashamed of you before my father so you have a choice you either testify and praise God for the Lord Jesus Christ or you find yourself ashamed of him and I'm sure many of time you have left conversations with others feeling like you could have added more to it exed the Lord more one of the things that I do want people to understand in this life is that I am a Christian if they don't know anything else about me I want my neighbor to know I want the people at the grocery store to know wherever I go I want them to know I am a Christian not by putting writings on my back but by the life that I live what is your soul worth many of us we we we we we have no figure to put in that to answer that question with so I hope by the grace of God I'll be able to answer that a little bit for you in the way that God thinks of you first of all the worth of Jesus Christ is invaluable because Jesus Christ was God in flesh and we will spend eternity thanking him for what he's done and what he will be doing in eternity let let me say something to you something struck me in my studying that I had never seen before that God put eternity in me not when I was [Music] saved but this eternity has always been in me when I was born it was there and if I should die it be there for all of us that are truly seeds of God here we are in a natural Fallen body with with with a a a peace of Eternity and even though that eternity is in us we'll never come to understand it all Hallelujah think about it that when you were born you were born with the attribute of God in you Satan wanted to rule you he wanted to own you and in in reality he was the God of this world and you were his property but the truth of the matter is you were God's Property before you was his property and you only became his property because Adam forfeited his rights to you could not redeem you only one could redeem you and that was God himself thank God for Calvary the man who paid the price Jesus Paid that price at calary and when he paid that price he took back the title de in other words he he claimed his ownership and that was you you understand me God had trees flowers and everything like that those things even exist in heaven hallelujah hallelujah but you see what God came for he he he he came to pay the price for you and for me he came to redeem his sons and daughters now you got to see what I'm talking about your soul to God is priceless now I'm read a quote by Brother Bram in just a minute but think about it when Jesus was suffering for your sins the Bible said with his stripes we will heal meaning that all that he went through was for you and me y understand me how can we forget what he's done for us we sing that song how can I forget done for me because if we could REM know what he did for us that's why brother brandham says every believer needs to go to Calvary you need to see what Calvary is all about you need to understand that no other Mortal man could have done what he did Feed Me From Slavery see you got to understand your benefits a lot of times people are Christians but they don't understand the benefits of being a Christian when you are a Christian you have been born free right before you was a Christian you were slave to sin whatever the devil told you to do you did you was in bondage many times you didn't want to do it but you did it anyhow Hallelujah but only the price only the blood only the power of the blood could break the chain slavery as our brother preached Jubilee to set you free the Redemption cost was the total of sum all creation think about it nothing on Earth could measure up to that cost not to redeem man not to redeem man nothing could redeem man nothing on Earth because through sin everything had become defiled think about it the animals didn't sin but yet they must die Hallelujah the weather but yet it must change from life to death summer winter spring and fall these four seasons amen amen is a is a um reflection of the fall of Man brother Bram in the Oneness of of unity 1958 January 28th paragraph 154 he said this is a great moment this moment will be will will seal the destiny no doubt of many he One Soul worth 10,000 Worlds how great is this moment I thought about that and and no way I'm going to go through all the the the the the the the many people that are living in the world today come on and these figures doesn't account for those that have come and died but I'll say it in a roundabout figure India has 15 billion people China has about 14 billion United States has 345 million Indonesia has 283 million now now think about that and each one of those souls are worth 10 worlds even your mind can't even calculate it there is no dollar system that can pay for the souls of these people but I want you to understand Jesus died for the world can you put that in your mind I'm talking about every soul from the beginning to the end his blood paid for it now they they're not all saved yet when the blood of Jesus struck the ground his blood Justified Every Soul Hallelujah huj and the reason why people are not saved because they will not accept what Jesus did on Calvary hallelujah hallelujah but his blood was rich enough to pay the entire bill y'all hear me think about it his blood was so powerful that the souls that trusted in him innumerable is that right John said I saw a number that no man can number y Understand Me by One Man by one blood he paid the price for all think about it Hallelujah no gold no silver pay for you Hallelujah but precious blood of Christ Hallelujah the blood has never lost his power it never will one of the things that I love about this it makes my mind just go like wow amen and if you can't include yourself in one one of those numbers number that cannot be numbered somewhere you got to be in there somewhere I I got I must be in there somewhere hallelujah hallelujah thank God for the grace of God hallelujah hallelujah we must remember that we did nothing to earn the robe of righteousness you were invited to the wedding and he had a por at the door [Music] and all you had to do was show up Hallelujah is that right and he said my sheep will hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow now I don't know about you but the voice that called me called me to a wedding he somebody it called me to a wedding I answered the call Hallelujah when I got to the door when I came to the door he put the robe on me what is that robe his robe his robe of righteousness right the prophet of God said everybody is the same whatever you was or whatever you is you covered by the Roe somebody help me here right and when the master of the wedding came he didn't say to the man who got in there why didn't you live a holy life he said how did you get in here the Garment hallelujah hallelujah see it was the robe he was looking at it his righteousness he's looking at not your righteousness his righteousness and as long as you got on his righteous you won't be kicked out hallelujah hallelujah glory to God see I see the goodness of the Lord therefore I will always worship him all my being Psalm 23 and6 it says surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life now I don't know about you but I believe that that's the only reason why I'm here tonight is because his goodness and mercy has followed me Hallelujah now listen the brother preached on Grace and I'm talking about Mery Mercy is when you know you're guilty you did it God par you Hallelujah why does he pardon me why does he pardon you because you have been favored by God hallelujah hallelujah and listen what he says because of his goodness and mercy I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever hallelujah hallelujah you said well wait a minute brother what are you talking about let me say it like this David knew what he was talking about David take took nabal's wife her name was Abigail hallelujah hallelujah now tell me if he wasn't guilty he was guilty he had the man kill [Applause] but God never took D his position away Hallelujah God so honored [Music] David that he literally calls himself the son of David Hallelujah but what was that God's goodness and mercy following David this is why he said I will dwell in the house of Hallelujah huj is that all right that's that's about you we make our mistakes but when you have been chosen by God oh oh don't get me wrong God will chasen you he will spank you but he can never take your position away from you hallelujah hallelujah cuz he placed you at bride before the foundation of the world nothing can take that away from you hallelujah hallelujah thank God for the blood of Jesus thank God for the man who could pay the price hallelujah hallelujah he counted listen David did another big big big big thing God told him not to count the men of Israel count sold Hallelujah and David counted the men of Israel against the desires of God hallelujah did God just cast him away God said you going to get a spanking for that look at God look at him look at he said I'm I'mma let you choose what what what what you want you know parents have done that right you either stand here get a spanking or I'm going to make you stay in the house for so many days hallelujah most most of us say give me the spanking right because we like going outside seem like that that's more more of a punish than anything else but David said God said do you want the men men to judge you do you want men to judge you or do you want me to judge you says Lord I I'd rather for you to judge me Hallelujah cuz men don't know how to have mercy I know you and your mercy endures forever hallelu don't let me fall into the hands of man Lord let your mercy forever be with me you know that's what we do even in church but I give hallel but David understood that God was God is that right God tried him with the lion God tried him with the bear God tried him with Goliath and I love this whenever you place in a trial the trial is not just for you the trial is to give God the glory Hallelujah come on somebody think about all the people that were stricken with cancer and God healed them they had to suffer but the healing was for the unbeliever and the make believer so that they would know that God is God understand me the Bible said every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess to the glory of God the Father you understand me Jesus Christ is Lord what about Shad it wasn't just for them it was the it was for the king of Babylon he was confused he didn't know God God declared himself through those young boys hallelujah what about Daniel wasn't all about Daniel the persecution That Came Upon Daniel was also for the king that he may be able to receive or conceive in his mind that no matter how many gods they worship Daniel's God is God hallelujah and God will do the same thing for you sometimes we suffer so others can see and hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God thank God for the power of God Romans three please don't be so selfish with your testimonies because that's why God send you through trials so you can testify done for and you don't have to necessarily just always testify to Christians testify to somebody who's not a Christian you say well what that what would that do for me RAB heard about what God did in is in Egypt heard it somebody was testifying Hallelujah and were testifying Hallelujah something struck her heart what about the Queen of Sheba somebody traveling through the land of Sheba testify about what was happening over there in Israel and it struck her heart so much so she says I got to see this God that Israel is serving come on somebody see that's what I'm talking about you don't know where the seed is laying and sometime all it take is a testify a testimony and the devil said no no no no the reason why you won't testify because you forgotten the cost you have forgotten your cost what it took for God to free you and it's a selfish thing if you don't want to see somebody else free hallelujah hallelujah none of us deserve this but it's just the grace of God Romans 3 10 through 12 as it is written there is none righteous no not one there is none that understande it there is none that seeketh after God you say I sought the Lord no you didn't God called you God pulled on you many of us would have remained in the world if God hadn't gotten our attention God knows how to get you the Bible said they're all going astray excuse me they go they all going out of the way they are all together become unprofitable there is none that doth good not one so when you get ready to judge somebody else think of this scripture No not one not you and nobody else there only one that's good yeah when the when the Rich Young Ruler said good good master and here was Jesus the son of God is that right he said listen there's only one that's good and that's God hallelujah hallelujah so when you think you have lived a life so good and so right before God take note to yourself the only righteousness you could ever present before God is the righteousness of his dear son Jesus Christ Hallelujah I press toward the mark of a high calling are you pressing tonight Hallelujah you can't stand still and say well I know I'm predestinated I know I'm going to make the Rapture let me tell you something just for a simple way of doing it Enoch was predestinated to make a rapture and what happened an inspiration struck him and he walked with God there was something he was doing he wasn't sitting on the bench on the Pew saying well all I got to do is just wait on it you understand what I'm trying to say the inspiration of this message should be drawing you closer and closer and closer to God the inspiration of this message on your heart thir for Perfection you understand me I don't care how many times you fall you get up and say God I want to be just like you no matter what it takes that's the inspiration of this message it will lead you from glory to glory to glory GL hallelujah hallelujah that's right 12 Luke 12 L 32 fear not little flock for is your father good pleasure to give you the kingdom God don't want us Walking In Fear he wants us walking in faith hallelujah hallelujah I don't fear oh will I be saved I don't fear am I the bride sir because I know who I am hallelujah hallelujah I know it's his pleasure to give me what I desire My bber was my barber the guy that cuts my hair was telling me is just something happening in he said something's happening to me he said I I I I I go to church and when I hear the word he said I start crying he said uncontrollably I said that's God dealing with you sir he said oh I'm coming to your church see the devil has kept him from coming to my church he's going to everybody's Church except here that's what I'm saying but God knows in his time in his time he'll make all things beautiful Hallelujah when when it's ready when it is his time see when you tried everything and everything has failed let that song say try Jesus Hallelujah right for it's the father's pleasure to give you the K Kingdom this is what people don't like though sell that you have provide yourself bags which wax not ow a treasure in heaven that faileth not where no Thief approaches neither M corrupt you understand what he's saying here he's saying give God your all that's all he's saying whatever is valuable to you you give it up he said God ain't going to do that yes he will the most valuable thing to Abraham was Isaac God him you understand me but let me tell you something if God asks you to give up something he's got something greater for you hallelujah hallelujah that's nothing but the truth God say give it up that means he's got something greater and the devil devil will make you think you giving up your best know what your best is what he did Abraham he said Abraham I know you love me now it wasn't that God didn't know he love Abraham God knew it before he chose him but Abraham had to go through those test and TR Hallelujah come on somebody y'all know it's true you don't you've overcome a lot of things but that one thing God said Give It Up give it up you give it up and God going to bless you richly that's the way that's the scripture that's the way he works listen what he says cuz if you love something more than you love God you got to give it up for where your treasure is will your heart be also ly that's the true you know somebody somebody I won't call his name but he said somebody said said something to me the other day that devil is so slick the TV used to be on the floor the TV used to be on the floor television now it's on the wall and we looking up to it like we worshiping he wasn't satisfied with that now he got our cell phone and we now bowing our heads like we pray that devil know what he's doing I'm serious you go everywhere and everybody and I'm sure have problems down the road cuz your neck is not supposed to be like this all the time amen amen may God I hate it but the system pushes us into that kind of a thing but we need to learn how can I say it a balance we need to learn how to control that thing and not let it control us hallelujah oh come on somebody y'all know it's true that thing will rob you of prayer it Rob you testimonies it your time with God takes away it's your truth we got to do something I I say we because I'm talking about me too right Psalms 103 1-8 is this okay I'm going through a lot of scripture but I I trust it says bless the Lord all my soul and all that is in me bless His holy name now maybe I'm wrong but I have been crying out for such a fire till I can't help myself to testify and the praise God Wherever I Go you understand me I don't want my life to be seen anymore I only want God's life to be seen and I can't do it on my own because I'm staying I'm living in this carnal house you understand me but I want to be like Paul says I want to kill this thing every day y'all know what I'm talking about and sometime we let our schedules be so tight that we can't get on our knees and pray before God like we should listen what he said the second verse bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who Health all thy diseases did you hear what he said he said all your iniquity and brother bam said iniquity is when you know to do good and do it it's not don't tell me the devil made you do it when you know you did it on your own blame everything on the devil no it's you and you know what James said it when you're drawn away with luston and TI that a't God that's you it's the truth I think if we can be more honest with ourselves that's how I've overcome a lot of things I stopped blaming the devil and I said God that's me I've done this thing because I like to do it still I find pleasure in it but I don't want to continue this thing I need you to help me hat it I need Deliverance I need a revelation I need to quit but I need to know how to give it up you know when the devil tempted Eve she was standing alone and every time you stand alone or feel like you are alone Satan's coming to tempt you many times he makes you fall because he presents himself as a friend and an associate oh yeah he go down memory lane oh remember when yeah y'all look at me like I'm crazy he knows what you enjoy in your flesh I'm still talking about Grace people I know I'm I don't want you to get away from Grace you'll make the mistakes but the blood of Jesus Christ is coming it out and it doesn't mean that you just sit there and let the devil bully you Hallelujah stand up and be right before God he he done all he knows how to do for you who redeemed that life from destruction fourth verse who crowned thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfy thy mouth with good things so that th youth is renewed like the eagles how many times you've come to church down and out and the word of God comes and feed you satisfy your mouth that's how the eagles eat from mouth the mouth satisfy you with the meat of the word hallelujah and you go there like you can conquer Goliath again Hallelujah Lord executed righteousness in judgment for all that are oppressed hallelujah hallelujah he made known his ways unto Moses ACC to the children of Israel listen I love this the Lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plous in Mercy I'm so grateful that he is slow and slow to anger Hallelujah huj come on somebody you know I I look at us and you know we come to church like everything is all right everything is not all right when you have forgotten what the cost Hallelujah you ever I used to see my sisters with them little diamond rings on and when they get ready to wash dishes they take the diamond rain off I don't know whether it was expensive or cheap but they didn't want to damage it y know because it was valuable you don't wear your best suit out to place soccer it's valuable and you know what it cost for you to get it hallelujah hallelujah you understand me whatever is valuable you treasure it you need to treasure your salvation what is your soul what is your soul worth even as Jesus said what will a man give for his life you understand me that's what he said and you must understand the suffering of this world cannot be compared to the glory now did y'all know that everybody in heaven won't get the same rewards now I don't know about you but I want some rewards that's the word the Bible says set your set your treasure set your your affection on things of Heaven Hallelujah there's a treasure chest I got one over there you have one over there and every Victory you put your in there but if you don't have no Victory I heard I heard um what was that pastor's name now I can't think of his name right now but he said no no no no no he said I want a crown that's right I want something when I get to heaven it was temp he said I want a crown so when I get there I can throw it down if you ain't got no Crown you got nothing to later you know what I mean people say oh I just want to get to heaven no I want to get to heaven and if the Lord car if there's such thing has having stripes on my shoulders stripes on my shoulders the um I mean I mean I mean you know like a a general y'all y'all look at me listen we're in a battle and every battle you win God rewards [Music] you you may not see what you're being rewarded with but they going to be lot of stuff giv out and I don't want to come to the last and ain't nothing given out to me oh it'll still be Heaven it'll still be Heaven you'll still be glad to be there you won't be jealous but no doubt there'll be a moment of regret somewhere and you could look back and said I could have done better amen amen Romans 2 I'm almost done we're not jumping and shouting but you ought to be it's the same word I've just you you I just don't have the uh [Music] Charisma I'm not comparing either but you got to have joy Jo in the word Romans 2 3-4 because I'm going to tell you something I I realize our judging each other in the wrong way has been the greatest hindrance of all as As we judge one another especially if it's the wrong way that judgment is going to come back Romans 2 3-4 and think thou this oh man that judges them which do such things and doest the same that thou shall escape the Judgment of god so let's put it this way cuz a lot of us a lot of us sin by looking at things on TV or your phone look so nobody can see you do that but God sees it and you might see a brother or sister doing something less than that and you judge them for doing that whatever they may be doing not realizing you're doing the same thing and worse because God said if you have pleasure in those that do those things you're just as guilty is that the truth all right think about it or fourth verse or despises thou the riches of his goodness and forbearing and longsuffering is that what he saying this is what he's saying the holy spirit is has goodness he he's forbearing he's longsuffering hell with you and therefore we must be forbearing we must have long suffering hallelu we must have goodness to those who are overtaken those who are coming short what if a woman comes here and she gets saved baptized in name Jes CH but she comes she still got a makeup on still wearing a jewelry you know whatever you know what most of us will do without with that woman we going to go over there and try to clean her Hallelujah you you didn't catch the fish but you want to clean the fish like I always tell people go clean go catch your own fish when you catch when you go witness to somebody and they come in here you have a right to walk them through salvation Hallelujah but how long had it taken you to transform hear what I'm saying well you said I was born in the message but it doesn't mean you didn't slip on pants every now and again am I telling the truth it's the truth but we want people to Justified and into the headu people that born babies and if we saw show them love instead of judgment they would change that's what God wants us you're God on Earth you are the God on Earth we supposed to show his compassion his suffering his forbearing Hallelujah his goodness people supposed to see that through us that's you're the only God they going to see reflection of the Bride reflection of the groom what I right as he is this is what we supposed to be on earth Hallelujah you forget your worth hallelujah hallelujah almost done Psalm 27 I'm almost done I'm talking to me and you and everybody else in here this is for me as well because I'm learning God had to correct me the other day on something I said not individual but but the way I was thinking Hallelujah forgetting that we all are saved by grace washed in the blood some people brother B say it take them a long time to wake up to the fact that they're bride but we can't just look at them like we do Jacob and say no way Jacob could be God's we know we can say there's no way that Jacob can be God's son we look at Esau and say look how good he he he come to church every day he's always on time he's preaching for his dad and bring some powerful services and he was the devil but that guy that was waywood had his time had his appointed time oh somebody help me it's the truth I'm guilty I've been guilty and God is dealing with me you don't like they used to say you don't judge the book by its cover Psalm 27 PSM 1-4 and I'll let you go you love the Lord the Lord is my light what is your soul worth that I want I want to come back what is your soul worth think about what is with a price paid like that and you would walk away from it what will your judgment be huh what if God bought you a million dollar house you didn't like it because it had a red door to it I don't want that house I don't like color the door and you just let it deteriorate and then he comes back and check on you and the house and find out you did nothing to the house you didn't the house all because you you so spoiled you didn't like the door you should have seen my first car it was a chick chick chak likea boom boom CH like boom boom it was old barely could make it but I tell you what I was riding in it like it was a rose Roy that was my that was my car that's right it got me from A to B A B A to sometimes D but it was my car you got to be humble with God and when you thank the Lord for what he's doing they always told me my mama told me thank you make room for more thank you make room for more that's the truth you give a child something they don't say thank you they say you're not going to say thank you give it back they they kept it too the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of My Life whom shall I be afraid now I'm reading this scripture because we don't know what tomorrow [Music] brings Hallelujah I don't mean no harm because the election went the way it went it's still not time for you to relax hallelujah hallelujah you better wake up and smell the coffee God interprets his own wordu this thing can be already interpretated moving to the next segment of what he's talking about and you looking at it in a different way hallelujah hallelujah oh but I'm seeing the coming of the Lord oh my God and and I'm going to tell you like this I know my cost I know what it took for him to purchase me hallel that's why he said I'd never lose one I mean more to him than I mean to myself Hallelujah and my soul is worth 10,000 world my soul alone your soul Hallelujah y'all know what I'm saying oh my as I sang that song mad I'm so glad he missed this Soul he thought he had that's right he wish he had me he talked about me in the beginning he said I will exalt myself the sons are the stars of God hallelujah he did it but the Redeemer came and took me out of the pwn he he took you out of the P he he he intends to keep you out Hallelujah people say you believe once saved always saved absolutely I'm so saved that can't be un amen when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell hallelujah hallelujah though an host should encamp about me this brother bram's raptures message so much is telling us what's going to happen they coming after you hallelujah hallelujah but they won't be able to catch you I believe during that time we'll be walking through walls I believe we'll pass through the crowd and they won't be able to see us and that same God dwells in me the same God dwells in you Hallelujah people well I don't see you doing a lot of Miracles but this is not an open show but God do miracles in my life every day so does he with you Hallelujah let me tell y'all something Sunday Saturday and Sunday was Miracles why cuz Jesus was in the house that wasn't imperson that was the real Holy Ghost and only this message can bring the real deal that's all I'm saying when when when I see people moved by God where they're not in in control cuz that's the way it used to be but now we got and everybody in control the way they moved in yes sir brother say they were jumping out of Windows running up the road screaming he's alive he's alive brother brother brother brother uh Matthew praying and the Holy Ghost hit my daughter the next thing I saw him running and he said to me he ain't never felt so he ain't never he hadn't been that while in a long time yeah so what I'm trying to say people is that we we we need more of that we do we need more of that let's go and let God y' oh oh and I feel so sorry for the men they so Macho wasn't so David wasn't so much he knew what the AR of the Cen coming back meant he

devil make that die I I love that I love it when people are free sheep and you know the thing about it is everybody's afraid to sit up on the front row or close to it but that's where the anointing is when you're in the back you're watching everybody this wasn't in my notes but there it is yes folks the joy of the Lord is your strength you said what are you saying I talked to brother yesterday a pastor he said brother I know it's coming been praying to God that God would not allow me to fear you know it's coming so I won't fear let me tell y'all you can bring a big dog and I have to pray is

was getting charged in brother bam you think he just for his gun because he want to rub the books back no he was going to shoot the thing just to protect his life he was a man and he says something happened that's what I'm talking about when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard that's my benefit those are my benefits Hallelujah let me finish this this scripture then I'll let you go though a host third verse though a ho should encamp against me my heart shall not fear what is he doing he's speaking that word the should Rise Against Me This Will I
