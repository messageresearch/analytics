want to think about too much we don't have to think about too much we've been made whiter than snow amen amen let's just open right into our Bibles we'll open up to the book of Matthew chapter 28 good to see everybody here this morning whether Isaiah is up in Iowa City preaching there read Matthew 28 20th verse speak a message this morning called the divine appointment amen and we'll start with 18th verse Matthew 20:28 28 18 it says and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in the earth go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I am with you always even unto the end of the world amen now let's go back 10 chapters to Matthew 18 verse 18 and it says verily I say unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven again I say to you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven for where two or three are gathered together in my name there I am in the midst of them Amen we all know Hebrews 13:8 says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today a malicious power has in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father I just pray over the service this morning father we just turn it the entire service over into your hands off Laura it's into your hands that we commit everything even our very lives father and our our comings and our goings Lord well we just give everything over into your hands father Lord as you use your prophet told us that you keep every appointment father Lord we have gathered here as I said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord Lorna we have come here into your presence father Lord to enjoy your presence father Lord jehova shamma you said you will be there I am the one I will be there in the midst of you lauren and we just want to thank you for I pray Lord you'd make yourself real to every person here this morning Lord but they might know that truly the God of heaven is in this place at least thank you Lord for everything we pray you'd open up every heart Lord Sabini stony hearts here father you mean it's coming around tradition or for any other reason other than worshiping you father Lord that you would break the chains father Lord and set them free from their bondage Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we we bind to here on the earth Lord asking you Father to bind in the heavens and the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you you can be seeing amen and as I said I want to speak a message this morning called the divine appointment you know brother Branham II he preached that at a message but Jesus keeps all of his appointments amen if you remember the remember the story he's talking about when Jesus was invited to go on down to the Pharisees house amen and and nor for the Pharisee - to make sure that Jesus would be there at the point of time that that he had to send a courier to go and make the appointment with Lord Jesus and this courier as he went he brother Brown kind of gives out the drama of how this man is being sent to seek after Jesus Christ and just think about that this man was well you know grew up he was in the in the service of the of the Pharisee and he had to attend services you know and all the things and he and he was always wanting to be about the Pharisees his master's business and here his master has told him I want you to go and seek after Jesus Christ baby didn't call him Jesus Christ but that is who he was I would go out and seek after this man Jesus of Nazareth amen and I know if I just leave us forever in those shoes if we could transport us back to that time and think about what a privilege it would be if we were told that we could go and seek out after Jesus Christ amen go find out where he is go find out what he is doing right now and go and deliver a message - amen you know if we could be you know in those shoes what a privilege that would be amen so this courier was sent out to find Jesus Christ and I see went out to seek after him you go from say to City Hall is he here no he just left but let me tell you you know you know I was sick but now anyway well anyway because they're everywhere Jesus was he left a trail of testimonies behind him amen even when he went into the town of where there was look where no one would hardly believe there's so much unbelief in the town he says he did few miracles but yet he still found somebody Amen that would give him a witness maybe it's just like this morning you know there's gotta be someone in this you know we don't know your every service you go to some you know seems like the spirit might have more freedom than others but yeah God has somebody that has to have a witness of his presence amen there's got to be someone at any given point in time there's gotta be someone that's gonna welcome him hey man jesus said if you will not praise me even the rocks will cry out amen so when God goes into a church whether he goes into a lively church or if he goes into a stone dead church there's got to be someone that's gonna give witness does something that Christ has done amen and so is it this morning right here all of us have an opportunity you know jesus said where two or three are gathered into my name I will be right there in the midst of them amen we all have that same opportunity right here there were Jesus Christ is here every time we come into this room we have that opportunity to know that we are in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ amen all of us look set that opportunity in different ways amen some will take this opportunity after tradition amen some will will will be thinking in their hearts how long is he going to preach this morning you know some will some will say oh I wish he's on all the wrong songs a sore knee and I can't get into the presence of Laura because because that I didn't sing my favorite song others will come in and they'll hard you have a song in their heart amen others will come in and say this is my chance to hear from the Most High God a man some will come into this room and have their hearts prepared to meet God a man upon the sacred sands of of where of a promise where Jesus Christ have said the very one we've trusted I said I will be with you even in you until the end of the world but if two or three together in my name I'll be right there in the midst of them amen and as brother Branham he gave out this drama he said this courier he said boy I wish I could have been in his shoes I wish I could have been in his shoes if I would have found out where he was what town he was in I would ran up to him I would have forgot all about the message I supposed to deliver to him a man by I fell down at his feet and I have begged out for mercy I would have what like we sung there I would wanted to be washed like snow I would recognize that as being my opportunity that all my sins have been forgiven me amen if I had a sickness I could have been healed if I was bound in chains I could have been delivered if I could have just gotten into his presence that all things be made well amen but this courier as he went to deliver this message that this Pharisee was preparing a meal he wanted Jesus to attend to it that the courier had to go from a city the city seeking out the Lord Jesus Christ amen when he finally found him the courier you know goes up to the disciples and says I have a message for your master and they're yours the disciples say well he's rusty right now he's been really you know tired from the meetings and and you can't see him right now and the courier would say oh no but this this message is very urgent and if I don't get the message across I am I my master will it'll treat me poorly because I didn't fulfill my job I must get my message across a man is so II and so he's given a chance that all of us would love to have and as the disciple says okay you can you can go in you can you can go and he's resting right now but you can go in and speak to him as the courier goes in and he and he goes in and he goes in to the behind the curtain and maybe into the house where they're hiding Jesus because they had to hide him you know in order for me getting arrest they always had to hide him away somewhere so the people couldn't find him because the people knew that if they found him the people knew that if they could just find him they the promises would come to pass in their life amen so the disciples they had to hide him so that he could get some rest because the people were seeking after him so strongly because they were determined that they wanted the promises to come to pass in their life amen so as they are hiding the Messiah Amon as they're hiding the Lord Jesus Christ out in this house somewhere maybe on the border of the city as they we had to throw something over his head and go this way and run that way in zigzag this way is and before they could finally outrun even the the fastest children right amen they hide him inside this house and they and their but somehow this courier finds them and as he's resting then he gets in and slips in to give the message and this is the one opportunity he has it as Barbara said this may be the only opportunity this man will ever have to see salvation and he goes in and all he does is he says my master Simon would like to invite you to a supper at his house and he wants your assurance that you will be there and so Jesus being tired gives out so the assurance I will come and the courier I have done my duty I have done my job I've done all of my master required and he walks out the door walks out potentially into his eternal destination and it walks out the door amen and you know his brother branham you know if you remember sometimes he preached this message multiple different times but but he you know there's times that he would get really emotional as they only preached a message pride 1955 where he got really emotional when he was speaking along these lines he said if I could have had that chance I would have done it if you have just given me that chance to be there to be at the feet of Jesus to be in his presence if I could have just had that chance daven all of us have that chance amen amen just think about they had to hide the Lord Jesus Christ because the people were seeking out after him so much because they knew if they could ever find him that the promises we made manifest in their lives hey Melissa I just wanted to go through some of these promises I don't expect you to be able to turn Dean the script all the scriptures here but but about seven promises I just wanted to read through real quick you know in genesis 3:15 I'm not gonna call every scripture but one of the promises one of the prophecies of Jesus Christ was that he would crush the Serpent's head amen amen who would like to have the Serpent's head crushed in their life I even think about it he the Lord Jesus Christ he was prophesied as this serpent slithers up into your life amens he tries to bring the chains as he tries to bring the bondage as he tries to get you to stumble into sin as he tries to get you to stumble into sickness he says that this this Lord Jesus Christ who has come a man who will crush that Serpent's head a man that's one of the promises amen remember they were running after Christ seeking to see the promises made per manifest in their life amen another promise was was you know just as a t18 that that all in all that in the and this the in Abraham all the nations were blessed by him amen amen also you know when the Isaac was born that he would establish his everlasting covenant in him a man that in this Messiah in the seed of Abraham all nations would be blessed amen who would like to inherit that blessing a man now what kind of blessing did Abraham go have everywhere he went he was led by led by the spirit he was led by the Holy Ghost he was drawn out of his house of idols amen he is washed he was sanctified he was drawn out into a promised land and goes with them everywhere he went amen and those promises are unto you amen he said and I will give you an everlasting covenant another one the promise was Isaiah 9:7 it says and of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end amen his of his a increase of his kingdom there shall be knowing that means if you've ever once had his kingdom in your life maybe if you've ever once had the Dominion of Lord Jesus Christ in your life that demeaning is going to Amen that's going to go from glory and the glory amen and the increase of his kingdom there will be no end what is that a promise these aren't just fairytales amen these are promises amen and they were running after the Lord Jesus Christ seeking to find him so that these promises to be made manifest in their life amen he said Isaiah 7:14 said therefore the Lord himself shall give unto you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Immanuel Immanuel means God with us amen not just the God up in heaven not just the one there's over on the other side of the sea not just the one as there in the holiest of holies but he's the one that he's right there with you amen and not just there with you but he's called you to come come in with me come in like he said uh in Song of Solomon come into me you know seek me where I am amen amen and Isaiah 91/2 says the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that they that dwell in the land of the shadow upon them at light shine amen his Psalms 110 for says the Lord has sworn and will not repent thou thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedek we have a priest has been given to us amen and this priest knows how to handle the sacrifice amen the sacrifice he gave is for sickness it's for sin it's for shame it's for iniquities it's for transgressions it's for nakedness as for being bound amen is for whatever problem we have need of that's what this sacrifice is for and the high priest knows how to handle the sacrifice amen the last one okay this was Isaiah 53 four and five surely he hath borne our griefs if carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken and smitten and afflicted so if we have griefs and we have sorrows Christ died for that amen but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes types we are healed amen so if any of us has any transgressions if a u.s. hasn't even acquittees a man if anybody if he voice has lost our peace amen if anybody has any sickness then he'll sacrifice and the Lord Jesus Christ was well it was fulfilled for you amen amen he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors amen and that's what they were running after to get amen they were running after to have their healing there right after him for their deliverance amen amen he and he gave us these promises now I want to speak this morning on the divine appointment brother Branham said that Jesus Christ keeps all of his appointments all of his appointments every single one of them they meant Jesus Christ brother Branham he said this little oh he says Jesus keeps every appointment he even leaves glory a little early so he can get here on time hey man just to paint the picture for you he even leaves glory a little early so he can get here on time Jesus Christ is interested in being here this morning amen Jesus Christ before we even woke up this morning Jesus Christ had on his mind that he needed to be in this room by the time two or three gathered in his name because all of heaven and earth is hanging upon every word of God and he could not let that word fall so when Jesus Christ made the promise as men of old were moved by the Holy Ghost to write down the things that Jesus said or write down what the Spirit was telling them and they wrote down the jesus said that wherever two or three are gathered in my name I will be there right there in the midst of and all of heaven is behind that Scripture come to pass so we know we can look around this room my natural eyes do not declare or see that the Lord Jesus Christ is here but let me tell you actually my natural eyes do declare now when your natural eyes have been given over to be bound by the gospel to be bound by the Spirit is my natural eyes have glanced over this verse where it reads where two or three are gathered in my name there I'll be right there in the midst of it so then even so me my eyes they don't see a man in here with holes in his hands or with a white garment on him but by by the very fact I had the scripture open in front of my eyes have read the scripture and that has gone into my mind and I and it's gone down and there's something down in my soul that believes that scripture hey man that's how this gospel is there's something down in our soul that it is not it's not unbelief but it's bleep hey man brother Branham said that there's only two things in the soul amen there's there's either faith or unbelief amen you either believe or you don't believe a man so when you - so with this so the scripture runs across the heart of a true believer you're either believing or you're disbelieving now the Bible said that that where two or three are gathered in my name right there that I'll be in the midst of hey man I see so here that was a witness at their baptisms amen where they are baptized I now baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and what two or three will bind on the earth the Bible says I will bind it in the heavens amen so as we as we bind a minute the people in the water and they're in agreement I am dying my sins I am dead to the past and I'm a live unto Christ Jesus amen we're binding that here on the earth Jesus says I'll take that same thing I'll bind it up in the head of a man who says all you even write your name upon your my name in your forehead Amen so we are gathered here in his name a man who there's more than 2 or 3 rows and we've gathered right here in his name that's why we treat this room with sanctity hey man that's why we come in here with the humblest we don't coming out here out of tradition hey man we all come out of here with thoughts evil one towards the other but when we come in here we we forgive one another hey man we all hold grudges against another we all say oh this person should have done this a little bit better or this person that on this a little better or I wish so-and-so would do this or so-and-so do that no but we have forgiveness one for the other amen we wash it to each other's feet amen day by day if we aren't doing in the natural we can still do it in the spiritual where are we washed our brothers and sisters speak amen the iffy the dirt of the world gets on their feet amen we know that Christ sorry wash their soul but but we'll wash one another's feet amen amen things that maybe Satan would tempt us to blame one another for we say no we we resist that thought amen we wash our brothers and sisters feet why because we know that when we gather into this room amen we're gathering in his name and we don't want to come into this room being found having grudges one for the other because we're in divine presence amen we came in when we came into this room we were coming into divine presence Amen why because we made an appointment with him there's a divine appointment where Jesus Christ said I will be right there in the midst of you he said where two or three are gathered in my name I will be right there in the midst and here we are so here he is hey man I just wanted to as you know when when when that courier went to chase after the Lord Jesus Christ he had to go from city under city looking for him and everywhere he went after Jesus left the city he left behind two different types of people those that were driven away in unbelief and hardness of heart and those that were set free I know those that used to be bound were loose a man knows the the poor had the gospel preached unto him amen those that were in in prison were released from their sins they meant aiming because he said the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel he is ignoring me to prutte to loose the bounds of those that are in prison they meant so where that Kerry went he just finds somebody that Jesus had touched a man the same thing this morning when we leave service this morning there's me somebody that Jesus is such a man there's gonna be somebody that chased after him the same way that career did but instead of just trying to do some natural thing you chased after the Lord Jesus Christ because you had something upon your heart a man you had something a reason for chasing after him amen - if you chase after Jesus Christ has got to be a reason amen you got to have a reason down on the inside a man there's got you you need something from him or you just want to thank him for something that he's done for you or you want to praise him for things that he's brought you through or the goodness he's given in your life amen or the or the or the blessings they've given in your house amen amen or for saving your soul and you were lost amen you don't have to be one of these drug addicts out on the street anyway you don't have to be lost in sin and iniquities you don't have to be you know that why because Jesus Christ has set you free Amen so he gathered in this room to thank him for those things amen amen amen you know we feel like we were separated by time you know 2000 years maybe we've been separated from the from the the blessings of his presence well that's not true he said I will be right there in the Mississippi you know in st. Paul was writing the book of Hebrews and the Bible says as men and old were anointed to write the gospel as the Holy Spirit move upon them to write and as st. Paul began writing he brews chapter 13 that we call it Hebrews 13 and as he started writing verse 1 verse 2 verse 3 he got down to the fifth verse the sixth Merson well he started writing and he finished writing the chapter or verse seven and all sudden the Holy Spirit moved upon him he says tell them tell them not in the same yesterday today and forever tell them so that they will know break right here in the middle of this thought your favor notice that scripture doesn't really doesn't really seem to mesh too much with the stripper's before the scriptures after you try to place you like what does the scripture doing here but the Holy Spirit moved upon the apostle that is he is writing out verse seven the hoist spirit all sudden moves down into the room tell them right now tell them that I ain't gonna be the same yesterday today and forever hey man when we read that scriptures we take it to heart we say Jesus Christ will be the same every day maybe I saw this day and might May 2018 that that prophecy has to come to pass that he'll be the same right now amen otherwise the scripture will fail but just like it was back then and so is it now every city that he went into it drove a division of some that believed and experienced his presence the blessings of his presence and some their hearts were hardened brother Brian said every church service you go to you either be closer to the Lord or you'll be further away from him a man so every single one of us just because we came into this room into divine presence will leave out this door here and a little bit of time we'll leave out that door right there when we go through those curtains we're there to be closer to the Lord than we came in or will be just a little bit further away a may will there be like that courier who had a chance to throw his feet at the Lord Jesus and speak or will be like the woman who was the alabaster box a man we think our when he got when that when the when Jesus kept his appointment and he showed up at Simon's house Amen as he said that he wasn't greeted he wasn't loved he wasn't treated right and he set off over in the corner with speed unwashed and he's sitting there with dirty feet and as that woman of ill Fame we've had saw that she went and bought the alabaster box and spent all her living you know on the Oh on the precious ointment and she went into the room and as she knelt down behind him and she was trying to could she was trying to hear how to get the Box open and she's got frustration she just broke the thing open and and and and and it started anointing his feet and wiping his feet with her heron and she all sudden everybody in that room was in the midst of a worship service I meant suddenly when that when that odor of that of the present says you'll is that that only had been in our box I don't know how long but however long it in that box that that pointment had been mixing and impregnated the molecules of the air inside that box so thick it's so heavily with the ointment that when the box broke open that the that the atmosphere inside that box started floating through the entire room and all sudden they started smelling the odor and they recognized that that was an expensive floater that was an expensive price this woman is giving her all to this Jesus and everybody was all sudden thrown whether they wanted to be or not everybody he was suddenly in the midst of worship service amen but you know only two could enter into that worship service the whole room was in a worship service but in reality when you look back with with spiritual eyes everybody else just fades away because there was just the woman and her Savior a man it's the same thing at every worship service that we have in this room every single one without fail amen every single worship service in this room happens just like that hey man you may not realize that you may not recognize it but every worship service I don't care what you think about the worst service every worship service that we have in this room happens exactly the same way there is no difference none no difference at all it's a gathering together in a room hey man there's two or three are in his name amen to the presence is here amen and as people begin to worship the presence but the problem is as some people get locked outside of the worship service and some people get locked on the inside of the worship service amen it's a divine appointment that Lord Jesus Christ has made I will be right there in the midst but some get locked on the outside because they just cannot seem to to to break through that darkness I can't seem you know all the darkness that they've allowed in their lives of the things that they've watched the things that they've heard the things that they've allowed across over their minds and as they come into the worship service they get locked on the outside because they can't seem to to surrender themselves to the Lord Jesus Christ so as the worship service goes on as people begin to enter into the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ they're stuck on the outside because they just don't know how to worship their Savior they they don't know how to worship their Savior they they don't seem to recognize all that he's done for them they don't know what he's capable of they've allowed some thick blindness to come over them and they don't realize that they're in the presence of the one that created the heavens and the earth and they don't realize that they're in the in the presence of the one that created the earth that they stand upon that created men and women to love one another a man that created a family is to care for each other they are realize that they're in the presence of the one that that created men and women to have fellowship in the gospel anyway they'll realize that they're in the presence of the one they created men and women to come and worship Him in a Garden of Eden and they're there in the presence of that one that did all those things and yet they can't seem to find themselves to get into the prep the Garden of Eden they can't get into his presence safe they don't recognize they've become blind they've become that their eyes are blinded to these things and all sudden they're locked on the outside of the worship service the time hasn't changed that carrier when he when they he went from city to city he found out that Jesus Christ was the same in every city as that carrier went looking for Jesus Christ he heard similar testimonies the Lord is a healer the Lord is the deliverer the Lord will set you free the Lord will do this the Lord he is the king of he is a king we've been waiting for he is the Messiah amen and he's coming the East kasaya then we the way for us here and as he heard testimony after testimony he found out that Jesus Christ was the same in every city amen amen some to a greater extent some to a lesser extent the baby how he was received but no matter how well he received or how lil here's receipt even in the city were with a little smallest amount of faith the Bible said that he did few miracles that means that he did something Amen as so is it the same this morning a man there and there may be few believers here this morning there may be many believers here this morning and maybe there's people with their eyes wide open and maybe there's many with their eyes closed but guaranteed somebody because of the presence of Lord Jesus Christ in this room somebody's gonna get something amen it may be many it may be few I don't know but guaranteed Jesus Christ is here he's in the city Amen if that courier would have followed him from that city over to this city he would find out the same thing the same testimony Amen we guess Christ is here and when Jesus comes he heals when Jesus comes he delivers when Jesus comes he sets free amen when Jesus comes he he binds up the brokenhearted a man because he said the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me to bind up the broken heart a man so if you're here and you are bound if you're here and you have the chains on you if you here and you are blind and cannot see and cannot recognize his presence can't feel it realize that he's in the room if you're here and you and your brokenhearted and you can't can't seem to get yourself out of this oppression but let me tell you that Jesus Christ is here a man because he's here he's going to be the same Amen but it's up to us will we chase after him like that courier did we chase after him like the children they were running after him in the streets amen amen he's the same yesterday today and forever the Saint Paul wrote a minister to the Book of Amos they may want to read a few scriptures here from Amos chapter 4 and then also from Amos chapter 5 Amos is the four Obadiah draft of the book of Joel Amos chapter four verse seven and eight says and also I have withholding rain from you when there are yet three months to the harvest and I caused it to rain upon one city and caused it not to rain upon another city a one piece or field one piece was rained upon and the peace whereupon it rain not withered and so two or three cities wandered unto one city to drink water but they were not satisfied yet II have not returned unto me saith the Lord a man will go on to Amos chapter 500 minute but but what Jesus what Lord saner is he picture you know three or four cities in the land and God by His divine mercy and grace he allows its rain upon one city but at these two cities over here rain dry and so this city over here will be rejoicing for the blessings of the rain and he is three months to the harvest when the really start growing into his strength the crop has been growing to its strength and once he's getting the rain and their crops are growing another see he's not getting the rain and theirs are gonna be stunted and wither and die and so the two cities will wander and leave their cities behind and go and look for the city where there's rain so they can get water for their thirst and yet they'll leave a way from there and they still won't be satisfied because their City is still dry hey man so as a soul in a church service when God will rain upon one city they meant one person boy spirit will be one person will just be in tears almost as in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ because he promised to be here and they're recognizing his presence and another city will sit dry and one will have his crops they'll be growing and growing and growing and another will be halted and withering and drying and then after the service the one brother will go and talk to the other brother out in the foyer a man began to draw from from from the revival going on the inside and what the one the brother had the rain will be rejoicing in the presence of the Lord amen amen and as you talked to the brother there's rejoicing and you yourself have no rejoice scene in your heart and you walk out the doors to the parking lot and you will not be satisfied because the rain will fall upon one and not upon the other amen but reality the rain is here and it'll fall upon whosoever will let him come unto me amen who saw he said and yet ye have not returned unto me I mean it's not that they didn't desire the rain the diet that a desire for the rain was there amen eat look they are running after the right in it it's not that the desire for the Holy Ghost he asked ever in the room would you like to be revived in the power of the Almighty Holy Ghost would you like to be revived by the spirit of the Living God and also say yes and amen it's not just the desire that's there amen but you have not turned unto me you've not returned unto me amen so it's not just that that you want the rain or I wish the rain of coffee but it's actually submitting and surrender yourself unto the Lord that's how you get the rain and you say that's how you get the rain you say it's not just the wishing so it's not just I hope the rain will come to me I'd like to have some of that Holy Ghost every once in a while I'd like to have that Holy Ghost to my life you know the Holy Ghost you know we we call it that like we say this like a duh and we say this you know though that's like oil and we give all these things it's like this it's like that but for all that it's not a duck it's not oil the Holy Spirit is God Himself amen it's not some inanimate object out there or some something a little bit of energy you can get or some electricity in your life or something like that no this Holy Ghost is is God amen he is the sin he is the same yesterday today and forever Amen you know the questions and answers they ask for the brand once what is this pillar of fire that follows you around and brother Ram says it's God amen Ennis he says it's the pillar of fire that follow the children of Israel in the wilderness amen he says and he's the same and he says it's not just for me but for every true believer a man that will seek after him amen it's not just maybe those that maybe you may never actually see it with your own natural eyes but by the virtue of the scriptures you know that it'll be there amen because he's the same yesterday today and forever and he's made a divine appointment amen amen so two or three cities wandered on to one city to drink water but they were not satisfied yet ye have not returned unto me Amen so though they had a desire for the Holy Ghost but because they would not return unto the Lord to seek his face amen but when you seek his face there's a promise for that or there's not a promise for just wishing and hoping amen amen of chapter five Amos chapter five verse 4 it says for thus saith the Lord unto the house of Israel seek ye me and ye shall live but seek not Bethel nor enter into Gilgal past not to Beersheba for gil gosh is surely going to captivity and Bethel shall come to nought now weren't one of those cities those are cities have had revivals a mint a mint Gilgal was where they were circumcised and when they came into the Promised Land the city of the hill the foreskins they scald it Amen the Bethel is the house of God's bread where God's bread would come down he meant they meant that don't just seek those but seek him right now right here right where you're at seek don't seek him underneath some other tradition of something going on in the past but seek right now where he's at he meant seek the Lord and he shall live lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph and devour and there be none to quench in Bethel amen seek him right now and you shall live amen amen every man is going to have his chance as opportunity in divine presence like the brother preaching a Wednesday about it was preaching about the Nestor there all everyone had their chance before the king everybody had their chance how they would present themselves Amen everybody you you have a chance to show up before the Lord Jesus Christ however you want to you and every church has the same thing they can present themselves on the Lord however they want to do it whatever they want to be when the Lord comes into the room into their service they have that opportunity amen we had the opportunity this morning how do we want to enter in newest presence we can enter into his presence with Thanksgiving we can turn to his prep course with joy amen work and your endear with I hope this doesn't last long today I hope this gets over done I hope it doesn't preach too long I hope that doesn't I wonder what I can do this afternoon for lunch I wonder what we can do afterwards so every one of us had an opportunity this morning of how we wanted to look what we wanted to have on our minds what we wanted to be like when we entered into the room when we went into divine presence because we had a divine appointment to meet him this morning Amen a divine appointment and we all had our opportunity how would we meet him amen amen amen [Music] here on the book of Haggai you remember that they were given the promise they say go back leave Babylon behind go back to Jerusalem rebuild the temple of praise I will take pleasure in it and I will meet you there amen and they were given everything they had need of to build the temple amen and when they got there they started building their own houses and after 16 years asked God sent a prophet to go knock on their door he said it's been now 16 years since you were sent here to build the house of God and you went and you built your own houses and I see your houses are all decked out trimmed out finished have everything you could ever want in a house and yet the house the parts for the house of the Lord God are laying there in ruins and he says go down and get you trees and build this house and I will take glory in it amen every one of us has been as a chance to build our house amen just like the foolish virgins they all had a chance everyone go down and get you Isle you're going to take part of this wedding and you have one thing to do in this wedding and that has to shine light from here all the way to the door amen that's the one job that they had to do at the wedding was there to have lamps and there to take their light and there to shine light from where they're at to all the way to the door where ever they heard the voice coming but when they heard his voice there to follow that voice and go all the way to the door shiny light all the way a man bow and the voice cried out amen many of them couldn't get their lamps to work anymore in Psalms says thy word Oh Lord is a lamp unto my feet and a light under my path a man and they couldn't get the gospel to work for him anymore I mean they couldn't point out any of the scriptures they were alive in their life a man there was no flame on this thing it wasn't living in their life there there was nothing about this that was alive in their life a man so when the voice came out and the cried go ye out to meet him some had this living in their life and some did not have this living in their life and those that were living we're able to shine light all the way because not only did they have the word but they had the anointing of the Holy Ghost that comes upon the word it makes it manifest in their life and those are the ones that went in after a man but those that had this sitting on a bookshelf in their life and they couldn't come and give the testimony of when the holy was anointing the scripture in their life to bring the testimonies is something that God is doing in their life hey man those did not go in the rapture because they had no testimony of the Holy Spirit anointing the word in their life amen amen God and God sent all of us here to get oil in our lamps to gate to keep our wicks clean clean and clean Trent Amen so we could shine light all the way to the wedding and that light is the light of the gospel and it's the light of the acts of the Holy Spirit in the church amen and if we're not shining that light then how can we say that we are we are looking forward to a divine appointment of a rapture a man because there's more than just the divine appointment of a church service that's just one measure of appointment there are other appointments that God has made with us amen let's just turn over to first Corinthians 15:52 amen he he said where two or three are gathered right there I'll be there in the midst of them but the but there isn't necessarily a promise that you will be you'll be filled with the Holy Ghost in that scripture amen he just said I'll be there in the midst of them it's up to you how you will receive him when he comes Amen it's up to you how you will receive him when he comes Amy like I said once say you'll have rain one city well they they're just shut off from the rain and me people have their own little umbrella so the rain won't get on them amen some devilish umbrellas they've allowed in their lives Amen but there's other promises of a rapture of a meeting in the air first Corinthians 15 he says verse 50 he says now I am first 49 I just start there he says as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly that's a divine appointment amen amen I am waiting for that appointment to be sure not just in my spirit buying this flesh I'll bear the heavenly amen and now I say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God therefore because that promised a mint on the auspices of this promise I have rejected my own natural flesh and blood and have sought the holy spirit of living God amen and not just saw but clung on to I didn't go into Bethel I didn't go into Gilgal I didn't go into the similes of God I didn't go into this or into that by win to the Lord Jesus Christ said fill me with your Holy Ghost amen amen because I knew that flesh and blood could not inherit the kingdom of God I need to have something beyond just flesh and blood amen so flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither does corruption inherit incorruption but behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed a man there's another divine appointment that there will be people standing on the earth they men who will not go to sleep they'll not go down to this earth but they'll be standing on their own two feet and they'll begin to be changed they may not just from glory and the glory but into that body ain't meant that in a moment in a twinkling at winkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound the dead the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must has - absolutely has to put on incorruption and this mortal must absolutely must come to pass must put on immortality amen and that's when death will be swallowed up in a victory amen it's a divine appointment that God has made us he's staying right here in the midst of us looking at every single one of us and marking down who is saying Oh Lord let this prophecy come to pass in my life oh lord give me Lord take away my flesh and blood take away my own human nature take away all of this Lord and I pray Lord fill me with your Holy Ghost because you've made this divine appointment with me and lord I know that I can't go to heaven the way that I am right now Oh Lord I got to be changed I gotta get that gotta be changed I gotta have this change on the inside so I can have the final change in a moment in a sea as a divine appointment it's waiting for us Amen it's waiting for us and we got to have it amen and the president says the Lord he's right here in the midst of us amen if also you start filling the presents the Lord on your heart it's not that he also just showed up no it's that you're finally the blinders are finally coming off amen the the echoes of Laodicea are fading away amen amen and the eye salve this is working the I said it's working and your you're beginning to get the scales off your eyes you know and all the Laodicean trappings are falling off and Ellison you're beginning to see what Jesus Christ is trying to get across to us that will be changed in a moment in between clean and I amen it's not that he wasn't here Amen but it's now that we can feel his presence amen now our blindness is leaving us amen amen see how easy it is to get blind amen now see how easy it is to be set free amen just as easy is so easy to get blind we're not watching but it's also so easy you know for God to come in and remove the blames he is able amen amen John 14:3 another divine appointment verse fourteen one says let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not told you if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again personally they meant I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also and the weather and where I go you know and the way heal and where I'll be right there in the midst of a man I remember when he I remember when he ascended up into the heavens as they were and he all sudden you as hidden from their sight in a cloud and as they are staring there up in the sky and they were stopped they were halted they weren't doing anything and two angels had to come and said why are you looking up into the heavens he will come again just like that just like you saw him go but going for you only you ain't told the things that he told you do amen amen so the things that he told us to do let's do anything amen he'll come again just like we saw him leave I will come again and receive you unto myself in a moment in a twinkling and I you'll be change it's a divine appointment amen and he's standing right here in the midst of us amen right here in the midst of us and the Spirit of the Lord God is still upon him to anoint you still upon you to to break open if you--if you're blind and can't see this he's still here to break these chains you don't have to like we preached a while back about the ten commandments you know the Bible says you shall not steal you should not commit adultery amen you should not covet something that belongs to someone else amen you shall not lie as the book of Revelation says that though whoremongers and the evil adulterers and all Liars so not enter into they haven't by show going to help man amen well all these things these commandments that were given to us they're not dis Commandments as we preached while back there also invitations a mint you don't have to be a life you don't have to be an adulterer a man you don't have to you don't have to fall into all these foolish things in this world amen because a way has been made for you amen to be delivered from these things come don't don't don't just oh I can't follow it two Commandments I can't see me to do this I can't seem to do this but Jesus some come be perfect as my father in heaven is perfect it's an invitation you don't have to do these things you don't have to be this way my Holy Spirit is here if you'd get the hell bro throw them Braille away and let the Holy Spirit have his way in your life a may say where what two or three are will what two or three will agree touching any one thing on the earth worth if two or three are gathered in my name and they agree on any one thing that whatever it is that I want what you bind here on the earth I will bind in the heavens amen and whatever if there's anything no that's for buying the things amen you know the divine means to fasten with chains amen to to tie it up so they cannot be set free because it is so completely tighten you you can tie something up a person up so tight that there is no way it could ever be fruss if read amen and God said that if you bind something like that here on the earth I will take it an all answer and bind it in the hip amen amen you know like the like the mark 10 9 says what God has joined together let no man put asunder amen if you if you like bind up a boat now if you if you tie up a boat and it floats away then you did a bad job binding amen but it's not so with Lord a few buying something here on the earth he will bind it in the heaven amen so if you say Lord I want to be yours but I want to bind myself with you amen I want to be yours the rest of the days of my life Amen you said in your word Lord that you'd never leave me nor forsake me but you be with me totally today and bind yourself to Christ amen amen when you when you get your into prayer like that then you become a Christian amen he says and whatever you loose on the earth I will loose it on the heavens amen so if your your you know loosen means to take something that was bound by chains or something that's bound by ropes or something that's bound by bandages it was sick a mint or something I was bound by laws or lawsuits or something that was bound by debts whatever those things are amen if you can agree touching any one thing with someone else that you if you can loosen those bindings Amen loose them here by prayer with two or three agreeing that those things we loosed Christ's himself in heaven will agree and loose the thing in the heavens amen it's a divine appointment that he has made with you I meant just like the daughter of Abraham when she was here on the South he said should not this woman be loose from her infirmity on the Sabbath day I mean each of you loosed your oxd away to the watery a man on the Sabbath day why aren't I ought to loose this world away from her furmity and lead her our way to the Living Waters a well Amen that flow freely amen also Lazarus when he came out of the out of the cave he was still bound by his grave plus a man so Christ there on the earth said loose that man and set him free and see in the went and two went and took off his grapples and they were about me as those bandages were taken off amen amen so I st. they with the seven seals they were loosed upon the earth Amen why so all the promises of God be made manifest to the bride of Lord Jesus Christ a man and everything those mysterious creamy plain Amen that he's the same yesterday today and forever Amen so if you were bound by something there's a divine appointment made for you amen if you are sick there's a divine appointment made for you amen if you are bound in chains in your mind or in depression or something like that there is a divine appointment right through here for you and he's right here in the midst of us he's right here in the room Amen so if you're if you're sick if you're unclean if you're having Nikolas and transgressions he is here for you I have two or three agree touching any one thing he said I'll set you free from that or I'll bind that deliverance to you and with you if two or three agree on it here on the earth all binded up in the heavens they said I'll make another a divine appointment for with you that if you be filled with the Holy Ghost of God if the rain alloys barrier is of in your city Amen that I will that I will meet you again and you'll be changed from from this mortal will put on immortality ain't going for an appointment to appointment to appointment to appointment because God has made a lot of appointments with us amen he's made a lot of appointments with us and he keeps every single wonderful amen sometimes we don't realize that he's here but the same Lord Jesus Christ has been now 2,000 years since Jesus Christ walked on this earth yeah he's still here he's in this room right now amen he's in this room right now we can't see with our natural eyes but he's here in this room he's waiting for someone to reach out and touch him reach out and touch the Lord as he passes by he's not too weary to hear your hearts cry reach out and touch the Lord Amen as he passes by Amen let's just stand as we close he has made an appointment with you amen he is the same he said and when I come when I call wherever two or three are gathered and in my name I'll be right there and when I come I will be the same and we have a right an opportunity to draw from that sameness amen so don't be like the one who whose City was not rained upon but turn your eyes towards the Lord seek his face he said if you return to me I will deliver you if you return to me I will set you free if you return to me I I will heal your land amen if my people which are called by my name if they will return unto me and repent of their sins and then I will come and I will heal their land amen and he what you bind on the earth I'll bind it up on the heavens amen and that's what we gather together that's the divine appointment no not just this week but every time we come into this room every time you meet with a brother or a sister amen if they're at a coffee shop where two or three are gathered in it and his name he's right there in the midst of them and the unrecognized presence of the Lord Jesus Christ we didn't realize he was always here how many times have we not realized that he was right there in the midst of us sitting at the table with us as we talked amen we were sitting at the table and didn't realize he was there we came to church has sat in the chairs and we forgot to realize he was there a man we we prayed someone said oh brother would you pray for me we said well yeah I'll say a prayer for you but we didn't realize that we date that he was Staunton Jesus Christ was standing right there saying come right now don't take take the opportunity now he's here don't just say I'll pray for you tomorrow or the next day there's two of you right now and you're in agreement take the time and pray amen amen Tugg why because he's right there we didn't realize that there was a third person right there the unrecognized presence of the Lord Jesus Christ we didn't realize he was there but now we know Amen now we know he's here we know that he's right here amen oh you think about how that is brother Brown said that that courier oh I wish that could have been me I wish I could have been there we talked about the woman with alabaster box he said I wish I could have been in her shoes I wish I could have been there I would have worshipped him I would have washed his feet just give me that chance I would have done I wouldn't if I could just go back 2,000 years ago I would have been right there I could I would have been the one but yeah we're here right now to wash his feet we're here right now and to make him look a man to make him loveable a man to make him feel welcome amen that his presence he's come all the way from glory tonight all the way from glory this morning to be in our presence how will we treat him when he comes amen we didn't realize he was here amen and brother if
