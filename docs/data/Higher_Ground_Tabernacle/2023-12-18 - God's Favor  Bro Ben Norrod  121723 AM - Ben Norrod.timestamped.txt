[59:37] Jesus
[59:40] Christ praise His holy
[59:43] name I want to speak to you this morning
[59:45] the Lord helping us upon God's
[59:50] favor I actually had a different
[59:52] direction I was going to go
[59:56] and just a little bit
[59:58] ago my main boss told me no go this way
[1:00:04] instead he speaks we listen that's the
[1:00:07] way it
[1:00:09] works but we are all as an unclean thing
[1:00:12] and all of our
[1:00:14] righteousnesses plural are as filthy
[1:00:18] rags we do all fade as a leaf and our
[1:00:22] iniquities Like the Wind
[1:00:25] have taken us
[1:00:37] away the word that he uses here for
[1:00:42] unclean means to be
[1:00:45] impure both ethically and
[1:00:50] religiously when you say ethically you
[1:00:52] mean by morality
[1:00:57] no matter how clean a person may think
[1:00:59] they
[1:01:02] are all of us are born off the tree of
[1:01:04] knowledge of Good and
[1:01:09] Evil have you ever noticed that with
[1:01:12] people no matter how bad they might
[1:01:16] be there's always a little bit of good
[1:01:19] somewhere in
[1:01:21] there the worst people on the planet
[1:01:27] just out of nowhere by surprise do some
[1:01:30] little good
[1:01:33] thing on the other
[1:01:35] side those that are
[1:01:39] good no matter how good they
[1:01:42] are there's always some little dirty
[1:01:44] thing hiding in there
[1:01:47] somewhere now that's how we came to this
[1:01:50] world we cannot Escape that part that
[1:01:55] will be with us until the body
[1:01:57] change that's right Rapture or
[1:01:59] Resurrection either
[1:02:01] one only the new birth can overcome
[1:02:07] that that's why people that have not
[1:02:10] received the Holy
[1:02:11] Ghost and they start tipping the scales
[1:02:14] toward being good good good good good
[1:02:16] good
[1:02:19] good this is why Isaiah said no matter
[1:02:22] how good you think you are
[1:02:27] all of your
[1:02:30] goodness is like filthy rags in the
[1:02:32] sight of
[1:02:35] God now if you want to know how dirty
[1:02:37] that
[1:02:39] is filthy rag in the Old
[1:02:43] Testament was the language they use for
[1:02:45] a woman's monthly
[1:02:51] garment through the menstrual cycle
[1:02:56] they looked at God looked at your
[1:02:57] righteousness like
[1:03:01] that the words Amen in case you forgot
[1:03:03] it amen now listen to me you message
[1:03:08] people you cannot make yourself good by
[1:03:11] studying the
[1:03:14] message that's right amen
[1:03:19] uhuh I'm waiting on you
[1:03:22] amen uh-huh oh you say it's not
[1:03:24] important yes
[1:03:26] it you cannot make yourself good by
[1:03:30] following this
[1:03:35] message no no no no no no no the only
[1:03:40] way that you become good in the eyes of
[1:03:44] God when you
[1:03:46] die and our birth and
[1:03:49] Resurrection by the blood of the
[1:03:52] Lamb of your testimony
[1:03:55] by the fiery baptism of the Holy
[1:03:59] Ghost if that happens I don't care how
[1:04:02] good you think you
[1:04:06] are God's eyes you're know better than a
[1:04:09] menal
[1:04:15] rag somebody just smile at me for a
[1:04:17] little bit amen uhhuh oh but you say I'm
[1:04:21] a
[1:04:23] Believer by
[1:04:25] who by you or by
[1:04:28] God Amen boy getting quiet in here all
[1:04:31] of a sudden must be hitting home with a
[1:04:33] few
[1:04:35] people tell you plainly I don't care
[1:04:37] what part of
[1:04:39] Africa I don't care what part of
[1:04:41] India I don't care what part of the
[1:04:43] world it is
[1:04:45] in none of us can escape St John 3 and3
[1:04:49] you must be born
[1:04:53] again
[1:04:56] praise the Lord amen that's right let's
[1:04:59] pray over the
[1:05:00] word heavenly father thank you for the
[1:05:02] word of
[1:05:03] God I pray that you will speak to us
[1:05:07] now father May every Spirit com subject
[1:05:11] to your anointing this
[1:05:15] morning every mind and every thought be
[1:05:18] brought
[1:05:21] captive that we might receive what you
[1:05:23] want us to
[1:05:26] receive I Surrender myself to
[1:05:28] you and I Surrender these people to
[1:05:31] you that we by your grace might be
[1:05:34] called your children before we walk
[1:05:36] through
[1:05:38] here and Heavenly Father may you bless
[1:05:40] your word
[1:05:41] now speaker and
[1:05:43] listener in Jesus
[1:05:46] name amen and amen amen amen God bless
[1:05:48] you may be
[1:05:51] seated now let's Jump Right In
[1:05:55] one of the biggest problems that we've
[1:05:56] got around the ranks of Our
[1:06:00] Truth is this
[1:06:02] idea that if you can understand brother
[1:06:04] bram's
[1:06:07] position you can see the
[1:06:11] message but that automatically makes you
[1:06:14] born
[1:06:16] again our girls will learn how to
[1:06:19] dress our men will learn how to
[1:06:23] behave
[1:06:24] they'll follow all of the rules and go
[1:06:26] right by line by line into the rule
[1:06:31] book and when you learn how to follow
[1:06:34] all of the rules
[1:06:38] correctly not only are you co-equal with
[1:06:43] Satan but you're coequal with the
[1:06:46] Pharisees and you're no different than
[1:06:48] Judas was before he betrayed
[1:06:53] Christ being have been
[1:06:56] built to learn how to adapt to certain
[1:07:01] things they've learned in the most
[1:07:05] difficult
[1:07:08] environments how to speak contrary to
[1:07:11] who they
[1:07:14] are to walk and behave contrary to who
[1:07:17] they really
[1:07:20] are and human beings have done that for
[1:07:23] 6,000 years
[1:07:26] because like the animal
[1:07:29] kingdom and animals we
[1:07:32] are just like a little animal learns to
[1:07:35] adapt to harsh
[1:07:39] cold and God's nature will cause it to
[1:07:42] grow fur something like
[1:07:47] that so do human beings in the
[1:07:50] atmosphere of the
[1:07:52] word
[1:07:54] learn to find that
[1:07:57] place where they feel like they've
[1:07:59] obtained salvation and some religious
[1:08:02] move in their
[1:08:06] heart I listen to me message people the
[1:08:09] danger zone of that
[1:08:12] is Satan knows how to lead people right
[1:08:16] into that realm and leave them set
[1:08:20] there you know brother bradam said it
[1:08:22] like this
[1:08:24] he said if you won't do any more than
[1:08:26] just smoke a
[1:08:31] cigarette Satan is not worried about
[1:08:33] making you a drug addict or a
[1:08:38] drunk he knows if he can connect you to
[1:08:41] that little
[1:08:44] Vice that he's got you for the rest of
[1:08:46] your life if that's what you'll
[1:08:49] do you don't have to live in the gutter
[1:08:52] and be a bum for for Satan to be
[1:08:57] happy for Satan to be
[1:08:59] pleased no Satan is
[1:09:02] okay with you being greatly
[1:09:06] religious come right up to the
[1:09:10] edge just don't cross that
[1:09:13] line to where you really authentically
[1:09:16] become a born again
[1:09:20] Christian I know you listen but I'm
[1:09:22] going to need some of you Believers to
[1:09:23] help me for
[1:09:26] Satan doesn't care about whether or not
[1:09:28] you actually move Beyond being
[1:09:34] religious if having like a Bible routine
[1:09:37] of reading the Bible every
[1:09:41] day listening to tapes and
[1:09:45] things I'm telling my age with tapes
[1:09:47] aren't I amen amen Satan doesn't mind
[1:09:50] those
[1:09:52] things he don't mind the you come to
[1:09:54] church
[1:09:56] religiously he's all right with
[1:09:59] that just don't receive the Holy
[1:10:03] Ghost don't move to the place to where
[1:10:05] you really sell out your entire heart
[1:10:07] soul and
[1:10:11] mind if he can keep you religious he's
[1:10:14] happy with
[1:10:14] [Music]
[1:10:16] that you can come to church all you
[1:10:19] want that doesn't even bother the
[1:10:22] devil brother R said when Peter preached
[1:10:25] on the day of
[1:10:27] Pentecost Satan never even got out of
[1:10:29] the
[1:10:31] bed come on now Satan never even moved
[1:10:35] with him
[1:10:39] preaching the greatest message that was
[1:10:41] ever given to
[1:10:49] Mankind in the name of the Lord
[1:10:52] Jesus the greatest message it was ever
[1:10:54] given to the
[1:10:56] church Satan never even got out of the
[1:10:59] bed he slept in that Sunday
[1:11:03] morning said when Peter went down to the
[1:11:05] gate
[1:11:08] beautiful and Divine Healing was
[1:11:10] performed on that
[1:11:13] man that so troubled Satan that it just
[1:11:16] turned him upside
[1:11:20] down why because now it shows that
[1:11:24] something more has
[1:11:28] happened it wasn't just a word and word
[1:11:33] then but the word had become
[1:11:38] deed that's what the devil hates right
[1:11:41] there he don't care how long you follow
[1:11:44] brother
[1:11:46] brandom doesn't bother him a
[1:11:49] bit Satan was in every single one of
[1:11:52] brother Bam's meetings even the ones
[1:11:54] that aren't
[1:11:59] recorded the devil was in every prayer
[1:12:01] meeting brother Bram was
[1:12:05] in Satan Drew close every time brother
[1:12:07] Bram did something for the
[1:12:11] Lord didn't bother him a
[1:12:14] bit until that little Prophet said I
[1:12:16] take every spirit in here under my
[1:12:20] control it wasn't just word for word
[1:12:23] sake
[1:12:25] but the word had become
[1:12:27] deed that's what God wants with you come
[1:12:30] on
[1:12:31] somebody not just a word spoken by
[1:12:36] word but God wants this word to become a
[1:12:39] deed in your
[1:12:42] life just as it was in the church
[1:12:46] ages bam sent out of
[1:12:50] saying the Antichrist sent out of saying
[1:12:54] the white horse rider was just a saying
[1:12:56] at the
[1:13:01] time but eventually spoken words find
[1:13:04] bedding
[1:13:07] grounds the prophet told us the word
[1:13:10] through those ages finally became a
[1:13:15] deed you see even Satan is wise
[1:13:19] enough to know that word only doesn't
[1:13:22] produce anything
[1:13:26] but when the word becomes a
[1:13:29] deed has all the power of what was
[1:13:32] spoken behind
[1:13:35] you that's what the Holy Ghost wants out
[1:13:37] of you and I come
[1:13:39] on not just a word
[1:13:43] spoken the prophet said the prophet said
[1:13:45] the prophet
[1:13:47] said you know every bit of that but if
[1:13:49] it doesn't become an action in your
[1:13:52] life
[1:13:54] then you'll never wake Satan up out of
[1:13:56] his
[1:13:57] bed I don't know about you but I don't
[1:13:59] want him sleeping in on my
[1:14:03] life Hallelujah I don't want him taking
[1:14:05] it easy on
[1:14:08] me I don't want him sitting in the lazy
[1:14:11] chair with his feet kicked
[1:14:14] out I want to keep him up day and
[1:14:20] nightall I want to keep him working all
[1:14:22] day and
[1:14:26] trouble the kingdom of
[1:14:28] Hell amen that's what the bride was set
[1:14:30] here
[1:14:32] for not to just come and speak the
[1:14:37] message listen you young people sitting
[1:14:39] here this
[1:14:40] morning this is a good message for you
[1:14:42] to really get into your
[1:14:45] heart if you're just like me you were
[1:14:47] raised here your whole life here in
[1:14:48] brother B brother
[1:14:52] brother
[1:14:54] but even you are smart enough to see
[1:14:56] within
[1:15:00] yourselves that there's areas of your
[1:15:02] life you still lack real power
[1:15:07] in do you know that God doesn't wants
[1:15:09] you to wait until you're older to get
[1:15:15] that that's the idea when I get older
[1:15:18] I'll understand more God don't you
[1:15:22] understand
[1:15:24] God doesn't need you to develop a deep
[1:15:27] understanding of
[1:15:30] things all he needs is a willing
[1:15:35] heart the understanding will come
[1:15:39] later God can reveal more to you
[1:15:43] later he's looking for someone willing
[1:15:45] to open their heart
[1:15:47] up say Lord let the word become a deed
[1:15:50] inside of
[1:15:52] me
[1:15:54] Satan could come into this room this
[1:15:57] morning could fill every Pew and every
[1:16:00] chair and every spot in this church with
[1:16:06] demons and do you know that wouldn't
[1:16:08] bother us in any way
[1:16:11] whatsoever Satan couldn't harm you
[1:16:13] sitting right here next to
[1:16:17] you because he has no
[1:16:19] power until you act on what He suggests
[1:16:26] what he tells you to do you will obey
[1:16:28] it you know why we obey
[1:16:31] sometimes because there's no strong man
[1:16:34] in the
[1:16:36] house there's nobody on the inside come
[1:16:38] on
[1:16:39] preach to bring you to the place to say
[1:16:42] no
[1:16:45] Satan I belong to Jesus Christ and him
[1:16:49] only will I worship Him will I follow
[1:16:54] but the idea becomes well you know we'll
[1:16:56] just learn the
[1:16:59] message and doing so we feel like
[1:17:03] eventually we'll earn God's
[1:17:07] favor well I'm glad you come to church
[1:17:10] this
[1:17:12] morning I'm going to do my best to light
[1:17:14] my little gospel stick of dynamite
[1:17:19] here and blow that false Doctrine up to
[1:17:22] bits
[1:17:25] let me be very plain with you right
[1:17:28] now there's nothing we can do to earn
[1:17:33] God's
[1:17:36] favor he either gives it or he
[1:17:41] don't that's not based on
[1:17:43] you that's not based on me that's based
[1:17:47] on what he saw before the foundation of
[1:17:49] the
[1:17:52] world so this legalistic
[1:17:55] idea if I can finally live good enough
[1:17:58] and clean enough so God will give me his
[1:18:03] favor number one it's not
[1:18:06] scriptural number two it's
[1:18:10] impossible and number three you'll
[1:18:12] discourage yourself all the days of your
[1:18:14] life trying to do
[1:18:17] it look at your ownselves
[1:18:20] sometimes where do you get the most
[1:18:25] discouraged it's when you
[1:18:27] feel that you should have done
[1:18:30] better but you didn't do
[1:18:33] it right and because of that
[1:18:36] feeling you carry that around in your
[1:18:39] heart all day
[1:18:41] long do you know why we do that because
[1:18:45] we think in our
[1:18:47] minds that if we mess up and do little
[1:18:51] things that Som God Cuts us
[1:18:57] off and that we lose his favor all
[1:19:02] together oh but I got a message for you
[1:19:04] this
[1:19:05] morning God's favor is not
[1:19:09] based upon whether you're good or
[1:19:11] whether you're
[1:19:14] bad your birth in this
[1:19:18] world made you both good and
[1:19:21] bad
[1:19:23] and God said every bit of it is rotten
[1:19:26] to the
[1:19:28] core but he told
[1:19:32] Abraham I can swear by no greater
[1:19:36] Hallelujah Abraham I can't trust
[1:19:40] you I can't trust any of them
[1:19:43] prophets I can't trust any of their
[1:19:46] wives or their kids there's only one
[1:19:50] that I can trust
[1:19:51] h and he said that's me so God said I
[1:19:56] swear by
[1:19:58] myself cuz he could swear by no
[1:20:02] greater so God based
[1:20:04] everything upon
[1:20:07] himself there's no way in the world you
[1:20:09] could live good
[1:20:11] enough to get his
[1:20:14] favor you couldn't live bad enough to
[1:20:16] lose
[1:20:19] it praise the Lord see legal is teaches
[1:20:25] this if I'm a good boy this week I've
[1:20:27] got his
[1:20:29] favor when I'm a bad boy I lose
[1:20:32] it what kind of business you think God
[1:20:35] runs
[1:20:37] anyways if he was that bad at running
[1:20:40] the human
[1:20:43] business if his office was that
[1:20:47] messy and he was that poor of a
[1:20:51] businessman
[1:20:54] how could you put any confidence in him
[1:20:55] as a savior a lord or
[1:20:59] anything but none of this is based upon
[1:21:03] us because when I'm
[1:21:05] bad he is still
[1:21:08] good and when I'm good he is still
[1:21:12] good Hallelujah and it doesn't matter
[1:21:14] what I think about
[1:21:17] it it matters what God says about
[1:21:20] it oh and I know how people
[1:21:24] think well but brother
[1:21:26] Ben are you trying to say we can live
[1:21:29] any way we want
[1:21:31] to that's exactly what I'm telling you
[1:21:35] you can live any way you want
[1:21:37] to you see Christians smoke as much
[1:21:41] cigarettes as they want to
[1:21:45] smoke they drink as much alcohol as they
[1:21:48] want to
[1:21:50] drink they do all the filthy things they
[1:21:52] want to
[1:21:54] do thing of it is when you receive the
[1:21:57] Holy Ghost the want to is taken out of
[1:22:02] it that's why you don't want to do it no
[1:22:05] more cuz Christ is living on the
[1:22:08] inside but Paul said Christ in you the
[1:22:11] hope of
[1:22:12] [Music]
[1:22:13] glory no longer word but it is deed as
[1:22:18] well amen amen amen so when we look at
[1:22:23] God's
[1:22:24] favor we have to understand it is based
[1:22:27] upon
[1:22:30] him not based upon
[1:22:32] us you see I learned a long time
[1:22:36] ago that if a man or woman is Born Again
[1:22:39] of the Holy
[1:22:42] Ghost it don't take much to convince
[1:22:45] them what living right looks
[1:22:51] like truly got Jesus
[1:22:55] here and something comes along in their
[1:22:59] life or they get involved in
[1:23:03] something the sun don't turn too many
[1:23:07] times before the word of the Lord deals
[1:23:09] with their
[1:23:11] hearts and they're right back where they
[1:23:13] needed to be in the
[1:23:16] beginning you see church God is
[1:23:20] determined God is Det
[1:23:23] deted to make sure you don't fall
[1:23:26] Hallelujah it is in his great
[1:23:29] heart to not let this bride fall
[1:23:33] down the Bible said though a man
[1:23:37] fall he will uphold him with his right
[1:23:41] hand the world don't have that promise
[1:23:45] but you and I
[1:23:46] do somebody say
[1:23:49] Amen look in your pocket Now find a good
[1:23:51] Hallelujah in
[1:23:54] there hallelujah hallelujah God is
[1:23:59] determined now I love this in a message
[1:24:01] called God's covenant with
[1:24:05] Abraham brother BR says I've got nothing
[1:24:08] to
[1:24:11] offer well my goodness if brother Bram
[1:24:14] didn't have nothing to offer what am I
[1:24:16] going to pull
[1:24:18] up he so done way more for the Lord than
[1:24:20] I'll ever do

[1:24:25] done in 32
[1:24:29] years and if he didn't have nothing to
[1:24:31] offer God I'm in pretty bad
[1:24:35] shape what about the rest of
[1:24:38] you some of y'all just G to sit there

[1:25:01] and say this is
[1:25:03] me the words got to be taken personally
[1:25:06] if you want it to change
[1:25:09] you if you brought your arrogant Spirit
[1:25:11] to church this morning you just take it
[1:25:13] right out that back door we don't need

[1:25:40] this body right here that I don't need
[1:25:42] this kind of
[1:25:46] preaching right but you see that's what
[1:25:47] we've done in the
[1:25:49] message we've inflated our personalities
[1:25:54] we just keep blowing the
[1:25:58] balloon and our OS get big every
[1:26:03] year bigger and bigger and bigger with
[1:26:06] our
[1:26:08] attitude and before long we're going to
[1:26:10] be worse than the Pharisees
[1:26:13] was we'll be so holy nobody can touch
[1:26:18] us but brother a real Christian
[1:26:21] Hallelujah
[1:26:23] that's ever been at the foot of
[1:26:26] Calvary they remember where they come
[1:26:30] from and they remember where God brought
[1:26:33] them down the
[1:26:35] line God help me never to
[1:26:39] forget where I came from I was a sinner
[1:26:43] by
[1:26:45] birth My Savior and my Lord made me a
[1:26:47] part of
[1:26:49] him Amen brother Keith he took me me
[1:26:52] from the
[1:26:55] rags of my own
[1:26:58] self-righteousness and he put me in
[1:27:00] King's
[1:27:02] robes now I can sing praise

[1:27:14] a
[1:27:18] child never forget where you come from
[1:27:23] brother bam says my utmost
[1:27:29] righteousness next to yours Lord would
[1:27:31] be filthy
[1:27:33] [Music]
[1:27:35] rags so I'm a sinner to begin
[1:27:39] with there's nothing I could do about

[1:27:46] and you get that in your
[1:27:48] heart and I promise you it will
[1:27:50] revolutionize your life
[1:27:54] once we get rid of this idea that
[1:27:55] there's something we can
[1:27:59] accomplish where does that come from
[1:28:02] anyways it's not even preached in the
[1:28:04] first century Church
[1:28:07] age find me show me show me where
[1:28:11] Apostle Paul ever preached such a
[1:28:15] thing show me where Peter or James or
[1:28:18] any of the
[1:28:20] rest that you can make yourself
[1:28:22] something by being
[1:28:26] religious my God children that's the
[1:28:28] very thing that they were preaching
[1:28:31] against that's the very group they were
[1:28:34] standing
[1:28:37] against them religious Jews standing
[1:28:40] there thinking they were so
[1:28:43] holy and had no Holiness in them
[1:28:48] whatsoever as a matter of fact Jesus
[1:28:50] prophesied to them
[1:28:54] that the spirit of antichrist would come
[1:28:55] right through
[1:28:57] them you know that's what rode into that
[1:29:00] first
[1:29:01] age where did that white horse rider
[1:29:04] come
[1:29:06] from
[1:29:08] there the most holy
[1:29:11] city they supposedly the most holy
[1:29:15] people
[1:29:17] crucified the worst punishment that
[1:29:19] could have been given to a
[1:29:20] man
[1:29:24] him the word the prince of Glory the
[1:29:28] Prince of
[1:29:29] Life he who had power in his
[1:29:33] blood They Crucified
[1:29:35] him and that Antichrist on just read
[1:29:38] right rode right on through to the first
[1:29:40] church
[1:29:43] age he come out of that Jewish age and
[1:29:45] jumped up on that first horse
[1:29:49] rider went right through them Jews
[1:29:51] straight to the Gentiles
[1:29:54] can you understand
[1:29:58] Lans that's why that religious spirit
[1:30:01] has followed us from to our
[1:30:05] time we are under the same influence of
[1:30:08] what they had 2,000 years
[1:30:13] ago somebody wake up pinch
[1:30:16] yourself it's nothing but the devil
[1:30:19] bringing
[1:30:20] deception
[1:30:23] God don't want us living blinded to
[1:30:25] these
[1:30:27] things why he sent Elijah in the first
[1:30:30] place was to return our hearts back to
[1:30:33] the original
[1:30:36] Faith hallelujah hallelujah cuz just as
[1:30:40] that first Antichrist
[1:30:44] hode of the holy ghost ride through all
[1:30:47] of them ages
[1:30:50] too amen and the same power same Works
[1:30:54] same same wonders they came right on
[1:30:58] down to you and I in the last day as
[1:31:00] well we the elect are under the
[1:31:03] influence of
[1:31:05] that that's why I shout like

[1:31:17] him I believe the word like
[1:31:20] him and I'm ano just like they
[1:31:24] were amen and you get that through your
[1:31:27] mind the same anointing that had
[1:31:31] Peter preach acts

[1:32:01] blood made God see
[1:32:04] me
[1:32:08] righteous like he is
[1:32:12] righteous so he doesn't see
[1:32:16] [Music]
[1:32:18] me he doesn't Glory Glory
[1:32:22] Glory he doesn't see me
[1:32:25] hallu he sees his son's
[1:32:29] blood glory to
[1:32:32] God thank you Lord oh praise the Lamb of
[1:32:36] God you can understand my friends why
[1:32:39] that
[1:32:41] God wanted to come in flesh like he
[1:32:46] did he knew we didn't stand a chance
[1:32:48] from the
[1:32:50] beginning
[1:32:52] we were losers from day
[1:32:55] one that's why you come to
[1:32:57] church and sit there without any
[1:32:59] anointing or feeling on
[1:33:03] you is because you were born in that
[1:33:06] kind of
[1:33:08] condition friend the answer is not to
[1:33:10] try to fix
[1:33:14] yourself the answer is put yourself in
[1:33:16] the hands of
[1:33:20] God say Here I Am
[1:33:24] Lord all of my raw looking
[1:33:29] ways whether I'm good or I'm bad here I
[1:33:32] am
[1:33:34] anyway and just give that to him let him
[1:33:36] sort out all the
[1:33:38] [Music]
[1:33:41] rest but we try to follow the rule
[1:33:46] book who in here has been able to keep
[1:33:48] all of it raise your
[1:33:50] hand
[1:33:52] I'll make sure my hand don't go
[1:33:54] up so you mean all of us are pretty much
[1:33:57] in the same
[1:34:00] boat uhuh then how come some of y'all
[1:34:02] ain't pulling on the
[1:34:05] word how come some of y'all ain't
[1:34:07] pulling amen huh how come some you a't
[1:34:10] pulling from the word come
[1:34:14] on you know why I got you right in the
[1:34:17] spot you don't like to be
[1:34:20] in
[1:34:23] that's what an evangelist is good for
[1:34:25] you
[1:34:26] know say I don't know nothing about
[1:34:29] you and I can come here and just preach
[1:34:31] the
[1:34:32] gospel now you know what it ain't ain't
[1:34:35] my fault you're the one tells on
[1:34:38] yourself because under this anointing
[1:34:40] You Can't Hide whether you're born
[1:34:46] again the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:48] will tell you
[1:34:50] are
[1:34:52] right even if you don't demonstrate out
[1:34:55] here your own conscience tells you
[1:34:58] whether you know I'm telling you the
[1:34:59] truth or
[1:35:02] not now my question for some of you is
[1:35:04] how long are you going to Halt between
[1:35:06] two
[1:35:10] opinions maybe some of you young people
[1:35:12] just kind of go on along easy with Mom
[1:35:14] and
[1:35:18] Dad but inside your heart you're making
[1:35:20] plans
[1:35:23] making plans for when you get old enough
[1:35:25] to do what you want to
[1:35:28] do me tell you something young man me
[1:35:32] tell you something young lady you ought
[1:35:34] to be grateful to God that you've got a
[1:35:35] little time of
[1:35:40] shelter and if mom and dad's got to
[1:35:42] break your leg every now and
[1:35:45] then Hey listen little
[1:35:48] sheep that broken leg is a lot better
[1:35:51] better than them lions and tigers and
[1:35:53] them Bears that's out
[1:35:57] there so you better start considering
[1:35:59] where your heart is at this
[1:36:03] morning because God is calling on some
[1:36:05] of you right
[1:36:08] now right now to get yourself right with
[1:36:12] God seek him while he can be found of
[1:36:17] you my spirit will not always strive
[1:36:19] with man
[1:36:23] that ain't just young people that's us
[1:36:25] older ones
[1:36:28] too some ofall come in and just string
[1:36:30] along through
[1:36:32] church do you know one of these days
[1:36:34] something will come along strong
[1:36:39] enough it's either going to shake you in
[1:36:41] or shake you
[1:36:44] out so my message for you is choose you
[1:36:47] this day whom you're going to
[1:36:50] serve
[1:36:52] my Bible tells me now is the day of
[1:36:57] salvation now is the time to get your
[1:36:59] heart
[1:37:01] right as for me and my house we'll serve
[1:37:03] the
[1:37:05] Lord
[1:37:07] amenu so I have nothing that I can do in
[1:37:11] it this goes all the way back to Genesis
[1:37:17] 18:3 when Abraham and God have a
[1:37:20] conversation
[1:37:23] God asked Abraham if I found favor in
[1:37:25] your
[1:37:27] sight you see man has
[1:37:30] always worked toward getting God's
[1:37:36] favor but the Lord knew that man didn't
[1:37:40] have the ability to get
[1:37:43] it I mean how could I please a
[1:37:47] God that is so
[1:37:50] holy that everything about me is
[1:37:54] sinful everything about me is
[1:37:59] sin at my very best I am still a sinner
[1:38:02] in this
[1:38:06] body how could I ever find his
[1:38:10] favor he took his son's
[1:38:13] blood and he covered me over
[1:38:16] Hallelujah Hall and because of that
[1:38:19] blood he don't see me no more
[1:38:24] come on somebody he don't see me no
[1:38:28] more he don't even hear my
[1:38:31] voice brother bam said the Lamb of God
[1:38:34] turns to see who's
[1:38:37] praying and he said my voice mingles
[1:38:39] with his
[1:38:41] voice and the lamb speaks on my
[1:38:47] behalf it's not even me speaking
[1:38:50] anymore
[1:38:51] but it's Christ speaking on my
[1:38:54] behalf Glory forgive them Father they
[1:38:57] don't know what they're
[1:39:01] doing even all of my presumptuous
[1:39:06] sins things I don't even mean to do and
[1:39:08] don't know I'm
[1:39:11] doing there's a voice that speaks for
[1:39:15] me Hallelujah Lord thank God for
[1:39:20] such
[1:39:24] Grace now you know in the Old Testament
[1:39:27] in the New Testament excuse
[1:39:29] me speaking of
[1:39:31] Grace you can find it in the New
[1:39:33] Testament 186
[1:39:38] times and everywhere you find the word
[1:39:43] grace is the same word used for
[1:39:46] [Music]
[1:39:47] favor so in essence God's favor is God
[1:39:54] Grace
[1:39:56] hallu so where are my Works in
[1:39:59] that I can't do that can't do anything
[1:40:03] about it I have nothing to
[1:40:06] offer
[1:40:07] Hallelujah the only thing I can
[1:40:11] do is hide myself in
[1:40:15] Christ and if I hide myself in
[1:40:19] him then I don't have to worry about me
[1:40:21] no
[1:40:23] more that's the key to all of
[1:40:26] it now
[1:40:28] remember it can't be just in word
[1:40:32] only if I've got a holy
[1:40:35] heart then my life will follow and obey
[1:40:38] the way my heart
[1:40:41] is you know why some people still do
[1:40:44] horrible
[1:40:46] things chist is not sitting on the
[1:40:48] throne of their
[1:40:49] heart
[1:40:51] it's just that
[1:40:53] simple if Christ is in your
[1:40:55] heart there is no I
[1:40:58] quit you see people just giving up left
[1:41:01] I just give up that Prov
[1:41:04] you because the Holy Ghost is
[1:41:07] there there is no
[1:41:11] quitting I'll ask you a
[1:41:13] question my Bible said he that began
[1:41:16] this good
[1:41:19] work I didn't even
[1:41:22] started so how can I quit
[1:41:26] hallelu something I never began in the
[1:41:30] first he began the work he'll finish the
[1:41:35] work because a seal shows on both
[1:41:39] sides he that started it be he that
[1:41:42] finishes
[1:41:43] it hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:41:46] God
[1:41:47] you amen now you're getting with it
[1:41:50] that's what I want to
[1:41:53] now listen to this in the Book of
[1:41:57] Proverbs it talks about worldly
[1:42:01] favor I'm just going to use this as an
[1:42:05] example the Bible said favor is
[1:42:11] deceitful and in this original word in
[1:42:14] the
[1:42:16] Hebrew this word favor means
[1:42:19] acceptance
[1:42:21] now you think to
[1:42:24] yourself among all of the peoples of the
[1:42:28] world you have this
[1:42:31] handful of people who are visible to the
[1:42:36] world influencers
[1:42:39] and uh uh uh Tik Tock people and these
[1:42:43] kind of things
[1:42:44] TI movie stars and
[1:42:49] singers I was was reading this
[1:42:52] morning that Taylor Swift is worth 1.1
[1:42:56] billion not million billion doll Taylor
[1:43:02] Swift that's just one
[1:43:05] girl she's a
[1:43:08] billionaire she's 31 years old and she's
[1:43:10] a
[1:43:13] billionaire and everybody everywhere you
[1:43:16] hear her name everybody loves this
[1:43:19] girl oh she's so sweet and she's so
[1:43:23] nice now nothing against Miss
[1:43:27] Swift but you let her do one thing that
[1:43:30] the public disagrees
[1:43:34] with and the one that they love so
[1:43:37] much will turn around and become a a
[1:43:42] scandalous thing in their
[1:43:46] eyes favor in the world is deceitful
[1:43:49] said the Bible
[1:43:52] they can love you today and hate you
[1:43:56] tomorrow now come on don't you sit there
[1:43:59] look at me like you don't know what I'm
[1:44:00] talking
[1:44:02] about you let some of these movie
[1:44:06] stars they make these great films that
[1:44:09] everybody runs to go see
[1:44:12] them I take M Gibson for example Gibson
[1:44:16] Mel Gibson was one of the top movie
[1:44:18] stars in Hollywood for many years
[1:44:24] to and he goes out I think he got drunk
[1:44:27] one day or whatever it was he was he was
[1:44:28] he was inebriated in some
[1:44:31] way he goes out there and starts
[1:44:34] spitting out all this garbage against
[1:44:36] the
[1:44:36] [Music]
[1:44:39] Jews and this great movie star that
[1:44:42] everybody
[1:44:45] loved all of a sudden they hate him
[1:44:48] now don't sit and look at me like you
[1:44:50] don't don't know what I'm talking
[1:44:52] about favor is
[1:44:56] deceitful you take some singer or some
[1:44:58] other kind of
[1:45:01] person put them right here in this
[1:45:03] church right
[1:45:05] here everybody could love
[1:45:08] them let them do one thing that people
[1:45:11] disagree
[1:45:14] with all of that favor that they had for
[1:45:18] them disappears in our heart
[1:45:22] number one you know what that
[1:45:25] proves it proves number one I don't need
[1:45:28] your stinking
[1:45:31] favor you can keep it to
[1:45:34] yourself and it means that you don't
[1:45:36] need mine or anybody else's favor
[1:45:40] neither the only favor that's important
[1:45:43] to you and
[1:45:46] I is God's favor to the bride
[1:45:52] L you love me
[1:45:54] today and then hate me
[1:45:56] tomorrow the Apostle Paul even
[1:45:59] said that whenever the
[1:46:03] Galatians first saw the conditions of
[1:46:05] his
[1:46:07] eyes he said you would have taken your
[1:46:10] own eyes out and give them to me if you
[1:46:12] could
[1:46:15] have but he said because I tell you the
[1:46:19] truth
[1:46:21] now you seek to kill
[1:46:23] me that's worldly
[1:46:26] favor see worldly the favor is based
[1:46:30] upon
[1:46:33] conditions but allow me to say it one
[1:46:36] more
[1:46:37] time will you let me say it will you
[1:46:40] listen to me if I say it how many you
[1:46:43] hear me if I say
[1:46:44] this amen God bless you for that God's
[1:46:48] favor is not BAS based on
[1:46:54] conditions whether I'm a good boy or a
[1:46:57] bad boy it matters
[1:47:00] not if I am his
[1:47:03] child God loves me
[1:47:08] anyy to
[1:47:13] God Amen so I don't have to concentrate
[1:47:17] so
[1:47:19] deeply
[1:47:21] oh I I I had a bad thought goes through
[1:47:23] my
[1:47:27] mind what does that matter to an eternal
[1:47:32] God who saw your thought before thoughts
[1:47:34] ever
[1:47:38] began oh I like that before there was a
[1:47:40] brain to
[1:47:43] think woo hallelujah hallelujah before
[1:47:47] there was a brain to do any thinking at
[1:47:49] all
[1:47:52] before there was a thought to
[1:47:54] think God already said I know your
[1:47:59] thoughts and your thoughts are not my
[1:48:03] thoughts your ways are not my
[1:48:07] ways Hallelujah come on
[1:48:10] somebody cuz you
[1:48:12] see we would throw people in hell right
[1:48:17] now we would throw ourselves in hell
[1:48:22] right but my ways are not your
[1:48:26] ways my thoughts
[1:48:29] H my thoughts are not your
[1:48:33] thoughts glory to
[1:48:38] God praise the Lord God Oh Glory favor
[1:48:43] is
[1:48:47] deceitful so the only thing we need
[1:48:51] favor with
[1:48:54] God because if I've got favor with
[1:48:57] him then if you're the elected of
[1:49:00] God I know I'll have favor with
[1:49:03] you because if I love him right I can
[1:49:06] love you
[1:49:09] right Paul say what are all these evil
[1:49:12] speakings and clamoring among
[1:49:18] you he said I've heard there's much
[1:49:20] disputing among
[1:49:23] you and then you know what he goes on to
[1:49:26] say that you should love one another as
[1:49:28] Christ also loved the
[1:49:33] church gave himself for
[1:49:35] it through his own
[1:49:38] blood you know how I keep
[1:49:42] going because God shown his favor and
[1:49:45] Grace to
[1:49:49] me amen praise the Lamb of
[1:49:52] God oh thank you
[1:49:55] Jesus now listen to this brother M said
[1:50:00] that you have favor with
[1:50:04] God he'll give gifts to
[1:50:06] you you know it's a strange thing to
[1:50:10] me that in the body of Christ
[1:50:15] soall there are so few gifts among the
[1:50:19] people
[1:50:21] it doesn't seem like people are
[1:50:23] demonstrating Supernatural
[1:50:29] things they can sure quote the
[1:50:32] message they can tell you everywhere
[1:50:34] brother bam said Rapture and how many
[1:50:38] times they know their Bible upward and
[1:50:40] downward and backward and sideways and
[1:50:42] Every Which
[1:50:45] Way but in order to be able to
[1:50:47] demonstrate
[1:50:49] Christ
[1:50:51] you got to have more than just the
[1:50:52] ability to sit on a chair and open your
[1:50:54] ear up and
[1:50:58] listen young people this goes for you
[1:51:00] all
[1:51:01] too don't hurt God's feelings at all if
[1:51:04] he saw a young sister speaking in
[1:51:09] tongues but I know we're too spiritual
[1:51:12] for that
[1:51:13] right we're too spiritual to see visions
[1:51:16] and
[1:51:18] prophesy you know why don't do it
[1:51:21] because we've not yet obtained God's
[1:51:23] favor for
[1:51:26] us CU if we had Divine love in our
[1:51:30] heart in some way or
[1:51:33] somehow God would demonstrate the
[1:51:36] supernatural through our
[1:51:39] lives be it Discerning or be it some
[1:51:42] other
[1:51:44] way now doesn't mean you have to show a
[1:51:47] gift to show you got the Holy
[1:51:48] Ghost
[1:51:53] but the holy ghost shows
[1:51:55] gifts you should at least be open to
[1:51:58] receive
[1:52:00] it but socalled people that say I'm born
[1:52:05] again they don't even know how to
[1:52:07] worship outside that old formal stuff
[1:52:09] they
[1:52:13] do no excitement to them whatsoever no
[1:52:17] when they clap their hands they clap
[1:52:18] like they're at a ball game
[1:52:22] or they've just heard a good opera
[1:52:23] singer finish a
[1:52:26] great worship should be something that
[1:52:29] generates from a born again
[1:52:33] heart worship is not just a bunch of
[1:52:37] routines worship is having that joy that
[1:52:40] just spills out of your heart and
[1:52:45] mind and that's the way these gifts
[1:52:48] operate when you live under the altar of
[1:52:51] God your
[1:52:53] days these gifts will just start working
[1:52:55] right in the
[1:52:58] body you watch and
[1:53:00] see the closer you draw to his
[1:53:04] presence the more his favor will just
[1:53:07] increase and increase and
[1:53:11] increase because you've got his
[1:53:14] favor but we want him to be able to get
[1:53:16] access to all of
[1:53:18] us
[1:53:21] I want Jesus to have control of my eyes
[1:53:23] my mouth my
[1:53:27] ears if I'm not built to see a
[1:53:32] vision that's all right he can put me to
[1:53:35] sleep and give me a
[1:53:38] dream whatever he wants to do that's
[1:53:40] what I
[1:53:42] want amen but message
[1:53:45] people have become
[1:53:48] boring you Noti
[1:53:50] on boring on you're saying the boring
[1:53:53] right yeah boring you know as in
[1:53:59] like when did Church become
[1:54:03] boring you've got boring
[1:54:06] preachers boring
[1:54:08] musicians boring
[1:54:10] singers boring
[1:54:13] saints that come to church and are all
[1:54:17] bored because we become such a a
[1:54:20] creature of
[1:54:23] routine we do everything the same way
[1:54:26] all the
[1:54:29] time but God loves spontaneous Christian
[1:54:35] worship you know I've said this for a
[1:54:37] long
[1:54:38] time if you get stuck in that routine
[1:54:41] like
[1:54:42] that you're someone that always sticks
[1:54:44] your right arm
[1:54:46] up next time put your left one up
[1:54:50] if you're somebody amen amen amen amen
[1:54:53] amen amen the next time be hallelujah
[1:54:55] hallelujah
[1:54:57] hallelujah to shake yourself
[1:55:00] out don't get stuck in a
[1:55:04] rut you just wind up in a ditch that
[1:55:08] way if you are the redeemed let the
[1:55:11] redeemed of the Lord say
[1:55:14] so all that half breath praise you the
[1:55:18] Lord
[1:55:21] and if you don't do it I know it ain't
[1:55:22] because of your
[1:55:25] pastor you forget your pastor was one
[1:55:28] time my
[1:55:30] pastor I know what kind of atmosphere I
[1:55:33] was born
[1:55:35] under and you sure ain't taught to sit
[1:55:37] there and stare like a hole in the wall
[1:55:39] no no sir you ain't taught to sit there
[1:55:43] and
[1:55:45] stare like an old hole sitting in the
[1:55:48] wall you should you've been taught to
[1:55:51] worship
[1:55:53] God am I right or am I
[1:55:56] wrong well you know why we we let back
[1:55:59] on
[1:56:01] that because we lose focus on what
[1:56:04] Christ has really done for
[1:56:09] us and Friends it all starts in very
[1:56:11] simple
[1:56:13] ways you're at work and a bad thought
[1:56:17] goes through your
[1:56:18] mind L feel ashamed of
[1:56:22] yourself but then that human nature kind
[1:56:24] of kicks
[1:56:27] in part of the human nature liked
[1:56:30] it part of the human nature
[1:56:33] didn't and now here you are in this
[1:56:35] battle and then Here Comes The Devil see

[1:56:40] you not born again see you couldn't do
[1:56:42] that and be born
[1:56:44] again don't you know that's where you
[1:56:46] need to grab the sword of the word of
[1:56:48] the Lord
[1:56:52] let a little courage strike your
[1:56:56] heart when we should resist the
[1:57:01] devil Satan shut your
[1:57:04] mouth amen I know where I'm standing and
[1:57:08] who I
[1:57:11] am but we don't do that do
[1:57:14] we do we do we no what happens
[1:57:20] we start developing and building up
[1:57:23] baggage one bag after
[1:57:25] another and then we come to church
[1:57:29] brother Isaiah say come on somebody come
[1:57:32] on some you say I'm coming but I can't
[1:57:33] get my arms
[1:57:36] up Christ don't want you coming to
[1:57:38] church with
[1:57:41] baggage I'm talking to you come on I'm
[1:57:45] preaching to you come on Christ don't
[1:57:48] want you to come with baggage in your
[1:57:52] hands the Bible said he whom the son is
[1:57:55] set free fre
[1:57:58] indeed you don't have to hold on to
[1:58:02] it amen
[1:58:05] amen he said cast your care on
[1:58:09] [Music]
[1:58:10] me I care for
[1:58:13] you
[1:58:16] glory praise His holy name glory to
[1:58:20] God hallelujah
[1:58:24] am amen praise the
[1:58:27] Lord but we let Satan pack this on
[1:58:31] us he just mounts it up on our
[1:58:34] shoulders until we come to church and
[1:58:36] we're so
[1:58:38] hunched so we can barely make it in the
[1:58:41] door how you doing today
[1:58:44] brother somebody pray for me that I can
[1:58:46] get to Wednesday
[1:58:48] night pray for me I can get to church on
[1:58:52] time is one reason why we don't take it
[1:58:55] more
[1:58:57] seriously no one likes to come to church
[1:59:00] and be told about their
[1:59:04] baggage but you know sometimes the only
[1:59:06] way to free you of
[1:59:10] it is to remind you that it's
[1:59:14] there you know some people get so used
[1:59:17] to
[1:59:18] it
[1:59:19] well I guess this is what Christianity
[1:59:21] is all
[1:59:23] about and here they are burdened down
[1:59:25] with all kinds of
[1:59:27] things they're carrying this heavy coat
[1:59:30] on
[1:59:31] them Pastor say isn't that good right
[1:59:36] there yeah Pastor that's pretty
[1:59:40] good I sure believe
[1:59:44] it pray for me brother Isaiah pray for
[1:59:47] me is the answer is not to be prayed
[1:59:53] for no no no we've already prayed for
[1:59:56] you if you want to get technical Jesus
[1:59:59] already prayed for
[2:00:01] you come on one thing you're going to
[2:00:04] learn before we leave this church today
[2:00:06] is I'm not going to allow you to leave
[2:00:08] with one
[2:00:13] excuse that's what the Holy Ghost told
[2:00:15] me back
[2:00:16] there you preach and don't leave one
[2:00:20] excuse so Here I Am Lord your servant
[2:00:23] reporting for
[2:00:25] Duty you see you get so adjusted to that
[2:00:27] kind of
[2:00:30] Lifestyle you think this is all I've
[2:00:32] got this is the best I've got but it
[2:00:36] ain't all you got to do is reach up
[2:00:38] there by the grace of God and rip that
[2:00:40] thing off of
[2:00:43] your you know Jesus met a woman in an
[2:00:46] infirmity that was hunched over
[2:00:51] when God was able to heal
[2:00:53] her she was able to stretch herself
[2:00:57] up and straighten herself
[2:01:00] out God has that kind of healing for
[2:01:04] some of
[2:01:06] you some of you've been so crippled in
[2:01:09] your walk with God you can't even Amen
[2:01:11] in church
[2:01:18] right woman thou are
[2:01:22] loosed this ain't the TD Jake's version
[2:01:24] this is the Elijah
[2:01:28] version glory to God because this kind
[2:01:31] of
[2:01:32] healing will straighten you out
[2:01:37] forever but we accept
[2:01:39] it we accept that kind of
[2:01:43] life and as a result we live our whole
[2:01:45] life crippled
[2:01:48] up
[2:01:50] and the church said
[2:01:53] amen
[2:01:55] right now listen to
[2:01:57] this brother says he never fully blessed
[2:02:04] Abraham until Abraham fully
[2:02:10] obeyed you see God wants our
[2:02:14] obedience listen listen he wants our
[2:02:18] obedience
[2:02:22] even though he knows we cannot be it's
[2:02:24] impossible to be 100%
[2:02:31] obedient so he's not asking for us to be
[2:02:35] perfect obedience is not about doing
[2:02:38] everything
[2:02:40] right come on now amen but obedience
[2:02:44] is being willing to do the
[2:02:47] right
[2:02:49] amen cuz that's what God looks at
[2:02:53] anyhow many years you've been a
[2:02:55] Christian he's been you've been growing
[2:02:56] and developing your whole
[2:03:00] walk and if you're honest and I'm honest
[2:03:03] a been a day goes by a't messed up
[2:03:08] somewhere I'm like Paul I Repent
[2:03:12] daily but why does God give me the Holy
[2:03:16] Ghost because I'm willing
[2:03:19] if it means through the
[2:03:21] fire it means through the
[2:03:23] flood if friends turn their back on
[2:03:26] me no matter what it
[2:03:28] is I'm willing to walk with
[2:03:32] Jesus God sees that
[2:03:35] obedience and he he acts upon that
[2:03:39] obedience that's why he's the Confessor
[2:03:41] he's the he's the professor of our faith
[2:03:44] the one that that the high priest Can Be
[2:03:46] Touched by our confession ra
[2:03:51] so I can promise him Lord I'll do better
[2:03:53] I'll do better I'll do
[2:03:56] better him sitting there looking at me
[2:03:58] from
[2:04:00] eternity I know you boy you don't mean
[2:04:04] that well you mean it but you don't mean
[2:04:09] it oh but imagine his grace and
[2:04:14] mercy he knows in our heart we want to
[2:04:17] do right
[2:04:19] so he shows us great
[2:04:23] leniency he gives us spaces of time to
[2:04:26] learn how to get
[2:04:30] it have you ever
[2:04:32] noticed some of the sins in your life
[2:04:35] that you just keep going back
[2:04:39] to little things that just constantly
[2:04:42] beset you seems
[2:04:44] like did you happen to notice that you
[2:04:47] wasn't struck with a lightning this
[2:04:53] morning anybody noticed that the
[2:04:55] Judgment of God didn't visit you at your
[2:04:57] breakfast table this
[2:05:02] morning anybody noticed there was no
[2:05:04] angels with chains of of of of
[2:05:07] imprisonment to come get
[2:05:13] you God simply convicted your
[2:05:17] heart and you know after a period of
[2:05:20] time he don't even say nothing about it
[2:05:22] because you already
[2:05:23] [Music]
[2:05:25] know but he wants you to act upon what
[2:05:28] you know is
[2:05:33] right that my friends is what we call
[2:05:36] Christian
[2:05:39] maturity when you are growing up in
[2:05:42] Christ there are things that he wants
[2:05:45] you to do because you know you're
[2:05:46] supposed to do it
[2:05:52] that's what James said you say you got
[2:05:54] faith I'll show it to you by my
[2:05:58] Works other words I'll act upon what I
[2:06:02] know but Christ has such leniency for
[2:06:07] us Grace for
[2:06:09] us and only when you start going too
[2:06:16] far that's when he steps in and goes
[2:06:19] [Music]
[2:06:21] too
[2:06:22] far too far come back
[2:06:25] here it's kind of like you moms and
[2:06:29] dads you know when you had that little
[2:06:31] boy or that little girl outside and they
[2:06:32] were playing by the
[2:06:37] road now you know when you're a young
[2:06:40] parent everything scares you to
[2:06:44] death but after you've had a few kids
[2:06:46] you
[2:06:47] know
[2:06:49] you see them doing things and other
[2:06:52] parents are
[2:06:54] going and you're just like oh they
[2:06:57] they'll be all right
[2:06:59] like cuz you kind of know how far
[2:07:01] they'll go and how far they
[2:07:05] won't I was sitting with one of my
[2:07:08] family members one
[2:07:10] time this was when I was a young daddy
[2:07:14] myself and that woman kept letting that
[2:07:16] kid get closer and closer and closer to
[2:07:18] this day
[2:07:22] and I was getting so scared and so
[2:07:25] nervous I finally said get that young in
[2:07:27] and bring it back over
[2:07:31] here said no he'll be all right let him
[2:07:35] alone and I got I got comfortable I
[2:07:37] thought okay well praise the Lord she
[2:07:40] knows and all at once right in the
[2:07:43] middle of a
[2:07:44] conversation she jumped up and ran over
[2:07:47] there she got that young and dragged him
[2:07:50] back over
[2:07:51] there and I said what' you do that for
[2:07:55] she said he was about to get in
[2:08:00] trouble that's the way Jesus does you
[2:08:03] and
[2:08:04] I he knows how far to let us
[2:08:08] [Music]
[2:08:10] play he knows how far to let us
[2:08:14] go how are you going to learn if he
[2:08:17] doesn't give you room to learn
[2:08:21] it same time he also
[2:08:25] know when you're about to get in trouble
[2:08:28] and he pulls you back
[2:08:33] in to
[2:08:36] God
[2:08:39] hallu cuz he knows what kind of human
[2:08:41] you
[2:08:43] are he knows what your weaknesses
[2:08:46] are and if you don't learn to fight with
[2:08:48] your own sword how are you going to
[2:08:53] fight sure you're going to lose some
[2:08:56] battles you should expect you're going
[2:08:58] to lose many of
[2:09:01] them but that never means you'll lose
[2:09:04] the
[2:09:06] war cuz my
[2:09:09] daddy is watching over his
[2:09:13] boy he promises not to let me go
[2:09:17] further

[2:14:14] side of

[2:14:27] permanent come on somebody once they
[2:14:30] cross that line between mercy and
[2:14:34] judgment God anger was
[2:14:38] permanent his anger is kindled against
[2:14:40] them all the days of their
[2:14:44] life and when he drops down into the
[2:14:46] white Throne judgments
[2:14:51] his anger has
[2:14:54] accumulated he has gathered 6,000 years
[2:14:57] of
[2:15:00] anger against the
[2:15:03] unjust that when he comes to to to bring
[2:15:06] them to the

[2:16:46] girls in the world
[2:16:51] but they're stupid teenage
[2:16:52] girls this is a time in their
[2:16:55] life when they can do the dumbest things

[2:17:41] are they're just susceptible to do the
[2:17:44] dumbest things
[2:17:46] possible
[2:17:49] and you see my girls is
[2:17:53] brilliant as beautiful as they
[2:17:55] are like my pastor told me just the
[2:17:58] other

[2:18:13] Uncle so and so and then that
[2:18:16] brother

[2:18:21] a
[2:18:23] while they do some of them the the the
[2:18:26] most wonderful things
[2:18:30] sometimes they'll do little things for

[2:18:34] kids in the whole wide
[2:18:37] world until stupidity shows
[2:18:40] up I say my goodness how how in the
[2:18:45] world come on come on can you be so
[2:18:47] smart and then be so
[2:18:51] dumb but you see I'm
[2:18:53] daddy and I'm allowed to look at them

[2:19:06] my
[2:19:08] business but with my
[2:19:10] girls I'm allowed to see them in their
[2:19:13] good
[2:19:15] places I'm allowed to see them in their
[2:19:19] plac you see
[2:19:21] sometimes my anger will Kindle against
[2:19:26] them not because I'm mad at
[2:19:30] him but because I'm
[2:19:33] disappointed and that disappointment
[2:19:35] brings this anger in
[2:19:38] me I told you a thousand times don't do
[2:19:42] it that
[2:19:45] way I may get mad at him
[2:19:49] I may holler and fuss and carry on Hot
[2:19:52] in the world doesn't matter with you
[2:19:53] stupid teenage
[2:19:55] [Music]
[2:19:57] girls but when the morning
[2:20:00] comes they're still my
[2:20:05] blood and when I see them in the

[2:20:10] say all right
[2:20:11] sweetheart let's try it one more
[2:20:15] time why
[2:20:17] because my anger endures only for a
[2:20:22] moment but in my favor is their
[2:20:26] lives that's the way our heavenly father
[2:20:29] looks at
[2:20:30] us I know some of you think I'm being
[2:20:33] mean about my
[2:20:36] girls I'm not nearly the way God is
[2:20:39] about his
[2:20:41] own you know the prophet of God said God
[2:20:44] gets so mad at us sometimes he feels
[2:20:46] like taking
[2:20:52] us sometimes he feels like just grabbing
[2:20:54] us and shaking as a good
[2:20:57] one what is a matter with you
[2:21:01] kids he can get angry at
[2:21:04] us but his anger only endures for a
[2:21:09] moment just for a
[2:21:11] season and then after he comes to the
[2:21:16] place time time to start
[2:21:19] again the morning comes he takes us by
[2:21:23] the
[2:21:24] hand all right come on Benjamin let's
[2:21:26] try it again
[2:21:28] now what does that his
[2:21:32] favor amen his
[2:21:34] favor and I can lay claim to
[2:21:38] this when nobody else can lay claim
[2:21:45] to praise God God prise God
[2:21:49] Amen I'll just leave that there with the
[2:21:51] stup stupid teenage kids I won't talk
[2:21:53] about none of us stupid adults yet I'll
[2:21:55] just leave that for
[2:22:00] next now dropping down to verse
[2:22:03] seven now listen if you're watching the
[2:22:06] clock your pastor told me to take as
[2:22:09] much time as I needed so here we
[2:22:12] are so if you're going to text Isaiah
[2:22:14] get down to business right now cuz I'm
[2:22:16] going to keep preaching
[2:22:19] I'm I'm not nowhere near done yet I'm
[2:22:20] going to keep going till I'm
[2:22:23] done look at verse
[2:22:25] seven he says Lord by thy
[2:22:32] favor thou Hast made my
[2:22:38] Mountain to stand
[2:22:43] strong you see a mountain in the the
[2:22:48] Bible represents a few
[2:22:53] things one part of it is
[2:22:57] inspiration brother said he go high into
[2:22:59] the
[2:23:01] mountains he said in there he get
[2:23:03] Inspirations from
[2:23:07] God a mountain can also
[2:23:11] represent the height or the the Pinnacle
[2:23:14] of something the the greatest of all of
[2:23:16] it
[2:23:19] the new city is a
[2:23:24] mountain and Jesus sets at the top of
[2:23:26] that
[2:23:28] mountain on the very top of that City
[2:23:31] there sits Jesus
[2:23:33] Christ the rainbow of God proceeding
[2:23:36] forth from
[2:23:39] him but a mountain also represents
[2:23:42] something else in the New Testament
[2:23:46] oldest
[2:23:47] it represents a new
[2:23:51] beginning you see whenever we go through
[2:23:54] Low
[2:23:57] Places no matter how many we might go
[2:24:02] through the valley is only a
[2:24:08] testimony that at some
[2:24:11] place at some point in
[2:24:14] time I'm going to come to the foot of a
[2:24:16] new beginning
[2:24:21] and I can walk up and try
[2:24:24] again you see I'm not really in the
[2:24:27] valley when I'm in the Valley I'm just
[2:24:31] changing mountaintops that's
[2:24:34] all
[2:24:36] amen so God said by his
[2:24:40] favor he made my
[2:24:43] Mountain to stand
[2:24:45] strong
[2:24:47] so no matter how many valleys I go
[2:24:51] through I've always got a new
[2:24:57] beginning you know what that
[2:25:00] means that means you have unlimited
[2:25:07] tries now I was a boy and we used to
[2:25:10] play video games at
[2:25:15] home well I was a boy we we fell in love
[2:25:18] with video games like
[2:25:21] that cuz we figured out a way to play
[2:25:24] without losing all the lives we had
[2:25:26] unlimited
[2:25:29] lives and no matter how many times
[2:25:31] little Mario fell in the ditch I could
[2:25:33] start
[2:25:37] again let me tell you something
[2:25:39] brother I lost a lot of quarters
[2:25:42] figuring that lesson
[2:25:45] out I discovered the secret of unlimited
[2:25:52] lives that's the way it might have been
[2:25:54] with you
[2:25:56] Hallelujah you might have went from
[2:25:58] denomination to denomination to church
[2:26:00] to this to
[2:26:04] that but once the revelation of God's
[2:26:07] grace strikes your
[2:26:11] heart you're living in the light of an
[2:26:13] unlimited
[2:26:15] life
[2:26:18] no matter how many times you hit the
[2:26:22] ditch he has made my
[2:26:26] Mountain stand
[2:26:29] strong
[2:26:32] am praise be to
[2:26:35] God hallelujah hallelujah
[2:26:39] hallelujah listen to this let me close
[2:26:43] here brother B says it like this
[2:26:48] it says if
[2:26:49] you profess to be a
[2:26:52] [Music]
[2:26:54] Christian no matter what you've
[2:26:58] done what you Tred to make
[2:27:03] yourself what you do is not
[2:27:10] accepted it's what he
[2:27:13] done your own righteousness won't be
[2:27:16] accepted
[2:27:19] Now read this with me watch this with me
[2:27:21] the
[2:27:23] brother Hebrews chapter
[2:27:26] 4 if you quit smoking just because you
[2:27:33] said well I better quit
[2:27:36] smoking because I profess
[2:27:39] Christianity this what brother says it
[2:27:42] won't be
[2:27:45] accepted
[2:27:47] God don't accept
[2:27:49] it you know that's a funny thing with
[2:27:54] smoking I was born in
[2:27:58] 1977 so in my early days as a
[2:28:02] boy they could still show cigarette
[2:28:05] commercials on
[2:28:08] television you know ads in the papers
[2:28:10] and
[2:28:12] everything but most of the younger
[2:28:14] generation in here
[2:28:18] they were trained in a different
[2:28:22] environment smoking wasn't called deadly
[2:28:25] when I was a
[2:28:28] kid but about the time I hit 12 or 13
[2:28:31] years
[2:28:34] old the smoking industry became
[2:28:39] exposed and all of these people now were
[2:28:42] guilty of causing millions of
[2:28:45] deaths
[2:28:49] and you know ain't it like the
[2:28:52] devil ain't that like the
[2:28:54] devil to see a generation come up and
[2:28:57] know that that cigarette smoking will
[2:28:59] kill
[2:29:01] you so what did he
[2:29:05] do so what did the devil do for that
[2:29:09] generation he changed the marketing
[2:29:13] plan and he moved from smoking to vaping
[2:29:20] vaping you know what vaping is don't you
[2:29:23] where they got that little electronic
[2:29:24] cigarette and they blow that big cloud
[2:29:26] of smoke you know what I'm talking about
[2:29:28] the French word like yeah I don't know
[2:29:31] what you it's it's it's a it's a
[2:29:33] manufactured cigarette it's a mechanical
[2:29:35] I mean mechanical cigarette is what it
[2:29:37] is yeah I know what you're talking about
[2:29:38] yeah do
[2:29:39] they who knows what vaping is I just
[2:29:42] make sure before I go on with what I'm
[2:29:44] saying you understand what it is
[2:29:47] all right so this is what they
[2:29:49] proved they put flavors in
[2:29:54] them they declared that these electronic
[2:29:59] cigarettes were way safer than
[2:30:02] cigarettes
[2:30:06] were and the next thing you know young
[2:30:08] people were vaping like
[2:30:15] crazy
[2:30:17] and you know what they proved about
[2:30:20] that they proved that was more dangerous
[2:30:23] than the cigarette
[2:30:27] was but Satan made it
[2:30:31] pretty made it look
[2:30:34] innocent you know brother bradam talked
[2:30:36] about that many many years
[2:30:39] ago he said in the early days there was
[2:30:41] a certain brand of
[2:30:45] whiskey whis called Johnny Crow Johnny
[2:30:49] Crow and said Johnny Crow was this
[2:30:51] horrible looking little vulture bird
[2:30:53] looking thing
[2:31:01] Crow he looked like a
[2:31:03] monster like something out of a scary
[2:31:07] movie but then the devil got
[2:31:10] smart and so the next
[2:31:13] time he put a top hat and a cane a
[2:31:16] tuxedo on Johnny
[2:31:18] Crow Tu Johnny Crow and he made him look
[2:31:25] classy made him look
[2:31:27] wealthy oh and how slick the devil
[2:31:31] is got more people to drink whiskey
[2:31:34] after that than he did before
[2:31:39] that my wife is a school
[2:31:43] teacher and young people can sit in
[2:31:46] their
[2:31:47] desk and pull their hoodie over their
[2:31:51] head
[2:31:56] and it goes right up into their clothes
[2:31:58] and you can't see smoke or
[2:32:03] anything it is as sneaky as it can
[2:32:07] be but is a trick of the devil to kill
[2:32:10] this next Generation the same as
[2:32:13] cigarettes did before
[2:32:15] them
[2:32:19] may I say it in the name of the
[2:32:21] Lord flee you for
[2:32:25] lust and cl to the Cross of
[2:32:28] Christ Satan has gotten way more
[2:32:32] tricky used to be that you had to go
[2:32:34] into a room and watch
[2:32:39] television now you can sit on the toilet
[2:32:41] and do
[2:32:43] it go down the road in your car and do
[2:32:45] it
[2:32:47] aha the word's amen come
[2:32:49] on Satan knows what he's
[2:32:52] doing that's why we've got to be better
[2:32:55] than
[2:32:56] him the only way we can be better than
[2:32:58] the devil is to have Christ in you which
[2:33:00] is the hope of
[2:33:03] glory exactly right brother I can't help
[2:33:06] it that's just the
[2:33:07] truth about Christ on the inside he'
[2:33:09] deceive every one of
[2:33:12] us but thank God he cannot deceive the
[2:33:15] election
[2:33:20] why cuz his son's blood covers me
[2:33:26] over thank you Lord oh
[2:33:30] yes he said if you quit lusting after
[2:33:35] women just because you're making
[2:33:37] yourself do
[2:33:39] it God don't accept
[2:33:41] it that's something you
[2:33:44] do that's works
[2:33:47] it's Grace that saves
[2:33:49] you has God come to
[2:33:52] you and taking the whole thing out of
[2:33:56] you you say I joined
[2:33:59] church so I had to quit these
[2:34:02] things let's say it in our
[2:34:05] language I believe the message so I
[2:34:08] can't do these
[2:34:10] things that's just you doing
[2:34:13] that but when his son's blood covers you
[2:34:18] then you don't have to quit
[2:34:20] it it will quit
[2:34:24] you CU it's not of works that any man
[2:34:28] can
[2:34:30] boast but by the
[2:34:33] favor by the
[2:34:36] grace of almighty
[2:34:40] God hallelujah praise His holy name I'm
[2:34:45] quitting you're starting to wiggle I
[2:34:46] know you're getting
[2:34:48] tired if Frank would preach faster you
[2:34:50] wouldn't we wouldn't be here so
[2:34:53] long I'm teasing him amen it's my fault
[2:34:58] right you did get that part okay never
[2:35:00] mind listen to this last statement let's
[2:35:02] go home he said in Ezekiel
[2:35:09] 3313 he said if he shall trust in his
[2:35:11] own
[2:35:15] righteousness
[2:35:16] and commit
[2:35:18] iniquity all of his righteousnesses
[2:35:22] shall not be
[2:35:25] remembered but the iniquity he
[2:35:28] commits he'll end up dying for
[2:35:31] it you see that's that's the world
[2:35:34] today they try to establish their own
[2:35:38] righteousness but Paul says here in
[2:35:40] Romans 10 and
[2:35:42] 3 that Bunch around him he said they
[2:35:45] were ignorant of God's
[2:35:48] righteousness going about to establish
[2:35:51] their own
[2:35:54] righteousness see that's why I was
[2:35:56] telling you the last time I was here
[2:35:57] with
[2:35:59] you we don't want to be some
[2:36:01] manufactured version of
[2:36:05] Christianity everybody looking the same
[2:36:08] dressing the same acting the
[2:36:12] same God made you an
[2:36:14] individual
[2:36:16] and as long as you're living holy and
[2:36:18] living clean before the Lord be who you
[2:36:24] are if you're African and you like
[2:36:26] bright colors sister brother wear your
[2:36:28] bright
[2:36:32] colors as long as you're living holy
[2:36:36] where as long as it's in line with the
[2:36:39] Bible do
[2:36:40] it and if you're some boring white guy
[2:36:43] then be boring white
[2:36:44] guys
[2:36:46] you say
[2:36:49] that CU you didn't say it I said it me
[2:36:52] right here that wasn't Frank that's
[2:36:55] me be what we
[2:36:57] are God doesn't hate us for our
[2:37:03] individuality said when he saw that
[2:37:04] bride coming around all of them was
[2:37:06] dressed in their National
[2:37:12] Guards amen he's a god of variety
[2:37:17] right exactly right not our own
[2:37:21] establishment but listen to this and I
[2:37:24] love this statement right here Paul
[2:37:27] comes to tell us in Romans chapter
[2:37:31] 5 verses uh 10 and
[2:37:35] 11 when we were
[2:37:39] enemies we were reconciled to
[2:37:43] God by the death of his
[2:37:46] son much more being
[2:37:49] reconciled we shall be saved by his
[2:37:53] life Hallelujah and not only
[2:37:57] so but we also joy to
[2:38:01] God through our Lord Jesus
[2:38:04] Christ by whom we have now received the
[2:38:09] atonement do you know what this word
[2:38:11] atonement means in the original
[2:38:14] Greek
[2:38:16] it means the
[2:38:19] restoration of the favor of
[2:38:26] God so I was an enemy to
[2:38:29] him and I lost his favor when I became a
[2:38:35] sinner I was an enemy to
[2:38:38] that and that was in this life
[2:38:41] here but see if my name was on the
[2:38:44] Lamb's Book of Life
[2:38:47] the real
[2:38:48] me had never lost his
[2:38:52] favor and the only way to reconcile
[2:38:56] me was he's going to have to kill
[2:39:00] me for ye are dead in
[2:39:03] Christ being buried with him in
[2:39:07] baptism
[2:39:10] resurrected into the newness of
[2:39:14] life and now the real
[2:39:16] me can express what what's always been
[2:39:21] understand that what's always been
[2:39:25] there his Divine favor from the very
[2:39:30] beginning when I became a
[2:39:32] Christian he just restored that favor
[2:39:34] back to
[2:39:37] me there's a brother from
[2:39:40] Ghana did anybody ever know
[2:39:44] Samson Sams he's gone
[2:39:47] now and i' call him on the phone every
[2:39:49] now and

[2:40:04] disappointed too blessed to be
