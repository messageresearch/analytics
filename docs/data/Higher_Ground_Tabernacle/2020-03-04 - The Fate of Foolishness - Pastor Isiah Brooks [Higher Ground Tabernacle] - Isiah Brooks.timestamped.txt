[36:44] today
[36:50] hallelujah hallelujah
[36:53] surely God is good to us we'll go right
[36:57] into the Word of God had a wonderful
[36:59] song service thank you brother
[37:01] appreciate the energy I used to be that
[37:10] thank you for the musicians all of you
[37:13] it's just a blessing to have everybody
[37:17] here we realized that we're living in
[37:20] the last days and the choices that we
[37:24] make will determine our destiny I
[37:30] believe with all of our heart that my
[37:33] heart that it's a real a very serious
[37:38] time
[37:39] and keeping our hearts and our mind
[37:43] focus
[37:45] all the times that we're living in is
[37:48] actually a matter of life and death
[37:52] it's easy to say
[37:56] I'm gonna keep my mind on Jesus but we
[38:00] do have an adversary
[38:02] who is seeking to devour
[38:07] seyton we know doesn't play any games
[38:11] but he's serious about what he's doing
[38:14] and we should be serious about what
[38:17] we're doing it doesn't make it easy but
[38:22] one thing I noticed the the theme of of
[38:26] the song service and that is victory and
[38:29] God has given us the victory did you
[38:32] what I said I said God has given us to
[38:35] fix it we don't we don't we don't do
[38:39] nothing but receive it and if you
[38:41] receive it you have it it's yours
[38:44] God don't need your reasoning he doesn't
[38:47] need your processing by faith the just
[38:51] shall live by his faith turn with me to
[38:54] Genesis 3 please Genesis 3
[39:00] understand by God's grace I heard a
[39:03] brother say this today it i don't
[39:06] normally listen to people's messages
[39:08] other than brother branham's but today i
[39:11] was sent a link to something and
[39:15] actually it was brother Craig or
[39:17] speaking down in Lima Ohio and what a
[39:20] what a powerful message he was speaking
[39:23] I really enjoyed it
[39:27] but I I know one of the things that he
[39:30] emphasized which we all do and he used
[39:34] the mirror situation it's about had a
[39:37] mirror I'll show you who your greatest
[39:39] enemy is and I like that I like that you
[39:44] know because the prophet of God he tells
[39:46] us the greatest enemy is ourselves
[39:48] ah if we're going to become something in
[39:53] Christ we must first deny ourselves
[39:56] that's the sensible principle of the
[39:58] gospel deny yourself take up your cross
[40:02] and follow me
[40:04] and I think that's where we are right
[40:06] now in a season of constantly constantly
[40:09] denying ourselves because Paul said that
[40:13] we must die daily and we must die - I
[40:16] will every day Lord not my will but
[40:19] thine be done reading from Genesis 3 9
[40:23] through 24 we are familiar with these
[40:26] scriptures and by God's grace we read
[40:28] them and then we'll have another word
[40:31] our scripture would ask you to turn to
[40:33] and then we'll go from there
[40:35] and the Lord God called unto Adam and
[40:39] said unto Him where art thou and he said
[40:43] I heard thy voice in the garden and I
[40:47] was afraid because I was naked and I hid
[40:50] myself and he said who told thee that
[40:53] thou had was naked as thou eaten of the
[40:57] tree whereof I commanded that thou
[41:00] should not should not eat
[41:04] amen
[41:06] and the man said
[41:10] the woman whom thou gave it to me to be
[41:14] with me she gave me of the tree and I
[41:17] did eat
[41:18] and the Lord God said unto the woman
[41:21] what is this that thou has done and the
[41:24] woman said the serpent beguiled me and I
[41:27] did eat
[41:28] in the Lord God said unto the serpent
[41:30] because thou has done this thou art
[41:33] cursed above all cattle and above every
[41:36] beast of the field and upon thy belly
[41:39] thou shalt go and dust shalt thou eat
[41:45] all the days of their life and I will
[41:48] put in between between thee and the
[41:50] woman and between thy seed and her seed
[41:53] and it shall bruise thy head and thou
[41:57] shalt bruise his heel amen we could read
[42:02] on but let's just jump down there
[42:10] to the last two verses of that that
[42:13] particular one there chapter therefore
[42:16] the Lord God sent forth sent him forth
[42:19] from the Garden of Eden to till the
[42:22] ground from whence he was taken so he
[42:25] drove out the man and he placed at the
[42:27] east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and
[42:30] a flaming sword which turned every way
[42:34] and to keep the way of the two Tree of
[42:37] Life for more scripture please
[42:42] Psalms 5 excuse me for songs 53 and 1
[42:53] to the chief musician upon the Halleck
[42:57] basket a psalm of David the fool have
[43:02] said in his heart there is no God
[43:05] corrupt are they that have done
[43:07] abominable iniquity there is none that
[43:11] doeth good let us pray
[43:14] father God we come before you we thank
[43:17] you for your grace and your mercy we
[43:19] need your guidance we need your help
[43:23] Lord and we pray that you would take my
[43:27] being make sanctify and cleanse it let
[43:32] nothing hinder your usage of my body
[43:36] tonight speak through the lips of this
[43:39] man and glorify your word and your name
[43:42] and your name Jesus Christ we pray
[43:46] you may be seated
[43:50] I was asking the Lord just the other day
[43:53] on what to speak
[43:57] and I said Lord I have been a place
[44:00] where I don't know which direction to go
[44:03] how to continue the thought you know I
[44:06] did not want to just jump into something
[44:09] that would
[44:10] just excite us but at the same time I
[44:14] didn't want to preach in such a way that
[44:17] it would discourage you because the
[44:20] message in itself is good news not bad
[44:25] good news and we are in a time where we
[44:29] should feel really blessed that we are
[44:32] hearing the thoughts of God and the
[44:36] reason why we can hear the thoughts of
[44:38] God is because God in our last his last
[44:40] day sent out the voice by the way of
[44:43] Malachi 4 and so God gave me a picture
[44:49] of some sort and I don't know how else
[44:51] to say it but he said to me the fate of
[44:54] foolishness
[44:57] and
[45:00] we know what foolishness is it comes
[45:04] from the result as the resulting from or
[45:07] showing a lack of since you're
[45:11] considered unwise some foolish action
[45:15] you know speech or lack of forethought
[45:19] or caution you know when it comes to God
[45:21] sometimes people just say things with no
[45:24] caution you know with no thought you
[45:27] know lacking understanding who God is
[45:30] you know I remember the prophet of God
[45:32] said that he was there Amen in
[45:35] California and there was an earthquake
[45:36] and this man was out on the side while
[45:39] shaking his fist at God well that's what
[45:42] you call foolishness you know that's
[45:44] like an ant threatening a man when that
[45:50] man has to do one motion
[45:52] you know stamp a mountain not even
[45:55] consider that he was ever there and I
[45:58] think about this what Adam and Eve did
[46:03] was foolishness he had orders not to
[46:09] even touch the tree or basically have no
[46:13] real conversation with it but we
[46:16] understand the thought on what happened
[46:18] but the point I wanted to bring out is
[46:21] because of their foolish act they were
[46:25] kicked out of the Garden of Eden they no
[46:30] longer had everlasting life on earth now
[46:35] they never lost their eternal life
[46:38] because they came from God and there was
[46:40] only one place to go back and that was
[46:42] to go back to God we understand by God's
[46:46] grace because before the foundation of
[46:48] the world God saw the situation but men
[46:52] we have a tendency to be foolish
[46:55] sometimes we speak things that out of my
[46:57] arm out of our mouths as if God doesn't
[47:01] care nor does God hear it was one of the
[47:04] things that Israel did they constantly
[47:06] complained and murmured and didn't even
[47:08] realize that God was listening see God
[47:11] hears your thoughts afar off the Bible
[47:13] says
[47:14] before we even get to a place where we
[47:16] can other words out of our mouth God has
[47:19] already heard us amen
[47:23] he knows our hearts by the things and we
[47:25] speak because the Bible says out of the
[47:28] abundance of the heart the mouth
[47:29] speaketh and sometimes we do we make
[47:33] foolish gestures and things of that
[47:35] nature
[47:36] not realizing Amen that God is not
[47:38] pleased with it but one of the greater
[47:41] sins is that it's of a man is to be a
[47:45] man who believed that God doesn't exist
[47:50] in that way I feel like a man has more
[47:53] more faith in what that than I could
[47:56] possibly have I think about the people
[47:59] who believe in atheism and uh you know
[48:02] evolution you know believing that we
[48:05] evolved from some Polliwog and you know
[48:08] you can trace it all the way back and
[48:10] then I want to find out where this thing
[48:12] started and if it started with a grain
[48:15] of sand or whatever then how did it
[48:17] start and why did it start and why isn't
[48:20] everything just alike you know but we we
[48:25] in our great minds we think that that we
[48:28] are are super you know it if the
[48:33] scientists could see that the previous
[48:36] world the ant eluvian day those people
[48:39] were far more intelligent than what I
[48:42] think it would brush their bubbles a
[48:45] little bit or to bring them down a
[48:46] little low because they could do things
[48:49] that we couldn't we can't even do today
[48:51] and we still don't know all the things
[48:55] that they could do a reason being
[48:58] because God loves to erased things he
[49:02] will erase it and then allow men to
[49:05] start all over again
[49:07] but because we're fallen we make the
[49:10] same mistakes
[49:11] that's why Solomon said there's no new
[49:14] thing under the Sun what has been to
[49:17] will be and you know he goes on to say
[49:19] no matter how men think they are
[49:23] achieving things he said I tell you the
[49:26] conclusion of the matter in
[49:27] to feel God and keep his Commandments
[49:30] now we know by God's grace that the
[49:34] Bible said that the steps of a good man
[49:36] are ordered by the Lord and he delighted
[49:39] in his way though he thought he shall
[49:43] not be utterly cast down for the lord
[49:47] upholdeth him with his hand I have been
[49:51] young and now I am old yet I have not
[49:57] seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed
[50:00] begging bread he is ever merciful and
[50:05] linda's and his seed is blessed is that
[50:10] right
[50:11] blessed depart from evil and do good and
[50:14] dwell forever for the Lord loveth
[50:18] judgment and forsaken not the Saints
[50:21] they are preserved forever but the seed
[50:26] of the wicked shall be cut off the
[50:28] righteous shall inherit the land and
[50:30] dwell therein forever so we realize they
[50:34] meant that God has already sent a word
[50:36] out there that holds you that preserves
[50:41] you that literally sets your boundaries
[50:44] a seed of God cannot blasting the Holy
[50:50] Ghost because God has set boundaries
[50:53] he can't Goldman so far and that's God's
[50:57] doing had not God put that word out like
[51:01] that then we would have been almost like
[51:06] James said you know James talked about a
[51:08] double minded man house he is unstable
[51:10] in all of his ways he talked about
[51:12] wicked people how they're like waves
[51:14] that - up against the rocks and stuff in
[51:17] other words they have no sense of
[51:19] direction they're there in a state of
[51:21] confusion all of their lives but that is
[51:24] the evidence or the sign of what fate is
[51:29] because fate when we think about it as
[51:32] we said is a it's a it's the result you
[51:36] know of lacking sense we we think we
[51:39] know
[51:40] and we don't and that's why the Bible
[51:44] says that in all of our ways we ought to
[51:47] acknowledge him and if we would
[51:49] acknowledge him he will direct our path
[51:52] with sheep and we have no sense of
[51:56] direction we always and always will lead
[52:00] a shepherd other than we we find that
[52:07] sometimes we talk about fate and you
[52:11] know people who have had Harlow both
[52:14] times in this life you know many are the
[52:19] afflictions even the Bible says of the
[52:21] righteous but God delivers them out of
[52:23] them all and we realize Amen that you
[52:27] and I must understand Amen that God
[52:30] protects us even when we don't know
[52:33] we're being protected because fate would
[52:37] Saul upon all of us but God protects us
[52:41] by directing our paths sometimes people
[52:48] are born in situations where they fate
[52:54] has a grip upon them for example many
[52:59] men born poor in a poor condition and
[53:03] there is no place in the country or in
[53:07] the city where they could ever pull
[53:08] themselves out of it
[53:10] you know I think about people over in
[53:13] India who are born naked pool and
[53:16] because of their names it could never be
[53:18] anything that's fate it's disastrous
[53:23] it's horrific it's this condition that
[53:27] that only God can get a man out of but
[53:30] God is more than able I've seen God by
[53:34] the Word of God
[53:35] pull poor people off the street even in
[53:38] India when they were nothing and made
[53:42] them something
[53:44] we talk about fate we talk about our
[53:47] destiny
[53:49] you know they talk about bad children
[53:53] and you know we look at the condition of
[53:55] a person when they're a child and we
[53:58] think to us how cells and sometimes we
[54:00] speak that we said you know if they're
[54:02] continued that way that their fate will
[54:06] will in in in in a bad way sometimes
[54:10] they become murderers you know and often
[54:14] time they they become imprisoned because
[54:16] of the various things that they tend to
[54:19] do don't mean to do it but that's the
[54:22] way fate has handled them but the fool
[54:26] is part about all of that is that God
[54:29] gives every man a chance the gospel will
[54:34] even go into the prison house yeah God
[54:40] seek those that are lost and is ending
[54:44] the Bible said it is his will that none
[54:47] should perish but have everlasting life
[54:50] see so no matter how doom and gloom it
[54:57] may appear you make your life they
[54:59] appear God said with every temptation
[55:02] there's a way of escape he make it so
[55:05] and even though things seem so foolish
[55:09] it seems like we're not when I say it
[55:12] like that it could be so dark he said
[55:15] what do you mean brother sometimes it
[55:17] seems like God ordered these things to
[55:20] be so so that he can come and show his
[55:23] power think about the man who was born
[55:26] blind Waterway but it was a result of
[55:30] fate something terrible happened to this
[55:34] man and he had no control over
[55:38] and they asked a question who did see it
[55:44] Jesus had no one this was all done for
[55:47] the glory of God so what are you saying
[55:50] but look even when you're in a dark
[55:52] place and it seems like fate has grabbed
[55:56] you thought something occurred in your
[55:58] life and you had nothing to do with it
[56:01] it wasn't even your fault
[56:07] but God will always give a man a choice
[56:13] he always come by those places where it
[56:15] seems like there is no way out yeah he
[56:20] is a deliverer of fate but it takes
[56:24] faith to be delivered from feet see you
[56:30] said what brother what are you saying
[56:31] I'm trying to say faith is foolishness
[56:35] once you see that there is a way out
[56:38] once you see that no matter how dark
[56:41] your situation may be there is a way out
[56:45] faith is laid there for people who have
[56:49] no hope but the Bible says I hope go
[56:52] beyond the grave
[56:53] we always have hope faith will never
[56:58] become a prison house for the believer
[57:01] this is why I even pass it on death
[57:04] where is your sting o grave where is no
[57:08] victory see death is a is the fruit of
[57:11] fate
[57:13] yeah because Adam and Eve sin brought
[57:19] death to all of us and fate rides on it
[57:24] like I was saying to something to Bob to
[57:26] a brother the other day I said you know
[57:28] what that's why the Bible says perfect
[57:31] love casts out fear
[57:34] because fate brings fear
[57:38] something that dramatically grips youa
[57:41] grabs you less for example you a cancer
[57:44] comes if the fruit of fate something
[57:50] happened you had no control of it right
[57:53] but it comes and it grabs you but listen
[57:58] faith conquer fate you let me say like
[58:03] this let me give me your thought on this
[58:05] don't you know fear it's the greatest
[58:10] weapon of Satan
[58:15] hell would have no power if the people
[58:20] in hell could relinquish fear if they
[58:25] could good rid of fear they would have
[58:28] power to fight but because they are
[58:31] afraid and it changed them it locks them
[58:38] into a position where every enemy in
[58:41] Hell can whip them beat them whatever it
[58:45] is going on in half it is it is what
[58:48] whole hell in this place
[58:50] fear love is what holds heaven
[58:56] love is a conqueror it couples all
[59:00] things that's why Jesus was able to go
[59:04] down into hell because he was the one
[59:07] who brought love to hell he was able to
[59:11] conquer hell and he came out of here see
[59:15] faint hair was the faith that we fell
[59:18] into because of sin but when he wrote
[59:22] here he descended into hell there was no
[59:25] fear hallelujah matter of fact he went
[59:29] to the devas dog and took the keys from
[59:34] death hell in the grave right he took
[59:37] them see what I'm trying to say
[59:42] one thing I know a minute look like see
[59:44] mister grab Joe but joke the Bible said
[59:47] when he ended up into the belly of the
[59:49] whale it wasn't all over
[59:53] because he had a faith he had a hope he
[59:59] may not have understood everything but
[1:00:01] he says Lord is it not written in your
[1:00:03] word that if I would turn toward the
[1:00:06] temple and pray that you would hear my
[1:00:11] cry she does that's that that breaks the
[1:00:16] chain I don't care what you into and
[1:00:19] what I seem to have a hold of you
[1:00:21] whatever bad habit it does that's not
[1:00:24] your fate you don't have to remain
[1:00:28] hallelujah because faith come cuz all of
[1:00:31] that and it's foolishness to believe
[1:00:36] that fate is your destiny
[1:00:39] if that makes sense that you whenever
[1:00:43] you're trapped into it is what it is see
[1:00:49] that's what's wrong with the world today
[1:00:51] because faith the reality of the one who
[1:00:55] could get the power of the conditions
[1:00:57] they're into they don't want to believe
[1:00:59] in him but he's the only one he's the
[1:01:04] only one that conquered the grave he's
[1:01:07] the only one that can deliver you he is
[1:01:10] faith
[1:01:12] now let me move on one thing about the
[1:01:15] Bible I love
[1:01:23] because there's so many illustrations of
[1:01:25] faith when you get into situations where
[1:01:28] you had no control over it but then
[1:01:30] there are times we read what we saw we
[1:01:34] get into things because we fail to
[1:01:37] consult God is that right
[1:01:40] we failed us look at God's okay God what
[1:01:43] is your will I've been there I've done
[1:01:46] that hallelujah and I have to be careful
[1:01:50] even now oh and everything because we
[1:01:58] are children of God as I said our
[1:02:01] greatest enemy is ourselves
[1:02:06] and sometimes we fall into situations
[1:02:09] and we can't blame God about it for it
[1:02:12] is it's but he also uses it as a tool of
[1:02:18] teaching he teaches us
[1:02:22] that's why the Bible said adjust man
[1:02:24] fall seven times in a day and he gets up
[1:02:27] he would never fall if he only would
[1:02:32] listen to the voice of God is that right
[1:02:36] oh that's why David said the Lord is my
[1:02:40] shepherd and has shared now walked right
[1:02:43] and he understood though he leads me
[1:02:46] though I walk in the valley in the
[1:02:48] shadow of death I'll fear no evil for
[1:02:51] thou art with me
[1:02:53] see as long as he's with you faint King
[1:02:56] grab you he can't touch you and what
[1:02:58] looks looks really like he's looks like
[1:03:03] the strongman yeah y'all notice man look
[1:03:08] at Israel who had a promise of God
[1:03:11] and here was Goliath
[1:03:15] they fell into something I'm sure that
[1:03:19] the Israelites didn't realize that
[1:03:21] Goliath was coming they were just
[1:03:24] fighting the Philistines they didn't
[1:03:26] know the first signs had a secret weapon
[1:03:29] hallelujah
[1:03:30] is that right but they also the
[1:03:34] Philistine didn't know that God had a
[1:03:35] secret weapon and you must understand
[1:03:39] that when it looks like the devil is
[1:03:41] getting the best of you there's a secret
[1:03:44] weapon somewhere God has something I
[1:03:47] heard a brother saying like this he
[1:03:48] preached it he said God has something
[1:03:50] obviously he always gonna bring you out
[1:03:56] he will bring fate unto the belly
[1:04:03] disastrous you think the devil wouldn't
[1:04:06] know by now not to touch God's anointed
[1:04:08] you think he'll know better than to come
[1:04:11] even when the Prophet God says if the
[1:04:13] weakest saying get down to pray Satan
[1:04:16] shakes he troubles because it doesn't
[1:04:19] matter how weak you feel because the
[1:04:22] Bible says when you're weak he's strong
[1:04:26] that right I read the scripture even if
[1:04:31] you fall God is there to keep you
[1:04:36] hallelujah
[1:04:37] it ought to really confused at there
[1:04:39] because when he fell it was it but even
[1:04:42] now how many times God forgive us
[1:04:45] because of our foolishness and you know
[1:04:48] what foolishness is that brings on a bad
[1:04:52] ending it's when we fail as I said again
[1:04:56] Lord not my will but thine be done
[1:05:05] is that okay let me ask you a question
[1:05:07] its obedient to the word is something
[1:05:11] it's not always looked upon I mean you
[1:05:15] don't always come out looking good
[1:05:18] think about it Jesus who had divine
[1:05:21] healing he was and he did and God told
[1:05:27] him go by the Pool of Bethesda and all
[1:05:30] of those sick people sicker than the man
[1:05:33] who who who who was rushing off of the
[1:05:35] car sicker brother I said there were
[1:05:39] people much sicker than he was but God
[1:05:42] came to that man take up your bed and
[1:05:47] walk
[1:05:48] and the healing campaign was over
[1:05:52] there was no more no one else but had he
[1:05:55] not done that you shoot him saying he
[1:05:58] was the kind of a person that can hear
[1:06:00] the voice of God and obey the voice of
[1:06:02] God but look at all that we have in this
[1:06:06] day what is the fate of those men who
[1:06:09] lose that gift for so many of them it's
[1:06:16] a real gift but they use God as a
[1:06:20] Hollywood show and their fate ain't
[1:06:26] looking good
[1:06:29] y'all understand what I'm sayin
[1:06:31] obedience is better than sacrifice
[1:06:37] listen just a quote from kingdom
[1:06:40] redeemer Americans act like Americans
[1:06:44] Germans
[1:06:45] act like Germans because their that's
[1:06:48] their national spirit now I'm saying
[1:06:51] something here because I don't really
[1:06:53] think that the people that with the Holy
[1:06:55] Ghost understand how you and I must be
[1:06:59] controlled by the spirit that comes from
[1:07:01] above we battle every one of us battle
[1:07:04] every day with demons from from beneath
[1:07:07] but you gotta break the holes why
[1:07:10] because they want to put you in a
[1:07:12] position where God backs up
[1:07:17] they're trying to give you a disastrous
[1:07:20] here but there is a word of god this is
[1:07:24] listen I have thoughts of you I'm in a
[1:07:28] great expectation and know that I want
[1:07:31] to give you and I have already given you
[1:07:33] and expected in not one of his famous
[1:07:37] sadness but one of success that's what
[1:07:41] God has given to us that word holds us
[1:07:45] keeps us right in that framework
[1:07:49] otherwise we would be just like anybody
[1:07:52] else making foolish mistakes but this is
[1:07:56] our guy and God knows I need this guy I
[1:08:00] don't know what I'd do without this guy
[1:08:04] hallelujah
[1:08:05] listen the Holy Spirit's coming from
[1:08:10] above from God and you know it's the
[1:08:13] truth every nation has a national spirit
[1:08:16] and out of heaven and you act like that
[1:08:18] makes you conduct yourself as they do up
[1:08:22] there because you are of another world I
[1:08:25] love that I preach on it we're from
[1:08:29] another world we must live like we're
[1:08:31] from another world
[1:08:34] in the near future I'm gonna have an all
[1:08:37] men's meeting and all women's meeting
[1:08:40] I'm gonna call the churches together
[1:08:42] because until we get up we need to
[1:08:45] understand that we are the we are the
[1:08:49] standard of what mere men supposed to be
[1:08:54] we are the standard of what women are
[1:08:57] supposed to be y'all hear what I'm
[1:08:59] saying let me say it again but if we get
[1:09:03] confused on the standard then where is
[1:09:07] the standard
[1:09:10] we are living in a society that really
[1:09:13] don't know what the standard of a
[1:09:15] woman's supposed to be and the standard
[1:09:17] of a man supposed to be huh that's why
[1:09:20] we ugly stop we make so foolish mistakes
[1:09:23] and you know what it's it's because of
[1:09:26] what Adam and Eve did is to faint I
[1:09:30] heard a brother say the other day which
[1:09:32] is so true did you not know that every
[1:09:35] religion came from the fall
[1:09:37] it used to be truth Adam and Eve lived
[1:09:41] under truth but when they fell it kept
[1:09:46] going farther and farther and farther
[1:09:48] and farther away till we got all kinds
[1:09:51] of cults all kinds of religions all
[1:09:52] kinds of gods and they all started from
[1:09:55] the same place
[1:09:59] because really when you leave the Word
[1:10:02] of God you plunge into darkness that's
[1:10:05] what happens and it just like us in the
[1:10:09] daytime in this period of time we look
[1:10:12] at things where well well well let me
[1:10:14] say like this there's a king by the name
[1:10:18] of never kanessa and never could never
[1:10:21] had an experience with God I don't know
[1:10:25] whether he was save a doctor but never
[1:10:27] could never knew that the God of Israel
[1:10:29] was the God of Israel and I think that
[1:10:33] the chance I was either his nephew a
[1:10:35] relative
[1:10:36] we know he was son but we find out in
[1:10:41] Daniel instead of staying with the laws
[1:10:45] of God knowing what had happened to
[1:10:48] never kanessa better chairs they thought
[1:10:51] he was going to have a different kind of
[1:10:53] life see he knew the difference heard
[1:10:58] about it but he thought I'm going to do
[1:11:01] what I want to do and see that's what
[1:11:03] I'm saying that's what happens we know
[1:11:05] the truth we know the word and we still
[1:11:09] feel that we can do what we want to do
[1:11:11] see that's the thing
[1:11:14] we fail to see that the profit that was
[1:11:16] in the profit still lives Jesus Christ
[1:11:23] is the profit he's a prophet of our
[1:11:25] prophets and he sees everything every
[1:11:30] move we make he sees it and he knows the
[1:11:34] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[1:11:36] commotion about it it is listen God
[1:11:39] gives us will he'll never take your will
[1:11:42] your wheel will always have to be in
[1:11:45] order for God to work with you you must
[1:11:47] give your wheel to him he'll never take
[1:11:50] it he will always make you allow you to
[1:11:54] make your charges whether it be good or
[1:11:57] evil thank God for his protection thank
[1:12:03] God that God even died for our
[1:12:04] iniquities hallelujah that's when we
[1:12:08] know to do good and we do it not right
[1:12:13] if I was from a below my that's what
[1:12:17] Jesus said let me go back up to this
[1:12:18] quote we live from above because we're
[1:12:21] born from above all Christians come from
[1:12:23] above Jesus said I am NOT from below
[1:12:26] I'm above if I was from a below my
[1:12:30] subjects will fight for me but my
[1:12:34] kingdom is from above so is every man
[1:12:36] that's born of the kingdom of God he's
[1:12:38] from above yeah I understand what I'm
[1:12:41] saying so if he's from the but from
[1:12:43] above he is a part of God's dynasty he
[1:12:49] he is a part he thinks like that he
[1:12:51] think that's what about said let this
[1:12:53] mind be new that was also in Christ
[1:12:56] Jesus this is what I love the Bible says
[1:12:58] Jesus wouldn't do nothing until he saw
[1:13:03] the father's doing it every thought that
[1:13:06] came from God he received it he didn't
[1:13:09] ask questions
[1:13:11] he just did what God wanted him to do
[1:13:14] even if it seemed like it was putting
[1:13:17] him in harm's way
[1:13:23] but foolishness is when you don't give
[1:13:25] God's Word the consideration that's what
[1:13:29] happened to Adam and Eve they put it
[1:13:32] this way Eve because he was deceived
[1:13:34] Adam was not but I wonder that I don't
[1:13:37] think now if I do this and I say Eve
[1:13:40] what will be the results or the end
[1:13:43] results of it I think if he had a whole
[1:13:45] a clear picture of the things that we're
[1:13:48] suffering now because of their
[1:13:50] disobedience I'm not sure on how his
[1:13:54] response would have been and maybe he
[1:13:56] did see it I don't know but my question
[1:14:00] is and what we all do we do stooop my
[1:14:03] wife said I should that's right bad word
[1:14:05] I'm trying to change it we do bad things
[1:14:11] we do bad things not realizing there is
[1:14:14] a consequence God came changes were
[1:14:19] because of us whatsoever man so he will
[1:14:22] also reap that is just the word
[1:14:28] have you ever done something wrong that
[1:14:30] mistake and you still reaped it hello
[1:14:36] you know you stumbled and you threw out
[1:14:39] some seeds
[1:14:40] you didn't mean the sword Oh Sees there
[1:14:42] but give time to grow see something's
[1:14:49] gonna happen to him and that's what
[1:14:50] happened to us sometime
[1:14:52] we unintentionally do something all
[1:14:54] because we've stopped following the
[1:14:57] Shepherd it's when you stop following
[1:15:00] the Shepherd and start falling within
[1:15:03] your own wheel in your own mind is when
[1:15:05] you make mistakes
[1:15:06] I hope I'm helping you this morning but
[1:15:11] here Belcher says our and then in their
[1:15:14] drunken party thinking God don't see God
[1:15:18] sees everything all of a sudden they
[1:15:23] were so drunk I don't know what they
[1:15:24] were thinking but a hands not come from
[1:15:27] somewhere it's not writing on the wall
[1:15:30] what happened to us the same thing
[1:15:33] sometimes we engage in things during the
[1:15:36] day and then the preacher comes and
[1:15:37] knock it for you
[1:15:38] you think somebody done told him you
[1:15:40] didn't tell nobody but Jesus knows what
[1:15:43] we do and his God coming down like the
[1:15:48] handwriting on the wall it is up to us
[1:15:51] to repent but when it came to that dish
[1:15:54] as I admit that he was right why because
[1:15:57] he crossed the line he knew better and
[1:16:00] God said because of what you've done the
[1:16:03] person's gonna take your kingdom that's
[1:16:07] right Dan you're fired not only did they
[1:16:10] take take his kingdom when he was killed
[1:16:12] the very night
[1:16:17] is that right Solomon and all his wisdom
[1:16:23] look at the end of Solomon
[1:16:27] I believe he was saved but he died in
[1:16:31] embarrassment the great man of God that
[1:16:37] produced such a season in Israel it was
[1:16:40] like the Millennium but he got caught up
[1:16:44] by making wrong decisions foolish
[1:16:48] decisions
[1:16:52] but one thing I love about Solomon he
[1:16:54] did not fail to leave us instructions
[1:16:57] and he says listen I've tried everything
[1:17:00] I've done everything that came in my
[1:17:04] mind to do and I came to conclusion
[1:17:07] the thing that I'm and to do the whole
[1:17:12] duty of man is to fear God and keep his
[1:17:17] Commandments for God shall bring every
[1:17:21] work into judgment every secret thing
[1:17:24] whether it be good or whether it be evil
[1:17:27] Solomon said listen I'm gonna be judged
[1:17:30] for everything I hope I'm making sense
[1:17:33] and the reason why I'm bringing this out
[1:17:35] of trying to bring it out the best way I
[1:17:37] know how because we're at the end and
[1:17:42] the Bible said that the bride of Jesus
[1:17:45] Christ will be without spot wrinkle or
[1:17:47] blemish and God can't change his word
[1:17:50] for you
[1:17:52] this is not potential it's a reality
[1:17:55] that the bride of Jesus Christ must come
[1:17:57] to a place which he has no spot wrinkle
[1:17:59] or blemish
[1:18:02] without all right she's got to be safe
[1:18:04] to fire and she's had to be filled with
[1:18:05] the Holy Ghost and she's got to come up
[1:18:07] to the Statue of a perfect man to make a
[1:18:09] rapture now I'm not saying they have
[1:18:12] many um who will lose out and not be
[1:18:14] saying no the foolish virgins what made
[1:18:19] them foolish because they heard the
[1:18:20] midnight cry and they were doll Ettore
[1:18:26] they weren't about their father's
[1:18:28] business the pub's had trimmed - laughs
[1:18:31] that means sanctify yourself trim your
[1:18:34] left cut off all the world circumcise
[1:18:37] your heart that's the Holy Ghost feel
[1:18:40] you seal you give us up your oil what I
[1:18:45] owe go buy and sell for your going get
[1:18:49] something for yourself how did you get
[1:18:52] it down on my knees hallelujah I'm
[1:18:57] telling you prayer is the key
[1:19:01] whenever you find yourself in a bit
[1:19:04] that's what David said My Lord is great
[1:19:06] I was in a horrible pick but he
[1:19:10] delivered me and he set my feet upon a
[1:19:12] rock he didn't get out of that pit by
[1:19:15] throwing a rope over there and climbing
[1:19:16] out himself pride whatever faith
[1:19:21] whatever got him in that that was his
[1:19:23] faith but he had faith to get out of it
[1:19:26] every situation you into right now you
[1:19:28] can get out of you don't have to stay
[1:19:31] there the devil will make you feel like
[1:19:34] you hopeless and ain't no way you can
[1:19:35] get out of this oh my I've been this way
[1:19:37] all my life God don't care that man who
[1:19:40] was blind 30 years was there crying all
[1:19:42] his life and God gave him sight you sure
[1:19:49] he didn't nobody educated in him he even
[1:19:52] found them fundamentally taught no sure
[1:19:55] all you had to do was fake to believe
[1:19:57] that Jesus could do it in Jesus did it
[1:19:59] well would you have a minute I want my
[1:20:02] sight that was it hallelujah that all
[1:20:06] right I wish
[1:20:11] sometimes I think you know what you say
[1:20:14] saying some things are unavoidable but
[1:20:16] we must understand that everything is
[1:20:18] planned and set by God right the
[1:20:21] footsteps of a righteous man are ordered
[1:20:23] by the Lord and if we end up in a
[1:20:25] disastrous situation doesn't mean that
[1:20:28] God can't gonna just let you stay there
[1:20:30] or I put it this way if we find
[1:20:32] ourselves in a position that we do not
[1:20:36] like to be into one thing God will do he
[1:20:40] still will talk to you what's it mean
[1:20:43] brother brother God the Bible says that
[1:20:47] the Lord knows how to deliver the
[1:20:49] righteous
[1:20:52] not out of some of the things all of
[1:20:55] them many other affliction of the
[1:20:57] righteous and God would deliver us from
[1:21:00] them all now it's up to us to believe
[1:21:03] that we can be delivered faith say you
[1:21:08] can be delivered crippled blind lame
[1:21:13] whatever you can be delivered you know
[1:21:16] it's just like people all I'm in my
[1:21:18] stage four cancer so uh if you know the
[1:21:23] deliverer I don't know maybe I'm wrong
[1:21:26] but I just say it like this if a man by
[1:21:29] the name of Hezekiah can pray and God
[1:21:32] can give him 15 more years what about
[1:21:34] you cancer is not you know it doesn't
[1:21:39] necessarily have to be you'll find or
[1:21:41] your fate and foolishness and things
[1:21:45] like that
[1:21:46] my point is if you seek God this is what
[1:21:49] I tell people I said listen if God don't
[1:21:52] tell me I'm dying I ain't dying you say
[1:21:56] why do you get that from because I look
[1:21:58] in the word and every true believer of
[1:22:00] God I believe God tells them brother
[1:22:04] Bosworth are you sick
[1:22:07] either no brother and I'm not sick I'm
[1:22:11] just getting too old to live
[1:22:13] these are you afraid to die he said I
[1:22:16] cannot die
[1:22:17] I died years ago somebody help me here
[1:22:20] but you see God had told he says look no
[1:22:23] further than him it is nothing like that
[1:22:25] I'm going home
[1:22:28] see he was a righteous man God showed
[1:22:31] him that dad had no hold on him it
[1:22:34] looked like his faith but he knew that
[1:22:37] death had no hope that was not his faith
[1:22:40] and God proved it to him
[1:22:42] before he died he was shaking hands with
[1:22:44] his relatives
[1:22:47] we can't allow anything anything Amen
[1:22:51] become a threat to us
[1:22:54] because we conquer all we are the
[1:22:57] conquerors and if you really believed
[1:22:59] that you would with God before the
[1:23:01] foundation the world and you were with
[1:23:03] him now and he's in you all things are
[1:23:06] possible
[1:23:06] I still wonder how David was able to
[1:23:14] take Sampson scuse me was able to take
[1:23:17] the jawbone of an ass and kill all those
[1:23:20] feelings stands with it it looks like a
[1:23:23] horrible situation he was into oh this
[1:23:26] is you're in there's no way you could
[1:23:28] whip all those but something happened to
[1:23:30] it
[1:23:30] faith struck him now that which look
[1:23:35] like faith became Victoria victory for
[1:23:38] him that's all I'm saying
[1:23:40] you and I have the ability to change
[1:23:42] these things but if you are foolish to
[1:23:46] believe that God can't change it it
[1:23:49] becomes your fate
[1:23:52] whatever that might be
[1:23:55] [Music]
[1:23:57] but the Benham says here he says one
[1:23:59] night on the platform I looked and Here
[1:24:01] Come on a poor Mexican old Mexican
[1:24:04] brother blind as he could be his feet
[1:24:07] bare calloused all over his old hat in
[1:24:11] his hand sewed with quartz his trouser
[1:24:14] legs tore off up there I looked at him
[1:24:17] dusty all over he was coming along the
[1:24:20] those holding his hat in his hand he was
[1:24:23] mumbling mumbling off something to the
[1:24:26] man that was bringing him when he got
[1:24:29] close to me he reached down in his
[1:24:31] pocket and got out a little kusa thick
[1:24:33] and began to say Hail Mary I had him to
[1:24:36] put it up and so he come up there and I
[1:24:39] looked at him and I thought here's a
[1:24:41] poor old fella probably never had a
[1:24:43] decent meal in his life there he is now
[1:24:47] looking not even shoes on it here I
[1:24:49] stand with good pair of shoes here I
[1:24:52] stand with a suit I believe this is the
[1:24:54] same suit brother car and Williams and
[1:24:56] his bike
[1:24:57] give me there and he says I was standing
[1:25:00] there and I thought here I could I got a
[1:25:01] suit on I thought I put my shoe
[1:25:03] shoulders and and I thought if I could
[1:25:05] fit him I should give it to him but I
[1:25:08] put my feet and the side of his and it
[1:25:11] wouldn't fit him and all and I thought
[1:25:14] what could I do and I thought there he
[1:25:16] is staggering in blindness poor old
[1:25:19] fella you've got to feel for the people
[1:25:22] you see you got a feel for if somebody's
[1:25:25] in the situation is in bad circumstances
[1:25:27] you got a feel for why you are the
[1:25:33] deliverer because the deliverer is in
[1:25:36] you
[1:25:38] if we don't think ourselves to be sons
[1:25:41] of God if we don't think we can change
[1:25:42] the atmosphere if we don't think that we
[1:25:44] can change the fate of people then who
[1:25:47] are we what are you here for because
[1:25:51] listen in the Bible everybody can't
[1:25:53] jesus came in contact with was changed
[1:25:56] something happened to them especially
[1:25:58] when they were coming for the change huh
[1:26:02] oh what about the woman at the well what
[1:26:05] about the woman in Simon's house they're
[1:26:07] faint
[1:26:08] whatever happened plunged him into being
[1:26:10] prostitutes but faith brought it out
[1:26:14] faith delivered them out of that right
[1:26:16] by somebody else's foolish decision they
[1:26:20] were plunged into a dark situation oh
[1:26:23] it's true and it's not always somebody
[1:26:25] else's fault or the person's fault
[1:26:27] sometimes somebody else makes it let me
[1:26:30] put it this way what about those four
[1:26:32] hundred men preachers that that that
[1:26:34] literally refused the message of the
[1:26:37] hour and they went back preaching and
[1:26:41] the Bible says the blind leaders lead
[1:26:43] the blind they over there and
[1:26:45] everybody's shouting and dancing and
[1:26:47] speaking in tongues and running and
[1:26:48] everything else pay the costos but the
[1:26:51] faint but those people was death because
[1:26:56] the leader right refused the word
[1:27:01] but in all of that God still have a seed
[1:27:06] and it's the seed of God that ends up
[1:27:10] into these particular situations and the
[1:27:14] Bible says everyone that has a clean
[1:27:17] heart escapes
[1:27:20] everybody that has a desire to serve God
[1:27:23] will xscape that's it that's how we
[1:27:27] escaped because of the seed of God
[1:27:29] that's in us now you say what brother
[1:27:32] was where you going with this I know I'm
[1:27:34] throwing out a lot of thinking but I'm
[1:27:36] hoping that you get what I'm trying to
[1:27:37] say see some things happen because of
[1:27:41] somebody else's foolish decision and
[1:27:43] some things happen because of our
[1:27:45] decisions right but when it comes to
[1:27:50] fate even it always because of
[1:27:53] somebody's foolishness that's how it
[1:27:57] started
[1:27:57] that's how it is people receive the mark
[1:28:01] of the beast because they make a
[1:28:03] decision and the market of beans become
[1:28:07] their fate because they made a foolish
[1:28:10] decision not to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:28:12] the foolish versions heard the message
[1:28:17] heard the word but because of their
[1:28:20] decision they went through the
[1:28:21] tribulation period see
[1:28:25] hallelujah somebody I know you're tired
[1:28:32] and it's hot in here
[1:28:33] so it's kind of difficult to concentrate
[1:28:35] I understand
[1:28:36] but let me move on I'm almost done I'm
[1:28:41] only gonna be too much longer because I
[1:28:44] want you to understand that if the
[1:28:45] footsteps of a righteous man are ordered
[1:28:47] by the Lord God will deliver you now you
[1:28:52] say well what do you mean job Joan
[1:28:55] excuse me running from the presence of
[1:28:57] the Lord he ends up into a whale of a
[1:29:00] Bennett I'm barely awake
[1:29:05] I know I didn't do that just now but I
[1:29:08] did in the belly of a whale and we find
[1:29:14] out I'm thinking about that heat folks
[1:29:16] I'm sorry but I'm you know the thing is
[1:29:18] he did not let that faint because his
[1:29:22] decision plunged him into that position
[1:29:25] right
[1:29:26] and he wouldn't loud that to conquer him
[1:29:30] you see what I'm saying you can end up
[1:29:32] into a bad position but that don't mean
[1:29:35] you can you need to let it conquer you
[1:29:37] bring out some faith bring out some
[1:29:40] faith believe God ask anything you will
[1:29:44] and he said if you believe it it shall
[1:29:46] be yours
[1:29:47] I just believe that
[1:29:51] second Kings and and I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1:29:55] close on this let me make sure I get the
[1:29:57] right one
[1:29:59] I'm working with here
[1:30:03] remember the Shulamite woman there in
[1:30:05] second Kings second chapter that
[1:30:08] Shunammite woman
[1:30:11] y'all know the law
[1:30:14] back in the day when you couldn't pay
[1:30:16] your debt you had sons
[1:30:19] they can take your sons as debt that's
[1:30:22] what the Jubilee is all about this lady
[1:30:24] husband died she she she she she
[1:30:28] couldn't pay her death
[1:30:33] and no doubt the man comes as oh I'm
[1:30:36] sorry but you either pay your debt why
[1:30:39] take your son
[1:30:42] but God always see us when we in those
[1:30:45] bad positions
[1:30:47] he always make a way of escape the Bible
[1:30:50] says with every temptation God makes a
[1:30:53] way of extending he makes a way of
[1:30:55] escape it's not that the way is already
[1:30:57] there he makes it he literally a man
[1:31:02] crafts it just for you
[1:31:04] he opened the door that you even know
[1:31:06] was there
[1:31:08] and it's up to you to go through the
[1:31:10] door
[1:31:13] and here come Elijah Elijah brother
[1:31:18] and y'all know the story he loves them
[1:31:21] listen well I'll tell you what go get me
[1:31:25] some empty vessels
[1:31:27] and I love this part because God need
[1:31:30] empty vessels
[1:31:31] he can't use you to you empty yourself
[1:31:34] he can't fill you unto you empty
[1:31:37] yourself he does that go give me some
[1:31:40] some feel that no give me some empty
[1:31:42] vessels and God is gonna feel it you see
[1:31:48] and that's the thing we fail to see that
[1:31:50] that's what God can't even work with us
[1:31:53] unto God you empty yourself these are
[1:31:57] all God I want to be great well first of
[1:32:00] all you'll never be great because you
[1:32:01] won't to be
[1:32:05] it ain't about you God in interested in
[1:32:08] your ability
[1:32:09] that's where preachers mess up that's
[1:32:11] where song leaders mess up that's where
[1:32:14] musicians mess up that's where all the
[1:32:16] gifts mess up because sometimes we get
[1:32:18] in ourselves and we think we can do it
[1:32:21] you can't do nothing if we don't humble
[1:32:26] ourselves amen before the Lord gives me
[1:32:28] out and let God do it you can always
[1:32:33] tell people get all lift it up arrogance
[1:32:35] and all that God ain't in that
[1:32:45] you now must understand Amen that God is
[1:32:48] looking for somebody who can empty
[1:32:52] themselves and do some great things I'm
[1:32:54] trying not to read Because because of
[1:32:57] the timing because what's happening but
[1:32:59] nevertheless we realize a man that God
[1:33:01] God is looking for you to once he gives
[1:33:03] you something he's looking for you to
[1:33:05] give it back to her
[1:33:09] I feel the dozens up with oil
[1:33:13] and the woman never ran out no doubt she
[1:33:17] could perhaps sell a little bit of
[1:33:18] something something you know
[1:33:21] but she gave back to God what God gave
[1:33:23] back to her
[1:33:25] I think about even even even enough when
[1:33:28] I was thinking about this tonight this
[1:33:30] little thought coming I thought oh look
[1:33:33] how beautiful God is here was a woman
[1:33:36] that we mentioned her and we ought to
[1:33:38] close with that we mentioned her how God
[1:33:40] comes along and and this woman by
[1:33:43] somebody's else's word she finds her way
[1:33:45] to Simon's house and she literally get
[1:33:49] get an alabaster box
[1:33:53] and before God can even do something I
[1:33:56] guess she just felt privileged that his
[1:33:59] she was washing the feet of a prophet
[1:34:01] the Messiah she's anointing him huh
[1:34:07] northing him and you know what this is
[1:34:09] what I just don't understand how come
[1:34:11] people come to church and they want God
[1:34:13] to always give them but they don't give
[1:34:15] God nothing it's your decision
[1:34:20] don't you know that God inhabits the
[1:34:22] praises of me you give God praise he
[1:34:26] will break your chains he will set you
[1:34:29] free
[1:34:30] oh you said what do you mean I don't
[1:34:32] care if they say you and stays for five
[1:34:34] or six if you give God the praise he
[1:34:37] will break every chain you don't break
[1:34:42] you know you don't make foolish decision
[1:34:45] oh I'm just so sick I just can't hardly
[1:34:47] take it no that's my advantage
[1:34:51] hallelujah Jordan and Jonathan care
[1:34:54] where he was I don't care if he smelt
[1:34:56] the stench of everything in the belly of
[1:34:58] the whale even he realized that God had
[1:35:02] already shown him by faith that was not
[1:35:05] his fate he's not going down that way
[1:35:08] hallelujah I don't care they're like
[1:35:11] everything's going wild and crazy but
[1:35:14] let me tell you something the Bible said
[1:35:15] that God hears the prayers of the
[1:35:18] righteous hallelujah and we're not
[1:35:21] righteous overall but when you know that
[1:35:23] the blood of Jesus Christ has covered
[1:35:25] you you can pray and believe God is
[1:35:28] going to answer because he will he will
[1:35:34] she gives that out of the bracelet oh I
[1:35:37] just I wish I was there I would have
[1:35:40] loved to see that you know you think
[1:35:43] they're gonna rehearse it when I get
[1:35:44] over there
[1:35:46] take me back time cuz you know I'm a
[1:35:48] time traveler take me back in that day
[1:35:50] so I could just see how I was actually
[1:35:53] darling wouldn't that be wonderful he
[1:35:55] can do it my thing is you know she just
[1:35:58] washed his feet and cried and everything
[1:36:00] else I don't know what kind of makeup
[1:36:02] she had on but whatever she had it was
[1:36:05] all smeared everywhere have you ever
[1:36:07] seen a woman with smeared makeup that's
[1:36:09] really horrifying yeah but anyway she
[1:36:13] went on to do everything she this is the
[1:36:15] part of M say God I let you worship
[1:36:20] if you really want to hear even let you
[1:36:24] get out of order worshipping him because
[1:36:27] he loves wash up and we're so afraid to
[1:36:31] wash it but don't you understand when
[1:36:34] you give God worship you're literally
[1:36:36] giving back to him what he's already
[1:36:38] given to you
[1:36:40] you're not been created to do so oh my I
[1:36:44] can't seem to get this over like I want
[1:36:46] to but my quote my thought is that we're
[1:36:49] in a time we use in all these examples
[1:36:51] so that you understand that no matter
[1:36:53] where you are at this point in your life
[1:36:56] we're talking about a rapture we're
[1:36:59] talking about being killed we're talking
[1:37:01] about being clean we're talking about
[1:37:02] being without spot wrinkle or blemish I
[1:37:05] don't care where you are you've got to
[1:37:08] believe that that's not your fate
[1:37:11] you're not going to remain here and God
[1:37:14] is going to bring you to victory you
[1:37:17] have to believe that your faith must
[1:37:19] strike somewhere and if they can strike
[1:37:22] Amen in the right place which is your
[1:37:24] heart it would defeat fate and deliver
[1:37:27] you from whatever condition you're into
[1:37:30] right now I believe that with all my
[1:37:33] heart
[1:37:34] hallelujah I believe that with all of my
[1:37:37] heart you don't have to remain in the
[1:37:40] conditions well I've been like this all
[1:37:42] my life
[1:37:43] God don't care about that that's a sorry
[1:37:45] excuse when Jesus passed by that woman
[1:37:49] saw him said but if I just touch the hem
[1:37:50] of His garment I'll be made whole that's
[1:37:53] all you need to touch him or let him
[1:37:54] touch you don't oh it's your truth well
[1:37:59] you know probation he had people in the
[1:38:01] prayer line they were healed but they
[1:38:04] did not have the faith to grab it so
[1:38:08] they left out sick but God had already
[1:38:12] healed to be even so we've got it heal
[1:38:14] them so oh lord help me
[1:38:16] give me something to say to that person
[1:38:18] so he gonna listen if I don't say it
[1:38:22] you think about that how how unbelief
[1:38:27] can be so strong and you have God
[1:38:30] properly tell you you healed and you
[1:38:34] won't believe it because you're looking
[1:38:35] at condition you're feeling sorry for
[1:38:37] yourself and you believe that's just
[1:38:39] your fate mmm
[1:38:41] help us Jesus help us help us help us
[1:38:45] you mean to tell me that God I take a
[1:38:47] little fishy that that guts is already
[1:38:50] pulled out and give his life and then
[1:38:52] look over you
[1:38:59] opossum a man on his way out full of
[1:39:02] wines and everything is dying and God
[1:39:04] heals an opossum stinking nasty
[1:39:11] and then we look at like this
[1:39:14] you wanna let her dump down I'll have
[1:39:16] more faith than you
[1:39:20] a dumb animal
[1:39:22] eleven that's pretty worse than that I
[1:39:24] did
[1:39:30] and God did all of those things so that
[1:39:33] you and I can know that with him all
[1:39:35] things are possible
[1:39:42] I'm pretty close
[1:39:44] so did you understand
[1:39:48] if you have a disastrous
[1:39:52] is only because you have been you've
[1:39:54] been influenced with foolish
[1:39:58] disbelieving the word
[1:40:02] then God said I've given you the
[1:40:04] expected
[1:40:06] he's giving you the word and faith will
[1:40:10] conquer fate
[1:40:12] cien brought us into this fate none of
[1:40:15] us in desire to be here it's something
[1:40:17] Adam and he did and because they did it
[1:40:20] we do it because that's the sin nature
[1:40:24] they Bobby said that Columbine can even
[1:40:27] would proceed things that are spiritual
[1:40:30] because we in image are natural fathers
[1:40:34] we do what they do
[1:40:35] but God says aren't you must be born
[1:40:38] again you must be born of it from above
[1:40:41] in order to follow me in the way that
[1:40:43] you should help us Jesus
[1:40:48] y'all hear me because the Lord is soon
[1:40:52] to come don't give up on God because he
[1:40:54] will not give up on you
[1:40:56] don't let these messages discourage you
[1:40:58] they're not here to discourage you
[1:41:00] they're here to shine the light on you
[1:41:02] to show you where you stand in God
[1:41:06] but because we find ourselves in a
[1:41:09] crippled way or put a bad place a Harvey
[1:41:12] Wallace say it doesn't mean that we must
[1:41:14] remain
[1:41:14] oh come on somebody fete a man puts you
[1:41:18] in the grave and faiths come get you out
[1:41:19] of it
[1:41:23] you love the Lord I hope I hope I was
[1:41:26] able to bless you tonight in that way I
[1:41:28] I believe God gave me that message I
[1:41:30] just feel like I don't know but I trust
[1:41:34] that something was said to make you
[1:41:35] realize that yes it seems almost
[1:41:38] impossible because you see all the
[1:41:41] things that you've got to overcome to
[1:41:43] get there but those things means nothing
[1:41:45] to God God can change things at the snap
[1:41:48] of his finger but he needs you to have
[1:41:51] faith in Him to do it is that right when
[1:41:56] it came to Lazarus amen he's not looking
[1:41:58] it looked like fate got put in there you
[1:42:00] know it looked like it's a it's a
[1:42:02] situation that can't not be resolved as
[1:42:04] a situation that's impossible in married
[1:42:07] mother we've never seen that like that
[1:42:09] he's been dead for days but you said I
[1:42:12] want you to understand I'm the
[1:42:13] resurrection I can change things just by
[1:42:17] the speaking with my voice my words
[1:42:19] would change the situation his word will
[1:42:22] change your situation and all you had to
[1:42:26] do was call laughs by name and then been
[1:42:29] dead for days worms and stinking and
[1:42:31] everything else there and then God calls
[1:42:33] him by naming he comes back to life so I
[1:42:36] said this if your situation is worse
[1:42:40] than that
[1:42:42] then maybe I can see where you can have
[1:42:47] a little problem with believing but
[1:42:49] nobody in here has a condition like that
[1:42:53] no not in your life where it seems like
[1:42:56] it your situation is so rotted and it
[1:42:58] got worms in it and if it is you believe
[1:43:03] this you believe that God that same God
[1:43:06] is gonna call the dust of the earth and
[1:43:09] it's gonna come back oh yeah
[1:43:13] Ezekiel said I saw bones they're dried
[1:43:16] bones are me wounded and killed in
[1:43:20] battle
[1:43:22] why what happened
[1:43:25] but God says still they're mine
[1:43:28] and he calls in my name and they come
[1:43:32] together and they become a mighty army
[1:43:34] and that's what I'm saying if God has
[1:43:38] called you no matter how dare you were
[1:43:41] when he got you maybe he was a dry bone
[1:43:43] maybe you had you know I don't know
[1:43:45] where you were and I don't know where
[1:43:47] you are but the same God that spoke life
[1:43:50] to you those bones speaking life to you
[1:43:53] now it's up to us to decide whether we
[1:43:56] gonna go forward let me tell you
[1:43:58] something I cannot fathom in my mind
[1:44:00] missing the rapture and that's something
[1:44:03] you do not want to miss well how are you
[1:44:06] gonna make it by His grace but I know if
[1:44:09] I have faith in Him and trust him
[1:44:12] according to his word
[1:44:13] he that begun the good work at me and
[1:44:15] favoriting believe you see I know I'm
[1:44:17] gonna make it on his word believing him
[1:44:21] trusting him yes we all have issues in
[1:44:25] our lives right now is that about right
[1:44:28] things that we need to be you know God
[1:44:31] to give us great deliverance are like I
[1:44:34] said if you can deny yourself and kill
[1:44:37] your will all your bad habits will stop
[1:44:41] it's the truth that's day
[1:44:55] that old Mexican man you know
[1:44:59] it looked like it was all over forward
[1:45:03] no doubt he suffered many days as a poor
[1:45:06] beggar
[1:45:09] God sent a man of God it's we
[1:45:13] you think awesome oh if we go to Mexico
[1:45:15] we may have maybe there'll be somebody
[1:45:19] Khalu he knew
[1:45:24] just like God knows your conditions he
[1:45:27] knows no guesswork with him and I know
[1:45:33] I'm gonna tell you something I don't
[1:45:34] know who this message is for I know it's
[1:45:36] for me and I know that God is warning
[1:45:39] you to receive like oh my god he's
[1:45:41] making away from me
[1:45:43] I'm escaping through this way by
[1:45:45] trusting his word I can't see it I may
[1:45:48] not understand it I don't need the
[1:45:49] science of it I just know that he said
[1:45:52] you'll do it
[1:45:54] I believe
[1:45:56] let's pray
[1:45:58] father we come before you he's humble
[1:46:03] as we know how
[1:46:05] Lord we thank you for your amazing grace
[1:46:09] as we have said many times we found
[1:46:11] ourselves in conditions in circumstances
[1:46:14] bad words because of our decisions
[1:46:19] finding our self in a place where fate
[1:46:22] has placed
[1:46:25] but father you said that even in those
[1:46:28] darkest times and darkest moments nor
[1:46:31] you bring light into our lives you have
[1:46:35] given us hope you've given us faith
[1:46:37] you've given us understanding of your
[1:46:40] word to trust the Lord that's the whole
[1:46:44] theme of the message only believe all
[1:46:48] things are possible things that seems
[1:46:52] like it just no change ever happen I
[1:46:56] remember the old lady Lord God who had a
[1:46:59] drunken husband came home drunk all the
[1:47:02] time
[1:47:03] no doubt she spent countless hours in
[1:47:06] prayer but one day you heard him and in
[1:47:11] that whole situation she not only proved
[1:47:14] to her husband free is that she was a
[1:47:17] Christian but in that dark moment
[1:47:20] because she stood on your word she made
[1:47:24] your word her decision her light to her
[1:47:27] God you gave her a complete victory not
[1:47:30] only just for a husband but even her
[1:47:33] friends his friends became Christians
[1:47:35] Lord let us be that way
[1:47:38] whatever suffering we gotta go through
[1:47:40] whatever we must do for that name sake
[1:47:42] let us stay with your word help us now
[1:47:45] Jesus let us not make foolish mistakes
[1:47:49] and say foolish things that put us in a
[1:47:51] position of darkness let us continue to
[1:47:56] walk in the light
[1:47:58] let us continue to have fellowship one
[1:48:00] with another Lord o God let your love
[1:48:03] divine keep us
[1:48:09] Ranas featuring Lord no matter where we
[1:48:11] are
[1:48:12] let us be determined that whatever this
[1:48:14] thing that looks like faith whatever
[1:48:17] this prison house is whatever I've done
[1:48:19] to to come to this place or maybe
[1:48:22] somebody else did it I don't know but
[1:48:24] lord I know we don't have to stay you
[1:48:30] have always come to our risk help us now
