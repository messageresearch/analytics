[9:55] blessed those meetings I had not seen
[9:57] God move in such a way there are several
[10:01] people who were possessed with demons
[10:03] that that were God delivered a young
[10:07] lady as well as a young man and a young
[10:10] man when got when the devil left you
[10:12] should have seen him before and after it
[10:14] was amazing
[10:15] and the pastor said well you know the
[10:17] demon is gone he said yeah I felt him
[10:21] he left I mean this man was some type of
[10:24] addiction but he was crying like a baby
[10:27] and God just moved one lady who was
[10:30] listening to the meetings from Maine was
[10:33] healed and just so many so many things
[10:38] happen there and I don't want to say too
[10:40] much but so many had many things
[10:42] wonderful things that Jesus did do it
[10:45] wasn't brother Isaiah Brooks or or
[10:48] brother Ben no rod but it was Jesus
[10:51] Christ who move on the scene I mean we
[10:55] had a shout and good Holy Ghost meeting
[10:57] the people said they hadn't seen that in
[11:00] years and I had not seen it in years
[11:03] either especially the way God came down
[11:05] healed and delivered those young people
[11:09] that were crying out for God Matthew 16
[11:18] yeah you know you provide the atmosphere
[11:20] and God to show up those people came
[11:24] looking for something and God met them
[11:27] yeah so we praise the Lord for allowing
[11:30] us to be part of that we got hold a
[11:35] Monday which was really uh I think
[11:39] started out early my flight was supposed
[11:41] to be like three something jumped up to
[11:44] six something I didn't leave
[11:45] Jacksonville to eight something and from
[11:48] there I jumped to Dallas Fort Worth they
[11:51] were telling me it did look good for me
[11:53] at the first and then God held up a
[11:55] plane and we were able to fly out I got
[11:59] here around eleven forty forty-five
[12:03] Monday night very tired helping
[12:07] everybody else with their stuff in in
[12:11] the the seat back pocket my my iPad but
[12:15] God all my information is there God
[12:19] knows what he's doing
[12:20] he's faithful Matthew 16 beginning at
[12:27] the 13th verse a voice is a little bit
[12:29] tired but by God's grace I trust that
[12:32] God will bless you tonight
[12:34] now when Jesus came into the district of
[12:37] Caesarea Philippi beginning at the 13th
[12:41] verse he asked his disciples who do
[12:44] people say the Son of Man is and they
[12:47] said some say John the Baptist others
[12:50] say Elijah and others Jeremiah or one of
[12:53] the prophets he said that the number who
[12:56] do you say I am
[12:57] that is the question even though this
[13:02] question was posed to his disciples I
[13:04] believe Jesus Christ asked every
[13:07] believer who do you say I am Simon Peter
[13:10] replied ye are the Christ the Son of the
[13:13] Living God and jesus answered him
[13:16] blessed are You Simon bar Jonah for
[13:19] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[13:22] you but my father who is in heaven and
[13:26] I'll tell you you are Peter and on this
[13:29] rock I will build my church and the
[13:31] gates of Hell shall not prevail against
[13:34] it I will give you the keys of the
[13:37] kingdom of heaven and whatsoever you
[13:39] bind on earth shall be bound in heaven
[13:42] and whatever you loose on earth shall be
[13:45] loosed in heaven
[13:46] then he strictly charged his disciples
[13:49] to tell no one that he was the Christ
[13:53] dear Jesus we come before your Lord as
[13:56] humbly as we know how we thank you for
[13:59] being so good to us we thank you for
[14:02] being better to us than we are to
[14:05] ourselves and father we pray that your
[14:08] perfect and divine will will be done
[14:12] amen
[14:13] in Jesus Christ's name let that perfect
[14:16] will be done tonight amen
[14:19] you may be seated I find out that you
[14:27] know many people have their different
[14:29] ideas about faith so tonight I want to
[14:33] minister a thought on faith we a simple
[14:39] message
[14:44] but I've ministered down in Jacksonville
[14:47] something similar not the same but it
[14:49] was by that message that God did do
[14:52] something healed and delivered I
[14:57] realized that faith is something that a
[15:00] lot of people struggle with but it
[15:02] shouldn't be something that we should
[15:04] struggle with first of all faith is a
[15:08] gift from God you know even James said
[15:12] if you like anything if you ask and
[15:15] faith believing that God will give it to
[15:16] you the Bible tells us he'd give it to
[15:19] us and not up and upgraded us not so I
[15:22] believe that is something that God wants
[15:24] all of his believers to have first of
[15:27] all you can't even be saved without
[15:29] faith because the Bible said he that
[15:32] cometh to God must first believe that he
[15:34] is God and that he is a rewarder of them
[15:37] that diligently seek him that has always
[15:40] been our our our downfall because we we
[15:44] think faith is weak we sometime handle
[15:51] faith as if it's something that is
[15:53] natural but faith in itself is
[15:56] supernatural faith as I've said many
[16:00] times here before is God the just shall
[16:05] live by his faith and by faith God
[16:10] created all things the Bible said
[16:13] without it there was nothing made
[16:15] everything God did he first had to
[16:18] believe it himself is that right God has
[16:24] faith in his own word
[16:25] I would like to entitle this message
[16:28] faith like a rock because I realized
[16:34] that when I read the scripture in
[16:36] Matthew Jesus said upon this rock I'll
[16:41] build my church so it's like a rock and
[16:46] we understand that he wasn't talking
[16:48] about himself oh he wasn't talking about
[16:54] Peter and
[16:56] wasn't talking about his disciples
[16:58] because he asked a question whom do men
[17:01] say i the son of man am and some answer
[17:07] different things Jeremiah you know one
[17:10] of the prophets and then Jesus said then
[17:14] Peter said thou art the Christ that
[17:17] revelation in itself could not and
[17:21] cannot come by intellect it actually
[17:25] comes by revelation it's when God
[17:29] reveals to you he is the Christ now we
[17:33] use that word Christ and sometimes we
[17:36] lose it kind of loosely like it's
[17:38] something outside of the Holy Ghost but
[17:42] the Holy Ghost is God Christ is God
[17:46] right Jesus the Christ so when you say
[17:50] Jesus the Christ you literally saying
[17:53] Jesus the God and we realized by God's
[17:57] grace is that a lot of times we fail to
[18:01] see that Jesus the man Jesus was just a
[18:05] covering he was just a housing for the
[18:08] Almighty God the Bible said in him dwelt
[18:12] the fullness of the Godhead bodily and
[18:15] people said well he just a son or he's
[18:18] just a prophet but not only was he a
[18:21] prophet but he was also a son because
[18:24] God made himself man you understand me
[18:28] and he was a prophet because the Spirit
[18:30] of Jesus Christ his prophecy so he was
[18:33] born a prophet not just a prophet he was
[18:37] the Prophet the very theme of this Bible
[18:40] is wrapped around Jesus Christ and we
[18:45] must realize by God's grace that when we
[18:48] recognize who God is we understand that
[18:51] God is not just limited to the physical
[18:55] body of Jesus Christ even though in him
[18:59] dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[19:01] but Jesus Christ was a man there was a
[19:05] little argument about that with a woman
[19:07] who was from a
[19:09] Church of Scientology or something nine
[19:11] of a matter search of Christ kind of
[19:15] people and she argued with the Prophet
[19:18] about Jesus Christ not being divine for
[19:22] the mere fact that he cried oh what a
[19:28] what a weak testimony what a weak
[19:31] argument and you know what they failed
[19:35] to see that Jesus Christ was not only
[19:37] just man but he was also God then they
[19:41] hated Jesus they want to crucify him
[19:43] because they said you being a man make
[19:46] yourself God but what they didn't
[19:49] understand was that God made himself a
[19:51] man see and he dwelt in that body Jesus
[19:57] said I can do nothing except the father
[19:59] show me so Aerith word he spoke that's
[20:03] why there you'll find in Scripture that
[20:05] Jesus never uttered a idle word every
[20:09] word every movement everything he did
[20:11] was inspired by the God inside him and
[20:16] that's why he was able to say in st.
[20:18] John 10:30 I and my father are one
[20:22] coming from Isaiah he said well what do
[20:24] you mean I'm telling you you can't see
[20:27] what God can do until you understand He
[20:29] is God if you don't if you think Jesus
[20:32] Christ is just the second person in the
[20:34] Trinity you have already divided God and
[20:37] you've made him less than the Almighty
[20:40] and the Bible says according to Isaiah
[20:44] that his name would be called wonderful
[20:46] counsellor the Almighty God the Prince
[20:51] of Peace you see so he was the Almighty
[20:54] God in human form right so you said oh
[20:59] what worry that's why even when Peter
[21:02] began to preach he said neither is there
[21:04] salvation in any other for there is none
[21:07] other name under heaven given among men
[21:10] whereby we must be saved outside of the
[21:13] name of Jesus Christ is that right and
[21:16] the Bible tells us according to the book
[21:19] of Acts that all power in heaven and
[21:23] earth
[21:23] was given unto him so if all power in
[21:26] heaven and earth was given to Jesus
[21:29] Christ and who is he who is he you know
[21:33] a lot of people say nowadays who are you
[21:36] and I asked the question who are you so
[21:41] you and I must understand in order for
[21:44] God to work in you in the way that you
[21:49] want him to work in you you must first
[21:51] believe that he is God and I don't mean
[21:54] with your head I mean with your heart I
[21:58] was there 40 21 through 31 just just a
[22:02] wreath some things to you since do you
[22:06] not know that God is talking to Israel
[22:08] do you not do you not hear has it not
[22:12] been told you from the beginning
[22:14] have you not understanding from the
[22:17] foundation of the earth see he talked if
[22:20] anybody should have known who he was it
[22:23] was supposed to be Israel Israel was a a
[22:26] powerful nation led by the pillar of
[22:29] fire the same God purified by night
[22:35] pillar cloud by day and it still was God
[22:38] he changed his father his chain he was
[22:41] God in more faith at night he was a fire
[22:44] pillar fire in the daytime he and more
[22:47] fair he changed his mass and he was a
[22:49] pillar cloud but it was the same God
[22:53] right and if anybody should have known
[22:57] who God was it should be Israel even the
[23:02] Prophet cried out the LORD thy God
[23:05] oh here ye or Israel the Lord thy God is
[23:08] one so where does the Gentiles go off at
[23:12] thinking God is three when he's one hmm
[23:16] he would not accept Israel worshiping
[23:20] three gods because he had already
[23:23] declared unto them that he was one so
[23:25] the revelation of who how Christ and God
[23:28] is one the Bible declares He is God in
[23:33] Christ and one and it's a revelation as
[23:36] it is
[23:37] well God builds his church on the
[23:41] revelation of who he is
[23:44] Oh somebody help me now
[23:47] it is he who sits upon the circle of the
[23:50] earth and its inhabitants are like
[23:53] grasshoppers who stretches out the
[23:56] heavens like a curtain and spreadeth
[23:58] them like a tent to dwell in who bring
[24:01] princes to nothing
[24:02] make the rulers of the earth as
[24:04] emptiness hello you remember the time I
[24:08] think was never kanessa a bouncer says
[24:11] that one of the two that actually
[24:12] thought he was God he boasted himself
[24:15] and God said for this you will have to
[24:17] eat the grass like an ox and he grew
[24:22] nails and everything else until his
[24:24] judgment was over guarantee you he's
[24:28] thought about himself had changed see
[24:32] God has share his glory with no one if
[24:36] you ever hear a man say I did this and I
[24:38] did that he didn't do nothing is that
[24:42] right because I think I believe Herod
[24:44] said you know I can take your life you
[24:49] say you can't do nothing you have no
[24:53] power except the power in which my
[24:56] father's given you see no man has power
[25:00] except the power and authority that God
[25:02] has given them he we die just like
[25:07] animals get we hire but what's the
[25:12] difference saw us the psalmist said
[25:15] what's the difference probably say
[25:17] listen you breed the dogs breed the cow
[25:19] breathe they can't breathe when it's
[25:21] time come he gives up his breath you
[25:23] give up yours there are only difference
[25:27] between us is that God has placed our
[25:29] soul only inside of us
[25:32] and we have to give an account the
[25:37] animals don't they do not have to give
[25:40] an account they never sinned but we who
[25:43] are human beings have to give an account
[25:45] to who God Himself is all
[25:50] what are you talking about who's gonna
[25:52] judge you at the end if there's a
[25:54] judgment the world is Jesus Christ in
[25:57] the beginning was the way of the Word
[25:59] was with God and the Word was God it is
[26:01] still God hey man whew he can't change
[26:06] so what I'm trying to tell you is that
[26:08] if we really believe that God and the
[26:11] word his words are the same then this is
[26:13] who you trust this is what you trust I
[26:17] said Who I was saying again this is who
[26:20] you trust because God and His Word is
[26:23] the same listen let me tell you
[26:25] something they're having their never be
[26:28] one person in the judgment that will be
[26:31] able to accuse god of being a failure
[26:35] god I kept your word and you didn't come
[26:38] through that man will be labeled as a
[26:40] liar because there is no way that God is
[26:44] not going to come through he proves
[26:49] himself Oh try me try me and see huh
[26:55] that's what the word says try me and see
[27:02] there's no one here I don't care you say
[27:06] Oh what do you mean brother bones let me
[27:08] tell you something if God don't hear you
[27:10] here he's gonna heal you then that's
[27:15] just where it is but God chooses the
[27:18] place of healing God chooses the place
[27:21] of deliverance oh let me move on
[27:25] scarcely are they playing this ghastly
[27:27] down scarcely has their stems taken root
[27:31] in earth when he blows on them he's
[27:33] talking about men and they wither and
[27:35] the tempest carries them off like a
[27:37] stubble to whom then will you compare me
[27:40] God says who you gonna get there me too
[27:43] is there anybody that you can compare
[27:45] God to every man is a failure born
[27:50] failures hallelujah then I should be
[27:55] like him says the Holy One lift up your
[27:58] eyes on high and see who created these
[28:01] he who bring out their hosts by
[28:04] calls them by name by the greatness of
[28:07] his might and because he is a strong in
[28:10] power not one is missing in other words
[28:14] God don't miss count we can look at all
[28:16] those stars and God knows every one of
[28:19] them by name don't even miss a beat
[28:23] created them all know where where they
[28:26] are understand their purpose for what
[28:29] where were they setting if we can see
[28:33] the greatness of God our troubles become
[28:36] small who I felt like shouting on that
[28:42] one if we can see the greatness of God
[28:47] our troubles will become small this is
[28:52] what he tried to tell Moses Moses you do
[28:56] you think Pharaoh's army is greater than
[28:59] me
[29:02] hello you scared of Pharaoh and I'm on
[29:06] your side and you're on my side and you
[29:08] are afraid of air on his army by you
[29:12] fearing I told you what to do
[29:16] trust me hold out that rod speak see
[29:24] what I'm saying you can't you can't
[29:26] handle a devil like you in question of
[29:28] your authority that you must speak with
[29:31] authority that was the way Jesus it who
[29:35] is this man that speaks with authority
[29:39] then they came to say hey where do you
[29:41] get your authority from what school of
[29:44] divinity did you go to jesus said I'll
[29:49] tell you what let me give you a question
[29:52] I love Jesus I love it I love it when he
[29:56] punched him real hard he says John the
[29:59] Baptist tell me was John the Baptist of

[30:39] up they got a sportsman's Lord we don't
[30:42] know and Jesus says well because you
[30:47] won't tell me neither will I tell you I
[30:51] love that he slap around for a minute he
[30:56] gave him a punch brother see you know
[30:59] you look at this thing and that's how
[31:00] these people do they try to trap you
[31:03] with their questions if you stand still
[31:06] just for the moment I'm I'm working on a
[31:10] message on silence silence is a powerful
[31:14] thing brother Balaam talks about he says
[31:17] you can't hear the Stars you can't hear
[31:19] the Sun you can't hear the earth rotate
[31:22] you've all these great things God say
[31:30] meditate why because when you meditate
[31:36] but in that meditation in that quietness
[31:39] amen that's when God comes sometimes
[31:43] early in the morning when everything is
[31:45] quiet that's when God comes hallelujah
[31:52] just in that secret place that's when
[31:56] God comes that's when God do things and
[31:59] listen the Bible said when those
[32:01] thunders were open when those seals were
[32:04] open the Bible said David I have an hour
[32:07] of silence and when Jericho marschallin
[32:12] when Israel must around Jericho seven
[32:15] times they had to be quiet silence had
[32:19] to be there often time with quiet or you
[32:23] said what do you mean I'm preaching my
[32:24] other message now because that's why the
[32:26] devil got Saul as
[32:28] is going home noise every day all day
[32:31] and it keeps us so confused but you need
[32:37] to take time in your day and get quiet
[32:39] that's some silence come in there so you
[32:42] can hear that steal small voice faith is
[32:50] that right that's what it I just said he
[32:52] said listen he said I saw the they are I
[32:55] saw um I saw that God and the Thunder I
[33:03] saw him in the lightning I saw him in
[33:05] the whirlwind and then I came to know
[33:08] him win in that small still voice see it
[33:15] only comes when you get quiet the Lord
[33:18] is in his temple then all the earth keep
[33:21] what silence see it is power in that yes
[33:27] we love the shout we love the dance we
[33:29] love to do all these things but there
[33:31] are times when you ought to be in a
[33:34] place of quiet so that you can hear God
[33:39] speak to you and tell you what is
[33:42] necessary for you what's next that is
[33:44] necessary for you to do let me move on
[33:47] this okay why you have to keep quiet
[33:56] sometimes because with this tongue we
[34:02] give God away we give his plans away
[34:06] over a long time in the past three days
[34:08] what he told you not the whole world and
[34:13] Satan to just assure you say that the
[34:17] devil said did you hear that
[34:19] get in guess what happens then your mama
[34:22] fits the best meal ever
[34:26] because you don't tell some hottie right
[34:29] you don't told her what you're doing
[34:31] it's best to get busy and forget let's
[34:35] move on what do you say old Jacob speak
[34:39] o Israel my way is
[34:41] from the Lord and my right right is
[34:45] disregarded by my god
[34:47] now listen then he says women now what
[34:49] are you talking about you're trying to
[34:51] say that God is not noticing you you're
[34:53] trying to tell me that God is ignoring
[34:56] you let me tell you something God cannot
[34:59] ignore you listen the Bible says that
[35:04] even in Hell where darkness is his light
[35:08] to God so he sees everything that goes
[35:11] on there and then God knows the hairs on
[35:17] your head
[35:18] how can you feel and think that you is
[35:21] insignificant God cares and when you
[35:27] realize he is God then you understand I
[35:31] was telling the church the other day I
[35:32] said one thing God has taught me he has
[35:35] taught me to love him and he's taught me
[35:38] in loving him I love myself so I don't
[35:43] tell me I'm a mistake don't tell me that
[35:46] everything I went through in life has
[35:48] been in vain
[35:49] it has not because even yet while I was
[35:52] a yet a sinner Christ died for me he
[35:55] died for you God loaded you he made you
[35:59] into what you were to be even then God
[36:02] had his hand in your life hmm he sure
[36:07] did he gives power to the faint and to
[36:13] him who has no might he increases
[36:14] strength huh so if you don't have any
[36:18] power you feel faint the Bible said he'd
[36:20] give power to the faint what you're
[36:23] gonna do about it
[36:31] even you shall faint and be weary and
[36:34] young men shall fall exhausted woo
[36:38] sounds like today
[36:42] sounds like today but they who wait for
[36:45] the Lord shall renew their strength they
[36:50] shall mount up with wings like eagles
[36:52] they shall run and not be weary they
[36:55] shall walk and not faint
[37:00] hallelujah and when brother Branham when
[37:03] he missed the call of God remember he
[37:05] was supposed to pray for that little boy
[37:07] that had on the little blue jeans you
[37:08] know and brother and I ran up to the
[37:13] house and already told the church and
[37:15] everything that the boy was gonna be
[37:16] healing he went up to the house and he
[37:19] pray for the boy knew the man's wife had
[37:22] never met her but he saw in a vision how
[37:24] do you know my wife where I saw and the
[37:28] thing is guess what he got in there pray
[37:31] for the boy and the boy almost died what
[37:34] did he do after that see that's what we
[37:37] fail to see is sometime it doesn't mean
[37:39] that God didn't give you the answer to
[37:40] your problem
[37:41] sometimes we rush it we get ahead of it
[37:44] and he says listen he said I had to what
[37:47] wait and while waiting he wasn't doing
[37:51] all his talking he wasn't reading the
[37:53] newspaper and neither was he only on the
[37:56] chat chat whatever they call chat snap
[38:02] snap chat but anyhow he was quiet he
[38:07] waited until he saw the vision come into
[38:12] view and then he knew to move here it is
[38:17] there it is he's an old brother forgive
[38:21] me I gotta hear to God but now I'm right
[38:23] here mom and I set down the hat sitting
[38:25] in the right place now it's time for me
[38:27] to pray sometimes when God tells you to
[38:35] do something you wait and let God direct
[38:37] you when you in - and God you don't have
[38:41] to worry about failure
[38:44] you're gonna be victorious you see
[38:52] sometimes we forget like like the
[38:54] disciples did when Jesus was on their
[38:56] boat
[38:57] Matthew 823 and I'm working with faith
[39:00] people and awareness we got to be aware
[39:03] who we serve if I'm in God and God is in
[39:07] me I'm sitting in heavenly places in who
[39:11] Christ Jesus if I'm in God and God is in
[39:15] me see the Bible didn't say power and
[39:19] miracles gonna happen to them
[39:20] amen who who have faith on God says
[39:24] faith in God you know what faith in God
[39:26] is means you are in him having faith not
[39:31] about him not around him but in him you
[39:34] understand me
[39:35] for example if this was faith I'm in him
[39:44] not in the world I'm in him he and me
[39:49] that right and when you in God there is
[39:54] no darkness there is no failure there is
[39:57] no question brother BAM Brooks are you
[40:04] in this room no I'm in the living room
[40:09] you're in this room yeah no no I'm in
[40:12] the bathroom see I am aware that I am in
[40:17] this room why cuz I walked into it I'm
[40:21] standing in it that's how it is with God
[40:26] when you ain't got you know you're in
[40:29] God you don't have the question am I
[40:32] ain't got you know do you question this
[40:34] room are you questioning sitting in that
[40:36] seat you're in the seat on it however
[40:41] you want to say it but you are aware and
[40:43] that's the problem we lose our awareness
[40:47] of God and man you and God we forget
[40:53] even the Prophet God preached the
[40:55] message the unrecognisable presence of
[40:58] we fell we fail to see it is this okay
[41:06] but the Bible says in when he got into
[41:08] the boat his disciples followed him and
[41:11] behold there arose a great storm on the
[41:13] sea so that the boat was being swamped
[41:16] by the waves but he was asleep and they
[41:21] went and woke him saying save us Lord we
[41:24] are perishing and he said unto them why
[41:28] are you afraid
[41:29] o ye a little faith now I want you to
[41:32] think about my wife warning go meet with
[41:39] me a cruise but think about this boat
[41:44] I've seen those kind of boats they're
[41:47] not huge like a ship a line or something
[41:49] I mean that they can be rocked but I've
[41:52] seen it the kind of fishing boats you
[41:54] know in our minds we take their big
[41:56] boats now they're not about yay wide one
[42:01] two three
[42:01] perhaps and maybe a little longer
[42:05] not much but they were all to see be
[42:11] honest do you understand how big the
[42:14] waves can get on a sea so it wasn't
[42:17] something loose all the waves like that
[42:19] like you could just float on and OSA
[42:21] these were waves that were threatening
[42:24] threatening for what death do you think
[42:27] Jesus was surprised the probably God
[42:30] says no no no no no God put them in that
[42:33] situation Jesus knew it was going to
[42:37] happen I'm a recently just a woman
[42:42] visiting and what happened they got
[42:44] hysterical right you know why are you
[42:50] afraid he's saying now his Jesus not
[42:53] afraid he ain't screaming no he's not
[42:56] afraid he is aware of the presence of
[43:02] the unseen God he understands his
[43:09] relationship
[43:12] that's what I try to tell people if God
[43:13] is dropped in your heart you gonna make
[43:15] a rapture no death can come get you
[43:17] death can't get you if you really
[43:20] believe you are raptured material and
[43:23] God has ordained you as one of them to
[43:25] take a rapture no death can take you hmm
[43:33] why are you afraid oh yeah literally
[43:35] then he rose him to Butte the wind and
[43:37] the sea it was a great white calm it's a
[43:43] power in that calm that's power in that
[43:45] calm and the men marveling saying what
[43:48] sort of man is this that even when in
[43:52] the sea obey Him better than they see it
[43:55] was still carnal no man can stop the sea
[44:00] no man can stop the waves of the sea
[44:03] that wasn't a man did it was a man when
[44:07] he cried at Lazarus tomb but when he put
[44:10] his foot on the hem of the bone said
[44:12] peace be still that was no longer a man
[44:15] that was God that's how it is with your
[44:19] prayer you might be just a simple man or
[44:23] simple woman but when you are anointed
[44:26] and you say in the name of Jesus Christ
[44:29] it transfers from a man to a god not
[44:33] just you but that's Jesus Christ praying
[44:35] through you that's why he said all
[44:38] things are possible to them that really
[44:41] believed your brother who said he said
[44:48] the disciples were rejoicing on what
[44:50] they had seen him do see knowing what he
[44:53] was with them the kind of like the man
[44:56] mind of a man a man a mind of a man is
[45:00] always talking about and rejoicing what
[45:03] God has done and they're saying what he
[45:06] will do and ignoring what he's doing he
[45:10] wasn't asleep exactly we'll get to that
[45:13] in a few minutes
[45:14] they'll believe what he want he has done
[45:17] and shout about it they talk about what
[45:19] he has done he's going to do glorify God
[45:22] but what he's doing right now they
[45:25] ignore it the judge that's just the
[45:29] nature of man that's just the way he
[45:31] does it
[45:32] and then while they were enjoying the
[45:35] blessings of their fellowship one with
[45:38] another and all counting it all up what
[45:40] they had seen done all of a sudden there
[45:44] arose trouble y'all know it's the true
[45:48] y'all knows the truth every time you
[45:51] think you got it oh praise God God is so
[45:54] good hey let's testify and all of a
[45:59] sudden a storm come you don't even know
[46:03] where it came from
[46:04] it's just up from nowhere blowing you
[46:08] everywhere and if you're not careful
[46:12] your little senses you'll feel these are
[46:17] sisters that you so love this honest
[46:20] what happened fear comes with every test
[46:26] and trial fear comes but the Bible said
[46:30] perfect love casts out fear you can't
[46:35] guess out fear like go home devil you've
[46:37] got to speak with authority say to this
[46:43] mountain don't ask the mountain say it
[46:46] move with authority and hold your ground
[46:51] rock faith regulated faith is not solved
[46:56] is not dodi brother man said is like a
[47:00] man with hair on his chest he's a real
[47:02] man it's the truth it's a revelation
[47:11] folks I'm trying to tell you if you
[47:14] can't believe God can fix your problems
[47:17] here what wouldn't you die in rot you
[47:20] think how can God get you up there ain't
[47:24] no praying in the grave your prayer must
[47:26] follow you the anointing of God must
[47:29] follow you there this is testing ground
[47:35] visit the place where you are tried
[47:41] like I was telling the people I said you
[47:43] know God healed me of cancer but he
[47:46] might take somebody else a different
[47:47] route whichever way he takes you you
[47:52] ought to be certain of God and if you
[47:55] are certain of God nothing can break
[47:57] that don't let the devil put fear in
[48:01] your head or in your mind or in your
[48:03] heart and God told you he is going to
[48:06] fix it
[48:07] he knows the path he leads you our
[48:12] ultimate goal is translation not here
[48:15] not just repairs here our ultimate goal
[48:19] is to have the character of Jesus Christ
[48:22] only is high the very image and likeness
[48:24] of God that's what we want no matter how
[48:28] great the storm is may our faith prevail
[48:33] it must he's working on you hmm thank
[48:44] God for a prophet who gave us a balance
[48:47] of the word all we need to know is see
[48:51] the thing is when Satan comes in like a
[48:53] flood the Bible said the Spirit of the
[48:55] Lord lifts up a standard don't you think
[48:59] is that right the Bible said when the
[49:02] sons of God appeared before God in
[49:04] heaven
[49:04] the devil came so if the devil gonna go
[49:07] to heaven to stand before God do you
[49:10] think he's not coming to church the
[49:14] devil coming to church and he's gonna
[49:18] not anybody peeing in church you know
[49:25] expect people that hey y'all expect this
[49:28] ain't all these angels in him that will
[49:33] be hallelujah and we must understand
[49:40] it's gonna take faith rockface Revelator
[49:44] faith to get out of here Oh Prince God I
[49:49] got the Holy Ghost let me tell y'all son
[49:51] those three Hebrew
[49:52] were not even prophets but they knew who
[49:58] God was
[49:59] they understood who God was they
[50:03] understood that no matter how beautiful
[50:06] and shiny amen all of those idols in in
[50:09] in in in Babylon walk they knew there
[50:12] was only one God and they were
[50:15] determined cuz he see at the end of the
[50:17] day Allah you won't stand before him
[50:21] Allah gonna be begging for mercy himself
[50:25] Buddha in hand do all of them there's
[50:28] only one God
[50:29] there's only one name and that name is
[50:32] Jesus Christ see so if I'm gonna feel
[50:37] about so don't even fear what man can do
[50:39] to you man can destroy the body but God
[50:43] can destroy the soul will somebody help
[50:46] me so you and I must have total faith in
[50:49] who we are what surrounding us we're in
[50:52] this building but but that's not exactly
[50:55] where we all are some of us are in
[50:58] Christ maybe all of us are in Christ but
[51:01] you need to be able to know you should
[51:03] be able to know that you are in Christ
[51:06] and if you are in Christ you are hidden
[51:12] the delicate do we know how I'm gonna
[51:15] stay right under the blood and the devil
[51:18] can do me no harm
[51:19] hmm I believe in victory no matter what
[51:24] I was telling the church I said let me
[51:25] tell you I'm just a fighter I might look
[51:29] like I mainly do not look like I am but
[51:32] when it comes to God and the things of
[51:34] God I'm a fighter I don't care how beat
[51:39] up I get how many times that gets
[51:41] smashed I knew at the end of the day I'm
[51:43] the victim I got the victory ha because
[51:46] he said he's given me the victory oh
[51:48] well I try off he said yes I will cause
[51:51] you to triumph
[51:53] God causes you he puts you in that
[51:56] position he moves you in that position
[51:59] oh come on somebody sometimes we think
[52:04] our prey
[52:06] god I gotta be anointed with this oil
[52:08] you don't have to be anointed with the
[52:10] oil there's no power in the oil the
[52:16] powers in the name of Jesus Christ you
[52:21] don't have to lay hands on the sick you
[52:23] don't have to be tattle a heads I don't
[52:26] care for person a man is in England if
[52:29] there was on the moon my prayer will
[52:32] reach the moon because my prayer don't
[52:35] need a rocket to get there or a bus or a
[52:37] plane when I pray we travel it's a
[52:44] dimensional thing folks it's a
[52:47] dimensional thing prayer penetrates
[52:52] anything and everything that science is
[52:54] just discovering huh let me tell you
[53:00] what prayers does you could be laying in
[53:03] a grey rotted and the voice of God will
[53:07] wake you do do you have you not heard
[53:12] [Laughter]
[53:16] God can take a man may boat and cause it
[53:23] to fluff the float under a catastrophic
[53:29] time of earthquakes in tidal waves we
[53:36] cannot imagine how great the tidal waves
[53:39] were in the days of Noah and God what
[53:43] happened
[53:44] gently sets him down on Mount Ararat
[53:47] then that's faith faith took him there
[53:51] yeah understand me faith took him their
[53:55] faith is unexplainable
[53:57] you can't mathematically work it it's on
[54:02] explainable and if you can explain it it
[54:06] is not faith all I can tell you is that
[54:11] you know that you got it when you got it
[54:17] hmm like brother sang
[54:20] the Samuel says we got Six Senses you
[54:28] know what I guarantee you when he was a
[54:29] boy and he said that I believe heaven
[54:31] had a bell to ring yes uh-huh
[54:37] we put this on the book so Samuel when
[54:40] you get here we're gonna let you know
[54:41] you had a right revelation even then and
[54:45] that sixth sense Amen is a rock it's a
[54:49] revelation
[54:50] it cannot be move is that right the
[54:52] Bible said the man that builds his house
[54:54] upon this rock though the stones beat
[54:58] vehemently they came the flowers came
[55:02] look at all the fuss now Washington lens
[55:06] tripping it of houses and everything
[55:08] else but the Bible says no matter how
[55:11] great the flood is the house will stain
[55:20] to make it
[55:21] you've been ordained to make it is the
[55:25] wining is the crying is the whimpering
[55:28] is all that loving and complaining that
[55:31] God do not he just doesn't he won't
[55:33] don't want to hear it have faith in God
[55:35] have faith in God
[55:39] I told you that time when when I needed
[55:45] a job
[55:46] God told me what to wear and where to go
[55:50] say you choose where to go and I chose
[55:52] the places where I wanted to go he says
[55:54] you go home put on this put on this put
[55:56] on this little list I put everything on
[55:58] why I was listening I went there feel
[56:03] the application out and the man said I'm
[56:05] so sorry I don't have a place I don't
[56:08] have I didn't I didn't break down at all
[56:17] no how we do we get all broke up I
[56:21] thought it with God
[56:22] well what made you doubt because he
[56:26] didn't answer right then I went wrong
[56:30] and before I could get home the man had
[56:33] all
[56:33] called my wife is sitting back guess
[56:37] what this man said to me he said I had
[56:39] to hire you
[56:40] he said because of what you were wearing
[56:44] he said because of what you are wearing
[56:47] it showed me you had confidence in
[56:49] yourself that was the best job I ever
[56:54] had it was this man would let me off
[56:59] whatever I needed to preach and
[57:01] everything he was such an angel god
[57:04] bless him it's okay
[57:07] Oh Lord I'm almost done but i'ma see
[57:12] what would uh the prophet of God tells
[57:15] us is that um I don't either
[57:20] sorry I knew it was coming but you know
[57:35] see he said that's the reason no way at
[57:40] all every of ever being safe see you
[57:45] have to accept what you cannot explain
[57:51] he got accepted you got to believe he
[57:56] that come to God must believe that he is
[57:58] there's no way to scientifically prove
[58:02] proving that but you must believe it
[58:05] anyhow if you could prove it then it
[58:09] will no more be an act of faith God has
[58:14] hid it God has so hid himself until you
[58:18] have to believe that he is without
[58:21] seeing him know that he's there anyhow
[58:26] whether you see it or not you believe it
[58:29] surely hallelujah
[58:32] Eli didn't see the Syrians or he didn't
[58:35] see the angel scuse me but when is this
[58:39] his services Lord it's more serious than
[58:41] us what are we gonna do God he lighted
[58:44] says Lord open he
[58:46] and that's what we need tonight we
[58:50] understand if the Bible said that they
[58:52] ain't your Lord and camp about those who
[58:54] fear y'all know that he does he does we
[58:59] need to open our eyes be be aware of our
[59:02] surroundings but you cannot if you let
[59:05] the enemy come with you with all kinds
[59:06] of noise throughout the day and you all
[59:08] confuse it you don't have that peace of
[59:11] mind
[59:13] remember when Satan can't confuse you
[59:16] there is some evil work somewhere he's
[59:19] coming to get you with something that's
[59:21] not good but if you can keep your mind
[59:27] spit on him the Bible said here grant
[59:29] you perfect peace ooh perfect piece but
[59:36] it's thunder than lightning that's all
[59:38] right
[59:38] I mean I'm under I'm in the shelter of
[59:41] his arms hallelujah how many how many I
[59:48] remember the time a few years ago I
[59:51] think there was in Oklahoma when that
[59:54] tornado was coming just peal across the
[59:57] woman I don't know who she was
[59:58] but one of these old days I know I'll
[1:00:00] see her you could see the tornado about
[1:00:04] ready to swallow her house and she's
[1:00:06] standing on the porch rebuking it
[1:00:08] speaking in tongues and everything else
[1:00:10] and the tornado jumped her house and
[1:00:14] wiped out everything else look it up
[1:00:17] look it up woman speaking in tongues of
[1:00:21] rebuked tornado it's in the YouTube you
[1:00:25] can see it a Pentecostal whoever she is
[1:00:28] all right no she was a real believer she
[1:00:32] knew that was in what was in that stall
[1:00:34] that stall had demons and great is he
[1:00:37] that it was in heart that he then said
[1:00:39] she was not afraid matter of fact she
[1:00:41] had her son filming it look it up you
[1:00:49] know we've been running today
[1:00:58] the target oh we uh I promised God I
[1:01:09] never leave my house again yes where you
[1:01:16] scared that yes I was scared that's why
[1:01:17] I was in very quick trying to find a
[1:01:21] place safety oh god help Jesus oh lord
[1:01:28] help us God is so real to us in thee let
[1:01:32] me hurry up I've spent too much time now
[1:01:39] faith God God has hit us on do you have
[1:01:42] to believe what that he is without
[1:01:43] seeing him know that he's there anyhow
[1:01:47] and I think that marvelous and that
[1:01:49] gives illiterate people like me a chance
[1:01:52] everybody to believe it because we're
[1:01:54] here we hear it and faith comes by
[1:01:57] hearing and hearing of the Word of God
[1:01:58] then we accept that and believe that and
[1:02:03] from the basis of our faith in that we
[1:02:05] are saved healed and whatever more we
[1:02:08] draw from God comes from an unseen
[1:02:11] resource hmm so you and I must
[1:02:15] understand I believe Noah built enough
[1:02:20] have you not heard huh I believe Enoch
[1:02:25] was translated I believe that Jesus
[1:02:31] Christ died and rose again for me I
[1:02:35] believe Lazarus was in the grave for
[1:02:38] days did you see it no can you explain
[1:02:42] it no did is it did he live yes why I
[1:02:46] believe my faith has declared it and
[1:02:50] nothing can deteriorate it nothing can
[1:02:52] change it because I know the Word of God
[1:02:55] stands this ok see Christians the whole
[1:03:03] armor of Christianity is faith
[1:03:05] everything that we have is unseen the
[1:03:09] only thing that's real is unseen onyx
[1:03:12] the things that you can be can be
[1:03:15] explained and not real they're
[1:03:17] superficial and they'll die but the
[1:03:21] things that cannot be explained or
[1:03:23] immoral the whole room look at the armor
[1:03:27] Christianity love what part of you is
[1:03:29] love joy peace
[1:03:31] excuse me faith launch of the meekness
[1:03:34] patient none of those things you can see
[1:03:36] them they're unseen but yet we believe
[1:03:40] them love never dies faith is the
[1:03:44] victory and we believe things that we
[1:03:47] don't see oh I got to see it to believe
[1:03:51] it know many people see it and still
[1:03:53] don't believe it huh you ought to see
[1:03:57] the people the doubt that comes in
[1:03:58] people when I said you know I've seen
[1:04:00] two people raised from their you can
[1:04:02] feel it among believers they don't
[1:04:04] believe it cuz they didn't see it you
[1:04:06] know and the second thing they want to
[1:04:08] say where there's I was there doctors to
[1:04:09] say it was there no the person that was
[1:04:13] there said he was dead hmm you mean to
[1:04:19] tell me you wouldn't take the words of
[1:04:23] Lazarus hallelujah but Jesus looked at
[1:04:31] them and said with man this is
[1:04:34] impossible but with God all things are
[1:04:37] possible see
[1:04:41] no man can do it but when your faith is
[1:04:43] solid like a rock hallelujah hey ain't
[1:04:47] let nothing get by me and because you've
[1:04:50] gone through test doesn't mean that you
[1:04:52] gotta jump for joy sometimes it's
[1:04:56] difficult but at the same time you got
[1:05:00] something that's holding you not you
[1:05:03] holding it is holding you cannot be
[1:05:07] penetrated by doubt I don't know how
[1:05:10] he's gonna do it but I know he will ha
[1:05:13] he promised and I'm standing on the
[1:05:17] promises of God like I was telling the
[1:05:21] church of the day I said I don't care
[1:05:23] what my children look like
[1:05:25] what they do God made a promise
[1:05:29] I remember muscles the chapel's how she
[1:05:38] used to cry out before God when it when
[1:05:41] it came to her daughter and no doubt
[1:05:44] perhaps names looked pretty grim at
[1:05:46] times but that prayer that mothers cry
[1:05:50] and now she's married and and they're
[1:05:54] having a great time I would think you
[1:05:57] know she you know my point is she's in
[1:05:59] God and prayers was answered see that
[1:06:04] which may have looked impossible became
[1:06:06] possible because a mother wouldn't give
[1:06:09] up let me tell you something no matter
[1:06:13] who your loved ones are don't you quit
[1:06:16] you understand me
[1:06:18] I don't care what it looks like it has
[1:06:20] nothing to do with what it looks like if
[1:06:24] the devil can get you to quit you the
[1:06:26] blood you you the high priest probably
[1:06:31] God said the bride is the blood of Jesus
[1:06:33] Christ by the spirit and you're the one
[1:06:36] that's crying out for them
[1:06:37] if you quit where would they go what
[1:06:40] what other chance where they have if you
[1:06:43] quit on them oh they're just getting so
[1:06:45] bad I king ticket no think about it if
[1:06:48] Jesus what it did that to us on the
[1:06:50] cross
[1:06:51] seeing how bad we were going to get but
[1:06:54] the vows that he endured the suffering
[1:06:56] he despised the shame my father
[1:07:01] it was mr. faith himself he told him say
[1:07:06] listen I want you to know no grave can
[1:07:10] hold my body down in three days I'm
[1:07:17] getting back up
[1:07:18] what was he basing his rise on the
[1:07:21] scriptures according to the Word of God
[1:07:23] says I will not leave his soul in Hell
[1:07:26] neither will I let his flesh see
[1:07:28] corruption he stood there and God has to
[1:07:33] honor his word I'm almost done people
[1:07:38] excuse me everybody want to know where
[1:07:43] did you get your authority let me tell
[1:07:49] you something just with the attitude
[1:07:51] toward everything mother said is right
[1:07:54] he said the right mental attitude toward
[1:07:57] the Word of God will bring it to pass if
[1:08:00] you doubt it it ain't happening
[1:08:02] you gotta you got to process it now how
[1:08:05] God is gonna do it
[1:08:09] I'll tell you what I think about the ark
[1:08:12] that Noah built I still marvel I still
[1:08:17] marvel I you know what I don't believe I
[1:08:22] just don't believe that that boat ever
[1:08:23] flipped you know know you're on or
[1:08:29] didn't find himself floating upside down
[1:08:31] but there was enough power in that storm
[1:08:34] in that flood that's not only should've
[1:08:37] flipped him but should have sankt him
[1:08:39] but you know God designed it see there
[1:08:45] so don't say when God design your
[1:08:47] troubles you gonna come out as a victim
[1:08:51] yeah you can't lose he's the one that
[1:08:55] designed it and I love it because you
[1:08:57] know we used to play cowboys and Indians
[1:08:59] and I have my Indians and my Cowboys and
[1:09:01] their fight for a while and then shoot
[1:09:02] each other for a while but I knew who
[1:09:04] was gonna win I determine who was gonna
[1:09:09] win it they had no life of their own
[1:09:12] and that's how God has done it man I'm
[1:09:18] almost done my last quote hmm
[1:09:20] see brother BAM said we have record that
[1:09:24] when we tell a person that that's God he
[1:09:27] talking about this dr. Tom's a prophet
[1:09:29] when the person you got malignancy or
[1:09:32] something is going to kill him and also
[1:09:34] is ready to burst tuberculosis it it
[1:09:37] depends on what the attitude they take
[1:09:39] if they get all tore up said they die
[1:09:42] right away but if they take the attitude
[1:09:45] will well dying is a part of living it's
[1:09:48] all alright when I die say
[1:09:52] you know he said it almost retards that
[1:09:56] case I just thought if that mental
[1:10:00] attitude taking like that what will it
[1:10:04] do when the Holy Spirit strikes that in
[1:10:06] a man w finish with that right attitude
[1:10:14] when God comes down and strike that in a
[1:10:17] man the devil is finished hmm that's
[1:10:24] what he said you know he says not mind
[1:10:27] over matter but the right attitude will
[1:10:31] bring God on the scene right though he
[1:10:35] slayed me I trust him whether he
[1:10:39] delivered me or not I know he's able see
[1:10:43] those kind of attitude will bring God on
[1:10:46] the scene see cuz he knows you trust him
[1:11:01] and so you understand when your house is
[1:11:05] built upon that rock of who God is and
[1:11:08] you you continually remind yourself be
[1:11:13] in him let him be in you let you you and
[1:11:17] you be in him be aware of your
[1:11:19] surroundings
[1:11:21] you're not just somewhere floating in
[1:11:23] space the Bible said we now sit in
[1:11:27] heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:11:30] that's there you're gonna need it
[1:11:36] testing time it's just begun some of us
[1:11:40] might think oh my goodness is just so
