[0:20] uh the word Shalom uh brother bandam

[0:25] peace to the bride but I'm just going to
[0:27] take it from a different angle um by the
[0:30] grace of God and um we like to give a
[0:35] theme to it the battle is the Lords
[0:38] if we could turn by the grace of God to
[0:42] uh second Thessalonians please
[0:45] second Thessalonians
[0:58] second Thessalonians we going to be
[1:00] reading uh from the second chapter
[1:05] and we'll begin reading at the seventh
[1:07] verse
[1:11] for the mystery of iniquity doth already
[1:14] work
[1:16] only he who now leth will let until he
[1:20] be taken out of the way and then shall
[1:24] thy Wicked be revealed whom the Lord
[1:27] shall consume with the spirit of his
[1:30] mouth and shall destroy with the
[1:32] brightness of his coming
[1:35] even him whose coming is after the
[1:38] working of Satan with all power and
[1:41] signs and Lon wonders with all deceiving
[1:45] thisness of righteousness in them that
[1:48] perish because they believe or receive
[1:52] not the love of the truth that they
[1:54] might be saved and for this cause God
[1:58] shall send them strong Del illusion that
[2:01] they should believe a lie that they all
[2:03] might be damned who believe not the
[2:05] truth but have pleasure in un
[2:07] righteousness but we are bound to give
[2:10] thanks always to God for you Brethren
[2:13] beloved of the Lord because God ha from
[2:16] the beginning chosen you to Salvation
[2:19] through sanctification of the spirit and
[2:21] belief of the truth where unto he called
[2:24] you by Our Gospel to the obtaining of
[2:27] the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:30] therefore Brethren stand stand fast and
[2:34] hold the tradition which ye have been
[2:35] taught whether by word or our epistle
[2:40] now our Lord Jesus Christ himself and
[2:42] God even Our Father which have loved us
[2:45] and have given us everlasting
[2:47] consolation and Good Hope through Grace
[2:50] Comfort your hearts and establish you in
[2:54] every good work
[2:58] is that all right
[3:00] amen first Peter please
[3:13] first Peter the 5th chapter
[3:19] we'll begin reading at the
[3:28] six verse
[3:30] humble yourselves therefore under the
[3:32] mighty hand of God
[3:35] that ye may that he may exalt you in due
[3:39] time casting all your care upon him for
[3:44] he carth for you be sober be vigilant
[3:49] because your adversary the devil as a
[3:52] roar lion walth about seeking whom he
[3:54] may devour
[3:56] whom resist steadfast in the faith
[3:59] knowing that the same Affliction are
[4:01] accomplished in your brethren that are
[4:04] in the world
[4:06] but the God of all Grace
[4:10] who have called us unto eternal glory by
[4:13] Christ Jesus
[4:15] after that ye have suffered a while
[4:19] make you perfect amen establish
[4:23] strengthen settle you to him be glory
[4:27] and Dominion forever and ever amen you
[4:32] may be seated
[4:37] we really appreciate the Lord and all
[4:40] that he does for us we realize that
[4:45] without him we are nothing
[4:51] I am grateful because I realize tonight
[4:55] that if any of us from the pull pit to
[4:58] the back of the door
[5:00] make a Rapture it'll be by the grace of
[5:03] God
[5:05] because he loved us before the
[5:08] foundation of the world
[5:12] when I was studying I was thinking about
[5:15] all that God had done I I just love the
[5:18] message that God brought on Sunday
[5:20] because of his blood I have been just
[5:23] bathing in those thoughts seeing all of
[5:27] the promises and the Freedom that God
[5:30] has given to his bride
[5:33] we who are failures to begin with should
[5:38] be able to really appreciate God for all
[5:41] that he has done for us words cannot
[5:44] express our gratitude tonight knowing
[5:48] how faulty we can all be sometime
[5:51] and knowing that he loved us so much
[5:55] that he gave his life for us now if you
[5:58] turn with me to second Thessalonians
[6:00] again please the third chapter I love
[6:03] the way God slips in words of
[6:05] encouragement in the word and how he
[6:08] tries to build our confidence in his
[6:10] word because remember now the great fall
[6:14] came by way of Eve losing confidence in
[6:19] God's word and once you lose confidence
[6:22] in God's word you must realize that
[6:24] Satan can come alone and dup you he is
[6:27] more than able to convince you of his
[6:30] thoughts
[6:31] and to let you know amen that his
[6:35] thoughts are so-called right but whoever
[6:38] whatever you exalt above the word of God
[6:41] it becomes God to you
[6:44] and you then becomes an idol worshipper
[6:47] but listen to uh 2 Thessalonians 3
[6:51] beginning at the third verse it said but
[6:53] the Lord is faithful who shall establish
[6:57] you now we just read said that uh just a
[7:00] moment ago how we must go through our
[7:03] trials where God is going to take us
[7:06] through them to establish us and often
[7:10] time we say God I I want to make a
[7:12] Rapture but we must realize you got to
[7:14] suffer the get there
[7:18] God must send us through the fire
[7:21] but in all of this he still wants us to
[7:23] be at peace
[7:25] because when you trust God it brings a
[7:28] peace amen and the Bible said if we just
[7:31] only keep our minds stayed on him not at
[7:35] the storm not at the waves not at the
[7:38] anything that's occurring in your life
[7:39] means nothing right now am your main
[7:42] focus should be on a Rapture amen being
[7:46] transformed translated amen uh into the
[7:51] image of Christ is what our focus should
[7:53] be on amen God said so is that right
[7:57] seek ye first the kingdom of God or
[7:59] heaven and all of these other things
[8:00] will be added to us let us not allow
[8:04] Satan to uh how can I say it how let us
[8:09] not allow Satan to bring the word down
[8:13] to earth
[8:15] the word is above all
[8:19] it is God
[8:21] second Thessalonians second
[8:23] Thessalonians the 3r chapter the third
[8:26] verse says but the Lord is faithful who
[8:29] shall establish you and keep you from
[8:34] evil
[8:36] and we have confidence in the Lord
[8:38] touching you that ye both do and will do
[8:42] the things which we command you and the
[8:46] Lord direct your hearts into the love of
[8:50] God and into the patient waiting for
[8:55] Christen now Paul says I have confidence
[8:58] I believe
[8:59] and I have confidence that you're going
[9:02] to do what you're supposed to do now we
[9:06] realize amen that in all that we got we
[9:09] have to do God is the one that is
[9:11] directing us they that are led by the
[9:16] spirit of God they are they are the sons
[9:19] of God I'm going go through a lot of
[9:22] scriptures tonight that's why I'm taking
[9:23] my time here amen let us turn right now
[9:26] to Ephesians 6 please
[9:31] you love the Lord we're going to read
[9:33] Ephesians the 6th chapter uh at the
[9:36] sixth chapter there
[9:40] and we're going to start at the 10th
[9:42] verse we have heard this scripture many
[9:44] times but by the grace of God we're we
[9:46] we're coming to a point where we can
[9:48] where you can really uh understand
[9:50] exactly where I'm coming from because
[9:52] let me say like this
[9:55] there is only two forces in the world
[9:59] one is of God and one is of Satan you
[10:03] and I don't have nothing
[10:05] and whatever power we have it be of
[10:08] Satan or of God one is of Life the other
[10:13] one is of death
[10:16] and the Bible say choose you this day
[10:17] who you going to serve
[10:20] so we realize by the grace of God
[10:21] there's only really two rulers
[10:24] I don't care how great uh these uh
[10:27] dictators are
[10:29] presidents or popes I don't care how
[10:32] great they think they are they are just
[10:35] absolutely uh subject to a higher power
[10:40] amen something that is greater than they
[10:43] and they fail to realize
[10:46] amen that their ruler one day will be
[10:49] brought down to the pits of Hell
[10:52] amen so we realize that they're being
[10:54] ruled is that right we we'll see that in
[10:56] just a moment Ephesians uh 6
[10:59] beginning at the 10th verse it says
[11:01] finally my brethren be strong in the
[11:05] Lord and in the power of your might
[11:09] in the power of His might
[11:13] right there is no other way that we're
[11:15] going to be strong and powerful except
[11:17] It Be by way of the Holy Ghost
[11:20] put on the whole arm of God that you may
[11:24] be able to stand against the Ws of the
[11:27] devil amen for we Ral not against
[11:30] against flesh and blood but but against
[11:33] principalities
[11:35] against Powers against the rulers of
[11:38] Darkness
[11:40] of this world against spiritual
[11:44] wickedness in high places and I really
[11:47] believe that a lot of Christians forget
[11:49] that on a daily basis Lord that our
[11:52] adversary is the Unseen amen it is not
[11:56] that which you see it is unseen
[11:59] spiritual wickedness in high places and
[12:03] understand when Satan comes after you in
[12:05] any way there's a devil behind the mask
[12:11] you hear what I'm saying so you address
[12:13] the devil not the maskk
[12:17] right because you got to realize that
[12:19] this whole battle and don't get upset
[12:21] when people don't like you because you
[12:23] are a Christian they're not supposed to
[12:26] like you you must realize that this
[12:29] thing started in heaven and it came down
[12:33] to earth is that right now I want you to
[12:36] understand this whole thing is about who
[12:40] is God Amen or who God is however you
[12:44] want to put it this whole thing that
[12:47] we're now seeing is about Satan in his
[12:51] life
[12:53] because had not Eli
[12:55] the world as we know it would be
[12:57] different
[12:59] but Satan a man thought within himself
[13:03] that he would be God or like the most
[13:06] high and because of that we have now we
[13:11] we know there's only one true God but
[13:14] Satan have deceive the world that he is
[13:17] God and brother brandham said it like
[13:20] this it it is has it has been such a
[13:23] deception that in reality or
[13:26] figuratively he is the God of this evil
[13:30] world
[13:32] he is the ruler
[13:34] of Obama
[13:37] of Putin
[13:40] the pope
[13:41] he is their God if their God is not the
[13:44] Lord Jesus Christ
[13:47] their God is Satan
[13:51] now the Bible said put on the whole
[13:53] armor of God
[13:55] that means amen there's something to put
[13:57] on Amen
[13:59] you can't be a Christian and don't think
[14:01] that there's something to put on
[14:04] right wherefore take on you the whole
[14:06] arm of God that you may be able to
[14:09] withstand in the evil day and having
[14:12] done all to stand
[14:15] stand therefore amen having your loins
[14:19] gir about with truth and having on the
[14:22] breastplate of righteousness now you
[14:25] must understand he says listen you cover
[14:27] your weaknesses
[14:29] with truth amen right everybody in here
[14:33] got a weakness physically
[14:36] I don't care how many exercises you do I
[14:39] can come and punch you in your stomach
[14:41] and you GNA feel it because right in
[14:43] that area is a weakness
[14:46] God didn't put no bones there
[14:50] right so you must understand that every
[14:53] one of us have a weakness somewhere
[14:57] but it is fortified is is not a weakness
[15:00] if it's fortified by the word amen amen
[15:04] right and it says girled the LA with
[15:06] truth is that right you and I must
[15:09] realize amen that the Bible is
[15:11] instructing us on how to defeat the
[15:15] Devil amen having on the breastplate of
[15:18] righteousness
[15:20] why because that that that plate is
[15:22] covering your heart right that word is
[15:25] covering your heart so when a devil aim
[15:27] at your heart to hit your heart there's
[15:30] a breast plate there right amen so you
[15:33] and I must recognize
[15:35] by the grace of God that when God is
[15:38] doing something when he equips us as the
[15:41] scripture says and as brother VanDam
[15:43] said he could not have given us a
[15:45] greater weapon outside of his word amen
[15:48] amen now let me move on by the grace of
[15:51] God so you said well brother where are
[15:53] why are you saying all of these things I
[15:56] I want you to recognize that the battle
[15:59] has already been thought and the Victory
[16:02] is already won amen that's what my Bible
[16:05] says now we might be journeying through
[16:08] time but God has already won the battle
[16:13] the end the Bible tells us that the
[16:16] devil was defeated he was thrown into
[16:19] the Lake of Fire all of the Demons were
[16:22] the bride stood in a Holiness Hallelujah
[16:26] the foolish came up H come on somebody I
[16:28] mean it's already done not one word in
[16:32] his in this book can be altered
[16:36] we're worried about whether we're going
[16:38] to make a Rapture and God was so sweet
[16:41] and kind to us he sent the prophet of
[16:43] God beyond the curtain of time Amen to
[16:46] tell us I saw you there and he knew that
[16:49] the bride would pick that up now some
[16:52] people might wonder am I there I don't
[16:54] know whether you're there but I know I
[16:56] am
[16:59] I can't explain it but I know that when
[17:02] the prophet was about to go off the
[17:03] scene God had the prophet to preach a
[17:06] message Shalom that means peace don't
[17:10] you worry I'm going to take care of this
[17:13] thing is that right he sold it in tight
[17:16] with Ruth and Boaz come on when Ruth
[17:19] laid down at boaz's feet amen he got up
[17:22] he said my he said you are we've heard
[17:25] your testimonies we I know you are a
[17:27] virtuous woman but you you beyond
[17:29] anything I imagine he said you just go
[17:32] on and be at peace because I'm going to
[17:34] take care of the rest amen when you laid
[17:38] down before your Boaz Jesus Christ when
[17:41] you surrendered your life to him amen he
[17:44] made a promise to you by the word don't
[17:47] you worry about it I'll take care of the
[17:50] rest
[17:52] and and he's doing that the battle that
[17:55] we're speaking on tonight started in
[17:57] heaven since the beginning of time and
[17:59] we are now a at the at the world are
[18:03] under the devil's thought
[18:05] the world the world as now is under the
[18:08] devil's thoughts you have heard me say
[18:11] that before there was no other thought
[18:13] outside of God's thought Lucifer thought
[18:16] outside of God's thoughts and therefore
[18:18] he was the cause of this known chaos is
[18:23] that right he thought
[18:26] right he thought God dwelt in Beauty
[18:28] that's what brother Ram said he actually
[18:30] thought that God dwelt in Beauty so he
[18:33] exalted himself in worldly Beauty even
[18:36] in heaven he did it on Earth with Cain
[18:39] and God rejected it amen he has done it
[18:43] with the church world today and go and
[18:46] and they don't have no idea that these
[18:48] mega churches all of this stuff that
[18:51] they're doing that seem to be so
[18:52] beautiful to the natural eye is nonsense
[18:56] with God God is already rejected it if
[19:00] he doesn't reject that beauty he'll have
[19:02] to raise up Cain and apologize
[19:06] right amen because Cain worked much
[19:09] harder according to brother brandom Cain
[19:12] worked much harder amen than Abel amen
[19:17] so don't get discouraged when you see
[19:19] the denominations and organization
[19:21] making us look like we're lazy
[19:25] we got a lamb we we don't have to to
[19:28] Earth we don't have to taller Earth come
[19:30] on somebody we got a lamb
[19:36] right so you know they they they they
[19:39] have been predestinated to labor in such
[19:42] a way and yet they will be rejected
[19:47] hallelujah what we fail to see is that
[19:51] God has always been fighting the battles
[19:54] for us amen thank you Lord hey somebody
[19:57] amen huh because he is the judge of all
[20:01] things we can see it through Abraham all
[20:04] of the mistakes that Abraham made God
[20:07] said and declare it was not so amen
[20:12] come on somebody but the devil can say
[20:15] well I was there when he did it and God
[20:17] can say who going to lay in the charge
[20:19] the gods he
[20:21] see we got to realize amen we have been
[20:24] we are sitting in such a place Satan
[20:27] don't want you to see
[20:28] he don't want you to see the reality of
[20:31] your freedom because he knows if you if
[20:34] you see and can really see it your love
[20:37] for God will overwhelm you
[20:41] and you will never you will never think
[20:44] to do evil amen
[20:47] come on somebody but often times Satan
[20:50] gets us to believe that God does not
[20:52] love us in the way that he says he does
[20:58] is that okay
[21:00] now we realize by the grace of God As I
[21:02] said God
[21:06] this is a religious War
[21:09] battle of the churches is what I thought
[21:12] because that's what it was now Abel
[21:14] didn't know he was going to he was
[21:16] getting ready to uh be uh get into a
[21:19] battle but his brother was jealous of
[21:21] him now every denominational Christian
[21:25] that see you living the way you do will
[21:29] automatically become jealous
[21:32] and when they become jealous they become
[21:35] critical
[21:37] all of that is not necessary come on
[21:40] somebody
[21:41] why you know my wife and I was talking I
[21:44] said only the elect of God will ever
[21:46] assemble themselves in a place like this
[21:51] because Satan has their minds
[21:54] Christians a lot of so-called Christians
[21:57] believe you have to have a multitude of
[21:59] people you've got to have a big choir
[22:03] and you got to have all of this pump and
[22:06] what more amen because you're blessed
[22:11] see and what a delusion what an delusion
[22:14] that Satan has placed in their minds
[22:18] because it is exactly what what Satan
[22:21] did in the beginning thinking God was
[22:24] going to accept Beauty over his word
[22:29] God don't care nothing about no Beauty
[22:31] amen
[22:33] he's the maker and creator of all things
[22:38] and we look at this thing and I want you
[22:39] to know amen that God is fighting your
[22:42] battles right now
[22:46] right now I I was thinking about some
[22:49] prayers I said Lord don't you know God
[22:51] comes along and answer people's prayers
[22:54] it might take a few years down the road
[22:56] he answered them and they miss it they
[22:59] literally miss it
[23:07] you know you almost need a prayer
[23:09] Journal
[23:10] so that when God is that right brother B
[23:12] had a a dream and a prophecy journal A
[23:15] Prayer Journal is really something good
[23:17] to have so when God answer your prayer
[23:19] you can say here it is amen God answered
[23:22] this prayer I prayed it three years ago
[23:25] but he answered it
[23:27] see
[23:28] we look at this thing and you and I must
[23:30] understand that God fights for you
[23:33] Exodus 14:14 the Lord shall fight for
[23:35] you and ye shall hold your peace amen
[23:40] and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore
[23:42] CEST thou unto me speak unto the
[23:45] children of Israel that they go forward
[23:48] that's what I'm saying tonight hold your
[23:51] peace amen God is fighting for you amen
[23:55] but he's expecting you to go forward
[23:57] amen not to stand still amen go forward
[24:01] oh God this is happening I don't know
[24:02] what's going to happen to me go forward
[24:04] why are you crying oh my God is going
[24:09] before you the Bible said he goes before
[24:11] you and he's behind you
[24:15] Hallelujah come on somebody
[24:18] listen in the message ex uh uh the
[24:21] revelation of Jesus Christ listen what
[24:23] brother brandom said and I just pulled a
[24:24] little piece of the quote out he says
[24:26] Satan is in the carnal mind and Satan is
[24:30] exposed
[24:32] and Satan does not want himself exposed
[24:36] so what is he saying to have a carnal
[24:39] mind is to have Satan in your mind
[24:43] amen hello you don't want Satan in your
[24:46] mind come on the Bible says let this
[24:48] mind be in you that was also in Christ
[24:51] Jesus I don't want his mind I don't want
[24:54] Satan's mind I want God's mind
[25:01] Hallelujah
[25:03] turn with me to Daniel please
[25:09] Daniel 12
[25:16] all Heaven is backing you
[25:19] the whole thing is amen we realize
[25:22] tonight amen that Satan amen these
[25:24] battles that we having you gotta you got
[25:26] to amen this one if you're not having
[25:28] mind battles right now you're dead
[25:33] y'all know what I'm saying I mean the
[25:34] battles have been so great lately I mean
[25:37] it's almost and you know I got to find
[25:39] that that message I was listening to
[25:41] several messages today and brother Brana
[25:43] was talking about the storms and you
[25:46] know he began to say the Revival was
[25:47] over he was telling somebody the Revival
[25:49] is over he was saying the Revival is
[25:51] over he said because Lord he said I'm
[25:53] having a rough time keeping the
[25:55] victories
[25:58] it was he said it so fast I said what so
[26:02] my point is that was in 19
[26:05] might have been I don't know 60
[26:07] something when he said it because I was
[26:08] looking to 64 from 63 to 65 so if the
[26:13] prophet was having mind battles and a
[26:16] fight on his hand then what about you
[26:21] what about us
[26:23] and he said now the Revival is over
[26:26] that's what he was saying the re rival
[26:28] is over for the United States y'all know
[26:31] what I'm saying now that's in the 60s
[26:33] where is the anointing now
[26:37] what is it many of us amen we're
[26:39] fighting this thing and we're moving
[26:42] forward we're slugging along but somehow
[26:45] the battles in our minds is just pulling
[26:47] us
[26:49] you know am I the only one
[26:52] but you got to realize amen he said
[26:55] don't worry I got it all under control
[26:58] amen you see God didn't put us in this
[27:00] age to see us fail it is written we are
[27:04] conquerors more than conquerors
[27:10] Hallelujah now there is no other way God
[27:14] cont test you
[27:17] is through the battles in your mind let
[27:20] me read Daniel first starting at the
[27:22] first verse and at that time M shall
[27:26] Michael stand up the great Prince which
[27:28] standed for the children of the people
[27:30] and there shall be a time of trouble
[27:32] such as never was since there was a
[27:34] nation even to the same time and at that
[27:37] time thy people shall be delivered
[27:40] everyone that shall be found written in
[27:42] the book and many of them that sleep in
[27:45] the dust of the Earth shall awake some
[27:47] to everlasting life and some to shame
[27:50] and everlasting contemp and they that be
[27:53] wise shall shine as the brightness of
[27:55] the firmament and they that turn to to
[27:57] righteousness as the Stars forever and
[28:00] ever but thou oh Daniel shut up the
[28:04] words seal the book even to the time of
[28:07] the end many shall run to and fro and
[28:10] knowledge shall increase is that right
[28:13] brother ROM say what day was that that
[28:15] was this day this day now that the book
[28:19] has been open the mystery of iniquity is
[28:22] no longer a mystery am to the Bride of
[28:25] Jesus Amen and what is Iniquity to know
[28:29] to do good and do it is not so we look
[28:32] at these people and they say well they
[28:33] don't know the Bible call it iniquity
[28:39] he was talking about the Pentecostals he
[28:41] said the Pentecostal taught that the
[28:43] evidence of the Holy Ghost is speaking
[28:45] in tongues he said they know it's wrong
[28:47] but they went too far with it to turn
[28:49] back
[28:51] huh so does the trinitarians
[28:54] they know it's not according to the word
[28:57] but if they go back and repent they'll
[28:59] lose everything
[29:02] see it is Iniquity
[29:05] they have been engaged because they saw
[29:07] the truth and because they did not have
[29:10] a love for the truth God gave them over
[29:13] to a strong delusion to believe a lie
[29:16] but they once knew the truth brother bam
[29:19] said before you can ever go in error you
[29:21] must first deny the truth
[29:26] is that all right amen now here the word
[29:29] of God came in the B message the
[29:31] greatest battle ever fought he said when
[29:33] the great battle started on Earth there
[29:36] had to be a mutual meeting place there
[29:39] had to be a place selected for the
[29:40] battle to begin and for the battle to
[29:43] rage and that Battleground begins in the
[29:46] human mind there is where the battle
[29:49] started the human mind was chosen for
[29:51] the place of the battle where it was it
[29:54] it began and that is because that
[29:56] decision ision are made from the mind
[29:59] the head now they never started it from
[30:01] some mechanical Affair the grounds never
[30:04] started there therefore the
[30:07] organizations can never never do the
[30:10] work of God because the Battlegrounds
[30:12] where you've got to meet your enemy is
[30:15] in the mind
[30:17] Hallelujah you've got to make your
[30:20] choice it will meet you amen so you say
[30:23] well what do you mean brother Brooks I'm
[30:25] saying this this is why the Bible said
[30:27] eat the whole book because you need to
[30:31] know the thoughts of God right amen and
[30:35] the Bride of Jesus Christ have studied
[30:37] and she knows the word of God she knows
[30:41] good from evil Hello and every day yet
[30:46] though she knows it she's tested on
[30:49] Which choice to make
[30:52] Hallelujah is that right amen and if we
[30:55] choose God's way he all he will always
[30:58] be there to reward us remember brother
[31:02] brandham said he had that burden on his
[31:04] heart he said he had that burden on his
[31:06] heart and while he was up there in that
[31:08] storm that blizzard came he said he saw
[31:10] those after the storm he saw those uh
[31:12] deer amen that he that these different
[31:14] ones wanted to him to kill and he said
[31:17] oh uh he remembered his promise he said
[31:20] they came so close to him he said he
[31:21] could have fed him out of his hands he
[31:23] said but he remembered the promise he
[31:25] said I can't do it he count a shoe off
[31:26] the the Jer and everything and finally
[31:28] they did leave and then the word of the
[31:30] Lord came to him and says oh you
[31:32] remembered your promise
[31:36] see what are you saying when you make a
[31:38] promise better believe it God going to
[31:41] come test you
[31:43] he want to see whether you are faithful
[31:46] Amen in that way Hallelujah
[31:50] is that okay
[31:53] and if you remember your promise he said
[31:56] because you remember your promise he
[31:58] said I'll never leave you nor forsake
[32:01] you I will always be with you Amen in
[32:05] that same course of talking speaking he
[32:08] said may I walk with you can you imagine
[32:11] God asking you or me can he walk with us
[32:17] that was his final test
[32:20] huh come on and God will allow us to
[32:23] make promises so if you made promises
[32:25] and you haven't made the promise
[32:27] you got to repent
[32:30] ask God to forgive you give you strength
[32:33] Amen to do the promises over whatever
[32:36] they may be y'all hear what I'm saying I
[32:39] I'm just saying the Bible tell us it's
[32:40] better not to make a promise than to
[32:42] make one and break it that is to God is
[32:45] that right so I look at this thing and
[32:47] and and you and I must understand that
[32:49] if God
[32:51] is fighting for us now that's that's
[32:55] like the enemy is outside my house he's
[32:58] coming to fight me but my big brother
[32:59] goes out there to attack him now I'm not
[33:02] I'm not I'm not over here worried about
[33:05] who's going to win because I know my
[33:06] brother's going to win right he's got
[33:09] all that it takes to win now I'm not
[33:11] going to be outside I mean inside
[33:13] fretting oh my God what's going to
[33:16] happen to me
[33:19] I know what's going to happen to me I'm
[33:21] safe amen and I don't have to worry
[33:24] about my brother because amen he the
[33:26] battle is like 10 to one
[33:30] right so you know I'm looking at this
[33:32] and I'm looking through the window and
[33:34] what you think I would be saying now
[33:36] this might sound a little connal but I'm
[33:37] going to say hit with the right hit him
[33:39] with the left kick it with the right
[33:40] kick
[33:42] it become it becomes a joyous occasion
[33:46] see now none of us has been in war so
[33:48] maybe we don't understand but I don't
[33:51] think the Israelites felt really bad
[33:53] after they slaughtered Jericho
[33:58] oh we shouldn't have done that y'all
[33:59] that was so rough
[34:02] but my point is when the battle is is in
[34:05] Array and you're battling you don't feel
[34:08] sorry for the devil amen he's not going
[34:11] to feel sorry for you
[34:18] now I look at this thing and I'm saying
[34:19] now we ought to be resting in God Amen
[34:27] we ought to be rested in God because
[34:28] here the Bible said Michael stood up and
[34:31] brother R said Michael is Christ amen
[34:34] Christ stood up and what did he do he
[34:37] put the enemy in their place when the
[34:40] seals were open the word of God came and
[34:43] what did it do it put the the devil in
[34:46] his place why because God the mighty
[34:49] Angel put his foot one on the land one
[34:52] on the sea and basically saying it's
[34:54] mine I'm possessing it like Joshua
[34:57] amen and guess what I was among that all
[35:01] that he possessed I was among that
[35:06] we look at this and we say oh brother
[35:08] Brooks you know I don't you know and I'm
[35:10] saying this because I know if your
[35:12] battles have been as hard as mine has
[35:14] been you know you you think to yourself
[35:18] God if it if it wasn't for your grace I
[35:21] don't even know what I would think of
[35:22] myself
[35:26] maybe I'm the only one but I I I I think
[35:29] about that I says now Lord you know and
[35:31] the thing that gives me consolation is
[35:34] when Satan says okay you going to hell I
[35:36] said well I can see where you are
[35:41] the scripture got you locked in which
[35:44] one you want me to turn to
[35:47] right I mean you you look the Bible says
[35:49] according to Isaiah uh 14 let's let's
[35:51] turn there let's turn there he's already
[35:54] locked in and he trying to tell me where
[35:57] I'm going and in the mind of God he's
[35:59] already there
[36:03] huh amen oh Lucifer you you exalted
[36:06] yourself is that right and you you said
[36:09] I will Ascend above the most high uh
[36:11] Heights of the clouds I will be like the
[36:14] most high now you got to say well
[36:16] brother
[36:18] yes you got to realize the devil in His
[36:20] science has gone beyond any Cloud that
[36:23] we know of
[36:26] Amen hello
[36:27] His science have superseded
[36:32] he brings forth a cloud too when he goes
[36:34] up
[36:37] but it fades away hallelujah amen but
[36:40] when you realize amen that this Lucifer
[36:43] amen has now put this world into a a
[36:48] place where you got to either believe
[36:50] God or science
[36:52] amen hello you look at the Millions
[36:56] billions of how many people that believe
[36:58] in this Evolution stuff
[37:02] and you and I look like the ignorant
[37:04] ones when we say we believe the creation
[37:09] hello come on and and and you got to
[37:12] realize listen the Bible said when this
[37:15] devil when this when this Antichrist
[37:17] comes up he is going to be as
[37:20] Pentecostal as they ever were was you
[37:23] know what I'm saying lyes signs and
[37:25] wonders and all of that he'll have all
[37:27] that stuff going and people go oh my
[37:30] goodness it got to be right
[37:33] my daughter just went down to a church
[37:35] there Sunday
[37:37] she was telling me how a UPC right a UPC
[37:41] Church was celebrating and having a
[37:42] great time because of the Council of
[37:44] churches and taking up money
[37:49] yeah brother random said they would do
[37:51] it
[37:53] and they are they've done it and how
[37:56] many of of us know really how many have
[37:58] done it why do they hate this message so
[38:02] much CU they know the truth
[38:06] they know the truth even that Mr Baker
[38:11] Pastor Baker that died a year or two go
[38:12] down here at this church we visited some
[38:14] of some of some of us spoke evil about
[38:17] the message right and on his dying bed
[38:20] he says well I hope I preach the truth
[38:27] hey you can't die in hope you got to die
[38:30] in faith
[38:32] you know what he told the church there
[38:34] amen that we were branhamites yeah yeah
[38:38] and he said now brother brandom he said
[38:39] now that that brandom he preached a lot
[38:41] of good things but some of those things
[38:43] were wrong
[38:45] now my point is this amen he's got all
[38:48] those people believing what he said
[38:51] and God judged him
[38:54] shortly after that this man died
[38:59] see you can't just speak any kind of way
[39:01] about this message and especially if God
[39:03] got Eagles in there amen
[39:09] help us Lord we're blessed if I can get
[39:12] this congregation you know brother Brown
[39:14] said if we could get on one Accord he
[39:16] said everybody in here will be healed he
[39:18] said those who don't have the Holy Ghost
[39:20] will have it in less than 10 minutes I
[39:23] didn't write the quote down because I
[39:25] couldn't transfer but that's what he
[39:27] said so people we've got to be praying
[39:30] at home wherever it says Lord give us
[39:33] wisdom show us how to get on one Accord
[39:39] y'all hear what I'm saying God put us
[39:41] together not to be separate or some
[39:44] separate entity he put us together to be
[39:46] a body amen
[39:48] and I believe that's what we are but we
[39:51] must somehow all of us from the pull pit
[39:54] to the back of the door you and I must
[39:57] get more sincere and we must come to a
[40:00] place and stop thinking so selfishly and
[40:03] start thinking about the body
[40:06] we got to do it that's the only way this
[40:10] mess this work this church this little
[40:12] assembly is going to work he didn't put
[40:14] us together to fight or to be confused
[40:16] about nothing he put us together to show
[40:19] that this message can bring a body of
[40:21] people to one Accord
[40:24] you so what brother books if he could do
[40:25] 120 he can do us
[40:29] he can do us but we got to stop praying
[40:32] because that's the only way it can
[40:35] happen prayer talking to God being
[40:39] concerned Hallelujah
[40:42] about one another second Timothy 1:9
[40:45] please I I'm G have to move faster I'm
[40:47] sorry
[40:49] God
[40:52] someone said this to me the other day
[40:55] was it the name s that held him to the
[40:58] Cross
[41:00] or was it the purpose
[41:05] was it the nails or the purpose
[41:08] it was the purpose it was the purpose
[41:11] for which God came that kept him there
[41:15] he had a decision to make brother Bram
[41:18] said he all he had to do was move one
[41:19] finger he said the Angels were all in
[41:22] the bush trees and everywhere he said
[41:24] there would a total place up
[41:27] all he had to do but he had a purpose
[41:32] and he was to fulfill the father's
[41:34] purpose
[41:39] who second Timothy 1:9 who have saved us
[41:44] and called us with an holy calling not
[41:49] according to our works hello hello not
[41:53] according to your works
[41:56] but but according to his own works
[42:00] but according to his own purpose and
[42:04] Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus
[42:09] when before the world began amen if he
[42:13] didn't give it to you then he Ain giving
[42:14] it to you now
[42:17] I don't know how to say it but you got
[42:19] to have faith to believe that he gave it
[42:21] to you then
[42:24] brother brandom said Not only did he
[42:25] save us before the foundation of the
[42:27] world but he filled us and sealed us
[42:29] with the Holy Ghost before the
[42:31] foundation of the world and if that be
[42:34] true then the Holy Ghost is mine if I
[42:37] don't have it yet it's mine and the
[42:39] bride can't go nowhere until I get my
[42:42] ceiling
[42:43] see you got to think like that you got
[42:46] to allow God to do that and you know
[42:48] what a lot of time we want to hurry God
[42:50] but you got to understand God is not
[42:53] controlled by time

[44:57] 1:12 please
[44:59] giving thanks unto the Father which have
[45:01] made us meat to be to be partakers of
[45:05] the inheritance of the Saints in light
[45:07] who have delivered us oh he's going to
[45:10] do it no ha already delivered us from
[45:13] the power of darkness and have
[45:16] translated us into the kingdom of his
[45:18] dear son if we can take those messages
[45:22] dealing with light and darkness I think
[45:24] about that all the time how light forces
[45:27] the issue
[45:28] light takes over light takes charge
[45:33] it doesn't you'll never find light
[45:35] running from the darkness you find light
[45:38] overtaking the darkness
[45:44] in whom we have Redemption through his
[45:46] blood even the forgiveness of sin
[45:51] huh who is the image now redeemed like
[45:54] brother R said that means means to buy
[45:56] back I like that and if we can buy he
[45:59] can buy us back that means we were there
[46:02] here is Before Time right we were always
[46:06] his brother said is like to put
[46:08] something in a pawn shop it's twice mine
[46:12] right and that's how it is with God
[46:14] we're twice Gods
[46:18] oh people of God this is such a
[46:20] wonderful thing and you know I I I feel
[46:22] a little weary in my flesh but I tell
[46:24] you what my soul is saying hallelujah
[46:26] hallelujah hallelujah
[46:28] who is the image of the invisible God
[46:32] the first born of every creature for by
[46:36] him were all things created that are in
[46:39] heaven that are in Earth visible
[46:41] invisible whether be Thrones or Dominion
[46:43] principalities or Powers all things
[46:45] created by Him and for him and he is
[46:48] before all things by him all things
[46:51] consist
[46:53] now you got to realize if that be the
[46:55] case
[46:57] it I know these little brains of ours
[46:59] can't I'm not I'm saying Lord let the
[47:01] Inner Man grab this thing let that
[47:04] reborn again believer inside of you hold
[47:07] fast to this thing he has created all
[47:09] things now I look at this thing brother
[47:11] say God even knows every every time the
[47:14] flea bad his eye I didn't even know a
[47:17] flea had a eye
[47:19] but that's the truth
[47:22] have you ever seen a flee ey
[47:24] no
[47:26] but God knows how many times B his eyl
[47:30] oh that's powerful to me
[47:33] these scientist think they know
[47:35] something
[47:36] first John 3:8 I'm G move on he that
[47:39] committed sin is of the devil for the
[47:41] devil sined from the beginning for this
[47:43] purpose the Son of God was manifested
[47:46] huh for this purpose the Son of God was
[47:49] manifested that he might what destroy
[47:52] the works of the devil so what is the
[47:54] Son of God doing in your life destroying
[47:57] the works of the devil amen now you know
[48:01] when God does something for you amen
[48:09] come on somebody it's true it's true St
[48:13] John 18:37
[48:15] pilot therefore said unto him art thou a
[48:17] king then Jesus answered thou say that I
[48:21] a king
[48:23] thou sayth that I am a king to this end
[48:25] was I born and for this cause came I
[48:28] unto the world that I should bear
[48:31] witness of the truth amen oh
[48:34] everyone that is of the truth heareth my
[48:36] what voice so if you can hear his voice
[48:41] that means you are of the truth amen you
[48:44] can't be of the truth unless you're able
[48:47] to hear his voice oh my
[48:50] and if that's that be the truth what is
[48:52] going to there's no perishing for you no
[48:56] sir because you are the word amen what
[48:59] is truth the word is truth amen
[49:03] pilot had it right in his hand said what
[49:05] is truth then he go right out there and
[49:07] say I find no fault
[49:11] if he had only listen to himself he was
[49:14] bearing witness of the truth
[49:17] because truth has no fault
[49:25] listen how do you know when Satan's
[49:29] talking
[49:31] the Bible says John 8:44 ye are of your
[49:34] father the devil and the lust of your
[49:36] father ye will do he was a murderer from
[49:39] the beginning and Abode not in the truth
[49:43] because there is no truth in him when he
[49:47] speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own
[49:50] for he is a liar and the father of it
[49:54] now let me put this say whenever you
[49:57] think you're something I did this I did
[50:01] that you are speaking a lie
[50:04] right amen now you understand what I'm
[50:06] saying when you are in a boastful Spirit
[50:09] as if you have power as if you are the
[50:12] one that's doing something right
[50:14] remember the king in the New Testament I
[50:17] forgot his name amen he was speaking
[50:19] such ha yeah speaking and he was the one
[50:21] that fell over and worms came out of him
[50:23] and everything else because he put
[50:24] himself in God's place the only thing
[50:27] that makes us God in Gods because God is
[50:30] in US amen y'all hear what I'm saying it
[50:32] is not I could never become God or a god
[50:36] without God being in me amen
[50:40] hallelujah like the scripture say
[50:41] basically we're just worms
[50:44] right but when you get into yourself and
[50:47] you think that you are something you
[50:49] like Lucifer you're speaking a lie
[50:54] I know that's tough but it's true
[50:59] brother B said I'm nothing myself he
[51:02] said I'm just nothing now if the prophet
[51:04] can say that and he wasn't saying that
[51:06] to be modest he was truthful when you
[51:08] really got God on your Li in your inside
[51:11] you realize you're nothing
[51:14] you can't even think without him
[51:15] allowing you to think he moves your one
[51:18] thought moves his hand you done you're
[51:20] done you finished
[51:23] right in the message three Witnesses he
[51:25] said when Jesus was taken up on the
[51:27] mountain by Satan he let him look
[51:29] through the stream of time and showed
[51:32] him all the world and the kingdoms
[51:34] thereof and said their mine is that
[51:37] right and I give them to you if you fall
[51:40] down and worship me is that right see
[51:43] Satan will give you anything if you fall
[51:45] down and worship him
[51:48] right Jesus know I heard this on the
[51:51] talk show just yesterday and they
[51:53] were're talking about Hollywood and how
[51:54] filthy Hollywood hwood is and the man
[51:57] was I forgot his name he said whatever
[51:59] you do he said don't let your children
[52:00] go that way he said that is the
[52:02] filthiest thing he said and I tried to
[52:05] tell you tell you this he said there is
[52:07] no way that you you can get into
[52:09] Hollywood without humbling yourself
[52:12] y'all know what I mean by that
[52:14] or being humbled
[52:17] you got to sell something out you got to
[52:19] trade y'all care y'all like you're
[52:22] making it hard for me I know y'all know
[52:24] what I'm talking about but my point is
[52:26] amen isn't that the way it is with Satan
[52:30] right he did it to eeve you're not going
[52:32] to get what I say unless you
[52:36] that was the trade
[52:39] if that was the trade in the beginning
[52:41] that's the trade in the ending
[52:44] you don't gain anything from Satan
[52:47] without giving up something amen
[52:56] Jesus know he inherit them anyhow he
[53:00] said get thee hence Satan and then over
[53:04] in Revelation says Rejoice ye Heavens ye
[53:07] holy prophets for the kingdom of this
[53:09] world has become the kingdom of our Lord
[53:12] and of his Christ and as long as they're
[53:15] controlled by Satan they've got that
[53:18] satanic thoughts and Powers they'll
[53:21] fight until Jesus come
[53:24] okay now how are they controlled by
[53:26] Satan in their thoughts in their minds
[53:31] hello and he said as long as they're
[53:34] being controlled by Satan he said they
[53:37] continue to fight that's what he said he
[53:39] said we don't have to worry about wars
[53:41] they going to always have them until
[53:44] Jesus come H because they are controlled
[53:48] by Satan's thoughts
[53:50] right and there be a stone he out of the
[53:53] mountain someday without hands that'll
[53:55] break these World Kingdom into pieces
[53:58] and there'll come a kingdom out of there
[54:00] Hallelujah he said I'm glad tonight I'm
[54:03] a candidate of that Kingdom he said yes
[54:05] sir and then there'll be no more war
[54:08] there'll be no more war after that now
[54:12] I'm saying all these things because we
[54:15] don't realize and I wish I could preach
[54:17] Calvary the way I see it because if we
[54:20] can see what he did for us now that was
[54:23] phenomenal that was powerful
[54:25] but when he came and he took the book
[54:27] according to Revelation 5 don't you
[54:29] realize he's saying yes Not only was I
[54:32] prove myself to be the true Messiah to
[54:35] be the true God of the earth he comes
[54:37] along he says but now by claiming this I
[54:40] Got Heaven and I got Earth I got
[54:43] everything Adam lost I got it back is
[54:45] that right because that's what brother
[54:47] brandham said he said when the seals
[54:49] were open and placed us back into the
[54:51] Garden of Eden before the fall now
[54:54] that's our power that's our right but if
[54:58] God can't get our minds in that place
[55:01] amen we're just sitting here with all
[55:02] his ammunition and not know what to do
[55:04] with it that's what it is
[55:08] we've got all his authority we don't
[55:11] have to live like we're in a cursed
[55:13] world Amen because the cursed world is
[55:16] subject to us amen come on somebody
[55:19] that's how Jesus lived he lived like he
[55:22] would live in heaven he ordered that
[55:25] here like he would order in heaven there
[55:27] was no obstacle for him
[55:31] everything that came his way he
[55:34] controlled it he spoke it or whatever he
[55:37] he he was a god of it am am I making
[55:41] sense because see that's how it is the
[55:44] seal has brought us back to that place
[55:47] and this is what God is trying to get us
[55:49] to see wake up because we are the gods
[55:53] of this Earth amen
[55:55] amen not by power not by might but by
[55:58] his Spirit
[56:01] there's a greater God there's more God
[56:03] for all of us and we've got to press
[56:06] into it press into it press into it
[56:08] because that's where God want us to be
[56:11] the whole creation has been groaning for
[56:13] this
[56:17] but we so busy
[56:20] word about our Salvation as you've heard
[56:22] me say when your salvation is sure
[56:25] sealed
[56:32] father I will that they also whom thou
[56:35] has given me be with me where I am that
[56:37] they may behold my glory which thou has
[56:41] given me but thou lovest me before the
[56:43] foundation of the world is he talking
[56:45] about just way down the road
[56:48] because you got to realize Jesus Christ
[56:50] received the father's Glory here
[56:53] so if he received the father's Glory
[56:55] here we supposed to receive it here
[56:57] before we get there
[57:00] Hallelujah am I making sense because you
[57:02] and I must realize amen that's what
[57:04] brother what happened with brother
[57:05] brandham brother brandham God took
[57:07] brother brandham and showed him that he
[57:10] even had Now understand this it's it
[57:12] will always be prompt by God when it
[57:15] comes to speaking to storms and speaking
[57:16] to squirrels and all of these things God
[57:18] has always been the instigator of that
[57:21] right because he knows with us we'll put
[57:23] things out of order
[57:25] yeah yeah he gave Elijah Authority and
[57:28] Elijah said Lord send down the fire
[57:31] right so you got yeah God knows us so he
[57:35] prompts us to do what he wants us to do
[57:38] and then blesses us to do it you love
[57:41] the Lord amen I know I can't finish this
[57:44] tonight it just I just wanted to
[57:47] encourage you just give me a few more
[57:49] minutes I'm not far from the end listen
[57:51] you have been chosen you have been
[57:54] chosen
[57:56] amen if you could have say that in your
[57:58] heart right now I have been chosen
[58:01] from the foundation of the world is that
[58:03] right the Bible said as he have chosen
[58:05] Us in him before the founds of the world
[58:10] that we should be holy Without Blame
[58:12] before him in what love
[58:16] in love
[58:18] love God you become blameless love him
[58:22] amen
[58:26] is that right
[58:34] first Peter and this is my last
[58:35] scripture
[58:44] understand Jesus Christ the whole thing
[58:46] has been about you
[58:49] the challenge of Satan to God and Isaiah
[58:52] was about you
[58:54] amen God comes down and shows that the
[58:57] whole thing of creation was about Eve
[59:01] right and then God comes along right
[59:04] every bad situation
[59:07] you know it it it takes the focus off
[59:09] the man and put it on the woman it shows
[59:12] amen basically how she was either sold
[59:14] out or redeemed
[59:16] and here God comes along and he's and
[59:18] he's and he's showing to us amen that
[59:21] you're so free and I want you to know
[59:23] that because you know my thing is this I
[59:25] always think Lord what about those
[59:28] people that wasting their time what if
[59:29] that what if what if a person was not
[59:31] elected but yet to make a bride but yet
[59:34] God got him right among that
[59:38] now let me ask you a question and it
[59:39] sound kind of crazy I don't want you to
[59:41] ever think that you're not elected but
[59:44] if I felt let me put it this way if I
[59:46] felt like I wasn't elected but I was
[59:47] among this message I would enjoy it so
[59:50] much
[59:52] I put everything I got into it because I
[59:54] know this is all I'm going to get
[59:57] but this is better than hell
[1:00:02] y'all hear what I'm saying I would give
[1:00:04] it all I got
[1:00:06] like brother BR like brother BR say may
[1:00:09] that possibility
[1:00:12] maybe there's a possibility you see and
[1:00:15] that's that's why I could never ever
[1:00:18] just allow Satan believe make me believe
[1:00:21] that I'm not bride
[1:00:23] he comes and he talks to me like you
[1:00:24] ain't right I said I can't explain it
[1:00:27] but I know I am I can't even see why I
[1:00:30] am but I am
[1:00:35] you're not taking that from me you old
[1:00:36] Thief
[1:00:38] that's what he is he's a liar and a
[1:00:41] thief
[1:00:43] and I'm not going to look at me I'm
[1:00:44] going to look at my lamb he was perfect
[1:00:47] so praise God my perfect lamb took my
[1:00:49] place 1 Peter 1:23 and I'm going to let
[1:00:52] you go I'm sorry that's not where I want
[1:00:54] w't you yes yes I do
[1:00:58] somehow I got a scripture mixed up here
[1:01:00] somewhere but I'm going to read it to it
[1:01:02] to you being born again not of
[1:01:04] corruptible seed that's Corinthians but
[1:01:06] of in incorrupt corruptible by the word
[1:01:09] of God which liveth and abideth forever
[1:01:14] right now I'm going take you to
[1:01:15] Corinthians the 15th chapter beginning
[1:01:17] at the 4 2nd verse so also is the
[1:01:20] resurrection of the dead it is sown in
[1:01:23] corruption is is raised in incorruption
[1:01:26] corruption means to be made inferior by
[1:01:29] errors or alterations or to pervert
[1:01:33] right something that comes in that
[1:01:35] destroys right
[1:01:38] now the Bible said we were sown in
[1:01:39] corruption but we're raised incorruption
[1:01:42] in incorruption it is sown in dishonor
[1:01:47] it is raised in glory it is sown in
[1:01:50] weakness it is raised in power now think
[1:01:53] about it how God looks at a dead body
[1:01:56] that the ministry or whoever would touch
[1:01:58] it had to sanctify themselves and be
[1:02:00] away from the people so many days and
[1:02:02] all of that there is you know nothing
[1:02:06] like a dead body human especially
[1:02:10] nothing can smell like the human body I
[1:02:12] heard it was the worst ever of all
[1:02:14] creatures and my thing is can if it
[1:02:18] that's bad can you can you imagine the
[1:02:20] way a holy God looks at it but God hid
[1:02:24] his seed in such a mess
[1:02:27] that's the only reason why we would ever
[1:02:28] get up out of the Grave because of the
[1:02:31] seed of God remaining in usen right it
[1:02:34] ain't your flesh it'll never be your
[1:02:35] flesh that'll get you to heaven amen
[1:02:38] that's what brother brand said in the
[1:02:40] Seven Seals right at the end he talks
[1:02:41] about I use that word corrupt but he
[1:02:43] doesn't use the word corrupt he talks
[1:02:45] about in general I said like this he
[1:02:46] said you'll be as bad as you always have
[1:02:48] been but he was working with your flesh
[1:02:51] there is no conversion in your flesh
[1:02:53] until God changes it don't you wish you
[1:02:57] would had some converted flesh by now
[1:03:01] that joke I don't care how much you've
[1:03:02] learned this word and know this word
[1:03:04] he's always a rebel
[1:03:07] it is sown and dishonor it is raised in
[1:03:09] glory it is sown in weakness it is
[1:03:11] raised in power it is s a natural body
[1:03:14] it is raised a spiritual body there is a
[1:03:17] natural body and there is a spiritual
[1:03:19] body folks and so it is written the
[1:03:21] first man Adam I love this scripture and
[1:03:23] I don't know
[1:03:25] why I it just means so much to me
[1:03:27] because I can see it I can literally see
[1:03:30] what God has done here it is raised
[1:03:32] spiritual body there's a natural body
[1:03:34] and there's a spiritual body and so it
[1:03:36] is written the first man Adam was made a
[1:03:38] living Soul the last man was made a
[1:03:41] quickening spirit how be it that was not
[1:03:45] first which is spiritual but that which
[1:03:47] is natural and how after was that which
[1:03:49] is spiritual the first man is of the
[1:03:52] earth earthy the second man is the Lord
[1:03:55] From Heaven see what I'm saying now the
[1:03:58] Lord From Heaven had children
[1:04:02] amen
[1:04:04] and he redeemed every one of us
[1:04:09] now you got to reckon within yourself
[1:04:12] that you know that you know that you
[1:04:13] know that you know you did not come from
[1:04:16] Satan amen
[1:04:19] and if you didn't come from Satan where
[1:04:21] did you come from oh come on it's so
[1:04:24] simple
[1:04:26] if you know you didn't come from Satan
[1:04:28] where did you come from there's only two
[1:04:31] Gods
[1:04:33] really only one God but God of this evil
[1:04:37] age is Lucifer
[1:04:41] if you didn't come from here if you're
[1:04:42] not among his children are you among his
[1:04:44] children oh no no no so you got to
[1:04:47] realize amen you come yo y your your
[1:04:50] your Adam your your creator where you
[1:04:53] came from was from heaven and he's the
[1:04:55] Lord From Heaven as is the Earthly such
[1:04:58] are also that are Earthly and as is the
[1:05:01] Heavenly such are they also that are
[1:05:03] Heavenly and as we have borne the image
[1:05:05] of the Earthly we shall also bear the
[1:05:08] image of the that's me amen that's you
[1:05:13] amen it is a reality that we bore the
[1:05:16] image of the earthy so if we have done
[1:05:19] that and we now got the Heavenly in us
[1:05:21] what's going to stop us from boring
[1:05:24] bearing the uh Heavenly
[1:05:27] we ought to be resting Amen in our minds
[1:05:30] and pressing right going forward instead
[1:05:33] of standing still
[1:05:36] why we've got too many things tagged to
[1:05:38] us that we ought not not to have because
[1:05:42] it's not there amen all these things
[1:05:44] that you think got you tag to you is
[1:05:46] your imagination
[1:05:48] and the trickery of Satan because he
[1:05:51] whom the son has set free is free indeed
[1:05:53] and when you begin to realize that you
[1:05:55] are free everything that has you in
[1:05:57] bondage must go amen resist the devil
[1:06:00] and he'll flee from you that's the Bible
[1:06:03] resist him and he go ignore him
[1:06:09] and he'll go let's stand
[1:06:15] cuz he's lying all the time and like I
[1:06:17] said if we can just get into a prayer a
[1:06:20] prayer uh spirit of Prayer you'll be
[1:06:24] surprised how so many of the chains will
[1:06:28] fall
[1:06:31] God is looking for a bride who's
[1:06:32] completely free brother randam said only
[1:06:35] those who are not bolted down said they
[1:06:37] might be metal said but if they're
[1:06:38] bolted down they won't go up
[1:06:41] you got to be free metal
[1:06:44] when the magnet comes he ain't he ain't
[1:06:46] untying nothing he just taking
[1:06:48] everything that's loose
[1:06:51] Hallelujah free free from all of this
[1:06:55] world free from this bondage and these
[1:06:57] it's an illusion
[1:06:59] and Satan is a mastermind of Tricks
[1:07:03] but my God knows everyone he can pull
[1:07:05] out of his hat amen and we so thank God
[1:07:08] for having a God who
[1:07:11] have taken care of everything
[1:07:14] I I the more I see it the more I look at
[1:07:16] it just is so
[1:07:20] how can you say it is believable but yet
[1:07:23] so so unbelievable that God could do
[1:07:26] such a thing for me I don't know how you
[1:07:29] feel about it but I have to personalize
[1:07:31] it you know because I realize amen that
[1:07:34] without God I'm wicked
[1:07:41] without him I don't know how else to
[1:07:42] describe me this old flesh and
[1:07:46] I was telling God how how I go to church
[1:07:48] and everything else he said yeah I said
[1:07:50] yeah I I said I have to go to church I
[1:07:52] said you would be surprise on the things
[1:07:54] that flow through my head
[1:07:58] but God always builds the fence around
[1:08:01] me Hallelujah come on somebody amen he
[1:08:04] give me the strength to let don't let
[1:08:06] the birds nest there now don't let them
[1:08:07] Nest amen you got to cast them out you
[1:08:10] got to pray pray that's where I'm
[1:08:12] getting my victory folks I'm getting my
[1:08:13] victory in prayer that's where I get
[1:08:16] mine you love the Lord amen
[1:08:20] just keep on praying
[1:08:23] all the the Lord is now
[1:08:26] just keep on praying
[1:08:30] he your cry
[1:08:33] for the Lord has Pro
[1:08:36] and his word is true
