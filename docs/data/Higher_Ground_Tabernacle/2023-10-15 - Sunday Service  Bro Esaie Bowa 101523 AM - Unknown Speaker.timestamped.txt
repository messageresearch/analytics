[37:13] provinces that in those days when the
[37:16] king assus sat on the throne of his
[37:19] kingdom which
[37:20] was the

[38:06] score days that means six
[38:24] months and when these days were expired
[38:27] the king made a feast unto all the
[38:29] people that were present in shushan and
[38:31] the palace both unto Great and Small
[38:34] seven days in the courts of the garden
[38:36] of the king's
[38:38] Palace the nth
[38:46] verse also V the queen Made A Feast for
[38:49] the women um where am I for the women in
[38:52] the Royal house which belonged to King
[38:55] assus
[39:08] Haron
[39:10] z
[39:20] [Music]
[39:24] z on the seventh day when the heart of
[39:27] the King was married with wine he
[39:29] commanded meuman bista harbona Bika and
[39:33] ab abaka ziar and carcass the seven
[39:37] chamberlains that served in the presence
[39:39] of aarius the king to bring V to the
[39:41] queen before the king with the Crown
[39:44] Royal to show the people and the princes
[39:46] her beauty for she was fair to look
[39:55] up
[40:03] but the queeni refused to come at the
[40:05] king's commandment by his chamberlains
[40:07] therefore was the king very wroth and
[40:11] his anger burned in him you may have
[40:13] your
[40:25] seat then King said to the wise men
[40:27] which knew the times for so was the
[40:30] king's manner towards all the new law
[40:32] and
[40:55] judgment and and the next unto him was K
[40:59] Shor adata tares mares marcena and mimen
[41:05] the Seven princes of Persia and media
[41:07] which saw the king's face and which set
[41:09] the first in the
[41:25] Kingdom
[41:33] what shall we do unto the queen vasti
[41:35] according to the law because she had not
[41:37] performed the Commandment of the King
[41:38] aarius by the chamberlains this was a
[41:41] question that the King was asking to the
[41:43] seven chamberlains to see what they can
[41:46] apply to the queen
[41:55] VY
[42:08] and mic was one of the seven that
[42:10] answered and he said and Micon answered
[42:13] before the king and the princes Vash the
[42:16] queen ha not done wrong to the king only
[42:18] but also to all the princes and to all
[42:20] the people that are in all the provinces
[42:23] of the king
[42:25] assar
[42:39] for this deed of the queen shall come
[42:41] abroad onto all women so that they shall
[42:43] despise their husband in their eyes when
[42:46] it shall be reported the king assus
[42:48] commanded vashti the queen to be brought
[42:50] in before him but she came
[42:54] not princess
[42:56] [Music]
[43:12] likewise shall the ladies of Persia and
[43:15] media say this day unto all the kings
[43:17] princes which have heard of the deed of
[43:19] the queen thus shall there arise too
[43:21] much contempt and wrath so um all the
[43:24] women were going to to this SP their
[43:27] husband just like V
[43:54] did and if he please the king King Let
[43:57] Let There Go a royal commandment from
[43:59] him and let it be written among the laws
[44:01] of Persians and the Midas that it be not
[44:04] altered the vashi come not before King
[44:07] aaras and let the King give her royal
[44:10] give her Royal Estates unto another that
[44:13] is better than
[44:25] she and when the king's decree uh decree
[44:29] which he shall
[44:30] make uh which he shall make shall be
[44:33] published throughout all his Empire for
[44:35] it is great all the wives that all the
[44:38] wives shall give to their husband honor
[44:40] both to Great and
[44:47] Small and the saying pleased the king
[44:50] and the princes and the King did
[44:52] according to the word of
[44:54] micin
[45:15] for he sent letters into all the kings
[45:17] provinces into every Province according
[45:20] to the writing thereof and to every
[45:22] people after their language that every
[45:24] man should bear rule in his own house
[45:27] and that it should be published
[45:29] according to the language of every
[45:32] people may the Lord bless the reading of
[45:34] his
[45:38] word we're going to try to talk this
[45:43] morning about uh the behavior of the
[45:47] queen
[45:51] vas it's a message that I preach in Iowa
[45:54] City
[45:58] and I started preaching on it three
[45:59] weeks
[46:03] ago the first time uh I preach about the
[46:07] conduct or behavior of Queen
[46:17] Vash which took us about two Sundays and
[46:19] the last Sundays was Esther with a royal
[46:24] crown
[46:31] this morning I thought I could speak
[46:33] about Queen to Queen
[46:41] Esther but because there's so many
[46:43] things to say I don't think uh it can be
[46:45] said in one
[46:49] day that's why I'm going back to the uh
[46:53] behavior of Queen
[46:54] vasy
[46:58] we'll see what
[47:04] did and what made her lose her place as
[47:08] a queen next to the
[47:13] king it's not in vain that I took my
[47:15] time to read all
[47:21] this it was so that even if I'm not able
[47:23] to say anything but like you can already
[47:25] read it from the
[47:28] word and you can read it at home
[47:34] too if I could say one
[47:38] thing that you don't you disagree
[47:42] with just think of it as ignorance for
[47:48] me just say the preacher doesn't know
[47:53] anything but if I say something that is
[47:55] in the
[47:57] word take it and put it in your
[48:01] heart and say thank
[48:07] you for telling you something according
[48:09] to his
[48:11] word something that can help
[48:14] you we are all here to be
[48:18] helped and I standing
[48:22] here I'm the person that most need uh
[48:25] that needs the most
[48:30] help especially in this moment I really
[48:32] need the help of the Holy
[48:36] GH so that I may say what God want me to
[48:41] say because if I say something that just
[48:44] comes from myself it's going to create
[48:47] trouble it's not going to be received
[48:51] by that's why I really need the help of
[48:53] the Holy Ghost
[48:56] so that he may use my
[49:00] mouth so that he may speak the way he
[49:03] wants things to be
[49:05] said so brothers and
[49:08] sisters I'm going to talk about
[49:12] queen as we read
[49:17] here was this
[49:20] beautiful queen that the king
[49:24] l
[49:26] because the Bible says that V was fair
[49:28] to look
[49:31] on and the King assus was
[49:36] rich and his kingdom was from India to
[49:42] Ethiopia and he had around
[49:48] 127 and each province was led by a
[49:51] prince or a
[49:54] governor
[50:00] and King assus gathered all the princes
[50:02] in the
[50:04] capital and the Bible
[50:09] says he started showing them his riches
[50:15] for as he gathered them
[50:19] inan he offered a big
[50:24] feast
[50:26] and in that F was showing them how rich
[50:29] he
[50:35] was we read here that he showed them his
[50:38] riches for for 180
[50:41] days I believe on the
[50:46] earth there's not a person that can show
[50:49] off his riches for 180
[50:53] days this King was the most Parish in in
[50:56] in the in
[50:59] the and in that time that he gathered
[51:01] with all the
[51:04] princes and he was married with
[51:10] wine he thought to invite the
[51:14] queen this beautiful woman that
[51:18] he he thought he had the honor to
[51:22] present to present her in front of the
[51:26] he sent seven
[51:32] chamberlains they had the power to
[51:35] announce the message of the king to the
[51:40] queen and when the seven chamberlains
[51:42] got to Queen
[51:45] B they say the king needs
[51:49] you he wants you to appear
[51:54] before because he want to present you to
[51:56] his
[51:58] guest but Queen vas refused to
[52:03] go and she said tell him I'm not
[52:11] coming and and queen Vash refused to
[52:14] appear in front of the
[52:17] king which means she she
[52:21] humiliated she disobeyed to her
[52:24] husband
[52:26] which shows that the the King was
[52:30] humili he became without
[52:35] value and he upsets the
[52:39] king that he gathered all the
[52:46] princes and ask them what law shall we
[52:48] apply to the
[52:50] queen embarrassing the
[52:54] king which law are we going to apply
[53:00] to so among those seven princes that
[53:02] were with the
[53:06] king the Bible says there was a seventh
[53:09] one called
[53:15] M and when I read how many letters makes
[53:18] the name
[53:20] of I found that it was seven
[53:24] letters and you see it was seven
[53:27] prin and M was the seventh one and I
[53:35] understood that here there is nothing
[53:37] else but just the seventh messenger of
[53:39] the
[53:40] age because his name has seven
[53:44] letters and only
[53:47] him had the courage to speak in front of
[53:50] the
[53:51] king and to tell the king
[53:54] this
[53:55] he said
[53:58] King what queen V
[54:01] did is just
[54:05] unacceptable because what she
[54:08] did not only did it to
[54:12] you but she Al also did it to all the
[54:16] prin all the people gathered
[54:20] here she disrespected all of
[54:23] us so because of that
[54:29] you the king have to write a
[54:32] decree you have to write a
[54:35] letter in which you must
[54:39] say que V will never appear before the
[54:43] king because of her
[54:49] Disobedience because of the
[54:50] embarrassment she made you go through
[54:53] today and now
[54:58] you will send these letters to all the
[54:59] provinces in your
[55:01] king because what she
[55:04] did not only she did it to
[55:07] you but she also did it to all of
[55:11] us and us the princes we also have our
[55:16] wives when our wives will learn what the
[55:21] que when they know that the king called
[55:25] and the queen did not
[55:31] come it's going to bring this
[55:34] spice uh and uh anger
[55:38] everywhere the act of the
[55:40] queen it's just
[55:44] unacceptable so you the king you have to
[55:47] write and send it to all the
[55:50] Prov and in that letter you must
[55:54] say
[55:56] that every man got to be the master in
[55:58] his
[56:00] house and not only will he be the master
[56:02] in
[56:05] his he will also speak the language of
[56:07] his
[56:09] people because if you're a master in
[56:11] your
[56:12] house but you do not speak the language
[56:15] of your
[56:17] people how will people know that you
[56:19] were master in your own
[56:21] house you have to speak the language of
[56:23] your
[56:26] so that when your people come to
[56:28] you and that you give an
[56:32] order and they will hear that the man
[56:35] gave
[56:36] order so you must speak the language of
[56:39] your
[56:40] people they must understand that you
[56:43] gave an
[56:46] order and we'll see what the mother will
[56:49] do and if she doesn't do
[56:53] it we just know that the man is not
[56:55] master own house it's in the
[56:58] [Music]
[57:00] Bible we're still in the
[57:05] Bible every man had to be a master in
[57:08] his own
[57:12] house that was sufficient to just stop
[57:16] there but M the seventh
[57:19] one he said not only shall he be a
[57:23] master but must also speak the language
[57:26] of his
[57:29] people so that when the people come to
[57:31] visit
[57:35] you you're not speaking in a language
[57:37] like in codes that they do not
[57:39] understand but you
[57:41] say I want you to do
[57:46] this and the people are in the living
[57:49] room they can hear what you
[57:53] say
[57:57] so it shouldn't be that when the people
[57:59] are there you start speaking in a
[58:00] language that they do not
[58:05] understand so that when you give an
[58:07] order and that order has
[58:09] not applied so you got to be a master in
[58:12] your own
[58:14] house and speak the language of your
[58:17] people you say do
[58:22] this and the people are there hear what
[58:25] you say the order has been
[58:28] given now they they're waiting and
[58:31] they they checking to see if the order
[58:33] will be
[58:34] executed if the order is not
[58:37] executed they will
[58:40] say that the man is not master in his
[58:43] own house that's in the
[58:45] Bible that's in the
[58:50] Bible he represented the seventh
[58:53] messenger
[58:57] he told the king that the king had to
[58:58] send all the
[59:03] letters uh to REM remove queen V from
[59:07] her function as a
[59:10] queen I think V where
[59:14] she where she was having that Feast with
[59:17] all those other
[59:18] women I can
[59:23] imagine was there in the feast with all
[59:27] women and when the message got to her
[59:31] that the king needs
[59:33] you I can imagine another woman who's
[59:36] telling
[59:37] her why would the king need
[59:42] you why can he not just be happy with
[59:45] the man over
[59:46] there why why is he calling you
[59:50] now no just go tell them that you're not
[59:53] coming
[59:58] and the queen also answered as the other
[1:00:01] woman told
[1:00:03] her and the message got to the
[1:00:06] king and when the king got the
[1:00:09] message that the queen
[1:00:11] refused
[1:00:14] now Mican is telling the
[1:00:18] king to uh uh um expulse to to remove
[1:00:24] the the
[1:00:28] wife because of
[1:00:32] Disobedience and the the king doesn't
[1:00:34] know what to
[1:00:36] do and he says what
[1:00:42] the but she also did it to us not just
[1:00:47] us but also to all the people
[1:00:50] that because what example has the queen
[1:00:53] given
[1:00:56] because our wives who are
[1:00:59] prin uh they will hear what the
[1:01:03] queen they will also despise their
[1:01:07] husband and then you'll just be
[1:01:11] despised so to stop
[1:01:14] it you have to send
[1:01:16] letters that the queen V is no longer
[1:01:20] Queen I can imagine the
[1:01:23] queen when the news got to
[1:01:26] her she started telling her
[1:01:31] friends you see what we you got me into
[1:01:35] now now I've been U uh
[1:01:40] uh uh that this is
[1:01:43] why especially to our
[1:01:47] s you have to pay attention to what kind
[1:01:49] of friends you have and what advice is
[1:01:53] they're giving because you may you can
[1:01:55] regret
[1:01:57] later something may happen to you and
[1:02:01] you start
[1:02:04] regretting so you must also
[1:02:07] know that each man that you're seeing
[1:02:11] here he always have that one person that
[1:02:14] he Leen to the
[1:02:16] most he always have that one
[1:02:20] person and the advice of that
[1:02:23] person
[1:02:24] will always find its place in your
[1:02:26] husband let's say things
[1:02:29] clearly because I just read that in the
[1:02:35] Bible there will always be a mamin
[1:02:42] somewhere who will force your
[1:02:46] husband to apply something on
[1:02:49] you and you're going to start
[1:02:53] regretting but but I'm going to speak as
[1:02:55] I
[1:02:56] said of the behavior of the queen
[1:03:00] vas because the prophet says
[1:03:04] this that a woman in the Bible she
[1:03:07] typifies the
[1:03:11] church and this morning we're going to
[1:03:13] uh emphasize on
[1:03:15] women the behavior of
[1:03:18] women because the prophet
[1:03:23] said if you want to know the level of a
[1:03:28] church look how the women of that church
[1:03:35] behave brother could have said look how
[1:03:38] the men in that church carry
[1:03:41] themselves but he did not say that he
[1:03:43] said look how the women car themselves
[1:03:46] the
[1:03:49] church and that shows you the spiritual
[1:03:51] level that the church has
[1:03:56] and to have a more Spiritual
[1:03:59] Church you need to hit harder on the
[1:04:02] women's
[1:04:04] side that's why this morning my precious
[1:04:08] sisters don't say that the brothers
[1:04:10] corrupted
[1:04:12] me no they did not
[1:04:15] corrupt that's what the prophet
[1:04:18] said to have a spiritual
[1:04:23] church
[1:04:25] you got to hit hard on the women's
[1:04:29] side because the woman has
[1:04:34] power and we live in a world where the
[1:04:36] woman is
[1:04:39] worshiped the woman has more power in
[1:04:42] this country than the man
[1:04:45] has yes brothers and
[1:04:48] sisters why do we have to insist on the
[1:04:50] women's side because the
[1:04:53] prophet
[1:04:55] because the woman was the first being to
[1:04:57] be
[1:04:59] dece by the serpent he wasn't
[1:05:02] man she was the first
[1:05:04] one and when she had she was
[1:05:07] deceived from that time from that
[1:05:13] time the woman listens more to the
[1:05:16] serpent than her
[1:05:18] hband the woman listens more to the
[1:05:22] serpent than God
[1:05:25] and the serpent is closer to the
[1:05:28] woman than God is to the
[1:05:33] woman it's very hard what is it
[1:05:37] hard I'm going to say things
[1:05:40] today in a way that I've never said
[1:05:43] before even if it
[1:05:47] hurts understand I'm not going to try to
[1:05:50] cause harm to anybody but I want the
[1:05:53] church to be more spirit
[1:06:01] true so every time in the Bible where
[1:06:04] it's written about a
[1:06:07] woman the prophet tells us that he types
[1:06:10] the woman at the
[1:06:13] church so the woman was deceived by the
[1:06:20] serpent so she brought the same
[1:06:22] deception uh the same
[1:06:24] husband and we know everything that
[1:06:30] happened there's always one thing that I
[1:06:34] noticed as I told
[1:06:38] you that since the woman was deceived by
[1:06:41] the
[1:06:44] serpent she stayed closer to the
[1:06:48] serpent then she is to
[1:06:51] God and she listens more to the ser
[1:06:57] Serpent and the serpent made her so
[1:07:00] beautiful especially in this
[1:07:03] an all the Cosmetic products we have in
[1:07:05] the
[1:07:08] market the serpant really made the woman
[1:07:13] fair and it's where the prophet of God
[1:07:17] says that beauty comes from the
[1:07:22] devil uh can our sisters say
[1:07:27] Amen uh beauty comes from the devil
[1:07:29] isn't
[1:07:34] it it's brother Bram that says it let me
[1:07:36] read
[1:07:39] it in questions and answers number one
[1:07:42] he says
[1:07:43] this in
[1:07:49] 64 you know in every life there is the
[1:07:52] male is the prettiest
[1:07:56] but the human
[1:07:59] race take any
[1:08:01] bird any
[1:08:04] cow take a bunch of
[1:08:07] cattle which is the
[1:08:13] prettiest the old crumpled horn cow or
[1:08:16] the
[1:08:18] big it's the uh uh uh bull that's uh
[1:08:22] prettiest
[1:08:27] take a deer which is the Little D or the
[1:08:32] buck it's the male that's
[1:08:38] prettiest take a bunch of
[1:08:42] elk which is the
[1:08:44] prettiest the male or the
[1:08:47] female so in all the animal
[1:08:52] species is the male which is the
[1:08:58] prettiest uh you see uh take the
[1:09:05] bird or the pretty Cardinal or the
[1:09:08] Little Speckled hand sit on her
[1:09:17] nest he said the male is the prettiest
[1:09:20] but the female to the
[1:09:22] human
[1:09:26] she caused the
[1:09:27] fall the
[1:09:31] female Satan chose her right
[1:09:36] there and beauty is of the
[1:09:39] devil can we say
[1:09:44] Amen since the fall of the
[1:09:47] woman she stayed closer to
[1:09:51] Satan she listens more to Satan
[1:09:57] despite the thought that comes to her
[1:10:01] spirit she's always ready to execute
[1:10:05] it that's why the prophet
[1:10:08] says a woman does not have
[1:10:12] discernment but the discernment has been
[1:10:15] given to the
[1:10:17] man because everything that comes to the
[1:10:20] spirit of a
[1:10:22] woman
[1:10:24] she has always had the desire to execute
[1:10:28] it without making it Go by the filter of
[1:10:31] the
[1:10:33] word so she has stayed closer to
[1:10:37] Satan she listens to Satan
[1:10:40] more even more than her
[1:10:42] husband oh you
[1:10:45] know a woman as we
[1:10:47] read uh types to
[1:10:51] church so when we take the natural image
[1:10:55] we go with it to the
[1:10:57] spiritual the church in the
[1:11:00] spiritual listens more to
[1:11:03] Satan than she listens to
[1:11:08] God and each thought that goes
[1:11:12] through she's always ready to execute
[1:11:15] it so beauty is of the
[1:11:21] devil the devil has
[1:11:24] fill the spirit
[1:11:27] of to want to be satisfied with
[1:11:32] beauty a woman always want to be
[1:11:35] beautiful
[1:11:39] brother I know it's it's natural for a
[1:11:42] woman to want to be pretty but the
[1:11:46] devil feeds the spirit of the
[1:11:50] woman with with the disatisfaction
[1:11:54] of
[1:11:57] beauty and when there's a spirit like it
[1:12:00] when there's a spirit like it it's the
[1:12:06] devil listen to
[1:12:10] this so today the woman is always ready
[1:12:13] to copy
[1:12:15] everything everything she
[1:12:17] sees everything she sees on
[1:12:20] TV everything she sees on TV or on the
[1:12:25] Internet she's always ready to copy
[1:12:29] that she has models that she want to
[1:12:34] copy no the only model that we
[1:12:37] have we find it in the word
[1:12:40] of we find it in the
[1:12:42] message that is our
[1:12:47] model we do not have models of
[1:12:51] stars as our models
[1:12:55] uh no my brothers and
[1:13:00] sisters already warned you
[1:13:03] here my sisters forgive
[1:13:10] me because you're going to get out here
[1:13:12] thinking that today I only spoke about
[1:13:14] women sisters sisters
[1:13:19] sisters as if they corrupted me with
[1:13:21] money on the pocket in my pocket
[1:13:27] no as we read here as we heard
[1:13:31] here the leadership or the behavior
[1:13:34] of is the same thing for the
[1:13:39] church and if our women here behave any
[1:13:42] certain any
[1:13:44] ways the image that
[1:13:46] they that's the image of this
[1:13:49] church so we have to pay
[1:13:52] attention
[1:13:55] because we need a church that is very
[1:13:59] spiritual a church where the spirit of
[1:14:01] God can
[1:14:06] speak and our women are uh paying
[1:14:09] attention and ready to hear the message
[1:14:11] of
[1:14:14] God so now brothers and
[1:14:18] sisters as I said my sisters forgive
[1:14:21] me don't have a bad of
[1:14:25] me but I'm going to make sure to repeat
[1:14:28] what the prophet
[1:14:29] said so that if you have
[1:14:33] anything if you have anything to
[1:14:35] solve you will have to do it with
[1:14:39] Brother by me you wash me with water
[1:14:43] you'll say that he doesn't have a
[1:14:46] problem the problem the person that has
[1:14:48] a problem me the
[1:14:50] seventh he's the problem
[1:14:54] me I'm
[1:14:55] nothing it's that
[1:14:59] seven who CA that the queen V be
[1:15:03] expelled so brother
[1:15:08] Bram and of course I know woman wants to
[1:15:11] look pretty that's
[1:15:12] nature that's what it should
[1:15:17] be and he also says don't look like the
[1:15:22] world
[1:15:24] and he says in question and answers
[1:15:25] number
[1:15:27] three paragraph 188 he
[1:15:33] said and of course I know women wants to
[1:15:36] look pretty that's
[1:15:39] nature that's what they should
[1:15:42] be each woman should be
[1:15:45] pretty they should be that
[1:15:48] way so that's
[1:15:52] fine so otherwise like
[1:15:56] this don't look like the
[1:16:02] world see don't pattern after to the
[1:16:06] world things
[1:16:10] wrong you want to cut off your
[1:16:14] hair but don't cut your hair
[1:16:17] now if you got braids hanging down or
[1:16:20] whatever it is in your
[1:16:22] hair
[1:16:24] you leave it
[1:16:25] long don't cut
[1:16:29] it don't cut it to look like the
[1:16:33] world so the prophet is saying
[1:16:37] here it's natur it's natural for a woman
[1:16:41] to we're not refusing
[1:16:45] it but only when your
[1:16:49] beauty when you do your beauty do not
[1:16:51] copy the world
[1:16:55] uh do not try to look like the
[1:16:58] Kardashian do not try to look like
[1:17:01] Beyonce no do not look like
[1:17:04] them do not try to copy
[1:17:11] them do not look like the
[1:17:16] world so V was this queen that was
[1:17:22] beloved so the king wanted to
[1:17:26] show but because of her
[1:17:30] Disobedience she was
[1:17:33] expelled and she was
[1:17:39] replaced she
[1:17:41] was supposed to show a
[1:17:44] good an example of
[1:17:47] submission an example of
[1:17:51] respect because she was the first first
[1:17:53] woman of
[1:17:54] the she was supposed to be an example
[1:17:58] but she fail to
[1:17:59] do she gave a bad
[1:18:02] example mic seeing
[1:18:06] this he projected it in future
[1:18:09] years and he
[1:18:11] said he acts that the
[1:18:17] queen if the king doesn't put a
[1:18:20] law our women will uh turn against
[1:18:26] us uh men will be like papers in their
[1:18:29] house so to stop
[1:18:32] it you the king you must write a
[1:18:36] decree in which you must
[1:18:40] say each man must be a master in his
[1:18:44] house that he must speak the language of
[1:18:46] his
[1:18:48] people yes Disobedience of
[1:18:51] V caused her to be
[1:18:55] expelled today the
[1:18:57] church is supposed to be obedient to
[1:19:03] Christ they supposed to be obedient to
[1:19:08] God to respect the word of
[1:19:11] God to practice the
[1:19:15] word every
[1:19:17] point every
[1:19:19] principle every
[1:19:21] commandment
[1:19:24] the church is supposed to follow the
[1:19:26] word to align with the
[1:19:29] word to
[1:19:32] receive everything she needs of the and
[1:19:35] our
[1:19:36] King is the king of
[1:19:38] kings is the
[1:19:40] C his name is Jesus
[1:19:43] Christ and we must obey him in
[1:19:51] everything so the seventh
[1:19:54] messenger he
[1:19:56] said and the King sent
[1:20:01] letters and the queen was
[1:20:05] expelled as I told
[1:20:08] you we take the image of natural
[1:20:11] things to apply this to the
[1:20:15] spiritual so the prophet says in
[1:20:17] question and answers in
[1:20:20] Hebrews preaching 19
[1:20:24] 57 he says in paragraph 71
[1:20:29] 781 he said listen
[1:20:34] here the man is the
[1:20:39] ruler don't you he's talking about
[1:20:42] sisters don't you think you you will
[1:20:44] rule the
[1:20:47] house the man is the
[1:20:51] ruler
[1:20:54] don't you think you will rule rule the
[1:20:57] house you are not the ruler of the
[1:21:01] house you are not a
[1:21:03] slave but you are a
[1:21:08] helpmate and the man has the rule over
[1:21:11] his
[1:21:13] wife and he's responsible Solly for his
[1:21:19] wife God makes the man answer for his
[1:21:25] he must answer for his
[1:21:27] wife now you
[1:21:30] see read and see if God says that
[1:21:35] now the only responsible person woman
[1:21:39] when she's married it's her
[1:21:43] husband it's to him that God is going to
[1:21:47] ask when a woman is
[1:21:51] married
[1:21:53] she stops being under the rulership of
[1:21:55] her
[1:21:57] parents God is not going to
[1:22:00] ask to he's going to ask her husband can
[1:22:05] we say
[1:22:06] Amen it's brother Bram who say so
[1:22:10] God wants every
[1:22:14] man to be the ruler of his
[1:22:18] house he has the last
[1:22:21] word the absolute of his
[1:22:25] house he does not share his power with
[1:22:28] someone
[1:22:30] else and the woman shouldn't be on a
[1:22:35] horse in
[1:22:38] between she shouldn't be in
[1:22:44] between in between the leadership of her
[1:22:47] parents and her
[1:22:48] husband once she is
[1:22:51] married
[1:22:58] oh now when he says that oh brother
[1:22:59] Eugene is sitting
[1:23:01] there he knows the
[1:23:05] word he knows the consequences that come
[1:23:10] after because I know that's what is
[1:23:12] going in our minds right
[1:23:15] now is this uh uh something
[1:23:19] to
[1:23:21] H
[1:23:24] he knows the
[1:23:31] word
[1:23:33] now we must say things as they are if we
[1:23:37] don't say
[1:23:39] it our children who are growing
[1:23:42] up or that CH who's there they're living
[1:23:45] here in the
[1:23:50] us know who is going to show them if the
[1:23:54] word doesn't teach
[1:24:00] them we living in a state or a country
[1:24:03] where the woman has more power than the
[1:24:08] man which makes it as man is like a
[1:24:11] piece of
[1:24:13] paper no our daughters must
[1:24:17] know that when she is a married
[1:24:20] woman she depends on
[1:24:24] husband and her husband is the first
[1:24:28] ruler he has the last word on
[1:24:31] her as long as she's a married
[1:24:40] woman so the man rules
[1:24:44] over he is the only responsible for his
[1:24:48] wife and God makes the man answer for
[1:24:53] he must answer for his
[1:24:58] wife so you cannot share powers between
[1:25:01] the parents of the woman and the
[1:25:06] husband many times in
[1:25:11] uh that there was fight in
[1:25:15] between there were always
[1:25:17] trouble there were always problems why
[1:25:28] it's either because the
[1:25:29] parents the parents did not understand
[1:25:32] that their their their responsibility
[1:25:34] ended when the guy married the the
[1:25:38] daughter no the daughter the daughter
[1:25:40] will remain your daughter until death
[1:25:42] until your death she's your
[1:25:44] daughter but as long as she's a
[1:25:48] married she must be submissive to her
[1:25:51] husband
[1:25:53] because
[1:25:54] if she becomes
[1:25:57] disob and
[1:26:00] Disobedience it's going to cause her to
[1:26:02] be expelled it's in the
[1:26:09] word there's not such a bad
[1:26:13] thing as a woman who disobeys her
[1:26:18] husband and here the the queen
[1:26:21] V ex she gave a bad
[1:26:25] example let's say
[1:26:29] this if she even did it in
[1:26:32] secret between her and her
[1:26:35] husband we could have
[1:26:40] understood because in law we always say
[1:26:43] there are certain
[1:26:47] situations by the mistake that she
[1:26:51] made was to
[1:26:54] disrespect in
[1:26:58] public it's the worst thing that a woman
[1:27:00] can
[1:27:04] do and she was expelled because of
[1:27:09] that
[1:27:11] now she was there
[1:27:16] regretting she could have start uh uh
[1:27:19] blaming her
[1:27:21] friends and now see what you made me
[1:27:32] do now she could have gone ask the go
[1:27:36] ask the king I didn't know what happened
[1:27:37] to me I didn't
[1:27:42] know it wasn't me it was my friend
[1:27:46] who no the law was already and it was
[1:27:51] finished
[1:27:57] because in the beginning of chapter two
[1:27:58] it says the
[1:28:00] king let me just read the beginning of
[1:28:03] chapter two of
[1:28:08] Esther you'll see that the king started
[1:28:10] to feel sorry for
[1:28:13] vast but the law that he already
[1:28:17] wrote was not giving him access to get V
[1:28:20] back
[1:28:21] anymore let's read CH to after these
[1:28:26] things when the wrath of King assus was
[1:28:31] appeased he
[1:28:33] remembered and what she had
[1:28:36] done and what was decreed against
[1:28:40] her so
[1:28:43] he said oh I could get her
[1:28:46] back but the law
[1:28:49] decree because mamic was the wise man
[1:28:53] the seventh
[1:28:55] messenger who is against the spirit of
[1:28:59] women he doesn't play with
[1:29:02] women he made the the
[1:29:08] king that was not giving the king access
[1:29:10] to get basty
[1:29:13] back so the King was caught in his own
[1:29:18] trap you
[1:29:20] see now
[1:29:25] the king could start start saying
[1:29:29] oh if you had done
[1:29:32] this between us but you made the wrong
[1:29:34] thing by doing it
[1:29:36] publicly now you
[1:29:39] see I can't even get you back
[1:29:50] anymore so there are there are certain
[1:29:53] things that you can do between you and
[1:29:54] your husband that can be
[1:29:58] okay but there are certain things that
[1:30:00] you do not do in public because when you
[1:30:03] do it in
[1:30:06] public you're giving a bad image of
[1:30:09] yourself and what you don't know is that
[1:30:13] in each family in each
[1:30:16] house there there's always
[1:30:20] problems you do not want your problems
[1:30:22] to be known of everybody
[1:30:29] am and
[1:30:36] now I'm going to read what the prophet
[1:30:38] says concerning
[1:30:46] V the of the
[1:30:50] Lamb
[1:30:56] uh the marriage of the Lamb
[1:31:01] okay
[1:31:05] okay let me say this
[1:31:10] now I didn't say this to play but I said
[1:31:13] it in
[1:31:14] Parable so that you may
[1:31:20] understand it's exact
[1:31:22] what you older
[1:31:25] Christians are doing for these
[1:31:28] younger exactly
[1:31:32] right you're supposed to be
[1:31:35] examples you older
[1:31:40] Christians so you're supposed to be
[1:31:44] examples you Pentecostals that profess
[1:31:47] to have the Holy
[1:31:50] Ghost you are to be an example for the
[1:31:54] Methodist and Baptist and
[1:31:58] Presbyterians not like the first
[1:32:02] lady but like Jesus You're supposed to
[1:32:06] be he tells you in here what to do how
[1:32:09] to do
[1:32:12] it we must follow his rules and his
[1:32:16] examples but that's the way we find find
[1:32:20] it so after this
[1:32:23] queen he he's talking about vast he says
[1:32:27] this
[1:32:28] queen she wouldn't
[1:32:31] listen she wouldn't
[1:32:34] come she humiliated
[1:32:37] him and
[1:32:40] say if this first lady of the land set
[1:32:43] an example like
[1:32:45] that all the rest of the women will do
[1:32:50] it so then when a man calls for his
[1:32:53] wife she'll say go jump in the
[1:33:00] river he really for told about America
[1:33:06] he so what mic made the king
[1:33:09] say the prophet is
[1:33:14] saying as if he was for telling about
[1:33:20] America now we found out that in doing
[1:33:25] so then there was a man that had some
[1:33:28] wisdom about
[1:33:30] him and he said that's what you
[1:33:32] must to expel
[1:33:36] her and to send the message to all the
[1:33:40] nations and to pick all the young
[1:33:43] virgins
[1:33:44] that all the young
[1:33:49] virgins and that you may find a wife
[1:33:52] among
[1:33:53] them and he pleased the
[1:33:59] king so the condition that was in that
[1:34:05] time God was already seeing the spirits
[1:34:07] that was going to be on the
[1:34:10] earth and how women would treat their
[1:34:14] husband how women will be in the end
[1:34:18] times and what mimic made the king
[1:34:23] was as a
[1:34:26] prediction what women will do in the US
[1:34:30] today and to stop
[1:34:32] it he had to excommunicate
[1:34:35] her and you
[1:34:37] know that
[1:34:40] Israel has done the same thing to
[1:34:44] Jesus when Jesus came for
[1:34:47] them they were the elected people of God
[1:34:52] they were the Bride of
[1:34:53] Jesus but they rejected they killed
[1:34:57] him and Jesus
[1:35:00] exom he turned to the
[1:35:04] Nations and he picked a queen among the
[1:35:09] nation and we are that queen that took
[1:35:12] the place of
[1:35:13] Israel now my brothers
[1:35:17] and things that happened in the Old
[1:35:20] Testament
[1:35:23] where the image of things that should
[1:35:25] happen
[1:35:27] today God is
[1:35:30] looking an obedient
[1:35:32] woman an obedient
[1:35:34] Church in every
[1:35:37] principle in
[1:35:39] every every do of the
[1:35:42] Bible God
[1:35:44] needs women and
[1:35:46] men obedient to
[1:35:49] God who respect every word of God
[1:35:54] Amen let's go back to the Old
[1:35:57] Testament because we're
[1:36:00] talking respect every
[1:36:02] principle in the Old
[1:36:05] Testament we have this man that we call
[1:36:09] Joseph brother forgive
[1:36:12] me I'm not saying this to talk about
[1:36:17] you by yourself you will understand that
[1:36:20] it's not about you it's about it's not
[1:36:21] by
[1:36:25] coincidence
[1:36:27] Co and if you see the the tape from Iowa
[1:36:30] City I also say the same
[1:36:36] thing Joseph was the the type obedient
[1:36:39] of
[1:36:43] belie he was the image of a Believer
[1:36:48] obedient to God in every
[1:36:50] principle
[1:36:52] so that when he found himself in
[1:36:55] Egypt and when the wife of
[1:36:59] Pier wanted to sleep with
[1:37:04] Joseph Joseph
[1:37:07] refus he refused those things from that
[1:37:10] woman and what did he do he ran
[1:37:16] away and now us
[1:37:20] today it's not even that we are
[1:37:24] tempted but now it's we are going to go
[1:37:27] tempt those
[1:37:30] women because if it was that you got
[1:37:32] tempted we will
[1:37:35] understand but it's not that we
[1:37:38] are but we're even going to go tempt
[1:37:43] them but God needs a church obedience in
[1:37:47] every
[1:37:48] principle in every point of the word or
[1:37:51] thought of the word or
[1:37:54] period how can
[1:37:58] you how can you want God
[1:38:02] to a people that does not obey his
[1:38:06] word the bible
[1:38:10] say that God when he promises one
[1:38:14] thing that thing must be
[1:38:19] fulfilled God is obligated to
[1:38:23] word but where is the Fulfillment of the
[1:38:25] word of God in our
[1:38:28] lives because God needs an obedient
[1:38:31] church and
[1:38:34] vas she's the type of the
[1:38:37] disobedient she was
[1:38:41] excommunicated the source
[1:38:43] of was cut
[1:38:46] off she found
[1:38:48] herself she was just other women
[1:38:52] and the royal king or the Royal Crown
[1:38:55] was taken from
[1:38:57] her God needs men
[1:39:00] and obedient to his word in every
[1:39:07] principle what is God going to
[1:39:13] say church that does not apply the
[1:39:16] principles of the
[1:39:20] word
[1:39:21] God needs men and women my
[1:39:23] brothers
[1:39:25] obedient because the Bible
[1:39:28] say obedience is worth more than
[1:39:33] sacrifice I'm going to try to get done
[1:39:35] in the next 20 minutes bear with
[1:39:38] me bear with
[1:39:40] me the prophet
[1:39:43] says in this
[1:39:45] message questions and
[1:39:48] answer
[1:39:50] 1961
[1:39:53] I don't why I I studied a lot of
[1:39:55] questions and
[1:39:56] answers so if you have a
[1:39:59] question the answer is also
[1:40:02] there if you're asking yourself what you
[1:40:04] must
[1:40:06] do the answer is
[1:40:10] here uh my brothers and
[1:40:15] sisters you even hear that a man a woman
[1:40:18] beats her
[1:40:19] husband oh she slapped her
[1:40:26] husband in the name of the freedom in
[1:40:29] the
[1:40:30] US oh she slapped her
[1:40:37] husband and then the the police even put
[1:40:40] a restraint um on on the that
[1:40:45] man and that woman she walks with all uh
[1:40:50] no no
[1:40:55] no our sons and our children shouldn't
[1:40:58] do something like that the prophet
[1:41:01] says
[1:41:03] beginning what did I say when you
[1:41:07] see when you see
[1:41:14] anything Miles when you see a car uh
[1:41:17] getting uh down the road 90 M an hour
[1:41:25] get out of his
[1:41:28] way that's right when you see the first
[1:41:31] twist in
[1:41:32] anything get away from it stay away from
[1:41:37] it that's the ground you should not be
[1:41:49] on
[1:41:51] Satan will present
[1:41:55] something Satan will present something
[1:41:57] to you that will wreck your
[1:41:59] soul stay away from
[1:42:02] it sh the the very appearance of
[1:42:06] evil be a
[1:42:08] man be a
[1:42:12] woman I'm going to take up for the women
[1:42:15] for a
[1:42:19] minute he says that he says that's
[1:42:22] unusual I never do it but
[1:42:26] I'll he said I'm going to take up for
[1:42:28] the women a
[1:42:30] minutes that's unusual isn't
[1:42:32] it they
[1:42:35] say oh the
[1:42:37] woman oh it was the woman's
[1:42:40] fault and brother
[1:42:44] say if she hadn't gone out of her
[1:42:48] place well the man wouldn't go go got
[1:42:50] out of his that's
[1:42:53] true we'll say that's
[1:42:56] right she get out of her place and the
[1:43:00] prophet
[1:43:02] says a man can be
[1:43:06] bad a man cannot be bad L there is a bad
[1:43:10] woman but
[1:43:12] remember they cannot
[1:43:15] be a bad
[1:43:18] woman without being a bad man
[1:43:25] amen you oh she she she did she caused
[1:43:28] it she caus it yeah it's
[1:43:31] right but the prophet also took up for
[1:43:34] the women
[1:43:37] and a woman cannot do something
[1:43:43] wrong like vice versa if a man cannot do
[1:43:46] anything wrong if the
[1:43:48] woman and you who claim to be a Son of
[1:43:52] God where are your
[1:43:55] principles even if the woman is not out
[1:43:58] of her
[1:44:00] place aren't you a Son of
[1:44:04] God aren't you the one that's
[1:44:06] higher stronger
[1:44:09] vessel as the Bible
[1:44:11] says she's
[1:44:14] weaker then if she's
[1:44:17] weaker then show yourself a man of God
[1:44:26] a man
[1:44:28] cannot act bad if the woman didn't act
[1:44:30] bad in the first place same thing for
[1:44:32] the woman now my brothers and sisters as
[1:44:35] I as I
[1:44:38] said I'm skipping a few
[1:44:43] things so that we may go to the
[1:44:48] end so we need an obedient Church
[1:44:52] Church a a respectful
[1:44:57] Church brother says in marriage and
[1:45:01] divorce I'm not preaching marriage and
[1:45:03] divorce
[1:45:05] here I'm not telling the brothers to go
[1:45:08] excommunicate their
[1:45:11] wi it's not what is in my
[1:45:16] thoughts but my my thought is to have an
[1:45:19] Obed Church
[1:45:21] and for us to have an obedient
[1:45:24] church we taking the image of what our
[1:45:26] wives
[1:45:28] are because if you want to have a
[1:45:30] spiritual church let's see how what our
[1:45:33] wives
[1:45:35] are that's what's going to show us the
[1:45:37] exact place of what the church is
[1:45:40] in the prophet says in marriage and
[1:45:44] divorce in paragraph
[1:45:47] 243 he says
[1:45:49] this
[1:45:53] but to get this marriage and divorce
[1:45:54] straightened
[1:45:57] out so that you would know which was
[1:45:59] right and which was
[1:46:03] wrong now he plainly shows it here in
[1:46:06] This
[1:46:07] Ti there is one
[1:46:11] Christ and many members of the
[1:46:15] wife
[1:46:18] he he can put us away
[1:46:24] for Spiritual fornications and false
[1:46:27] do any time he wants
[1:46:34] to but how dare you try to put him
[1:46:39] away and make
[1:46:42] it he
[1:46:44] said the man can put away his
[1:46:47] wife and marry another one
[1:46:51] but the
[1:46:53] woman the woman put away her
[1:46:56] husand and but the woman cannot put away
[1:46:59] her
[1:47:00] husband she doesn't have that right
[1:47:03] because it breaks all
[1:47:05] thep a woman cannot refuse her
[1:47:10] husband just like the church cannot uh
[1:47:16] refuse but
[1:47:18] Christ the husb of the church has the
[1:47:21] power to Exel the
[1:47:25] church exactly how the man has the power
[1:47:27] to put away his
[1:47:31] wife I know what I'm talking
[1:47:35] about I'm not telling people to go put
[1:47:37] away their
[1:47:40] wives because there are conditions to do
[1:47:44] it you don't just wake up in the morning
[1:47:47] and just say I put her away no you
[1:47:49] cannot say
[1:47:51] you got to ask the
[1:47:55] p and he will tell you what God helped
[1:47:58] him to
[1:47:59] understand and he will tell you his
[1:48:01] position and how
[1:48:02] he and if you're right he'll tell you
[1:48:05] you are
[1:48:07] right if he also understands things the
[1:48:09] same way you
[1:48:11] do because this is not my church I'm not
[1:48:14] the pastor of this
[1:48:16] church the pastor of this church is
[1:48:19] brother
[1:48:21] but because we're talking about
[1:48:22] Disobedience of
[1:48:25] vas which uh to be
[1:48:30] put so a church that does not obey the
[1:48:34] word she will also
[1:48:37] be because Christ is the spiritual
[1:48:39] husband of the
[1:48:42] church so your s examine your own
[1:48:47] conscience and look for every principle
[1:48:49] of
[1:48:51] look
[1:48:54] every are you obedient to every
[1:48:56] principle of the
[1:48:58] word if you're not
[1:49:00] Obed God God is going to put you
[1:49:04] away the power and the to put you
[1:49:09] away but you cannot put him
[1:49:17] away you said a man can put away his
[1:49:23] but the woman cannot pull her
[1:49:25] husand and marry another
[1:49:27] one see
[1:49:29] all see all the shadows and
[1:49:33] types they are perfectly
[1:49:37] balanced see the original
[1:49:40] creation not the
[1:49:42] byproduct no where not the
[1:49:47] church the brides through the word
[1:49:52] not the woman the man each
[1:50:02] time that's why it never says anything
[1:50:05] against the man doing it it's always the
[1:50:07] woman that's
[1:50:09] exactly my brothers and sister I'm going
[1:50:11] to close by saying this so that we must
[1:50:15] understand that what motivated my spirit
[1:50:17] to speak about
[1:50:19] it
[1:50:21] I got inspired by the life of
[1:50:24] queen as we you
[1:50:29] heard it was very plain that even the
[1:50:31] little kids understood what he was
[1:50:34] talking that the Disobedience of her
[1:50:37] wife she was the first
[1:50:41] wife her Disobedience caused her to be
[1:50:44] put
[1:50:47] away while she was supposed to show a
[1:50:49] again said a good
[1:50:51] example she said a bad
[1:50:53] example and she was
[1:50:56] rejected and the King had
[1:51:00] to of another person where to take the
[1:51:02] place
[1:51:03] of and have the Royal
[1:51:06] Crown God also
[1:51:10] today he needs Believers and Christians
[1:51:15] Obed who when God needs
[1:51:18] them when God tells them to do this
[1:51:21] thing or
[1:51:22] that they do it with a good heart they
[1:51:26] do it with all their
[1:51:27] heart God needs that type of a Christian
[1:51:30] of a
[1:51:31] Believer a
[1:51:34] Believer my brothers and
[1:51:36] sister we may
[1:51:39] stand let's examine our
[1:51:43] conscience where we have not been
[1:51:46] Obed that we may ask God this morning
[1:51:50] Lord
[1:51:51] God I know I have not been
[1:51:55] Obed I have not obeyed the whole
[1:51:58] word I need you to forgive
[1:52:01] me I need you to have mercy on
[1:52:04] me to give me another
[1:52:08] chance so that I may go for you
[1:52:11] again that I may have another
[1:52:14] chance to do the
[1:52:17] word because I want to be in Obed

[1:52:23] wife I want to be an obedient
[1:52:27] husband that's what we

[1:59:19] according to what you
[1:59:22] heard let's
[1:59:48] pray
[2:00:18] J
[2:00:48] h
[2:01:03] we we're going to
[2:01:06] pray dear heavenly
[2:01:12] father with so much
[2:01:16] respect and reverently coming before
[2:01:22] you after hearing this
[2:01:28] message where you showed us that you
[2:01:30] need an obedient
[2:01:33] Church in obedient
[2:01:39] church that observes every principle
[2:01:42] every commandment of your
[2:01:46] word Lord when we examine our conscience
[2:01:51] we cannot say that we do not have
[2:01:55] sin because if we say that we do not
[2:01:57] have
[2:01:58] SE then we are
[2:02:03] liars and your word says that let every
[2:02:06] man's word be a
[2:02:09] lie only the word of God can be
[2:02:12] recognized is the
[2:02:15] truth dear merciful
[2:02:17] father
[2:02:20] even as small as the sin no matter how
[2:02:24] small the sin that we
[2:02:26] committed but there's still one
[2:02:31] scene and you do not need a church that
[2:02:34] continuously seen and
[2:02:37] seen you need an obedient
[2:02:40] church because when the church is
[2:02:45] obedient then shees all the blessings of
[2:02:48] God
[2:02:51] she has all the redemp Redemptive
[2:02:57] blessings each moment she's going to cry
[2:03:00] to you in her
[2:03:02] difficulty because she's an obedient
[2:03:05] Church you will hear that that
[2:03:08] prayer because you said in your
[2:03:13] word that if my people who are called by
[2:03:16] my name get together and they pray
[2:03:20] me God I will answer from
[2:03:23] Heaven Lord here we are a
[2:03:27] church certainly we have
[2:03:31] needs we have
[2:03:34] difficulties so how can you respond
[2:03:38] us if you say that we're not
[2:03:41] obedient so our prayer this
[2:03:45] morning forgive us for
[2:03:47] our
[2:03:50] that you forgive our
[2:03:52] shortcomings that you forgive our
[2:03:56] transgressions align according to your
[2:04:00] word that we may become Spirit of your
[2:04:03] spirit word of your
[2:04:07] word we may observe every commandment of
[2:04:10] your
[2:04:10] word oh Heavenly
[2:04:13] Father our prayer this
[2:04:16] morning is that when we look at
[2:04:20] past when we look at our
[2:04:23] history there are certainly things that
[2:04:26] we certainly bad
[2:04:29] things but your spirit this
[2:04:33] morning want us to be in obedient
[2:04:36] Church forgive our past
[2:04:41] Lord and help us to have a future
[2:04:47] to to future
[2:04:51] so so that we may be this
[2:04:54] church that does not have limits in
[2:04:57] your so that we but in order for us to
[2:04:59] get
[2:05:01] there we need to be
[2:05:03] obedient so forgive each one of
[2:05:06] us we commit ourselves to we give you
[2:05:10] our
[2:05:12] hearts when we can think about this
[2:05:16] nation it's a nation that you chose
[2:05:18] yourself
[2:05:20] when they were with you at the
