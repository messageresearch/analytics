[38:36] sometimes we forget
[38:39] how late in the day it is
[38:44] there are things that we must do
[38:48] things that we must come into
[38:52] I remember the last service that we
[38:54] preach
[38:56] I made a statement that
[38:58] brother Branham said if you don't come
[39:00] into the Shekinah Glory you won't make
[39:03] the Rapture well he did not say it
[39:06] exactly that way
[39:08] but all of us should understand that we
[39:11] must come into perfection
[39:13] and this Perfection can only be obtained
[39:16] by way of this message and that is
[39:18] through Christ
[39:20] because Christ Jesus is the message of
[39:22] the hour
[39:25] so we want you just to listen and you
[39:27] know you don't even have to say Amen
[39:29] tonight if you don't feel led to but if
[39:31] you feel led to say Amen
[39:33] John 9 30-34
[39:37] the man answered and said unto them
[39:41] why herein is a marvelous thing
[39:45] that ye know not from whence he is
[39:50] and yet he have opened mine eyes
[39:54] now we know that God heareth not sinners
[40:00] but if any man be a worshiper of God
[40:03] listen to the word he says but if any
[40:06] man be a worshiper of God
[40:09] and doeth his will him he heareth
[40:14] since the world began was it not heard
[40:16] that any man opened the eyes of one that
[40:20] was born blind
[40:22] if this man were not of God he could do
[40:26] nothing
[40:28] they answered and said it to him
[40:31] doubt was altogether born in sin
[40:36] and thus thou teach us
[40:38] and they cast him out 35th verse of the
[40:42] same chapter
[40:44] Jesus heard that they had cast him out
[40:48] and when he had found him he said unto
[40:52] him does thou believe on the son of God
[40:56] and he answered and said who is he Lord
[40:59] that I might believe on him
[41:03] and Jesus said unto him thou Hast but
[41:08] see seeing him
[41:09] and it is he that talketh with thee
[41:13] and he said Lord I believe and he
[41:16] worshiped him I like that
[41:20] Hebrews 13 and 8.
[41:22] says Jesus Christ
[41:25] the same
[41:26] yesterday and today
[41:30] and forever
[41:32] let us pray
[41:34] our gracious father we come
[41:38] as lowly and as humble humble as we know
[41:41] how
[41:43] we realize Lord Jesus that this desk is
[41:46] a sacred desk
[41:48] and every time I stand behind it O Lord
[41:51] I Feel So Unworthy
[41:55] my worthiness come from you
[41:58] because you've made it so
[42:01] you said in your word that you became my
[42:03] sin that I might become your
[42:05] righteousness
[42:07] and as I stand in this Pulpit I receive
[42:11] your righteousness
[42:13] father bless the service bless the hero
[42:16] make us all doers of the word
[42:20] and Lord God we thank you Father because
[42:22] we know that you hear us
[42:24] because your word says even before we
[42:27] speak
[42:28] you have heard
[42:30] and Lord Jesus I thank you Father for
[42:32] giving us Grace
[42:34] to make us a tabernacle of God
[42:38] let your word be spoken tonight
[42:42] Quicken it to our hearts
[42:44] that we may live better Christian lives
[42:48] in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray
[42:51] amen you may be seated
[42:55] I was discussing today
[42:59] with brother Craig Bohr
[43:03] and he and I was like on one Accord as
[43:06] as if we could
[43:07] finish each other's statement
[43:10] when we were talking
[43:14] and he has the same thirst for God
[43:18] the yearning for perfection
[43:22] he's doing fine he and his family there
[43:24] in Connecticut
[43:27] but he is somewhat like I am his church
[43:31] is pretty much isolated from all of the
[43:33] other groups
[43:34] but he likes it that way and so do I
[43:40] one of the things that I do note
[43:44] is that God is moving on individual
[43:46] hearts
[43:48] in such a mighty way and it's not
[43:50] visible to
[43:52] most of the people
[43:55] but For Those whom God is moving in and
[43:58] dealing with they know
[44:00] that the day of translation is nearer
[44:03] now than it's ever been
[44:05] we can't explain what we feel like the
[44:08] animals when they know danger is coming
[44:11] and they began to move into a safe place
[44:15] of shelter
[44:17] and this is what True Believers are
[44:19] feeling now
[44:21] we know it's falling apart this world
[44:23] and we're now moving
[44:26] I mean of course it is according to the
[44:28] scripture
[44:29] the Bible says once the vision has been
[44:31] made plain let him that readeth run
[44:35] and you know we have a great adversary
[44:39] not giving praise to the devil
[44:42] but God made him
[44:44] a real adversary
[44:46] and his duty is to distract us
[44:50] and to keep us from focusing
[44:53] and and to keep us from recognizing the
[44:57] purpose for which we came in this hour
[45:00] God could have left us out on the street
[45:02] he could have left us in denominational
[45:04] churches and organization but he pulled
[45:07] us out for a specific means and that
[45:11] purpose amen must be fulfilled
[45:14] uh you've got to understand by God's
[45:16] grace that God will anoint those who are
[45:20] according to his purpose
[45:23] anoint them to do what he wants them to
[45:27] do
[45:28] it's not a jumping and a shouting but
[45:31] it's such an inspiration
[45:34] that you know that you know that you
[45:36] know that you must do what you need to
[45:38] do
[45:40] one thing about genuine Eagles
[45:45] of this day they know
[45:48] the thing that's right
[45:51] we understand that we can't do anything
[45:54] of ourselves
[45:56] but we know the power uh behind the word
[46:01] that can make us perform the word
[46:06] you and I must understand that in this
[46:08] day we must recognize that we're not
[46:11] just Pentecostals but we're Pentecostals
[46:13] Plus
[46:15] we are in addition to what they have and
[46:19] and that has it can't be just verbalized
[46:22] it must be manifested materialized
[46:27] and the only way that can be done is
[46:29] that God find favor
[46:32] and began to vindicate himself in you
[46:37] only faith can produce
[46:39] the promises of the word
[46:43] if you read in the book of Hebrew I
[46:46] believe it's the 11th chapter we call it
[46:48] the book of faith
[46:50] you find out that all the Patriots of
[46:52] the Old Testament was anointed by faith
[46:56] they achieved everything they did by
[46:59] faith
[47:00] and Faith as you have heard me say is
[47:03] not a thing is a person
[47:06] it's a revelation
[47:08] right remember I just read to you the
[47:11] scripture
[47:12] about the man who was born blind never
[47:16] had at sight and never never had a
[47:19] vision of any kind born that way for 30
[47:22] years
[47:23] and according to the Jewish Customs or
[47:26] the way they thought their processes if
[47:29] someone was born like that or crippled
[47:32] or maimed in some way they believed that
[47:36] it was some generational curse or sin
[47:39] that caused that person to be like that
[47:43] and so they even asked Jesus who did Sin
[47:46] whether it was the mother or the father
[47:48] who did Sin and Jesus says neither
[47:51] neither of these men uh people sin but
[47:56] all of this was done for the glory of
[48:00] God can you imagine
[48:03] God allowing a man to be born
[48:06] 30 years he suffered blindness
[48:10] for God's glory
[48:13] it doesn't make sense to the Natural man
[48:17] but you see God is not concerned about
[48:20] what makes sense to you
[48:22] everything he does is for his own Glory
[48:25] and his own pleasure
[48:27] and so you say well what about Calvary I
[48:31] still think about Calvary and I wondered
[48:33] you know to me it is such a a a awesome
[48:39] strategy
[48:40] that God used against his adversary
[48:44] God himself come down like a trojan
[48:47] horse hidden in Jesus Christ
[48:50] and Satan himself was confused in all of
[48:53] his followers confused was confused
[48:55] because the Bible said if they had only
[48:57] knew and had only known that this Jesus
[49:01] Christ was God they would never have
[49:03] crucified him
[49:05] but he looked like he died he looked as
[49:08] if he died a loser
[49:11] but he was not a loser
[49:13] he was a winner
[49:16] and he still today is a winner
[49:19] and oftentimes God does things that we
[49:22] in our little Minds can't understand and
[49:25] we often question and say why
[49:29] the truth of the matter is why not
[49:35] we didn't make ourselves
[49:37] he made us
[49:39] and we ought to be glad to be able to
[49:41] experience life because you know what we
[49:43] don't know what life really is
[49:46] I think about dogs I think about cats
[49:50] I think about birds and all the creation
[49:52] of God that those animals that that just
[49:55] do not have souls
[49:58] but you'll never see them complaining
[50:02] a dog knows his master
[50:05] and he knows he loves that Master in
[50:08] spite of all of the abuse he may obtain
[50:11] from that Master that dog still loves
[50:14] that Master
[50:16] but when it comes to mankind
[50:19] we don't appreciate God who is our
[50:22] master
[50:23] we think sometimes he's made a mistake
[50:27] but God never makes mistakes
[50:31] but one thing I do love about God
[50:34] the master plan of Calvary I say it now
[50:37] I might say two things then is that God
[50:40] hid himself within a seed
[50:44] he planted the seeds before the
[50:46] foundation of the world and now we have
[50:48] come to harvest time
[50:50] and these seeds are now being anointed
[50:53] to be manifested
[50:56] these seeds in itself were seeds of
[50:59] faith
[51:02] and these Faith seeds are now coming to
[51:04] a place where they are beginning to see
[51:07] who they are and what they are
[51:11] you think about the trees or every seed
[51:13] that is planted
[51:15] I'm sure the the apple seed doesn't say
[51:18] while it's still a seed I'm an apple
[51:20] seed but once it's planted and began to
[51:23] grow and nature began to nurture it and
[51:25] bring it up and it begins to see what it
[51:28] is it begins to perform duties that it
[51:31] didn't even know you know he had the
[51:33] ability to do
[51:36] I mean think about it
[51:38] all of those seeds
[51:41] in one apple
[51:44] that's going to spread the generation of
[51:46] apples
[51:47] for Everlasting
[51:50] now I want to come to a place to say as
[51:53] I said early only faith can produce the
[51:55] promises of the word
[51:58] faith is a gift you know
[52:00] it's a gift from God
[52:03] it is a revelation
[52:06] something that God gives you
[52:10] that's personal
[52:12] he may not give it to no one else
[52:15] but when you see it it becomes a vision
[52:18] of a sight to you like a sixth sense you
[52:21] can see it when nobody else can see it
[52:24] you think about the man forward and and
[52:26] all of the other inventors you know
[52:29] they'd invented uh you know cars and
[52:32] electricity and all they discovered it
[52:34] they didn't invent it it was always
[52:36] there
[52:37] but God used him in the science field
[52:40] and and when they were trying to bring
[52:42] these things into a place of sight
[52:45] because it wasn't visible
[52:47] it was only visible to the man it's like
[52:49] an artist who was able to paint a
[52:52] painting because he sees a vision of
[52:54] something and and he knows how to put it
[52:56] on the canvas and but while it's in his
[52:58] head you can't see it
[53:00] but once he places on the on the canvas
[53:03] you begin to see oh ah that's wonderful
[53:06] and you think wow this God this this man
[53:09] is great no no no no
[53:11] the inspiration that gave him the vision
[53:15] is the great one
[53:17] he's just an instrument
[53:19] that God is placed in this dimension for
[53:22] you to see and to enjoy
[53:27] because every good and perfect gift
[53:30] comes from God
[53:35] the prophet God said
[53:38] the genuine Faith seed because the word
[53:42] of God Is by faith and he gives to
[53:44] Abraham now how many of us could have
[53:47] done what Abraham did
[53:50] Abraham didn't even know where he was
[53:53] going
[53:54] but the voice or the vision however God
[53:57] dealt with him he realized it was God
[54:01] he came from a place like India that had
[54:04] thousands of different gods and which
[54:07] one you know the the cow or the the
[54:10] elephant or the monkey or the whatever
[54:13] but when he heard from God
[54:16] he knew it was God
[54:18] he didn't have anything tangible he
[54:22] didn't have an image
[54:23] the only thing he had was the
[54:25] inspiration
[54:27] had not even met him yet
[54:30] per se as a person
[54:32] but he was able to follow God by that
[54:35] inspiration you know
[54:37] and the Bible says as Abraham began to
[54:40] walk and begin to talk with God then God
[54:43] at some point in time made himself
[54:44] visible
[54:46] but the thing that God spoke
[54:50] one thing about Abraham he knew the
[54:53] voice of God
[54:56] faith is something that's revealed to
[54:58] you
[54:59] that is not yet but you believe it will
[55:02] be faith is a revelation of the will of
[55:06] God
[55:07] now see that's what I'm saying that's
[55:10] the only way that you can see yourself
[55:11] as being bride it must be a revelation
[55:14] to you that's revealed to you that you
[55:17] abide you can't even explain it
[55:20] but something deep down in your soul
[55:24] testifies I'm pride in spite of all the
[55:29] mistakes
[55:31] because even as bride we have to grow
[55:34] and mature into a perfect man
[55:37] it just doesn't happen overnight which
[55:39] most of us wish it would have but God
[55:42] gets Glory
[55:44] and all of the things that he's doing
[55:47] listen but to the church
[55:50] even the rapture
[55:51] is a revelation to her
[55:55] it's revealed to her now I'm going to
[55:59] Simply say it like this
[56:01] the Rapture in its Simplicity is Christ
[56:06] in you
[56:08] because at the at the at the at the uh
[56:12] uh Lazarus
[56:14] tomb Jesus said to Mary and Martha I am
[56:18] the resurrection
[56:20] and I am the life
[56:23] and this is why the devil do not want
[56:25] people to get the Holy Ghost he doesn't
[56:27] mind if you get religious
[56:30] he doesn't even mind if if you you you
[56:33] pay your tithes if you shout if you
[56:36] dance
[56:37] speak in tongues whatever you want to do
[56:39] all of those things are great but listen
[56:42] the thing that you must know that you
[56:45] know that you know is that you've been
[56:47] born again
[56:50] and even then when you're first born
[56:52] again you just started the journey
[56:56] this is a place of maturing a place of
[56:58] growing up a time for mistakes a time
[57:02] for asking for forgiveness you know a
[57:04] lot of times people believe that in
[57:06] Romans 10 9 he says you know if a man
[57:08] confessed with his mouth and believe
[57:10] with his heart you know that he's you
[57:13] know uh uh passed from death and to life
[57:16] but let me tell you something you know
[57:17] what comes before that repentance
[57:21] you've got to repent you can confess
[57:24] that with all your mouth your mind body
[57:27] and soul but if you haven't repent if
[57:30] you haven't come to a place where you
[57:32] will regret and you ask God to forgive
[57:34] you you see your sins you see your
[57:37] ugliness you see how filthy and uh
[57:40] undeserving you are your confession
[57:43] means nothing
[57:46] faith is a revelation so is Jesus Christ
[57:50] now he was a man born blind 30 years
[57:52] perhaps because he was going he was a
[57:54] church member you know did y'all know
[57:56] that in the church 30 years born blind
[57:58] that's him that's a symbol of something
[58:00] symbolic of something
[58:02] people can go 30 years
[58:06] serving God in the best they know how
[58:09] and still be blind
[58:13] and then Jesus came listen listen what
[58:16] did Jesus what did you Jesus did he
[58:18] opened his eyes
[58:20] in a slow process
[58:23] Jesus could say Be Thy healed and it
[58:25] would have happened
[58:27] but he mixed mud he mixed dirt and spit
[58:30] erupted into man's eye that means you
[58:33] know it needed some work but you know
[58:35] his sight needed some working
[58:37] and he worked on that man's eye told him
[58:39] to go wash in the pool of Salah and he
[58:42] did
[58:43] the first he didn't see just right
[58:45] second he you know he saw things and
[58:47] that's what happened we we began to see
[58:49] men like trees your sight is not perfect
[58:51] yet
[59:02] there's a church it's Christ Jesus
[59:04] himself
[59:07] and all Jesus said go show yourself to
[59:10] the priest
[59:11] and he goes to show himself to the
[59:13] priests and they they because of their
[59:16] jealousy because of their envy and
[59:18] things they began to just you know
[59:20] ridicule the man and this man I love him
[59:23] I like to shake his hand once they get
[59:25] there
[59:26] I love the way he outsmarted those
[59:28] Pharisees and doctors of divinity
[59:31] because they wanted to liken his healing
[59:34] as as something evil because it was done
[59:37] on the Sabbath day and then it was by
[59:39] Jesus who was supposedly being born by
[59:42] fornication you know it's amazing how
[59:45] God can still do things today and people
[59:48] are still call it the devil
[59:51] they'll see a man who was a drunkard a
[59:54] prostitute or a whoremonger murderer
[59:57] whatever he was there see him change and
[1:00:00] then liking his changes being evil
[1:00:03] because of the church he goes to
[1:00:07] because his church believed in the
[1:00:08] Supernatural
[1:00:11] because his church believed that Jesus
[1:00:13] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:00:15] forever
[1:00:19] it is a revelation
[1:00:23] father Revelation is faith
[1:00:26] you cannot have a revelation well
[1:00:28] without it being faith
[1:00:31] faith is a revelation because it's
[1:00:33] something that's revealed to you
[1:00:35] faith is a revelation faith is something
[1:00:38] that has been revealed to you like it
[1:00:40] was to Abraham
[1:00:42] that could call anything contrary to
[1:00:45] what had been revealed to him as
[1:00:47] Hallelujah glory to God as though it was
[1:00:51] it wasn't so
[1:00:53] see once it's revealed you gotta you
[1:00:55] gotta you gotta speak against it
[1:00:57] anything that's contrary to your
[1:01:00] Revelation you've got to speak against
[1:01:02] it because it's not of God
[1:01:07] um
[1:01:08] y'all looking at me like I'm crazy
[1:01:10] but let me say
[1:01:14] you
[1:01:15] you to believe
[1:01:16] bride
[1:01:17] and that Revelation is contrary
[1:01:20] to all of your five senses
[1:01:24] because your five senses will declare
[1:01:27] that you are a sinner
[1:01:29] your five senses will declare that
[1:01:32] you're still lost
[1:01:34] your fives that's why you must die and
[1:01:38] rot
[1:01:40] to yourself
[1:01:43] the church is built upon Revelation I'm
[1:01:46] coming
[1:01:48] built upon it
[1:01:51] let me say it like that did you realize
[1:01:52] what Jesus said he said I am the thine
[1:01:55] and you are the branches
[1:01:58] and you can't do nothing without me
[1:02:01] showing
[1:02:03] telling you
[1:02:05] the life that's in you must
[1:02:07] come from the Vine
[1:02:10] and that's Jesus Christ
[1:02:12] right
[1:02:13] see there's where I want to stay faith
[1:02:16] is a revelation there's just a moment it
[1:02:19] is a revelation he has revealed it to
[1:02:21] you by what his grace oh I deserve it no
[1:02:24] it's his grace
[1:02:27] Abraham was among the idolaters
[1:02:31] and God by Grace not that Abraham was a
[1:02:35] Godly Man or not that Abraham was
[1:02:38] something better than anybody else no
[1:02:40] God chose him gave him Grace and Abraham
[1:02:43] followed God that's how it is
[1:02:47] you think you're better than somebody
[1:02:49] else
[1:02:50] the Bible said we all have sinned and
[1:02:53] come short of the glory of God
[1:02:55] in the Book of Revelation they said none
[1:02:57] was worthy to open the book or to lose
[1:03:01] to seals thereof
[1:03:02] Peter Paul John James you name him
[1:03:05] Abraham Moses none not one there was
[1:03:09] only one man and that was Jesus Christ
[1:03:14] the only one still is and always will be
[1:03:20] but we look at
[1:03:26] Us in the book of Acts 16 through 2 2
[1:03:28] through 16 he says but this is that
[1:03:31] which was spoken by the prophet Joel see
[1:03:34] the word must identify you
[1:03:39] and the identification comes by proof
[1:03:43] by Vindication is evident this is it
[1:03:47] on the day of Pentecost when the power
[1:03:50] of God fell it was Peter that stood up
[1:03:54] and he is the one that says this is that
[1:03:58] which was spoken by the prophet Joel
[1:04:01] he was able to go into the Old Testament
[1:04:04] and pull it into the new and said these
[1:04:07] things that you call insane and crazy
[1:04:09] God is manifesting it right now in your
[1:04:13] eyes
[1:04:15] and it should come to pass in the last
[1:04:17] day say God I will pour out my spirit
[1:04:19] upon All Flesh and your sons and your
[1:04:21] daughters shall prophesy and your young
[1:04:23] men shall see visions and your old men
[1:04:25] shall dream dreams let me tell y'all
[1:04:28] something
[1:04:29] that scripture is still alive
[1:04:32] but you know what kills it
[1:04:35] traditions of men
[1:04:38] and every time
[1:04:53] you say well the Lord show me this and
[1:04:55] the Lord told me that and he did and he
[1:04:57] did show them that but now people are so
[1:05:00] afraid to identify the voice that they
[1:05:03] hear and the Revelation that God gives
[1:05:06] them throughout the day they are afraid
[1:05:08] because they feel like they're going to
[1:05:10] be criticized when you know that is God
[1:05:14] you don't have to fear no man
[1:05:17] speak it that's why I testify do you
[1:05:21] know why I tell my testimonies because I
[1:05:23] used to be one of them
[1:05:24] afraid to testify because people was
[1:05:27] going to think that I was trying to be
[1:05:29] something
[1:05:30] and our sister Karen God gave her a word
[1:05:33] from the Lord and she gave me the word
[1:05:37] from the Lord and told God was
[1:05:38] displeased with me and told me not to do
[1:05:41] that anymore when he moves me to testify
[1:05:44] testify whether the people like it or
[1:05:47] not
[1:05:48] and from that time on I've been telling
[1:05:51] everybody about what God has done for me
[1:05:57] because I knew she was a spiritual
[1:05:58] sister and I knew what she said was from
[1:06:01] God
[1:06:02] ooh a sister absolutely
[1:06:08] president said Pentecost there is where
[1:06:11] you failed you thought because you were
[1:06:14] born of the spirit born of the spirit
[1:06:16] the birthright that settled it but it
[1:06:20] only starred it remember in the message
[1:06:23] hear ye hear him how that the child
[1:06:25] after he was born in the family becomes
[1:06:27] a son and if it had rights to be to the
[1:06:31] birthright but it had to be proven
[1:06:35] see that's what people don't understand
[1:06:36] oh I'm in the message I follow the
[1:06:38] prophet of God Malachi 4 you know
[1:06:41] Revelation 10
[1:06:42] . that ain't it
[1:06:45] that's just the words
[1:06:47] vindicating that God has done something
[1:06:51] you got to prove that your seed
[1:06:55] it must be proven
[1:06:57] and the only way that that could ever
[1:06:59] happen is that you've got to be you've
[1:07:02] got to come in contact with the
[1:07:04] quickening power
[1:07:06] the seed must be quickened
[1:07:11] it ain't difficult
[1:07:13] the difficult part is that we are too
[1:07:16] proud
[1:07:18] we're arrogant
[1:07:20] we're too proud to just get there and
[1:07:22] wallow till we get it whatever it takes
[1:07:25] some may have to do that some may not
[1:07:27] have to but the point is you do not stop
[1:07:32] you can't stop until you God comes down
[1:07:34] and Vindicated that you have been a
[1:07:36] proper son or a proper daughter
[1:07:39] it's foolish to start the race
[1:07:43] and yet you didn't count the costs
[1:07:47] it's a great cause
[1:07:49] and you and I got to we must and listen
[1:07:52] you got to love the unlovable
[1:07:55] you got to love those that despitefully
[1:07:57] use you got to bless them
[1:07:59] you got to do everything Jesus said you
[1:08:02] must be a lamb and the only way you can
[1:08:04] be a lamb is that the Lamb of God is
[1:08:06] living inside of you
[1:08:08] it ought to put a desperation on our
[1:08:10] souls
[1:08:12] we ought to be a desperate people trying
[1:08:15] to move into that Veil and not yet come
[1:08:18] and not never to come out
[1:08:20] we ought to be pressing into it right
[1:08:23] because that's what brother random said
[1:08:25] he said it was death
[1:08:27] one time to go in
[1:08:29] but now it's death
[1:08:32] to stay out
[1:08:36] um
[1:08:37] and God is trying to get us there but
[1:08:39] you know what we're so busy you know it
[1:08:42] I'm talking about myself from the pulpit
[1:08:44] back to the door we allow Satan to be
[1:08:47] make us so busy and we're so distracted
[1:08:49] with all of these carnal things in your
[1:08:52] soul is at stake
[1:08:56] is all about me it ain't all about you
[1:08:59] it's about him
[1:09:04] Hallelujah
[1:09:06] see you had a right
[1:09:08] and after it was born talking about the
[1:09:10] child into the family becomes a son it
[1:09:13] had rights to be the birth to the
[1:09:15] birthright but it had to be proven child
[1:09:19] trained y'all know what that is don't do
[1:09:22] this don't do that you know no no no
[1:09:24] this is wrong this is right God in his
[1:09:26] leadership training us how to be what
[1:09:29] Kings and Priests
[1:09:32] training and those Priests of the Old
[1:09:35] Testament they were born into the
[1:09:37] Leviticus priesthood and they had to be
[1:09:39] trained they didn't say okay you you're
[1:09:41] born a Levi just go in there and figure
[1:09:43] it out no they had to be trained they
[1:09:46] had to know all of the order of the word
[1:09:48] and what to do and what not to do on
[1:09:50] various days we don't have to do that
[1:09:52] but one thing for certain we must it is
[1:09:56] a must that the Holy Spirit occupies the
[1:09:59] temple
[1:10:02] people of God
[1:10:03] I fight every day
[1:10:07] seemingly all day
[1:10:10] some battles I win and some battles I
[1:10:13] lose
[1:10:14] but one thing for certain my vision is
[1:10:16] clear
[1:10:17] I know where I'm headed
[1:10:19] and I'm going I'll know the Finishing
[1:10:22] Line when I cross it
[1:10:26] Hallelujah
[1:10:28] hear you him right
[1:10:30] it has to be proven
[1:10:33] an obedient child to the father will
[1:10:35] then it must be well it did not get the
[1:10:39] because see it become heirs it's air it
[1:10:42] aired nothing without obedience you air
[1:10:45] nothing it doesn't take away from you
[1:10:46] being a son but then over there you own
[1:10:49] nothing you're not the heir of nothing
[1:10:53] yet it was a son
[1:10:55] but he aired nothing if he wasn't
[1:10:57] interested in the father's work
[1:11:01] and that's the problem
[1:11:03] we ought to be about our father's
[1:11:05] business
[1:11:07] and so when the Holy Ghost fell upon the
[1:11:09] uh the Pentecostal people and they began
[1:11:11] to restore back the gifts and things
[1:11:13] that was in the church they thought
[1:11:15] because they were born of the spirit
[1:11:17] that settled it but but you see there is
[1:11:20] a placing of a son and after this son
[1:11:22] proved to be a real son then he was
[1:11:25] taken into the public place then was set
[1:11:28] up and changed robes and set up there
[1:11:32] and then there was a placing of the Sun
[1:11:34] that he had had the air of everything
[1:11:36] the father had and that's what people
[1:11:38] don't understand we're in trial child
[1:11:40] training and we say potentially we are
[1:11:43] joined as potentially we own everything
[1:11:46] he he owns but he'll never hand his
[1:11:50] business over to you until you come to
[1:11:52] that place of maturity
[1:11:55] look what Pentecost did with those
[1:11:57] little gifts that he gave them
[1:12:00] people are so backslid now don't think
[1:12:03] nothing about it
[1:12:04] handle it like it's their gift
[1:12:08] Hallelujah there are two spirits in the
[1:12:11] last days
[1:12:12] the church spirit
[1:12:14] of the church people and the bride
[1:12:17] Spirit of the Bride people would be so
[1:12:20] close together till it would deceive the
[1:12:23] very elected if it was possible
[1:12:26] that's how close
[1:12:30] my thing is then
[1:12:32] Peter said this is that
[1:12:35] that was spoken by Prophet Joel
[1:12:38] where is the man where is the woman that
[1:12:40] could say this is that that was spoken
[1:12:43] by Malachi 4.
[1:12:46] by the prophet William Branham
[1:12:49] where is the man where is the woman
[1:12:53] because what we're doing
[1:12:56] just doesn't look like this is that
[1:13:01] oh we got the word
[1:13:04] what we fail to see is that brother
[1:13:06] branham's sowed seeds
[1:13:09] and we took the word of God in his seed
[1:13:11] form and said we got it it's all week we
[1:13:15] got it all
[1:13:20] of being a tree
[1:13:21] we don't want just a seed we want the
[1:13:24] tree
[1:13:25] we want the tree we want the fruits we
[1:13:27] want everything the message is supposed
[1:13:28] to bring forth we want to be able to say
[1:13:31] I and the father are one
[1:13:36] we want to see it
[1:13:39] I want to see it and I'm not going to
[1:13:42] quit
[1:13:46] no turning back for me
[1:13:53] oh but then come
[1:13:55] the Pentecostals the restoration of the
[1:13:58] gifts speaking in tongues they call it
[1:14:00] the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:01] speaking in tongues there they called
[1:14:04] the initial evidence which brought forth
[1:14:06] what the shock but they denominated but
[1:14:10] when you come to say I and my father are
[1:14:14] one and these are the things then the
[1:14:16] shock pulls away from it see what are
[1:14:20] you saying there's a position
[1:14:23] a purpose for this message is to bring
[1:14:26] his bride to a place where she can
[1:14:28] declare I and my father are one
[1:14:31] Saint John 10 30 the same thing Jesus
[1:14:34] said
[1:14:36] and Jesus prayed in Saint John 17 father
[1:14:39] I word that there be one even as We Are
[1:14:42] One
[1:14:43] oh my God it's so it's so difficult
[1:14:45] people if you don't humble your minds
[1:14:48] and your thoughts right now you're gonna
[1:14:50] miss what God is trying to say let me
[1:14:52] tell you like this this is Grace
[1:14:55] this is the grace of God
[1:14:57] because God has given us instructions
[1:15:00] and the word of God said if you draw
[1:15:02] nigh to God He will draw nigh to you
[1:15:05] but you got to draw not to him
[1:15:09] he's the king
[1:15:10] we're the queen
[1:15:13] but when you come to say I my father one
[1:15:15] and these things then the shuck pulls
[1:15:18] away from it but the real genuine bride
[1:15:21] church will bring forth the entire word
[1:15:24] of God in his fullness and in his
[1:15:28] strength for he's the same yesterday
[1:15:31] today and forever that's all I'm saying
[1:15:34] there's a genuine bride
[1:15:37] and I'm part of her
[1:15:39] notice in the womb of Mary was the seed
[1:15:41] but when the seed was delivered it said
[1:15:44] I come to do the will of him that sent
[1:15:47] me
[1:15:49] I and my father are one
[1:15:53] if I do not his works there you go
[1:15:56] see it's not say oh I'm bride I'm bride
[1:15:58] where are the works
[1:16:01] Believe Me Not
[1:16:03] there was he says if I don't do what is
[1:16:06] what the scripture says I'm supposed to
[1:16:08] do you don't have to believe me
[1:16:10] but here the word of God tells us in our
[1:16:13] day this is why you got to understand
[1:16:15] brother Benjamin's message on the
[1:16:16] message that was sent by God through him
[1:16:18] and and you got to understand what he's
[1:16:21] doing he pulled we pulled away from the
[1:16:24] shock so if we pulled away from the shop
[1:16:26] there's a message for us there's a word
[1:16:28] for us that the shock can't see or
[1:16:31] perceive
[1:16:33] it's beyond all of the the the the the
[1:16:35] the the pleasures and the shouting and
[1:16:37] the dancing God want to see maturity
[1:16:41] he wants to see real sons and daughters
[1:16:43] of God
[1:16:46] that's been that'll be able to say I
[1:16:49] come to do my father not my will I come
[1:16:50] to do his will and that's the problem
[1:16:53] we're doing all of our wills and we're
[1:16:55] not even thinking about what his will is
[1:16:58] I do not his his works if I do not his
[1:17:01] Works believe me not there was to see
[1:17:04] which one of you can condemn me of
[1:17:07] unbelief huh he says listen I stay with
[1:17:09] the word so well it manifested itself it
[1:17:13] Vindicated itself
[1:17:15] that's what Jesus said even to the blind
[1:17:17] man he said listen
[1:17:19] I'm looking for him where is he he said
[1:17:21] I'm the one talking to you
[1:17:25] and the Bible said that that the man
[1:17:28] because he was the evidence he was the
[1:17:31] proof
[1:17:32] he had already preached the message to
[1:17:35] the Pharisees and the Sadducees you've
[1:17:37] never seen in the history of Israel a
[1:17:40] man born blind receiving his sight and
[1:17:43] you say this man is of the devil and I
[1:17:46] say the word says no man who is evil can
[1:17:50] do this this man who did open my eyes he
[1:17:54] has to be sent from God and then when
[1:17:56] God Jesus Christ opened this man's eye
[1:18:00] naturally he didn't leave them closed
[1:18:02] spiritually he opened his eyes by
[1:18:05] identifying himself with the works that
[1:18:08] have been proven have been that he stood
[1:18:11] as evidence that Jesus Christ was the
[1:18:14] Messiah and this man said I believe and
[1:18:16] the Bible said he began to worship Him
[1:18:21] [Applause]
[1:18:22] help us Lord
[1:18:23] see we must understand
[1:18:27] what what was good for us message people
[1:18:30] you know years ago or whenever that's
[1:18:33] not where God is turned in a corner
[1:18:35] because he's looking for Sons and
[1:18:38] Daughters to adopt
[1:18:40] adopted
[1:18:43] and he's putting you through the ringer
[1:18:46] testing you with everything
[1:18:49] to see whether you're going to believe
[1:18:51] his word or not
[1:18:53] to see whether you just got to see it
[1:18:55] happen
[1:18:56] well when you once you see it happen he
[1:18:59] don't need your faith your faith is all
[1:19:00] right yelling at me well I believe it
[1:19:02] when I see it come on come on what
[1:19:05] no I believe it if I don't see it no I'd
[1:19:08] never seen rain but he believed it
[1:19:11] Sarah she laughed
[1:19:13] but then God gave her strength to
[1:19:16] believe
[1:19:17] God will give you strength to believe
[1:19:19] especially when you seed
[1:19:23] he's going to give it to you
[1:19:26] it's yours it's your inheritance
[1:19:30] don't ever think God is your enemy he's
[1:19:32] your friend that's what he said to
[1:19:34] Abraham I'm your friend and where
[1:19:37] Abraham seed he's our friend
[1:19:40] listen
[1:19:42] but those says Watch Seven Seals has
[1:19:44] been opened the Whirlwind is to the West
[1:19:47] now don't miss it like they did back
[1:19:50] Yonder what did they miss they missed
[1:19:53] their day of visitation
[1:19:55] when Jesus came they missed him
[1:19:59] and brother William said every messenger
[1:20:01] of God he said that that the church
[1:20:04] World always missed them and then once
[1:20:07] they're gone then they recognize them
[1:20:10] you know like St Patrick
[1:20:15] Joan of Arc who the Catholic Church
[1:20:17] killed and then once they
[1:20:20] come along I forgot how many years it
[1:20:22] took them to recognize that Joan of arch
[1:20:24] was not a witch
[1:20:26] but she was a gifted sister
[1:20:29] then they dug up the priest's bones and
[1:20:31] threw it in the river whatever they did
[1:20:33] they tried to uh recompense compensate
[1:20:36] or whatever you call it amen but the
[1:20:38] works was already done
[1:20:41] what about John the Baptist
[1:20:44] what about Jesus
[1:20:46] you think about the patience of God
[1:20:51] Here with Jesus killed and crucified and
[1:20:53] raised from the dead there in Jerusalem
[1:20:59] and 99 of the world didn't even know he
[1:21:02] existed
[1:21:03] didn't even know God had come down and
[1:21:06] visited us
[1:21:08] same thing with the message
[1:21:10] here was God in a little Kentuckian
[1:21:12] right here in Kentucky
[1:21:16] a no man's land
[1:21:18] well it used to be
[1:21:20] but the point is a man with seventh
[1:21:23] grade education that's the kind God uses
[1:21:26] sometimes our education gets us in
[1:21:29] trouble
[1:21:33] I know it's gotten me in trouble
[1:21:34] sometimes you know we let our minds
[1:21:36] reason when we shouldn't
[1:21:43] he says listen
[1:21:47] they missed him
[1:21:49] they missed John the Baptist we thought
[1:21:51] the Elijah must come John disciples his
[1:21:53] own disciples did not even recognize who
[1:21:56] he was
[1:21:57] and Jesus said well Elias has already
[1:22:00] come and you didn't know it and then
[1:22:01] they have done to him whatever they
[1:22:03] wanted to do with them
[1:22:05] and the Bible said then his disciples
[1:22:07] perceived that he would talk about John
[1:22:11] oh my God Jesus what about his disciples
[1:22:15] they didn't fully understand him no
[1:22:18] don't tell me they did because when he
[1:22:20] talked told them how he was going to be
[1:22:22] crucified how he was going to die and
[1:22:24] when the event took place they all
[1:22:26] scattered
[1:22:28] they didn't even fully understand him
[1:22:32] until they received the Holy Ghost
[1:22:34] that's when they understood that Jesus
[1:22:36] Christ was God
[1:22:38] that's why Peter could say
[1:22:41] God has made him both Lord and Christ
[1:22:47] and you and I you'll never see it oh I
[1:22:51] don't care who you are you you know I'm
[1:22:54] hoping somebody online can hear what I'm
[1:22:56] saying until you get the Holy Ghost
[1:22:58] you'll never know that Jesus Christ is
[1:23:01] God
[1:23:04] Peter had a revelation Thou Art the
[1:23:08] Christ the son of a living God but you
[1:23:09] understand that was just
[1:23:12] up here it couldn't have been here
[1:23:15] because when the pressure came he tried
[1:23:16] to kill the Roman soldier and one thing
[1:23:19] about this Holy Ghost he's not going to
[1:23:21] cause you to take nobody's head off
[1:23:26] now our attention's a little closer to
[1:23:28] our day he says now our attention a
[1:23:31] little closer to our day what does the
[1:23:32] scripture say about today and about the
[1:23:34] time we live in Jesus speaking I won't
[1:23:37] have time to take them all but I want
[1:23:39] you to take this one before we close
[1:23:42] Jesus said in Saint Luke 17 chapter the
[1:23:46] 30th verse the word himself do you
[1:23:49] believe that he said Jesus Christ the
[1:23:51] word himself made flesh spoken said what
[1:23:53] the word would be in the end time
[1:23:57] what will be the sign of the end of the
[1:23:59] world he told the Nations
[1:24:01] would rise against Nation but he said as
[1:24:04] it was in the days of Sodom so shall it
[1:24:06] be in the day when the son of man is
[1:24:09] revealed he promised the son of man and
[1:24:12] William Branham was a son of man
[1:24:14] revealing the son of man he said I'm not
[1:24:17] him I'm not it but I'm just a covering
[1:24:19] I'm just a housing and God was revealing
[1:24:23] himself to the world and they did just
[1:24:26] the same with William Branham as they
[1:24:28] did oh people don't even like for you to
[1:24:30] call his name
[1:24:31] that's nonsense
[1:24:33] that's just a carnal mind
[1:24:36] right how can you tell about you know
[1:24:39] the flood and you don't say Noah
[1:24:42] how can you tell about the Exodus of of
[1:24:44] of of of uh uh the children of Israel
[1:24:47] and you don't say Moses
[1:24:52] what do you say
[1:24:53] the brother
[1:24:55] the brother
[1:24:57] deliver the children out of out of
[1:24:59] bondage
[1:25:00] the brother built an ark what brother
[1:25:03] the brother has a name
[1:25:06] it so amazes me because even in this
[1:25:09] last days people don't want you to say
[1:25:12] brother random but I remember when I was
[1:25:14] in the Pentecostal church we always said
[1:25:16] the bishop said the bishop said
[1:25:19] when I was in high school we had a
[1:25:21] teacher who believed in Billy Graham
[1:25:23] every phrase in Spanish she was teaching
[1:25:26] the Spanish she said Billy Graham said
[1:25:32] and we had a few devils in that class
[1:25:34] who hated the name of William Billy
[1:25:37] Graham and they they got her fired
[1:25:42] but you know what let me hurry up
[1:25:44] because I've gone too long I don't I'm
[1:25:46] trying to get to my point each hey age
[1:25:49] had a messenger Who Sold seed Luther
[1:25:52] sold the seed that just shall live by
[1:25:55] faith Wesley sold the seed of
[1:25:57] sanctification crossing over into
[1:25:59] Pentecost sold the seed of receiving of
[1:26:02] the Holy Ghost and the receiving of gift
[1:26:04] then the sower himself
[1:26:08] you understand me the sore himself came
[1:26:12] and sold seed it wasn't William Branham
[1:26:15] it was God in the man sowing Faith seeds
[1:26:20] that could produce a Rapture in a people
[1:26:23] once it's quickened
[1:26:28] foreign
[1:26:30] of the Capstone perfect love right so
[1:26:34] the soul to see and that's what what we
[1:26:36] we must understand you said what birth
[1:26:38] because I'm not where I should be it
[1:26:39] doesn't mean the seed is not there it
[1:26:42] means you have not humbled yourself so
[1:26:44] that God can Quicken it
[1:26:47] it's there otherwise you wouldn't have
[1:26:49] ears to hear
[1:26:51] that shows you are elected and you're
[1:26:54] predestinated he said my sheep Hearth my
[1:26:56] voice and a stranger they will not
[1:26:59] follow but there are procedures that we
[1:27:02] have taken out of the formula
[1:27:06] of salvation
[1:27:08] and if you take the holy ghost or the
[1:27:11] Christ
[1:27:12] and that's what brother Venom came to
[1:27:13] tell us justification made room for
[1:27:16] sanctification sanctification made room
[1:27:18] for uh the baptism of Holy Ghost and the
[1:27:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost making room
[1:27:23] for Christ the person Jesus himself
[1:27:31] like I said the message came in seed
[1:27:33] form we're growing up now
[1:27:35] things are becoming clearer to us
[1:27:38] that we left Eliza to join Isaac
[1:27:44] um
[1:27:49] but the Pentecostal what is it you talk
[1:27:51] about Pentecost because that's what a
[1:27:53] lot of people
[1:27:54] like to identify themselves
[1:27:57] but the real Pentecostals most of them
[1:27:59] gone they gone to Glory most of them
[1:28:02] the real ones
[1:28:05] and they they got those Renegades now
[1:28:07] they call Pentecostals so does the
[1:28:10] message
[1:28:11] is a restoration of the same kind of a
[1:28:14] grain that went into the ground at the
[1:28:16] beginning
[1:28:18] bringing back all the fullness of the
[1:28:21] power of Pentecost
[1:28:23] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:27] last day oh it's a great thing to look
[1:28:30] to believe and to look at now in this
[1:28:33] we're now living this age is beyond
[1:28:37] Pentecost
[1:28:39] Pentecost had settled itself into
[1:28:42] organizations and started faking whole
[1:28:44] Lots about organizations we are this and
[1:28:48] we are that that's just nature you just
[1:28:51] can't help it it's nature they'll do
[1:28:54] that it's it's the plan for them to do
[1:28:57] that but the church has moved on
[1:29:01] it's gone into greater more powerful
[1:29:05] it's the restoration of the gifts and
[1:29:08] many Pentecostal people does not believe
[1:29:10] in Divine Healing Ministry of angels and
[1:29:13] power of God right now even now you tell
[1:29:16] somebody in the message that you had a
[1:29:18] an experience with an angel like what it
[1:29:21] can't be true
[1:29:24] when did he stop it
[1:29:26] tell me when oh they only visit prophets
[1:29:29] no they visit Peter
[1:29:32] and they're historically listen what
[1:29:35] about the man a man who had a vision
[1:29:37] that Jesus Christ came and and and and
[1:29:40] and and and who you remember the
[1:29:42] drugstore man he gave the hit the
[1:29:44] medicine to the woman
[1:29:45] and when his wife reached out her hands
[1:29:48] it was the hand of Jesus pierced and
[1:29:50] everything else and and the the drug
[1:29:53] that says brother do you really believe
[1:29:54] in such things that he said yes I
[1:29:56] believe it
[1:29:58] what made us get away from the
[1:30:00] supernatural when we're born
[1:30:02] Supernatural
[1:30:04] fear
[1:30:06] not all teachers are bad there are some
[1:30:09] teachers that are really brilliant and
[1:30:11] wonderful teachers but a lot of them
[1:30:14] have taken
[1:30:17] and you got to go take it back
[1:30:20] you go to church and you got such an
[1:30:22] order that you can't even get out of
[1:30:24] order
[1:30:25] really your out of order is in order
[1:30:28] according to the scripture
[1:30:30] I remember my wife and I in a church
[1:30:33] some time ago to a concert and they you
[1:30:36] you think that you was at some kind of
[1:30:38] I don't know
[1:30:40] Auditorium where they just there to
[1:30:42] entertain you
[1:30:44] my wife and I was the only one standing
[1:30:46] up and clapping and they looking at us
[1:30:47] like what are you doing
[1:30:51] a message
[1:30:52] well
[1:30:53] that's what they call themselves
[1:30:57] right
[1:31:04] Lord y'all gonna see I ain't got to say
[1:31:08] much
[1:31:10] because when I break loose Y'all Gonna
[1:31:12] Know It
[1:31:14] that's all I'm saying
[1:31:16] it ain't going to be no oh I'm gonna
[1:31:18] show them no no no
[1:31:21] but one thing I know I got it coming
[1:31:23] I got it coming and because God said
[1:31:26] when you ask and believe you shall
[1:31:29] receive
[1:31:30] and I don't know one man throughout
[1:31:32] history who did cry out for a Revival
[1:31:36] and didn't get it
[1:31:38] it may not have happened in his time but
[1:31:41] it happened I just preached that to you
[1:31:44] right Ministry of angels and power of
[1:31:46] God many people many Pentecostals call
[1:31:50] these visions that I see the devil many
[1:31:53] organizations won't even have nothing to
[1:31:55] do with it in Pentecost see we've moved
[1:31:58] beyond that just as method is called
[1:32:01] Pentecostal crazy for speaking in
[1:32:03] tongues just as a Lutheran called
[1:32:05] Methodist crazy for shouting see but
[1:32:07] it's all a coming forth of the Holy
[1:32:10] Spirit till listen the great church is
[1:32:14] being filled and chugged full Hallelujah
[1:32:19] okay
[1:32:21] oh my god
[1:32:24] of the great power y'all know what chug
[1:32:27] means it's a hold it up like this
[1:32:31] targeting down yes
[1:32:33] chugged full Hallelujah
[1:32:36] of the great power of the almighty God
[1:32:39] until is God to a place until the very
[1:32:43] work that Jesus done is manifested in
[1:32:46] itself right in the church
[1:32:49] now
[1:32:51] and I'm not preaching this to say it's
[1:32:53] coming I'm saying it's here
[1:32:56] we're living in a living ahead of that
[1:32:59] now we are Beyond Pentecost I'm gonna
[1:33:02] keep saying that the same as we are a
[1:33:04] Methodist and Luther way up to the
[1:33:07] coming of the Lord where the minister of
[1:33:09] Jesus Christ exercised himself has to be
[1:33:12] exalted y'all understand me he said the
[1:33:15] ministry of Jesus Christ has to be a
[1:33:17] excuse me not exalted has to be exactly
[1:33:20] like the headstone on the pyramid has to
[1:33:23] be so home till every stone fit
[1:33:26] perfectly and the church has got to get
[1:33:29] in that condition to receive the
[1:33:31] headstone then take the whole thing in
[1:33:34] the resurrection see when we get in that
[1:33:36] condition that God is saying we is
[1:33:39] required us to get into
[1:33:41] we are then joined in such a way it'll
[1:33:44] cause the resurrection
[1:33:46] there must be a come a union with the
[1:33:49] bridegroom
[1:33:50] has to the character his divine nature
[1:33:54] she must become him promise of the age
[1:33:57] and what is the promise of the age that
[1:34:00] God will will will will will produce in
[1:34:04] this last days little Messiahs
[1:34:08] Hallelujah that's what the Bible says
[1:34:10] the Bible says according to Revelation
[1:34:12] 19 10 he said for the testimony of Jesus
[1:34:16] is the spirit of Prophecy
[1:34:19] and I want you to know I'm part of that
[1:34:21] spirit I am part of the prophecy that
[1:34:23] has been prophesied that in the last
[1:34:26] days that the mechanic and the Dynamics
[1:34:29] will come back to the church
[1:34:32] it is here but we got to get some people
[1:34:34] that's ready to to go Beyond the Veil
[1:34:38] until that church become both Dynamics
[1:34:40] and mechanics and the spirit of God that
[1:34:43] moved him to do the things that he did
[1:34:45] if he hit on 16 cylinders so with a
[1:34:49] bride amen for he said in John 14 12 he
[1:34:52] that believeth on me the words that I do
[1:34:54] shall he also do I give him a charge of
[1:34:58] my a charge of my Dynamics in his
[1:35:01] mechanics that that the world will not
[1:35:04] be able to withstand it and I'll raise
[1:35:07] him up again in the last days see that
[1:35:09] Easter message that dynamics that
[1:35:11] mechanics together the mechanics without
[1:35:14] the Dynamics no good neither is the
[1:35:16] Dynamics without the mechanics you can
[1:35:18] scream and shout and jump up and down
[1:35:21] and and all you want to deny the word it
[1:35:24] won't do any good you're just crinking
[1:35:26] around the Pistons got the Sparks there
[1:35:29] to fire but no gasoline to fire it by
[1:35:33] it's only work as they come together
[1:35:38] did y'all hear that it only works when
[1:35:41] they come together amen so one will
[1:35:43] still will sit still and the other one
[1:35:46] will go up that's the only thing there
[1:35:49] is to it yet they both might look alike
[1:35:53] both claim to be churches both claim to
[1:35:56] be bride but out of mechanics but one
[1:35:59] but one excuse me has mechanics and
[1:36:02] dynamic it brings it to past of what he
[1:36:06] said is the truth it just won't move no
[1:36:09] matter how good the mechanics is until
[1:36:11] the Dynamics come when the Dynamics come
[1:36:15] the that fire is made to connect with
[1:36:18] that octane in the gasoline and when
[1:36:21] that explodes it causes a combustion and
[1:36:25] that combustion moves every motion every
[1:36:28] move for he is the same yesterday today
[1:36:30] and forever that's the resurrection
[1:36:32] that's the real power of God mechanisms
[1:36:35] with the Dynamics is the spirit that
[1:36:37] quickens is that right it's a spirit
[1:36:39] it's the Sparks that fire it's not the
[1:36:42] gas that fires it's the spark that fires
[1:36:45] the gas Jesus said you can't do nothing
[1:36:48] without me but with me you can do all
[1:36:51] things
[1:36:52] as he is the word is the father living
[1:36:55] father sent me so of sent I you as the
[1:36:58] father has fired me and pushed me into
[1:37:00] everything I do only that which is
[1:37:02] pleasing to God now as he sent me so
[1:37:06] send I you with the same mechanics and
[1:37:08] it takes the same Dynamics to operate it
[1:37:11] and these signs should follow them that
[1:37:14] claim they have to have the mechanics
[1:37:17] the Dynamics will take its place now
[1:37:20] there's much more but I'm gonna stop
[1:37:21] here I just want you to see that without
[1:37:24] the Holy Ghost we're just a regular dead
[1:37:26] Church
[1:37:27] foreign
[1:37:29] feeling good shouting good singing good
[1:37:32] preaching good is more than that
[1:37:35] we're in the age of adoption
[1:37:38] well the man said the full word is to be
[1:37:40] born into the manifestation again
[1:37:43] Vindicated by the spirit of God in the
[1:37:46] full strength as it was when it was here
[1:37:49] on Earth full strength
[1:37:51] not letting the devil just do us any
[1:37:53] kind of way kick us all around and
[1:37:55] saying we're proud come on manifested in
[1:37:58] the same way doing the same thing that
[1:38:00] he did when it was on on here on Earth
[1:38:02] amen now I don't know about you
[1:38:05] I'm closing but that
[1:38:07] it don't make you want more
[1:38:11] you know to make you say God where where
[1:38:13] is it
[1:38:14] lead me and guide me Lord help me
[1:38:17] I want to be that that's me you speaking
[1:38:20] of I know that I know that but I'm not
[1:38:23] there
[1:38:26] Lord show me how to break through

[1:38:36] you know
[1:38:47] let's stay
[1:38:52] brother president said then what is it
[1:38:54] now

[1:39:25] seals and the mysteries of God even to
[1:39:27] the serpent seat in all would be
[1:39:30] manifested married and divorced marriage
[1:39:32] and divorce and all of these other
[1:39:33] Mysteries that have been hid under the
[1:39:35] pillar of all these years from the
[1:39:39] theologians and so forth but it's now
[1:39:41] the hour
[1:39:43] that's the father's business
[1:39:46] Jesus said I am the way the truth and
[1:39:48] the life no man can come to God accept
[1:39:51] by me
[1:39:52] in other words I am the door to the
[1:39:54] Sheepfold all without a thieves he is
[1:39:58] the only approach he is the door he is
[1:40:01] the way the truth the life all that
[1:40:04] there is the only entrance the only
[1:40:07] place the only worship The Only Name
[1:40:11] everything is tied to Jesus Christ all
[1:40:14] the Old Testament is tied to him the New
[1:40:17] Testament tied to him and the church
[1:40:19] today is tied to him by the word of his
[1:40:22] commandment there is not another place
[1:40:25] or another name or anywhere where God
[1:40:29] ever promised to meet a man only in
[1:40:32] Jesus Christ
[1:40:33] his chosen place
[1:40:36] worship
[1:40:38] our heavenly father
[1:40:40] we come before you Lord
[1:40:43] we thank you for the word that has been
[1:40:45] spoken

[1:40:49] I am a believer
[1:40:54] I believe your word
[1:40:55] [Music]
[1:40:59] I know what is spoken by Malachi 4 is
[1:41:03] true
[1:41:03] I see your will
[1:41:07] Lord let your will be done in US
[1:41:11] we know it's not by power nor by might
[1:41:14] but by your spirit Lord
[1:41:17] it's not him that willeth nor he that
[1:41:19] runeth
[1:41:20] but Lord Jesus is you who who shows your
[1:41:23] mercy toward us
[1:41:25] father we are living in such an evil age
[1:41:29] where Satan is battling our minds every
[1:41:32] day making us weary in our flesh and our
[1:41:36] spirit
[1:41:38] but in all of this my soul says yes
[1:41:41] to your will and your word
[1:41:44] in spite of all of the obstacles
[1:41:46] in spite of all of the spirits of
[1:41:49] unbelief that he sends my way
[1:41:51] I hold true
[1:41:53] to My Confession
[1:41:56] that this message
[1:41:58] is you
[1:41:59] and you're the same yesterday today and
[1:42:02] forever
[1:42:03] and father I believe
[1:42:06] that my day and our day
[1:42:10] where you're going to raise us up to a
[1:42:12] place
[1:42:13] the world will see that we are truly
[1:42:16] your disciples
[1:42:18] they will see o God that there's a
[1:42:21] difference between us and the
[1:42:23] organizations
[1:42:25] they'll see you Lord
[1:42:27] manifested in your fullness
[1:42:29] they won't know what to do with it
[1:42:32] but even so at that time
[1:42:34] Lord Jesus you'll take us to another
[1:42:37] dimension
[1:42:38] you'll come back in a way that will see
[1:42:41] you in
[1:42:42] we embrace you
[1:42:44] father have mercy
[1:42:46] for those of us who have been dilatory
[1:42:49] and slack I'm one of them
[1:42:51] my press Lord is
[1:42:54] weak sometimes
[1:42:57] but father look beyond my faults look

[1:50:22] in Des Moines at this church but we are

[1:50:28] put the address in the email and in the
[1:50:30] group so you know the directions which
[1:50:33] is a regular judge we used to we usually
[1:50:35] go to so we will not be having service
[1:50:37] here at this church
[1:50:40] so if you come here there will be no one
[1:50:44] we will be having a picnic afterwards
[1:50:50] as the week progresses
[1:50:52] just update the church then let us also
[1:50:55] remember that um since we are having
[1:50:57] um
[1:50:58] service in Iowa City
[1:51:01] if you feel led to give offering
[1:51:04] whilst we are there that's fine but we
[1:51:07] should keep our tithing separate because

[1:51:13] have your title you want to give on
[1:51:15] Sunday and you are in Iowa City you can
[1:51:17] go ahead and see me then we'll be able
