hope it's everybody's prayers [Music] this afternoon and without taking too much time we want to thank everybody for being here and we praise the lord for letting us you know come here and and speak his word and um we'll turn our bible to the book of job the second chapter verse 28 to 32. joel chapter 2 verse 28 to 32 and then the bible says and it shall come to pass afterward that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your old man shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit and i wish you wanders in the heavens and in the earth and in the earth blood and fire and floods of smoke the sun shall not be turned into darkness and the mood in the blood before the great and terrible day of the lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the lamb of the lord shall be delivered for in mount zion and in jerusalem shall be deliverance as the lord has said and as and in remnant whom the lord shall call amen let's go to the new testament the book of acts chapter 2 verse 14 to verse 21. you'll see that it's the same scripture the stem so same the same story the same chapter of each book chapter 20 of chapter 2. so let's go to uh acts chapter 2 verse 14 to verse 21. the bible says by peter standing up with the 11th with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of judea and all ye that dwell in the in jerusalem be this known unto you and hark and herkin to my words for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel now here peter is quoting everything that we just read in joel chapter 2 and he said and it shall come to pass in the day in the last days saith god i will pour out my spirit upon our flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesize and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and all my servants and on my handmaids will i will pour out my pura in those days my spirit and they shall prophesy and i will show my my wonders in heaven above and signs in the ear in the earth beneath and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapor of smoke the sun shall not be turned into darkness the moon demon into blood before the great and notable day of the lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved amen let's pray dear heavenly father lord we come to you father god this afternoon jesus christ be from your throne before your throne of grace lord first say thank you father god for your grace and your mercy lord thank you father god for letting us be here father god and we pray that lord jesus as you are here and we are here lord jesus we want you father god to speak to us this afternoon lord jesus lord i pray that you take me out of the way father god and you speak to your people lord jesus i pray that let every word that will speak that will be spoken oh father god be o father god the sermon to me and to them also o father god and at the end of the service father god we can testify and say that truly the lord is the lord was and he is among us lord lord we thank you father god i pray o lord jesus christ that you helped me to be so sensitive to the holy spirit father god and to go wherever father god he will lead me lord lord we ask you father god to be with us lord we pray for brother brother uh isaiah brooks and his wife father god where they are may you comfort them father lord we ask you father god to bless us and to come lord jesus christ among us in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated so this uh tonight my my sermon if i can entitle it it'll be a story that becomes a personal experience from this two verse that we read we see that in joel chapter 2 this was a prophecy that was given and that prophecy throughout the entire throughout the ages throughout the time before act people were reading that prophecy as a story you know parents could you know read the prophecy and tell the children here here is what the bible says you know in the last days god will fear the people with his spirit you know in the last days you know god would send the spirit spirit to fill the people you know all of that was a story that the one that was telling their children all of that was like a story you know telling them because they they had to know about the word but until that happened it became a personal experience for the those who were in the upper room no those who were in the upper room the way they would tell the same story will be different than what the fathers were telling to their parents to their children you know they apparently the parent would tell to the children based on what the bible says they will quote the bible only quote the bible they will say that you know one day the prophet joel told us about this and that the lord will fill the people with his spirit you know they will say this it'll be like you know uh it'll be uh it'll be a story that they will be telling them but when but when this happened when this came to pass you know that changed the way of telling him you know the disciple i can see peter he can tell the people that this what this is what the prophet joel said and this is what i experienced you know it was now a different the same story but it was still it was being told in a different angle you know it was like the the chin of israel after going after going through the red sea and now they you know after you know going through or jordan uh i believe joshua told them to pick up stones and to let to tell to tell their children about when they would ask them about the stones to tell them what happened you know that wasn't only a story about what that was experience and experience being told to someone and before i i go really far with my my subject uh i just wanted to share with you this scripture bible scripture that i've been on my on my mind for for this entire week i hope it will be a blessing for you it's found in second kings chapter 6 verse 24. it's a story that i believe most of us know it but uh a reminder will do us uh we will do will be very good for us second kings chapter 6 verse 24 second king chapter 6 24. sorry about the bible says and it came to pass after this that ben headed king of syria gathered all this host and went up and beside and besieged samaria and there was a great famine in samaria and behold they besieged it until and as an ass head was sold for four score a piece of pieces of silver so four score a score is 20 so four score it'll be like a d score for a single pistol for for just the head of an s and uh and and the fourth part of of a cab of a dove of doves there of dubs down for five pieces of silver that means that according because it were you know people didn't have anything to eat they didn't have any food so things went high on price and as the king of israel was passing by upon the wall they cried there cried the woman unto him saying help my lord o king and and he said if the lord do not help thee when shall i help thee out of the uh the born flow or out of the the one and the king said unto her what what else d which means that what do you want and and she said and she answered this and she answered this woman now she began to tell a story about what happened before like the day before why she was crying she said that this woman said unto me give thy son that we may eat him today and we will eat my son tomorrow that means that that shows us the gravity or you know the the intense of lacking food of not having food so we boiled my son and did eat him and i said unto her on the next day give thy son that we may eat him and she has hit her son and it came to pass when the king heard the words of the woman that he rent the king ran his clothes and passed by i passed by upon the wall and the people looked and behold he had the sackcloth within upon his flesh then he said god do so and more also to me if the head of elisha the son of sephat shall stand on him this day so now the king uh you'll see that if you read a little bit further you'll see that the king asks the people to go call elisha because elisha was the prophet in that time so when they went to call elisha uh chapter seven verse one and two then elisha said hear ye the word of the lord thou sayeth the lord tomorrow about this time shall a measure of find a fine flower be sought for shaco and two measures of barely barley for shekel and the gate in the gate of samaria then a lord on whose hand the king lin answered the man of god and said behold if the lord will make wind we make windows in heaven my might these things be so this was kind of a mockery toward the prophecy you know you cried you know you need help from the lord and here is the answer the lord is giving you the answer for your cry now you mocking the lord it's like saying that you know if god want to create a walmart in heaven where it will say where we sell things in this cheap price let it be you know it was a mockery for for god you know toward the prophecy that was given now here's what elisha said and he said behold thou shalt see it with denies but shall not eat thereof because of the response of the prophet to the prophecy you know many times we go through trials many times we go through hard times many times you know things may not work for us many times you know we see the situation becomes hard and hard and and we pray to god but sometimes our our response to god's answer is not good that that allows you know that doesn't allow god to to you know to bless us you know many times when we pray we come to church we pray and and you know you you know in your place you pray and you ask god to help you you know figure out something but here is an answer god is giving you the answer but you can't trust god enough for it you know those things as you know they have bad bad consequences you see that this man you know because of doubting what elisha said elijah told him you will see it happen but you will not eat it and if you read therefore you if you read the entire chapter you will see that there were three uh on lepers three men who were lady the three leprous men who you know who were outside outside of the city you know they were outside of the city they couldn't they they you know they talk to each other they say that uh can we if we go into the if we go in the city there is no food we will die and if we stay here we will die as well if we go to the philistine if we go to the enemies camp we might die oh we might not die if they cut if we they don't catch us we would not die but we will find food but if they do if they catch us they will kill us but it might you know it's good to go and to try if to try if it'll work or not and when they went it happened that the the fear the the enemies they felt like god you know god you know they felt like a voice the noise of of of of chariots you know of army of the great army coming to attack them and just by the sound of the voice they all flee and those three hebrew those three men who was neglected you know they were able to bring blessing for the entire city and that man who doubted the scripture he was able to see it was he was able to see the scripture happen but he couldn't eat it because if he passed away you know this is this tells us two lessons that first we have to watch our response to what the prophet to or towards god's answer and the second thing is that you are not no matter how little you think you are you will not little in the in the house of god look at those three men you know who cared about people who are laborers you know nobody cares about them they are by themselves you know away from people but they could have bring you know they were able god used them to bring a blessing for the for the entire city and the prophet says that sometimes when things are going wrong it's a sign of a blessing i'll read the prophet he says that you know sometimes when things are going wrong dark we know by nature that it's dark it's darkest uh it is dark it's just before the day and many times when we see these uh uh disastrous things happen happening like that especially to believers we must bear this in our mind that it's satan trying to block the blood trying to block the blessing that it's on the road you know there is a blessing on the road and you will see satan coming to trying to block it you know trying to get you away from god trying to get you away from from you know from from your personal relationship with god trying to get you trying to get you distracted and sometimes we blame ups we blame ours ourselves when when we have hard things coming to us we say well it's because my parents sin that's what i'm that's what i'm you know that's what i can't be blessed it's because of this one did this that's what i can't be blessed but the bible says i think in ezekiel chapter 18 verse 1 to 4 that you know there's a they were uh like a a proverb or or things that people were saying that would say that the father has eaten sour grapes and the teeth of the children uh uh has been said on there and has been said on edge you know that means that you know that the follower the father has done something and the cursing is going through the children through generation and generation that was yeah and and god taught his prophet ezekiel to tell the children of israel that they should stop saying that you know he says that the only way to stop that curse not to come to you is is to change your life the only time the only the only thing that you can stop that chris to come to you is to you know is to repent you know to to to live a righteous life and that will stop it and god will have a new start with you because because if you read father on on that same uh chapter i think verse 21 to 23 you see that uh the bible is telling us that but when you repent your sins will not be remembered you know when you repent your sin will not be remembered it will be a raise from god i believe brother uh or sam when he was preaching last sunday said uh something that when one time the prophet came on i think was during the prayer line you know someone came to the prophet and he prayed before coming to the prophet you know he prayed before he confessed his sin and when the prophet when he came to the prophet the prophet couldn't see what the person has done why because the person had to repent the sin and when you repent your sin that it's been you know it's been erased from god's presence and i had a message that i wanted to preach but the lord kind of guide me differently i wanted to entirely when uh when our uh our testimonies will be written because if you read the bible you see the abraham we know that abraham's sin abraham lied we know that abraham made mistakes but when paul came after that to write his testimonies none of his mistakes was mentioned we see that all of those people none of their mistakes were mentioned you know only good things we only paul only wrote about faith only wrote about good things i have done but none of them mistakes were mentioned why because they had to because you know they were forgiven because one day they had to you know they came to god and they regret about their sins and god forgive them and god forgive them and and and that is the same thing that we have to do you know i don't know why i say this but you know but i felt like saying that and and i believe that if you think that there is something that is hindering you from gay from came from getting god's blessings if you think that there is something that you can't get over with it must be i you know it has to it might be the holy spirit getting the holy spirit it might be you know having experience with god it might be something else you know as long as you repent it to god as long as you come to god and you sincere and then you tell it to him i believe that god will bless you and i believe that god will will forgive you amen and the prophet and i remember going back to my subject i remember my dad as we were growing up and during during our prayer uh our family prayer he only had one sermon that he was preaching us over and over you know that was like his signature sermon if i can call it you know every time if if you know it's a family prayer you know most time most of the time it was about the same sermon and that the discernment he intelligent it was about the heroes of the bible you know how you know he was showing us how you know god never left his children alone by themselves he always come to back them up when they have troubles when they're going through troubles and and stuff so but now at that time i didn't understand why and i didn't understand you know when he was preaching this to what my dad is not a preacher but when he was telling this to us i i didn't understand it you know i was like yeah this is that sermon matter of fact when he asked me to preach for the first time at home i i preached the same subject the same sermon he was preaching because it was like something that i have memorized and i knew everything so i could have repeated something but but though i preached that sermon back then i didn't understand it but one day i think it was this month or last month i asked myself why why those people they have different gift in the bible they have different positions in the bible but they all came to the same result why because i was trying to ask myself so what are what what is best to have as a gift but i found out that the secret of all those men they they were able to lay to give their life to christ you know they were able to give their gift to christ you know they didn't only count on a gift but they count on christ you know christ was the center of everything you know they were able to surrender to surrender their life to christ we see moses the prophet says that moses though moses was blessed though moses was gifted but he had to have an experience with god to operate the gift matter of fact he had the gift because the prophet preached a sermon that gift out without repentance that means that we're born with the gift but moses though being but though moses being born with the gift he had to he had to have an experience with god you know matter of fact when he killed that man in egypt he had the gift with him but he flee why because he was afraid of death but when god were but when he experienced god you know that took the fear out of his face and he could have gone you know he could he went back to face it to face a pharaoh you know that's the same thing and the prophet said that you know the seed of god he said that everybody who has the seed of god to so that that seed can come to maturity he has to come to that experience of the burning bush you know you have to come to that experience to make the story to become a personal reality a personal experience to you you know we might tell to people you know because we're living in a time where people need fat you know sometimes when you tell something that we ask you when when did this happen you know try to imagine you telling someone you go witness to someone and you telling him about act how other people receive the holy spirit and everything you though you may quote the scriptures and might fix it you know and and repeat exactly the same thing or put some spice on it but he will ask you something what makes you say that this really happened because some anybody can write these scriptures and anybody can write the bible and what makes you say that this is true you know you have to have something to back that up you know you have to have a life experience to go present to that man you know here is the bible and here's my experience behind it you know i also read this scripture but i experienced it so this scripture to me it's like it has another a different meaning and and that person when you will prove that person you know your experience that will be a good thing for him because even jesus to let the disciple go be good to go witness he told them you have to wait until you have been filled with the power from from on high you know he told them you have to wait until you have been you know until you have that experience then you will go and tell the people and go witness about what you have experienced because that's what we call about witnessing is to to go tell the people what you have experienced and and there's a difference between when you tell somebody about what you have experienced and when you tell somebody what you have read you know it's it's it's two different things and even the way you're telling it it's different you know because for example as us young people you know we have our own struggles that we have that we go through you know and it's easy to relate to someone young as you you know you know about the same struggle if you have experienced it than just recording the bible and say hey uh uh he comes to you and say hey uh brother i'm going through this and you say well uh if you're going through this you have to read this scripture and the bible says this and that that is good in my image the scripture will help him but it'll be better if you come and tell him hey you see what i went through the same thing you know i went through the same experience but this is how god has set me free this is how god has delivered me and this is how i was and this is how i am but now and to get that experience to come to that experience you know it requires us to be desperate for god you know everything is based on desperation and if we are desperate you know that's that is when god will come and and you know and deal with us and desperation and the prophet says that you can be desperate if you don't have love if you don't love and you can't be desperate without faith and you can't have faith if you don't love the prophet says that's why i'm not married this i'm just calling the prophet he says that you know that's why you know a man loves a man has faith in his wife because he loves her you know that's why you have faith in your wife you know that one i have not experienced that yet uh hopefully one day i will and and you know the prophet says that that you know the man has faith in his wife because he loves him and that's the same thing with god we have faith in god because we love god you know it's the love of god inside of us that push us to have faith in him you know and that pushes us to believe in everything that he he tells us every scriptures of the bible and and we can't and we have to believe it only if we are desperate because if you remember in james chapter five i believe they create the scripture says that the fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much you know a fervent prayer you know it's like a a prayer a prayer of someone who's desperate you know has more value to god than a simple prayer you know the desperation is something that is real that is really important for us to have and the prophet says that you can't be dead you can't pray for someone unless you desperate for him you know that's when you need to pray for someone unless you're desperate and god will will honor your prayer and god will bless you and as christians we have to see ourselves in the bible you know because we have to see ourselves in the bible when you read the bible you have to see your name on it i remember the part of the prophet i remember a story that the prophet said um about the young man who was in the boat with the captain and the captain was sick and he needed help the young man you know he didn't go to the captain telling him a story from a bible he didn't go to the captain and say hey uh this is what i've read nobody went to him and said that this is what my momma when i was sick this is what mom was reading to me and and this same scripture when i was sick that's the scripture that healed me and he was able to read the scripture and replace his name and the scripture because he knew that that scripture was not only a story for him but the scripture was an experience to him and and that experience when he told this to the captain and the captain was able to be to be to be healed you know the captain was able to recover uh to be recovered and when you don't have faith in god all those good bible stories won't be an experience to you because it's faith that makes everything to happen it's faith that makes there's a song that says the faith is the key that unlocks all the doors you know it's only faith when you have faith in god and i believe that you know faith in god is something that we need to have especially in this time that we're going on in this time that we're living in you know you don't know about tomorrow you don't know what tomorrow can bring you don't know what what is next what what is to come you know faith in god that is the most important thing that we need now you know faith in god is the thing that we need you know to have the holy spirit you have to have faith you know to be to see miracles you have to have faith you know to have a good relationship with god you have to have faith when you go into prayer you believe that god will come and meet me in my prayer you know to have the answer on your prayers you have to have faith in everything you have to have faith and you cannot have faith when you don't have love of god you know that's why you know paul you know when he was reading uh when he was writing the book of uh uh i think second uh um oh i forgot i forgot where it was but i think it's in chapter 13 of second corinthians i believe when he was writing about love you know he says that love is the center of everything i can't have all the gift i can have everything but if i don't have love that is nothing and then he said that there's three things that goes together faith love and and and the other i forget and and the most important one is love because when you have love love will bring all of this to happen the prophet says that if someone comes to him and asks him hey brother brandon what do you prefer either only having love or having all the gift of the bible that is written in the bible it says that i will choose love because i know with love i will all those gifts will come by themselves because i love god when you love god or when you love someone you see someone coming with the problem when you love him you'll be able you know to to feel this problem to making your own problem and by feeling that you will be able to go to god and pray for the person and if you love god you will love god so much and you will be reading the bible you will be praying and meditating and by meditating you will have a closer relationship with god and god will start showing you things about people god will start you know speaking to you directly if you love god you know you will have a prayer life and in that prayer you will be praying for things and god will god will honor your prayer because you love god and all of that because of love if you love god you see that hey i'm missing something oh oh my my faith is decreasing if you love god you will go to pray and ask god about that and god will god will give you more faith you know if you love god and you see that your oil is not enough to make it to the rapture you know you will go to god and you will ask god and god will give you more oil you know if you love god everything is centered by love everything is is love first and the love is the center and when love is the center all the other things will come because we come after it amen only if we love god and love we love only love of god will create this desperation in us and we see the example of peter you know who you know being in a troubled situation you know the waves coming to the boat you know they were about to sink they had no hope they couldn't cry for christ god was not even the boy with him you know they were like we left by ourselves we can't even swim here because the the waves are too strong so the end point is death but but all of a sudden is so god coming to him and he's so he saw jesus coming and he said that jesus if it's you bid me to come and he was desperate enough and when jesus told him come to me you know his little faith pushed him to come to god and and you see that though he failed you know but though he failed and he was sinking he was able to cry to god and god was able to come and rescue him why because god saw the desire that was inside of him though through his failures god was god so behind his failures and tonight you might see yourself as a failure tonight you may see yourself as a big sinner as the deepest sinner that ever existed in the world but god doesn't see you the same thing god sees behind but beyond that god says you know what you've been made of god sees the seed that is that is inside of you if you can only be desperate to god if you can only you know come to god and tell him whatever you want or whatever you have in you i believe that god will come and i will rescue you you know god is saying it the last time when i pushed i said you know in physics they teach us if you see something red through a red glass that the thing that you sing in red will be seen as white and that is the same thing with god god is seeing a red scene through his red blood and our sins are seen as well as white you know why it is crimson you know it seemed wide that means that you have no no no sin at all that means that god cannot even remember he cannot even see the prophet says in the message of desperations it says the the paragraph 119 desperation calls for a subject and when the subject no matter how faint it is it's received it's believed right then because faith catches one desperate the one desperation is pushing it see love love in there mixes with love in there mixes with it it and brings it to and brings it to it desperations does it it says he gave the example of blind bottom is called the vision quickly peter he was all steamed up one night on the seat when he got in this when he got in desperation and he began to cry out there is something uh there's something wrong i see a spirit come walking to me the sheep was about to go down he said if it be you lord beat me to come beat me to come to you on the water and he stepped down out of the sheep and started and he got scared when he got when he got started and it started to sink and desperation though a mistake in trying to follow the commandment the commandment of god i hope the church gets that the man was doing what god told him to do now you christian tonight you're in the line of duty trying to follow the leading of the holy spirit and the cancer grabs you or a death grabs you a cancer tubercular whatever it is in the line of duty you have the same right that peter had lord save me or i'll perish in desperation he called out and the hand reached and picked him up you have the same thing but he screamed out save me lord he heard my desperate cry from the waters lifted me now if i am see that's it when you cry out it says that when you are in the line of duty you know when you've been called to do something and you you are in the line of duty the devil can come and tempt you the devil can come and tempt your faith the prophet says that as long as you are there in that line of duty you have the same right as peter had you know you have the same right to come and and to cry and the prophet there is even a quote that uh i have that um i don't know if i can find it it says that people die sometimes people die because they want it he gives an example of a man who who was sick and he went to the doctor and the doctor gave him a medicine the man didn't want to take it he didn't want to take the medicine and then when he went to the doctors right at the front at the doors of the doctor's office the men passed away it says that it's not because the it wasn't a maid's emergency to heal the man but it was because of that man refusing to take the remedy of his healing it says it's the same thing with us sometimes people you know christian you know we come to church we sit in the pews you know we sit there you know every service on on sunday and wednesday we know we come for the second service and we're here we sing the song but we die as a sinners it says that it's not because there is no remedy for it it's not because there is not a blood that was shared on calvary it's not because the holy spirit was not sent he says that because you're refusing to take the very same thing that can save you it says that because you're refusing to take that same remedy that can save you that's why people sometimes die in church coming to church every every day but they die and they go to hell it's because they refuse to take it you know because they refuse it's not because they're blind but because they want to be blind you know from god from god's word and from god's remedy and and and that is really a really bad thing that you know that uh that we can have you know moses his gift could not you know his gift couldn't bring the satisfaction that he wanted to have until he met god and no matter what gift you are no matter how gifted you are you know that will never satisfy you satisfies you until you meet god personally you know you might be a good singer you might be a good musician you might be a good preacher you know without having that experience that gift will never be we never give you the true satisfaction you know matter of fact you will only you know be wondering about why why these are coming to me and why why i don't have peace why why why this and why that because you're missing one essential point you know meeting christ and having the personal relationship with god you know the prophet that moses born and then he was afterwards he was uh brought to the place where he was anointed and notice the seed laying there with an intellectual conception with all the faith that he was born to deliver these people and yet he never come to life until that until that light from the burning bush flashed across it until he seen not something he cried about and not something he read about but something he seen with his eyes something that spoke to him and he spoke back to it oh how or how that that did bring this to that brings to life i think any man with or any man or a woman boy or girl and i think in the intellectual conception of what they think the word is and so forth never can have a full foundation stand until they have made that light brings that brings the word to a reality you know moses is going to the moses is going to pharaoh he did not it he couldn't go you know only based on what he read if it was the case he couldn't flee he couldn't leave egypt because moses was instructed by his mom by his mother and his mother read the bible to him and he knew all those words and he knew all those prophecies he knew his purpose of you know a purpose why he was born but all of that knowing having the knowledge of the entire world never you know that wasn't enough for moses to go and deliver the children of israel you know he had to have that experience as the prophet says that that seed had to meet that light from the burning bush to quicken the seed that was in him you know and and to let god now lead him you know and god god gave him strength to go deliver the people amen and the prophet and and there's a question that i i asked myself one time i said i asked myself this question what have i become since i became a christian you know most of the time when we became a christian many people because i've experienced it with many people it's like if you ask them about the experience they will tell they will always tell you about how they you know they received the message and how you know they were in those pentecostal churches and and you know they receive now they they're saved and they receive the message there is nothing wrong with that i i you know i agree with that but but what have you become since you are now a message believer or what have you become since you became a christian where is your life now where is your walk with christ you know how are you doing now with christ is christ becoming more personal to you or is christ going farther from you you know is christ revealing himself more to you or is christ is hiding himself to you you know those are the questions you know only becoming a christian it's good but you know it's a step that we need to go forward we need to step up you know it's not only they're asking because i remember i had that question because i remember one time one brother one one brother was preaching back and i was sitting and he was preaching about experience you know telling people how how uh you know how uh uh god has been good to him and how you know he sometimes he had to face demons and you know uh uh uh heal the sick and everything so now he asked the the um he asked a question to the church you know he said to the church that you also you have to have the same experience you know of of you know to you you have to be able to tell people how you have experienced god and the brother crowd where your brother shouted from the back saying that you know i would tell them how god saved me how god you know brought me to the to the message how i believe the message of of brother branham yes that is good you know telling them how but that happened 15 years ago you know that happened you know 10 years ago you have to have a living we serve a living god a living god as a god that you know as we're going to have more experience you know it's good you know to tell the people how you received out the grace found you and you believe this message it's good it's it's you know it's wonderful to tell you but that that that's that's not supposed to be our only experience that we have with christ that is not only the experience that someone have with christ you know we have to have a daily a daily experience you know when you woke up in your morning you know when you go tonight you have to have an experience what god has done for you and how you have felt god during the day and you know what how your your walk with with god was and and all those things you know it's a question that i think that we have to ask ourselves constantly what have i become since i became a christian you know where am i now you know does god talk to me more than he was doing before you know well what i'm what are my my experiences you know where am i now with christ how is my work now with christ you know am i failing all the times or am i am i drawing closer to him you know what does people say about me when they see my life why there's people that's my life back up is my life backing up you know everything that i say that i am you know at work i think it was yesterday or the day before yesterday i was talking to a man at work and he asked me a question that was a tricky question to me you know i didn't know it was a tricky question but he asked me a question and when i responded he said that yeah you like it because i wanted to doubt your experience just by your answer by your response but thank god my response was not we did not go against my experience didn't i go against my christianity by the response only only uh vindicated you know my experience to god and it says that i wanted you know i was about to doubt your your your experience or your christianity based on your experience that i was based on the answer that i was giving you know why people watch you when you go somewhere you may not see it where people are looking at you but people are looking at you people watch you people know that you go to church every sunday people know that you go to church every wednesday and people are expecting to have a certain you know life that you have to know that that you need to leave people are expecting to see that though they don't go to church do they don't want to go to church but they know there's a difference between a christian and me there's a difference between someone who knows god and someone who don't know god matter of fact if you do something that is wrong they tell you that i didn't expect you as a christian to do this i didn't expect you as a christian to go where i go or i didn't expect you as a christian to talk as i talk you know there have to be a difference and that difference is not forcing you know you can't force it that difference has to believe you know it has to come from the inside of you you know that has to portray the life of god from the inside from there from the outside that's why the prophet says that the holy spirit comes from the inside out i will read the prophet the prophet says and now we find that and we see that and we see that one that that one time that uh that inoculation wasn't too good there was a conscience there was a conscience always of sin there he was talking about how the blood of animals people were going with for the blood of you know with the blood of animals to to confess their sins and they had to come year by year and they had to come year by year and make it man make it make his offering this offerings year by year after sinning they had to come again and again but now in hebrews it tells us that if the worshiper is once purged he has no more conscience of sin or otherwise no more desire to sin the whole thing's gone for me there is no more you don't have to sin every day you don't have to do this you don't have to do these things you do it because you willfully want to and the reason you willfully want to is because you have never died to yourself oh brother i know that i know that scorching but it's good when you die to yourself then you become a new creature then those things are gone and if you try to act like you are like you've got them before you have it it's like i said the other day like like a black bird trying to to to put the peacock feathers in his wings he says that then he said that you see i'm a peacock now it isn't that that's something that something is stuck in itself you know he has to grow from the inside they from the inside out and that's the way the holy spirit is it's not something you spare on or something like that it's a birth you've got to be born again and this virtues of the holy ghost has to come from the inside out and when the word and when the world and went world and scene and cutting hair and painting and painting comes out against the word of god it shows that the holy spirit the holy spirit is not there that's a direct evidence so what what do you call it he says that i would call it a pentecostal prostitution that that's exactly right committing spiritual fornication with the god of heaven what what a shame a disgrace it is that's horrible yes sir it is it says that you know be you know that thing has to come from the inside out it's something that needs to grow from the inside and when it grows from the inside you'll be able to express it you know remember jesus one time he was asked a question because his disciples were eating without you know washing their hands and and they did they came to him they said that they shouldn't eat without washing their hands because it's not good eating without washing their hands and then jesus told them it's not what what goes into your mouth that that that makes you bad but what what what comes you know out of your mouth you know because it's the inside that needs to be changed first you know the prophet remember the last time i i preached one day on the sermon i forgot the title but uh uh i mentioned that when somebody's born there's a snake and that snake has to be killed i believe it was in iowa city that snake you know inside of the person needs to give this to you know that it needs to be killed before having the dove coming into it you know that's nick it's it's in the inside of you that's the thing that makes you do the wrong things that's the thing that makes you want to steal that they make that they think that makes you want to cheat that the that the thing that's the thing that makes you want to drink that that's the thing that makes you want to cast that's the thing that makes you want to see it and do every bad thing and he said that for you to change it's not only saying that i've changed but it's you know by killing that snake that is inside of you and when you kill that snake that is inside of you then an empty place will be there and then after that you can go to god and ask god you know to fill you with the spirit of adult and when the dove will come to you you will have a nature change you know you will have now you'll be now a new person because the dove inside of you will be able to manifest his character or his nature on the outside and people will notice the change it's not because you wanted to or because you're forcing to it or because you're working that experience out but it's because inside of you something has changed and something that thing that has changed you know is now able to come and to manifest itself on the outside and he said that the prophet says that an experience is something that is real it's not an emotion it's not it's not only an emotional things the human soul cries out for something he knows that there is something that brought it here it knows that there is something that's beyond here they know that they come from from out from uh from out of the night and they go back into the night and they want to know where they come from and where they're going now if that hunger isn't there you can never get it by blightening by blightening your mind but i think a person coming to crust should come with all the intelligence they got and quoting in their mind and quoting in their mind when they come to him every promise in the scripture keep your mind alert when you come to christ don't let it go blank because the devil will make you do anything if you blank if you're coming you know if your mind is blank if you don't have any any promise of god if you don't have any scriptures in you you know the devil can fool you very easily because you don't know your word they'll give you a sensation he can do that he can do that too but you want an experience something that the bible teaches that is something that is real something that you can tell something that you can show something that you can tell the people that really happened to you something that you can come and prove to people that hey this who i was before and and this is how i am now hey i was going through this time and this is how the lord you know brought me out and this is my new song that i can sing you know this is my new life this is my new me and and and people will be able to see that new life and that new you and one of the reasons why people don't have really enough experience with god is because they're still sitting on the fence you know but sitting on the fence is it's an expression that say that you know that shows neutrality that you don't have any position you you you are in the middle you know you don't you're not incorrect you're not going for christ you're not going you know you know you're not serving christ you're not serving you know you're in the middle you're not serving christ fully you know you still have a desire to go back and you still you you have the desire for god sometimes sometimes you have a desire so you're still in the middle you don't you didn't make your decision yet you still on the fence sitting on the fence and you remember uh uh there's a story it's not uh uh that i heard one brother uh i think his brother aaron from uh uh louisiana he preached on sabby mentioned this story it says that he gave a story there was a man i forgot his name but let's say the name the name of the man was mike i hope there is no mike in here but the name of the man was in in uh uh he gave the story when when when uh noah was preaching when noah was preaching he prayed for 140 uh years i believe 20 say 120 years yes he preached for 120 years and it was preaching the same sermon over and over and it says that at the middle of uh you know one time and one time when when no one was preaching he had a big church and in that church was that men mike who was following noah you know he he but no appreciate you have to go into the oh god told me that i need to build the ark and and the people because god will send the flood and people will will die and you have to the only time the only place that you can be saved is to go in the ark mike was there in the church mike say amen the next time the next sunday morning mike comes again in the church he hears the same the same sermon he comes mike spent 20 years the same sermon i have to build the ark you know god told me to build the orchid you have to go into the uh mike says amen mike's now starting to doubt you know what what know what was saying but when is he going to finish building the ark and when when are we going to go there and and after you know uh after the couple years now noah changed his sermon a little bit you know now i'm i'm done building the ark now people needs to go into the ark because god will you know send the flood and mike understood that the only thing that this message is only based on a flood a flood a flood a flood a flood that we don't see now it's been 60 years we don't see a flood when is that flood coming mike now start instead of going fully for the word of god instead of you know choosing his position you know instead of following noah my mic was in defense you know was sitting on the fence you know he was there you know he comes he comes to church and he hears the word of god when he goes to to to his friend he says that they asked him were you in that church where they only preached about flood that we don't even know when is that flood coming oh yes i was no you shouldn't follow that man and but you know mike instead of going forward for it you know mike stops a little bit and after some years mike goes again to the church you know he hears the same message a hundred years passed by you know there is no flood no was still preaching about the same message 119 years you know passed by you know noah still pushing about the same message and and and then and then 119 years now it was like the next year in the in the month of uh uh i think uh uh on may the the 16th you know mike came to church you know noah was preaching about the same about the same subject but mike didn't know that that day was the last day that noah will preach about the same subject you know mike felt something inside of his heart wanted to go to the altar you know praying that god can deliver him that god can save him god can save his life but mike when he looked at his friend his friends looked at him mike was confused mike didn't want to go noah preached that sermon you know the the the last sermon on may the 16th you know but when mike said well i'll go tomorrow because i heard that my friends will be busy tomorrow or tomorrow i will have nothing to do so i can go to the altar and pray or tomorrow i'll be by myself i can easily go to the altar and and nobody will know that i went to the arch nobody would know that i confess my sin nobody will know that i want to make my life grow right with christ you know mike was there when the when the when god was present present to help him or to save him mike didn't go mike put it out for tomorrow and when he came he was when when tomorrow my may the 17th camp came mike was running i have to go to god now because i missed yesterday's opportunity today i can't miss it mike was running to the ark but mike arriving you know like a one miles from the ark where noah was preaching where the church was he said i said that by this time nobody needs to be at the pulpit this time this time noah needs to start a sermon he has to be you know saying these words but mike noticed a little bit of a difference you know noah was not there to preach the same sermon again mike was there he was wondering himself what is going on and he looked at the ark he saw that the yoke was closed he couldn't mike started to think about why didn't i you know go to god yesterday when they went ahead when i had that opportunity to go to god mike was now you know now things now thoughts became not to cross over to cross his mind you know i had this chance you know 10 years ago i felt the same thing but i put it up for tomorrow i heard these things a hundred years ago but i didn't go for it now yesterday i had the same experience i felt god so strongly and i wanted god to forgive me i knew that i wasn't right with god and i wanted god to forgive me but i missed it you know yesterday i felt it i felt like something pulling me out of my chair to go to god to repent for my sin but i missed it now here is too late the door is already closed they say but let me go a little bit and try to knock to the door maybe noah is in there and he can open the door for me mike went and he was crying and he was crying you know as hard as he can he was crying and crying as loud as he can you know he went to the door he knocked it he knocked the door no i was in the ark no i was able to answer him but they know by the answers of noah was not able to satisfy my desire at that time no no i was there no i could preach him the word of god but that word of god couldn't do nothing to him noah the only words that no i could tell him yes i'm here i know that i preached this for 120 years the same message and message today this message or this sermon that i was preaching that people thought that it was a story that i was telling the people today tonight now it's a reality now i'm in the ark by the the sad thing is that i didn't close the ark i didn't close the door god closed the door so i can't open it so there is no way i wanted to i want to help you so bad to come in because i want people to come but i can't i can't open it anymore things don't depend on me anymore i did whatever god told me to do now it's too late for you now it's too late because the door has been closed you know god has closed the door and and and the flood will come and the flood and god will send the rain and the flood for 40 for 40 days so let me tell you in advance that you can't make it without come without being in this ark you know mike started to cry mike mike's crying couldn't save him at this time mike's repentance at that time couldn't save it because he missed the opportunity that god had for him you know don't let this to be a story that we will have to tell the people after missing the rapture that one day i heard about the word of god one day i heard about god send us his son and he preached to us i felt something inside of me i felt something telling me to go to go to the archer i felt something to tell telling me to pray to confess my sin i felt something inside of me telling me that hey i need to make this right i have i have this scene that i need to confess but i failed to do it now it's too late i'm regretting now it's too late i can't make it anymore because they're not even here they're gone they're ruptured they might be here but your door can be close to you you know the same opportunity that you have now don't think that it's the same opportunity that you will have tomorrow that's why you have to stop putting life putting it off tomorrow for tomorrow you know there's a song that i love to listen you know it's a song that someone wrote as a conversation between god and someone you know he says that jesus said you know i am he that that you know that that healeth you and you say that yes jesus i know but uh i'll take care of that tomorrow jesus says that i'm he that saves you yes jesus i know but let me get this first done and i will come to you tomorrow jesus says that i am he that supplies all your needs you say that yes jesus i know all of that but i don't have time now i will have time for you tomorrow tomorrow i will come i will be free from everything tomorrow i'll be free from my homework tomorrow i'll be free from my work i don't work tomorrow tomorrow and saturday so i can come to you and pray as long as i can because i'm free don't think that that same opportunity that you will have tomorrow that you have tonight that the same opportunity that you have tomorrow you know jesus is here knocking at people's door jesus is here he wants to save us that's why that well that's why he even died at the quran calvary for us you know to save our souls to save us but don't put it off for tomorrow you know if you feel something you don't have to come here even wherever you are you can cry you can pray god and you can repent from your sin and god is faithful enough to to to to fill you with the holy spirit god is faithful enough to to provide to your needs god is faithful enough to answer your questions to answer everything to provide to everything that you need you know it doesn't only have to be the holy spirit it can be anything else you need money you need you need strength you need you know you sick your body needs to be healed and you have someone that you're thinking of you have you know people who are not saved you know now is the time you know now the door is still open now is the time you know to come and to open the door for god and to let god now notice the prophet says that at the message the door the prophet says that the way the door of the heart is built there is no way that god can open that door from the outside that door has to be open from the inside it's a personal you know wheel that you have to go you stand up and you open the door but that doesn't mean that god is not knocking god is knocking every time you hear the word of god and something touches you that is god knocking at your door but you have to be willing you have to be strong enough to go to god and to open that door for him and when you open that because god doesn't want to open your door because if he does it to you he will have to repent from every people that he killed during sodom and gomorrah or the time of noah and everything because he didn't do that for them and god cannot do it for you so you have to go god gives you the feeling that is here god touches your heart you know god speaks to you you know god gives you all the material that you need to make you stand up on you from your feet to make you stand out from where you are to go open the door and if you don't take the things and if you don't go and open your door you know there is no way that you blame god because he will tell you that this time and this thing this thing at this place at this hour you know i talked to you and you felt me and you know because god's feeling it's always different than others feeling you know when god is dealing with you you will know it you will feel it when god is about to talk to you you will feel there's something in your heart telling you that this is god and god will remind you about everything because everything that is going on is being recorded you know it's been recorded and one day at the judgment you know that play that tape will be played and you will see when god wanted to talk to you when god wanted to fill you with the holy spirit when god wanted to change you but you rejected god for tomorrow and tomorrow don't think tomorrow you will have the same opportunity that you have now you know now is the day now is the time to go to come and and to you know to receive god let's stand if the musician can come and play uh or fill my cup lord i lift it up to you come and quench this thirsty stole of mine this thirsty heart of mine you know your heart is
