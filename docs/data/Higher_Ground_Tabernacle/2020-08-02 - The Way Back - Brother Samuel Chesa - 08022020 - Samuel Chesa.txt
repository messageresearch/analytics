his house amen it's good to see everyone who was able to come to the second service let's open our books to the book so to the book of judges georges chapter 16 the verse the 27-28 verse you can say amen when we get to it the book of judges chapter 16 the 27-28 verse we'll try not to belong this afternoon many people will be tired we don't want to have a lot of sleeping saints after service amen the 27th chapter reads now the house was full of men and women and all the lords of the philistines were there and they were upon the roof about 3 000 men and women that beheld while samson made sport and samson called unto the lord and said oh lord god remember me i pray thee and strengthen me i pray thee only their swans oh god that i may be at once avenged of the philistines for my two eyes may the lord add blessings to the reading of his word we might be seated let us just pray the heavenly father we approach a throne of grace one more time this afternoon oh god knowing that in the cool of the evening lord that's when you used to meet up with adam oh god and you had communion with him lord here this afternoon we are here for the same reason to communion with you lord but you speak to us lord our ears are open so that you could speak to us and we want to listen to your father our hearts are open lord to receive a word from you lord may you speak through the speaker lord may you hear through the hearer lord at the end of it oh lord we'll be careful to give you thanks and praises now that we have read your word oh god i just pray oh god that you give ancient lord to the scriptures but you quicken them lord because we know that that the let alone killeth oh father but we know it's your spirit oh father that quicken it and give it life oh god be with us this afternoon in jesus christ's name i pray believing amen just for a short moment i want to speak on the subject a way back the verse the scripture that we read it was of um samson we all know samson when he was born an angel came and told the his parents that we're gonna give you that you're going to give birth to a son and he's going to be the one to deliver israel out of the hands of the philistines and back in those days judges god brought judges one after the other and now it was samson's stern to bring victory to the house of israel but the verse that we read we understand that samson after a very long time after he had he was killing the philistines he forgot the purpose that he was brought onto this earth for and he fell victim to the cause that he was supposed that he was born and the prophet of god tells us that samson represents a church that has lost his hold on god and what he did he sold his birthright to a woman to a woman delilah that's what he did and he went out to flirt with the world now samson represents us he represents israel and we are spiritual israel amen and the prophet of god tells us that satan does not have access to you but you are the one who has to go out to go to him and this is what samson did he left the he left the land of israel and he went to the enemy he went to play with the enemy that's what got him in trouble and we find many times that's what we do we know are all human paul said i die daily we fall we get up and we get going but in iniquity you know what you were doing this is what samson did and he went out and that's how he got himself into trouble but we and us we are not supposed to do that we are supposed to stay in the heritage that god gave us the cause that we were born on this earth for amen we are the bride of christ we know we are born for a purpose to be in this last days we are the ones who are supposed to be reflecting the life of christ to the world because christ said for a little while he will the world will not see me where will he be he will be in you and me that's where the world is going to see christ because we are reflecting him we are mrs jesus christ hallelujah so that's what we ought to do now samson he was falling victim to the very reason he was born and he was a slave to that very cause we know there's a certain woman daughter dinah we read of her in the book of genesis 34 it says um indiana the daughter of lear which she bear unto jacob went out to see the daughters of the land and when she came the son of hemer the hevite prince of the country saw her he took her and lay with her and defiled her if she had lea jacob's daughter if she had remained in the land of her heritage where she was to stay she wasn't going to get into trouble but it's because she left the land of protection she left god's protection and she went out to flirt with the enemy that's what god that's what got her and many times we fall prey to that we get so relaxed after sunday during the week you go out there you forget who you are and then you start flirting with the with the devil and you start flirting with the world then you realize oh where am i what have i done it's because you've left the land of your heritage you have left what what the of the land of protection where god plays you so we are not supposed to be like that and now samsung when he was born he was given a covenant he was supposed not to to shave off his seven locks that's where the power laid and that's what he was supposed to bring victory with and throughout his life we have many testimonies brother samson he had many testimonies of how god had brought victory through him one time he was in gaza and they locked him up and they put heavy iron gates and they wanted to attack him but the prophet of god tells us that samsung he was a very little man and surprisingly this little man he got up he uprooted all those uh steel gates and went out and ran away and he killed those philistines it was because he had surrendered himself to god so all these testimonies that was how god was working with samson but in the scripture that we read he had given here he had given up he had given in to delilah and he had sold himself to the devil and now he was in he was now in this place and he was crying he said lord i pray thee only this once or god that i may be avenged of the philistines for my two eyes and the prophet of god tells us that these two eyes they're not physical eyes they're spiritual eyes so that's what the devil is going to try to do to you and me he is going to try and pluck out our spiritual eyes and bring canality in us we are not going to be able to see the word we are so busy we are not reading our bibles we are not listening to the tape your spiritual vision gets blurry amen the prophet of god said whatever you feed most that's what grows if you feed the natural man he's gonna get bigger than the spiritual man and he's always dwarfing him but when if you feed the spiritual man more he will get bigger and he'll be able to subdue the natural man so that's that's that's what we are supposed to do make sure we have our spiritual eyes and that's what the devil does when he's attacking you has to make sure your eyes are out so you cannot see what god is telling you amen so he was standing there reminiscing as he was standing there he hears all these philistines they're making a lot of noise and he is reminiscing all the victories that god had brought him through because they had shaved off his locks where his power laid and his secret was gone but then he remembered one time when he was locked and he had a thousand philistine soldiers around him and remember samson was not trained he was not military trained but because he had surrendered himself to god and he had allowed god to have full preeminence in his life and he gave everything his body he had given it to god when the philistines came to attack him he just took the thing that was closest to him a dry job on the prophet of god describes it and say it was so dry that if you just hit it on a rock it was going to come apart it was just going to crush into powder but because it was in a it was in the hands of a man who had surrendered himself to god he slew a thousand trained military man so whatever it is it don't matter how little you might think just surrender yourself to god god will have a lot of victories through you many times the devil tries to tell you that you are nothing he tries to belittle you but because if you just surrender yourself to god pray and say lord have preeminence in me oh god he is able to have a lot of victories through you and now he was remembering all this all these testimonies he had he was remembering the victories he had won but now it was gone because he had sold out he had sold out his birthright to the philistines he had sold out his birthright to delilah and now he was praying lord just once more may you please give me this strength so that i might be able to avenge the philistines and there he was now the prophet of god tells us that samson is the top of the church and now the church has done the same thing we have denominationalized organized the moment we organize the church loses the power the moment the church rejects the leadership of the holy ghost and takes heed to the leadership of the men then it's done god does not dwell in such a place we try to confine god in a system god does not god does not do that god is a spirit and we are supposed to leave god to have liberty in although just once more the prophet of god said i challenge any persons to show me any place in history since the church first organized which was the roman catholic church at nicaea rome when the catholic church was organized and made an organization and has any church from martin luther this side when god gave martin luther the revelation of justification and as soon as luther was gone they made an organization out of it they were worse than what they came from and it fell along came worsely after him and asbury and so forth they made an organization out of it and it fell along came alexander campbell and it fell with the organization along came john smith now he's talking about the pentecostals just before his time and it fell and every time that man has tried to organize something of a man-made system it fell and never did rise again this is not no history no way where any church that have ever organized but what did fall and everyone fell and never rose again the children of israel in tap was to follow the pillar of fire and every night they must be ready not to organize the sea down there but to move with the fire the moment you put god out of the equation then a system starts forming when moses went up to get the commandments from god the children of israel already had a system they were already building the golden calf and had us and they were now yielding themselves to the leadership of a man dayton and cora leading them into pagan worship that's what happens the moment you leave god out of the equation the prophet of god was coming down and i'm gonna bring it further now that the prophet of god is gone now we are starting the message people we are now starting to organize and we are going to the leadership of man and delivering the holy spirit just like the what the pentecostals did but that's not what what's going to happen the omega bride just like the alpha bride is not going to get organized some might try to but we will not there will be a people that will still stand and refuse organization and stand because there is a people who shall be called bride we are called bride and we will not be organized amen we'll keep on yielding ourselves to the spirit to the leadership of the spirit and one place the prophet of god said i did not come to build an organization but i came to build a powerhouse individual powerhouses i'm looking at powerhouses right now we don't yield to no man-made creeds no man-made doctrines that are not even based on scriptures but we are powerhouses because god when god is going to come for his bride he's going to look for something that is similar to him a powerhouse we know jesus christ is the greatest powerhouse there is no devil can stand before him that's why he allowed you and me to be powerhouses when he is going to come he's going to come and find something that looks like him because i like a truck alike the prophet of god gives an example of a magnet he went to this factory and this magnet was going on top it was picking up every metal that was lying on the ground and he thought he said oh that's just the way jesus is going to do when he is going to come he's going to look for everything that looks like him when it is when he's going to come to take his bride he's not going to look for anything else he's going to look for the holy ghost that he gave to you and me like the pastor was preaching early on the holy ghost we are not just supposed to end there but it is to make way for the very person of christ to step within us amen that's what christ is going to come and look for the other time when we were talking about the grace covenant we're talking about how abraham god made a covenant with abraham uh uh how he when when he his grace covenant with abraham it was of his son christ when he was going to crucify him on the earth and what he did when he crucified him god took the body and he sat on the right hand side of god and he took his spirit away so it was jesus christ the body he took it apart he took the body and he sent down the spirit to you and me so when he is going to come to look for his bride he's going to find for that missing part that part only that's supposed to dovetail with what was there in the beginning so the omega bride that's what we are supposed to hold on to to make sure nothing changes that very holy ghost that fell on the day of pentecost that's the very same one god is going to come and look for amen so the children of israel organized the moment he went to go get those ten commandments but god doesn't live in a place where he's formulated to live in a golden calf and they say that is our god god does not stay there that's why he was angry and he had to bring he brought judgment so as it was in the first exodus is going to be the same in the third exodus if we do the same thing then are we that special that is not going to bring judgment to us no sir the moment we start putting god out we are inviting judgment to us but we realize that instead of the children of israel just taking 10 days to cross from egypt to their promised land they took 40 years what was god doing he was beating out all those systems out all those generations those two million people who were carrying the egyptian systems out he was beating that he was beating that um those systems out so he could have a pure people and instead of 10 day instead of 10 days they took 40 years but you look in these 40 years i believe god had had a plan a separate plan as it was going on remember when i believe when they got out rahab was not yet born so if the children of israel were going to take 10 days to move from egypt to canaan rehab was not going to be there and rahab was a special peace that had to be grafted in to bring christ because christ's lineage was linked to rahab and the prophet of god tells us that in his days he was saying the rapture is nigh any time it can happen and if it happens god it will be still in god's time but look we are now here why did god delay he is giving us an extra time he was given an extra time for you and me the rapture could have could have happened back then but 95 percent of the people in here were not yet born back then what was god doing he was making sure he was giving you and i time to be grafted in so that we could realize our full potential to realize who we are so we could he could get us in so we are not supposed to waste this time that god has given us for an extra time we gotta be awoke and brace up ourselves and fight because we realize god given us an extra time amen just like he did for rahab he is doing the same for you and me giving us enough time to realize because if it had happened back then you and i would have been out of the plan but god is graceful he is merciful to you and me amen so going back to samson he was standing there he had no power muscles still there just as he was before it was just a form of godliness but with no power thereof that's what we have done people now in the message we focus on big churches how big is your church that's what matters now what matters is not the word it's not what's being preached but we are now looking at these mega churches and everything that's what we are focusing big revivals but there is no power that's what we are doing and it has become a ritual and we become so realized because we are in the message that doesn't mean a thing because the the devil knows that there is a message the demons know that there is a message just the same as you are saying the same as these people are saying that don't save you but we're gonna come in to realize we need the power of god back in the church we need the power of god working in our midst to show that we are a church of the living god amen it has just become a ritual people just coming to church sit and go back home for what people don't people now no little know their real reason to come here on earth but the people have to realize that they have to get back to the beginning what god had for us to get that holy ghost to be a people representing christ we are christ ambassadors amen and in doing this we can say samson lost the title deed that he was given to him and the title did the prophet of god calls it an abstract title deed which adam had and at the fall when adam fell he lost the title deed and the devil wanted to get a hold of it but before he could get a hold of it god took it back that was the original honor and what was written in this title deed dominion over all the earth adam when he was naming all the animals and the power he had all the nature and everything it was lost but satan before he could get a hold of it god took it back to himself and now jesus christ we know he is our second adam he made a way back for us to get back that title deed when he was crucified on the cross of calvary amen those three days before he rose up he went to hell kicked the devil and took back the title deed now it is now available for you and me i will read the uh god's provided place of worship it says and when you become a christian and accept christ as your savior then god sends down the abstract it shows that no matter what your father did no matter what your mother did what anybody else did your mother daddy might have been a drunkard prostitutes whatever it was every sin is tricking off that gives an answer to a lot of people who say who think that what well what their ancestors did has an effect on them that has no effect if you come to get this abstract title deed amen you've got an abstract title there's nothing can put you off of it and look everything that's on the ground belongs to you and when you are in jesus christ by the baptism of the holy ghost every gift of god belongs in the church it's an abstract title deed it's yours it belongs to you it quickens your mortal bodies oh my if we'll think of it so this was where samson was he lost that deed he no longer had the power he tried to stand there remember the victories but he could no longer have it why because he had lost his birthright he had lost the power that god had invested in him and there he was just regretting he was saying lord just once more because the power was gone but now that's the condition of the church some people they don't even realize that but if we can only come to a place of realization that we have to cry and say lord just once more where we was where we was before when god gave us the holy ghost fighting these battles if we would just go back to that i remember david of old when he was crying lord created me a clean heart after he had done wrong trying to get back he was he remembered what how it felt having god with him and he felt so vulnerable not having god and he was crying lord please restore unto me the joy of your salvation this is the place where samson was he remembered the joy he had when he was overcoming the philistines now that was gone they were making fun of a man of god whom who who used to whom when the when the philistines heard his name they would run away but they were now rallied against him around him laughing at him they were blaspheming god this is what we do we are christ representatives we are supposed to be representing christ when we start doing wrong we are putting a bad reflection on jesus christ because we are we are his bride so we got to make sure wherever we are we know we are representing god however we talk we are reflecting jesus wherever we go to we are reflecting jesus however way we handle our matters we are reflecting jesus so we got to make sure that we are having a proper representation of christ because we might bring blaspheme to the name of god because we are the people that god decided to place his name in amen and he was he was seated there regretting crying lord please just once more avenge me of my two eyes he wanted those spiritual eyes back because he knew that without it he cannot make it he doesn't have that connection with god but when you have that proper connection with god know that there is nothing that is impossible and he cried he said lord let me die we got to come to that place where we want to die to ourselves not physically die but die to all of us to all of our sins because that's the only way we come back to god we got to come to a place of repentance that's what a righteous man is the prophet of god he gives a definition of a righteous man a righteous man is a man whom when he falls he gets back up it doesn't mean that if you are righteous you don't sin but the moment you fall down you get back up and keep on going and we have a promise that says in the bible many other afflictions of the righteous but it doesn't end there it says many other afflictions of the righteous but god delivers out of them all and now this was where samson was he was at a place of repentance remembering and he wanted the power of god back with him and he was crying lord let me die let me avenge of my two eyes and he remembered the cause that he was brought here on earth he was supposed to bring victory to the to the jews back to the israelites and there he was vulnerable and he knew he had to do this one last time and then he was he was crying lord one more time i'm willing to pay the price that's well that's where we're gonna come to you we're gonna come to a point when we are repenting repenting is not just a matter of saying i did this i did that it is a matter of turning around going back totally changing the course of direction that is what repentance is all about saying lord i'm tired i'm done please come and help me that's all he had to say was lord please save me that's all he had to do and he cried lord let me die i'm willing to pay the price and then he said lord is there a possibility the philistines were over there just looking at him laughing they didn't know what was going on but samsung was having a revival where he was there and then he started feeling the locks touching his shoulders and he started flexing his muscles and he felt the power of god coming back to him oh if we could realize that that's what we have to do to if we come to a place of repentance to have god back in our lives there is nothing that can stop him from coming back because god is so willing to fill you more than you want to be filled you gotta get right back the title deed the abstract title deed has to be given back into you your hands and my hands the prophet god says when the abstract has come it struck off omitted everything amish abstract hold it then as sure as the spirit that raised christ from the dead i have an abstract deed that i'm a part of that body with the abstract of the holy ghost making that body of word leave out just exactly like he did it him as he promised in the last day the abstract my sins are struck out all your sins are struck out by the blood of jesus christ unlike in the old testament the blood of the animals they just covered their sins but the blood of jesus doesn't do that it wipes it clean the only thing jesus christ cannot do is remember your sins so when you come to him in true repentance he is not going to remember none of that so the devil your accuser he cannot come back to you and point you in at what you did all we have to do is stop playing church stop going to the things we are not supposed to be doing and turn to god and say lord just one more time lord and say lord we are willing to die to our sins we are willing to die and raise up in the power of the holy ghost and all my sins is struck out by the blood of jesus christ and the holy ghost is come as an abstract to the title deed and god gave me that by grace by foreknowledge before you were born that was yours before you had gotten into that place before samsung was was in that place of here before he had sold out his secret to delilah by foreknowledge that was given to him the victory was given to him you see when you start failing it is not on god but it is on you when you leave the principles of god that's when troubles will start falling on you all we just have to do is get back into the world where christ put us this is where this is where samsung was at he just had to get back on course to get back on the cause that god had brought him on the earth for and he says what are you scared about he said fear not i am he that was dead and alive again i'm alive forevermore and they have the keys of death and hell don't worry about nothing even death ain't gonna hurt you notice the abstract title the debt is settled everything against it has been struck off he says it might act silly but this is really good and abstract deed do you realize what that means there is nothing that can take it away from you i'm a holder the moment you have that deed satan cannot touch it you have power back the power that adam lost it is back with you you have dominion over everything it is for you to use god has given us to use whilst we are here on earth to have this victory he says i now what did i now have cashed in on my beneficiary his dirt his burial and resurrection and he became me that i might become him he became sin so that we might become his righteousness hallelujah he became a sinner amen so that we could become sons and now we can walk and just say we are sons of god because of that title deed those signs shall follow them that believe that's the abstract title deed so samsung was right there in that place he is calling lord please just one more time feel me one more time and tears started feeling those sockets those empty sockets where his eyes used to be they didn't realize that he was getting his spiritual eyes back and he was crying lord just one more time he said lord i want to feel it one more time again and the lord had his prayer god said if my people who are called by my name if they humble themselves and pray i will hear from heaven and i will come down and i will heal their land this is what god was coming he was coming down back on the scene where samson was eyes tears filling in his uh eyeless sockets and he asked the boy and he said lead me to where the two posts are we need that word to lead us to that place where we gotta have the victory back because that's where only we can find our victory and he started walking and you went there by those two pillars this philistines didn't realize what was going on he was standing right there he's feeling his muscles flexing he started feeling that power coming back and he's crying lord just one more time lord give me victory one more time i'm willing to die to what i have done before i'm sorry lord for what i've done just one more time come lord feel me may you avenge me of these philistines that's what we ought to do the cause that we were brought on this earth we are supposed to destroy all the devils old shin that comes our way because we know god is our mighty conqueror he is the king of kings we are the kings and we are supposed to do what kings do we are supposed to overcome everything that comes our way we just gotta repent and ask god to come and have full preeminence in our lives and just cry lord just one more time come feel us and he was standing right there the back of many and he was there and he started pushing those pillars still praying lord avenge me of those philistines and then he pulled he started feeling the strength coming back the logs were coming back that's what we got to do get that holy spirit back on track get it back within you and god will start working wonders the testimonies you used to have back then he will start doing that with you all those signs and wonders he promised to you and me is gonna start happening back again if we pray for the holy spirit to come back down on us and there he was he was pushing lord one more time and he gave that final push and the whole building came tumbling down three thousand philly stands died that day and he had the greatest victory that he ever had in his whole life because he had tried to go back to where he had come from he was gone back lord just one more time give me that strength if we are if we are able to get into that position this afternoon to say lord what we had in the beginning when we met you lord we need that same strength we miss having that connection we miss that joy of our salvation if we are just able to say lord just one more time come feel us he is able to do it he is able to open our spiritual eyes he is able to give us that strength that overcoming power that sin that used to have a hold in you that dirty habit that used to have a hold in you it won't have no claim on you when you cry just once more lord all those evil things that you know you were doing it will stop because a man would have because you would have surrendered yourself to god and allow him to have full preeminence in your life if you just cried just one more time the lord will open a way back for you to get back where you were coming from amen because when he is going to come he's going to come and find a perfect bride a bride that resembles him a perfect bride that's in the stage of a perfect man and that's the only way the holy spirit will beat us into what christ is looking for amen just like the gold a gold panner when the when they are beating that goal they're going to beat it until it's pure until they can see a reflection of their face in that gold that's what god is trying to do for you and me this evening he is trying those trials that's coming our way it's for us to overcome but we cannot overcome it if we don't have the holy ghost but if we cry just one more time lord we are able to go through it and we are purified until god can see himself through us he can see himself when he is looking at us and we are like christ cause that's what he's looking for if we are only able to cry just once more lord he will be able to hear your cry amen

to start at the 23rd verse i have received of the lord that which also i deliver i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sucked saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this to e as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's deathly come wherefore whosoever eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink up that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eat it and drink damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body but this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when you are judged we are chastened of the lord that ye should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that he come not all together unto condemnation and the rest will i set an order when i come those of you who are participating may come up forward as i break the bread and then i'll pray over it dear heavenly father we thank you o god for your grace and your mercy we thank you for the breaking of the bread father we pray that you would bless each and every soul who are participating tonight if there be some sick and afflicted we pray father god that you will heal them lord for your prophet told us that there was virtue in the cup so we thank you lord dear jesus for everything that you do for us today and everything you've done for us we know that within ourselves we're not worthy but we're standing on the promises lord in your grace so we thank you right now as we honor you today through the breaking of the bread and the drinking of the wine not of what you will do but what you have already done for us dear jesus keep us in your care as we pray in jesus christ's name amen and when he had given thanks he'd break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this student remembers of me let us eat [Music] after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sup saying this is the cup for the new testament in my blood this dude is often and she's drinking in remembrance of me [Music] [Music] um [Music] thank god for us [Music] we're done so [Music] [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] the waters [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] you are the others [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] my [Music] even though [Music] we

psalms 32 this was one of the scriptures that when god saved me amen he gave me the scripture i read it and never fully understood it until i came to this message beginning at the first verse it says blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is the man unto whom the lord imputed not iniquity and whose part whose spirit there is no guile brother branham said that's

sin unto thee and my iniquities have i not heard i said i would confess my transgressions unto the lord and thou forgaveth the iniquities of my sins salah so i thank god for that this is what we were
