[43:07] as we stand thank God for the song
[43:13] service appreciate our brother Frank
[43:16] stepping in for us sometimes things do
[43:25] happen
[43:26] you always need someone as a backup
[43:31] second Corinthians please as we stand at
[43:35] the reading of the word the last week we
[43:40] dealt with the creation of God in you
[43:43] and we're just kind of stemming from
[43:45] that it's kind of working with that
[43:48] still I thought I had ended that thought
[43:51] pretty much I have but you know when it
[43:57] comes to God no man no man or God
[44:02] salvation no man will be able to boast
[44:05] it's all God's doing yeah
[44:10] didn't come to God God came to us and
[44:14] every time I think about this book how
[44:16] fantastic it is and how wonderful this
[44:19] book is it's inexhaustible and this is
[44:23] just the book of redemption it's not
[44:26] talking about after it what's going to
[44:29] happen after redemption is over see we
[44:32] don't have a book for that oh my god but
[44:36] I can hardly wait a man to see what it's
[44:39] all about
[44:40] if redemption was this good can you
[44:44] imagine what its gonna be afterwards
[44:46] every time when I read that quote with
[44:48] the Prophet God says oh that man says do
[44:51] you really think that everybody's gonna
[44:53] live here on earth he says no God didn't
[44:55] say that we'll be here a man will be
[44:58] said but think about all of these worlds
[45:01] these moons and he's sick every man can
[45:04] tent cities if you all of us got tent
[45:08] cities and they'd be as big as Jerusalem
[45:13] who won't fit they gotta have other
[45:16] places amen but you know I love the Lord
[45:19] because Sciences are trying to figure
[45:21] out how wide and vastest thing is and
[45:24] you know and I know it's still going on
[45:28] there's still explosions happening they
[45:31] still stars moving right it will never
[45:35] stop until God says stop so we thank God
[45:39] for His grace and His mercy like I said
[45:42] I'm glad to have our brother - but I
[45:44] actually thought it was coming last week
[45:46] but I lost my phone so I lost all my
[45:48] data but this week is perfect we
[45:52] appreciate him
[45:53] second Corinthians first chapter how
[45:57] many of us believe that God is creating
[45:59] himself in us now I believe that with
[46:04] all my heart I don't know exactly how
[46:06] he's doing it but he's doing it amen
[46:10] 1st Corinthians 1:22 22 for all the
[46:14] promises of God in him are yay and in
[46:19] him a man unto the glory of God by us
[46:24] now he which establishes us with you in
[46:28] Christ and have anointed us in is God
[46:31] who have also sealed us and given us the
[46:36] earnest of the Spirit in our hearts I
[46:39] was talking with a young man the other
[46:42] day and he takes me he says he's a young
[46:44] brother in Christ he says what this is
[46:46] Abba Father means what I said is it's
[46:49] just our father when he when he when he
[46:54] was telling his disciples when they
[46:57] asked him how to pray and he says Abba
[46:59] Father he said our Father you're part of
[47:03] the family not just my father Oh Lord
[47:08] bless me according to the Father G of
[47:10] Jesus you know no we are all in the
[47:13] family amen my subject tonight just with
[47:18] this scripture along will be no broken
[47:21] promises God never breaks a promise
[47:27] let us bow father God we come before you
[47:31] and we thank you for your grace and your
[47:32] mercy we thank you for being so good to
[47:35] us and Lord without us without you Lord
[47:39] we are nothing but as we think about
[47:42] your vastness we can't even comprehend
[47:44] how great you are you are self above all
[47:48] Lord and there is no God like you and
[47:51] father God we thank you for being part
[47:54] of you O God and we thank you Lord for
[47:57] all of your creation everything that you
[47:59] have done for us we thank you bless this
[48:03] service here tonight and father would be
[48:05] careful to give you the praise the glory
[48:07] and the honor in Jesus Christ's name we
[48:09] pray amen
[48:11] you may be seated pre adventure we may
[48:15] not be long it all depends on what God
[48:17] wants to do one of the things that I
[48:23] love about God is that he always keeps
[48:27] his appointment and he is
[48:32] oh there be not one person that will be
[48:37] able to say well God I came to church
[48:40] but you wasn't there
[48:42] not if the word is being preached not if
[48:49] there are two or three because Jesus
[48:51] says were two or three are gathered in
[48:53] my name I am there and the only time we
[48:57] come to church and at least in this
[49:00] church and don't see God is because
[49:04] you're not looking for him but I've
[49:07] never had a time in this fellowship
[49:10] where God didn't show up it all depends
[49:15] on what you're looking for if you keep
[49:20] your mind in such a simple place you
[49:24] will always see God our precious brother
[49:30] was and I would at a restaurant today
[49:33] and who basil and they gave you know
[49:36] those little cookies I don't using this
[49:38] with that stuff but we were just talking
[49:42] about God and what God is doing you know
[49:47] in his life and he was just talking and
[49:50] something just moved me to open up that
[49:51] cookie it was so perfect such an answer
[49:56] to and vindication to what God is doing
[49:59] in his life I read it I said here
[50:01] brother keep that because God see if you
[50:09] if you if you're not looking if you're
[50:11] not spiritual you'll miss it and God
[50:15] just came right on the scene it just and
[50:18] it brought an atmosphere it wasn't just
[50:21] opening up a cookie it literally brought
[50:24] in all an atmosphere and it's amazing
[50:30] how we who are chosen elected by God can
[50:35] see him I see God every day every day I
[50:44] see him
[50:45] now in in thoughts you know a lot of
[50:49] times we we always recognize the
[50:52] thoughts of the devil but we never
[50:54] praise God for his thoughts
[50:58] it is his thoughts who tells you don't
[51:01] listen to that reject that but we always
[51:07] tell all the devil is fighting why we
[51:10] need to change that to the place where
[51:15] we could say God is gaining victory
[51:17] every day because like I said the mind
[51:23] is where the battleground is and in
[51:26] order for us to achieve perfection
[51:29] we must subdue every enemy and you know
[51:33] as I said the enemy comes in three
[51:36] categories he comes by the lust of the
[51:38] flesh the lust of the eye and the pride
[51:41] of life and even John said if we
[51:45] overcome these things hmm when you
[51:49] overcome you get the reward
[51:52] now you saw what brothers what am I
[51:54] trying to say
[51:55] see when you really love God I said this
[51:58] last week when do you come to see that
[52:02] God is real see we pass from hope hope
[52:08] is something that you're hoping for you
[52:13] don't think you it's not certain it will
[52:15] happen
[52:16] faith is certainty see and I don't hope
[52:24] that I'm saying I know that I'm saying
[52:27] ha because the faith that I have has
[52:31] become sight and when we think about God
[52:38] who is our Creator and Isaiah says in
[52:42] Isaiah 54 not only these are our Creator
[52:45] but he's our husband and think about it
[52:50] just the thought that I believe that uh
[52:52] brother John someone spoke this to me
[52:54] the other day because I was dealing with
[52:56] husband and wives and he
[52:58] said think about it as a bride of Jesus
[53:00] Christ we love to say we're the Bride of
[53:04] Christ but we don't realize what Jesus
[53:08] or God did for his bride his bride Jesus
[53:12] laid down his life for his bride and
[53:16] every husband should have the same
[53:20] anointing about his bride right if that
[53:25] man would have that kind of anointing
[53:28] about his wife it would change
[53:30] everything that if God put him together
[53:34] now but God put together but for the
[53:39] norm you and I must understand him in
[53:41] the love of God that is shared abroad in
[53:44] our hearts he's supposed to reflect him
[53:47] even in that situation oh come on
[53:51] somebody see that's how they do to get
[53:54] caught we get choir they get quiet but
[53:56] it's true if we're gonna be like him we
[54:00] must be like him in every aspect I'm
[54:04] allowed to do that one scripture love
[54:07] your wife as Christ loved the church I'm
[54:10] still working on it
[54:13] and I'm being honest right because every
[54:17] time you think you got a handle on it
[54:19] the love of God unfolds itself even more
[54:24] is that right thank God he didn't say to
[54:28] love your wives as Abraham loved his
[54:31] wife let's put it like this as Abram not
[54:36] Abraham so you know because here this
[54:39] man loved himself more than he loved God
[54:43] and when we get married I don't know
[54:47] where I'm going where I'm going here
[54:48] because promises are made and when God
[54:52] marry you promises are made is that
[54:56] right and God has never broken a promise
[55:00] to his wife ever
[55:03] now we're human and we have flashing we
[55:06] have we're gonna have failures but when
[55:08] we fail in our promises we need to renew
[55:11] our problem
[55:13] if those promises can be renewed y'all
[55:16] understand what I'm saying now Jesus
[55:19] never he he will never God will not
[55:22] either even through the prophet Samuel
[55:25] Samuel told Saul he said don't do
[55:28] nothing I'll be back when I get back we
[55:33] can offer up to the Lord what needs to
[55:35] be offered but Saul
[55:37] couldn't wait somehow he just did not
[55:41] believe he couldn't take a grass samia's
[55:45] promise by faith that's what happens to
[55:49] us when we cannot we see the word we've
[55:53] heard the word we know the word and yet
[55:56] we have a problem waiting because God
[56:01] said they that wait upon the Lord they
[56:04] will renew their strength and the Bible
[56:08] says in your patience possess ye or
[56:12] so-and-so got in trouble because he did
[56:18] not wait he must have forgotten that
[56:22] samuel was the voice of God for that day
[56:24] and if God has spoken through Samuel he
[56:28] should have recognized that was God and
[56:31] not the man and he couldn't wait and he
[56:34] got out of position and he offered up a
[56:37] sacrifice and he was not a priest
[56:40] hallelujah see that's what people don't
[56:43] understand even when it comes to women
[56:46] preachers women preachers they were God
[56:49] call me God told me yes no doubt he did
[56:53] because you kept traveling him right you
[56:57] didn't want to accept truth so God will
[57:00] give you a lie he'll let is that right
[57:03] he told Balaam not to go down there and
[57:06] curse the children of Israel but Balaam
[57:09] was discharged
[57:10] to curse the children of Israel and God
[57:13] tried to prevent it from happening but
[57:16] he was so money stricken he had to go do
[57:20] it
[57:21] so God allow him to find a way
[57:25] to curse Israel because every time you
[57:28] see you got to understand this bride of
[57:31] Jesus Christ can never be cursed and we
[57:35] need to walk in the atmosphere a blessed
[57:39] not cursed
[57:41] blessed and when we walk in that
[57:44] atmosphere blessed amen it literally
[57:47] like the scripture says it literally
[57:50] builds a wall of fire about you no
[57:54] danger no harm nothing can touch you is
[57:58] that right that's what the prophet god
[58:00] said he says seeing the Satan can't get
[58:03] into you he said you gotta walk out to
[58:07] him for him to get victory over you who
[58:10] my god
[58:11] think about it Amen that these promises
[58:14] that God is made to us it will shall
[58:18] happen there's nothing above around the
[58:23] earth can ever stop a promise of God but
[58:26] the problem is we need to learn how to
[58:28] wait no promise can ever be broken God
[58:35] is so particular about his promises he
[58:37] told her Simon I'm coming to your house
[58:41] and did you know Jesus knew he was gonna
[58:44] be made fun of
[58:46] but he told Simon I'm coming and he goes
[58:50] to Simon's house Simon's a Pharisee
[58:52] right
[58:52] so he tells all of his buddies all of
[58:55] his buddies is all my we go have some
[58:57] fun now with that Nazarene we're gonna
[59:01] go and we're gonna make fun we're gonna
[59:02] have wheel and do what we're gonna do is
[59:04] that right so what did they do here when
[59:08] Jesus come they didn't wash his feet
[59:10] Simon didn't didn't give him a kiss like
[59:13] we do we come right at church we don't
[59:16] wash his feet we don't give him a kiss
[59:18] we sit there like a bump on the log
[59:21] hallelujah but when you come in the
[59:23] church you need to fall down somewhere
[59:26] in your spirit on your need however you
[59:29] the reverence of God should be in this
[59:31] place come amen
[59:34] kissing him listen if you come in here
[59:36] with praise and worship that's like
[59:38] kissing Jesus
[59:39] when you come in here with worship and
[59:42] brave guess what you the one that's
[59:44] rewarded search the scriptures every
[59:47] time his real worship God and praise God
[59:50] even in sacrifice they were the one that
[59:54] left with the blessing here was this
[59:56] woman him in an adulterous woman you
[1:00:00] know I like it that woman like the woman
[1:00:02] of America America's head even has so
[1:00:06] many husbands but anyway she comes and
[1:00:09] she's began to wash his feet and
[1:00:11] everybody is looking at her she's the
[1:00:14] spectacle of the service she's the one
[1:00:17] jumping she's the one shouting she's the
[1:00:20] one that's praising God hallelujah she's
[1:00:23] the one that's weeping she everybody
[1:00:25] have their own way of worship so I'm
[1:00:27] saying jumping running whatever you're
[1:00:29] where worship is you supposed to give
[1:00:31] that to him and so as he began to wash
[1:00:35] his feet she covered his body she's not
[1:00:37] in him right but this is the part when
[1:00:41] she got down to his dirty feet she began
[1:00:44] to take that hand and wash it
[1:00:46] he didn't make her no promise matter of
[1:00:50] fact she was the outcasts of Israel
[1:00:51] she's the scum of the earth but one
[1:00:54] thing she had that those Pharisees did
[1:00:57] not have and that was representation in
[1:01:02] their eyes he was a she was a prostitute
[1:01:05] but in his eyes she was the daughter of
[1:01:07] Zion hallelujah that's the same with us
[1:01:11] no matter what the world look at you and
[1:01:13] they can say whatever they want to say
[1:01:15] but you and I have representation in the
[1:01:19] eyes of God with sons and daughters of
[1:01:21] God being formed is shaped into his
[1:01:25] image he doesn't break his promises if
[1:01:30] he told you he's gonna give you the
[1:01:32] whole ego don't you fret he's gonna give
[1:01:33] you the whole ego
[1:01:34] he said if you repent and be baptized in
[1:01:37] the name of Jesus Christ you will and
[1:01:39] she'll receive the Holy Ghost but listen
[1:01:42] the equation has to be right the word
[1:01:44] repentance you must repent now if you
[1:01:49] repent I give you the Holy Ghost he
[1:01:51] didn't save your baptized
[1:01:53] he said repent then baptize y'all hear
[1:01:56] me that's why you see well you said well
[1:01:58] repent from everything I was telling
[1:02:01] somebody the other day I said you know
[1:02:03] how we've labored so many times
[1:02:05] Lord I want the Holy Ghost and failing
[1:02:07] to see the labor that you laboring is
[1:02:10] not the right laboring is laboring to
[1:02:12] yield hmm
[1:02:16] laboring to surrender all of your
[1:02:20] thoughts all of your desires all of your
[1:02:23] will to God everything right because
[1:02:26] that's how it is in labor even when they
[1:02:28] teach to women the whole thing about
[1:02:31] producing a baby is you're learning how
[1:02:33] to yield don't fight it
[1:02:36] yield to it right and that is what God
[1:02:40] is telling us we need to learn how to
[1:02:42] yield to God in order to get from God
[1:02:45] what we won't because God will not marry
[1:02:49] a independent woman with her own
[1:02:52] thoughts and/or our own ideas he don't
[1:02:55] want that he wants someone who's gonna
[1:02:56] be submissive you like that God he keeps
[1:03:01] his promises all of his promises like
[1:03:03] yay hallelujah everything in him
[1:03:07] hallelujah
[1:03:08] you know it's like this when you ask
[1:03:10] anything of God the Bible said that's
[1:03:12] what Jesus said and believe that you
[1:03:13] shall receive it why are you asking
[1:03:16] those things of God that's in him and
[1:03:18] everything is in him any good design in
[1:03:21] it righteous desire everything that's in
[1:03:24] him is yay
[1:03:25] cuz he know you're gonna only ask
[1:03:27] according to his will is that Alright
[1:03:32] farming us and shaking us in other words
[1:03:36] let me say like this Jesus says I do
[1:03:40] nothing except the father show me
[1:03:43] he was so yielded to even when his best
[1:03:47] friend Lazarus needed him he wouldn't go
[1:03:52] hmm protectors
[1:03:54] supposin Lazarus was in in in the
[1:03:57] hospital and he's sending messages Jesus
[1:04:01] come see me now you have to read the
[1:04:04] little history behind that Lazarus and
[1:04:06] his sisters were orphans and and and
[1:04:09] they basically Lazarus was a place that
[1:04:11] Jesus could go like brother never was a
[1:04:14] place that brother Branham could go and
[1:04:16] rest and kick his legs up amen and so
[1:04:19] that's how it was amen with with Lazarus
[1:04:22] and Jesus so they were buddies and and
[1:04:25] you know it's amazing you know how you
[1:04:28] know uh uh they needed him and he didn't
[1:04:32] show up huh
[1:04:33] you know what it's the truth the prophet
[1:04:36] of God said she could have said well
[1:04:38] wait a minute we were there for you we
[1:04:41] cook for you
[1:04:42] we served you when you had your little
[1:04:44] ministers meeting I was there we were
[1:04:46] there see but no no no no she was him
[1:04:50] there was a part of him that no matter
[1:04:52] what she could never get angry with the
[1:04:55] word and if we were not here he said I
[1:04:57] got mad at God I'm not you did make you
[1:05:03] a her back up amen only a foolish man
[1:05:06] speaks like that huh is that right it's
[1:05:10] like a net or a tie and on the foe
[1:05:13] waving his fists at you and you're like
[1:05:15] you won't even feel the prick you know
[1:05:18] what I'm saying it doesn't make sense
[1:05:19] but a truth child of God as far as I
[1:05:23] understand in my revelation do not get
[1:05:26] there's no place in your heart to be
[1:05:29] angry with God but if you got the Spirit
[1:05:33] of God you become a lamb hallelujah no
[1:05:37] matter where he takes you where he
[1:05:39] leaves me I will follow right that's the
[1:05:43] way a real believer is I must go through
[1:05:46] the shadows of death but I fear no evil
[1:05:49] right because I Know Who I am and when
[1:05:53] you come to know who you are and know
[1:05:55] that everything you really asked for God
[1:05:58] is gonna give it to you now he's not
[1:06:00] gonna give you anything that's going to
[1:06:02] harm you is that right
[1:06:05] unless
[1:06:06] keep asking when he says no it's the
[1:06:13] truth
[1:06:14] you know it's not going your children we
[1:06:20] don't do this now but when we went in
[1:06:23] the world you know they want to go on
[1:06:25] and their mama said well go ahead along
[1:06:27] with your bad self
[1:06:29] cuz she know what you're gonna get she
[1:06:33] knows that she even tried to keep you
[1:06:35] out of trouble
[1:06:35] but you want to go at all you go ahead
[1:06:37] on right that's what happens a man God
[1:06:41] says okay so woman says I'm a preacher
[1:06:43] I'm a preacher you say but go ahead oh
[1:06:45] you're the one that's gonna be condemned
[1:06:47] at the end of the day is that right
[1:06:52] I believe the prophet of God spoke the
[1:06:57] Word of God and when he said I condemn
[1:07:00] all women preachers he was that a man a
[1:07:03] man can't do that only God can do that
[1:07:07] oh you love the Lord
[1:07:13] hey Colossians says one to the Father
[1:07:17] which have made us meet to be partakers
[1:07:20] of the inheritance of the Saints in
[1:07:23] light who have delivered us from the
[1:07:26] power of darkness and hath translated us
[1:07:29] into the kingdom of his dear son in whom
[1:07:33] we have redemption through his blood
[1:07:35] even the forgiveness of sin who is the
[1:07:40] image of the invisible God the firstborn
[1:07:43] of every creature I think I was talking
[1:07:47] I don't want to say too much because I
[1:07:49] don't know what brother Jasper's gonna
[1:07:50] wanna minister but you know you've heard
[1:07:53] me say this
[1:07:56] in the beginning was worried the Word
[1:07:58] was with God and the Word was God right
[1:08:00] and it talks about Jesus John was not
[1:08:06] the light but Jesus was the light of men
[1:08:10] and he was the first real man at the
[1:08:17] Adam everything
[1:08:19] the adder was a perversion we never saw
[1:08:23] the real thing again into Jesus so what
[1:08:27] is God doing now because we came into
[1:08:30] the image of the Fallen
[1:08:32] we must come into the image other new
[1:08:34] one so God as I said here before you
[1:08:38] cannot have a good and evil tree and go
[1:08:42] to heaven or make a rapture you
[1:08:46] understand me you as Jesus said you got
[1:08:50] to make the tree good or you got to make
[1:08:52] it evil you can't have a mixed tree in
[1:08:55] this hour you've got to make the tree
[1:08:57] good or you got to make the tree evil
[1:09:00] what is he talking about you can't make
[1:09:03] the tree evil or good unless the good is
[1:09:07] in you and who is the good God is good
[1:09:11] god is the only one that can make the
[1:09:14] tree good he's the only one that could
[1:09:18] change the nature of you and me you
[1:09:22] can't change it you can practice all you
[1:09:25] want but practicing holiness or
[1:09:29] righteousness will not produce holiness
[1:09:32] and righteousness
[1:09:33] you know what practicing holiness and
[1:09:35] righteousness does it produces filth the
[1:09:39] Bible says our righteousness is as
[1:09:41] filthy rags but the righteousness of God
[1:09:45] is what God is looking for hallelujah
[1:09:49] and realize by God's grace he meant that
[1:09:52] everything God promised us is yay to you
[1:09:55] so you never asked God for holiness and
[1:09:58] God don't give it well I didn't get it
[1:10:00] well you didn't have the faith to
[1:10:02] believe but if you have the same to
[1:10:04] believe that God can drop holiness into
[1:10:07] your heart you will become holy
[1:10:10] what is holiness that's God the real
[1:10:15] seal of God is holiness you understand
[1:10:19] me
[1:10:19] the Holy Ghost is holy be holy as your
[1:10:24] father which is in heaven is holy and
[1:10:25] you can't be holy
[1:10:27] let's the holy God comes down see what
[1:10:31] is it if Christ was had the preeminence
[1:10:35] God wants us to have the preeminence
[1:10:37] that right remember I read that
[1:10:40] scripture in Genesis last week how he
[1:10:43] told Adam have preeminence subdue subdue
[1:10:47] this everything around you is that right
[1:10:49] that's the only way that you and I would
[1:10:52] learn how to subdue and have preeminence
[1:10:55] it's not by force it's by Authority the
[1:11:00] authority of God's divine nature will
[1:11:03] cause every demon to bow in that nature
[1:11:07] is the name Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:11:11] y'all understand me so when that nature
[1:11:14] is in you you are the living walking
[1:11:16] talking name of Jesus Christ that's what
[1:11:21] we are he said I named Oh heaven in
[1:11:25] earth I named him after me that's why he
[1:11:28] said whatsoever you do do it all in the
[1:11:30] name of Jesus see you and I amen this is
[1:11:34] who I'm afraid of the devil but in
[1:11:37] reality the devil is afraid of you
[1:11:40] he's scared of what you possess him
[1:11:43] that's why he fights your mind so much
[1:11:46] because he does he just don't want to
[1:11:48] see you have faith he doesn't want you
[1:11:51] to about you he doesn't want you to have
[1:11:54] these roaches in you Rob because he
[1:11:56] realized when it's all over you can
[1:11:58] never fall a comes short again
[1:12:01] hallelujah you are complete that's why
[1:12:10] you've got a girdle of days a girdle up
[1:12:12] the lungs of your mind wrapped up
[1:12:13] singing of hallelujah protected a man
[1:12:16] with the Word of God you a new creature
[1:12:21] in Christ not some patched over well I
[1:12:24] used to forget what you used to do
[1:12:26] that's what God commanded of Israel the
[1:12:29] Bible said had they remembered what they
[1:12:32] were in Egypt
[1:12:33] they would have returned you got forget
[1:12:35] what you used to be not God watch that

[1:12:43] you to remember he will cause you to
[1:12:45] return remember win right that's the
[1:12:54] trick of the devil to get you to think
[1:12:56] about the way you used to be and what

[1:13:20] think about what I just said
[1:13:21] the Bible says according to Revelation
[1:13:23] 1:8 I am Alpha and Omega the beginning
[1:13:26] and the ending said the Lord which is
[1:13:28] which was and which is to come the
[1:13:30] Almighty then Jesus come in the book of
[1:13:33] Revelation says for all of them who
[1:13:35] overcome right I will cause them to sit
[1:13:38] in my throne even as I've said in my
[1:13:41] father's store right and understand like
[1:13:44] I said when Adam and Eve was one Adam
[1:13:46] one body one spirit one soul when they
[1:13:50] were just one their names were Adam and
[1:13:52] Adam yes as just the single image had
[1:13:59] dominion hallelujah and now God amen is
[1:14:03] bringing us back to a singleness of
[1:14:07] oneness where we would have this
[1:14:10] Dominion as I said last week not over
[1:14:13] just earth but heaven and earth
[1:14:16] hallelujah see God took us a higher
[1:14:18] level higher
[1:14:19] Adam was ugly but this Adam is a
[1:14:22] quickening spirit hallelujah and God
[1:14:24] made us Lord of Heaven and Earth is that
[1:14:29] right mr. truth why would he tell Peter

[1:14:34] raging and they cowering down at the
[1:14:37] demons in the storm oh Jesus care about

[1:15:33] beginning to see his tactic clearer now
[1:15:36] than ever and now we know that the

[1:17:59] cost what was the cause cold got in your

[1:18:36] Jesus Christ he says listen he told the
[1:18:38] church the Angel of the Church of me
[1:18:40] write these things says he what even the
[1:18:44] Soviet the faithful and true witness the
[1:18:48] beginning of the creation of God in
[1:18:52] other words he says not only did I beat
[1:18:54] him as a son but I have seen his
[1:18:57] faithfulness huh
[1:19:01] who got Jesus out of the ground God did
[1:19:04] I will not let his soul see corruption
[1:19:11] his soul seeing that's what people
[1:19:16] understand they can't put God together
[1:19:19] let me tell you some it is a revelation
[1:19:21] I can't explain all I know is a
[1:19:23] revelation and if he says his soul
[1:19:26] neither will I love my son or his soul
[1:19:28] to see correct his body to see
[1:19:29] corruption and then understand it took
[1:19:32] the Holy Spirit to get that soul up out
[1:19:36] of the ground you said that can't be
[1:19:42] right Jesus said I can't do nothing
[1:19:44] except the father show me and understand
[1:19:47] the father was Elohim Amen hallelujah
[1:19:51] that brother Ellen said amen Ellingham
[1:19:53] had a thought all of a sudden Amen Here
[1:19:55] Come a a pillar of fire he condescended
[1:20:00] to something that could be seen the
[1:20:05] pillar of fire wasn't him he was clothed
[1:20:07] by it he spoke out of it and then things
[1:20:12] began to materialize is that right odors
[1:20:17] flesh is not God but it clothed God
[1:20:26] that's what the Bible
[1:20:28] I want to be close upon I don't want to
[1:20:30] be found naked hallelujah and the only
[1:20:33] way that you cannot be found naked you
[1:20:36] got to have the same glory that the
[1:20:39] first Adam had and the second Adam
[1:20:43] because the fries Adam was naked and
[1:20:45] didn't know it he was innocent but that
[1:20:49] glory that's the kinda that light
[1:20:52] covered them hallelujah
[1:20:56] that's why I tell people this is not you
[1:20:58] know it's this one that I see you see
[1:21:04] and I want you to understand I don't
[1:21:07] know where the decimal you remember when
[1:21:08] we was down in Aiken and they had the
[1:21:10] cloud and that cloud came off that
[1:21:13] picture with those lambs and things yeah
[1:21:19] supernaturally he allowed it to be
[1:21:22] photographed you understand me
[1:21:24] so what I'm trying to say is what people
[1:21:27] call crazy they say is insane when Noor
[1:21:33] was insane no saw some didn't see nor
[1:21:36] was a prophet you know God gave no a
[1:21:38] vision nor saw rain and it wasn't not
[1:21:42] even in the Webster dictionary yet and
[1:21:45] his words were speaking in tongues it's
[1:21:47] gonna rain what you mean is gonna rain
[1:21:49] God gonna sit in water from heaven I
[1:21:54] know you crazy boy ain't no water down
[1:21:57] here like that he's gonna slap the whole
[1:22:00] world what to talk about oh he knows
[1:22:03] these three rivers that run through this
[1:22:05] place but you see God keeps his promise
[1:22:11] and it doesn't matter whether you
[1:22:13] believe it or not because you believe it
[1:22:16] don't believe it does not break God's
[1:22:19] promises the whole world to disbelieve
[1:22:22] what God's promised but God won't leave
[1:22:24] at least one
[1:22:25] he said because I've never left myself
[1:22:27] without a witness hallelujah there'll be
[1:22:29] one crazy person that's gonna believe
[1:22:32] God's Word and that's gonna benefit from
[1:22:35] it hallelujah because he know that God
[1:22:38] cannot break his word whatever
[1:22:42] promise you yeah I had God just talked
[1:22:45] to you you know just say I'm gonna do
[1:22:48] this for you know if God said I'm gonna
[1:22:52] save your wife you know he said he Oh
[1:22:56] same it doesn't matter what she see my
[1:22:59] she might she might take a dress up two
[1:23:02] more inches wear heels
[1:23:05] seven eight inches tall and that's what
[1:23:08] the devil to do when God makes you a
[1:23:10] promise he makes the person become look
[1:23:13] like they're getting worse you don't say
[1:23:15] oh they're getting worse never they
[1:23:18] don't get worse they get better
[1:23:21] hallelujah and when you see them
[1:23:23] carrying on amen then it looks like it's
[1:23:26] worse that means salvation is at the
[1:23:29] door
[1:23:30] hallelujah if you believe it you will
[1:23:33] receive it you gotta be the standard now
[1:23:39] you can't be cutting up and acting up
[1:23:42] and everything else and expect her to
[1:23:43] want what you got you got to be the
[1:23:48] standard right Amen you gotta be the one
[1:23:51] that system almost Jesus bear the cross
[1:23:53] alone and all the world go free no
[1:23:57] there's a cross for everyone and there's
[1:23:59] a cross me that's who you are
[1:24:02] take up your cross and follow me right
[1:24:05] so listen he says he's faithful and he's
[1:24:08] a true witness hallelujah
[1:24:12] remember Mary she want to hug him touch
[1:24:15] him she said no not right now
[1:24:17] I got to go up yonder is that right so
[1:24:20] Jesus are having a Sinden is that right
[1:24:22] I haven't ascended unto my father yet
[1:24:25] so he went to heaven put the blood on
[1:24:29] her own owner on the altar I don't know
[1:24:34] what kind of service they had then
[1:24:36] brother you know everything was tearing
[1:24:40] it up hey when that lamb came up there
[1:24:44] with that blood hardly knew Abraham and
[1:24:47] all of them right think about it think
[1:24:52] about it and we are always saying when
[1:24:54] the saints go marching in
[1:24:56] folks hallelujah I'm marching in and the
[1:24:59] only thing that's gonna keep me from
[1:25:00] jumping this is the we say smart I'm a
[1:25:02] March but if he doesn't specify it if he
[1:25:07] doesn't specify what I need to do oh no
[1:25:11] telling what I'm gonna do right in it so
[1:25:13] you and I must realized by God's grace
[1:25:15] he meant that God a man is dealing with
[1:25:19] us into a place where we can fully trust
[1:25:22] if Eve had only fully trusted God fully
[1:25:28] trusted means there is no room for doubt
[1:25:30] or persuasion
[1:25:34] there's opposite from what he's told you
[1:25:37] y'all hear what I'm saying see now you
[1:25:41] say oh he says listen in Revelation 21 5
[1:25:44] through 7 he says and he that sat upon
[1:25:46] the throne said behold I make all things
[1:25:48] new you got to start with us first he
[1:25:55] must start with us because we're the
[1:25:57] ones that messed it up and once we get
[1:26:01] in our position then God can put
[1:26:03] everything else in right but the head of
[1:26:06] the creation must be in his position
[1:26:08] first as long as Adam was in position
[1:26:12] the creation stayed in that place when
[1:26:15] Adam fell the creation fail hallelujah
[1:26:19] and as we rise the creation is shouting
[1:26:23] hallelujah go to God I'm going back to
[1:26:26] what I used to be see the creation is
[1:26:30] groaning that's what he said
[1:26:32] the all of creation is groaning and
[1:26:34] waiting for the manifestation of who the
[1:26:37] sons of God that's why the devil is
[1:26:39] really battling us because he knows who
[1:26:41] you are
[1:26:42] even if you don't know he knows you not
[1:26:44] he is well
[1:26:49] every Son of God the devil tried to kill
[1:26:53] him
[1:26:53] every see every royal seed had a rough
[1:26:57] time in this world hmm Oh somebody
[1:27:02] helped me Jesus you love the Lord oh and
[1:27:06] he said unto me it is done I am Alpha
[1:27:08] and Omega the beginning to tell you that
[1:27:11] he said do you understand what God when
[1:27:16] he says it's done
[1:27:17] it means it's done hallelujah though we
[1:27:21] don't see it yet in his mind out of his
[1:27:25] mouth he said it's done I'm about to
[1:27:29] preach on that one it is done I am Alpha
[1:27:32] and Omega the beginning and the end I
[1:27:35] would give unto him that is athirst of
[1:27:37] the fountain of the waters of life
[1:27:39] freely oh I got about freely and he then
[1:27:43] overcome shall inherit all fittings I
[1:27:47] think I'll just go and take a little
[1:27:50] trip to Venus hmm
[1:27:53] wherever I want to go everything is his
[1:27:57] is my he loved the Lord and that would
[1:28:01] be his God and he shall be my son who
[1:28:05] second Corinthians 5:17 said it
[1:28:08] therefore if any man be in Christ he is
[1:28:12] a new creature old things are passed
[1:28:14] away behold all ALL things ah become and
[1:28:23] understand that is a process but God
[1:28:25] wants everything he wants all of our
[1:28:27] past life ripped away from us it's true
[1:28:32] we've got to come to a place where we
[1:28:35] got to stop thinking about what we used
[1:28:37] to be hello
[1:28:39] you have you've heard this said before
[1:28:42] it's just like with with Rahab when God
[1:28:45] destroyed a Jericho he got rid of all of
[1:28:50] her witnesses not one was left who could
[1:28:56] say I remember when you used to and the
[1:29:00] ones that were saying wasn't gonna talk
[1:29:01] about it anyway cuz with
[1:29:03] out heard they wouldn't have been saying
[1:29:07] that would have had the imprint of rehab
[1:29:12] in Jericho was destroyed that right
[1:29:17] that's why God destroyed the whole of
[1:29:18] Egypt because you know those slaves
[1:29:21] weren't living right y'all thought they
[1:29:24] were living right if they were living
[1:29:26] right why in the wilderness they didn't
[1:29:28] live right all they did was moved from
[1:29:32] one place to another and like they said
[1:29:35] they came out of Egypt but Egypt never
[1:29:37] came out of there
[1:29:39] so a lot of the stuff they were doing
[1:29:41] Moses didn't know about it but now Moses
[1:29:44] and not in control God is and let me
[1:29:48] tell you something you know and I know
[1:29:50] if there's ever pressure in your life
[1:29:53] and you got something in your life that
[1:29:55] needs to be out and it's still in
[1:29:57] certain pressures are gonna come and
[1:29:59] you're gonna see that thing it's gonna
[1:30:01] stick his head up that's why you got to
[1:30:03] be sanctified that's why you got a yield
[1:30:06] to God and let God cleanse you up get
[1:30:09] all the darkness out of your life
[1:30:11] because Satan can see things he can hear
[1:30:17] voices you know don't you know darkness
[1:30:19] has a voice you said what do you mean
[1:30:22] because it's a demon and demons have
[1:30:26] demon have voices that right well what
[1:30:30] about the prophets meetings remember
[1:30:33] when a cancer or whatever was being cast
[1:30:35] out the one called to the other and they
[1:30:38] united in forces trying to stop the word
[1:30:41] from casting them out there were times
[1:30:47] it's oh you you got um two burger losses
[1:30:52] I just use that God just healed you oh
[1:30:54] you had it to God just heal you what was
[1:30:57] it he saw darkness leave
[1:31:03] going to God see that's what the word
[1:31:06] comes to do the world constant it
[1:31:10] everybody listen it's the truth you and
[1:31:13] I will we come to church I don't care
[1:31:16] what devil what demon amen that's got a
[1:31:18] hold of you if you submit to the word
[1:31:20] God would drive that demon out just by
[1:31:23] the preaching of the word no hand laying
[1:31:26] your hands that ain't necessary it is
[1:31:28] the word they were healed by the word
[1:31:34] they were delivered by the word they
[1:31:38] received the Holy Ghost by the word the
[1:31:42] preaching of the word like us at
[1:31:44] standing here don't you see him a lot
[1:31:46] there's an angel here by every preacher
[1:31:49] our angel stands there and ministers to
[1:31:52] him and he ministers to you ministering
[1:31:57] spirits flames of fire hallelujah I'm
[1:32:02] almost dying ain't God good to us we
[1:32:10] have come to take me wherever we work
[1:32:17] wherever we live the devil is gonna try
[1:32:21] to press you down like you ain't nobody
[1:32:23] oh you're a Christian I'm gonna press
[1:32:25] you down no no no no no you can't do
[1:32:28] that cuz really I'm your boss they don't
[1:32:31] you don't know it but I'm yours that
[1:32:33] think about it every time in Egypt and
[1:32:37] you and all all of us has been blessed
[1:32:39] with their blessing of Joseph Joseph is
[1:32:42] another type of Jesus so we've been
[1:32:44] blessed that wherever we go that our fee
[1:32:47] is we don't próxima and when the devil
[1:32:49] try to make it look like you're not
[1:32:50] proximate you give it all I don't know
[1:32:54] what's going on don't look like well you
[1:32:56] just do you do you full of doubt you
[1:32:59] full of unbelief you just created an
[1:33:02] atmosphere right you just create a wall
[1:33:06] but when you take that devil and you
[1:33:09] start speaking to him like you like
[1:33:11] David had to speak to Goliath oh you
[1:33:14] said this is what's going to happen but
[1:33:16] I'm telling you what's gonna happen but
[1:33:19] you can only do that when you pray it up
[1:33:22] you ain't God and it does not a carnal
[1:33:24] battle this is a spiritual battle we
[1:33:27] don't wrestle against flesh and blood
[1:33:28] but when you see that the spirit of the
[1:33:31] devil is trying to hold you down and pin
[1:33:33] you down you've got to realize he whom
[1:33:35] the Sun sets free is free indeed and
[1:33:38] where the Spirit of the Lord is there is
[1:33:40] Liberty I know I live in this world I
[1:33:43] live free and never under bondage well
[1:33:51] he promised it even if the weather kick
[1:33:57] against you how many times we prayed
[1:33:59] even now near in South Carolina it was
[1:34:02] hot and and he says Lord I got witness
[1:34:07] now I got witnesses that God stopped
[1:34:11] that storm I had a brother in the car
[1:34:13] with me and I started talking to that
[1:34:17] storm and it was raining hard and I cut
[1:34:21] my wipers off about it about no no more
[1:34:24] than a few seconds as I cut my wife was
[1:34:26] off the rain stopped I didn't say
[1:34:28] nothing cuz he saw me and heard me talk
[1:34:31] to the to the Lord somebody has been
[1:34:33] praying - I'm not taking all the glory
[1:34:34] at all I'm not taking any I'm just
[1:34:37] saying when you start talking to the law
[1:34:38] said Lord you know we want to have these
[1:34:40] services I said no but if you ain't
[1:34:43] bringing this rain to cool it off thank
[1:34:45] you Jesus from that first date all the
[1:34:49] way to the end God let it rain and even
[1:34:52] brought a cool breeze underneath that
[1:34:54] tent and as soon as the tent meeting was
[1:34:57] over the temperatures went up I'm not
[1:35:02] saying it wasn't still hot but it wasn't
[1:35:04] so hot that we couldn't bear it you know
[1:35:07] understand me God brought his own air
[1:35:09] conditioning but if you don't use your
[1:35:12] father that's your father and if you
[1:35:15] asking anything according to his will he
[1:35:17] said he will give it to you was I out of
[1:35:20] the word no because Joshua said son
[1:35:26] stand still
[1:35:28] yes
[1:35:30] understands fearly command the Sun stand
[1:35:32] still not for himself he wanted to win
[1:35:35] the battle and all the glory was going
[1:35:37] to go to God that's what the hosted the
[1:35:39] whole story about stop the storm not for
[1:35:41] me but that God may be glorified it's
[1:35:44] all empty Oh
[1:35:45] intent is right God will always answer
[1:35:50] I'm almost doing he gonna keep his
[1:35:54] promises I think it was the other day I
[1:36:01] said Lord you make these promises and
[1:36:04] you know I'm gonna believe them right
[1:36:08] you know I'm gonna believe him how can
[1:36:10] you not believe the promise of God when
[1:36:12] you you're part of him you can't help it
[1:36:15] you know and I will hold to every one of
[1:36:20] the promises that's why the Bob said
[1:36:24] great is the Lord and greatly to be
[1:36:26] praised and his greatness is
[1:36:28] unsearchable is that right
[1:36:31] and I'ma read this one quote and then
[1:36:33] we're gonna close I didn't plan to stay
[1:36:35] long but I wanted you to see that even
[1:36:40] how can I say it if we learn after after
[1:36:46] God if you if you have a promise in the
[1:36:49] word supposing the scriptures there and
[1:36:51] you you take that scripture and you're
[1:36:53] laid before the Lord say but lord I
[1:36:56] believe this this is what I meet and
[1:36:59] this is what I need this what a neat and
[1:37:01] this is a scripture that I'm gonna hold
[1:37:03] on to you need to hold on to it hmm and
[1:37:08] you know what you do like the arrow of
[1:37:11] deliverance you can't strike it three
[1:37:13] times
[1:37:14] you keep whacking it till it come back
[1:37:17] on the pass mmm yeah I got I got
[1:37:21] relatives now I'm still whacking I do
[1:37:25] cousins in Ajo
[1:37:27] I'm still whacking because I want to see
[1:37:30] them in this come to the truth of this
[1:37:33] way
[1:37:34] okay we are the bride of Jesus Christ if
[1:37:37] there is a mediator its Christ in us and
[1:37:41] in you and I are the bride we're the
[1:37:45] priest I make you kings and priests
[1:37:47] therefore we handle the blood hmm
[1:37:55] remember this I like the way he says it
[1:37:58] Christ in the true church is a
[1:38:00] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[1:38:03] book of Revelation shows how that the
[1:38:05] Antichrist spirit would come into the
[1:38:09] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[1:38:12] whoa that's the first thing he defiles
[1:38:16] it by making it lukewarm phorbol and
[1:38:22] powerless hmm like I said we got
[1:38:29] Catholics in the message we got
[1:38:31] Methodists in the message we got
[1:38:33] Baptists in the message we got pillar
[1:38:35] consoles in the message we got a little
[1:38:37] bit of everybody in the message and God
[1:38:39] don't dad God won't word he don't you
[1:38:43] don't bring your traditions and your
[1:38:44] whatever into the wood I think the way
[1:38:46] we used to do it and I'm not accustomed
[1:38:48] to you you know worshipping like that
[1:38:51] you still need to be born again hmm
[1:38:55] cuz when you born again they experienced
[1:38:57] their hand on the day of Pentecost
[1:38:59] supposed to show up in you somewhere I'm
[1:39:07] closing everybody want to have their own
[1:39:11] little section in the message right they
[1:39:13] hit though they hit the Pentecostals the
[1:39:15] worse cuz they don't want that scream
[1:39:17] and holler and I like it but we have
[1:39:19] come to know they're screaming and
[1:39:21] holiday near that ain't life that could
[1:39:26] be a form of a garland S or whatever but
[1:39:28] that's not life this message bring life
[1:39:32] then when like calm that will follow
[1:39:36] some of that but if a million never jog
[1:39:40] I jump a run and he's got Jesus that's
[1:39:44] enough
[1:39:45] right like you've heard me say it is
[1:39:48] never the blood plus huh it's never the
[1:39:53] blood plus it's only the blood and that
[1:39:58] blood we know is the life is that right
[1:40:02] it is the Holy Spirit let me finish this
[1:40:05] thing ah but the book of Revelation
[1:40:08] shows how that Antichrist spirit would
[1:40:10] come into the church and defile it
[1:40:11] making it look for former and powerless
[1:40:14] it exposes Satan revealing its works
[1:40:16] there's so many people who do not
[1:40:18] approve of the church age book they are
[1:40:22] so messed up I knew people who the
[1:40:26] Browns is who were there when the angel
[1:40:28] of the Lord came and wrote it on the
[1:40:29] wall and if the prophet of God amen
[1:40:33] listen
[1:40:34] look at Luke Luke would be an example of
[1:40:37] his riding-whip to me would be an
[1:40:40] example of what the church age book
[1:40:42] would been you know an intelligent man
[1:40:45] by lavell wrote the book but he
[1:40:49] basically copied what brother I'm saying
[1:40:51] yeah that's leave a book but that ain't
[1:40:54] what the Prophet said and if it was
[1:40:56] wrong he would have told us and people
[1:40:59] they don't want to have it you know
[1:41:01] that's what you know I cuz in there it's
[1:41:04] made plain you see the devil II I see
[1:41:17] the devil and the thing about it is when
[1:41:19] you understand the two spirits in the
[1:41:21] framework of this bride you know what to
[1:41:24] do then you understand you you
[1:41:26] understand that what you live is what
[1:41:29] will be resented of the others they
[1:41:33] can't stand you living it hmm they can't
[1:41:37] stand seeing the sacrifice in you ah
[1:41:45] they want this religion right form and
[1:41:50] powerless oh I can hardly stand it is
[1:41:52] that right Expo listen that's what he
[1:41:55] does and what people don't understand is
[1:41:58] this is where the joy of the Lord is our
[1:42:00] strength
[1:42:01] you let the devil take your joy you have
[1:42:03] no strength huh
[1:42:07] the joy of the Lord I'm not talking
[1:42:09] about just joy the joy of the Lord
[1:42:13] exposure saving reveals his works
[1:42:16] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:42:18] and the spreading of God's Word
[1:42:20] right down to the time he is cast into
[1:42:23] the lake of fire
[1:42:23] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[1:42:27] knows that if the people he had a true
[1:42:29] revelation of the true church and what
[1:42:32] she is and what she stands for that she
[1:42:35] can do the greater works she will be an
[1:42:38] invincible army and if they get a true
[1:42:41] revelation of the two spirits within the
[1:42:43] framework of the Christian Church and by
[1:42:45] God's Spirit discern and withstand
[1:42:48] that's what I'm talking will span the
[1:42:51] Antichrist spirit that's what John told
[1:42:55] us right
[1:42:55] John John Scaggs how it is a system it
[1:43:00] was so clear how the system causes
[1:43:04] people to believe the message but they
[1:43:06] never get to Christ what's the
[1:43:09] difference if you draw on another church
[1:43:13] and you believed about the Baptist right
[1:43:16] or the Methodist right or whatever a
[1:43:17] Catholic right and you believe that and
[1:43:19] you you think because you believe that
[1:43:22] right you going to heaven you're lost
[1:43:27] like I said even now you know I tell the
[1:43:30] people that say well why well you know
[1:43:32] Oh girlfriend of mine you know she
[1:43:37] thought I was crazy when I first got
[1:43:38] saved I was I was preaching against the
[1:43:40] Catholic Church the system of it I
[1:43:42] didn't I didn't realize the system I was
[1:43:44] in was just just a second
[1:43:49] no doubt I'm preaching hard against your
[1:43:52] brother Antichrist and all that didn't
[1:43:55] know I was in an antichrist system to a
[1:44:00] man then I married some years ago she's
[1:44:03] all she said hard now I understand what
[1:44:06] you and vivvy was telling me about he
[1:44:07] says she said I'm Pentecostal now but
[1:44:11] she said i'ma tell you the truth I will
[1:44:12] always be Catholic and like mm you you
[1:44:22] might a shout it you may have spoke in
[1:44:24] tongues you may have ran out she's a
[1:44:27] preacher hallelujah
[1:44:33] you understand me all of that for what
[1:44:38] and she talks to me she said you still
[1:44:40] live that way see y'all in bondage you
[1:44:43] and Bonnie you still in bondage don't
[1:44:56] let me go to the heart Amen I'm almost
[1:44:58] done listen and she will be an invisible
[1:45:02] army if they get a true revelation the
[1:45:04] true spirit within the framework of the
[1:45:06] Christian Church and by God's Spirit
[1:45:08] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[1:45:10] spirit Satan will be powerless before
[1:45:13] her he will be as definitely draught
[1:45:15] today as when Christ was stood his every
[1:45:19] effort to gain power over him in the
[1:45:21] desert yes Satan hates revelation but we
[1:45:24] love it with the true revelation in our
[1:45:27] lives the gates of Hell cannot prevail
[1:45:29] against us but we will prevail over them
[1:45:32] so I'm saying this in closing you and I
[1:45:36] we have the greatest word ever out of
[1:45:40] all the ages this day is greater than
[1:45:43] the days of Noah greater than the days
[1:45:45] of Moses greater than the Israel days of
[1:45:48] Elijah right because this messenger that
[1:45:52] God sent us he was a covenant angel as
[1:45:54] well hallelujah he did things that Paul
[1:45:59] couldn't do even though they preached
[1:46:02] the same word but brother Branham I put
[1:46:06] it this way God he got that for town and
[1:46:08] he went like this
[1:46:08] now do you think it stopped with him no
[1:46:12] sir he passed it on he said the move is
[1:46:14] on the bride see see now God's focusing
[1:46:19] his eyes on you and me what we're gonna
[1:46:22] do with this we gonna believe we're
[1:46:24] winners and we're gonna believe that
[1:46:26] we're more than victorious
[1:46:28] hallelujah a wiggle didn't I listen I I
[1:46:31] can't change what the system I came out
[1:46:34] of but I didn't I I deny it if anybody
[1:46:41] asked me do you think I'm gonna be
[1:46:42] alright in that system no I wasn't
[1:46:48] alright I just didn't know it right but
[1:46:50] now we know the truth that we are united
[1:46:55] in Christ right there is not a system
[1:46:59] I'm not even a part of the message
[1:47:02] system because the devil has Foreman
[1:47:06] he's form a system I'm a part of the
[1:47:09] word and the word is free and don't you
[1:47:13] understand in order to see Jesus you got
[1:47:16] to go beyond the camp you can't well
[1:47:20] they do it like this over here and they
[1:47:22] do it like this over I don't care what
[1:47:24] they do how they do it you better know
[1:47:27] that you doing everything according to
[1:47:30] the word reveal you love the Lord see
[1:47:35] they say we ain't no organization but
[1:47:37] they show handle it like one everybody
[1:47:40] trying to tell what did sure different
[1:47:41] churches what to do and how they do it
[1:47:43] and they look at me like I'm an outcast
[1:47:45] you know an oddball I have my outcast I
[1:47:48] am I oddball and I don't want to be a
[1:47:50] part of no man system hello I don't I
[1:47:54] don't make no difference how they do it
[1:47:57] all over this place and this thing like
[1:47:59] I heard somebody when I was in Brazil
[1:48:00] you may stand a brother a brother a
[1:48:03] pastor and you know he lied in the
[1:48:06] pulpit first of all he said he was a
[1:48:08] deacon in brother twin brother
[1:48:09] maryland's for brother Branham at
[1:48:11] Branham Cavanaugh
[1:48:12] he didn't even come into the message a
[1:48:13] minutes in 1967 and then he told the
[1:48:18] people he said listen he said Berlin
[1:48:21] left Brenham Tabernacle as an example
[1:48:24] for the people to follow lie
[1:48:27] how can he lead the Branham Tabernacle
[1:48:29] when he says no matter what Bradham
[1:48:32] Tabernacle becomes don't you be a part
[1:48:34] of it
[1:48:35] that's a quote and how can he take that
[1:48:40] that's Antichrist because how can you
[1:48:42] make a church an example when the word
[1:48:48] and I called him on it but brother I
[1:48:52] don't remember I said well it's on tape
[1:48:57] it's on tape I said I really was
[1:49:01] disappointed cuz you lied in that pulpit
[1:49:03] and he said other things that I don't
[1:49:05] necessarily need to say it but my point
[1:49:08] is it's a prominent Minister and it was
[1:49:12] over 5,000 people over there in Brazil
[1:49:13] and he did all he says holders but he's
[1:49:16] a brother book to you you want to sing I
[1:49:18] said well if they won't be saying I
[1:49:19] don't care well let me go over here and
[1:49:21] see can I get three in minutes over here
[1:49:24] he there's a spirit now he want to
[1:49:28] persuade the pastor to let me sing and I
[1:49:33] don't care whether I I don't want to
[1:49:35] sing cuz the pastor want me to see isn't
[1:49:37] this is God thing you know you don't do
[1:49:42] that well he did but my thing is and you
[1:49:46] know I see so much that's not right even
[1:49:52] among the leaders and I'm gonna tell you
[1:49:54] something I'm not even asking you to put
[1:49:56] your trust in me because the Bible said
[1:49:58] put no trust in the arm of the flesh of
[1:50:00] man I'm a man yet I'm I'm a redeemed man
[1:50:05] you understand me
[1:50:06] and we do flaws and we have errors but
[1:50:10] as rows you stay with the word you gonna
[1:50:13] be alright you love the Lord let's just
[1:50:16] bow to where the prayer father I thank
[1:50:19] you for the being who you are I can
[1:50:21] trust this
[1:50:24] it's be tried and tried and tried in the
[1:50:29] fire again again and again
[1:50:31] Lord this word was able to keep every
[1:50:37] soul whose name was written in the
[1:50:40] Lamb's Book of Life throughout all ages
[1:50:44] it's been faithful and Satan has tried
[1:50:47] to destroy but now you've hidden that
[1:50:50] word in a place he can't touch and that
[1:50:53] is in the hearts of men father as we
[1:50:56] come before your Lord with such a simple
[1:50:58] message I pray father that you bless
[1:51:01] hallelujah continue to bless the people
