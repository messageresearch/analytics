[55:02] [Music]
[55:12] i stand because of the blood of the land
[55:19] [Music]
[55:21] you may be seated for just a moment
[55:28] i sang a little longer because of the
[55:30] ones that were still coming
[55:34] we appreciate the
[55:36] iowa city group for passing out
[55:40] board winner
[55:41] and just like i said when we announced
[55:43] they are coming come javier no see we
[55:46] are expecting us to go to them
[55:52] their picnic
[55:54] we want to have a joint meeting there
[55:55] for those of all all of us we're waiting
[55:58] on their date zones in their place
[56:14] and most of you don't know her but her
[56:17] name was margaret dingeman
[56:21] margaret she was about 80 years old also
[56:26] but in my uh being
[56:34] but her husband was the
[56:37] uh
[56:38] thing that was keeping her from going
[56:40] all the way
[56:42] this weekend
[56:54] but he would not allow her to
[57:08] we just somehow
[57:10] connected with her
[57:12] ten years ago
[57:14] and at that time god said as the devil
[57:16] said rather excuse me
[57:19] she had cancer
[57:21] and she was in a uh one
[57:23] the last stage or the next to the last
[57:25] stage
[57:26] and they had given her a short period of
[57:28] time
[57:32] but that's not what god said
[57:35] and god delivered her from that cancer
[57:39] he came back
[57:40] it looks like years later
[57:42] god delivered her again
[57:45] it came back
[57:47] years later
[57:49] and um but this time at sumo
[57:53] it was her ongoing time
[57:57] but she saw miracles
[58:00] her her granddaughter
[58:03] who could not have a kid or a child
[58:07] we pray for her
[58:09] at the same time we pray for sister
[58:10] margaret remember
[58:13] god bless that sister with twins
[58:17] in fact they came here as a testimony
[58:19] he's a different so we
[58:33] i don't know what kind of drugs he was
[58:34] on the drug but it really had him in a
[58:37] bad state of mind
[58:40] we pray for him at that same time
[58:44] and god delivered him
[58:46] i'm not bragging on me
[59:02] he's the same man
[59:04] and then as a testimony
[59:08] brother rich and i went by
[59:11] we prayed for her saying for her
[59:14] brother keith and i went by
[59:16] this lady was in her chair he said
[59:18] farmington couldn't holly move
[59:21] we pray for her
[59:23] she brought it up and she said that she
[59:25] feel lighter than air yeah
[59:27] and she began to dance in the spirit
[59:32] this last time we went by here
[59:37] she wasn't able to do much talking
[59:39] anything
[59:40] but we we did pray with her
[59:42] by the grace of god so you understand
[59:45] it was not the cancer that killed her
[59:49] it was the medication
[59:52] she overdosed uh
[59:54] the medication they gave her
[59:56] there was a certain period of time she
[59:58] was supposed to stop taking it
[1:00:00] and she thought she was supposed to
[1:00:01] continue to continue with the medication
[1:00:05] so that's the thing that that brought
[1:00:07] her body down
[1:00:09] regardless to the fact
[1:00:12] she left out here and like
[1:00:15] her daughter and son-in-law
[1:00:18] in this message they were the ones who
[1:00:19] were interested in her years ago
[1:00:24] they live in arkansas
[1:00:26] not
[1:00:27] they told me about
[1:00:29] uh sister dingerman
[1:00:32] uh i think it was brother keith and i
[1:00:34] can't remember brother i can't remember
[1:00:35] who went with me
[1:00:37] uh directly because those two would
[1:00:39] always go one way or the other
[1:01:04] that her mom was listening to the
[1:01:06] prophet's message
[1:01:08] every
[1:01:37] somebody when i got to the funeral
[1:01:39] yesterday
[1:01:41] he always have a little strangeness
[1:01:42] about him
[1:01:44] but he said no no he said i want you to
[1:01:46] sit by me
[1:01:49] we sat by him the whole time
[1:01:52] and he turned over and he said to me
[1:01:54] turn to look at me
[1:01:56] he said i know for sure did you see
[1:01:58] something you are a true man of god
[1:02:03] and then he began to say
[1:02:19] a cool breeze
[1:02:22] came through the room
[1:02:24] and when the breeze came to the room
[1:02:28] it took her with him
[1:02:36] you know
[1:02:37] i told my wife i said it's a it's a
[1:02:39] strange thing she's doing my
[1:02:41] pharmaceutical
[1:02:42] that lady laid up in that casket as and
[1:02:44] she looked like she was asleep
[1:02:59] and so blood was still running in the
[1:03:01] vein concealer
[1:03:05] i don't understand it
[1:03:07] but i get i i i was hoping their
[1:03:09] relatives would have come tonight this
[1:03:11] morning
[1:03:13] they're on their way
[1:03:27] only just a few times he just
[1:03:30] had an opportunity
[1:03:32] to come to what we call a message
[1:03:37] he had faith
[1:03:39] to believe what the message was saying
[1:03:54] [Music]
[1:03:56] and she stayed true to the lord
[1:04:01] and god is my witness
[1:04:04] she was the only this is a this is a a a
[1:04:08] a similarly a god church just said you
[1:04:10] need
[1:04:52] as a testimony
[1:04:55] so she was a testimony even to those
[1:04:57] people
[1:04:59] and you know what the pastor said
[1:05:02] that old time stand it
[1:05:08] amen
[1:05:10] so we thank god for his goodness
[1:05:15] why you got that white suit on
[1:05:18] question it's in honor of my wife
[1:05:23] and in honor of my father
[1:05:26] there's only one true father
[1:05:29] and that's god himself this is jude
[1:05:31] remember when i got married
[1:05:34] i was
[1:05:40] and when i got married the second time
[1:05:44] i was married in white
[1:05:46] oh y'all didn't know that huh
[1:05:48] i married jesus
[1:05:50] [Laughter]
[1:05:53] i knew i got off
[1:05:54] [Laughter]
[1:05:56] hallelujah
[1:05:58] god is so good to us
[1:06:00] we um
[1:06:03] listen i couldn't have been a good
[1:06:04] father
[1:06:05] [Music]
[1:06:08] if i had never gotten really you know
[1:06:09] married
[1:06:12] being married
[1:06:14] together
[1:06:18] and i want to say to the fathers today
[1:06:21] this is not a traditional thing
[1:06:23] this is something we we don't not
[1:06:25] necessarily celebrate see texas couldn't
[1:06:27] say that but i want to say to you
[1:06:31] the only
[1:06:32] thing you can do as a father
[1:06:36] is to give it your best see
[1:06:39] there is no perfect fathers
[1:06:44] the only perfect one is christ himself
[1:06:48] but we have an example in this example
[1:06:50] that we should go by and live by
[1:06:54] you know everything
[1:06:55] so we thank god for that
[1:06:58] also
[1:06:59] i had a battle wearing this suit
[1:07:04] because of the color
[1:07:07] i had a suit this color
[1:07:10] in my closet
[1:07:13] in my closet
[1:07:15] mama galduro for for about 20 years
[1:07:19] and i was always afraid to wear it
[1:07:23] it got so old i had to give it up
[1:07:27] so i took it to the salvation army
[1:07:30] and the suit that i have
[1:07:33] it was not planned
[1:07:35] but by god's grace
[1:07:37] god gave it to me
[1:07:39] and i'm saying all of this to say
[1:07:42] don't look at my suit no i got the best
[1:07:44] that god has given me
[1:07:46] and think that this is your tithing
[1:07:55] i know how people think she said come on
[1:07:58] pause
[1:07:59] but no no no this was not yours and from
[1:08:02] you no this was from someone else
[1:08:04] i said all of that to clear up your mind
[1:08:08] god is good to us
[1:08:10] maybe that was carnal and what it should
[1:08:12] not have been said but i think i just
[1:08:14] need to say things like that
[1:08:17] people when they see the pastor doing
[1:08:20] better
[1:08:22] while pastors
[1:08:30] but you know when when anybody prospers
[1:08:34] it's because of jesus christ
[1:08:38] and we thank god for his grace and his
[1:08:40] mercy
[1:08:41] now
[1:08:42] i'm coming to have a good time
[1:08:45] i'm trusting that you're you're going to
[1:08:47] open your hearts and mind to the holy
[1:08:49] spirit this morning
[1:09:19] and i know
[1:09:20] as you say and all of the promises
[1:09:24] of this bible
[1:09:25] and this message
[1:09:30] hallelujah
[1:09:32] i i was thinking about brother branham
[1:09:34] as we stand japan
[1:09:36] i was thinking about him
[1:09:38] and and and and i was thinking about how
[1:09:41] tough it was
[1:09:43] to
[1:09:45] preach what he was preaching the british
[1:09:48] at the time he lived on earth
[1:09:52] because
[1:09:53] oscar uh back in that day
[1:09:57] you couldn't see what we see now
[1:10:13] and so that's why when we hear the
[1:10:14] message
[1:10:16] it's like the prophet is here right now
[1:10:19] the voice of god is speaking to us
[1:10:21] literally right now
[1:10:25] that's what makes it real
[1:10:28] because we see the reality of the
[1:10:30] message
[1:10:31] and we're definitely living it right now
[1:10:35] you are either a believer
[1:10:38] or make-believer
[1:10:40] or an unbeliever
[1:10:42] that's the way it works but i trusted
[1:10:44] everybody in here
[1:10:47] are believers
[1:10:50] envision yourself as a believer
[1:10:52] i don't care what you go through never
[1:10:54] never ever let the devil make you think
[1:10:58] you are a foolish virgin
[1:11:01] for that you are lost
[1:11:04] never
[1:11:06] ever
[1:11:07] let him get in your mind
[1:11:09] to convince you of those those evil
[1:11:11] things
[1:11:13] because god chose you
[1:11:16] and he loves you for who you are
[1:11:20] hallelujah amen
[1:11:22] in that while we were yet sinners he
[1:11:39] starting at the tenth verse
[1:11:44] i got three passages of scriptures that
[1:11:46] i like to read
[1:11:51] hebrews
[1:11:53] 11 and 10.
[1:11:57] speaking of abraham ballooned abraham
[1:12:00] for he looked for a city
[1:12:02] which have foundation
[1:12:04] whose builder and maker is god
[1:12:13] through faith
[1:12:15] also sarah herself
[1:12:17] received strength to receive seed
[1:12:21] and was delivered of a child when
[1:12:23] she was past age because she judged him
[1:12:28] faithful who had promised
[1:12:33] me
[1:12:48] we're going to read
[1:12:50] there the first chapter
[1:12:57] and we'll read the third and fourth
[1:12:58] verses
[1:13:07] in order to read this book you have to
[1:13:09] be really spiritual minded
[1:13:14] so but i'm going to just
[1:13:16] take a portion here
[1:13:18] you see uh from third verse to the
[1:13:20] fourth
[1:13:23] because of the savior of the good
[1:13:25] ointments
[1:13:27] that thy name is
[1:13:29] as ointment poured forth
[1:13:32] therefore do the virgins love thee
[1:13:35] liquid he says thy name
[1:13:39] is as oi man
[1:13:42] poured forth therefore do the virgins
[1:13:54] we will run after thee
[1:13:57] the king have brought me into his
[1:13:59] chamber
[1:14:01] we will be glad and rejoice in thee
[1:14:04] we will remember thy love
[1:14:08] more than wine
[1:14:10] the upright love
[1:14:12] thee
[1:14:26] 19 apocalypse
[1:14:36] beginning at the seventh verse
[1:14:43] let us be glad and rejoice
[1:14:45] and give honor to him for the marriage
[1:14:47] of the lamb has come and his wife hath
[1:14:50] made herself ready
[1:14:59] and to her was granted that she should
[1:15:02] be arrayed and find linen clean and
[1:15:04] white for the fine linen is the
[1:15:07] righteousness of saints
[1:15:18] unto me right blessed are they which are
[1:15:21] called unto the marriage supper of the
[1:15:24] lamb
[1:15:25] and he said unto me these are the true
[1:15:28] sayings of god
[1:15:38] and i failed at his feet to worship him
[1:15:42] and he said unto me see thou do it not
[1:15:46] i am thy fellow servant and of thy
[1:15:49] brethren that have the testimony of
[1:15:52] jesus christ i love that
[1:15:54] brethren that have the testimony of
[1:15:56] jesus
[1:15:57] worship god
[1:15:59] for the testimony of jesus is the spirit
[1:16:02] of prophecy
[1:16:19] dear jesus
[1:16:21] the god who is of heaven the jew this
[1:16:23] year the god who of of earth you drew
[1:16:25] that down and the god who is of me
[1:16:28] lord you dwell within us
[1:16:32] your bride your church you have made us
[1:16:35] your tabernacles
[1:16:37] and we worship you lord
[1:16:39] we thank you oh god
[1:16:41] for being so good to us
[1:16:43] lord beyond measures
[1:16:46] your love has been expressed to us
[1:16:48] so much so
[1:16:51] it's very
[1:16:52] it's hard to comprehend
[1:16:55] just how much
[1:16:57] but i pray this morning
[1:16:59] that as we speak your word hallelujah
[1:17:02] as we speak your word
[1:17:05] father that you will anoint the hearts
[1:17:08] that's what you want in the mind
[1:17:10] of the people
[1:17:12] because you said
[1:17:14] by your prophet
[1:17:28] we
[1:17:42] we thank you oh god
[1:17:53] because i realize a man that we are
[1:17:55] living in a time
[1:18:22] what god has done and is doing in this
[1:18:24] day it's good you have faith it could
[1:18:26] fail he's not come to establish another
[1:18:29] institution
[1:18:30] uh like the church age
[1:18:32] uh established
[1:18:35] institution
[1:18:38] but he comes to inject himself
[1:18:42] into a people
[1:18:44] that they will become one with him
[1:18:48] amen
[1:18:49] you know in the songs of solomon
[1:19:07] and and they are expressing is extreme
[1:19:10] the very name of god is like like a
[1:19:14] stipulation
[1:19:18] if it does something to
[1:19:21] to these virgins
[1:19:23] and then they said you know we love him
[1:19:26] we love him
[1:19:28] we love his expressions we love his
[1:19:30] feelings
[1:19:31] we love everything about him
[1:19:34] and then
[1:19:47] and that's what jesus said it's
[1:19:48] excruciating all that the father has
[1:19:51] drawn
[1:19:52] all that the father has called
[1:19:55] the belt
[1:19:56] will come
[1:19:58] hallelujah but this is the part i love
[1:20:01] is that
[1:20:01] he said the king
[1:20:03] hath brought me into his chambers
[1:20:08] hallelujah
[1:20:10] oh my god the king has brought me
[1:20:14] into his chambers
[1:20:58] and we realized this morning
[1:21:02] the only way
[1:21:04] you could ever truly worship god
[1:21:07] you must worship god in spirit
[1:21:10] and in
[1:21:13] and truth see that is what it is lacking
[1:21:16] among us
[1:21:18] it's not the truth
[1:21:20] it's the spirit of the truth
[1:21:23] it is the anointing of god
[1:21:26] we seem to be afraid of don't know
[1:21:29] but this is not something
[1:21:32] that you should be afraid of
[1:21:34] this is something that you must embrace
[1:21:38] and this annoying
[1:21:41] is thing
[1:21:41] welcoming anointing
[1:21:43] is that right you must welcome jesus
[1:21:47] is that right you must worship him
[1:21:50] and welcome him
[1:21:52] hallelujah
[1:21:53] see the bride is moving the lord spoke
[1:21:56] that to my heart the other day
[1:21:59] he's moving
[1:22:00] there's some who are standing still
[1:22:03] there are some who are confused
[1:22:06] but the bride of jesus christ
[1:22:17] god is literally changing her from the
[1:22:19] inside out
[1:22:36] that god
[1:22:49] hallelujah but i'm telling you what i'm
[1:22:51] feasting on
[1:22:53] i'm feasting on that bread of life
[1:22:56] that was beyond beyond the veil
[1:22:58] hallelujah
[1:23:00] that bread behind the veil
[1:23:02] never would grow old
[1:23:12] even if you were dead when you laid back
[1:23:15] there
[1:23:16] that that kind of glory
[1:23:31] there's only one place of worship
[1:23:34] hallelujah and the only way you're going
[1:23:36] to be able to worship him you must find
[1:23:38] that one place
[1:23:40] let me tell you something
[1:23:42] most of them
[1:23:43] this message
[1:23:45] has literally struck destroyed
[1:24:01] strike you
[1:24:02] it's something of yesterday
[1:24:05] it may have been yesterday
[1:24:08] my god
[1:24:10] because he's the saying
[1:24:12] yesterday yeah today
[1:24:14] and forever
[1:24:28] is jesus hallelujah however they acted
[1:24:31] on the day of pentecost
[1:24:34] that's how they should be acting now
[1:24:37] oh but they said
[1:24:38] why are they doing something we're
[1:24:39] beyond that
[1:24:41] i don't know about you
[1:24:56] he
[1:24:59] [Music]
[1:25:11] the first place of worship
[1:25:14] is in his chambers he don't see
[1:25:17] you know i entitled my message
[1:25:20] of abraham seed
[1:25:52] hallelujah the bride of jesus christ
[1:25:56] she moves like abraham
[1:25:59] because she is abraham's seed
[1:26:02] not the natural seed
[1:26:04] but the spiritual seed of abraham
[1:26:17] where is your life right now
[1:26:20] i'm putting you
[1:26:33] god is more than a
[1:26:48] until first you
[1:27:16] hallelujah y'all understand what he's
[1:27:18] saying
[1:27:20] oh let me let me say this church can't
[1:27:22] save you synthetic
[1:27:26] that's right because the lamb
[1:27:28] is a heat
[1:27:30] and not a
[1:27:43] that was the only place in worship it
[1:27:46] wasn't the temple of the pharisees
[1:27:48] it wasn't the temple of the sadducees
[1:27:51] hallelujah it wasn't even peter
[1:27:55] hallelujah
[1:27:58] there was only one place of worship
[1:28:01] and god himself says the jew remembers
[1:28:04] hallelujah this is my beloved son
[1:28:07] in whom i'm well pleased to dwell in
[1:28:11] places
[1:28:12] pointed to the right
[1:28:21] [Music]
[1:28:31] [Applause]
[1:28:38] of the spirit of god
[1:28:49] he's not like a black bird putting on
[1:28:51] peacock feathers
[1:29:07] is
[1:29:21] the reason why
[1:29:37] and come to understand
[1:29:39] what we figure
[1:29:40] to salvation
[1:29:42] it's almost done something you don't see
[1:29:45] people running to the message anymore
[1:29:48] you see them running away from the
[1:29:50] message hallelujah
[1:30:22] because when you break connection with
[1:30:23] jesus
[1:30:29] when you don't pray
[1:30:32] you follow
[1:30:34] me
[1:30:35] when you trust
[1:30:37] in what we call the message
[1:30:41] now i may explain that
[1:30:44] when you trust those schools in the
[1:30:46] system
[1:30:47] of this message to save you there's a
[1:30:49] message you're no different than the
[1:30:51] pentecostals
[1:30:55] hello
[1:30:56] god said to nicodemus
[1:30:58] you must be born again
[1:31:13] don't you say that too loud but that's
[1:31:15] the truth there's only one savior the
[1:31:17] concern and that's jesus christ
[1:31:19] hallelujah even john pointed to him he
[1:31:22] says listen
[1:31:24] that's coming look i'm not even worthy
[1:31:27] to unleash his shoes
[1:31:42] somebody help me here man it's the truth
[1:31:45] say why
[1:31:46] god is talking about your religion
[1:31:49] islam had religion for hundreds and
[1:31:51] thousands of years islam
[1:31:54] what about israel israel has religion
[1:31:58] and then when jesus came they called him
[1:31:59] a devil
[1:32:01] hallelujah it's the same thing i'm sure
[1:32:04] even in this message
[1:32:41] but if y'all don't get up in the message
[1:32:43] if y'all don't get up in in in and
[1:32:44] listen i know what i'm preaching
[1:32:46] y'all might think i don't know what i'm
[1:32:48] saying football secretary
[1:32:50] i don't boast on me i'm just saying
[1:32:52] that's right
[1:33:06] i think about uh
[1:33:08] brother branham
[1:33:10] and the and the and and in the age he
[1:33:12] had to deal with
[1:33:14] the way he preached
[1:33:16] he told those people
[1:33:18] yo speaking in tongues
[1:33:34] a threat you don't see
[1:33:36] people they did not think that brother
[1:33:38] branham was a threat he was saying
[1:33:40] he didn't mean us he was not in the
[1:33:42] department but the voice of god
[1:33:45] hallelujah
[1:33:46] yes sir
[1:33:48] they sent out what they did the um fbi
[1:33:51] it's own word
[1:33:52] sent them into his meeting
[1:33:55] to see how genuine he was
[1:33:58] you know
[1:33:59] they went back and says
[1:34:01] really nothing's to him
[1:34:29] and the world is still shaking is that
[1:34:32] right
[1:34:33] they thought jesus wasn't a threat
[1:34:36] we killed him they say don't you come
[1:34:38] here what they did not see
[1:34:42] there was a resurrection coming
[1:34:44] hallelujah
[1:34:57] supposed to do
[1:35:10] having the same power
[1:35:15] this is not a sunday school that's it
[1:35:17] called the demons well you're just
[1:35:19] coming in and just set so still and
[1:35:21] quiet
[1:35:25] you're afraid
[1:35:43] more than once
[1:35:45] and you know what nobody has to say
[1:35:46] y'all come dancing
[1:35:49] start the music don't sit on celebrity
[1:35:51] and everybody in their seat they get up
[1:35:53] and they move
[1:35:54] it's the most
[1:36:02] i saw some brothers with some moves i
[1:36:03] didn't even know they could move like
[1:36:05] that
[1:36:07] but you see it's it's it's the anointing
[1:36:10] of the wedding
[1:36:13] that comes with it that makes you want
[1:36:15] to lose
[1:36:16] no i don't know this is what is
[1:36:18] happening now
[1:36:20] this is a
[1:36:23] this wedding an invisible union what
[1:36:25] could happen to you just now
[1:36:28] if you open your heart and mine
[1:36:32] whatever blessings you got for me just
[1:36:34] this morning i want them
[1:36:36] to those
[1:37:02] at least i get some sound out of you
[1:37:18] x-ray and they'll never be able to see
[1:37:19] it
[1:37:20] x-rays it's impossible
[1:37:23] but once that seed is quicken
[1:37:27] it becomes visible
[1:37:29] hallelujah
[1:37:32] i think about how often we imprison
[1:37:35] ourselves during the week
[1:37:39] and we we we condemn ourselves all day
[1:37:42] long
[1:37:44] oh god i did that's wrong
[1:37:47] oh god i did that wrong
[1:37:49] how can i be bribed and i do all this
[1:37:51] well
[1:37:54] you never could be bribed
[1:37:56] based on your words
[1:38:00] your work should never get you there
[1:38:03] look how paul says paul says i'm
[1:38:05] blameless
[1:38:07] there's nothing against me
[1:38:10] but at the same token he's the old
[1:38:12] wretched man that i am
[1:38:14] who shall
[1:38:41] [Music]
[1:38:56] romans 6 2 2 oh man four six two two it
[1:38:59] says
[1:39:00] as david also described the blessed
[1:39:03] blessedness of the man
[1:39:06] unto whom god imputed righteousness
[1:39:08] without works did you remember that
[1:39:10] video oh
[1:39:20] [Music]
[1:39:23] where god will not charge
[1:39:38] that's what the blood did for you
[1:39:41] glory to god that's what the blood did
[1:39:44] for you
[1:39:45] but you know what we have these old
[1:39:47] self-righteous spirits like whips
[1:39:49] you know better
[1:39:51] let me tell you something and i don't
[1:39:52] want to point
[1:40:04] amen
[1:40:08] if it wasn't for the holy ghost
[1:40:11] you'll be singing all the time
[1:40:15] and don't tell me you better than me
[1:40:16] because you wash with a different
[1:40:18] smelling soup
[1:40:46] in this cleansing power we call the
[1:40:49] blood of jesus christ
[1:40:56] and if they're all washed away
[1:40:59] see something that means i'm sinless so
[1:41:02] that's the picture
[1:41:21] oh my god
[1:41:23] see we we you know we look at this thing
[1:41:26] and i don't think i don't if you really
[1:41:28] catch the revelation
[1:41:41] you think i don't go through trials
[1:42:12] you can't waiver
[1:42:54] it back on you
[1:42:56] there's no unbelief in god
[1:43:00] hallelujah come on somebody
[1:43:03] john ryan didn't have the faith that he
[1:43:04] needed to have
[1:43:06] jean aveda
[1:43:07] because he was raised in some of these
