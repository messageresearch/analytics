good giving us grace today let's just go right into the word of the Lord we'll be coming from revelations to five fifth chapter please Thank You sirs revelations five God is such a good God revelations the fifth chapter for me your scripture we're going to read the second through the fifth verse and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David have proclaimed prevail scuse me to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof Ephesians 1 please Ephesians 1 Ephesians 1 we'll begin reading at the first chapter beginning at the 4th verse let's start at the second verse grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ that's a lot said grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ has already done it according as he have chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he have made us accepted in the beloved that last verse to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he have made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sin according to the riches of His grace let us pray father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us father we ask that you would have preeminence tonight forgive us cleanse us from all unrighteousness Lord for every moment Oh God that we fail to give you honor and Thanksgiving forgive us Lord strengthen us Lord in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated I based my message tonight on the message of grace message I think that everybody ought to don't listen to I like to entitle the service or the message tonight the capstone of grace we have heard many times you know the preacher preached on the opening of the seals we've heard about how the voice of God thundered throughout the seven church ages one of the things that always made me marvel was that nobody was worthy and when I listened to and hear the Word of God when it says no one was worthy that exactly what it meant there was only one who was worthy and that one was Jesus Christ himself the Bible called him the lamb because he is the lamb slain before the foundation of the world when we think about predestination we must understand that even predestination is God's love and His grace we see by God's grace that none of us were worthy and I often think that we forget that I was thinking today as I thought about the word because we can see how even the deed of the Nicolaitans how it slipped in because under the grace covenant no man is greater than the other we are all saved by grace no other way can be saved it doesn't matter how faithful you are in church how will you do with your tithing how you could be a preacher you can preach like an angel you can sing like one and that still doesn't guarantee you salvation you can be the most attractive man a woman in church and it still doesn't give you any credibility to heaven the only thing that can accredit us to heaven is the grace of God when we think about God in his wonderful mind I was thinking today I was thinking about myself and how when God saved me I thought lord if I would judge myself as how far was I away from God and I thought about all of the planets and all of the stars that are so distance from the Sun and I think about how one of those stars out there is a type of meat and I couldn't even grasp the amount of miles or the distance away I would be from our Sun because you realized that everything began with that ball of fire that we call the Sun when God spoke it you see what I'm saying and I was thinking I said Lord even if I was a billion miles away from you you knew exactly where I was and I thought about the depth of that how even how it didn't matter how how far I was God was able to light my candle he was able to bring something into existence that the mind can't even comprehend and then I thought about all of that darkness yet and still the covering or the masking of darkness could not hide of what who and what I was understand me let me say it again let me say it in a better way those stars no matter how dark it is out there are able to penetrate the darkness because they were made to be that way and even though you and I didn't even know who we were when we were sinners we were sinners some of our lives were wicked and some were more wicked than others but in the masking of that darkness there was nothing that could hide the light that God placed in you before the foundation of the world am i making sense because you got to realize that if the seed gene of God was in you before the foundation of the world it wasn't a physical gene it was a spiritual gene and that gene came from God and that gene in itself was light and the light penetrated the darkness and when we think about how God has been so good to us we must understand that we are now moving toward the Creator who created us now that might sound a little strange but I believe by God's grace you and I remember how Solomon temple was built and every piece of stone that built Solomon's Temple no matter where the stone was located that piece of ground was foreordained predestinated to be part of solomon's temple and one day those stones were cut hallelujah and brought together to build a temple think about it when we think about how the Great Pyramid was created or made we believe by God's grace according to the message Enoch built that pyramid and that pyramid was symbolic not only of New Jerusalem but it was symbolic of the body of Christ stones huge stones cut shaped a meant to bring about a what we call a pyramid that even man can not build today but in those stones we have been represented is that right because it represents about in Christ is that right the prophet of God tells us that even the seven steps to the king chamber seven Church ages is written in Enochs Bible hallelujah and Enochs pyramid in his type is an earthen Bible this is why they could not put the capstone or the headstone because in this statue it was perfect and it was covered with gold now they don't have to go there now you know because people have ripped the gold apart I've been in the pyramid I've been there and there's a king in the King's Chamber I've been there and there's only one way up one way ha and there's only one way out and in that King's Chamber there's a place for our a coffin but there was nobody there there was no coffin there to show that he wasn't gonna stay dead he was gonna rise again now you and I must realize that all of that was done for who you and I we're not only in the stars but even in the earthling Bible we're there we're in there somewhere it is a mystery in this a scientific mystery nobody knows you know exactly how they built it brother branham said amen it had to have been a way that they built it and and he was talking about how it had to be atomic it had to be laser way beyond the skills that they had we'll way beyond what we have now because we can't build a pyramid we wouldn't know how to we have a hard time with our bricks but in all of that it was showing that only God had the ability to build the pyramid no man could do it without the instructions somebody helped me hear and understand Enoch was a prophet and God used the Prophet amen to build that huge pyramid guess what and nobody knows who built it but those who are believers today and we know Enoch did it by the instructions of God hallelujah inna hallelujah built the pyramid and then God showed by his own light about that in our walk with God and he was found not he built the pyramid and therefore he was chant translated he was raptured and you look at these things and you say to yourself was he worthy the Bible says no man even though Enoch built the Pyramid he still wasn't worthy he was only worthy by the grace of God Holly Lou who tell somebody help me here because I want you to realize it meant that no matter how well he not lived and about said he walked with God but you must understand that Enoch Amen was a man built a born by a woman hallelujah he was conceived in sin shaped in iniquity and he had the sinful nature of a man how did he make it hallelujah I like to believe that he gleaned from the blood of the Lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world is that right had to been because when Jesus died I'm jumping here and rose again Enoch was among them is that right he had to bend because only Moses and Elijah comes to live again so you must understand that when God does things he does it in a way Amen that it's the mystery but the unfolding of the seals listen if you go back and you listen it meant to the message of grace God will flood your mind he'll let you see and then what he's trying to bring to his people we have heard and I'm just going to preach it we have heard about Abraham and the Bible said Abraham spare not at the promises of God but according to history Abraham had problems hallelujah but after Abraham after the sacrificial lamb of Jesus Christ after Calvary the blood of Jesus Christ the real true lamb was applied to Abraham so therefore there was a there was no record that Paul could find that was terrible there was nothing left of seeing oh there was nothing left hallelujah so all Paul could do was write about the good things Abraham staggered not at the promise of God and you and I must realize amen what was it it was the grace of God hallelujah Paul made mistakes but guess what there was nothing left on his record because when you are accepted in the blood of Jesus Christ the Bible tells us there was no darkness in him and you and I are justified as though we've never seen in the first place now don't get me wrong because some people want to take Grace and make a disgrace and the Bible says shall we continue in sin that grace may abound what is sin it's not smoking it's not drinking is not carousing sin is when you disbelieve the Word of God shall we continue in disbelief in what way that God can take the vilest sinner and make him clean hallelujah God can take the worst of worst and make him clean hallelujah and I want you to understand in God's Bible you didn't have to be a good fella to make it who didn't get no Ignis on that one you don't have to be a good man for God to save you you don't have to be a rich man for God to save you hallelujah the Bible said that will save by grace and not by works lest any man should boast now you've got to understand this because when you truly say you truly will do the work of God because you want to show God how much you appreciate his grace somebody helped me here you and I must understand Amen that when Jesus Christ came you said Oh what are you saying brother books I won't you I'm jumping I've jumped so much but I mean let me put it this way the Bible says Amen that that Jesus Christ would be the very cornerstone that's why we preach Jesus that's why no church can save you no bishop no pork no presbyterian it doesn't matter what denomination you think you be your part of it cannot save you there's only one provided way and that is under the blood of Jesus Christ is that right it was God's Way blood way before Jesus came into this dimension because the Bible said the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world hallelujah I would I want to liberate us tonight from the bodies and the yokes and then the Satan is placed on us yes we are to live right before God but even then is still the grace of God is that right blessed is the man according to Psalms 32 blessed is a man whom God will not impute iniquity hallelujah we are that generation oh I came to the message you came to the message only because God drew you and when God drew you that was His grace when God opened the eyes of the blind it is the grace of God hello but what did the man who were brought born blind for 30 years what did he do to marry site but nothing and the Bible said he was born lying that God might be glorified and you and I were born sinners that God may be glorified it's all about Jesus it's all about him it is the true message of grace and if we could see it will make her rapture because we will stop mixing law with grace Oh somebody help me here name one one man that did it perfectly all you had to do is you break one word even Joseph who looked like the perfect one lied he said that his family work cannot hurt us when they were sheep or shepherds who won that's all it took one one one one lie one word one word broken and the Bible said we are condemned and we're guilty of them all hallelujah somebody help me here you and I must realize the devil keeps us from seeing things the way we see them if we understood grace we will understand love if you understand love you understand faith if you understand thank you understand Grace and one in the same it all goes back to God faith is a gift and that is a gift of grace somebody help me here listen the psalmist says amen according to the songs one in 1820 said the gate of the Lord into which the righteous share in time I will praise thee for thou has heard me and art become my salvation the stone and and see the whole world can't see this some people think Jesus is still dead hallelujah some people think that he was it was a whole thing and they stole his body and whatever case may be but there are those who know differently the stone which the builders refused to come the head of the throne of the corner guess what he says the Lord this is the Lord's doing as I said and it's marvelous in eyes I like that word marvelous this is the day which the Lord have made and we will rejoice and be glad in it you cannot be glad in that day if you feel like a sinner if you think Amen your failure and God knows the devil has played that trick on me many times but I cannot be no more of a failure than God can be a failure hallelujah because when you're part of God oh you will never be named as a failure you can't be ba because of the grace of God am i making sense the word is real folks we you know when we see what Jesus Christ has done for us it will illuminate you it will get you excited so excited all day and i'ma tell you something even the enemy tried to do something that I'm like oh but god is great god is good god is God hallelujah in the message of grace brother Adam saw something that was magnificent and he saw three rainbows and he said those rainbows look like they lived and they were living he said and he said those three came together in one Bowl and he heard the word the Jesus of the New Testament is Jehovah of the old what was it it meant three manifestations of God put in one body and the Bible said in him was the fullness of the Godhead bodily Oh to help me here he is the capstone brother he is the headstone - what a body hallelujah a body that's one thing I love about a fountain that fountain shoots up and then that water comes down like this I've got a brother who built a pyramid outside of his church a small one fountain and when he built it he actually had he had the water coming up where'd that space and then of course the headstone there that's it it is the anointing that will uh how could I say like this the Bible says we are born into the body of Christ by one spirit we are united in Jesus Christ by the Spirit of God hallelujah c'mon Sumathi so you must understand if you just think because oh I belong to this church I'm the only one no sir God has stones everywhere and when the pressure comes God gonna pull it all together hallelujah yes sir yes sir many are saved but God is working on a bride that can lose herself and when I say it like this the Bible says there are now no condemnation to those who walk after Christ who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit no condemnation none so what does he say if you've got the Holy Ghost you have no condemnation against you but because God has justified every mistake you've made as a mistake he's made oh what are you saying look at Abraham did he justify his mistakes what about all the others God justified him oh come on somebody and I tell you if you look at Dave he David messed up hallelujah and gods feel justified hmm yes he did and David plotted he was a worker of iniquity he plotted against his soldier Uriah plotted against him took his wife impregnated her hallelujah and God still said David you are man after my own heart he never changed it and David loved God loved David so much he calls himself the son of David Oh somebody help me but that does not give us a right to just go out and sin if you go out and do things you know it's wrong something's not quite right you need to go back to the altar okay you now must understand this is not a time to glorify ourselves there's nothing great about me there's nothing great about you it's all about Jesus cries oh my Paul says is listen this what Paul says Paul said to live is gain halle-loo to live we're in Christ it's not hard I'm not living anymore it's Christ that lives in me and a brother and I we were talking we said we just want to see God and that's all we want to see I'm tired of seeing this all I want to do is see Jesus hallelujah it's my desire it's my thirst and because it is my desire and it's my thirst he gave it to me and therefore the Bible said if you thirst after righteousness you shall be filled oh my feeling is coming hallelujah my brother Oh we'll go there but let me say like this grace makes us glorify Jesus because you realize there's no way you could make it and I'm gonna jump a lot a little bit because I'm not gonna be long tonight it's a short message but I'm gonna say it like this when God told Adam and Eve the day that you eat of this tree you shall surely die I'm gonna come back to the other stuff and they did it they had no way out of it they were caught they would make it with it yeah yeah understand me they were naked with it God saw it but the brilliant thing the wonderful thing about it when they some self saw that they were naked is when they approach or God approached them then they realized they had no holiness she let me tell you something without the grace of God you have no holiness you just like Adam and Eve hiding behind fig leaves without the grace of God Hey hallelujah and it's God's grace that provided that lamb for them what's they do what did they do they weren't even straight up with God if I could say it like this they kept passing the buck like we do sometime hallelujah ain't nobody fault but your own if you sin that sin is on you and then nobody's called a devil ated me do it the devil didn't make nothing you did it because you wanted to is that right I'll come home the Bible tells us according to James when you drown after lust the lust is from from you not God now you can argue with that if you want to and say somebody made me do it but your lust got the best of you Amen but in all of that James said if you confess your false hallelujah he's faithful and just to forgive you of your sin and to cleanse you from all unrighteousness in other words God brings it back down to zero whoo hallelujah think about it o people of God you think about it here is I said things about glorifying yourself and you know a lot of in it and I've seen it I've seen it I've seen that everywhere and I just pray to God and keep me from ever going in a way that I think I'm something cuz I know I'm nothing you know people don't hurt my feelings when they say you're not deep cuz they're right I'm not deep and I can't only preach what he gives to me I'm gonna be the level on the level I am I if you don't give me nothing like somebody else that's okay I'm right where I'm supposed to be ain't gonna try to impersonate nobody because people don't accept me that's that's insane hallelujah amen if God done made me a flute and not a trombone I ain't gonna try to act like a trombone I'm gonna be my love flew hallelujah Oh glory to kasi listen Jesus even told us he says listen there's a parable according to Mark 12 and he says listen 1 through 12 I'm just gonna paraphrase it here was a man who had a vineyard and he set a hedge about it placed it you know built the tower hired husband and then he went to a far country in other words he let people take care of his farm but instead of taking care of his farm somehow they forgot it wasn't their farm kind of like the donkey that was carrying Jesus and perhaps the donkey got confused like some of the preachers and all of the cheering came and whoo Jesus Hosanna Hosanna and you can see the donkey almost like but it wasn't father donkey it was full of man riding on the donkey but see that's how it is with the preachers sometimes they think oh praise God I so enjoyed the Word of God it's okay is it couraging but it's only because God used you that was God the glory goes to God the frogs go to God that's why the prophet of God said he said I just don't like it when people say well you know brother so-and-so laid his hands on me and I got healed he said because what that does he said it gives them glory it gives them something when they don't do it ain't dinner no man can heal no man it's God God must get all the glory amen anyway these husband who was so internet thing beat the they they beat hired servants like when God was sent a prophet or God was sent a servant these men would would either be hurt or kill or beaten and God kept sending people is that right that's just the way God does it he always sent a witness the Bible said he never leaves himself without a witness but then Jesus came and it's all you see they knew who he was this is the son of the of the man who hired us listen what they say let us kill him that we might get his inheritance and that's exactly what the Pharisees and the Sadducees did they knew Jesus was the son of God according to this parable and they killed him anyway because they wanted they wanted his inheritance hello and you know what that's exactly what we do ignorant Lee God give us gifts and we use these gifts and talents for our own selves and what we do we rather kill Jesus I don't want to hear that gospel I want to play the blues I want to play rock and roll I want to do this I want to pray I want to do all and God gave you the talent it's not even yours but kill Jesus and so you can get all the money in the glory that's what people do in this message they kill the name of the messenger so they can get the glory that alright and you you know by God's grace that many has become millionaires in this message because they'd used the message for their own glory and guess what I'm not saying they lost but I know one thing Moses when he glorified himself didn't cross over took him so many hundreds of years before he got to Palestine he got there that's what brother Han said he got there but God wants blowing only God won't slurry it doesn't mean I guess a brother been saving this brethren no because the prophet of God says and I think it's easier he said a true Mount Transfiguration experience will only glorify Jesus Christ hallelujah but I am one that knows you cannot talk about the floor did not mention Noah it all goes together is this ok now let me hurry so you can understand and imma imma almost say this some let me let me see can I find that that understand that the name of Jesus Christ what he gate has given us it's so powerful I think we just it's become so common we don't even realize you know what what it what it really is and and and I brother Frank sent me a text today which was a real good quotient and and then went right with the Word of God their house preparing and my thing is is that we well we said oh we know Jesus Christ but we forget we are in his name your name has been changed if you have been born again your name has been changed hello why do you think that the Bible according the book of Revelation says the spirit and the bride say come because they have the same spirit and with the same spirit they have the same name and the same name we can accomplish the same thing that's why the Bible said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever hmm let this mind be in you him how of course which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but here is here here it is but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made like unto men he said I can't do nothing except the father show me what did the man at the Pool of Bethesda do that was different from all the rest why did God come to him the Bible said he wasn't even a bad situation you know saying he can get in and out of the pool there were people who were worse often him he just had an affliction and God came to him and said take up your bed and walk what was that God's grace and the Bible said Jesus Christ who was full of grace and truth who was it it was a capstone at the time he was just that the cornerstone but when the cornerstone was rejected he rose up to the top that same cornerstone the Bible said has now become the head of the corner how do you think you're gonna get out of here it's gonna take the Holy Spirit hey somebody help me here you understand it is the spirit it's not by power it's not by might but it's by my spirit says the Lord that's why the devil wants you to be cold and starchy in every church because he knows it is the anointing that destroy the yokes you want to be set free you've got to have Jesus he's the only one that can set you free and I'm not talking about just Jesus the word it must be Jesus the word that's living hallelujah and you got to unclog your faith channels is that right this is the quote now I kind of add it a little bit more if you abide in me and my word about in you then you have God the word in you and you believe the word just as you believe God because it is God somebody help me here if you can catch it if you can really grasp that in your heart this word is God whatever it says it's God and it must come to pass if you believe you gotta believe it oh you gotta believe it is that right hey and if you believe that well just as you believe God's Word it is God and it is it's inseparable in other words his word and himself is inseparable then if you have God's Word in you you have God's life in you you have God in you and whatsoever God's Word speaks forth out of you it has to come the past just like it was spoken from God myself is that we need to get in that channel we need to get in the channel of God so that God can speak through us whatsoever you ask the Father in my name that will I do did you ever realize what that means do you realize if we go before God in the name of Jesus it's just the same as Jesus himself pray I know we've heard it but let's hear the game it isn't me any praying anymore if I come in his name and he and he recognize his name and Jesus said whatsoever you ask the Father in my name that I'll do you know that's the difference you can't come in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost you can't even come just in Jesus his name is Lord Jesus Christ when he recognizes his name whatever you ask or Jesus Christ however you want to put it because because that's why I didn't know what I was doing I had a spirit of techne years ago and I kept saying Jesus Jesus Jesus and that demon stayed right there did move and when I said the Lord Jesus Christ he left me because there's a mini Jesus you got to know which one you're talking about hallelujah hundreds of down there in Mexico hallelujah and none of them of my Savior no not even your Savior there's only one Savior the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah whatsoever you ask the Father in my name that I'll do and then I go to the Father in Jesus name it isn't me praying anymore it's Jesus it's his spirit praying through me and then I've got to receive what I asked for right my point is you say Jesus understand you're talking about God if your revelation of Jesus is God you got it but if you got the name Jesus and you thinking he's just part of the Trinity you ain't got it you got to call Jesus according to the revelation of which he is for today is that right if it wasn't important why after all of those years the prophet of God was preaching about the Jesus Christ God comes along in the form of a rainbow and expressly says Jesus of the New Testament is your hova of the own and then the Prophet goes on and says it can't be like the oneness Jesus only and it can't be like the Trinity especially the extreme father the Father the Son the Holy Ghost see they all they're wrong there's a balance he said God was in Christ Wow hallelujah if you could just understand God was in Christ let me put it and say God was in you or crisis in you it's the same as God is in Christ the same God the same God in you and then I've got to listen what he goes on to says do you realize if we be we go before God in the name of Jesus it is just the same as Jesus himself praying it isn't me praying anymore if I come in his name and he recognized his name and Jesus said whatsoever you ask the Father in my name what is the name of the Father mm-hmm absolutely thou shalt call his name Jesus right but the completeness of that was further revealed hallelujah down throughout the ages right come on folks y'all don't know brother branham brought the the real revelation of the name of Jesus Christ the one has had a piece of it the Trinity had a piece of it but the full manifestation of that revelation came by way of Malachi 4 and he showed that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's a God that changes not now the problem is we did not see the kind of grace that God has bestowed upon us Grace and peace be multiplied praise and peace be multiplied we're unto you it's when you realize who you are and there is no kind of weapon formed against you can prosper none hallelujah we've got to really start believing in the is that right come on let me bring it down to the scripture Peter only had one thing silver and gold have I none but as I have give ID rise in the name of Jesus Christ that was the that was the weapon of the early church the name but they had a revelation of the name and they understood that that name was not just something far fetched out there in the space somewhere it was in them they held the name within them they became the temple of the Lord Jesus Christ that's the headstone that's the capstone you and I want to make this it's going to only be by grace grace will give you the ability to decline the latter not by power not by might but by my spirit is that right let me jump let me move on grace is that which is freely given unmerited favor and love of God it is the influence or Spirit of God operating in a human to regenerate or strengthen them it is a virtue of excellence of divine origin grace is and I thought oh god I'm not just in grace but I'm in a state of grace hallelujah and when you are in a state of grace it shows him in the manner of position that you're standing in it shows your condition I cannot and neither can you make heaven or a rapture without the grace of God because no man was worth is this okay now I read description I'm a reading and I'm a fifteen more minutes Zechariah for chapter sixteen fourteenth then he answered in speaking to me saying this is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel saying not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of Hosts did you know that who art Thou O great mountain before zerubabbel thou should become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shouting crying grace grace unto it it's built by grace well over the world of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of the roof I have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it he that began a good work in you is faithful to complete it is that right and thou shalt know the Lord of holes have sent me unto you for who have despised the day of small things but they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hands of the rouble with those seven well they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the you didn't come to God God sought you out hallelujah then answered I and said unto him what are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof and I answered again and said unto him what be these two olive branches went through which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves golden oil don't mind me I'm I'm stimulated amen and he answered me and said no it dog not what these be and I said no my lord then said he these are the two anointed ones that stand by the Lord of the whole earth hmm you know what the ruble would mean you know what brother Branham did he came to disperse the confusion but why where where did this confusion come from it didn't come from Zerubbabel it means a stranger at Babylon was he not and he was a prince did you know that the ruble was a prince I'm a reader just for you in just a minute you and I must understand that Jesus of the New Testament is your home of the old and this Great Pyramid in type is the body of Christ the New Jerusalem the holy city the body of Christ it's all of that listen the Prophet God said we are acquainted with scripture that reads the Bible we know that this was during the time of preparation of restoration of the temple restoration of the temple regarding fill in the natural temple anymore God is building a spiritual house and you and I are called living stones and God is building us right now hallelujah you think you're not going to be used but God cut some of those stones were ugly and some were pretty and yet God fit them right into the building hey God have mercy hmm so ruler was a great prince among the people who had laid the foundation there's bill now you now you I want you to put on your spiritual thinking anointing jacket this morning or this evening we think and this Great Prince had determined to rebuild the house of the Lord and when he did he had laid the foundation stone did he not do it now that's a room above us in tight back there but we experienced the reality the foundation was relayed the foundation was not Baptist the foundation was not no denominational organization the foundation went right back to the foundation that Pauline and Paul said I've laid no other foundation there outside of Christ Jesus himself that's what you build upon that's how we build upon the foundation of Jesus Christ and we know that the scriptures that says that Jesus Christ is the chief Cornerstone and he also the headstone now and we will think for minutes that the seven churches who was to restore the faith of the children back to the Father in other words we build the church again under the power of the Spirit not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord not by organization not by denomination but by the spirit God will bring forth the church in the last day the moment you say Amen that if you don't if you don't believe what I believe you are denomination and you die it ain't what you believe is what the Bible says the Bible is right you understand me that's why so many people in this message have done the same thing well if you don't believe this Purusha if you don't believe this done if you don't believe this they're and they divide Christ Paul says it's Christ divided absolutely not there's only one body and the only way you get in this body you must be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah and baptized by his spirit I'm talking about Bride now y'all talking about pride cuz bride will keep every word the problem is we don't know that a lot of people still gonna be saved who's not a part of this so that can't be right then who is the foolish virgins so rouble oh the prince with Joshua oh I love there is that right because that's what he was William Branham Malachi 4 was a type of Zerubbabel as a rule the type of him hallelujah and who was he with Joshua and who is Joshua Jesus was the one that was to bring forth the headstone he had laid the foundation here took the prints people back to the foundation in time now you know what I'm saying stuff that's been preached years ago but it still ought to be good to you it still ought to be good to you this manner should never this manner never grows old hallelujah y'all know y'all know the stuff but I'm a preacher like it I never yeah that's the way it's supposed to be preached freshly hallelujah which we all know that these can decision so forth represents both Jewish in church there were other branches the Bible says here and the five olive branch we are the wild branch that was grafted into the root of the tang olive tree Gentiles did that right and out of these two branches come since his pipes going into the seven golden candlesticks to give like to the seven churches so all I'm trying to say is we are a part of the candelabra ami it wasn't seven fires lit it was one fire lit and those one lit all the others hallelujah if the Holy Ghost don't light your fire your fire won't get lit hallelujah let me hurry up that's the way the body of Jesus Christ should be so cut by the so cut let me back it up because y'all know in arts pyramid that Pyramid of Egypt they call it the Great Pyramid it was so built it was soaked that there was a modern no mortar in between it was the stone just lays so flat that even a razor blade couldn't get through it listen we have no machines that could tear it up no machine that can lift not even one of the stones tons come on somebody there is no man-made machinery that can rip the bride of Jesus Christ apart I don't care how mysterious we may look to them they cannot divide us because we are born into one body by the Spirit of God a real believer will stay with the real believer no matter if you different in your doctrine they don't know our Holy Ghost field person when they meet them is that right grace not a disgrace what could they offer God what could they offer God what can you offer God grace is old Grace's old Grace's old as the world is grace was first shown to the human race when he had a beginning of a human race and when the human race was first created in the Garden of Eden on that dog morning when that little woman that stepped across the separating line and had gone against God commanding and a husband to do the same thing then the law was broken the law must have a penalty or is isn't no law and the law was the day you eat thereof is the day you should surely die my point is if God had killed them both it would have been the end of the human race Adam could not save Eve spiritually because he walked out willfully and Eve even if she died could not have saved Adam hallelujah so who provided the sacrifice the same God that produced the Grace in in the Alpha is producing the grace in the Omega hallelujah grace will make a way for you no matter what you are no matter who you are no matter how cold dead and in follow you may be God's grace if you have a heart that can repent God has a heart that could make it right so that's all God asks for us to do is repent is that right in the latest in ages that be zealous to repent huh think about it I'm closing on this story in spite of all Abraham's phase see this is the capstone birth system if you can see that in all of their faith God saved him anyway and David had multiple problems it wasn't bad enough to hear mess up with Bathsheba then he gonna go and count the people and God told him not to count hallelujah see it ain't your church is God's church and when you and I can realize they meant that by God's grace that God had made you a promise the Bible says if you believe that Jesus Christ is Lord and you confess that with your mouth and believe within your heart that he is our Lord and our Savior even our prophet the word said first of all you have passed from death unto life you said that can't be right well let me take you back to the thief on the cross people don't want to work with that cuz he did no works but what what what did he do to deserve Jesus sometimes what he reckoned no no no what made him recognize Jesus was an innocent lamb it was God's grace that opened his eyes and not one of us has a right to say who will be there and who won't be there you better just trust and hope you there huh that's all this about just pray that God gets you there cuz if you get there it's gonna be by His grace huh he could be by what you think you know that Paul said you can understand all mystery and still not have charity because you know what the Bible said that God would that none would perish if that's in your heart you got love hmm all men they don't come to repentance but he said he would his is his will that none would perish and you and I must understand by the grace of God if you can understand in grace you'll have lots of more love huh because you realize about yourself that you ain't so good after all without the grace of God all of us are who we are by the grace of God in it beautiful to know that the capstone the cornerstone where we saw the cow all right he was rejected we received him because he received him he receives us and then he in his last days comes and he confirms that Abraham covenant with you and makes you understand it's unconditional don't make it conditional he's unconditional and Abraham did not seek out to do evil made a lot of mistakes and God covered for me anyway so in spite of our mistakes we still have the grace of God working on our behalf you love the Lord one more thought let's tan remember that man that got drunk that preaches that ain't preaching on mo I'm not gonna follow Christ no more and he end up dying and brother branham said he was saved why because of the grace of God you think about Harry right brother man say what do you want she said the souls of my two sons those boys are out there in the world somewhere if they still livin last I heard they were but God gave them something that was eternal and no matter what people may look at says how can that be God always keeps his promises and whether man look at him said where he don't deserve to be there look what he did afterwards it ain't your business it's God's business that's one thing I love about grace is sovereignty God don't have to ask anybody's permission he is the only potentate he chooses who he wants to he saves we wants to he makes a vessel Avani makes a vessel of dishonor hallelujah and nobody gonna argue him argue with him is that right who should counsel the Lord anybody here wise enough to do it I just said by God's grace I'm so glad I'm so glad yes I'm so glad to be one of them and I can tell you one thing when God I don't heard the message of grace many times but this is the first time it really did something for me it was so time it came at a time when I needed it the most we're at a time where translation must come and until you see the grace of God how you gonna make it because you'll find yourself not worthy hello Bob said the zoo rubles started it in his room we're gonna finish it not by power not by might but by my spirit o God have mercy I can't even explain how I feel all day it's been like a whirlwind of joy of something going on the inside you know what and I I just know I'm a notch higher the way I feel that's the way I feel I know it's true in the present Oh God Almighty [Music] Chris of me troubled man hallelujah haha man [Applause] in the brand Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] breathe a bee ah [Music] enough [Music] let me let me say this because I'm hearing thoughts when grace finds you it doesn't put you in a place where you just lay down and say God do it grace makes you work you work because of grace you pray because of grace you fast because of grace you read your Bible because of grace grace will always ask for more grace Lord add to me give me the grace and add to me virtue knowledge temperance whatever you need give me grace Lord you say why cuz no man can add one cubit to his stature it takes the grace of God so I don't want you to think that I would just preaching on grace like you know you don't have to do nothing no you have to do something if you really have faith in God you will do something but don't think because you're doing something is what causes God to do what he's doing no God causing you to do something so he can do something if that makes sense hello God got me into baptize men and then God comes in baptized himself hello right God got preaches God got different ones to go out God could preach to the tree through the trees and through the wind but God's grace have already made a way that's okay Oh God couldn't say listen I'm going to Paul's house and I'ma tell salt Paul I'm gonna tell Saul he's been killing my people that end the way God did it he went through a man right he knocks all off the house then he called for a man man preach salvation to me God could have opened the eyes of the eunuch but he got a man by the name of Philip you understand me is God's way of grace and you and I must understand by the grace of God if you really listen that's going to be it's a pardon is not a pardon accepted accept to be accepted as a pardon grace is not grace until you accept it in the press [Music] [Music] [Music] troubles and Oh [Music] yeah Oh God [Music] Hey [Music] and whoa [Music] in the rain [Music] hola Prima to be a thank you we you [Music] tried-and-true and we thank you really [Music] thank you [Music] Hey [Music] piace [Music] [Applause] [Music] tried-and-true and we [Music] [Music] [Music] my last
