you you have your Bible I'd like to turn right in the scriptures tonight amen and turn to Galatians chapter 5 we're going to read a couple of scriptures here in Galatians chapter 5 and then also in Romans chapter 8 praise the Lord say Amen when you get there Galatians chapter 5 man the word of God says in verse 16 this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would but if you be led of the spirit you are not under the law and Romans 8:14 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear oh I love that scripture amen so many uh preachers and and and denominations even in the message try to bring a message of fear and law to bind you and to hold you but we have not received a spirit of bondage again to fear we came out of that amen we came out of a state of fear and and doubt amen and and worry but now we've been free amen you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God Amen and if children then heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together am amen and let us bow and pray Heavenly Father we just are thankful once again Lord that we can come into this set aside little Sanctuary tonight father Feast on your word Lord I Thank you for my brothers and sisters Lord that have that have come this this evening Lord Lord they've they've honored you Lord with their worship Lord we've invited your presence here Lord father now I just pray that as we set aside this time for your word Lord may you have the preeminence all things Lord may you come Lord and correct us where we need correction Lord may you come encourage us Lord when we need encouragement father speak to our hearts tonight I pray bless each one Lord bless this little congregation Lord this this light post Lord this Lighthouse oh God in this part of the country bless each one I pray Lord help us Lord just to surrender to your perfect will Lord may your presence Lord just be Mighty in your anointing Lord God may you teach us tonight Lord may you speak directly to us as my prayer we love you and give you the glory and the praise in Jesus name amen amen you can be seated tonight amen thank you amen I want to read to you a quote this is from Satan's Eden tonight we're speaking about we want to we want to kind of build on where we went this morning and and and and the things that we were uh seeing in the word of God and we we want to want to kind of expand on that a little bit if the Lord Wills but my subject tonight would be the headship of the word and um let me read this quote here in Satan's Eden brother Bram says now notice the Holy Spirit God's holy word had a man and a woman naked and didn't know it that was in Eden right how beautiful life of the word the seed the word God said there is a tree in the midst of the garden the woman and in the midst of the garden is this tree don't even touch it for the day you eat thereof that day you die they were wholly veiled from it they didn't know nothing about it darent to touch it they were wholly veiled they were safe in God's Pavilion they were alive they had no death around them Hallelujah they had perfect love for the other perfect life together they had perfect love perfect understanding of the love of God they had God's word and kept it and they were alive and safe in God's Eden with no death at all around them then Satan got Eve to listen to his Gospel of theology the gospel of knowledge higher schooling higher ethics better civilization higher education and so forth and he got her to stop and listen to him a minute to his reasonings which we are commanded to cast down amen and when he got her to listen to it now look he here the church is so and so it's been established for so long we one of the oldest churches in the country the mayor of the city goes I don't care what it is see if it's against God's word be against it that's your enemy amen anything that's against the word is your enemy amen amen anything that's for the word is your brother he's part of you amen notice she pulled off the holy Veil to see what the sex really was compare that what lust would really do she pulled the veil from off her eyes and the holy thing that God had put over her eyes she wanted knowledge to know what it was all about so she pulled the veil off to see what it was all about she listened to the devil and noticed what a place it put her in and they have done the same thing in each age thereafter always taking the intellectual side and has now built a kingdom of Satan knowledge his seed that he SED has took the world to be an Eden of death amen so tonight we want to speak to you about the headship of the word amen and you know this morning uh as as we were uh speaking about the children of the kingdom and how we enter into that Kingdom and the blessings of the Kingdom those those uh those benefits and the the blessings that we obtain as children of God only come as we put ourselves under the headship of the word of God Amen and that's what we want to speak about uh just for a few minutes here tonight the scripture tells us in Romans here that we read in Romans chapter 8 that as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons or The Offspring amen of God Amen they are the ones that is proof that they came from God Amen the leadership of the holy spirit in their life is the Hallmark of a true Son of God amen amen and we know that the spirit will never lead outside of the true word amen amen now one who claims to be a child and refuses the leadership of the Holy Spirit which came to remind us of the word to teach us the word amen they don't they can quickly be identified that they aren't what they claim to be amen amen is that right amen and so we recognize that this is the mark the leadership of the Holy Spirit under the headship of the word amen now we know that we all make mistakes from time to time amen and we're in a learning process and you know sometimes we fall and you know the little babies when they're learning to walk you don't you know when they they run and fall you don't tell them now don't you ever try and walk again right we just get them up and keep moving and they grow out of that and pretty soon they're on to something else amen and they fall figuratively and that and we encourage him amen God does the same thing with us Lord we're in a learning process but we're giving the holy ghost first place amen we're under the preeminence of the word of God so Jesus spoke of the promised coming of the holy spirit amen and he spoke of it in terms of the comforter and one that would teach you and lead you into all truth amen and since this is the very life spirit of God that we are talking about he is the Spirit of Truth and he cannot lead you into anything but the truth now many claim to be led of the spirit when really all they're doing is enjoying the anointing yes amen they're enjoying the rain but the Bible teaches us about that yeah even the tears enjoy the rain amen amen so the seed doesn't it doesn't matter what kind of seed you are any kind of seed can enjoy the blessings and the anointing of but what we're talking about is being led by the spirit to do the word and to submit to the headship of the word amen now this is not an easy thing for for the flesh amen and this is something that uh you know if people didn't struggle with it we wouldn't have so many problems that we have in the church amen uh people being able to submit themselves to the word amen the problem is they say you know the pastor brings the word of God it brings correction and it's the word amen and they say well it's the pastor he just doesn't like me or he's got it in for me or you know it's this they they point to the vessel instead of recognizing that it's the word they need to submit to amen amen amen am so this is a great source of rest however for those haveed the Holy Ghost amen because you know amen that the spirit of truth will lead you into all truth and you know that as long as you stay under the headship of the word you're protected amen amen you stay under the leadership of the Holy Ghost he will lead you exactly where you need to be amen amen so you know people that get pulled by every wind of Doctrine it's because they're afraid and they don't have that tie yeah if you know God like we spoke of this morning morning if you've met him in that personal revelation it it's the enemy can't come and pull you this way or that wayen amen because you've got a personal anchor you know him amen amen hallelujah amen you know we see it you know I live in Tucson Arizona and Tucson is one of the one of the most religious places you'll find you'll find every kind of thing out there you know I don't know how many message churches we have out there you know some of them are churches and some of them aren't churches some of them are lodges some of them are tape churches and you just find all kinds of things out there and you know many times we we see that someone who gets pulled off or or a a particular doctr Doctrine will arise up something that's not of the word of God and it will pull people because they don't have that Foundation because they don't know Christ personally amen they in the messag amen well my qu you know we shouldn't ask people how long have you been in the message we should ask them how long has the message been in you right and you know uh like you know brother Danny you asked me the other night how long have you been in this way you know and I should have just answered you well you know I've been in the message since I was 6 years old but the message has been in me since I was 20 when I received the Holy Ghost amen amen that that's when the life that was in the message came in me amen the problem is we've got too many message Baptists yeah amen that say oh you you you believe God sent a prophet that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost wrong answer am amen that's Baptist theology brought over to the message that's right there's got to be a birth amen amen amen amen so that having that Spirit of Truth it he leads us and he guides us amen and it's a great source of rest for us but the the the key is that we must allow him or give him permission to have the preeminence amen amen and and I don't care how long you've been in this or it's been in you amen how long you've uh been on this Christian walk there's going to be challenges and things that come up where you have to it's a challenge for you to surrender to God's will amen amen I know that I still I go through those amen and brother Brooks I know you do too amen God uh allows test to come our way and we must give the Holy Spirit the preeminence and allow him to have that leadership so this this doesn't happen all at once it doesn't happen automatically it's something that we grow into amen it's part of our walk a surrender a daily surrender because the trials you're going through now are not the trials you went through last year or the year before that you've grown amen you've come up you've you've the the trials that you went through 10 years ago are now Child's Play for you you look back well i' take some of those trials now you know but now look at what I've got to deal with here amen but God allows those things because you're in a walk of perfection amen so every hour we have to hand over control the Keys amen and we have to fight the flesh from taking control and allow the word to have headship in our lives amen now just for a few minutes here I want to kind of background this uh about the the Holy Spirit uh because every age has had access to this leadership of the Son of God right the son of God is the pillar of fire in the midst of the churches amen and in in Revelation chapter 1 you can see the the the the Son of God in the midst of all the churches so he was in the midst of the churches throughout all the ages even in the darkest of Ages God has always had a witness amen he's always had a witness of his power and Grace but uh at the beginning of this leodan age there was a great move of God known as the uh the Pentecostal Revival zusa Street you know there was uh there was the Welsh Revival and other revivals that have that came along as God ushered in uh the the this last Church age that we are a part of amen and God uh during this revival uh He restored the gifts of the Holy Spirit and the baptism by fire is that right amazing Miracles testimonies Sovereign move of God uh and then this would spark great healing campaigns right uh it you know amazing uh things where God you know uh i' I've read most of the books on the isua street revivals and the different revivals and it it was just a sovereign move of God God was burning Revival fires all across the nation amen and great outpourings and great moves of the holy spirit that that that flowed into great healing campaigns in the 40s and the 50s you know uh all all the the the men that came before and after brother bram's own Ministry his own Ministry sparking those healing campaigns and all the things that God was doing uh in in in worldwide and Nationwide uh revivals and and healing campaigns and eventually it spread all over the world and brother sister that was a mighty move of God yeah there's no there's no denying it mean it it was a mighty move of God Amen but even in all that Display of Power and the signs that God was doing uh there was a greater work that he was interested in a greater work amen remember when he came on Earth in humility it was small numbers and he came to do a mighty work amen amen he he came in a humble way but it was a small it you know brother Bram talks about he says I don't know if there was a hundred people that knew he was on the earth at the time right it was a humble work humility not known by many and so we see even all in this great work that God was doing there was something that he really wanted there was a greater work for him to perform amen because there was a church a bride that he wanted to come out of that amen that he wanted to manifest fully through amen amen so you see because what he's doing is he's restoring that communion back with man again amen he's restoring us back to where Adam fell from and even with all the Miracles and all the things that happened in the Pentecostal Revival we see where it ended up it ended up in organization organization organization organization amen and so what God was really interested in was restoring the word so that he could call a people out of that amen he could bring up people to know him as he really is amen now this is this is important because this fits into our subject of the headship of the word because it's only in this age that we have actually had the full restored word amen amen you see those is part of the Pentecostal Revival and I believe that they were they were God's people no doubt sealed in I mean that was where that was where God was moving during that time amen but then as part of that as an outflow of that God then began to restore the word yes amen amen and he is his word so his word describes who he is his word is his character yeah amen it's him and I'll just use an example you know of something simple like uh uh uh cutting hair you know so so that's part of God's word that that that the the women are supposed are not supposed to cut their hair right that's that's simple we all know that but you see those those that had were many that were part of that Pentecostal movement not all but many that were part of that they couldn't abide that word amen they couldn't take that word amen right so what were they in love with what was their focus on they they wanted the anointing they wanted the power but they weren't interested in the word amen amen now we're we want the word be because we realize that's him amen so in that in that simple example God is expressing his heart he's saying what he likes amen he's saying that he likes the sisters to not cut their hair he likes for them to act and be a certain way right that's his preference amen that's what he likes and and so he brings that precious word brother Isaiah Amen to those that are around the movement yes and they trample it yes they say no we don't want that they call it an unclean thing amen they say oh that's law that's bondage we don't want that and what are they doing they're rejecting him amen amen this is why this is why the restored word is so important yes and you know you can go down item by item things that were rece restored yes amen amen and you can see no we don't want that they'll call it legalism they'll call it whatever amen but what it comes down to is they're rejecting the headship yes amen that's why that's why the hair cutting one is such a great example amen because because a woman uh her hair is her glory amen and and and her glory is her headship amen amen that's right and now you've got a false Church enjoying the anointing of the Holy Spirit enjoying the anointing the outflowing the blessings but they don't want the headship that's right they don't want to submit to the leadership of the word amen amen amen yes Lord but you see his children they act very differently Hall they say oh I didn't know that right I'm sorry Lord amen they they are like those in uh in Revelation 3 where in leoda he says be zealous and repent amen when the word of Correction comes they say I'm sorry Lord amen I didn't know amen but but now Lord oh oh God I'm sorry and I I want to be right and I want to repent the truth is I I really you know uh my pastor says this all the time and I like this he says I don't care what I have to believe amen I just want to be I want to believe the truth amen I don't care what in other words I don't care what I have to do or give up yeah right I I don't care what I how I have to mold myself yeah but I want to be lined up to him amen I want what he wants amen and that's what his children want amen his children want to truly know him yes amen amen you see it's the Mighty God beginning to unveil himself amen that's what he is doing through his word restoring the word he's unveiling himself amen he's saying you know I've never I I I haven't expressed this in past ages this has been lost but I really like the sisters to wear not cut their hair amen he's unveiling himself he's making himself vulnerable amen he's actually giving us his thoughts his word amen amen he wants us brother sister to fully experience his character to use us his body on Earth to manifest that character in Satan's Eden amen amen and the beautiful thing is he's given us an eagle anointing amen amen amen an eagle of prophetic anointing to receive that that restored word amen 1 John 2:27 tells us the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you amen and you need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teaches you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it hath taught you you shall abide in him amen amen so this anointing that we're under the eagle anointing teaches us amen amen it teaches us and it lines up perfectly it has to with the word amen now that's not to say that we don't need teachers we don't that's not to say we don't need the five-fold ministry amen but God uses those vessels and he uses those offices and he uses other ways to teach us by his anointing amen but our teaching is not of man amen when your teach when your pastor stands up and teaches you out of the word of God you can receive it as information but you're truly not taught until the Holy Ghost comes down and you receive it through the anointing amen and then he teaches it to you amen amen you see that's the problem with Baptist me uh message believers they take it in the intellect yeah amen amen amen but this fully restored word is not a dead letter it's a living word amen it's a living God Amen with an anointing on it amen hallelujah the living person of Jesus Christ Amen brother sister if we don't have the shout of the king in the camp what have we got amen we've got a dead Moab religion am amen amen he said that Moab was so close they had all the same rituals and and and worship ship they had everything that Israel had they even look better amen you know they didn't have some of the rof raff that was hanging around Israel amen they were a better class a Believer amen but they were lacking something amen they were lacking the shout of the king in the camp amen hallelujah hallelujah amen we got to have the the life evident in our lives amen so this person of the word is who we're submitting to you're not submitting to your pastor amen you're submitting to the word amen amen yes so many people have trouble with headship in this hour they they have trouble submitting themselves they have trouble coming under the headship of the word they don't want to be subject to a a pastor or anybody they don't want to be subject to a body they don't want to be uh you know they don't want to have to give an account or an answer amen amen but they don't realize that they're what they're actually rejecting is the headship of the word amen not a brother or a sister amen amen they're not rejecting the if I in other words if I uh if I was am a child and I'm disrespecting my parents right I'm not just disrespecting them I'm disrespecting God's word amen because God's word tells me as a child respect your parents obey your parents am right that's God's word so if I'm going to be under the headship of the word I'm going to be subject to my parents amen amen same thing amen for a Believer we've got to be subject to the word amen amen amen so the mark of the holy spirit is is the token given to us amen God has come down accepted the sacrifice of Christ that we laid on the altar of our heart amen filled our temple with his presence amen this is why we can lay a hold of any Scripture and possess it amen because we're under the headship amen so so now when we have the two necessary pieces in place in in our life now we're and we're in a time where the seals on the book of redemption have been opened amen amen and and the book has been placed back in man's hands again amen so all those loose ends that were lost through the ages of of doctrines and things that were in the word all those loose ends have been tied up amen and now the full word is restored back to us again but brother and sister if you remember in the Old Testament this morning we were using the example of Joshua and there was a generation that rejected the word amen they wouldn't come under the subjection of the word or the headship of the word instead they said no they came up to the land and they said no we can't do it we can't do it and they God cut them off yes they said wow you know man when I I remember I used to look at that and think wow that was that was awful harsh I mean they were just afraid right I would be afraid too I don't know that I would want to go fight a bunch of Giants and you know go into a land like that and it's kind of kind of scary I I get you know they were afraid but brother sister they're Are Spiritual type yes the word said the word said that the land was there amen amen I love that amen yeah the word said they could overcome and take the land and they refused the headship of that word amen amen instead they looked so you see it doesn't matter what the reason is it doesn't matter if you're trying to be rebellious or not but when you come out under from under the headship of the word even if it's because you're afraid even you know whatever the reason is even if you think you're trying to do God a service by doing it yeah whatever the reason you don't come out from under the headship of the word you got to stay right with it amen so they they didn't stay with it and so God brought them and said well you know that's it I'll raise up a new generation now when that new generation came up they weren't circumcised amen amen remember Joshua had to go back and circumcised that second generation to roll away the reproach of Egypt amen and so all the unbelief brother sister the same thing is happening in our day yeah or has happened amen right because all the all these sins throughout the church ages where they slowly but surely got from out from under the headship of the word amen amen they were started out real good under Paul amen the the church age start the first church age they started out strong but they slowly organized and you can read about it in the church Church age book right all the things that slowly crept in and you know the doctrine of the nicians became the Deeds of the nicians and what happened sin was heaped up against the church leans against the title as it were right things that that were held against the body things that were held against the church and So what had to happen is God had to come we had to have a Joshua come amen amen and and cut away circumcise and remove those leans that were against the book amen he had to cut away the unbelief roll away the reproach of the previous ages amen he had to go back age by age and correct the error and show exactly where they got off amen amen so the Holy Spirit has roiled away the unbelief of seven anges that have been heaped up thank you Lord what an age we live in amen what an age my goodness you see that title deed was purchased by Calvary but now there have been 2,000 years of leans against it of unbelief amen that title had to be cleared before we could receive it before it could rightfully belong to us again amen so what that means though is that brother sister we have the full word back again you know I was reading the other day in in the I believe it was in the church age book brother brandham was saying he said you know I don't think uh and I'm going to paraphrase it because I don't have the quote with me but he says you know I I I think that we we don't respect or realize what we have with the full word in our midst again is the way he said it the word in our midst you see the full word we haven't had the full word since the very beginning amen amen we've got the full word because he said this he said you can't pray and receive uh of God without knowing the will of God is that right you pray for your healing because and you have faith for it because you know it's God's will to heal right you can pray for someone to be saved because you know it's God's will to save the lost right but brother sister you can't pray for something you know when he said uh uh say this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the sea and if you don't doubt in your heart it shall be done but you can't pray that prayer of faith unless you know it's God's will to move the mountain amen right well how do you know what God's will is by his word amen so now only now in this last age do we have the full counsel of God Amen think about it no other age even though Paul was saying we which are alive and remain shall not hinder those he was thinking that the Rapture was going to be in his age right but now through throughout every age you look back through every age only in this age is it is it unveiling and revealing to the church that they won't taste death why because the full word has been restored and they realize what they have they realize what has been purchased at Calvary amen amen so uh so but we're we're yielding to the leadership of this alive revealed open word amen you know I feel sorry for people that still got a closed book amen but God has opened the book he is amen he's opened it in this hour amen and we're receiving correction because none of us line up to it that's right amen none of us is is all right amen amen that's why we're in this walk so that we can line up with the word of God Amen and he's revealing his character to us in ways not previously seen by other ages my you see we didn't know all his preferences amen like we were talking the other night Esther Esther doesn't know what the king likes until the Chamberlain tells her amen we we know what God likes because it's been revealed to us amen through his word amen this is out of of the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed as the head was took from the grave so must the body follow him back to Eden did you catch that now he was the head as the head Christ was taken from the grave so must the body that's us amen amen we're his body the fullness of him that filth all and all amen so must the body follow him back to Eden yes amen where where the head of the family the man the bridegroom the bride being the body of the bridegroom must follow the bride because that's the head and the head is revealed amen the head's been revealed amen and come back with eternal life and the body must follow that because it's husband and wife again amen as long as you're pregnated with the same word which is his body you've took his body become in him when you took the word not the Creed the word oh my wouldn't that make for a text this afternoon wouldn't that be wonderful see just think of it therefore the body he says don't fail this the body therefore cannot recognize any other headship but the word amen amen amen she can't recognize has any other headship but the word the body is subject to the Head amen the problem is is that people uh have this idea of a a a multi-headed body right or or their the head right or they've got they've got they've got it all mixed up but the body everything is fitly joined together in this body Christ's body is perfect amen and his head he is the head he's going to lead the body amen you know today uh people have a misunderstood understanding of the the family unit amen Satan has come in and and totally Twisted things around and and he's made men the uh the the the the door M and he's lifted up women to be the head of the family and they're the ones that wear the pants so to speak right figuratively and literally right and and Satan has done that for a reason because it tears down and it tears apart the the picture that God has placed before us of the head and the body Christ as the head amen head of the church amen the woman is not in charge the man's in charge that's the Covenant amen that God set up he says don't fail this the body therefore cannot recognize any other headship but the word amen the head is connected with the body the head is the word and it's the same word one headship therefore denominations holy fathers everything else is dead D there's one headship that's Christ the body only recognizes one thing and that's the word now a moment ago I was talking about how you know we submit ourselves uh you know we we respect the headship that God has placed when you you know when our pastor brings something he brings correction we submit ourselves to that headship but notice I didn't say that we're submitting to the man right we're submitting to the word amen we're submitting to the office which is God working through the man amen amen may maybe I'm supposed to be be laboring this I don't know but I feel led to amen because so many people don't understand that yeah they think oh you know and they're looking at the man well the man makes mistakes the man is a man amen but there's an office there yes amen and God Honors that office amen and God will will equip that man to perform that office amen and he will use that office to speak to you amen now just because you know look God speaks to me amen he speaks to you I hope he speaks to you amen God speaks to me but there are times brother sister when God uses the office of the pastor to speak to me amen and it's not that he couldn't speak to me directly right it's not that God couldn't come down and say yep you know do this or whatever but that's the reason he put the office there am is everybody understand that and I have to accept that I have to submit myself and say you know what uh this is not the case but maybe I just don't even like my pastor you know maybe I maybe I I maybe I don't even like to be around him but I have to recognize that God uses that office to speak to me amen I'm glad I like my pastor amen but you understand it's not the man it's God it's the it's the word it's the office amen so many people can't deal with headship in this day amen it's a rebellious age but they're actually rebelling against the word of God all right 1 John 5:9 the Bible says if we receive the witness of men the witness of God is greater for this is the witness of God which he had testified of his son he that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself he that believeth not God hath made him a liar because he believeth not the record that God gave of his son and this is the record that God ha given us to eternal life and his life is in his son he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son hath not life and these things have I written unto you that you believe on the name of the son of God that you may know that you have eternal life and excuse me and that you may believe on the name of the son of God you see he says that he that believeth on the son of God he has a witness in himself that this is the truth he says this is the witness of God which he testified of his son Amen in John chapter 146 and 20 John Chapter 14 verse 16 he says I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever amen even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not need neither knoweth him but you know him amen as we said this morning you can't see it amen you can't touch it feel it but you know it by the spirit he says for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I come to you yet a little while the world seeth me no more but you shall see me because I live you shall live also amen and at that day shall know that I am in the father you and me and I am you and brother Bram said that day is this day amen this day amen amen so I would say this day you know that I'm in the father you in me and I in you why because the full word has been restored amen we can't know him if we if we had the wrong conception of him amen throughout the ages people thought he was three and they argued whether it was three or one or or or two or or who what he was how do we baptize is it this way or that way right but now we know him amen we know his truth amen I am in the father you in me and I in you and then 1 John Chapter 2 uh verse 4 he that saith I know him and keepeth not his Commandments is a liar you see so you say well I know him he's in me and yet you're not subject to the to the word you're a liar amen you've got to be subject to the word now again that's not to say you won't make mistakes we're not talking about that we're talking about being under headship amen he says he he that saith I know him and keep not his Commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him but who so keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected hereby we know that we are in in him you see that's how you know because through the Holy Spirit you come under subjection to the word amen amen so we uh you know we begin to experience the fruits of this in our own lives and we begin to recognize because we see the fruits in our own lives we begin to recognize other people who don't have it amen they say they've got something but it doesn't line up with what the word is saying yeah amen amen and and the more that we're under that anointing and the more that we're under that word anointing the more the gray areas become black and white that's why brother sister when you're away from church amen things that were once black and white suddenly become gray amen even even tonight you're going to walk out the door yes amen and you're going to go to your homes amen and things are going to be not quite as clear as they are in here tonight is that right you've experienced that right you're under the preaching and the anointing of the word and man everything just seems so Crystal Clear and and it's just oh it's so good and you can see you can see plainly amen amen and then you you know the next day you're at work and that trial comes and man I don't know well I think that's it's great yeah amen amen is that true amen so that's why we need that anointing amen that's why we need that word we need to feed on it amen because it makes the gray black and white again amen and you know as we go on in our walk uh things that were once maybe gray become black and white amen and we we put down tists as we go along and we put down stakes and we come up higher maybe once where we were inclined to be swayed one way or another now we're able to discern the spirit that's behind that amen because you see the fruit of it down the road and our walk becomes more based on faith and less on carnal thinking amen amen this is Brother bram's uh a quote here from a time of decision I hope this is okay tonight amen amen he says I wonder why that Rebecca came before any of the other girls did you know that Rebecca and Isaac were blood relations they were cousins and as the Bride of Jesus Christ is blood relation to him a blood brought bride a blood bought bride say that 10 times fast no wonder she was led by the spirit there was a connection coming together there was a union coming together that's the reason I think that today the born again again the Holy Ghost filled people that's us amen is connected with God and they are led by the spirit of God Amen you see it's a connection amen he says that's why they act so peculiar to the people they've made their decisions they're going on out regardless if the rest of them don't go out they're going anyhow amen that's why you can't be swayed because you got a connection amen amen that's why those old those old friends of yours don't tempt you anymore because you got a connection amen amen that's why those old things that have fallen away they can't pull on you anymore because there's a connection there now there are just new Temptations you have to face amen amen but you will still remain Victorious because you've got a connection amen and that's why we act so peculiar to the world amen amen Christ is a mystery of God revealed brother Brown says he is the principal theme of The Bible he was in the prophets he was in the Psalms he was in the history of the Bible and the Bible is a prophetic book it's a historical book it's a book of love it's a book of songs it's a book of life and in there you find Christ and he was in the prophets he was in the Psalms he was in the history and he also in the Bible is the things that is to come amen he's all all at all so he was before until after what does that make him then the same yesterday today and forever and listen he says if you in reject something in there that doesn't make him the same yesterday today and forever where do you go you got an awful picture for he was the history he is the prophet he is the Psalms he is everything and if you can't make him everything the same where's your picture look like do you see it he is the thing amen he was the prophets he was in them he was in the Psalms in the history in the things to come the same yesterday today and forever now listen to this he says then if he is that then he should be the Principal theme of our talking yes amen amen the principal theme of our talking you know uh I get Disturbed when people that claim to follow this message put more emphasis on following Brother brandom than they do on Jesus Christ because this message is Jesus Christ amen amen amen he now we we don't want to take anything away from brother brandham and what God did Mighty Prophet amen a mighty vessel but brother sister he came to introduce me to [Applause] someone amen he came to he came to bring a restored word so that I could know Jesus Christ as he is amen I honor the man I honor the prophet I thank God for him the sacrifice and the things that he went through but but brother sister it says in Malachi I send you yeah amen do you ever read that that way brother I send you Elijah the prophet amen he came because we needed to know God as he really is amen oh my thank you Lord I get stirred when I think about that brother amen so many people they put they they put the the if they put it all in brother brandham yeah amen and there's nothing for anybody else to do because it's all brother Bram well he's the only one that could pray for the sick he's the only one that could do this we can't do anything until he comes back but the Bible says I send you he he he was sent to us hallelujah the emphasis wasn't on eleazer Amen oh my amen elazar was sent now now it gets complicated cuz he's part of the Bride too amen he's a son amen amen so he's part of that am but in his office he's eler amen amen bringing us to Isaac we're introduced to someone restored word amen so this is what he says he says and he was faithful that's what I appreciate about him always pointed to Christ never pointed to himself amen he says this he says then if he is that then he should be the Principal theme of our talking our thinking our singing amen our walks hallelujah amen he should be the Principal theme of our life amen he's the principal theme of The Bible and the Bible is in us then he should be the Principal theme of everything that we do say or think should be Christ amen but the beautiful thing is it's the true Christ not a false Jesus amen not a god of of a man's imagination so many people that are claiming oh yeah we serve Jesus oh yeah we love Jesus but they're not coming under the headship of the word when they actually receive part of him which is his word they say no we don't want that you're rejecting God take another Jesus amen a god of your imagination amen amen 1 John chapter 4 uh 1 John chapter 4 verse what time did we start oh my I'm not very good with math 1 John 4:1 beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God Amen we try the spirits we don't we've got to separate the man from the spirit amen because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby you know the spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh amen is of God and every spirit that confesses not that Jesus is come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist where of you heard it would come and even now already is in the world you are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world oh my they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world Hearth them but we are of God he that knoweth God heareth [Music] us why those that hear God know or those that that knoweth God heareth us amen he's saying because we're giving you the true word and if you know God and you've got that connection you know the person of the word amen he that is not of God heareth not us hereby we know or hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of air amen now listen listen to this this is um this is out of uh the the revelation of Jesus Christ brother BR says now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless amen amen and I don't know what the B the Baptist message believers do with that amen you can't have a lukewarm formal religion amen amen even if you put a message label on it yes amen just saying its message doesn't make it not formal not lukewarm and not powerless amen amen amen I know some people don't like that but it's true anyway amen it exposes Satan revealing his works and his works are the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he is cast into the Lake of Fire he's persistent he probably preaching preaching unbelief as he goes down into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it see that's his nature he knows listen to this he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works amen she will be an invincible Army oh Hallelujah if she can get that true revelation of the true church what she is what she stands for and that she now can do the Greater Works you see that's what the opening of the seals did for us that's what the res restoration of the book of redemption did for us amen she is the true church amen he says she will be an invincible Army if she gets that Revelation listen to this now if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the church amen within the framework of the Christian church he says now those two Spirits that's he's not talking about within the framework of the true church but the Christian Church the two Spirits at work who is it it's Cain and Abel it's Esau and Jacob it's Judas and Jesus amen it's the two Spirits at work inside the framework of the church amen and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit hallelujah oh my by God's spirit so this is this is our calling amen we are called to discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit amen now the Antichrist it's an anointing that can get on anyone right it it's it can come from all different it can come from the sweetest person you'll know amen that's right God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her amen he will be as definitely thed today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them amen amen so how does this happen it comes by putting yourself under the headship of the word amen amen amen how do you how do you withstand it he he gave the example of Christ withstanding the effort of Satan in the desert he did it with the word amen right Satan came under he came to him with bi with a Bible under his arm right and he tried to quote him the word is that right amen you know that that Satan when he rebelled he rebelled in church he was the lead worshipper amen that's what brother brandom's talking about it's within the framework of the church amen amen you know Satan of course of course he's out there roaring as a you know out there as a roaring lion with the Hell's Angels but he's also sitting next to you on the Pew amen and so we have to put ourselves under the headship of the word that's the protection and we're instructed to try the spirits if the spirit is speaking through your friend or a family member it doesn't matter you must discern the spirit that's speaking example that we would use is Peter here's one of God Christ's closest men he's the one that's going to get the keys in fact he's the one that got the Revelation that and he got the Keys of the Kingdom right and he's the one that begins to speak to Jesus and says no no no Lord you can't go do that yeah Jesus discerns the spirit yeah right he turns to Peter and he says get thee behind me Satan amen amen amen man if your pastor told that you might I'm going to go find another P Pastor bless God I won't go in that church again right but he was Discerning the spirit is that right and man he wasn't he didn't treat it with kid gloves either no he Satan get thee behind me now Peter to his credit he accepted the correction he oh you know I didn't realize that was that was the spirit of antichrist anointing Peter amen and Peter had to come under the headship of the word but we deal not with flesh and blood but with principalities and Powers with Spirits amen so we're instructed to try the spirits and if the spirit is saying that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever in every way except for the physical body that's the spirit of God Amen but the spirit of antichrist says something different amen it makes a caveat it makes an exception well except amen amen amen Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and you and and and he's still a Healer he's still the Mighty God well except for your case because it's you know because of this and this and this what spirit is that amen what spirit is that try that spirit amen amen so you have to look at the spirit and see is it trying to give you a false gospel is it trying to point you to a historic Christ is it saying well you know we we used to have those types of things happen in the church but no longer because it was only for that past day or when uh the prophet was on the scene or that's the way it used to be we had Revival in our church that way one you know 50 years ago but no longer it's a different age now he's still the same yes amen amen he's still the same Amen brother and sister this is a uniting time this is not a historical reading time amen it's not enough to have a historic concept of a historical God you've got to unite with a present Jesus amen we're uniting with him because he is here now amen and he's here and he's the same as he's always been but now we know him because the word's been restored amen now we can Unite with him amen amen let me read you this uh little quote here from the voice of God in the last days brother Abraham says he says then did you notice after Adam listened to another Voice besides God's voice he his own wife he listened to his own wife who was giving him an antichrist gospel amen and the church is listening to the voice of her organization injecting into them Creeds instead of the word letting them live any way they want to as long as they go to church and be a member of a certain church that's all that matters the closest connection that that believer has has on Earth to them is the church but the real believer the closest connection is the Holy Spirit and is God's word amen this is from the message a prisoner God is looking for prisoners he's always done it you might search it through the Scripture A a man has to be a prisoner to Christ against anything therefore you cannot be connected with anything but Christ hallelujah amen even your father your mother your brother your sister your husband your wife anybody you're only connected with Christ and him only then God can use you until then he can't going out sometimes it speaks rough to people see I'm trying to get you to cut loose you've got to have a starting place like someone calls out the women bobbing their hair and wearing these clothes and hold and maintain their Christian profession and say that's a little thing you see they say oh that's a little thing that doesn't matter really then why did God write it in his word amen God will God is expressing a desire and you're saying n well no big deal what God wants amen that's what they're saying he says well you've got to start somewhere so begin there with your ABCs what is ABC always believe Christ amen in other words come under the headship of the word amen cut loose the worldy looks anyhow and become a prisoner to Christ and then just keep on Cut Loose of everything till the last final cut is cut loose and then you're a prisoner then you become in his grip and he's got you in his grip amen amen we're going to quickly wrap this up here this afternoon uh Revelation book of symbols but Abraham says like the great water lily that the little tiny seed borne way down in the bottom of a myy Mucky dirty frog scummy Pond and it winds its way up to the darkness through all the mud and scum and becomes the finest thing you could ever look at the face of with Radiance like sunshine so is the Church of the Living God that's been born down in the mud of fanaticism and chaos but she's wound up through the grime and she's on top of the thing just waiting for her wings of flight many will run to and fro and the people that know their God shall do exploits in that day God's Revelations to his church set still Little Flock positionally stay where you are Amen in other words he's telling the eve of this day stay under the word stay behind that word Shield as sister Gertie and sister Angie used to sing here keep holding on don't worry God is waiting and trying and pressing to get it the mystery of God revealed to his church that's what's holding back the coming of Christ now in the great Millennium is this Supernatural power that lays dormant in the church oh my praise the Lord okay trying to wrap this up but I don't want to miss this is this okay I know I've kept you I'm sorry but I want to I want to we want to read this all right this is what is the Holy Ghost now now the spirit of God has worked under justification under Luther sanctification under Wesley the baptism of the Holy Ghost under Pentecost and here it is in the last day performing and doing the very same thing that it did when it was in Christ what is it the church and Christ has become one you see we came up through those other ages those Restorations but now brother sister it's a uniting Time amen amen the church and Christ become one he says as soon as they connect together that Last Link they'll go through the sky shouting hallelujah amen you see that's what we're doing in this hour amen up will come Wesley up will come Luther all the rest of them back in those days they're waiting on us amen amen we which are alive and remain shall not hinder prevent those which have gone before in the grave they're waiting on us to come to our position amen they're waiting on this bride this body of Christ to be fully formed in this house amen and we will not prevent them every other age has hindered the resurrection every other age has prevented it because they haven't had full complete obedience to the word they haven't come under the headship of the full word because the word wasn't restored to them amen God allowed it and winked at their ignorance amen but now with the restored word they had to come under subjection to the world that was revealed in that day amen and we have the full word in our day amen he says up will come Wesley up will come Luther all the rest of them the first that will be last and the last will be first and there come the resurrection we're at the end time listen that's what the Holy Ghost does the Holy Ghost by justification just a light shadow of it the Holy Ghost by sanctification a little deeper of shadow of it the Holy Ghost by the baptism of it a deeper Shadow he's talking about the baptism at isua street right the outpouring but he says listen to this he says now the Holy Ghost by the restoration of its very person being in here forming signs and wonders like he did at the beginning woo Glory going to call me a Holy Roller anyhow you might as well get started now amen amen that's when we what happens when we fully submit to the headship amen amen amen it's the very person of God Amen the very word restored the holy spirit in the person of God now here uniting with us so what happens when we fully submit to that it's the opposite of what happened to Eve amen amen hallelujah she didn't have the victory because she stepped out from behind the word but we have the victory when we stay under the word amen amen uh a a a lady or a sister as long as she stays under the headship of her husband she's good right she's doing what God has called her to do and brother sister it's the same with the church staying under the headship of the word amen amen that goes back to our first quote that we read they were wholly veiled he said in Eden they were safe in God's Pavilion what is that Pavilion safe in the word shielded in the word of God under the headship of Christ amen full Satan couldn't get to them and he can't get to you in the Holy Ghost either amen but he says notice she pulled the veil off but there's a bride in this last day amen that won't pull that Veil off until it's time for her to be you know joined together with her bridegroom amen but she's got the she's got the protection of the word that she's staying under amen is that right amen amen would you stand with me tonight just as we close here tonight I'd like to uh I'd like to read a scripture and you can turn with me if you like and brother Isaiah we just been meditating on this back home this scripture Psalm 27 amen we just been meditating on it and just chewing on it and just going over it and over it and over it and preaching out of it my it's just been a blessing I'd just like to to to share a that that with you a little bit as we close here tonight Psalm chapter 27 brother brandham preached out of Psalm 27 as his text for the message the Rapture amen this is the rapture Psalm verse one a Psalm of David the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is my strength of My Life whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and they fell now this is bring this into our age amen this is not just this is not just David this is prophetic amen amen bring this into our age who are you going to who's who who should you fear in this age do you fear sickness do you fear cancer amen do you fear what do you fear what should you fear he says Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid if God be for us who can be against us amen he says when the wicked even mine enemies and my FES who are those they're demons Amen in these days it's not the armies of the Philistines it's demons that are coming against you amen demons that come to eat up your flesh Demons of sick sickness amen Demons of cancer Demons of heart disease Demons of diabetes amen demons that have come to eat up your flesh but he says when they came to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell amen though a host encamp against me I I don't care if they've surrounded me on every side and brother sister in this dark Satan's Eden we are surrounded by Darkness on every side amen he says though a host would encamp again against me me heart my heart shall not fear amen though War should rise up against me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord and I will seek that after that that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life amen beholding the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple that's fifth verse he says for in the time of trouble amen amen this is that time amen the time of trouble this past age of the darkness of Satan's Eden in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion Amen brother sister this morning we spoke about that secret uh uniting that secret thing that happens between you and God amen amen there's a secret place and we become the Tabernacle of the Living God he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me and he shall set me upon a rock a rock of Revelation a rock of the revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally amen and now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies roundabout therefore will I offer in this Tabernacle in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Praise I will sing yay I will sing praises unto the Lord amen heal oh Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me amen when thou sest seek my face my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I Seek You see when he when he brought the correction of the word you said yes Lord I Repent he said come don't be lukewarm he said repent zealously be zealous therefore and repent amen and and you said yes Lord thy face will I seek hide not thy face far from me and put not thy servant in Anger away in Anger thou Hast been my help lead me not neither forsake me oh god of my salvation when my father and my mother forsake me the Lord will take me up teach me thy way oh Lord and Lead Me in a plain path because of my enemies amen if there's one thing the enemy has tried in this day to do it's to obscure the path amen amen as I said earlier to make it gray amen amen so you're not sure which way you're supposed to go but he says oh Lord lead me in a plain path because of mine enemies Deliver Me Not Over unto the will of mine enemies for false Witnesses are risen against me and such as breathe out Cru cruelty they tell you you're not a child of God they tell you you're not bride they try and tell you that that you've
