[0:00] we had on this morning we're try not to
[0:02] be long God would help us we want to eat
[0:06] from Hebrews the fourth chapter Hebrews
[0:09] 4 we'll read the third and the fourth
[0:13] verse was for three through four
[0:36] for we which have believed do enter into
[0:40] rest I'll say that again
[0:43] don't you listen closely for we which
[0:46] have believed do enter into rest as he
[0:52] said as I have sworn in my wrath if they
[0:56] shall enter into my rest remember there
[1:00] were those who would not believe during
[1:03] the time of Moses and so therefore they
[1:06] did not enter into rest even though God
[1:08] had offered it unto them although the
[1:12] works were finished from the foundation
[1:14] of the world and everybody that was
[1:18] ordained to enter into rest did do so
[1:21] and those who were not did not and
[1:25] understand that God is not unjust God
[1:28] knows everything and he knows your
[1:31] choices and so therefore he predestinate
[1:34] you according to the choices that you've
[1:37] made before the foundation of the world
[1:39] for he spake in a certain place of the
[1:43] seventh day on this wise and God did
[1:47] rest the seventh day from all his words
[1:53] amen so everything that God was to do he
[1:57] did it and he rested hallelujah amen
[2:01] Ephesians 1:4
[2:29] according as he has chosen us in him
[2:32] before the foundation of the world that
[2:36] we should be holy and without blame
[2:39] before him in love right say it again
[2:45] according as he hath chosen us in him
[2:47] before the foundation of the world not
[2:50] in the 19th century before the
[2:53] foundation of the world that we should
[2:55] be holy and without blame hallelujah
[3:00] before him in love you love the Lord 2nd
[3:10] Timothy 2:19 and then we'll pray 2nd
[3:15] Timothy 2:19 nevertheless the foundation
[3:27] of God standeth sure having this seal
[3:31] the Lord knoweth them that are his and
[3:36] let everyone that name at the name of
[3:38] Christ depart from iniquity Heavenly
[3:44] Father we pray before you Lord we thank
[3:46] you for your amazing grace we thank you
[3:49] Lord for being so good to us and Lord
[3:52] without your Jesus we're nothing it is
[3:55] because of you and your master mind that
[3:58] we stand here today in honor to our
[4:03] creation and father we pray that you'll
[4:06] get glory in and throughout our lives to
[4:09] you be praised in the name of the Lord
[4:11] Jesus Christ have dine on way Oh God
[4:15] amen and amen you may be seated we spoke
[4:18] on the message this morning basically
[4:21] trying to show us that the book of the
[4:24] book was open and you know we think
[4:26] about the book of Redemption but we must
[4:28] all realize that this whole Bible is
[4:30] deemed as dealing with with Redemption
[4:35] though God tells us how he created all
[4:37] things he also tells us how mankind fell
[4:41] and
[4:42] that God amen was to redeem us remember
[4:46] when I had him fail God did not sing
[4:49] Gabriel he didn't sin wormwood or some
[4:52] other angel but we realized that God
[4:54] Himself came down to redeem mankind now
[4:59] the Bible tells us that the voice of God
[5:01] walked in the cool of the evening or the
[5:03] cool of the day and we realized that the
[5:06] voice of God is God even though we
[5:09] realize also who that voice was it was
[5:12] none other than what we call who we call
[5:14] the Lord Jesus Christ amen he he he he
[5:19] had and he walked amen in his theophany
[5:22] there to show us and to bring a
[5:26] revelation to Adam and Eve now you say
[5:29] what do you mean because it is the same
[5:31] holy spirit you can't change it God
[5:34] can't change it right if brother Branham
[5:37] said that that the The Tree of Life was
[5:41] Jesus Christ what he was the only one
[5:43] that could have given life amen to Adam
[5:46] and Eve and he is the voice of God
[5:49] because remember in the beginning when
[5:51] there was nothing amen it was that logos
[5:54] that came out of God that low cost was
[5:57] Jesus Christ in that form right amen he
[6:01] was the son brother branham tells us
[6:03] that how that when he spoke and when he
[6:05] began to create he was like a child he
[6:07] began to rejoice and shout and
[6:09] everything else amen when he began to
[6:11] see all those things coming into view
[6:14] now we realized by God's grace amen that
[6:17] here God is coming and he's telling us
[6:19] and he's showing us amen as I said on
[6:22] this morning that all God our owns it's
[6:26] ours you know is that right
[6:28] Paul said that we are joint heirs with
[6:31] Christ right amen as it was in the
[6:34] beginning he was joint heirs with Adam
[6:37] that's before Amen she had a name change
[6:40] but as long as her name was Adam as long
[6:43] as she stayed connected with Adam
[6:46] everything that Adam
[6:47] oh she owned a man if separation came
[6:51] after the fall it meant when she chose
[6:53] to obey
[6:56] another voice other than her husband's
[6:59] voice so we realized by God grace the
[7:03] work was finished right from the
[7:06] foundation of the world that means that
[7:08] God how could I said he wrote the novel
[7:12] he did everything every actor every part
[7:16] of this was finished amen
[7:19] but nobody knew what was in the book
[7:21] besides God Amen nobody understood the
[7:26] book but God understand when those
[7:29] priests in the book in in Leviticus
[7:32] priesthood and all of those things you
[7:34] know they didn't fully understand what
[7:35] God was saying if they had then we would
[7:39] not have meet God to talk to him but
[7:42] Jesus when he came down him and he began
[7:44] to explain the scripture because all
[7:47] they saw was law God said don't do this
[7:50] God said don't do that and Paul tells us
[7:53] that nobody was able to keep it so they
[7:56] were hypocrites and all who tried to
[7:59] live the law was hypocrites if the Jews
[8:01] could live in how you think Gentiles can
[8:04] live it
[8:04] it's always been my grace so we realized
[8:08] by God's grace we we the book has been
[8:11] opened and now God is unreeling the
[8:14] complete mystery of redemption even in
[8:20] Genesis 3:17 we find out a man that God
[8:24] spoke a word the serpent shall bruise
[8:27] his heel in you and you shall bruise his
[8:31] head and he talked about wind when did
[8:34] that happen it was locked in the
[8:36] scripture we didn't understand it we
[8:39] didn't even know who the serpent law but
[8:41] we found out that when Jesus was being
[8:43] crucified who crucified Him it was a
[8:47] serpent it was a serpent seed and here
[8:51] they were fulfilling Genesis 3 where did
[8:58] Moses get that from huh hey who was the
[9:03] Pharisees in the Sadducees jesus said
[9:06] unto them you generation of vipers
[9:09] you understand me we looked at these
[9:13] religious men as being pious and holy
[9:15] and acceptable to God and God comes
[9:18] along and says not so he said you hold
[9:21] the truth in unrighteousness in other
[9:24] words you know who I am
[9:26] but you you refuse to let the people
[9:29] know who I am
[9:32] you won't go in and you shutting and you
[9:35] blocking the door so others wouldn't go
[9:37] in is that what they did pride it's the
[9:41] truth remember the man who was blond
[9:43] born blind by birth they threatened you
[9:46] to to excommunicate his parents and
[9:49] instead of staying with the truth amen
[9:52] they avoided the question and they
[9:54] wanted to know who Christ was and they
[9:57] said don't ask us ask him he is of age
[10:00] how fearful these people were they were
[10:03] afraid of the ecclesiastical RAM in that
[10:06] day they were afraid of them and because
[10:09] they wanted their social status to
[10:11] remain and they had rather a men pushed
[10:13] their son to the side and be accepted by
[10:17] the Pharisees of the church world of
[10:18] that day with that young man a man who
[10:21] actually got his sight blind out from
[10:23] from being blind thirty years
[10:25] knew that only God could heal it
[10:28] hallelujah and he even went into a
[10:31] little debate a little argument he says
[10:33] hey to the Pharisee well don't you don't
[10:36] you know he's not written that only God
[10:38] could heal hallelujah and then they got
[10:42] upset with him and says well what are
[10:44] you and who are you you're nothing now
[10:46] what kind of attitude is that you're
[10:49] nothing and are you here to teach us
[10:51] like we've got our DD Blvd whatever
[10:54] degree they had they had it and then
[10:56] we're going to let know some nobody tell
[10:59] them what it is well the wise young man
[11:02] says well you can say whatever you want
[11:04] about Jesus but I am I am here as a
[11:08] testimony that I was blind but now I see
[11:15] you figure it out you don't want to say
[11:18] his God but let me tell you something I
[11:20] was blind you
[11:23] no I was blind I was here thirty years
[11:25] or more begging you never healed me
[11:30] right but here come a man that you call
[11:33] a devil and he comes and he touched me
[11:37] and healed me and you want me to believe
[11:39] that he's a devil when you couldn't do
[11:41] nothing for me
[11:42] oh come on somebody they got led with
[11:46] him they were angry with him and that's
[11:48] how it is
[11:49] Amen when a true son and daughter
[11:51] becomes enlightened to who Jesus is that
[11:57] enlightenment becomes a revelation to
[11:59] them so much so they understand who they
[12:02] are is that right remember when Jesus
[12:06] asked the question he said who do men
[12:08] say I the son of man am now at the
[12:10] Christ the Son of the Living God rested
[12:12] i doubt simon barjona for blessed flesh
[12:16] and blood did not reveal this thing to
[12:19] you but my father which is in heaven he
[12:21] has revealed this thing to you and now
[12:23] from this moment on you will no longer
[12:26] be called simon barjona I'm calling you
[12:29] Peter but you are little rock your piece
[12:33] of the rock hallelujah but I want you to
[12:36] understand that the revelation that you
[12:39] just received
[12:40] amen this is what I'm building my church
[12:42] upon hallelujah not you Peter but the
[12:46] revelation of who I am hallelujah why
[12:50] because Satan has spent thousands of
[12:53] years with trees and trees of people
[12:56] ain't men making them not know who I am
[12:58] because he has been a squatter he has
[13:04] been deceiving the people God don't care
[13:09] God is a myth but at the same time he
[13:14] wants you to worship Him but I've come I
[13:18] am the light of the world hallelujah
[13:22] is that right they said John and you
[13:26] that lady says no I'm not that light he
[13:29] said but there's one that's coming after
[13:30] me whose shoes I'm not even worthy to
[13:33] unlatch
[13:35] lujah but when he comes he shall baptize
[13:39] you with the Holy Ghost and fire oh my
[13:44] and then John picks it up in John the
[13:47] first chapter and he said this light was
[13:51] the light of men I see that in such a
[13:55] way in the beginning was the word the
[13:57] Word was with God the Word was God
[14:00] that word became flesh hallelujah and we
[14:04] beheld his glory as the only begotten of
[14:06] the Father full of grace and truth
[14:09] hallelujah it doesn't stop pays and he
[14:12] came to his own but he's all received
[14:14] and not but to them that received him he
[14:17] gave them power to become the sons of
[14:20] God hallelujah
[14:22] she is hidden the receiving of who he is
[14:25] it meant that makes you know who he is
[14:27] and he and who you are is that right
[14:30] when the prophet of God came in this day
[14:33] he told us about the ego story how the
[14:36] many of us were actually hatched under
[14:38] the chicken but we were not chickens we
[14:41] were Eagles the egg was a eagle a
[14:44] hallelujah and because the egg was the
[14:47] eagle a that egg could only bring forth
[14:49] egos hallelujah oh come on somebody you
[14:53] may have been given birth amen
[14:55] underneath the chicken but your identity
[14:58] Amen shows who you are because in those
[15:01] system there's a lot of things we
[15:02] couldn't eat and one of those things
[15:05] were the Trinity we couldn't eat it
[15:07] Oh y'all better understand me when I was
[15:09] a Baptist amen I knew as a boy that God
[15:12] was one I could not explain it but I
[15:15] knew he wasn't cut up in three pieces
[15:18] hallelujah and when I really found out
[15:21] that people really thought that he was
[15:23] three persons that really got me now
[15:26] hallelujah because I know when you got
[15:28] three personalities in one person you
[15:30] are schizophrenic hallelujah commotion
[15:36] about it know you got to understand all
[15:38] of these things were given to us we got
[15:41] power on the inside not just a word but
[15:44] a word power come on somebody
[15:48] world is active the Bible said is a
[15:52] sharp two-edged sword hey man it goes
[15:56] out and accomplished what he's supposed
[15:58] to accomplish the Bible said it is only
[16:01] the Word of God that is able to discern
[16:03] the very intent and thought of the heart
[16:06] hallelujah when no man ever can see
[16:08] what's on the inside God goes in with
[16:11] the scope of the word and he can see
[16:13] every motion every intent everything
[16:16] about you God sees it hallelujah
[16:20] that's why you can't hide from God God
[16:23] is who he is
[16:24] Paul had the explaining this is above
[16:26] all he's through all he's in you all
[16:30] hallelujah is that right David said if
[16:33] our sin in the midden into hell thou are
[16:36] there if I built and I had we should
[16:38] flying to the heavens though out there
[16:40] wherever I go thou art there there's no
[16:44] hiding place other than in the rock in
[16:48] the cleft of the rock hallelujah so you
[16:52] and I must understand in hallelujah if
[16:54] the foundation of God standeth sure why
[16:57] should I be afraid
[17:00] hallelujah having this seal the Lord
[17:04] knows them that are here and while we
[17:08] were insolent seeing the bombs that in
[17:10] that while we were yet sinners Christ
[17:12] died for us
[17:13] hallelujah so you and I must understand
[17:17] because we are sinners we were sinners
[17:20] Christ died for us God oh come on
[17:23] somebody we understand by God's grace
[17:26] what Hebrews 6 says Amen it talks about
[17:28] the rain coming on the Justin E and just
[17:30] we didn't know what that was we thought
[17:32] it was just a parable hallelujah but
[17:35] then the Bible according to the gospel
[17:37] shows us that in the beginning there
[17:39] were two seed song there was a good seed
[17:41] in a bad seed hallelujah I don't know
[17:44] about you but I'm to see the god song
[17:47] I'm the good seed hallelujah
[17:49] why because it is his word that has
[17:52] quickened me to life hallelujah one time
[17:54] I was dead and sin and I didn't know it
[17:56] but then God comes along and quicken
[17:59] what was only inside of me
[18:02] that's what there is a transformation
[18:04] going on the inside God is restoring the
[18:08] bride treat hallelujah my worship is
[18:12] being restored the word is being
[18:14] restored everything about the bride tree
[18:17] is being restored hallelujah and right
[18:19] now God is bringing us into the very
[18:21] image and likeness of his dear son and
[18:25] the devil can do me no harm
[18:28] hallelujah he can't stop me because the
[18:32] God that I serve and the God that you
[18:34] serve is Alpha and Omega he's the
[18:36] beginning and the end he's the first in
[18:39] the last hallelujah oh my he is
[18:42] beginning of a sentence in the pit the
[18:44] period of one hallelujah
[18:46] oh come on somebody we look at this tank
[18:49] and God had us colored that they were
[18:52] trying to figure out how God is gonna do
[18:53] it now look he saw him on Calvary before
[18:57] he went to Calvary the Bible says hey
[18:59] many of the princes of this world would
[19:00] have known who he was they would not
[19:03] have crucified him hallelujah
[19:05] they would have said don't mess with him
[19:06] let him live as long as he can Hollan Oh
[19:10] glory to God because one thing for sure
[19:12] even if they had no they went to crucify
[19:15] him if they had known what that vessel
[19:17] had on the inside hallelujah amen is not
[19:21] by power is not by might but by my
[19:23] spirit said the Lord and when the Holy
[19:26] Ghost came down into that body of Jesus
[19:28] hallelujah he became omnipotent y'all
[19:32] hear me somebody hallelujah he was a man
[19:34] for a fasting forty days and forty
[19:38] nights without food or water I guess
[19:40] that's just the way it was but
[19:41] nevertheless Amen we realized by God's
[19:44] grace he was doing what he was
[19:47] overcoming he was already overcome but
[19:51] think about it in his weakest as a man
[19:54] in his weakest condition he walked the
[19:59] death that's why we must realize that
[20:02] the prophet of God comes along and says
[20:04] oh the weakest Saint can make the devil
[20:09] shrivel
[20:10] you say I'm weak but the problem is take
[20:14] what you got and go to
[20:15] God in prayer hallelujah the Bible said
[20:18] cast all your cares upon him while he
[20:20] cares for you Oh glory to God and that's
[20:23] what we mean to do
[20:24] oh I'm weak but you still got power at
[20:27] least your tank is not empty hallelujah
[20:29] you still got something amen better
[20:32] shake the devil hallelujah Oh glory to
[20:35] God thank you Jesus why because my ego
[20:39] my momma eagle and my daddy golly want
[20:42] to say it when I scream they scream back
[20:44] oh yeah yeah all I gotta do is make a
[20:48] noise hallelujah and they'll come
[20:51] running hallelujah you know that's the
[20:54] truth hallelujah the Bible said they
[20:59] shall come from the east and from the
[21:01] west and from the north and from the
[21:03] south and they should sit down in the
[21:05] kingdom of God
[21:06] see that's what that's what Jesus was
[21:08] telling the Pharisees those Jews you
[21:10] gonna miss it you gotta miss it because
[21:12] I got a people they gonna come from the
[21:15] east and the west they're gonna come
[21:16] from everywhere and they're gonna sit
[21:18] down in the kingdom of God and he goes
[21:21] on saying behold they're our last which
[21:23] they're our last which shall be first
[21:26] then they're a first which shall be last
[21:28] hallelujah
[21:29] the Jews were first hallelujah come on
[21:33] somebody but look at these old nasty
[21:35] Gentiles hallelujah God called them dogs
[21:38] God called them swine's
[21:41] hallelujah they had the nature of
[21:43] uncleanness hallelujah they did whatever
[21:45] come to their minds but all in the book
[21:49] of Isaiah tells us that God was going to
[21:52] call the Gentile hallelujah oh my god
[21:55] was going to call her Beulah Oh God was
[22:02] gonna call a Beulah God was gonna marry
[22:05] her go in a god I said one time you had
[22:08] a forsaken people but now I'm calling
[22:11] you amen to be my bride hallelujah and
[22:15] you and I are witnesses and everything
[22:18] that that Isaiah prophesied in that day
[22:21] has now come the pan Beulah
[22:26] I'm Beulah land hallelujah look at it
[22:33] Jesus come along and he's telling the
[22:36] church you may not have known me you may
[22:38] not have understood me he said I will
[22:41] say to the seven church Oh
[22:42] behold I come quickly and my reward is
[22:45] with me to give every man according as
[22:48] his work shall be you said well what
[22:51] works brother Brooks
[22:52] amen they asked Jesus one occasion what
[22:55] works must I do and jesus said here is
[22:58] the works that you believe on Him whom
[23:01] God has sent hallelujah that's all you
[23:05] got to do truly believe what he's God
[23:07] sent us a prophet and you believe the
[23:10] words of that prophet and you began to
[23:12] drink it you forget to eat it you drink
[23:14] if you eat if you're drinking you leave
[23:16] it and it began to push his way out of
[23:18] you hallelujah is that right because
[23:20] that's what a mother do she just eaten
[23:23] that baby get to push it out oh my god
[23:26] is that right I am the Alpha and the
[23:29] Omega the beginning in the end the first
[23:32] and the last hallelujah
[23:35] none of us would understand what God is
[23:39] doing right now except the mercies and
[23:41] grace of God has given to us
[23:44] hallelujah do you know why God God had
[23:47] just had to come down and die for us so
[23:50] he can explain to us what did happen to
[23:53] us what happened to you
[23:56] he said you would trick like E you did
[24:00] not mean you didn't mean to sin in the
[24:02] first place hallelujah and because I
[24:05] know that I'm gonna justify you as
[24:08] though you've never said in the first
[24:10] place hallelujah but it took the
[24:13] property took the opening of the word

[53:36] whatever he's heir of you are - can I
[53:44] read a couple more we'll get on to
[53:47] everything else notice what did we lose
[53:50] what did we lose well it was given the
[53:53] Adam to have eternal life as long as he
[53:55] eat from the tree he had eternal life
[53:58] and we notice again that Adam Rossi he
[54:01] inherit the earth he was like an amateur
[54:03] God over the earth the earth was his
[54:06] everything was given unto his hand he
[54:08] couldn't do with it whatever he could do
[54:11] with it whatever he wanted to he named
[54:14] it and he called it and done whatever he
[54:16] wanted to he was truly a son of God now
[54:19] in the fall Adam forfeited the title
[54:22] deed to that he fought affinity to Satan
[54:24] Satan took the title deed Abraham was
[54:27] Adam was very slothful and he did not
[54:30] redeem his right rights for he could not
[54:33] redeem his right but Satan which does
[54:36] not rightfully own it but possesses that
[54:39] he is the god of this earth the Bible
[54:42] says so he possessed that not because
[54:44] that he really rightfully gets it but he
[54:48] possess it now do you get it
[54:50] Satan possesses it that he holds it into
[54:53] his hand death is in there his hand
[54:56] the earth is in his hand that world
[54:59] belongs to him every nation
[55:01] to him the governs in the controls the
[55:03] world and everything in the world Satan
[55:06] does you see Jesus knew who he was he
[55:09] told Pilate he said you ain't got no
[55:11] power and the only power that you have
[55:14] is what my father gave you shut him up
[55:17] shut him up right Amen but thanks God
[55:21] we're not the world there's there you
[55:23] are see I don't mean the church he don't
[55:26] he don't control the church he just
[55:28] controls the world he said they were
[55:29] kids and he's the god of the world Jesus
[55:33] said he was he is he's the god of this
[55:35] earth has blinded the eyes of the people
[55:37] the god of this earth he's the God of
[55:40] heaven and now he's rightfully don own
[55:43] don't rightfully don't get his own this
[55:47] he don't own it he does not own it right
[55:51] but he forfeited and Abraham forfeited
[55:54] the title deed to it to this all this
[55:57] stuff that we own eternal life and
[55:59] inheritors of the earth jesus said in
[56:01] Matthew blessed are the meek for they
[56:03] shall inherit the earth see and look it
[56:05] wasn't it wasn't to Adam or any of his
[56:09] see Adam seed absolutely lost everything
[56:11] - it's not see seed of Adam no matter
[56:16] how much we try to beautify this world
[56:19] and how much we try to make big thick
[56:22] fine homes and things
[56:24] it still doesn't belong to Adam see no
[56:27] sir it did not go to Adam see no sir
[56:30] because Satan took it lock stock and
[56:33] barrel now am i yes so many things could
[56:36] be said I just want I just don't want to
[56:39] take too much of your time he possessed
[56:43] it but he doesn't not he does not
[56:45] rightfully only a Satan doesn't I see
[56:48] and when the rightful owner right for
[56:50] owner owner lost it there only one way
[56:53] that he it can be redeemed
[56:55] that's that by a near kinsman it's the
[56:58] only one who can rightfully redeem it
[57:01] now of course this we have in the virgin
[57:04] birth of Jesus Christ right a kinsman
[57:07] redeemer I'm closing on on Ephesians
[57:09] three now we understand that all that
[57:12] God has given us when that book was open
[57:15] the inheritance was given is up to you
[57:18] and how to release it it's already
[57:21] released but you've got to take it you
[57:24] got a you got to have it out like this
[57:26] and and receive it unto yourself right
[57:29] because he's done it all all of your
[57:32] healing all of your deliverance is
[57:33] everything that God has done is given to
[57:35] you
[57:35] and guess what because it's yours you
[57:38] don't have to beg for it
[57:39] but you got to ask and faith that's what
[57:42] he said when you ask in faith it shall
[57:46] be done
[57:47] that's not wavering oh I feel like it or
[57:50] I feel goosebumps running up and down my
[57:52] spine my hairs are standing up on me and
[57:55] he'll surely he's here hallelujah I
[57:57] don't need all of that I thank God for
[58:00] but I know he's in me because he said
[58:05] I'll never leave it nor forsake you
[58:06] I always be with you remember I told you
[58:09] that even when I die his spirit is gonna
[58:11] rest on my bones your bones it wasn't
[58:16] just Elijah bones at the spirit
[58:18] restaurant Amen that means God possessed
[58:20] it and not even Satan can do nothing
[58:22] about it
[58:24] hallelujah this plot of land is holy
[58:30] hallelujah I'm just gonna read Ephesians

[58:50] him before the foundation of the world
[58:52] that we should be holy and without blame
[58:54] before him in love having predestinated

[59:02] good pleasure of his will his will not

[1:04:53] Corinthians the 11th chapter we'll read
[1:04:57] the twenty-third verse come down to the
[1:05:03] 31st well I have received the Lord that
[1:05:07] which also I delivered unto you that the
[1:05:13] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[1:05:15] was betrayed took bread and when he had
[1:05:19] given thanks he brake it and said take
[1:05:21] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:05:24] you this do in remembrance of me after
[1:05:28] the same manner also he took the cup
[1:05:29] when he had supped saying this cup is
[1:05:32] the New Testament in my blood this do ye
[1:05:35] as oft as you drink it in remembrance of
[1:05:38] me for as often as you eat this bread
[1:05:41] and drink this cup you do show the
[1:05:43] Lord's death till he come wherefore
[1:05:46] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:05:48] this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[1:05:51] guilty of the body and blood of the Lord
[1:05:53] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:05:57] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:06:00] Cup but he that eateth and drinketh
[1:06:03] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:06:05] to himself not discerning the Lord's
[1:06:08] body for this cause are many weak and
[1:06:12] sick
[1:06:12] be among you and many sleep for if we
[1:06:16] would judge ourselves we should not be
[1:06:18] judged but when we are judged we are
[1:06:21] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[1:06:23] be condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:06:28] brethren when you come together to eat
[1:06:29] tarry one for another and if any man
[1:06:33] hunger let him eat at home that you come
[1:06:36] not together went to condemnation and
[1:06:39] the rest will I set in order when I come
