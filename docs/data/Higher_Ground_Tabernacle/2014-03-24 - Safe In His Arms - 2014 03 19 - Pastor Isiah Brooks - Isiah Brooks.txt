TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen of you how many of you have all had battles today I was getting ready to say if you didn't something's wrong the devil is not he's not an adversary of Peace he likes to try to discourage and torment the children of God but I I really like whooping on him I from being a preacher but now I'm glad he made me one ain't God good to us amen we're going to be coming from the word of God now remember we just ministered on the illusion uh of of the powerful illusion of Satan and and we we talked about Jesus Christ or believe on the last service knowing him you see because a lot of people say they know him but this know that God and what I've been speaking on is a intimacy it is a relationship that you have with him like for instance Obama is the president I know that but I don't know him right so the kind of knowing I'm talking about is to say well you know I know that person and he wouldn't do that you know a confidence that kind of knowing that you could have an a confidence and an assurance in God you know him so well and he knows you you right it's not some uh uh uh something that you imagine nothing no figment of your imagination it must be real and like I said on last week uh the Old Testament Saints we could get jealous of them but one thing for certain they knew God they weren't serving idols and and all other things because they knew God it was a personal relationship whether they could see him or not they knew he was there and and that's the thing is so many people are not aware amen that God is with us above us in us through us he's everywhere and there is no hiding place outside of Jesus Christ you love the Lord amen so let us turn Amen to the scripture according to uh Ephesians 3 we'll go there Ephesians 3 we're still talking about the Lord Jesus there is no other God outside of him is that all right I bow my knees that's what Paul said I bow my knees to the Lord Jesus Christ and so we're living in a day you better understand what I'm talking about because a lot of people think their organizations and denominations saves them the Bible said we're saved by grace through faith Hallelujah in whom Jesus Christ alone it'll never be the blood plus y'all hear what I'm saying amen so yeah I don't know whether y am I deaf tonight or we're not getting amens I can't hear your mind I can't hear your mind the Bible said bring forth fruits you know lips that's why you got those lips it's supposed to Make Some Noise amen you of the Lord Ephesians 3 beginning at the 8th verse let's read the seventh pleas wherefore I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power now this is talking about Paul unto me whom am less than the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should pre reach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ it doesn't mean you can't search but the the thing is you don't come to an end of your search is it constantly move on and on and on because you must realize that Jesus Christ gospel is Progressive that's why so many churches and you know have become larges because they put a period behind what they believe God's word is eternal in order to stay with God you must put a Karma instead of period because God make changes you must make changes with God right amen so we realize by the grace of God uh here we're reading and and he says listen and to make all men see now he Paul is working with this because here his ministry is to make all men see even though we know that all men won't see but that's his ministry even as Christ so loved the world I asked you a question what world did he love right he say well well how can Christ love the world and tell you to love not the world we'll get into that in a minute and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world had been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent see he had an intention to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in The Heavenly places might be known might be known there's a knowledge there's something God wants us to know right by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the Eternal purpose of purpose amen which he purpose in Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and accessed with confidence by the faith of him is that all right let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your love God you've been so good to us God you've been wonderful throughout out today Lord you kept us from all hurt harm and danger Lord you kept us Lord amen in under the blood and your promise Lord we thank you Father God if it wasn't for your blood Lord Jesus we all would be worthy of death and Hell thank you Father for your sacrifice Lord God make us vessels of Honor we ask these things in Jesus Christ name we pray amen you may be seated if I was to uh entitled this message by the grace of God I would like to entitle it safe in his arms you like that I can't like it amen if you would turn with me to Deuteronomy please please Deuteronomy 33 just going to read a scripture here now we understand by the grace of God how uh the Saints of old we talk about Israel uh we know that by the grace of God they they they you know at times got out of place and whether you want to believe it or not we who call ourselves Christians have done likewise as a nation America started out on Christian principles and and now we have become a heathenistic nation whether you like it or not it's true anyhow when you put God out don't trouble yourself with the consequences because you can look at Israel and you can look make it all the way back to Genesis when you kick God out there are consequences that you're going to face now you don't have to go to this particular scripture uh I'm I'm I'm going to read a little bit out of Deuteronomy 32 and then I'm going have you turn with me to 33 but the Bible tells us that in 32 and 15 but jesua un wax fat and kick thou are waxing fat and thou art grown thick sick thou are covered with fatness then he forsook God which made him and lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation now tell me if that's not America you see what I'm saying because Spirits do not die people do but Spirits carry on you could be this way God has blessed you so well but we forgotten where the blessings come come from see it's just like a hog he never looks up to see where the apples are falling from right those apples might beat him all over the head but he'll never look up and that's how it is with a lot of people God has blessed them from birth to now and and they've never looked up to say Thank You Lord right y'all hear what I'm saying right so we find out even if you want to follow scripture all the way through amen down to the 20th verse the Bible said they provoked him to jealousy with strange Gods which Abominations provoke they him to anger see we can say well how in the world Israel did this how could they do what they did to God listen America has done that and worse they sacrifice un devil y'all know that I mean we've got people in America right now who literally worship devils and will let you know it they don't care because they think God is dead but God is not dead Safe in His Arms I'm coming to something in just a minute so we want to look by the grace of God Amen to Deuteronomy 33:27 is that all right if I got it right I might be messing up here yes the Eternal God Is Thy refuge and underneath are the Everlasting Arms and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee and shall say destroy him or them is that all right if Israel then shall dwell in safety alone the Fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine also the heavens shall drop down de happy are thou oh Israel who is like unto thee you might say well that's the Old Testament but we're spiritual Israel come on somebody oh people Sav by the Lord The Shield of thy help and who is the the sword of thy Excellency and thy enemies shall be found Liars unto thee and thou shall tread upon their high places now I want you to understand this is prophecy but the word of God tells us by the grace of God that the righteous shall walk upon the ash of the wicked it is something that we now looking at him we can see this thing moving at such a rapid pace we understand the prophecy by the grace of God Amen about Russia look what's happening people we've got a president in the office a Joseph excuse me a pharaoh that who didn't know Joseph come on and I was telling somebody the other day uh even though it was the truth I said you know when he said that America was no longer a Christian Nation and he began to call those y'all remember that when he first got in office and then he and then he comes down and and call uh the Muslim faith first oh come on somebody they should have impeached him then but you see God is in the working God has to do we you see because this nation and churches don't give I'm coming to it have literally turned their backs on God now is that my word no sir that is the word of Revelations 3 they had Jesus knocking on on on the outside of the door of the church trying to get in but they don't want him in and if he's not there who's there then an impostor come on somebody and mean the Bible said that Satan himself will come down as an angel of Light has he done it light means Enlightenment amen they think they're coming growing in the knowledge of the truth but the Bible said they will have in is ever learning and never coming into the knowledge of the truth that's the day we're living in kind of spooky isn't it kind of scary amen but thank God that you can see Hallelujah now I I want to say this I'm I'm working with my theme is Heavenly places but I'm working with Safe in His Arms amen because amen we realize by the grace of God we're living in such a day where you've got to be sure of your salvation the Bible said make your calling and election sure oh I feel saved feel feeling has nothing to do with it Hallelujah come on somebody your way of feeling is deceiving sometimes anybody know what I'm talking about there's sometimes I don't feel saved but will I ever say I'm not no sir Jesus said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you I will always be with you where even in you see so I know he's in there come on somebody like you've heard me say sometimes I might have to stir up the Kool-Aid to make it sweet amen but the sil still in there glory to God Amen I like that you know so we look at this thing you say now brother Brooks listen we we here the Bible tells us there's two types of seed there is the seat of the devil and the seat of God now that's not my theology that's true amen Jesus said told those Pharisees and Sadducees you are of your father the devil Luke 17:27 so if Jesus said they were they were that their fathers was the devil that's what it was cuz Jesus never declared a lie hello and if there were devils there there's Devils now Hallelujah come on somebody and there are children of light Children of the day the Bible say the children of light and the children of the day will not be deceived I love this thing I love this because I want you to understand what God has done for me and you is basically to open up the word so that you and I would not be deceived you said well brother BCE can you be a church member and be deceived yes here was Jesus Christ on the earth you had Pharisees and Sadducees understand this people the Pharisees were very apt in the scriptures or the Scrolls it is told by gamea that they could literally uh have the scroll rolled up and a good Pharisee could actually point to what the scripture is where it is what it says and they couldn't miss a jot or tit with the scroll rolled up and they had to learn it verbatim y'all hear what I'm saying amen so listen but it was the Pharisees who literally who actually missed Jesus come on somebody but it but there were people like you and I y'all know what I'm saying the scum y' like y'all don't want me to preach tonight I don't know what's wrong y'all y'all better stop asking I don't know what's going on but I'm going to show out in a bit you know because I'm happy you know what I'm saying when God is done something for come on some that was just the other day y'all was carrying on what's happened between now and then fire still falling amen so let's so we find out by the grace of God we realize amen that here you are like like brother B said smitten out of the church ages into the Bride of Jesus and literally you you you you're actually the only sane people in the world everybody else is insane and don't even know it and the devil will sometime call you crazy but you tell them yes you're right I worship in the way called crazy I worship in the way they call her say I am crazy but not in the way you call crazy anybody that follow the devil is crazy there's no better way of putting it but the thing that I love and you've heard us say this I've got these in not in order to get where where I want to go because we find out that we're living in an age of eating drinking and being married we are there was a time you you could go to Los Angeles or you can go to New York or Las Vegas the party now the whole world is a big Babylonian party that's all they care about that's all they do 24/7 that's all they do and while they're partying their nation is being taken away from them just like it was in the day of Babylon y'all hear what I'm saying our nation is being taken away and remember I said this the other uh a few weeks ago as long as the church continue to keep its savor it is the church that keeps the Judgment off of whatever City or whatever world when the church go bad God judges the church Church therefore judges the world is that right that's your scripture the Bible said judgment was first began at the house of God is that right and the Bible tells us according to Ezekiel when God was getting ready to judge Israel God said start with the ancient go by the church amen amen and he says slay everyone Boy Child young old oh it doesn't matter slay everything that doesn't have the seal or the mark of God in their forehead is that all right now reason why I said that because America every time I read that scripture about jesuan and wex fat amen that's what God did there's a time we used to be so poor Amen in America you know we couldn't do and y'all remember the depression and everything else or you've read about it amen it was was a hard time but after that amen we began to prosper and and we became the greatest nation and would have contined had we recognized our day of visitation well it's like in the days of of Israel amen when Jesus came on the scene Jesus said to those Pharisees in other words let's put in our term he said it doesn't matter if your daddy daddy daddy our daddy daddy was a Phar and you grew up in this thing he basically said except you believe that I am he you should likewise die in your sin what was it it was a new day it was a new dispensation and God had turned the corner but the world didn't want to turn the corner with him he wasn't just Jehovah amen Spirit but it was Jehovah inside the flesh the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness of the god bodily it was God Amen clothed in human flesh Hallelujah and they did not want to see it h anden he came as humble as he possibly could born in a manger amen over a manure power and then when God sent him and raised him up in Nazareth and he told them where they came from amen they said can any good thing come out of Nazareth Hallelujah I say it like this can any good thing come out of Isaiah Hallelujah no good thing can come out of me until the good thing gets in me Hallelujah glory to his name listen Heavenly places and you know a lot of people you know they everybody say well you know I've been you got these denominations and it's true folk they they argue over the word Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost did y'all know that I was talking to a lady witnessing to her she went to uh uh one this church Apostolic whatever it was and I said uh I I sure I got the Holy Spirit she said holy spirit nuh Holy Ghost oh my Hallelujah come on somebody amen you could call it holy spirit Holy Ghost whatever you want to call it it's still holy there's only one Holy Spirit it right call it holy ghost call it holy spirit I like holy ghost because it when I think of Holy Ghost it means somebody died and the Ghost came back is that right amen Jesus said I'll send you to comforter it's good that I go away said when I go away the father was in the comforter who in my name and the comforter came in the Holy Ghost yeah it doesn't matter you know but people are fight over that but anyway let's move on by the grace of God so we see by the grace of God we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world you know that scripture was laying there all the time huh laying there all the time without understanding and when God sent Elijah and unfolded that scripture he took us to MDC and said Levi was in there right is that all right we have read Jeremiah God said I knew you before you were in your mother's womb now if Jeremiah was in in God knew him before he was even in his mother's womb where was he see I got in my notes you came from somewhere and you going to go somewhere Hallelujah well wherever you come from that's what you're going back to if you came from God you go back to God if you come from hell you go back to hell oh come on somebody it's the TRU but Paul began to re write by the grace of God because he wants us our eyes of understanding to be in light God want us to understand not without our natur natural eyes our spiritual eyes y'all hear what I'm saying you can say oh do you see that I can see it with my natural eye but I don't understand it see and God want us not only to see it with our natural eye but understand it that's why it's so important to get the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost wrote the word and if the Holy Ghost wrote the word don't you know he understands it that's why the Bible said no man can understand those things that are of God until he's born again intellectually is one thing but when it's from the heart you'll die for it is that okay we're living in the last days as I said amen we're living in the days where you know it make you want to just get on the streets and scream like I told you don't get afraid and be scared to tell people that's my pastor I'm telling you now I don't forew warn you but I'm telling you that's where I started that's where I end up amen I knew nothing about a pull pit I was out there with a tamarine amen and a few people who could hardly sing but we were raking and bringing in the fish bringing in the fish amen and I said Lord restore that amen I love that I love that I love that that's my joy when I see Souls rep repenting coming to the Lord Jesus amen turn with me back again turn back with me please Ephesians you love God Ephesians 1 please I'm going try not to be long every time I say that I see for a little longer I'm going try not to be God help me amen Ephesians 1:3 it says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all yall know what that word all that means nothing's left with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ and how do you get in Heavenly places you must be born again you and I know by the grace of God Amen that there's a there's we call it a theophany body we call it a word body that's the only only way you'll be able to hear the end Time Gospel is that there is a representation of you somewhere you say it can't be it is true the Bible tells us that God asked job where were you when the sons of God began to shout when they began to dance when they began to praise me where were you Jo if Jo was living in this day job could say I was there I was among that group amen you got to recognize this thing amen the Bible said that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world if the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world there was some worshiping and some praising going on when before the foundation of the world Hallelujah is that all right why are you saying this because there's no such thing is giving eternal life to something that didn't have eternal life in the beginning because eternal life have no beginning how can a creature of time receive eternal life come on somebody because if you receive eternal life that means that eternal life had a beginning come on somebody but you see you got to be in the Eternal Hallelujah in order to receive the Eternal oh come on somebody it in other words let's put it in simple terms amen my children were in me even when I was a baby they were in me and time maturity brought it to a place where it was possible for those children to be made manifest but I had to find a lovely bedding ground my wife come on somebody I had to find a beding ground in order for those children to be made manifest come on somebody amen but they were with me all along Hallelujah so was it with God God had to find a beding ground which was the womb of this Earth and then and God put his seed in you before the foundation of the world and what the gospel does Amen is strike that seed with the DNA food which is the blood of Jesus oh come on somebody it's the seed in you or we thought we thought in order to be a son and daughter of God all we had to do was receive the Holy Spirit but you see there's a lot of people who are not Sons and Daughters of God because they don't have the seed right come on somebody they can get the Holy Ghost on the flesh they can get the Holy Ghost on the spirit they can shout they can dance they can speak in tongues and then tomorrow you'll find them in the bar cursing like a sailor hello H they can't be nothing that they ain't see they can't if the seed is living that life lives its way in you come on somebody I was born a Manchild I've never had to practice being a man it's part of the nature y'all hear what I'm saying so when you're born of God you don't have to practice it you let go and let God hallelujah oh am I making sense I'm talking about sitting in Heavenly places the TR the thing is I was there in the beginning you see let's put it this way when it comes to us we're only Sons because this part of us was created hello but when we talk about being Eternal that part of us is God hello sons and daughters of who God apples begets apples orang just be get oranges amen y'all hear what I'm saying if God going to have a son a daughter he gonna bring forth a horse no sir he going to bring forth a god somebody in His image and likeness oh come on now I'm going to tell you something I'mma y'all y'all let let me say it like this Hollywood believe it better than some of us Hollywood tells us that we're not supposed to be just human hello Hollywood tells us that there are supernatural abilities that's supposed to be with us why because we had it before the fall Hallelujah Adam had the ability that's true you said oh brother Bo let me tell you Adam never never dotted one foot of in in any kind of Elementary uh Grade School uh High School junior high and God said name the animals Hallelujah why because amen God was in Adam that pig is still a pig you can call him swine and Germany still the same y I'm saying

Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah sin brought us to a place where we were stricken by Amnesia we forgot who we were we forgot our identity Hallelujah but y'all understand that Jesus wasn't he was the only begotten son that right but there were other Sons came coming from the same father oh come on somebody why did he teach his disciples Our Father why did he say my father he said our father our and a father means that you've been beg gotten by some man Our Father come onight the Bible said amen that there were other Brethren he's the Joseph y'all hear what I'm saying he's the Joseph and we're the other Brethren but we got the same seed oh help us Lord help us Lord that's what it's all about he said brother you are so insane let me ask you a question what is it about heaven that the scientists cannot get over why does it Mesmerize them why are they so looking into it why what is it that they want to know the beginning come on you know why they don't see it and understand Einstein had a better understanding but even so his understanding was from the Dark Side hello but you see Jesus Christ understood it all now let me say it like this he said my sheep Hearth my voice and a stranger they will not follow how can he say such a thing absolutely who said that amen that's exactly right brother it's because of where we come from glory to his name ain't God good amen he it was Christ you know he conquered all things is that all right turn with me to Ephesians 2 are we there already let's go there to two he conquered all all things let let's read from the first verse now that word Quicken means to bring a life how many of y'all been brought to life hallelujah how many of y'all can say I used to be dead I know this sound Elementary tonight but it it just feeding my soul why because in teaching this or preaching this you and I are coming to a place where we really know Jesus see because if you don't know Jesus you'll never know yourself you have he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein the time pass you walked according to the course of this world he's telling you something even though you were in sin you walked according to the course of this world why you were born in sin shapen in iniquity the nature of this world was in you even though the seed of God was there the seed of God was laying there dorant is that right it took a powerful preaching something amen that quickened you amen the power of God came down and change your attitude about Jesus Christ right amen you know what people say why God let all this stuff happen God didn't he didn't let it we did Adam and Eve let it happen they were the ones in control they fell so we fell it was a domino effect Hallelujah but the Bible said the second Adam that laugh atam he's not Earthly he's not fleshly he's not just flesh and blood but the Bible said he's a quickening spirit y'all hear what I'm saying so if the second Adam is a quickening spirit then what you should be Hallelujah you know what quickening Spirit do sometime when you sitting still that that's it brother amen you up out of your seat before you even know it amen there were many times I was coming down before I realized I had gone up it Quicken you something said Hallelujah in you before you can think about it did y'all know that I've had that experience so many times it come out of my mouth so fast I said that yeah it was the holy spirit amen in his word amen where in time pass ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now work worketh in the children of disobedience who that's the devil's children the devil on this world he's the squatter come on somebody if he didn't own it he couldn't have offered it to Jesus Hallelujah but because uh Adam forfeited it by sining the Bible said that that it was the man who was in the transgression the woman amen she was deceived but Adam Sinn he walked out willfully Hallelujah but thank God he did he was a of our Lord Jesus Christ come on somebody Hallelujah when God found us we were just like Eve we an adulterous we were fornicators we were Liars we were thieves we were all perverted but he said I love you too much to let you go Hallelujah I love you too much my world won't be the same without you oh hallelujah thank God I can see him take take Eve in his arms devil you had her but he She's Mine she was mine in the beginning and she's mine in the end Hallelujah glory to God Enlighten he wants us to understand what we mean to him Hallelujah understand you're Priceless you and I are Priceless when the devil say you are you no good H you ain't worth nothing you said well if that be so then why did Jesus pay the price for me Hallelujah why did he get me up out of the pawn shop Hallelujah when everybody else passed me by he looked through the window of the shop and he saw me Hallelujah he saw you and said I buy him that's mine oh my my my Hallelujah I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God I don't know what to do people of God I don't know what to do I'm so glad I'm a part of it he said brother Brooks what happened I didn't earn it I didn't deserve it Hallelujah he gave it to me amen is that all right let me read on he say' among whom also we had our conversation in time past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the minding were by Nature the children of Wrath even as other H you and me we us we look like we were the children of Wrath but in that old cockabur on the inside of the cockabur there was a wheat germ you talking about a transformation Hallelujah come on somebody and God struck that we that o cockabur one time amen and all of a sudden it changed into a weat among whom also we had our conversation anybody know what I'm talking about conversation is lifestyle we all were out there I don't care if you close yourself up in a monastery you still Wicked you were born that way Hallelujah and as long as you was born that way you going to have all kind of wicked thoughts and everything else they're tormenting you behind those walls there's only one place of safety Hallelujah and that's in the arms of Jesus is that all right people that listen the Bible said the righteousness of a man is like filthy rags huh you can't offer God your socalled your discipline God don't want your discipline he want you to be disciplined by the Holy Ghost come on if you was a goat and God changed your nature to a lamb you'll never ever again act like a goat you might look like one but but your Nature has been changed oh come on somebody that's what I try to tell people nature tells tells us this you don't have to the the the the cow don't go to school to to learn how to give milk all the cow got to do is be with the m and the milk comes see y'all didn't catch that amen it's okay it's okay by the grace of God we'll move on but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love where with he loved us now he didn't just say love he said great love great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins have quit weened us together with Christ with Christ by Grace you are saved now y'all understand with Christ if he just had said in Christ I and this was Christ I would have been inside of this but he said with Christ that means I'm right here with him I'm right by his side I am with him I'm join ass with Christ y'all hear what I'm saying I'm join ass with Christ Hallelujah because of Jesus Christ God raised us sinners up to the same level come on these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they cast out Devils Hallelujah come on somebody if they drink any deadly thing so when the squeeze come on and they give you something deadly to drink Don't Panic

the Bible says and I don't even know what time it is but I'm going to try to hurry I'm going try to move forward you see because a lot of time this was been a question of mine God at that day where on Earth all these people going to be that have been saved throughout AG well there's going to be the Bible say there were numbers no man could number and I'mma tell you why I'm a Holy Roller now now the

the Lord which dwelleth in Zion declare upon the people his doings right you got to listen I don't care you're going to look crazy these are the people amen telling the people amen the Lord is soon to come cuz a lot of people don't believe it no more Hallelujah but the Lord is soon to come when you tell them our Prophet said amen that God was going to let Russia drop a bomb on America see if they taping this I get trouble for that but that's okay it's true anyhow California you think it's going to drop off the map that is nothing fun that's nothing to Rejoice over but even scientist said they

you and I will be having a wonderful time like the brother said we're not looking for the the marriage we we're going to the supper it is an invisible Union right now God don't impregnated his bride without marrying her first come on somebody he has no illegit come on every one of his children are legit and God date you he'll caught you and when he finds you Faithful he gives you the Holy Ghost come on somebody now God saved the best for last that's right y'all better understand this it's true is that right Jesus said Lord he said I I want Rachel I want Rachel right and Rachel Daddy that old Slicker say say you can have Leo did you know what Leo represented Leo represented the Old Testament Leo represented the law come on Le represented the Jew come on somebody amen God had to marry the Jew first seven years Hallelujah and then but there was another seven he had to come Hallelujah another seven Church ages to get Rachel prophet of God said Rachel was his real wife woo wo because that's the one he asked for the first time Hallelujah that's where his heartbeat was glory to God is that all right amen ain't God good praise the Lord hallelujah listen turn with me Psalm 17:15 is that okay now I'm talking about in his arms safe in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus y'all ever thought about that so when you Earthbound you say hold up I'm not in the right place I'm supposed to be in Heavenly places my mind my thoughts my desires amen should be in Heavenly places and and if it's not in Heavenly places where am I come on somebody where am I there's no Purgatory if there is it must be here is that right amen so you got to realize if you're not in heaven you're somewhere and whatever you do to throughout the day tells you where your soul travel ooh because as you do on Earth is how you do in heaven and believe you me Souls do travel Souls do travel you think well I had this bad dream well where were you your soul travels at night come on and a lot of people don't realize amen that they travel that's why you can't let bad dreams go you got to bind those things you got to rebuke those things why because that's where Satan defeating you you ever F you ever had a bad dream and wake up feeling good Hallelujah and understand this why do people scream and holl when they have cuz you're there come on somebody amen Psalm 17 ain't that good amen I got I I surely got an amen and Amen brother am amen uh Psalm 17:15 praise the Lord as for me I will behold the face thy face in righteousness I shall be satisfied when I wait with thy likess Hallelujah I I might go in my cocoon my my cocoon as a caterpillar but when I come out of that cocoon hallelujah amen I'm a butterfly I'm a heavenbound creature come on somebody is that all right awake with his likeness that's the whole thing we fell from his very image and likeness see but even in man's Fallen State he's still a Creator that's why he create things he doesn't create like God by the word and then he perverts what God has created to create but it shows the cre created ability was once there and that ability never comes back until you truly Born Again of God you say oh what do you mean brother Brook that's what Jesus Christ while he was here the Bible said he was he was he was uh he was the light of men I love that phrase the light of men in other words he was the revelation of what a man was supposed to be because after Adam's fall everything was perverted I was no pervert yes you are you was born a pervert every one of us amen it's true you don't have to teach a child how to lie steal or get jealous it comes with the package provided when you and I were supposed to be in the likeness of God holy sanctified righteous full of love is that all right but you and I we come in such a perverted way amen but yet that's where Christ comes in he said there's another world though there's another world Hallelujah I'm from that world I come to declare to you that that world that land is there pilot said are you a king he said thou say for this purpose I came into this world to declare to you that there is a true world if there's a land that's dying there must be a land that's living Hallelujah if there's a land where the sun set there's a land where the Sun never sets woo amen and we've come to this place amen listen the Bible tells us that even all the creation the Bible declar that heaven and earth declares glory is that all right Psalms 19:1 says that that that that that the heaven declare uh the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handy work is that right he man I love that I love that because you know I I was getting into a well wasn't heed it but it was going to go that way I was in the barber shop and and I'm I'm witnessing to the to the Bible and telling him Jesus is the only way Jesus Christ you know and how is a didn't know he's a Muslim Hallelujah and I'm just telling him how Jesus Christ was the only way in how my daddy was a Muslim and this and that and telling me all the signs and wonders and things he said well I'm a Muslim and he said he said Christians aren't the only one that's treated bad he said the Muslims are treated bad too that's got cursed like a Satan I mean just he's a nistic to the core and he going to stand and tell me he's a Muslim sound like some Christians I know y'all hear what I'm saying and you know I look looked at that thing and I said Lord I said I don't know why you had me say all these things he let me go before he stopped me I think he was getting a little heated amen because you know there's nothing to Allah Allah is not even real it's an illusion a delusion come on somebody it is demon power behind the name they'll blow me up if they heard me say that but it's the truth and maybe one of these old days it might come to that and if it does so be it amen I got Jesus on the inside Hallelujah and if he's in the inside you and I cannot die like that old song said I done died once I can't die no more amen and if you died already to yourself and you're living the Bible say you're living unto Christ and we're here Amen to declare his glory I done jumped all over my notes but that's okay amen is that okay Matthew 18 I'm going close on this because I'm not I'm not finished folks I'm I'm working with something I'm trying to get us to see amen you're secure if you've got the Seal of the Holy Ghost you are secure there is nothing Paul said who shall separate me from the love of God you know I hear a lot of people say what what nothing can Se Me separate what can't separate sear he said who right because remember it was a who who separated us in the beginning it was the serpent he was a who not a what and that same old serpent amen who's called the devil amen will stand one day with his head bowed he said no sir the Bible said every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess even the devil don't want to say Jesus Christ is Lord but one of these old days before they throw him in the lake he going to have to say he's Lord he's the true God hallelujah Y and even his followers don't even know that that one of these old days the devil going to have to bow one more last time one more time one more time devil you going to have to bow but what he don't realize is he's bowing now every time you cast him out he's bowing he knows who the Lord is hallelujah come on somebody and the Bible tells us that at the name of Jesus that every demon trembles Hallelujah they know it it we just got to know it we got to know it amen Matthew 18 I'm trying to get [Music] there [Music] folks this thing and you've heard me say this before when I've got to say it again this thing is so fixed y'all y'all have heard me preach that before y'all remember I talked about that beauty contest a friend of mine was in it and this is JB whites in Columbia South Carolina at the richon mall he's the owner of it and his daughter was in the beauty pageant and my friend was in the beauty pageant and so happened I was going up on the same elevator they were coming down on and the man was asking inquir about his daughter in the beauty pageant and the man said you don't have to worry about it it's it see so no matter how good the contestants were they could have been better and they were some of them were better but what good would is going it wouldn't do they didn't know it wasn't doing them no good no matter how well they performed it was fixed why the money the price was paid come on somebody and this thing is so fixed the devil can't stand Hallelujah the price was paid Calvary paid the price Hallelujah and none of us are come up short the Bible said he's never lost one oh my brother I've done so bad you was a loser to begin with you born L that's right still would be without Jesus Christ amen I'm trying to get to this last scripture amen Matthew 19 18 I'm sorry and 10 you love the Lord why we're we're at the last day people you know we're looking at this thing and God has sent us Malachi 4 and they missed it just like John the Baptist came even Jesus disciples said we thought Elias was supposed to and Jesus said I tell you Elias has already come and you knew it not and they did unto him whatever they wanted to do and you knew it not he asked his disciples he said I'm going ask you a question when you went out into the Wilderness when you went out into the desert what did you go out to see a man dressed in fine linen somebody who could speak eloquently somebody of salt rment he says no no I tell you what you will not receive you went out to see a prophet and he says you know what there's no greater Prophet than John John wasn't a compromise oh come on somebody John told it just like it was and they hated him for it but that Spirit of Elijah has to come again before Jesus come he's Alpha and Omega a lot of people look at it let me tell you something that's why they couldn't believe Jesus he was too much of a man but it was all God he was a man when he cried in in Gethsemane he was a man when he cried at Lazarus tomb but that was God when he said Lazarus come forth Hallelujah he was a man when he was sleeping in the boat but when he stood up on the ram of that boat and said peace be still they asked the question what matter man is this you flu the test disciples once again it was not the man who stopped the the wind and the way that was God and when a true son and daughter of God see a miracle done by the spoken word is God it ain't you y'all hear what I'm saying that's what's wrong with denominations and organizations they like the donkey that carried Jesus y'all don't heard this before but I got to say it anyhow they're like the donkey he got excited about the crowd he thought amen the people amen was talking about him that's how preachers are you started praising God and worshiping him they get all puffed up like they just a donkey they're just carrying the word it ain't about the donkey it's about the man riding the donkey that's what's wrong with him y'all you know what I'm saying oh it's true it's true it's true ain't God good I don't know whether you've ever seen that movie is a it's it's a Christian movie old one I seen seen a long time ago and hmon and Esther and and King as who I can hurus said unto hmon what should I do to reward this man who saved my life he thought he was talking about him you need to put him on the finest Road you need to dress him up and put your M mle on him and put it put your ring on him and let him ride your horse and you know and and and and let him ride through the city you know giving him praise and honor he he was setting it up he set the stage up he thought it was for him but it was for his enemy and and and the and the King said well then you go get Mori you go get MCI and you put MCI oh he knew he was in trouble then and that's how some people is you know what I'm saying they think they gonna get something you know no no no no God knows who who gonna get it and who's not oh Lord have mercy here it is um take heed that you despise not one of these little ones but I say unto you that in heaven the angel do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven now you got to understand we didn't understand what that was until God sent us a prophet and showed us amen that that word Angel actually comes and we understand it as a word body y'all know that I got quiet I'm almost done I'm GNA let you go is that word body see because you got to understand amen the scripture tells us that the Bible is of no private interpretation you and I we don't even have a right to sit there and say well I think this is what it me hello why would you say that the Bible said according to Amos 3:7 God will not do one thing except he Reveals His secrets to Servant father so there's a gift that God reveals things to take Moses take Jesus take Noah like I said everybody who didn't listen to Noah now is a True Believer right and God always listen with all those great men of God there in the day of Jesus how can he stand there and said except you believe that I am he you shall likewise die in your that's the mystery of this day the mystery of this day that was God was going to do a wonder the Bible said though it be small it'll be a wonderful thing it'll be marvelous in your eyes is that right and if God prepared the way for the first coming he must prepare the way for the second he cannot change his first decision about doing something must remain the same otherwise he's not God he doesn't have two to three choices there's only one choice and that's the perfect way y'all hear what I'm saying so whenever God does things how many of y'all believe it's the end time well how you going to get out of it there's so many voices in the land which one's right huh which interpretation of this Bible is Right remember amen one bad interpretation one word misplaced caused this thing to be the way it is right now Satan said You shall surely not die right and because she listened to the serpent and ate of that fruit here we are and the Bible according to Revelations said if you add or take away the plag will be added your name will be taken out of the L's Book of Life out of the book of life is that right so you and I must understand if that be true then we need God we need the voice of God to tell us what this is all about and I guarantee you if it's the true word of God it'll have the Alpha and Omega principle he's the same yesterday it end forever you'll be able to find it from Genesis to Revelation this Bible only speaks of Jesus Christ and his bride y'all hear what I'm saying it's all a love story and God got a group of people they scattered all over the world he the tired of the foolishness they want to see God real they tired of all of this nonsense that people got going on out there they don't care about it it's going home time Hallelujah they look like fools following Jesus huh did they I always tell people I don't know it must be getting late y'all shifting but let me you know I'm saying that everywhere not not seeing nobody my point is when we see by the grace of God that God is doing a great work now how is he going to do if this is the hour if this is Babylon which means confusion right there's got to come a word something that's going to straighten out the confusion something that's going to tell the truth no matter what right and how God's going to do it he's not sending it by Donkey folks God chose man and it always will be so simple to people to walk right over it I want you to understand America have received a Revival in her day that has never ever happened in the whole of History ever look in the 50s look what we got or Robert Billy Graham all these Great Men of God hallelujah come on somebody never ever in the history of man have we ever seen amen the the miraculous things that happened on the SC that had happened on now if that was the outpouring according to Joel to don't you understand amen that the next thing is the burning God getting ready to send fire and how you going to escape the fire God said I'll Never Leave myself without a witness now Noah might have look like a fool but Noah had the plan of God Jesus how many of y'all would have followed Jesus oh we can raise our hand but the Bible said this Jesus had nowhere to lay his hand head he wasn't employed nowhere H he didn't even have a house to take you through everything he had was borrowed the donkey was borrowed the grave was borrowed where he SLA was borrowed he had nothing he would have looked like a modern day bomb out there Hallelujah but why did they follow him y'all hear what I'm saying why as we said earlier my sheep is my voice and they was with him from the beginning that is the only why you can believe a message that's so difficult other people amen you love the Lord I hope you were blessed tonight we trust you leaving incourage and I I I say it like this and this is not taken away from anything I I I love I love deep things I really do but you know what our church need we need something that's going to it's going to like to say when you eat it it's goingon to stick to your wheels it's gonna stick you know what I'm saying I mean we we we we we look and and folks we need a Revival in we we need a Revival in this place I mean we we we the brother come and he said oh he said it was wonderful it was powerful and that's true that's true but I want more of it I want more of it I want I want I want it to be so so when the Holy Spirit is in this place I mean he's he's he's he's so radiant in US amen somebody come in off the street and get healed or delivered or whatever the conviction of God y'all remember now Isuzu Street was that way and we supposed to be beyond that the Bible said amen we supposed to be seven times harder y'all to see the expansion but it's true right how many of y'all want to get there come on somebody come on you know that's what brother brother belon did if y'all whoever wasn't here get the SE tape get the tape brother brother the Lord used that man and he took us Amen to a a omnipotent place by the word of God what we should be that God say okay now you hear

yes Lord the devil is so nervous right now cuz he's afraid you going to get it but I'm going tell you something what he don't understand is ordained for you to get it it's ordained you going to get it
