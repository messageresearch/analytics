[0:45] Holiness without which no man shall see
[0:49] the Lord looking diligently lest any man
[0:53] fail of the grace of God lest any root
[0:57] of bitterness spring up and trouble you
[1:01] and thereby many be
[1:04] defiled lest there be any fornicator or
[1:08] profane person as Esau for one Marshal
[1:12] of meat sold his
[1:15] Birthright Jude
[1:28] please
[1:35] Jude first
[1:40] chapter we're going to read the third
[1:46] verse beloved when I gave all excuse me
[1:50] beloved when I gave all diligence to
[1:52] write unto you of the common
[1:56] salvation it was needful for me to write
[2:00] to you and exalt you that you should
[2:03] earnestly contend for the faith which
[2:08] was once
[2:09] delivered
[2:10] unto the Saints let us pray Heavenly
[2:15] Father God we come before you Lord as
[2:18] humbly as we know how and we thank you
[2:21] Father for being so real to us we thank
[2:25] you for being so good Lord you've been
[2:28] better to us than we have been to
[2:30] ourselves and Lord we just pray father
[2:33] that you cleanse us tonight and forgive
[2:36] us for all of our sins anything that we
[2:40] may have said done thought oh God
[2:42] anything that is not pleasing to you
[2:45] Lord and not in your will father
[2:48] continue to instruct us continue to lead
[2:51] us continue to cleanse us Lord with your
[2:54] fire of the Holy Spirit Lord I pray here
[2:57] tonight that you would give us Grace to
[2:59] move completely out of your way and Lord
[3:03] uh let thy will be done in Jesus
[3:06] Christ's name we pray amen you may be
[3:10] seated amen we appreciate the Lord
[3:14] Jesus and everything that he's doing my
[3:17] we had a wonderful time at Bible study
[3:19] last night Amen Brother Rich said it was
[3:22] the best he've had I said it was my best
[3:27] too I thought it was pretty good you
[3:29] know the Lord really came down and
[3:32] really blessed us by the grace of God
[3:35] but while I was actually uh uh we were
[3:38] teaching on last night uh something just
[3:41] kind of came to my heart in my mind and
[3:45] that was contending for the
[3:49] faith reason being is that we're living
[3:53] in a crucial time we're living in a Time
[3:56] amen where judgment and everything else
[3:59] is coming out our way and the thing
[4:01] about it is I don't know whether people
[4:04] know what faith is what the faith
[4:09] is uh because remember uh the word of
[4:12] God said when the son of man shall come
[4:14] shall he find the
[4:17] faith the faith is not a
[4:21] thing it is not a feeling it is not an
[4:26] emotion but the faith is a person amen
[4:31] let's say it like this in the beginning
[4:34] God created the heavens and the Earth
[4:39] and then Hebrew says by faith God
[4:43] created the heavens and the Earth and
[4:46] then the Bible tells us that Jesus
[4:49] Christ
[4:51] created the heavens and the Earth so by
[4:54] Jesus Christ God created the heavens and
[4:57] the Earth amen so we look at this thing
[5:00] and this is the whole argument in our
[5:03] day in our time on whether Jesus Christ
[5:07] is whether he is God whether he is the
[5:11] only God whether he is the only
[5:16] Creator that's the argument remember
[5:19] this argument or this uh subject just
[5:21] didn't start but the subject started in
[5:24] heaven when Lucifer said in his heart I
[5:27] will descend Ascend above the Throne of
[5:31] God so he likened himself to be God Amen
[5:36] and that's where the argument and it is
[5:38] still Lucifer is still claiming to be
[5:42] God now uh we understand that before
[5:47] Calvary Lucifer had power he had
[5:51] strength he deceived many he had men
[5:55] Hearts full of fear but the Bible tells
[5:58] us that Calvary God conquered death hell
[6:03] and the
[6:05] grave
[6:07] now what Lucifer did in in all of his
[6:11] doing he brought in all kinds of
[6:16] assorted let me put it this way assorted
[6:19] religions and all these assorted
[6:22] religions
[6:24] led to Lucifer or
[6:27] Satan but God only ever he's ever he's
[6:31] never had but one way Lucifer has
[6:34] assorted way he he has always being a
[6:40] liberal and we find out by the grace of
[6:43] God that we are now coming to a
[6:46] place and I really believe that the
[6:48] Rapture is on and it's been on for a
[6:50] while but it's picking up amen you know
[6:54] uh we'll speed up and it'll slow
[6:56] down and we realize by the grace of God
[6:59] God Amen I I I forgot the uh great uh uh
[7:04] uh uh man of God that once said we must
[7:08] prepare for battle in a time of
[7:12] peace and this is what the message is
[7:14] all about here tonight that you and I
[7:17] might come to a place that we are
[7:20] preparing for battle
[7:22] amen right we must know that there that
[7:26] the battle is on in it's not or when
[7:30] it's going to start it has been in array
[7:33] for a long while
[7:35] now and but we must as we see this enemy
[7:39] coming we
[7:41] must uh uh uh Place
[7:44] ourselves in a position of
[7:47] War
[7:49] now we we understand that uh none of
[7:53] this can be achieved by us it must be
[7:58] faith
[8:00] and we understand according to habca the
[8:03] word of God said behold his soul which
[8:06] is lifted up is not upright in him but
[8:11] the just shall
[8:12] live by his faith not your faith not my
[8:19] faith but his faith is that all right
[8:22] now Faith
[8:24] is uh is a law and this law contr thows
[8:30] all
[8:32] things I want you to think about what I
[8:34] just said faith is a law and this law
[8:39] controls all things because by faith God
[8:45] created so by faith God created let's
[8:50] say the world or creation and then
[8:54] creation brought forth the
[8:56] law right so in other words after the
[9:00] creation you can find the law that
[9:01] brought the
[9:02] creation and the law was God's way of
[9:07] doing things and let's put it this way
[9:11] he said listen he said let there
[9:19] be he
[9:23] spoke what he wanted to be
[9:27] created and he never died doubted it he
[9:31] believed what he
[9:34] said and it came to pass and that law
[9:39] still
[9:40] holds for the believer
[9:46] amen
[9:48] faith it is a
[9:51] master of all
[9:55] circumstances
[9:57] amen no matter what it
[10:00] is it Masters all
[10:06] circumstances hello somebody in other
[10:09] words I don't care what your
[10:10] circumstances are faith will slow walk
[10:13] it and Conquer it
[10:18] amen and you see our faith is not in a
[10:21] human
[10:23] being because what we're going to see
[10:25] down the road is that this world want us
[10:28] to put Faith in a system or faith in a
[10:31] person called a pope or you know what
[10:34] I'm saying our faith is not any in any
[10:37] any other king outside of the king of
[10:41] kings now I want you to see that when
[10:44] when we we we uh uh how can I say it
[10:49] here job knows that faith is not just
[10:52] anything CU job says in the 13th chapter
[10:56] 8th verse will we ex will ye accept his
[11:00] person or and it says will ye contend
[11:04] with
[11:06] God right so we realize you've got a
[11:10] choice you can receive him or you can
[11:13] fight with
[11:16] him you can receive him or you can fight
[11:19] with him hello somebody but remember
[11:23] faith is on your side
[11:26] amen I like this
[11:30] when we talk about contending for the
[11:33] faith we're literally talking about
[11:36] contending or arguing or fighting or
[11:39] striving with all opposition amen that
[11:46] willah denounce
[11:48] God belittle
[11:51] God in any kind of way as to say he's
[11:55] not the same he doesn't
[11:58] exist or any sort of thing like that
[12:00] we're here to contend amen and to prove
[12:05] and to declare that the Jesus Christ
[12:09] that lives today is the Jehovah of the
[12:12] Old Testament and he is the creator of
[12:16] all things now we're not going to uh uh
[12:20] submit ourselves to anything less than
[12:23] that as I was studying I thought about
[12:27] uh inent that Keith to Shar with me some
[12:29] years ago about being in this Bible
[12:32] study and this uh man he he told in the
[12:35] Bible study he said Jesus Christ is God
[12:38] and the man got really upset about it
[12:41] hello now how can a Christian who knows
[12:45] God per se say that Jesus Christ is not
[12:51] God let me say like this I've been
[12:53] really studying this thing because I've
[12:54] been telling people this for a long time
[12:57] even when I was in Li Lima or
[13:00] I want you to know that every preacher
[13:03] every renowned person that you see
[13:05] supposedly in the pull pit is not for
[13:08] Jesus
[13:11] Christ there are people who are
[13:14] Jesuits who have filtrated the
[13:17] rinking of this message come on somebody
[13:20] and they come out with these strange odd
[13:23] doctrines and you wonder what this all
[13:27] about but I will will not stand with any
[13:30] man who refus to acknowledge that Jesus
[13:34] Christ is the Holy
[13:40] Ghost because the Holy Ghost is my
[13:46] faith hello
[13:48] somebody if you take the word of God and
[13:51] you go back to the Old Testament that's
[13:53] what it was the Holy Ghost the pill of
[13:56] fire however you want to say him you
[13:57] know here was the ark of the Covenant
[14:00] right there with Israel and Israel was
[14:02] always protecting it why because that
[14:05] was their
[14:06] faith that was their God come on
[14:09] somebody they always protected it
[14:12] because that was their faith that was
[14:14] their God let me I wrote down a few
[14:17] things that faith is Faith is a gift
[14:20] itself faith is a positive sense faith
[14:23] is the six sense faith is a direct
[14:26] Revelation it is something you uh uh
[14:29] subconsciously do faith has a pull faith
[14:35] is fearless faith is the victory faith
[14:38] has a long range Vision come on somebody
[14:42] faith is a substance faith is a
[14:44] conqueror faith is an overcomer faith is
[14:48] a law of God and faith and by it all
[14:51] things are
[14:54] accessible all
[14:58] things
[15:00] all
[15:02] things I love it the way Jesus says and
[15:07] I'm tying this in now he said if you
[15:10] have the faith of a mustard seed he
[15:13] didn't say size he said faith if you
[15:16] have the faith of a mustard seed and
[15:19] then according to the Book of John the
[15:21] Bible said if the seed remains in you
[15:24] you cannot
[15:26] sin then brother brandham comes along
[15:28] and he says in the midst of your heart
[15:30] is a is a little place in there by the
[15:33] size of a pinpoint pin head right kind
[15:38] of like a mustard
[15:40] seed and he says basically if that if
[15:43] that little place in your heart is
[15:47] quickened it is not something he's
[15:49] telling us it's not something that could
[15:51] be hybrid or mixed or or watered down or
[15:55] it is pure
[15:57] faith and that little speck that little
[16:01] pin head that's in your heart is able to
[16:04] move mountains
[16:07] amen why because that little pin head is
[16:11] God
[16:12] Amen when God is occupying the Throne of
[16:16] your heart that's why people I feel it
[16:19] all over me that's the
[16:20] anointing that's just a a a portion of
[16:23] it but his life is there whether you
[16:27] feel it or not amen
[16:32] whether you feel it or not it's there
[16:35] but he said in that day you'll know that
[16:38] I'm in the father that's why I thank God
[16:40] God ain't in Rome God is in my
[16:43] heart Hallelujah but there's a lot of
[16:45] people believe that God is in
[16:50] Rome Hallelujah sitting up there amen
[16:53] with
[16:54] a big hat whatever you call it and go
[16:57] God don't have to ride in Pop mobile
[17:00] come
[17:02] on God don't need man's
[17:05] protection Hallelujah man needs God
[17:08] protection now let's move on faith is
[17:11] something sometime you don't even know
[17:12] you have but it's there amen cuz God
[17:16] don't show he don't put on the show for
[17:18] anybody he is God right and you and I
[17:22] you say well what do you why are you
[17:23] preaching this because I'm telling you
[17:25] when you believe that you're a true son
[17:27] and daughter of God
[17:29] hold to that amen amen hello somebody
[17:34] you hold to that come on because listen
[17:38] you're not doing the work it's the faith
[17:40] in you that's doing the work what did
[17:43] God tell Israel hold still I'll fight
[17:46] your battles that same God that fought
[17:49] Israel's battles are the it's the same
[17:51] God that's fighting our battles but he
[17:55] said you hold still then he comes on and
[17:58] says listen Israel I'm going to put I
[17:59] want you to do something for me because
[18:01] I like it some people don't understand
[18:03] why God loves
[18:05] worship God loves worship because
[18:07] there's a law if you worship me I'll
[18:10] bless you see we're not the one God
[18:13] ain't so much being blessed because he
[18:15] gave us everything so he gives you
[18:17] everything he said give it back and I'll
[18:19] bless you with it amen right come on the
[18:22] more you say Jesus the closer he becomes
[18:25] to you right y'all hear what I'm saying
[18:27] and that is the key to worship worship
[18:30] you you give back to God what he's given
[18:32] you God comes down and rewards
[18:37] you for giving it back to
[18:40] him that's why I try to tell people I
[18:43] said listen when you come to church the
[18:45] Bible tells us that God inhabits the
[18:47] praise of his
[18:53] people
[18:54] huh it's just amazing it amazes me you
[18:58] you know uh how uh the world can get
[19:02] such their people on such a one Accord
[19:04] and we we we come to church and and
[19:07] can't get everybody just on one Accord
[19:09] to
[19:10] worship and the worship is not you know
[19:13] you're not here to uh bless uh brother
[19:15] Isaac or me is about
[19:18] God contending for the faith when the
[19:22] devil say you ought to be quiet you said
[19:24] no I heard the prophet said wherever
[19:27] Jesus is there's a lot of noise
[19:30] so I'm going to put my share of the
[19:31] noise in the
[19:36] pot
[19:38] right I I noise a lot of time noise

[19:44] he said I want you to take your lamp and
[19:47] and I want you to crack this thing and
[19:48] when you crack it I want you to make a
[19:50] Lou of noise blow them trumpet come on

[21:04] maker of all things and he you worried
[21:06] about it where God can do it and he's
[21:08] still holding the sun holding the moon
[21:10] holding all the stars and the
[21:11] consolation in his hand and and you
[21:13] looking at your little itty bitty
[21:15] problem that he can't even see under a
[21:20] microscope it's nothing but the truth we
[21:23] add burdens that God can't even
[21:26] F can you imagine cast your burdens the
[21:29] whole Christian people is casting their
[21:32] burdens on God and he don't even feel

[21:48] contending for it we're preparing for
[21:50] battles we we're taking God at his word
[21:53] for
[21:55] everything when Satan rais his head God
[21:59] has given us the authority to take it
[22:02] offen hello why are you saying this

[22:12] in your life is for youen and God want
[22:15] to mature you in those battles he want
[22:18] to give you a testimony y'all it's going
[22:20] to be a sad thing to get over there with
[22:23] no
[22:26] testimony when God said the over
[22:28] overcome the
[22:30] world by the blood and the word of their
[22:33] testimony you got to have a testimony
[22:36] that's why he's sending you through
[22:37] these things Hallelujah and by faith I
[22:40] am a victory a Victor hallelujah

[22:47] to feel it I know God has saved me and I
[22:51] know I'm bride how you know brother
[22:53] Brook by faith I know that I am and
[22:56] faith is a revel
[23:02] turn with me to Matthew's 8th chapter
[23:10] please most of the time we just get in
[23:12] the way that's
[23:14] all we get in the way you get frustrated
[23:17] God said don't get frustrated because
[23:18] the devil get you frustrated he'll get
[23:19] you to sin he get you to doing things
[23:21] you ain't got no business doing right he
[23:23] said don't don't be that way right don't
[23:25] let no building spring up in you because
[23:28] he the devil knows if bitterness come up
[23:30] in you now you got an attitude and he
[23:32] can get you to do things that you
[23:33] wouldn't normally do then he goes on and
[23:35] say you be careful because what the
[23:37] devil does he he put a bitterness in you
[23:39] then he makes you feel lonely then he
[23:41] says listen you go get you some comfort
[23:43] then all of a sudden you become a
[23:47] fornicator he said don't be like that
[23:50] that's
[23:53] Esau profane
[23:56] ungodly Hallelujah you trying to find
[23:58] comfort in the world and God got your
[24:01] comfort I'mma tell you something Solomon
[24:04] was never
[24:07] satisfied that's the truth a thousand
[24:10] wives and he never was
[24:11] satisfied probably if he could have
[24:13] lived long and you know what I'm saying
[24:14] he would have had it more than that but
[24:16] he never was
[24:18] satisfied and I'm going tell you
[24:20] something you'll never satisfy this
[24:26] flesh no sir the only time you can put
[24:28] this thing under under control is get
[24:30] the Holy Ghost Hallelujah come on
[24:33] somebody it's nothing but the
[24:36] truth Satan get you to doing things you
[24:38] ain't got no business doing because amen
[24:41] and you know what the this the part the
[24:44] scary about it you can do it one too
[24:48] many and sell your
[24:53] Birthright you don't want to do that you
[24:55] don't but that's where he's driving you
[24:58] amen driving you to a point where if you
[25:01] cry out to God there's no more
[25:04] repentance that's what selling your
[25:06] Birthright
[25:10] is Now understand this you got to pull
[25:14] and you here that means you're still
[25:17] okay thank you Lord hallelujah but don't
[25:21] play too long with God y'all hear what
[25:24] I'm saying
[25:25] amen cuz when you when you said listen I
[25:28] I just don't know I I tell you what I
[25:31] that that used to scare me all the time
[25:33] when the Bible said Esau sought it and
[25:35] couldn't find

[25:57] day
[26:00] one way or another I'm telling you you

[26:06] Centurion answered and said Lord I am
[26:10] not worthy that thou should come under
[26:12] my roof but speak the word only and my
[26:16] servant shall be healed now come on this
[26:20] is so powerful to
[26:22] me to see a centurion a man who is a
[26:26] Roman citizen don't even know anything
[26:29] about Jehovah God but have heard
[26:34] Jesus and when he is saying this he's
[26:37] saying I know you're God I know you're
[26:40] the Messiah when all of the Jews didn't
[26:43] want to believe he was this man said I
[26:45] know you got
[26:47] Authority he said I understand Authority

[26:52] go they go stay stay they stay he said
[26:55] you don't even have to go where I want
[26:56] you to go you speak the word

[27:07] faith God is
[27:09] Supernatural all things are possible to
[27:12] them that believe

[27:17] believe you could be saved it's the same
[27:20] Faith that'll take you into the
[27:26] Rapture he said for I'm a man under
[27:29] Authority having soldiers under me and I
[27:32] say to this man go and he goeth and to
[27:35] another come and he cometh and to my
[27:37] servant do this and he doeth it and when
[27:40] Jesus heard it he marveled and said to
[27:44] them that followed verily verily I say
[27:47] unto you I have not found so great faith
[27:51] know not in
[27:54] Israel now remember it's a
[27:57] giften and God had given that Centurion
[28:01] faith in
[28:04] Christ did it
[28:08] work if you confidence that God is can
[28:11] do it then God will do it if you have
[28:14] the confidence that God will do it he'll
[28:17] do it

[28:39] subconsciously she didn't even know she
[28:41] was a Daughter of
[28:42] Zion she didn't even know what made her
[28:45] believe it but she believed it anyway
[28:47] and for some reason she said the right
[28:49] thing just like had it
[28:52] right all had a right was he she wasn't
[28:55] there but she heard about those
[28:57] squirrels and she said that ain't
[28:59] nothing but the truth brother brandom
[29:01] and God thundered out of heaven and said
[29:03] give her what she want whatever she
[29:06] asked for give her what she want he said
[29:09] she could have asked for a million a
[29:11] million calite whatever she wanted she
[29:13] said but she asked for The Souls of her
[29:14] two sons and when she said Lord give me
[29:17] the souls of my two son the Holy Ghost
[29:18] fell and baptized them right there
[29:21] amen hallelujah come on and there'll be
[29:27] there

[29:33] those boys didn't even have to stay at
[29:34] the altar amen hallelujah come on
[29:37] somebody they were act actually giggling
[29:39] and everything else and God dropped
[29:41] repentance in their heart right then and
[29:43] all of a sudden the holy go seal
[29:45] them you said they were crying and
[29:47] balling all over the floor that's what
[29:50] the that's what God will do for

[30:20] but the children of this Kingdom will be
[30:22] cast out and they
[30:24] were they were destroyed and killed over
[30:27] there in 70
[30:29] AD hello that's Matthew 17 please and
[30:34] Jesus said unto them because of your
[30:35] unbelief for I say unto you if ye have
[30:38] faith as a grain of a mustard seed ye
[30:40] shall say unto this mountain remove
[30:42] hence to Y the place and it shall remove

[31:08] impossible it would be to do that
[31:11] without
[31:13] faith why because I told you faith is
[31:15] not a thing it's a person it's Jesus
[31:18] Christ believing what you

[32:56] God's word be true and every man be a
[32:58] liar you don't look at near we no we
[33:01] look way out there and we call it like

[33:05] is God promised it you keep testifying
[33:09] and praising God for it amen amen
[33:12] hallelujah oh not no hope no God said so
[33:16] if I've got the faith to believe it and
[33:18] speak it it shall
[33:20] happen that's the truth amen that's the
[33:23] truth you said circumstances come upon
[33:26] me sometime and I don't know what to do
[33:28] okay let's hold fast St Mark will tell
[33:30] you just what to
[33:31] do St Mark
[33:34] 4 that all right
[33:38] 39 4th verse and he rose and rebuked the
[33:41] wind and said unto the sea peace be
[33:48] still and the wind ceased and there was
[33:51] a great Cal and he said unto them why
[33:55] are ye so fearful that's when you know
[33:58] you ain't got it when your circumstances
[34:01] has caused you to be fearful faith is
[34:04] absence because faith is
[34:07] fearless amen hello some come on
[34:10] somebody amen faith is fearless so when
[34:13] fear is there and I don't mean fear
[34:15] won't come but perfect life cast out
[34:18] fear Hallelujah and when that fear
[34:21] overtakes you and you're worrying faith
[34:23] is not
[34:26] there you spoke BR it but you didn't
[34:28] believe
[34:29] it and they feared and they listen and
[34:33] said unto them why are you so fearful
[34:36] how is it that you have no
[34:39] faith now here was Jesus on the boat
[34:42] like Jesus in in your boat he's in you
[34:46] they knew he was there they woke him up
[34:49] Lord cares thou not that we
[34:52] perish how can you drown with eternal
[34:54] life's laying right
[34:56] there
[34:59] and you know the situation what it was
[35:02] he was laying there as a father and a
[35:06] tutorer he wanted them to stand up and
[35:09] say peace be still that's why he rebuked
[35:11] them yes there are times God would do it
[35:14] for us but he wants us to do it while
[35:17] you crying Moses you speak
[35:20] it and believe
[35:23] it I don't understand it sometimes but
[35:26] I'm going tell you even witches got more
[35:28] faith in their working than we have in
[35:31] ours they'll conjure up some stuff and
[35:33] do this whatever they do and believe it
[35:36] and it happens because faith is a law
[35:40] amen faith is a
[35:45] law faith is a
[35:51] law you've heard of people amen they
[35:53] talking about adrenaline caught and fell
[35:55] on a loved one and that woman pick it up
[35:57] like this ear
[35:58] and don't even know how she did it
[36:01] Faith she was caught up into a
[36:03] revelation she was going to do it it
[36:05] happened before she even knew
[36:09] it that's what faith will
[36:14] do hello
[36:17] somebody listen St Mark 4:39 and
[36:22] 40 all right let's 41 and they feared it
[36:26] sealingly and said one to another what
[36:28] matter of man is this it wasn't no man
[36:31] see it it shows that Revelation wasn't
[36:34] right brother B said they Revelation
[36:36] wasn't right at that point because
[36:38] they're asking what not a man is this it
[36:40] wasn't a man who did it it was God who
[36:43] did it amen even the Centurion had a
[36:45] better Revelation amen of what his own
[36:48] disciples had at this point in time what
[36:50] kind of man they was no man that was God
[36:53] on the boat
[36:56] Hallelujah that was God brother brandom
[36:59] even tried to help us to tell us like
[37:01] Jesus never healed one
[37:03] person he tried to help us with that
[37:06] that it was God doing the work he said I
[37:09] can't do nothing except the father show
[37:10] me so it was God doing the work he saw
[37:13] God doing and he just put himself in the
[37:15] place where God was doing it
[37:18] amen
[37:20] hallelujah it ain't you it always will
[37:23] be
[37:24] God come on
[37:26] somebody
[37:28] ain't God good to us contending for the
[37:31] faith because you know we've got all
[37:33] listen what's going to happen understand
[37:36] when the when this squeeze come on us
[37:38] and this thing began to happen you think
[37:40] you going the only one be with signs and
[37:43] wonders that wasn't like that in Exodus
[37:45] time in in in Janice and jambre time
[37:48] they had power they did some things that
[37:51] the eyes were able to see that's what
[37:55] confuses the Pentecostals they could be
[37:57] all off the raw word and they still have
[38:00] SE Miracles because they don't
[38:01] understand the law of
[38:04] Faith you don't have to be a Christian
[38:06] to see a
[38:08] miracle you just got to have
[38:15] faith oh my goodness he talks about he
[38:18] tried to tell us he said those James and
[38:20] those Hindus over there they can take
[38:21] swords and push it through here and walk
[38:24] on Coes how many of y'all can do it yes
[38:27] every one of you can do it if you put
[38:30] your faith to
[38:31] it it wasn't a trick question but as a
[38:34] human being you can't do that but they
[38:36] believe that if I they could walk it and
[38:38] they it happens because it's a law Jesus
[38:42] believed he could walk on the water it
[38:44] happened Peter believed he could walk on
[38:47] the water it happened but as soon as his
[38:50] faith failed
[38:52] him you'all see what I'm saying amen so
[38:55] don't tell me that we can't walk on
[38:56] water we can do it
[39:04] amen ain't God good to
[39:07] us I heard something in the other day
[39:10] and I thought man that is something
[39:11] interesting something I had never heard
[39:13] of but you know
[39:17] what I often wondered
[39:20] how uh um Adam was even able to name
[39:24] fish and all
[39:26] that
[39:29] think about it he named
[39:31] everything all the Beast and all you
[39:34] think about it what what was what was
[39:37] going on where Adam could even name fish
[39:39] and birds and cuz Dominion to to have
[39:44] dominion it means that you are
[39:46] above them above everything that's
[39:52] created just a good question I don't
[39:54] know the
[39:55] answer but I'm saying F something some
[39:59] things that God hasn't told us
[40:04] yet you you don't think he communicate
[40:07] okay let me put it this way either he
[40:09] created all those fish that Peter caught
[40:12] or he called them and told him to come
[40:14] by this
[40:17] way huh something he did we don't know
[40:20] how he did it he either created all
[40:22] those fish or somehow he communicated
[40:26] with those fish
[40:28] and they
[40:33] came you don't thinkk
[40:36] God oh was just a coincidence that this
[40:39] whale that God prepared for Jonah was
[40:41] just swimming through the y'all hear
[40:44] what I'm saying God prepared a fish for
[40:47] Jonah amen perfect timing throw me
[40:52] overboard when you see what God God can
[40:54] do
[40:56] it whatever your situations are God can
[41:00] change it but you got to speak it and
[41:02] believe it amen whatsoever you ask in my
[41:05] name believing that you shall receive it
[41:07] it shall be given unto you contending
[41:10] for the faith is
[41:11] action
[41:17] action John
[41:20] 5:38 ye have not his word abiding in you
[41:25] for whom he have sent him ye believe
[41:29] not huh now his word is Faith by
[41:35] faith God created and how did he do it
[41:38] word he spoke it and he goes on and
[41:42] talks up tell these people listen if if
[41:44] my word is not abiding in you you you
[41:47] don't have you you I'm listen let's
[41:50] let's turn there amen St John
[41:55] 5 ain't God good to us
[41:58] people is it's right in front of us it's
[42:00] not something that you got to muster
[42:02] up brother bam told tells us about
[42:04] little simple Faith something told me I
[42:07] can pick this up and I just did it I
[42:10] didn't have to know the mathematics
[42:11] behind it I just did it he said when you
[42:15] he said Faith does this because you are
[42:18] actually uh Defying Gravity amen but
[42:21] something in you telling you I can do
[42:23] this right there was no effort in that
[42:26] it was just it is what it is you know
[42:29] when you sweating and everything else oh
[42:31] like I told somebody and I've told them
[42:33] many times you done pray for somebody
[42:34] and the temperature going up and you say
[42:36] take the temperature again you just lost
[42:38] it because Faith don't have to take it a
[42:41] second
[42:43] time when you do that now you you worked
[42:47] against your
[42:49] faith if you really got faith you don't
[42:51] have to check
[42:55] it it works against it because what is
[42:58] now what if the temperature is no longer
[43:01] 102 but
[43:02] 104 well out of your mou oh it's getting
[43:05] words and you say well I didn't say it
[43:06] but you thought it and in heaven he
[43:09] hears your thoughts quicker than he does
[43:10] your
[43:15] words see what I'm saying so let let's
[43:18] read this here come quickly so let's
[43:20] hurry up so
[43:23] um okay there's another coming from the
[43:26] 32nd verse there's another that beareth
[43:28] witness of me and I know that the
[43:30] witness which he Witnesses of me is true
[43:33] ye sent unto John and he Beed witness
[43:36] unto the truth but I received not
[43:38] testimony from man but these things I
[43:40] say that you might be saved he was a
[43:43] burning and a Shining Light and you were
[43:45] willing for a season rejoice in his
[43:47] light but I have greater witness than
[43:50] that of John for The Works which the
[43:52] father hath given me to finish the same
[43:54] works that I do bear witness of me
[43:57] that the father ha sent me and the
[44:00] father himself have sent me have borne
[44:02] witness of me ye have nether heard of
[44:05] his voice at any time nor seen his shape
[44:08] and ye have not his word abiding in you
[44:10] for whom he ha sent him ye believe
[44:15] not come on somebody and he and and that
[44:18] goes on for the day amen hallelujah
[44:21] people well I got the word I got the
[44:23] word listen God sent us a prophet if you
[44:25] can't believe the word that God sent you
[44:27] don't you don't believe amen you say you
[44:30] do but it's a revelation it is it is a
[44:34] revelation it's truly a
[44:37] revelation but I know you that you have
[44:40] not the love of God St John
[44:42] 5:42 right let's let's let's let's
[44:44] finish reading that right search the
[44:47] scriptures for in them that you think
[44:49] you have eternal life and they are they
[44:52] which testify of me and ye will not come
[44:55] to me that you might have life and ye
[44:57] will not come to me that you will have
[44:59] not life I receive not honor from men
[45:03] but I know you that you have not the
[45:05] love of God in you now that is something
[45:09] for God to say I know you now remember
[45:12] Amen in the in the chapter there when
[45:14] those disciple of whoever it is they
[45:17] come and they said Lord haven't we done
[45:19] great things in your name their their
[45:23] approach in
[45:25] itself has given them away on who they
[45:28] are amen Lord did not we do great things
[45:32] in your name see first of all if you
[45:36] ever do anything for God you know you've
[45:39] never done anything amen here was a
[45:42] prophetic man who had done all these
[45:44] great things supposedly for God he's
[45:46] laying on his bed and he says my I have
[45:48] not done anything for the Lord and if
[45:51] I'm going to do anything I better get up
[45:53] and be about my father's business amen
[45:55] millions of Souls save for God and he's
[45:58] laying there thinking he's not done
[46:01] anything see that's the way a true
[46:03] servant believe that's the way that's
[46:06] what's in his heart he whatever he he's
[46:08] doing it can't Mount up to anything cuz
[46:11] he's doing nothing amen everything
[46:13] that's been done has been God Amen
[46:21] hallelu I know that you have not the
[46:23] love of God in you I am come in my
[46:25] father's name and you receive receive me
[46:27] not if another shall come in his own
[46:29] name him you shall receive you hear what
[46:31] he's saying if you don't receive the
[46:33] name of the Lord Jesus Christ you're
[46:35] going to receive the
[46:38] pope because he's going to come in his
[46:40] own name he's telling you if you don't
[46:43] receive me you're going to receive the
[46:44] mark of the
[46:49] beast think about what he just said
[46:51] there see contending for the faith I
[46:55] want to say this cuz I was looking to
[46:57] looking at a little documentary today
[46:58] before
[46:59] coming but may God have mercy on
[47:04] us and I was just looking at what it
[47:07] took for the world to get this Bible to
[47:10] us the
[47:11] church all of the blood that's on this
[47:15] book all of the effort people have been
[47:18] killed their children loved ones
[47:20] murdered and killed through inquisitions
[47:22] and everything else uh uh Jesuits and
[47:25] you know Catholic church and you know
[47:27] and and think about it we've got the
[47:30] King James
[47:32] version right we've got the Bible that
[47:35] it took people you know Luther's Wesley
[47:38] they they love this
[47:40] word now in our day we got so much you
[47:44] hardly read it and we forget the
[47:47] cost what it took for you to get this
[47:51] into your hands and right now the
[47:54] Catholic church and that Machinery that
[47:57] God is right now working real hard to
[48:00] change this Bible back into something
[48:04] that will accept
[48:06] them there's a new Bible that has
[48:09] literally taken out the word
[48:15] Antichrist and here we are people at a
[48:18] generation that people don't even know
[48:19] nothing about the King James they
[48:21] getting this HIV I mean um NIV version
[48:25] and I didn't mean to say HIV I meant NIV
[48:27] I done said that so much till it just
[48:28] come programmed in my head but I mean
[48:30] NIV
[48:32] version and and the people don't
[48:35] know they don't even have the Holy Ghost
[48:37] to discern whether it's right or not
[48:40] amen and think about the spirit that's
[48:42] coming with it because it's there to
[48:45] unite people together so that they can
[48:49] understand there's no difference between
[48:51] you and me but there is a difference
[48:55] amen
[48:58] and I I I I for what I saw today and
[49:01] understand the word vika itself means
[49:04] Antichrist
[49:08] anti so when you look at this thing and
[49:10] you say oh my God you know I what you
[49:13] think how God going to judge us on this
[49:15] thing we won't read our word we won't we
[49:19] won't we won't we won't listen to our
[49:20] tapes and books and all and we we
[49:22] Christians we forget the blood stain is
[49:26] greater than the bloodstained Battle of
[49:28] that flag we got it's greater than
[49:31] that the
[49:32] cost that has taken and what's going to
[49:35] happen when this book is taken from your
[49:37] from your possession and then you don't

[51:08] and and but you know and this is what

[51:18] and ye in me and I in you don't stop
[51:21] till you know that cuz that's your seal
[51:24] amen that is your seal that's marck in
[51:27] your forehead to know that you know that
[51:30] you know that God is in you I'm not
[51:32] talking about some false
[51:34] pregnancy amen y'all know some women
[51:37] have psychologically made them
[51:39] themselves believe that they were
[51:40] pregnant and they never were and they
[51:42] grew and went through the all the
[51:43] changes my wife can bear witness we know
[51:45] a woman who did
[51:46] that nine months and was nothing
[51:51] there she made herself believe that she
[51:53] was
[51:55] pregnant
[51:58] but with God you don't make yourself
[51:59] believe you know you had an experience
[52:01] you know something came in you you know
[52:04] something change your life I'm not
[52:06] talking about your flesh I'm talking
[52:08] about your soul amen your flesh going to
[52:10] always give you
[52:12] trouble it's going to always I hate that
[52:15] you a lot of us we don't want to want to
[52:17] hear that you know but it's true I don't
[52:19] like it either but that's the way God
[52:21] designed it but think about it this
[52:23] thing that gave you trouble all your
[52:25] life and then all of sudden a wind come
[52:27] through you and a sharp pain and the
[52:29] next thing you know you standing in your
[52:31] glorified it'll be worth it all
[52:34] amen I guarantee you you'll never miss
[52:37] this
[52:41] one God is after your soul he condemned
[52:44] your flesh so don't worry about your
[52:46] flesh will take care of itself God will
[52:48] take care of that think about it no
[52:50] matter how much you grooming it's still
[52:52] getting older but the soul is getting
[52:54] younger amen it's getting strong
[52:56] stronger amen is that right just give me
[52:59] a few more minutes amen can you please
[53:01] amen so God will is to live in his
[53:05] people his life through you in other
[53:07] words God wants you to be a walking
[53:10] Faith
[53:14] Tabernacle a walking Faith machine amen
[53:17] a walking Faith
[53:23] Tabernacle did you know David had a
[53:25] tabernacle I'm jumping on something I'm
[53:26] studying that now and I'm not fully
[53:28] right with it but David had a
[53:31] tabernacle the scripture says
[53:33] it but what David did David was showing
[53:37] amen that here Solomon was building the
[53:39] Temple but David had a tabernacle of his
[53:42] own and he took that Ark and he put it
[53:44] in his
[53:46] Tabernacle and David was showing what
[53:48] was going to happen to
[53:50] mankind that God was going to put see
[53:53] Jerusalem the New Jerusalem won't be
[53:55] nothing without God being in you amen is
[53:58] God in a tabernacle
[54:02] amen why we be in a tabernacle if that
[54:05] makes sense God in us and we in God
[54:09] that's the way it
[54:11] is listen he said if you abide in me and
[54:15] I in you as a branch cannot bear of
[54:17] itself except it abide in the vine no
[54:20] more can ye except you abide in me now
[54:23] let me let me put it this way for some
[54:25] reason
[54:26] we have this in we have this thing we
[54:29] always put it
[54:30] off like like the World Church is
[54:33] thinking you know the Rapture is coming
[54:36] well the Rapture is here amen God is
[54:39] right now changing you from glory to
[54:40] glory oh they can't see it but it's
[54:44] happening God is now building a bride
[54:47] right now amen and when God seal you
[54:50] with the Holy Ghost you're Rapture
[54:52] material your soul has already been
[54:55] raptured that's why he can say you're
[54:57] sitting in Heavenly places in Christ
[55:00] Jesus amen right and the world can't see
[55:04] it but it's happening now my point is
[55:07] this if you abide in me and I in you
[55:11] that's the key abiding in him and him in
[55:14] you ask what you will and he goes on to
[55:17] say you going to bear fruit
[55:23] amen you know what it is it's true I was
[55:27] reading some things about
[55:30] conelius and I forgot how many
[55:33] years the the word of God had been going
[55:36] I think it was 10 years after Pentecost
[55:38] when Kus uh Paul and then went to uh
[55:42] Peter and went to Kia's house but we
[55:45] think it was just just the other day 10
[55:48] years nobody knew nothing about canas
[55:51] but God
[55:53] did and in one service canas in his
[55:56] whole house receive the Holy Ghost you
[55:59] see it's about God it ain't about you
[56:01] it's about
[56:03] God right so we look at this thing and
[56:05] you say brother what you look and it's
[56:07] just somehow we feel like we got to do
[56:09] this we got to be doing this this this
[56:11] this this this this this and God may
[56:13] have just ordained you to do one thing
[56:16] that could be just one Soul you bring to
[56:18] the Lord amen that could be all you
[56:20] ordained
[56:23] for you wonder Lord have I done anything
[56:26] for are you he said one soul is worth a
[56:28] million world
[56:30] Amen
[56:32] Hallelujah what can be greater than a
[56:34] soul you can have the power to heal you
[56:37] can have the power to prophesy all of
[56:38] that's going to cease but think about a
[56:40] soul the greatest thing you could ever
[56:43] do is win a soul to God
[56:48] Amen and the devil said will you haven't
[56:50] done nothing for the
[56:54] Lord and I'm going tell you something
[56:56] some of these seeds you planting you
[56:58] won't see until you get on the other
[57:00] side of
[57:03] Jordan I'm I'm going move on now amen
[57:06] Romans 8-9 8 and9 says but Ye Ye are not
[57:09] in the flesh but in the spirit if so be
[57:11] that the spirit of God dwell in you
[57:14] hello now think what he just said I want
[57:17] you to really let's see it but ye are
[57:19] not in the flesh but in the spirit if so
[57:23] be that the spirit of God dwells in you
[57:26] in other words if the spirit of God
[57:29] hallelujah if the spirit of God dwells
[57:31] in you he doesn't even see your flesh
[57:35] glory amen he's not judging oh come on
[57:38] somebody that's the scripture
[57:40] said let's read again but ye are not in
[57:43] the flesh but in the
[57:47] spirit if so be that the spirit of God
[57:50] dwells in you amen because if the spirit
[57:52] of God dwells in you he's looking at
[57:54] that seed and he said that seed cannot
[58:00] s
[58:03] Lorden come on somebody now if any man
[58:07] have not the spirit of Christ he is none
[58:09] of his
[58:11] amen and if Christ be in you the body is
[58:14] dead L I want my body to be dead God
[58:17] said it's dead if Christ is in you the
[58:20] body in the eyes of God is
[58:23] dead because of sin
[58:26] but the spirit is life because of
[58:29] righteousness but if the spirit of him
[58:32] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[58:33] in you he that raised up Christ from the
[58:36] dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[58:40] body
[58:41] woo come on somebody amen let me move
[58:45] faster now amen so you can realize amen
[58:48] we must prepare for battle in time of
[58:55] peace
[58:57] Ephesians 21:18 says for
[59:02] through excuse me let's turn there
[59:05] Ephesians 21:18 that's the best way of
[59:06] doing it can't read no
[59:09] hand you love
[59:11] God
[59:16] 218 for through
[59:19] him we both have access by one Spirit
[59:24] unto the father
[59:26] now therefore ye are no more strangers
[59:28] and foreigners but fellow citizens with
[59:31] the Saints and of the household of God
[59:34] come
[59:35] on think about it think about
[59:39] that you're a fellow citizens of God in
[59:44] heaven not Rome or anything like
[59:50] it oh my I I really do I do I do I do I
[59:54] do amen
[59:59] amen just going to read off a few more
[1:00:01] scriptures then I'm going read the
[1:00:01] quotes and I'm going let you go 1
[1:00:03] Corinthians 16 says even as the
[1:00:06] testimony of Christ was confirmed in you
[1:00:10] it must be confirmed in you Hallelujah
[1:00:15] come on somebody amen it must be
[1:00:19] confirmed once it's confirmed the devil
[1:00:21] can't take it from
[1:00:24] you
[1:00:27] if Christ be in you I say it again the
[1:00:29] body is dead because of sin right amen
[1:00:32] listen what he says First Corinthians
[1:00:34] 3:16 know ye not that you are the temple
[1:00:36] of God and that the spirit of God
[1:00:38] dwelleth in
[1:00:40] you yes Lord have y'all oh my goodness 1
[1:00:44] Corinthians 6:19 what know you not that
[1:00:47] the B your body is the Temple of of the
[1:00:49] Holy Ghost which is in you which you
[1:00:52] have of God and you are not what your
[1:00:55] own
[1:00:56] amen hallelujah it is the spirit of God
[1:00:59] that unites us together it ain't this
[1:01:03] building it's not these
[1:01:05] chairs it's not the name Higher Ground
[1:01:09] it's the holy ghost that unites
[1:01:15] Uso preparing you un ning times is that
[1:01:19] right amen by one Spirit you were
[1:01:21] baptized into one body according to 1
[1:01:23] Corinthians 12:13 but let me read these
[1:01:25] quotes he says but if if you notice it
[1:01:28] was so beautifully Illustrated when the
[1:01:30] Great Pillar of Fire that followed the
[1:01:31] children of Israel through the
[1:01:32] Wilderness appeared to St Paul when it
[1:01:35] come down on the day of Pentecost it
[1:01:37] broke up and tongs of fire set upon each
[1:01:39] of them it was God in the pillar fire
[1:01:42] the loost separating himself among his
[1:01:45] people showing that Christ and the bride
[1:01:50] see see God and his church are becoming
[1:01:54] one why it's just the most beautiful
[1:01:57] thing you've ever seen then then
[1:02:00] together not in different organizations
[1:02:02] where we ever stand in a kuckian I'm a
[1:02:05] Kian to Together We Stand divide with
[1:02:08] fall why did the Indian lose the country
[1:02:10] to the white people it's because they
[1:02:12] wasn't they were divided among
[1:02:14] themselves how are we going to lose the
[1:02:16] great race it's because we're divided
[1:02:19] how we going to do it we've got to stay
[1:02:22] together we're all believers in God the
[1:02:25] holy Holy Ghost takes us all in it'll be
[1:02:29] a paradox if if God ever gets us
[1:02:33] together but he will amen just trust him
[1:02:37] the Virgin birth he knows how to send
[1:02:39] the
[1:02:43] persecution it's a shame it's a shame
[1:02:47] but he said he knows how to bring the
[1:02:49] persecution it'll run us
[1:02:53] together amen and it's coming coming you
[1:02:57] better believe it it's coming amen I
[1:02:59] won't have to worry about it as long you
[1:03:01] know as long as they let us have this
[1:03:02] place you won't have to worry about it
[1:03:04] will you you people will be showing up I
[1:03:06] think so now Pentecost was a paradox and
[1:03:10] how that God chose a bunch of illiterate
[1:03:12] fishermen that didn't even know their
[1:03:16] ABC they're told that Peter couldn't
[1:03:18] even sign his own name H the Bible said
[1:03:21] that he in John acts four was ignorant
[1:03:24] and unlearned but yet they had taken
[1:03:26] notice that they had been with Jesus now
[1:03:29] you know some Scholars are saying that
[1:03:31] that's not what God meant that Peter
[1:03:33] didn't he had his own business hello I
[1:03:36] know a lot of folks who couldn't read or
[1:03:38] write who had their own business now
[1:03:39] that's the main thing and how God chose
[1:03:42] now the church had trained up a bunch of
[1:03:45] men for that thousands of fine
[1:03:48] intellectual priests who know that word
[1:03:50] they said from all the meaning of it and
[1:03:53] everything studied it day and night just
[1:03:55] had it in in their hearts I can't help
[1:03:57] but to say it but let me say it God in
[1:04:00] our day rose up a seventh grade
[1:04:03] Kian
[1:04:05] confounded the people in his
[1:04:08] day with the scriptures confounded him
[1:04:12] and every time they challenged him you
[1:04:15] off the scriptures prove it to me right
[1:04:19] I think it was in Chicago when those men
[1:04:21] had then already set up what they were
[1:04:22] going to do brother bandam told him
[1:04:24] exactly where where they would be and he
[1:04:26] said if you don't believe the baptism in
[1:04:28] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he
[1:04:29] said come up here and stand
[1:04:31] right he said they knew they weren't
[1:04:33] going to stand CU he knew that angel was
[1:04:34] on his right hand side right they knew
[1:04:36] better than that he said well if you
[1:04:38] just stay off my
[1:04:40] back let me tell you something there
[1:04:43] ain't a the Theologian in this world
[1:04:45] that don't know the acts 238 is not
[1:04:49] right they know it but because of money
[1:04:52] pressure and
[1:04:54] Jesuits they won't do it but they know
[1:04:58] it because the Bible said they hold the
[1:05:00] truth in
[1:05:01] unrighteousness they know
[1:05:03] it they know it the Bible Way whether
[1:05:06] they reason it away or not God chose a
[1:05:08] bunch of men that didn't even know their
[1:05:10] how to sign their name that was a
[1:05:11] paradox from taking a man who was
[1:05:13] trained from the word for the word and
[1:05:15] by the word and take a man know nothing
[1:05:17] about the word and confirming the word
[1:05:19] through him that was a paradox certainly
[1:05:22] was and let me tell you something that's
[1:05:23] where he'll do it right now
[1:05:26] God ain't requiring us to know nothing
[1:05:28] but what he sent what he said and he
[1:05:32] he I gotta pause here I'm sorry I'm
[1:05:35] trying to finish it but think about it
[1:05:37] we've got Bible now a book
[1:05:43] Scrolls they didn't have
[1:05:46] that and how many years it took them all
[1:05:49] they could do is remember what he said
[1:05:52] and go back to the Old Testament and
[1:05:54] glean from it then God in a man by the
[1:05:56] name of Paul Paul goes out in the desert
[1:05:59] for three and A2 years and come back
[1:06:00] with some
[1:06:02] preaching huh and they listen to Paul
[1:06:05] because here come Paul taking all the
[1:06:06] Old Testament types and bringing it to
[1:06:08] him and then they say oh my good even
[1:06:10] some of those things that Paul said was
[1:06:11] hard to be understood but they didn't go
[1:06:13] to church and they could open up the
[1:06:15] Bible like we can they didn't have
[1:06:21] that what made them know what was right
[1:06:23] is when the Holy Ghost was in you
[1:06:26] it'll say Amen to the
[1:06:34] truth and they arguing over the Greek
[1:06:36] when my God became Greek out into the
[1:06:39] streets they went screaming listen let
[1:06:42] me pick it up he says listen that was a
[1:06:44] paradox certainly was it was a paradox
[1:06:46] how that them people up in the upper
[1:06:48] room there afraid of the Jews and had
[1:06:51] walked with Jesus he says listen but
[1:06:53] when the Holy Ghost came woo he said the
[1:06:57] Jews they were afraid those who was up
[1:06:59] in the upper room they were there cuz
[1:07:01] they were
[1:07:02] afraid he said but when the Holy Ghost
[1:07:05] came they wasn't afraid no more see and
[1:07:09] that's how it will be when the squeeze
[1:07:11] come amen Supreme Grace will be given us
[1:07:14] uh Supreme Grace Supreme faith will
[1:07:18] produce Su Supreme Grace in the Supreme
[1:07:22] hour right right and out into the
[1:07:26] streets they went screaming falling
[1:07:29] acting like a bun bunch of drunken PE
[1:07:31] drunk people that was a paradox the Holy
[1:07:34] Ghost Came Upon them women and all they
[1:07:36] wasn't ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus
[1:07:38] Christ it certainly was a
[1:07:40] paradox they wasn't uh naturally natural
[1:07:44] they wasn't natural horses they breathe
[1:07:47] fire talking about now is I'm I'm
[1:07:49] working with something else now so you
[1:07:51] got to understand now here they they got
[1:07:54] power and authority to uh overcome the
[1:07:57] world to do whatever uh God would have
[1:07:59] them but let me let me tell you
[1:08:01] something in our day so you'll
[1:08:03] understand and and and I'm maybe I'm I'm
[1:08:04] I'm too long here but but listen we are
[1:08:08] in for
[1:08:10] something I'm I'm working with faith
[1:08:13] because it's going to take Faith to get
[1:08:14] you through
[1:08:16] this brother BR talks about amen that
[1:08:19] these spiritual demons the old Roman

[1:13:23] Council of the world churches the spirit
[1:13:25] of antichrist let me tell you something
[1:13:27] the bride the Rapture would take place
[1:13:29] in between the bunding of the wheat
[1:13:31] bunding of the systems right just before
[1:13:34] he and the uh appearing of the
[1:13:36] Antichrist if you here and the
[1:13:38] Antichrist appear you've missed

[1:14:28] bride that's why you got to get the Holy
[1:14:30] Ghost that is the life of the blood a
