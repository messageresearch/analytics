[0:01] eighth verse but sin taking occasion by
[0:09] the commandment wrought in me all manner
[0:12] of concupiscence for without the law sin
[0:16] was dead for I was alive without the law
[0:21] once but when the commandment came sin
[0:25] revived and I died and the commandment
[0:30] which was ordained to life I found to be
[0:33] unto death for sin taking occasion by
[0:36] the commandment deceived me and by it
[0:39] slew me wherefore the law is holy and
[0:42] the commandment holy and just and good
[0:45] was then that which is good made death
[0:48] unto me god forbid but sin that it might
[0:53] appear sin working death in me by that
[0:57] which is good that sin by the
[1:00] commandment might become exceeding
[1:03] sinful for we know that the law is
[1:06] spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin
[1:11] for that which I do I allow not for what
[1:15] I would that I do I not but what I hate
[1:19] that I do that do i if then I do that
[1:24] which I would not I consent unto the law
[1:27] that it is good now then it is no more
[1:30] than I that do it but saying that
[1:32] dwelleth in me well I know that in me
[1:36] that is in my flesh dwelleth no good
[1:39] thing for to will is present with me but
[1:42] how to perform that which is good I find
[1:45] that for the good that I would I do not
[1:48] because evil which I would not that I do
[1:52] excuse me now if I do that I would not
[1:56] it is no more I that do it but sin that
[1:59] dwelleth in me I find in a law that when
[2:03] I would do good sin as II is present
[2:06] with me for I delight in the law of God
[2:10] after the law the inward man but I see
[2:13] another law
[2:15] and my member warring against the law of
[2:17] my mind and bringing me into captivity
[2:20] to the law of sin which is in my member
[2:23] Oh wretched man that I am Who Shall
[2:26] deliver me from the body of this death
[2:29] for I thank God through Jesus Christ our
[2:33] Lord so then with the mind I myself
[2:36] serve the law of God but with the flesh
[2:39] the law of sin let us pray
[2:45] father we thank you for your grace and
[2:46] your mercy we think you for being good
[2:49] to us Lord we pray this morning that you
[2:53] would give us grace move completely out
[2:55] of our let me move completely out of
[2:58] your way and let your perfect divine
[3:00] will be done here this morning and Jesus
[3:03] Christ's name we pray amen you may be
[3:06] seated thank you sir simple message kill
[3:20] the wheel there will die will be done in
[3:26] earth as it is in heaven
[3:28] my theme is kill the wheel when we talk
[3:32] about a wheel we we talk about that
[3:35] conscious part of us that makes
[3:41] decisions or make a deliberate action
[3:45] it's the power control of the mind that
[3:51] that is over all of your actions when we
[3:57] talk about the will would talk about
[3:59] power of choosing one's own action if
[4:03] that would make it clearer to you you
[4:07] can either have a strong wheel or you
[4:08] can have a weak will it is the act
[4:14] process of using or certain one's choice
[4:18] I really like that because we realized
[4:23] that when we were made God made us free
[4:26] more agencies in other words God gave us
[4:30] will and we understand Amen according to
[4:35] the prophet of God that's one of those
[4:38] things that God will never take from you
[4:41] we realized they meant one of the things
[4:44] that I saw within the scripture is that
[4:48] sometimes God will force you to make a
[4:52] decision he will make you a place you in
[4:57] a place where you will have to decide
[4:58] your will versus God's will when I was
[5:04] thinking about that I thought about
[5:06] Egypt there was a children of Israel
[5:09] there and they had to make a choice at
[5:13] the end of the day even though they were
[5:14] God's people they had to make a choice
[5:18] whether they wanted to remain as the
[5:21] Egyptians as remain in Egypt and be
[5:23] destroyed or whether they would want to
[5:25] go with God when Moses came and told
[5:28] them that you must put the blood on the
[5:31] doorpost and a lentil didn't matter amen
[5:35] on what their past history of DNA was
[5:40] God had brought forth the law through a
[5:42] prophet and that law had to be obeyed or
[5:45] either your firstborn was going to die
[5:49] so God forces us amen to a decision but
[5:54] he still makes it your will you can
[5:57] either refuse God or accept it when we
[6:01] come to circumcision we found out that
[6:04] circumcision among the Jews was very
[6:06] important every male child was supposed
[6:09] to be circumcised on the eighth day now
[6:13] you have a choice you can either
[6:15] circumcise or have your child
[6:17] circumcised on the eighth day or not but
[6:20] understand your decisions will always
[6:24] suffer consequences amen
[6:28] for we understand that that circumcision
[6:30] on the eighth day was a shadow and a
[6:32] type of house circumcision
[6:35] that's why perfect circumcision could
[6:38] not come in the seventh age it had to
[6:41] come on the eighth day we call that they
[6:46] are celebration Oh when we when we come
[6:50] to that decision we understand it's a
[6:54] holy convocation now we realize by God's
[6:57] grace that also when it came to Mount
[7:00] Carmel Elijah had a decision of the
[7:05] people had to make a decision whether
[7:08] they were going to stay with bail
[7:09] worship or whether they were going to
[7:11] follow Elijah God always forces your
[7:14] hand you can truly say I am a believer
[7:17] Lord I love you but God at some point
[7:20] time is going to make you make a
[7:22] decision we find out that even in Moses
[7:26] Moses when he was out in the wilderness
[7:27] and of course he had Dathan and Cora
[7:31] fighting him
[7:33] he's taking the word in which Moses had
[7:36] had preached and you know making their
[7:39] own revelation out of it and at a point
[7:42] in time Moses brought the people to a
[7:45] decision and he said who all is on the
[7:49] Lord's side you come over here we find
[7:52] out that there are many of them who
[7:54] decided to come to the Lord but at that
[7:56] time it was too late and the earth
[7:58] swallowed them up because they made a
[8:02] decision to follow bail and in worship I
[8:04] know God's when we talk about decisions
[8:08] often time we understand your will this
[8:12] is why you've got to be careful on what
[8:15] you choose to do because whatever your
[8:21] choice or your choices are they will
[8:24] suffer consequences even when it comes
[8:28] to marrying there's always your will
[8:32] there present your will to marry someone
[8:38] and it think about all of the
[8:41] do's and dont's you know now they've
[8:43] taken out will you love him during the
[8:47] time when he's rich or poor or better
[8:51] forwards or sickness and help oh yeah
[8:53] yeah yeah you know but understand those
[8:59] times are going to be tested those same
[9:01] words that you making in the season with
[9:05] and swearing to you got to understand
[9:08] that these things will have consequences
[9:11] God will try you and the reason why I
[9:15] brought all of this up is because now
[9:19] we're coming to a time where our will
[9:23] will make manifest right our will will
[9:29] make manifest whatever you choose to do
[9:32] you know brother Branham said it like
[9:34] this that God sealed us
[9:36] he wrote our names in the Lamb's Book of
[9:38] Life because of our decision our choice
[9:42] the choice that we made before the
[9:45] foundation of the world and if you made
[9:48] that decision then you would make it now
[9:55] when we talk about decisions you and I
[9:58] know that every decision that we make
[10:00] will progress us not degress us you
[10:05] understand me when we make decisions for
[10:07] God in our decision is aligned with
[10:10] God's will it will promote us it will
[10:16] make us go forward never backwards
[10:18] because God does not retreat and I'm
[10:24] taking it slowly now this morning
[10:25] because I really want everybody to
[10:27] understand this is so important to me
[10:29] that I can get this thing over to you
[10:32] because God showed me something and it's
[10:34] rabbi revelation and I don't know how to
[10:36] explain what I what I've seen but by
[10:40] God's grace I trusted if we could see
[10:43] the importance of your will it is
[10:46] something that children have we have to
[10:48] we have to guide them when they're young
[10:52] because sometimes being a child they
[10:54] don't know how to
[10:55] the right choice sometimes children look
[10:58] at flames of fire and they think it's
[11:00] all beautiful and they want to touch it
[11:02] but but and their will is to do so and
[11:04] then you say hey don't touch that that's
[11:06] hot right we're trying to teach them how
[11:09] to to make choices and and make them sis
[11:16] ibly and sometimes that child may think
[11:20] well mom don't know what they're talking
[11:21] about our daddy and but I'm gonna try
[11:23] this thing anyhow it right that's the
[11:26] way it works when you when you when you
[11:29] misplace God's will if you take God's
[11:31] will and place it beneath your own will
[11:34] God will allow you to do your thing if I
[11:37] could say it like that
[11:38] and you're going to suffer the
[11:40] consequences hallelujah is that okay
[11:45] understand in the beginning and I'm
[11:48] gonna go back to Lucifer because you got
[11:50] to understand that in the time of
[11:52] Lucifer Lucifer was the first of all
[11:55] angels to develop his old will before
[12:01] Lucifer's thoughts were manifest before
[12:04] God all of the angels in heaven obeyed
[12:08] the will of God we don't know what all
[12:11] they did we don't know what all God
[12:15] commanded them to do but we do know it
[12:18] was Lucifer who first thought within his
[12:21] heart outside of God's will I will
[12:28] ascend I will do this I will do that and
[12:33] remember whenever you choose to do
[12:37] anything outside of God I will be there
[12:44] your selfishness will manifest itself
[12:49] every time you make a decision outside
[12:53] of God's will that was the problem with
[12:58] Lucifer he was selfish he cared nothing
[13:03] about no one else then and he cares
[13:06] nothing about no one else
[13:09] when we talk about Amen Lucifer
[13:13] we understand him and he is the reason
[13:17] that we are in this condition now
[13:21] because what he did in the Garden of
[13:24] Eden he persuaded Eve that her will was
[13:29] more and then Tages for her than God's
[13:32] will and so what did she do she
[13:35] literally was seduced by the devil and
[13:40] understand you understand me every time
[13:43] you choose to do what you want to do you
[13:46] have been seduced that's the way it
[13:50] started out that's the way it will in
[13:53] and we find out Amen that what did the
[13:57] devil do what did he do People of God he
[14:00] took his own will and he brought it into
[14:03] humanity and then in his not creation
[14:11] but in his in his perversion he made man
[14:15] in a way that he would from that porn or
[14:20] battle with his will versus God's will
[14:24] is that right absolutely
[14:27] because here we find out that in the
[14:30] Garden of Eden there was Cain and there
[14:31] was able Abel was a son of Adam Cain was
[14:39] a son of the devil right and in that
[14:43] fallen state is still in Adams will
[14:49] transferred to his son was to do the
[14:53] will of God even in the fallen state but
[14:57] in that state we find out that Lucifer
[14:59] son who was Cain sought to do his own
[15:02] will even when God told him what to do
[15:08] he is your brother bring me a lamb but
[15:13] because in his own will he thought his
[15:16] will was greater you understand me
[15:19] and that's the way the devil deceives us
[15:21] he makes us think that what we're doing
[15:23] is the right thing to do when in reality
[15:26] is the wrong thing to do right now watch
[15:31] this because when Kay disobey God he was
[15:39] sealed with disobedience you understand
[15:46] me
[15:47] in other words his seed will never have
[15:50] the ability to obey mocked by the own
[15:57] kind King moxie
[16:00] that's where authorization in the
[16:01] nomination started that's right right
[16:04] there was the seed of denominationalism
[16:07] when it broke away from the word and
[16:09] decided to do its own thing and expect a
[16:13] God to accept it God didn't accept it
[16:16] then God will accept it now y'all
[16:19] understand me God does not accept your
[16:22] will brother I don't know who who sang
[16:24] was that you brother Frank who sang a
[16:26] song all right I enjoyed it
[16:28] amen and so that's what it is see what
[16:32] we say I got a dog
[16:33] it doesn't mean just dying is dying to
[16:35] your will because it is your will that
[16:38] makes this thing live hallelujah is that
[16:45] right Paul said I know I'm born again I
[16:48] got the Holy Spirit but I still got a
[16:50] will and there are times I will to do
[16:54] right I find myself doing wrong there's
[16:56] times I do wrong and I want to do I want
[16:59] I just decided to write he said I had to
[17:01] come to grips there's two things
[17:03] happening here there's a law of the
[17:05] fresh and there's a law of the Spirit
[17:09] which one I'm going to obey hallelujah
[17:13] that's it but you know in the midst of
[17:16] all of this I thank God for God's grace
[17:19] the Bible said by one man who was Adam
[17:22] by one man sin entered into the world
[17:24] and many of us was lost and by one man's
[17:29] disobedience we became sinners but God
[17:32] being a just God being a righteous God
[17:35] being a holy God wasn't going to judge
[17:38] you because of your condition huh is
[17:41] that right brother balancing that the
[17:45] sinner is that judge because he's a
[17:47] sinner he said it's only the Christian
[17:50] that is judged because he can't sin
[17:53] in other words God I'm gonna look at you
[17:56] said but you were peeing and you're
[17:58] wrong no you were born a pig that's the
[18:03] way brother and illustrated you're born
[18:05] a pig you're not going to be judged for
[18:06] that but when you've been transformed
[18:09] from a pig to a man and then you begin
[18:12] to do piggies things now you're gonna be
[18:15] judged but because your nature has
[18:20] changed is that Alright cheat the
[18:25] mystery of this whole thing and you know
[18:27] Paul says listen you know God has given
[18:30] me the understanding of what this fallen
[18:33] man thing is all about and he says that
[18:35] I had the mystery and I thought to
[18:39] myself I said see when God revealed to
[18:42] me the will I can't explain it but I was
[18:44] sitting there talking to her brother
[18:45] from South Carolina talking about the
[18:47] wheel and I said is that not right I
[18:49] said it's my wheel that has got me in
[18:52] the condition that I'm in now is that
[18:57] right remember even when it comes to the
[18:59] gospel the Bible said whosoever will let
[19:02] him come see it still goes back to your
[19:05] will because that's the way Lucifer
[19:08] started Lucifer fell because of his will
[19:11] his will was to no longer serve God his
[19:17] will was to do his own thing right and
[19:22] we're making sense now
[19:28] and there's a laws against you there's a
[19:31] greater law than all the laws and that
[19:33] is the law of Liberty which is Jesus
[19:35] Christ himself now think about this
[19:38] Lucifer thought within himself this is
[19:40] what I'm going to do and I think to
[19:41] myself how did he deceive 1/3 or 2/3 of
[19:45] the Angels when it was found in his
[19:48] heart you know what he did he preached
[19:50] it he preached to the heaven and guess
[19:55] what God set back and watched it
[19:58] don't you know God could have thought
[20:00] why why should I let this go on but no
[20:03] he had a purpose behind it he knew that
[20:07] a third of however mean it was people
[20:10] it's controversial but anyway it doesn't
[20:12] matter but for years we have demons
[20:14] we have fallen angels who listened to
[20:18] Lucifer and they are now in a state
[20:21] where they can never repent but they
[20:26] made the choice hello they made the
[20:32] choice to follow Lucifer and right now
[20:35] you make the choice every one of us make
[20:41] the choice on whether we're gonna serve
[20:44] God or serve the devil don't let the
[20:48] devil make fool your deceive you what
[20:50] this is what I want to do hallelujah oh
[20:53] no no no no if it hadn't been him there
[20:56] in the beginning you would not have
[20:58] wanted to do evil he brought evil into
[21:02] God's economy help me somebody listen
[21:07] what he says in Isaiah 14 it says for
[21:10] thou has said in thine heart I will
[21:12] ascend into heaven I will exalt my
[21:14] throne above the stars of God I will sit
[21:16] upon the Mount of the congregation in
[21:18] the sides and or not let me tell you all
[21:20] something there are so many people in
[21:22] this message who really think they got
[21:24] the Holy Ghost and they don't have it
[21:26] and there are those who have it but they
[21:30] stopped at a certain place in their
[21:33] lives and they can't go any further
[21:34] because of their will and
[21:39] you got a die right some of us feel that
[21:43] temperance oh we don't know how to beat
[21:45] em print some of us you know we quick to
[21:49] get angry we quick to get shouts we
[21:51] quick and you listen the Holy Ghost is a
[21:53] dove there's got to be a ceiling a
[21:57] complete statue of a perfect man we use
[22:03] or will be on Pentecost yes we are
[22:05] beyond Pentecost because Pentecost were
[22:08] babes they received the Holy Ghost
[22:11] but they were just babes hallelujah now
[22:15] we've got a message that brought by
[22:18] Malakoff all that's supposed to take us
[22:21] to a perfect love oh I got the quotes
[22:24] forward folks I've got the quotes but
[22:27] the problem is is our will I'm not
[22:30] saying you're not saved but we came to
[22:33] this message so that we can make a
[22:35] rapture it's up to you to be dolla Tory
[22:42] it's up to you to be slothful it's up to
[22:45] you you'd make those decisions not to
[22:47] study not to read not to pray you make
[22:50] those decisions God does not make those
[22:53] but every decision we make to be
[22:55] slothful every decision we make not to
[22:58] pray has consequences
[23:01] am I making myself clear
[23:03] we want to stay in the will of God
[23:07] listen I want you to understand your
[23:10] adversary is real hallelujah the Bible
[23:14] says in these last days men will be
[23:17] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[23:19] God hallelujah and exactly we think oh
[23:22] we got to be going to this football game
[23:23] it is bad that's not it those little
[23:26] things that you find pleasure in over
[23:28] God but thou has said in thine heart I
[23:32] will ascend into heaven I will exalt my
[23:34] throne above the stars of God I will sit
[23:36] also upon the Mount of the congregation
[23:38] in the sides of the North Sea God
[23:41] brought me here to produce or help
[23:44] produce a bride for the rapture I did
[23:47] not come here to be a church church
[23:49] preacher
[23:50] I didn't come for fame if I had
[23:52] the same I would have start state among
[23:54] the top ten or whatever they call them
[23:56] I'm not interested in that I'm not
[23:59] interested in in being wealthy I don't
[24:02] care about those things my interest
[24:05] wants is to make do whatever I can do
[24:08] with the message that God has brought
[24:10] right because remember brother Brent
[24:13] said we are messengers of the message we
[24:16] are preaching the same message he
[24:18] preached and people of God you and I
[24:21] must understand this is not just a chart
[24:23] for us to look at and admire it is a
[24:26] place we must become and only way we can
[24:31] get there is that like the brothers say
[24:34] we must die to our will you should die
[24:42] let me tell you something you think
[24:43] dying to yourself is easy leather have
[24:48] you ever seen an animal get hit by a car
[24:50] you see how they struggle and fight to
[24:53] live that's just what your flesh does
[24:56] the moment you make up your mind to died
[24:58] at Christ is the moment your flesh is
[25:00] going to cut up hallelujah
[25:04] you gonna see it rage and wanna do love
[25:07] what you used to do it was doing hmm
[25:12] that's when you know you on the right
[25:13] track that's when you know that you just
[25:18] took a knife and you stuck it right in
[25:20] the heart of your flesh don't go don't
[25:25] worry let the devil that kill the flesh
[25:28] kill that we lotta lujah so that Christ
[25:32] may live in you
[25:33] that's what Paul said Paul said does not
[25:36] I that little is Christ that lives in me
[25:38] you got to die thank you for being led
[25:42] by God listen he said I was upon
[25:45] the mount of the thought of the
[25:47] congregation in the sides of the North I
[25:49] will ascend above the heights of ever
[25:50] did not brother branham in Satan Eden
[25:53] said this scripture has been fulfilled
[25:56] everything that this devil said he is
[26:00] now far feeling he is the head of the
[26:04] church
[26:06] I didn't say right I said the church and
[26:10] how did he get there by selfishness he
[26:15] wanted to be listen his whole purpose
[26:18] which was to rule over God's people and
[26:23] I'm gonna tell you something right now
[26:24] y'all think that he's the devil the
[26:26] devil he's smart he's over his throw is
[26:30] over there in Rome hallelujah I'm gonna
[26:33] tell you something that ain't what he's
[26:35] fighting for
[26:36] he's fighting for the throne of your
[26:38] heart that's the throne he wants the
[26:44] same throne God is fighting for to get
[26:47] on he's fighting to get on your heart
[26:52] cuz he knows that if he can get your
[26:55] heart he's got you that's where your
[26:58] thoughts everything proceeded out of
[27:01] your heart and if he can keep your heart
[27:05] wicked you are a worshipper of the devil
[27:09] there's no easy way to say it either
[27:13] your heart is gonna be pure set afire by
[27:16] the Holy Ghost oh it's gonna be unclean
[27:19] by the devil right he was you just like
[27:25] God wanted you as a tabernacle he wants
[27:28] you as a tabernacle never came do
[27:32] nothing without a tabernacle is this
[27:39] okay I know this is a different kind of
[27:41] preaching this morning but I have to
[27:43] bring it this way because I'm trying to
[27:45] get you to see something you are now
[27:47] pushed to a place being forced to make a
[27:52] decision you will not be the same after
[27:56] this morning
[27:57] you're being forced to make a decision
[28:01] which way you going to go hallelujah
[28:07] see selfishness is when you devoted to
[28:10] or caring only for oneself and all
[28:16] all of us are guilty especially when we
[28:18] offense I want or where there get over
[28:21] it that's not the Bible way the Bible
[28:26] said if you offend your brother you go
[28:27] to your brother if you don't obey that
[28:31] you obeying the devil and there's for
[28:37] all of us where they gonna hurt my
[28:39] feelings
[28:40] that'll hurt your feelings you're the
[28:44] ones in prison and let me tell you
[28:49] something I always tell you and I'm
[28:51] gonna tell you again you've got to know
[28:52] who you are and I'm gonna tell you
[28:55] something no son the devil can ever
[28:57] defeat a son of God is that bold enough
[29:04] I've meant for it to be bold because I
[29:08] want us to realize people we out of the
[29:11] word I don't care it's not right for me
[29:13] to say for people of God God has
[29:16] ordained this little fellowship right
[29:18] here I don't believe God sent all of us
[29:21] here just to be a little Church I could
[29:25] have stayed in Lima some of y'all could
[29:26] have stayed wherever y'all were to do
[29:28] whatever y'all wanted to do but when God
[29:30] calls you and pull you together it's for
[29:33] a purpose it's not here I'm not I don't
[29:36] care how can I say it it's not that I
[29:38] don't care but my point is other message
[29:41] churches are gonna do what they're gonna
[29:43] do I'm not concerned with that because I
[29:47] know I've been commissioned to do
[29:48] something here they're gonna do it and
[29:52] at the end of the day we're all joined
[29:53] together but we must do what we've been
[29:56] called to do and God doesn't put you
[29:59] here like a light for you to hide it if
[30:04] we don't do nothing else in this
[30:06] community we ought to witness this
[30:08] message people God will hold us
[30:11] responsible this is okay you say oh no
[30:17] brother books I would never betray God I
[30:19] will always do his right I want you to
[30:23] know Lucifer saw God face-to-face if I
[30:26] could say it like that and betrayed him
[30:28] it's not okay
[30:30] Judis talk write to him face-to-face but
[30:33] Judas was not gonna follow the will of
[30:35] God he couldn't he was a born a serpent
[30:39] and so therefore he had to do what he
[30:42] had to do that's why Jesus said unto Him
[30:44] go do what you got to do think about all
[30:49] of the people that came in face to face
[30:51] with brother Branham saw the great
[30:53] miracles the signs the wonders they saw
[30:55] all of that and walked away they made a
[31:00] decision brother madam said there was
[31:02] over 400 preachers and pastors that were
[31:04] going to come down from our Chicago to
[31:07] get baptized he said they never showed
[31:10] up what happened to them they could not
[31:13] produce no more than what was in them
[31:15] and that's what happens when decisions
[31:20] are made you are you are now expressing
[31:23] what's on the inside come on somebody
[31:31] Ananias and Sapphira said well Lord I've
[31:34] been faithful let me tell you something
[31:35] hundred nine and brother Graham said
[31:36] they're coming another time where
[31:38] Ananias and the fire is coming we're
[31:40] gonna have that over before this this
[31:42] rapture takes place
[31:43] they're coming another time of Ananias
[31:45] and the fire and I'm like what did they
[31:47] do wrong what did Aaron eyes in the fire
[31:50] do wrong they allowed their will by
[31:55] their will and they didn't have to do it
[31:57] there was no pressure on them like the
[32:00] Apostle said why did you come in you
[32:01] lied to the Holy Ghost all you had to do
[32:04] you could have sold all your stuff and
[32:06] kept all your money nobody put any kind
[32:10] of pressure on you but what you did
[32:12] wrong is that you sold this amount and
[32:14] you reported that this amount is what
[32:16] you sold and that's all you had and you
[32:19] lie and guess what that was a death
[32:22] sentence
[32:26] what was it it was their own selfishness
[32:31] that got them into trouble and it was
[32:35] not even required it was not a mandate
[32:38] it wasn't something that God said you
[32:40] got to do it was there it was supposed
[32:41] to be in a free will offering
[32:44] y'all understand me that's how I will
[32:48] get in the way people I will is so
[32:50] simple it's just so if if you got to die
[32:54] Paul says listen I want you to
[32:56] understand I have to die daily this
[33:00] flesh lives every day and I have to kill
[33:03] the wheel of the flesh every day I'm at
[33:06] war with myself like brother Graham said
[33:08] your greatest enemy is you it's not the
[33:11] devil yo your will that you have to
[33:14] fight every day
[33:16] am I gonna stay with the word Oh am I
[33:18] going to just do what I want to do well
[33:23] I just don't even feel like coming to
[33:24] church today and the Bible says come
[33:26] together the more when you see that day
[33:27] approaching one thing I love about Jesus
[33:33] like I said he was the only one that
[33:35] could pull us out of this brother he was
[33:37] the only one that could pull us out of
[33:39] this we needed a man of xscape we needed
[33:41] a way of escape amen from our own
[33:45] wheel-like I was teaching this morning
[33:48] from first Peter where Christ said be ye
[33:50] holy for I am holy
[33:51] how you gonna be holy brother branham
[33:53] said the only way that you could be holy
[33:54] it's by the Holy Ghost
[33:56] there's no such thing as a holy mountain
[33:58] there's no such thing as a holy man
[33:59] there's no such thing as a holy church
[34:01] except the holy God is there and that's
[34:04] the only way you ever be holy
[34:06] you'll never get it by human effort and
[34:11] don't you know it balls down to your own
[34:14] will whether you receive it or not but
[34:18] the man who said God his desire is great
[34:21] far greater than yours to give you the
[34:23] Holy Ghost but he cannot give it to you
[34:26] if your will is not willing to die to
[34:30] everything you got a wheel to die no
[34:37] Lord is that right
[34:39] even when Christ was getting ready to do
[34:41] the great work he did for who you and I
[34:44] he had a will even though the word said
[34:48] he was going to do this this this this
[34:49] and this he still had a choice
[34:53] father I would to discuss for me but not
[34:56] my will
[34:56] but thine be done hallelujah Oh people
[35:01] I'm about ready to shout because I want
[35:03] you to understand amen I know now I know
[35:06] now that my progress in Christ is based
[35:11] upon whether I'm willing to die or not
[35:14] and that's yours if y'all want to see
[35:19] this church get on fire you want to see
[35:21] the power of the pillar of fire come
[35:23] through I don't see it I've seen it
[35:24] God knows I've seen it more than once so
[35:27] much I mean you've seen my way you
[35:29] weren't there and you weren't my eyes
[35:31] but I've seen the pillow fight
[35:34] I've seen the pillow cloud when I was in
[35:36] India dot yeah I saw the pillar cloud
[35:39] before I knew what it was but let me
[35:42] tell you something
[35:43] seeing that still don't make me
[35:46] heaven-bound
[35:47] Israel saw it build a fire pillar cloud
[35:50] millions of them died why they weren't
[35:54] willing to fall to the will of God and
[35:56] how brothers do I know that I'm in the
[35:59] will of God when you stop murmuring and
[36:01] complaining Oh knock knock somebody's at
[36:08] the door you this morning right see
[36:11] that's what I'm saying we could murmur
[36:13] and complain and we forget every
[36:15] decision that God makes for us it's
[36:17] right I was just reading something about
[36:20] 9/11 how certain people survived because
[36:24] certain things happen in their lives
[36:27] one lady missed the bus one lady
[36:31] high-heeled shoes to getting a herd of
[36:33] feet and she stopped and went into the
[36:35] store got some bandages to put on
[36:38] whether we're head rubbed together and
[36:40] because of that one man it was his turn
[36:44] to take his child amen to the nursery if
[36:49] all of these things had not happened
[36:52] every one of those persons would have
[36:54] died
[36:55] don't you understand the frustration
[36:57] they were going through I've got to be
[37:00] on time I got to be all the time this is
[37:02] why was I so stupid wearing these heels
[37:04] off you know
[37:09] and honey why couldn't you just you know
[37:11] I know it's my turn to take the baby but
[37:14] can you take the baby this morning no
[37:17] you see one said and we fail to see that
[37:21] if we just wait and watch god I can't
[37:26] tell you how many times I could remember
[37:28] the time there in Texas I was with
[37:30] brother McGarry David McGarry the pastor
[37:32] there and something happened we were
[37:34] late getting on the highway and as soon
[37:37] as we got to the highway we saw this car
[37:41] pile up had not we've been held or
[37:45] detained we would have been right in the
[37:48] midst of that instead of getting
[37:51] frustrated with God that's why the Bible
[37:53] said in our patience possess ye
[37:55] household things look like they're going
[37:58] bad but at the time God is not
[38:00] protecting you from something
[38:03] hallelujah it's the truth that's why we
[38:07] ought to say Lord not my will but thine
[38:09] be done because when God makes decisions
[38:12] from you for you you're the one that's
[38:15] going to benefit from he wants us to be
[38:19] happy in his decisions that's the
[38:22] problem Israel they weren't happy in
[38:24] God's decision God took them out in the
[38:27] wilderness and they didn't even realize
[38:28] why God took the man
[38:30] but the Bible finally says God brought
[38:32] them into the world of Mister to be
[38:33] tested you are brought to your disasters
[38:37] and your things that goes in your life
[38:38] the things that go hey why I see my God
[38:40] is on in control God is not eating the
[38:42] picture and here is God he's right there
[38:44] testing you trying you and what are you
[38:51] doing are we saying father not my waiver
[38:54] let 9 be done
[38:55] are we murmuring and complaining you're
[39:00] so funny because then after we find out
[39:02] we were wrong in our judgment and God is
[39:04] now blessed as we think Oh God is so
[39:06] good to me he's been trying to teach us
[39:10] that all along huh why am I having such
[39:14] a hard time you know what I'm saying
[39:16] because you had things in you that you
[39:19] didn't know was in there and God is now
[39:21] I'm making a fire bringing
[39:24] and instead of complaining you ought to
[39:27] say thank you Jesus I didn't know I was
[39:30] selfish I didn't know I was this I
[39:32] didn't know I was that oh but God take
[39:34] it from that's what God is looking for
[39:38] people that's going to do that I believe
[39:41] your leadership I know you have you are
[39:43] the leader right and maybe that's what
[39:45] Lucia was thinking the old God don't
[39:47] I've been sitting here all I've been
[39:48] doing all these yarns saying holy holy
[39:50] holy I don't know what he was thinking
[39:54] but one thing for certain when he made
[39:56] that decision to to a sin without God
[39:59] prove approval to a sin he messed up now
[40:04] y'all is that okay so you understand
[40:07] what I'm working with I'm working with
[40:08] kill the will come to the place where
[40:11] Jesus says Lord I know the pain is
[40:12] coming you know I just went through I'm
[40:15] and I'm here in the garden I'm praying
[40:17] Lord I know you know the bomber said he
[40:19] eats prayer was over him and it was so
[40:22] on fire and then that literally his
[40:24] sweat was like drops of blood do y'all
[40:27] think he was just saying a prayer our
[40:29] Father no no no he was really pressing
[40:32] he was really travailing cuz he knew
[40:35] this was the most important act of all
[40:39] the acts on earth this was the most
[40:42] important one this one will not only
[40:44] saved me but it was saved all of my that
[40:48] right
[40:49] remember I said on Wednesday night I
[40:51] said understand to the Jewish people to
[40:54] kill a man is to kill a universe why
[40:59] because of all of the seeds that's in
[41:01] him you just stopped hmm think about it
[41:07] think about one man Adam is the it is
[41:10] and one woman Eve is the reason for all
[41:13] of this numbers of people that have been
[41:18] born on the earth that we can't even
[41:20] number because I've chart don't even go
[41:22] that far people that came from a man and
[41:27] a woman one tree produce all of this
[41:33] think
[41:34] about it Brooklyn said when God created
[41:36] this earth he could eat it suns and
[41:37] moons and stars in world in the world in
[41:39] the world he said who told you you would
[41:41] be staying here
[41:45] this ain't the only place we gonna
[41:47] occupy when Cena's done way with now the
[41:50] corner william branham and you and i we
[41:54] look at this thing and it didn't he said
[41:55] he said now if you favorite a little I
[41:57] will give you I will make you ruler over
[42:00] ten cities ten cities think about it if
[42:11] all the redeemed had ten cities how are
[42:13] they gonna all sit on this earth just
[42:18] just just to give you thought or what
[42:20] the devil is trying to do you must make
[42:23] a decision is it not worth to suffer
[42:25] here now and make heaven like I was
[42:31] telling the book that the children this
[42:32] morning I said if you knew that the
[42:34] world was coming to an end and it was
[42:35] going to blow up with fire and
[42:37] everything else and there's a boat you
[42:38] can get on but you love this world so
[42:41] long so much but you don't know how long
[42:43] it's going to take before it blows up
[42:44] and you'd rather stay here or you rather
[42:46] go that's the choice you're making are
[42:51] you making a choice of death or life
[42:53] Lucifer made the choice of death I have
[42:57] indeed made the choice of death
[43:00] hallelujah what choice are you making
[43:03] it's about your own will whether we love
[43:05] this pleasure more than we love God in
[43:09] Satan will give you the amount of
[43:11] pleasure that you desire to have listen
[43:15] Deuteronomy 4:29 I'm not gonna be too
[43:17] much longer I didn't realize that
[43:19] discipline in this long but if thou but
[43:22] if from Vince now seek thou shall seek
[43:25] the Lord thy God thou shalt find him if
[43:28] thou seek him with all thy heart and
[43:31] with all thy soul when thou art in
[43:35] tribulation and all these things are
[43:39] come upon thee even in the latter days
[43:41] if I'll turn to the Lord thy God and
[43:44] shall be obedient unto his voice
[43:47] you turn to the Lord and be obedient to
[43:49] his voice now you said what are you
[43:51] saying brother words let me say it like
[43:53] this in the message what is the Holy
[43:56] Ghost brother Brennan tells the people
[43:58] about the Holy Ghost what it is and then
[44:01] he goes on and he says now tomorrow
[44:03] night we're gonna do this we're gonna
[44:04] tell you how to get it he says come
[44:07] prepared he says sanctify yourself he
[44:09] said get rid of all of the bad stuff
[44:11] you've been doing and thinking in this
[44:13] and then go listen to it he said you
[44:14] gotta clean yourself before you can
[44:16] approach God in order for God to fill
[44:18] you because God is not gonna feel
[44:20] unclean
[44:21] that's him and he says listen people be
[44:25] prepared because we gonna come here and
[44:27] we gotta pray all night if we ought to
[44:30] pray until Easter what whatever the
[44:32] holiday was he said we'll pray but you
[44:35] know what I heard in the prophets voice
[44:37] I heard desperation he's desperate for
[44:41] the people because first of all he
[44:43] starts off he says now this message the
[44:44] messages in which I'm gonna preach
[44:46] tonight is different from all the rest
[44:48] now I want you to understand people this
[44:51] man know that getting the Holy Ghost is
[44:53] a matter of life and death it ain't just
[44:57] believe in the message the devil
[44:59] believes the message that is nothing but
[45:04] a Baptist doctrine hello anything and
[45:09] anyone can dress right I mean come on
[45:12] how many y'all will especially the women
[45:14] let's say like this how many you all
[45:15] would have the faith to be dressed up
[45:17] like a Muslim and all those gods and
[45:26] this is just so funny because they got
[45:28] all of this and they got their eyes
[45:30] looking that's the most evil part right
[45:35] there right it's your eyes that causes
[45:43] your will to change it's what you see Oh
[45:48] y'all ready y'all say that in Scripture
[45:50] where the Bible says that II saw that
[45:57] the fruit was good
[46:00] ooh so you got to understand people of
[46:04] God you said well what do you mean I'm
[46:06] almost done people because I got to
[46:07] break it up anyway when we talk about
[46:09] pleasing the Father Jesus said I do
[46:15] everything I do I please the father
[46:17] whatever he wants me to do I please the
[46:19] father and you think as a man he wasn't
[46:22] tempted he was try
[46:23] think about it I read this little
[46:26] booklet a long time ago it talks about
[46:28] Jesus how he stayed with Mary Martha and
[46:31] Lazarus and them that they were really
[46:33] friends in it and everything else and
[46:35] and and and then when Larry got sick the
[46:38] call came to Jesus Lazarus is sick he
[46:41] hurt do you think if my best friend got
[46:43] sick I would not go see about him or
[46:46] close friend Jesus didn't have a house
[46:49] he stayed with Mary Martha and Lazarus
[46:52] according to history and we find out a
[46:55] man that that these people they know
[46:58] that was feeling okay why won't he come
[47:00] okay send another call to him tell him
[47:03] Amen that you know he's washed now eat
[47:06] this looking not looking good and yet
[47:08] Jesus couldn't why he couldn't do
[47:14] nothing except he saw the father doing
[47:17] it huh a little bit of time when his
[47:20] mama said Oh Mary says get Jesus
[47:24] whatever he say do do it and he filled
[47:26] up the water and the wine and all and he
[47:27] says woman what are you trying to do
[47:28] give me to do things before my time as
[47:33] his mother he'll beta but understand by
[47:36] God's grace it meant God had a season
[47:38] and he had a time to express himself and
[47:41] do you think that here Jesus was
[47:43] standing right there and he couldn't
[47:45] move until he got the word Lazarus is
[47:48] dead he says now I can go is that right
[47:54] is that not what brother Branham did too
[47:56] when it came to that little boy he went
[47:59] in there he had the seen the vision told
[48:00] a man what his wife looked like where
[48:03] they lived and everything else and what
[48:04] the little boy would be wearing and
[48:05] everything and how we'd have the milk
[48:07] around his mouth right and here God sent
[48:11] him there amen and he went before the
[48:12] vision and he
[48:14] pray for the boy instead of the baby
[48:16] getting better he got worse y'all do
[48:18] read our messages right the baby got
[48:20] worse Wow it wasn't that the baby wasn't
[48:23] to be here but the Prophet got ahead of
[48:25] the vision so now he had to wait four
[48:27] hours to the grandma came through the
[48:30] back door and she had to sit here and
[48:32] lean in and I had had to be here and
[48:33] then once everything was in his place he
[48:36] said just said the Lord see that that's
[48:39] what obedience is a waiting for the
[48:43] vision waiting for God to move when God
[48:45] moves in you move right that's the
[48:48] scripture the calls when the Ark people
[48:51] couldn't move into the ark move
[48:52] once the are true the people move so you
[48:54] understand its lead letting God lead us
[48:57] is letting God regardless I'm gonna give
[49:03] you one more illustration before I close
[49:05] on this session I don't know what David
[49:13] seemed or what he saw I know David did
[49:19] something he he killed a bear and they
[49:21] killed a lion and and David knew that he
[49:23] had no power within himself he was a boy
[49:25] he killed a lion and a bear so he
[49:28] contributed that to God and he knew it
[49:29] was God so he had a will and as it will
[49:36] was in in accordance to God's will when
[49:40] he saw Goliath bolstering and carrying
[49:42] on like that he went for it but
[49:45] brenell-- said how many y'all would have
[49:46] would fight a lion and he says I
[49:49] wouldn't unless God told me to do it no
[49:54] man in their right mind is going to
[49:56] charge a lion right so my point is you
[50:00] look at all these things and and you
[50:03] look at how God led David he followed
[50:05] him how did he feed him you know this is
[50:07] what the scripture scripture the Lord
[50:08] won't me up on when I awaken and the
[50:11] Lord spoke to my heart the Lord is my
[50:15] shepherd I shall not want
[50:17] and he made me incorporate this into my
[50:22] message because they
[50:26] it wrote that under the inspiration but
[50:30] what David was saying I'm a sheep I'm
[50:34] not smart enough to have my will
[50:36] wherever he lead me I'm going to follow
[50:39] and though I walk through the valley of
[50:42] the shadow of death higher yeah yeah I
[50:44] will feel no you and so we realized Amen
[50:49] that because he trusted in his leader
[50:51] hello trust in the Lord with all your
[50:54] heart and lean not to your own
[50:56] understanding acknowledge the Lord in
[51:00] all of your ways and he share what
[51:02] direct your path no you don't direct it
[51:05] he does it and so when we allow God God
[51:11] showed me the essence of that scripture
[51:13] this morning I'm like Lord I've never
[51:15] seen it like this before I've read it
[51:17] it's beautiful poetry I've seen a little
[51:19] something in a little bit and it says
[51:21] now the Oh rod and their staff they
[51:23] comfort me
[51:24] right that means when I feel a little
[51:27] discouraged instead of drawing up my own
[51:29] opinion about things I'm gonna get a
[51:31] word because it's gonna comfort me it's
[51:34] gonna keep me in line it's gonna keep my
[51:37] mind I don't have no other mind in the
[51:38] Shepherd's mine and whatever the
[51:40] scheppers want to do with me Lord let it
[51:42] be aren't we tired of our own decision
[51:47] getting us in trouble I am I don't know
[51:50] what to do I I I'm at a place right now
[51:52] I'm just I'm happy I'm sad I'm sad and
[51:55] I'm happy I've got all kinds emotions
[51:57] running through me right now but I
[52:00] surely appreciate the revelation of the
[52:02] word because I realized by God's grace
[52:05] you think about brother branham how he
[52:07] had to come under the same law had to
[52:10] teach him how to not have his own
[52:13] thoughts right he got spanked how many
[52:18] y'all know that yeah he did I think was
[52:21] Indian Africa one of the ones that ain't
[52:23] of the Lord told him not to go to and he
[52:25] went to the wrong road the one that he
[52:28] wasn't supposed to because of the
[52:29] preachers and that's when he caught that
[52:32] amoeba and he said I almost died because
[52:37] God was angry
[52:40] with me and also remember the time when
[52:43] he told God is that you owe me an
[52:45] explanation
[52:47] he said God separated himself from me a
[52:49] whole month until I finished pouting
[52:52] yeah you don't hear people talk about
[52:54] those things but let me tell you
[52:56] something he was a man and he had to
[52:57] learn his obedience too he said and then
[53:04] once I stopped pouting God told me why
[53:06] he took the girl anyhow he said if I had
[53:08] not powder God would have probably told
[53:10] me in the first place
[53:11] oh I got so much let me tell you
[53:15] something people of God it is best to
[53:18] kill your will everyday when you feel
[53:22] like you don't want to get up praying
[53:23] you pray God get me up to pray when you
[53:27] don't feel like fasting or something if
[53:29] God say fast fast let him know I'm not
[53:32] strong in this but if you can care of me
[53:35] I'll be okay whatever he wants you to do
[53:38] do it it's very very very very rewarding
[53:43] afterwards you love the Lord I'm telling
[53:47] you I know I'm happy today because that
[53:50] brother didn't know what I was going to
[53:52] preach no brother Frank didn't know and
[53:56] God knew and God gave me encouragement
[53:59] through his song same kind of song I
[54:06] surrender
[54:08] and let me tell you some people it is
[54:10] God's will to for us to prosper in the
[54:14] natural and the spiritual but he doesn't
[54:18] want us to love it love this stuff more
[54:23] than we love him he little or less Tana
[54:26] I've kept you awhile forgive me but I'm
[54:29] trying to get something out to you I'm
[54:31] trying to get you to see Amen that we
[54:34] need to check God on everything we do
[54:36] sometimes we go places we do things and
[54:39] we just because we feel like we want to
[54:41] do it and we never think about is it
[54:44] God's will for us to do it father
[54:49] God we come before your Lord as humbly
[54:53] as we know how
[54:57] I'm trying Lord only if I could show the
[55:01] people what you've shown me open that
[55:03] window for them that they can understand
[55:06] how powerful the will is and how it must
[55:10] die there is no choice Lord if they want
[55:14] to make heaven they must die today well
[55:18] if they want the fullness of your Holy
[55:20] Spirit they must die we need to hear
[55:25] Lord the same thing Jesus heard that you
[55:29] were pleased to dwell in us and father
[55:32] we need a testimony and everything the
[55:35] father's told me to do I have God help
[55:38] us now give us grace give us
[55:41] understanding Lord because we must come
[55:49] to that full statue of Christ help us
[55:52] now in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[55:55] I have know some of you I don't know
[55:58] whether some of you believe all that's
[55:59] been said we do have to come to make a
[56:02] rapture I've got a quote right here I
[56:04] guess I read it read it this evening
[56:06] we're in a different time we're being
[56:10] forced to make a decision we're forced a
[56:13] mentor to pay attention to what is
[56:15] written in the word for our character to
[56:20] to grow into what Christ warned us in
[56:22] guarding or listened out by the proverb
[56:24] and said it's don't only be a few it
[56:26] means believers it meant those who make
[56:29] a rapture it's going to be a few people
[56:32] and understand in the mark of the beast
[56:35] brother Branham said if you don't
[56:36] receive the mark of God you receive the
[56:38] mark of the beast you and I are forced
[56:41] to get more God and I don't know about
[56:45] you I love all of you but it's not one
[56:47] person in this place I wouldn't want to
[56:49] be left behind because of that you
[56:52] should feel the same way I love people
[56:56] of God I love my family night I wouldn't
[56:58] want them to be left behind because of
[57:00] me you understand
[57:02] and an in vice versa nobody to blame we
[57:09] can't do like law Adam did Adam the
[57:12] woman you gave me you know the woman the
[57:14] serpent you did but in in all if God
[57:18] really you narrowed it down deception or
[57:23] no deception you made the choice oh
[57:35] Jesus ah sorry
[57:39] oh you here I will love and trust
[57:57] he his prayers he owe to the my bliss a
[58:32] let's say it again I surrender ah
[58:51] all ah so that we can better understand
[59:07] all of the promises of God have been
[59:12] given to the elected of God and the
[59:16] elected of God those who are to make a
[59:18] rapture it's not if they're going to
[59:21] receive the Holy Ghost they receive it
[59:23] and they all come to a divine statue of
[59:29] love not if they do it is the promise of
[59:34] God but even so in the promise of God
[59:38] God works things according to his will
[59:44] for an example
[59:47] Jacob our love and Esau I hate and they
[59:53] both had to go through what they had to
[59:55] go through
[59:56] Jacob had to do what he had to do but he
[1:00:00] still was God's choice and at the end of
[1:00:03] the day God staged it - Jacob had to
[1:00:07] leave his father-in-law's house and go
[1:00:09] back home whether he wanted to or not he
[1:00:13] had to because that's where the promise
[1:00:15] was to be you understand me
[1:00:17] God forced his issue he got so
[1:00:20] comfortable over there with his
[1:00:21] father-in-law God is not so you've got
[1:00:23] to be over here but lord I gotta face
[1:00:25] Esau but what about your father-in-law
[1:00:27] he understand me and God forced the
[1:00:30] issue and made him go back home and now
[1:00:33] he realized now I'm in danger now
[1:00:36] because Esau is there and if I've got to
[1:00:40] have more than what I got this man he
[1:00:43] hates me and he's gonna kill me right
[1:00:46] and so he goes on and he comes to say
[1:00:49] there's only one solution to my problem
[1:00:53] prayer there's only one solution to your
[1:00:58] problem and that's prayer
[1:01:02] it is there you surrender and why do you
[1:01:06] think God said he wrestled with the
[1:01:08] angel because it didn't come easy and
[1:01:12] I'm gonna tell you something as anyone
[1:01:14] when in the natural who's had a baby
[1:01:16] those birth do not come easy you go
[1:01:19] through a lot of wracking pain before
[1:01:21] the birth comes you know God so just
[1:01:25] trying to get you to understand as long
[1:01:27] as we gonna take relaxing and think God
[1:01:29] gonna pull us through a hole to get us
[1:01:32] where we need to be brother I don't say
[1:01:33] that ain't gonna happen God ain't
[1:01:36] fooling you to no home or I'm
[1:01:39] predestinated and now you know yeah but
[1:01:42] because you predestinate it doesn't mean
[1:01:44] that you're gonna bypass any god's
[1:01:46] sufferings to get you there
[1:01:49] not my will but thine be done
[1:01:54] let us pray father God we come before
[1:01:58] your Lord as humbly as we know how we've
[1:02:01] heard your word Lord I know by your
[1:02:04] grace or Satan fought me with this
