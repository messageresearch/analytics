name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven amen not only here down to our rescue there is open bibles to the book of james chapter 5 verse 15. james chapter 5 verse 15 15 which are called by my name if they shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and i will forgive this and will heal their land he said i'm not a deaf god i'm not a god that is made by hands but i will hear and i will answer your prayer i will heal your land amen so speaking on god's hand of deliverance and when we when we read in the book of james is writing and he's telling us that effectual feminine prayer of the righteous man availeth much so prayer is a is a tool that god plays in the hands of man it is that channel that god made a provision for his children the people who are called by his name we know we are called by the name of god we are bro we are the bride of christ so our last name is the bride of christ we take the last name of our bridegroom of our husband amen by his name everyone knows prayer works in times of trouble everyone goes to prayer everyone gets religious when things when things go bad i remember the other time i was on a flight before the flight took off off the word prayer everyone was just up to the old business but then once the flight the plane was in the air we came in a storm and this was a little plane and there was a lot of turbulence when i looked around everyone was praying to god because everyone knew that we called on the name of god god can many times people forget to thank god when god answers their prayer people just want to rush to god for prayer because people know that prayer work amen but we know we're not supposed to go only to god when we need prayer when we need uh god to help us when we need god to save us because we know we have a relationship with god when you are praying it's just not a one-way communication you are just sending words but we know pray it's talking to god when you are right there in that channel when god speaks back to you you can get off from there knowing that i have a word from the lord i heard him speak to me so you can get off from there with confidence and you say god told me this because you were not just kneeling there mattering a lot of words but you know you had that relationship with god when you speak he hears you and when he speak you hear him too the prophet of god tells us this he says pray is not a perhaps prayer is a sincere thing prayer is talking to god pray is not just getting down shut your eyes and thinking about your washing or your work that you're doing and say lord help me and john me and he'll miss john's and so forth that's not prayer that's repeating some words but prayer is to come into an atmosphere where you realize that you are in the presence of god and you're moving into deep sincerity first it's a worship oh jehovah how i love you you see it then after the worship of prayer then you come with a sincere heart asking that's not what many people do many people just come to god lord help me this this this and that but prayer it is you have to have a relationship with god when you come to him you worship him lord i love you lord lord thank you for the things you have done for me he he loves worship because he's a god god is an object of worship he created you and me to worship him so when you come and kneel down in prayer he wants to hear that worship he loves it he is a jealous god he does not like you worshiping other things many times we worship our phones that's the first thing you look at before you when you wake up that's the last thing you look at before you go to bed you go you have replays you have a relationship with something else that's not god and god is something that you just send a lot of words and hoping that he will answer some time but no you gotta have that relationship with god and know that when you speak he hears when he speaks back to you you hear also it is not just kneeling down in prayer you can be in prayer whilst you're walking that's right amen you were just in that presence you are just sucking that atmosphere you are having that communication you you are open to hear what god is telling you so pray is not just saying words you can be right there just meditating you are sincere focused on god and god comes down and god can speak to you just bathing just soaking that atmosphere amen the disciples came to god and said they came to jesus and say lord teach us how to pray and he told them the lord's prayer which had all the components of praying there is a worshipping of god and the most important part that i liked is it says let it be on earth as it is in heaven he was not just talking about the physical earth but this earth that lord whatever your will is in heaven may it be on us this physical this physical body which is the earth so when we are praying we are not praying just for what we want but we are praying for god's will in our lives to say lord whatever plan you have for me in in heaven may you make it manifest in my life because whatever you have in earth may it be whatever you have in heaven let it be to me on on earth this uh physical earth like uh david said your word is established in the heavens whatever before anything happens it has to happen in heaven first before it happens on this earth so whatever you need whatever your plan is whatever god wants you to do he already has it established in heaven so when you come and pray you say lord whatever you've already established make it manifest in my life lord amen that's what we got to do when we come in prayer the prophet of god says get the fear away don't be scared that god's not going to answer your prayer that's right god's always answering prayer the works already finished and listen he is obligated he must do it he's got to do it to keep his word see notice it's a finished work he's obligated god he may not be touched with a lot of things but when you hold him onto his word he knows he's gonna make it come to pass so you know he says in his word if my people who are called by my name if you humble yourselves in prayer he says i will hear so when you do exactly that he is obligated by his own word he is tied down by his own word to come down and hear your prayer and he will come down to heal your land he will come to hear your harsh desire and he will be there to supply your need amen that's true we don't serve a poor god the bible says he will supply our needs according to his riches in glory so i know whatever i need he is able to do it the prophet of god says god is willing to bankrupt heaven just to make sure that your need comes to pass amen so i know god is rich and i don't i don't i don't have a need that god cannot fulfill i haven't all my needs he can fulfill it he is not going to have to to to to pluck off the pearl gates and sell them so he can supply your needs but if he has to do it he's got to do it because he's got to supply your need so i'm standing you stand there rest assured knowing that when you pray it is a done deal it is just a matter of time until god answers your prayer amen because he is obligated he must do it he's got to do it to keep his word now it's a finished work he has a god that has a reputation that he never fails he never failed before so he's not going to start today so i can stay rest assured knowing that he has done it before he has done it over and over again so he's going to do it for me he has done it for all those people who pray to him will humble themselves and pray how are you any different he is going to come through for you amen we read in the bible of esther who prayed when she was in a hot spot she knew that all the jews were supposed to be killed and she knew that there was only one way out that was fasting and praying and the power of her prayer turned a decree that was meant to kill her and all the jewish people but she said i'm fasting if i perish i perish i am going in to see the king before she went in to see the king she fasted went and wearing sackcloth and she was there fasting and praying because she knew that the god of abraham isaac and jacob is a god that he is prayer amen she was a praying girl she was a she was a praying because she knew what the word says so she knew that if we humble ourselves if we pray to god he is going to hear from heaven and he will answer our need it doesn't matter what haman had already orchestrated and brought so that they could die but the power of prayer turned around that decree and made the king to to to to go against his own law because the queen was not allowed to come in unless the king had summoned her but because of her prayer that prayer kept her all the way going to the king and offering her supplication to say we there is an enemy who wants us killed and that prayer protected her going to the king that same prayer turned may the king turn around the decree and get the enemy killed instead so when esther and all the jewish people the israelites when they came down to pray god heard their prayer he came and he turned it around the enemy that wanted to kill the jewish people the enemy that wanted to kill esther and mordecai he's the one who ended up being hun on his own gallows that's what the power of prayer was amen it sent the curse back to the sender whatever what he wanted to do to them it ended up happening to him so we know when we pray the curse whatever satan wants to do to us god is accumulating him he's waiting he's going to do the same thing to satan he's sending the curse back to satan amen all we just have to do is pray and know that god hears our prayer prophet god says god is not known by genealogy or by theology god is known by neology that's where god is known by you don't find god by studying books you find god on your knees that's where you find them it doesn't matter you may read the bible from from from from cover to cover but if you don't have that relationship with god you are wasting your time and you gather relationship by praying to god the other time someone was telling brother branham he's you know saying you don't know the word but he says yeah i may not know all the word but i know the author that's what matters because whenever you need the word the author is going to drop it right in your heart whenever you need it because you have that relationship because this is god in letter form john says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god so we know we are reading god expressed in the letter form so when we read the word and have that relationship we become invincible when you pray you know nothing can stand before you because you have the power you are standing on that solid ground that foundation of jesus amen of the word itself amen it is by neology not theology amen hallelujah we also read of a man we know hezekiah hezekiah he was a king and the israelites they were in trouble there's this king called sennacherib he wrote a letter and he says i am coming to destroy you and he put in evidence of all the kings that he had destroyed before and he sent to hezekiah says look at what we did to that king and this was not a lie this was something that had happened and a messenger came to king hezekiah and brought it to him and when hezekiah was looking at it that those were facts were saying remember that king we destroyed him that king we destroyed him that king we destroyed him and sanaka rip said you as well i'm coming to destroy you and that was a fact hezekiah he knew better he knew that there was only one way out he wasn't putting his trust in the army or himself but he knew that if i go to the temple and humble myself if i kneel down to prayer god from heaven he's gonna hear my prayer and he will answer it so he went with that letter to the temple and he set it down and he said lord listen to what this king is saying but now this king overcame these other kings because he had his trust in gods that they were made man-made gods gods that cannot hear and he had his trust in those gods when he did when he had these victories now hezekiah look this man did this with these uh gods that do not have that that are made by man gods that are that are made by wood that are made by carpenters but he said look my god is different we serve a living god a god who hears a god who is alive a god who he is a god who talks that's why he had that confidence when he went and laid that letter in the temple and says lord look at what this blasphemous man is saying he wants to come and destroy us but he knew he said lord i have my trust in you that's why god he says i have my covenant with my people he heard hezekiah's prayer and he listened and he came down and he destroyed sennacherib in his own country before he even camp they didn't even have to fight him but because hezekiah's prayer effectual fervent prayer reached god and god said i will answer your prayer and god gave it to him so that's what we got to do come to god whatever problem you have come lay it on the altar you don't have it doesn't have to be the fist this physical altar it can be the altar of your home whenever you have a problem lay it down before god say lord look what this men are saying look what these people are saying but i know you are a greater god you are a mighty god you are a conqueror god is able to hear your prayer god is able to come and deliver you from your situation if the doctor gives you a report in his and you don't like it you say lord look what being said right here saying i have demons in my body but i don't want it you go lay it down right before god god is able to change that report because he's a god who listens if the if the doctor gives you a report that says you're covet positive go bring it right to god and say lord he's saying it's positive but i want it negative god is able to turn it around and he can heal you if they say you have cancer they're giving you six months to live you just bring it to god lay it in front of god god is able to reverse it he is able to turn it around because he is a god who listens he is a god who he is prayer amen amen the prophet god says and when men and women quit looking at their sicknesses they quit looking at their diseases and started looking to what god said about it he'll take over all things are subject to jesus christ and all things are subject to you in prayer amen when you ask in his name and believe i'll read that again he says all subject all things are subject to jesus christ and all things are subject to you in prayer when you ask in his name and believe so when you kneel down to prayer you have that authority god has placed that authority that all things are subject to you whatever situation you are praying for whatever disease that's troubling you or whatever affliction that's coming after you it is subject to you in prayer so when you kneel down you commit that issue to god you know that that thing is subject to you you have power over it he says ask what you will in my name and it will be done that's right whatsoever things you desire when you pray just believe you receive it and you shall have it god said so it is in his word his word never fails so you know if he said i shall have it it means i shall have it because he says it in his word so let nothing stand in your way stop looking at things you're looking at here look at the unseen amen god said we could do it so so long god say that that's all that matters god said it i believe it that settles it so you stop looking at the symptoms or what your eyes are showing you or what your eyes are not showing you look at the unseen look at what god said in his word amen stop looking at what your sight is telling you or not telling you that is a lie that's a lying vanity amen god said heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass away so you stop looking what sight is telling you but you start looking at what faith is telling you faith does not look at anything else it just looks straight and focused on what god says amen amen look at those are the 12 spies when they were sent into canaan the other 10 came back saying we cannot do it because they were relying on their sight they forgot god's promises they forgot what god has said that you this land is yours because they were listening and uh they were they they they yielded themselves to what their sight was telling them and they lost their faith and they said we cannot do it but you see joshua in caliber was not looking at that they say it doesn't matter even if they are giants god's word has is able to give us that victory against those giants it does not matter whis the word of god says that land flowed with milk and honey that's why we have seen that milk and honey so whatever that's standing in in our way we're gonna go pass through it god is going to give us the victory because it is written his word so don't look at what your side is telling you what symptoms you have god is able to take you through it just look at the unseen and look at what god said you will do the prophet god also says he says now along this journey he promised to supply everything that we need says whatsoever you ask the father in my name that i will do whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe receive it you shall have it now now he gave us the strongest weapon that there is in all the world and that's prayer prayer is what changes things at some point he says prayer is more powerful than a hydrogen and atomic bomb prayer is the most powerful weapon there is in the world and god placed that weapon in your hands he plays it in my hands so nothing can stand before us prayer is what changes things hezekiah was told that you have 15 years to live he was given no he was told that you're about to die and then he said lord i know this is what you say but he went to god with a petition because he knew god had listened to him before and destroyed the enemy and now he sees another enemy is coming in his body this disease he says if you defeated that enemy you can't defeat this enemy again and he went to god in prayer and he said lord i need more time please heal my body and his prayer before the prophet was was already gone after the prophet said he he said he came and said that says the lord before he was gone god changed his mind and he told the prophet another word and tell him and say go tell him i give him 15 more years hezekiah's prayer changed the mind of god because he knelt down he prayed and god heard his prayer so whenever you were in need god is able to change his mind for you he's able to give your harsh desires the prophet of god says the christian doesn't realize what a force he has when he kneels on his knees before the almighty god in the name of jesus he doesn't realize that he doesn't realize what power that is if people could only realize what's given unto them that anything you ask for will be given if you can appropriate that faith to believe for it because god's word is true and i like this part he says now god's word will defeat satan anywhere anyplace and any time i'll repeat that again and now god's word will defeat satan anywhere anyplace anytime it doesn't matter where you are it doesn't matter where it is it doesn't matter what time it is so long you have the word of god in your hand satan cannot stand before you doesn't matter what force he sends your way god's word is able to defeat him anywhere any place anytime his word never fails so god this is the weapon that gave god gave into our hands so that we can overcome satan it's more powerful than the atomic bomb it's more powerful than the hydrogen bomb he says god is in his word so when we stand upon the word we know we are holding on to god himself because this is god in written form amen heaven and earth shall pass away but god's word will never pass away that's why we got to stand firm on the promises of god he has never failed and he is not going to start today he has never failed the sages of old so why is he going to start failing on you today he is not going to do that he is not a man that he should lie neither is he a son of man that he should repent whatever he says he stands on it and whatever he said has to come to pass it has to come to pass amen the prophet god also says he says i love this god he says that's the death stroke to satan when a man takes god at his word he says that'll kill satan every time that's right that's a death struck to satan when you take guarded his word when you stand upon that word it says that'll kill satan every time not sometimes no but every time you take god at his word that will kill satan that will stop him dead in his tracks he cannot do you no harm whatever he has devised against you it will not work he says that's the hardest heating that satan can get when a man will take god in his word yes sir that's all you have to do take god at his word and stand right there you know god is able to come through for you it is that solid ground that when you are standing on it no one can move you nothing can move you no sickness can move you no friend can move you no trial can move you when you are standing on that solid ground when satan comes in like a flood god always raises its standard against it amen you will float in that flood so when you are floating in that flight doesn't matter how high the the flood goes you are floating right on top you will never sink you will never drown amen so we know whatever flood satan brings our way we're gonna float right on top of it it will never drown us amen just like he did for noah was talking about how he told noah to build a gothel word you know the golfer hood is made uh it's made of a material that it's it's like a sponge it's it's uh it's porous it it sucks water so god told noah to build he told noah to build an ark using that golfer word but when he was making this golf away when he was making the ark using the golfer wood people were laughing at him like that's not even a material you can use to build to build a boat but noah wasn't looking at what people were saying he was looking at the word of god and he was standing flat footed on it and god told him to go boil the evergreen tree that had the sap in it so when he would boil this golfer wood in this sap it would suck this goth this hot this hot um evergreen tree sap and it would come in and it would strengthen and solidify this god forward so this god forward it was as light as light as can be but it was a strong steel it could not drown this was god's strategy a way out for noah he knew a flood was coming but that flood was not going to sink him the prophet of god tells us that there's a mystery of this ark that this god forward is us and when if we are able to lay in the presence of god and let god fill us so that we are so full of god we know that there is no flood that can drown us there is no storm that can destroy you when you are riding you know you have god inside of you you will float on every flood no storm can break you you will crash through each and every one of them because you are standing on the promises of god you are standing flat-footed he will never fail whatever god says amen he says there is a promise that says many are the afflictions of the righteous but god delivers out of them all amen that is a promise but it's in two parts it says many other afflictions of the righteous but it doesn't end right there it says but god delivers them out of them all so all the afflictions that's going to come away they use a promise that you are going to get out of them they use a promise that you're going to overcome them and that is the word of god it never fails amen so there is a deliverance that is promised for you there is a deliverance that that is set aside for each and every trial that's coming your way because before the problem was there god already made the solution he knew you needed a way out so he already said there so whatever affliction it is from all different walks in of life when it comes your way you know that god wants to deliver you out of them all amen nothing can stand in your way when you know you are standing on the promises of god and you know with prayer you have that invincible weapon satan cannot do you no harm satan cannot move you satan cannot shake you amen and we know many tests are going to come away many afflictions many trials are going to come away but they are not going to sink us they are not going to drown us the prophet of god says he was talking about job he says and the devil was turned loose on him and he began to kill his children destroy his goods and he had some of his church members come to him and say oh you are a sacred sinner you've got something in your heart that you haven't confessed job but job know that he hadn't done it he was sure that he had met god's requirements and he stood pat on it so so long hair fulfilled god's requirements and you are standing flat-footed on the word of god it doesn't matter what comes your way doesn't matter whatever trial god allows to come your way you know god already has made a way out he says but job no he hadn't done it he knowed he had confessed his sins called for god to try him search him and see if there was anything wrong god was waiting to see what job will do because satan said i'll make him i'll make him curse you to your face so you see when job was going through his trial god allowed satan to do it god had confidence in job so when a trial comes your way you know god is already ordained because satan is not allowed to touch you unless god says go ahead and do it and when that trial comes your way god already has confidence in you that you will come out of it because he himself is the one who's gonna deliver you out of it so there is no need for you to worry there is no need for you to be dismayed whenever you're going through that test you know that god is there for you so you may feel forsaken when trial comes your way and it may seem that god has forsaken you but he is waiting for you to hold on the prophet said god was waiting to see what job will do so god is waiting to see what are you gonna do in that trial he's waiting for you to see are you gonna give up or you're gonna keep on holding on to the word waiting for him to come and deliver you as he said in his word he will hey man because you all you have to do is just stand still right there on his word god will come through and deliver you many times when we fail or god is tasting or testing our patients we start looking for alternatives you start looking at your horoscope what does my zodiac sign about me because you are giving up on the word you stop doing that just look at what god says about you you're going to look up oh what does um i i am an aquarius what what does the internet say about about me this day and you're looking for a lucky charm just focus on god just stand on the word of god god is waiting to see what you're gonna do he is just waiting for you to be patient and keep on holding on there is a deliverance that is set for you your deliverance has a date on it he is coming to deliver you amen so don't lose your focus you're going to start putting your trust in people and not in god when things start going wrong but god does not want you to do that because god is a jealousy god when people help you you're gonna start accrediting your deliverance to people and god does not want you to do that so the moment you start losing your hold on your word and you are starting to put your your trust in people know that you are headed off the wrong way but you come back focus on the word of god you stand right there because god is just waiting to see what you will do he is testing your patience he will always come right on time he might be four days late it might seem four days late to you but he is four days on time amen he knows what he is doing amen so when you feel forsaken don't worry about it know that he's right besides you he said i will be with you even in you till the end of the world so i don't have to worry because i know he is with me he is in me so it doesn't matter what things i face god is always there to pull me out amen amen i was reading this poem the footprints on the stand of time this man was saying lord you said you will be with me you would be with me so when i were walking in the sands of time there were two sets of footprints but there is a time when there was one set of footprints where were you he was asking he thought lord that's when i was having difficult times i was just seeing two set of just one set of footprints where had you gone the guy says you know what when you saw that one set of footprint that was me carrying you that's not your footprints that was my footprint carrying you because he never failed he said i will be with you till the end of the world whatever you go through you know that god is right beside you if he is not beside you know that he is carrying you so you will go through each and every trial you go through each and every affliction amen because he is compassionate about you god knows each and every feeling you go through there is no feeling that he doesn't know he wants felt forsaken too he once felt god has had forsaken him when he said my god my god why has thou forsaken me this is the first time in the bible where you see jesus he felt like god had forsaken him he felt like god had turned his back on him but he knew just to stand on the promise of god jesus had that option to decide not to go to calvary he had an option to not have that feeling to feel like god had forsaken him but he decided to go all the way with god's word because he knew that god's word never fails and through that feeling of being forsaken that's where he got victory through going through all the way with feeling being forsaken that's where he was able to get your salvation that's where he was able to get your healing because he decided to stand on that word of god on the promises of god he was able to rise victorious he was able to overcome death hell and the grave he was able to overcome satan because he decided to go through all the way he decided he allowed and accepted to go through all the pain because through all that pain he saw the price that was right at the end he saw you he saw me you were right at the end of that pain at the end of those lashes he saw you right there and he says i am going through it so he decided he stood on the word of god so when your trial is coming your way don't look in the trial look at the end of the trial god has a prize at the end for you when you are sick don't look in your sickness there is a testimony right at the end of the end of your trial you are going to be able to say god was carrying me through there was not anything else that was not my doing that was not luck that was not a doctor but that was god only who did it so you have to be patient stand on the word prophet god said god is just waiting to see what you will do so you just stand flat-footed on the promises of god god is able to come through for you amen because they're going to come a time where it seems like your prayers are unanswered you pray seems like nothing is happening at all you say lord i want to be healed you are just sick you are praying for your loved one you're praying for your daughter your son your your brother your sister but it seems like nothing is happening it seems like god is not answering your prayer god he is just testing your patience he wants to see what you will do you know i just thought about lazarus the other time he was a poor man and we know lazarus he was a beggar at the rich man stable and he had the word that says what david says i have never seen the righteous begging for bread but he was right there begging for bread what a trial was that he is right there begging for bread and he's saying he's a righteous man he was going to the synagogue every day i bet people from the church were saying you are a secret sinner because that word is not applying to you but he kept on standing on the word of god i believe he remembered what job said even though he slayed me yet i will still serve him he just stood right there because he knew that the price at the end he was going to be in father abraham's bosom so it doesn't matter when god seems like he's not answering your prayer just be patient stay right there god wants to see what you were going to do so just stand right there and see the salvation of god amen at the end of your patience at the end of your trial there is a prize for you him and so he never lazarus never stopped standing on the word of god although he was right that he's poor he's begging for bread but he still stood right there amen it takes a special revelation for you to keep on standing like that it takes a special revelation for you to be like abraham and wait for 25 years whilst you're waiting on the promise but despite all that abraham stood still on the promise he knew that god never fails he had god say it with his own mouth and he heard it with his own ear so he knew that he was going to have isaac through sarah he did not want he did not want to have a child with haga although sarah forced him to he knew that the promise was going to come through sarah that why that's why he was standing on the promise of god it doesn't matter how old he was that word was going to change him and and condition him condition him to be able to receive that promise that word was responsible to rejuvenate him to make him younger that word was responsible to to change sarah so that they're able to receive the promise because when god promises his promise has to come to pass it has to happen it's just a matter of time you just gotta wait wait on the promises of god stand on that unshakable foundation solid word of god god will always come through for you the prophet of god says maybe your healing might linger a little bit god's got confidence in you that you will hold on if you believe that the holy spirit signs and wonders he promised then accept it and just hold on to god's requirements amen he says i'm the lord who heals all thy diseases it doesn't matter how long it might take i know i will be healed it doesn't matter what affliction it is i know he's going to deliver me out of it amen why because god said it and i believe it that settles it amen amen the bible says weeping may endure for a season but joy comes in the morning you don't know how long your night may be but so long day is a night it means that there is a morning coming abraham had a night that lasted for 25 years but after those 25 years his morning came and joy came just as sure as you held onto the promises of god amen so just as sure as you are seated right there whatever night it is know that joy is coming in the morning as soon as the night is finished and the day breaks and the sun rises your troubles will be finished god will wipe away your tears and he will stand upon his promise joy is coming your way you may be sick for a night but healing is coming in the morning joy comes in the morning you don't know how long your night is gonna be just keep on holding onto the word of god he will never fail you amen you may be depressed for a night but you know that relief is coming in at the rising of the sun your deliverance is coming it's on its way amen amen you might be fighting for a battle throughout the whole night however long that night is but you know joy comes in the morning deliverance victory is coming at the end of the night at the end of your fighting joy comes in the morning amen your deliverance has a predestinated effective date that it has on it so you know however long it is when that date comes it has no option things have to change things have to happen the children of israel were in bondage for 430 years but there was a promise that at the end of those years there was deliverance that was coming so it doesn't matter how pharaoh hardened his heart or whatever he did because their deliverance had a date signed on it it was going to come to pass you know at that time pharaoh's army it was the super pharaoh was the superpower they had the best army in the world but that could not stop god's deliverance because it had a date on it it had to happen no one can stop god's deliverance when it is coming your way no affliction can stop god's deliverance when it's coming your way no disease can stop god's deliverance when he comes your way no sin can stop god's deliverance when he comes your way amen pharaoh could not stop it his strong army could not do it they tried to rush after them to try and give them back put them back in bondage but whomever the son has set free is free indeed when god sets you free you cannot go back in bondage amen pharaoh tried to go against them he tried to rush and and take them back in bondage but their deliverance was already set and god has said you are free you are a delivered people so that was not going to stop god his whole army was it was obliterated it was it was it was all destroyed because they were trying to stop god's deliverance amen no one can stop you when you are standing on the word of god when you are standing on the promises of god nothing can stand in the way in your way even satan with his whole host they can try and come and stop you but that can never stop god's deliverance when he says i am coming to deliver you out of it you know you are coming out of it nothing can pull you back amen god he is the shepherd who lives the 99 to come for that one because he knows your worth the prophet of god tells the one soul is worth more than it ten thousand worlds so god is going to come for you he's willing to leave the other 99 to come and deliver you so he knows your worth he is coming to you he said he said father all those you have given to me i have lost none of them so he is not going to lose you whatever you go into whatever you go through god is going to come and deliver you doesn't matter the tormentor whatever barriers he can try to put around you god's deliverance has a date on it you are coming out of it amen god's purpose to utterly destroy pharaoh's army because he was trying to stop god's deliverance it doesn't matter what stands in your way between you and your deliverance so long god say that you will come through out of it god will deliver you amen amen he had he had the whole army go and stand in the middle of he waited until they were in the middle of the red sea and then angels came and they took off all the wheels from the chariots of pharaoh's army and then right there he destroyed all of them because god he was just proving his word that whatever i say has to come to pass i said you will be delivered in 400 years time is up it is you to get out nothing can stand in your way amen this was what god was doing all he was doing he was coming to deliver his own he was they had been praying for over 400 years and god heard their prayer he was coming to deliver his own people amen you are worth a lot of value don't let no one try to down trade you and say you are worth nothing you are royalty you are god's seed when royalty gets lost or royalty gets in trouble the king comes with his own army nothing is going to stand before him amen so he is going to come you better tell your oppressor that you have come for the wrong one you have messed with the wrong one because when god is coming nothing can stop him he goes all the way until he sets you into your deliverance amen you are worth a lot of value god has angels encompassing around you a host of angels that is protecting you that is how important you are because god wants you to be delivered amen you are his royal seed he chose you before the foundation of the world so he has angels those that fear the lord angels incompete around them someone said uh brother abraham says someone said to me many times said aren't you afraid brother branham when you go or there at nighttime that maybe that angel of the lord might leave you sometime i said i'm sure he won't because he promised me he wouldn't do it i've got faith in god to believe that he will meet that requirement if he said those that fear the lord angels encompass around them angels are encompa encamping around you so you know you have the protection look at elisha and gihazi god had angels more than a whole army protecting two people because he cares for his own he pro he was giving them deliverance because this this army was coming they were not coming to to play games with elijah they were coming to destroy him because they knew that he has been the reason why they've been losing battles all this time so god had a whole host of heaven in camping around his children these angels were more than the army of the assyrians so god has angels around you i read this other one called that a light he says brother branham said god is anxious to deliver you and i when i i know what anxious means i know what anxious means but i went back to the dictionary to look it up it says yeah god is anxious to deliver me anxious he's extremely uneasy you know he's jitter he's antsy he cannot wait he is under that anticipation you know he is imp you know when you're anxious you're you're you're impatient for something to happen that's the feeling that god has when you are in trouble god is anxious to come and deliver you so nothing will stop you amen keep on holding on deliverance is on its way the bible says he is our protection so he will protect you at all costs amen and the bible says he is he is our city of refuge so whenever you are in trouble when you are running away from your enemy you run to god he's the city of refuge he is going to protect you now look when you're running to the city of refuge it's not you're running because you're right you're running because you have committed a crime but despite you committing a crime god is going to protect you he's going to say come on in and the enemy cannot touch you what you have done wrong he's going to say he is justified he has never done it in the first place amen he is our city of refuge so whenever you have done something wrong you run to god and say lord i'm sorry he's going to hide you and he'll say you cannot touch him the enemy says but he lied to me while he did not do it in the first place but he stole this from me god is going to say but he did not do it in the first place amen because you are justified doesn't matter whatever crime you have committed there is that city of refuge you run that god has protection for you amen he is going to tell the enemy that get away leave him alone he never done it in the first place you were coming after the wrong one he never do it you cannot touch him because he is covered by my blood so you are covered by jesus blood no one can touch you satan cannot touch you amen so he is our city of refuge bible says he is our strong tower he is our fortress a fortress is it's like a it's almost like an army base you know it's built around you cannot break into it so when god says i am your fortress you know he is surrounding you he is around you no one nothing can harm you nothing can break into where you are because he is surrounding you he has got you kept he has got you safe in his arms david so many times he said he is my hiding place whenever the enemy comes in after you god is there to hide you he says he is my hiding place you are my hiding place you keep me from trouble you surround me with songs of deliverance amen god is there to hide you when you're running away from your enemy amen let's stand up on our feet amen he is our protection he is our city of refuge amen he is our strong tower you are my hiding place in sea he is our protection city of refuge he is our strong tower he is our fortress he is our hiding place amen you see whilst i was starting i came across i just thought how does the mosquito repellent work so i thought a mosquito repellent you know it repels it chases away the mosquitoes i thought maybe it has a fall foul smell that when the mosquitoes smell that uh that smell they'll run away from it but it doesn't work like it and i went further to read to see how it works so the way the mosquito repellent works it it confuses and interferes with the receptors of a mosquito so a mosquito has sensors or receptors that's looking for you so it's coming to to try and sense sense sense your body heat and try to sense that um that carbon dioxide that you're releasing off but what the mosquito repellent does it goes and it confuses those antennas and the mosquito cannot find you it says the receptors are used to detect body heat and carbon dioxide that's released by your skin when those mosquitoes are searching for prey but these receptors are confused and they cannot find you you are hidden the mosquito can fly right by you but it's not going to find you because you are hidden its receptors are confused so when god hides you satan cannot find you he is coming after you but he will come right by you but he cannot find you one singer said praise will confuse the enemy so satan will not find you sickness will try to come after you but it will not find you why because jesus is our hiding place he is hiding you amen whatever afflictions trials that are not predestinated to come for you they are not going to find you because god is hiding you satan will not find you amen hallelujah you know satan is like a roaring lion looking for whom he might devour but he cannot find you because the blood of jesus christ is covering you amen just about two weeks ago kovi tried to find me but it could not find me because i was covered by the blood i was even healed before i even knew i had covered because god was hiding me jesus was hiding me and i came out of it saying satan you are a liar you cannot touch me because the blood of jesus got me covered i'm looking many people in here they had called with satan was trying to come after you but he could not find you because jesus was hiding you in his in the cleft of the rock that's where you hide god is anxious to have you delivered god is anxious for you to come out of your affliction and he will deliver you because that's what he said in his word all you got to do just stand flat-footed and you know he will come for you amen you are my eye and please you are filled with songs of deliverance whenever i am afraid i will trust in you i will trust in you let the weak see i am strong in the

secret place there is a special place that's meant for you right so you do not have to worry just stand firm on the promises of god he will take you out of it despite whatever affliction it is he is going to deliver you amen he will hide you in his presence satan will not find you whatever trial that's not meant for you it will not affect you whatever disease that will try to find you that's not predestinated for you to fight it will not find you whatever try or whatever affliction it will miss you because god is hiding you he is our deliverance amen let's just sing one this song one more
