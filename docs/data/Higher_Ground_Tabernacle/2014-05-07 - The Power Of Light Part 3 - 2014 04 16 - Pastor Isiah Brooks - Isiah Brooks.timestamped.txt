[0:00] amen amen we're not going to prolong the
[0:02] time we're just going to get right into
[0:03] the word of God surely God is good to
[0:07] us and uh we just thank him
[0:11] for being who he
[0:14] is we we owe so much to him
[0:20] anden we could never repay him amen for
[0:25] all that he has done for
[0:27] us and uh I I am so
[0:32] grateful we are
[0:36] approaching uh the celebration of his
[0:40] resurrection even though we celebrate
[0:43] him every day amen but uh I I thank God
[0:48] because God has given us a
[0:53] understanding
[0:54] of what the resurrection is all
[0:58] about and so so we really appreciate the
[1:01] Lord Jesus
[1:03] for being so good to
[1:07] us amen as we turn to the scripture
[1:10] according to First
[1:12] John we would we've been dealing with
[1:15] let there be light and the power of
[1:16] light of course this subject is
[1:19] eternal uh we could we could uh spend
[1:22] forever preaching on it starting from
[1:25] Genesis all the way to
[1:27] Revelation because God is life light am
[1:31] and uh whichever way you would take it
[1:35] uh there's always a scripture for
[1:37] it uh because he's above
[1:41] all through all and in you all amen
[1:46] there is no way of getting around
[1:50] God first John the first
[1:54] chapter we're going to begin
[2:00] with the first
[2:01] verse that which was from the
[2:05] beginning which we have
[2:07] heard which we have seen with our
[2:11] eyes which we have looked
[2:13] upon and our hands have handled of the
[2:17] word of life these are not like Words
[2:20] these are this is to me is powerful it's
[2:24] such a powerful Revelation that
[2:28] John is is it's speaking of it's really
[2:31] really deep it don't just take it
[2:33] surface value it's it's deeper than that
[2:37] for the life was
[2:39] manifested we have seen iten and bear
[2:43] witness and show unto you that eternal
[2:46] life which was with the father and was
[2:49] manifested unto us amen can't you feel
[2:53] this
[2:54] appreciation that which we have seen and
[2:56] heard declare we unto you
[3:00] that ye Also may have fellowship with us
[3:03] and truly our fellowship is with the
[3:06] father and with his son Jesus Christ
[3:10] amen these things write we unto you that
[3:14] your joy may be full
[3:18] amen this then is the
[3:21] message which we have heard of him and
[3:25] declared unto you that God is light
[3:30] and in him is no Darkness at all amen if
[3:36] we say we have fellowship with him and
[3:39] walk in darkness we lie and do not the
[3:44] truth but if we walk in the light as he
[3:48] is in the light we have Fellowship one
[3:52] with another and the blood of Jesus
[3:55] Christ his son cleanses us from all sin
[4:00] in I read that seventh verse again but
[4:03] if we walk in the light as he is in the
[4:07] light we have Fellowship one with
[4:10] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[4:13] his son cleanses us from all sin is that
[4:19] all right amen Philippians 2
[4:27] please Philippians
[4:35] to beginning at the 13th
[4:38] verse for it is God who worketh in you
[4:42] both to Will and to do of his good
[4:46] pleasure do all things without
[4:50] murmuring and
[4:52] disputing that you may be blameless and
[4:57] harmless the sons of God without
[5:00] reuke in the midst of a crooked and
[5:05] perverse
[5:06] Nation among whom you shine as
[5:10] lights in the world let us pray Heavenly
[5:15] Father God we thank you for your grace
[5:18] and your mercy we thank you for your
[5:21] love divine and everything that you have
[5:24] done for us we pray here this evening
[5:28] that you would be be merciful to us and
[5:31] Lord we know you will because your mercy
[5:35] endureth forever and they are renewed
[5:39] every morning great is thy
[5:43] faithfulness Lord we pray that you would
[5:45] just move and continue to move in our
[5:48] lives as we give you honor and praise in
[5:53] Jesus Christ name we pray amen you may
[5:55] be seated
[6:00] as we have said many times that God is
[6:07] uh he's light Prophet God tells us how
[6:12] that when it comes
[6:15] to uh God he is
[6:18] known uh in light and in
[6:23] fire but I want to kind of bring
[6:25] something to you this evening because I
[6:28] read Philippians 2
[6:31] 15 basically because it brings out the
[6:35] kind of a Nation we're dealing
[6:39] with when we talk about people who are
[6:44] unconverted we realize the scripture
[6:46] calls them crooked and
[6:50] perverse I don't care who it
[6:53] is there is no way that a man who is not
[6:56] born
[6:57] again there is no possible possible way
[7:00] for him to walk completely
[7:03] straight because the nature that is
[7:05] within
[7:06] him can never be straight
[7:09] amen the only way that we can walk in
[7:13] this last day properly before God is to
[7:18] have his Spirit within
[7:21] us we have looked at ourselves
[7:24] and we have found
[7:26] ourselves unworthy now I want you to
[7:30] know that that is a good
[7:31] thing to be able to judge yourself and
[7:35] throw your hands up in surrender and say
[7:38] Lord God I am
[7:41] guilty because when you can acknowledge
[7:43] that you're
[7:45] guilty that's when the Great judge can
[7:47] come on the scene and pardon
[7:51] you now brother bam teaches
[7:55] us that God always take these things
[7:58] that
[8:01] seems like nothing and makes something
[8:05] out of
[8:06] it and that's what he said in the little
[8:09] message why little Bethlehem he said God
[8:12] is so great till he takes the
[8:14] unidentified things of the earth to
[8:17] identify himself by
[8:20] it and I don't know about you but until
[8:24] Jesus Christ came into my life I was
[8:27] unidentified amen
[8:32] insignificant one of those things that
[8:34] will pass through and pass by and be
[8:39] forgotten amen but those are the kind of
[8:42] a people that God always
[8:46] uses he goes on to say God taking the
[8:49] things of the world I believe the
[8:52] scripture says by the foolishness of
[8:55] preaching it pleased God to take the UN
[8:59] identify
[9:01] things what we make great God call
[9:06] foolish what we put so much glory to God
[9:11] says is no good amen and what we think
[9:15] is no good God glorifies
[9:19] it we we we we must understand that
[9:23] everything of this world is just plain
[9:26] vanity am and we must learn by the grace
[9:30] of God at some point in time that only
[9:33] the things that we do for Christ will
[9:35] last we have heard that a many times but
[9:39] often times we are
[9:41] distracted by the things that are of the
[9:44] Dark
[9:47] World he goes on to say God took the
[9:50] Simple Man Without
[9:53] education not one day in
[9:55] school and met and yet said he was the
[9:59] greatest among all the prophets that
[10:02] ever
[10:04] lived because God identified
[10:07] himself in
[10:10] unidentifiable
[10:12] things how often you know you think
[10:15] about us we're not great
[10:17] men most people don't even know who we
[10:20] are we're not like President Kennedy or
[10:25] Abraham Lincoln or some great man of God
[10:29] not
[10:30] understand this that even Hitler has
[10:32] more Fame than you and me you and
[10:35] I but you see it is those little people
[10:38] that God can use those people like
[10:41] Gideon who who thought he was
[10:44] worthless he was unidentified he was
[10:47] hiding and that God had to shine the
[10:50] light in his life see I'm working with
[10:52] the
[10:53] power of of this light because the
[10:56] prophet of God brought to us that this
[10:59] power of light is able to transform amen
[11:04] hallelujah not only it's able to
[11:06] transform but it's able to renew your
[11:08] mind
[11:10] amen I have been reading a book dealing
[11:14] with food and it's it's really good to
[11:16] me and I was telling my wife about it
[11:19] the name of the book is called it starts
[11:22] with
[11:23] food so I went to
[11:26] the uh uh bookstore there a noble and I
[11:30] said I'm looking for a
[11:32] book and and she said do you know the
[11:35] title I said yeah it's starg with
[11:38] food then she asked me
[11:41] again can't you give me more than that I
[11:44] said it is it start with
[11:48] food she said give me more than one word
[11:51] food I said no the title is it stars
[11:55] with food she says oh
[12:00] she was able to look it up now you might
[12:02] think it's strange and I really believe
[12:04] that that you got to understand the only
[12:09] food that Adam and Eve had was food that
[12:14] would give them life nothing that
[12:18] would be contrary to their health
[12:22] spiritually and
[12:24] naturally but Satan introduced a hybrid
[12:28] food
[12:30] and because of that hybrid food it
[12:32] brought death come
[12:34] on he made and like he's doing now he
[12:38] made his food more
[12:41] appealing remember the Bible said it was
[12:44] good for the eyes and he made it more
[12:48] appealing he made it so good to it seems
[12:52] it made God's food God's
[12:55] word Bland
[13:00] and you better believe that science has
[13:03] worked this food situation in such a way
[13:07] to everything that is healthy for
[13:11] us just doesn't taste
[13:14] good but you got to realize amen before
[13:17] candy came into being because they know
[13:20] you like sweets your body like the taste
[13:22] of sweet your body like the taste of
[13:25] salt and your your body like the sour so
[13:28] they took those those things from the
[13:30] food and enhanced it by
[13:33] science they literally tried to
[13:35] reprogram in which they did but it's
[13:39] faulty because your body amen you taking
[13:43] foods that science has given you it
[13:46] brings death and your body can't
[13:49] recognize it as being food so therefore
[13:53] it it cannot
[13:56] process what we call food
[14:00] but the original
[14:02] food that kind that God made we call it
[14:06] organic
[14:07] now but is the original stuff that your
[14:11] body can identify with you know in that
[14:15] book it tells us that how come how we
[14:19] continue to gain
[14:20] weight because the body is so designed
[14:24] it pulls the nutrients out of the real
[14:27] food it ca for it and it knows that a
[14:32] Apple supposed to have this a orange
[14:35] supposed to have this certain meat
[14:37] supposed to have this but because it's
[14:39] all been hybrid and it doesn't have the
[14:42] substance in it that your body needs
[14:46] hello it constantly calls for it we look
[14:50] in the mirror and we can see the scale
[14:52] going up and we're thinking that we're
[14:54] over over uh how can I say uh uh we we
[14:59] we we we got more than enough but what
[15:01] we fail to see is your body is looking
[15:05] from the brain and is telling you that
[15:08] you're
[15:09] starving and you got to continue to eat
[15:12] to
[15:13] survive y'all hear what I'm saying but
[15:16] it's a it's a mechanism it's a thing
[15:18] that's in your brain if you can reset
[15:22] it Hallelujah then it will be able to
[15:26] identify the foods that you're now
[15:29] eating as poison oh come on somebody and
[15:32] that's what we've been doing they've
[15:34] been poisoning us hello somebody they
[15:38] know it they understand it and we've
[15:41] been blind to it and God's natural foods
[15:46] have literally
[15:47] become
[15:50] tasteless only because of Satan's
[15:55] enhancement he took God's creation and
[15:58] perverted I was telling my wife I said
[16:01] let me ask you something it which one
[16:03] would you rather have if you like
[16:05] bananas would you rather a a a piece of
[16:09] candy that tastes like banana or would
[16:12] you rather have a banana now I'm just
[16:14] saying from today's perspective we'll
[16:16] eat all of all of the candy that taste
[16:19] like banana why because the taste is
[16:21] enhanced you don't know what you going
[16:23] to get in a banana now the smell tastes
[16:26] better than the taste
[16:29] and I'm saying all of this is because s
[16:32] Satan has been doing this all along
[16:36] since the time of Eden
[16:38] amen oh come on
[16:41] somebody but the light now why because
[16:44] we're now it's amazing how people who
[16:47] are naturally uh you know now they want
[16:49] to go back to the
[16:51] original way of eating Hallelujah hello
[16:55] as the original word has returned in the
[16:57] spiritual people people are now wanting
[16:59] the real organic stuff because they
[17:03] realize what they've been eating is
[17:05] killing them
[17:07] amen right so is it with the the true
[17:10] children of God God is shining the light
[17:13] on the word and you don't want no hybrid
[17:16] stuff you want the original word because
[17:19] you realize that's where the life
[17:24] is
[17:26] now we look at at a
[17:31] time where you and I must come to a
[17:36] place to recognize what day and hour
[17:39] we're living
[17:40] in as we said by the grace of God that
[17:44] evening light came and then that evening
[17:46] light
[17:47] became uh a a day star I was thinking
[17:51] about that star that hung there by that
[17:52] moon for whatever reason the moon may
[17:55] have turned into blood but that star was
[17:58] just as bright as ever that star was a
[18:02] Watchman even over the moon come on
[18:05] somebody now I look at these things and
[18:07] I says Lord I say here we are in these
[18:11] last days and you and I have been chosen
[18:16] by God to be the light of the world Amen
[18:20] now I'm going tell you something in this
[18:22] book they say if you get 30
[18:25] days of eating properly the things that
[18:28] they have in this book it will reset
[18:31] your whole body's program and you'll
[18:34] basically not want to have anything to
[18:36] do with this other
[18:38] stuff now y'all might look at me crazy
[18:41] but that's my plan that's what I plan to
[18:43] do Lord amen you know and I thought
[18:46] about that because I said now Lord look
[18:47] at this thing I said God re resets us he
[18:52] resets us because there's a time we
[18:54] thought denomination of food was okay
[18:58] Hallelujah but when we heard the eagle
[19:01] Scream the real
[19:05] dietician that told us that we were not
[19:07] an eagle and we're not supposed to be
[19:09] eating that slot we changed our diet and
[19:13] this diet that we're now eating off of
[19:16] is bringing us where to eternal life
[19:20] amen you said well brother I I don't
[19:22] know about that but anyway it's true
[19:25] anyhow we're living in a time where in
[19:28] investigating Angels now I'm moving on
[19:31] we're living in a time where
[19:32] investigating angels have been seen
[19:36] since the time when brother brandham
[19:38] walked the
[19:39] Earth how much longer do you think God
[19:44] is going to
[19:46] tolerate this world in the condition
[19:49] that is in hello y'all getting quiet on
[19:52] me now my point is
[19:56] this if they came to investigate and
[20:00] this is one of the things that I really
[20:01] love because I've never seen it like
[20:03] this before brother bam said when they
[20:06] came to investigate what was going on
[20:08] down in Sodom and Gomorrah that he said
[20:10] one Angel
[20:13] stay stay with
[20:16] Abraham now you got to realize Billy
[20:19] Graham or Roberts never talk about
[20:23] angels but here was William brandham
[20:26] saying this Angel comes to me in a light
[20:30] he steps out of the
[20:32] light and he's come from the presence of
[20:36] God this Angel not only teaches me but
[20:39] he shows me
[20:41] scripture everything he said the angel
[20:43] ever said he said he went back to the
[20:45] Bible to see whether or not it was
[20:48] so so you said well what do you mean
[20:51] brother Brooks now you got to realize
[20:53] that the angel never
[20:57] left brother random or put it this way
[21:00] the angel never left Abraham until the
[21:04] time was right for the destruction of
[21:08] Sodom and
[21:09] Gomorrah now I'm going bring the angel
[21:11] down because I'm talking now about the
[21:13] mighty
[21:14] Angel we have now in our presence in our
[21:18] midst the mighty angel of Revelation
[21:22] 10 hallelujah hallelujah still here he
[21:27] hasn't left
[21:29] the moment he goes up we go with
[21:32] him hallu glory is that right come on
[21:36] somebody had not God sent us an
[21:40] angel where would we
[21:47] be he talks about the investigating
[21:50] angels He said you know he said the
[21:52] world calls them UFOs he said let them
[21:55] call them whatever they want to he said
[21:57] but we know they're in investigating
[22:00] Angels so we realize by the grace of God
[22:04] not only has God uh H H shared with us
[22:09] amen the revelation of all these things
[22:12] the world is seeing we ought to be
[22:15] excited oh they seen UFOs here they seen
[22:18] UFOs here they seen UFOs here oh my
[22:23] goodness I I wonder how many of y'all
[22:26] realize what God was doing when he he
[22:28] stoned
[22:32] Russia when he stoned did y'all know
[22:35] that when that astroid came or whatever
[22:36] it was Comet whatever you call it amen
[22:38] when it hit and it blew up like that
[22:41] amen what was it we were looking in the
[22:43] in in the in the in the uh you uh the uh
[22:46] uh sky for one thing and here God comes
[22:49] around and hit him again what was he
[22:50] doing he was basically sharing and
[22:53] showing at a time you think
[22:56] not and you better recognize this
[23:01] stoning is the portion that's
[23:04] right Jezebel will be Stone you so what
[23:08] do you mean the explosions and
[23:10] everything else that goes on will cause
[23:13] such a catastrophic event to carry on
[23:16] the Bible said the hell will be 100
[23:19] pound each can you imagine the
[23:22] destruction of a hell that's 100 pound
[23:28] there is no head if that hit
[23:30] you there is no
[23:33] you regardless of where it hits you
[23:36] there you're
[23:38] done so it shows that the god that we
[23:41] serve and brother bam said it like this
[23:43] he said you know he said what will be
[23:46] the Judgment of this Gentile
[23:49] Nation Gentile world who had so much
[23:53] truth now look at this out don't there
[23:56] has been no other age
[23:59] since the beginning of time that God
[24:02] showed grace and mercy to like this one
[24:05] amen there have never been a
[24:08] Revival in the history of
[24:11] time like there was in this day God took
[24:15] a or Roberts God took a Billy Graham and
[24:19] all of the others Tommy osbor and all
[24:21] these great evangelist shaking this
[24:24] United States and the world and they
[24:26] turn their backs
[24:30] right thank
[24:33] God it was purposely done and
[24:35] orchestrated by
[24:37] God he had already written that will be
[24:41] blind and naked and not know it and I
[24:45] read to you the quote last week he did
[24:48] it so that he can get a
[24:51] bride Hallelujah just like God blinded
[24:55] the Jews to get a gentile bride in
[24:57] Paul's de
[24:58] God blinded Le the sheia that he might
[25:02] have a bride and guess who she is the
[25:07] unidentified Hallelujah you so
[25:09] unidentified they don't even know what
[25:11] you are you're not denomination you're
[25:14] not organization amen you don't have a
[25:16] board of Bishop or some kind of headship
[25:19] you Iden unidentified you don't belong
[25:21] in this but you are the ones that God
[25:25] has decided to show his glory through
[25:28] amen you got a lot of problems but God
[25:33] knew you would have amen find me
[25:35] somebody in the Bible who didn't have
[25:38] problems find me somebody Amen in the
[25:41] word who was great uh great and and
[25:44] never had a problem or fail or failed
[25:47] God there are aren't
[25:50] any the Bible said we all have come
[25:53] short of the glory of God woo glory to
[25:57] God now brother brandom said in that
[25:59] message as I was with Moses he said
[26:01] Moses had a lot of
[26:03] failures but God never looked at his
[26:05] failures amen than he looked at the
[26:08] commission Hallelujah come on somebody
[26:11] and if God would withdraw the blood from
[26:13] the bride she would be as filthy as
[26:16] anybody
[26:18] else amen oh I'm going be preaching on
[26:20] the blood this coming Sunday if you
[26:21] don't get it you if you can't be S if
[26:23] you ain't saved yet you'll be saved
[26:26] then he
[26:28] because you got to realize by the grace
[26:31] of God if it wasn't for the blood of
[26:34] Jesus and nobody don't want to speak
[26:35] about the blood anymore hallelujah amen
[26:39] but if it wasn't for his blood where
[26:41] would we be there would be no world
[26:44] because you know we we thought that the
[26:46] blood was just covering us brother
[26:48] brandom through the message brought that
[26:50] the blood was a cumference around the
[26:53] whole
[26:55] earth that's why Sinners can still stand
[26:58] because of his blood even though they
[27:01] don't appreciate it it is his blood amen
[27:04] that's literally stopping the wrath of
[27:07] God
[27:14] Amen we are
[27:18] enforcers I I like that because amen God
[27:22] is a
[27:24] enforcer he doesn't ask for you to move
[27:27] he moves you
[27:29] am is that all right he's an enforcer
[27:34] and you and I must recognize amen that
[27:37] we're part of him
[27:41] amen look what he says in Ephesians 58
[27:45] said for ye were sometime Darkness but
[27:48] now are ye light in the Lord walk as
[27:53] children of the light I am not of the
[27:56] darkness therefore I will not behave
[27:58] like the darkness I will not act like
[28:01] the darkness I'll not go where Darkness
[28:03] go I am in the
[28:06] light I thought about it and I said Lord
[28:10] it is not
[28:11] true the absence of light brings
[28:18] Darkness it is light that
[28:22] penetrates the darkness would be here if
[28:25] the light wasn't on Amen
[28:28] but the light brings it disperses every
[28:32] ounce of Darkness till it becomes
[28:34] invisible to the Natural Eye you can't
[28:37] even see
[28:39] it because in light there is no Darkness
[28:43] amen and when you began to see who you
[28:47] are that's why brother brandom said the
[28:50] Bride of Jesus Christ have been so
[28:53] Justified as though she never did it in
[28:55] the first place Hallelujah you said well
[28:58] how can that be he said
[29:01] God refused or would not take the bride
[29:04] out of Jesus Christ until the work was
[29:08] finished Lord hallelujah so she climbed
[29:11] calvary's heel with him amen she
[29:14] suffered the pain that he suffered amen
[29:16] she suffered the humiliation he suffered
[29:19] he she was in
[29:22] him and because she was in him now he's
[29:25] in her
[29:28] hallelujah oh my
[29:30] God he held it together he won the
[29:34] battle for the first Adam couldn't do it
[29:38] even though he walked out with Eve he
[29:40] couldn't redeem her Hallelujah but the
[29:43] second Adam amen who is the light of God
[29:47] Amen he is that quickening
[29:51] Spirit Hallelujah did y'all know that
[29:55] did you know and and brother Keith
[29:57] brought this my I knew the scripture I
[29:59] had the scripture and I thought why
[30:01] didn't I use the
[30:02] scripture he I hope he didn't mind me
[30:04] saying that but the Bible tells us that
[30:06] in James
[30:09] 11:17 for every good gift and every
[30:13] perfect gift is from
[30:17] above amen now I don't know how you tie
[30:20] that into the message but brother bandam
[30:23] said that the Bride of Jesus Christ is a
[30:25] love gift to Christ
[30:28] from God W hallelujah amen so what are
[30:33] you saying brother BRS whether you like
[30:34] it or not the light of this message is
[30:38] I'm perfect
[30:39] amen amen if I came from God I am a
[30:44] perfect gift and if I came from above I
[30:48] am oh my you are perfect gift I am a
[30:53] perfect gift and no matter what Satan
[30:55] can tries to do he can't change
[30:58] amen glory hey come on somebody how do
[31:02] you know woo Lord have mercy I'm I'm
[31:05] trying my best not to carry
[31:08] on but how do you know amen that you
[31:11] your father is
[31:13] light because you saw the light you see
[31:17] the light you understand the light is
[31:19] that right the Bible said that Darkness
[31:22] cannot comprehend the
[31:24] light and because you can comprehend it
[31:28] that is determined that you can't oh
[31:31] well brother Brook I'm faulty I am not
[31:33] faulty my flesh
[31:36] is hallelujah when you're born of God
[31:40] you're born perfect that's the only way
[31:42] that's the only way God don't bring
[31:44] forth deformed children he bring forth
[31:47] perfect
[31:51] children thank you Lord the blood is
[31:54] perfect how can his blood produce
[31:57] something thing outside of
[32:01] perfection Hallelujah and what you don't
[32:04] recognize perhaps is that seed that he
[32:06] planted in you before the foundation of
[32:09] the world was perfect perfect Hallelujah
[32:12] so when the preaching of the Cross came
[32:14] to you the blood struck that seed amen
[32:18] hallelujah and brought forth his life in
[32:21] youen that's the only way amen isn't it
[32:24] true according to 1 Corinthians 15 he
[32:27] says oh fool don't you know in order for
[32:29] a seed to to live it must it must die
[32:35] first before it can be quickened before
[32:38] it could be brought to life it had to
[32:40] die you see what brother I'm not where I
[32:43] supposed to be you work with your flesh
[32:45] but the seed in you in order for it to
[32:47] be quick and in order for you to see
[32:49] this thing it had to die amen something
[32:53] your will your desire has to die
[32:56] Hallelujah in order for Christ to live
[32:59] is he living amen and you got to
[33:02] recognize oh well I ain't doing like so
[33:03] and so well maybe your faith is not
[33:06] where his faith is the God God said he
[33:08] gave Every Man a Measure of
[33:11] Faith my measure may not be as great as
[33:13] somebody else's Hallelujah but when we
[33:17] put those Faith together we can move
[33:19] mountains Hallelujah come on somebody
[33:22] the Bible said where two or three are
[33:23] gathered in my name there I am in the
[33:26] midst I'm telling you something you'll
[33:29] never make it out of this world until
[33:31] you trust the work of God's salvation

[34:05] him Hallelujah I'm just saying Lord I I
[34:09] I just just know I just know uh by the
[34:11] word of God the Bible says amen fear
[34:13] that angel don't don't don't don't
[34:16] disrupt him now you fear Him and do what
[34:18] he says do because amen he has a right
[34:20] to Pardon
[34:24] you is that all right for every every
[34:28] good gift and every perfect gift is from
[34:30] above and cometh down from the father of

[35:06] forgetfulness God can't even see
[35:09] it Hallelujah That Old Devil I tell you
[35:11] what he's always trying to make us feel
[35:15] guilty is that all right amen and that
[35:18] Ephesians 5:14 14 says amen wherefore he
[35:22] said awake thou that sleepeth and arise
[35:25] from the dead and Christ shall give thee
[35:27] what light Hallelujah wake up rise from
[35:32] the dead Hallelujah that's what it is
[35:34] the problem is we're too ashamed Amen to
[35:37] say I'm guilty Lord I'm guilty I'm
[35:41] worthy of death Hallelujah but I need
[35:43] your grace and your mercy Hallelujah and
[35:46] you promised it to us Lord I'm not
[35:48] trying to defend myself I I don't have a
[35:51] judge I don't have a jury I don't have
[35:53] no defendant I am my own and I'm
[35:56] pleading for your mercy and your
[36:00] grace
[36:02] Hallelujah and he says okay I'm not just
[36:05] going to give you Grace I'm GNA give you
[36:06] Grace
[36:09] Grace Hallelujah I'm going to cause you
[36:12] to Triumph you might not be worthy of it
[36:15] but I'm going to make it happen for my
[36:18] name's sake amen hallelujah thank God
[36:21] for the light of God let me tell you
[36:23] something I may not be what I want to be
[36:26] but I know God exists I know he's real
[36:30] but I can because I can see where he
[36:32] brought me from now I don't know about
[36:34] you I was in a cage Hallelujah I was in
[36:37] prison Hallelujah to my own flesh my own
[36:40] desires amen Devils ruled my life but he
[36:44] whom the son is set free he's free
[36:47] indeed and where the spirit of the Lord
[36:49] is there is
[36:52] Liberty there is Liberty I know you
[36:55] might look let me tell you something the
[36:57] Bible said all things are lawful but not
[36:58] all things are expedient Hallelujah in
[37:01] other words amen who going to lay in the
[37:02] charge that God's elect Hallelujah is
[37:05] that all right I heard brother Brandon
[37:07] preaching this this evening and he began
[37:08] to talk
[37:10] about about that uh remember the cow and
[37:13] you know those stary eyes and you know
[37:15] the choosing of the Bride he said oh boy
[37:17] he said don't you don't you choose that
[37:20] kind with the wild eyes and then he say
[37:22] Lord forgive me you know he knew at that
[37:26] point in time but but God let him say it
[37:30] Hallelujah but who's going to condemn
[37:33] him y'all hear what I'm saying amen when
[37:36] you see by the grace of God how God
[37:39] through his Prophet worked with such an
[37:42] amazing grace he has such a friendship
[37:45] you know what I'm talking about all of
[37:47] us allow our friends to get away with
[37:49] things that you wouldn't let somebody
[37:50] else get away
[37:54] with come on somebody it's true but
[37:57] we're
[37:58] conquerors we are conquerors and God
[38:00] want us to listen I'm telling you the
[38:03] only reason why you don't see yourself
[38:05] as a conqueror is because you're eating
[38:07] Satan's
[38:10] diet huh Satan got you eating some kind
[38:13] of harest making you think that this
[38:16] conquering is of your own your yourself
[38:20] but this conquering is Christ in you he
[38:22] is the mighty conqueror so if he's a
[38:26] conqueror and he's in me that means I'm
[38:28] a conqueror if he's a conqueror and he's
[38:31] in you that makes you a
[38:34] conqueror then Paul goes on to say we're
[38:36] more than a conqueror why because they
[38:39] did not expect light to come down into
[38:43] hell Hallelujah that was the day the son
[38:46] descended all the way into hell
[38:49] Hallelujah and he found Satan knocked on
[38:52] his door Hallelujah and he conquered
[38:55] death hell in the grave now you say I
[38:57] wasn't there yes you are you were there
[39:00] with his flesh and you were there in his
[39:02] Spirit
[39:03] Hallelujah I'm going prove that to you
[39:06] because when he rose on the Easter
[39:08] morning brother bandam said that was the
[39:10] first time two sons arose at the same
[39:12] time hallelujah amen the natural son
[39:15] which ties out one of these old days my
[39:18] natural body arise Hallelujah and the
[39:21] spiritual son which was Jesus Christ
[39:23] show that he conquered amen the elements
[39:25] of this realm and the elements of the
[39:28] Heavenly
[39:29] realm put those two together and they
[39:35] roseo that's the light of the
[39:38] word think about it this death Hell In
[39:42] The Grave why should I be afraid hey we
[39:46] enforcers amen hallelujah David said I
[39:48] just didn't let my enemy go I stumped on
[39:51] him I he said I brought him down to the
[39:54] dust Hallelujah and that's exactly what
[39:57] this bride is going to do she might look
[40:00] like a weaking but God is forcing her
[40:02] he's pushing her into that place she'll
[40:05] cry out oh Lord once more and we'll
[40:08] leave out of here with our feet on the
[40:11] devil's neck Hallelujah why because we
[40:14] God can't move until his Enemy enemy
[40:17] becomes his foot stol and you the Bride
[40:20] of Jesus Christ amen as that brother
[40:23] said the other day you're the feet of
[40:24] God
[40:27] is that right Joshua wherever you go
[40:30] this is the light of your message
[40:32] wherever you plant your feet is yours
[40:35] Hallelujah and that commission has been
[40:37] given to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[40:39] wherever you plant your feet it's
[40:43] yours that's the truth amen y'all heard
[40:46] my story y'all heard last Sunday oh when
[40:49] Wednesday was it yeah amen Sunday yeah

[41:07] me upset yeah I mean just just telling
[41:10] me all the negative stuff and what could

[41:20] want nobody coming by the business and
[41:21] seeing you looking in the trash that go
[41:23] that'll be bad for the
[41:25] business the holy spirit said that's a
[41:29] challenge Hallelujah I said Lord y'all
[41:31] remember I said I don't know how he
[41:32] going to have me going I didn't know
[41:34] whether he would have me as a lamb or
[41:35] lion but I was
[41:37] going Hallelujah you got to realize now
[41:40] now it is the Lamb that leads the
[41:43] lion oh come on come on it's the lamb
[41:47] that leaves the
[41:51] lion huh that's right he was a king but
[41:55] it was the lamb nature that let
[41:58] him come on somebody so when we look at

[42:46] what time I said I told him the time
[42:48] they said the trash hadn't even gone out
[42:50] yet he could have easily gone out there
[42:52] and look in that trash they said you
[42:53] know what they told me you need to
[42:54] report him they gave me his name and all
[42:57] of that stuff and I've been waiting on

[51:31] more than
[51:34] conquerors
[51:36] Hallelujah man we we know the devil he

[51:50] that 1 John 2:9 And1 he that saith he is
[51:54] in the light and hateth his brother is
[51:57] in darkness even until
[52:01] now hello amen and your
[52:05] brother is not just your Christian
[52:08] brother y'all hear what I'm saying
[52:11] because if that was the case why would

[52:22] why brother Brandon he tried his best
[52:24] Amen to you know to be kind to all all
[52:28] men communicate with all
[52:31] men we we become as they are not sinful
[52:34] but I'm saying you know our problem is
[52:36] that we exalt ourselves as Christians
[52:38] when we should
[52:41] obey humble
[52:44] ourselves anybody
[52:48] guilty Hallelujah so you know and it's
[52:52] true now let's move on he that loveth
[52:54] his brother abideth in the light and
[52:56] there is none occasion of stumbling in
[52:59] him why when you can learn to love your
[53:02] enemy you really got the goods then you
[53:06] got the goods you got the goods and one
[53:09] thing about your enemy he don't like it
[53:10] cuz you love
[53:12] him huh and he know you love him and the
[53:16] more he know you love him the more he
[53:18] becomes your
[53:20] enemy he hates it why he can't
[53:23] comprehend you he can't understand how
[53:25] you can love him when they've done he
[53:27] done you so wrong how could he love me
[53:31] right and yet he's dying for love but he
[53:32] don't want your
[53:36] kind yeah but he that hateth his brother
[53:39] is in darkness and walketh in darkness
[53:42] and knoweth not whether he goeth because
[53:45] that Darkness has blinded his
[53:48] eyes and how often we've allowed sin and
[53:52] darkness to cover our eyes to the
[53:55] reality that every man is born in the in
[53:58] the image of
[54:00] God don't you think God he God is God we
[54:03] can't even call a man a
[54:05] fool God say don't even call him a
[54:08] raiker come on
[54:09] somebody Les you be in danger of hair
[54:13] fire Hallelujah come on somebody it's
[54:16] true that's how sensitive the holy
[54:19] spirit is now you got to realize the
[54:22] Bible said God would that none perish
[54:27] and don't you know there be those who
[54:29] are not of his seed that God will give
[54:32] eternal
[54:33] life think about it like the brother
[54:37] brought out I forgot who who it was he
[54:39] said think about it he said here it is
[54:41] you looking for your son and all of a
[54:43] sudden you find your son and he has a
[54:45] friend and you can afford to adopt or
[54:49] bring his friend in as an
[54:52] adoption that's why he said all that
[54:54] love you and all that you love
[54:59] hello somebody come on How Sweet It
[55:03] Is amen so you must realize amen that
[55:07] God ain't going to tell you to do
[55:08] something that he himself won't
[55:21] Doo did y'all know that brother bam had
[55:25] a neighbor who would do good to to them
[55:27] brother bam said they'll be
[55:30] there a
[55:32] neighbor so I get excited when somebody
[55:34] likes
[55:37] me amen because I realize it's ordained
[55:39] by God they may never come to know this
[55:43] message but for sure they're kind and
[55:45] gentle to you cuz I'm going to tell you
[55:47] something if they had a real devil in
[55:48] there you would know
[55:50] it you you would know it is that all
[55:54] right oh my my my ye are the children of
[55:57] the light and the children of the day
[55:59] and we are not of the night uh but uh uh

[56:05] darkness is that right we're going to
[56:07] love our brothers I don't care what it
[56:09] takes Lord if I if I'm not there give it
[56:11] to me Lord amen hallelujah our duty is
[56:15] to enforce the laws of light and you got
[56:18] to realize out of all that persecution
[56:21] out of all that cursing out of all that
[56:24] spitting in the face Jesus still said
[56:27] father forgive them for they know not
[56:29] what they
[56:30] do now don't tell me that's perfect love
[56:34] when you can recognize the spirit behind
[56:36] of a person and yet love them because
[56:39] they don't know what they
[56:41] doing a lot of us we look at these
[56:44] things oh it's so bad it's happening
[56:46] like this and and God said but you ask
[56:48] me for character I'm trying to get you
[56:50] to love this am I'm trying to get you to
[56:53] overcome this and when you can begin to
[56:56] to look at the individuals and pity them
[56:58] and love them those demons will
[57:02] stop because light has one
[57:06] amen light has
[57:12] oneall demons can't work in except with
[57:14] in darkness and they have to plunge You
[57:16] Into Darkness to
[57:19] work to have some kind of effect they
[57:22] got to put you into
[57:23] darkness come on come on come on it's
[57:25] true anyhow amen I would do this to
[57:29] enforce the laws of light and every time
[57:32] I think about it I said here it is not
[57:36] even the grave could hold
[57:38] light God went he went all the way into
[57:41] the grave no tomb no nothing could hold
[57:44] that light there that light came up you
[57:47] got to realize Jesus wasn't clothed in
[57:49] dark clothes when he went to hell he was
[57:51] light am all hell knew he was there amen
[57:58] Hallelujah and all hell know you here am
[58:01] you say oh no they don't yes they do let
[58:05] me tell you something the Catholic
[58:06] church and all of those people are
[58:08] working to put this light out but they
[58:11] can't put it out because they didn't
[58:13] start it Hallelujah they tied for
[58:16] thousand of years Amen to imprison him
[58:20] that's what brother B said he said
[58:21] that's what the devil tried to do he
[58:23] tried to keep the light in tuned
[58:26] Hallelujah but he couldn't do it why
[58:29] because that light was powerful
[58:31] Hallelujah come on somebody it's the
[58:33] truth amen the Bible said amen that day
[58:35] that light shook the Earth amen and and
[58:39] however whatever Dimension hell was it
[58:41] had to let him go and not only did he
[58:44] let him go he went by the grave site and
[58:46] and the stone was rolled
[58:48] away I love this Resurrection hallelujah
[58:52] amen because the Bible said when he was
[58:53] resurrected the angel stood by his grave
[58:56] hallelujah hallelujah when they thought
[58:59] Hal that's what God did didn't he he ran
[59:01] the Roman soldiers off Hallelujah the
[59:03] angel says now we on
[59:06] duty Hallelujah and that's how it is
[59:09] with your tomb when you go to the Grave
[59:11] Hallelujah you got Angels right there
[59:14] why you're royalty the power of God is
[59:17] still resting on your
[59:18] bones hey it's true
[59:21] anyhow you don't go to the Grave alone
[59:25] even your bones is important to God cuz
[59:28] he know he's got to bring him up
[59:32] again ain't God good to
[59:39] us
[59:41] hallelujah in Genesis 1:3 I'm almost
[59:43] done in Genesis 1:3 when God said let
[59:46] there be light there was light I thought
[59:49] about it you know I heard him on on uh
[59:52] uh the message uh it is the rising of
[59:55] the Sun brother bom said that was God
[59:57] speaking light into existence you know
[1:00:01] you can't do no work in the
[1:00:02] dark that's what he said he said work
[1:00:05] while it's day because when night come
[1:00:06] no man can do no work so God that's not
[1:00:09] even that's not even sunlight he working
[1:00:11] with right there he's just bringing
[1:00:13] light to everything that he can work
[1:00:15] Hallelujah and so when you see that by
[1:00:17] the grace of God listen to it brother
[1:00:19] show share that on on that message there
[1:00:22] so when we look at it here God brings
[1:00:24] light and that's what he did to are our
[1:00:27] lives even though Darkness still exists
[1:00:30] he brought light into our eyes light of
[1:00:33] the eye makes the whole body light
[1:00:36] Hallelujah so he brought light to our
[1:00:39] eyes that we can distinguish the light
[1:00:41] from the darkness come on somebody is
[1:00:43] that all right and because of that we
[1:00:45] can separate the light and the Darkness
[1:00:46] and therefore we can walk in the light
[1:00:48] and not in the
[1:00:50] darkness
[1:00:52] hallelujah amen Jesus said unto him
[1:00:54] saying yet a little while
[1:00:56] is the light with you walk while ye have
[1:01:00] the light huh lest Darkness come upon
[1:01:04] you but he that walketh in darkness
[1:01:06] knoweth not hither he goeth whether he
[1:01:08] goeth while you have light believe in
[1:01:12] the light while you have light believe
[1:01:16] in the light while you have light
[1:01:18] believe in the light that you may be
[1:01:21] Children of the light these things spake
[1:01:24] Jesus and departed and did hide himself
[1:01:28] even from then hallelujah is that right
[1:01:31] he brought a message Hallelujah and he
[1:01:33] said walk in the light and then when
[1:01:35] that message was brought amen he went
[1:01:38] off to scene you where you couldn't see
[1:01:39] his physical body
[1:01:42] anymore but he warned us walk in the
[1:01:45] light because Darkness
[1:01:47] coming the Lord that's what a Psalm says
[1:01:50] the Lord is my light and my salvation
