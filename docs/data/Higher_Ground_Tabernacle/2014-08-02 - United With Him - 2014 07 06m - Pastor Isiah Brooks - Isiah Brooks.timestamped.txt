[0:00] by the grace of God. And we're just
[0:02] going to work the word of God. And we
[0:05] trust that you're blessed here this
[0:06] morning. We just want to encourage you.
[0:09] I believe that we're living in the last
[0:11] days. I believe that the coming of the
[0:14] Lord is nigh. Amen. Uh Israel is now
[0:17] looking for their Messiah. They've been
[0:19] having all kinds of signs and things
[0:22] that are taking place there. We can see
[0:25] the ecamunical council moving. Uh this
[0:28] thing is moving at a rapid pace. Now I
[0:31] want you to understand as the darkness
[0:34] get darker, the light is to be brighter.
[0:37] Amen. And uh the only way that could
[0:40] ever happen, you must make a decision uh
[0:44] whether you're going to go all the way
[0:46] with God or not. Amen. All right. Uh it
[0:51] this is not a time where you can
[0:53] straddle the fence. Amen. This is not a
[0:56] time wherein that God would allow
[0:59] certain things to continue in your life
[1:01] without judgment. Amen. Amen. There's a
[1:04] time when God would uh almost let you go
[1:07] in a sense uh because of he's trying to
[1:10] teach you. He's trying to mature you.
[1:13] He's trying to bring you to a level of
[1:15] maturity. But right now, remember now,
[1:18] now this is not even the age of Lot in
[1:20] that sense. But God even told them not
[1:23] to look behind, not to look back. And
[1:26] you know, the prophet of God says she
[1:28] heard, Miss Lot heard the cries of her
[1:31] grandchildren.
[1:32] Think about it. So she had a justifiable
[1:35] reason to turn, but God told her not to.
[1:39] And when she looked back,
[1:42] judgment struck her. And so I'm saying
[1:45] there is not even a justifiable reason.
[1:48] Amen. To turn back now. Amen. Because
[1:52] you and I are living in a crucial age.
[1:55] We're living in a dangerous age. And I
[1:58] believe with all my heart only those who
[2:02] will give their life away will find it.
[2:05] Amen. Amen. Matthew
[2:09] 16. We taught this in the Sunday school
[2:12] this morning. For those of you who have
[2:14] young children, we start at 8:30. Uh
[2:17] you're more than welcome to bring them.
[2:20] uh as long as they can understand and
[2:22] read, you can bring them. Amen. So, by
[2:26] the grace of God, this is what we're
[2:27] working with. We had a good little time
[2:29] this morning. St. Matthew
[2:34] 16:25, we used a scripture. Brother
[2:36] Benham taught this message, uh the
[2:39] teaching on Moses, and that's what we
[2:40] were working with this morning. But I
[2:42] thought that scripture was so good and
[2:44] in line with what I wanted to minister
[2:46] this morning. So, we're going to read
[2:47] this again. St. Matthew
[2:55] 16:25. Let's read by the grace of God
[2:58] the 24th verse and the
[3:00] 25th. Then said Jesus unto his
[3:03] disciples, if any man will come after
[3:06] me, let him deny himself and take up his
[3:11] cross and follow
[3:14] me. Let us read the 25th verse together.
[3:17] For whosoever will save his life shall
[3:20] lose it, and whosoever will lose his
[3:23] life for my sake shall find it. Is that
[3:27] all right? Let us go to Colossians,
[3:33] please. I believe that the time is so
[3:37] short, it is so near. Amen. That uh uh
[3:42] some of us are feeling it and some of us
[3:44] are not. Uh for those of us uh I was
[3:47] telling the uh little Sunday school this
[3:49] morning, you you might not believe in
[3:52] crying out, but I personally believe
[3:55] that's the only way God's going to hear
[3:56] you. Amen.
[3:58] Cuz sometime we
[4:00] pray and we don't even pray in
[4:03] sincerity. We just pray because we feel
[4:07] like it's an obligation and it's the
[4:09] right thing to do. We feel guilty
[4:12] sometimes for not getting on our knees
[4:14] because we know that's what we should
[4:16] do. But that's not the kind of prayer
[4:19] God hears.
[4:21] God hears sincere prayer. God hears the
[4:23] kind of prayer that's in
[4:26] desperation. Uh uh but anyway, let us
[4:29] read the scripture and then we'll go
[4:30] right on with the
[4:32] word. Colossians 1 uh beginning at the
[4:36] 26th verse. We'll we'll end at the
[4:40] 28th. Even a mystery would have been hid
[4:43] from ages and from generations, but now
[4:47] is made manifest to his saints. To whom
[4:51] God would make known what is the riches
[4:54] of the glory of his mystery among the
[4:57] Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the
[5:01] hope of
[5:02] glory. Let us pray. Father God, we come
[5:06] before you, Lord, as humbly as we know
[5:08] how. We thank you for being so good to
[5:11] us. And we thank you for being real to
[5:14] us, Lord. We pray that you would just
[5:16] minister to us this morning. Break and
[5:19] destroy every yoke of the enemy, Lord,
[5:22] as we commit this service into your
[5:24] hands. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[5:26] Amen. You may be seated.
[5:39] We like to entitle this
[5:41] message
[5:43] united with
[5:46] him. If we had uh little food we would
[5:49] put uh uh as uh a higher
[5:55] calling. A higher calling.
[6:01] Now we realize amen as we said
[6:04] earlier I don't know
[6:06] how much God can
[6:09] do in order to uh or what he can do in
[6:13] order to convince people that we are
[6:16] actually living in the last
[6:18] days. We have had more
[6:22] uh catastrophic things happen in our
[6:27] age than any age.
[6:31] Uh we can read about Pompei and we can
[6:36] read about
[6:37] uh uh
[6:40] uh the various cities that went down
[6:43] like
[6:44] Capernium and we think to ourselves what
[6:47] were they
[6:51] thinking here? nature was giving them
[6:54] warning of all kinds of sort and yet
[6:56] they refused
[6:59] to get right. You think about how even
[7:03] in
[7:05] America we have had in our
[7:09] time period
[7:11] more and greater
[7:14] things in our age
[7:17] done than written in the word
[7:21] the New
[7:23] Testament. We had great signs and
[7:25] wonders and miracles 50s in the 60s
[7:31] 40s wigworth
[7:33] and Bossworth and all of these others
[7:36] that are gone on and not even to dismiss
[7:40] the fact that we even had a prophet by
[7:42] the name of William Brandham
[7:45] that God came and he did miraculous
[7:47] things but God wasn't showing off
[7:52] the reason Why God came was to gather
[7:56] his arm.
[7:59] He shook America.
[8:01] He shook the world from one end to the
[8:04] other.
[8:05] And yet in still everything seems to go
[8:10] worse.
[8:12] Well, it's because the Bible said that
[8:15] it would. Amen. The Bible said that evil
[8:18] seduces your wax worse and worse.
[8:23] You have heard me say many times that
[8:25] God will not even judge the world until
[8:29] he first judged the
[8:31] church. Once the church is judged and
[8:34] it's found guilty, God gives space for
[8:37] it to repent. Remember, even God gave
[8:41] Jezebel space to
[8:43] repent. But she wouldn't repent.
[8:46] We find out that even in this what we
[8:50] call message, people just can't seem to
[8:54] find space to repent. Lord,
[9:00] they'll shout, they'll dance, they'll
[9:02] speak in tongues, they'll say,
[9:04] "Hallelujah. Amen, brother." And then
[9:07] they'll walk right out from under the
[9:09] presence of
[9:10] God back into their own lives and their
[9:13] own ideas of things. Amen.
[9:18] And there's only one
[9:21] problem. The Holy Ghost, they say they
[9:24] have, they just don't have it. Amen.
[9:29] Oh yes, they may have it on the flesh.
[9:31] They may have it on the spirit, but the
[9:33] soul have not been converted. Amen.
[9:38] Even the
[9:39] scripture finding a few
[9:43] disciples, Amen. that were
[9:48] uh there in in
[9:51] in followed. I believe it was John in
[9:54] 19th chapter of uh
[9:57] Acts. I think that question was asked
[10:05] um in the second verse when Paul having
[10:10] passed through the upper coast and he uh
[10:13] came to the Ephesus and find he said
[10:15] finding certain
[10:17] disciples he said unto them have you
[10:20] received the Holy Ghost since you
[10:23] believed? They had a good answer.
[10:27] They said unto him, "We have not so much
[10:30] as heard, whether there be a Holy
[10:33] Ghost." Well, that was a good answer.
[10:36] Not like they had heard and was
[10:38] rejecting it, but they heard it, never
[10:41] heard it, and so therefore, they had
[10:44] place to receive. Amen. Amen. What about
[10:46] those of us who have heard? Yeah. Amen.
[10:49] And as our brother said last week, there
[10:52] are so many people in this message who
[10:55] have a Baptist theology who believe that
[10:58] once I believe the message, I've got it.
[11:02] Well, I want you to know there's one
[11:04] that's greater in that sense than you.
[11:08] And that's the devil. Amen. The devil
[11:11] believes, but he ain't got it. Amen. The
[11:14] Bible says he trembles. That's right.
[11:16] Amen. He knows it's
[11:19] right. He believes it's right. But there
[11:23] is no space in his heart for conversion.
[11:27] Amen. Amen.
[11:30] Now, I want to say this by the grace of
[11:32] God because I realize that we can go on
[11:35] for years in this message because it's
[11:38] so
[11:38] glorious. The revelation of it is so
[11:42] stimulating. It'll cause you to jump,
[11:44] shout, smile, sneak, and st run up and
[11:46] down the aisle. And guess what? You're
[11:49] still going to have it.
[11:51] Amen. As long as your
[11:56] desires is of the world. Yeah. Amen.
[11:59] Come on, somebody. That's right. It
[12:02] ain't there.
[12:05] And we find out why. Because you've got
[12:07] to
[12:08] understand that when you receive the
[12:10] sealing of the Holy Ghost, your old
[12:13] nature dies. Amen.
[12:16] Literally dies. Amen. And from that
[12:19] point on, it is Christ in you. Amen. If
[12:23] there is a struggle in you between the
[12:26] two natures, you're like Jacob. Amen.
[12:29] You haven't received your new walk yet.
[12:32] Amen. Come on. You're still wrestling
[12:36] with the angels. And let me say it like
[12:39] this. You better not let him go till he
[12:42] bless you.
[12:44] Amen. Still
[12:46] wrestling with your old nature.
[12:51] You know, it was it was said many times
[12:54] which one would do right is the one you
[12:56] feed the most. Amen. Now, brother Adam
[13:00] was working amen with two different
[13:02] things. If your soul has been
[13:05] converted, you want to make sure it's
[13:08] fed.
[13:10] Your flesh ain't changing. Yeah. Amen.
[13:13] There is a nature to your flesh. Amen.
[13:16] Your flesh hate the word. Oh, you don't
[13:19] believe that, do you? But it does. Your
[13:22] flesh don't want to praise him. Your
[13:24] flesh don't want to thank him. Your
[13:26] flesh don't want to pray to him. Your
[13:28] flesh don't want to do nothing. Amen.
[13:31] The flesh don't even like you saying
[13:33] hallelujah. Amen. Amen. It resists the
[13:36] will of God every day, all day. Amen. Oh
[13:40] Lord.
[13:42] But when that soul is converted, Paul
[13:45] said, "Kill him. Kill him every day. You
[13:49] got to die every day." Well, I got the
[13:51] Holy Ghost yesterday. Well, you better
[13:53] apply the token today. Amen.
[13:56] You better put up a sign. Amen. That the
[13:59] devil can read. No trespasses. Amen.
[14:03] Amen. Amen. Warning. Yes, sir.
[14:07] Praise God. This property is protected.
[14:11] Hallelujah. If you cross the line, I am
[14:15] not responsible.
[14:16] Hallelujah. For what's about to happen.
[14:19] Amen. Amen.
[14:21] So we realize by the grace of God that
[14:23] when we come to understanding, amen,
[14:26] that they're all meant, and that's what
[14:28] we don't realize. We don't see that
[14:31] there's really a dying out.
[14:35] And as long as you are in this body,
[14:37] you're going to have battles.
[14:40] Y'all hear what I'm saying? But you but
[14:42] you win the battles because Paul said,
[14:45] "We are more than conquerors through
[14:48] Christ.
[14:52] Hallelujah.
[14:55] Oh, when we we talk about being
[14:58] united and that is the situation that
[15:01] we're working with.
[15:03] Now, this is why we don't see all of the
[15:06] great things in this message around us
[15:10] that we
[15:11] should. I I'm going to stop saying just
[15:13] a message. I'm going to say around
[15:16] here because this little group, we have
[15:18] enough people in here to see God move in
[15:21] such a powerful way. But let me say it
[15:25] like this. It is because of your own
[15:26] lives.
[15:28] Because of our own lives that God can't
[15:32] move, right? We're not going to judge
[15:34] somebody else's church. We're going to
[15:37] judge this one. Amen. We're going to
[15:39] look at what God is doing here and the
[15:41] potential that God has in here. Amen. To
[15:45] do a miraculous thing.
[15:47] Hello, somebody. And you and I are the
[15:51] only hindrances. It ain't the devil. No,
[15:54] no, no. It ain't the devil. The devil
[15:56] don't have nothing to do with this.
[15:58] Amen. It's about you and I submitting to
[16:02] God and and and being uh able and
[16:06] willing to do all
[16:10] the scriptures has declared of us. Amen.
[16:12] Oh, Amen.
[16:17] But I'm going tell
[16:19] you, there's a mystery behind
[16:23] this. And that that thing, and I forgot
[16:26] which brother preached it, but I've been
[16:27] saying it ever since. There's a
[16:29] difference between being saved
[16:32] and redeemed. Amen.
[16:35] There's a lot of people that's going to
[16:37] come up saved.
[16:40] But there's only a few in this age
[16:43] that's been redeemed. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[16:46] Redeemer means I came from God. I go
[16:49] back to God. Hallelujah. But being
[16:53] saved is like picking up somebody who
[16:57] gave you a drink of water in the name of
[16:59] the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah.
[17:04] Amen. Come on, somebody. Amen. Amen. And
[17:07] God rewards them for being good to you
[17:11] and me. Amen. All
[17:15] right. So when you look at this thing,
[17:18] it ain't I'm working with the redeemed
[17:20] right now. Amen. You are blessed. Amen.
[17:24] First of all, you hear you have heard
[17:27] the message of the hour.
[17:30] Now God didn't make no mistake. Now God
[17:33] hasn't made a mistake. He never will and
[17:35] he never can. Now my point is if God has
[17:39] called you, you have you are a candidate
[17:43] for the rapture.
[17:47] Amen. You are a candidate for the rap
[17:50] for the rapture. And it is only you. You
[17:53] you you the only one that can hinder it.
[17:58] You being raptured. Amen. Because the
[18:01] five wise and foolish heard the same
[18:05] cry.
[18:07] One was
[18:08] dormatory. One was about their own
[18:10] business. The other one was about the
[18:13] father's business. Amen. You have not
[18:15] been called to this message to how can I
[18:19] say it? To be so successful in this
[18:21] world. You have been called this message
[18:24] only to prepare yourself to be raptured.
[18:28] Amen. Amen. That is your highest
[18:30] calling. That ought to be your highest
[18:33] priority. Christ. Amen. God. Let me move
[18:37] on. Now, the Bible tell us, we read that
[18:40] if you lose your life, you'll find it.
[18:44] If you try to save it, you're going to
[18:47] lose it.
[18:49] Amen. Huh? Come on, somebody. I don't
[18:51] want to live like that right now. I want
[18:54] to be Christian, but if you save it,
[19:01] you lose it. Amen.
[19:03] Like I was taught this morning, I said,
[19:05] "Here it was." Let me ask you a
[19:08] question. God
[19:10] gives
[19:12] Enra and Yet a child at a time when
[19:16] Egypt is killing all male children.
[19:22] All and God has promised them a child.
[19:27] And we find out the Bible said when when
[19:29] this baby was born, it was a bad
[19:31] average. He was a good-looking baby.
[19:34] Now, you got to understand when a baby
[19:36] is good-look at birth, that means
[19:38] they're going to be good-looking
[19:39] afterwards, right? Amen. And this baby
[19:43] was really a good-look baby. And now I
[19:45] am this and that. Amen. They they they
[19:47] they they got to hide this baby. I love
[19:51] it. And now because you know they know
[19:54] that if Pharaoh or those old
[19:57] um maids would find out that they got a
[20:00] child that they would kill it. Now
[20:02] understand this. They weren't just
[20:04] throwing the babies out into the Nile,
[20:06] which they did to some, and the
[20:08] crocodiles would eat them. But there was
[20:10] some of those midwives that were so
[20:12] wicked they would literally take the
[20:14] babies from the womb and smash their
[20:15] head against the
[20:17] wall. So there was jeopardy. It was a
[20:20] time, Amen. that uh you it should have
[20:23] put fear. Amen. In uh uh uh Abraham and
[20:27] Joseph uh Yoshaphat, but I always get
[20:29] her name mixed up. Anyway, she did not
[20:32] fear the king. Amen. Lord has orders.
[20:35] She had prayed and this is what I said.
[20:38] Israel would have never been delivered
[20:41] even though the word said that there
[20:43] will come a a rescue, a deliverer after
[20:46] 400 years. But you know what? They had
[20:50] to get in desperation.
[20:53] You know what I'm saying? And you'll
[20:54] never get where you desire to be in
[20:57] Christ until you get desperate.
[21:00] And when you get desperate, nothing else
[21:03] matter. Hallelujah. You become so
[21:05] focused on what you're trying to achieve
[21:07] and what you want from God, you could
[21:09] care about nothing. Nothing. Nothing.
[21:12] Job, children, family, money, nothing
[21:15] matters to you. But I've got to reach
[21:17] God in this way. Amen. Because I need
[21:20] his help. And that's the way uh uh uh uh
[21:23] it was with Amram and his wife. Amen.
[21:26] They got so desperate. Lord, look how
[21:28] they doing us. They treat us this way.
[21:30] Oh God, you promise. See, they saw a
[21:32] promise. Amen. Lord, you promise a
[21:34] deliverer. You deliver. Amen. Crying out
[21:37] day and night. Amen. And then God come
[21:40] down and says, "Listen, I've chosen you.
[21:43] You'll bring forth the deliverer." Amen.
[21:45] Hallelujah. So when God brings you a
[21:48] promise and that promise come to pass,
[21:50] you don't care what nobody else says.
[21:53] All is well. Amen. All is well. And
[21:56] that's what happening and they cried
[21:58] out. So when the baby came, they weren't
[22:00] fearing. But think about it. They wanted
[22:02] to keep them safe until they could hear
[22:04] another word from God. And I can see it.
[22:07] Amen. The baby come and I love the way
[22:09] brother said. He said that baby went to
[22:12] cry. I had little Jonathan laughing in
[22:14] that one. Amen. Crying out, "Amen." You
[22:17] know, and here, you know, the soldiers
[22:19] walk by all of a sudden the baby
[22:23] go. Oh my goodness. And what happened?
[22:26] They would run and hide the baby and
[22:28] stuff like that. And then and they never
[22:30] the one thing about the devil, he just
[22:31] don't know how to look up.
[22:35] And then right above his head was a
[22:37] basket hiding the baby.
[22:40] But you know what happened? God shared
[22:42] with him. says, "Now you give him up, I
[22:44] give him back to you." See, that's the
[22:47] same. Is that right? Amen. That's the
[22:50] same life. That's how when Samuel was
[22:52] born. Is that right? Amen. Hallelujah.
[22:55] Amen. She gave him back to God. But let
[22:57] me put Let me go on with this. That's
[23:00] how it is with your life. People think,
[23:02] well, if I come become a real Christian,
[23:04] I'm giving up everything. Yes. But my
[23:07] God, look what you're getting in return.
[23:09] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Look what
[23:12] you I've got I'm working on a message
[23:14] right now. In time. In time. I might
[23:17] meet preach that tonight. I'm not sure.
[23:18] In time. Don't you know everything in
[23:21] time
[23:23] ceases. In time. Everything in time
[23:26] ceases. Amen. You was born in this
[23:29] world, but you're going to leave this
[23:31] world. Your time will cease. Your time
[23:35] will stop. We call that death. Amen.
[23:38] Hallelujah. But if it's in
[23:41] eternity, there's no stopping it.
[23:44] There's no end to it because there's no
[23:46] beginning. Amen. So God is saying in
[23:49] time, if you give me your time now, I
[23:53] give you eternity. Amen.
[23:56] Amen. Amen. I give you eternity. That's
[23:59] all you need to do. Amen. I give you
[24:01] eternity if you give me your time. So we
[24:04] find out by the grace of God that's all
[24:07] they were doing. I gave up the
[24:11] child and I can almost see as a mother
[24:14] would. She was a good mother. I don't
[24:17] know how I got in this but here I am.
[24:19] Anyway, she comes along and and we find
[24:21] out guess what? God worked it out. Is
[24:23] that right? Whenever you seek God, God
[24:26] will work it out. Amen. And I loved it.
[24:29] Here it was.
[24:31] A lamb's and yet. Amen. Baby Moses was
[24:35] not being raised by his real mama.
[24:40] Y'all hear what I'm saying? You don't
[24:42] want to believe I'm saying right now we
[24:46] may have been given over and some of us
[24:49] was raised in Egypt. Hallelujah. But
[24:52] right now, we're being fed by a real
[24:54] mama. Amen. Hallelujah. Let me put it
[24:58] this way. This mystery is so great. This
[25:00] is what Paul is saying. Even the mystery
[25:02] which had been hid from the ages and
[25:05] from generations. So I'm going to tell
[25:07] you a little about the
[25:08] mystery. Here was God decided to make a
[25:13] man in his own
[25:15] image. Right? Amen. But before he made
[25:19] man, there was all kinds of beasts and
[25:22] animals, male and female. But here was
[25:25] Adam who represented
[25:28] God with a shell on him with a mask, a
[25:33] housing, however you want to put it. But
[25:36] it was like when you saw Adam, you saw
[25:38] God.
[25:40] Amen. Because he's made Adam to rule
[25:42] over all the earthly things. Amen.
[25:46] But there was a mystery hidden in in
[25:48] Adam.
[25:50] In Adam was a filthy spirit.
[25:54] She was to be called Adam, too. Yes.
[25:57] Amen. Right. Hallelujah. When she was
[26:02] Let me back up. So, nobody knew what was
[26:05] in Adam cuz nobody knew what was in God.
[26:08] Amen. I don't even believe the servants,
[26:11] the child, and all of the creatures of
[26:14] heaven understood what God was all about
[26:16] because now God is unfolding himself in
[26:19] a way that he's never done before.
[26:22] We don't know how long they had been inh
[26:25] heaven, but we find out to men that God
[26:27] was doing something because here Alan
[26:29] stands alone and God's telling his
[26:33] story. I was alone and all of these
[26:36] attributes I had. I was able to create
[26:39] everything, but there is something still
[26:42] lacking. It's not good for Adam to be
[26:44] alone. Amen. Amen. But I want to show
[26:48] you a mystery here. Come on, somebody.
[26:50] Amen. There was one time when hell was
[26:53] being fallen out of the dust of the
[26:55] earth. The Bible said God breathed
[27:00] into the breath of life. Amen. I want
[27:03] you to understand that that light was
[27:06] the fire of God. Amen. Amen. Yes, it
[27:09] was. But here's the
[27:12] mystery.
[27:13] Adam now stood as a lamb, but he also
[27:18] had a feminine spirit in him. Amen. Yes.
[27:21] And God wanted to
[27:23] take Eve, we say Eve so we can
[27:26] understand, out of Adam, right? What did
[27:30] God do? God could have spoke the word
[27:33] and said, "Let it be." But God operated.
[27:38] He was the first surgeon. Don't tell me
[27:41] he wasn't. If he didn't operate, he
[27:43] wouldn't have put him to sleep.
[27:47] Hallelujah. Why did he put him to sleep?
[27:49] Because up to that point, Adam would
[27:51] have never known what pain was. Amen. If
[27:54] God had done it before his son, he might
[27:57] have been painful.
[28:01] So God put him to sleep. And Adam was
[28:04] the first and only man that had a room.
[28:09] God gave Adam a temporary room. Open it
[28:13] up. Pull it out. Come on, somebody. and
[28:18] sealed it back up. Glory. So, not only
[28:21] was Eve his wife, but Adam was the
[28:25] mother of Eve.
[28:28] Amen. Come on, somebody. You say that
[28:30] can't be. Why did God said leave your
[28:33] mother and your father and plead to each
[28:36] other? Because God was the mother of
[28:38] Adam
[28:40] and father of Adam.
[28:45] Come on, somebody. Amen. So Eve came
[28:48] from
[28:49] Adam and she went back to Adam. Come on
[28:53] somebody. And then the connection could
[28:55] not. Why was God doing this? God showed
[28:58] that there would be a breach. Yes. Amen.
[29:02] Between Adam and Eve.
[29:06] But he also showed it was almost like
[29:08] prophecy. He showed that between because
[29:11] of Adam and Eve. This is what I'm going
[29:13] to do to restore Amen. myself or to
[29:17] bring back the relationship that we had
[29:21] from the beginning. Oh Lord. Amen. Thank
[29:24] you, Lord. Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[29:27] Amen.
[29:28] Because we we got to recognize. Amen.
[29:31] That is why God showed the difference
[29:34] between the sons,
[29:38] the one that came from
[29:40] Adam and the one that came from the
[29:42] serpent. Come on, somebody. This is why
[29:45] you say, "Oh, Eve says, I I got a man
[29:49] child from the
[29:52] Lord." Because she said it didn't make
[29:55] it right. But let me put it this way.
[29:58] Everything that comes comes from the
[29:59] Lord. Yeah. Amen. Hallelujah. Why didn't
[30:02] she
[30:04] say it came
[30:07] from Adam? Amen. Because when it came to
[30:11] Seth, she didn't say that God got a man
[30:14] child from the Lord. She said, "God has
[30:16] appointed me another seat." Amen. Amen.
[30:20] Come on, somebody. Why? She was tying
[30:22] that seed to her husband's seed. Oh,
[30:25] come on, somebody. Amen. Hallelujah. So,
[30:28] you got to realize by the grace of God,
[30:30] God was so we would understand the
[30:33] battle before. In order to understand
[30:35] what's happening here, Satan or Lucifer
[30:37] said, "I'm going to exalt myself above
[30:39] the thrones of God and I am going to
[30:41] cause the stars of God to worship." You
[30:44] understand, right? And we preach here
[30:46] before, amen, that Lucifer never said
[30:49] with his mouth, the Bible say, "You have
[30:51] said in your heart that you're going to
[30:53] do these things." Amen. Right? So in his
[30:56] heart, God caught the iniquity in his
[30:58] heart and cast him out. He saw a great
[31:00] man made a mistake when he said
[31:02] twothirds of the angels fell. No, sir.
[31:04] He did not. Amen. There's a third in the
[31:06] beginning, which was the alpha, and
[31:08] there's a third in the end, which is the
[31:09] Omega. Amen. This is what we're seeing
[31:12] now. Angels falling. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[31:18] Oh, come on, somebody. So, he shows the
[31:21] difference that through this battle, you
[31:24] can't fight yourself. So, you got to
[31:26] have an opponent. Amen. So God allowed
[31:30] Lucifer to come in this uh dimension, a
[31:34] dimension by way of Cain to show the
[31:38] battle that took four place in heaven.
[31:40] Amen. But God had already showed how he
[31:43] was going to restore Eve. Amen. How did
[31:45] he restore Eve?
[31:48] By Adam coming down and impregnating
[31:51] her. Glory. Amen. Hallelujah. He saved
[31:55] her by planting his seed. Oh Lord,
[31:59] that's how God saved you. Amen. He saved
[32:02] you by impanting his seed in you. Come
[32:06] on. And you and I be calling the Holy
[32:08] Ghost. Amen.
[32:12] Amen.
[32:14] Come on, somebody. Amen. Hallelujah.
[32:17] [Music]
[32:19] This is the mystery.
[32:23] And let me say it like
[32:26] this. It amazed me always when I read
[32:30] that
[32:31] scripture when Adam and
[32:33] Eve, they're blaming
[32:36] everybody but
[32:38] themselves. And even Adam, now listen.
[32:43] Adam says to God, "The woman you gave
[32:50] me, he he's saying to God, because Adam
[32:53] didn't deceive now, the Bible said he
[32:55] willfully did it." But instead of
[32:57] saying, "Lord, I'm guilty. I willfully
[32:59] did it." He blamed God for what he did.
[33:03] Now, you got to understand, Adam
[33:06] understood that God was in full control.
[33:11] God. Adam understood that God was not
[33:14] ignorant and he knew what was going to
[33:16] happen. Amen. See, Adam wasn't he wasn't
[33:20] blind to his statement. He knew
[33:25] he may not have fully I don't know how
[33:26] much understanding, but you got to
[33:28] understand up to the point of his
[33:30] failures, Adam was in this theophony.
[33:33] Hallelujah.
[33:35] Amen. That's why he couldn't sin. He
[33:38] sinned willfully. He wasn't shrink into
[33:40] it. He understood. And the prophet of
[33:41] God said, "You know all things." Amen.
[33:43] Didn't he say that? Not only that, the
[33:45] scripture said to his disciples, "You
[33:48] know all things." How you going to know
[33:50] all things? Amen. Because in your word
[33:53] body, you know. Amen. That's right. Let
[33:57] me move on. I'm I'm I'm just so I'm
[33:59] looking at this and I'm saying, "But
[34:00] united with him." That's how Let me put
[34:02] it this way. The eagle or the eaglet was
[34:08] born an eagle. Birth an eagle. Hello.
[34:12] Now when you got the when you are born
[34:14] again of the Holy Ghost, you are born an
[34:17] eagle. Amen.
[34:20] Amen. You never understand the cry until
[34:24] that seed is quickened. Amen. A dead
[34:26] seed is a dead seed. A dormant seed is a
[34:29] dormant seed. Amen. But when you hear
[34:32] the evil cry Something quickens that.
[34:36] Hallelujah. Oh, come on, somebody. Now
[34:38] you're on your journey.
[34:42] The Bible says, "When we preach and warn
[34:45] every man and teaching every man in all
[34:48] wisdom that we may present every man
[34:52] perfect in Christ Jesus." Amen.
[34:57] You know what also is in the
[35:01] Hebrew when it says that God took Adam
[35:04] or took Eve out of Adam, it says he
[35:07] brought her from the fire of God.
[35:13] God reached down. I ain't talking about
[35:15] the flesh part, but there see God is
[35:18] fire the Lord. And all God did were like
[35:20] he did on the day of Pentecost. He took
[35:23] one pill of fire and divided it. Amen.
[35:26] Hallelujah. He didn't take another fire.
[35:28] You see what I'm saying? As it started,
[35:31] it must end. If he brought Eve from the
[35:33] fire, he must bring her back to the
[35:36] fire. Amen. That's why John said that
[35:39] God will baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[35:42] and fire. Amen. Amen. You were fire in
[35:45] the in the beginning. You must be fire
[35:48] in the end. Hallelujah. Now you say,
[35:50] "Well, I'm not brother." Listen, as I
[35:52] said, you got cosmic light in you, and
[35:54] that ain't nothing but fire.
[35:57] Amen. But it's a different kind of fire.
[36:00] Y'all hear what I'm saying? God want the
[36:02] Holy Ghost and fire on the inside of
[36:04] you. Amen. Now, you say, "What do you
[36:06] mean?" Let's move on. See, there's only
[36:09] one way to be a Christian. And the word
[36:12] Christian means
[36:14] Christike. And you can't do it. You
[36:16] can't work it it in yourself. There's no
[36:19] way at at all you can do it. You have to
[36:22] forget yourself. Die out to yourself and
[36:25] let Christ come in and live the life of
[36:27] Christ in you. Amen. And by way of
[36:30] experience, let me tell you something.
[36:32] When you get desperate enough and you
[36:34] start crying out to God, you know what
[36:36] God does? He first send that fire to
[36:39] purge everything out of you. Amen. And
[36:42] you what you do? The fire of God comes
[36:44] in and is cleansing you and every sin,
[36:49] every secret sin, every thing comes up
[36:53] in your memory and you have to say yes
[36:56] Lord, take it. Yes. Yes, Lord. Deliver
[36:59] me. Yes, Lord. That's it. See, the Holy
[37:02] Ghost come in like the Bible say like a
[37:04] sword. It divides the the marrow of the
[37:07] bone. It comes right into the history of
[37:09] your life and it pulls up everything
[37:12] that you've got to get rid of. Yes. And
[37:14] you can tell God yes or you can tell him
[37:17] no. Amen. But in that process, he's
[37:20] literally sanctifying you and cleansing
[37:24] you from all those wicked things. And
[37:26] when he finish cleansing you and then
[37:29] he'll send you an assurance of the Holy
[37:31] Ghost and you'll know it. Amen. Amen.
[37:35] When the change come you know it
[37:38] something happens on the inside that you
[37:40] cannot even explain. Amen. And you are
[37:43] you get up like a strong man. Yes. Amen.
[37:48] Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah. Amen.
[37:52] Glory to God. Is that right? So Eve
[37:55] comes out of the womb of
[37:58] Adam. You know we we never looked at it
[38:00] like that before, have we? But that's
[38:02] the truth cuz that's where we come from
[38:04] God.
[38:07] Huh? Oh my. You look at that thing. It's
[38:10] It's powerful to me. Now listen, people
[38:12] say, and it's nothing wrong with being
[38:16] crazy when it's dealing with God. Amen.
[38:19] Right. Oh, come on, somebody. It's the
[38:22] truth. When you and I was out in the
[38:24] world, some of us, some of us, they
[38:25] forgot we were out there. But when we
[38:27] were out there, we were out there. Amen.
[38:33] And we did such crazy stuff.
[38:38] Oh, I was just outright buffoon. Amen.
[38:44] And I'll be honest with you, I'll be out
[38:45] there and I whatever would come to mind,
[38:47] I'd do it. Cuz I was a clown. I was the
[38:50] one that brought the laughter.
[38:53] Yeah. He's delivered me now. You hadn't
[38:55] heard me do a lot of that in a long
[38:56] time, right? God has delivered me. Why?
[38:59] because it was just part of my nature to
[39:02] cut up some. But when it comes, amen, to
[39:05] to to this thing, God comes along and
[39:08] and says, "Listen, it's all right. It's
[39:10] okay to be crazy." I was telling
[39:12] somebody the other day, I'm willing to
[39:14] do whatever God wants me to do right
[39:15] now. Amen. I do whatever Ezekiel, he
[39:18] said, Lord, lay on your side. That's
[39:20] what I'll do. Whatever he wants me to
[39:22] do, that's where I'm at. So, I'm looking
[39:24] at this thing. I'm saying, listen, it's
[39:26] all right to be crazy. How many of y'all
[39:28] have seen people in the corner preaching
[39:31] on the corner and you you know right the
[39:35] only way you can do that is that you got
[39:36] to become crazy for Lord for the Lord.
[39:41] Amen.
[39:43] You would your pride will not allow you
[39:45] to do that.
[39:49] Oh it ain't going to do it. And you know
[39:51] what you ride by those people you say
[39:53] Lord bless. And we ought to be saying
[39:54] Lord bless you.
[39:58] Why? Because that individual has gotten
[40:00] so in love with Christ. That's all
[40:03] they're thinking about. Amen. It's their
[40:05] walk. It's their talk. It's their life.
[40:08] That's all it is. You say, "What do you
[40:11] mean to be united?" I'm talking about to
[40:13] be united.
[40:16] Huh? Amen.
[40:19] I'm talking about being united so much
[40:21] with God, you don't live anymore. Amen.
[40:24] Amen. You said, "How can that be
[40:26] possible?" Just like it was in the
[40:28] beginning, all you saw was Adam even
[40:31] though Eve was there. Amen.
[40:34] Come on, somebody. You saw Adam. You
[40:36] didn't know Eve was there. Preacher,
[40:39] brother. And that's why God is saying,
[40:40] "I want it to be so that all people can
[40:43] see is me and not you." That was the
[40:46] beginning and that must be the end.
[40:48] Hallelujah. Amen.
[40:50] You can't do this, but the Holy Ghost
[40:52] can. That's all I'm saying. If I'm
[40:54] laying a burden on you, wonderful. Get
[40:57] it off your shoulders by praying.
[40:59] Hallelujah. And seeking God says, "Lord,
[41:02] this is the way I want to be." Amen.
[41:04] God's the only kind that'll make a
[41:05] rapture. That's right. Amen. It's the
[41:08] only kind. You want your life in God's
[41:10] life, too. It can't be. Because I'm
[41:12] going tell you something. Without
[41:13] Pentecost, without the baptism of the
[41:15] Holy Ghost or the sealing of the Holy
[41:16] Ghost, however you want to say it,
[41:17] you'll go back to fishing like Peter
[41:19] did. Amen. Amen. with all the miracles,
[41:22] with all the signs and wonders they saw
[41:24] in their life, they did not have the
[41:26] power to go on. And when they thought he
[41:28] was dead, they went back to their old
[41:31] occupation. And that's exactly what we
[41:33] do. When you think and thought you had
[41:36] the Holy Ghost and you coming up short,
[41:37] what happens? You go back to doing what
[41:39] you was doing before you started. Amen.
[41:43] Hello. Yes, sir. That's exactly what we
[41:46] do.
[41:50] But when Peter got the Holy
[41:52] Ghost, there was a major change in it.
[41:55] Hallelujah. There was such a major
[41:57] change in when he went down to the gate
[41:59] of beautiful and he saw a man be
[42:03] sealed. And he said, "Silver and gold
[42:06] have I none, but such as I have give
[42:09] thee." He had something folks before he
[42:12] didn't have it. You said, "What do you
[42:15] mean?" Jesus breathed on them. Yes.
[42:18] Amen. When Jesus breathed on them, you
[42:20] know he's
[42:22] receive you the Holy Ghost. What was he
[42:24] doing? He was showing I'm the same God.
[42:28] Amen. That breathe in Adam's nostrils.
[42:30] Hallelujah. I'm the same God I am. By
[42:34] the way, Paul picked it up. Call him the
[42:36] second Adam. Hallelujah. Amen. He
[42:40] breathe. He was breeding to him. Oh,
[42:42] come on, somebody. He stood there in the
[42:45] world. Hallelujah. And he said to the
[42:48] world, "If you are lost, you would ask
[42:51] me for drink." Come on. Is that the
[42:54] truth? That's what happened there in the
[42:56] garden in the wilderness. He said, "I am
[42:58] that rock."
[43:00] Hallelujah. And while the same rock,
[43:03] hallelujah, is standing at the well and
[43:06] said, "I am the water from that rock."
[43:09] And if you ask, I'll give it to you.
[43:12] Glory to God. That's where it was going.
[43:15] If there be enemy, if any man thirst,
[43:17] let him come and get drink of me. I am
[43:20] the same. I said I water in that day.
[43:24] I'm still doing the same. He said, but
[43:26] listen, it doesn't just I put the water
[43:29] in. Hallelujah. So that out of no
[43:33] sh I live in you and you'll never thirst
[43:37] again. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[43:41] Amen.
[43:44] Glory. Hallelujah. United with him.
[43:49] If you feel still thirsting, what are
[43:52] you thirsting for?
[43:54] Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. Amen. Now
[43:58] listen what happens. God don't want just
[44:01] Christians. We got a lot of Christians
[44:03] like we got potato chips.
[44:08] A lot of Christians. Amen. But God wants
[44:11] people that are very they want people
[44:14] like him. Amen. My goodness. You go to
[44:17] an apple tree and it's a and it's a what
[44:19] they call a ruby red apple. Come on.
[44:21] You're not going to find no other apple
[44:23] in that tree. You're not going to find a
[44:25] gay, you're not going to find unless
[44:27] they done grafted it in. But coming from
[44:29] the original root of the tree, all
[44:32] that's coming up on that tree will be
[44:34] ruby red.
[44:36] Amen. That's how God is. His tree. He is
[44:39] the tree of life. Hallelujah.
[44:43] Oh, you got to realize he's the tree of
[44:44] life. And here he stood there in the
[44:48] garden. Come on, somebody. And what
[44:50] happened was when Adam sinned, the Holy
[44:53] Ghost had to depart. Yes. Yes, sir.
[44:56] That's why the Holy Ghost had to come
[44:57] back. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The very
[45:00] title deed. The one that gives you
[45:02] authority. Hallelujah. Haven't lost his
[45:04] authority. But Jesus said after which
[45:07] the Holy Ghost has come upon you, you
[45:09] shall receive power. And that power
[45:11] means authority. Hallelujah. The very
[45:14] thing Adam lost, the second Adam was
[45:15] given back to you. The first Adam was a
[45:18] ugly
[45:19] man. What does he say? I'm fire. I'm God
[45:23] and he is life. He said it. I am the
[45:26] life. That's why when Jesus walked
[45:28] around, he was what? The tree of life.
[45:30] Amen.
[45:32] That's what he said. Amen. Amen. He
[45:34] said, "I am the life." I am the truth. I
[45:37] am the way. Amen. Is that right? How
[45:40] could he say that when the tree of life,
[45:42] listen, what was happening here is that
[45:44] if Adam and Eve had touched and eat up
[45:46] that tree, they would have continued to
[45:48] live in such a bad state.
[45:53] They were always still sons and
[45:54] daughters. Come on. Amen.
[45:59] But God wanted them to come back to a
[46:00] holiness. Yes. Amen.
[46:04] Holiness. Amen.
[46:09] Everybody all right? Amen. So when we
[46:12] look at this thing, we say, "What do you
[46:13] mean?" Listen, I'm just trying to tell
[46:15] us something here. A lot of us believe
[46:17] that, oh, because we just believe this
[46:19] message, it's all finished. It ain't
[46:20] finished. It's not finished till you
[46:22] totally sealed and you know that you're
[46:24] sealed. It is the sealing of God that
[46:26] puts you in a place of safety. It ain't
[46:29] your religion. It ain't how much you pay
[46:31] your tithe. How much you listen to the
[46:33] message is how much like I like the
[46:35] Bible says, "Oh, I'm in the message."
[46:36] That ain't the question. Is the message
[46:38] in you. Amen. Right. Because the Paul
[46:40] said, we are living epistles written and
[46:42] led by all men. Hallelujah. You become
[46:45] the word and the word become you and
[46:48] you're living it. Yes. Living it.
[46:50] Hallelujah.
[46:53] Amen. Right. And the unconditional
[46:56] covenant. He said, "That's right. People
[46:57] say the people are crazy. The reason
[46:59] they are, they haven't got the mind of
[47:02] the world anymore. They got the mind of
[47:05] Christ. Christ in you, the hope of
[47:08] glory. Your secure anchored away. He
[47:11] that heareth my word believeth on him
[47:13] that sent me having everlasting life.
[47:16] When right now, and shall not come into
[47:19] condemnation, but is passed from death
[47:22] to life. Is that right? Now he's passed
[47:25] from death to life. You know what I
[47:27] heard the father of God say the other
[47:28] day? He said, "If you don't live it, you
[47:30] don't believe it." Amen.
[47:33] That's the truth. Come on.
[47:36] If you don't live it, you don't believe
[47:37] it. You hear it, but you don't believe
[47:39] it.
[47:41] Amen. Oh my good times. He said,
[47:43] "Listen, God seen what the end would be
[47:47] from the beginning. And the Lord has
[47:49] come to the earth which was Christ the
[47:51] word spoken word of God put part of God
[47:56] part of God and is made flesh and
[47:59] dwelleth among us. And they when we and
[48:02] and then when we come out of Christ
[48:05] which makes the same life that was in
[48:07] God. Now now I don't mean no harm. You
[48:11] don't mean to tell me that God can
[48:13] control everything with his life. Amen.
[48:18] He took Jesus, put his life in him. He
[48:21] was God the fullness of the Godhead
[48:23] bodily walking in a man and he had
[48:26] control over everything. And now God put
[48:29] the same life in you and you don't have
[48:32] control. Something ain't right. Sounds
[48:35] like an impostor somewhere.
[48:38] Amen. And that's really when you receive
[48:41] the sealing of the Holy Ghost, you
[48:43] actually receive perfect faith. Amen.
[48:46] Amen. Amen. Because it's no longer your
[48:49] faith, it's his. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[48:55] And you got to die out to your own
[48:57] fears, your own reasoning. Come on,
[48:59] somebody. So that perfect faith can live
[49:02] its fullest potential. Amen. Amen. Y'all
[49:05] hear what I'm saying?
[49:09] Am I making sense?
[49:11] Listen, I'm not You know what I'm what
[49:13] I'm trying to do? I'm trying to
[49:15] encourage everybody, but I'm also saying
[49:17] I'm I'm looking I'm telling these things
[49:18] so you can look deep inside of yourself
[49:21] and says, God, is it real? Amen. Do I
[49:23] have it? Am I a hypocrite? Is it real?
[49:27] You know, if I'm I'm not living the full
[49:30] potential, God, help me. If I can just
[49:32] by this message set in a desperation in
[49:35] your soul, then I the Lord has
[49:37] accomplished what he wants. Amen. That's
[49:39] good. Hallelujah. Because we realize
[49:42] that only desperation going to get you
[49:43] out of here. Amen. Hallelujah. Y'all
[49:47] hear what I'm saying?
[49:49] Amen.
[49:53] So what he said, he said that part the
[49:55] part of God was made flesh and dwelt
[49:56] among us and then we come we come out of
[50:00] Christ which makes the same life that
[50:02] was in God in Christ in you. And just as
[50:06] sure as God raised this up, we've got to
[50:10] come with the same thing. Amen. He said
[50:13] we got to come with the same thing.
[50:16] Amen.
[50:17] If the same spirits in us because it's
[50:20] the spirit of God making us sons and
[50:23] daughters of God. Amen. Yes. Hey,
[50:27] doesn't it make you jealous to see what
[50:30] Moses and Joshua and some of the others
[50:33] in the Old Testament did? And they were
[50:36] just under the blood of bulls and goats
[50:38] and and things of that nature. And yet
[50:41] here there was God with them. But we
[50:44] supposed to have God in us. Amen. Amen.
[50:48] You mean to tell me the God that's with
[50:49] you is greater than the God that's in
[50:51] you?
[50:53] Oh, no. No, no, no. Why?
[50:56] Because the God is that that's with you
[50:58] walks with you, talks with you. But the
[51:01] God in you is you. Amen.
[51:05] Huh? That's why I said you got to die
[51:07] daily. Daily. Who if you give the flesh
[51:10] life, it's going to live it. Amen.
[51:14] Amen. Y'all hear what I'm
[51:17] saying? If you It's like a dog that's
[51:19] been chained up. I don't care how much
[51:22] that dog love you. Y'all remember what
[51:24] I'm talking about? You had a dog that
[51:25] hadn't changed up for a long time. You
[51:27] never lose him. He's gone. That's right.
[51:30] Out the yard. He's down the road. Down.
[51:32] You want to come back? Come back. That
[51:34] dog says now I'm experience freedom
[51:37] right here. Liberty. I ain't coming like
[51:40] that. Is that it? That's just how the
[51:42] flesh is. Amen. That's just how the
[51:45] flesh. You let him off the chain.
[51:48] He going to run. And you know sometime
[51:50] they don't come back and take two, three
[51:52] days before they show back up.
[51:54] Oh my god.
[51:57] Y'all know it's the truth. Yeah, it's
[51:59] the truth. And that's how your flesh is.
[52:02] Amen. You let him off the chain, he's
[52:04] going to do, he going to go rampant and
[52:06] he's going to do whatever he wants to do
[52:08] until he gets tired. And understand the
[52:10] flesh, the flesh, nothing satisfies the
[52:13] flesh.
[52:18] I don't care what it is, it never
[52:19] satisfy. Y'all know what I'm talking
[52:21] about? Amen. Well, one of the worst
[52:22] things you can do is dream of something.
[52:25] Let's say fried chicken and you thinking
[52:27] about Popeyes. Well, it's going to be
[52:28] good today. And you go to Popeye's and
[52:30] you get the worst parts of the chicken.
[52:34] It ain't good. They season it the same
[52:37] way. They fried it the same way. But
[52:40] whatever it is that's going on in the
[52:41] daytime, it ain't tasting just like you
[52:44] dreamed it.
[52:47] Come on, somebody. Y'all know that's the
[52:49] truth. That's exactly what with the
[52:51] flesh. It'll get you in trouble. And I'm
[52:54] going tell you something. The taste of
[52:55] what sin is never as good as you thought
[52:58] it was going to be. Amen. Never. You
[53:01] leave out disappointed every time.

[53:24] Amen. Cuz one day I'm going to get
[53:26] carried away. Hallelujah.
[53:30] Hallelujah. Is that all right? Now I
[53:32] look at those things and I'm not going
[53:34] to be long. I try not to be too much
[53:35] longer, brother. We look at this thing.

[53:44] individual is your responsibility to
[53:45] come up the ladder. Amen.

[53:57] virtue, knowledge, temples all the way
[53:59] up." Amen. To brotherly kind of been
[54:01] capped off with the with with uh the uh
[54:03] charity. I can't take you there. Brother

[54:21] yourself, you got to die. Amen. Amen.
[54:25] You got to die. You got to give it up.
[54:28] Every bit, every speck. That's why the
[54:31] father of God said, "If a speck of the
[54:33] world is in you, the love of God is
[54:34] not." And I tell you what, that's what
[54:36] I've been saying. Lord God, don't leave
[54:38] a speck. Don't leave nothing.
[54:40] Hallelujah. Let me circumcise. Cut off.

[55:15] Brooks, I let me say it like this, and
[55:19] I'm going to say it just like God
[55:20] brought it to
[55:21] me. The Jesus that most people believed
[55:25] in is dead and
[55:28] rotten." I said, "God, how can you say
[55:31] that?" He said, just like I told him,
[55:33] the banner, don't keep it over. Amen.
[55:37] Amen. Don't keep the manner.
[55:40] Come on. Jesus said, "I am that bread
[55:43] that came down from heaven, but that
[55:46] same bread died and rotted." Yes, sir.
[55:50] Come on. Because they kept it over. But
[55:53] God is a progressive God. Well, my mom
[55:56] is this. My dad is God don't care about
[55:58] that. He talks about the daily bread.
[56:01] Give us this day our daily bread. You
[56:04] can't eat what they ate last year, year
[56:07] before then, or whatever age that was
[56:09] in.
[56:10] What was good for Luther was good for
[56:12] Luther and Wesley and all the rest of
[56:14] them. But we're living in a different
[56:15] day. Amen.
[56:17] Hallelujah. If you worshiping that Jesus
[56:20] is not even alive. Amen. That's why you

[56:30] the right one, you going to see the
[56:31] miracles. You going to see the signs.
[56:33] You going to see the wonders even in
[56:35] your own life.
[56:37] Amen.
[56:40] Amen.
[56:44] Is that right? Amen. That day you shall
[56:46] know that I am in the Father and the
[56:47] Father is in me. I am you. You and me.
[56:50] There's the the spirit coming out of God
[56:53] manifested as the Lord come down, made
[56:56] flesh, dwelt among us, right? He died,
[56:58] resurrected, taken on on on the penalty
[57:01] of sin, raised up again, sat on the
[57:04] matter still on high at the right hand
[57:07] of God. And the Holy Spirit comes back.

[57:40] brother Bham said it like this. He said,
[57:43] "What is
[57:44] it?" It's a laundry ticket
[57:49] from the same piece of paper. From the
[57:52] same spirit. And when you get the Holy
[57:54] Ghost, all you do is you bring Adam back
[57:57] to Adam. Hallelujah. All you do is you

[58:05] marriage is supposed to be like anyhow.

[58:10] her." Why? Cuz Adam couldn't live
[58:11] without her.

[58:16] of Adam and Eve. Come on.
[58:19] Amen.

[58:37] this. It's a beautiful situation.
[58:41] It's a beautiful situation.
[58:46] Listen, give me a few more minutes. For
[58:49] by grace are you saved. Grace through
[58:52] faith and that not of yourself. I'm
[58:56] going to say something here. It is the
[58:58] gift of God. What's the gift of God?
[59:01] Grace. Yes. But faith is too because you
[59:05] can't have grace without faith or faith
[59:07] without grace.
[59:09] God gives you the faith it takes to
[59:11] overcome. Yes. Amen. Yes. Y'all hear
[59:14] what I'm saying? You cannot do it until
[59:17] God gives you the faith to do it. So you
[59:20] got to ask God, "Give me faith to die."
[59:24] Amen. Amen. That's it. Give me faith to
[59:28] die. Amen.
[59:30] To die to myself, to die to my will.
[59:33] Give me the grace, Lord. Give me
[59:35] understanding. Give me, show me how to
[59:37] come to this place. Amen. And God will
[59:40] show you. Because he's given you grace.
[59:43] That's why you ask him for it. Cuz he's
[59:45] given you grace to ask for it. And he
[59:48] said, "If you ask for anything in my
[59:49] name, believing that you're going to
[59:51] receive it." He said, "I'll give it to
[59:52] you." Amen.
[59:55] God can't ask you why you didn't
[59:57] overcome if he didn't make provisions
[59:59] for you to overcome. Amen.
[1:00:05] It's a gift of God, not at works, lest
[1:00:09] any man should boast. You know anybody
[1:00:11] that's overcome that can boast? Oh, you
[1:00:15] can't boast. Amen. Boast in what? Jesus
[1:00:17] Christ only. Amen. Hallelujah. those 24
[1:00:21] hours when they saw the lamb take the
[1:00:23] brush. The Bible said they crew down
[1:00:25] their crown. They fell. Hallelujah.
[1:00:28] There was no boasting. No. Paul, Peter,
[1:00:31] James, John, none of them could b even
[1:00:33] though they the pillars of the church,
[1:00:35] they knew they overcome by the blood.
[1:00:39] Hallelujah.
[1:00:40] They understood. They came. They
[1:00:42] overcame by the blood and the water that
[1:00:45] testimony just like everybody else.
[1:00:48] Thank you, Lord. I tell you what, when
[1:00:50] you get the Holy Ghost and you sealed
[1:00:52] with the Holy Ghost, you can't boast.
[1:00:53] Yes, sir. Not a No, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:00:57] It was God's grace. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:01:01] Look at those people who was under John
[1:01:02] the Baptist. Uh uh uh uh uh. You think
[1:01:06] they would have had something. John the
[1:01:09] Baptist kind of like typed out the bride
[1:01:10] anyway, right? Because he was he was
[1:01:13] born with the Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:15] Born with the seed of God. Come on,
[1:01:17] somebody. Amen. So are you. Amen.
[1:01:20] And uh you know, you look at this thing,
[1:01:22] what do you mean? The same fire that was
[1:01:25] in John is in Jesus.
[1:01:29] Hallelujah. Amen. It took that same fire
[1:01:32] to give John uh insight to know in Jesus
[1:01:36] who Jesus was. That's true. Huh? So, you
[1:01:39] got something in you that let you know
[1:01:40] who Jesus is. You wouldn't be following
[1:01:43] this message if you didn't know who
[1:01:44] Jesus was. Amen.
[1:01:46] something new. That's the real Jesus.
[1:01:48] Amen.
[1:01:50] All right, let me move on. Amen. By
[1:01:54] grace you are saved through faith, not
[1:01:56] that of yourself. It is the gift of God.
[1:01:59] That's a powerful scripture. Not of
[1:02:01] works, lest any man should boast. For we
[1:02:03] are his
[1:02:04] workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
[1:02:08] into good works, unto good works, which
[1:02:10] God hath before ordained that we should
[1:02:14] walk in them. Oh, glory to God.
[1:02:17] Hallelujah. You got to understand,
[1:02:19] you've been ordained to walk in this.
[1:02:24] Amen. So what happens? You can run like
[1:02:27] Jonah.
[1:02:30] And the next thing the next thing you'll
[1:02:32] be taking a
[1:02:34] trip. The next thing you know, you'll be
[1:02:37] taking a trip. Amen. Right. In the belly
[1:02:40] of a lamb.
[1:02:42] Cry out, "God, have mercy on me."
[1:02:47] That's all right. If it takes a Jonah's
[1:02:50] experience to get you to repent, praise
[1:02:52] God. Let so be. Let it be. Amen. Amen.
[1:02:57] Hallelujah. See, God, if God done chose
[1:03:00] you to do a certain thing for him, he's
[1:03:02] not going to choose somebody else.
[1:03:04] You're it.
[1:03:08] Right. You're it. And he's going to do
[1:03:10] it. Amen. Regardless to what it takes,
[1:03:13] he's going to do it.
[1:03:15] Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. The only thing about
[1:03:18] it, brother, he he rewards you after you
[1:03:20] do it.
[1:03:24] Is this okay? Amen. Now, therefore, we
[1:03:27] are no more strangers and foreigners,
[1:03:31] but fellow citizens with the saints of
[1:03:34] the household of God. Uh,
[1:03:37] right. When you came, I was born. I was
[1:03:40] even the the the the son of Isaiah and
[1:03:44] Clara Brooks. Oh, I was born also of an
[1:03:47] American citizen. I didn't have to do
[1:03:50] nothing. Amen. To become an American. I
[1:03:54] was born one.
[1:03:56] Amen. Hallelujah. So when you're born
[1:03:59] into heaven, oh my God, you don't have
[1:04:02] to do nothing cuz you're born there and
[1:04:05] you have all the rights of heaven
[1:04:08] because you're a citizen.
[1:04:12] Come on, somebody.
[1:04:16] Oh my God. If we could just see that and
[1:04:19] take our faith. When God showed me that,
[1:04:22] I said, "Oo yeah." And I got a checkbook
[1:04:25] that I I won't have to ever ever
[1:04:28] reorder.
[1:04:30] I'm not gonna run out of checks.
[1:04:32] Hallelujah. No matter how many times I
[1:04:35] write. Hallelujah. Amen. It's like the
[1:04:37] man the woman's meeting. Replace
[1:04:38] yourself. Amen. Oh, glory. That's how it
[1:04:41] is. And I don't care what it is. I'm
[1:04:43] going to tell you something. This is so
[1:04:45] true. God puts this thing so simple in
[1:04:47] our face. And I'm going to stop in just
[1:04:48] a moment. God put this thing so simply.
[1:04:50] I'm talking about being united people.
[1:04:52] until we see these things in action in
[1:04:54] our lives personally. Amen. Come on.
[1:04:57] Come on. Because you're the church.
[1:04:59] Amen. As an individual, you are the
[1:05:02] church. Amen. We just churches coming
[1:05:04] together to make one church. But as an
[1:05:07] individual, you're the church. Amen.
[1:05:09] You're supposed to have worship going on
[1:05:11] in you all the time. Praise is going on
[1:05:13] in you all the time. Deliverances,
[1:05:16] healings wherever you go. You're the
[1:05:18] light of the world. And you're supposed
[1:05:20] to make a difference wherever you go.
[1:05:31] Let's end up on this one. Ephesians 3.
[1:05:34] Let's turn there. We're going to stop
[1:05:36] here. We finished this
[1:05:40] evening. Ephesians 3. Is this okay?
[1:05:43] Amen. It causes for
[1:05:47] desperation. Brother Balon preached a
[1:05:49] token. Then he preached the then he
[1:05:51] preached desperation. And in the message
[1:05:53] desperation, he talked about token
[1:05:54] message. He said that was the the the
[1:05:56] highlight of his ministry. Why? Because
[1:06:00] now the life of God has come back in its
[1:06:02] fullness to do what? Gather a
[1:06:05] bride. Hallelujah. You know, brother,
[1:06:08] oh, I've got a quote somewhere. I have
[1:06:10] to do it this evening.
[1:06:15] Oh, but brother talks about being born
[1:06:18] again under this
[1:06:20] message. And that's where a lot of
[1:06:22] people has failed. They've come to it,
[1:06:25] but they haven't been born again.
[1:06:28] The Pentecostals had a bo a birth, but
[1:06:30] it was just not deep enough. It was in
[1:06:32] the spirit. Hallelujah. Amen. But in
[1:06:35] this message is the only message that
[1:06:36] can bring you a birth in the soul
[1:06:39] because it's the only one that takes you
[1:06:41] beyond the veil.
[1:06:45] It takes you beyond the veil. Pentecost
[1:06:47] stop at the holy place. But this message
[1:06:49] take you into the holies of holies.
[1:06:51] Hallelujah.
[1:06:53] Why? Because they stopped at the
[1:06:54] speaking in tongues and shouting and
[1:06:56] dancing and all that and they thought
[1:06:57] they had it but they failed to see that
[1:06:58] the master hadn't come yet. Hallelujah.
[1:07:02] Amen. And when the word came, come on.
[1:07:05] It's like, it's like what happened?
[1:07:07] Isaac sent and and sent all the gifts to
[1:07:10] Rebecca. What if she said, "Oh my god,
[1:07:12] these gifts are so wonderful. I love
[1:07:13] these gifts, gifts, gifts, gifts." And
[1:07:15] never went to find uh Isaac.
[1:07:19] Something wrong. Something wrong. That's
[1:07:21] what Pentecost did. They took all the
[1:07:23] gifts and they thought they had the
[1:07:24] person and they didn't. They just had
[1:07:26] the gifts from the person.
[1:07:28] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:07:30] But the devil said, "I'm going to ride
[1:07:33] this
[1:07:34] cow. I'm going to ride this cow till I
[1:07:38] find the land
[1:07:40] who sent me the gifts."
[1:07:43] Amen. And when she saw him from a far
[1:07:46] off, the Bible say she jumped on. See,
[1:07:49] it's all right to jump. She jumped off.
[1:07:51] He said she lit off that camera and she
[1:07:54] didn't see she
[1:07:58] it wasn't really sad. He just took her
[1:08:00] right into his old mama's tent. Come on.
[1:08:03] When he took her into the mama's tent,
[1:08:05] you know, she was saying, "Give me that
[1:08:07] old time religion.
[1:08:09] Give me that old time religion. I don't
[1:08:11] want no new kind. Give me that old time
[1:08:14] religion. It's good enough for me." Oh.
[1:08:18] Glory to God. She didn't want all of
[1:08:21] this fancy stuff. She just wanted simple
[1:08:24] and plain.
[1:08:26] Come on. Hallelujah. They got all kind
[1:08:28] of cakes and stuff now. But I remember
[1:08:30] one time in my day, my mama could, we
[1:08:32] weren't rich. We didn't have a lot of
[1:08:34] money. And you know what she do? Make us
[1:08:36] a cake. And you know what would be the
[1:08:38] topping of it?
[1:08:41] Jelly. That was the best
[1:08:44] cake.
[1:08:46] Hallelujah. Them little apple jelly
[1:08:48] cakes. Oh my goodness. They don't make
[1:08:50] them like that no
[1:08:52] more. Hallelujah. Yeah. Somebody must
[1:08:55] know what I'm talking about. But that's
[1:08:57] the way it used to be. Spread that old
[1:08:59] jelly. Oh my
[1:09:01] goodness. Amen. Give me that old time
[1:09:03] religion. They got all kind of cakes
[1:09:06] now. Back in the day, they didn't have
[1:09:08] but too many, right? You either had a
[1:09:11] chocolate or jelly, some some kind of
[1:09:14] cake. Let me move on. Anyway, Ephesians,
[1:09:17] please. three. We're going to start at
[1:09:20] the first verse. You love the Lord.
[1:09:22] Amen. For this cause I Paul the prison
[1:09:24] of Jesus Christ for you
[1:09:26] Gentiles. If ye have heard of the
[1:09:29] dispensation of the grace of God which
[1:09:30] is given me to you would. How that by
[1:09:34] revelation he made known to me a mystery
[1:09:36] as I wrote a far in few words. Whereby
[1:09:39] when we read, you made understand my
[1:09:42] knowledge in the mystery of Christ,
[1:09:44] which in all the ages was not made known
[1:09:47] unto the son of men, as it is in now,
[1:09:50] revealed unto the Holy Ghost, holy
[1:09:52] apostles and prophets by the spirit. Let
[1:09:55] me say it like this. You know, a lot of
[1:09:56] time we're doing stuff for God and we
[1:09:57] don't even realize what we're doing.
[1:09:58] Amen. Did you know that? I mean, look at
[1:10:00] Judah. Look at Judah. Judah couldn't
[1:10:02] keep his hand off the Canaanite women.
[1:10:04] He couldn't Let put it away. Judah
[1:10:06] couldn't keep his hand off the Gentiles.
[1:10:08] Amen.
[1:10:10] He had no
[1:10:12] idea he was typing out Christ.
[1:10:18] And then when God got ready to establish
[1:10:21] his own priesthood, he bypassed the
[1:10:23] Leviticus priesthood.
[1:10:28] And where does the lion of the tribe of
[1:10:30] Judah come from? Amen. Hallelujah. Where
[1:10:34] does the lion of the tribe of Judah come
[1:10:36] from? Hallelujah.
[1:10:41] Amen. Because Jesus himself got a
[1:10:43] gentile bride. My God. My God.
[1:10:47] Hallelujah. So you a lot of times we
[1:10:49] don't even recognize things that God is
[1:10:52] leading us to do. Amen. Because there's
[1:10:54] an action for every reaction. Amen.
[1:10:56] Every action brings a reaction.
[1:10:59] Thank you, Lord. And God be doing stuff.
[1:11:02] Is that right?
[1:11:08] Thereby, when you read, ye made
[1:11:10] understand my knowledge in the mystery
[1:11:12] of Christ, which in other angels was
[1:11:14] made was not made known unto the sons of
[1:11:16] men, as it is now revealed unto us, the
[1:11:19] holy apostles and prophets by the
[1:11:20] spirit, that the Gentiles should be for
[1:11:23] fellow hes and of the same body and
[1:11:25] partakers of promise of his promise in
[1:11:28] Christ by the gospel. Let me put it this
[1:11:31] way. Don't you understand that what you
[1:11:33] and I believe there are other people who
[1:11:35] are actually perverting it. There are
[1:11:38] people in there who saying I'm the
[1:11:39] Christ. There are people who saying I am
[1:11:41] God. There are people who are saying
[1:11:43] these kind of things and they are
[1:11:44] perverting the gospel. Amen. Right? They
[1:11:47] have no power. They have no credentials.
[1:11:49] They have nothing to vindicate that they
[1:11:51] are.
[1:11:53] But Jesus said, "You want to crucify me
[1:11:55] or persecute me because I call myself
[1:11:57] the son of God?" That's what Jesus said.
[1:12:00] He said, "But is it not written in your
[1:12:02] own law who the word of God comes to
[1:12:05] you? We our gods." He said, "Your old
[1:12:08] prophets call them gods."
[1:12:10] But they did not understand. They were
[1:12:12] not making themselves him. It was Elohim
[1:12:16] who was making them. Y'all hear what I'm
[1:12:19] saying? It was God. Amen. It was them
[1:12:22] who made them God. They were just men.
[1:12:24] Yes. But God told Moses, he said, "I'm
[1:12:27] going to send you down to Pharaoh and
[1:12:29] I'm going to make you God of Egypt."
[1:12:32] Amen. He was a man. But when God stepped
[1:12:36] on the man, Hallelujah. He was no longer
[1:12:38] a man. He was God.
[1:12:41] Hallelujah.
[1:12:42] Amen.
[1:12:45] Child help us,
[1:12:47] Lord. But you see what it is. It is to
[1:12:49] cause the name of Jesus to be
[1:12:51] reproached.
[1:12:53] It is the bring of persecution upon who?
[1:12:55] You. Why? Why would you say that?
[1:12:57] Because I'm going to tell you something
[1:12:58] down the road. When when Jesus came,
[1:13:00] before Jesus came, there were other
[1:13:01] Jesuses.
[1:13:03] There were other people who claimed they
[1:13:04] were the Messiah who ran people off into
[1:13:07] the wilderness and they died. Amen. You
[1:13:09] know what I'm saying? You take the
[1:13:10] person, Amen, who took those people down
[1:13:13] there in Guyana, had them drinking
[1:13:14] Kool-Aid things. Has never been the same
[1:13:17] since, right? Amen. Every time somebody
[1:13:20] raised up the devil say, "Oh, this got
[1:13:21] to be a cult. This got to be this." And
[1:13:23] the first thing they say, "You better
[1:13:24] make sure you're not drinking that
[1:13:25] Kool-Aid."
[1:13:28] Why? Because that was done to bring
[1:13:31] reproach upon the truth, to make people
[1:13:34] fear.
[1:13:37] Oh, prophet. Oh. Oh, prophet. We don't
[1:13:39] need no prophet. The Bible said one had
[1:13:41] one and and the only one we got now is
[1:13:42] Jesus Christ. He is, but he's hiding
[1:13:44] behind flesh. Yes. He's always hidden
[1:13:47] behind flesh. Amen.
[1:13:52] Listen, if my mom and dad was a cow,
[1:13:54] guess what I would be?
[1:13:59] That's all I'm saying. And if you're
[1:14:01] born of God, come on, somebody. What
[1:14:04] else could he bring for? Amen.
[1:14:07] That's a powerful thought, but it's true
[1:14:08] anyhow. Oh, I'm a son and daughter of
[1:14:11] God. Is that right?
[1:14:13] Is that right? Amen. Your mom and your
[1:14:16] daddy is God. Amen. Then why are you
[1:14:18] just a man? Because God made himself a
[1:14:21] man. Hallelujah. Many God became one.
[1:14:26] Hallelujah. That's when the Holy Ghost
[1:14:28] came and said, "This is my beloved son
[1:14:31] in whom I'm well pleased to dwell in."
[1:14:34] Is that right? Oh, think about the
[1:14:36] disciples when they began to heal and do
[1:14:38] miracles. the the the old people who was
[1:14:40] all superstitious said the gods have
[1:14:42] come down upon us.
[1:14:47] Hallelujah. You love the Lord. Um uh
[1:14:50] let's move on. I'm almost done with
[1:14:53] this. Amen. Which in other ages is made
[1:14:55] known unto the sons of men. That was the
[1:14:57] fifth verse. as it is not now now
[1:15:00] revealed unto his holy apostles and
[1:15:01] prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles
[1:15:04] should be fellow heirs of the same body
[1:15:06] partakers of his promise in Christ by
[1:15:09] the gospel. Wherefore I was made a
[1:15:11] minister according to the gift of the
[1:15:13] grace of God given unto me by the
[1:15:16] effectual working of his power. unto me
[1:15:19] who am less than the least of all saints
[1:15:22] is that this grace given that I should
[1:15:24] preach among the Gentile the
[1:15:27] unsearchable riches of Christ and to
[1:15:30] make all men see what is the fellowship
[1:15:34] of the mystery which from the beginning
[1:15:36] of the world had been hidden in God who
[1:15:39] created all things by Jesus
[1:15:42] Christ the mystery was hidden from Adam
[1:15:45] all the way up hidden
[1:15:49] And it took Jesus Christ to unveil it.
[1:15:52] That's what we get. Amen. You talking
[1:15:54] about the unveiling of the word. Come
[1:15:56] on. When it is unveiled, that means you
[1:15:58] can see it. Hallelujah. What was hidden?
[1:16:01] Now I can see. Oh my goodness. And you
[1:16:05] say, "Well, what the Gentiles who were
[1:16:06] once called dogs are now God raised you
[1:16:09] up from being a dog to a prince." Amen.
[1:16:12] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:16:15] Amen.
[1:16:16] And all it had to do was take the kiss
[1:16:18] of a prince.
[1:16:26] Hallelujah.
[1:16:29] Ain't God good? When you realize, Amen.
[1:16:32] That's why the that the devil Listen,
[1:16:34] I'm going to tell you, I'm I'm done. I'm
[1:16:36] going to close the book, but I want to
[1:16:38] say this one more thought. That's why
[1:16:40] the devil is doing everything he can to
[1:16:43] keep you from being desperate.
[1:16:46] He'll supply your
[1:16:48] needs, some of your wants. He'll keep
[1:16:51] you. See, that's the enemy of our age,
[1:16:54] the lukewarmness, having so much. He'll
[1:16:57] keep you. Oh, yeah. He'll give you
[1:17:00] substitutes to satisfy that thirst in
[1:17:02] you. He'll give you whatever you want to
[1:17:05] keep you from being desperate because he
[1:17:06] know if you get desperate, God has the
[1:17:08] answer. Hallelujah. Y'all hear what I'm
[1:17:10] saying? It's like a baby's cry. My my
[1:17:13] daddy just had a baby there with a
[1:17:15] couple of them. The one in in Columbus
[1:17:18] and he was crying on the phone. I said,
[1:17:19] "You know, there's a difference between
[1:17:21] a wet cry and a hunger
[1:17:25] cry." Mothers, y'all know the
[1:17:27] difference. Amen. That baby cry when
[1:17:29] he's wet, but when he's hungry, you can
[1:17:32] hear the
[1:17:33] desperation. There's a difference in the
[1:17:36] cry. He wants to be changed, but when he
[1:17:39] is hungry, there's a difference. Now
[1:17:42] good parents can tell the difference and
[1:17:45] sometime when they wet and hungry you
[1:17:47] get a double
[1:17:49] portion right there is a difference and
[1:17:53] that's how it is with God. He knows when
[1:17:55] you have a need by the way you cry. But
[1:17:57] he knows when you're hungry, he knows
[1:18:00] that cry is a difference. And he said,
[1:18:02] listen, if you hunger and thirst after
[1:18:04] righteousness, he said, you shall be
[1:18:07] filled. Amen.
[1:18:11] And no man can make him a liar. No, sir.
[1:18:14] Uh-uh. No man. And when you cry and
[1:18:16] longer for for God like you ought to,
[1:18:19] you going to be filled. You will be
[1:18:21] filled and you'll be sealed. Amen. I was
[1:18:23] telling somebody get to yourself
[1:18:25] somewhere, but you can get ugly if you
[1:18:28] want to.
[1:18:29] You ain't got to worry about it. Y'all
[1:18:31] hear what I'm saying? I'm telling y'all
[1:18:33] something y'all. Yeah, I'm telling you.
[1:18:35] You got to get to yourself. You say,
[1:18:36] "Oh, no. Jesus got to himself." Amen.
[1:18:40] And sometime you just got to get to
[1:18:41] yourself. Ain't Kevin's in your crowd
[1:18:43] car riding down the road. You got to get
[1:18:45] there and says, "God, you got to feel
[1:18:47] me. You got to you got to kill this
[1:18:48] nature in me." Amen.
[1:18:50] And some of us who don't know how to
[1:18:52] cry, you say, "God, help me. Help me."
[1:18:55] Cuz I'm going tell you, this world make
[1:18:56] people hard. Yes. And they don't know
[1:18:58] how to shed tears. They don't know how
[1:19:00] to really h down and break themselves.
[1:19:02] So, God, I don't even know how to do
[1:19:03] that. Help me. So, you got to ask for.
[1:19:05] You ask because you asked, you got to
[1:19:08] keep asking. And one thing for certain,
[1:19:11] when he sees you, there ain't nothing
[1:19:14] like it. You'll feel like a strong man.
[1:19:15] You know you're a strong man. You're not
[1:19:17] afraid of the devil no more.
[1:19:19] You understand your authority. You know
[1:19:21] where you stand. Amen. Come on,
[1:19:24] somebody. Let's stand. Let's stand.
[1:19:26] Hallelujah.
[1:19:28] Oh, Jesus.
[1:19:32] Bless you, Lord.
[1:19:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:19:37] Surely people, it's it's not hard. I I
[1:19:40] tell you, it's not it's not difficult as
[1:19:42] difficult as we think it really is. He's
[1:19:45] waiting on you. He's waiting on you. And
[1:19:48] it's more his desire to give you the
[1:19:50] Holy Ghost. Amen. Than it is your desire
[1:19:53] to have it. So he's waiting. You waiting
[1:19:57] on you.
[1:19:59] You say, "Well, I can't just get
[1:20:00] desperate on my own." You know how to
[1:20:02] ask for it. Amen. Desperation going to
[1:20:05] come to you one way or the other. Amen.
[1:20:08] Right. And and and and when you realize
[1:20:11] that if the rapture come in two, let's
[1:20:15] say if it came in 24 hours, I wonder
[1:20:17] what you do if you knew it was
[1:20:19] coming. See, something in you already
[1:20:22] done is telling you you ain't quite
[1:20:23] right. Right. I don't have to tell you
[1:20:26] to God. Don't have to preach it for the
[1:20:27] proof. Your conscience is already
[1:20:29] telling you. Amen. That you Yeah, I'm
[1:20:31] close, but I'm not there yet. See, that
[1:20:34] ain't going to work. You got to be
[1:20:35] there. Amen. And my thing is to this
[1:20:38] morning is to get you to examine
[1:20:40] yourself. You don't have to please me. I
[1:20:43] ain't nobody to please. It ain't about
[1:20:45] me. It's about you and God. Hallelujah.
[1:20:49] And and acting right and acting this way
[1:20:51] and acting that way. What what do have
[1:20:54] to do with it? It's you and God.
[1:20:58] Right? I mean, my my thing is this. If
[1:21:01] there is something in you that let me
[1:21:03] know I I'm just not where I want God. I
[1:21:07] look and see I'm supposed to be dead to
[1:21:09] myself and Christ is supposed to be
[1:21:11] living me like Paul says not I live but
[1:21:13] Christ gives me. I don't care how long
[1:21:15] you've been a Christian. I'm not saying
[1:21:17] you haven't been a Christian. I'm saying
[1:21:18] you haven't gone and crossed all the way
[1:21:20] over. That's what I'm talking about. You
[1:21:23] need to say God have mercy on me and
[1:21:25] show me how to cross all the way over.
[1:21:28] It's more than you in here that's having
[1:21:30] that problem because we we're so busy.
[1:21:33] We're too busy to get down on our knees
[1:21:35] and spend a couple of hours in prayer.
[1:21:38] Hours in prayer.
[1:21:41] However long it
[1:21:44] takes. However long it takes. I don't
[1:21:47] know how to pray that long. Come on.
[1:21:50] There is no skill in it. Amen.
[1:21:53] When you're desperate, you just get down
[1:21:56] and God will take over from there.
[1:22:00] You can get it in 10 minutes. You can
[1:22:02] get it in 15 minutes. You can get it in
[1:22:04] 5 minutes. You can get it in 5 seconds.
[1:22:07] It all depends where your heart is.
[1:22:11] How much you got to give up? How much do
[1:22:14] you have to give up? only you
[1:22:20] know I told one of my my
[1:22:24] daughters I said when you surrender all
[1:22:27] you'll get it all. Amen.
[1:22:30] Amen. I said the problem is with your
[1:22:32] life you've never surrendered all and
[1:22:35] you tried to fool
[1:22:36] God and you can't trick him.
[1:22:40] He knows when you're holding on to
[1:22:42] something. Amen. Come on. Yeah, that's
[1:22:44] right. And I don't care how much you
[1:22:46] weep and cry and say, "God, take it all,
[1:22:48] but yet you got a handful of something
[1:22:50] behind your
[1:22:52] back. God knows you got that handful."
[1:22:54] And he knows exactly what's in the hand.
[1:22:57] Y'all hear what I'm saying? You got to
[1:22:59] surrender all. All all. And you say,
[1:23:03] "Well, how do I know?" Cuz he I know.
[1:23:05] I'm talking from experience. He'll start
[1:23:06] showing you what you got to give up.
[1:23:08] Amen.
[1:23:10] Amen.
[1:23:12] people, places, and things, all your
[1:23:15] nouns.
[1:23:17] He will show you what to give up. You
[1:23:21] love God.
[1:23:23] Let us pray. If there be anyone that
[1:23:26] needs special prayer, you can come up.

[1:24:27] mighty revival in this place. Cleanse
[1:24:30] out these vessels, Father God. Oh God,

[1:24:37] soul. Grant it right now, I pray in your
[1:24:41] lovely name, Jesus Christ, as we apply
[1:24:43] the token, believing and receiving it.
