[12:58] getting ready to get right on into the
[13:00] Word of God surely God is good to us
[13:06] thank him for its goodness
[13:10] appreciate our musicians I try my best
[13:18] to move out of the way so God could
[13:23] speak to us tonight
[13:40] while we're standing
[13:47] you guys have to sing this song but I
[13:52] want to ask if you would turn with us to
[13:58] jeremiah 15 jeremiah 15 chapter we're
[14:04] gonna read the sixteenth verse there and
[14:06] then we'll read revelations the TIMP
[14:10] chapter beginning at the ninth verse
[14:13] revelation 6:15 to Jeremiah 15 will read
[14:25] the 16th and the 17th verses of Jeremiah
[14:33] love the Lord surely God is good to us
[14:38] in words cannot express our gratitude
[14:42] especially in this day and time I trust
[14:46] that we are all seeing alike we realize
[14:51] we don't have much time and we
[14:54] understand that it is a matter of life
[14:56] and death
[14:58] we have come along for years being
[15:01] church members church groups church
[15:05] societies but now God is requiring
[15:09] something that I think a lot of people
[15:11] have missed out on it's not something
[15:14] new
[15:14] God has always required the token from
[15:20] Genesis to Revelation the blood of Jesus
[15:22] Christ must and have to be applied to
[15:26] each and every individual it is only it
[15:32] is God's only way of escape he said when
[15:36] I see the blood I'll pass over you
[15:41] Jeremiah 15:16 it reads
[15:57] thy words were found and I did eat them
[16:02] and that words was in unto me the joy
[16:06] and rejoicing of mine heart for I am
[16:12] called by thy name o Lord God of hosts
[16:19] revelations please will come from the
[16:27] temp chapter of revelations and I trust
[16:32] that God would give us the grace to get
[16:37] in what he would have us to have tonight
[16:40] revelations 10 beginning at the ninth
[16:43] verse and I went unto the angel and I
[16:49] said unto him give me the little book
[16:51] and he said it to me
[16:53] take it eat it up and it shall make that
[16:56] belly bitter but it shall be in thy
[16:59] mouth sweet as honey and I took the
[17:02] little book out of the Angels hand and
[17:04] ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet
[17:08] as honey and as soon as I did eat it my
[17:12] belly was bitter and he said unto me
[17:15] thou must prophesy again before many
[17:18] people and nations and tongues and kings
[17:22] let us pray father we come before you
[17:24] Lord we thank you for your grace and
[17:25] your mercy we thank you for being so
[17:28] good to us father you have been better
[17:30] to us than we have been to ourselves and
[17:33] I pray Lord God tonight that you would
[17:35] visit us Lord in a special way we we
[17:39] humble ourselves before you Lord there's
[17:41] nothing within ourselves that we can
[17:44] glorify but we come to glorify you and
[17:46] your name Holy Spirit cleanse us from
[17:49] all our unrighteousness and forgive us
[17:51] of all of our sins lord I pray that you
[17:54] allow your victory to be seen in us
[17:57] tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[17:59] amen
[18:00] you may be seated I like to entitle this
[18:05] message
[18:06] call-by-name one of the things that I
[18:11] like to bring out is that God and his
[18:14] people has always been one God told
[18:18] Israel that's what his relationship with
[18:22] Israel was was to be one his name was to
[18:26] be one when we think about a name a name
[18:29] can be a word or a combination of words
[18:32] by which a person place or thing a body
[18:36] or class or any object of thought is
[18:39] designed called or known for an example
[18:42] we call we know that a dog is a dog but
[18:47] sometimes we give that dog a name and
[18:49] that name is to distinguish it from all
[18:52] of the other dogs in the neighborhood
[18:54] when we continue to call that dog by
[18:57] name he began to recognize his name and
[19:00] so when he hears the master call he
[19:02] responds to that name now we look at the
[19:06] beginning in Genesis v 5 we found out
[19:10] that when God made Adam and God gave
[19:14] Adam that Dane God didn't have a I Adam
[19:16] didn't have a choice of name God called
[19:19] his name Adam and we find out that in
[19:22] the Genesis 5 that Adam now masculine
[19:27] part and his feminine part was the same
[19:32] named Adam the Bible said according to
[19:36] the second verse of the fifth chapter
[19:38] and he called their name Adam well when
[19:42] Adam failed God didn't say Adam where
[19:46] are you where are you and Eve where are
[19:49] you
[19:49] but we find out that when they failed
[19:51] God call Adam and at that point in time
[19:54] they both responded but because of Eve's
[20:00] or Adam's the feminine part of Adam
[20:02] because of the sin
[20:04] she was entrapped because now amen she
[20:08] has a seed in within her womb that was
[20:12] not God's seed it actually came from the
[20:15] serpent and because she carried that
[20:18] seed
[20:19] she was now bring
[20:20] fourth a different kind of fruit and God
[20:24] said your name shall be called Eve
[20:27] because you are now the mother of all
[20:31] living
[20:32] so names are important with God and
[20:36] names always have a meaning with God and
[20:40] so you and I must understand that names
[20:43] also give one's their identity is that
[20:47] right and when when when God would name
[20:50] something there was always a meaning
[20:52] behind it
[20:53] amen like when God called Abram Abraham
[20:58] it was because Abraham or Abram and God
[21:03] which means ham came together to be one
[21:05] and now Abraham represented God on earth
[21:10] because God told Abraham you are and you
[21:14] will be the father of many nations him
[21:17] and he took that tight in that shadow
[21:19] from God
[21:20] and when God attached his name to you oh
[21:23] my what a beautiful thing amen so you
[21:27] must understand that we we are in a time
[21:30] in a place where we must know our name
[21:34] because we are not a denomination we are
[21:37] not at organization we are not a
[21:40] man-made system but we are called the
[21:43] body of Christ and the Bible tells us
[21:46] that the body of Christ takes on the
[21:50] name of Jesus Christ is that right a man
[21:54] according to the Word of God it says and
[21:57] know of whom aha the Bible tells us that
[22:00] the whole heaven and earth is named
[22:04] after him is that right that's in
[22:06] Ephesians 3:14 215 so we realized names
[22:10] are important but the thing about it is
[22:13] that when God call you by name that is a
[22:17] personal that is a personal thing that
[22:19] God is doing hello is that right
[22:22] remember the Bible tells us about Josiah
[22:25] Josiah was named Josiah before he even
[22:30] arrived on earth it was a name
[22:34] given by God which showed us that Josiah
[22:39] was not only chosen but he was elected
[22:43] to be king God tells us in the book that
[22:47] did Jeremiah he says listen I knew you
[22:50] Jeremiah and I called you by name
[22:53] hallelujah I formed you in your mother's
[22:56] womb not only did I call you but I
[22:59] justified you I sanctified you I gifted
[23:02] you and you'll be a prophet so those
[23:05] things
[23:05] Amen that God told about Jeremiah he
[23:08] actually became that hallelujah now you
[23:12] must understand by God's grace that God
[23:16] has a great thing going on with us today
[23:20] now you said why why does names names
[23:23] mean so important because I said names
[23:25] will identify you a name would
[23:28] distinguish you right Amen that's why
[23:31] God even called he said there's a male
[23:33] that's a female hallelujah Amen he
[23:36] separated them after the fall
[23:38] uh-uh and gave them such a name Amen
[23:42] that they were actually different Adam
[23:44] and Eve but at the beginning though they
[23:47] be male and female they all they hope
[23:50] they both had the same name you
[23:52] understand me it's going to be important
[23:54] and I'm trying to teach a little bit but
[23:57] I want to say this today you know names
[24:00] are important because people who call
[24:02] you a dog remembering the time some of
[24:07] us remember amen during the 60s they
[24:09] used to call them cats they're cool cat
[24:12] but now they call them dogs so they done
[24:16] switched over now they're no longer
[24:17] catch their dogs even and you know that
[24:21] you should call you know man that went
[24:23] when somebody would with what would be a
[24:25] big person he was a man he's a monster
[24:28] but they don't call him monster now they
[24:30] say he's a beast right amen it's a
[24:35] descriptive name because when somebody
[24:36] is called a beast you don't expect to
[24:38] see a lamb you expect to see somebody
[24:42] that's big and ferocious right amen now
[24:45] I've heard just read
[24:47] they just the other day that people are
[24:49] calling them to their children little
[24:51] demons now if you would call your child
[24:56] a little demon what do you expect them
[24:59] to be demons because demons will have a
[25:04] right to manifest themselves through
[25:07] your children that's why I tell people
[25:10] don't call me a dog a dog is an insult
[25:14] the word dog evening when you call me a
[25:16] dog or car it's an insult it's like
[25:18] calling somebody a pig or swine it's an
[25:21] unclean animal hallelujah and you and I
[25:24] must understand that we are beyond all
[25:28] of that God has given his people a name
[25:31] and I'm trying to get to it and I'm not
[25:34] going to be long but I want to say this
[25:36] you know we have been chosen and elected
[25:41] understand Eve received her name because
[25:46] of her fall now there must be a woman
[25:50] who God will restore and in that
[25:54] restoration
[25:55] he will then restore her name back to
[26:00] what it should be
[26:02] hallelujah it is important because I
[26:06] want you to say the Bible said if my
[26:08] people and this is the answer if my
[26:11] people which are called by my name right
[26:16] so understand on earth we represents the
[26:20] name of God if you're not a Christian
[26:23] don't be a Christian right but when you
[26:26] say I am a Christian you are a
[26:28] representative of God which is in heaven
[26:31] right if my people which are called by
[26:36] my name called by his name shall humble
[26:39] themselves and pray and seek my face and
[26:42] turn from their wicked ways then will I
[26:45] hear from heaven and I will forgive
[26:47] their sin and will heal their land this
[26:51] is the answer to everybody in here and
[26:55] for those who are not in here this is
[26:59] the answer if you have
[27:01] been called by God's name if you humble
[27:04] yourselves and pray and seek his face
[27:06] God said I will heal the land and this
[27:10] was our restore it back to his healthy
[27:12] state ha I will forgive your sins right
[27:19] and will heal your land he said I want
[27:24] you to understand I'm waiting on you now
[27:28] my eyes shall be open and my ears attend
[27:31] unto the prayer that is made in this
[27:35] place so he says I am here to hear your
[27:39] prayer I've given you the solution to
[27:41] restoration I've given you too little
[27:44] the solution to bring you back to the
[27:48] place you used to be or you should be
[27:50] right listen it's the truth a name is so
[27:55] important according to the scripture of
[27:58] Isaiah 45 and 1 it says in brother
[28:02] Branham said like that she said this
[28:04] scripture refers to this day in that day
[28:09] seven women shall take hold of one man
[28:12] saying we will eat our bread and we're
[28:16] our own apparel and let us be called by
[28:20] thy name to take away our reproach he
[28:24] was working with this because he said in
[28:26] this day would be such looseness with
[28:28] women and I want to say it like this
[28:31] he's not just talking about women only
[28:33] he's working with churches they have
[28:36] left the moral standards and the life of
[28:40] Christ to there take any name to take
[28:44] away their reproach in other words I'm
[28:46] Baptist I method I'm presbyterian a
[28:49] message I'd like to say who all in here
[28:54] and you don't have to raise your him
[28:55] because I want I'm not trying to put you
[28:57] on the spot who all believe this message
[29:00] in here I'm sure you answer but let me
[29:03] ask you a question who all are in here
[29:05] that are Christians see I can ask ask
[29:09] that question who are who are it
[29:11] everybody in here that are truly a
[29:13] message believer
[29:15] amen let me see you raise your hand
[29:17] right and no doubt everybody erased
[29:19] ahead but the next question is that
[29:22] everybody raised and everybody that's a
[29:24] Christian let us raise your hand see
[29:27] that it's two different things two
[29:29] different things so when people say I'm
[29:32] a message believer that does not mean
[29:34] that they are Christian no more than a
[29:39] person would say I'm a Baptist or
[29:41] Methodist or Pentecostal that does not
[29:45] mean you are a Christian hello
[29:48] is that right that's what the brother
[29:50] Brennan said did that I forgot the
[29:52] brother who asked his sister are you a
[29:54] Christian she said I want you to I want
[29:57] you to know that I burn a candle every
[29:59] night burning a candle every night yeah
[30:05] are you a Christian I am I want you to
[30:07] know I am an American what that has to
[30:10] do with Christianity right you must
[30:15] understand we are living in an age of
[30:18] blasphemous names well people are
[30:22] considering themselves to be Christian
[30:24] because of the name of their church or
[30:27] their organization and it has nothing to
[30:30] do with Christianity we need some real
[30:34] Christians now Dave listen at the Garden
[30:39] of Eden what caused death and all this
[30:43] sorrow every heartache every little
[30:45] dying baby every rattle in the throat
[30:47] every ambulance screaming every hospital
[30:50] every graveyard was because he doubted
[30:54] one word that this always gets me she
[30:58] doubted one word now not not all of it
[31:03] it just perverted it now God said man
[31:08] there he was to keep every word of God
[31:11] that was the first Bible every word of
[31:16] God and I would ask you tonight how many
[31:19] of us are keeping every word of God
[31:22] don't incident but I will for you in a
[31:25] minute in the middle of the Bible Jesus
[31:27] come and he says
[31:28] men should not live by bread alone but
[31:31] by every word that proceedeth out of the
[31:34] mouth of God
[31:35] right not just part of them everyone now
[31:39] if Eve breaking one word prejudice into
[31:43] this devastation how are we going to get
[31:46] back to heaven when we are all guilty of
[31:49] breaking more than one see I'm working
[31:55] with this now so you can understand and
[31:58] then you and I can't do it
[32:00] the Bible has already told us that the
[32:03] righteous our righteousness is less
[32:06] filthy rags right filthy rags we can't
[32:15] we can't do it somehow we've got to find
[32:19] a way for them says in the last of the
[32:27] Bible revelation 22 Jesus give the
[32:29] testimony of himself the revelation the
[32:32] Bible's Jesus Christ and he said who
[32:35] should ever shall eat one word I take
[32:37] one word excuse me out of there or add
[32:40] one word to it this part will be taken
[32:43] from the book of life right one word
[32:46] take it away or attitude right so you
[32:51] must understand this is a serious matter
[32:53] and people don't understand this is why
[32:57] election is so important this is why
[33:01] when God calls you is your way of escape
[33:05] and that's why we must respond is our
[33:10] responding to the call that shows us who
[33:15] we really are is that right
[33:18] remember there was a young man Amen in
[33:20] the Bible he was a rich young ruler and
[33:23] the Bible said that Jesus loved him he
[33:27] was called by God right
[33:30] he approached God with his works that's
[33:33] where I'm going with you he approached
[33:36] God with works good master what must I
[33:39] do to inherit the kingdom of God
[33:43] and God said okay you gonna approach me
[33:46] with the law and I'm gonna give you the
[33:48] law right and Jesus went down the line
[33:52] come out said he loved him that means
[33:55] that this young man was good he was well
[33:57] educated well schooled he did exactly
[34:01] all of the right things so you can do
[34:05] all the right things and still not make
[34:09] it Oh help me Jesus
[34:11] this man did all the right things and
[34:14] then Jesus being the Word of God look
[34:18] deep into his heart right the Word of
[34:21] God is a two-edged sword is able to
[34:24] divide it pierces to the soul it goes
[34:27] right in there and it finds that little
[34:29] secret spot and he Jesus went in there
[34:33] and found out where the man treasure is
[34:36] ah
[34:36] come on somebody your treasure is hidden
[34:40] right here whether it be earthly or
[34:42] whether be heavenly it's in the heart
[34:45] and the Bible will search it out and he
[34:48] will expose it exactly just like he did
[34:50] the rich young ruler it doesn't matter
[34:52] how well you behave yourself and how
[34:55] good and clean you live it's who and
[34:58] what you are have as a treasure mmm and
[35:03] he went right in there and he said unto
[35:06] the rich young ruler sell all that you
[35:09] have see let me tell you something
[35:11] that's why people don't have the Holy
[35:14] Ghost because they're not willing to
[35:16] sell all that they have and Jesus says a
[35:20] little leaven leavens the whole lump so
[35:24] you can't have nothing in you that's of
[35:26] the world you must separate every come o
[35:30] somebody that's the word of the Prophet
[35:32] God calls for total separation of
[35:36] unbilled from every unbelief you know
[35:40] that word only believe that means
[35:43] there's nothing else you can do you you
[35:47] got so much belief you can't that's all
[35:49] you can do there's no space for not
[35:52] believing only believe that's
[35:56] I can do right no no doubt let's cap
[36:00] this is a mini way I can only believe
[36:03] that was the theme of the angel's
[36:04] message only believe when you just only
[36:08] believe that means you have a faith
[36:10] that's incorruptible it's a mustard seed
[36:15] faith or whatever but it cannot be
[36:17] broken it's real and that same faith to
[36:22] bring down mountains when you only
[36:25] believe but this man was not only
[36:29] believer he was an unbeliever when the
[36:32] test came and the test will always just
[36:34] determine who and what you are
[36:38] hallelujah when that word comes is going
[36:41] to find you out whether you be a
[36:44] believer or a non-believer let me tell
[36:48] you like this the only one the only
[36:50] thing that can make you a real believer
[36:53] is the Holy Ghost you say well what do
[36:57] you mean Peter follow Jesus and Peter
[37:01] acted like he believed and Peter said
[37:04] Lord I'd die for you and when the test
[37:06] came hallelujah he did not in three
[37:11] times that's how you can tell whether
[37:13] you got it or not
[37:14] cuz when the Holy Ghost comes no matter
[37:16] how great the pressure is you still come
[37:19] out with Jesus Christ
[37:20] but Peter because of the pressure he
[37:23] denied Jesus oh Lord
[37:26] a real Christian will never deny Jesus
[37:30] died a me when Peter got converted the
[37:33] Bible said Peter after you are converted
[37:36] go strengthen your brother let them know
[37:39] where the good come from let them know
[37:42] where the straight come from the
[37:44] strength comes from the power of God in
[37:46] you that you now have it was then when
[37:51] Peter became a full believer even died
[37:56] for Jesus hallelujah is that Alright
[37:59] he said now you go through the thinking
[38:02] man's filter right so I want you to
[38:04] understand whosoever shall take one word
[38:06] out of here or add one word to it
[38:09] his part will be taken from the book of
[38:10] life now you go through the thinking
[38:12] man's filter you have to have a holy
[38:14] man's taste when you come out of there
[38:16] right you have to have a safety at
[38:19] saintly taste sisters you that wear
[38:23] those clothes think of it you're going
[38:25] to say I'm virtuous to my husband
[38:27] I'm virtuous to my boyfriend I'm a
[38:29] virtuous girl but what about the sinner
[38:32] that looks at you and when he answers
[38:35] for adultery who did it you'll be guilty
[38:37] it is written in the word she be a
[38:41] thinking woman and not only just the
[38:45] women but the men as well we must not
[38:47] allow ourselves to be presented in such
[38:50] a way that somebody will lust for us
[38:54] come on somebody
[38:56] you must understand the Bible said and
[38:59] for as many as led by the Spirit of God
[39:00] they are the sons of God I'm going to
[39:03] come to the name in just a moment see it
[39:06] doesn't mean you won't have shortcomings
[39:08] it doesn't mean you're not gonna you
[39:10] know stumble and fall as long as you in
[39:11] this flash Amen but God is building of
[39:14] people to bring them to a perfection
[39:16] amen and that perfection is in Christ
[39:18] it's not in your flesh it is not what
[39:21] you do is what he has already done
[39:24] hallelujah understand this that a man
[39:26] that does not come to the full statue of
[39:29] Christ is not God's fault because he's
[39:36] poured out his spirit it is here
[39:38] all that was in God imported into Christ
[39:41] and all that was in Christ he poured
[39:43] into his bride the Holy Ghost is here
[39:45] and all of the virtues of crisis here
[39:47] the reason why many won't make it
[39:50] because they refuse to get rid of the
[39:54] leavening and you and I must circumcise
[39:58] our hearts every day in order to come to
[40:01] the full statue of Christ who helped me
[40:05] Lord for ye have not received the spirit
[40:08] of bondage again to fear you know why
[40:10] I'm preaching this because there are
[40:12] tons of people in the message that can
[40:15] shout that can dance that can speak in
[40:18] tongues that can run up and down the
[40:19] house and nothing's wrong with that but
[40:21] what's wrong
[40:22] isn't is that nobody is pressing into
[40:25] the kingdom hallelujah we need a revival
[40:29] we need a Holy Ghost revival that's
[40:33] gonna take away all of this self all of
[40:36] this lust all of these things that
[40:38] people are still doing
[40:39] we need a Holy Ghost revival that's
[40:41] gonna burn all of the stuff out uh hey
[40:44] so we can see the real Church of God God
[40:48] the devil don't care if you call
[40:49] yourself a message you don't care about
[40:51] that he don't even care about how good a
[40:53] preacher preach coz the many preachers
[40:56] gonna be there out of there y'all here
[40:59] I'm saying God didn't say that the
[41:01] preachers were exempt the preachers must
[41:03] come into the full statue of Christ oh
[41:06] they must have the same Holy Ghost
[41:09] William Branham had hallelujah oh we can
[41:14] look at the present all look what he did
[41:15] but the reason why he did what he did
[41:17] because he had the genuine Holy Ghost
[41:20] and when he came hallelujah that same
[41:24] Holy Ghost was released and given back
[41:27] to the church so we have no excuse but
[41:32] the Brennan said no matter how good you
[41:34] are what what you quit doing what you
[41:37] start doing you've got to accept the
[41:40] person of the Lord Jesus Christ
[41:42] hallelujah that's it
[41:44] justification make room for
[41:45] sanctification st. vacation make room
[41:48] for the baptism the Holy Ghost and a lot
[41:49] of people stop there when I praise God
[41:51] I've been who I got it that ain't it
[41:54] you don't stop there it that's the
[41:58] mystery of the seventh seal you must
[42:00] have the person of Jesus Christ in you
[42:03] that don't me hey and God is God ain't
[42:06] working with no duplex there's only one
[42:09] personality that will reach heaven and
[42:11] that's Jesus Christ the personality of
[42:15] Jesus Christ is the only one that's
[42:17] gonna be taken y'all hear what I'm
[42:19] saying
[42:22] when Jesus come oh I'm jumping a little
[42:24] bit up man swear say it the Holy Spirit
[42:25] when Jesus come and that Archangel cry
[42:29] out he's not gonna cry eyes here Joe to
[42:33] Peter James John no he's gonna scream
[42:36] one name that's we did he's gonna call
[42:40] his own name one name whatever that name
[42:47] is the bride of Jesus Christ will get up
[42:50] it's got to be that way because that's
[42:54] the way it was when God said Adam they
[42:56] both turn hallelujah and has got to be
[42:59] restored and the Bible said the whole
[43:02] heaven and earth is named after him and
[43:04] that name is a lot Jesus Christ
[43:07] hallelujah so when he calls now watch
[43:12] this cuz he receives a new name you know
[43:16] but whatever it is the bride will know
[43:19] it I don't care if she's been laying in
[43:21] the grave for hundreds of years
[43:23] hallelujah when he called that name
[43:26] hallelujah hey somebody she'll get up
[43:30] hallelujah is this okay no matter how
[43:34] good you are how much you say you're
[43:36] believer God requires the token he
[43:39] requires it in Egypt he requires it
[43:42] tonight he requires it tonight
[43:44] still the token is just as much required
[43:46] in this age as it was in that day age I
[43:49] don't care if you was a Bible student
[43:51] how well you can explain the scriptures
[43:53] Satan can do the same thing but remember
[43:57] that has nothing to do with it God
[44:00] requires one thing and that's the token
[44:02] the token shows that you are identified
[44:06] with your sacrifice that you claim that
[44:09] you worship a man there's only one lamb
[44:16] and that lamb was Jesus Christ halle-loo
[44:20] is that right Revelation tells us
[44:22] hallelujah he showed up as a bloody lamb
[44:26] that lion II mean that John saw turned
[44:29] up to be a lamb and he was bloody as
[44:32] though he and he's been slain
[44:34] we're from the foundation of the world
[44:36] that means that God just didn't start
[44:38] this work he started before the
[44:41] foundation of the world he put your
[44:43] names our names in the Lamb's Book of
[44:47] Life and we'll see
[44:49] one thing about the land the name true
[44:52] believe us know that the lead the name
[44:54] of the Lord Jesus Christ is the true
[44:56] name of God they know it they know it
[45:00] hallelujah
[45:01] wow he was given to him before they came
[45:04] here that's the truth
[45:05] I knew that Jesus Christ was God before
[45:08] I came to this message I was a Baptist
[45:13] and I knew that there was only one God
[45:15] and I knew his name was Lord Jesus
[45:17] Christ how did I know people of God God
[45:20] revealed it it wasn't me it was because
[45:23] I was there with him Oh Lord hallelujah
[45:29] it's got to be real God God listen I
[45:35] don't know whether I said this but i'ma
[45:36] say it now
[45:37] Michelangelo he made a statue called
[45:40] Moses right and he built that Moses and
[45:44] it became a masterpiece but since then
[45:48] they have had replicas you know people
[45:52] can make a replica of it but that's it's
[45:54] a cheap replica right and understand
[45:58] Christians can be replicated become
[46:02] replicas yes
[46:04] but God in looking for a replica he's
[46:07] looking for the original he's looking
[46:10] for an individual a man who is from the
[46:13] original that's why God couldn't give
[46:15] you something outside of himself he had
[46:18] to give you the original life am I
[46:21] making sense he had to give you the
[46:23] original life he could not give you
[46:25] something that was secondary a
[46:27] substitutional he had to give you the
[46:29] original life which was himself the Holy
[46:33] Ghost is the original life you got to be
[46:42] real and we find out I'm a hurry we find
[46:47] out Amen that you know a real Christian
[46:49] you're preachers like I said a lot of
[46:51] preachers are not even believe us the
[46:55] Bible says these signs shall follow them
[46:57] that believe you don't have no signs
[46:59] you're not a believer if he's a preach
[47:01] all the days of miracles man
[47:03] don't care what's he preaching he's a
[47:04] non-believer he's a sinner in the eyes
[47:07] of God the word sin means unbelief hello
[47:13] there's only two factions that is a
[47:17] believer and unbeliever right come on
[47:21] somebody so Sid is unbelievable like I
[47:26] was telling somebody the other day even
[47:28] if you just got small miracles it's okay
[47:30] at least you've got some signs following
[47:32] you right but there should never be a
[47:35] Christian who can say I've never seen
[47:38] the supernatural something's wrong
[47:42] first of all you just told me you're not
[47:45] born again because nothing can become
[47:47] more supernatural than being born again
[47:49] Oh somebody help me that's that's a
[47:54] justified person or sinner right that's
[47:57] all if you an unbeliever you're a sinner
[48:00] no matter how good you are how much you
[48:03] go to church or even if you a preacher
[48:06] you still an unbeliever the Pharisees
[48:11] were preachers and they were unbelievers
[48:13] and in Hell today for it somebody that's
[48:19] right that's the Hebrews chapter 2 y'all
[48:21] must understand you and I we the only
[48:24] way that you can truly believe you can't
[48:26] even comprehend God without the Holy
[48:28] Ghost the just shall live by his faith
[48:32] hello not your own the just shall live
[48:37] by his faith hallelujah by faith God by
[48:44] faith God created so the just shall live
[48:46] by his faith the just shall live by the
[48:48] faith of God the just shall live by the
[48:51] faith of Jesus Christ that's it
[48:54] that's it see we waste our time and our
[48:58] energy trying to make something happen
[48:59] when all we need to do is depend on him
[49:02] oh come on somebody look at the woman
[49:07] with the issue of blood she didn't even
[49:09] have no scripture for what she was going
[49:11] to do hallelujah but her faith kicked in
[49:14] she realized that this man
[49:17] Jesus had to be the messiah or somebody
[49:19] sent from God and she said if I can just
[49:22] but touch the heel in this comment I
[49:24] shall be made whole by somebody it was
[49:27] God who gave me that revelation if you
[49:30] thirst for God he said I will fill you I
[49:33] would oka most about it I will feed you
[49:36] if you hunger and thirst for me ain't no
[49:40] such thing but God you didn't help wow
[49:42] you got a hunger thirst so a Lord I
[49:44] don't know how to ask for it
[49:46] that's how you hunger in thirst you
[49:49] don't know how to do it ask him for it
[49:51] hallelujah she calling it an Easter seal
[49:54] he says true he said Christian's doesn't
[49:57] ask for easy things there's so much
[49:59] promises today made among Christian
[50:02] people so many ministers promise the
[50:04] people of false thing if you just come
[50:06] to Christ all your troubles are settled
[50:08] I'll tell you when you come to Christ
[50:11] they then begin that's when you put on a
[50:14] uniform and take a gun and enter the
[50:17] battlefield right the Christian Road is
[50:20] not a flowerbed of ease it's a battle
[50:23] from the very power you start until the
[50:26] Spirit is set free by death you are not
[50:29] at a picnic you are own a battle cry
[50:34] that's modern-day Hollywood oh if you
[50:39] gain you go prosper
[50:42] yeah yeah right modern day Christianity
[50:46] look down on poor Christians Oh God
[50:50] can't be with you because he promised us
[50:53] if you are true Christian you go prize
[50:54] but you gonna have all these riches
[50:57] you're gonna be the head and not the
[50:59] tail
[51:03] hallelujah well I wonder who Lazarus was
[51:06] who was just Lazarus who's a poor man
[51:10] who laid at the rich young ruler stable
[51:13] running for the crumbs trying to get to
[51:17] the scrapings that he scraped off his
[51:18] table before the dogs got to it
[51:21] who was this Lazarus I tell you who he
[51:24] was he was chosen and elected of God
[51:26] some time God make us poor allow us to
[51:30] be poor
[51:30] so that he testing those who say they're
[51:32] Christians is that right oh come on
[51:36] somebody what what on the road to
[51:39] Jericho there was a man that was that
[51:42] had been beaten and wounded the
[51:44] Pharisees walked on by Sadducees walk to
[51:48] him by y'all know y'all understand me
[51:50] and here was a publican right he was a
[51:54] man a man who was who was I put it this
[51:57] way of mixed race but he saw this man
[52:01] come on somebody a Samaritan and he saw
[52:07] this man this man was a low-life in his
[52:09] day that's the way they looked at him
[52:11] you ain't nothing that's the way people
[52:14] in this message look at people you ain't
[52:16] nothing but let me tell you it doesn't
[52:18] matter what you know physical
[52:20] composition is made out of it's whether
[52:22] or not you got the C gene of God on the
[52:24] inside and when you have to see Gino you
[52:27] need inside you maybe his point art in
[52:31] this world but in that world he said I
[52:35] go to prepare a place for you that where
[52:37] I am there you may be also
[52:40] in my father's house are many mansions
[52:44] God don't care but all the stuff that we
[52:47] care about hallelujah and here he said
[52:52] this Samaritan says hey I'm gonna bond
[52:55] you I'm gonna take you over here amen
[52:57] and push you into this hotel and I'm
[52:58] gonna pay for it hallelujah and he told
[53:01] the innkeeper good take good care of him
[53:03] preacher he came in here wounded I found
[53:07] him almost dead but preacher don't you
[53:09] let him die keep putting the oil the
[53:13] bomb of getting on him hallelujah bring
[53:15] him back to health
[53:16] huh and I'm gonna tell you something the
[53:19] only way to bring the Christian back to
[53:22] health is get those to see if you can
[53:24] get those pretty Christians to repent
[53:28] because the only reason why our
[53:30] Christian becomes spiritually sick is
[53:32] because they doing things and have done
[53:34] things that they shouldn't have done or
[53:36] and they won't repent if my people think
[53:40] which are called by my name if they
[53:42] would humble themselves and pray
[53:44] and seek my face and turn from their
[53:47] wicked ways he said I hear from heaven
[53:50] honey and I he know the lane I'll
[53:54] forgive you of your sins and I heal the
[53:56] land that's not in every case but I'm
[54:00] talking about in general we're talking
[54:02] about a revival brother but I would say
[54:04] the only way we can have a revival we
[54:06] must get the trash out of our lives and
[54:08] he said the bride has not had her
[54:10] revival yet that means the bride has not
[54:13] trashed out her trash I believe we are
[54:21] but we got too many isms we got too many
[54:25] things laying within us dark spots this
[54:29] has to go brother em said that's the
[54:31] only way you're gonna make a rapture go
[54:34] listen to the message leadership it's
[54:36] all got to go every world in this thing
[54:39] about you it must go leadership come on
[54:44] that's what it don't listen to it he
[54:46] said every every little worldly thing
[54:49] has to be separated you gotta leave it
[54:52] no matter how painful it is you got to
[54:55] leave it is that right think about it
[54:58] you think you giving up something if
[55:01] Bobby said Moses was a rich young ruler
[55:04] Moses could have had women on top of
[55:06] women wine and dine chariot summer homes
[55:10] winter houses whatever he woman it but
[55:15] the Bible says he refused to be called
[55:20] the son of the Pharaoh's daughter he
[55:24] refused to be part of this world why
[55:26] because he exceed the riches of Christ
[55:29] hallelujah and when you extend the Holy
[55:32] Ghost over all of these other things God
[55:35] can use you but we got so many people
[55:38] they don't even look at the Holy Ghost I
[55:40] mean let me let me tell y'all something
[55:41] God took the tree of life and moved it
[55:44] out of the way and then he but what I'm
[55:50] saying he's got a morphing right so the
[55:53] same tree of life he comes and he comes
[55:56] in the form of
[55:58] bread they call it manna and he hid
[56:02] himself in that manner is that right
[56:05] am I wrong okay so come on it's true he
[56:10] there's only one life and that's Christ
[56:13] and that same life hid himself in that
[56:17] manner you said what do you say am I
[56:18] saying like the Bible said Jesus said
[56:20] how was that bread how was that manner
[56:22] that came down in the wilderness how was
[56:25] that manna and the Bible said listen
[56:28] they think they got to a place they
[56:30] hated it they wanted meat and that's the
[56:34] way where is in this message
[56:36] everybody want meat but they don't want
[56:38] the manner but let me say it like this
[56:40] God never said I was that meat in the
[56:42] wilderness but he said I was that bread
[56:44] I would that matter that fell from
[56:47] heaven and it is the matter that Pat's
[56:49] out the Holy Ghost hallelujah is that
[56:54] right because he breaks bread and
[56:56] communion hallelujah is the if the
[57:00] people can really see it is that right
[57:03] the same thing the Jewish Church did the
[57:07] cornerstone they rejected the
[57:09] cornerstone and that cornerstone was the
[57:12] holy goat the cornerstone was Jesus
[57:15] Christ why because people don't want the
[57:17] Holy Ghost in their charges anymore like
[57:19] I said they just want that almost pimsy
[57:23] calls almost don't go all the way but
[57:25] you can raise your hand a little bit and
[57:27] shout hallelujah a little bit but don't
[57:30] go all the way but i'ma tell you the
[57:32] only ones that's gonna make a rapture
[57:35] are those who are deign to go all the
[57:38] way don't tell me there aren't any but
[57:41] there are amen and those names will
[57:43] never come up short everybody that God
[57:46] has ordained now I don't know about you
[57:49] but I'm one of them I'm that man that's
[57:53] gonna that's that's in the process and
[57:55] God is moving me now in the process of
[57:57] cleaning up everything I'm not mature
[57:59] forsaken everything and I thought dude
[58:03] this guy shows me something else got got
[58:05] to go to it's constantly showing me
[58:08] things that got to die and move out of
[58:10] my way
[58:11] but I'm gonna tell you something people
[58:12] of God I'm making it my name is in the
[58:16] book I don't care yeah I was telling
[58:20] somebody it cuz you know lately I've had
[58:21] you know friends to fall back on me and
[58:24] but I says Lord Jesus if this is a test
[58:28] I accept
[58:30] because nothing means more to me than my
[58:33] Jesus as much as I love friends and
[58:36] family nothing means more to me than my
[58:39] Jesus Christ hallelujah y'all understand
[58:42] me hallelujah
[58:44] is this okay brother branham tells us of
[58:47] a story where the farmers the 4-h club
[58:49] was able to make a seed that looks just
[58:53] like a coin your coin I caught on the
[58:56] car he said it was so identical you
[58:59] couldn't tell the difference between the
[59:01] two but the man who manufactured it says
[59:06] the only difference the only way you can
[59:09] tell the difference is to bury the boat
[59:10] both of them
[59:12] he said the original will always come up
[59:16] but the one that's man-made it will rot
[59:20] hallelujah and that's what's happening
[59:23] right now those who are in the message
[59:25] those who are claiming to be Christians
[59:27] they have adapted systems that have hot
[59:30] bread at the Word of God and instead of
[59:33] producing Christ they're rotting
[59:37] somebody help me
[59:39] only Jesus Christ can bring forth the
[59:42] resurrection only the life of Christ in
[59:45] the original seed hey man it has nothing
[59:48] to do with what we call ourselves is
[59:50] what he calls us mmm
[59:57] John 1318 says listen I know of whom I
[1:00:02] have chosen so nobody can pull the wool
[1:00:05] over God's eyes God knows who have
[1:00:08] chosen right it doesn't matter how
[1:00:10] beautiful it is
[1:00:11] that's what brother brown say there's
[1:00:13] two men sitting on the same seat in the
[1:00:15] church both of them deacons or pastors
[1:00:18] or whatever they may be or two of the
[1:00:20] lady laity but of them going to going to
[1:00:23] both of them going to church
[1:00:25] listening at the same message both but
[1:00:27] one has life and the other one does not
[1:00:30] it takes the hand of God to do something
[1:00:33] for a man if you're born again got the
[1:00:37] Spirit of God in you you've got to live
[1:00:40] again no matter how good you are how
[1:00:43] religious you are if that spirit of life
[1:00:46] is not in you your parish ain't about
[1:00:53] calling yourself Pentecost oh because
[1:00:56] I'm gonna tell you something the
[1:00:57] Pentecost ahead the real Holy Ghost but
[1:00:59] it was only spirit on the spirit the
[1:01:01] revelation of this message took us
[1:01:03] beyond beyond the inner court hallelujah
[1:01:08] the message of this hour takes you into
[1:01:10] the Holies of Holies with where the soul
[1:01:13] is whether some kind of glory is whether
[1:01:16] real birth of God is death cannot stand
[1:01:20] in the Shekinah glory hallelujah is that
[1:01:25] right it was proven by Aaron's rod if
[1:01:27] you stand and stay in the Chicago glory
[1:01:30] not into that the only thing that can
[1:01:34] happen if you go in there dead you rise
[1:01:36] again
[1:01:40] hallelujah there's a showdown coming and
[1:01:43] you know people don't understand that
[1:01:45] every trial and test that you having is
[1:01:48] sent by God people don't don't make
[1:01:51] think oh it's terrible and I can't
[1:01:54] hardly take it in No the Bible said God
[1:01:56] will not put no more on you than you can
[1:01:58] bear
[1:01:58] God knows every trial he's already
[1:02:01] designed it for you hallelujah
[1:02:10] which one you rather rather have would
[1:02:14] you rather have a lion eat you would you
[1:02:17] rather go through the fire hmm would you
[1:02:21] rather go through the chopping block mmm
[1:02:24] all these people have gone through
[1:02:26] things like this that you and I cannot
[1:02:28] imagine hallelujah but they kept the
[1:02:31] faith look throughout all times and then
[1:02:36] they took those Christians and they rip
[1:02:37] the
[1:02:38] out of their bodies they fed them to the
[1:02:41] Lions they burned him at the stake
[1:02:44] they skinned them alive they rose
[1:02:47] kissing them and yet the hell home I
[1:02:52] think about what I'm saying they kept
[1:02:54] the faith why because God called them by
[1:02:59] name and when God calls you by name you
[1:03:03] become invincible his word cannot fall
[1:03:06] neither can it fail
[1:03:09] hallelujah you ought to be some thankful
[1:03:12] that you do have a name there are women
[1:03:15] who have been so bad God wouldn't even
[1:03:17] call him by name is that right come on
[1:03:21] you say who you tell my Lot's wife
[1:03:24] [Laughter]
[1:03:27] God didn't even give her a name yeah and
[1:03:30] I'm saying hallelujah
[1:03:32] you said what well you oh come on
[1:03:35] there's another one Saul's daughter God
[1:03:40] just took her name off the book and
[1:03:43] everything didn't even tell us what it's
[1:03:44] you know me you said oh listen we know
[1:03:48] that Bathsheba what she did but in the
[1:03:51] New Testament God don't in combat Sheba
[1:03:53] name he'd cheat kahiko Uriah's wife that
[1:03:57] was no compliment you see what I'm
[1:04:02] saying but the Bible tells us that he we
[1:04:05] have a name y'all don't understand what
[1:04:10] William Branham brought to us was a
[1:04:12] revelation of Jesus Christ oh because
[1:04:17] you have the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:04:19] you have the name hallelujah that's why
[1:04:26] he said listen don't add to the word
[1:04:28] don't take away because that is the name
[1:04:30] the Bible said his name shall be called
[1:04:33] the Word of God Oh somebody help me here
[1:04:37] it's got to be real mmm is that right
[1:04:43] listen he said I don't steal I don't
[1:04:47] drink I don't do these things that has
[1:04:49] nothing to do with it see it's
[1:04:52] the inside no matter how good you are
[1:04:54] how Mario you are how truthful you are
[1:04:57] those things are respected but jesus
[1:04:59] said except a man be born again there's
[1:05:02] got to be something happened inside if
[1:05:05] you don't that out of fissure put on
[1:05:09] fall down in your heart you desire to do
[1:05:12] it anyhow
[1:05:13] it can't be artificial it's got to be
[1:05:16] real whoo y'all hear me I'm trying to
[1:05:22] hurry now listen we come in this last
[1:05:26] day and you know I always loved Esther
[1:05:29] because God had already put put away -
[1:05:32] die God ain't moving in those
[1:05:34] organizations I can say some things
[1:05:37] that'll blow your mind yup not blow your
[1:05:39] mind forgive me for saying it that way
[1:05:40] but you know I can tell you some truth
[1:05:42] that'll really shake you up because if
[1:05:44] Jesus are calling the revelation the
[1:05:46] third chapter is outside the door let me
[1:05:48] ask you a question then who's on the
[1:05:50] inside it's an impersonator
[1:05:54] it's the scripture right in later see of
[1:05:58] Jesus Christ is outside the door trying
[1:06:00] to get in and if he's only outside who's
[1:06:03] on the inside the Bible said in these
[1:06:06] last days Satan will deceive all whose
[1:06:10] names are not written on the Lamb's Book
[1:06:12] of Life hallelujah
[1:06:14] he Paul says be careful he would
[1:06:16] disguise himself as an angel of light he
[1:06:20] will even call himself Christ so he in
[1:06:24] the church calling himself Christ and
[1:06:26] he's deceiving and what is he deceiving
[1:06:32] where is he bringing them to the mark of
[1:06:34] the beast I'm gonna stay with my
[1:06:36] organization I'm gonna stay with my
[1:06:37] church I'm gonna stay with your charge
[1:06:39] can't save you that is the mark of the
[1:06:41] beast whenever you choose a system over
[1:06:44] the line that is the mark of the beast
[1:06:48] done exactly what Cain is done
[1:06:51] hallelujah come on somebody uh uh you
[1:06:56] know I I don't mean no harm I don't care
[1:06:57] how deep these preachers get in the
[1:06:59] message if they don't bring me back to
[1:07:00] the blood of Jesus Christ I don't want
[1:07:02] to have nothing to do with it if they
[1:07:03] don't bring me back to the power of the
[1:07:05] Holy
[1:07:05] and coming into a statue of a person man
[1:07:07] I don't have nothing to do with it
[1:07:09] why because I know that when when Moses
[1:07:12] left out of Egypt he had dated Ankara
[1:07:14] with him and they're here too
[1:07:17] everybody want to interpret remember
[1:07:19] they were way off for what brother wept
[1:07:21] with Moses said hallelujah Joshua go
[1:07:26] ahead on the on your mission but always
[1:07:28] remember what Moses said we must
[1:07:33] remember what Malachi for has said
[1:07:35] holida y'all y'all understand me listen
[1:07:38] I'm gonna tell you that's the truth of
[1:07:39] the matter everybody that think they got
[1:07:41] the Holy Ghost do not have it and some
[1:07:44] of them have it but just only spirit it
[1:07:46] ain't going today so because they still
[1:07:48] doing that nasty stuff hallelujah and
[1:07:51] all that must go no one clean thing
[1:07:53] shall enter it's up to you the choice is
[1:07:57] up to you whether you're gonna go all
[1:08:00] the way with God or not see people don't
[1:08:03] like it when I preach like this cuz I'm
[1:08:05] telling you the truth God gonna hold me
[1:08:07] for this I'm gonna tell you cuz I don't
[1:08:10] want Peter when I'm in the message I
[1:08:11] think about a million's with Moses in
[1:08:14] his message and they all died except two
[1:08:17] of that generation don't be foolish
[1:08:20] he told Nicodemus except you be born
[1:08:23] again he got to be listen in the latter
[1:08:30] rain you know where we're coming into a
[1:08:33] Mount Zion showdown you know God is
[1:08:36] gonna prove who the true church is hmm
[1:08:39] don't get me wrong when the anointing
[1:08:41] fall that's coming under the anointing I
[1:08:43] know some people don't believe that but
[1:08:44] I've seen it in the word another unknown
[1:08:47] thing is coming guarded gonna pour down
[1:08:48] for the last time mmm and it's gonna
[1:08:51] bring everything into harvest rain do
[1:08:54] not change this seed it just manifests
[1:08:59] what it is if it's weed it's gonna come
[1:09:01] up and praise the law if it's weed it's
[1:09:03] gonna come up and praise the Lord y'all
[1:09:05] know what I'm saying what's ever in
[1:09:07] there right who would have thought the
[1:09:10] rich young ruler was a devil and God
[1:09:15] loved him who would have thought Judas
[1:09:17] who could cast out devils and
[1:09:19] each unordered by the holy ghost yet he
[1:09:22] was born the son of perdition look at
[1:09:28] Peter he looked like he looked like he
[1:09:31] was in worse shape than Judas Judas just
[1:09:33] denied in one time Peter said three
[1:09:35] times and he cashed
[1:09:38] but on the inside of the inside
[1:09:41] he had representation it ain't how good
[1:09:45] we are we supposed to be as good as we
[1:09:48] could be but it's all about Jesus Christ
[1:09:51] and His salvation hallelujah I don't
[1:09:56] want to scare you into something but I
[1:09:57] wouldn't if I could scare you into
[1:09:58] prayer I would because prayer is the
[1:10:01] only way out I'm telling you people
[1:10:04] don't understand prayer is there at all
[1:10:07] people thousands when we have two heard
[1:10:14] the word one out of a million got to do
[1:10:19] with it I'm talking about the rapture
[1:10:21] I'm not talking about salvation many
[1:10:23] will have salvation I'm talking about
[1:10:25] making a rapture whoo in the latter rain
[1:10:28] will come a mount calmer showdown
[1:10:30] brothers here watch this carefully down
[1:10:32] to see it in the word John was the
[1:10:36] forerunner of Malachi 3 and I got a
[1:10:38] hurry up cuz the time is right now but
[1:10:41] let me say it like this the Bible says
[1:10:44] that listen listen he first talking to
[1:10:50] the preachers that's why I'm hollering
[1:10:52] and screaming the way I'm screaming
[1:10:53] how's their 62 beginning at the first
[1:10:55] verse he says for Zions sake will I not
[1:10:58] hold my peace and for Jerusalem's sake I
[1:11:01] will not rest until the righteousness
[1:11:05] they're up go forth as brightness and
[1:11:07] the salvation thereof as a lamp that
[1:11:09] burn it and the Gentiles shall see that
[1:11:12] righteousness and all kings that glory
[1:11:14] and thou shall be called by a new name
[1:11:18] which the mouth of the Lord shall name
[1:11:21] is that right he's talking to either but
[1:11:24] the new name in which God was speaking
[1:11:26] of at that time was not Jehovah it was
[1:11:29] Jesus because God made
[1:11:33] the Son of God thou shalt call his name
[1:11:35] Jesus and he shall save his people from
[1:11:38] their sin so it transformed it it moved
[1:11:43] forward from just your home to Jehovah's
[1:11:45] salvation which is Jesus Christ right he
[1:11:50] says now listen and the Gentiles that
[1:11:51] see the righteousness and all the kings
[1:11:53] that glory and that should be called by
[1:11:55] a new name which the mouth of the Lord
[1:11:57] shall name thou shall also be a crown of
[1:12:01] glory in the land of the Lord and a
[1:12:04] royal diadem in the hand of thy God for
[1:12:07] thou for thou shall no more be term
[1:12:10] forsaken neither shall I land anymore
[1:12:12] be termed desolate but thou shalt be
[1:12:14] called head Sabha and the lamb Beulah
[1:12:17] for the Lord delighted indeed and that
[1:12:20] land shall be married hello
[1:12:24] not just engaged married for as a young
[1:12:29] man marries a virgin so shall the sons
[1:12:31] marry thee and there's a bridegroom
[1:12:33] rejoices over the bride so shall the God
[1:12:36] rejoices over thee what is it why why
[1:12:41] the scripture said that that that that
[1:12:43] that that John rejoiced to see the
[1:12:46] bridegroom you know why because he knew
[1:12:49] if there was a bridegroom there's got to
[1:12:50] be a bride hallelujah that's why we
[1:12:54] umbrella rejoiced through all of the
[1:12:56] suffering he had to go through with
[1:12:57] these organizations denomination they
[1:12:59] didn't know when they kicked him out
[1:13:01] they were kicking Jesus out when they
[1:13:04] closed the doors on him they closed the
[1:13:06] doors on Jesus Wow because he was the
[1:13:09] voice of God hallelujah y'all hear me it
[1:13:14] was that point we said listen all heaven
[1:13:16] save me remember even demons he said
[1:13:18] demons as Forsaken Lee it was the same
[1:13:23] in Paul's day he had a demons and demons
[1:13:26] forsook him this demons of our day he
[1:13:28] brought the Pentecostal Church into the
[1:13:31] World Council of Churches why because of
[1:13:34] riches money better you know what it is
[1:13:37] Christian businessman they got warned
[1:13:43] you know they were warned
[1:13:46] you saw what do you mean God warned him
[1:13:48] so much and told them you go this way
[1:13:51] you're going to be lost no matter how
[1:13:54] good you are how big of your kingdom
[1:13:56] your building you lost because you
[1:13:59] rejected the word of the hour hallelujah
[1:14:02] he said ban you you should listen the
[1:14:04] truth is the truth
[1:14:05] he said I've set my watchman upon the
[1:14:08] walls o Jerusalem which shall never hold
[1:14:11] their peace day no night the watchman's
[1:14:15] are the preachers and if the preachers
[1:14:18] in this day you know what they're not
[1:14:19] trying to get the people to the Holy
[1:14:21] Ghost something's wrong with them they
[1:14:23] cannot be a watchman not a watchman for
[1:14:26] God because they know except you see the
[1:14:29] blood if the token is not applied I
[1:14:32] don't care how glorious your kingdom is
[1:14:35] you've made the blood is the only way of
[1:14:39] escape and we know that the blood is the
[1:14:42] life of Jesus it is the Holy Ghost and I
[1:14:47] don't mean in baby thorns we must have
[1:14:50] the fullness of Christ all that was in
[1:14:53] God he poured it into Christ all that
[1:14:56] was in Christ he poured it into his
[1:14:58] bride
[1:14:58] so the fullness of Christ must be in the
[1:15:00] bride of Jesus Christ you said well you
[1:15:03] mean it ain't gonna be a lot that's why
[1:15:05] God didn't call groups God calls
[1:15:08] individuals I'm almost done right okay

[1:15:16] him no rest till he established until he
