gathered here in his name [Music] we take his name upon us not just in baptism but by a faith of a true heart repent of our sins [Music] no [Music] and she received the results down on the inside [Music] in the middle of a church service when you catch the revelation that he is here with their hand of faith underpass [Music] this is a familiar story to us all verse 36 it says and when one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the pharisee's house and behold there was a woman in the city which was a sinner and she knew that jesus said i meet in the pharisees house she brought an alabaster box which had bitten him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touches him for she is a sinner and jesus answered them said unto him simon i i have somewhat to say unto thee and he saith master sayon metropolis there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed 500 pence and the other owed only 50. learned [Music] i'm gonna read just the first half of uh verse 43 simon answered and said well i suppose he forgave the most reports set we'll read uh matthew chapter seven verse three here peter said verse heavenly father we approach [Music] let it be unto how to get a beam out of your eye come on now that beam was like a stick or a twig a pisces where the the the moat or the speck was like a piece of chaff or a piece of wheat book a small piece of dust to that in your own thoughtfulness don't tap don't see you can consider the state of your brother the condition of your brother you can you can consider the condition of your brother don't condition turn your own uh in turn your sight towards yourself regardless consider your own state examination and first yo jesus said that mark 16. jesus [Music] even the bride of christ let me tell you manly even members of the bride of christ and have spirits that will plague them bad habits that will jesus christ [Music] amen amen you know in matthew chapter 7 we read the story of a pharisee and this pharisee he he a thought came into his mind yeah i've heard person also i don't have that i'm going to uh make a feast in my house through the story you begin to realize that his motive was half-hearted [Music] is [Music] you have to love everything that the holy spirit is i am and when you see the holy spirit moving in your age you need to start with your favorite and it was good that simon had this thought in his mind that he recognized that's there was a ministry there was the creator of the heavens and the earth [Music] but it was the woman that walked by and glanced [Music] ghost do you speak of the spirit that created the heavens and the earth this ministry deserves to have the preeminence of and even though she saw that he didn't have the preeminence in simon's house began to have the preeminence in her heart [Music] a deep desire her heart strings began to be tugged to be tugging upon her heart christ began to have the preeminence the holy spirit in her age as the spirit began to act in her age she became entirely given over to the holy ghost of a new complex [Music] lord [Music] [Music] year after year looking for this is [Music] would not have betrayed jesus but he lived he was trying to stand on both sides of the fence for so long [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] anointing oils that were inside that box is worshiping her lord and savior the manifestation of the [Music] those acts have been neglected there are many that that that that enjoy the ministry of this last day the [Music] because we all have to and there are many that are in the house even though they're in simon's house maybe they could get one up and over simon he said each one trying to look a little better than the other ones oh [Music] are those that are i was in michigan a while ago michigan um while i'm telling this let's turn to matthew 13. we're talking is send me some of your favorite quotes sometime see what his treasure is maybe [Music] and i was comparing verse 30 with verse 41 because in verse 30 jesus had given a parable of the tares and the wheat but after jesus sent all the multitudes away disciples came to it says we want to know the interpretation of this parable so when you get to verse 41 there is jesus given the interpretation of the parable i was just sitting there [Music] and sitting there studying at verse 41 i go and i looked at my phone and that brother it sent me a quote and the quote was from a message in 1965 called the seed of discrepancies where brother branham is preaching on this terrible [Music] is a religion they these walls there's another dimension that can walk right through these walls christ is still making himself youngest [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and you realize that there's things in your life that's contrary to the word of god [Music] that you begin to have an opportunity for jesus christ to [Music] the preeminence to the lord jesus christ and the thing about the baptism of the holy ghost [Music] [Music] yourself to the adoption [Music] at that point you gotta wait for god to do that things he said that there is the kingdom of heaven is like a man that sowed good seed in his field but notice that when jesus is given the interpretation of it and i was reading in verse 41 let's read verse 40 here uh as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire the feast verse 40. as therefore the tears are gathered and burned in the fire so shall said this has happened in each age but right here it's actually talking about the end of the world all things that offend tulis condan and them that do iniquity comments and shall cast them into a furnace of fire and there shall be wailing and nation of tea will you and then hello shall the righteous shine forth as the sun and the kingdom of their father explode what amen the son of man is going to send his angel to the lord he's going to clean out the kingdom there's two things he's getting out of his kingdom it is [Music] not just the people that have been pastored but things in the kingdom many shows don't know why you are offensive to the word of god suppose now if you are sitting they are offensive to the kingdom of heaven suppose or shows this shoe there is an angel that is coming to get that thing out of your life it shows oh i'd like to let you know who that angel is that angel is the one that brought this message to us and there is a message that was given to [Music] [Music] oh [Music] adore uh [Music] that woman that everybody thought was a sinner was sealed on the inside of that worship service and everybody else was sealed out and there's a worship service going on all around us and everybody in this age is being given the option to give jesus christ the preeminence the donations or to leave him in the corner brother branham said that judas would not have betrayed christ because you died [Music] it says that when he dipped coin that satan entered into him yes sometimes you'd say things like someone believed just now it is people would begin believing on the lord jesus christ that light would that was going through the audience the one same one you see that light would travel through the audience will begin to believe on the lord [Music] woman in a yellow dress and you're praying for someone who's not in this city [Music] the gathers [Music] it [Music] hear if you have ears to hear the smile this is the time we're living the tears are being bound together the denominations are getting tighter together the bride of christ is standing alone [Music] with the have become the seed of god saint of you that's the monster jew then they must be the word of god the word of god manifested about the laodicean church the laodicean church was given an opportunity and everyone that is living in this layout of cnn promise the one has a promise of entering into that inheritance the other has a promise of one day looking up [Music] weeping and wailing [Music] out jesus [Music] they are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot a basket that's my chauvinist spot qua i will spit you out of my mouth so there's a promise for us of being hot it's possible for us to be on twitter [Music] so in every single one of us rather than looking at our brothers and sisters and wishing they were a little bit more unfortunate ought to cast that beam out of our eyes [Music] look out this examine a new man say am i on fire for christ i should come on this year with some tunes have only further keys to congress there is an inheritance to the bride of christ for the gospel [Music] some people don't there's another promise here in 1718 some are going to be rich increase and they say i have everything that i need lord i need that treasure that only comes [Music] the holy spirit walking in the in the in the midst give me that fire lord don't wash her first thing she knows that she has needs [Music] [Music] i'm out of her my people partakers of hers but she stands alone manchester [Music] [Music] that doesn't come from just an overnight man a man that just comes to the church and then goes someone who hasn't met this [Music] anointed the lord jesus christ quit looking at these walls you begin to rise that you're surrounded by a cloud of witnesses chariots of fire the ministry of the lord jesus christ that brought what jesus christ sacrifices sacrifice they had a similar worship it's similar gods they had a similar dna he's having a song they look so we're going to [Music] amen amen age books the other day now shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church montreal antiques is he's talking about this book of revelation it exposes satan as i expose saturn revealing his words israel the attempted destruction of god's people the attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word all the way down right down to the time that he has cast into the lake of fire the book of revelation reveals the word of god do where [Music] and he said i heard [Music] [Music] she's not sure where she is consider [Music] allow the pastor to
