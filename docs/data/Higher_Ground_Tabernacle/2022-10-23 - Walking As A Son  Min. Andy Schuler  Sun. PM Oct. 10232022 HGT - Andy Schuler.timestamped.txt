[48:11] means it means something to see a
[48:13] Believer that's going on with God
[48:15] somebody who's standing and sometimes
[48:17] you know just time and and distance
[48:20] being what it is sometimes you see a
[48:23] Believer and then you don't see him for
[48:25] a number of years but it does something
[48:27] to your heart when you see them again
[48:30] and they're still going on for God and
[48:32] many of my soul well that seems like a
[48:35] small thing no that that's everything

[48:41] stand for this word and stand for God in
[48:44] this hour is uh it's a victory we should
[48:47] minimize it amen because there are those

[49:25] couple scriptures that be all right
[49:26] let's read in Luke chapter three and
[49:28] then we'll also just read uh in Romans
[49:31] chapter 8.
[49:32] amen
[49:33] take my jacket off again
[49:36] I I have never learned to preach with a
[49:38] jacket on
[49:39] it just doesn't work for me
[49:42] amen I want to title the subject tonight
[49:45] walking as a son
[49:48] amen Luke chapter 3 verse 22.
[49:53] the Bible says in the Holy Ghost
[49:56] descended in a bodily shape like a dove
[49:59] upon him
[50:00] and a voice Came From Heaven
[50:03] which said Thou Art my beloved Son
[50:07] in the I am well pleased
[50:10] amen and then in Romans chapter 8
[50:13] verse 29.
[50:17] we could read that together
[50:21] for whom he did for no
[50:24] he also did predestinate
[50:27] to be conformed to the image of his son
[50:31] the one that he just said Thou Art my
[50:34] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[50:36] amen
[50:37] that they would be predestined to be
[50:39] conformed to the image of that son
[50:42] that he might be
[50:45] the firstborn
[50:47] now I'm not good at English
[50:50] but firstborn means there's a second
[50:53] a third and a fourth a fifth and on and
[50:58] on
[50:58] among many brethren
[51:01] amen amen
[51:03] amen let's bow our heads father we love

[51:24] Lord we have authority that you've given
[51:26] us Lord and Lord we want to look at your
[51:29] word tonight and we want to walk in
[51:32] everything that you've purchased for us
[51:33] Lord
[51:35] we want to walk in Victory tonight
[51:38] we want to walk as children of the
[51:40] Living God
[51:41] and I pray you bless this word tonight
[51:43] father
[51:45] Quicken it to our hearts Lord stir us up
[51:47] I pray Lord
[51:49] uh God may your word just move us and
[51:53] stir us and Shake us Lord where we need
[51:55] to be shaken and Lord may it give us
[51:58] life tonight
[52:00] Lord we commit the remainder of this
[52:02] service to you we commit the communion
[52:04] service to you we commit our hearts to
[52:06] you Lord in every way father we love you
[52:10] and thank you in the name of Jesus
[52:11] Christ amen
[52:13] amen you can have your seats tonight
[52:17] amen so you know I I give this subject
[52:20] as walking as a son
[52:23] but if you're a sister tonight
[52:26] you just put in there walking as a
[52:28] daughter I think in that direction all
[52:30] the sisters are over here
[52:32] the unbalanced ship amen
[52:35] walking as a daughter amen walking as a
[52:39] son
[52:41] what it means to be a son or a daughter
[52:44] of God and how does one live and walk on
[52:49] the earth amen
[52:51] but we see here in the scripture where
[52:54] God the heavenly our heavenly father the
[52:57] creator of the universe comes down and
[53:00] he puts his stamp of approval yeah on
[53:03] the Sun
[53:05] amen
[53:07] amen letting everyone know let the world
[53:10] know let there be no dispute no question
[53:15] this is my beloved Son
[53:18] and we know that brother Branham taught
[53:20] us that where he said in in thee I am
[53:22] well pleased and in other places it's
[53:24] I'm pleased to dwell in and right the
[53:27] the wording of that but the main point
[53:29] is that he was pleased
[53:33] and he was dwelling in him
[53:36] my beloved Son
[53:38] well pleased to dwell in to walk in to
[53:43] represent him
[53:45] to be the one to show the world who God
[53:48] is
[53:50] to reconcile the world to himself
[53:52] through that vessel
[53:55] amen
[53:56] The Vessel through whom the Father the
[53:59] invisible God would reveal himself to us
[54:04] that we would know him amen now brother
[54:07] sister none of us I don't believe
[54:10] tonight nobody in in Christianity has a
[54:14] problem recognizing that Jesus was
[54:16] Emmanuel
[54:18] that he was God With Us
[54:20] and he had a position as our savior and
[54:23] the Lord of all men is that right
[54:26] but what about his position as a son
[54:30] right
[54:32] now we're not talking about a trinity
[54:33] here we're not talking trinitarian
[54:35] Doctrine or anything like that this
[54:37] isn't three gods
[54:39] but he lived as the Son of God and he
[54:44] walked the Earth as a son of man
[54:48] and so he showed us what it meant to be
[54:51] a son
[54:54] an offspring of God
[54:57] amen
[54:59] amen Jesus modeled it he was our role
[55:01] model
[55:02] how a Son of God would walk on the earth
[55:05] and the things that he would do now of
[55:07] course we don't do everything that he
[55:08] did right we're not called to die for
[55:11] the world
[55:12] but there were things that he did
[55:15] that he did as a son just because he was
[55:18] a son
[55:19] amen
[55:21] he had to be tempted
[55:24] yes he was tempted to sin
[55:28] but yet without sin
[55:31] amen
[55:32] he could be tempted he had to be tested
[55:35] he had to go through every trial every
[55:38] Temptation yet without sin
[55:41] he was beloved of the father he was
[55:43] loved unconditionally
[55:46] amen now let me read you another
[55:49] scripture this is John chapter 8 verse
[55:50] 28.
[55:52] Jesus said unto them when you have
[55:55] lifted up the son of man then you shall
[55:58] know that I am he
[56:00] and that I do nothing of myself
[56:04] but as my father hath taught me I speak
[56:07] these things
[56:09] and he that sent me is with me
[56:13] the father hath left me alone
[56:16] for I do always those things that please
[56:19] him
[56:21] now that's a great big statement right
[56:23] there
[56:24] amen
[56:26] I do always those things that please him
[56:32] and the father comes back and says
[56:35] I am well pleased
[56:37] right
[56:40] Hallelujah
[56:41] so I have a question for you or
[56:43] something for you to consider here
[56:45] tonight
[56:46] and this is something that the the Lord
[56:48] dealt with me about several years ago
[56:50] just kind of dropped it on me and man it
[56:53] shook me up I'll I'll admit it amen
[56:56] that if you have any shadow of a doubt
[57:00] or you wonder is God pleased with me
[57:04] right can you say that I know the father
[57:06] is pleased with me
[57:09] got you thinking
[57:11] amen I know that the father is pleased
[57:15] with me now I I can't say I do always
[57:19] the things that please him
[57:21] but he is pleased with me
[57:23] I am beloved of him I'm loved
[57:25] unconditionally and the father is
[57:27] pleased with me
[57:30] well I hope if you can't say it now
[57:31] maybe you'll be able to say it by the
[57:32] end of the service amen
[57:34] because brother sister if we have any
[57:36] hesitation any shadow of a doubt
[57:39] that the father is pleased with you it
[57:43] will be a hindrance in your walk
[57:45] amen you will have you will not be able
[57:47] to face down demons
[57:49] amen because they will know that there
[57:51] is something missing there
[57:54] amen
[57:56] we are unable to do always the things
[57:59] that please the father
[58:00] in ourselves
[58:04] but Jesus did it
[58:07] and brother sister we are in him
[58:11] yes amen
[58:12] this is the confidence that we have in
[58:14] our savior
[58:16] this is why we honor and worship him so
[58:18] much amen because he was perfect
[58:21] he was perfectly pleasing to the father
[58:25] to make a way for amen
[58:29] the peace and the dirt I make mistakes I
[58:32] fall down but Spirit In Me says get back
[58:35] up you're a son
[58:37] I get back wiped away
[58:39] and the father is pleased
[58:42] we are pleasing to believe that
[58:45] he was the firstborn among daughters to
[58:48] walk
[58:49] he walked in confidence of his position
[58:53] you think that he didn't need that to
[58:56] happen where God came down the father
[58:58] comes down for everybody and lets
[59:00] everybody know this is him
[59:02] I am well pleased
[59:04] right puts that stamp of approval on him
[59:07] what happened after that he gets tempted
[59:09] he gets tested amen
[59:12] Hallelujah but he walked in confidence
[59:17] we've got to walk the same way
[59:20] we can't have any question amen
[59:23] Hallelujah
[59:26] amen
[59:28] you know it's it's it's one of the
[59:30] things that I've learned in my time uh
[59:33] working in industry
[59:35] that one of the one of the most powerful
[59:37] things you can do for somebody is you
[59:39] can give them confidence
[59:41] you can get them confidence that they
[59:42] belong right and they're they're needed
[59:46] they're wanted they fit that that it's
[59:49] empowering to them and that's just in
[59:51] the natural brother sister how much more
[59:54] the family of God
[59:56] amen and this is a family by the way
[59:59] amen I don't know if you know that or
[1:00:01] not but this is not religion this is
[1:00:03] family this is God expressing himself in
[1:00:07] his family
[1:00:08] amen that's why we say brother sister
[1:00:10] amen that's that's not just a figure of
[1:00:13] speech that's not just a formality or
[1:00:16] something like that amen many brethren
[1:00:20] brothers and sisters you know my my
[1:00:24] children when well one of them's gone
[1:00:26] now but my son he doesn't come home from
[1:00:29] school and have to come to me his father
[1:00:32] and I don't interview him and say okay
[1:00:34] my son
[1:00:36] tell me how your day went did you did
[1:00:38] you fail today
[1:00:40] let's let's look at your performance
[1:00:43] right
[1:00:44] let's look at what you did and what you
[1:00:46] didn't do before I let you in the door
[1:00:50] right and if you messed up you need to
[1:00:53] go you know somewhere else he doesn't
[1:00:55] think about that he walks in the door he
[1:00:58] gets off the bus he walks in the door he
[1:01:00] doesn't even know or care if I'm at home
[1:01:02] because he lives there he walks in the
[1:01:05] house and he goes to the refrigerator
[1:01:09] amen and he knows that anything in that
[1:01:12] refrigerator is his
[1:01:14] why because he's my child
[1:01:17] amen and in in our relationship isn't
[1:01:20] based he's not going to stop being my
[1:01:22] child if he makes a mistake at school or
[1:01:25] he messes up here that's not going to
[1:01:27] change our relationship
[1:01:30] amen
[1:01:31] hallelujah God doesn't love one day and
[1:01:34] hate the other
[1:01:36] right once you're a child of God you're
[1:01:39] a child of God dance
[1:01:43] so we've got to have that confidence
[1:01:45] brother sister
[1:01:47] Jesus after that 40 days he's tested and
[1:01:50] tempted in the wilderness and what does
[1:01:52] the devil come up to him or come against
[1:01:54] him with
[1:01:56] what is the Temptation what is the
[1:01:59] question Bible readers
[1:02:02] if thou be
[1:02:06] that was what he asked him
[1:02:08] if thou be the son of God
[1:02:12] if you are who you say you are the devil
[1:02:15] was there at the at the river too he saw
[1:02:19] what happened
[1:02:20] if you are who you say you are
[1:02:24] why did he tempt him why did he test
[1:02:26] that
[1:02:27] because that's the Crux of the whole
[1:02:29] matter
[1:02:31] he challenged his relationship to the
[1:02:34] father
[1:02:36] if he didn't have a revelation of who he
[1:02:39] was
[1:02:40] he would not be able to stand that
[1:02:43] temptation right amen
[1:02:46] he knew he was the Son of God the Bible
[1:02:49] says that he found himself in the volume
[1:02:51] of the book
[1:02:54] Hallelujah
[1:02:56] amen we've got to do that too
[1:02:59] we've got to find ourselves in the
[1:03:01] volume of the book and know who we are
[1:03:05] he was not told by any man who he was
[1:03:09] right he didn't have one of the priests
[1:03:10] or a bishop or somebody a pastor or
[1:03:12] anybody say hey this is the guy right
[1:03:14] here
[1:03:16] right John the Baptist pointed him out
[1:03:19] but then God came back and answered it
[1:03:24] amen
[1:03:26] Hallelujah
[1:03:28] God spoke to him
[1:03:31] and it's good for a man we can have a
[1:03:33] man like John the Baptist we could have
[1:03:35] you know uh somebody you know give bear
[1:03:38] witness God is moving in this person's
[1:03:40] life or or as a minister you know we
[1:03:42] would bear witness that you know this is
[1:03:44] this is a minister of God or anything
[1:03:46] like that but unless God comes back and
[1:03:49] answers back
[1:03:50] and confirms it
[1:03:53] it doesn't matter what any man would say
[1:03:56] because what matters is what God tells
[1:03:59] you
[1:04:01] that's why you know brother I I've I've
[1:04:04] I've kind of we've kind of butted heads
[1:04:06] with with other ministers sometimes
[1:04:08] because uh I I have a my pastor has this
[1:04:13] pet peeve too we both share this burden
[1:04:15] we have a pet peeve of of a minister
[1:04:18] that would tell somebody oh you've got
[1:04:21] the Holy Ghost and they'll say it kind
[1:04:23] of like don't worry about it you've got
[1:04:25] the Holy Ghost
[1:04:26] and I I just marvel and it's
[1:04:29] I mean first of all
[1:04:32] it doesn't matter what you say
[1:04:34] right if you're seeking the Holy Ghost
[1:04:37] don't take the word of any minister
[1:04:39] that's the point right it's fine if you
[1:04:42] want to encourage them or whatever but
[1:04:44] nobody should ever take the word of a
[1:04:47] minister I've got the Holy Ghost they
[1:04:49] need to hear from God
[1:04:52] amen amen I had a young man in my Sunday
[1:04:55] school who was asking me about that I
[1:04:56] teach our our teenage Sunday school 13
[1:04:59] and up 13 to 19. he was seeking the Holy
[1:05:03] Ghost and he said I was praying and a
[1:05:04] minister told me that I had the Holy
[1:05:05] Ghost
[1:05:06] and I said well do you he says well he
[1:05:09] was was he wrong to tell me that and I
[1:05:10] said well do you have it do you know
[1:05:14] I said it wasn't necessarily wrong for
[1:05:17] him to express that but what he thinks
[1:05:20] doesn't matter
[1:05:22] what matters is if you heard from God
[1:05:25] every one of us must hear the voice of
[1:05:28] the father speaking to us
[1:05:33] amen
[1:05:35] we've got to find ourselves in the
[1:05:38] volume of the book
[1:05:40] you see Satan's a worthy adversary he's
[1:05:43] going to test and he's going to probe
[1:05:44] every weakness
[1:05:47] and he knows that only a son or a
[1:05:50] daughter of God has Authority and power
[1:05:52] over him
[1:05:54] a pretender will not have that Authority
[1:05:58] amen
[1:06:04] so he tries to defeat
[1:06:08] their revelation of who they are
[1:06:13] to get them to doubt their sonship
[1:06:17] amen he attacks who they are
[1:06:22] but a child that's heard from God
[1:06:25] knows
[1:06:27] they know who spoke to them
[1:06:31] man it's it's like Ruth you know the
[1:06:33] story of Ruth
[1:06:35] and one of the beautiful things about
[1:06:36] the story of Ruth is you know Ruth goes
[1:06:39] directly to Boaz
[1:06:42] amen if you've read this story Bo and
[1:06:44] and and and
[1:06:46] they're in that inner chamber and and
[1:06:49] nobody else is there
[1:06:52] and he tells her directly
[1:06:54] I'm going to redeem you
[1:06:57] I'm gonna work out your salvation I will
[1:07:00] do this for you
[1:07:01] she heard directly from him
[1:07:04] now when she left she was a nobody still
[1:07:08] she could say man Boaz is gonna Redeem
[1:07:10] Me Hallelujah and everybody everybody
[1:07:13] else could have been like what are you
[1:07:15] talking about you are crazy you don't
[1:07:17] know what you're saying you know
[1:07:20] brought any accusation against her and
[1:07:22] it didn't matter
[1:07:24] why because she heard it from him
[1:07:28] directly
[1:07:30] Hallelujah
[1:07:33] so will we be tested
[1:07:36] so we better know who we are
[1:07:38] right amen
[1:07:40] Hebrews chapter 5 verse 5 says five five
[1:07:44] so also Christ glorified not himself to
[1:07:47] be made a high priest
[1:07:49] but that he said unto him Thou Art my
[1:07:51] son today I have begotten thee
[1:07:54] and he saith in another place thou art a
[1:07:56] priest Forever After the order of
[1:07:57] Melchizedek
[1:07:59] who in the days of his flesh when he had
[1:08:01] offered up prayers and supplications
[1:08:03] with strong crying and tears unto him
[1:08:05] that was able to save him from Death was
[1:08:07] heard in that he feared though he were a
[1:08:10] son
[1:08:11] yet he learned obedience by the things
[1:08:13] which he suffered
[1:08:15] and being made perfect
[1:08:17] he became the author of Eternal
[1:08:19] salvation unto all them
[1:08:22] that obey him now he was our model
[1:08:25] right
[1:08:26] our example
[1:08:28] and he learned
[1:08:30] and that that word there learned it it
[1:08:33] means by experience and practice
[1:08:38] by going through some things
[1:08:41] he learned obedience through the things
[1:08:44] which he suffered
[1:08:46] he walked as a son through testing and
[1:08:50] suffering and trials and was able to
[1:08:53] practice obedience and demonstrate it
[1:08:57] for you and I amen my my
[1:09:01] because what happens with a child of God
[1:09:04] is the testing just proves more who they
[1:09:09] are
[1:09:10] amen
[1:09:11] I think there's an old saying that you
[1:09:14] know when you squeeze a lemon you get
[1:09:16] lemon juice
[1:09:21] right what's on the end that doesn't
[1:09:23] suddenly change into something else
[1:09:26] but you get what it's made of
[1:09:29] when you squeeze it and you press it and
[1:09:32] you put it through trials what you get
[1:09:34] is what it's made of it doesn't suddenly
[1:09:37] turn into something else
[1:09:40] so a son or a daughter of God when
[1:09:42] they're squeezed and tested and tried
[1:09:43] what you get sonship
[1:09:48] amen you get on display more of God in
[1:09:51] their life
[1:09:54] now people that's a great big statement
[1:09:56] right there
[1:09:57] right people think it's just the
[1:09:59] opposite oh no to this person you know
[1:10:00] they don't have any trials they don't
[1:10:02] have any troubles man they must be
[1:10:03] spiritual Godly I mean they've got this
[1:10:06] skull and form and this and look at this
[1:10:08] guy over here who's going through this
[1:10:09] and he's going through that
[1:10:13] but the trials bring God
[1:10:18] on the scene amen amen they display more
[1:10:22] sonship
[1:10:24] amen now I'm not saying that me that
[1:10:26] you'll never have good good times good
[1:10:28] things right
[1:10:30] we thank God for the good times amen and
[1:10:32] the blessings
[1:10:34] but it's not a measure of our
[1:10:36] spirituality
[1:10:37] any more than you know uh being wealthy
[1:10:41] or prosperous or any of those things is
[1:10:43] a measure of our spirituality or not
[1:10:46] it's all how we handle it
[1:10:49] amen
[1:10:50] and just because you have trials doesn't
[1:10:52] mean you're spiritual either
[1:10:54] sometimes the trials we bring on
[1:10:57] ourselves
[1:10:59] I saw a good saying brother brother uh I
[1:11:02] say you'll appreciate this you know
[1:11:04] there's a song you know the the weapon
[1:11:07] may be formed but it won't Prosper
[1:11:09] you've heard that and there's and that's
[1:11:11] that's the scripture right no weapon
[1:11:13] formed against you will prosper amen but
[1:11:16] there was this saying floating around
[1:11:18] and said you know sometimes the weapon
[1:11:20] formed against us was something we did
[1:11:23] was a weapon that we formed ourselves
[1:11:27] amen
[1:11:28] it doesn't make you more spiritual
[1:11:30] because you get yourself into trouble
[1:11:34] amen
[1:11:36] Hallelujah
[1:11:39] but you see when Jesus think about Jesus
[1:11:41] life when he was confronted by the
[1:11:45] lawyers and the scribes and and they
[1:11:47] were trying to trick him and they were
[1:11:49] testing and probing and looking for any
[1:11:51] weakness
[1:11:53] that brought out some of the most
[1:11:56] wonderful scriptures
[1:12:00] right that brought out his character to
[1:12:03] us we got to see his character on
[1:12:06] display in those times and then those
[1:12:08] testing
[1:12:10] amen
[1:12:12] to see the attributes of God
[1:12:15] how how are people going to know that
[1:12:18] that God is that he's a help in time of
[1:12:22] trouble
[1:12:23] amen unless there's times of trouble
[1:12:27] right
[1:12:28] think about the money changers we got to
[1:12:31] see a side of Jesus that we wouldn't
[1:12:33] have seen otherwise
[1:12:35] amen we got to see him you know with
[1:12:38] righteous indignation and righteous
[1:12:40] anger
[1:12:42] we got to see him at Simon's house
[1:12:46] being humiliated
[1:12:48] amen we got to see his character on
[1:12:51] display as he was treated badly
[1:12:54] and and he was mocked and humiliated and
[1:12:57] we got to see his tenderness to the
[1:12:59] Harlot
[1:13:02] but in all of that
[1:13:05] he walked in confidence of who he was
[1:13:08] and the other thing brother sister is he
[1:13:10] walked without fear
[1:13:13] amen
[1:13:15] Hallelujah
[1:13:17] now I want to kind of break something
[1:13:18] down for you trust we have time
[1:13:21] this evening but I kind of want to break
[1:13:23] something down to you that
[1:13:25] the Lord showed me and it helped me a
[1:13:27] little bit so maybe it'll help you as
[1:13:29] well
[1:13:30] and that is you know we have so many
[1:13:31] examples especially in our message we
[1:13:34] have a prophet God moved mightily in his
[1:13:37] life
[1:13:39] amen we see God we see God in Jesus as
[1:13:43] an example we see God and Paul is an
[1:13:45] example we see God and brother Branham
[1:13:47] as an example
[1:13:48] right and these were gifted they were
[1:13:50] all they all had gifts in their life
[1:13:53] Supernatural gifts
[1:13:55] right
[1:13:56] but we we got to be careful because we
[1:13:59] need to be able to differentiate and
[1:14:02] discern the things that they did because
[1:14:05] of their office
[1:14:07] and their gifts and the things that they
[1:14:10] did just because they're a child of God
[1:14:12] you understand what I mean amen because
[1:14:15] the for example I I said earlier you
[1:14:18] know where Jesus is our model but we're
[1:14:21] not going to die on a cross for the
[1:14:24] world right brother Branham is an
[1:14:27] example for us but we are we are not the
[1:14:29] seventh angel Messenger to the to this
[1:14:32] church age right we're not Malachi form
[1:14:33] we don't fulfill those things but let's
[1:14:36] use brother Brandon for an example
[1:14:38] because I think in our message and it's
[1:14:40] natural tendency is for us to do this
[1:14:44] sometimes we see him doing things
[1:14:47] and we said well of course
[1:14:50] of course God moved that way in his life
[1:14:53] he's a prophet
[1:14:55] right
[1:14:56] of course God answered his prayer he's a
[1:14:59] prophet
[1:15:01] come on now
[1:15:02] right he had an anointing on his life so
[1:15:05] you know of course he had a a a a a gift
[1:15:08] of healing and uh you know he did these
[1:15:11] things and that thing and so that was
[1:15:13] that was God's prophet
[1:15:16] and if we keep doing that we won't have
[1:15:19] any example left of well what about the
[1:15:22] what about the things that happened in
[1:15:25] his life just because he's a child of
[1:15:27] God Amen
[1:15:28] things that you should expect in your
[1:15:31] life and I should expect in my life
[1:15:34] amen
[1:15:35] so we must be able to differentiate
[1:15:37] between that anointing in the office
[1:15:40] and sonship
[1:15:43] a position as a child of God
[1:15:46] amen
[1:15:49] if we don't we'll just make excuses
[1:15:52] even if we just make it in our own mind
[1:15:55] I can't have that kind of walk I can't
[1:15:57] live close to God like that because of
[1:15:58] course he's the prophet
[1:16:00] amen
[1:16:03] Hallelujah of course he raised the Dead
[1:16:06] He's a prophet oh really
[1:16:09] any son or daughter of God is to raise
[1:16:12] the Dead
[1:16:14] amen
[1:16:16] to heal the sick
[1:16:20] he prayed for people and they got healed
[1:16:22] yeah he did yes he had a gift of healing
[1:16:27] that doesn't mean that you can't pray
[1:16:29] for people and they won't get healed too
[1:16:33] amen
[1:16:35] amen I think that's why brother Brown
[1:16:36] made it such a point so many times in
[1:16:38] his meeting remember he tells a story he
[1:16:40] tells a story in one of his meetings
[1:16:43] about how there was a woman with a child
[1:16:47] that was sick
[1:16:48] you remember this story
[1:16:50] and there was she was in the back of the
[1:16:52] balcony I think it was of the building
[1:16:54] and there was a there was a sister there
[1:16:56] who felt the Holy Spirit telling her to
[1:16:59] pray for that child
[1:17:01] now who is she was she a prophet was she
[1:17:04] a seventh Church age messenger
[1:17:06] she was a daughter of God
[1:17:08] born of the spirit
[1:17:10] and the Holy Spirit was
[1:17:13] telling her pray for that child and she
[1:17:15] said oh this is crazy the the man of God
[1:17:17] is remember he talks about her her
[1:17:20] thought process no the man of God is
[1:17:22] going to pray for her I I'll pray that
[1:17:24] she gets in the prayer line and the man
[1:17:26] of God can pray for how many times do we
[1:17:29] have that kind of thinking
[1:17:32] amen amen amen but it just kept Weighing
[1:17:35] on her so heavy and she asked me I pray
[1:17:37] for your baby and of course the woman
[1:17:38] said of course you can and she prayed
[1:17:41] for it and went on and it turned out the
[1:17:42] woman got in the prayer line
[1:17:45] remember she went before the man of God
[1:17:48] and he says you're already healed
[1:17:51] that woman back there prayed
[1:17:56] that's the body of God in action
[1:18:00] amen
[1:18:02] she prayed and that baby was healed
[1:18:07] Hallelujah that's a child of God
[1:18:11] that's how we're to walk amen
[1:18:15] but I I said a moment ago a ghost
[1:18:18] something Jesus walked without fear
[1:18:22] I want you to think about that for a
[1:18:24] moment
[1:18:25] without fear
[1:18:28] imagine your life without fear
[1:18:33] amen
[1:18:35] if you're filled with the spirit that
[1:18:37] same life is in you
[1:18:39] he said now he said the works that I do
[1:18:42] shall you do also and what does our mind
[1:18:44] immediately go to healing and raising
[1:18:46] the dead what about walking without fear
[1:18:50] what about walking in Victory
[1:18:54] amen
[1:18:57] amen hallelujah
[1:19:01] with Jesus we have to do the same thing
[1:19:03] don't confuse the life that he lived
[1:19:05] because he was Emmanuel God With Us and
[1:19:09] our example as a son
[1:19:12] amen he taught us to pray as a child not
[1:19:15] a beggar
[1:19:18] Amen to pray Our Father
[1:19:23] relationship knowing who our father is
[1:19:27] that he's a good father
[1:19:29] amen
[1:19:30] we're not coming to a to a cold God
[1:19:34] somewhere but we're coming to our father
[1:19:39] Hallelujah
[1:19:43] so we have the question still before us
[1:19:47] tonight is the father pleased with you
[1:19:51] that's the question
[1:19:54] is there any doubt that he was pleased
[1:19:56] with Jesus
[1:19:59] no question right
[1:20:01] the lamb was examined the lamb was
[1:20:03] perfect
[1:20:06] now let me ask you something are you
[1:20:08] part of him
[1:20:14] we are taught at the day of Pentecost
[1:20:16] when the Holy Spirit fell that the
[1:20:18] spirit divided itself amongst the
[1:20:20] Believers fell on each one
[1:20:22] and the prophet taught us that we don't
[1:20:24] have the whole ocean he said it's like
[1:20:26] taking a spoonful out of the ocean right
[1:20:28] it's the same same uh makeup but the
[1:20:32] same chemicals in that one spoonful as
[1:20:34] is in the whole ocean but he said Jesus
[1:20:37] was the whole and we are apart
[1:20:40] amen right we are a part of him he he
[1:20:45] gave us a piece of a portion of himself
[1:20:50] now let me ask you this was the portion
[1:20:52] pleased of God was it was it pleasing to
[1:20:55] God the whole was pleasing to God
[1:21:00] the portion was pleasing to God and is
[1:21:02] pleasing to God
[1:21:05] right
[1:21:07] Hallelujah
[1:21:10] Oh Glory to God
[1:21:15] we've got to have that Revelation
[1:21:16] brother sister
[1:21:19] then we can live with no fear why
[1:21:23] because the Bible says if God before us
[1:21:26] right and that's the question that's
[1:21:28] that's the that's the Crux of it if you
[1:21:31] know
[1:21:32] God is for me
[1:21:34] I have no doubt no question
[1:21:37] I am walking into a a a a a a situation
[1:21:42] the the Demons of hell are coming
[1:21:44] against me but I know God is for me
[1:21:48] there's no doubt in my mind there's no
[1:21:50] question
[1:21:51] Satan can't talk me out of it because I
[1:21:54] know that I know that I know
[1:21:59] then
[1:22:01] who can be against us
[1:22:06] amen if God before us who can be against
[1:22:10] us amen Jesus didn't live in fear and
[1:22:13] neither should we brother sister we
[1:22:15] should fear no man no demon no power no
[1:22:18] principality the Bible says nothing not
[1:22:21] in heaven and earth below the Earth I I
[1:22:24] don't know anything that can separate us
[1:22:26] from the love of God death nor height
[1:22:29] death no other creature amen
[1:22:33] amen
[1:22:36] Hallelujah
[1:22:38] then we can stand the test
[1:22:41] we can go through any test and trial
[1:22:44] and yes I said Annie
[1:22:49] sounds like a bold statement
[1:22:52] I've got a big God
[1:22:55] but I know that he won't let me go
[1:22:56] through anything that I I can't come out
[1:22:59] Victorious on the other end
[1:23:01] he won't allow testings but what is good
[1:23:05] for us he won't allow testings but what
[1:23:07] we're ready for it those testings and
[1:23:09] Trials come for a purpose there it's not
[1:23:12] for confusion it's not the harmless it's
[1:23:15] to help us it's to show what we're made
[1:23:18] of it's to cut away the flesh it's to
[1:23:21] help us walk stronger with God
[1:23:25] we can go through any test and trial
[1:23:30] job never wavered because he knew he had
[1:23:33] met God's requirement
[1:23:36] amen
[1:23:37] and if you've received the token the
[1:23:39] Holy Spirit you the the God's
[1:23:42] requirement has been met
[1:23:46] that's why he gives you the token
[1:23:49] as proof that the requirement has been
[1:23:52] met in your life
[1:23:55] and there's nothing can defeat
[1:23:59] yeah
[1:24:00] Hallelujah
[1:24:02] brother sister we can't back down from
[1:24:04] that
[1:24:05] we can't back down from the fact that
[1:24:08] our father is pleased with us
[1:24:12] oh my
[1:24:14] God I can see some of you are still a
[1:24:16] little reluctant
[1:24:18] amen
[1:24:20] I can sense it tonight it's all right
[1:24:22] we're in the right place amen
[1:24:25] Hallelujah
[1:24:26] brother random said this is just a
[1:24:28] little statement here in the
[1:24:29] Philadelphia Church age he just drops a
[1:24:31] little something in here
[1:24:33] he's talking about John Wesley the
[1:24:35] church age messenger of Philadelphia
[1:24:38] and he says this he says many books
[1:24:41] was wrote of slander about him in his
[1:24:44] day
[1:24:46] John Wesley a child of God
[1:24:49] many books written is slandering him
[1:24:54] I've never had one book written about me
[1:24:57] I think if if it happened I would you
[1:24:59] know what would happen what would we do
[1:25:00] would we crawl under a rock and die I
[1:25:03] don't know would we cry how low is me oh
[1:25:06] Lord you know what did I do to deserve
[1:25:08] this
[1:25:09] yeah he had many books
[1:25:12] slandering him
[1:25:14] making fun of him the prophet says
[1:25:18] but listen to this
[1:25:20] they've long been forgotten
[1:25:24] uh-huh they've long been forgotten now
[1:25:28] and so has their authors
[1:25:32] you can't do nothing this is a quote you
[1:25:35] can't do nothing against a child of God
[1:25:38] and get by with it
[1:25:39] [Applause]
[1:25:41] oh Hallelujah
[1:25:43] [Applause]
[1:25:45] he says that you're just fighting the
[1:25:47] air
[1:25:50] because God's going to take them right
[1:25:53] on through anyhow
[1:25:55] oh Hallelujah
[1:25:58] oh my
[1:26:00] God hallelujah why because of who they
[1:26:03] are
[1:26:04] oh there must be the smartest no
[1:26:07] they must I mean you're smart it's okay
[1:26:10] hey man I'm not calling you stupid or
[1:26:12] anything
[1:26:13] oh you don't have to be the smartest
[1:26:15] don't have to be the tallest shortest
[1:26:18] best looking most talented wealthiest
[1:26:21] poorest
[1:26:22] doesn't matter
[1:26:25] child of God
[1:26:28] Hallelujah
[1:26:31] oh listen to what he says here this is
[1:26:32] from the message I have heard but now I
[1:26:34] see he says
[1:26:35] he'd come to a place talking about Jesus
[1:26:38] where he was being tempted of the Lord
[1:26:41] but I'd like to use the word being
[1:26:43] tested
[1:26:44] by the Lord and truly every son that
[1:26:47] cometh to God must first be tested
[1:26:51] tried
[1:26:52] and this is I love this word that he
[1:26:54] uses here child trained
[1:27:00] child trained
[1:27:02] we have you know in our society today
[1:27:04] people have perverted child training
[1:27:07] like spanking and you know training a
[1:27:10] child and people nowadays don't know how
[1:27:11] to train a child but a child training
[1:27:14] when you correct a child when you when
[1:27:18] you you give a child uh you know some
[1:27:21] sort of punishment or something it's
[1:27:23] correction
[1:27:25] right it's because you want them to grow
[1:27:28] into a fully functioning adult
[1:27:32] you want them to grow in perfection
[1:27:36] maturity you're nurturing them so you
[1:27:40] correct them
[1:27:44] and you train them
[1:27:47] so that when they get out in the world
[1:27:48] they're able to withstand things right
[1:27:52] so you give them training right
[1:27:54] sometimes you know you let them go
[1:27:56] through things or you you know you know
[1:27:58] maybe you train them with an allowance
[1:28:00] or something with money so that they
[1:28:02] know how to handle money or different
[1:28:04] things right you train them the idea is
[1:28:08] not to hurt them it's not to harm them
[1:28:09] it's not to keep them down and you know
[1:28:12] slaves or something like that the idea
[1:28:15] is to lift them up
[1:28:19] amen
[1:28:20] so next time you go through a trial
[1:28:23] you say thank you Lord for the child
[1:28:26] training
[1:28:28] because you're making something glorious
[1:28:30] in my life
[1:28:33] so brother Brown says he must be tested
[1:28:35] tried child trained
[1:28:38] and then if the testing gets hard and we
[1:28:40] think it's too hard and we won't listen
[1:28:42] then He says then we become a little
[1:28:44] illegitimate child and not a child of
[1:28:45] God because there's nothing can move
[1:28:47] listen to this
[1:28:48] now he says that the testing if it
[1:28:52] becomes too hard it shows those that are
[1:28:55] illegitimate children
[1:28:58] right
[1:28:59] that's the proof
[1:29:01] you're looking for a proof of the Holy
[1:29:04] Ghost
[1:29:05] a proof that someone is a child
[1:29:08] they can stand the test they can go
[1:29:11] through the fire
[1:29:13] he says because oh I love this
[1:29:16] there's nothing
[1:29:20] say nothing
[1:29:21] nothing with conviction nothing
[1:29:27] that can move a real born-again child of
[1:29:31] God away from his parents see because
[1:29:35] he's part of him
[1:29:38] Hallelujah he says he could no more
[1:29:41] tonight than you could deny yourself
[1:29:45] see you've had the experience
[1:29:49] this is what I was talking about this
[1:29:51] morning it's not about head knowledge
[1:29:53] it's not about following the message
[1:29:55] it's not about being a message believer
[1:29:57] and sitting on a message Pew and
[1:29:59] carrying a message book and having a
[1:30:02] picture of the cloud in your house it's
[1:30:04] none of those things it's an experience
[1:30:06] that you've been trained and tested that
[1:30:10] you know that you've heard the father
[1:30:12] say this is my beloved Son this is my
[1:30:17] beloved daughter in them I am well
[1:30:19] pleased
[1:30:21] amen that's the token
[1:30:25] and once you have that you can stand any
[1:30:28] test and trial
[1:30:31] oh Hallelujah
[1:30:34] nothing can move a child of God away
[1:30:37] from
[1:30:39] their parent
[1:30:41] s my my
[1:30:43] you see this is how uh uh um you know
[1:30:48] Peter and the others when they were in
[1:30:49] prison
[1:30:50] right if they walked and and Paul and
[1:30:53] Silas and those that were in prison and
[1:30:56] were were crucified upside down and were
[1:30:59] fed to lions and all of those things
[1:31:06] they came to Peter remember what what
[1:31:08] they said when they they threw Peter I
[1:31:10] think it was Peter and John right they
[1:31:12] threw him in prison was it Peter and
[1:31:13] John they're them in prison and then
[1:31:15] they told them right they were like
[1:31:18] Don't Preach anymore in that name
[1:31:22] right
[1:31:24] and what did they say are we to obey man
[1:31:28] or God
[1:31:31] boldness
[1:31:33] this was Peter
[1:31:36] this was the same guy
[1:31:38] who a little girl
[1:31:40] when she asked him hey are you one of
[1:31:42] those Jesus Freaks one of those
[1:31:44] followers of this guy that's going to be
[1:31:46] crucified you're one of them aren't you
[1:31:47] and he swore and said no I'm not
[1:31:53] same guy but it wasn't the same guy
[1:31:56] [Music]
[1:31:57] that old guy had died and a new one had
[1:32:00] been born
[1:32:03] and now he's standing before the council
[1:32:06] and saying I won't obey you I will obey
[1:32:11] God
[1:32:12] because now I know who I am and I don't
[1:32:16] have to fear you anymore
[1:32:19] I don't have to be afraid
[1:32:21] I can walk in confidence knowing that
[1:32:24] God is my father and they could throw
[1:32:26] they could throw every religious
[1:32:28] accusation against him
[1:32:30] right they could go in their scriptures
[1:32:32] and in their you know all the different
[1:32:34] things that they have and they could try
[1:32:36] and show him why he was wrong
[1:32:38] try to prove to him with their
[1:32:40] theologians and their great minds this
[1:32:42] is why you're wrong and that's why
[1:32:43] you're wrong won't you recap won't you
[1:32:45] repent but he knew who he was
[1:32:49] amen
[1:32:50] I don't think that Peter could go into
[1:32:52] the Scrolls and match them word for word
[1:32:55] with everything that they had but it
[1:32:57] didn't matter because he knew who he was
[1:33:01] he had met God
[1:33:03] and he had the token in his life
[1:33:07] and he knew that he was pleased of the
[1:33:09] father
[1:33:11] Hallelujah
[1:33:13] Paul and Silas beaten putting into
[1:33:16] prison
[1:33:18] and those prisons weren't like prisons
[1:33:20] today you know prisons today or like you
[1:33:23] know they're like clubs almost right
[1:33:25] they could watch TV and they had you
[1:33:27] know out there pumping and they get food
[1:33:29] and you know it's warm and nice and well
[1:33:31] maybe not nice but you know I mean
[1:33:34] prisons in those days it was expected
[1:33:36] that you are probably gonna die in
[1:33:38] prison because there was so much disease
[1:33:40] and filth and you know they barely fed
[1:33:43] them and here they were beaten their
[1:33:47] wounds open wounds
[1:33:49] left to die in prison
[1:33:55] and what do they do
[1:33:57] they have a jubilee
[1:34:00] amen
[1:34:02] they were worshiping God
[1:34:05] because they were so happy
[1:34:08] that they could be counted worthy of
[1:34:11] suffering
[1:34:13] for Christ
[1:34:14] amen amen
[1:34:18] because they knew
[1:34:21] that the father was pleased
[1:34:24] with them
[1:34:26] amen that they had a father
[1:34:28] and that's the only thing that mattered
[1:34:31] and they met that trial from the
[1:34:34] position of a son
[1:34:39] amen amen
[1:34:44] brother Branham says this is from the
[1:34:45] message when their eyes were opened they
[1:34:47] knew him
[1:34:48] notice as they went down two of them
[1:34:51] this is the road to Emmaus cleopius and
[1:34:53] his friend
[1:34:55] and it was Sunday morning and they was
[1:34:57] on their Road there talking and they was
[1:34:59] going along the road real sad
[1:35:01] and they were really let down with
[1:35:03] something it looked like a veil
[1:35:06] and he says God lets things happen like
[1:35:08] that
[1:35:09] he does that purposely just to test you
[1:35:13] now let me get this before you straight
[1:35:15] so that you'll understand
[1:35:17] that every son that comes to God has got
[1:35:20] to be child trained he's got to be
[1:35:22] tested every son if you're never tested
[1:35:24] you're not a son
[1:35:25] if you can't stand the chastisement of
[1:35:28] God you're illegitimate not a child of
[1:35:30] God you claim God is your father and you
[1:35:32] say oh I can't believe well that shows
[1:35:34] that God is not your father see
[1:35:37] now notice this testing God tests every
[1:35:39] one of his children all that come to him
[1:35:41] must first be tested tried and proved
[1:35:45] now sometimes brother sister it comes to
[1:35:48] a child of God a predestinated one to
[1:35:51] show them that they don't have what they
[1:35:53] thought they had
[1:35:55] amen
[1:35:57] sometimes it comes to shake them up they
[1:36:00] think that they're all right they think
[1:36:01] that they've got the baptism of the
[1:36:03] spirit and they think that that they've
[1:36:06] got something that they don't have and
[1:36:08] sometimes a trusted trial is a blessing
[1:36:10] in disguise because it shows you wow I
[1:36:13] guess I didn't have what I thought I'll
[1:36:15] press in
[1:36:17] you see the the it can go either way
[1:36:20] either if it's a real child of God
[1:36:22] they'll press in if they're not an
[1:36:25] illegitimate child we'll say well if
[1:36:27] that's the way it's going to be
[1:36:28] why should i serve this God
[1:36:31] why didn't they fall away
[1:36:33] but it's the test that proves it
[1:36:37] amen
[1:36:39] it's God's DNA test
[1:36:45] Hallelujah in an age you know where we
[1:36:48] can do these amazing DNS DNA tests and
[1:36:51] uh and I have family members that have
[1:36:54] done it you know now they can just take
[1:36:55] a little swab of your cheek they can
[1:36:57] take some cells out of your cheek and
[1:37:00] you can send them off and they'll do a
[1:37:02] test and they'll tell you yeah your
[1:37:05] ancestors were from this part of the
[1:37:06] world in your part this and your part
[1:37:08] that and you have this much percent and
[1:37:10] oh by the way here's a list of people
[1:37:12] that might be your cousins
[1:37:14] right and it's amazing what they can
[1:37:16] find out just from a few cells from your
[1:37:18] cheek
[1:37:19] because your DNA doesn't lie
[1:37:25] amen it doesn't have feelings
[1:37:28] but it tells the truth it tells exactly
[1:37:30] what you're made of and what you are is
[1:37:34] because of what's in your DNA
[1:37:36] amen if God's got a DNA test tonight
[1:37:40] hallelujah amen amen
[1:37:44] Oh Glory can I read a couple more to you
[1:37:47] tonight I don't know how much time we
[1:37:48] have tonight
[1:37:49] amen I think I went over time this
[1:37:52] morning brother so I'll try and Reign it
[1:37:54] in a little bit tonight
[1:37:56] amen
[1:37:58] amen
[1:38:00] amen you know our pastor he you know he
[1:38:03] he he preaches pretty long I
[1:38:06] say that but he knows it and you know he
[1:38:09] says you know some preachers you've you
[1:38:12] know uh um well anyway some preachers
[1:38:16] can just hit it and stop
[1:38:18] and and our brother brother Baker we
[1:38:20] love him but he says I'm more like a
[1:38:22] 747.
[1:38:24] you know you got to get lined up on the
[1:38:27] runway
[1:38:28] and you gotta Circle a few times around
[1:38:30] the airport and then it's a long
[1:38:32] approach coming in
[1:38:36] we can't just stop amen sometimes it
[1:38:39] takes a little bit amen but we're
[1:38:41] wrapping this up all right tonight I
[1:38:43] just have a few more quotes is that all
[1:38:44] right
[1:38:45] this is from the message doors in a door
[1:38:49] he says the church has to pass through
[1:38:51] the Hall of critics
[1:38:54] we go through it you're going to be
[1:38:56] called a holy ruler
[1:38:59] now
[1:39:00] he says you're going to be called a Holy
[1:39:03] Roller
[1:39:04] the only way that you can be called a
[1:39:06] Holy Roller is if you're doing some
[1:39:08] something
[1:39:12] acting like a Holy Roller
[1:39:16] I'll just dropped that in there the
[1:39:18] church is going to be called a Holy
[1:39:20] Roller
[1:39:21] you're going to be called Everything
[1:39:24] But If You Could Only Hold Your Position
[1:39:26] in Christ
[1:39:28] someday he'll take you to the Hall of
[1:39:30] Fame
[1:39:31] amen we go through the holocritics but
[1:39:34] we're going to the Hall of Fame
[1:39:36] but first we gotta stand criticism oh I
[1:39:38] don't like criticism I can't well I
[1:39:40] don't like it either
[1:39:41] nobody likes it
[1:39:43] amen
[1:39:45] but he says this is where the littleness
[1:39:47] of us stand and this is where it shows
[1:39:49] he that cannot stand chastisement is an
[1:39:51] illegitimate child and not a child of
[1:39:53] God no matter how much he's joined
[1:39:55] Church no matter what he's done if you
[1:39:57] cannot stand chastisement he's
[1:39:58] illegitimate he's not a real child of
[1:40:00] God but a real genuine child of God
[1:40:03] don't care what the world says
[1:40:05] everything else is secondary he's got
[1:40:08] his mind on Christ and that settles it
[1:40:13] whatever Christ says he'll do it
[1:40:16] wherever the lamb goes there with him
[1:40:19] you see and then you see his appearing
[1:40:22] his presence and what he does and he's
[1:40:24] always with his people his bride for
[1:40:26] he's courting her and someday there's
[1:40:28] going to be a wedding supper
[1:40:30] oh Hallelujah knowing the unconditional
[1:40:34] love of God brother sister
[1:40:38] Amen brother Branham says this is just
[1:40:40] one this one little statement here he
[1:40:42] says that I just love this he says my
[1:40:44] action
[1:40:45] this is from God's only provided place
[1:40:47] of worship he says my action
[1:40:49] and the Vindication of God's word in my
[1:40:53] life shows whether I'm a Child of God or
[1:40:56] not
[1:40:58] how you respond to trials
[1:41:02] the Vindication of God's word
[1:41:05] in my life is what he says and now you
[1:41:08] might say well he's Vindicated he's a
[1:41:10] Vindicated Prophet no look the word says
[1:41:14] that they'll be full of love
[1:41:17] patience
[1:41:20] peace
[1:41:22] Joy
[1:41:23] long-suffering
[1:41:26] how about the Vindication of that word
[1:41:28] in our life
[1:41:30] that's what shows whether
[1:41:32] we're a child of God or not
[1:41:35] the proof is in the life that's lived
[1:41:38] amen amen
[1:41:39] amen it's not the proof is not in who
[1:41:42] can explain or argue the doctrine the
[1:41:44] best
[1:41:45] the proof is in the life
[1:41:48] let's live
[1:41:49] the father speaking to his child and
[1:41:53] saying you are my son you are my
[1:41:57] daughter
[1:41:58] I remember the day I well I remember the
[1:42:01] day I got the Holy Ghost but I remember
[1:42:02] the week after
[1:42:05] we talk about an Afterglow I was in
[1:42:07] college at the time
[1:42:09] I was about I guess I was about 20 years
[1:42:11] old I was just turning 21 when I got the
[1:42:13] Holy Ghost but I was in college at the
[1:42:15] time and I remember being in in the
[1:42:18] college you know thing and I was taking
[1:42:20] accounting classes I remember that
[1:42:23] and I remember sitting outside on the
[1:42:26] grass just praying and in the Afterglow
[1:42:29] you know of of that and just marveling
[1:42:31] what God had done and he came and he
[1:42:33] spoke to me
[1:42:34] and he said all your life you've
[1:42:36] identified yourself as a Christian
[1:42:39] but now he says he told me this in my
[1:42:42] heart I didn't hear an audible voice he
[1:42:45] said but now I have identified myself
[1:42:48] with you
[1:42:51] the father speaking
[1:42:53] saying this he was basically saying you
[1:42:56] are my beloved Son
[1:42:58] amen
[1:43:01] Hallelujah
[1:43:04] we've got to have it brother sister we
[1:43:06] cannot stand in this hour without that
[1:43:09] we cannot face down demons
[1:43:12] there's an example of this in Acts I
[1:43:15] think it's chapter 19.
[1:43:17] right when the the the the sons of a man
[1:43:20] called Siva
[1:43:22] right they they saw the things that the
[1:43:24] Believers the true sons of God were
[1:43:26] doing they saw how Paul cast out demons
[1:43:29] and the other believers how they prayed
[1:43:31] and they cast out evil spirits and so
[1:43:33] they thought that they would do it too
[1:43:36] right you remember this story
[1:43:38] writing me go and they they tried to
[1:43:41] cast a demon out of a man and the demon
[1:43:45] speaks back
[1:43:49] right and he challenges them
[1:43:54] and says okay
[1:43:57] you're saying I have to go in the name
[1:44:00] of Jesus Christ who Paul preaches that's
[1:44:02] what they said right
[1:44:04] that tried to cast him out in the name
[1:44:06] of Jesus Christ whom Paul preaches
[1:44:09] and they said well look uh Jesus we know
[1:44:13] certainly
[1:44:15] Paul we know him too we've we've had
[1:44:19] run-ins with him
[1:44:20] and then they asked the question
[1:44:23] who are you
[1:44:26] right
[1:44:28] now any demons got a right to ask the
[1:44:30] question
[1:44:33] right
[1:44:34] who are you
[1:44:37] amen
[1:44:43] who are you
[1:44:44] now if you if you don't have an answer
[1:44:47] to the question you're going to be like
[1:44:48] them
[1:44:50] right they didn't have an answer
[1:44:53] and you know the story the demons just a
[1:44:56] random ragged right guy jumped on ripped
[1:44:59] off their clothes I mean you know had a
[1:45:01] time with them
[1:45:02] they didn't get the victory
[1:45:05] because they didn't have an answer to
[1:45:08] the question who are you
[1:45:12] now it reminds me of so many people in
[1:45:14] our message that we'll say and don't
[1:45:16] take this wrong
[1:45:17] because it's okay to a certain level
[1:45:20] but I I I I always kind of am wary when
[1:45:25] people say brother Branham said brother
[1:45:28] Branham said brother Branham said
[1:45:29] brother Branham said brother Branham
[1:45:30] said brother Branham said brother
[1:45:31] Branham said
[1:45:33] all right that's okay like I said I I do
[1:45:35] it too right to a certain level but at
[1:45:37] some point
[1:45:38] it has to stop being brother Branham
[1:45:40] said
[1:45:42] and you've got to know it for yourself
[1:45:46] right
[1:45:48] because that was the testimony that lot
[1:45:50] had
[1:45:52] lot said well Abraham said God said
[1:45:57] amen
[1:45:59] and he
[1:46:01] lot is a type of a borderline
[1:46:05] lukewarm believer right he didn't go all
[1:46:08] the way in Abraham is a type of the
[1:46:10] elect that heard directly from God
[1:46:13] and lot's only testimony was well
[1:46:16] Abraham said that God said
[1:46:19] so I always get kind of weird just kind
[1:46:22] of you know
[1:46:23] people that always just say well brother
[1:46:25] Branham said and brother Branham said
[1:46:27] and brother Branham said it's like well
[1:46:28] that's good do you have a revelation of
[1:46:31] that
[1:46:32] has God come back and confirmed it to
[1:46:34] you and and maybe they do some do and
[1:46:37] some don't
[1:46:39] some are just saying it because they
[1:46:41] recognize that brother Branham was a
[1:46:43] prophet and they're just saying it's
[1:46:45] like saying
[1:46:47] the Jesus Christ who brother Brandon
[1:46:49] preached
[1:46:52] amen
[1:46:55] but not knowing it for themselves
[1:46:58] we need a revelation of the message for
[1:47:01] ourselves
[1:47:02] we've got to hear it from God ourselves
[1:47:06] Hallelujah
[1:47:08] the one that he was pointing us to
[1:47:11] amen that's right if you really heard
[1:47:13] the prophet's message you were turned
[1:47:16] amen amen and now you're going with the
[1:47:18] one that he pointed you to
[1:47:21] that's the relationship that we have
[1:47:26] but those sons of skiva didn't have the
[1:47:29] ID card
[1:47:32] they didn't have the DNA test
[1:47:36] that said this is a child of God
[1:47:40] what's the ID card it's the token
[1:47:43] amen
[1:47:44] if they had been a token carrying Son of
[1:47:48] God that evil spirit would have had to
[1:47:51] obey them
[1:47:53] and would have had to give way

[1:48:12] now they have the right to ask the
[1:48:14] question
[1:48:16] who are you
[1:48:18] that's why God gives us the token that's
[1:48:21] why he's brother Branham you know taught
[1:48:24] us that when we when we pray and we pray
[1:48:28] for our loved ones he said you hold the
[1:48:29] token out there what was he talking
[1:48:31] about he he was saying pray as a son
[1:48:35] a token is proof of your position with
[1:48:39] God
[1:48:41] it's proof that God has accepted you
[1:48:45] that you are accepted in the Beloved
[1:48:49] that you are one of the Brethren that he
[1:48:51] was talking about when he said he's the
[1:48:53] firstborn among many brethren
[1:48:56] a card carrying Christian
[1:49:00] you know they they the the denominations
[1:49:03] perverted that and they said well you
[1:49:05] got to have a fellowship card or this
[1:49:07] kind of card or whatever the only ID
[1:49:09] that I need is the token
[1:49:12] amen Born Into the family of God
[1:49:18] The Offspring of God have been given the
[1:49:20] authority over every demon power
[1:49:23] amen Jesus proved this
[1:49:25] as a son of God

[1:49:31] Hallelujah
[1:49:34] oh I just love that don't you
[1:49:37] amen don't you just love him
[1:49:40] do you know that you are accepted in the
[1:49:43] Beloved if you don't know that you can
[1:49:46] find out
[1:49:47] just ask him ask him to make it real to
[1:49:51] you he's the only one that can do it I
[1:49:54] could tell you yes or no your pastor
[1:49:56] could say oh yes or no it doesn't matter
[1:50:00] go to him
[1:50:02] he's the only one that gives out the ID
[1:50:04] cards
[1:50:06] he's the one that gives out the token
[1:50:09] amen
[1:50:11] he's the one to make you accept it in
[1:50:13] the Beloved
[1:50:15] amen
[1:50:17] Hallelujah
[1:50:19] oh I just love him
[1:50:21] Amen brother sister we don't have to
[1:50:23] walk in fear
[1:50:25] we've got God on our side
[1:50:28] amen
[1:50:30] we we don't have to you know one of the
[1:50:32] the devil's worst tricks is to try and
[1:50:35] convince you
[1:50:37] that that you're not a child of God or
[1:50:40] try to convince you that somehow he's
[1:50:42] got power over and authority over you
[1:50:45] and it's a lie the only Power that he
[1:50:49] has is the power that you give him
[1:50:54] right amen
[1:50:56] that's the only Power he has now his
[1:51:00] ability is to talk you out of it
[1:51:03] and he's good at it
[1:51:05] so if you let down your sword
[1:51:08] it's because he's convinced you to let
[1:51:11] down your sword your sword will defeat
[1:51:14] him
[1:51:15] Anytime Anyplace under any circumstances
[1:51:19] he will defeat him
[1:51:22] but he can talk you into lowering your
[1:51:26] sword
[1:51:27] amen
[1:51:29] but you have authority over him tonight
[1:51:34] amen
[1:51:35] now that doesn't mean like I said before
[1:51:37] that I mean you're not going to go
[1:51:38] through trials amen doesn't mean you're
[1:51:40] going to be spared from trials and tests
[1:51:43] and hard times sometimes God allows
[1:51:45] Satan to not sometimes that is God's
[1:51:48] part of God's toolbox for you to allow
[1:51:51] Satan allowed demons to to to to to buff
[1:51:55] at you and to come against you
[1:51:58] but brother sister we are not defeated
[1:52:03] amen though we can't see the victory
[1:52:05] right now
[1:52:06] we are not defeated and we will not be
[1:52:10] defeated a child of God will stand every
[1:52:13] test and they will come out in the end
[1:52:15] Victorious
[1:52:19] Hallelujah
[1:52:21] we've got to know that tonight we've got
[1:52:24] to have confidence in what God has made
[1:52:27] us to be
[1:52:28] amen he's not confident in your flesh
[1:52:32] but he's confident in what he's put in
[1:52:35] you
[1:52:36] amen he's confident in that seed that
[1:52:38] he's placed in there that he's quickened
[1:52:41] by the Holy Ghost he's confident in that
[1:52:43] he's confident in his word and he knows
[1:52:45] that it will produce what he determined
[1:52:48] that it would be
[1:52:50] you believe that tonight

[1:53:10] by the Pharisees
[1:53:13] he said I know who my father is
[1:53:19] he said you claim to be the children of
[1:53:21] Abraham that was their claim
[1:53:24] right they were relying on their
[1:53:27] relationship to Abraham
[1:53:31] he says you claim to be the children of
[1:53:34] Abraham but he said you are of your
[1:53:36] father the devil and his works you will
[1:53:39] do
[1:53:40] amen
[1:53:41] but he said I know who my father is
[1:53:44] he was confident
[1:53:47] he knew where he stood
[1:53:49] he knew where he stood with God
[1:53:54] amen
[1:53:56] we've got to know that tonight

[1:55:20] forget we can get our Eagle Eye filmed
[1:55:23] over amen as it were
[1:55:26] but we've got to know that we're a
[1:55:28] beloved child of God
[1:55:29] [Music]

[2:03:14] we call it now
[2:03:20] [Music]
[2:03:22] many many men
[2:03:25] I don't have to ask who enjoyed
[2:03:28] the word of God
[2:03:31] uh you know I'll say it like this when
[2:03:33] the word comes like that it's like God
[2:03:36] opened up your diary
[2:03:38] and read your diary to everybody
[2:03:41] well you you the only one knows what was
[2:03:44] in the diary
[2:03:45] right it's amazing what God can do
[2:03:49] enough brother I have to repent because
[2:03:51] there have been times I've told people I
[2:03:54] know you got the Holy Ghost
[2:03:56] you know and I'm not going to say that
[2:03:58] ever again
[2:04:00] it makes sense
[2:04:02] I don't know nothing
[2:04:04] you've got to know
[2:04:06] and so that was a correction for me
[2:04:09] because I don't want to mislead anybody
[2:04:12] and I don't want them to think they've
[2:04:13] got the Holy Ghost when they don't have
[2:04:15] it all right God has to witness that to
[2:04:18] you
[2:04:19] from now on in this church I won't be
[2:04:23] telling you that I won't even say well I
[2:04:25] believe you got it you got to know that
[2:04:27] you know that you know that you got it
[2:04:29] and I love the way the word of God came
[2:04:32] tonight I that's the way I I just
[2:04:35] appreciate his ministry
[2:04:36] because you go in areas that most people
[2:04:38] don't go in and he brings it in such a
[2:04:41] wonderful way
[2:04:43] it's just like how could I say it it's
[2:04:45] like medicine to the Bone or however you
[2:04:47] want to say it
[2:04:48] it's a sweetness that God brings with
[2:04:50] the word of God handling us as children
[2:04:54] and I love that I love that because
[2:04:56] that's who we are and I know by God's
[2:05:00] grace that
[2:05:01] you have to know who you are at this day
[2:05:04] and time
[2:05:06] and and I love the the attributes of
[2:05:08] Christ as a man as a son you know
[2:05:12] walking in Victory walking with no fear
[2:05:15] all of those things are very important
[2:05:17] for us to know because if we have a part
[2:05:20] of the ocean
[2:05:21] all of the attributes of the ocean are
[2:05:23] in us if we have a part of Christ all of
[2:05:26] that is in US
[2:05:28] we just need to make the connections
[2:05:30] amen you love the Lord
[2:05:33] anyway God heard me heard My Cry
[2:05:39] and now we have a a a a a a a cup and
[2:05:43] all that good stuff thank you brother
[2:05:46] yes
[2:05:47] so we won't have to use the red cup
[2:05:49] because I don't want to make the YouTube
[2:05:54] brother Brooks that got so liberal he's
[2:05:56] serving the laws in a red cup
[2:06:02] at least it's red it stands for the
[2:06:04] blood right
[2:06:06] but God is so good to us and I'm glad
[2:06:08] the brother felt inspired to go get me a
[2:06:11] cup and all of that that was the Lord
[2:06:13] Jesus because in my heart I I didn't
[2:06:15] want to offended anybody and I didn't
[2:06:18] want to postpone uh what we planned to
[2:06:20] do as far as communion
[2:06:23] communion to me means a lot to me I
[2:06:25] think it's one of the most important
[2:06:28] Services
[2:06:29] of all times
[2:06:32] uh because it's what Jesus did before he
[2:06:35] passed
[2:06:36] and I believe I've got it right brother
[2:06:38] branham's last message was communion
[2:06:40] before he had his great accident
[2:06:43] it it just happened that way but Jesus
[2:06:46] also promised that we'll have communion
[2:06:48] again when it's all over
[2:06:51] communion is not a sign of disaster or
[2:06:54] defeat
[2:06:55] communion is Victory
[2:06:57] and every time we have communion we're
[2:06:59] showing the victory we're trophies of
[2:07:02] God
[2:07:02] of what he did and because of his
[2:07:05] sacrifice
[2:07:06] we're Worthy
[2:07:08] right because we're not worthy of
[2:07:10] ourselves
[2:07:11] is his worthy worthiness and in our
[2:07:15] lives are what hid in Christ Jesus
[2:07:18] that's how it is and we examine
[2:07:20] ourselves to see what where we've gone
[2:07:23] wrong and as the brother said as the
[2:07:25] Lord spoke to us this evening when we
[2:07:27] confess our sins he's faithful and just
[2:07:29] to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse
[2:07:31] us from all our unrighteousness
[2:07:34] I do not understand Christians who don't
[2:07:36] take communion especially those who are
[2:07:39] doing their best to walk up right before
[2:07:41] the Lord
[2:07:42] to deny communities to deny that you are
[2:07:46] part of Christ
[2:07:47] you know like they say you know it's
[2:07:50] you're damned if you do and you're
[2:07:51] damned if you don't that means if you if
[2:07:53] you do it unworthily and you know you're
[2:07:55] not you're living a hypocritical life
[2:07:57] then don't do it until you make it right
[2:08:00] making it right is simply simple as
[2:08:03] asking for forgiveness as simple as as
[2:08:06] just confessing your sins before the
[2:08:09] Lord and any brother and sister you may
[2:08:11] have offended you asked for forgiveness
[2:08:14] you get right with God and you're worthy
[2:08:16] you're now ready for it because there's
[2:08:18] no one perfect Christian there's not a
[2:08:20] perfect Christian it's the perfect God
[2:08:22] in the Christian
[2:08:23] and so we love the Lord we appreciate
[2:08:26] everything he's he's done for us thank
[2:08:28] you brother
[2:08:29] I enjoyed the word
[2:08:31] and I hope and trust that when time come
[2:08:34] again you can come again
[2:08:36] amen I love I love words like that I
[2:08:39] love it it gives you that time to really
[2:08:42] hear what God is saying and he ministers
[2:08:45] to me he ministered to me if you didn't
[2:08:47] minister to nobody else I was fed
[2:08:49] tonight and I don't say that just to be
[2:08:51] saying it I'm telling you the truth
[2:08:53] there's a lot of things said that made
[2:08:55] me see a lot of things I've done wrong
[2:08:57] you know with others loved ones and
[2:08:59] everybody else and I was I was able to
[2:09:02] see you know how it is and it's so
[2:09:04] simple yet so powerful how it is to be a
[2:09:07] Christian if we only just
[2:09:10] walk in the light as he is in the light
[2:09:13] it's really it's really not complicated
[2:09:16] and and to know that to take the test in
[2:09:19] the trials and how often we say oh God I
[2:09:22] can't take no more Gods oh yes you can
[2:09:24] [Music]
[2:09:26] when we say we can't take no more that's
[2:09:29] when he pulls a little bit more on us
[2:09:32] because he knows how much you can bear
[2:09:34] and he knows the the quality of gold
[2:09:38] that he's working with and he's got to
[2:09:41] get all of the draws out of you and
[2:09:44] that's what I want I want all of the
[2:09:46] darkness all of the draws anything
[2:09:48] that's going to hinder him from using my
[2:09:50] body I want him to
[2:09:52] take it away
[2:09:54] so as we stand we're going to turn to
[2:09:56] First Corinthians
[2:09:59] the 11th chapter
[2:10:02] I trust everybody is at a peace of mind
[2:10:04] because there is a sweet peace in this
[2:10:06] place
[2:10:07] I just feel sorry for those who don't
[2:10:10] come
[2:10:11] but I always say Lord forgive me if I'm
[2:10:14] judging wrong I said
[2:10:15] you'll find the real church at Communion
[2:10:20] some people can't make it because of
[2:10:21] their jobs and things of that nature we
[2:10:23] understand that but we're saying that
[2:10:25] when people set home
[2:10:27] and understand that they could be a part
[2:10:29] of this service
[2:10:31] you know
[2:10:32] I don't understand it
[2:10:35] do you know that those who were at the
[2:10:36] communion of Jesus were the elected
[2:10:39] chosen of God
[2:10:41] those same people that were sitting at
[2:10:43] the table will be there with him except
[2:10:45] Judas
[2:10:47] you see what I'm saying
[2:10:48] and every time he had communion it
[2:10:50] wasn't just given to any and everybody
[2:10:52] it was a selected group of people
[2:10:55] oh I feel like Shout
[2:10:59] I really do I'm not just saying that I'm
[2:11:01] I'm holding it down right now
[2:11:05] praise the Lord
[2:11:07] oh God 11th chapter
[2:11:11] of First Corinthians
[2:11:13] which started the 23rd verse
[2:11:17] for I have received of the Lord that
[2:11:19] which also I delivered unto you
[2:11:23] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[2:11:25] which he was betrayed took bread
[2:11:29] and when he had given thanks he break it
[2:11:32] and said take eat this is my body which
[2:11:35] is broken for you this do in remembrance
[2:11:37] of me after the same manner also he took
[2:11:41] the cup when he had stopped saying this
[2:11:44] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[2:11:47] this do ye as often as you drink it in
[2:11:49] remembrance of me
[2:11:51] for as often as you eat this bread and
[2:11:53] drink this cup ye do show the Lord's
[2:11:56] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[2:11:59] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[2:12:01] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[2:12:03] of the body and blood of the Lord but
[2:12:06] let a man examine himself and so let him
[2:12:09] eat of that bread and drink of that cup
[2:12:11] for he that eateth and drinketh
[2:12:13] unworthily eateth and drink a damnation
[2:12:15] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[2:12:18] body for this cause many are weak and
[2:12:21] sickly among you and many sleep for if
[2:12:24] we would judge ourselves we should not
[2:12:26] be judged but when we are judged we are
[2:12:29] chasten of the Lord that we should not
[2:12:31] be condemned with the world wherefore my
[2:12:35] brethren when you come together to eat
[2:12:37] tarry one for another and if any man
[2:12:40] hunger let him eat at home that you come
[2:12:44] not together with unto condemnation and
[2:12:47] that the rest I will set in order when I
[2:12:50] come
[2:12:52] amen those of us who are going to
[2:12:54] participate in communion what we do is
[2:12:57] come up front
[2:13:00] amen
