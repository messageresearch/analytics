TRANSCRIPT
========================================
for amen forgot to turn it on amen so as we are here tonight let us turn to First John we start with first John we'll go second third we'll finish this um by the grace of God we we may stand and I'll read first John 1-5 we take these first verses few verses by the grace of God that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and was have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things write we unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light in him is no Darkness at all sixth verse if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth let us pray our gracious father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for your goodness we thank you for the reading of the word we pray that you break the word to us Lord in this day and hour God we need more of you we need all of you Lord we pray that you would fill us with your word anoint us oh God that we would be true Witnesses in this hour in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated won't be much long but uh I felt like I was directed to study this and by the grace of God um we know um John is it's beautiful because John is the not only the disciple of Jesus but he's also the young a younger brother and he is a brother a half brother of Jesus Christ and we know John was also one that the scripture they said that he was always in the bosom of Jesus and you know how Brothers do they hug on each other and fellowship with each other but and and Jesus was close to John John also was a type of the Bride the Bride of Jesus Christ so there were things that John encountered with Jesus that the others did not uh encounter and that was that close intimate relationship um um so much so that God chose him and he was one that was translated into our day and that's why I believe in time travel because John definitely had a he traveled in time and he saw all day the beautiful part about this epistle is that he wasn't the gospel didn't come to to disciples by someone else they it was firsthand they they they knew what Jesus looked exact they they knew him they saw him they were able to handle him and that's much more than you know we know him by Spirit the Bible said we don't know him no more after the flesh but after the spirit but can you imagine how that must have been to be able to handle Jesus to touch him to to feel what he felt and to embrace him you know and they they got that PRI and they get that at the end too but you know my my point is to be a witness it's not secondhand information it is something that you say hey I was there you know it's like we used to sing that song you ought to have been there when the Holy Ghost came you know and and and and basically say you you can't tell me it doesn't exist CU I'm a witness that it does he changed me and so here John is not only seeing this man because you got to realize that the revelation of Jesus Christ was Progressive with the disciples they didn't see him they saw him as the Messiah when they when they first met him and how they they knew that much about him was because John was telling them that listen my Ministry is just to is a forerunner of the great one to come and you know can you imagine that you know if John had not pointed him out they would not have known him because he looked like any ordinary you you know what I mean I mean he he wasn't someone that was so goodlooking everybody would turn their head no no no he fed he he he fit right into the regular crowd of people and as we understand he wasn't some tall elegant man he was short you know and you know a short man and um you know so he could get lost in the crowd so you know he did that several time he passed right through the people and they didn't even know him but here John says listen my eyes have seen him and it's amazing because how God word this uh by way of John my eyes we have seen him and we have looked upon him and our hands have handled him of the word of Life Now understand this they had to come to know he was that in all of the course of their being with him three and a half years they saw all the Miracles the miraculous things they had done uh but you know uh the one question Jesus asked him you know whom do you say the son of man am you know and and he he really put that out to all of them and then he said tell me Peter which who who do you say I the son of man am and he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this unto you but my Father which is in heaven so I say this too so that you can understand stand by the grace of God your R your your knowing Jesus Christ is by Revelation and your revelation of Jesus Christ must always come back to the word it because the word the Bible said read the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me in other words they are witness of who I am now but these people you got to understand they were right from the old Testament they uh was of the law and here come Jesus Christ full of grace and truth he spent three and a half years constantly telling these people what Grace and Truth was all about is no longer eye for an eye tooth for a tooth no if if if a man slap you you turn to cheat you know uh do unto others as you would have them do unto me that's what he taught them so you got to understand we're talking about tradition we're talking about long lasting hundreds of years you know these people been killing each other that's why Israel doing what they doing now they still under the eye for an eye and a to for Toth so you got to understand that when Jesus came he was light and and it's like if how can I say it a blind man if a man blind man opens his eyes to light too fast it can become it can be more harmful but Jesus taught them little by little on who he was in order to he was feeding them like babes that's basically what he was doing because spiritually that's what they were and he could have just come up and say hey I am the Messiah but he wanted that Revelation he wanted that to be excuse me a revelation and not not because I told you so he asked Peter he asked the group who do you say that I am the son of man now the word term son of man means Prophet okay so he said now who who is this Prophet right so he's elevating he's literally coming to elevate the revelation of who he is I'm not just a prophet I'm more than a prophet and the only way that you're going to know this is that my father reveals it to you and in other words it's the spirit of the Lord that quickens right not man you can't educate man into Jesus Christ with all the knowledge that he may have without the Holy Ghost he still lays in darkness because he just think he knows right the Holy Ghost is something that's revealed so much into your soul into your heart that you know you know that you know that you know but John I think about them and it's a it's something that we we don't have the experience I mean even God in this last day uh didn't allow us to experience William brandom right one of the greatest prophets on the face of the Earth and he comes along lives and die and all we we have is is is the tapes and the books and most of all we have the Holy Ghost that witnesses to us that that was Christ in his ministry right listen and I heard brother randam say this the other day he said our this church age what we call the bride we will receive the greatest reward of all the church ages amen why because we're believing something that no one else can believe we're seeing something that no one else can see and it's only because you were ordained to to do so right you know you never saw Jesus and I'm coming back to this but you never saw Jesus out there screaming in in the in in the street you know where are my 12 disciples no he handpicked everyone one of them right and the unction was on both sides even when he said come follow me they could have said man are you crazy no but they were anointed to follow him and we know it is with the same with us that's how we know we are a witness you know in other words we you know somebody can tell you about the Holy Ghost but when you receive it you know now you know that you know that you know that you know like I was telling somebody saidwell how do you know because the Holy Ghost is not a shout it's not a dance it's not a speak in tongues it may do all of that but it's a change of life amen that's right it changes your life am from the life of Darkness into the life of light all right so listen what is a witness a witness is one that have knowledge of an event or change from personal observation or experience you know that's where gossip comes in let's say this somebody said well you know I was at the basketball game and but you weren't but you should have seen how that that man was put that but if you you weren't there you're going to tell that story like you was there and then somebody going to say were you there but you know what you you wasn't a witness you just took somebody else's experience and that's what a lot of people do as Christian we take somebody else's experience it's like what a lot of people in the message do we take brother brandom's experience and try to apply them to ours but they're not yours you weren't a witness though you believe it a witness must have the same experience you were there right and so when you know that you've been there nobody can take it from you that's right it's like I love the way Brother Rich says it you when you see truth you can't unsee it truth is truth and now you are witness to the truth because something in you says amen and that amen turns into an experience right every Christian should have some some kind of experience and when I say experience doesn't necessarily fall under sensation right experience is something that changes you I have the experience that I have been changed right so you got to understand to be a witness doesn't necessarily mean you're going to be so emotional like everybody else but you're such a witness that is the life is real to you live live it amen it's a living situation right I am a witness I was there you know we always say that you know and and and and and you say what do you mean brother books I was there see some things when I could say it like this when you really believe that you are the bride of Christ and how do you know you are because you had an experience remember the old story about how the Rancher son came to the ranch and all those girls was having a party and and looking to marry the Rancher but those girls in the house never had the experience like the one in the backyard throwing out the water the one out in the backyard throwing out the water he came to her she didn't come to him amen but he he literally saw her and then he approached her from the fence because he was watching her right and you got to understand he calls she's responding nobody can take that experience from her right though she's still dressed in rags though she's still throwing out dish water her position in the house never did change until till he that day of the Rapture amen y'all know what I mean until that day he came and took her away amen but in all of that she still was bride but yet she was a dishwasher still she still was bride though she was being rejected by all the others she still was bride why because she had an experience she was she was a witness if there was no other witness she was the witness and he was the witness that he proposed to her see out of out of the mouth of two witnesses let every word two to three witness let every word be established so when God comes to you you know it now nobody else might not see him you know they may not feel him don't get me wrong I love feelings I love all of that but when you are connected with God you cannot be unconnected amen that's the point it's like a tree standing by the rivers of water I shall not be moved and you go through the storms you go through the battles but there's something that still connects you and what it is is that experience of of connecting with God you are a witness that's why I continually preach the grace of God because you can't you can't go by your own works but you go by the experience the witness that you met him and he's met you you know [Music] him listen let's let's uh uh go here to uh let's read the second verse again for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness right and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us now he says I'm a witness now we we we we this life has been manifested unto us amen right meaning I have received the Holy Ghost I have received him and this life is manifested because like Paul said it's not I that live but Christ that lives in us right the Holy Ghost is a manifestation there is no way you could that's why Jesus said don't take the light and put it under a bushel but put it in a place where people can see the light that you'll be a witness right because if you are a witness to me Jesus is saying my Father in heaven will glorify will be glorified by you being a witness to others right because they're going to say oh that person is a Christian I know they're a Christian right so we we when with a life and when I keep saying this because let me say it like this people get salvation mixed up with religion religion is just learning how to do things right you know oh you can say well what do you mean it's just a habit you can say that man go to a Baskin of robins every Thursday religiously it's just a habit you you you learn how to do a certain thing you know and you could be a Buddhist and have religion Muslims are religious because they doing acts that appear to be holy but they're not holy y'all understand me because you can't be holy without the Holy Ghost amen see so all of the outward stuff is basically religion and we find that among ourselves that's right right you can practice to be right you can be religious but Jesus said said except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Pharisees you and no wise have a part of me and what was the difference they practice everything right remember the the the Rich Young Ruler God had nothing against him oh the Bible said that even Jesus loved him but he didn't have the experience and because you meet Jesus don't I bump into him don't meet oh I bumped up into him you know there's a lot of people that bumped up into him it was the same ones that's crying out crucifying but then there were those those who were not only bumping but they got a touch like the woman with the issue of blood so she had an experience right it it's like when the when the when the messenger from Jared came to Jesus and said my Lord my my master has a daughter who's sick or son you know yeah but he he said oh well I met him oh no you you you met him but you had to your experience didn't change you but when jarot came and he says listen Lord I I'm a man of of uh authority too I know what when I say to my my servants do this they do that when I say do this they do that and all I need you to do is speak the word so he had a confidence so now he has an experience that the Lord Jesus is a man of authority he is God or the Son of God and all I all he has to do is speak the word amen see that's how the pH I mean excuse me that's how the Gentiles supposed to be if you truly say you God and say Lord speak the word if you really listen faith is a substance it's the holy spirit is God right so you say well what do you mean you know we see the word of God the Bible said by faith God created the heavens and the Earth well God didn't have a wand in his hand the Bible said all things were created who by him so if if it was created by Him He is Faith Jesus Christ is Faith and the Bible said we live by what the faith of God but that's the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit can never without his word amen and so that you understand we all live in a three- room house right and is consist of you know the flesh the spirit and the soul and Jesus or the Holy Spirit can be reside on your flesh and cause you to dance and cry and everything it can reside in your spirit cause you to speak in tongues have a great time but the real conversion comes in the soul that's the deepest part of a man and once it comes into the soul it locks the door you understand me you're sealed in there it's locked it locks the door and it can't get out and you can't leave it and he won't leave you and that Soul how can I say it produces life like I read the Scripture it can't be life and death it's got to be life right because that's who Jesus is right so you got to understand by the grace of God in that six verse says if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth so that goes for all of us if you in the spirit and you in the light of God you're going to walk in the light you're going to talk in the light and the Bible said if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all our sins amen so what are you saying brother Brooks see he's not a Baptist Jesus Anymore he's not a a uh Pentecostal or Methodist Jesus Anymore he's Jesus Christ the word amen the Bible said his name shall be called the word of God right in the beginning was the word and at the ending is the word amen the alpha has become the Omega right so what are you what what are you saying brother Brooks so we're part of that word amen right you're born with sinful flesh right that means you're going to make mistakes here with all that Holy Ghost because listen everybody has a Measure of Faith everybody in here we don't have the same level of faith and that's no mistake that was God's doing amen right think about his Apostles they all were different and in the midst of all of that you still had D doubting Thomas he's there the chair was already ready for him 12 Thrones is that correct come on somebody come on so you got to realize by the grace of God but one thing for certain he doubting Thomas as we call him he was a powerful witness at least he wasn't no hypocrite that's right you know people say well you should should be asking for signs and you shouldn't be ask well if you sincere amen and you need God to do something for you there's nothing wrong with that Lord I believe he's Lord If he if I can thrust my hand into his side I love that because you take thrust you know we're not talking about gently move it through thrust and Jesus never said ooo that hurt why we had a body that could not feel pain his body was different and that's the kind of body he's promising us amen hallelujah what would a man HHH give for his soul that was the question uh uh that was asked in the book Book of Job what what would a man give you know Jesus said God said go ahead and try him go ahead and try job had had has had enough experiences with me amen I know he'll not leave me amen I know he'll stand with me right now you think about how many H oh we have it hard oh we have it hard none of us have had it hard like Jo and no matter how Jo was tempted and and how job the devil beat him oh I don't know oh my I can't imagine I can't imagine one day everything goes away I lost my children I lost my cat my cows everything everything's gone in one day and job said the lord giveth and the lord taketh away that's when you know you've had a genuine experience with God you know that word this is what I love about it I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you I will always be with you you Proverbs 8 any questions comments amen Proverbs 8 Proverbs 8 27-30 this book is a book of Faith Jesus the Bible said he learned his obedience by way of suffering so a lot of time you suffer in order to learn obedience right when God said don't do it you do it he spanks you and then you learn that's how we that that's that's how we learn all of us learn that way right and I I remember getting a whipping one time it was so bad I never did that thing again so sometimes our our spanking is that our chastisement of the Lord is sometimes more severe at times than in others right so by the grace of God you say well brother books I don't understand that well you know when there was a time we used to get spanked all the time you know what I mean we get that spanking but then when you grow up and you know better a little more better you know what God says well if you if you're not going to do this I'm not going to do that don't we do our kids like that I'm not going to let you get on the with the the iPad or the phone or the what and God is the same way he'll do the same thing in order to get your attention and try he's trying to teach you obedience and that's an experience can I say this by the grace of God we always talk about the Acts of the Apostles or the acts the book of Acts uh writing a a brand new book don't you know that in in the time of Smyrna when they was put uh being persecuted Ed that was a book of Acts people were dying being fed to the Lions and they were holding fast to their faith how many of us could do that they were a witness y'all understand me they were Witnesses of Jesus Christ and the life they possessed it that's all I say Lord just let me possess that where you you you have preeminence not 99% 100% of my life ruling it no matter how ridiculous I might look to someone else come on and you think about it we we we look at the Old Testament but I'm going tell you something those Old Testament Saints had Faith how many of you believe Ezekiel report Ezekiel said the spirit of the Lord Came Upon me lifted me up my by my head my the head of my hair and took me up into heaven it almost sound like a joke but it's reality I mean you know here is Elijah taken up by the chairs of fire you believe that I believe Noah there was a flood I believe the serpent I believe there was a virgin I believe that see what I'm saying so if I believe that why can't I believe the word for my day I want to be a witness and brother Bram tells us that this church will be a supernatural Church omnipotent she have the power of God in her yall understand me and I cannot settle for this mediocre type of religion and that's what it's become with a lot of people acting and doing the right thing cuz religion is just a covering we don't need covering we need change see we're there now I don't mean to preach I get excited sorry about that Proverbs 8:27 through 30 you love the Lord can someone read that for me 27 through3 of always can you believe that yes sir he talking about Jesus well if he's talking about Jesus he's talking about you too cuz you and I were in him this is the revelation of this message we we can't allow this message to be enaged by time this is message is eternal amen I I can't explain what I'm saying here it is eternal and we have allowed Satan to to to to to to put it in this uh Dimension no that's Church age stuff Amen in in in the bride AE there there's no no fence no wall because it's Eternal it has no beginning no ending the more you want to see the more God will give to you amen that's right the more change you want God will give you the change nothing hinder you so well brother books I've been this I've been that I've done this I've done that that's in your mind but in the mind of God you never did it in the first place and you got to learn how to think like the word says because when the word says s this that and the other you take it and you run with it it there is now no condemnation to those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit see what I'm saying but we imprison ourselves by our own condemnation our own thoughts about ourselves why should I remember anything I've ever done if I've made right with God if I've confessed it then I'm free all of us are free by way of confession but brother Bram said in which the word says also but if you don't confess your sin you got to confess that don't mean I've got to you know put it in the newspaper but if I've offended someone if I've done wrong if I whatever I've done God knows and I need to make those yeah go down in there and says throw it up it hurts to tell on yourself it does that's one of the hardest things for us to do as if God don't know already right or we used should say in the in the Pentecostal Church uh uh uh Lord uh forgive me of my known and unknown sins what unknown you don't have no unknown sin if the Holy Ghost is there he check you before you even do it that's right that's right huh he checked you don't don't and we're like a child right but that's that's he said we're children and when we get over there we'll still be children so we we we you know oh you know iniquity he he had to die for the the iniquity of our our iniquity and iniquity is to to know to do good and do it it's not you know how many times during the day we do that amen that's right you know what I'm saying and so but he died for that but listen you can't be forgiven unless you confess your iniquity Lord I knew I did wrong don't say the devil made me do it the devil didn't make you do it you did it James said when we're drawn away we're drawn away with our own lust and entic that's coming from inside not outside y'all understand me but in order to get rid of that that what you you know it's it's being that light being that light you know one of the questions and I'm I'm going move forward because that light is God brought that light to us which is the Holy Spirit to to shine forth out of us nah we're not supposed to cloak it you know I mean you you're at a rest you're at a rest uh at a register and the Holy Ghost come and and hit you Hallelujah you need to say hallelujah cuz that person at the register might need that Hallelujah but sometime we so we we're not dead enough to we think about oh that might be embarrassing huh God is merciful to us is that right I think it was Ezekiel he told him to go make uh bread bread out of the dong of men that's right Ezekiel said Lord have mercy and gave him a beast to do it I think a cow whatever it was he had to make bread out of it and eat it now that sounds nasty but what it was that was the way God saw Israel amen so he had reflect to Israel that he was preaching to Israel he was basically through his action he was preaching to is Israel what God was saying about them right and he did it he did just what God Said do am right I was there you said what brother Brooks there's only let me tell you there's only one man suffered more than job as far as the records shows and that was Jesus Christ am so if Jesus said Lord I come not to do my own will but thy will be done so understand this that's where you die that's where Jesus had to die in Gethsemane he needed his will to dieen so God's will could be be made manifest did he fear Pro his punishment did was there something as a man he did not want to go to Calvary you understand me right and sometimes there are things in your life you don't want to give up but you got to give up in order to man EST Christ not my will but thine be done Lord let's move on you love the Lord so we can see we were there I believe that and because I believe that I believe it's going to be made manifested in me I believe when I read that scripture it was like the angel coming to Mary said thou shall y you you're favorite of God and you're going to bring forth the Son of God and I believe in my life and in your life and you could believe it we're here to bring forth the life of of the son of God amen we've been birthed into another dimension and um yeah that's why the devil fights me so much he knows I I got an understanding of what God is requiring and he's doing everything to keep me from getting there but the point is he can't stop this he can't because you know what he what the word of God says he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it the devil might hold you up a little bit but he can't stop it let's go back let's go to uh St John please God always show a witness the Bible said he never left himself without a witness and even sometime when you think you all by yourself there's somebody testifying right you go down to the marketplace and we see Christians down there and you say well they don't belong they ain't in the message most of them people are in the message more than message people that's true they are definitely witnessing Jesus Christ amen you say oh no well John did and John disciples did what they could do to witness Jesus Christ they just not didn't have the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ they had not yet received the Holy Ghost but they were anointed brother bam said they were anointed John 1 St John 1 7-10 the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light what are you doing this is the light of the hour this is the message of the hour we come to Bear witness of the light right we come to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light talking about John but was sent to Bear witness of that light like brother brandham brother brandham was not the light but he came to bear witness of the light why amen cuz everybody had their revelation of Jesus but he was the only one that could identify the true Jesus Christ because he was like John that's why I say in in in in Paul said there are many jesuses and even today they are many jesuses denominational jesuses right but there is a real Jesus and that Jesus is has has has has been identified by the by Malachi 4 and we come to make manifest that that's the real one what's the difference between us if there's no Supernatural here that's right we what witnessing we doing because I'm going to tell you like this there are many Pentecostal churches that are doing Supernatural and that's the children's bread am but we need a life that is so with so full of love that people can feel it as it approaches that's one thing I Love About Animals most animals know when you love them you can be you can you can you can be I've seen this on TV and I as documentaries people that love lions are not afraid of lions and the Lions respect them most of the time now if you catch them in a hungry spell that might be something different but if they're not hungry right because their instinct is to kill and eat but if they're not hungry they will respect you how many tribes you've seen you know those the the African fellas they they get on a group and they walk they kill a I've seen where they go and take the Lion's meat and break it up and then leave out the lion leaves the lion bewildered what what what makes them do that faith that that that's that's that's faith that makes them believe that and and you know what one thing about faith I don't care how nature is nature has to obey faith faith is a law of God whether you be a sinner or a saint yes sir that faith has to be obeyed amen and that's that's the way it works but anyway let's move on he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light that was the True Light which lith every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not is't that amazing but then you and I have an opportunity to know him my God that is so that is so amazing to me you know what I'm saying I'm going tell you one thing one thing y'all may not some of y'all may not even think about it but you know what even the fish of the ocean obeys God even unto the death where all those fish came that Peter caught you know most fish if they saw a net or knew a net was there to try to get rid of uh get out of it but those fish gathered so many and what was it God making it happen and and all he had to do is say throw the net on the other side and the fish wherever they were whether he created them or not at that point in time had to obey nothing but the truth Nothing But The Truth Listen let me move on coming from the message at Thy word Lord now you see how you get all of this because we can't physically touch him this is not a physical thing this is spiritual and now we he he he touches us and we touches him right we we must learn by the grace of God that this thing is a growing I I tell you what one thing I I I wish sometime I have wished I've had wish I in the past I wished that when I got saved I would be would have been made perfect complete but you know what I would not enjoy heaven like I'm going to enjoy amen that's right right every trial every test everything we go through is benefiting us to the point that when we get to heaven you'll never get tired am you'll never get tired of heaven heaven will never be boring you'll never get tired there will always be something because God is eternal there will always be something new am because God love Revelation amen now when we get there the revelation of Salvation will be complete but what about the revelation of Heaven what about the revelation of eternal life y'all know what I'm saying it won't stop there won't be just a book of 66 books you know what I'm saying that word will be a Living Word you'll be the Living Word and God won't even have to tell you what what to do you will already know you have the Mind you'll have the mind of God like Adam did in the beginning God didn't say Adam this is the way I want you to name the Adam uh animals his mind and God mind was so connected Adam didn't skip a beat he named every animal the just the way God thought those animals should be named let's move on I'm enjoying this then when he come from that that message at Thy word uh paragraph 18 then when he come out here to the side of the mount isn't that something I believe the Apostle said that our trials are better than gold to US think of it God might have let you get sick in order that you might be a testimony that he might heal you that you can stand on his word then when you reach the opposition you can say I I know beyond the shadow of a doubt you're oh my see witness to me in Jerusalem Judea Samaria witness is somebody who's really done something been somewhere or seen something is that right now remember a witness has to be a witness a eyewitness to know what that speaking of it can't be secondary if you go down here at the courthouse and say I've seen a W on the street and you looked at it through a window glass you could not be a witness got to be right there personally you can't double see things you got to be a correct witness you understand me so you can't go by somebody else's uh testimony you got to have your own right St John 8 18-19 any questions oh it's about that time just give me a few more minutes I'm almost at the end I get carried away I get carried away all right let's just go okay so you understand that not only did Jesus have a witness Jesus was a witness of God himself this I I I work with that so that you understand you have to be a witness St John 8:1 18-19 I'm one that bear bear witness of myself and the father that send me sent me bearth witness of me you know what he mean by that I'm bearing witness of myself that means I know who I am but then the Holy Spirit Bears witness of me too amen the father in other words when I pray for you I'm bearing witness that I'm believing it but when you get healed that's the Holy Ghost bearing witness of me and of himself you understand me then said they unto him where is thy father Jesus answered ye neither know me nor my father if you had known me you should have known my father also amen hallelujah is that all right so let me give you this last quote and then I'll let you go coming from the message life story this is just the beginning of what we're doing here paragraph three I believe it is right above there but there are many of those things that that I see but I don't have time but what is it friends that doesn't mean so much the thing of it as long as there's faith will touch God they'll see themselves that is done you see so that's over see in other words you have faith in God God going to Bear witness that his word is true and he bear witness and his word is true by healing you if I speak it what I speak here confirms what I'm talking about if I speak not God's word but I have a witness and God is my witness see I'm I'm thankful to have my brothers as as a witness of the Gospel but I have a witness with my brethren and my friends and and I have the greatest witness is my heavenly father who confirms what I'm saying to be the truth and I'm so thankful for that then it is isn't that it isn't I that does the healing which you know so if you say it to the people as long as I see they got healed that's all I care for you see to see that they got the blessing so you understand we're not here to be to Bear witness of ourselves when somebody get healed no it's not like I did it and I just laid my I remember the one sister Pentecost I laid my hand on her like that and God healed her like power was the name and she say see looking at her hand ain't no healing in your hand healing is in Jesus Christ we lay hands on the sick they shall recover that's because we OB be we are obeying what he wants us to do we are obedient to the word so therefore he vindicates himself through the the through our obedience right and you know I I love this because I want you to understand a Christian must be a witness of Heaven let's stand oh I want to go to heaven not if that's the way you acting right your life has to be different they've got to see something different right if you're going to be a true witness of Jesus Christ don't be ashamed of him we're not of this world we're from a different world and listen we don't have much time it's later than what most people think everybody's not going to hear that you understand what I'm saying most people going say oh you know the Lord delayeth his coming yeah but you know what the Rapture is overdue your Prophet said that it's overdo and what is he waiting for me and you those who have not made it across that line but when that last one make it across it's over but while we're here let's work like the scripture says while it is day let let your light so shine among men let us pray F father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us we thank you for this little lesson oh Lord I Want To Be A Witness Lord no matter where I go I want my words to be seasoned with salt Lord help me oh God that my mind would think good and not evil Lord if there be anything anything that's in my life in our lives that's not proper and right before you Lord we ask oh God that you forgive us and cleanse us from all our sins help us now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen one more thing as you go one of the reasons why most people don't witness to other people is because they're ashamed of their lives they claim to be Christians but they're asham of their lives so how can you tell somebody what God can do and how you can overcome if you haven't overcome yourself and the truth of the matter is that's the trick of the devil none of us are perfect and we need to tell listen we need to tell people about Jesus no matter what how many faults you got have or whatever tell somebody you know when I get over there I don't want to be empty-handed I want to I want to I don't know what crowns I actually made of I like that but I want somebody say well you know if it had not been for the Hallelujah if it had not been for the life of brother Brooks what I saw through him I saw Jesus in you that's what I want you helped me come through that's what I want I want that kind of life that somebody can stand up and testify Lord he's been a blessing to me if it hadn't been for him you know what I'm saying let my life affect somebody in a positive way that's all I'm saying that's a witness you know a witness is not just running your mouth but a witness is the life because people going to watch you watch everything you say watch what you do that's the way people will do father God we thank you for your grace your mercy we thank you for being so good to us hallelujah father you've been better to us than we've been to ourselves thank you for this group who has been patience I try to keep it to an hour and I always run a few minutes over but I pray father God that the the few minutes were not done in vain bless us Lord as we have Departed from this place may we stay connected with you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen visit with his minist
