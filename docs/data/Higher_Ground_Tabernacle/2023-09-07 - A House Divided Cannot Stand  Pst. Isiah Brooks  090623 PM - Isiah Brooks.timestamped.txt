[44:31] void but it shall accomplish that which
[44:35] which I please amen and it shall prosper
[44:38] in the things whether to I sent it and
[44:49] only let us pray dear heavenly father
[44:53] God we come before you
[44:54] Lord thank you for your goodness thank
[44:57] you for your grace and we ask oh God
[45:01] humbly
[45:02] tonight that you would just feed our
[45:05] souls give us strength give us what we
[45:08] stand in need of take us to that next
[45:11] level oh
[45:13] God that Lord God when we when we when
[45:17] you you do return you do translate us
[45:21] Lord it be just one step Lord mer
[45:26] us Lord name Jesus
[45:30] Christ amen amen you may be
[45:33] SE a lot of things that are on my
[45:38] mind
[45:40] uh but uh I was I was
[45:44] thinking uh by way of some others who we
[45:47] we were talking
[45:50] with they were talking about the uh uh
[45:53] the Ten
[45:54] Commandments
[45:57] and I thought well you know something
[46:00] deep about
[46:02] that and it's and it's
[46:05] beyond anything that we can
[46:09] accomplish but you must
[46:11] realize these
[46:14] Commandments though they became
[46:18] law is what God
[46:21] required but no man could uh accomplish
[46:25] this
[46:27] and every time I read the
[46:29] word where Paul said he
[46:32] did he said he was blameless the LA
[46:37] blameless and to be honest with you I
[46:39] can't understand
[46:41] that because the Bible said all have
[46:45] Sinn and come short of the glory of
[46:54] God so when I think
[46:57] about Paul's
[47:00] statement I'm not sure of what he was
[47:03] speaking
[47:04] of uh because I know how I struggle
[47:07] every day and I ask for forgiveness
[47:12] every amen amen but the thing that
[47:15] really uh encourages
[47:17] me is the scripture in
[47:21] Isaiah because I recognize in the
[47:24] scripture
[47:26] it it is the it is the laws of
[47:29] God that makes a seed come to
[47:34] life the seed has no ability of
[47:39] itself but the rain that comes falls
[47:43] upon it it's like an
[47:47] anointing that brings something that is
[47:50] dead back to life and God uses this
[47:56] as a
[47:58] metaphor so that you can
[48:00] see what his
[48:02] plans this plan is for each
[48:07] individual in my
[48:10] thoughts I thought about the Bible says
[48:13] love the
[48:14] Lord all your
[48:16] heart with all your mind and with all
[48:20] your
[48:21] soul and in my
[48:23] thoughts I thought the word
[48:27] is the god of my
[48:31] soul hallelujah hallelujah my subject
[48:36] tonight would be A House Divided cannot
[48:43] stand and how many
[48:46] times have the Lord said in the
[48:49] scripture I am the Lord thy
[48:53] God and I change nothing
[48:57] so if God doesn't
[49:00] change then what makes the relationship
[49:05] change uh when I thought about it and
[49:09] considered what God did in the
[49:12] beginning the Bible said he created
[49:17] Adam and
[49:18] Adam he created man and
[49:22] woman and he called their name Adam
[49:26] they were on one
[49:28] Accord they were in
[49:31] love and their house was
[49:35] solid but a serpent
[49:38] came and divided the
[49:41] house and the house
[49:43] fell
[49:45] remember the the the thing that the
[49:48] reason that God created
[49:51] man was not only to worship
[49:56] because he had Angels
[49:58] worship he had
[50:00] cherubim sherim they were all worshiping
[50:04] him but there was something
[50:07] more I would say uh more
[50:11] beautiful in the mind of God as brother
[50:15] Bram said he was a father he a mother
[50:19] he's a sister he's a brother he's a
[50:23] husband he's a wife
[50:26] he'll be to you whatever you let him be
[50:31] hallelu but God has one
[50:34] rule one law that keeps
[50:38] Unity between him and his
[50:40] creation and that is you must love the
[50:44] Lord all heart with all of your mind
[50:48] with all of your
[50:51] might is that
[50:53] right so that you understand
[50:57] God
[50:58] knew that in his
[51:01] creation there would be a
[51:03] time that he would labor lab his
[51:09] day is that right on the seventh
[51:13] day God
[51:15] rested so with all of those days that he
[51:20] had
[51:22] working work Monday Tuesday
[51:29] but when it came to
[51:31] Saturday I'm trying to come to seventh
[51:34] day that seventh day was supposed to be
[51:38] God's
[51:39] day hallelujah hallelujah that means the
[51:42] whole entire
[51:45] day you were supposed to all
[51:50] Fellowship God and God
[51:53] Alone y understand me
[51:56] all of those
[51:58] days he gave one day because he knew you
[52:02] and I were going to be
[52:04] busy Hallelujah is that right because he
[52:07] was busy but there there was one day and
[52:11] I'm saying a lot right now because you
[52:14] don't know where I'm going with this one
[52:17] day amen amen one day for
[52:20] God and it was so
[52:23] important that God said if you work on
[52:26] this
[52:27] day working on this
[52:32] day y'all hear me so God you know you
[52:36] look at this thing and you try to figure
[52:39] out the importance of
[52:41] it see God knew all things he even knew
[52:45] this
[52:46] day men would be so
[52:49] busy will not even have
[52:52] time for his creator
[52:56] [Applause]
[52:57] be so busy somebody help me
[53:00] here right and Satan
[53:04] knew if I could divide this
[53:08] house the house will
[53:12] fall and in his
[53:15] separating Adam and Eve from each
[53:19] other he also
[53:21] separated God from Adam and Eve y'all
[53:25] hear me because it did not
[53:30] change uh the
[53:32] relationship but it changed the
[53:38] fellowship and so what when we see
[53:42] Adam take Eve unto
[53:45] wife that was
[53:49] profound he
[53:52] literally gave up everything
[53:56] that he knew
[53:59] understood Hallelujah because remember
[54:02] the Bible said Adam was not
[54:08] deceived it wasn't as if he didn't
[54:11] understand what he was giving
[54:14] up but he was
[54:18] expressing of
[54:20] God the kind of love that God would have
[54:24] for his
[54:27] we could see that he was willing to
[54:32] stay in order to save
[54:35] her hallelujah hallelujah right cuz she
[54:40] she was
[54:41] deceive So Adam became her
[54:45] sin right and so therefore God couldn't
[54:49] kill
[54:51] Eve because of what Adam
[54:54] did somebody help me this is how it was
[54:57] and is with Jesus
[54:59] Christ God could not kill
[55:02] us because of what Jesus Christ
[55:06] did he became my sin he became your sin
[55:12] hallelujah hallelujah that we might
[55:13] become his
[55:15] righteous hallelujah hallelujah see wond
[55:18] this is important with
[55:22] God and believe you me Oneness is
[55:25] important with the devil
[55:29] too see when God comes along and the
[55:33] Bible describes it in go in
[55:36] Genesis that the the voice of God
[55:40] walks the
[55:43] evening crying out Adam Adam where
[55:48] thou hallelujah hallelujah now Adam was
[55:50] in a place he had never been
[55:54] before though he was in
[55:57] Eden spiritually he was no longer in
[56:00] Eden because the Bible say the day you
[56:03] eat of this tree you surely
[56:07] die understand me so for the first time
[56:11] Adam is feeling a
[56:14] separation hallah from God his
[56:17] creator hallelujah hallelujah this is
[56:20] why even Jesus said my God my God Thou
[56:25] forsaken me Hallelujah huj like the
[56:28] first Adam felt the separation from
[56:32] Godus Christ the second ad the
[56:35] separation God hallelujah it had to have
[56:39] been a horrible
[56:42] thing hey but he
[56:45] knew Jesus Knew by shedding his blood he
[56:50] was going to bind up that
[56:53] brid
[56:56] once again will be able to fellowship
[56:59] with God hallelujah that was part of his
[57:04] service amen he said in that day you
[57:09] know that I'm in the father father in me
[57:13] and I am in
[57:15] you hallelujah hallelujah thank God for
[57:20] Jesus hallelujah hallelujah oh my God
[57:24] when you really see the Liberty that you
[57:29] have think about it this is what I
[57:32] believe Grieves the Holy
[57:35] Ghost his
[57:36] subjects uh that he died
[57:39] for
[57:41] opportunity fellowship with him not just
[57:45] one day but every day hallelujah
[57:49] hallelujah it must grieve him when we
[57:53] find time
[57:56] but
[58:00] him A House
[58:03] Divided can't
[58:05] stand God needs unity in his
[58:09] house hallelujah hallelujah is that
[58:12] right but in order for the unity to
[58:16] return back to the to the house of
[58:19] God the word of
[58:21] God must be the god
[58:25] of our
[58:27] soul you understand me cuz the Bible
[58:31] says that the soul that
[58:33] sin shall surely
[58:36] die hallelujah hallelujah and in order
[58:39] for us not to
[58:41] sin there must be an
[58:46] atonement because we were born
[58:49] Sinners God has to bring a
[58:52] change the Holy Ghost didn't come
[58:56] feel
[58:59] good to make us shout and
[59:02] dance hallelujah hallelujah it it didn't
[59:05] listen the Bible says it didn't even
[59:07] come to make you do
[59:10] Miracles because the Bible says you can
[59:13] do all of these things and you have not
[59:17] charity if you don't have the love of
[59:19] God in your
[59:21] soul it profits you nothing
[59:27] are we making
[59:29] sense you think about it illustration
[59:32] after the
[59:35] illustration you take the house of
[59:37] Jacob and he had two wives Rachel and
[59:41] Leo constant
[59:45] confusion hallelujah hallelujah while
[59:47] the house was
[59:49] divided you take Abraham and
[59:52] Sarah they were okay until Jacob and Es
[59:57] born Hallelujah and let me tell you this
[1:00:01] when you get
[1:00:03] saved only the beginning of the
[1:00:07] battle saying now you got as the prophet
[1:00:10] of God says you got a white dog and a
[1:00:13] black
[1:00:14] dog fighting each
[1:00:17] other by the parable We Know by the
[1:00:22] parable you feed the
[1:00:26] the one that
[1:00:27] will hallelujah hallelujah but I'm I am
[1:00:32] convinced instead of fighting with the
[1:00:35] dog excuse me kill
[1:00:42] him kill the old
[1:00:44] nature let the Holy Spirit kill the old
[1:00:48] nature Hallelujah there's a reason why
[1:00:53] oh I'm jumping I'm jumping let me slow
[1:00:55] down a little bit I'm getting too
[1:00:58] excited I'm enjoying
[1:01:00] myself you know what I'm

[1:01:26] to turn it up a little bit it's okay
[1:01:29] it's
[1:01:32] okay I'm okay cuz I'm I'm I'm where the
[1:01:35] heat is just
[1:01:38] that James

[1:01:49] man and endure with knowledge among you
[1:01:54] let him show out of a good conversation
[1:01:56] his work with meekness of
[1:02:02] wisdom but if you have bitter envying
[1:02:05] and strife in your
[1:02:09] heart Glory not and lie not against the
[1:02:16] truth this wisdom descendeth not from
[1:02:20] above but it's Earthly ual and
[1:02:26] for where envy and strife
[1:02:29] is there is
[1:02:32] confusion and every evil
[1:02:35] work hallelujah how many believe
[1:02:38] that but the wisdom that is from
[1:02:42] above is first
[1:02:44] pure then
[1:02:47] peaceful and easy to be
[1:02:50] [Music]
[1:02:51] inrig full of Mercy good fruit FRS
[1:02:55] without
[1:02:58] partiality
[1:03:00] hypocrisy let me show you something when
[1:03:04] we see and look into the
[1:03:07] scripture according to uh uh uh the
[1:03:11] birth of Cain and
[1:03:13] Abel was trying to tell us
[1:03:17] something hallelujah hallelujah here was
[1:03:20] one with the nature of
[1:03:23] God
[1:03:24] but there was another with the nature of
[1:03:26] the devil hallelujah hallelujah and look
[1:03:30] what
[1:03:32] happened it happened in
[1:03:34] church it happened at the
[1:03:37] altar hallelujah hallelujah where Cain
[1:03:40] [Applause]
[1:03:41] slew because he was
[1:03:44] jealous of his blood
[1:03:47] sacrifice he jealous of the
[1:03:51] fellowship he had with God Hallelujah
[1:03:55] because the Bible says that Abel's
[1:03:58] Fellowship Abel's
[1:04:03] sacrifice so I'm bringing it to the
[1:04:06] church when your
[1:04:08] sacrifice when under the
[1:04:11] blood when you know that you're serving
[1:04:14] God when you are talking to God and God
[1:04:18] is talking to you don't think that the
[1:04:21] spirit of Cain is not watching
[1:04:26] you is that all right you should wait
[1:04:29] wait a minute but let me show you what
[1:04:32] Jesus did with
[1:04:34] that hallelujah hallelujah he never
[1:04:37] thought
[1:04:40] back
[1:04:42] Hallelujah and one of the things I look
[1:04:45] at it doesn't
[1:04:47] say but we always
[1:04:52] Envision coming up behind
[1:04:55] Abel and killing him
[1:04:58] unawares but that's not the way it was
[1:05:01] with
[1:05:03] J hallelujah hallelujah they didn't come
[1:05:06] behind his
[1:05:08] back it was face to
[1:05:10] face hallelujah hallelujah and guess
[1:05:14] what he was able to love his
[1:05:19] eny and why the Bible says during his
[1:05:23] cruci
[1:05:25] he would be led like a lamb to the
[1:05:30] [Music]
[1:05:32] slaughter he wouldn't open his
[1:05:35] mouth in other words he wouldn't fight
[1:05:39] back somebody he even
[1:05:43] told Peter if you fight with the sword
[1:05:46] you die with the
[1:05:48] sword you have been called to be a
[1:05:53] lamb the lamb Hallelujah Jesus is the
[1:05:58] Lamb of God hallelujah you don't fight
[1:06:01] your
[1:06:03] enemy
[1:06:05] en
[1:06:08] amen
[1:06:10] amen hallelujah hallelujah he's got it
[1:06:13] all through the
[1:06:16] word hallelujah you know you you you
[1:06:19] think about Jacob and
[1:06:23] Esau Jacob could have stood there and
[1:06:25] fight to to fight Jacob could have stood
[1:06:28] there to fight
[1:06:30] Esau there to
[1:06:32] fight but he
[1:06:34] ran Hallelujah understand he knew he had
[1:06:38] the
[1:06:39] blessing there was no way that Esau
[1:06:42] could really kill
[1:06:44] him because God had already pronounced a
[1:06:49] blessing while he was in the
[1:06:52] womb Jacob love
[1:06:58] I just to know the
[1:07:01] word weapon formed against
[1:07:04] me weapon formed against
[1:07:07] you Pros hallelujah hallelujah why
[1:07:11] because the word has
[1:07:15] spoken you were
[1:07:18] blessed before you were
[1:07:20] born you were blessed in the
[1:07:22] womb
[1:07:24] hallelujah hallelujah and if you should
[1:07:26] die you be blessed in the Tomb
[1:07:30] hallelujah hallelujah nothing can stop
[1:07:33] you from reaching your
[1:07:37] goal did I not read
[1:07:39] that that's what Isaiah said God going
[1:07:43] to water you God will water
[1:07:47] you you he will make sure that seed in
[1:07:52] you come to maturity
[1:07:54] he will make sure Hallelujah when the
[1:07:58] Rapture take place you will be Rapture
[1:08:01] Ready hallu it's not by power it's not
[1:08:06] by might by the holy spirit it's God
[1:08:11] Alone God
[1:08:14] Alone hallelujah hallelujah glory to
[1:08:19] God you need
[1:08:21] patience you patience
[1:08:24] hallelujah hallelujah you need God to
[1:08:26] bring you to a place where you can buide
[1:08:30] your God will do that but he said you
[1:08:34] have not you have
[1:08:36] not hey somebody see you can't just ask
[1:08:41] ask
[1:08:44] God and you're not in in in
[1:08:49] sincerity God knows the
[1:08:52] heart y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:08:54] whenever you approach God you got to be
[1:08:58] as sincere as you possibly can because
[1:09:01] he
[1:09:02] knows and if you are
[1:09:05] sincere God will answer your prayer it
[1:09:08] doesn't matter who you
[1:09:12] are I didn't know I was going to be
[1:09:14] preaching
[1:09:16] this it's just the way God
[1:09:19] turn hallelujah hallelujah is that all
[1:09:21] right second Timothy 4
[1:09:26] 18 how many of y'all understand Grace
[1:09:28] better
[1:09:30] now how many of y'all understand the
[1:09:32] election
[1:09:33] better I preached on a few services that
[1:09:36] you should understand it
[1:09:39] betterall you didn't choose God God
[1:09:41] chose
[1:09:42] you hallelujah hallelujah and I don't
[1:09:45] care how the devil accus
[1:09:47] you of being so
[1:09:49] bad hallelujah hallelujah the Bible said
[1:09:52] we all sin come short of the glory of
[1:09:57] God nobody in here is better than the
[1:10:03] other but when you understand God loved
[1:10:06] me and if God loved me I need to learn
[1:10:10] how to love
[1:10:13] me most people have problems because
[1:10:17] they don't love
[1:10:18] themselves hallelujah hallelujah but in
[1:10:20] order for someone else to love you
[1:10:24] love
[1:10:25] you God created you and God created you
[1:10:30] the way you
[1:10:32] are for his
[1:10:35] glory we don't know how he going to how
[1:10:38] he's going to do
[1:10:39] it but we
[1:10:41] know we will be glorified
[1:10:45] with hallelujah hallelujah second
[1:10:48] Timothy
[1:10:52] 4:18
[1:10:56] you love the
[1:10:58] Lord and the Lord shall deliver
[1:11:02] me from every evil
[1:11:07] work and will
[1:11:10] preserve
[1:11:11] me unto his Heavenly
[1:11:14] Kingdom so when the devil come at you
[1:11:17] and tell you you're not going to make it
[1:11:19] take your sword
[1:11:22] out
[1:11:24] Timothy let the devil
[1:11:27] know when God spoke
[1:11:30] that that was being
[1:11:33] written he had me in his
[1:11:38] mind hallelujah hallelujah and will
[1:11:41] preserve me unto his Heavenly
[1:11:45] Kingdom to the
[1:11:47] glory forever and
[1:11:50] ever amen amen
[1:11:54] that is so good to
[1:11:56] me fellowship with God through
[1:12:01] reconciliation 1956
[1:12:05] 120 paragraph
[1:12:07] 21 so when we find
[1:12:10] out that man must come back to his
[1:12:15] maker then when Adam
[1:12:17] realized sin has separated
[1:12:20] him he became an alien
[1:12:24] a
[1:12:26] wonderer away from God without hope
[1:12:31] wondering around the
[1:12:33] garden knowing that he was separated
[1:12:36] from
[1:12:37] God let me tell you something you know
[1:12:39] when you're separated from God

[1:13:50] Wanderer and the man and man to this
[1:13:56] day when the sin
[1:13:59] problem he still becomes a
[1:14:03] Wanderer he will go to One Church a

[1:15:13] said I'll never leave nor will I forsake
[1:15:17] I will always be there for you that's
[1:15:20] exactly what he means that's what he

[1:15:39] out that's not going to happen why I'm
[1:15:43] not
[1:15:46] through hallelujah hallelujah the
[1:15:50] power behind the promise

[1:16:03] withers the flowers fade
[1:16:06] away but the word of the Lord

[1:16:27] verse and I'm trying I want to get into

[1:16:38] with
[1:16:40] something outside of spending that time
[1:16:42] with
[1:16:43] God it becomes an
[1:16:50] idol most of us
[1:16:53] ought to be glad that we don't have to
[1:16:55] perform the Sabbath
[1:17:03] day because in this day wouldn't be we
[1:17:05] wouldn't be able to do
[1:17:08] it we got cell

[1:17:51] it like you you're in a you in a you in
[1:17:54] a position of
[1:17:57] worship and we see all
[1:17:59] that instead of wondering about God
[1:18:06] like we look at the
[1:18:13] television I don't mean to be
[1:18:16] funny the truth of the matter is if
[1:18:19] you're not
[1:18:21] careful
[1:18:24] now I know people who are
[1:18:27] addicts they got to watch that
[1:18:30] television I know know people who are
[1:18:33] addicts to the cell
[1:18:36] phone Hallelujah try to take a teenager
[1:18:39] cell
[1:18:41] phone and you GNA see some
[1:18:47] demons they don't even know they're
[1:18:51] possessed and they really think that
[1:18:53] that's their attitude no no no
[1:18:55] that's you got something in
[1:18:58] you that's pulling for

[1:19:14] habit especially if it's a bad
[1:19:16] habit Hallelujah now let me move
[1:19:20] on reading from the eth verse
[1:19:24] that is they which are the children of
[1:19:27] the
[1:19:28] flesh these are not the children of
[1:19:31] God but the children of the
[1:19:36] promise for the
[1:19:39] seed y'all understand what I'm
[1:19:41] saying it was Jacob who had the
[1:19:45] promise but Esau was a better
[1:19:48] character hallelujah hallelujah he did
[1:19:51] everything daddy told him to do
[1:19:54] he was a better
[1:19:57] son but Jacob was a
[1:20:00] shy he was a
[1:20:02] de hallelujah hallelujah but he had the
[1:20:07] promise Hallelujah see is not by power
[1:20:11] it's not by
[1:20:13] might by the spirit of the
[1:20:17] Lord you've got to believe that you are
[1:20:20] a son or daughter by promise and if you
[1:20:25] are Son and Daughter by promise promise
[1:20:29] nothing in
[1:20:30] Hell stop the

[1:20:35] nothing in this earth nothing in the
[1:20:38] United States nothing

[1:20:58] can stop the word of
[1:21:01] God you might have to
[1:21:04] suffer you might have to go through
[1:21:07] things but at the end of the
[1:21:10] day you'll be right there in the kingdom

[1:29:29] mercy whom I have
[1:29:34] mercy and I will have

[1:30:02] says what can wash me Wier than snow
[1:30:07] nothing but the blood of
[1:30:10] Jesus that's why I remain a
[1:30:13] Christian because I know I am a faulty
[1:30:16] being Within
[1:30:18] Myself I need the blood of the
[1:30:20] Lamb the life of God I need the Holy
[1:30:25] Ghost to live it because I realize I
[1:30:28] can't live it on my
[1:30:29] own hallelujah hallu thank you
[1:30:34] Jesus Matthew
[1:30:37] 12 hallelujah hallelujah you and I must
[1:30:41] understand we're living in the day where
[1:30:44] all these Earthly
[1:30:46] things must give
[1:30:48] away to the Eternal things
[1:30:52] is that right we can see it everything's
[1:30:56] falling
[1:30:57] apart men are so
[1:31:01] insane now they don't have no
[1:31:04] love not even for their
[1:31:06] own huah oh you think people look at
[1:31:09] children oh you're so cute you know now
[1:31:13] people don't even have the affection for
[1:31:16] children hallelujah it's just what it is
[1:31:20] the reason being
[1:31:23] they broke the law of
[1:31:28] God love the Lord thy God with all your
[1:31:32] mind with all your heart the whole
[1:31:36] world
[1:31:38] suffering we broke the law
[1:31:43] of I'm telling you am you look at a
[1:31:47] family that really loves each
[1:31:50] other they will stay
[1:31:53] together but when you let
[1:31:56] stuff get in
[1:31:59] between like Adam and Eve this is what I
[1:32:02] love Adam for he loved his wife and he
[1:32:07] refused to let the devil
[1:32:10] keep he sacrificed
[1:32:13] himself that's what Jesus did for us
[1:32:16] Hall we were dead in sin TR we were
[1:32:22] worthy of
[1:32:23] death my lord your Lord hallelujah Ste
[1:32:28] in took our sins upon him to do what
[1:32:33] save
[1:32:34] us and do you think he's going to go
[1:32:37] through all of that and let the devil
[1:32:40] take you he's not going to do it it's
[1:32:44] impossible for him cuz Jesus said I've
[1:32:47] never lost
[1:32:49] one hallelujah hallelujah the devil is a
[1:32:54] liar Jesus knew their
[1:32:57] thoughts and said unto them every
[1:33:00] Kingdom divided against
[1:33:03] itself brought to
[1:33:05] Desolation and every city or house
[1:33:08] divided
[1:33:09] against shall not
[1:33:12] stay so the point is when he can
[1:33:14] get husband and wife fussing and caring
[1:33:18] on he knows got he's got him defeated
[1:33:24] and when he can get uh church
[1:33:27] people fighting each
[1:33:29] other he know the church is right up for
[1:33:32] a
[1:33:34] split y hear I'm saying dividing the
[1:33:37] church by
[1:33:41] gossip you know just talking too
[1:33:44] much knows that he has the church
[1:33:47] members under
[1:33:50] control is to divide
[1:33:54] and Hallelujah that's why the Bible
[1:33:58] loves one
[1:34:02] Accord hallelujah hallelujah that's
[1:34:05] right we're not supposed to go to
[1:34:09] bed or
[1:34:10] sleep if we know we got things that must
[1:34:13] need to
[1:34:15] be hallelujah
[1:34:18] hallelujah hey the Bible says 26 verse
[1:34:22] if Satan cast out Satan he is divided
[1:34:26] against
[1:34:27] himself how how shall then his
[1:34:32] King and that's what people think oh we
[1:34:35] can have all this
[1:34:36] confusion when I'm talking about this
[1:34:38] I've got I've got a lot of people in my
[1:34:41] mind because Satan is hitting
[1:34:44] everywhere it ain't just in your lives
[1:34:46] it's
[1:34:47] everywhere and if he can get you off uh
[1:34:50] uh uh divide your
[1:34:52] house he's going to do it because he
[1:34:54] knows if he can divide your
[1:34:56] house bring that division in
[1:34:59] church eventually those spirits will
[1:35:03] start Conquering the
[1:35:05] church y'all hear what I'm
[1:35:08] saying this is why you should never
[1:35:11] gossip and if somebody has a problem
[1:35:13] with
[1:35:14] someone you supposed to do like the
[1:35:16] Bible say go to that person
[1:35:20] and and at end of the day you got to
[1:35:23] love that
[1:35:25] person
[1:35:27] yeah you're not fighting flesh and
[1:35:30] blood
[1:35:32] on and I believe we're the Bride of
[1:35:34] Jesus Christ Satan know that if he can
[1:35:37] throw
[1:35:40] things we're going to displease
[1:35:43] God you know
[1:35:45] why because the word is not your
[1:35:50] God that is that right the Bible said if
[1:35:53] you love me keep my command if you don't
[1:35:57] love if you don't love God you don't
[1:36:00] keep y hear what I'm saying it sound
[1:36:02] like
[1:36:06] legalistic but the word must become your
[1:36:11] God put it this way it must become your
[1:36:14] head
[1:36:17] Shi if Eve had only gone to
[1:36:20] Adam
[1:36:22] and say
[1:36:23] Adam this Beast over
[1:36:26] here is flirting with
[1:36:29] me y'all hear what I'm saying the whole
[1:36:32] story would have been
[1:36:34] different Hallelujah let me tell you
[1:36:36] something when the devil come at you
[1:36:39] supposed to call on the name of
[1:36:41] Jesus that's your head sh that's your
[1:36:45] lord your God the Bible even said he's
[1:36:48] our
[1:36:50] husband Amen Let Him straighten it
[1:36:54] out
[1:36:56] right
[1:36:58] listen and if Satan cast out
[1:37:01] Satan he is divided against
[1:37:05] himself how shall then his kingdom
[1:37:08] stay Hallelujah and if I be be
[1:37:14] above by who do your children cast them
[1:37:19] out therefore they shall be your
[1:37:23] judges see because even in
[1:37:27] Israel people were being
[1:37:29] healed people were being healed before
[1:37:32] Jesus
[1:37:34] came because the Bible said I send my
[1:37:38] word word
[1:37:41] healed hallelujah hallelujah so there
[1:37:43] were those able to step into the pool of
[1:37:49] Shalom and that was going on before
[1:37:51] Jesus
[1:37:52] came but the angel would come down and
[1:37:55] Trouble the
[1:37:57] water and so Jesus is saying if I'm the
[1:38:01] devil then how are these other people
[1:38:03] being
[1:38:05] healed so if I cast out Devils by the
[1:38:08] spirit of
[1:38:11] God then the kingdom of God is come unto
[1:38:15] you hallelujah hallelujah you love the
[1:38:20] Lord

[1:38:31] uh uh scriptural true
[1:38:36] wor
[1:38:38] scri uh John 4:24 and I'm
[1:38:43] I'm because I want you to
[1:38:46] understand though we don't have big
[1:38:48] statues
[1:38:50] outside that we're bowing
[1:38:54] to this world is the most idolatrous
[1:38:57] world uh uh uh how can I say it in in
[1:39:01] this age people are more
[1:39:05] idolators than ever
[1:39:08] before far
[1:39:10] worse and the devil was so
[1:39:13] smart he took away
[1:39:16] statues but he he gave us other
[1:39:19] things y understand
[1:39:22] now if you study you find out
[1:39:25] Israel before one of the
[1:39:29] reasons they fa to ID
[1:39:33] worshiping because they didn't have
[1:39:35] pleasure like we've got
[1:39:37] now hallelujah hallelujah they didn't
[1:39:40] have amusement
[1:39:42] parks Park Amusement you know what I'm
[1:39:44] saying they didn't have all that stuff
[1:39:48] but among the
[1:39:50] heathens
[1:39:51] the heathens were
[1:39:56] wasteful
[1:39:59] wasteful
[1:40:01] Hallelujah and so when they worshiped
[1:40:04] their
[1:40:05] God they had a lot of music a lot of
[1:40:09] dancing they had
[1:40:12] contest all that Israel was
[1:40:19] boring they were boring because they
[1:40:22] lost the love for the
[1:40:26] word it became
[1:40:30] tradition and whenever this message
[1:40:32] become
[1:40:33] tradition Satan is going to give you
[1:40:37] something y'all hear what I'm saying
