you tonight God is good to us I'm just gonna get right into the Word of God as you would turn with me James 1:17 we have our brother Jack Duff coming this weekend don't forget by God's grace we have service here it's at six o'clock on Saturday and then four o'clock on Sunday evening Sunday morning he'll be ministering down in Iowa City okay okay let us read the scripture James 1:17 please every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning Hebrew 11 please we are still working with somewhat with in my father's house we realized by God's grace that it's just to me inexhaustible they're just so much that we can say and we could look into when it comes to the Word of God Hebrews 11 1 2 3 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear let us pray father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us we pray father God that your blessings will be upon the people tonight forgive us of our sins and our shortcomings anything we may have said or done that haven't been pleasing into your sight Lord continue to bless your church Lord give us grace to continue to grow into your image father we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated as we could say it's been a series preparing for the new world you and I understand by God's grace that there are or there is how we want to say it two worlds and we know by God's grace that these worlds are different the ones that we have been speaking of one world is above and the other world is beneath and we understand by God's grace that when it came to this world this world came into a fallen state by way of Adam and Eve and if we express before Adam never did complete the will of God replenished the earth but it was in the image of Adam and not in the image of God and all men are created in the image of the fallen Adam but then yet God word cannot come back void so God made a way and of course this is where Jesus comes in because the fall first Adam calls us to fall and the second Adam redeemed us from the fall and you and I realized by God's grace that when Jesus came he constantly told us that he was not of this world and that well he was from a different place he also instructed his disciples and he told them that when I said like brother varlyn said he he preached his own funeral when it came to Saint John 14 he said let not your heart be troubled is that right if you believe in God believe also in me I go away to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also so he told us by God's grace even in his message that there would be a place that he will be would be preparing for us so we understand by God's grace this is why it gives us understanding why the first world was destroyed because we understand that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they multiplied so much so the Bible tells our thinking Genesis 6 chapter that the world multiplied in such a way and violence was everywhere and men saw women and you know how that goes and and we know now that that state has repeated itself and so God destroyed that world Enoch was the only one perfect man that literally escaped the judgment of God nor a man being a righteous seed was the only one that escaped by way of the tribulation and you and I understand by God's grace that that was by water God destroyed it that was the stage of justification we know that and then God sanctified the earth through the blood of Jesus Christ but even in sanctification by blood they're their steer had to be a sanctification by fire because fire is the greatest purifier it burns everything away even in the future home brother Branham said that fire amen the earth going through a fire baptism is it a light figure of the man the human being that needs to go through that fire baptism that will burn all the demons away so you and I know that Jesus Christ when he comes the Bible tells us when he comes and raptures us a way that we will be caught up to meet him in the air so I told you by God's grace in the last few messages that how Adam did not complete so when God's seed would would die a fall asleep God had already prepared a place for them those who are Christ is that right resurrected at the crucifixion of Jesus Christ because they believed on him that was to come they did the sacrifice of the Lamb they trusted that and by faith they became victors through Jesus Christ victory on Calvary now we understand that Jesus according to the prophet God said that when when Lucifer or the devil offered up Jesus said listen during that time of his fasting I give you all of this and when he when he when he told oh Jesus I'll give you all he had a right you know because he won that battle and Adam forfeited the world and Satan or Lucifer he owned it per se right so when he offered this to Jesus he refused it because he knew eventually it was going to be here come on somebody now you and I know the new world is another world it cannot be like this this world is what we would call the negative it is the shadow of the real thing and you and I must understand that in this shadow you got death sickness pain age time becomes a ruler over the mortal man but in the world to come time is done away with we come to a place where it is eternity and and in listen ass we had to be prepared is that right the Prophet God said our coming here was prepared God didn't just send you here by mistake that's why I read that scripture every good and perfect gift comes from the Lord hallelujah and so you and I must understand that because we have gifts amen doesn't mean we become Christians but every good and perfect gifts come from God and so you and I know that these gifts come to us without repentance the gift and calling of God hallelujah so you and I know that what God is doing and and that's what the devil didn't understand she even the psalmist said that Jesus Christ would die and they said but who would declare his generation he said I'm saying in other words there would come a generation that would be will declare the seed of God because the first Adam was earthly and the second Adam is the quickening spirit who is a lord of heaven the understanding so this is why Jesus said unto Nicodemus in order to go over yonder you must be born again because that which is fresh is a flesh but that which is of spirit in spirit hallelujah and remember even Jesus said be ye perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect but there is nothing in this world that is perfect somebody help me here so you and I must understand there are worlds there are worlds and more than just two but there are worlds and these worlds are dimensional hallelujah is that right because heaven and earth is basically in the same place but of a different dimension somebody help me here is that the truth that is so true it's not a million miles away hallelujah the Bible said don't say God is up in heaven don't say God is far away the Bible said that God is near thee even in you even in your mouth so we're dealing with people and this is what we are supposed to understand faith if I've said is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so faith is able to call those things let me say it like this Einstein discovered a lot of things by way of science Newton discovered laws of gravity motions for every action there's an opposite but equal reaction and highest Stein discovered what we call the quantum theory because they thought that light was some like ways but in their discovery they found out that light was not just in waves but little particles of energy that's able to move it's able to change things for example I can look at something and because of the light reflection it might be read to me but where you standing it could be a different color and that's what they call relativity but the point I'm trying to make is Jesus already told us about it it's already in the word Jesus said tell me Pharisees you're so smart how can the Son of Man be standing here on earth and in heaven at the same time hallelujah brother brown this is in the theory of relativity you can't you can't go you can go but so far but you can't go back to where you started because time and space changes that right for instance whatever time it is now 10 minutes I say 10 minutes to 8:00 if I moved this way right I come up to another time what about trying to go back to the time in which I started is in power possible because that time has now become my pass hallelujah but with God all things are possible hallelujah God will art God for you and me will always defy his old laws is that right but what there's a law about gravity if you throw something up gravity is going to put it down but then God defies his own law with you and me by just raising your hand you just defied gravity hallelujah and you must understand that God even defies his law when it comes to relativity he's the creator and God does what he wants to do hallelujah why space why astronauts are trying their best amen tu tu tu tu ah vindicate time travel we know time travel come on somebody because you and I must understand it meant that time travel has always been it's not something that God created is that right God in His Word prophesied that Jesus who was in eternity was going to come down and be a son of a virgin hallelujah and gods were prophesied he would die and he would raise again and go back up hallelujah come on somebody and you got to understand but he was the only one that can go back in time is that right oh come on somebody you said well how could he be here and there at the same time you've got a positive and a negative let me read what the prophet of God says is this okay so you can understand he says what you are here is what is a reflection of what you are somewhere hallelujah you can't be reflecting excuse me for sailing like this you can't be reflecting hell and be in heavenly places you understand me so you got to understand that these two lines these two things exist on the plane whatever you're doing here you're doing there you say well what do you mean brother Brooks you see my shadow if I had a shower and you could see it whatever I'm doing my shadow is doing it at the same time hallelujah so you and I must understand Amen that the work is right let me go home with this now so you can understand amen here we had a time traveler in our own in our day Paul was a time traveler hallelujah he said I went into the heavens and I saw things that were unlawful to tell and then he came back down to earth hallelujah brother Brad was a time traveler he God lifted him up and he says I went behind the curtain up high and I saw you there I wasn't even born yet but I was there in stir - he said I saw you there somebody help me here so you can understand that God defies his own laws for you how can you not believe in the rapture oh come on somebody you and I know that God is the only one they can bring something good out of something that is bad now let me move on by God's grace because I want you to understand Amen here uh-huh-huh-huh let me say so he said let me just read this finish reading he said those who he justified he he has glorified wait a minute now he justified me and he's already glorified me but I'm still moving toward glorification hallelujah amen so let me say it like this too so you and I can understand that this is not a mistake it was pre-planned everything about you is pre playing hallelujah it doesn't take the equation of repentance away hallelujah it doesn't take the equation of confessing away but God knew you would confess God knew you would repent you know I didn't understand it just just a week or so ago I had an experience with the Lord and God took me in a in my own mind how he want to say it back to some decisions I made in life and he showed me the decisions that I made was the decisions that determine the path I made but I walked rather but I couldn't I had the opportunity to decide something different but I didn't do it maybe because of fear maybe because of pride whatever it was I didn't I didn't make those choices but guarding you that the choices I made he was going to work it toward my good cheek to me it could have been a bad choice but with God your choice because you are predestinated it's not bad you said what explain that to me God had already prepared a fish for Jonah because God knew Jonah's decision hallelujah somebody help me here all things work together for the good of them that love God God will always bring in our we're on the journey is that okay time travel now I'm just saying space and time because God defies gravity for you and I gravity holds you would tell me how was he how was Phillip at a meeting and then God transports him hallelujah teleported they're trying to find all of these things and it's all that they're looking for is right in here every answers in the book this is your this is my birth certificate written this is your birth certificate written hallelujah and if we can see that this thing we says I go to prepare a place for you you heard me say this before before those twelve apostles knew the head Thrones God had them there already hallelujah and before you and I knew we had mansions we didn't know it we didn't even know what the mansions were we thought there was no castles or little houses and everything else brother Brown said those mansions are your bodies your new bodies in my kit is that right because when he went beyond the curtain of time he didn't see houses he saw human beings he said where are their houses yeah but that's not what God was talking about when he says I go to prepare a place for you that's what the prophecy seek God has a glorified body he has a body that's made just for you hallelujah he said what do you mean brother Brooks this is not the real you the real you is on the inside you lived in this house this house is getting old leaking right like that song say I need a new building this one is falling apart but over there there's a house there's a body whose builder and maker is God what were you saying that's why it's so important that you feeling a pool you understand me all of us are battling Satan hey man hell and earth is blending hallelujah and we're feeling the effects of it but at the same time no darkness gonna keep a true child of God in bondage help us Lord so that will understand I read it like the Prophet says he said there's a channel like this and that's where mortal lives in here he said in the conglomeration of gaiety and blackness and sin and every once in a while you will see a little white spot or a light so in this you are reflecting light in a dark world and it's only a few of us in all of this only a few of us are reflecting the light of God this is why he said ye are the light of the world I don't see no light you don't see the cosmic light in you either but brother Branham said when the Holy Ghost comes in you it go away with the cosmic light and he reflects the eternal light which is God Himself out of you that's why amen this copies light can't keep us from dying not that every seven years you lose something hallelujah but with the light of God you never lose cause he said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you which world are you from where are you going what's pulling you because right now you either feeling a pull downward or you're feeling a pull upward hallelujah you understand me and if you don't resist the put down multiple that's where you're going hallelujah but the thing that gets me is when Jesus declared he says I have no darkness in me Oh every time I think about that I think about myself if I am in Christ he has no darkness if you are in Christ you can't be darkness and light at the same time he's somebody help me here so what are you saying you and I have a job in this dispensation you and I have a job that is to reflect Jesus Christ and him only and that doesn't come by way of knowledge it comes by way of birth hallelujah you've got to be born again hallelujah is all I got the Holy Ghost daddy'd enough that Holy Ghost in you must mature you and I must come into the statue of a perfect mate that does not be the see be perfect for which my father in heaven is perfect everything that goes in the city must be perfect like I said the character of Christ is the only thing that opens the portal right the character of Christ people that oh I'm going I'm gonna just go I'm elected I'm chosen of God let me tell you one thing not one demon went into that city nothing that will defile it hello so if you packin bhima's the best thing to do is to get rid of it is that right that's my brother branham said he said if you don't get rid of the demon that demon is there to destroy you he said destroyed the demon before the demon destroy you right because we remember I told you by the spoken word everything was created I don't know how he did it but I used that word you need verse one verse did it in the beginning God created the heavens in the earth bang hallelujah so you and I must understand by that one god created everything everything you were there I was there before he even saying let us make man we were already there whoa because when he said let us make man that was the beginning of something but inside of him the thought y'all understand me the attributes of him in us we were there that's the scripture the scripture said before the foundation of the world I was there when he said this is I was there when he formed the mountains I was there well why were we we were in him hallelujah before the foundation of the world as I said and I'm not going to be long tonight because it's just segments but I want to say this whatever we reflect here is what we're if reflecting right you can't reflect evil and be in heaven wherever your spirit is is where you what you're going to reflect hallelujah and you and I must understand you say what Brotherhood's how would I ever become holy he made it simple and easy let me say it like this he said Peter upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it I give you the key keys to the kingdom now if Peter was given the keys we think Oh Peter just had uh uh repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's just the beginning because he had the keys what keys the keys that will unlock the divine nature in you hallelujah that will unlock the divine nature in you and here's a prophet of God said listen the Bible said God made a way of entrance interested to what the kingdom of God hallelujah and we must understand that these virtues is effective at the very divine nature of God these virtues is the very power that got Jesus up out of the grave hallelujah it was the same nature when he said to Mary Martha he said listen he said if you believe you should see I am the resurrection somebody help me here so in order for us to be resurrected we need him only inside of us sometimes these are all the portion of the resurrection is in the bride that's what he said but the voice of the resurrection is not the thing it's a person hallelujah is that right the voice of God walked in the cool of the day then the voice of God identified himself at the grave of Lazarus oh come on somebody is that right so the voice of God is saying listen in order for the resurrection of being you my person must be in you it ain't you some people think oh I - go down to the baby sighs ray huh it'll be Jesus because the bride will not even move until you get a dust say at the Lord it will be the bride Christ in Bride form is that right God in-law say changing his mask that's why I was looking at that quantum theory there's got to be something in the natural that would type us out hallelujah and is those particles of light amen is that right everything is unified hallelujah and they say in those in that theory it seems like those little particles of life has a mind of their own hallelujah ha because in the experiment they knew how they didn't try to penetrate the wood they went between the wood and after they came between the wood guess what folks they gathered back together somebody help me here oh one of these old days will break that veil we'll go behind the veil and there's gonna be a great gathering hallelujah but the light of God once again nothing can't stop it let's go stop it they say these Quantum's they said it's the whole universe everything moves by it hallelujah they don't know that did you know that when you see the Sun that's yesterday the light you seeing is old hallelujah that's why you can see eternity I can see in the past and then the same light shows me the future and I'm in the middle you're right here hallelujah come on somebody no matter what not know nothing can nothing of man can put the Sun out and no matter how we see light we see it equally yes if you've got good eyesight and you gotta understand by God's grace Amen that we are what the Bible sees it children of the light that means there's a big light and there's particles of light Oh God oh that came from that same light call it whatever you want to call it but the Bible is right and scientist is trying to understand what God is doing but they're going to if they if they it continue to exist they're gonna have a hard time finding out where we went to when we disappear but is written hallelujah you gotta believe a change of the body is coming hallelujah a change of the body somehow this supernatural light would overtake this natural body and change it hallelujah when I consider thy heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars with our hands ordained what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest made him a little lower than the Angels and has crowned him with glory and honor hallelujah you see what I'm saying when Adam and Eve fell who walked in the cool of the evening Jesus they called him the voice of God but that was Jesus and every time his children get in trouble God sends a prophet Son of Man and Son of Man comes and he straighten out the mess hallelujah and every listen what did the prophet of God do in this last day he brought us back to the altar the real sacrifice hallelujah we can't understand he meant that we're not to bow under organization or denomination but we're to power under the inspiration of the that right it can't change Adam and Eve sacrifice was a lamb it cannot change he's perfect it must always be a lamb you know garden said we're looking at him and Eve you got to do this you got to do that you got to do this you got to do that you got to do this the revelation the revelation of of deliverance the revelation of of of a Hakka descent of salvation came through the sacrifice of a lamb yummy there is no restoration without the lamb that's why John shouted I love it he says heaven and earth hurt I say that's right he didn't say hurt I saying he didn't say heard we saying he said hurt I saying Wow cuz the bride is one hallelujah one she has become the I am teach us how to pray and he said unto him when you pray say Iowa right the devil don't like that because when you say our Father you saying devil there's more of us our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come Thy will be done as in heaven so is an earth is that right so you got this is what I get that that's Scripture I always get to me that will be done in earth as it is in heaven in earth as it is in heaven however I'm acting in heaven is way I want to have him on earth yeah come on y'all better understand what I'm saying don't you know in heaven there there you're never find a service that's gonna be ritualistic well they're gonna sing this song today hmm well I can tell you the fourth song they're gonna say it'll never be like that therefore it should never be like this you and I should never be able to come to church and know the order of the service knock knock somebody huh we should never hold this is where it's gonna be in this world and you know every little move that we're gonna make that is not God the early church was full of power they came with expectation because they didn't know which way the Spirit of God will go to move that is the way it's supposed to be right now heaven will never be boring but when you get into a religion a ritualistic form and style it becomes boring Oh in turn is gates with Thanksgiving in ha you gotta enter if you come in with praise he'll come down and consume the sacrifice it's been a long time since I've seen drunkest in the church hallelujah power power from the kingdom that's what we need power from the kingdom Holly Lou yes when things get rough God sends down the power hallelujah do you think Shadrach Meshach and Abednego could have overtaken that fire on their own no sir when they got in trouble God dispatched himself down hallelujah what was it time travel he came from eternity stopped down in time and with that Cup is that right jesus said I came from God and I go back to God hallelujah he said the only ones who can ascend is those who descended hallelujah and you and I descended and therefore we will assume that right oh it's your truth yeah he said Jeremiah I knew you before you was even formed hallelujah and if God knew Jeremiah he knew you and I he knew what we were going through he knew every trial he was gonna go through so let me tell you like this and guard them pre plan your trip what you worried about it for he's the booking agent he knows every stopping point oh come on somebody he knows every connection you're going to make and have to make before you get to heaven he's not worried about it you said what do you mean this is a return ticket pages a one-way his return but you see you got to be able to pay the price he paid the price but you got to get the ticket how do you go get it brother you got a die and rot oh come on see people don't want they don't want to hear that somebody think well you know when I get to heaven some parts of me it's gonna from here it's gonna be there no you got a rot and die the only thing that will go with you is the gifts that God gave you before you got here uh-huh every good and perfect gift come from God if God did give to use your temperament however you want to say it it will go with you but you see your temperament would be patients looking self we ain't no fighting in heaven so all of that gotta go I ain't no let nobody walk on me yeah if it takes that for me to get to heaven walk on me huh listen you sure all brothers ain't gonna let nobody take advantage of me Jesus did and when he was going through the trials the Bible did say [Laughter] his face like a threat he knew you and I needed this he did everything the right way because he knew sometimes we will fail and so therefore when we die hallelujah there not be one wrinkle one blemish nothing against us why because we don't get we don't get to heaven on our own robe we put on his robe we're over ourselves in his righteousness hallelujah he became I was saying that we might become his righteousness but see that applies to you when you get the Holy Ghost otherwise it's just potential hmm after death there is life and a lot of people don't realize that it ain't finished this is this is a continuing huh and in and in and in and how what I say it in feces they say I'll continue um but this is a continuing hallelujah it doesn't stop here come on yeah however the tree fall that's the way it lay oh you ain't gonna just die sinning and wake up a saint it ain't happenin hallelujah is a continuation of your life here somebody help me here see I think some sometimes people don't understand if you continue in the way you understand me let me say it like this there were four crosses on Calvary we know of the three Jesus and the two thieves but then we know there was a fourth one because Judas hung himself on a sycamore tree JA das cast out Devils good preacher hallelujah but he betrayed Christ and he hung himself on a tree hallelujah and the Bible said crisis is the man that hangs on the tree oh that he had done casting out there was saw the miracles of God treasure all that chuck church work meant nothing it was all canceled out ha because he failed to go to Jesus team that gold like I heard somebody said he went to the high priest but he went to the wrong one had he gone to Jesus things may have changed didn't I got out offer a cane the same thing he said now listen God always give you a chance God said King go ahead and do what your brother did and I grant you rulership over here I said that devil wanted rulership and he had it right there but he was too prideful to repent if he had done in King what God required he would have ruled a able but prior to keep you from the Holy Ghost proud to keep you from doing what God wants you to do and pride is not of God huh huh there's a crop God come to harvest you know he said oh yeah I think it's James says and he waits for the precious fruits you say oh brother I'm almost done with this section of it because I want you to understand that God has something working something you ought to be feeling strange something strange is happening you gotta feel it it's in the air it's in the air something is happening and I'm so glad I can feel it hallelujah and I am able to work with it right now you said what do you mean listen though those those are a school of prophets knew Elijah was going up but instead of joining with Elijah they stayed in their school only Liza was going up I would have joined up with Nyjah so I can go up with him hallelujah this bride know it's about time to go up everybody around the message even knows that this is a time to go up but nobody wanna join up with Elijah Elijah says Lord give me the power when you God I want it what else I want a double portion of it is that right and he said listen if you see me go up you'll get it and he saw allowed to go up come on somebody why the very mantle of Elijah that's what brother man said at the first time when he wanted he didn't have the he didn't see it hallelujah but he'll I sure had to grow up and then when he grew up the same Colton city larger fit Elijah hallelujah that's what the mess is been doing he's been causing up to go up is that right Paul said grow up into Christ now the very role of Elijah the maturity of Elijah it's not fitting Elijah he's no longer boy he's a man that's what Paul said when I was a child I spoke like a child but when I became a man I put away childish things that's what's wrong with the people in the message they still children but we ought to grow up hallelujah there's a power waiting on us a power of authority waiting he got time to fuss he got time to quarrel hallelujah you know what time it is that's what people to understand when Matthew 25 was made manifest it came in our day there should be like in the evening time Matthew 25 the cry was made call you out to meet him that right but what did Elijah message came to do came to make us trim our lamps y'all know what trimming limbs is get all that cake that stuff off you so that you can see clearly get the traditions all hallelujah get all eros progenies away from you you need to see correctly you don't have to rent the veil the veil is already rent you just need to walk in there help us lord hallelujah do you think the probably God called us a little creators for nothing do you think you call us a little messiahs for nothing there's a work to do people all come on
