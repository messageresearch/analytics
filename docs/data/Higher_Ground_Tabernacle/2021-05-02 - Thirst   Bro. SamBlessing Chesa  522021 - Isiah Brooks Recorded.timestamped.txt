[44:25] because he knew that's where he was
[44:26] going to meet his maker
[44:29] he knew that's what he was going to get
[44:31] that his heart's desired
[44:37] uh welcome each and everyone in this
[44:39] place see our brother
[44:41] is it your first time here you're
[44:44] welcome amen
[44:46] sister gladys made it this morning
[44:49] whilst we're standing
[44:50] let us open our bibles to the uh book of
[44:52] psalms chapter 42.
[45:02] psalms
[45:11] psalms 42 verse 1
[45:15] when you thirst for god approach the
[45:17] real god
[45:19] did you appreciate because anything that
[45:22] you shall
[45:22] do any anything that you put first
[45:24] that's your god
[45:28] some people worship their wives some
[45:30] people worship their husbands
[45:34] some worship their money yes they are
[45:38] trying to quench that thirst for god
[45:39] that they have
[45:40] is he saying but when you have that
[45:43] thirst for god you're supposed to
[45:45] approach god for him to quench that
[45:46] thirst
[45:49] because he is more than willing to fill
[45:51] your heart more than you are willing for
[45:53] him to come
[45:59] so we see each and every human god put a
[46:02] thirst
[46:02] for a desire for a god
[46:09] that's why we have more than 200
[46:10] religions in the world
[46:14] because that instinct that god placed in
[46:17] a in a human
[46:18] basket they know they are supposed to be
[46:20] worshiping something
[46:24] but satan knows that and then he comes
[46:26] into pervert
[46:29] that's why some people they worship the
[46:30] sun some worship the moon
[46:35] some worship a piece of wood that's
[46:37] carved as an idol
[46:38] yes come
[46:44] why because they have that instinct
[46:45] within them
[46:49] you see the prophet of god said you see
[46:50] it's something natural prophet did you
[46:52] this
[46:53] was natural to thirst for god
[46:56] that was off the journey it is a natural
[46:58] thing secret truth naturally it's just
[47:00] something that you should do
[47:03] god has just made you up like that
[47:07] and it's no superhuman is it a
[47:09] superhuman
[47:10] it's actually a common thing for your
[47:11] human being
[47:14] it is not special for anyone
[47:18] so people do not understand what they're
[47:20] supposed to quench their tests for
[47:22] legends
[47:27] and they try to find the next
[47:28] alternative that's there for them to
[47:30] quench their thirst
[47:34] brother talks a story about his father
[47:39] he says my father was a drunk and he
[47:42] says
[47:43] it is because he had that thirst for god
[47:45] but he did not know that he was
[47:46] thirsting for god all along
[47:54] the next best thing that was there for
[47:55] him was to was to grab that alcohol and
[47:57] be a drunk
[47:58] oh
[48:03] and he did not know that he was trying
[48:04] to quench the thirst for god
[48:08] and it might be a different thing for
[48:10] each and every one of us
[48:13] the devil always have alternatives right
[48:14] in front of you
[48:17] but you gotta get that realization
[48:21] that it is god that i need in my life
[48:25] although i need that car but it is god
[48:27] that i have to put first
[48:29] one although i'm craving for
[48:33] relationships in my life it is god that
[48:35] i have to put first
[48:40] and the prophet of god says when you see
[48:41] what your desires are
[48:46] then by that you can tell what kind of
[48:48] thing that's in you
[48:52] you can tell what's creating this desire
[48:58] there's a certain thing that you thirst
[48:59] for yeah
[49:14] amen in matthew matthew 6 chapter
[49:18] matthew chapter 6 verse 20 says but lay
[49:20] up for yourselves treasures in heaven
[49:23] when neither moth nor rust dot corrupt
[49:26] and where thieves do not break through
[49:28] nor steal
[49:39] and verse 21 says for where your
[49:41] treasure is there will your heart be
[49:43] also
[49:47] so whatever you value
[49:51] it shows what's inside of you
[49:54] whatever you put first
[50:11] if you value the things of heaven and
[50:13] you value the things of god
[50:18] every decision you make will be
[50:20] influenced by god
[50:25] whatever you do you will consider god
[50:27] first
[50:30] and sound says consider the lord in all
[50:33] your ways and he will guide thy path
[50:39] but if you value the things of this
[50:42] world the things of this earth
[50:45] your desires and your priorities they're
[50:48] always to fulfill your kind of flesh
[50:52] desires
[51:01] because it is showing that you are
[51:02] trying to fulfill the last of your flesh
[51:04] the last of your eyes
[51:12] first john 2 15 reads love not the world
[51:15] neither the things that are in the world
[51:18] if any man love the world the love of
[51:20] the father is not in him
[51:25] first john 2 15.
[51:30] love not the world
[51:33] neither the things that are in the world
[51:36] on the mount
[51:37] says if any men love the world the love
[51:39] of the father is not in him
[51:43] for all that's in the world the lust of
[51:46] the flesh
[51:49] and the last of the eyes and the pride
[51:51] of life
[51:54] is not of the father but it is of the
[51:56] world
[51:58] and we know that satan is the god of
[52:00] this eden
[52:02] of this world
[52:06] so if you are trying to fulfill the lust
[52:08] of your flesh and the lust of your eyes
[52:10] and the pride of life
[52:11] [Music]
[52:13] that is not of the father but of the
[52:15] world
[52:30] it is so easy to tell what's controlling
[52:32] you
[52:34] just look at what you are craving for
[52:38] and what your spirit your soul is
[52:40] craving for regard
[52:44] not your body
[52:49] that's that's that's how satan is going
[52:51] to attempt he's just going to come and
[52:52] tempt that body
[52:56] but when you are saved satan has no
[52:58] reach to your soul
[53:09] and that's an indicator and if you are
[53:10] craving the things of the world in your
[53:12] soul
[53:25] then you have to see god real quick
[53:29] because god is not there
[53:32] and you need him amen
[53:36] so you can tell what's controlling you
[53:38] but why but by what your desires are
[53:40] i love
[53:45] you will always quench the test of what
[53:46] you need by seeing hearing
[53:48] or talking things that satisfies those
[53:50] desires
[53:57] amen like we just said if your desires
[54:00] are worldly things
[54:01] that's what's controlling you
[54:04] and if you're constantly desiring to
[54:06] read and listen and meditate to god's
[54:08] word
[54:20] and you are supposed to quench the
[54:21] thirst with the thing
[54:23] with the thing that only quenches that
[54:25] thirst
[54:30] when you are hungry you don't go to
[54:32] drink water
[54:35] when you when you want to eat when you
[54:37] have to eat food
[54:38] because that's what your body needs
[54:42] water will not do you any good
[54:46] actually your stomach will start hurting
[54:50] because you're trying to punch thirst
[54:52] for water with the wrong thing
[54:57] amen so we have to make sure that in our
[54:59] control tower
[55:00] we have god in there
[55:04] we have to make sure that we have the
[55:06] holy ghost in our soul
[55:10] when you have the holy ghost you cannot
[55:12] go smoking
[55:13] observation um for me
[55:16] you cannot go do things of the world we
[55:32] you want to satisfy the last of your
[55:34] eyes
[55:36] then you know that there is something
[55:38] wrong that's in your soul
[55:41] is the wrong person in the control tower
[55:45] the prophet of god says there's a
[55:47] control tower of the soul and one for
[55:49] the body
[55:52] and each tower is a warning for the
[55:54] needs of the others
[56:00] each one calls to the need for what the
[56:02] caller is calling for
[56:04] appel
[56:09] and it sends out a wave of warning you
[56:12] see that
[56:14] see the flesh always wants to fulfill
[56:16] the desires of the body
[56:20] and the spirit is also desiring to
[56:23] fulfill the
[56:24] the thirst of the soul elizabeth
[56:39] but we should let the soul take control
[56:41] of each and every part of our body
[56:46] amen you know paul says in romans um
[56:49] in romans 4 22.
[56:54] he says whenever i want to do good
[57:06] you see the five senses in our body
[57:10] that we have that's the contact point
[57:12] with this world
[57:14] of contact and that's not saved
[57:19] so satan is going to try and come to
[57:21] that and tempt you through that
[57:24] hello
[57:36] and he tries to give you an alternative
[57:38] to quench you the thirst of your body if
[57:41] i see this
[57:45] you see yourself your sense of hearing
[57:47] you you're tempted to go listen to
[57:49] worldly music
[58:07] memory conscience imagination
[58:11] reason and affection satan will try and
[58:14] put crazy imaginations in your head
[58:20] make you remember the things you're not
[58:22] supposed to remember
[58:25] and you have affection for the wrong
[58:27] things
[58:29] because he's trying to control you from
[58:31] the soul
[58:33] but if you get god in the control tower
[58:37] you will know that god is always there
[58:40] to help you
[58:41] when the devil comes
[58:44] he will be there to save you just right
[58:46] in time
[58:48] amen and we are not forced but it's a
[58:51] willful subjection to the holy ghost in
[58:52] our soul
[58:56] um
[59:00] come and have full control of us
[59:20] david never forced them to go fight and
[59:22] take water
[59:26] but he was just sitting there and he
[59:27] says i so long and i
[59:29] desire the waters of bethlehem
[59:36] then they took it up to themselves
[59:40] and they say the king's desire is our
[59:42] command
[59:47] [Music]
[59:54] so that they could go and fulfill the
[59:56] king's desires
[1:00:10] whatever the bible tells us to do we
[1:01:10] translation it says i find therefore
[1:01:13] this law
[1:01:16] when i'm willing to do right that there
[1:01:19] is wrong that lies near me
[1:01:34] whenever you decide to fulfill the
[1:01:36] king's desires
[1:01:51] so that you go and do what the devil's
[1:01:53] alternative is
[1:01:55] fair alternative if you ever notice
[1:01:58] food smells so good when you are fasting
[1:02:01] um because
[1:02:19] papayas will smell really good come on
[1:02:22] and it's so hard for you to resist that
[1:02:24] temptation
[1:02:27] providing an alternative for you
[1:02:32] the time you decide
[1:03:00] to fulfill the will that he has in our
[1:03:02] lives
[1:03:05] that's what we need to quench the thirst
[1:03:07] that god put in us
[1:03:11] you know the will of god the prophet god
[1:03:14] says the first thing
[1:03:15] is find out whether is the will of god
[1:03:23] or not and then if you want to know
[1:03:26] where there's the will of god look into
[1:03:28] the bible
[1:03:32] there is a thing that sets you straight
[1:03:34] yeah
[1:03:36] it's the word of god and then if you see
[1:03:40] it in the word of god
[1:03:41] for you to do then you do it allah
[1:03:56] and you have to go and verify first if
[1:03:59] that's god will put the thirst in you
[1:04:03] and you go and open up your bible
[1:04:06] if you see what you're being inspired to
[1:04:08] do is written in the bible
[1:04:37] it doesn't matter what things i have to
[1:04:39] face the shows
[1:04:40] okay amen it doesn't matter what satan
[1:04:44] whispers into your ear and whatever
[1:04:45] alternatives he gives
[1:04:49] you he's just trying to block the
[1:04:51] blessings from you
[1:05:04] then the next day you find out no doubt
[1:05:07] the devil will
[1:05:08] make that day twice as bad it is as it
[1:05:10] was the day before
[1:05:20] dude i've experienced it many times
[1:05:24] after you leave sunday morning service
[1:05:27] you are feeling so
[1:05:28] victorious oh you come out of the
[1:05:30] wednesday evening service you're feeling
[1:05:31] so victorious
[1:05:34] but then the devil is waiting for you
[1:05:35] right at the door
[1:05:37] exterior that monday morning he's going
[1:05:40] to try and give you a real beating is to
[1:05:42] demonstrate
[1:05:44] because he's trying to block your
[1:05:45] blessings but you're not supposed to
[1:05:48] stop at anything you keep on going
[1:05:51] when you come in here sick and you pray
[1:05:55] and you feel healed
[1:05:57] when you go out the devil is going to
[1:05:59] try and make you feel more sick
[1:06:02] but because it's in the word of god he
[1:06:05] said you shall be healed
[1:06:06] so that's the will of god
[1:06:12] you keep on going do you have any
[1:06:15] heart's desire
[1:06:29] it doesn't matter how much the devil
[1:06:31] tries to to discourage you and say
[1:06:33] no it was just it was just an emotion
[1:06:39] just keep on holding on to it because
[1:06:41] the devil was trying to block your
[1:06:42] blessings
[1:06:46] so just keep on fighting on continue
[1:06:49] it's satan who's just trying to suppress
[1:06:51] the thirst of god with something else
[1:06:56] that's why we're supposed to be
[1:06:57] sensitive to god always
[1:07:00] sensitive because he places
[1:07:03] the thirst for what we need at the right
[1:07:06] time when we need that thing
[1:07:11] just like your body is going to need
[1:07:14] food when you need food
[1:07:16] it's not going to need water when you
[1:07:18] need food
[1:07:24] god is more superior to the system
[1:07:26] that's in your body
[1:07:28] superior to the system he knows what you
[1:07:31] need and when you need it
[1:07:35] so if you are just sensitive to god
[1:07:39] he will inspire you of what you need
[1:07:44] sometimes you adjust that then you have
[1:07:46] this burden on your heart to pray for
[1:07:48] someone
[1:07:48] the fourth lives of it you go
[1:07:51] right ahead and do it
[1:07:54] that
[1:07:58] and you are there the right person who
[1:08:00] is supposed to intercede for them
[1:08:03] if you're only sensitive enough to know
[1:08:05] that this is god's
[1:08:07] will for me i'm supposed to help my
[1:08:08] brother my sister
[1:08:12] amen when you are sick
[1:08:16] there is a thirst for healing
[1:08:20] and there is already the healing that's
[1:08:21] provided to quench that thirst
[1:08:26] when your body is afflicted you need a
[1:08:29] miracle
[1:08:31] you are thirsting for a miracle you are
[1:08:34] thirsting for a paradox
[1:08:51] so before you ask you already provided
[1:08:53] the thing that you want to receive
[1:08:57] so when you kneel down and you pray be
[1:08:59] sensitive to god
[1:09:03] he will drop in your mind what you need
[1:09:04] to be praying for
[1:09:08] what you are needing at that point in
[1:09:10] time
[1:09:12] the other time we were saying when you
[1:09:13] pray you receive not because you pray i
[1:09:15] miss
[1:09:17] you because you are not sensitive to god
[1:09:22] he is telling you to do something else
[1:09:24] but he's telling you to pray for
[1:09:26] something else but you are praying for
[1:09:28] something else to to satisfy your body
[1:09:31] last
[1:09:32] no if the amount of
[1:09:47] paradox in our lives he prefers on
[1:09:49] paradoxical
[1:09:50] if we approach him with the right mental
[1:09:52] attitude
[1:09:55] lord i need your help he's more than
[1:09:57] willing to quench your thirst
[1:10:02] before god created that thirst for water
[1:10:04] he already made the water before
[1:10:09] you created your heart's desires before
[1:10:11] you desired them
[1:10:16] before you needed healing before you
[1:10:18] were sick he provided the healing two
[1:10:20] thousand years ago
[1:10:24] before you were in despair he provided
[1:10:26] the comfort of two thousand years ago i
[1:10:28] want
[1:10:41] all you just have to do is to be willing
[1:10:42] to let him quench that thirst
[1:10:47] before you sinned before you were even
[1:10:51] born to commit the sin that you were
[1:10:54] that you committed you already provided
[1:10:57] forgiveness for you
[1:11:01] when he was hanging on the cross and he
[1:11:02] said it is finished
[1:11:05] he was projecting his forgiveness and
[1:11:07] his grace to you
[1:11:10] so you know he already gave the
[1:11:12] provision before you have the desire or
[1:11:14] the need of it
[1:11:17] before he created adam and eve
[1:11:21] and before humanity even ever fell yeah
[1:11:39] god created the very thing you need to
[1:11:41] quench that thirst
[1:11:47] that's how god is mindful of us
[1:11:50] he always creates a provision before the
[1:11:53] need
[1:11:56] he knew you were going to be in despair
[1:11:57] that's why he provided what you need
[1:12:01] he provides he already has the solution
[1:12:04] before the problem is
[1:12:21] is approaching do you have a teacher he
[1:12:22] is more than willing to come to your
[1:12:24] health
[1:12:26] if you just stand in that place and you
[1:12:27] say lord i need you
[1:12:30] amen in the scripture that we were
[1:12:32] reading
[1:12:34] you know david was a woodsman when he
[1:12:36] said as the deer panted for water
[1:12:42] if you listen to this to the sermon
[1:12:44] thirst
[1:12:47] was just not talking about thirsting for
[1:12:50] water just to drink
[1:12:52] with david but you know
[1:12:55] in the wild when a deer is out there
[1:12:57] sorry
[1:12:59] if it happens to get hurt
[1:13:14] away from them
[1:13:21] and if it doesn't get any help it will
[1:13:23] bleed to death
[1:13:27] but there is an instinct of thirst that
[1:13:29] god plays in this deer may i understand
[1:13:31] that soft
[1:13:32] plastic that the moment it get it gets
[1:13:35] hurt
[1:13:37] the moment it starts bleeding it has to
[1:13:40] run to find
[1:13:41] water it has to run to go and find a
[1:13:44] stream of water
[1:13:47] the moment it gets to that stream and
[1:13:49] drinks water
[1:13:52] the water is going to cool down its body
[1:13:56] that water is going to stop the bleeding
[1:14:02] and then that d is going to leave he
[1:14:03] said but if that d
[1:14:06] doesn't find this stream of water
[1:14:10] to die so that's what david was talking
[1:14:14] about he says that's why he said as the
[1:14:17] deer painted for the water
[1:14:22] longer if you look in verse 3 he says
[1:14:26] my tears have been my meat day and night
[1:14:31] continually say to me where is thy god
[1:14:36] what is he talking about he's talking
[1:14:38] about when he is in trouble
[1:14:54] his deliverance comes from whenever he
[1:14:57] is hurt whenever he is torn apart
[1:15:01] he has to find that river that river of
[1:15:03] water
[1:15:04] to that deer that river becomes a river
[1:15:07] of life
[1:15:23] place
[1:15:26] for the water as the deer painted for
[1:15:30] the water so long do i long for you
[1:15:33] he's saying whenever i'm torn apart by
[1:15:36] the enemy
[1:16:04] jesus christ because it is
[1:16:07] that waters of life that he gives to you
[1:16:12] they will save you they will heal you
[1:16:15] they will deliver you you will deliver
[1:16:17] before the enemy destroys you
[1:16:19] let us stand upon our feet amen
[1:16:21] [Music]
[1:16:26] amen whenever you fall down
[1:16:30] you rise up and keep on walking
[1:16:46] because that's where the river of life
[1:16:48] is there for you
[1:16:51] that's where salvation is there for you
[1:16:55] amen so you do not stop
[1:16:59] you can play as the deer panther for the
[1:17:00] water
[1:17:03] amen the bible says it just meant
[1:17:06] falls seven times
[1:17:10] but they do not remain down
[1:17:13] there they gotta stand up you want solve
[1:17:16] amen we fall down seven times you get up
[1:17:18] eight times
[1:17:21] whenever you get wounded in the battle
[1:17:25] don't stay in that one place
[1:17:28] you will bleed
[1:17:34] [Music]
[1:17:41] [Music]
[1:17:50] he makes you unfaithful to god and do
[1:17:52] start doing things you're not supposed
[1:17:54] to do
[1:17:56] that
[1:18:13] [Music]
[1:18:35] amen the devil is fighting you he can
[1:18:38] use hatred
[1:18:41] against you and your brother
[1:18:45] hatred against you and your sister
[1:18:48] until you cannot even say you cannot
[1:18:50] even shake their hands
[1:19:05] you end up having grudges with people
[1:20:15] [Music]
[1:20:23] [Music]
[1:20:29] satan has probably been attacking you in
[1:20:31] all different ways
[1:20:34] don't stop right there and feel defeated
