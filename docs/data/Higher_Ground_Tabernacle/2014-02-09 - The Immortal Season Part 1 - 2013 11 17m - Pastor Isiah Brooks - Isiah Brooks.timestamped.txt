[0:00] so we've been we started last week we're
[0:03] not going to sing We started last week
[0:06] on um a little thought dealing with
[0:09] wisdom versus faith and uh you know we
[0:12] we showed in our text or in our thought
[0:15] that we have no no no place for
[0:18] reasoning now one of the quotes that I
[0:20] never did get to but I'm going read it
[0:22] just so you'll know where we're we're
[0:24] going with this and that was in the
[0:26] message wisdom vers versus Faith he said
[0:29] if wisdom is with the word and proves to
[0:32] be with the word and the word produces
[0:36] Itself by the same thing then it is the
[0:40] word but if wisdom is against the word
[0:44] and not with the word but trying to find
[0:48] something to add to it or take from it
[0:52] it is of the
[0:54] devil okay and the Holy Ghost seed of
[0:58] the Bible cannot grow
[1:00] in the atmosphere of wisdom or that kind
[1:04] of wisdom so amen so if we can look at
[1:08] ourselves this morning we can get a
[1:10] better understanding of our spirit
[1:13] spiritual condition and what is
[1:15] happening with us perhaps somewhere down
[1:18] the road you may have uh uh uh uh how
[1:22] could I say it um use your own reasoning
[1:25] for things and I myself have been guilty
[1:28] remember I told you that
[1:30] amen amen and remember I told you by the
[1:33] grace of God Amen that I've been
[1:35] repenting ever
[1:37] since hello somebody when you find
[1:39] yourself wrong you say Lord I'm guilty
[1:43] forgive me amen amen because remember
[1:46] our age and and it's not some of us all
[1:50] of us had to come to a place to say Lord
[1:52] forgive me I was wrong Lord I didn't
[1:55] understand it Lord you know that's the
[1:57] way it really is amen because if it
[2:00] wasn't so according to Revelation the
[2:02] Bible tells us in Revelations
[2:05] 3 amen be zelers to repent and it goes
[2:10] on to say I chasen Those whom I love I
[2:13] rebuke Those whom I love so when a when
[2:16] a when God chasing you and rebuke you in
[2:19] this age you can receive it you can hear
[2:21] it it is a it is surely you know God
[2:25] loves you am how many people in this
[2:27] world would love to know this truth and
[2:30] they have no idea that it even
[2:34] exists when Jesus was on the earth only
[2:37] a few people came to know that God was
[2:39] In the Flesh on Earth amen and those few
[2:42] people amen that was there didn't even
[2:45] receive him he said I came into my own
[2:47] my own received me not but he said I
[2:50] gave power to them that believe so that
[2:53] they could become the sons of God is
[2:56] that right let's stand we're going to
[2:57] read 2 Corinthians 4:6
[3:01] 6 and we're going to read Revelations 10
[3:05] let's read Revelations 10 first okay
[3:08] Revelations
[3:12] 10 it's a great it's a good atmosphere
[3:15] in here but let's take it
[3:18] higher amen amen
[3:22] hallelujah Revelations 10 beginning at
[3:25] the first verse and I saw another Mighty
[3:29] Angel come down from heaven clothed with
[3:32] a cloud and with a rainbow upon his head
[3:36] and his face was as it were the Sun and
[3:40] his feet as pillar pillars of fire and
[3:44] he had in his hand a little book opened
[3:48] and he sat his right foot upon the sea
[3:51] and his left foot on the earth and cried
[3:55] with a loud voice as when a lion roar
[3:58] and when he had cried
[4:00] seven Thunders uttered their voices and
[4:03] when the seven Thunders uttered their
[4:06] voices I was about to write and I Heard
[4:10] a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal
[4:14] up those things which are the seven
[4:16] Thunders uh excuse me which the seven
[4:19] Thunders uttered and write them not and
[4:22] the angel which I saw stand upon the sea
[4:26] and upon the Earth lifted up his hand
[4:29] into
[4:30] heaven and swear by that living swear by
[4:35] him that liveth forever and ever who
[4:37] created heaven and the Earth that
[4:40] therein are and the earth and the things
[4:42] that therein are and the Sea and the
[4:45] things which are therein that there
[4:48] should be time no longer but in the days
[4:53] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[4:55] he shall begin to sound the mystery of
[4:57] God should be finished as he hath
[5:00] declared to his servants the prophets
[5:03] amen amen second Corinthians
[5:19] please second Corinthians we're going to
[5:22] start at the uh six uh fourth chapter uh
[5:25] beginning at the sixth verse
[5:37] fourth chapter beginning at the sixth
[5:39] verse let's read at the third third I'm
[5:42] sorry but if our gospel be hid it is hid
[5:46] to them that are lost in whom the God of
[5:49] this world have blinded the minds of
[5:52] them which believe not lest the light of
[5:55] the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[5:57] image of God should shine unto them for
[6:01] we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus
[6:03] the Lord and ourselves your servants for
[6:06] Jesus sake for God who commanded the
[6:09] light to shine out of Darkness have
[6:11] shined in our hearts to give the lights
[6:14] of the knowledge of the glory of God in
[6:17] the face of Jesus Christ but we have
[6:20] this treasure in Earth and vessels that
[6:23] the Excellency of the power may be M be
[6:26] of God and not of us
[6:30] hello all
[6:33] right let's just stop right
[6:36] there but we have this treasure in Earth
[6:40] and
[6:41] vessels that the Excellency of the power
[6:45] may be of God and not of us amen you
[6:49] love the Lord amen let us pray Heavenly
[6:52] Father God we come before you Lord Jesus
[6:55] as humbly as we know how we thank you
[6:58] for your grace we we thank you for your
[7:00] mercy we thank you for your love and
[7:03] father we feel your presence here this
[7:05] morning we pray father that you break
[7:07] and destroy the yolks of the enemy I
[7:10] pray father that you would just work a
[7:12] work into your people's hearts I pray
[7:14] father that you just have preeminence
[7:16] Lord forgive us of any sin any thought
[7:19] any desire oh God that we may have had
[7:23] that perhaps it's contrary to your word
[7:25] we pray father God Lord that you would
[7:28] just uh move in this place on the altar
[7:30] of the people's hearts Lord to your
[7:33] glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[7:36] amen you may be
[7:40] seated Hallelujah that's another thing
[7:44] when I'm up here praying I want all of
[7:45] you to
[7:47] pray
[7:49] hello come on somebody you're not here
[7:51] to listen to me pray you here to help
[7:56] pray you all all right this morning amen
[8:00] I I'm
[8:02] super you guys I'm feeling real good
[8:06] this morning maybe that's the problem
[8:07] I'm up here and y'all down here but
[8:09] y'all got to come up here for those of
[8:11] you come on now amen so we realize I
[8:14] want to I want to kind of something
[8:16] dropped in my heart here this morning
[8:18] and and and you know and I don't want
[8:20] you to misunderstand it but you see for
[8:23] a long time men never did see God
[8:30] God had no
[8:32] face right it was only in this time in
[8:37] our day God Reveals His face because
[8:42] even in Jesus day they said he was be as
[8:46] above huh most of them didn't even
[8:49] understand that that was God in human
[8:53] flesh now I think I know where you think
[8:55] I'm going but just all your horses
[8:58] because really you've got got to
[9:00] understand that God is creating Us in
[9:03] His image and his likeness right he's
[9:07] moving us into a position that we look
[9:11] just like him amen now I want you to
[9:13] understand amen God is a spirit and I'm
[9:15] not talking about the animal part
[9:19] amen but he's working with the spirit of
[9:22] God because God is a spirit amen but in
[9:26] this last day God put on a face amen
[9:33] oh my let's move on because here in the
[9:36] scripture tells us but if our gospel be
[9:40] hi it is here to them that are lost in
[9:45] whom the God of this world have blinded
[9:49] the minds of them which believe not see
[9:52] what the reason they were blinded
[9:54] because they believed not and God said
[9:57] that he would give you a strong delusion
[10:00] if you believe not so that you would
[10:02] believe a lie and be condemned by
[10:06] it right amen lest the light of the
[10:10] Glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[10:14] image of God should shine unto them Lord
[10:19] show us the father that he suffices us
[10:23] have I been so long time with you amen
[10:27] and you don't know me
[10:29] Jesus said when you see me you see the
[10:33] father amen right because really amen if
[10:36] you look at him you think well he was
[10:38] just talking about his physical being
[10:41] but he was talking about the expression
[10:43] of God the the working of God because he
[10:46] said I can't do nothing except the
[10:48] father show me amen hello somebody amen
[10:52] but it was his character it was his life
[10:55] it was all that was in him because
[10:57] Christ the word says in him dwelt the
[11:00] fullness of the godhead
[11:07] bodily now you got to recognize this
[11:11] brother brandham said it like this he
[11:13] said when when when that Angels those
[11:16] three angels went down to Sodom or even
[11:18] met Abraham he said that was
[11:22] Elohim the self-existing
[11:25] one hello but it was God who stepped
[11:28] into
[11:30] dust 16
[11:33] elements and Abraham was able to
[11:36] recognize
[11:38] it Hallelujah come on somebody why
[11:42] because first of all he calls him
[11:46] Abraham and Abraham understood that only
[11:50] person who knew his change of name was
[11:53] God
[11:54] himself so he calls him Abraham and
[11:57] Abraham see God now manifested In the
[12:00] Flesh and he didn't call him Lords he
[12:03] called him
[12:05] Lord showing had the true revelation of
[12:09] the word amen now we fail to see and I
[12:14] let me say like this according to the
[12:15] book of Acts the book of Acts say we are
[12:18] are The Offspring of God we're not the
[12:23] spring We're The
[12:27] Offspring come on somebody We Are The
[12:30] Offspring in other words we were with
[12:32] him amen when he said let there be amen
[12:37] amen it's important that you know this
[12:40] because really I want you to understand
[12:42] you have been predestinated to do what
[12:45] you do
[12:47] amen you better hold on to that one amen
[12:51] anden because we're living in a Time
[12:53] amen which which the prophet of God said
[12:55] it is the most
[12:57] deceitful of all ages is that all right
[13:02] he said it is the most deceitful you
[13:04] know and I heard him say something the
[13:06] other day he said this age is the age
[13:09] where Satan
[13:11] legalizes
[13:15] sin think about
[13:17] it he legalizes sin everything that's
[13:22] contrary to the word he legalizes
[13:26] it and everybody that stands for other
[13:29] word you look
[13:31] illegal
[13:34] amen right amen but he he legalizes this
[13:37] thing so that you you're the one you
[13:40] look like you're the misfit you're out
[13:41] of
[13:42] order but in reality you are the word
[13:47] amen now I don't know about you even if
[13:49] I like I tell people like this I say if
[13:52] I am the weakest of all Christians Under
[13:55] the Umbrella of this message I'll still
[13:59] will never deny it
[14:03] amen if I am one that cannot live it to
[14:07] its fullest potential I will still never
[14:11] deny it
[14:15] am this evil age is when he's doing the
[14:20] very uh very a it is a very age of
[14:24] deception that's why I I wanted to bring
[14:27] this because you and I we're putting
[14:30] we're being placed in a position where
[14:32] we've got to believe every word every
[14:35] word now whether you understand it or
[14:38] not he said he didn't ask you to
[14:40] understand it he asked you to believe it
[14:43] amen see and when you believe every word
[14:46] of God Amen it puts you in a position to
[14:50] be bride
[14:55] amen I'll be doing a lot of quoting out
[14:58] of the message of of God of this Eva
[15:01] age turn with me to Matthew 24
[15:11] please ain't God
[15:14] good Matthew
[15:16] 24 beginning at the fourth
[15:19] verse now Jesus began to tell us how bad
[15:23] this age was going to be and how it was
[15:27] going to uh uh continue on until
[15:31] basically the coming of the Lord here
[15:34] Amen in the fourth verse of this chapter
[15:37] uh 24 Jesus answered and said unto them
[15:42] take heed that no man deceive you now
[15:45] he's absolutely warning you that there
[15:49] will come those who will and have the
[15:51] ability to
[15:53] deceive but he said take heed that no
[15:55] man deceive you for many shall come in
[15:58] my my name say I am Christ and shall
[16:03] deceive many now watch this because you
[16:07] and I will look at the organizations and
[16:09] the denominations but I want you to
[16:11] understand these deceivers are among the
[16:14] ranking of what we call the
[16:17] message and you should hear wars and
[16:20] rumors of wars see that you be not
[16:22] troubled for all these things must come
[16:25] to pass but the end is not yet
[16:29] for Nations shall rise against Nations
[16:32] kingdoms against kingdoms and there
[16:34] shall be famines and pestilence and
[16:36] earthquakes and diverse places all these
[16:39] are the beginning of Sorrows meaning it
[16:42] ain't over yet see and that's what we
[16:46] don't understand I think a lot of us
[16:48] don't understand it's going to get
[16:51] worse what we just saw over there in the
[16:54] Philippines I'm a hurricane or typhoon
[16:57] however you want to call it amen strikes
[16:59] to land at 195 M an hour some place is
[17:02] 200 and something you and I can't even
[17:06] fathom that's like getting hit by a
[17:08] truck or a car going by that speed
[17:12] because I want you to understand a wall
[17:14] of wind is a wall of
[17:17] wind and it literally ravished the
[17:21] country and we have no idea
[17:24] still how bad it really is yesterday I
[17:28] think they said over a thousand people
[17:30] they were expecting 10,000 to be you see
[17:34] but listen what they don't understand is
[17:37] what's getting ready to happen
[17:39] here
[17:41] Millions upon
[17:44] Millions will
[17:46] die you know why because this church
[17:50] lost its
[17:52] Savor the church lost the salt the
[17:57] church lost the influence
[17:59] remember I preached the other day amen
[18:01] no Nation or country is really judged
[18:04] until the church
[18:06] dies until the church gets out of order
[18:10] amen come on
[18:15] somebody right when you and I get out of
[18:18] order because judgment first began at
[18:20] the house of
[18:22] God and this nation this city called
[18:25] Iowa can be blessed and the power of God
[18:28] God can move among this place
[18:32] if we get in
[18:35] order
[18:37] amen like I said I don't care where I go
[18:40] it's blessed amen when I go to the
[18:43] grocery store sometimes I go to the
[18:44] grocery store nobody is in there and
[18:46] then when I come in there everybody
[18:49] come it's because God blesses us
[18:52] wherever you trod your feet amen
[18:55] wherever you place your feet amen it's
[18:58] blessed
[19:00] hello somebody so we're living in a Time
[19:03] amen where you really come on somebody
[19:06] now it started even in Ezekiel it
[19:08] started he said began at the ancient
[19:10] began at the house of God and because
[19:13] the house of God was out of order the
[19:15] whole city amen was judged am right when
[19:20] Jesus came to to Jerusalem he didn't go
[19:23] to the to the to the the prime minister
[19:26] or the or the you know the the pharaoh
[19:28] or whatever you call him he went to the
[19:30] house of God Amen and because the house
[19:34] of God failed the whole Jerusalem fa
[19:40] amen see you say well what do you mean
[19:42] how many storms this little the church
[19:45] by way of prayer calls to
[19:48] dissipate or to move
[19:50] around and the the news people say well
[19:53] we don't know what
[19:55] happened we want a church and we prayed
[19:59] that God would stop the storm and he did
[20:04] amen Stone upon Stone now we look at
[20:07] this thing because amen we're living and
[20:10] you don't know how dangerous it is to be
[20:13] C become cold starchy and
[20:17] formal amen y'all think oh we didn't you
[20:20] know we it was all right the church is
[20:22] you know the service but to become cold
[20:25] starchy and formal shows that there's
[20:28] something
[20:30] wrong in you somewhere am somewhere
[20:36] Satan has duped you if you come to
[20:39] church and you have no fire to
[20:42] offer hello
[20:44] somebody somewhere you've been deceived
[20:48] amen
[20:50] amen somewhere because listen if you
[20:53] come to church and you don't have no joy
[20:56] oh Lord
[20:59] somewhere you've been
[21:01] deceived Satan is on your track come on
[21:04] somebody and he comes to steal kill and
[21:08] destroy now let me back it up here a
[21:11] little bit let me let me go on he says
[21:13] now just a cold former sty church and so
[21:15] forth of manmade theology he said that
[21:18] wouldn't that wouldn't see the elect
[21:21] would never pay no attention to that but
[21:24] it's up there almost like the real thing
[21:27] just leaving out one word is all you
[21:30] have to
[21:32] do Christians everywhere take heed to
[21:35] the hour we're living in mark down and
[21:39] read and listen close what God called
[21:43] what what would God call a people out of
[21:46] this age for his name the reason it is
[21:49] is to try her oh I don't want to be
[21:53] tried I don't want to go through but
[21:54] you've been called amen for God to try
[21:58] you
[22:01] to see whether you would stand on the
[22:02] word or
[22:08] repent Hallelujah and when she is made
[22:12] manifest been tried and is proven and
[22:16] what he goes on to say to prove to Satan
[22:21] that you're not like
[22:23] eeve Hallelujah to prove to her to prove
[22:28] to Satan you're not like Eve I'm not
[22:31] going to reason with it I'm going to
[22:33] take him at his word now here we are
[22:36] because I want you to understand I read
[22:39] last week on Wednesday when we
[22:42] started you don't have a thought
[22:47] coming yes you know that's where Eve
[22:49] messed up she thought she could reason
[22:51] she started
[22:53] outright but she allowed the enemy to
[22:56] continue to woo her to in her mind she
[23:00] thought well maybe he is no
[23:03] maybe God had already said what he's
[23:05] going to say Amen right and you and I
[23:08] came along and now you say what what
[23:10] what if it ain't no private
[23:11] interpretation brother keth know what it
[23:13] is and I we've gone down to we used to
[23:15] go down to this big I'm G call his name
[23:17] Hope Church and you know everybody you
[23:19] get in Bible study and and everybody's
[23:21] trying to figure out what he
[23:22] said every man want to give that comment
[23:25] on what he said the Bible done already
[23:27] said it
[23:32] John go close the
[23:34] door did he mean go close the door yes
[23:37] sir see that's how silly it
[23:42] sounds right but in the message amen
[23:45] when we come amen when we come Amen to
[23:47] this message we come amen wisdom versus
[23:50] Faith amen Earthly wisdom versus God's
[23:53] faith which is a revelation of the word
[23:55] you don't have to reason with it brother
[23:58] Brown said it is the prophet of that age
[24:00] that interprets the word
[24:03] amenu he interprets the word all we got
[24:06] to do is preach it
[24:09] amen see it's the truth people we come
[24:11] to a place am man I've been guilty I've
[24:15] been guilty but I'm repenting of all
[24:17] that I've ever said or done amen that
[24:19] haven't been completely right on the
[24:24] word you say well what do you mean
[24:26] because understand God had to allow all
[24:28] of us to go through seven Church ages
[24:30] personally am but in that seven Church
[24:33] age personally you've been broken down
[24:36] beaten down stolen Palmer worm canker
[24:39] worm Locust caterpillar done ate from
[24:41] you and now God got to restore you amen
[24:44] hello God restores you as an
[24:49] individual so therefore as he's
[24:51] restoring that means you're growing
[24:54] you're understanding all of your errors
[24:56] and in the process of you are
[25:04] repenting that's why the mighty Angel
[25:07] come

[25:59] Earth but he listen said now the time is
[26:02] short so I need you to be zous to
[26:10] repent hello
[26:12] somebody he goes on to say we find out
[26:15] how this age is to be is to prove to
[26:17] Satan she is not like Eve and that she
[26:20] is not that type of a woman and she
[26:23] would be Tried by his word the bride as
[26:27] Adam bride was tried by the word and
[26:30] Adam's bride believed every bit of the
[26:32] word all but confused on one
[26:36] promise and that he's the same yesterday
[26:41] today and forever he come on somebody
[26:45] but failed on One Promise under the
[26:47] temptation of the enemy face to face and
[26:52] now the people that call for his name of
[26:54] course is his bride she is come in in
[26:58] contact again with the same thing not by
[27:02] just denominational truth or something
[27:04] but uh every word see that's where you
[27:08] are where you and I are we are now in a
[27:11] position if we're going to take a
[27:15] rapture we got to say every
[27:18] word Lord

[27:23] word right oh I don't believe this
[27:26] there's a lot of things I don't
[27:27] understand
[27:29] but I believe it
[27:31] amen for the beginning of the Bible man
[27:34] was given the word of God to live by one
[27:38] word misinterpreted by man called Satan
[27:41] in a person of an animal called The
[27:43] Serpent and Satan in this person could
[27:47] take talk to Eve and misinterpret the
[27:50] word to her and was lost see it must be
[27:54] every word in the middle of the Bible
[27:57] Jesus come and said man should not live
[28:00] by bread alone but by every
[28:03] word when he was tempted by Satan now
[28:07] God telling us here the last day that
[28:10] the God of this world will rise up in
[28:12] the last days and whatsoever shall add
[28:16] whosoever shall add one word to it or
[28:19] take one word from it his part will be
[28:22] taken from the book of life amen listen

[28:28] sad now I'm putting that in there that
[28:31] listen people hear what's being that's
[28:33] mean God be merciful unto us let us not
[28:38] walk as stiff shirs chest struck out

[28:46] too one time were in
[28:50] Disobedience let us with grace and mercy
[28:53] and feelings in our heart toward God
[28:56] humbly come to the throne of grace
[29:00] strange now after some 1900 years of God
[29:02] preaching now she that is the world
[29:06] system is more evil than in the days of
[29:10] when when that he was here the world
[29:13] system is more evil the world is headed
[29:15] to a great climax he said you know
[29:19] that Revelation 18
[29:22] please headed to a great climax how many
[29:26] of y'all believe that amen
[29:29] I'm looking at this thing and I tell you
[29:30] what I'm I'm actually uh shaking in my
[29:33] shoes I can't even explain it all I know
[29:36] is that I've been ordained to make a
[29:38] Rapture Hallelujah come on somebody and
[29:42] those of you who are ordained to make a
[29:43] Rapture Amen Let Us repent drop
[29:46] everything this is our year to go

[29:55] hallelujah and after these things I saw
[29:58] saw another Angel come down from heaven
[30:00] having great power and the Earth was
[30:03] lightened with its glory and he cried
[30:05] mightily with a strong voice saying
[30:07] Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen
[30:10] and is become the habitation of devils
[30:13] and the whole of every foul spirit and a
[30:16] cage of every unclean and hateful bird
[30:20] now if there are people trapped in those
[30:22] systems God just described them I don't
[30:25] care what they look like from the
[30:26] outside
[30:29] is what's on the inside that God see for
[30:32] all nations have drunk of the wine of
[30:34] the wrath of her fornication and the
[30:36] kings of the Earth have committed
[30:38] fornication with her and the merchants
[30:40] of the Earth are waxed Rich through the
[30:42] abundance of her
[30:44] delices and I heard another voice from
[30:46] Heaven say come out of her my people
[30:49] that she be not partakers of her sins
[30:52] and that ye receive not of her plagues
[30:55] amen for her sins have reached into

[36:17] a a different
[36:19] substance in other words the the fire
[36:22] that brother brandham had you and I got
[36:25] it but his me measure of fire was more
[36:29] than what we
[36:30] got because God brought him he was a
[36:33] prophet of the
[36:35] age but we got the same fire it's not a
[36:38] different
[36:39] fire but brother brandham said it like
[36:41] this and I got to quote he said you got
[36:44] to know that you got it he said if Satan
[36:48] can keep you from knowing that you have
[36:49] it he said you won't do nothing with it
[36:53] am amen and that's the problem with a

[37:00] and when you don't know you've got it
[37:02] amen you don't do nothing with it and
[37:04] God is saying examine yourself to see
[37:06] whether you be in the
[37:11] faith Hallelujah there ain't no turning
[37:15] back
[37:17] amen I love the way the prophet of God

[38:05] power and the Earth was lightened with
[38:07] it Glory now when that prophet of God
[38:10] stood on or and I'm not I'm bringing
[38:13] this to you so you can understand so
[38:15] that you can understand that this
[38:17] message is
[38:18] correct and if it's wrong anywhere any
[38:22] place we better look for another Malachi
[38:24] for amen
[38:28] if one word was wrong got Eve and us
[38:31] into this trouble come on all must be
[38:34] right Amen in order to to restore us and

[38:49] nothing time is nothing amen we're
[38:52] working with eternity

[39:00] those Souls that are
[39:02] lost and on Earth they had no patience
[39:04] for nothing but there they don't have
[39:07] nothing but
[39:10] time hello you know things like that's
[39:13] what something something gets to me I
[39:16] don't like the thought of somebody dying
[39:19] without
[39:22] Jesus it disturbs me it really disturbs
[39:26] me because I'm thinking Lord were they
[39:29] ever told do they know the word do do
[39:33] they know
[39:35] him because it's not Everlast it's not
[39:39] Eternal but I'm going tell you what when
[39:40] you've been there in a moment's time
[39:43] that moment's time seems like
[39:47] eternity y'all know what I'm talking

[39:53] situation and it seemed like it was
[39:56] forever and it was just for a few
[39:59] minutes right can you IM you can't
[40:01] imagine it you can't imagine it but
[40:04] listen let's move on listen God ain't
[40:06] judging you according to your flesh look
[40:09] what the prophet of God said in God of
[40:11] this evil he said God will judge you by
[40:14] what kind of a spirit you got in
[40:19] you not judge you by your body amen but
[40:23] by your spirit amen that in a man God of
[40:28] that's what he said God going to judge
[40:30] you because of what you got in
[40:32] you what's in the bottle brother Brooks
[40:35] the Holy
[40:36] Ghost he said you are you got you you
[40:39] got treasure in this Earthly vessels
[40:46] Halle it may like beat up on the outside
[40:50] but it's God on the
[40:51] inside huh remember the prophet God told
[40:54] that story about that old old old uh he
[40:56] looked like a little beggar he was a
[40:58] poor man and everything else he got hit
[40:59] by a car and everything else and you
[41:01] know they took him to the doctor the
[41:03] hospital and they said a he ain't worth
[41:04] nothing a ain't no use in US wasting our
[41:07] time and that old man woke he got up and
[41:09] he said listen I am worth
[41:12] something Jesus Christ died for my sin
[41:15] Hallelujah I don't care I might look
[41:18] beat up to you I may not have nothing
[41:20] Hallelujah but I'm worth a million
[41:24] World sure are you amen
[41:28] ain't no use in coming this long journey
[41:30] and then give up quit or come short no
[41:33] sir this is a time to say Lord
[41:36] whatsoever be it unto me according to
[41:38] your
[41:42] word he said listen the outside man see
[41:46] taste feel smell hear he said but the
[41:48] inside of that spirit is a soul and it's
[41:51] controlled by one thing your free
[41:55] will amen
[41:59] your free will devil made me do it your
[42:03] free will amen you can accept what the
[42:07] devil says or accept What God Says and
[42:11] that determine what Spirits in there if
[42:15] it's a spirit of God it'll feed on the
[42:18] things of God and it won't feed on
[42:20] anything of the world Amen Jesus said if
[42:24] you love the world or the things of the
[42:27] world is because the love of God is not
[42:31] even entered this inner
[42:38] Mano time to say Lord forgive me Satan's
[42:43] deceived
[42:45] you that's the hardest thing people
[42:48] don't want to believe oh I've been a
[42:49] Christian all my life denominational
[42:52] people can say that
[42:54] too and yet we know they're deceive
[42:57] right but you can find people in this
[42:59] message with all kinds of habits all
[43:02] kinds of wickedness in their spirits and
[43:04] their lives and you know what they still
[43:06] believe they going to make a Rapture and
[43:08] that might be true but God ain't taking
[43:11] you up until you're clean
[43:13] amen and the fire of God has come down
[43:16] in you to live in you no unclean thing
[43:21] were in that that's the word amen no
[43:24] wher no liar no Thief not even that one
[43:27] that have a spirit of fear yes you got
[43:31] to get rid of that spirit
[43:36] amen hallelujah I hope you've being
[43:39] blessed
[43:40] am men should not live by bread alone
[43:43] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[43:44] the mouth of god notice we find that she
[43:47] is naked lewd and nude and the world
[43:51] seemed to be in the most evil age never
[43:54] in any age did women ever act like that
[43:57] never but just before the destruction of
[43:59] the anian world woo he said just before
[44:03] the
[44:04] destruction and Jesus referred to it we
[44:07] get to that after a while has God lost
[44:10] control or is he just permitting another
[44:13] agency to control he said I wonder the
[44:16] true answer to this question is to my
[44:18] opinion there is two opposing spirits in
[44:21] the world today at work there can be no
[44:24] more than two two heads the one of them
[44:27] is the holy spirit at work and the other
[44:30] one is the spirit of the devil and in
[44:32] the last days in deception he said I'm
[44:35] going to base my thoughts right on here
[44:37] for the rest of the text he goes on and
[44:39] he tells us amen there's two Spirits now
[44:41] I want you to think this morning how
[44:43] much you've yielded to
[44:45] God how much have you yield to God not
[44:48] in just the last week this
[44:51] morning
[44:54] amen how much of you have obeyed God
[44:57] like we said go the devil ain't going to
[44:59] tell you to get on your knees and pray
[45:03] amen the devil will never tell you to
[45:05] fast unto the
[45:08] Lord come on somebody the devil never
[45:11] will tell you to forgive your brother to
[45:13] love

[45:21] world and one or the other is
[45:23] influencing you right now amen

[45:58] briad for Christ he's doing it by
[46:00] vindicating his Word of Promise to her
[46:02] for this age showing that it is Christ
[46:07] if the finger supposed to move in this
[46:09] age the finger will move if the foot
[46:11] supposed to move in this age the foot
[46:13] will move if the eye is to see it is in
[46:16] the in this age the eye will see amen
[46:19] the spirit of God as it grows into the
[46:21] full statue of God Amen that's what he
[46:25] said the spirit of God as it grows into
[46:27] the full statue of God where in you and
[46:31] me the spirit of God growing into the
[46:34] full statue of God where now listen do I

[48:21] this so that the
[48:23] people that believe God will be called
[48:26] out of this chaos amen the devil's
[48:30] Unholy spirit is here calling his church
