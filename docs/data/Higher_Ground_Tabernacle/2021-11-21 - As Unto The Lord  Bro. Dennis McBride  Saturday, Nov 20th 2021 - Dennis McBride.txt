for each one of our lives [Music] to bring us to a place lord god to where you can be more real to us than what you were before and no doubt father each one of us have seen in the particular way that you've made yourself known to us father as you rose up in the midst of our troubles our times of weakness father god you've shown yourself to be the mighty god that you are so therefore lord as we sing that song father god is more than just a song but it's become a reality to us lord that's the only reason why we're here tonight father god is because it's your strength lord that's preserved us it's by your power father god that you've kept us and all we can say is thank you to them thank you for all that you are all that you've been to us father god well that's all we can say is just thank you lord we pray lord that tonight help us this is your time we are your people although we didn't come to see a man or to hear from them we came to hear from you so lord by your grace we pray that you will please just move in by your spirit lord and minister to the hearts of your children you know our needs lord you know what to give us [Music] lord in all the ways that he stands in need of lord the church here father there is [Music] service to your father in the name of our lord [Applause] [Music] amen it's good to be here i'm sorry motivation god has been very good to us yeah i know we all can say amen today amen amen we thank god for brother brooks also it's always been a blessing to our lives from the first time i heard a minister even up until now it's just an effective ministry i've watched god work through that ministry and the many lives that god has has touched through that vessel but the lord is continuing to live through them in the ordained places that he sent them to them and it's a real work real results and real lives hey man that that proves that it's really god should i prove [Music] just good to see everybody again and the new faces that i've not seen i know it's a saturday night someday amen so let's get right into the word tomorrow and how by the grace of god i hope not to keep you alone because we got to come right back on tomorrow morning so we pray to the lord help us amen um i want to go to [Music] colossians chapter 3. thank god for my family of course they're at home in columbia south carolina colombia south carolina for those again that don't know me i have five children my oldest lenny he's 25 now uh vincent coming no and then uh my next to the oldest he'll be 20 on next week 18 year old amen praise the lord okay so colossians chapter 3 want to start at verse 16 come on it says let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom it says teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord amen and i want you to to really focus in on the fact that he says at the end of that he says to the lord all right so we're going to come down the next verse says and whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god and the father by him submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it is fit in the lord from so notice he's focusing the attention again on the lord so let what you do let's go to school be as unto the laws because normally when you do or feel like you're doing something as into a man because sometimes we don't hold things in the same regard we'll be more careful in how we speak and what we do isn't that right hey man i feel good right now so just and then bear with me okay so it says in verse 19 husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them children obey your parents in all things how many things all things chosen but notice there is a focus for the children as well because it says here for this is well pleasing unto the lord all right that's very important so sometimes as children you can look at your parents and you can choose to give respect and you can choose not to give respect based off of how you're feeling at that time but when you conduct yourself or deal with your parents as unto the lord then that'll give you that'll cause you to give a more consistent behavior does that make sense all right it comes down and says fathers provoke not your children to anger it says lest they be discouraged servants obey in all things your masters according to the flesh it says and whatsoever ye do you know do it harder as to the lord and not unto me knowing that of the lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance it says for ye serve the lord christ but he that do with wrong shall receive for the wrong which he doeth and there is no respect of person amen let us pray once heavenly father please help us lord have your way we ask you jesus christ's name amen amen amen god bless you may be seated thank you all right so for a subject tonight i've emphasized it already in the reading of the word we want to be able to approach the subject of as unto the lord so just from the verses that we've read so far god has a desire and god has a standard he has a standard of conduct that he expects for you and i is to humble ourselves to between the worker and the boss so in the workplace the lord is telling us that we are to obey where to do things with the heart [Music] that determines what kind of a job you do when you go to work i mean you know amongst children that are coming up at very young ages they want to be able to do whatever they want to do you understand they don't want to they they don't want to remain subject to they want to be able to step right into being a full adult director only having to abide by and just live their lives in the way that they see fit but in the sight of god man he know that we're children of something i'm a grown man you may so and it might have a reward that you don't want to receive obviously because god is a good god he's a merciful god so as we go about our lives on a day-to-day basis there's a focus that god wants us to keep yeah um because in life you have trouble in families you have trouble no families in families you have disagreements on that for me parents don't always agree with the children the children always agree with the parents there's something that's that's too commonly neglected and that's it's two things actually is it it's more than that but it is two main things and the reason why i emphasize that is because there is you understand if we're not praying like we need to come and if we're not reading the word of god now when i say reading i'm not talking about like a newspaper who in here would raise their hands and say that they know everything who in here would raise their hands and say that they fully know god in all of god's word [Music] none of us would right there's so much more to god to understand the bible is full of lessons and instructions that still have to be made clear to us and even in the things we've already heard many times people are give a response i already heard that i already know that like we're supposed to have see so that's that's the importance of the baptism of the holy ghost because we can read the word and we can uh intellectually understand the word that's what the pharisees did this is you couldn't put a finger on their lives you couldn't catch them doing nothing [Music] is amen this is something we already know but there is a real paul said that he was looking to apprehend that in which he was apprehended amen no doubt god has his hand in our lives but there is more submission we can't put our own seal of approvals on ourselves the just the real life situations that you and i encountered as being humans right there are tendencies that are within us you have choices you can make on how you would deal with that situation right situation but there is a way that god would have for you to deal with that situation that you feel the treatment based off of your feelings you understand that but see one thing that i realized this spiritual world listen how many realize there are spirits in this but demon powers are here as well and if you can't properly discern the vote that's actually lit talking to you listen i want to try to make this as simple as possible when spirits speak to us because we have spirits it comes as thoughts that's right there was something that spoke to his spirit spirit suggests things all the time spirits want us to gain certain perspectives or view it wants us it wants our minds to actually capture what it is that it's trying to communicate right right so now a spirit will come and it'll speak to our minds and we hear it but it comes to us as a thought and we're not aware we're not aware that it's actually something outside of us in the bible concerning judas now the spirit that made him do it because the bible says satan entered into judas but judas didn't know the devil ended unto him he just found himself having thoughts and he began to move that spirit lifted up off of him left him in his right mind now then he realized i betrayed innocent blood but it was too late you understand that's how spirits operate whenever we sing whenever any one of us sings that's exactly what's happening a spirit comes upon us and in that time we're not thinking we're not able to capture or discern what's actually going on but then but then when we yield ourselves to those thoughts now the thoughts of the devil became words to ease now you see that spirit now coming inside of us she didn't know anything else but righteousness and holiness and the things of god but as soon as she opened up her mind do it it caused her to feel comforted it made her feel like she could go ahead and do it is that simple enough this is a sampler so that's what we deal with and that's what we're dealing with right now in this room it's a spiritual warfare we're not concerned about the devil because he can never overpower god can we say amen today so the devil has desires if somebody do something wrong wrong to you he wants you to do something wrong if somebody hurt you he wants you to have a certain mind toward that person resentment hey man he wants you to act overall he wants you to actually act like that person the bible says answer not a fool according to his father [Music] unless you become like him i'm one all right everybody understand that but that's what it is it's a secret see in the world that we're living in it's a very cruel world but in the midst of a cruel world god is still calling for lambs that don't respond like the devil wants you to respond you understand so now in the midst of our family problems you know and church problems and work problems no matter what they are coming in god wants us to have and keep a certain focus regardless of how you being treated by your boss [Music] or by your husband or by your wife or by your i want you to speak vocabulary heirs unto the lord i want you to be examine i want you to be an example to them example of what they should be they're sick isn't that right we're lights right what does that mean we're reflecting his life isn't that right so for the children god says be obedient to your parents in all things [Music] as unto the law come isn't that right because again when you're looking at your parents depending on how you're feeling sometimes i was a child once you i did things i wasn't supposed to do i because i was young you know i i was one of the ones that thought i had it all figured out i got to the place to where my mom and my grandmother couldn't tell me nothing but i was wrong i was supposed to obey you i was supposed to humble myself but the grace of god may like you even though i started off wrong by his grace he came by my way and he brought forth a change in my [Music] i came up there was something that i knew it was it something began to affect me hey man but something began to penetrate that stony heart and it wasn't because i was going to a church it was because it was my time you don't have to be in church if you're a child you're a god child no matter where you are he was going to persecute more christians he was totally against the cause of christ isn't that right but regardless of his present condition doesn't mean nothing 15 minutes but it didn't matter now it was his time who he really was sick was getting ready to come forward so that people can now see in his life became totally different to that difference i don't know why i'm just kind of feeling to stay right here in this family area and we experience pressures how many who who in here don't get irritated sometimes we get upset sometimes before some priest and and many times we have responded wrong to situations amen amen in the lord in those times because i have grown children myself right and the lord directed me to these scriptures because it's something that he wanted me to focus on [Music] regardless of how upset somebody makes you important regardless of what they do to you seek you seek your phone from your heart god wants you to be able to look at that person jesus christ let me let's go to this scripture here real quick i don't know receive it and where are we john chapter 13 and verse 34 it says a new commandment i give unto you it says that ye love one another he says as i have loved you that ye also love one another when we've not lived right toward him how did he handle us or how does he handle us right now does he throw us away does he try to emphasize or is he interested in just making us feel bad isn't that right and she was brought forth before jesus and they said she was caught in the very act according to moses she's supposed to be stoned she's supposed to be and the bible says initially jesus continued to ride in the ground as though he didn't hear a word see at that time within themselves they felt like they were okay they had wrong in their lives but a self-righteous spirit because nobody [Music] you know because he was god right he accommodated you when he looked over the crowd he saw every single one of their lives he looked at him and he said let he that is without sin cast the first while he was kneeling down behind his back the anointing of god was so thick in that place he wasn't going to let nobody forget he made sure everyone in their secret sins came to mind she said they are none so he wasn't giving her a ticket to go and freely live a life that's not right but he did grant her grace isn't that right so as we're dealing with other people he says i want you to love one another as i have loved you the bible says love has oh it covers a multitude of sin somebody can actually be doing something wrong [Music] but you don't have to respond to it in the way that the devil would have for you too you can see somebody doing something wrong and you can see that need that's there everywhere but then you can go and just pray about it isn't that right see i realized that i realized that in my own words just get brother brooks as preachers just because you preach that's not what brings the change so now that's helped me because now you know when i'm dealing with people and what have you i can speak the word of god and you so you're not preaching something one day and the next day expecting it to be in full fruition full material no but you understand it's a process it has to go through and you and you now now you can just trust god as a parent with the children you gotta trust god you can't change your children if god don't bring the change it ain't gonna be no change that god is amen so going back to prayer and reading the it word you into a place to where spiritually spiritual you're a little more sensitive right isn't that right how many experienced that before when we don't pray i'm all over the place right now i gave my title but i'm just i'm just going according to how god when we don't spiritually so therefore when we're not praying and we're not reading like we're supposed to lose some suppose we find ourselves responding wrong we're able to fuss now we're able to entertain wrong faults but but but when those things are are being tended to we're yielding ourselves to to those things that god gave us to do [Music] humility humility you understand so that anointing draws near to you and i lost you so now it's not hard for a child you've been praying because even though you're a child god will give you things to understand jesus that little bit of effort you can put forth let's see the lord have blessed you so abundantly but then when you're under when it comes to men's ability but how many realize that with god all things are possible can we say that together with god all things are possible he's not limited to what we're limited to he called samson to beat down hundreds of men at the same time picking up gates [Music] and call somebody to raise from the dead in first peter chapter three don't um we're talking about as unto the lord now it says likewise you wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word it says they also made without the word wow watch out he says this he says be in subjection right so of course the husband's it's a little different but you understand what i'm talking about you just be in your place right be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wise men so now you become the living word to them and god is just saying that you submit yourself to me and even if your husband ain't right don't you deal with him according to his present condition this is a message called there was something in here and let him know that was genuine no doubt he saw how she conducted herself as unto the lord in the midst of all the trouble he was introducing into the family he washed the consistency of her she was experiencing being a part of a a dysfunctional home dysfunctional it's not always easy as as children sometimes your parents may not be where they need to be but god is your spiritual father spirituality amen and if you humble yourself to him and you pray for your family just watch god move by his grace praise the lord so now he picks up this story about this man because he has friends now i mean and and and they were talking about you know uh how how there are no real christians out there but this husband had an experience so maria and he had to speak up he said well now i don't know what you guys experience have been he said but i have a wife at home and if ain't nobody else a christian he says this woman has proven to be a true christian so i'm gonna pick it up from right there because now they want to go home he said come to my house maybe not just send me vinnie i'm doing amazon they probably have been drinking but they weren't just all out drunk out of their mind oh is it the evil on they when they write mine [Applause] so their condition wasn't as bad as they acted as though it was once they came into the home isn't that right so brother branham picks it up here and he says talking about the husband he says no she's still a christian up home and now let's really be drunk we're going to act like we're really drunk knocked at the door come in staggering over everything he says while the chair is sitting around this way and everything and she set them all in a chair and his guests [Music] that was her husband somali she was being subject isn't that something he has a man didn't deserve it so she came and made sure they all was able to sit down look at the life of christ on display amen amen it says and she went out and fixed them they asked for some food and she went out and fixed them some food said we want ham and eggs he says he know he know they had it he knew it was in the refrigerator he was the husband he know they had it so they fixed so they fixed the ham and eggs when he got there to the table he looked at them like that looked at his friends picked up the plate and slammed the stuff on the floor said you know that you say i don't like my eggs like that come on boys let's get out of here anyway anyhow you see he said so they went out and sat down like that you know this is not sick and she come out she said dear lady she says i'm sorry i didn't fix them she was apologizing for not doing it in a way that he said that he wanted it done she could have had a much different response how would we respond if somebody just in our face just did something like this but but see she was under an anointing she wasn't just acting like this it was something that was coming from her soul you understand why while she's doing this she she's not fussing in her mind [Music] but this was coming from this woman's heart she apologized right say what she said i didn't get them fixed i'll fix some more for you you know i didn't want them that way in the first place just carrying on like that they went out there and sat down and acted like they was drunk they heard her in there kind of snubbing to herself she was a woman elite farmer she was a human what her husband was doing it hurt her feelings right but because of what was in the control tower and the devil wants to come in and take advantage of us in those times and he wants to try to make us respond in certain ways but when he's there [Music] he gathers our thoughts together us his thoughts now to come to the forefront of our minds so she was crying but she was because she was hurt it was a hard life to live right but now she's manifesting the very scripture we just read manifest that husband and those friends this is i mean we're beholding her chaste conversation [Music] and allowing her actions unto the lord amen you know god was sitting right there hey man he was right there watching his daughter in the midst of and i'm gonna go back to a scripture real quick we opened up with this it was in colossians chapter 3 and verse 16. it says let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts so now she's crying and she began to sing listen now this is god's way of dealing with these men's hearts they thought they came to pull us put a little trick on her but god was actually using that situation to pull something on them they now were going to become the very ones they say didn't exist and that little woman led her husband a country plus these others to christ what happened saints at any time no matter what the situation is amen but all he needs for us from us is humility being willing to bring being willing to subject ourselves to me being willing to forfeit our rights and i want to leave you with this because you amen amen children on farm you don't know how precious it is you say in the sight of god for you to humble yourself and be respectful and obedient to your parents regardless of how you feel or what you're going through god want you to keep him as the focus and let that dictate the response you give let's listen at i know it's difficult sometimes just sexy difficult you feel like you're being mistreated and even though your husband may not be all together okay right now i need for you to trust in me that i'll bring forth the results that your heart is and allow your got the fuss about everything something i had to do the lord helped me i i rephrased that something the lord helped me to do yeah this is my idea you know children will be children they're still growing they make mistakes they make wrong decisions decisions right for those that don't have the holy ghost they still need the holy ghost sometimes how you respond i think how strongly you is nothing's really accomplished by force he was showing me there is a much more effective way hold back the harsh talk um you seek my face more and in prayer you allow me to sweeten your spirit don't because what i'm saying in what i'm saying i'm not saying that god won't chase in that child sometimes through stern words and things of that nature but as long as it's god then it's right you understand as long as it's god this is right but if it's us in a wrong spirit correcting our children in the wrong spirit you're not accomplishing anything anyway since the lord brought that to my mind and i began to submit myself to that i had a desire to say lord show me what's going on because we always want the relationships and things to be improved meow and you want to see where the enemy is working not just in everybody else but lord of he's working through me i i didn't want to be like the mob that was bringing the woman caught into the act of adultery at that moment in my own mind you know appear to be righteous isn't that something that's why i begin to want and desire to deal with situations more in love more in the spirit i wanted i wanted to be more careful that it was more of the spirit of god and not just me allowing the devil to come in and in a wrong spirit there's been a change but it was because god was able to help me to see me and by his grace give me grace to be able to handle the situations in the way that he wanted me to so god is concerned about the whole family he gives us what we need to be able to become better make our homes better you know our service to the you know not to the church per se because the church is the people but it's about just the order that god has set up the public for a conduct from the congregation to the pastor and from the past to the congregation there is a way in which god desires for each party to handle one another as a pastor to be able to see that you are the very wife of god you can't be handled in any kind of a way just to get up here because i'm in the role of a pastor or a leader just be real harsh and whatever in a wrong spirit those things you might get a temporary conformity lasting for giving us the instructions that we need when we need doing you know you got so many people that have been affected by police brutality until people's mindsets just cascaded they don't want to respect the police officers but how many realize that god asks for us to be subject to juventus isn't that right so regardless of how many are maybe conducting themselves in the wrong way god don't give nobody a green light a person to give to to in return have a rebellious mindset to where you disrespect and mishandle the law of the land but i'm looking that's why he said when you're at your jobs do a good job not as men when the ball staying around doing what you want to do and then when the balls come around tighten up and that one thing is you could take that across the board don't don't come to church and just have eye service hey man this is your come to church one way and go home and be another one and that's what he's here to do and that's what he's doing right now we're not the same people can we say amen today we're not the same people god has he's changed us and the work is still in progress he's getting ready to cap us off i don't know about you i'm ready to go home i'm not comfortable here i'm very uncomfortable this let us all stand again amen [Applause] i had many other thoughts on my heart but as i saw things began to go in a certain direction i just wanted to yield to that lord is a very important [Music] it's important to you lord that we be able to deal with people right [Music] you've given us grace father god to to come out of the lives that we were drowned in lord you've been revealing yourself to us along the way but the work is not finished as of yet there's still more lord god for us to enter into yeah there's still more of your life to be received [Music] even though we may have received an initial baptism of the holy ghost there's more of you to receive lord [Music] so that father your life can we each are very mindful of the rough areas of our lives the doors that we have not allowed to be fully open [Music] that you want to come in and have fellowship with us in those particular areas of our lives [Music] those lingering things father god you desire to come and have fellowship with us in those areas and god we just pray that you would help us lord to humble ourselves to you [Music] but to allow you to come and just have your free course throughout our lives [Music] pray for the families of this church [Music] we pray for the church family here father god and not only here lord but just wherever your bride is gathered [Music] because the same pattern of problems and issues exists everywhere but you're calling for something [Music] you're lord for us to have and maintain that focus so that when we're dealing with the different situations lord we're dealing with it lord as unto you we're not allowing the enemy to come in lord god calls our conduct and our thoughts to go in the direction that he would have for them to go lower [Music] so there will be more of you on display by your grace help us all we pray father we commit our lives to your lord help us to have a rededication of our lives and no father god in life sometimes lord sometimes we get weary the fun of some fabulous sometimes it becomes difficult [Music] the pressures of life in the different situations of life [Music] and in those times the enemy comes and he tries to cause us to break to give in [Music] even our prophet went through that lord [Music] the hardest moments of his life the enemy came in and tried to convince [Music] if it wasn't for the spirit your spirit that you that you allowed to come inside of his life [Music] that you begin to speak from at that time at that vulnerable moment he said had [Music] but you reminded him lord that he wasn't nobody in him [Music] he came to the conclusion lord that you give and you take away and he began to bless your name [Music] but it was because of that present power in his souls [Music] of your spirit be granted to every heart that's in here tonight we needed heavenly father that's the only way lord we can truly humble ourselves to your words [Music] we ask this father [Music] [Applause] [Music] raise them brother dennis uh [Music] perhaps didn't know why he couldn't stay with his notes it's because god was in this place and i can truly say that brother dennis and i have not talked other than coming home from the airport today i i'm i stand amazed from the beginning to the end i know god was speaking not only to others but to me personally situations that i needed to know how to do and how to handle and i can't say that i was doing everything as untold but as the word of god has come you repent and you ask god to forgive you of your sins and help you to allow the word of god to live and i i like it when he brought it out that just at the very end the word was made flesh that's what i desire in my life more than anything is for god to be seen through this earthly vessel and uh so i know the word which has spoken to hearts tonight [Music] especially when i love that word humility because all of us can use more of it and you know that's the way god is and i want to i want to say i don't know what i told you not i won't be here in the morning but i want y'all to treat brother uh [Music] as unto the lord [Music] i've got to go down to iowa city tomorrow but by the grace of god i love the lord and i just there's no words to express and i don't want to take away the sweet anointing there is no words to express what all god covered i just wish there were some others who i wish they were here because i'm going to tell you something that we can't learn i said like brother brad i'm saying this he says no grace no love no love no grace and if we can't allow ourselves to extend grace to each other then that shows we don't have the love that we should have toward each other so i appreciate the lord and wow what a beautiful beautiful beautiful service it was a masterpiece and i will go back and listen to it again amen i'm gonna ask our songwriters to come i don't know whether it's somebody that desired prayer if you need prayer i know the time has been well spent but it's been good my heart i don't know how you feel but my heart there's a little butterfly type thing going on in my heart now because the lord spoke directly to me i love it when it comes this way that's why i believe that this is the throne of god brother branham call it the judgment seat is where god comes and began to speak to us and every time you come to church you're supposed to take the word of god personally not look at someone else and what they're going through but what he said he said it was ending there the way he handled things even with his own children he wants to learn how you want god to get him out of the way and put god in there that's basically what i what i perceived [Music] so [Music] jesus [Music] jesus [Music] jesus [Applause] [Music] jesus [Music] me [Music] oh i will never [Music] my savior is [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] the name of the a strong tower [Music] a strong time [Music] and they are safe [Music] oh blessed be the name of the [Music] be lord name of the lord [Applause] [Music] the name of the lord [Music] [Music] the right [Music] the righteous [Music] oh glory to the name of the lord [Music] for glory to the name of the [Music] to lord name of the lord [Music] magnify the name of the lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] magnify the name of the lord [Music] [Music] oh blessed be the name of the lord
