lord this evening appreciate those that came out i appreciate your faithfulness amen everyone in their place at their task of duty the lord sees every lord season your efforts amen amen amen let's just as we stand in honor of the word of the lord let's open up to the book of acts chapter 2. i want to read the 39th verse and don't plan to be very long tonight but i just wanted to kind of refresh ourselves on some things amen acts chapter 2 verse 39 and we're just going to read the first six words of this scripture amen and uh let's just read those six words together amen acts chapter 2 verse 39 the first six words and it says for the promise is unto you amen the promise is unto you i don't know how many youths we have in here amen but if you can claim yourself as being one of those youths then then let's continue on amen amen you can let's just uh our heads in a word of prayer amen heavenly father we just approach unto you this evening lord being small in number lord but yet as you have given us the ability father to be great in faith lord and we claim that father lord maybe in our own flesh in our own ways and our own thinking we wouldn't think that of ourselves of being great of faith but yet when we consider the promises that we have been made children of abraham by the same faith by the same inheritance lord that we can rise up and say it's in the genes that we are great in faith lord lord and we claim these things father lord we we don't know what else to do standing here in the last days of the father but we but we claim this great thing to be great in faith lord and knowing that what your promises have been given unto us are also exceedingly great promises that the bible says lord that we want to be faithful in in considering what you have given to us so lord i pray father tonight that as we go through some of these promises lord that your hand will be upon us lord you as your spirit has searched our hearts already lords we've gathered wherever two or three are together you said i'll be right there in the midst of them lord we claim that as a promise by faith father and lord we thank you for for for the the for for bringing your your portion of the promise to us lord and we just pray father as the service goes on tonight lord that your hand to be upon every of uh here every member here in the church father and those that are watching online father that after the service is over that we can say that that the lord was with us here on the wednesday evening and lord we just want to thank you father we dedicate ourselves lord upon your altar tonight lord lord saying have thine own way open our hearts father lord here in the last days don't let us be stony hearted lord lord have a close mind father but lord let us open our hearts and our minds lord to you lord that you might have your way tonight in the name of jesus christ we pray and the bride of christ said amen amen amen you can be seated amen i know that's just a very small text and you know what brother branham said about a small text he says you know it's like the stamp you know it's a small piece of paper you know but he says but it's not necessarily the the paper that is made of but it was what was on the paper amen and there is a promise that has been made unto us amen and you know maybe if the word promise had never been the english language we wouldn't have known what to do we wouldn't have known necessarily what to hold on to amen but you know it's not just in the english language but came from the hebrew and the the origins of the word promise are go way way way way back way before the english language way before the french language way before any of those languages were even thought of that there was there was a language in existence amen that abraham spoke amen that adam and eve knew of amen there's always been a language upon the earth and as long as men have been speaking amen no matter what language that they have spoken of there has always been a word for the word promise amen there's always been something that people can express that a promise exists that's right amen there's been something that that every language upon the earth that when a man utters something right amen and he signs it with his signature he he promises it with his own being i promise something that's right i i give him my vow i'm giving my being i'm saying this is my word you can take it to the bank amen you know and here in the united states it used to be that that people used to have a saying said my word is my bond amen and people when they made a promise that all of a sudden if they found themselves unable to to to uh fulfill their promise that they would they would go and borrow whatever money they could from the bank to fulfill that promise they would go into bankruptcy to fulfill a promise they would they would they would uh uh put their own self to the hurt to fulfill a promise that's right maybe you think back to uh back in history of the ancient days in japan where men would would kill themselves to to defend their honor if they were unable to to fulfill a promise they would actually kill themselves in suicide to to because their honor was destroyed if they were not able to fulfill a promise amen in every culture and throughout all the cultures you can see that that men when they made a promise that there was an expectation that they would fulfill that promise that's right right because god has placed something inside mankind that that when a promise has been made when a promise is uttered it creates a debt upon the person that has uttered that promise and that debt must be paid that that debt has to be paid it creates a debt that must be paid amen do you know that that the reason that there is mankind to have a thought of a promise amen it's because we are created by a promised giver amen we have a we have a god that has created us amen and he has has given us a position that is greater than the animals of the earth amen and even though we've come here upon this earth and we've been given an animal like or a body like unto the rest of the animal race amen there is something down inside our hearts inside our spirits that raises us up above the animal nature amen there is no other animal species out there trying to build spaceships to leave this world amen there is no other animal nature out there that is trying to communicate with other animals on another continent amen or two to two to build houses that are there you know 50 stories up into the air amen they're they're the the the different information age you think about the bitcoin and all the websites and the technology going around the world and the fiber optics we've we've transformed this world into the image that is in our mind because there's something inside of our spirit that is greater than the animal race and that thing came from a promise giver that gave a promise unto us amen that we were made we were created in his image but not just that but he says the promise is unto you that's right amen as we read there in acts 2 39 those six words for the promise is unto you now if you were to just consider those six words as being the entire bible all by itself that's right you know if that's all we had from our god amen if those were the only words we had from the creator amen if that was all that we had to consider amen that was still would be a great thing why because not did he not not only did he just mention himself in there as being the one that could give the promise but he also mentioned us in there as the one that the promise is unto that's right amen i was looking at what the word that word promise meant and when you go back into the hebrew of it the word promise is ep angelo and the middle consonant of that word is the word angel because the word angel is a messenger a messenger that has an announcement amen because a promise is not a promise until it is uttered until it goes forth amen a promise first has to enter into the mind of the one that is giving the promise amen but there has to come to a point in time where that promise is announced that's right and when that promise is announced is the day that it goes into effect amen when the promise is given that promise is given out to go into effect amen as when it just sits there in the mind of the giver then the promise is not in effect yet amen but when the promise goes out there is this point in time when that promise is put into effect amen it's ready to be acted upon and it's no longer just in the mind of the one giving the promise but now that promise has left that being amen and gone into the being of the one that is to receive the promise amen when the one that receives that promise it goes into their minds and it sets an expectation that they can enter in and grab a hold of it right then they can take it now i i you know there's many men throughout the ages that have made promises amen and you know then you have to consider the reputation of of the one that that made the promise to you you know i've been walking downtown and i've had beggars come up to me and make a promise to me and you know in your mind that they there is no way that they are ever going gonna fulfill that promise you know there are certain people who come to you and says i'd like to borrow ten dollars so i can uh pay you back in a week from now and you and you just know in your mind that there you might as well just kiss that money goodbye because you're never gonna see it again amen because there is nothing behind that promise that's right amen there there is no there is no history behind it that's right there's nothing that you can consider about it amen but with this promise the same one that made this promise is the same one that said let there be light amen if you ever walk into a room or walking down to the daylight you know you think about the sunrise you don't care where you go in this world if you go to a place that is along the ocean amen that faces towards the east go down to the beach or around six in the morning around sunrise all of a sudden you'll see people you know at four o'clock there's no one on the beach five o'clock there's no one on the beach you know six o'clock all of a sudden there starts to be a glow in the distance you see one person two persons three persons all of a sudden people begin to gather they're waiting for the sun to rest they're coming along they're jogging they're they're they're looking down they're walking up and down the beach they're listening to the waves but the the main reason that they came there is they they want to be there when that sun begins to rise amen there's men that they go up they climb the tallest hill i mean they they they go to the beach they go to the place where they can watch the sun begin to rise why because there is a promise that the light shall be there amen that's right and throughout all the ages there's been a testimony that that every day of a certain time the sun is going to rise it's just going to happen we take it for granted but the whole thing is because there was a promise given unto mankind that there will be light upon the earth consider the background of the one that gave the promise amen is he able to do it can he do it is the one that made this promise is it possible he could fulfill it that's right and when we consider the words of our lord we we know that what he says is the truth amen amen we can take his word to the bank we can take the the the promises of the bible and we can consider them and we and we look at them and you know instead of just reading over them flippantly you know or or half-heartedly but if we stop and consider each one for a little while we consider is this god that we serve is he able to keep the promises that he gives to us amen and if we start to consider it for a while and we look back to those that have gone before us who have also inherited promises amen you think about abraham who who god called him out come out i want to show you a land i want to give you a land as an inheritance amen he left his father's inheritance behind to go to his true father amen to go to a land that god was going to give to him amen and you know you you come down to that special place there in genesis where one day he was he was uh he came to a a stopping place they may came to a place where he he he wanted to commune with god he wanted something from the lord he wanted to meet with god he he he just he wanted a face to face communion with the lord amen he went he got some clean animals you know and he went he divided them in half amen and he and he went as he was as he was dividing the animals in half as a sacrifice and he laid them down he did it all according to something that god had placed in his side of his mind and as he was as he was building putting the sacrifice there they finally he had all things ready everything was ready he was there the sacrifice there but there was one thing that was missing and god was not there yet now if he had been considering god to be like unto like we said the one of the beggars or or or someone whose word didn't mean anything that maybe he could have hung around for a few minutes you know and says well i could tell this is nothing's gonna happen here tonight but it wasn't so with the relationship between abraham and our lord as he began to sit there the day began to grow on the sun began to sink down in the sky and as the scavengers began to come out the the birds began to try to pick apart the dead sacrifices the maybe the raccoons begin to wander by or the or the different birds of the earth or the vultures or whatever every time something came upon the scene that began to try to get close to the sacrifice abraham would have to jump up and go and scare the animal away or scare the bird away because he was waiting on the lord right you know if you were to go up and talk to him abraham why are you why are you here what's your purpose here what are you doing you say i am waiting on upon jehovah man i am waiting upon jehovah jehovah has led me here amen i've come here upon revelation i've came here upon revelation from the word of the lord i've come here for a purpose that god has shown me something and i i have done everything that god has shown me to do and now i'm waiting for god to do the things that only god can do i've done as much as i can do and now i have done all that i can do now i am sitting here until god does the things that only god can do amen amen you know he knew his lord he knew jehovah well enough to know that god would keep his promise amen it didn't matter how low the sun began to sink it didn't matter how many birds came to steal the sacrifices amen everything that tried to get in the way of that of that meeting that was getting ready to take place he came and he shoot it away amen he if any he he knew that god was coming to expecting that sacrifice to be there because god had had put it in abraham's mind to give that sacrifice and he knew that if god had put in his mind that there was coming to be a meeting amen that he wanted to have everything ready when that meeting would come so when god showed up all things would be ready because it wasn't that if god comes it was when god comes i want to say it again it wasn't if god would come that's right it was when god would come amen amen so if anything came to to tamper with the sacrifice or to tamper with what was on in the vision of his mind to the anything to come contrary to that he would rise up and shoot away because a promise had been given and he counted god as faithful to the promise amen amen and all of a sudden he got down to the place where even his own body began to fail him amen it says that a horror of great darkness came upon him amen even his own body began to fail him amen even his own bodies like physical death began to come over him or whatever it was began to came over him and he he couldn't even keep himself and all that he had in his mind he'd done all that he could do he came down to the place that he needed jehovah on the scene amen there might have been a point where he wanted jehovah to come on the scene there might have been a thing where he might have said i wish jehovah would show up right now but then it got to the point where not just that he wanted jehovah to show up it's not that he wished jehovah would show up but it came to a point where he needed jehovah to show up amen amen it came to a point where the need had become great amen it says that the horror of great darkness came over his soul came over his mind came over as being it came over his natural eyesight everything about him was shutting down amen and all of a sudden here came a great burning fire that came and walked in the midst of the sacrifice jehovah who had promised to come had now come upon the scene and now has come to receive the sacrifice amen and communion between jehovah and his servant was beginning to take place the one that gave the promise and the one the promise was two were being united one to another we all can come to places in our lives where it'd be nice if jesus showed up on the scene that's right we come to those points in our lives where boy be nice if uh the presence of lord come into the room just now or or if god would give me healing right now that would be neat it would be i i could really use healing for this or healing for that or deliver us from this or deliverance from that but you you and you can and you know the the doubter will come right the spirit of unbelief will come right amen you get up off your chair and you shoot away you shoot away because you know it's not if god will come but you know that it's when god will come right amen because you know that the one that made the promise is able to come and fulfill the promise amen so as long as you're sitting there and you're wishing that god would come you're wishing the promise to be fulfilled amen you know you still have a little bit ways yet amen but when you come to that point in time amen where it's no longer you just wanting god to come but now you need god to come you need god to be on the scene lord ah desperation begins to take hold amen you know mankind is kind of funny you know we we can get kind of lukewarm sometimes we get set in our ways and we don't get desperate enough you know and you and you you hear about the miracles of god and things like that and you think well that's all right you think well yeah i know that god can do those things but there's just no zeal anymore in your heart that's right you come to those point in times like well i it's wednesday night i suppose i probably ought to get to church i get there somewhere close to on time and and you know and you you you just all those things coming in you know all the busyness of life and you and all those things but then you come into the presence of the lord you begin to realize and you begin to set your priorities back straight right in line with the straight and narrow and you think that's right lord i need you that's right oh it's not just that i i want a savior lord i i need a savior amen you know we can think lord i'm so glad that you saved me from my sins and all those things but then there can come great burdensome times in your life for lord i need you to save me from my sins i need a deliverer just now lord i need someone to set me free lord i need healing lord i need deliverance i need to get away from this lukewarmness lord lord lord i want to shake myself and it gets to a point in time where where the sun has gotten low enough amen the enemy has come and tried to steal and sacrifice enough amen your your body is shutting down you know you're you're you feel like your faith is wavering you're like lord god i need you on the scene amen lord i i need a revival lord i don't just need a move i want a movement in the spirit lord i don't just think that oh it'd be nice to have a movement of the spirit right now but it comes down lord i i need you right now that's right that's right and so with those times when god's children begin to get desperate and that desperation begins to rise upon your heart lord yes lord i i don't just want a savior i don't just desire a savior but lord i need a savior lord i need someone to save me lord lord i think about peter how many years he had walked with the lord and seen god do so many neat things but one day when he was on the boat and god asked him to step out on the water he jumped out of the boat with that great zeal of faith and and uh lord just if you bid me to come i'll i'll jump right under that water and i'll come he wanted to come he wanted to jump out of the boat he wanted to walk on the water but when he got out he walked on the water and began to see the storm began to see the waves and all of a sudden he began to sink a little bit you know when we first stepped in the water he was on the water and pretty soon the water was at his ankles and pretty soon he was going down pretty quick and all of a sudden it wasn't just when he was in the boat he wanted to walk on water he said lord if that's you just call out to me and i'll step out of this boat and i want to walk towards you he wanted to walk towards the lord he wanted to walk on water but then as he stepped out of the boat and all of a sudden that fear it's just like when abraham the animals were coming to take the sacrifice the animals were coming the the enemy was coming to take his revelation he had a revelation i can walk on water but now the enemy's coming to steal that revelation away from him fear that's how the enemy operates you know right if you ever notice if you ever watch the enemy he always operates through fear he loves to operate through fear if you watch you if you ever get into a case where you see someone who's demon demon-possessed and the actions the the way they act and things that they do they do those things to cause fear in you because if they cause fear in you then faith has to flee that's right but if faith stays then fear has to flee that's right amen amen always trying to cross fear that's what sickness does is symptoms they come upon you and they try to cause fear so that you don't believe so that sickness can take over amen satan operates through fear because fear is the opposite of faith god operates through faith satan operates through fear amen and so when when peter he he wanted to walk on the water he desired to walk on the water he desired god to call out to him amen but when he got on the water he began to sink he got in the water began to cry now it wasn't just that he wanted to now he needed to that's right he put his all into it and his all wasn't enough and it's just like when the of great darkness was coming upon abraham now he needed the lord it wasn't just that he wanted the lord to show up now he needed the lord to show up amen amen now peter he's standing there he is beginning to sink his lord save me all of us get to those points in our lives where we've been christians long enough and we've seen god do so many things in our lives and all those things but we get to that point where it's still hunger just that we want the lord to show up on the scenes we'd like the lord to show up on the scene but lord i need you right desperation takes hold lord it's you or i perish lord i need you or or i perish amen and until you get to that place you will never see the lord that's right amen you can never meet god face to face until you come to that point until desperation strikes hold amen you can it's uh i don't remember who that was i think it was uh uh forgive me maybe john wesley i don't remember but he no it wasn't john wesley but he was he was he had been preaching all those years and he and he and he uh thought that he was doing the work of the lord decade after decade and uh one day he was went out to pray in the trees and he was knelt down by this tree falling over and he was praying unto the lord and he walked on and he heard some people walking by and he jumped up and acted like he wasn't praying all of a sudden he began to realize lord why am i ashamed of you and a desperation to call of him and he says lord all these years that i've tried to preach for you and all those things and i find myself ashamed that someone would walk by and catch me talking to you and desperation began to strike him well he oh he wanted to preach the gospel now he needed to preach the gospel he wanted to be pray to the lord but now he needed to pray to the lord they began to get desperate began to cry out amen and god came down and met him amen and set his soul on fire amen from the lord it's like when john wesley priest all over england then he came over to the united states and and his ministry here began to fail and fail and fail and he says lord i came here to to to the minister to the to the to the natives lord but i came here to convert the natives well lord who's going to convert me he says lord i need you and he wanted to serve the lord but now he needed to serve the lord he wanted to meet the lord but now he needed to serve the lord amen and that's when god came down and met him amen so is it so with every christian you can think you can mentally agree with this word you can read this bible you can grow up in the church you can think it's all right you know you can you can kind of mentally agree with it but there's got to come a time in your life hey man where you've you've the sacrifice has laid there so long amen you've you've wanted the sacrifice to be received you've wanted god to show up on the scene in your life you've desired those things you've witnessed about god you've talked about god you've you you've all done all those things but and every time the enemy comes to take your revelation away you shoot away you shoot away but there comes a time of desperation where he's like lord i've wanted you for so long but lord now wanting you is not long enough lord i need you amen amen lord i'm desperate for you amen lord it's you or i perish father lord i i can't go on this way any longer father lord i need you right now lord i need you to save me from my sins lord i need you to give me the holy ghost lord i need to walk in perfection with you lord i need to be whatever it is that you had on your mind when you were dying upon that cross amen that's what i come to be lord i didn't come here to be a lukewarm servant and let me tell you we get to be in that condition then the promise is unto you amen the promise is unto you amen that's what he said for the promise is unto you to your children to them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call amen the promise is unto you what is the promise it's the promise that the spirit of the living god that created the heavens and the earth amen amen that rose you up here in the natural in the natural you've risen up in the natural you've done things that the animal race cannot do but then there comes a time in your life to receive the spirit of living god and to do the things that mankind cannot do amen to do a body change to leave this world amen to amen to be a joint heirs with christ amen to realize that you are not just an animal amen but you are a son or a daughter of the living god that's right amen let's turn over to the book of isaiah it's either isaiah 52 or 60. look here we'll start with isaiah 52 it starts out in verse 1. it starts out really strong it says awake awake wake yourself up this is jehovah speaking to his church he says wake up put on your strength o zion put on your beautiful garments o jerusalem the holy city now zion should have already had their beautiful garments on amen they should have already been awake amen they should have they should have already already had their strength on them but somehow those things that fled away from he says for henceforth shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and unclean he says i think it gets really strong in verse three says shake yourself from the dust arise stand up sit down oh jerusalem loose yourself from the bands of your neck these folks were in bondage oh captive daughter of zion now let me tell you they were never designed to be like that for thus saith the lord now here's the prophet speaking for thus saith lord that means this thing is true you have sold yourself for nothing you sold yourself for not but you should be redeemed without money think about us saints we are born to be children sons and daughters of the living god we are born we we we know that we've done things that the dogs can't do we do things that the lion can't do we in the natural we have mankind has conquered this world amen right in the natural mankind is leaving this world to go and conquer other worlds we've done those things in the natural not considering that jehovah the lord god almighty is the one that gave us those abilities and we've sold ourselves to to the the mankind has sold themselves to go back to do the things that the animals are doing amen to be natural brute beasts as the bible says to do wicked and evil things amen not realizing that god called us to come up higher out of those things amen and that's where jehovah says stand up sit down shake yourself wake up remove yourself from your bondage that satan is trying to put you upon you amen you sold yourself for nothing but let me tell you i'll come i'll redeem you without price amen without money even without price let's go over to isaiah 60. jehovah again speaking to the church in verse 1 he says arise shine for thy light has come and the glory of the lord has risen upon thee that's speaking about us saints for behold darkness shall cover the earth has it happened is it true amen and gross darkness the people amen but the lord shall arise upon who upon thee amen oh he's not going to rise upon everybody amen but arise shine the lord is shining upon who is upon his bride amen amen the lord but the lord shall arise now gross darkness will be upon the people in general but the lord will arise and shine upon you where will his glory be seen and his glory shall be seen upon thee for the promise is unto you what's his glory when his spirit of the living god comes down upon you amen and you rise and shake yourself you don't live like the animal race amen but you rise up and become a son or daughter of the living god amen why knowing that our lord is soon to come we don't want a rapture we need a rapture amen we're not just wishing the rapture would come amen but we need a rapture amen gross darkness is coming upon this world amen we need something that'll get us up out of here amen amen and the glory of the lord shall be seen upon thee for the promise is unto you we need it it's come to a point in our lives where we don't just want these things we don't just they're not just so well i know god can do those things i know that god is able to deliver i know that god is able to set free but we need god to set us free we need to be to be those overcoming christians that god prophesied would be here in the last days we're desperate we've we we're standing in the boat and we wanted lord call us out lord we'll we'll walk towards you but it's when you begin to sink the desperation strikes lord save me one quick cry one quick cry to the lord jesus christ brought jesus i don't know how far away he was maybe 10 feet maybe 100 feet away i don't know was but as soon as that one quick cry left peter's lips lord save me jesus was right there pulling him up by the hand amen and we are at that stage amen we need the lord amen we we've we've been christians long enough amen desperation must take hold rise up shake yourself wake yourself up don't just slumber don't just sleep but but but stand up we're living in the last days amen and this this last days is a lukewarm age that's just here to lull you to sleep a horror of great darkness will come over you and over you but rise up the bible says shake yourself gross darkness will be upon the people but light is to shine upon you amen to come and come between the sacrifice that you've laid there amen and as as darkness begins to creep and come over you as you begin to die out in lukewarmness that you also that's when you need god the most amen and that's when he rises and comes upon the scene to save you from your lukewarmness to deliver you from laodicea amen to rise you up to be that overcomer that was prophesied to be here in the last days we know that this problem is promised that there would be overcomers in this day amen we've come to fulfill that promise for the promise is unto us the promise is unto you six words before the promise is unto you it has to be it has to happen we know that the one who gave the promise we've looked at him we've considered him we've read about him we've learned since the bible stories we heard when we were little now we've grown up and we've grown old and we and we we've heard all the bible stories we've heard all the testimonies we've heard of the healings we've heard of the miracles we've heard of the stories we've heard all those things but now but now all those things we've know we've known enough about the promise giver to know that he is right he is true and he is able to fulfill a promise but what about us amen that's right now that we've judged him righteous now that we've judged him abel now that we've judged him to be the one that is able to give the promise now judge ourselves are we able to receive the promise and consider is that verse directed at you or not and if it is directed to you then rise up wake yourself shake yourself don't slumber and don't sleep remember they are all slumbering sleeping in matthew 25. amen they all had lamps they all had oil on their lamps amen they all were given a job there was 10 virgins they are given a job a duty amen their job was shine light from here all the way to the wedding they were given a lamp they were given oil in their lamp amen some were wise and some were foolish amen some considered that it was very possible that if the lord would delay his coming that if during the the time of delay that they didn't actually know what time he would come and there was a possibility that he might come very very late in the hour and that that that they didn't know at what time they would be called to perform their duty amen but they did know one thing the wise did that whatever time that he called for them to perform their duty that at that time they wanted to be able to perform what their duties said they should do amen amen so those that were wise considered that not only am i going to take my lamp amen not only am i going to take the oil in my lamp but i need to have a way that if the oil in my lamp begins to get a little bit low that i should have another source over here that i could replenish my lamp should it begin to get low the foolish do not consider such a thing and as they all begin to slumber and sleep as the day of laodicea began to wear on as the last days began to become later and later and later and the world became get darker and darker that their lamps began to sputter and go out and they begin to get tired and sleepy and begin to get lukewarm maybe a little bit begin to forget about their sacrifice a horror of great sleep began to come over them all over again same story repeated again and again and again were people that first they wanted to perform a service they wanted to be the wise virgins they wanted to shine light all the way to the wedding but it's when that cry came this time not from them like not from peter but now the cry is coming from the bridegroom himself from the from the messenger arise wake yourself up shake yourself the time has come the the the wedding of the most high god amen the wedding the the bridegroom and the time for the wedding has come let all those that are called rise up shut grab your light amen grab your lamp thy word o lord is a lamp unto my feet is a light unto your path grab your lamp and shine it all the way to the bright until the to the wedding to the bridegroom and and the foolish virgin she gets up she gets her bible out and you know it just i i know this is the word of the lord but it just seems like the spirit just doesn't seem to work upon it anymore i know what god says in the word but i just i just can't seem to get the the spirit of the living god to enter into my worship anymore to enter into the gospel anymore i can't take a promise of god and hold on to it the firm of faith anymore and desperation began to strike the foolish virgin amen she began to realize that the word wouldn't work for her anymore it wasn't that she didn't have the lamp it's whether she didn't have the spirit of living god upon the lamp she had the word but she didn't have any spirit to make the word work amen she knew what her duty was to shine light all the way to the wedding but when the time of the wedding came her lamp would no longer work the wise virgins found themselves in a similar situation but one thing they didn't know yes they've been slumbering yes they've been sleeping amen yes the horror of great darkness came upon them amen yes they are beginning to uh thing but like peter one thing they did know is they knew the lord amen they knew their source amen they knew that the where their oil came from they knew they had him he wasn't far off way off over there or way off over there but they had a well-beaten path to the most high god lord there's been times in my life where i wanted you but lord right now i need you lord amen i need you lord save me refill my lamp lord to deliver me from this dark laodicea father let me burn and fervor once more for you lord lord let me rise shine for my light has come lord let it be unto me wake up shake yourself let the glory of the lord rise upon you amen it's the for the promise is unto you if you be that wise virgin amen why because the bridegroom is coming amen trim your lamps get yourself ready find out do you have that holy ghost that you claim to have or not amen there's times when we wanted the holy ghost to be in our servants but now it's coming to a time lord we need you amen lord we we've talked about you long enough but lord now we need you face to face lord lord help me lord lord deliver me lord i know that we've testified long enough that you'll save me from my sins but lord i need you to save me from my sins lord let it be unto me according to thy word lord amen for the promise is unto you so let us rise up and receive our promise amen amen amen just here in a closing from the book of ephesians arise shine for the light has come ephesians 5. verse 11 says and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather approve them don't do it don't be around it don't join in with it don't even have fellowship with those unfruitful works if darkness is working stay away from it but rather stand up and say that's wrong or prove it verse 12 for is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret you know we can be guilty of reading the news too much talking about the wicked things too much and not focusing on the righteous things you know i mean we can talk it's easy to talk about the things that are wrong but we are we talking about things that are right verse 13 but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light verse 14 this is one i wanted to get to he says wherefore he saith awake thou the sleepless and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise thinking about where you're at consider your ways isaiah said redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is and be not drunk with wine where in excess but be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves and psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart with to the lord giving thanks always for all things unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ amen why because the promise is unto us amen we won't be found ourselves worthy of the gospel that we preach amen let's just stand amen rise shine for the glory of the lord has risen upon you amen upon you the light of god is shining amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer heavenly father we just want to thank you lord for just a simple message lord we know that you have promised these things to us lord and we want to be faithful father lord with the vessel that you have given us lord you've given us your word father the lord many have your word and father many times we've wanted you to show up on the scene but lord in these days lord we need you in our lives lord desperation let us strike hold father that we can rise up sit down shake ourselves wake up lord for the glory of the lord shall be shining upon us in this day and lord for why because the lord you said that the promise was unto us and lord i pray let it be unto us as mary said according to thy word lord i pray for everybody here under the sound of my voice father lord that this word would find them father in desperation seeking you father and finding you because the promised lord that you have given us let's rise up above just be
