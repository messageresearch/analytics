[41:23] ii corinthians
[41:27] i'm gonna read just a different version

[41:31] so it'll be a little different from what
[41:33] the way it's written in your word but i
[41:36] really want you to follow that
[41:37] let's just read there first
[41:39] thanks
[41:41] that's not it
[41:43] the first chapter three through four
[41:49] second corinthians
[41:54] i'll read it blessed be the god and
[41:55] father by lord jesus christ
[41:58] the father of mercies
[42:01] and the god of all comfort
[42:04] he comforts us
[42:05] in all our afflictions
[42:08] so that we may be able to comfort those
[42:12] who are in any kind of affliction
[42:15] through the comfort
[42:17] we ourselves
[42:19] receive from god
[42:22] but let's read it
[42:24] as in the king james be blessed be god
[42:28] even the father of our lord jesus christ
[42:31] the father of mercy
[42:33] and the god of all comfort i like that
[42:36] who comforted us
[42:38] in all our tribulation
[42:40] that we may be able to comfort them
[42:44] which are in any trouble
[42:46] by the comfort wherewith we ourselves
[42:49] are comforted
[42:51] of god
[42:53] let us pray
[42:55] our heavenly father we thank you for
[42:57] your grace and your mercy we thank you
[42:59] for being so good to us
[43:02] lord
[43:03] we thank you father for your
[43:05] blood
[43:06] that cleansing power that cleanses us
[43:08] from all unrighteousness and
[43:11] we thank you for your amazing grace
[43:14] lord because it's your grace that we're
[43:16] able to stand
[43:17] here uh this evening we thank you for
[43:20] those who have come out
[43:22] uh to hear the word of god i pray father
[43:24] god that it would be a blessing to each
[43:26] and every hearer that when they leave
[43:29] here there will also be a doer give us
[43:31] grace
[43:32] in your lovely name jesus christ as we
[43:34] worship you in this house amen
[43:38] you may be seated
[43:45] i entitled this message
[43:48] still tying in with the godhead but i
[43:51] wanted to give it a little difference
[43:54] and i titled it god above us
[43:57] god with us
[43:59] and god in us
[44:03] many people are looking for the former
[44:06] and the latter rain and they fail to see
[44:08] that
[44:10] the forward and that rain has come
[44:13] the teaching reigns has come through the
[44:15] prophet of malachi 4
[44:19] and the reign of god has come to bring
[44:22] us to maturity
[44:24] even in the message the uncertain sound
[44:26] brother branham says thou art here today
[44:30] you're here for the closing hour
[44:33] for even greater blessings for the
[44:36] former and latter reign should come
[44:38] together
[44:40] and when we look at this we understand
[44:43] that there got to be a greater power
[44:45] a greater anointing
[44:47] a greater
[44:48] manifestation now understand this
[44:52] it will not be a lot of people
[44:54] as we know it will be a small group of
[44:56] people those who can
[44:59] as we said last week
[45:01] not only hear the word but understand
[45:04] your position
[45:05] where you're standing in this message
[45:08] we know by god's grace that
[45:11] all our comforts come from god
[45:14] uh the anointing of god is what it has
[45:17] always been
[45:18] we found out that even adam and eve was
[45:21] just mere men mere flesh
[45:24] without the anointing of god
[45:26] they were able to die they were able to
[45:28] feel pain they were able to get sick
[45:30] they were able to do all of these things
[45:32] because the glory of god had separated
[45:35] itself himself from them
[45:38] now we know by god's grace that the
[45:39] bible tells us that the letter killeth
[45:42] but the spirit of god gives life
[45:44] the spirit of god is what we call the
[45:46] holy ghost it is the one that gives us
[45:48] life it is it's the only true and living
[45:51] god
[45:52] but one thing i fail i see that uh
[45:55] you know the the the experience that i
[45:58] had
[45:59] uh and like i said it was personally my
[46:01] dream and i told it as a dream
[46:04] but in this i saw the explosion or the
[46:07] unveiling of god in such a way i had
[46:10] never seen it before
[46:12] and i saw things that were being created
[46:14] things that were moving by the way of
[46:16] waves and
[46:18] rainbow colors and things of that nature
[46:20] and it had no ending
[46:22] um
[46:23] i just knew and i couldn't explain it i
[46:26] still cannot explain it but i saw how
[46:29] one word of god one word and this is
[46:31] what why jesus said even to his
[46:34] disciples if you say to this mountain be
[46:38] thou move
[46:39] the mountain has to move now understand
[46:42] you this is not human effort this is not
[46:45] a natural man in his natural mind trying
[46:48] to make a mountain move but this is god
[46:51] in the man
[46:52] that has the capacity and the capability
[46:55] to make the mountain move
[46:58] so we know we can't do nothing without
[47:00] him is that right but the bible says
[47:02] that he is the branch and we're the vine
[47:04] and of course the vine can't do nothing
[47:06] without the branch
[47:08] so you know you know you and i
[47:09] understand that if if that be true then
[47:12] we need we need to do something about
[47:15] our condition
[47:16] i believe with all my heart that we're
[47:18] living in the last days and i believe
[47:20] that we don't have much time left
[47:23] even though it seems like things are
[47:24] going so called well and like nothing is
[47:27] going to happen but one thing i know for
[47:30] certain that you and i can stand and see
[47:34] prophecy being fulfilled
[47:36] amen by modern events
[47:39] and we cannot deny if that be true then
[47:42] that means everything else that has been
[47:44] spoken is true
[47:46] and i don't think people get it i don't
[47:49] think we get we're getting what this
[47:52] thing means to us listen how terrible it
[47:54] will be
[47:56] knowing that we have heard this message
[47:59] and have been able to embrace brace it
[48:01] even if it was just intellectual think
[48:04] about all of the joy and and things that
[48:06] it has brought to us
[48:08] but even paul said you can understand
[48:10] all mysteries but without love it
[48:13] profits nothing
[48:14] and my my thought is
[48:16] who's pressing
[48:18] who's moving forward uh into this divine
[48:22] love that god has now brought down to us
[48:25] amen to to be partakers of we call it
[48:28] the divine nature according to peter
[48:30] because we run understand that god is a
[48:33] manifold he's manifold he's manifold
[48:36] even in his wisdom
[48:38] and you and i must understand that the
[48:40] natural man cannot comprehend
[48:42] what god is doing so in order for us to
[48:45] understand him we must be born again we
[48:49] must have the anointing of god on the
[48:51] inside of us to understand what is
[48:53] actually happening now because you say
[48:56] well wait wait wait a minute brother let
[48:57] me tell you something there were so many
[49:00] people that was with william branham
[49:01] when he was here as as a malachi 4
[49:04] messenger and they still didn't get it
[49:06] they still didn't understand what he was
[49:08] saying because many of them did not have
[49:10] the holy ghost like he said
[49:13] without it you can't understand it not
[49:16] even see the kingdom of god
[49:18] second corinthians 3 2-5 says ye are
[49:21] epistles
[49:22] written in our heart
[49:24] known and read of all men
[49:27] for as much as ye are manifestly
[49:31] declared to be the epistles of christ
[49:34] now understand that statement
[49:37] manifestly declared that means i can see
[49:40] it
[49:42] it's not something i have to strain at
[49:45] a strain with it's visible
[49:48] that there has been a change in you
[49:51] and when i see you i see the word
[49:54] expressed basically that's what paul was
[49:56] saying
[49:58] written not with ink
[50:00] but with the spirit of the living god
[50:04] not in tables of stone but in fleshly
[50:07] tables of the heart
[50:10] and such trust
[50:12] have we through christ to godward
[50:15] not that we are sufficient here it is of
[50:18] ourselves to think anything as of
[50:21] ourselves but our sufficiency
[50:26] is of god
[50:27] can i say it like this our sufficiency
[50:30] is of the holy ghost
[50:34] listen we must understand that every
[50:37] step we make every every move we make
[50:40] every
[50:41] whatever we got to understand that it is
[50:44] god who's leading
[50:45] he's above all
[50:47] he's through all
[50:49] he's in all
[50:50] he's everywhere he knows everything
[50:54] right there is nothing
[50:56] that catches god by surprise
[51:00] and so we're moving by the anointing of
[51:03] god
[51:04] some of us have heard the story of the
[51:06] little possum that was very sick perhaps
[51:10] got bitten by a dog or whatever but this
[51:13] possum amen comes along
[51:15] and he moves down on the prophet street
[51:18] skipping four houses coming to the fifth
[51:22] now you know the possum can't count
[51:25] but somehow through the leadership of
[51:27] god he brought him to the fifth house
[51:29] which was the letter of faith
[51:31] f-a-i-t-h-h
[51:33] and and of course jesus right and here
[51:36] was the prophet of god amen concern
[51:38] about this prophet this opossum because
[51:41] it had little babies i'm gonna hurry up
[51:43] but my point is here was a brute beast a
[51:46] little animal
[51:47] that was able to be led by god
[51:50] and had a revelation
[51:52] that this man could heal her
[51:55] she only not only did she have the
[51:57] revelation or the understanding i don't
[51:59] understand it but one thing for certain
[52:02] when the prophet of god prayed for her
[52:04] she was near death
[52:07] right he said when when god rebuked him
[52:09] says listen you talked about that woman
[52:11] who was ill-famed and did did bring her
[52:14] baby to a death and and you called her a
[52:16] bad name you said she wasn't a real
[52:18] mother and yet you bragged on the possum
[52:20] but you wouldn't even pray for it now
[52:22] how simple that is but to the natural
[52:25] mind why would you pray for a possum
[52:29] but god comes along and rebukes himself
[52:32] but she's been like a lady and she's
[52:34] waiting on her turn to be prayed for
[52:37] i know this sound fatigue fictitious but
[52:41] it's a reality it happened
[52:43] he prayed for her and he said when he
[52:45] prayed for her and then this little
[52:47] opossum gathered up her babies and
[52:49] walked across the street looked back to
[52:51] say thank you sir
[52:54] even the opossum
[52:56] you know had manners and respect for the
[52:58] living god yet and still we find people
[53:02] that come to church they come to church
[53:04] on religious basis and not by a way of
[53:07] experience and so they disrespect god
[53:09] because they don't have god in them to
[53:11] know how how to respect him
[53:13] this is not a way of law
[53:15] this is a way of grace
[53:18] and understand grace brings you to the
[53:20] place to do what god wants you to do
[53:23] god doesn't expel you know the right
[53:26] things from you know the right things
[53:28] has been given to you
[53:30] and grace give you the ability to do the
[53:33] right things
[53:36] shall we continue in sin that grace may
[53:38] abound he said god forbid
[53:43] first corinth now excuse me colossians 1
[53:45] uh i'm sorry first option colossians 1
[53:48] 27-29 says god wanted to make known
[53:52] among the gentiles the glorious wealth
[53:54] of this mystery which is christ in you
[53:58] the hope of glory and we're looking with
[54:00] we're saying christ in us christ in us
[54:04] but where is the glory
[54:08] where is the display where is the
[54:10] manifestation of god in you i'm talking
[54:13] to everybody in here
[54:15] these signs shall follow them that
[54:17] believe
[54:19] it is true and you ought to have some
[54:21] kind of experience amen not 10 years ago
[54:24] but some kind of experience that you
[54:26] could say oh he did this for me every
[54:28] day is a praise
[54:31] we proclaim him
[54:33] warning and teaching everyone with all
[54:35] wisdom so that we may present everyone
[54:39] mature in christ
[54:42] he said i labor for this
[54:44] striving with the strength that works
[54:46] powerfully in me paul says listen
[54:49] the only way i can do it i labor to see
[54:52] the saints of god come to maturity
[54:54] that's what i'm doing i'm laboring to
[54:57] see that this church come to maturity
[55:01] but listen you gotta want it
[55:04] you gotta wanna grow up
[55:07] it has to be your will not mine
[55:10] god's will in you will will you to do it
[55:15] listen and and i look at these things
[55:17] and i says god of the christ in you we
[55:20] got to see him
[55:21] we can't hardly see him in worship when
[55:24] i say that we come to church and you
[55:25] know how people do they they so
[55:27] listen they're not even anointed
[55:30] not with god anyway
[55:32] they come into church and they just dead
[55:35] no anointing
[55:37] haven't prayed
[55:38] they come in and you know they sit like
[55:40] they're in a classroom
[55:42] or worse
[55:43] and then they expect god
[55:45] to answer prayer
[55:47] enter his courts with thanksgiving
[55:50] into his gates with praise if you don't
[55:53] come that way
[55:55] you've got the wrong protocol
[56:00] and
[56:01] that sounds like a rebuke and i'm hoping
[56:03] that this will reach some who are not
[56:04] here
[56:06] listen love conquers all he didn't say
[56:08] that for nothing and i'm not talking
[56:10] about filio love i'm talking about agape
[56:13] love
[56:16] and when we don't listen and we don't
[56:18] grasp god when we don't
[56:20] how can i say it enter into his worship
[56:23] you say well what do you mean
[56:24] that woman that came to simon house
[56:27] wasn't even invited to come
[56:29] she came to simon's house saw jesus over
[56:32] there when nobody else was worshiping
[56:34] him she came and she worshipped
[56:38] she didn't even have to ask him for
[56:40] anything you don't understand many
[56:42] people don't understand the power of
[56:44] worship
[56:47] the bible said that god himself
[56:49] inhabits the praise of his people that's
[56:52] why you don't have the joy that's why
[56:54] you don't have the peace that's why you
[56:56] don't rest because you're not coming to
[56:58] him in the right way
[57:00] and the reason being is that so many
[57:02] people have this intellectual
[57:04] understanding of god and they've never
[57:06] gotten it down here
[57:10] have mercy on us lord
[57:12] that's what i'm targeting
[57:14] not your mind
[57:15] amen your heart
[57:19] what's in your heart
[57:23] love conquers everything
[57:25] john 4 21 23 says jesus said unto her
[57:28] woman believe me
[57:30] the hour cometh when ye shall neither in
[57:33] this mountain nor yet at jerusalem
[57:36] worship the father in other words we're
[57:38] doing away with all the denominations
[57:40] and organizations and all that stuff all
[57:42] the isms and schism you're not gonna
[57:44] worship there
[57:47] that's not where you worship god in this
[57:49] hour it ain't oh i come to church i come
[57:51] to higher ground that's not where you
[57:53] worship
[57:55] you worship him in spirit and truth
[57:58] where in the house of god
[58:02] this is where worship comes from and
[58:05] when the worship is all right it's going
[58:07] good on the inside it explodes to the
[58:09] outside
[58:11] listen people you don't have to tell
[58:13] people you're a christian when you got
[58:14] worship going on
[58:18] they can see and feel the vibrations
[58:22] jesus said unto her woman believeth me
[58:24] the hour cometh when you should neither
[58:26] in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem
[58:29] worship the father
[58:31] ye worship ye worship ye know not what
[58:35] we know what we worship for our for
[58:37] salvation is of the jews and brother and
[58:39] then he goes on to say but the hour
[58:41] cometh and now i'll say that and now is
[58:44] with the true worship person listen to
[58:46] what he's saying
[58:48] the true worshipers
[58:50] shall worship the father in spirit and
[58:53] in truth
[58:55] for the father seek is such to worship
[58:58] him
[58:59] now i understand that look that spirit
[59:01] is is a lower case but he's not talking
[59:04] about human spirit
[59:07] he's talking about holy spirit
[59:09] that's the only way you can worship god
[59:12] is by and through the power of the holy
[59:14] spirit
[59:16] but what we fail to see is a christian
[59:18] and i i i look at this thing and i says
[59:20] no matter how much you cry out no matter
[59:22] how much you plea it's just like in the
[59:24] days of noah only eight souls were saved
[59:27] and you know
[59:28] uh you know enoch was the only one of
[59:30] his age
[59:32] and and the bible said as it was in that
[59:34] day so shall it be and yet we we we as
[59:38] preachers we have this hope and this
[59:40] expectation that we're going to have a
[59:42] church full of bride people ready and
[59:46] you know ah just it's gonna be that
[59:49] it ain't
[59:50] it's not
[59:53] even in this assembly it's gonna be a
[59:55] few
[59:56] i don't know who they are
[59:58] but i'm sure
[1:00:00] they know
[1:00:03] the uncertainty brethren preached a
[1:00:05] message the uncertain sound
[1:00:08] he said the principle of christianity
[1:00:11] is the condition
[1:00:13] of the heart towards god
[1:00:17] and that's the thing that we like to
[1:00:20] concentrate on
[1:00:21] is to know a brother not by the church
[1:00:24] he belongs to or how he wear his clothes
[1:00:28] but what he is in his heart
[1:00:32] hello somebody
[1:00:35] and you and i must understand that we
[1:00:37] have a duty
[1:00:39] and that duty is to kill yourself every
[1:00:41] day
[1:00:43] i'm not talking about physically killing
[1:00:45] yourself or some kind of suicidal thing
[1:00:47] i have to make sure i
[1:00:50] explain that especially with somebody on
[1:00:52] the youtube that said that man preaching
[1:00:54] suicide you know and you must understand
[1:00:56] we're not talking about natural death
[1:00:58] we're talking about spiritual dying to
[1:01:00] yourself
[1:01:02] being put to death all day long that's
[1:01:04] what paul said he said we're counting
[1:01:06] the sheep for the slaughter
[1:01:08] is that right he said and we suffer
[1:01:11] throughout the day all day long
[1:01:15] but then again he says who
[1:01:17] shall separate us
[1:01:18] from the love of christ shall
[1:01:20] tribulation or distress or persecution
[1:01:23] or famine or nakedness apparel or sword
[1:01:26] as it is written for thy sake we are
[1:01:28] killed all the day long we are accounted
[1:01:31] as sheep for the slaughter and i don't
[1:01:34] know why everybody feel like in this age
[1:01:37] we're supposed to be always hallelujah
[1:01:39] in it hey you got to understand you got
[1:01:42] to suffer
[1:01:46] if you read in the church age
[1:01:49] when jesus says i have seen your
[1:01:52] patience
[1:01:54] he's not like talking about patience
[1:01:58] and waiting on the bus
[1:02:02] or patience and waiting on the plane
[1:02:06] he says i see your patience
[1:02:08] in your suffering
[1:02:11] because you have suffered
[1:02:13] and suffered
[1:02:15] and suffered
[1:02:17] and i haven't delivered you yet but your
[1:02:20] patience says
[1:02:21] i'm going to wait on god
[1:02:23] and i'm going to wait for god
[1:02:27] and all of that suffering like job said
[1:02:30] i know my change is coming
[1:02:33] see that's the kind of patient god wants
[1:02:35] oh god hurry up hurry up no we all feel
[1:02:38] like that sometime but that's not god
[1:02:42] god is molding us and making us he's a
[1:02:44] perfectionist
[1:02:47] he takes his time to deliver us
[1:02:50] he takes his time to make us
[1:02:53] and guess what he makes no mistakes
[1:02:57] he makes none not one
[1:03:00] and you and i you and i we are his
[1:03:02] masterpieces
[1:03:06] when nobody else can see the life in us
[1:03:08] he sees it
[1:03:11] paul says for thy sake we are killed all
[1:03:14] the day long we are counting the sheep
[1:03:16] for the slaughter let me tell y'all
[1:03:18] something especially you young people if
[1:03:19] you really get on the board if you
[1:03:22] really get in your heart and mind i'm
[1:03:24] gonna serve god with all my heart you'll
[1:03:27] find out
[1:03:28] that you'll be one in a million
[1:03:32] amongst your own
[1:03:34] because i've had people who supposed to
[1:03:37] be christian of the same faith say you
[1:03:39] know what you just too religious
[1:03:43] you know there was a time in my life you
[1:03:45] know when i used to sneeze i said lord
[1:03:47] excuse me
[1:03:51] and you know what i i missed those times
[1:03:54] but i was rebuked
[1:03:56] and i allowed those people to stop me
[1:04:00] and i realized now they were wrong
[1:04:06] listen he says nay and all these things
[1:04:09] we are more than conquerors through him
[1:04:11] that love us and i'm going to get
[1:04:12] something here tonight because i want
[1:04:14] you to understand there is a line that
[1:04:17] people can cross and can't come back
[1:04:19] over
[1:04:21] may god have mercy on us with all grace
[1:04:24] great it is grace
[1:04:26] but when god can't get you to move by
[1:04:28] grace
[1:04:30] he brings the law
[1:04:34] paul said i am persuaded that neither
[1:04:36] death nor life nor angels nor
[1:04:38] principalities not power nor things
[1:04:40] present nor things to come why is he
[1:04:42] saying that paul is not saying my
[1:04:45] ability is going to get me there no paul
[1:04:47] is saying because i have god on the
[1:04:50] inside
[1:04:53] nothing can separate me
[1:04:55] why
[1:04:57] because jesus said
[1:04:59] i'll never leave you
[1:05:01] nor will i forsake you
[1:05:04] i will always be with you
[1:05:06] that's the reason why
[1:05:08] that's the reason why is because once
[1:05:10] you unite with christ nothing can stop
[1:05:13] you no grave
[1:05:15] no devil
[1:05:17] no demon
[1:05:18] no trial
[1:05:20] nothing can stop you listen in all the
[1:05:23] years that i've been saved in a
[1:05:25] christian i have never had a desire to
[1:05:27] turn back on god ever
[1:05:30] it never came to my mind
[1:05:33] because once you get that experience
[1:05:35] that real experience it doesn't come
[1:05:38] you falter
[1:05:39] you come short you stumble you fall but
[1:05:43] you never think about leaving him
[1:05:46] where would you go anyway
[1:05:50] ain't nobody gonna love you like jesus
[1:05:52] i'm telling you
[1:05:54] i mean he could be a millionaire she
[1:05:55] could be a millionaire she'll never love
[1:05:58] you like jesus
[1:06:01] you and i must understand we're not we
[1:06:03] have not we've not been ordained to be
[1:06:05] hypocrites
[1:06:06] huh you say what is a hypocrite a
[1:06:09] hypocrite is a person who puts on false
[1:06:11] appearances
[1:06:13] of virtue
[1:06:14] or religion
[1:06:16] and god knows we've got a lot of it
[1:06:18] listen what brother adam said he said
[1:06:20] god never made you just to work
[1:06:22] and come home and love your children
[1:06:25] that's all good enough
[1:06:27] god made you to work god made you to
[1:06:30] come home love your children love your
[1:06:32] wife love your wife to be loyal and love
[1:06:35] her husband
[1:06:36] the children love their fathers and
[1:06:38] mothers that's all good but god made you
[1:06:42] that's just a background for something
[1:06:44] that god made you to do god made you to
[1:06:47] be a worshiper
[1:06:50] somebody missing that one
[1:06:54] god made you to be a worshiper a
[1:06:57] worshiper of him
[1:07:00] he said you'll worship something
[1:07:03] regardless of what it is
[1:07:05] you'll worship your wife your worship
[1:07:07] your children your worship anything your
[1:07:10] automobile your worship pleasure you'll
[1:07:13] worship something because it's a mankind
[1:07:16] it's in mankind to worship now we want
[1:07:20] to know
[1:07:21] what we worship
[1:07:23] what are you worshiping tonight
[1:07:27] you need to examine yourself to see
[1:07:29] where you're standing
[1:07:32] your revelation what are you worshiping
[1:07:40] the greatest way to worship god is to be
[1:07:43] in his image
[1:07:47] second corinthians 1 20 says for every
[1:07:49] one of god's promises is yes
[1:07:52] in him therefore through him we also say
[1:07:55] amen
[1:07:56] to the glory of god
[1:07:58] now it is god who strengthens us
[1:08:00] together with you in christ and who has
[1:08:04] anoin this is what i was saying to the
[1:08:06] church the other day
[1:08:08] we need you
[1:08:09] god needs you
[1:08:11] and we think where did they hear it
[1:08:16] did they understand
[1:08:18] the bible said we're united together
[1:08:21] we're we're living stones
[1:08:24] fitted together and when people are
[1:08:26] missing it literally weakens the body
[1:08:30] and gives satan right
[1:08:33] to do what he needs to do
[1:08:36] don't tell me people with the holy ghost
[1:08:38] is not being led to come to church
[1:08:41] when god said through the prophet that
[1:08:43] you know a true born again believer
[1:08:45] can't hardly wait to those doors are
[1:08:47] open
[1:08:49] what's wrong with the people it's a lack
[1:08:52] of conversion
[1:08:55] lord help us they may have him here but
[1:08:58] we need him here this is the throne room
[1:09:00] of god this is the throne room of god
[1:09:05] jesus said to the pharisees he says why
[1:09:06] are you hypocrites how can you speak
[1:09:09] good and here i'm coming when they uh
[1:09:12] was called calling him good master and
[1:09:14] so forth you know how people do oh god
[1:09:16] bless you brother brother we appreciate
[1:09:18] you being our pastor oh you just and in
[1:09:20] their minds they're thinking something
[1:09:21] else
[1:09:23] not everybody
[1:09:24] but you know some people it's just
[1:09:26] religious
[1:09:32] you love the lord out of the abundance
[1:09:34] of the heart speaketh the lips and in
[1:09:37] your heart you hate me he says
[1:09:39] and in in your lips you call me good
[1:09:42] master he says and you hypocrites that's
[1:09:44] what jesus said in your heart he knew
[1:09:47] those that hated him and yet they're
[1:09:49] calling him good master
[1:09:51] in that in that something
[1:09:54] you can tell the way people look at you
[1:09:56] sometimes especially in service
[1:09:58] sometimes they look at you like they
[1:09:59] could kill you
[1:10:01] they don't even know
[1:10:02] that the spirit that's whatever working
[1:10:04] in them is expressing itself on their
[1:10:06] faces
[1:10:09] that's real
[1:10:14] listen what he says see your soul is
[1:10:17] thinking one thing
[1:10:18] and you're speaking with your lips
[1:10:20] another thing what a case what a
[1:10:23] hypocrite a horrible thing he says what
[1:10:26] a deceitful thing is a hypocrite for out
[1:10:28] of their mind they say one thing and
[1:10:31] when their souls say another thing
[1:10:34] oh he's coming down to something
[1:10:36] let me tell you something every
[1:10:37] hypocritical
[1:10:38] move we make everything we do wrong
[1:10:41] excuse me if it doesn't if we don't make
[1:10:43] it right guess what's going to happen
[1:10:45] at the end of the day
[1:10:48] it's going to catch up with you
[1:10:52] i got a quote here in just a moment
[1:10:54] what am i trying to do stir up the minds
[1:10:58] we were just talking the other day about
[1:11:00] that young couple amen in in ohio that
[1:11:03] just got married and and then the house
[1:11:05] exploded and they didn't go to bed
[1:11:07] thinking we're gonna die tonight
[1:11:10] we don't know we have no idea when god
[1:11:14] is going to call that number but guess
[1:11:15] what
[1:11:17] if you're not right when you fall you
[1:11:18] won't be right
[1:11:21] because however the tree falls that's
[1:11:23] how it lays
[1:11:25] the target is getting the soul converted
[1:11:28] you know it's good i love the shouting i
[1:11:30] love the dancing and you know that's the
[1:11:32] thing that made me say something is
[1:11:35] wrong
[1:11:36] when i was in the apostolic church i
[1:11:38] spoke in tongues i prophesied i
[1:11:40] interpreted i all those kind of gifts
[1:11:42] was with me
[1:11:44] but i saw myself getting weak
[1:11:48] i had visions or whatever you call them
[1:11:50] but i found out i said no something's
[1:11:53] not right
[1:11:54] i did not have the word that can go into
[1:11:58] the holies of holies
[1:12:00] my flesh was anointed my spirit was
[1:12:02] anointed so much so that god could use
[1:12:05] me in that realm
[1:12:08] but i knew
[1:12:09] that this heart had not yet been
[1:12:11] converted
[1:12:13] because when it's not converted you'll
[1:12:15] do things that god will allow you to do
[1:12:19] to show you it's not right yet
[1:12:23] and we'll look over that thing you
[1:12:24] cannot look over it god is trying to
[1:12:27] share tell you something
[1:12:30] but everybody in the message you know
[1:12:31] people
[1:12:33] the things that people do i say message
[1:12:34] i shouldn't just say that because it's
[1:12:36] everywhere
[1:12:37] or among the christians they smoke they
[1:12:40] drink they lie they do reefer they do
[1:12:42] drugs they do all of these things and
[1:12:44] they still think that they're saved
[1:12:49] what are you thirsting for
[1:12:52] what's in there is thirsting for the
[1:12:54] world
[1:12:55] the bible says love not the world nor
[1:12:57] the things that are in the world for the
[1:12:59] things that are in the world is the lust
[1:13:00] of the flesh the lust of the eye and the
[1:13:02] pride of life
[1:13:03] i'm not trying to be hard young people
[1:13:05] by saying god i'm trying to get you to
[1:13:08] look deep down and says oh god if i
[1:13:10] don't have it i need it i want it
[1:13:13] you know i want this change that i hear
[1:13:15] the prophet of god tells talks about
[1:13:17] that's what i want
[1:13:20] we're all striving to for for perfection
[1:13:24] but the target is to get your soul
[1:13:25] converted you say well what do you mean
[1:13:27] peter says lord i will not deny you let
[1:13:30] me tell you something if your soul is
[1:13:32] not converted you will deny him
[1:13:37] you would be ashamed of him when your
[1:13:40] soul is not converted
[1:13:43] people said lord you know my heart i
[1:13:44] wouldn't do this jesus said yes you will
[1:13:49] before the croc the crow three
[1:13:51] times you're gonna deny me
[1:13:54] but this is the good news peter when you
[1:13:56] are converted
[1:13:58] strengthen your brother
[1:14:01] the position of christ in your heart
[1:14:04] guarantees you
[1:14:06] fellowship
[1:14:08] with nobody else with fellowship with
[1:14:10] you he will
[1:14:13] when you think you are all alone which
[1:14:15] you'll never alone he's there
[1:14:18] he's your protector he's your guider he
[1:14:21] guides you he leads you he's your your
[1:14:24] comforter i read that he's the one
[1:14:27] that's comforting you
[1:14:30] it may even come from another brother or
[1:14:32] sister but it still boils down to god
[1:14:35] comforting you
[1:14:39] i'll never leave you nor forsake you
[1:14:43] see he says listen now in uncertain
[1:14:45] sound this person what if you could ever
[1:14:48] get
[1:14:49] this soul on the inside
[1:14:52] so in harmony with god
[1:14:54] that your soul and god would be one
[1:14:59] together
[1:15:01] then you could ask what you will
[1:15:04] and it shall be given to you
[1:15:07] and see that's the problem with most of
[1:15:09] us christians
[1:15:10] we're trying to work the word
[1:15:12] with an intellectual understanding of it
[1:15:18] that's why we're failing
[1:15:21] those ignorant people down in in in in
[1:15:24] in uh with
[1:15:26] when you say isuzu street didn't have
[1:15:28] the ability to read but they knew they
[1:15:30] had how to get god
[1:15:32] and they did exploits
[1:15:35] and here come a man with a seventh grade
[1:15:37] education didn't know how to pray
[1:15:40] but he knew how to call on god he knew
[1:15:43] how to get sincere
[1:15:45] and when he got sincere and called on
[1:15:47] god god came down
[1:15:50] we must say no to every reasoning that
[1:15:52] is against the word of god
[1:15:54] y'all hear what i'm trying to say the
[1:15:56] christ in you
[1:15:58] that's why he said it like that christ
[1:16:00] in you
[1:16:01] the hope of glory
[1:16:06] many people come to me many times in the
[1:16:08] prayer line and stand there and say oh
[1:16:10] brother branham i have plenty faith i
[1:16:13] got faith like to move mountains and yet
[1:16:16] they haven't any faith he didn't say
[1:16:18] some i'm not even a little bit he said
[1:16:19] not any
[1:16:21] they hardly have enough faith to get to
[1:16:23] the platform but they are conscious of
[1:16:26] one thing that they do believe
[1:16:28] they are believing intellectually with
[1:16:31] their mind and their mind will never
[1:16:33] bring them to god
[1:16:36] let me read that again
[1:16:38] they are believing intellectually with
[1:16:40] their mind
[1:16:42] and their mind will never bring them to
[1:16:44] god your mind is reasoning and god has
[1:16:49] no reasoning
[1:16:51] and if you can reason it out your mind
[1:16:54] will tell you now look here the doctor
[1:16:56] says i can't get over that it's
[1:16:59] impossible now the doctor with this
[1:17:01] little intellect with his
[1:17:03] intelligence with this knowledge and of
[1:17:06] medicine science he has told you the
[1:17:08] best of the travel of his mind and it
[1:17:11] take and you take it in your mind and
[1:17:14] using the same thing the doctor has told
[1:17:16] you god can't never touch that line as
[1:17:19] long as you reason
[1:17:22] but let put down reasoning god never
[1:17:25] made us to live by our intellect we live
[1:17:29] by the holy spirit
[1:17:31] that's in our soul that says no
[1:17:35] to any reasoning
[1:17:36] that's contrary to god's word
[1:17:39] help us jesus is this okay
[1:17:42] now we must understand that we ourselves
[1:17:46] in and i'm saying this because i've been
[1:17:48] in the message for a long time
[1:17:51] some of you were born and raised in the
[1:17:52] message
[1:17:53] i've come through the
[1:17:55] the shout the dance the you heard me say
[1:17:58] this the other day but
[1:18:01] you know when you get to a place you
[1:18:02] just get fed up and says where's the
[1:18:04] change
[1:18:06] with all of this
[1:18:10] i had a brother say to me well you know
[1:18:12] brother adam said that we'll be slugging
[1:18:14] along until the last one comes in and
[1:18:16] that's true
[1:18:18] that's true
[1:18:19] but if you are slugging make sure you
[1:18:21] got the holy ghost while you slug
[1:18:26] you don't want to be moving slow and
[1:18:27] ain't got it
[1:18:29] because the vision said don't you listen
[1:18:32] when the vision has been made plain
[1:18:34] let him that readeth run
[1:18:39] stefan's had so stephen had so much of
[1:18:41] that blessing in him said when they were
[1:18:43] stoning stephen he said oh he had so
[1:18:46] much blessing in him so much of the
[1:18:48] hidden power till stephen become another
[1:18:51] person looked up and seen jesus standing
[1:18:53] at the right hand of god and never seen
[1:18:56] a felt a clock when it it born uh born
[1:19:00] him in the head listen isn't that maybe
[1:19:03] he said he didn't feel a thing
[1:19:06] not one brick
[1:19:08] he didn't feel it he said that can't be
[1:19:11] true it is true
[1:19:14] those who were thrown in the fiery
[1:19:16] furnace they didn't feel it
[1:19:20] it was so hot it killed the men who
[1:19:22] threw them in there
[1:19:26] and yet they come out of all of that and
[1:19:28] the bible says not even the smell of
[1:19:30] smoke was on them
[1:19:32] my god is god
[1:19:34] our god is god and we've got to realize
[1:19:37] that this word is dynamite
[1:19:41] it explodes it's not just a
[1:19:44] on the pages but the only way we'll be
[1:19:46] able to
[1:19:47] see it and be partake of it we must have
[1:19:50] the holy spirit on the inside that's the
[1:19:53] only way it's going to work for you
[1:19:55] because that's the power of the word
[1:19:57] it is the holy ghost that quickens the
[1:20:00] word
[1:20:03] think about it people we can't hardly
[1:20:05] stand for people to talk about us more
[1:20:07] or less stone us
[1:20:10] and brother brother said the true
[1:20:11] christian don't fight back
[1:20:19] he said i could see stephen there he
[1:20:20] knelt down his enemy spitting on him and
[1:20:22] everything else and clotting him and he
[1:20:25] raised up and looked up to heaven and he
[1:20:27] said father lay not this sin to their
[1:20:30] charge
[1:20:31] i forgive them father
[1:20:34] see that's the holy ghost we've got to
[1:20:36] have today
[1:20:38] that kind that can forgive now i'm going
[1:20:39] to go ahead on because i know i'm taking
[1:20:41] a lot a little longer than i wanted to
[1:20:43] but the thing he said that stephen was
[1:20:45] so wrapped up in god and god was so
[1:20:47] wrapped up in him the bible never said
[1:20:49] that stephen died
[1:20:52] he said he fell asleep
[1:20:54] and brother adam said god rocked rocked
[1:20:58] stephen asleep in his bosom in his arm
[1:21:00] can you see you say well brothers what
[1:21:02] are you saying that's the same thing
[1:21:04] that happened to john when they threw
[1:21:06] him in that oil john didn't wasn't
[1:21:09] kicking and hauling and screaming
[1:21:14] no
[1:21:15] that all that burning all didn't hurt
[1:21:17] him and they got so frustrated they
[1:21:19] didn't know what to do they tried
[1:21:20] everything they could do to kill him and
[1:21:22] couldn't kill him
[1:21:23] that's the bride
[1:21:24] satan has tried everything to kill her
[1:21:27] but he cannot kill her she's ordained to
[1:21:31] live
[1:21:33] hallelujah
[1:21:36] christ in you the hope of glory i i just
[1:21:39] get you know maybe i'm losing my mind
[1:21:41] and i'm trusting that i am so i could
[1:21:42] have his and you know i'm looking at
[1:21:44] this thing and i says you know what lord
[1:21:47] it's got to come this simple
[1:21:50] because when it come and you try to
[1:21:51] bring deep things to people you know
[1:21:53] they're wondering where you're getting
[1:21:54] it from
[1:22:00] well let me say it like this if god is
[1:22:02] anointing it
[1:22:04] and the word is true
[1:22:06] it must come from him
[1:22:09] because the bible says that the bible is
[1:22:12] uh of no private interpretation
[1:22:17] and i said like this you know you you
[1:22:19] take william branham who was our prophet
[1:22:21] he read other people's books he got a
[1:22:23] lot of things from other people
[1:22:25] but god vindicated that what he got was
[1:22:28] right
[1:22:31] see what people don't understand that's
[1:22:32] why they say well he he he played no he
[1:22:34] didn't pleasurize nothing
[1:22:37] that's like telling jesus how can you do
[1:22:40] you you go out there and you eat that
[1:22:42] corn that ain't in your field
[1:22:45] but listen the corn is god's
[1:22:49] everything is god's
[1:22:52] you have a right to it
[1:22:58] think about it and i'm almost done with
[1:23:00] this little portion
[1:23:01] but peter and john they were poor they
[1:23:04] had nothing and i could read all of this
[1:23:07] they didn't even belong to a church
[1:23:09] brotherhood said they didn't have any
[1:23:11] education they didn't belong to a
[1:23:13] denomination there was no uncertainty
[1:23:16] about their experience they had no
[1:23:18] positive uh they didn't have money they
[1:23:21] didn't have membership they didn't have
[1:23:23] education but peter says such as i have
[1:23:27] give it to you in the name of jesus
[1:23:29] christ rise up in war
[1:23:31] they had a hidden power
[1:23:35] and that's what we must have
[1:23:37] you and i won't go it has to be there on
[1:23:40] the inside
[1:23:43] not because you know we can quote the
[1:23:45] message and quote scripture and
[1:23:48] be uh articulate and
[1:23:51] that has nothing to do with it
[1:23:55] and god made sure he could have chose
[1:23:57] paul to preach on the day of pentecost
[1:23:59] but he didn't
[1:24:01] he chose peter
[1:24:02] a hard-headed jew
[1:24:05] who had a problem with his temper
[1:24:09] and by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:24:12] he resolved it
[1:24:14] dissolved it however you want to say it
[1:24:17] peter stood up there with no fear
[1:24:20] and preached the gospel of jesus christ
[1:24:24] it ain't money
[1:24:26] it ain't none of that
[1:24:29] it's what's in your heart
[1:24:31] you know every time i say that i think
[1:24:33] about that commercial what's in your
[1:24:34] wallet
[1:24:39] purchasing power that's what it's all
[1:24:41] about that's what's in my wallet
[1:24:43] purchasing power that's what's in my
[1:24:45] heart purchasing power
[1:24:48] that's what must be in your heart
[1:24:51] i told the lord the day i says god you
[1:24:53] know
[1:24:54] i do not want to be a hypocrite
[1:24:57] i'd rather be just a rank center
[1:25:00] than to be a hypocrite
[1:25:04] in all the hypocritical ways that i've
[1:25:06] had in the past please take them away
[1:25:09] undo everything that i've done
[1:25:13] covered by your blood lord jesus
[1:25:16] give me a fresh start
[1:25:19] make me more real than i've ever been
[1:25:20] before
[1:25:23] i told the lord and i'm gonna tell you
[1:25:24] something folks when i come to church i
[1:25:26] don't i don't put on i enjoy jesus
[1:25:30] i enjoy i tell the lord i enjoy being a
[1:25:33] christian
[1:25:36] some people look at me and some i look
[1:25:38] over to some people but not to all
[1:25:40] people
[1:25:41] you know but when they tell me man you
[1:25:43] look younger than that i always
[1:25:45] contributed to god
[1:25:48] because god kept me out of the clubs he
[1:25:50] kept me off the drugs
[1:25:52] he kept me off all that stuff that beats
[1:25:54] you up and make you look old older
[1:25:58] i can walk
[1:26:00] i can run
[1:26:02] i'm not humped over
[1:26:04] you know what i'm saying y'all do y'all
[1:26:06] understand me
[1:26:09] the other day sunday i guess the stress
[1:26:11] was so immense or intense
[1:26:14] it was suddenly was a stressful day
[1:26:16] sunday was
[1:26:18] when i woke up that morning my eye was
[1:26:20] all bloodshot and red bruised
[1:26:23] another vessel had broken in my i asked
[1:26:25] the lord to forgive me i said god i
[1:26:27] didn't understand that the service
[1:26:29] had
[1:26:31] had me so wound up but i dealt with a
[1:26:33] lot of spirits on sunday
[1:26:36] people said it was a good service it was
[1:26:37] because god came through anyway
[1:26:41] but i know that there's a weakness in
[1:26:44] but i told the lord i said you know what
[1:26:45] god i said you know what at least i can
[1:26:47] still see
[1:26:50] i would care less if they both were red
[1:26:52] as long as i could still see
[1:26:55] it ain't the beauty of the eyes
[1:26:57] paul dealt with something that he
[1:26:59] couldn't get rid of
[1:27:01] brother branham had an affliction almost
[1:27:03] all of his days
[1:27:06] praying for the sick and yet he was sick
[1:27:08] himself
[1:27:10] see whatever it takes
[1:27:13] to bring me to perfection
[1:27:15] to bring me to the manifestation of
[1:27:17] what's now living in me so let it be
[1:27:23] but people don't understand the stress
[1:27:26] because you know
[1:27:27] the thing is every true preacher
[1:27:30] tries to save
[1:27:32] his congregation
[1:27:35] and that's impossible
[1:27:37] because only god can save
[1:27:44] you love the lord i thought the service
[1:27:46] was going to go a different way but
[1:27:47] since it's going this way we're just
[1:27:49] going to finish it out in just a minute
[1:27:50] we're not going to keep you too much
[1:27:52] longer it's now 8 30 so just give me a
[1:27:54] few more minutes
[1:27:56] with all of the reasoning power talk
[1:27:58] about this woman who was a christian but
[1:28:00] she was led astray
[1:28:03] and when she was led astray she stopped
[1:28:06] saying or listening to the voice of god
[1:28:10] always listen to the barking of the dog
[1:28:14] because that's the person you know we're
[1:28:16] not talking the holy spirit is a dog but
[1:28:18] god always tell you no
[1:28:21] when he knows you're not supposed to be
[1:28:22] doing it
[1:28:24] with all of this reasoning power she had
[1:28:27] she had gone to church
[1:28:28] she had given to charity she's done
[1:28:31] everything that's right she thinks so
[1:28:33] everything that's right in her mind
[1:28:36] she has followed the addict
[1:28:39] the dictates of her mind
[1:28:41] i know i should go to church i know i
[1:28:44] should be friendly i know i should treat
[1:28:46] all my neighbors right i know i should
[1:28:48] do this and that but still what it what
[1:28:50] is it
[1:28:51] she had grieved away this fellowship
[1:28:54] and then in the hour of her death
[1:28:57] when she gets ready to die and what
[1:29:00] happened this lady left her husband
[1:29:02] married another man and and all that
[1:29:04] kind of stuff she really went out there
[1:29:06] and because the church was doing it she
[1:29:08] was doing it isn't that funny
[1:29:10] that's the way it works
[1:29:12] so-and-so can do it i can do it too
[1:29:14] that's foolishness
[1:29:17] foolishness
[1:29:19] and then the hour of death
[1:29:21] when she gets ready to die she is laying
[1:29:24] on the bed and all at once she wakes up
[1:29:27] and hollers
[1:29:28] oh my god i'm lost
[1:29:32] the pastor will say give her a hypo
[1:29:35] she's delirious and here's he shoots him
[1:29:37] with a hypo in it and she tried to speak
[1:29:40] she can't speak she's murmur what is it
[1:29:43] her soul has caught up with her before
[1:29:46] death
[1:29:49] not only not only women but men also who
[1:29:51] spurn the love of jesus christ who has
[1:29:54] turned him down made fun of it it'll
[1:29:57] catch up with you someday
[1:30:00] as certain as i'm standing here this
[1:30:03] morning
[1:30:05] you'll grieve it so far till you can't
[1:30:07] feel it no more
[1:30:09] but it'll catch you sometime again isn't
[1:30:12] that funny we don't want it see what is
[1:30:15] he saying he said you can just so grieve
[1:30:18] him amen until you won't even feel him
[1:30:20] no more
[1:30:22] now i'm not talking about those people
[1:30:24] who he's not who's making the makeup is
[1:30:26] not
[1:30:28] feelings some people just can't feel
[1:30:30] like others
[1:30:31] but those of you who have felt him
[1:30:35] do you still feel him
[1:30:37] and if you're not feeling him the way
[1:30:38] you used to feel him then there's
[1:30:40] something wrong with you
[1:30:44] it's not god
[1:30:52] i don't believe nobody in here has
[1:30:53] grieved him away i don't
[1:30:55] but i'm sharing these things so that
[1:30:57] you'll know that it is possible
[1:30:59] for that to happen
[1:31:02] it'll all come back to you the dirty
[1:31:05] things the bad things the tattling the
[1:31:08] the babbling the bite biting the
[1:31:10] selfishness and things that you've done
[1:31:13] that's all come back to you someday
[1:31:16] laying on your death bed
[1:31:20] and i'm closing this
[1:31:22] the reason why i'm saying these things
[1:31:24] is because people it's real
[1:31:28] this message is real
[1:31:31] christ in you the hope of glory now i
[1:31:33] skipped a lot of things
[1:31:35] but i i i just wanted to kind of throw
[1:31:38] this out i'll be preaching on sunday
[1:31:41] and so i don't know where god is going
[1:31:42] to take me there but
[1:31:44] if we don't if we can't even we can't
[1:31:46] even get people to repent no more i
[1:31:48] can't do it you know what brother man
[1:31:49] said no matter how the preacher preached
[1:31:52] he cannot lead anybody to the lord
[1:31:55] he said it takes the anointing it takes
[1:31:58] christ
[1:32:00] to lead people to the lord he can't do
[1:32:03] it i can't do it we can preach the word
[1:32:07] that's all we can do
[1:32:09] but a man
[1:32:11] woman has to want him
[1:32:13] in their heart
[1:32:15] and i say it like this it has to become
[1:32:18] a place where you're desperate
[1:32:21] he said well brother books how do i get
[1:32:23] desperate ask him
[1:32:24] he knows how to make you desperate
[1:32:27] he knows how to bring you the bible said
[1:32:29] that he will not
[1:32:31] all that the father has given me
[1:32:34] will come
[1:32:37] let's stand
[1:32:42] understand that every good thing that we
[1:32:44] ever achieve in this life
[1:32:46] is because the holy spirit has led us
[1:32:48] through it
[1:32:50] no big eyes no big use or anything of
[1:32:52] that nature we all fall short of the
[1:32:55] glory of god
[1:32:57] and we must all understand by god's
[1:32:59] grace that
[1:33:00] what makes this a salvation so great and
[1:33:03] and you know i'm i'm working with the
[1:33:05] expression the feelings and all of these
[1:33:06] things but we also also know
[1:33:11] that when god comes into the soul
[1:33:15] i know you've had maybe you didn't feel
[1:33:18] a thunderbolt
[1:33:20] but sometimes it comes in like a like a
[1:33:22] little warm fuzzy type spirit sometimes
[1:33:25] you
[1:33:26] you know things happen on your arm or
[1:33:28] head or that's god
[1:33:30] [Music]
[1:33:31] sometimes he'll do things i've seen god
[1:33:34] flicker a light just to let you know he
[1:33:36] was in the presence he does things
[1:33:38] differently for everybody
[1:33:40] but one thing for certain
[1:33:43] when he comes in he brings a change
[1:33:46] this is what we look at not human effort
[1:33:48] we look have it been a change
[1:33:51] is there a change in your life
[1:33:56] and
[1:33:58] if it has been it will be a change that
[1:34:01] moved you forward into christ
[1:34:04] into his word
[1:34:05] [Music]
[1:34:08] knowing amen that your whole desire and
[1:34:10] your whole
[1:34:11] will is to do the perfect will of god
[1:34:14] [Music]
[1:34:17] thank you father for your grace let's
[1:34:19] bound the word of prayer
[1:34:22] our dear heavenly father we so thank you
[1:34:25] we thank you for your amazing grace
[1:34:29] we thank you for the election and the
[1:34:31] power of this
[1:34:33] message
[1:34:34] that you brought to us in this hour
[1:34:39] there's no uncertain sound
[1:34:43] that stands in my soul today
[1:34:47] your word is amen
[1:34:49] your promises
[1:34:50] are abandoned
[1:34:53] it's not if

[1:35:02] word and
