[0:01] oh say he can battle he can fight but
[0:05] when you come to know who you are
[0:07] no devil can stand against you they're
[0:11] doing their job and they supposed to do
[0:13] their job but they lose us lose us
[0:20] that's what I'm saying somebody better
[0:22] say Amen that's the way I see it and you
[0:27] know what this joy that I have the world
[0:30] didn't give it to me and the world came
[0:32] take it away come brother I want to sing
[0:36] that song but I can't even

[0:58] I turn it on and turn it off and God
[1:03] bless you all
[1:04] it's good to see the brothers here today
[1:08] very funny you look better than you did
[1:11] yesterday
[1:14] you know I I've always heard that the
[1:17] older you get you kind of start looking
[1:19] a little less pretty but that's not true
[1:24] with you guys
[1:24] I see the brother here he looks very
[1:28] fine
[1:29] you look very fine brother god bless you
[1:32] sir I see a lady back there sister
[1:35] Shekinah she brings back a memory for me
[1:38] as I remember the last time I was here
[1:42] that brother Troy had preached a message
[1:46] in well that's first and only time I've
[1:50] ever heard brother Troy preach and I I
[1:53] don't mean it any bad way but this is
[1:56] just the way it was brother toys not a
[1:58] very good preacher he kind of stumbles
[2:00] around he may be different now but this
[2:03] was back then
[2:04] telling quiet can't hardly hear him I
[2:08] thought what on earth yeah Wow
[2:13] but the presence of the Lord came and
[2:20] brother Brooks asked me if I had
[2:22] something to say and I said yes and I
[2:26] said at the presence the Lord was there
[2:30] and I said if you want that presence you
[2:33] can have it and it nobody move nobody
[2:38] said anything you remember that note yet
[2:41] and nobody moved
[2:43] nobody said anything well I think the
[2:46] song she sung about being patient I need
[2:48] to do that because I'm not very patient
[2:52] so I said to myself I said I'm going to
[2:55] say it one more time and if if nobody
[2:58] comes to get that I'm walking out that's
[3:01] I that's what I did that's just what I
[3:04] said in myself and I said the presence
[3:07] of the Lord is here if you want it come
[3:10] and get it
[3:10] and nobody moved so of course the pulpit
[3:14] was right over there that diamond I just
[3:17] turned to walk off and as I turned to
[3:19] walk off just as she kind of come
[3:21] walking up here
[3:23] she's a little smaller then and she said
[3:29] I leaned down she whispered so quiet I
[3:31] could barely hear I gotta listen close
[3:35] and she said I don't think I have what
[3:39] you're talking about is that what you
[3:42] said sister's going something like that
[3:45] she said I want it I said well go over
[3:50] there and that's a little bit close to
[3:51] where you're at now it was up a little
[3:52] bit I said go over there and start
[3:54] praying that what you did
[3:59] and I told brother Troy but the toy you
[4:02] go over with her because I want you to
[4:04] realize what it is when a child receives
[4:07] the Holy Ghost and he began to pray the
[4:12] devil begin to fight and he fought but
[4:22] she prayed and she kept praying and I
[4:28] watched the Spirit of the Lord come down
[4:30] and they go back up and then I come down
[4:33] and then go back up and then all of a
[4:39] sudden sisters she kind of started
[4:41] praying she really started praying and
[4:45] the spirit the Lord came to her and he
[4:49] hit brother Troy and brother Brooks
[4:51] remembers his whole body was just shaken
[4:54] he couldn't control himself he'd just
[4:56] shake it and it was wonderful it was
[5:01] wonderful and I remember that from time
[5:06] to time when I tell quite a few places I
[5:09] go about your son yeah that's the son
[5:12] very nice they watched him that night
[5:16] and this is what happened this picture
[5:19] the brother Brooks put back up I believe
[5:21] it's the same one that was there then
[5:23] this pillar of fire came off for this
[5:25] picture and it went down and it went
[5:28] right on top of that boy he was a little
[5:31] smaller too and when it did he just went
[5:35] forward right over the seat dinya and I
[5:40] watched I said oh my and then that
[5:43] pillar fire came back up up and came
[5:45] right back up for the picture and so I
[5:47] walked back down and I said to the
[5:49] brother I said can I speak to your son
[5:51] he said yes and I said to him I said you
[5:54] see that pillar fire there he said yes I
[5:57] said that
[5:58] came down and went on top of you and he
[6:02] just went right over the seat again so
[6:06] I like those memories now what's the
[6:13] devil done since then
[6:16] but what has God done since their God is
[6:26] in control we'd like to take a scripture
[6:34] reading tonight from the book of st.
[6:43] mark thank you for playing the
[6:46] instruments thank you for the song that
[6:49] was very wonderful it always amazes me
[6:52] how that God can tell a little lady like
[6:57] that sing this song and she sings it and
[7:00] it's just right it's just right I don't
[7:04] that's amazing we want to turn to
[7:11] chapter 11 of Saint Mark
[7:27] do we need an interpreter tonight no we
[7:30] don't need an interpreter you guys speak
[7:32] English better than me probably do I'm
[7:39] not a very good speaker this brother
[7:44] looked at me like I know so st. mark
[7:50] chapter 11 verse 22 is where we want to
[7:56] begin reading tonight this is where G
[8:07] had cursed the fig tree and had a
[8:10] withered from the roots up and Peter was
[8:14] amazed at that and he said Wow remember
[8:17] that Jesus Jesus yeah I remember
[8:20] and Jesus verse 22 answering saith unto
[8:24] them have faith in God for verily I say
[8:30] unto you that whosoever shall say unto
[8:33] this mountain be thou removed and be
[8:35] thou cast into the sea and shall not
[8:39] doubt in his heart but shall believe
[8:40] that those things which he saith shall
[8:43] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[8:46] saith therefore I say unto you what
[8:51] things soever you desire when you pray
[8:54] believe that you receive them and ye
[8:57] shall have them and when you stand
[9:02] praying forgive if you have aught
[9:07] against any that your father also which
[9:12] is in heaven may forgive you your
[9:15] trespasses but if you do not forgive
[9:20] neither will your father which is in
[9:23] heaven
[9:23] forgive your trespasses you may be
[9:27] seated a couple years
[9:39] I was called to a hospital where a lady
[9:47] lay dying she was on life support she
[9:49] was in a coma she had no hope of living
[9:54] and the daughter asked me to come and
[9:58] pray for the mother and I did and the
[10:01] Lord raised her up and so the daughter
[10:05] came and asked me to go speak to her one
[10:08] week later she was out of off life
[10:11] support out of the coma very coherent
[10:13] the disease that they had diagnosed the
[10:16] with sclerosis of the liver was gone and
[10:18] she was going to be sent home and so I
[10:22] went to speak to this lady a German lady
[10:25] and as I began to speak to her she had
[10:30] told me that she knew she was going to
[10:33] heaven based on a dream that she had had
[10:37] and I said well that's that's very good
[10:40] and as we talked a little bit I seen
[10:43] right in the middle of her chest a
[10:45] little something about that big
[10:47] I thought the doctors had put it there
[10:49] looked like a little computer or
[10:51] something and it was flashing and it was
[10:54] flashing one word da D
[10:56] Dada I thought well that's a strange
[10:59] little computer that the doctors put on
[11:01] this lady and I kept looking at I
[11:04] thought what is that thing
[11:06] all of a sudden he disappeared I thought
[11:09] oh so I said to her I said is your
[11:13] father still alive and she began to
[11:15] curse and said I hate that man I said oh
[11:21] why he said she this lady told me that
[11:25] when she was six years old
[11:26] her father tried to rape her three times
[11:30] her mother actually dragged her father
[11:32] off of her and then again when she was
[11:34] eight and nine years old and she said I
[11:37] will never forgive him for that but
[11:40] first I asked her if she had forgive him
[11:42] and she said I cannot and I will not
[11:44] forgive him for that and I said ma'am I
[11:48] said I'm sorry to tell you this but
[11:51] you're not going to heaven
[11:53] she said why not I said because Jesus
[11:56] said if you don't forgive those who have
[11:58] sinned against you God won't forgive you
[12:02] and she was laying in the bed and I was
[12:05] on this side of her and she turned her
[12:07] head like this wouldn't even look at me
[12:09] very probably five minutes I never said
[12:15] a word I just sat there I was praying I
[12:18] said lord I don't know what to do I
[12:21] don't know what to say
[12:22] I don't that's the Word of God I can't
[12:26] in awe but finally she turned and she
[12:29] looked at me and she said does it really
[12:31] say that I said yes and she turned her
[12:35] head back again away from me for a
[12:38] little bit longer and then I felt the
[12:41] presence of the Lord come that change
[12:44] did and she turned her head back and she
[12:48] looked at me tears running down her face
[12:50] and she said will you help me I said I
[12:53] can't but I know who can I said why
[12:59] don't you take this hurt that your
[13:02] father gave to you and you give it to
[13:05] Jesus and she said all right
[13:10] and so we prayed she gave it to him in
[13:14] three months later they had indeed sent
[13:18] her home she was well she was fine
[13:22] she went to bed one night and never woke
[13:24] up the next morning
[13:26] this time she went to heaven why because
[13:35] it was one thing did her father deserve
[13:39] forgiveness no but it doesn't say
[13:44] forgive him if they deserve it he said
[13:48] forgive them
[13:54] I think in my life and I will tell a
[14:01] pretty personal thing that happened to
[14:03] me when I was growing up we was raised
[14:07] in a message church I was I have seven
[14:10] brothers and sisters and if mom come for
[14:14] supper you went to supper and it didn't
[14:17] matter what they had you ate it it was
[14:20] beans and potatoes that's all it was so
[14:23] because those seven other people won't
[14:25] take your abortion if you didn't give it
[14:26] to if you didn't eat yours and so very
[14:31] poor and the church we was in was very
[14:35] strict very very hard it was to the
[14:40] point that if your hair touched your
[14:43] forehead you got in trouble you had to
[14:46] wear a yellow patch on your shirt you
[14:47] couldn't talk to nobody for two weeks
[14:49] nobody could talk to you for two weeks
[14:51] if you hair went down on your forehead
[14:55] cause mine's getting where it don't go
[14:56] down anywhere but and so I I thought
[15:00] growing up in that church that that
[15:03] little yellow patch on your shirt was
[15:04] part of your clothes because I wore it
[15:06] all the time
[15:08] and so in the school that they had they
[15:13] had a room and it was four foot square 6
[15:17] foot tall it was painted black and if
[15:19] you got in so much trouble you got
[15:21] locked in that room for three days I was
[15:24] in that room for six months
[15:26] it wasn't fun and so one day at school
[15:33] of course like I said I little yellow
[15:37] piece of cloth that was on my shirt one
[15:43] day at school I did something and the
[15:46] teacher got angry with me and if you if
[15:50] you got in so much trouble at school the
[15:52] teacher would write on your paper what
[15:55] you did and you had to take it home to
[15:57] your parents and your parents had to
[15:59] punish you and write the punishment on
[16:01] the piece of paper and you took it back
[16:02] to the teacher now this was Christian
[16:05] teachers it was a Christian school run
[16:08] by the church and so I got in trouble of
[16:12] course I was in we called it the dark
[16:14] room I was already in the dark room and
[16:16] and so I took my piece of paper home
[16:21] that told what I had done the teacher
[16:24] lied that's that's all it is the teacher
[16:26] lied and said I did something I didn't
[16:28] do and my I give my paper to my dad you
[16:33] know I was 15 years old and my dad read
[16:36] the paper and he looked at me and he
[16:38] said why did you do this I said I didn't
[16:41] do it he said yeah you did I said well I
[16:46] didn't do it he said those teachers
[16:49] don't lie so they got the Holy Ghost
[16:52] I said all right of course I had to go
[16:55] cut my switch you know and whoever had
[16:57] to cut your switch we all had to I think
[17:01] at one time you didn't bring no little
[17:03] one back in you didn't want your dad
[17:05] going cutting a switch and so I went and
[17:09] cut my switch years old you know I
[17:11] thought I stuff I said in my mind I said
[17:15] whatever my dad does to me I'm not going
[17:17] to cry I don't care what he does I'm not
[17:19] going to cry at stuff I was dumb I
[17:24] should have cried with all I had and so
[17:29] my dad take your shirt off it took my
[17:30] shirt off and he hit me three times at
[17:32] that switch and it hurt but I wasn't
[17:34] going cry and so I turned around I
[17:38] looked at him I thought he was done and
[17:39] I said are you done well he took it to
[17:42] me and I was being a smart aleck I
[17:45] wasn't but that's the way it was took he
[17:48] said no I'm not so he proceeded to beat
[17:51] me until my back was wide open blood
[17:55] flying everywhere
[17:56] my older brother came in and punched him
[17:59] in the jaw knocked him off I mean in him
[18:02] and my dad was fighting - my other
[18:04] brothers grabbed me and dragged me out
[18:05] of there to the bathroom and washed my
[18:08] back out and puts I've on it fixed me up
[18:13] once they got done I heard my brother in
[18:15] there still fighting with my dad my mom
[18:17] screaming you know and trying to break
[18:19] it up
[18:21] and I said something I shouldn't have
[18:23] said I looked at my brothers and I said
[18:27] I'll kill that man for this they said
[18:29] we'll help you this is a message people
[18:34] this isn't a message Church I never did
[18:39] it I never killed him and I'm thankful I
[18:42] never very thankful that he died a
[18:45] couple years ago brain aneurysm but I
[18:51] struggled with that my whole life I
[18:55] thought I'd forgive him I thought that
[19:00] you know hey we patched things up we got
[19:03] along pretty good but yet something in
[19:07] me was hurt something in me didn't want
[19:12] to let that go
[19:15] one day I I found myself starting to
[19:23] correct my children the way my father
[19:27] corrected me in the very way that I said
[19:30] I would kill him for I found that in me
[19:35] I'd done some quick repentance I had to
[19:40] you because what I didn't forgive I
[19:45] turned into you that's exactly what
[19:49] happens I had to find out in my heart
[19:55] where I was wrong not where he was wrong
[19:58] where I was wrong and so I went to God I
[20:03] said God I am sorry to see my own
[20:08] children look at me
[20:09] and be afraid of me but that's what they
[20:13] did they were afraid of me like I had
[20:17] been afraid of my dad I said God please
[20:20] forgive me
[20:26] and I by God's grace forgave my dad and
[20:34] that thing left me I didn't go ask my
[20:39] dad for him to forgive me it wasn't that
[20:43] way I had to forgive him
[20:46] regardless had nothing to do with if he
[20:50] asked me to forgive him it had to do
[20:52] with my heart and that's it nobody else
[20:57] stands before God but you being this
[21:01] brother don't stand together you and
[21:03] your life you and your husband not your
[21:05] husband dear friends but when I finally
[21:13] faced in my heart what I had to forgive
[21:20] it set me free
[21:23] it's that mean for you
[21:25] I wasn't bound by that anymore and I
[21:35] think that just before the communion
[21:40] service is to be taken tonight we always
[21:49] look and see if I have offended somebody
[21:52] I think in my mind have I thought the
[21:56] scriptures say Terry one for another
[21:58] have I offended you have I offended you
[22:02] have I offended you have I offended
[22:04] whoever perhaps we should turn it around
[22:12] and ask have i forgiven you for
[22:18] offending me have i forgiven you for
[22:23] offending me
[22:31] brother Adam said that faith is based on
[22:37] forgiveness
[22:55] where in my heart in my heart in your
[23:04] heart in your heart and each one of your
[23:09] heart each person that is here tonight
[23:12] is there some unforgiveness something
[23:17] that maybe you've forgiven them but
[23:20] there's just a little bit of a not sure
[23:24] I really wish they wouldn't have done
[23:26] that right that really bothers me when
[23:28] they do that or
[23:41] can you do that
[23:46] and you forgive when they haven't asked
[23:49] you to forgive that's hard to do can you
[23:57] forgive when they keep doing it that's
[24:01] really hard to do let it stand or feet
[24:44] forgiveness
[24:58] it seemed like it should be so easy but
[25:03] it's about them it seems like we should
[25:13] be able to just do like Jesus did on the
[25:15] cross and say Father forgive them but
[25:20] remember it was the things that he was
[25:24] asking them to be forgiven of that had
[25:26] broke his heart in Gethsemane that broke
[25:31] his heart
[25:32] it wasn't the nail scars it wasn't the
[25:35] nails and the whips it was what you and
[25:38] I did as we bow our heads
[26:26] or Jesus as we are approaching the
[26:34] communion we are approaching the order
[26:45] Lord taking the bread and the wine that
[26:49] you gave for us to take and we feel this
[26:56] great serious charge in our heart and a
[27:07] great question from God above can you
[27:13] forgive those who have sinned against
[27:16] you can you forgive those who have hurt
[27:21] you the most
[27:29] give those who will continue to hurt you
[27:33] the most
[27:47] if we can we are set free if we can't we
[27:57] are bound by that or God may we as Paul
[28:12] said Terry for just a little bit and
[28:18] search our hearts and see if there's
[28:23] some bitter thing that has crept in and
[28:30] we just can't let it go
[28:47] it seems Lord that roads have been
[28:53] chosen
[28:55] it seems the choices have been made and
[29:01] it it seems that no way can it be turned
[29:10] around
[29:25] and Lord if it is you that is leading we
[29:30] don't want it turned around but we asked
[29:36] Lord before we take this road and we've
[29:39] chosen to go that we be clear in our
[29:44] heart that there is no unforgiveness in
[29:51] us that God we can walk down this road
[29:58] knowing that the things of the past are
[30:02] in the past and in the sea of God's
[30:06] forgetfulness that there is nothing that
[30:13] would hinder us from doing your will we
[30:23] ask this Lord in Jesus name Amen
[30:30] as we wait just a few moments for the
[30:36] Holy Spirit to look into your heart to
[30:39] each heart that's here in mind in yours
[30:43] and in the sister that sang in the
[30:45] musicians in the brother that was set
[30:48] free today in in these godly men and our
[30:53] brother and the older the younger the
[30:56] pastor the song leader every heart if
[31:05] you would allow God to look into it just
[31:08] a little bit
[31:27] what would he see there's two people
[31:33] that would know what's there
[31:35] that's you and God you know that no yeah
[31:40] there's sense hiding it now is it if
[31:48] it's there it'll come out no matter what
[31:52] it is and if you find an unforgiveness
[32:03] whether it be very small or very big
[32:08] will you ask God to take that from you
[32:18] sometimes it feels good to hold on to
[32:22] that sometimes we think it gives us
[32:29] strength to do things that we don't want
[32:32] to do because we feel like that person
[32:38] deserves to be hurt and they do but so
[32:46] do i but if you are willing to let God
[32:53] take that from you
[32:56] would you just raise your hand to him
[32:59] and say God I found something in me that
[33:01] I can't let go I want to hold on to this
[33:05] I don't want that person to be forgiven
[33:10] I want them to pay for what they did to
[33:13] me and by raising my hand to you God I
[33:26] commit it to you and I ask you to take

[46:35] community it's a wonderful thing when
[46:40] your heart is clean
[46:44] it's something that we have to guard all
[46:46] the time every day sometimes some things
[46:50] slip through a crack then the Holy
[46:53] Spirit shines the light down in there
[46:55] and you confess it and get rid of it
[46:59] there's nothing like being washed by the
[47:01] word is that right the Holy Ghost gets
[47:04] in there and you know find all those
[47:07] little secret chambers is that Alright
[47:11] sometimes sometimes you don't even know
[47:14] you have had an author you don't even
[47:16] know that you've got a problem with
[47:17] somebody until something comes up yeah I
[47:20] like to be exposed I like the devil and
[47:23] me to be exposed if I'm housing a devil
[47:26] I want him to be exposed
[47:28] I don't like demons living in me because
[47:32] I wasn't born for a demon to live in me
[47:34] I am the temple in the house of God
[47:37] that's all I want in me is God sometimes
[47:41] we get a squat on the owner on the land
[47:43] and the Holy Ghost comes and gotta kick
[47:44] him off
[47:45] I love the Word of God I am a happy man
[47:49] I have a great joy on the inside of my
[47:52] soul every one of us should is that
[47:55] right one of those things I always stuck
[47:58] devil said well see yeah you got got
[48:00] your crime but I tell him I said weeping
[48:02] me and do it for a night but joy income
[48:05] in the morning joy comes in the morning

[48:14] my soul amen yes oh yeah not at you in S
[48:20] Oh in shining my soul I love the word I
[48:27] love the word more now than I ever loved
[48:30] it that's that song say you keep falling
[48:35] in love with him over and over again as
[48:39] we stand we'll get right into the
[48:41] scripture he left on awning up here and
[48:43] I'm just a preacher that's all I can say
[48:45] I love forgiveness as the brother said
[48:51] you know it's not always easy but you
[48:54] can't have
[48:56] until you asked for I'd like to forgive
[49:01] sometimes things are difficult to
[49:03] forgive I've had my struggles throughout
[49:07] my Christian years many times I said I
[49:11] forgive I forgive it then her name is
[49:14] mentioned or presence is seen then I
[49:18] feel that funny feeling and every time I
[49:20] feel that would feel that feeling I'm
[49:22] like Nord is still there keep praying
[49:27] and keep asking God because he know how
[49:29] deep the thing has sankt into your soul
[49:31] or your spirit and he's the only one
[49:34] that can wash your spirit huh I depend
[49:38] upon him to wash and clean me because I
[49:40] can't do it myself but one thing about
[49:44] me I'm alive I'm a man like David I will
[49:46] acknowledge my transgressions if I know
[49:50] I've done wrong I will say I'm sorry if
[49:54] I've offended on and I don't know it or
[49:56] you've been offended by me then you are
[49:58] obligated to tell me because there's no
[50:00] way that I would have in you and not
[50:02] make it right so I think God for its
[50:06] mercy and I thank God for its grace you
[50:09] know and like I said I have offended
[50:12] people at times not even knowing it by
[50:13] saying the wrong word or gesturing and
[50:16] joking which is not convenient sometimes
[50:20] my actions may have a pick you don't
[50:22] know it and it's okay we all have times
[50:26] where we are offended or people
[50:29] offending and sometimes we think they
[50:30] know they know or they all don't know
[50:32] but sometimes they just don't that's why
[50:34] the Bible said if you've been offended
[50:37] off a brother of affinity and you go to
[50:39] him they come to you as we stand we to
[50:43] read coming from 1st Corinthians 2:11
[50:46] chapter first Corinthians the eleventh
[50:50] chapter I so love God I love my people I
[50:55] love my children I love my lord I love
[51:00] my wife and I love all of you
[51:06] come on love you if you don't love me
[51:12] I can't help it I'm loved been born of
[51:17] all have you been born of love amen love
[51:24] conquers everything that's why the devil
[51:29] wants you to have it cuz he knows he
[51:31] came he came fight loving and win love
[51:35] will conquer every thing ah
[51:40] let us read and when he had given thanks
[51:43] he brake in and said take eat this is my
[51:46] body which is broken for you this too
[51:49] and remembrance of me after the same
[51:52] manner also he took the cup when he had
[51:54] supped saying this cup is the New
[51:56] Testament in my blood this do ye as
[52:00] often as you drinking and remembrance
[52:02] with me for as often as you eat this
[52:04] bread and drink this cup you D show the
[52:07] Lord's death till he come wherefore
[52:10] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[52:12] this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[52:15] guilty of the body and the blood of the
[52:18] Lord but let a man examine himself and
[52:21] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[52:24] of that Cup but he that that eateth and
[52:27] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[52:29] damnation to himself not discerning the
[52:32] Lord's body but this cause many are weak
[52:35] and sickly among you in many sleep
[52:39] you know what that mean when you don't
[52:41] make it right and you take the cup
[52:43] anyway but it's so simple just saying
[52:45] Lord forgive me and if we would judge
[52:48] ourselves we should not be judged but
[52:51] when we are judged we are chastened of
[52:53] the Lord hallelujah that we should not
[52:56] be condemned with the world
[52:57] well for my brethren when you come
[53:00] together to eat tarry one for another
[53:02] and if any man hunger
[53:04] let him eat at home that you come not
[53:07] together unto condemnation and the rest
[53:10] I was set in order when I come let's
[53:14] have a word of Prayer
[53:16] I'll dear Heavenly Father

[53:48] celebrate this time of your death burial
[53:51] resurrection by the breaking of bread
[53:54] and the pouring of why knowing that this
[53:58] is not your literal body but it is
[54:00] symbolic of your shedded blood of
[54:02] Calvary and your broken body but with
[54:05] your stripes we are healed father in
[54:08] ourselves we're not worthy to be a part
[54:11] of this but you made us worthy Lord

[54:17] one another to commemorate what you've
[54:20] done to thank you Lord God for what

[54:57] our Father we love you tonight Lord we
[55:03] in honor come to take this communion

[1:02:40] [Music]
[1:02:42] it's been a blessed weekend we're gonna
[1:02:46] now have my feet washing I wanted to say
[1:02:50] something about that picture cuz you
[1:02:52] said something yeah we gonna do that
[1:02:58] it was the only place there because okay
[1:03:00] the other picture was there it had a
[1:03:03] nail on it and that was we just haven't
[1:03:05] had a chance but I agree with you so
[1:03:08] anyway this picture here when we were no
[1:03:12] I'm sorry
[1:03:13] it wasn't this one it was a cloud when
[1:03:16] we were young in the message and brother
[1:03:21] in a consultant on was preaching he
[1:03:23] would not come down off the cross in the
[1:03:27] midst of the service the pillar fire
[1:03:29] began to move and that that cloud began
[1:03:35] it came off of the picture we got
[1:03:39] pictures of it we literally got pictures
[1:03:41] where lambs were formed and came off
[1:03:45] people were healed all kinds of things
[1:03:48] were happening back in that day but you
[1:03:50] know what we just believed
[1:03:53] we didn't have all those intellectual
[1:03:55] stuff we just needed that God did it
[1:03:58] right supernatural signs and things were
[1:04:02] happening all the time why we didn't
[1:04:04] complicate it we didn't believe it
[1:04:06] we knew that Christ could do it in
[1:04:08] Christ did it that's back in the day we
[1:04:11] would see people seeing angels and
[1:04:13] everything real manifestation of the
[1:04:16] supernatural and that day is still today
[1:04:19] you know I just know by God's grace you
[1:04:23] know that that God getting ready to do
[1:04:26] something went right in between right
[1:04:28] there - coming it ain't no three minutes
[1:04:30] no more just that time now I just want
[1:04:33] to encourage everybody we've taken
[1:04:34] communion but I want to encourage you
[1:04:36] because I want you to know why why is he
[1:04:43] doing it now all over the world
[1:04:46] everywhere I go
[1:04:47] battles like you've never seen before
[1:04:50] because he knows you just got that
[1:04:52] moment right now folks it ain't time to
[1:04:56] do nothing but get the Holy Ghost make
[1:04:58] sure you got it and you know like like
[1:05:01] the brother said I love the Lord and I
[1:05:06] learned something about receiving the
[1:05:08] Holy Ghost I learned that you know I I
[1:05:11] myself have been so used to prevailing
[1:05:16] what is the real revelation about
[1:05:18] travailing learning how to yield you
[1:05:23] travailing to yield not to scream and
[1:05:26] holler but you you know whatever it
[1:05:28] takes I don't know what makes you but
[1:05:30] learning how to yield is that right God
[1:05:34] is identified and when you surrender all
[1:05:37] of your heart he will come in that's
[1:05:41] just how simple he comes but anyway we
[1:05:44] saw the people of being filled and
[1:05:46] healed and I'm so glad to know that
[1:05:50] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:05:52] and forever he has a God that changes
[1:05:54] not people do not let nobody change this
[1:05:57] message for you
[1:05:58] Christ is to say and like the brother
[1:06:02] said without Christ you have nothing
[1:06:03] even the prophet of God said that
[1:06:06] you know he sympathize with people who
[1:06:09] sympathize with the message right
[1:06:12] that ain't here you got to have the Holy
[1:06:15] Ghost Paul said it to understand all
[1:06:18] mysteries and have not love it profits
[1:06:22] you nothing you love the Lord we're
[1:06:24] gonna do our feet washing like we
[1:06:26] normally do sisters in the best rib you
