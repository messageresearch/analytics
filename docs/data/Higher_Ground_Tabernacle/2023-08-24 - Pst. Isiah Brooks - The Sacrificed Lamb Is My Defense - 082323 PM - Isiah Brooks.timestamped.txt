[3:43] these are cancer patients so you know if
[3:46] they're at all Christian they're reading
[3:48] their Bible or they're doing something
[3:50] and so I this this gentleman had a hat
[3:53] on and it says I love Jesus or Jesus and
[3:56] big words and and I just felt led to go
[3:59] and sit and talk with them a little bit
[4:01] and talk with them and I just said oh I

[5:35] stepped and kept going I said there's
[5:37] power and I need him I do everything in
[5:38] that name I said especially at our
[5:40] church I said we even baptized in the
[5:43] name of Jesus Christ I said there's no
[5:45] there's no power in any other name

[5:51] the name is Jesus Christ and they were
[5:53] amen amen amen and it didn't even stop

[34:53] this is not a continuation of last week
[34:58] something that I thought I throw in
[35:02] as you think next week I mean Sunday we
[35:05] will try to pick up what we left off the
[35:08] dimensions
[35:10] by the grace of God
[35:13] um
[35:14] God is so good to us
[35:18] everybody have that scripture
[35:22] Romans 4 20 to 25.
[35:28] he staggered not at the promise of God
[35:31] through unbelief
[35:33] but was strong in faith giving glory to
[35:37] God
[35:38] foreign
[35:44] and being fully persuaded
[35:47] that what he had promised
[35:50] he was able to perform
[35:53] convictions
[35:55] listen to these words
[35:59] therefore it was imputed to him for
[36:03] righteousness
[36:06] because he never doubt it
[36:11] now it was not written for his sake
[36:14] alone that it was imputed to him
[36:20] but for us also to whom it shall be
[36:24] imputed if we believe in him that raised
[36:27] up Jesus our lord from the dead
[36:35] here is the punchline who was delivered
[36:38] for our offenses
[36:41] and was raised again for our
[36:45] justification is
[36:53] I like to entitle this message
[37:00] is my defense
[37:04] let us pray father we thank you for your
[37:08] grace
[37:09] thank you for your mercy
[37:11] thank you for all that you do for us
[37:15] I pray this evening
[37:18] Lord As We Lift Your Name
[37:22] cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[37:25] there be anything in my life
[37:29] that will hinder your move tonight
[37:36] maybe there's something we missed uh
[37:39] didn't see no father we know that our
[37:43] hearts desires
[37:44] to do your perfect will say
[37:48] service in a special way
[37:54] in Jesus Christ
[37:57] amen amen you may be seated
[38:02] I have a
[38:05] subtopico it's called blameless
[38:12] We Know by the grace of God
[38:17] that man was so under sin could
[38:22] sowed
[38:28] and because of it yeah
[38:31] he do all kinds of things
[38:35] that are not
[38:37] according to the word of God
[38:41] the prophet of God said that man is
[38:43] under sin the prophetic
[38:47] but there is a way out
[38:52] he may commit adultery
[38:56] or he stole
[38:58] or broke the Sabbath
[39:02] Commandments
[39:04] but in the days of the law
[39:08] in order to be free
[39:12] he had to get a lamb
[39:17] and this lamb had to be without spots
[39:20] Hallelujah
[39:26] then he had to get a lamb hello
[39:29] and he had to bring the lamb unto the
[39:32] elders
[39:34] and they had to look this lamb over it
[39:38] is
[39:41] the Lamb had to be blameless
[39:46] had to be without a flaw on it
[39:52] Hallelujah so that you can understand
[39:56] the importance of the Lamb being without
[39:59] spots
[40:03] because it had to be a perfect lamb
[40:07] to bring a people to a Perfection
[40:11] that if he had had a blemish
[40:15] that could be your sin
[40:18] and then that lamb would not be able to
[40:22] substitute for you
[40:24] but God made sure
[40:27] that every sin
