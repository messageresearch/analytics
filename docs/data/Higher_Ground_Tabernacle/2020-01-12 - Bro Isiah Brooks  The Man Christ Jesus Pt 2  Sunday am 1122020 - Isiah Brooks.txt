John 15 we'll begin by God's grace at the 15th verse it is amazing our great God can be so great and yet so humble yet so small you can almost see if why God would resist the proud because if if there were space for pride and God he would have had it and he would have deserved it and he could show that it was what he should be but we realized that our God as great as he is liking himself as a sheep a dove those things kind of really it isn't it it just does something to me to know what God is changing me into st. John 15 and beginning at the fifteenth verse his fourth I call you and not servants call you not servants for the servant knowing not what his Lord doeth but I call you friends I love that for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you and that's what friends do they will share with you even some of their most secret things because of trust you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye ask of the Father in my name he may give it you now now he's telling you something he's telling us something that in other words we we sometimes think that our worthiness is what get things done it'll never be your worthiness it's always God's worthiness and because he chose us and the Bible says not only has he chosen that's B he has ordained us a man that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you ask of the Father in my name he give it you these things I commend you that you love one another let us pray father father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves and father there is nothing that we can do O God to even help our salvation because we realize that salvation is of the Lord it is you who starts it and as you who finishes it it is you who brings us to perfection there is no good deed within us nothing good of ourselves the Bible according to your word Lord says we have all come short we have all sinned and come short of the glory of God the Lord God it's you who have made it possible that we would come into your glory grant it now Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated I'm gonna take my time by God's grace and I'll try to go as slow as I possibly can if I speed up it's because he's speeding me up but by God's grace I'm just learning so much about the Lord Jesus and about what God is is is requiring of us we're living in a time when we can see within ourselves that is impossible for us to live this word without Jesus Christ and in all of our efforts we we will always come short of the glory of God I think God that salvation is not something you have to work for the Bible said it is the gift of God thank God for the gift a gift is something that you don't merit it is something that a friend or person or someone gives you because they in some way appreciate you and sometime it's just because they love you um we look at the world as it is now we never see Jesus Christ as a gift but Jesus Christ is the greatest gift that God could have given us because this gift was given by God it was the best gift that could ever be given is that right you know even brother Branham said that's the best gift that God could give you outside of Hawaii Alleluia so God gives us his gift and this gift that he gives us amen is himself the thing that I love about this message it takes away hope and it gives us faith because when you hope for something it doesn't mean you're going to get it but when faith is given faith will make those things that be not as though they were faith will move mountains and you and I must understand that even faith is a gift of God you can't muster faith you cannot pretend that you have it it is something that is given to you you don't even know how you got it you don't know when it came but you know you got it it is something that God imparts to you we look at the Old Testament and the scripture says even in Hebrews by faith you know this did this one did that and everything but you got to understand God didn't say by Joshua said by faith Joshua in other words this faith was given to Joshua for Joshua to speak to the son and say son stand still this faith was given to Sara it was given to Abraham and you got to understand that this faith we're talking about is not something Amen that you can buy in a grocery store or even in a Theological Seminary doesn't give you faith you can learn this Bible from A to Z and you got to realize that it will not produce faith we know the Bible says faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God hallelujah because we must understand it's not the letter that you hear when you read this Bible is not the letter that speaks hallelujah it is the voice it is the spirit behind the letter that gives you revelation of what the letter is hallelujah how many read the Bible the old scrolls and they never saw the coming of Jesus Christ but yet there were those who could read the scrolls or even hear the scrolls and the voice of the scrolls spoke to them yeah understand thing it has to be a voice it has to be a living spirit that lifts these words off of the pages in order for you and I to understand it and when that voice is lifted off the pages that's what we call quickened when the spirit quickens the Word of God to you it becomes living it's no longer history is no longer words in a book it becomes a lie now only God can do that that's why sometime when we reading the Bible to some of us the Bible may be boring sometimes the Bible made me it may be a task before you and the reason why it becomes that is because you're trying to understand the Bible in your intellect but when you approach God in the spirit and read his Bible in the spirit it is then the Spirit will quicken the words to you and then you will enjoy it it will never be your intellect that will be able to absorb absorb God it is the spirit man on the inside the living creature this flesh is dead but there is a living creature on the inside that we call ourselves it is a born-again experience that literally make this Bible live why you say that because the Bible says that the carnal mind cannot understand those things that are spiritual as long as you're not born again you just think you know hallelujah now there are times that God will grant you a revelation even though you're not born again hello is that true because Peter understood who the Messiah was he understood who Christ was and he had not yet gone to Pentecost so you got to understand that this revelation that God has given to us by way of Malachi 4 should never leave your heart now if it's just in your life Satan can come and take it because that's where Satan battles us it that right the private God tells us that the greatest battle ever fought is in your mind it is where Satan deceived Eve in her mind and that's where the devil comes and deceives us in our minds for Paul understanding predestination Paul understood that the subjects of of suffering and and in gone rejection and all of the things that he had gone through he understood that this was just a journey he had to go through that he was in Christ and Christ was in him and so Paul understood nothing of laws no laws y'all better than him no laws can separate him from the love of God no laws is that Ted touch not taste not handle not that's not it the church ages showed us that no matter how much they touch not taste not a handle not there was still many of them who was still lost and they did everything right hello ah you say what do you mean because salvation does not come by you salvation only comes by being elected and chosen from the foundation of the world it is that that election that perfection the understand me coz when God chose you he did not make a mistake it is that election that takes you from this dimension into the next dimension I'm feeling coming to something in just a moment just listening to Hebrews a7 with the prophet of God is telling us about the lady 5 6 and 7 with a lady who had been raised in a Christian family and here he is Amen in this particular restaurant here's the police over at the slot machine he got his arm around this lady this young girl about 27 years old this one lady she's got her hair blue nails blue whatever everything was blue and here she was about 65 to 70 years old he said the wrinkles was everywhere he said even had these little bitty and she had so many wrinkles they were kind of layered a layered and he thought to himself he says oh my god why don't you do something about this now I'm paraphrasing it he said they all drunk what about this little girl over here what about this young man over here these are bad examples and they will become what they're looking at and brother Brennan says listen I just wanted God to do something he said all of a sudden I saw something were living for me what was it God was giving him a vision he was getting ready to have a real I couldn't conference with God so when this thing took place he began to see himself see God then show him the woman God showed him himself see before you points fingers of judgment and somebody else God will show you you right because none of us are in a place to judge one another Oh nobody has a heaven to put anybody in none of us you understand me so here was a prophet come on somebody a man who thought that he was in such a condition with God he was okay you don't think he thought that he did if you really listen to the conversation when God began to show him his sin he said oh my did I do that thought I didn't mean to do that y'all pay attention I didn't mean to do that right and what took place amen God began to show him his sin and when he said he said I said my sin would go up before God and that's I would see the blood he said it was a blood veil the blood veil that blocked his sins from God he said every time my sin would go up it was shake a minute and Jesus would wipe it off hallelujah he said I saw a book and that book had all kinds of letters written down sins that I had done hello somebody help me here I've tried to show you something because when God chooses you he has chosen you to be perfect and he has provided a way for you to be perfect this perfection does not come by you're doing good things or you're doing bad things this perfection only comes by the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah and here the Prophet is looking and he's looking and and and and and he says all of a sudden Jesus takes the blood and place it on his shin on the book and throw the books behind and he said in the sea of forgetfulness and then God comes and said now I forgave you but you wanted to send her to hell or you want to let make her just disappear he said all my god did I do that see he wasn't even aware because when you condemn someone you're literally condemning them to hell somebody help me because somebody you couldn't if they're condemned where do you think they're going but in our consciousness we're not aware of what we're doing sometimes my judgment is far harsh than what we think but God is pure God she's a very intent of the heart he goes beyond your feelings and he sees a very thought that you have and what that thought will bring to pass if it was performed but what brother Branham did see because he said Lord how do I know who the witness - how do I know who is elected somebody help me because when you speak the word to somebody they may hear and they may not hear but that is no way for you to judge well I spoke to them the word and they rejected it so they lost no sir sometimes it take a long time for a son and daughter of God to recognize they are sons and daughters of God hallelujah so you gotta realize by God's grace his lady was saved and she forgot she was saved hello you see because the blood of Jesus Christ can only truly be how could I say it received by those whom God elected and chosen to receive it and he was elated who wants new Jesus she testifies but daddy was a preacher I grew up in a Christian home and because of things that happen in my life this is what I become see it doesn't matter somebody like backslide they may be a come to be a streetwalker or a murderer or whatever but still in the inside of the inside there is a chosen seed of God that will not allow them to die y'all hear me without God making it right I didn't say him making he making it right God making it right let me jump to another point remember brother man who said this preacher who once preached became an alcoholic and because he wouldn't wouldn't repent God took his life he said the man was saved she is beyond our comprehension because we want to look at people say oh there's no way he could be saved you don't know whose names are on the book it is Jesus Christ whose nor knows whose names are on the book somebody help me here see I want you to understand like the brother brother Levin said it is a call for a man to go to hell he has to fight his way there do y'all believe that I believe that in order for a man or woman to go to hell they have to fight their way their God do not he does not make it easy for you to go to hell somebody help me now if y'all don't shout I am I'm holding my feet down right now my point is because you know we we find ourselves we find ourselves so saddened because we find ourselves as failures we feel every day and failing is not a good thing but God will is not for us to walk with our heads down in a world of sadness you understand me when we walk in sadness we literally forget what our atonement has done what the blood sacrifice has done for us the blood sacrifice did not restore us and bring us to an atmosphere where God you said it means that you someone you lost the vision of your sacrifice y'all know what I mean by that you lost the vision you forgot God died for you you forgot that he took all your sins upon him we forgotten that he is our escape goat Lord restore to me the joy of salvation you understand me because we are not lost we are saved and God wants us that's what Paul said forgetting all these doctrines doctor the baptism doctrine of lean on his doctor that's all good all of that has played its part he's in but let us move on to perfection and there is only one perfection and that's Jesus Christ himself and when the Holy Ghost comes in and Sheils you you are protected not your flesh no flesh is condemned but your sue is perfected and God wants us to walk as though we're perfected help me Jesus ain't no looking looking back God's died once and for all hallelujah let me go on because remember brother man said that man was saved God couldn't get him to repent so God put him to sleep hallelujah and here was this woman she was out of her time she should have been living in this day the way she was dressed blue hair blue wherever blue whatever any man and drinking herself to death and we're gonna look at that woman cuz this the way we look at people with tattoos we you know it scares us sometime when we see so many tattoos now I'm talking about myself you know when I see so many tattoos it just like world what's on the inside of that house that's the way I think called those tattoos is an expression of something something inspiring them to do that hallelujah but they cannot be no worse than Legion oh come on somebody and we saw somebody running around as naked as Legion we would know that their demon possessed and they going to hell but Legion didn't go to hell hallelujah somebody help me here because Jesus crossed the sea to deliver Legion hallelujah you know how leaders became Legion we wouldn't never know brother Branham said Legion became Legion by stealing out of the offering plate and one line was added to one lie another lie and every time you lie he lies another demon came in stealing out of listen even in the prayerline you'll find out that sicknesses were brought upon people because when they were little they stole out of the offering plate even when they were Catholics you see that's what people don't understand God watched things and when people give money as unto the Lord it is as unto the Lord it's whatever the preacher does with it that's between him and God but when any soul give unto the Lord oh yeah you got to understand what I'm working with now wait let's get back to the point we're trying to make here was this woman away of course and she said do you think God would forgive me brother and said surely God will forgive you he showed me God loves the money when you in that condition sometimes like that lady said I wanted to come down to the meeting but she felt so bad because of all of her sins she just thought God had forgotten about her but God didn't God will never leave you no will he forsake you he said I'll be with you always to the end is that right if a man believed in me and confess with his mouth the Bible says he's in have passed from death unto life Oh somebody help me man I know this by but I have to do this this morning because in order to bring the joy back you've got to look at your sacrifice and recognize you are free that right the Bible said Jesus Christ has made us free from the laws of sin and death it is in Christ Jesus that the grace of God has saved you it's not by power not by mind but by his spirit saith the Lord don't get me wrong a true believer always wanted right before God and as soon as we make mistakes we sell or forgive us hallelujah do we have to feel a whirling wind no sir do we have to hear thunder no sir hallelujah we just have to make sure that our coming from our heart you mean it when it's a sincere confession God takes whatever you've done and throw it away see what we don't understand is that God is not a God of time and he always know when you gonna confess that's why he gives you the Holy Ghost cuz he know you wont to do right hallelujah and God don't run up and he said all there's another sin oh there's another sin the Bible said once and for all from the time you're saved to the time you die God has collected all those sins and put them in the sea of forgetfulness you are walking free and you don't even know it hallelujah you're just like Johnny crow ain't meant thinking that you're not free oh I've been tied to this habit for a long time and God don't already cut the cord yeah see it's your thought it's your mind that keeps you in prison to the things that you've done and you declare you're not doing penton's but whenever you get down the pray and you're not already confess your sins and then you let the devil come and bring those sins back up that's penton's you gonna all the way back years and God he's standing there like what are you talking about you're not already confessed this hallelujah why you letting the devil bring this up I can't even remember it because I put it in the sea of forgetfulness why are you remembering it I'm asked that question can you change what you've done already ain't no use in remembering it then it's finished hallelujah listen probably gosh him he says the greatest weapon was ever put in the hands of land is the Bible to be backed up with the Holy Spirit now a lot of people don't even believe in this Bible anymore they said you don't have to read this no more you got the spoken word but they got that understand the spoken word came from here you understand me amen you got to understand this Bible and the spoken word must agree because nobody can add and nobody can take away it must agree so you and I must understand and then you got to do both you got to read both of these hallelujah and even if you read the prophets message you can say oh I got the revelation you know he can say it one way without the Holy Spirit you miss understanding you got to have the Holy Ghost in order to understand what brother Branham says that's why we got all this confusion that's why we got great men of God thinking they're eight messengers only seven stars and somebody made an eighth one yeah I'm just saying so you got to realize by God's grace that I know I'm working with spirits people let me tell you something since I've started in this series about trying to show people who Jesus Christ really is I have had so many demonic attacks from the devil amen that I have to make sure I carry a smile on my face it's been just that intense you know why because it has the name of Jesus that demons tremble is that right even your prophet our prophet showed that he said remember those witches Amen that had the table in the chance floating in the air he said in the name of Trinity in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost in the name of William Branham he said nothing but he said when I said in the name of Jesus Christ he said that chan cable fell breaking his legs and so I'm not Antichrist I'm standing for what he stood for oh and I know I'm different somebody told me I don't know where the stood a said this this big old regional storm that we had they said they named it Isaiah there came in tearing it up hallelujah Oh God of all my years I've never heard a storm called Isaiah but the Lord has showed me I'm actually going against a lot of people's ideas and thoughts and I'm causing a lot of trouble but it ain't me is God in me if we're gonna make a rapture we must bear the name of Jesus Christ and people think I'm coming against William Branham do I look like a fool to you I'm not one I know what I'm saying and I know the inspiration I'm saying this in somebody help me here so I want you to understand by God's grace I do what I do by the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ and I know where I'm headed I know what's happening here the Lord has already showed me and I didn't even see it but when even I asked Peter he said Peter who do men say that I am he says son saying you are Jeremiah some say that you Elias some say you one of the prophets see even those who said he was a prophet they saw the mighty works he did but that wasn't the answer he was looking for we know brother Branham is a prophet we've seen his life his work everything nothing can deny that but was he projecting himself or was he preaching like powell paul said i say i don't want to know nothing save jesus christ and him crucified and brother brandon said i have preached exactly what paul preached and all heaven said we are resting on that hallelujah now if i got up here and i told you to stop listening to the message then you have a right to walk out this door if I came up here and said well I don't believe william branham was a the messenger of the hour you have a right to walk out of this door hallelujah but i know he's a messenger nobody taught me this nobody school taught me this no preacher talked to me got me this my Holy Ghost showed me who he was I was really cute by my own people called me a brand might call me a fanatic call me everything else because I saw who William Branham was but it never stopped there no it doesn't stop there because that's what John disciples did they stopped with John and John pointed to Jesus somebody helped me here and those who follow Jesus got Jesus blessings there was years later they found John disciple still believing in John hallelujah and Paul said unto what baptism have you been baptized hallelujah it was a good baptism but you got to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ somebody help me here Paul said it is this okay so I want you to understand you must understand the word brother been said this word represents the man who I got a quote for it he said the Bible is a man and the church is a woman he said this man will never lead you wrong but the woman led man wrong see what I'm trying to say is there are churches who are leading wrong because they're the ones leading and not the pastor will somebody help me here see what I'm trying to say and the pastor has been led by Christ not 19 hey if you don't have the anointing you're not being led by Christ and there's a lot of preachers who need the Holy Ghost they have fallen in tradition let me move on cuz you know yo I'm just trying to I can't rush it the Lord said you got to take your time because there's so many people who have been taught such a way till it's very difficult for them to comprehend what you're saying because there's such a fine line you understand me there was a time when God was working with brother Branham till it was absolutely God but guess what the Prophet says I didn't do nothing it was him youngest and me so you got to understand now if you're gonna believe everything brother bear I'm saying you got to believe those kind of statements to Jesus Christ did at all oh he made william branham he made you he made all of us do you believe that that that when did Jesus ever tell a lie he never told a lie brother Branham did when did Jesus ever was oh I was gonna kill him that man that killed my dog I was gonna kill him I was waiting on him I had my shotgun and the thing is that right he said but I got converted at what point in time Jesus got converted somebody help me here you know what I'm trying to show you so that you can see where you are how you gonna understand william branham in the God in william branham you never you don't understand that you'll never understand you you'll never understand where God is calling you to hallelujah Oh somebody help me yeah I feel excited because I know see what I'm seeing makes me know nothing can separate me from the love of God I didn't give my Shep this revelation Jesus Christ gave me this revelation and I know because of this revelation I don't have to look back and what God did I'm looking right now and what God is doing I don't have to look forward cuz he doesn't already told me what he's gonna do but right now we need to see Christ in all of us hallelujah you love the Lord you know I got this scripture down and I'm gonna just run through it quickly Matthew 1:21 and we know this and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now brother Branham said this he said if you read this Bible and you don't see Jesus on every page basically he said go back and read it why didn't he say if you don't see me he said if you don't see Jesus in men cancer that he said Jesus was mezcal today in its theophany form y'all huh he had no beginning of days and no end and them nights but you got people said what brother bands was like hesitate if he was it was only because the kisser dick was in it he was the bottle and Makassar that was the wine you understanding and people are so afraid if you say that wrong brothers you gonna blaspheme the Holy Ghost the elected cannot blaspheme the Holy Ghost and you and I must understand if I blaspheme the Holy Ghost it was ordained for me to do so but how can the Holy Ghost blaspheme the Holy Ghost mmm but people afraid and they don't understand the spirit there's a spirit that makes you afraid to tell the truth and in this day of time you know what I fear I feel God y'all want a revival you got to pick up the name of Jesus Christ again you got to start talking about Jesus mr. two people are all brothers you just taking this thing too far I'm gonna tell you something there was only one who was able to loosen or open the book and loose the seals thereof nobody in our generation nobody before our generation was able to loose this only one and who was in heaven all of the twenty-four elders fell down on their faces worshiping the lamb worshiping the lamb and who was the Lamb of God John said the lamb was Jesus and when John came he meant to worship the angel he said get up from there and worship God only and we said oh that was brother Branham it was brother Branham that's the scripture that shows who he was he didn't have a name but we now know the name but if his message was to worship God only why are we worshiping something else and one brother I guess he got so mad with me he said thank God for Jesus Christ in the form of brother Branham and I thought in some ways that's true but not in all ways and you say well what'd you talk about but thank God for Jesus Christ in the form of my sister Naomi you got to bring it personally you can't just keep it with one man because it becomes idolatry somebody help me here see you got to understand that if he was the waist sheet that means war was to come well where is the more hmm that's why he went off to pry off the scene because he said people were worshipping him y'all understand me and these were all praise God i worshipping William Branham let me ask you a question and I I gotta treat you like he said it how many times a day you call on Jesus versus the days you call them William Branham case dismissed and we'll say what brother Brando he'll does person brother brand I'm healed that person brother man said I never healed nobody he said Jesus Christ never healed anybody he said it was God who healed because Jesus said I have done nothing he said he worked and then I work here the - in other words he showed me what I wants to be done and then I do what he wants me to do none of y'all I don't care if you lay hands on the seat please god I laid my hand on the sick and they recovered so I you didn't heal nobody only God can heal now people am I right or wrong I'm still preaching the message that brother Branham preached he breached Jesus Christ but that was his thing Hebrews 13 and 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever everybody said if I use his name I'm getting to heaven let me tell you something in the days of Jesus that was still using the name of Moses they were still using the name of Abraham and Jesus called them Devils hello he had to tell me for Abraham was I am oh god help us I know I'm making preachers mad but let me tell you something like this if you put all the Grace on brother Branham and fail to give yourself son you won't make it and there's so many people believe that they don't even know it need the Holy Ghost no more but I'm here you here to tell you your prophet had to get the Holy Ghost and he did and so do you now I'm working on the message right now this perfection because I want you to understand the perfection that God speaks up is not because of you you can't perfect yourself don't even try Pharisees thought they could perfect themselves and what they became still starchy and hateful it's the truth most religious spirits are hateful they mean just do one thing that they don't like they'll call you into question and they don't forgot they'd forgotten its mercy and grace that brought them this far you don't believe me the scripture proves it caught that lady in adultery brought in before Jesus that's why I say Devils don't always bring in a job a Saints don't always bring the church sometimes Devils drive you there but once once you get in the presence of God and you elected it's alright you don't care how you get there as long you get there there is a listen listening I want you to know I'm come on this is not him on my nose but he says listen he writes in the sand let him without sin cast the first stone and People of God if that's the way Jesus judged it then that's the way he judges it now is that right he's the same yesterday today and forever let him without sin cast the first Oh Hebrews 13 and eight yesterday today and forever the same hmm let me read this he is this okay now he goes on in he says Amen in the Hebrew he says by the Holy Spirit baptism we are baptized into that body and are free from sin God doesn't see you no more he only see Christ and when you in that body God can't judge that body he's already judged it Oh y'all come oh when it gives you the Holy Ghost the body is already judged so when you make mistakes you've been judged already and forgiven cuz he gave you the Holy Ghost somebody help me that holy ghost that seal cannot be broken the blood covers you is that right that's what the prophecy said when the blood is covering you God can't even see your sin so why are you looking at them hmm you know I'm telling you all y'all some of y'all lookin with them sad faces but y'all ought to be happy that God is setting you free I ain't choking and neither am i stuttering I know y'all understand it I'm trying to give you something that will liberate you you'll start listening to those tapes in a different way you'll start hearing the prophets voice in a different way you get to listening to those tapes and you won't be bored oh god I better listen to a tape today oh do you just all of a sudden just old god I better eat today some people forget to eat I don't you can tell that right I got a few friends of mine they thin too cuz they forget to eat but you see I don't forget to eat if anything I got to remind myself not to eat so much you know but that's the truth and that's how he is in a message some people in the message they forget to eat and then you find them being Christians spiritually right yeah I'm a fatted calf I could steer kick you know that's just the way it goes Amen here he said God don't see you no more he only sees Christ and when you in the body God can't judge the body he's already judged it he took our judgment and invited us in and by faith through grace we walk and accept our pardoning that's the key I always accept your pardoning always accept your forgiveness oh I don't get it too long and updated too much you could never do it too long you could never do it too much because when it gets too much God will stop you when I look at Samson anything you know how bad we don't we don't know what all Samson did but whatever he did got in a bad situation and all he had to do is a little lord once more and I believe that with all my heart those of us Amen who need a revival you need to cry out Oh Lord once more give me that revival give me that fire that I used to have hallelujah and when you in this body can't judge in the morn no sir and the Holy Spirit brings us into this fellowship with him and we walk no more after the things of the world but we walk in the spirit quicken the word came to us he died in my stead I'm made alive Here I am who wants who was once dead in sin and trespasses been made alot how do you know you made a lie how do you know my house you thirst for righteousness that thirst for righteousness skin you is a sign you are alive you can't be doing in thirsty at the same time but that's thirsting you for righteousness because no devil in hell is thirsting for righteousness only those who have been quickened to life thirst after righteousness and God said if you thirst after this righteousness you shall be filled hallelujah we walk and accept our pardoning and the Holy Spirit brings us into the fellowship and we walk to we and we walk no more after the things of the world but we walk in the spirit quickened the word came to us and that's what a lot of times people think well when I get first saved then I'm going everything drops no God got a sanctified you that's what people say oh I got the Holy Ghost yes in a portion cuz that portion brought you to life but you've got to be sanctified that same Holy Ghost is there become becomes your conscious that's wrong that's wrong you didn't say that right do that right where this where that that's God in you bring you where into perfection it's bringing you into perfection and just like in the message say to need and I think it was brother Keith that told me about it but it's true when you get to it there's a place you can get in God will God will veil you with such a holy veil to use these things that we see out in the world will not affect you at all it won't affect you you can see somebody naked or honest but you'll fail that God then place on you is so holy it will not affect you somebody help me here but if you still cover with the last value I don't care how holy you try to be you go continue to last last last last that means the veil must be changed whoa help me Jesus and the only way that veil can be changed is that God brings you from glory to glory to glory is that right you said all what are you saying don't you know that even brother Bradley had to wear a cross in front of his car to keep his holy veil to keep that veil holy somebody help me here see you know a lot of times people say the man went yes he was tempted just like everybody else you think why don't you come on people you think he was because he was such a man he didn't go through nothing he did why do you think it's all he said now listen he said certain things he could he said I couldn't never do cuz I love her so much so what was that love but the veil of God sighing love is the veil of God Oh help me Lord what was it he said listen and we walked we will walk no more after the things of the world but we walk in the spirit quicken the words quicken see Lester that's to keep quicken the world came to us he died in my stead I mean I made alive Here I am and that's the thing some of us we walking like we still dead but when Christ is in you you are alive and the Bible says there is no condemnation to those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so if you begin to walk after the spirit you may make mistakes but there is no condemnation hmm I'm almost done I gotta preach this evening he said my desires is to serve Him he said Here I am who was once dead in sin and trespasses been made alive all my desire is to serve Him how many of us can say that today oh my desire is to serve Him hallelujah is that Alright all my desire is to serve Him ooh that's pretty good all my love is to him all my walks want to be in his name that whenever I go wherever I go whatever I do i glorify him if I'm hunting if I'm fishing if I'm playing ball if whatever I'm doing I must be Christ in me in such a life that will make me long to be that way not tattling and backbiting and fussing about your churches whoa he said you get it one spirit we are baptized into that body and when I see the blood I'll pass over you see us Christ in you hallelujah Oh can I read another one he said if that could make the person perfect and God requires perfection they did couple it worked laws he said if keeping the laws if doing the commandments would make you perfect then there's no need there's no need of having anything else you've already made perfect because when you're perfect you're eternal in other words you are eternal God is the only one is eternal and God is the only one perfect and the only way you can be eternal is to become part of God this is what he said once purged no conscience of sin what the worshiper once purged - I have no conscience if you write the translation of that it's desire the worshiper once purged has no desire to sin now how many of us have desires to see it none of us that means God has purged you you and I don't willfully sin we do things out of weaknesses but glory to God thank you Jesus for the blood did you know brother Branham was telling that woman when he talked to her with the purply only that the blood was still protecting her back slidden is all get-out and the blood of Jesus Christ was perfect for protecting her that's why we say oh this person you know they show backslidden and you could see God still taking care of him he always will it won't matter or they ought to die now no God don't care about what you think about it it's who he has declared as being sons and daughters of God he will Wayne's protective zone oh Jesus help me Lord is this okay and what we must understand that if you know that's that's the truth if you want to that's one of the true because you can't what what defines the Holy Spirit the evidence the Holy Ghost is living the life really that's what it's all about living the life brother had said when he said don't listen he said don't try to have any sensations or anything to take the place of the Holy Spirit when the new birth is calm he said when the new birth is calm you are changed you don't have to do anything to prove it your life proves it as you walk your love peace long-suffering gentleness meekness patience that's what you are and the whole world sees the reflection of Jesus Christ in you oh come on somebody hey you know I love to shout I love to dance I love tongues interpretation of tongues I love prophecy I love it all but you know the devil can do it all he can imitate all of that I'm not calling the Holy Spirit I'm telling the vessel could be a devil and still do it all hmm but the life the life of Christ only a true believer can live it will help me Jesus listen he said the Bible says come out of them be ye separate saith God see you're not of that and when that new nature comes in you you don't have to be pulled out you don't want to go back like Lot's wife you just born out of it you're born out of it right y'all get it and you're in or not this is part of like another dimension I like that because often time I feel that's just the way it is I'm just in another dimension I'm seeing things that other people ain't seeing I'm top of the world they don't see what I see this message is not a stumbling block to me this message taking me higher and higher and higher in Christ Jesus from glory to glory to glory in Christ Jesus hallelujah listen and he goes on and say listen he says you don't want to go back like Lot's wife you just born out of it and you're in another dimension and that looks trashy to you and this this great fabulous America that we live in has become one of the big chaos of it everything is lust in women and women the way they're dressing and the men the way they're acting and the things they're doing and then call themselves Christians so when a real Christian born-again Christian all this junk becomes trash to you I'm gonna stop here but I'm trying to bring something to you we must if we are the body of Christ Jesus Christ understand me he became our sin that we might become his righteousness and now the only body Jesus have is what what we see here and everywhere else those who are truly born again they are the body of Christ because the Bible says they are baptized into one body by one spirit and God justifies you then he sanctifies you then he feels you right so let me throw this at you he that begun the good work in you is faithful to completed why should I worry let me tell you all something if you don't know it doesn't matter when it comes to where we think somebody right or wrong it is just like let me say like this if we took the Old Testament and we go down to Old Testament you see all those who stood for Jesus who stood for God and how many mistakes they made now watch this because even even when it came to Naomi and Ruth in all them they were among idol worshippers a people ha ha how comfortable were they in a place where they were sacrificing babies Moloch and all of the rest you understand me and yet they still regard people in such a myth and at that opponent time God called them out all of us have been guilty we all in some way was a party we weren't in the Church of Laodicea we was part of the spirit of and God called all of us out why because we were his people and not one of us let me put it this way when you're baking cakes you have measuring cups right and those measuring cups is a set that you work with now I could take a a couple of a cup and measure what 1/2 a cup is or in my mind but no there's a designated size cup it's called 1/2 a cup you got 1/3 cup y'all understand what I'm saying my point is all of us may not be a full cup we may not be a whole cup we may be a half a cup but God gonna use you God gonna use the third and God gonna use he's in the baking process he's breaking bread y'all understand me I'm trying to tell you in other words we measure ourself there's no way I half a cup can become a whole cup yes I have up just make sure you're half a cup is full but some of y'all might be a little teaspoon or tablespoon but make sure you know when I when I measure it up y'all I y'all got when I measured so I make sure it's er easy it's right cuz when I measure right I know it's gonna come out right so what I'm trying to say is folks we are all different yet we are all alike and we're all here been placed to do what manifests Jesus Christ hallelujah and you've heard me say this many times I've gone to churches and and I'm cold and believe it or not I am I'm gonna make this one state man see having brother branham picture up here y'all know who I'm come on but if I were to stay having a pillow fire up here cuz you know that's the picture the pillar fire brother Brenda was just in the picture is that right brother Brown said he took his picture with me he does that I took my picture with him he took his picture with me and so many times people can get offended by this because they don't understand the revelation they don't understand what that light is that ain't something somebody colored in or coloured out that was God out of all the ages took a picture allowed a non-believer to take that picture to make him a believer we would have never known now I say like this some of y'all may have not seen the pill if I I've seen the pill afire more than once when I first came to the message I've seen the pillar fire so I don't have to wonder whether this is right I know it's right before I came to this message I saw Christ in a a dream he looked like that so I don't care so myself I don't believe he look like that I believe he's black with kinky hair my thing is who cares who cares he saved my life I wouldn't care if he was striped with polka dots I wouldn't care he saved my life I talked to a guy yesterday and you know he was biracial he started with this black stuff I say color on me nothing I kind of raised my voice a little bit I say colored on me nothing I say it's character that's what matters character they're bad people black bad people who write bad people amen sharpens coming every color if Jesus was black and kinky here what good is gonna do me I still got to be born again people so silly love with you I shouldn't say that but I say you know what I said you know I told y'all hope y'all don't mind me saying this I said the black people were deceived because they believed that the white man was superior and the white man was too DC because he believed he was superior why are you saying like that because my brother my prophet said there is no superior race and I believe what he says and a black man can give a black a white man blood transfusion and vice versa so whether you like it or not I'm all in the family it is the way it goes yo so what I'm trying to say let me get you this my point having these pictures even across shut up does not make us a message Church yeah and I come to be where y'all where's the pillar cloud we have to peel I heard a Brad a brother come to my church say you ain't in the messenger cuz you don't even have the cloud up I had years ago a man coming to my church in our church in South Carolina he walked in he said just don't look like a message Church come on what does Church look like he is he is come on somebody you gotta realize you the church you are the message eat the book eat the book and then prophesy again you know how honestly I do I get so tired of people with racial comments and all that I'm not prejudiced I've never been prejudiced right and and and and I was raised in our area where I should have been perhaps but one thing I am prejudiced about and that's Jesus Christ I'm here to glorify Him only if I got some Long's if I got some differences it's when I see and I get jealous and I like I told her brother the other day I don't care if you say brother branham name 1000 times as long as you say Jesus Christ mm the name of William Branham doesn't stumble me cuz I know who he is but I get him I get something you know I was telling the brother say if I was sitting in the audience I would have known who you was talking about but I need to after hearing you preach I need to know who you were talking about well you talking about Jesus Christ Oh were you talking about just the Prophet now I don't care if you bring them together just bring them together give me a full picture that's all I'm saying don't make it once I did bring the Jesus Christ in there like Paul did that brother branham did is that right I know I'm sounding crazy but I'm saying it gotta be Christ in you the hope of glory what brought me brother Brandon was Christ in him and what makes you would be Christ in you otherwise you're finished you love the Lord the the man but Christ Jesus must become you let's stand you know I I know people don't understand I'm trying I can't get grant you revelation that's Jesus Jesus Christ is the only one that can give us a revelation and what I'm saying is not indeed it ain't deep it's just there right in your face been there all the time but I tell you where we where we men aren't when we went off and there was a time when brother Branham lived their message was God sent a prophet we never changed it you understand me because at that day and time he needed to know right come see the man you understand me and that was all right because Christ was in it but then when Jesus died and he rose again Paul said we don't know no man after the flesh anymore only Christ the God that was in Jesus that's when we come to know and that's what we need to know that God that was in William Branham is what we need to know who he who we need to know we need to know Jesus him that one that was in him the one who broke up every revelation did you know that one time the prophet of God believed in Trinity Oh in the Old Testament in the old tapes he believed in Trinity who broke the revelation to him it was God see if people say oh I believe every word he said well at that time he was right with what he understood but he was progressive in his revelation I'm not here to question anything I'm just saying I know that I'm getting the portion of the message I'm supposed to get they got what they were supposed to get I'm getting what I supposed to get you're getting what you're supposed to get hmm I think people just so concerned about just dumb stuff dumb people arguing about where the bridge didn't collapse and the people didn't die who cares who cares they say he wasn't there when when the cane just showed up in the I say let me tell you something let me give you one answer for that when people bring that nonsense to you ask them were you at Phillips revival I know you saw him there but did you see Philip when he disappeared and went into the desert and then he came back and said don't you know what I was just in the desert I just preached through the unit he was old no ain't no way feeling I just saw you five minutes ago you understand me if he said he was there he was there it ain't listen what I'm trying to say is there were so many supernatural elements happening during that time how you gonna say he wasn't there explained to me if y'all go up to finger are that finger point up in Arizona tell me how that man got up on that mountain old man there are mysteries so let me say like this thing that only the spiritual mind would catch because when people kind of tell me that over here under there I said what Moses wasn't there either but he wrote all the Old Testament he was a prophet they saw what let me tell you what he said Enoch Moses Noah saw Enoch and what they had two timelines I say hello so as we umbrella Eve and he said he saw Eve what do you think he dropped those things in there for so we can see that if it's the latter it'll kill you but it's the spirit that gives life and we saw easy saw E and if Moses saw the creation throw the Bible away then because you gotta rest in faith somewhere and if inna a boat nor saw Enoch he saw him he was a prophet brother ban who says tada boy who had those look blue jeans on he says oh yeah you live in this house the baby got a little blue jeans and when I when the Lord healed him he have this chocolate milk or some kind of milk around his mouth and everything and anyways the daddy said brother have you been there you've been at my house before he said I was just there a few minutes ago Oh somebody help me here he said just a few minutes he said there's some kind of he said there's a spirit that takes me day these are intellectual demons trying to make the saints of God out you just take trust God and God to bring you out folks a while when he made mistakes I said let me tell you something he is so in the Bible all through Revelation the seven angels doing every kind of stuff I said he made it on his air I'm holding tight cuz if he made it I'm making it too right that's right I ain't letting it go to your bless me so I you know these people they just they ordained to be this way don't let nobody turn your mind against this message it's 100 percent right whether you can understand it or not it ain't about that is believing it have faith that God didn't make no mistake when he sent Malachi 4 and the word that he preached is Jesus Christ and that message will get you into the gate it's by grace you know you love the Lord everybody you said what brothers like you said everybody can't hear let me a little a little a little a little just a little revelation a little something Jesus says my sheep hear it my voice can you hear his voice then you are the Sheep of God that's how simple it is hallelujah and death hell
