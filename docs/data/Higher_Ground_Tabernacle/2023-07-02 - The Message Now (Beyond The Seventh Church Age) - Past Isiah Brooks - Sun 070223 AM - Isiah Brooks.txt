and Joseph you all understand [Music] amen you're welcome and we like I'm gonna tell you come with your anointing right and I trust that's not a dead one but we want you to enjoy yourself and you know in the church you have three kinds of Believers stay with the Believers don't work with the make-believers there's no work with the non-believers if you got a fire burning keep it burning amen so once again we welcome you and of course I'm Pastor Isaiah Brooks and it's going to take me a while to know who you are I mean by name so if if if I just call your sister and brother uh we honor you until we come to know your name amen thank you Hallelujah I've been to South Africa and I've been to different places a short trip it's your secret sometimes it takes days to get over the jet lag I don't know how long you've been here for um you love the Lord amen glad to see our brother isai here it's kind of resting a little bit longer position appreciate you amen as we stand we'll go right on into the word of God I was told that you enjoyed the word last week my son who was in California uh he was able to listen online but before I go any further yeah she she's amazing I mean um and I know that God gave me my wife we've been married 47 years so still kicking hello and so I thank God foreign [Music] now as we stand let us turn to the scripture we're going to go to Genesis first and from there we'll run to Revelations Genesis 21 through 22.7 laughs Genesis 3 21-22. also into his wife did the Lord make coats of skins and cloth clothed them and the Lord God said behold the man has become as one of us to no good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever it is [Music] foreign for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life is not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved upon voice he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not already because he have not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God and this is the condemnation the light is coming to the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil is for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deed should be his deeds should be reproved is Revelations 5 apocalypse will begin reading at the fourth verse and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon is [Music] and one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of Judah excuse me Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David have prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof is [Music] low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the eldest stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into the Earth [Music] and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne Foundation amen amen you may be seated I'll try to take my time by the grace of God just talking with others the other day Psalm the other day kind of made me think on on thoughts that I'm going to bring forth this morning this is a serious time um and I fear that so many people they're not seeing the time that we're living in Nevada um I've been studying and reading Jeremiah and uh Jeremiah Was A a mighty man of God sit down prophet and in that book it also leave them in reading it on on the design all I could see is today all of the events to Elizabeth basically that took place in Jeremiah's writing those things unfolding uh as God spoke to Israel Israel he's now speaking to the spirituals Israel Israel spiritual I heard brother Branham City any in paraphrasing he said Christ was in Jeremiah Christ was in Moses Christ was in all of the prophets of old Christ and I thought to myself then how can a preacher do not preach on sin if Jeremiah's anointing see uh that that was in Jeremiah it's also in Christ y'all hear what I'm saying and think about it God sent us on foreign uh he he and I'm not I'm just saying because we must understand that if you don't see this message that's what I'm talking about you're seeing that God sent a prophets what he preached you will miss it hallelujah amen now the prophet of God he told us scientifically oh scientific moment there's one out of a million that makes it to the birth I'm making this a Doctrine but he's yet and still man he he repeats that times through different messages now I want to say it like this my message to today is the message we know that we are beyond the seventh Church age we are in what we call the bride but but saying we're in the body Hallelujah you see we we we must understand that the book is open to there and we must understand that revelation of Revelations it's a book of symbols you can't just literally take it for what it says it has to reveal to you let those symbols song and what they mean I heard the prophet say that basically we're in the last episode the last episode of the book The episode and he goes on to say it like this when when justification Luther's age was over there and when Ed Wesley's Aid was over he had to die and the Pentecostal lady is why the book had to be opened it had to be revealed I was not doing a new thing okay [Music] Hallelujah you say you mean to tell me people can follow the message and not have the revelation of what it is absolutely absolutely more Millions followed Moses millions of people followed Moses Millions let's bring it to our modern terms I'm not going to millions of Christians and only two out of that generation millions of Christians you understand what they were being led into Hallelujah didn't bring us just a Pentecostal message that will bring us into a Perfection an experience foreign [Applause] remember the book was shut it was closed but we find out foreign there was a door that was shot now the door is open so you got to find out who is the door and who is the book right because the door open door wasn't just opened to peer into it see it's not enough to say I can quote brother Brown [Music] hallelujah amen and you can't get it there by education Hallelujah to most people that talk just just sick of it Hallelujah is that right right yeah we had we had a intellectual Revival all of us we probably know some of the most deepest things didn't even know it was in the Bible it will never how many Christians don't even believe that God is God uh to the least little things little things Hallelujah when the Bible says if you abide in me foreign like let me move on this is what I won't say so God opened this message and the message brother Bantam tells us can be found throughout the Bible shadows and in types to form the deep in the zombie you've heard me preach on Esther and when Esther walked into the the king's uh throne room you heard me talk about how there was a moment of silence because you know he was the but that's not true silence it's when you don't want no uh someone else it's like when somebody talks to you yeah well you're listening and whatever they tell you to do it but that silence that's where you don't want anybody to know what you're doing disgrace [Music] amen hallelujah remember during this time of Elijah might woman yeah judgment had already struck Israel and around surrounding area [Music] then came Elijah and what happens when this woman sees Elijah he offers him water is that right that's right see when you get the message you gotta you gotta bring something take from it and Elijah said woman go go go fetch me some cakes but understand s God is working on both ends who else is around her husband is dead fix me buy cakes first you starving I said me and my son we're going to eat the last of this is sometimes y'all know they're so free as that you could have a bag of cookies and somebody asked for some and you act like what's wrong with you on the bus quick example um I think about it I want everybody to think about it in the condition that you're in now spiritually conditions would you be a blessing to Heaven there's no unclean thing is going to be there oh yeah oh let me move on I know this is why I want to see people say well I I let me move on this one I gotta preach it the way you said it um so we understand that we understand the oil we understand the meal offering yeah and the connections until she could perceived he was a true man of God a man you know it's amazing I'll see Matthew I could go preach this in a denomination of church but the message has become so common which shows it's a danger zone because when I was on my uh when I was on my uh little journey there we we got before the Lord and I learned a lot of things about myself and and I learned what a what a True Believer a True Believer believes every word no matter what he or she goes through every word and they love the counseling of God Judgment of God is that right for example no matter what befalls you boys Paul said in whatever state I found myself in depends he's not the only one even there's no evidence what made Brothers [Music] you gotta be proven Hallelujah let me read something out of the question and answers on the seals paragraph 114. brother Brandon says nothing will be saved no person um whose names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life for the foundation in the world see that's all the book that that mystery excuse me the book holds that mystery and the book is unfolding it now it's unfolding it now not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is calling those names did you finally understand that now if God doesn't say Isaiah foreign Hallelujah if you come to any of it and say oh you know I don't agree with that with your birth listen another quote coming from the position of a believer in Christ but by grace are you saved through faith not by the works I'm a presbyterian I'm a Baptist I'm a Pentecostal no man can break message and there's reason he knows him yeah and those who he has Justified amen there you are voila hallelujah amen Hallelujah the mystery let me stare of this whole book was hidden in the land [Music] Hallelujah you see that's the reason I read the scripture in in Genesis when when God uh found an animal and we read that uh and and and but God never said it was a lamb how did we come to know it was a Lambs it was a lamb then we were able to find it in the scripture in the Book of Revelations where it says this is this is the ultimate my Revelation that God so loved me I'm gonna say it again that God so loved you I'm gonna say it again God so loved you may and this love I'm talking about is this is why I can't see why people don't get excited you know how you faulty you faulted let me see the person who's in your determine Hallelujah now think about this and I couldn't help but in my time of quiet and silence I couldn't help but to think on uh how he loved me and you know I I said like this it was so wonderful till I saw something that I don't even realize I don't even know what it was I saw it yeah before I was born he loved me you might be a man before you were born he loved you I'm talking about eternal love now God didn't say oh my goodness as a man he died even when I was a child my mom and dad wasn't around but that was his Divine love let's see this when I moved that was his Divine love y'all hear what I'm saying some of us know it's dying love his Undying Love [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah and when he placed your name in the book never never understood why he couldn't get rid of you Hallelujah but right now the devil knows the truth you have responded to the Lamb's Book of Life this message is right that this is you hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah Roger glory to God so revelation 5. you don't do this right amen but what we fail to see in God's Minds those laws never applied because you got to realize who God justifies you understand me even in Isaiah says yeah you say oh what do you mean God's love let's see if so you understand that woman will be caught in adultery according to the law she should have been stung Hallelujah but Jesus being God where are your accusers Hallelujah [Music] amen because you'll stand there virtuously clean virtues as though you've never seen in the first place that's what you've been designed to be disease Hallelujah Revelation 5 4 through 7. he said I wealth much because no man was found worthy neither to look their own and one of the elves are said unto me Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David have prevailed to open the book if you lose the Seven Seals thereof this is said soon and the Bible has episodes you've heard me say this before when when Eliza go get Rebecca who told her to water the camels in a time of Silence when nobody knew nobody else heard it Rebecca Rebecca heard when that voice says ordered the camels too see that's how it is with the mystery of this message oh that's how it is Sheriff Hallelujah man you say tell me another one I'll tell you this morning how God is working right Among Us and a lot of us right no it's a time of urgency good to see you Sister Mary I didn't even know you were back there that's your mom isn't it okay praise the Lord Roger so anyway you know what you know it's so amazing see the moment because when God visited Abraham he came as three minutes y'all don't heard this is and and Abraham understood that was God I guarantee you if it had been 12 it's more to God than just coming here and sit in the church yeah [Music] when God discerned because I also then told Abraham he says I'm going to visit you again now in the process in this time of Silence something was taking place we would have never known it brother Brandon said he's changed from old to Young not just all too young Sarah was changed and then when he did come again he didn't visit Abraham he visited Sarah she was the one who conceived in other words in the secret time his visitation Sarah so let me say it like this this is your time of conception this is your time of conception to receive the Christen the full word hallelujah you're okay with this so anyway let's move on let's move on to Saint John 29 to 34. this is the message today Christ in you the hope of glory prepare he didn't say my daddy he included the whole family of God yeah supposed to include the whole family of God we're family more important than your natural family natural you got a real Revelation going on they say Jesus Brothers now I don't know how you feel but I feel like this is foreign Peter James and John yeah they began to Rejoice hey y'all hear what I'm saying um you don't have to understand it just know that God is in the mood save me Saint John please 129. yeah we've heard the scripture Hallelujah but for those we have some newcomers and so I want to bring this out for them the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and say and and saith Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world I know this might sound Elementary to you but this was the first time I'm really quick in that word so Jesus come to save us this is why the theme of The Prophet was this is um this is he of whom I said after me cometh the man which is prepared before me for he was before me since and so anytime you hear that word behold in other words there's something that you should see and here in the 31st verses and I knew him not but that he he should come baptizing with water is saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it Abode upon him I I just you know I think to myself you know when I see that pill of fire about but brother brother what do message people think we ought to be ashamed of ourselves God left that own record for you I wasn't there when it happened so God took a picture so that you can see and understand Hallelujah but this time [Applause] upon his head y'all hear what I'm saying that was just to show headshots [Music] [Applause] that God has visited us and he's left us a message and this thing is pleaded Pentecostal s supposed to be the shortest of all how much time we have left y'all better hear what I'm saying but we are right in the seconds but you must have like the like that old I said like brother bear said like that old colored man said the confines travel at the river Hallelujah amen I don't know John said I'd be a record he said I didn't know him to God descending this song it's amazing it's amazing because even when the pillar of fire showed up above the head of the Prophet remember but God left his own message that this message is not a man's message this message is let me hear what I'm saying and if that be true he is the last prophet is part of the mystery they said so Hallelujah God yeah Hallelujah Revelations it was completely blacked out to put a little light up there all of that life Hallelujah that's where the messages bringing to us you know we're not supposed to be this way I think systems something it's still not enough he can't satisfy your flesh and it's still not enough I remember when I was a kid my mom would give me a little piece of candy act like I didn't appreciate it out of my hands you don't appreciate what I gave you an opportunity none at all that's what she did thank God that God is not like that Hallelujah you can't come to him with some kind of attitude humbly before God the reason why it was [Music] amen Hallelujah Revelation 4 1-2 cause this is one service and I I trust you if your food is on a timer Revelations 4 1 through 2. after this I looked and behold a door was open now who is the door Kila Potter there's only one door concert even even in the Psalms where it says lift up your head they first had to find out who was the king of Glory Hallelujah foreign had such a mind I don't have it anymore he actually had the mind of God and I'm gonna cut it short in just a minute because but the Bible tells us that when God told Adam name those animals the new memes the animals had already been named by God the mind of God every animal I don't I know according to this mind of God every one of them right sorry it was God who was the head of Adam so Adam didn't say well I just want to do this he had to be like Jesus he listened to the voice of his wife that's the same thing the second Adam had to do nothing he says and listen I looked and behold the door was open in Heavens and the first voice which which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither I will show these things which must be Hereafter works so you understand John didn't just go up there near the moon um John was transported into another dimensions we thought heaven was millions of miles away right here and this is the important part he says and immediately I was in the spirit is the spirit and behold the throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne amen amen the doors Jesus Christ himself and he's telling you look inside me look inside this book we didn't know what it was um it was sealed but brother but but the uh Jesus Christ broke the seal the Lambs and then brother Brown began to preach what was hidden y'all hear what I'm saying what was he doing he whipped he went into the mind of God how did that information huge messages like Christ The Mystery of God revealed in his own words came from [Music] but one of the most significant things I'm almost done he said listen in other words I'm going to show you the next episode what was the next episode the resurrection of Jesus Christ it was no more open show he said the blue on spectacular the preaching of the Gospel to the to the uh Pharisees [Music] he had filled his disciples after the resurrection Jesus appeared to his disciples he opens the book and he began to preach to them Christ from the from all of the prophets and sages all the way up time it is again on the third day in the scriptures and by this he told them there's a greater move coming yeah um and you know a lot of people I'm almost done I'm not going to be able to finish this I finish on the other time but I'm trying to bring something because I want you to see what's so important about the lamb and I'm a closer God revealed to us in Genesis if it was Genesis in the lamb in Genesis the lamb in the Revelation here in Genesis in the Book of Revelation the lamb sets on the throne Hallelujah the same lamb that had become sacrificial King of Kings he's become the almighty God hallelujah so let me bring it to you by God see and I don't know to me it it is it this could be preached every day but until you understand what's being said let me tell you something with you we're fooling ourselves we cannot love one another Lotto [Music] oh love is sacrificial sacrifice this is why it was
