[54:50] this morning my uh my little subject
[54:54] that i wanted to preach that i want to
[54:55] preach i entitled it
[54:57] joy comes in the morning where we read
[55:01] in luke chapter 39 verse 45 verse
[55:04] luke chapter 1 verse 39 to 45
[55:08] the bible is talking about uh i read
[55:12] the the last part of the story but if
[55:13] you read the entire chapter
[55:15] the bible is talking about elizabeth you
[55:18] know when i was reading this book of
[55:20] of of luke chapter one the story of
[55:23] elizabeth
[55:23] really you know did something in me you
[55:25] know to see the
[55:26] faith that elizabeth had because you
[55:29] have to read you have to understand that
[55:30] elizabeth the bible tells the bible
[55:34] uh her husband is zakarius and he was a
[55:37] chief priest of the temple and the bible
[55:39] says that
[55:40] those two couple were following god's
[55:43] word
[55:43] they were blameless but though they
[55:46] weren't blameless but they didn't have a
[55:48] child
[55:49] so they were old and they didn't have a
[55:51] child cause elizabeth was barren
[55:53] and then zechariah prayed to the lord to
[55:56] give them a child
[55:57] but when the angel came to them
[55:59] zechariah didn't believe the angel so he
[56:02] asked the angel the question he says
[56:03] that
[56:04] so how am i going to know that this is
[56:06] true because i am old and my wife is old
[56:09] also.
[56:10] so how is it going to happen and then if
[56:11] you read the bible you will not
[56:13] understand that
[56:14] the angel told him the sign that you
[56:16] will notice that you won't be able to
[56:17] say
[56:18] anything any words will not come out of
[56:20] your mouth
[56:21] until the son the son is born so here
[56:25] we see that elizabeth now she conceived
[56:28] she has a child in her womb
[56:30] but the thing that happened is that the
[56:32] child is dead
[56:34] you know she bit she had the child for
[56:36] six months
[56:37] and that the child never moved you know
[56:40] every mom you know who has that
[56:41] experience i i don't know but
[56:44] you know every mom who has that
[56:45] experience you know they know that
[56:46] sometimes you know
[56:48] child you know the baby moves inside of
[56:50] the womb you know
[56:51] if you know he needs something you will
[56:53] know that you know this
[56:54] this is for this and this for that so
[56:56] now here elizabeth
[56:58] she heard the voice from the angel
[57:02] and the angel was real because her
[57:04] husband was this
[57:05] was the result was the proof that the
[57:07] angel was
[57:08] was real because her husband couldn't
[57:10] couldn't speak
[57:12] now she heard the voice she had the
[57:14] promise from the angel
[57:15] that you will have a child but now here
[57:18] she is having that child that was
[57:20] promised
[57:21] by the child is dead you know you need
[57:24] to have
[57:24] faith to still believe you know that's
[57:27] what she had i mean she had faith and
[57:29] she believed god's word
[57:31] until you know until when mary came and
[57:34] the prophet
[57:35] the way the prophet says that he says
[57:36] that when the first the first time that
[57:38] the name of jesus was pronounced
[57:40] out of the human mouth that was when uh
[57:43] uh her son you know received life
[57:47] you know and and then elizabeth could
[57:49] you know as a human being
[57:51] you know when when we go through those
[57:53] stuff you know
[57:54] uh a thought comes to us you know and
[57:57] says that
[57:58] is god real you know is this promise was
[58:01] this promise real or
[58:03] or was it really an angel that came to
[58:05] me or was it
[58:06] you know was i dreaming or something
[58:08] because you know how is here's god
[58:10] promising me a child now i have a child
[58:13] who's there who's dead i mean the child
[58:15] would never move
[58:16] you know elizabeth certainly you know
[58:18] was going through those mind bottles
[58:20] but she never but she closed the doors
[58:23] of the of of her mind you know to let
[58:25] faith act you know you might be going
[58:28] through some
[58:28] you know some time today you know you
[58:30] might be going through
[58:32] you know the same thing that you ask god
[58:34] for something
[58:35] and then it's been years until now you
[58:37] don't receive the same thing
[58:38] you know you see you just have to keep
[58:40] the faith you know you just have to
[58:42] believe god because
[58:43] he that promise that he who promised you
[58:46] you know he is faithful enough to
[58:48] accomplish it you know hebrews chapter
[58:50] 11
[58:50] i'll read the bible in hebrews chapter
[58:53] 11 verse
[58:54] 32 to 40. the bible says that
[58:57] and what shall i more say for the time
[59:00] who failed me to tell of gideon
[59:02] and of barack and of samson and of
[59:05] jeffty
[59:06] and of david also and samuel and
[59:09] all the prophets verse 33
[59:12] who through faith subdue kingdoms
[59:16] wrote righteousness obtained promises
[59:19] stopped the mouth of lions quenched the
[59:22] violence
[59:23] for our fire escaped the age of the
[59:26] sword
[59:26] or out of the weakness out of the
[59:29] weakness were made strong waxed
[59:32] uh a valiant in fight turned to fight
[59:36] the the armies of the aliens women
[59:39] received their dead raised to life again
[59:42] and others were tortured not accepting
[59:46] deliverance
[59:47] that they might obtain a better
[59:49] resurrection
[59:50] and others head trial of cruel
[59:53] alfredo mocking and scourgering
[59:56] ye moreover of bonds
[1:00:00] and imprisonment they were stoned
[1:00:04] they were shown they were sun asunder
[1:00:07] were tempted were slain with the sword
[1:00:11] they wandered they wondered about in uh
[1:00:15] they wondered about in sheepskins and
[1:00:18] goat skins
[1:00:19] being destitute afflicted tormented
[1:00:23] of whom the world was not worthy
[1:00:27] they wandered in desert and in the
[1:00:29] mountains
[1:00:30] and in dense of caves and in dense and
[1:00:33] caves of the earth
[1:00:35] and all the and this all having obtained
[1:00:38] a good report through faith receive not
[1:00:41] the promise
[1:00:43] god having provided some better thing
[1:00:46] for us
[1:00:47] that they without us should not be made
[1:00:49] perfect
[1:00:50] you know those people that the bible
[1:00:52] here that paul was writing about
[1:00:54] you know the first one he talked about
[1:00:55] gideon you know if you go to the bible
[1:00:58] if you go
[1:00:58] back to the book of judges you will find
[1:01:01] the story of gideon you see that
[1:01:03] gideon you know in this time their
[1:01:06] people were you know in some sort of
[1:01:07] captivity
[1:01:08] you know they had those philistines who
[1:01:11] were coming every time
[1:01:12] to take everything that they had you
[1:01:14] know those philistines were coming every
[1:01:16] time you know
[1:01:17] to take all the goods you know all the
[1:01:19] farm you know
[1:01:20] uh product and everything their money
[1:01:22] and everything
[1:01:23] you know every time that god was trying
[1:01:25] to bless them
[1:01:26] you know those people were showing up to
[1:01:28] take to take them
[1:01:30] you know they were under those uh
[1:01:32] captivity you know under that
[1:01:33] circumstance for a long period of time
[1:01:36] you know but you know he had to take
[1:01:38] somebody who you know had to trust
[1:01:40] god you know to stand and say that you
[1:01:42] know today
[1:01:43] you know i have to finish today this has
[1:01:45] to end you know today
[1:01:47] this you know this has to end
[1:01:50] and then god used gideon for it you know
[1:01:52] god used it because he trusted god i
[1:01:54] mean he had faith
[1:01:55] he had faith in god's word and and and
[1:01:58] though
[1:01:59] himself was weak but he was made strong
[1:02:01] through god
[1:02:02] you know the bible talked about barbara
[1:02:05] you see that barrack the children of
[1:02:07] israel were
[1:02:07] on the captivity uh you know for 20
[1:02:10] years
[1:02:11] you know during that 20 years certainly
[1:02:13] they were praying god lord when is our
[1:02:15] deliverance coming
[1:02:16] you know during that 20 years certainly
[1:02:18] they were praying god said lord
[1:02:20] when are you going to send us a
[1:02:21] deliverer you know during that 20 years
[1:02:23] certainly they were praying praying god
[1:02:25] said that lord
[1:02:26] we need to get out of this kind of a
[1:02:28] situation we can't do nothing
[1:02:30] you know those philistines you know
[1:02:32] they're here and
[1:02:33] and you know we are under captivity and
[1:02:36] we don't have
[1:02:37] authority we can't pray we can't do this
[1:02:39] and that
[1:02:40] you know don't those times seem to be
[1:02:42] long
[1:02:43] but certainly their mourning was coming
[1:02:45] you know joy was coming in the morning
[1:02:47] you know it didn't matter how
[1:02:49] long it takes you know god had a plane
[1:02:52] prepared prepared for them
[1:02:54] that a morning will come that joy will
[1:02:56] come in the morning
[1:02:57] and god i think he was under the prophet
[1:03:00] uh she was a woman prophetess
[1:03:03] i forgot her name and then she gave that
[1:03:05] prophecy to barack
[1:03:07] and and then when you went there and
[1:03:08] then you fought and then if you see the
[1:03:10] bottle if you try to study the bottle
[1:03:12] how they fight you know you will see
[1:03:14] that the children of israel
[1:03:16] where only had 10 000 soldiers
[1:03:19] while the this other army had about 20
[1:03:22] 21 000 soldiers you know if you do the
[1:03:25] math you know
[1:03:26] it's basically impossible that 10 000
[1:03:28] soldiers can fight
[1:03:30] 21 soldiers you know 21 000 soldiers
[1:03:33] but since it was god's word and since
[1:03:35] the word came from god
[1:03:37] since it was a delicious of the lord
[1:03:38] that word will never
[1:03:40] couldn't fail you know that word had to
[1:03:42] bring some good result
[1:03:44] you know but he but they had to trust
[1:03:46] god first you know somebody had to
[1:03:48] believe
[1:03:49] you know whatever the prophet said you
[1:03:51] know somebody had to believe whatever
[1:03:53] you know the uh uh the prophet i think
[1:03:56] the prophet was deborah
[1:03:58] whatever she said you know somebody had
[1:04:00] to believe that
[1:04:01] you know take it into action and then go
[1:04:03] fight and then after that they saw the
[1:04:05] result
[1:04:05] you know the bible paul talked about
[1:04:07] samson
[1:04:08] you know the people you know the
[1:04:10] children of israel were under captivity
[1:04:12] again before samson
[1:04:13] you know they couldn't do anything the
[1:04:15] philistines were there all the time
[1:04:17] you know being on being you know having
[1:04:19] control over them
[1:04:20] but god you know raised up a man you
[1:04:23] know though
[1:04:24] those years you know seemed to be too
[1:04:26] long but the deliverance was there
[1:04:28] you know god was preparing something to
[1:04:31] come and deliver them
[1:04:32] you know it's like the children of
[1:04:33] israel being uh
[1:04:35] on the pharaoh you know for 400 years
[1:04:38] you know they've been praying
[1:04:40] god lord where where is our deliverance
[1:04:42] for 400 years
[1:04:44] they've been praying god lord where when
[1:04:46] are you going to send us somebody
[1:04:47] to take us out of this place lord but
[1:04:50] for 400 years they've been praying god
[1:04:52] asking god but lord
[1:04:54] lord you promised us a country you
[1:04:56] promised us the land
[1:04:57] but when are we gonna get there you know
[1:05:00] though those years seem to be long for
[1:05:02] them you know
[1:05:03] those years she seems to cease to belong
[1:05:05] for them but for god
[1:05:06] you know he was on their plane because
[1:05:08] if you're reading the bible you will
[1:05:09] find out that the peter says that
[1:05:12] a thousand years if a thousand days i
[1:05:15] think a thousand years
[1:05:16] you know of us is compared to it's like
[1:05:19] one day for god
[1:05:20] you know when he promised you know it
[1:05:22] doesn't mean that that promise
[1:05:24] can you know has to happen right now you
[1:05:26] know that promise
[1:05:27] is still you know uh uh is still
[1:05:30] valuable
[1:05:30] even after 25 years or 100 days you know
[1:05:34] imagine
[1:05:34] abraham you know praying god lord i'm
[1:05:37] here i'm getting old and i'm i'm about
[1:05:39] to die and
[1:05:40] and you know i don't have any anybody to
[1:05:43] take over my my
[1:05:44] my you know my my wealth and everything
[1:05:46] that i have you know lord
[1:05:48] can you say you know blower than that
[1:05:49] but the only person that i have here
[1:05:51] is uh uh uh uh eliezer
[1:05:55] you know that's the only person i have
[1:05:57] and i'm and i'm about to die
[1:05:59] you know god promised him a son god said
[1:06:01] that i will visit you abraham
[1:06:03] you know when abraham had that promise
[1:06:06] god never told him when
[1:06:07] or god never told him you know how many
[1:06:10] years that promise would take
[1:06:11] you know sarah sometimes she was getting
[1:06:13] weak you know you know telling abraham
[1:06:15] but no about
[1:06:16] abraham it's been 10 years but we don't
[1:06:19] see no sign of any child we don't see no
[1:06:21] sign of
[1:06:22] you know anything we i don't feel
[1:06:24] anything you know abraham it's been
[1:06:26] 15 years abraham it's been 20 years but
[1:06:29] abraham you know had faith in god
[1:06:32] abraham knew because he had an
[1:06:34] experience of
[1:06:35] god's visitation you know god visited
[1:06:38] abraham
[1:06:39] and then he gave him the promise abraham
[1:06:41] was for certain
[1:06:42] that this word is from god and it is the
[1:06:45] same god
[1:06:46] who told me to get out of my parents
[1:06:48] house you know to lead and he led me to
[1:06:50] this country is the same god
[1:06:52] who will come and then who will uh
[1:06:53] fulfill this word you know that's why
[1:06:55] the prophet says that
[1:06:56] faith is built upon experiences
[1:07:00] you know when you have experience that's
[1:07:02] when your faith grows
[1:07:04] you know when you have experiences
[1:07:05] that's when your faith grows you know
[1:07:07] abraham had an experience that's where
[1:07:09] his faith grow david you know he had an
[1:07:12] experience
[1:07:13] when he was you know going out with with
[1:07:15] the sheep you know those animals were
[1:07:17] coming and he killed them
[1:07:18] all so when goliath came you know
[1:07:20] goliath was compared to an animal to
[1:07:22] devil
[1:07:23] so he said that the same god who
[1:07:24] delivered me or the same god who gave
[1:07:27] those
[1:07:28] animals to me you know it will be the
[1:07:30] same god who will kill this goliath
[1:07:32] you know why because he had an
[1:07:33] experience to base his faith upon
[1:07:35] you know that's why experience is very
[1:07:37] important
[1:07:38] and of course sometimes you know as
[1:07:40] human we get discouraged sometimes you
[1:07:42] know we ask god something
[1:07:44] you know that you really certain that i
[1:07:46] prayed and i had all the feelings
[1:07:48] telling me that this thing
[1:07:49] will happen tonight and tonight when i
[1:07:51] go there i'll see the thing i'll see the
[1:07:53] results
[1:07:54] and then it happens tonight you know you
[1:07:56] don't you don't have no result
[1:07:57] you know faith doesn't take a note for
[1:07:59] an answer you have to keep believing
[1:08:01] you know have the same faith you know
[1:08:03] try to imagine the disciples
[1:08:06] you know the disciples been with jesus
[1:08:08] for uh i don't know how many years three
[1:08:10] years or
[1:08:11] i don't know how many years they've been
[1:08:12] with jesus they knew for certain that
[1:08:15] jesus was god
[1:08:16] they knew for certain that jesus was
[1:08:18] sent from god and they knew for certain
[1:08:20] that jesus was the messiah the person
[1:08:22] was supposed to deliver them
[1:08:23] from all the you know from from uh
[1:08:26] from from everything that they were
[1:08:28] going through you know it was certain
[1:08:30] for them you know
[1:08:31] they had that certainty they knew that
[1:08:33] jesus was the deliverer
[1:08:34] but it happened that someday of jesus
[1:08:37] talking about
[1:08:38] death though they couldn't understand
[1:08:40] but it happened that jesus
[1:08:41] you know was crucified and jesus died
[1:08:44] you know certainly by by the did you see
[1:08:45] the disciples were all confused
[1:08:48] you know some of them could even say but
[1:08:50] i thought that this man was god
[1:08:52] but how can god die but this man i
[1:08:54] thought it was god
[1:08:55] this man i thought that he was the man
[1:08:57] who was sent by god to deliver us
[1:09:00] you know this man i thought that he was
[1:09:01] the delivery that god sent us you know
[1:09:03] but but how can he die how can the
[1:09:06] romans you know
[1:09:07] take over him and crucify him and and
[1:09:10] die like this
[1:09:11] you know now i'm confused i don't know
[1:09:13] anything you know peter you know
[1:09:14] certainly was
[1:09:16] was disturbed by by the by the event you
[1:09:18] know he was like yeah
[1:09:20] so i'm up just i'm gonna go pro i'm
[1:09:23] gonna go fish and
[1:09:24] you know just to try to get this over
[1:09:26] with you know the two disciples on the
[1:09:28] uh ms well road you know there was like
[1:09:31] man i can't believe that this jesus is
[1:09:34] dead you know i truly believe that this
[1:09:36] was the god
[1:09:37] i truly believe that this was the
[1:09:38] deliverer you know whatever you know
[1:09:40] everything that isaiah said and
[1:09:42] everything that ezekiel said everything
[1:09:44] that the bible said
[1:09:45] you know was really jesus but how come
[1:09:47] this jesus is the end
[1:09:49] you know those he was in that time where
[1:09:51] they were all confused
[1:09:53] it wasn't that time that nothing seems
[1:09:55] to be to be good for them
[1:09:57] it wasn't that time that everything
[1:09:59] seems to be wrong for them
[1:10:00] that jesus showed up you know when jesus
[1:10:03] showed up
[1:10:04] he was with the two with the two
[1:10:06] disciples in ima's way
[1:10:08] you know telling them you know from
[1:10:09] genesis to you know to
[1:10:11] uh uh revelation you know everything
[1:10:14] that had to happen
[1:10:15] you know how jesus how god was going to
[1:10:17] send a child
[1:10:18] who will save the world and how this
[1:10:20] child will be dead will be crucified and
[1:10:22] die
[1:10:23] you know all of that and then their eyes
[1:10:25] was open you know
[1:10:26] here you have peter you know we went
[1:10:28] fishing and then jesus
[1:10:30] appeared to them to him right there you
[1:10:32] know and
[1:10:33] jesus showed them that i am still the
[1:10:35] same god
[1:10:36] you know though they were all confused
[1:10:39] you know though
[1:10:40] they started to lose their faith about
[1:10:42] the jesus that they believe
[1:10:43] you know that was in that time that
[1:10:45] jesus showed up
[1:10:46] you know you might be having something
[1:10:48] you know that that you see that you
[1:10:49] think that it's too
[1:10:50] hard for you to overcome you might be
[1:10:52] having something or that you think that
[1:10:54] you know i can't do it you know by
[1:10:56] myself i just can't
[1:10:57] and i've been praying for so long but
[1:10:59] god is not just showing up
[1:11:01] you know that it is in that point of
[1:11:03] time that jesus god will show up
[1:11:05] it's when you forsake your will and let
[1:11:07] god do the thing that's when he will
[1:11:09] come in action
[1:11:10] it's when you leave everything to him
[1:11:12] you say that lord
[1:11:13] now i can't do anything you know it
[1:11:15] doesn't even make sense to me anymore
[1:11:17] you know that's when god will show up
[1:11:19] the prophet says
[1:11:20] that how that seemed to be a night of a
[1:11:24] night hotel
[1:11:25] of this man that they seem involved that
[1:11:28] is seen involved
[1:11:30] and died buried and this
[1:11:34] what i mean this was the fourth day or
[1:11:37] the third day
[1:11:38] since he was dead peter had got
[1:11:40] discouraged
[1:11:42] wanted to go a fishing two of them say
[1:11:46] what one by the one by the name of
[1:11:48] cleopas said
[1:11:50] we'll just go back home to jerusalem
[1:11:53] on the road walking along that morning
[1:11:56] when peter got his fishing line and and
[1:11:59] took off fishing
[1:12:01] they still were on the road sad
[1:12:04] and as they went along along the road
[1:12:07] saying
[1:12:08] well i guess life is not worth it it's
[1:12:11] not worth living
[1:12:12] oh how we believe that that he was
[1:12:15] messiah
[1:12:16] how could that how could that man
[1:12:19] who raised the dead ever stand and let
[1:12:22] the high priest make fun of him
[1:12:24] how could a man who could see vision i
[1:12:27] will conceive vision after vision
[1:12:30] ever let the roman soldier put a rug
[1:12:32] around his face
[1:12:34] and hit him on the on the head
[1:12:37] and and say if thou beat a soldier
[1:12:41] put a rug around his face and hit him uh
[1:12:45] uh and said if thou be a prophet tell us
[1:12:48] who hit you
[1:12:49] how could he scream for mercy on the
[1:12:51] cross
[1:12:52] seeing that he could even raise up the
[1:12:55] dead
[1:12:56] oh it was discouraging moment and the
[1:12:58] prophet says that
[1:12:59] and those discouraging times comes to
[1:13:02] every believer
[1:13:03] to test you and to try you
[1:13:06] to see if you really do believe every
[1:13:10] son
[1:13:10] that cometh to god must first be tested
[1:13:13] child trained you know those disciples
[1:13:16] were going through that hard time you
[1:13:17] know those disciples
[1:13:18] you know were thinking about how we saw
[1:13:21] all those miracles you know he
[1:13:22] multiplied
[1:13:23] bread he multiplied fishes he did this
[1:13:26] and did that but look at his
[1:13:27] end look at how you know he's going and
[1:13:30] and look at how he's killed
[1:13:32] you know naked exposed and everybody
[1:13:35] making fun of him you know people gave
[1:13:36] him vinegar instead of water
[1:13:38] you know they put a crown on on his head
[1:13:41] and
[1:13:42] you know people were confused but this
[1:13:44] man we thought he called himself a king
[1:13:46] but how can a king who's coming from god
[1:13:49] can die this
[1:13:50] this way you know it wasn't that moment
[1:13:52] that jesus showed up
[1:13:53] it was in that moment you know of
[1:13:55] discouragement that jesus says that here
[1:13:58] i am
[1:13:58] you know listen the bible says that i
[1:14:00] had to die to save you
[1:14:02] i had to go through this so that you can
[1:14:05] be with me
[1:14:06] you know it isn't that time that jesus
[1:14:08] will show up
[1:14:09] you know if you're going through that
[1:14:11] same time that jesus jesus will show up
[1:14:13] you know it doesn't matter how long your
[1:14:15] situation lasts
[1:14:16] it doesn't matter how long your
[1:14:18] situation ends you know it might be
[1:14:19] sickness or whatever
[1:14:21] whatever need that you have you know it
[1:14:23] doesn't matter how long it lasts you
[1:14:24] just keep the faith because
[1:14:26] joy will always come in the morning you
[1:14:28] know you just keep believing
[1:14:31] amen you see the king back in the time
[1:14:34] of daniel
[1:14:36] you know daniel they say that you know
[1:14:37] you can't worship no god you can't
[1:14:39] worship your god anymore
[1:14:40] you know daniel said well you know you
[1:14:42] can't stop me from doing that but
[1:14:44] you know i can take whatever that can
[1:14:45] come to me i will still worship my god
[1:14:47] you know dania was put in the lion's den
[1:14:51] and then the king knew exactly who the
[1:14:54] god of daniel was
[1:14:55] because he saw those results so you know
[1:14:58] they had those experience with daniel
[1:15:00] daniel telling him his dreams and
[1:15:02] daniel telling him all those stuff even
[1:15:04] though he declared that decree
[1:15:06] you know he knew certainly that the god
[1:15:08] of daniel was a true god
[1:15:10] but because he was influenced by by
[1:15:13] other people by his counselor
[1:15:14] you know he was like well just let's say
[1:15:17] this if you worship other god then
[1:15:19] then then the god that i worship you
[1:15:21] will be put in the lion's den
[1:15:22] so when daniel was wanting was daniel's
[1:15:25] time to be put
[1:15:26] in in lawrence then you know the king
[1:15:29] accidentally you know the king was
[1:15:31] confused
[1:15:32] you know the king started to wander you
[1:15:35] know but but daniel told him
[1:15:37] i will see you in the morning amen you
[1:15:39] know daniel
[1:15:40] had faith you know he told him i will
[1:15:42] see you in the morning
[1:15:43] you know but the king you know i can't
[1:15:45] imagine the king
[1:15:47] his night was so long you know every
[1:15:49] time looking at his watch but
[1:15:51] what time is it it's two way it's 2 a.m
[1:15:53] in the morning
[1:15:54] you know it's it's 3 30 but daniel where
[1:15:57] are you
[1:15:57] it's three you know that night you know
[1:15:59] seemed to be long for him
[1:16:01] but joy was coming in the morning you
[1:16:03] know it took it just need a little bit
[1:16:05] patience you know it just needed to be a
[1:16:07] little bit patient
[1:16:08] but joy was certainly coming in the
[1:16:10] morning you know joy will always come in
[1:16:13] the morning
[1:16:13] you know it doesn't matter how long your
[1:16:15] night lasts it doesn't matter how
[1:16:17] dark is your night you know joy will
[1:16:20] always come in the morning you know the
[1:16:21] sun will always shine
[1:16:23] and the sun will always smile at you you
[1:16:25] know it doesn't matter how long winter
[1:16:27] can last you know how many snow we can
[1:16:29] have
[1:16:29] but we know some for sure that spring
[1:16:31] will always show up
[1:16:33] you know that's what god promised you
[1:16:35] some good things you just have faith and
[1:16:37] go believe it
[1:16:38] and then you will see it accomplished
[1:16:40] you know you see peter
[1:16:41] fishing all night long not getting
[1:16:44] anything you know peter was an
[1:16:46] experienced fisherman you know he
[1:16:48] started fishing when he was a little boy
[1:16:50] you know he didn't even know how to
[1:16:51] write or how to read the only thing that
[1:16:53] he knew
[1:16:54] was how to fight and fish you know fish
[1:16:56] was really his passion
[1:16:58] but he's been fishing for all for the
[1:17:00] entire night
[1:17:01] and not getting anything you know
[1:17:03] certainly peter was discouraged but
[1:17:05] certainly peter was asking himself that
[1:17:08] what can i do i have
[1:17:09] you know tax that i have to pay you know
[1:17:12] probably this is my last night to leave
[1:17:14] you know if i don't pay this tax you
[1:17:16] know i'm gonna get in trouble with the
[1:17:18] you know with the uh uh with the
[1:17:20] governor
[1:17:21] and you know this is the only option
[1:17:23] that i have probably this is my only
[1:17:25] time that i have to spend with my family
[1:17:27] if i if i get deficient and i'm able to
[1:17:30] sell them then i'll be able to pay all
[1:17:32] the debt
[1:17:32] but all those things you know seem to be
[1:17:35] just
[1:17:36] thoughts or dreams that would never come
[1:17:38] to peter you know peter spent
[1:17:40] all night long fishing nothing came and
[1:17:43] nothing happened
[1:17:44] but he just waited until the morning you
[1:17:46] know jesus
[1:17:47] asked him the boy jesus asked him the
[1:17:49] board and then
[1:17:50] the miracle happened you know he had to
[1:17:53] have faith
[1:17:54] you know believing that joy will come in
[1:17:56] the morning though
[1:17:57] you know those time was discouraging
[1:17:59] time for him you know though he tried
[1:18:01] his best to try all the techniques that
[1:18:03] he couldn't remember
[1:18:04] but nothing could nothing you know had a
[1:18:06] good result but joy certainly came came
[1:18:08] in the morning for him
[1:18:10] you know the bible says i mean the
[1:18:12] prophet says that
[1:18:13] god at the beginning he said
[1:18:17] let there be let there be
[1:18:21] the world was just dark in a chaos
[1:18:25] even when he said let there be light
[1:18:28] there might have been a hundred years
[1:18:31] before
[1:18:32] that light ever sprung in but when he
[1:18:35] spoke it
[1:18:36] that has to come to pass it must be
[1:18:39] that way see and he spoke his word
[1:18:44] damn seeds was beneath the water
[1:18:47] when he dried off the earth then the
[1:18:50] seeds
[1:18:51] come up what he says must come to pass
[1:18:55] you know whatever god says must come to
[1:18:57] pass you know he might spend it might
[1:18:58] take longer than you expect
[1:19:00] you know it's like uh i'm gonna give you
[1:19:02] an example
[1:19:05] it's like you come to me you're hungry
[1:19:08] and you say well brother isaac you know
[1:19:10] what i'm hungry i can't leave you know
[1:19:13] i can't leave more than five hours i'm
[1:19:15] i'll we pass out because i'm
[1:19:17] really hungry i didn't eat for about
[1:19:19] three days and i can't even breathe or i
[1:19:21] can't even walk
[1:19:22] and then you come to me brother isaac
[1:19:24] and i'm gonna tell you what brother you
[1:19:26] know what
[1:19:26] i don't know how to cook so i don't have
[1:19:28] any food to give you but i would but i
[1:19:30] would give you i would
[1:19:31] you know you would do what i always do
[1:19:33] you go to a restaurant
[1:19:35] you buy some food but now i don't have
[1:19:37] the food but i have money that i will
[1:19:38] give you
[1:19:39] you know you came to me asking for food
[1:19:42] which when you keep what
[1:19:43] was coming to me you thought you were
[1:19:45] thinking that you would
[1:19:46] directly have food from me but here i am
[1:19:49] i'm giving you instead of giving you the
[1:19:51] food
[1:19:52] i'm giving you 25 to go buy some food
[1:19:55] you know the 25 is the same thing as me
[1:19:58] giving you the food
[1:19:59] but the difference is that me giving you
[1:20:01] the 25 dollars
[1:20:03] just would take a little bit more time
[1:20:05] for you to get some food
[1:20:07] but you will still have the food you
[1:20:09] know it's the same thing with god's
[1:20:10] promise
[1:20:11] you know god promised us something you
[1:20:13] know you can come and pray god and
[1:20:15] at the same place at the same you know
[1:20:17] same
[1:20:18] same time you gave you you get your
[1:20:20] answer you know sometimes you can come
[1:20:22] and pray god and
[1:20:23] you know it will you will wait for
[1:20:24] another month or two or three years
[1:20:27] you know i don't know how long god will
[1:20:28] decide for you to wait
[1:20:30] you know those is answer you know it's
[1:20:32] still the same thing as
[1:20:34] you know you had the situation resolved
[1:20:36] you know it's the same thing you know i
[1:20:38] would give you 25
[1:20:40] you might have to walk if you don't have
[1:20:42] car you know you might have to be more
[1:20:44] hungry because you're walking
[1:20:45] but you have faith that i have the i
[1:20:47] have the substance i have the 25 dollars
[1:20:50] that i will go buy some food and once i
[1:20:52] get there to that restaurant
[1:20:54] you know i won't be hungry anymore you
[1:20:56] know that's the same thing with god's
[1:20:58] words god promised to us all
[1:21:00] the good things foreign found in this
[1:21:01] bible you know we just need to have the
[1:21:04] faith
[1:21:04] you know to believe in this word you
[1:21:06] know he says that he will never leave
[1:21:08] you nor forsake you
[1:21:09] he says that whatever you ask in my name
[1:21:11] i will believe you know
[1:21:12] have faith believe and then you will see
[1:21:15] accomplished
[1:21:16] you know he said that you can tell you
[1:21:18] can say to this mountain to be removed
[1:21:20] you know you have you have to have faith
[1:21:22] believing that it has already happened
[1:21:24] and you will see him you will see him
[1:21:25] come you know you will see it being
[1:21:28] fulfilled
[1:21:28] you know you just have to have faith you
[1:21:30] know it might be longer
[1:21:31] than you expect you know it might take
[1:21:34] longer than expected
[1:21:35] but that promise will still come to pass
[1:21:38] you know the children of israel as i
[1:21:39] mentioned you know we're promised
[1:21:41] a messiah or where promised
[1:21:44] moses or or a deliverer but they had to
[1:21:47] wait
[1:21:47] for it had to wait for 400 years you
[1:21:50] know even that 400 years was not enough
[1:21:52] god
[1:21:53] added another 40 years to on top of that
[1:21:55] so in total they had to wait for 440
[1:21:58] years
[1:21:59] you know it seemed to be long you know
[1:22:02] the chin of israel were promised the
[1:22:03] messiah somebody will come
[1:22:06] you know he took it was longer than they
[1:22:07] expected you know that messiah isaiah
[1:22:10] came and he gave the prophecy
[1:22:11] that the virgin shall conceive but that
[1:22:14] you know isaiah came and isaiah passed
[1:22:16] away
[1:22:16] you know other prophets came and they
[1:22:18] passed away and everything came and they
[1:22:20] passed away but that promise was still
[1:22:22] you know to god that promise was
[1:22:24] invaluable as if it had already happened
[1:22:27] you know it just was not in the time it
[1:22:29] just had to be in god's timing
[1:22:31] you know but the thing is that we don't
[1:22:33] wait you know but the thing is that we
[1:22:35] don't wait we don't like to depend on
[1:22:36] god
[1:22:37] but the thing is that we don't want to
[1:22:39] you know if we ask god something
[1:22:41] you know we start feeling you know some
[1:22:42] weird feelings you know against what we
[1:22:44] ask
[1:22:45] you know we just lose faith you know we
[1:22:47] start feeling some
[1:22:48] some weird feelings you know you ask god
[1:22:50] for for healing and then
[1:22:52] you you know you sleep at night and you
[1:22:54] and your pain got worse and
[1:22:56] you sleep at night or you you walk in
[1:22:58] and you can't even walk
[1:22:59] now you start doubting god you know it
[1:23:02] don't matter how
[1:23:04] you know it don't matter how the pain
[1:23:06] can grow you don't matter how you feel
[1:23:08] you know if you ask god something you
[1:23:10] still have to believe
[1:23:12] that god will give you whatever you ask
[1:23:15] oh sister in can i have the
[1:23:17] picture please you know you will still
[1:23:19] you know you just have to
[1:23:20] believe you know here is uh this picture

[1:23:26] there's three circle
[1:23:28] the first one second and then the third
[1:23:31] the first one is the body
[1:23:33] it's the the external body and then you
[1:23:35] will see that this body has
[1:23:37] five five five gates you know those are
[1:23:39] the senses
[1:23:40] you know it's the the sight and smell
[1:23:42] the hearing taste and touch
[1:23:44] you know those are the things that
[1:23:46] sometimes influence this body
[1:23:48] and then and then if you pass the actual
[1:23:50] body you will see that
[1:23:51] you know there's a soul and then the
[1:23:54] soul
[1:23:54] you know has you know imagination is
[1:23:57] influenced by imagination conscience
[1:23:59] memory uh memory affection
[1:24:03] and then reason and then other than that
[1:24:05] after that
[1:24:06] there is the spirit and then the spirit
[1:24:08] only has two senses
[1:24:10] it's either faith or doubt you know
[1:24:13] what just one of them has to be there
[1:24:15] but now
[1:24:16] the result that you will have here it's
[1:24:18] whatever you want
[1:24:19] you will let yourself be led you know
[1:24:22] and this
[1:24:23] mean this in your soul you know if for
[1:24:25] example you ask god for something you
[1:24:27] say lord i need to pass this class
[1:24:29] and then you see that those results you
[1:24:31] still having f and
[1:24:32] f you know till the end and then for
[1:24:35] some reason
[1:24:35] you start to you know to to to fear or
[1:24:39] you start developing those doubt
[1:24:41] you know that whatever that you're
[1:24:43] having in your soul
[1:24:45] will influence your spirit you know will
[1:24:47] influence which sense will be there
[1:24:50] because
[1:24:50] notice that in the spirit you know just
[1:24:52] one has to be there it's either faith
[1:24:55] or or doubt you know that's why you see
[1:24:57] abraham
[1:24:58] you know when god promised him a son you
[1:25:01] know he had to close
[1:25:02] all those doors of of of you know of of
[1:25:06] bad feelings all those doors
[1:25:08] that that was against god's promise you
[1:25:10] know so that
[1:25:11] should i do closing those doors will
[1:25:13] help him you know develop the faith that
[1:25:16] was insane that was inside of him
[1:25:17] you know you will see that when sarah
[1:25:19] was coming and telling him that abraham
[1:25:21] it's been 20 years
[1:25:22] that we don't have a child you know
[1:25:24] abraham will see and said yeah he said
[1:25:26] it
[1:25:26] he will he will accomplish you know he
[1:25:28] will make it happen
[1:25:30] you know god promised it and we just
[1:25:32] have to believe it you know and we will
[1:25:34] see the result
[1:25:35] you know he had to you had to close
[1:25:37] those doors but
[1:25:38] most of the time it's like we don't
[1:25:40] close those doors you know most of the
[1:25:42] time we let those doors
[1:25:43] you know influence you know whatever we
[1:25:46] have influenced our faith
[1:25:47] you know you prayed god and then you
[1:25:49] have those you you know those mind
[1:25:51] bottles
[1:25:51] that you can't overcome and then all of
[1:25:53] a sudden you start doubting
[1:25:55] you know you have to close your
[1:25:57] imagination because
[1:25:58] the prophet says that your mind it calls
[1:26:01] it at no man's land
[1:26:04] in no man's land it's a place if you go
[1:26:07] back in the you know in the old
[1:26:08] testament
[1:26:09] whenever you know israel and other
[1:26:11] countries were fighting
[1:26:13] they were looking for a mutual place
[1:26:15] where there was going to fight
[1:26:16] they called it a no man's land which
[1:26:18] means that you know it'll be
[1:26:20] far from you know their properties you
[1:26:23] know so that
[1:26:23] those damage will not affect them
[1:26:25] directly you know they would look for
[1:26:27] that place and that place didn't belong
[1:26:29] to anybody
[1:26:30] you know they would go there and fight
[1:26:32] there and then the prophet says that
[1:26:33] since the fall i mean since the
[1:26:35] beginning since the god of the garden of
[1:26:37] eden
[1:26:37] you know the devil started to be the the
[1:26:40] only way that the devil can come to you
[1:26:42] is through your mind you know he has to
[1:26:44] come by this no man's land you know you
[1:26:46] will see
[1:26:47] with e you know he started yeah surely
[1:26:50] god
[1:26:50] said that but you know but if you if you
[1:26:53] eat this you will be like him
[1:26:54] you know surely you will not die but you
[1:26:57] will be
[1:26:58] more you know like him you know he
[1:27:00] started to develop you know
[1:27:02] that tactic you know to influence our
[1:27:04] mind because he knew that once he has
[1:27:06] our mind
[1:27:07] you know it would automatically develop
[1:27:10] a doubt
[1:27:10] inside of our spirit you know and and
[1:27:12] then that's the same thing that god
[1:27:14] comes to us you know
[1:27:15] he comes you know through our mind also
[1:27:17] you know
[1:27:18] god gives his word and and then through
[1:27:20] our mind as long as our mind is
[1:27:23] is locked in god's promise you know that
[1:27:25] will you know
[1:27:26] help you to have faith you know and and
[1:27:28] then
[1:27:29] and then our imagination you know if
[1:27:33] those imagination conscience memory and
[1:27:35] everything
[1:27:36] goes against the word of god you have to
[1:27:38] close all those doors
[1:27:39] you know it's good to have feelings you
[1:27:41] know it's good to fear god's presence
[1:27:43] you know we need it sometimes you know
[1:27:45] to fear that god is here we need it
[1:27:47] sometimes that when we pray we feel the
[1:27:49] presence of god
[1:27:50] but if those feelings and those
[1:27:52] imagination everything goes against the
[1:27:54] word of god
[1:27:55] you have to close all those doors you
[1:27:56] know you have to keep you have to
[1:27:58] you know to keep the word of god and say
[1:28:00] that whatever i feel
[1:28:01] i don't care but god promised me healing
[1:28:04] and i will
[1:28:05] and i will have it you know whatever i
[1:28:06] feel i don't care god promised me money
[1:28:09] i would have it you know whatever i fear
[1:28:10] you know it doesn't matter
[1:28:12] god promised me this and our heaven god
[1:28:14] promised me the holy spirit
[1:28:16] and i will still have it you know it
[1:28:18] doesn't matter how i feel it doesn't
[1:28:19] matter what people tell to me or what
[1:28:21] people say to me
[1:28:23] that you're not changing or you haven't
[1:28:25] changed but i know for sure that i asked
[1:28:27] god something and i have faith
[1:28:28] and his promises that whatever you ask
[1:28:30] to me you know have faith in god and you
[1:28:33] will see it happen
[1:28:34] you know abraham had to close those
[1:28:37] doors
[1:28:38] of doubt those doors that could
[1:28:40] influence his faith
[1:28:42] and then you will see the result you
[1:28:44] know when paul wrote this testimony
[1:28:46] none of his mistakes were mentioned he
[1:28:48] was actually called the father of faith
[1:28:50] you know
[1:28:51] and then we are the children of abraham
[1:28:53] because he was able to by god's grace to
[1:28:55] close those doors
[1:28:56] and if we can just pray god and say lord
[1:28:59] you know i know that i can't i'm not
[1:29:01] strong enough to close it
[1:29:02] you know sometimes i have bad thought
[1:29:04] you know you know driving through me
[1:29:06] and i can't control him but if you can
[1:29:08] give me strength you know to fight back
[1:29:10] and i'm pretty sure that god will give
[1:29:12] you strength to fight that because the
[1:29:13] prophet says that
[1:29:15] he gave this uh and get this uh
[1:29:18] thing it was the story of this man who
[1:29:21] you know he had his form
[1:29:23] and then birds were flying over and then
[1:29:25] come eat you know
[1:29:26] and destroy whatever he sees and the
[1:29:29] prophet says that
[1:29:30] this man couldn't stop the bird from
[1:29:31] flying but he could stop the bird from
[1:29:34] eating from his from from his farm
[1:29:36] you know and that's the same thing you
[1:29:37] can't stop thought from you know flying
[1:29:39] over your mind
[1:29:40] but you can't stop them you know you
[1:29:43] can't stop
[1:29:44] developing those thoughts you know
[1:29:45] because the longer you develop those
[1:29:47] thoughts
[1:29:48] you know it is influencing you it is
[1:29:50] actually awakening you
[1:29:52] you know that's why abraham you know had
[1:29:54] to close it
[1:29:55] you know the prophet says that there is
[1:29:58] your battleground
[1:29:59] your battleground your battleground is
[1:30:02] back here
[1:30:03] at the beginning back here in the soul
[1:30:07] back in your mind that opens
[1:30:10] the the mind is the gate to the soul
[1:30:14] they get to the spirit rather your mind
[1:30:17] opens up
[1:30:18] and accepts the spirit or rejects the
[1:30:21] spirit
[1:30:22] you can have little consciences and
[1:30:25] little feelings
[1:30:26] and little sensations and all these
[1:30:29] things
[1:30:30] that has nothing to do with it just
[1:30:33] that's just little sensations of and
[1:30:36] things
[1:30:37] but when it comes to reality your mind
[1:30:40] opens it up your mind either
[1:30:43] accepted or rejected that's it friends
[1:30:47] god let none of them missing you that's
[1:30:50] the prophet is praying that god let none
[1:30:52] of them miss it
[1:30:53] see it is your mind that opens up the
[1:30:56] door
[1:30:57] or closes the door and listens to your
[1:31:00] conscience
[1:31:02] listens to your memory listens to your
[1:31:04] affections
[1:31:05] and but when your mind closes itself
[1:31:09] those uh to those things and let god
[1:31:13] the spirit of his word come in it blows
[1:31:17] the rest of the stuff
[1:31:18] out every doubt is gone every fear is
[1:31:21] gone
[1:31:22] every sensation doubt of doubt is gone
[1:31:25] every feeling is gone there is nothing
[1:31:28] standing there
[1:31:29] by the word of god and satan cannot
[1:31:32] battle
[1:31:32] against that no sir he cannot battle
[1:31:35] against it
[1:31:36] now we know that's true you know as long
[1:31:39] as you get as long as you know you let
[1:31:41] god spread
[1:31:42] god's word you know god's word really uh
[1:31:45] uh uh suck into you you know you you
[1:31:48] know you lock into it and you say that
[1:31:50] lord
[1:31:50] whatever you say that i believe is from
[1:31:52] you you know it's like this blind man
[1:31:54] that the prophet prayed about
[1:31:56] you know the prophet prayed for him and
[1:31:58] he wasn't he didn't see
[1:32:00] the prophet told him go and then god
[1:32:02] testified about your healing
[1:32:04] you know this blind man his feelings
[1:32:06] were different than what he wanted to
[1:32:08] have
[1:32:09] you know the result at that time was
[1:32:11] different than the
[1:32:12] the result he was expecting you know
[1:32:14] he's so how
[1:32:16] i'm pretty sure he heard how you know
[1:32:18] other people went to the prophet and the
[1:32:19] prophet praying for them and they
[1:32:21] recovered they see
[1:32:22] you know their side at the same place
[1:32:24] you know he saw he heard
[1:32:25] how many people went to the prophet they
[1:32:27] couldn't talk and
[1:32:28] the prophet prayed for them a prayer for
[1:32:30] a few seconds and then they were able to
[1:32:32] talk
[1:32:32] but here he is the same man you know
[1:32:35] this man
[1:32:36] coming to that prophet you know he heard
[1:32:38] a lot about him
[1:32:40] but now the same prophet praying about
[1:32:42] it for him and then he's telling him
[1:32:44] you know what you have to wait you have
[1:32:46] to go there
[1:32:47] and then go testified about your healing
[1:32:50] you know go test if i go tear
[1:32:52] you know the people about your healing
[1:32:54] but this man couldn't see
[1:32:55] i mean it was blind i mean if you're
[1:32:57] blind you can't fake it i mean you're
[1:32:59] blind you don't you don't see
[1:33:00] nothing you're blind but he didn't let
[1:33:02] his blindness influence
[1:33:04] the result from his spirit you know he
[1:33:06] didn't let his blindness influence
[1:33:09] you know whatever make him doubt
[1:33:11] whatever the prophet says
[1:33:12] you know he knew that that was the same
[1:33:14] of the lord and he did he didn't care
[1:33:16] how long that take
[1:33:18] you know that how long that took he knew
[1:33:20] for sure that the
[1:33:22] same word as it was promised you know
[1:33:24] the same word will never go back void
[1:33:26] but he has to accomplish the reason why
[1:33:28] the word was pronounced
[1:33:30] you know that's the same thing god
[1:33:31] whenever the bible says that god
[1:33:33] you know god's word is like it's like
[1:33:35] it's like a rain you know when god sends
[1:33:37] a rain you know it's for a purpose
[1:33:39] you know we have fields we're here in
[1:33:41] iowa we have corn and stuff
[1:33:42] you know we need the rain to help those
[1:33:44] seeds you know mature very
[1:33:46] really fast and the rain will never go
[1:33:48] back until he has
[1:33:50] finished the purpose for why you know he
[1:33:52] was sent
[1:33:53] you know that's the same thing with
[1:33:54] god's promise you know god's promise
[1:33:56] that's a lot of stuff you know there is
[1:33:58] so many promises in the bible
[1:34:00] you know every time that you can open
[1:34:02] your bible you will see god's promises
[1:34:04] every time that you can open the bible
[1:34:06] you will see god's promising marching
[1:34:08] exactly the situation that you're going
[1:34:09] through you know the thing is that you
[1:34:11] just have to have faith
[1:34:12] you know you just have to believe you
[1:34:15] know just have faith the prophet says
[1:34:16] that
[1:34:17] if the entire this church today and at
[1:34:20] this time
[1:34:21] will have faith in god's word and then
[1:34:23] take
[1:34:24] all the doubt away it says that there
[1:34:26] will be no need for the holy spirit
[1:34:28] because the holy spirit will be given to
[1:34:30] anybody who needs it he says that if the
[1:34:32] church
[1:34:33] just you know you know believe in god's
[1:34:35] word and a hundred percent believe and
[1:34:36] take all the doubt away
[1:34:38] there will be no need for blessing but
[1:34:40] blessing will be given to them you know
[1:34:42] there will be no need for every need
[1:34:44] that you have
[1:34:45] because it will be given to you if you
[1:34:47] just have faith in god
[1:34:49] you know faith in god's word it's like
[1:34:52] an atomic bomb
[1:34:53] you know that destroys everything you
[1:34:56] know faith in god's word is like an
[1:34:58] atomic bomb
[1:34:58] so how can you go to god in prayer and
[1:35:01] pray and not have faith
[1:35:02] and then you expect you know the result
[1:35:04] to happen you know you have to have
[1:35:05] faith
[1:35:06] you know that's why you know in the
[1:35:08] statute of the perfect man paul was
[1:35:10] saying that
[1:35:10] you know add to your faith you know he
[1:35:13] knew that faith has to be there as a
[1:35:15] foundation
[1:35:16] because you cannot follow god and not
[1:35:18] have faith
[1:35:19] you know you cannot serve god not have
[1:35:21] faith you know because you will
[1:35:23] encounter you know
[1:35:24] circumstances you know you will
[1:35:26] encounter you know difficult
[1:35:28] times you know you know difficult times
[1:35:30] where you need something
[1:35:31] but you have to have faith first you
[1:35:33] know before seeing the result
[1:35:35] and then god you know was so good to us
[1:35:37] and he said that if you have
[1:35:38] faith even like the the master seed you
[1:35:41] know you can ask
[1:35:42] everything that you need you know you
[1:35:44] will see it accomplish you know a master
[1:35:46] scene
[1:35:47] it's not big as a mango you know it's a
[1:35:49] small seed
[1:35:50] you know if you can if your faith can be
[1:35:52] even in that dimension
[1:35:54] you know you can ask god something and
[1:35:55] then you will see it happen
[1:35:57] you know if you have faith and then you
[1:35:59] close your mind from
[1:36:01] every outside result i mean for every
[1:36:03] you know from
[1:36:04] every things that you know that can
[1:36:06] happen to you
[1:36:07] now that can be against what you believe
[1:36:09] the bible says in romans chapter
[1:36:11] 17 verse 20 um romans chapter 4 verse
[1:36:15] 17 to 22 the bible says that
[1:36:18] as it is written i have made the
[1:36:22] father of many nations before him
[1:36:25] whom he believed even god whole
[1:36:27] quickness
[1:36:29] of the dead and calleth those things
[1:36:33] which be
[1:36:34] not as though they were who against o
[1:36:37] all hope believed in hope
[1:36:41] who against hope believed in hope that
[1:36:43] he might become the father of many
[1:36:46] nations
[1:36:47] according to that which was spoken so
[1:36:50] shall
[1:36:51] shalt thy seed be and being not weak in
[1:36:55] faith
[1:36:56] he considered not his own body now dead
[1:36:59] when he was about a hundred years old
[1:37:02] neither yet
[1:37:03] the deadness of sarah's womb he
[1:37:05] staggered
[1:37:06] not at the promise of god through
[1:37:08] unbelief
[1:37:10] but was wrong in faith giving glory to
[1:37:13] god
[1:37:13] and being fully persuaded that
[1:37:17] that what he has promised he was able
[1:37:20] also to
[1:37:21] to perform and therefore it was imputed
[1:37:24] to him for righteousness you know
[1:37:27] abraham
[1:37:28] you know he closed all those doors you
[1:37:30] know he didn't consider his body as
[1:37:33] you know being a hundred years old you
[1:37:34] know according to nature
[1:37:36] according to science he can't have no
[1:37:38] son you know he
[1:37:39] he didn't believe in that you know he
[1:37:41] believed in god promise
[1:37:42] elizabeth did the same thing you know
[1:37:45] she didn't believe
[1:37:46] that according to science you know she
[1:37:49] couldn't have any child anymore
[1:37:51] but she believed she stuck with god's
[1:37:53] promise you know and god gave her a
[1:37:55] promise though
[1:37:56] you know her son was was dead inside of
[1:37:58] her
[1:37:59] womb you know she knew exactly that her
[1:38:01] son was not moving
[1:38:02] but she still kept the faith in god she
[1:38:05] said that the same god who promised me a
[1:38:07] son
[1:38:07] and the same god who gave me this son it
[1:38:10] would be the same god who will resurrect
[1:38:12] this son
[1:38:12] inside of my womb and when the time
[1:38:15] would be due
[1:38:16] i would give birth to a living child you
[1:38:18] know he had that she had to have faith
[1:38:21] even though her husband you know her
[1:38:22] faith was i mean his faith was weak
[1:38:25] but you know she had to have faith

[1:40:38] or the blood you know to purify your sin

[1:40:53] you know blessings will follow you all
[1:40:56] the you know everywhere you will go
[1:40:58] if you obey to his word you won't be
[1:41:00] asking god for blessings
[1:41:01] but there will be there behind you you
[1:41:03] know following you wherever you go if
[1:41:05] you obey to his word
[1:41:07] and obey you cannot obey to god's word
[1:41:09] if you don't have faith
[1:41:10] you know you need to have faith before
[1:41:12] obeying to god's word first
[1:41:14] you know because you need to have faith
[1:41:16] that what whatever that his word
[1:41:18] is the truth amen
[1:41:22] you know eve was given the armor of god
[1:41:26] but she by by that armor armor was lost
[1:41:30] when she disbelieved god because she
[1:41:33] opened her mind for reasoning
[1:41:35] you know she let the devil come to her
[1:41:39] and then she stopped to listen to
[1:41:41] whatever
[1:41:42] the devil were telling her you know
[1:41:45] that's the thing that we don't we're not
[1:41:47] supposed to do you know when you have
[1:41:49] god's promise

[1:41:58] you know you you have an experience with
[1:42:01] god that you've been saved and you have
[1:42:02] the holy spirit
[1:42:03] then when you go out the devil will come
[1:42:05] to you ask asking question are you
[1:42:07] really saved
[1:42:08] was it this one is it i think this one
[1:42:10] was only just those feelings that
[1:42:12] you know that happens once in a while
[1:42:14] it's not really the baptism of the holy
[1:42:15] spirit
[1:42:16] you know you ask god something and then
[1:42:18] here's the devil coming to you and say
[1:42:19] that

[1:45:04] you know doubt and faith fighting each
[1:45:06] other you know health and
[1:45:08] health and death fighting each other but
[1:45:10] it just depends on
[1:45:11] that whoever will win is the one that
[1:45:13] you will stop and then listen to
[1:45:16] you know the bible said that faith comes
[1:45:17] by here and you have to know that also
[1:45:20] doubt cometh by here
[1:45:21] but the result is that it depends on
[1:45:23] what you're hearing
[1:45:25] you know faith cometh by here but when
[1:45:26] you hear the word of god
[1:45:28] that's when the faith that's when faith
[1:45:30] comes but doubts comes when you hear
[1:45:33] you know everything that is contrary
[1:45:34] from the word of god you know everything
[1:45:36] that goes against god's word that's when
[1:45:38] doubts come all of them you know it's by
[1:45:40] here all of them you have to open your
[1:45:42] ears
[1:45:43] open your mind and then they will have
[1:45:45] an influence in you
[1:45:46] it just depends on what you hear what
[1:45:48] are you hearing right now
[1:45:49] you know you've asked god something what
[1:45:51] what are you hearing right now
[1:45:53] you know you might be hearing you know
[1:45:54] somebody a voice somebody telling you
[1:45:57] that you will never get whatever you ask
[1:45:58] you know you don't have to hear that you
[1:46:00] know the result will be what you stop
[1:46:02] and then what you what you stop and then
[1:46:04] try and choose to listen to
[1:46:06] that's where that's what that's what the
[1:46:08] result will be
[1:46:10] it depends on you you know you have the
[1:46:12] result in your hand you know the prophet
[1:46:13] says that faith and doubt are fighting
[1:46:15] right here right now at the same place
[1:46:17] you know you know and death and life are
[1:46:19] fighting
[1:46:20] right here you know deliverance and
[1:46:22] bondage are fighting right here
[1:46:24] you know you know doubting and all those
[1:46:26] things you know they are fighting right
[1:46:28] here
[1:46:28] it just depends on what you want to
[1:46:30] listen to you know what you want to
[1:46:32] believe in
[1:46:33] you know if you see that you know doubt
[1:46:35] is stronger than your faith
[1:46:37] then you know you have doubt and
[1:46:38] whatever you ask you want you will never
[1:46:40] see them
[1:46:41] but but you know it don't matter how
[1:46:43] weak you feel you don't matter how many
[1:46:45] times you've asked god and then you
[1:46:47] have no result you know you just keep
[1:46:49] asking him you know you just keep
[1:46:51] having faith you know he knows you he
[1:46:53] knows what level of your faith that you
[1:46:55] have
[1:46:55] you know he knows everything he knows
[1:46:57] when and how to give it to you but
[1:46:59] sometimes
[1:47:00] we want god to respond to our prayers
[1:47:02] according to our own
[1:47:04] you know according to ourselves you know
[1:47:06] you prayed god lord uh
[1:47:09] lord i have some bills to pay and and i
[1:47:11] i need money and then
[1:47:13] right right after your prayer you try to
[1:47:15] imagine you know i'm gonna go out and
[1:47:16] i will see this man and i wanna when i
[1:47:19] say hi to him and then say you know
[1:47:20] brother what
[1:47:21] i had this one i wanted to give you and
[1:47:23] then it happens and you see the same
[1:47:25] rather you were thinking
[1:47:26] and then he doesn't give you anything
[1:47:28] and then that weakens you know that will
[1:47:30] try to weaken your faith a little bit
[1:47:32] you know god gives us god respond to us
[1:47:35] is how he wants to respond and when he
[1:47:37] wants to respond
[1:47:39] but many but most of the time we want
[1:47:40] god to respond to us according to
[1:47:42] ourselves
[1:47:43] you know we want god to respond right
[1:47:45] away at the right you know it's good i
[1:47:47] mean i'd rather have my answers you know
[1:47:49] every time i ask god and then
[1:47:50] you know you have the answers right away
[1:47:52] but sometimes it just does doesn't work
[1:47:54] that way
[1:47:55] you know sometimes you have to work a
[1:47:57] little bit you know to have your
[1:47:59] your response you know sometimes god can
[1:48:01] lead you to a path
[1:48:02] you know that will give you the response
[1:48:05] you know i remember a long time ago i
[1:48:06] was
[1:48:07] i had a question about the bible i
[1:48:09] wanted to understand
[1:48:11] you know to understand because i was
[1:48:13] reading the bible and i saw the
[1:48:15] you know the crucifixion of jesus all
[1:48:17] those time that the bible mentioned
[1:48:20] you know to myself i said well god if
[1:48:22] you mention those times that
[1:48:23] you know they're important for something
[1:48:25] and i want to know how you know why
[1:48:26] they're important
[1:48:27] you know i and then what one after you
[1:48:29] know when i when i prayed that you know
[1:48:32] in my mind
[1:48:33] you know some brothers that i know you
[1:48:34] know they love bible studies and
[1:48:36] they know the word you know i was like
[1:48:38] yeah let me go ask them then i'll have
[1:48:39] the answer you know rather way
[1:48:41] but the thing that happened that i went
[1:48:42] i asked those brothers and none of them
[1:48:44] could give me the answer that i was
[1:48:45] satisfied
[1:48:46] so i went back again to god i was like
[1:48:48] lord you know i tried to get the answer
[1:48:50] but i couldn't
[1:48:51] now i depend on you you know i had to
[1:48:53] wait i think for a week or two days i
[1:48:55] don't remember when
[1:48:56] and then god told me i had to go read
[1:48:58] the sixth year
[1:48:59] and then by reading that and then it
[1:49:01] wasn't even you know
[1:49:02] in the beginning of the sermon it was
[1:49:04] right at last but you know the last part
[1:49:05] of the sermon
[1:49:06] that i got my answer you know it didn't
[1:49:08] matter how long it take or the journey
[1:49:10] that i had to go through
[1:49:12] the result is i had the answer and i
[1:49:14] understood whatever god wanted me to
[1:49:16] understand
[1:49:17] and that's the only thing that i care
[1:49:19] you know you might you know
[1:49:20] you might be praying god and then the
[1:49:23] devil and then
[1:49:24] the doctor says that hey you can't leave
[1:49:26] you only have a few hours to leave
[1:49:28] you know but still have faith you know
[1:49:30] believe god
[1:49:31] god is a god who always works those
[1:49:33] impossibilities
[1:49:34] you know every time that we think that
[1:49:36] the situation is impossible to us
[1:49:38] you know that's when god worked peter
[1:49:40] you know certainly he thought that this
[1:49:42] is impossible i'm going to jail today
[1:49:44] because i didn't get any fish you know i
[1:49:46] can't pay my tax i can't pay my bills
[1:49:49] my mom is at home she's sick you know i
[1:49:51] can't i can't do anything
[1:49:53] you know she needs i need money and the
[1:49:55] only way i know to get money is to fish
[1:49:57] to have some fish
[1:49:58] now it is you know morning is here and i
[1:50:01] have nothing
[1:50:02] so i spent first of all i spent all my
[1:50:04] time my energy
[1:50:05] you know trying to look for money and i
[1:50:06] don't i didn't have you know peter
[1:50:08] certainly
[1:50:09] you know he had those thoughts you know
[1:50:11] he asked god
[1:50:12] and you know he certainly asked god and
[1:50:16] said lord
[1:50:17] you know i need this and i want to get
[1:50:19] some fish
[1:50:20] but the result you know seem to be
[1:50:23] against his will
[1:50:24] but he didn't know one thing that joy
[1:50:26] was coming in the morning
[1:50:28] that he didn't know one thing that his
[1:50:30] night was a little bit longer than
[1:50:32] you know than the average night but
[1:50:34] certainly by joy will always come in the
[1:50:35] morning
[1:50:36] you know that morning will always come
[1:50:38] you know because god's promise
[1:50:40] you know god the way you set the nature
[1:50:42] you know there are people who
[1:50:44] sometimes you know they might have like
[1:50:46] three months of night
[1:50:48] but even though that night you know
[1:50:51] darkness lasts for three months or six
[1:50:53] months
[1:50:54] they knew for sure that this will have
[1:50:55] an end and morning the sun will always
[1:50:58] come
[1:50:58] you know that knew for the know for sure
[1:51:00] that this you know it's
[1:51:02] it only has a period and then the sun
[1:51:04] will always come
[1:51:05] you know that's the same thing that we
[1:51:06] have to have as christian you know we
[1:51:08] have to believe in god's word
[1:51:11] you know if we ask god we have to have
[1:51:14] faith
[1:51:14] you know whatever we ask him you know he
[1:51:17] will always come and he will always give
[1:51:18] us whatever we need
[1:51:20] he will always give us the prophet says
[1:51:23] in closing
[1:51:24] that who kept you from from that act
[1:51:27] from that accident
[1:51:28] the other day who let that baby get well
[1:51:34] who paid that gross reveal for you
[1:51:37] it was him but you just don't recognize
[1:51:41] him
[1:51:42] who is who who who is he uh who is the
[1:51:46] person who gives you
[1:51:47] health to come out to come out to the
[1:51:50] church tonight
[1:51:51] or this morning it's him but you don't
[1:51:54] recognize it
[1:51:56] oh if we could only do as them
[1:52:00] just beat me to come did you make me
[1:52:03] just beat him to come
[1:52:05] you know just invite him you know who
[1:52:07] paid all of that
[1:52:08] you know before i i just thought about
[1:52:11] this before
[1:52:12] i wanted to start my sermon by asking
[1:52:15] you know how many people has experienced
[1:52:17] god in a certain way you know if it
[1:52:19] doesn't matter healing or
[1:52:21] you know how how you know however you
[1:52:23] know that experience was but
[1:52:25] how many people have experienced god
[1:52:27] that you knew for sure that this is not
[1:52:28] me this is this is god
[1:52:30] you know i'm pretty sure that everybody
[1:52:32] has experienced god in some way
[1:52:33] you know that same god that you had
[1:52:35] experienced i don't know
[1:52:37] how long it was five years four years
[1:52:39] three years yesterday or whatever
[1:52:41] you know it's still the same god you
[1:52:44] know that that's that god is still the
[1:52:45] same god
[1:52:46] you know the the same god who thought
[1:52:48] about you that day that you couldn't get
[1:52:50] over
[1:52:51] that situation and then he came he's
[1:52:53] still the same god today to answer to
[1:52:55] your prayer
[1:52:56] you know he's still the same god today
[1:52:58] to give you whatever you're asking

[1:53:01] or how impossible that thing that thing
[1:53:03] can look
[1:53:04] you know it doesn't matter how
[1:53:06] impossible that thing can seem to you
[1:53:08] you know of course to you it's
[1:53:09] impossible of course to your doctors
[1:53:11] it's impossible because your family you
[1:53:13] know it's impossible but to god it's not
[1:53:15] impossible
[1:53:16] and the bible says that if you know you
[1:53:18] know if you believe in god
[1:53:20] everything is everything is possible to
[1:53:22] him that believeth
[1:53:23] you know every everything is possible to
[1:53:25] give them without that
[1:53:26] to whom they believe in you know you
[1:53:28] just have to believe in god
[1:53:30] you know you know it doesn't matter how
[1:53:31] big the situation can be
[1:53:33] you know it doesn't matter how how hard
[1:53:36] you know you have tried you know hard
[1:53:38] you know you have tried your best to get
[1:53:41] over it but you just can't
[1:53:43] you know there's just something that
[1:53:45] that you just can't get we just can't
[1:53:47] away with
[1:53:48] you know you have come and and the
[1:53:50] prayer meeting i don't know how many
[1:53:52] times but
[1:53:53] but there is just no satisfaction
[1:53:56] you know you've asked things you know to
[1:53:58] god but but there's you're not just
[1:54:00] satisfied
[1:54:01] you know you have to be careful
[1:54:02] sometimes you know sometimes
[1:54:05] it's the devil you know trying to tell
[1:54:07] you that you have not received
[1:54:09] you know what you what you were looking
[1:54:10] for but god has already given to you
[1:54:13] you know you know you have to have faith
[1:54:15] you know the bible says that if you ask
[1:54:17] god
[1:54:18] that this might be that this mountain be
[1:54:20] removed and the bible says that
[1:54:22] you know if you believe that this
[1:54:24] mountain has already been removed
[1:54:27] you will see it you know it might take
[1:54:29] longer you know god certainly when he
[1:54:31] created the earth and
[1:54:32] and he said that they let there be light
[1:54:34] you know the light
[1:54:35] didn't come up the same day or the same
[1:54:37] hour that you spoke the word
[1:54:39] you know sometimes it took probably took
[1:54:41] 500 years for the light to come
[1:54:43] up but you know probably took 900
[1:54:46] you know years well um a hundred years
[1:54:50] for the for the light to come up you
[1:54:51] know probably maybe it took
[1:54:53] longer you know that we don't know but
[1:54:55] the light
[1:54:56] you know was there you know it didn't
[1:54:58] matter how long
[1:54:59] they like to you know how long the
[1:55:01] process was
[1:55:03] but it was but it was still there you
[1:55:05] know when god says that
[1:55:06] you know let let there be a heaven and
[1:55:08] and and then the earth
[1:55:10] you know probably for for for the water
[1:55:12] to to leave the earth and then go to
[1:55:14] heaven it was a long process
[1:55:16] but god never not even one time
[1:55:19] disbelieved his own word
[1:55:21] you know he knew for sure as i
[1:55:22] pronounced those words
[1:55:24] you know that will come you know and
[1:55:26] then you know and those
[1:55:28] the the the the thing that he said you
[1:55:30] know came to pass
[1:55:31] you know god's word says that ask
[1:55:33] whatever you need
[1:55:34] amen you know you ask it you know let's
[1:55:37] let's
[1:55:37] let's read to isaiah chapter one
[1:55:43] isaiah chapter one uh
[1:55:46] it's been a long time since i read this
[1:55:49] verse
[1:55:52] i think verse 18 verse 18
[1:55:55] isaiah chapter 1 verse 18.
[1:56:00] this isn't an invite you know an
[1:56:02] invitation god is inviting us to a
[1:56:04] conference
[1:56:08] the bible says that come now let us
[1:56:12] reason together
[1:56:13] saith the lord though your sins
[1:56:17] be as scarlet they shall be as white as
[1:56:20] snow
[1:56:21] amen though they be red like crimson
[1:56:25] there shall be as wounds if you
[1:56:28] be willing and obedient you shall eat
[1:56:31] the good
[1:56:32] of the land you know god is calling come
[1:56:35] let us reason together you know we have
[1:56:38] to be happy about that god
[1:56:41] you know calling us come let us reason
[1:56:44] together you know let us
[1:56:46] talk about this situation together and
[1:56:48] find the solution
[1:56:50] you know the prophet used this scripture
[1:56:52] to preach the
[1:56:53] the message conference and then he said
[1:56:56] that whenever
[1:56:57] there's a conference there must be a
[1:56:59] problem
[1:57:00] and then whenever there's a conference
[1:57:03] you know we have to have solution
[1:57:05] at the end of the conference you know
[1:57:06] sometimes you know with humans sometimes
[1:57:08] we're not because we
[1:57:09] sometimes we have this ego we don't want
[1:57:11] you know other person to win or
[1:57:13] but with god you know there's always a
[1:57:15] solution
[1:57:17] you know but god now is calling us what
[1:57:19] you know what's your problem
[1:57:20] it's the same thing as he asking you
[1:57:22] what what is your problem
[1:57:24] you know what is that mountain that you
[1:57:26] cannot climb you know what is that
[1:57:28] valley
[1:57:29] that you cannot go through what is that
[1:57:30] river that you cannot cross
[1:57:32] you know what is that thing that is
[1:57:34] troubling you that you can't get
[1:57:36] that you can't get away that you can't
[1:57:38] get over with
[1:57:39] you know what is that thing that you
[1:57:41] just can't sleep without thinking about
[1:57:43] that
[1:57:43] you know come let us let us talk it over
[1:57:46] you know come let us reason together
[1:57:48] you know because we need to find a
[1:57:50] solution but sometimes
[1:57:52] you know we are the persons or the
[1:57:54] people who fail
[1:57:56] to go to that meeting to that conference
[1:57:59] you know god has called us so many times
[1:58:02] but sometimes we just fail
[1:58:04] to go to that conference now he is
[1:58:06] here's again he's calling you to that
[1:58:08] he's giving you the same
[1:58:09] invitation he said come
[1:58:13] go reason with him you know go think
[1:58:16] about how to solve this pollution
[1:58:18] you know he already has the solution but
[1:58:19] he just wants to you know to invite you
[1:58:22] to come and then to explain to you the
[1:58:24] process how everything will go
[1:58:26] you just have to open your mind you just
[1:58:28] have to open your faith you just have to
[1:58:30] open yourself and say lord here i am
[1:58:32] speak you know it's like samuel god
[1:58:36] called him
[1:58:37] he had to be willing to say lord speak
[1:58:39] because i listen
[1:58:41] you know god has this word is given to
[1:58:43] you you know this word has been written
[1:58:46] you know for for for a long time now
[1:58:50] you know this word has been tested in
[1:58:52] every every direction in every area
[1:58:55] and this word has never failed not even
[1:58:57] one time
[1:58:59] you know this word that's not even
[1:59:01] friend not even one time the prophet
[1:59:02] says that
[1:59:03] that god has never failed him not even
[1:59:06] one time
[1:59:07] you know everything that he asked god
[1:59:09] god always gave it to him or
[1:59:10] god would you know lately god would tell
[1:59:12] him why he didn't give it to him
[1:59:14] you know because he had faith you know
[1:59:16] and then after
[1:59:18] that promise was not only for the
[1:59:19] prophet you know the promise was for
[1:59:21] everybody for the bride and for all the
[1:59:23] believers
[1:59:24] just if you have faith in god you know
[1:59:27] you'll be you
[1:59:28] if you if you have faith in god a
[1:59:30] musician can come
[1:59:32] if you have faith in god you can ask
[1:59:33] whatever you need and god will give it
[1:59:36] to you
[1:59:37] you know god will never fail you you
[1:59:39] know he promised it
[1:59:40] you know the children of israel the
[1:59:42] three hebrews children you know they
[1:59:43] knew god's promise was that if we stand
[1:59:45] for god god will be god will stand for
[1:59:47] us
[1:59:48] you know maybe they didn't expect god to
[1:59:50] show up but they knew for some reason
[1:59:52] that we were not a bower
[1:59:54] we would not bow down and worship this
[1:59:55] evil but you know they stood in that
[1:59:58] word and god showed up
[1:59:59] you know to prove to us that god's word
[2:00:02] you know will always come god's promised
[2:00:04] you know abraham a son after 25 years
[2:00:07] god gave them a son
[2:00:09] you know god god after you know god
[2:00:11] promised you know
[2:00:12] elizabeth you know a son you know about
[2:00:15] his
[2:00:16] her husband prayed for his son for how
[2:00:18] many years i don't know
[2:00:20] about god at the end of the day god gave
[2:00:21] him a son you know a son who
[2:00:24] introduced jesus christ you know god you
[2:00:26] know promised a deliverer
[2:00:28] you know it does it didn't matter how
[2:00:30] many years the old testament lasted
[2:00:32] god finally sent us a deliverer you know
[2:00:35] god you know they said that he will send
[2:00:36] you malachi
[2:00:37] 4. you know we didn't know how long but
[2:00:40] he certainly didn't
[2:00:41] you know all that shows that god's
[2:00:43] promise has never failed
[2:00:45] you know i'm pretty sure that there's
[2:00:46] been a time that you asked god something
[2:00:48] and then you saw the result
[2:00:50] you know you saw how god blessed you or
[2:00:52] how god you know answered your prayer
[2:00:54] you know you might be a prayer just to
[2:00:57] avoid the punishment
[2:00:58] or because i remember when i was a
[2:00:59] little boy that was most of my prayers
[2:01:01] you know i prayed that god you know
[2:01:03] please touch my dad not to beat me
[2:01:05] you know and then he worked you know it
[2:01:07] might be you know those simple prayers
[2:01:09] but you had faith and then you saw the
[2:01:12] result
[2:01:12] you know it was god training you or
[2:01:15] building your faith
[2:01:16] you know you just have to have that same
[2:01:18] faith you know that same little faith
[2:01:20] that you had you know when you asked
[2:01:22] when you first asked the first thing to
[2:01:23] god
[2:01:24] and then god gave it to you you know
[2:01:26] that's the same thing that god needs to
[2:01:28] now god is requiring right now please
[2:01:30] let's stand
[2:01:33] and say you know set your wings in the
[2:01:36] wings
[2:01:40] you know if you can only set your wings
[2:01:42] to the winds of faith
[2:01:44] you know god you know let the wings
[2:01:48] you know drive you through you know you
[2:01:50] don't have to do any effort the prophet
[2:01:52] says that
[2:01:53] one time you went you know uh uh
[2:01:56] he went he wanted he was seeing an ego
[2:01:58] and then he tried to scare that ego a
[2:02:00] little bit
[2:02:01] and he noticed one thing that the ego
[2:02:03] had to flop his
[2:02:04] wings just two times and then when he
[2:02:07] got up
[2:02:08] up higher the ego just set his wings
[2:02:12] you know and then he let the wind drive
[2:02:15] him
[2:02:15] you know that's what we need to do
[2:02:17] sometimes you know we just need to for
[2:02:19] to surrender and then
[2:02:21] say god you know come and then drive me
[2:02:23] lord
[2:02:24] i'm weak lord you know that i don't have
[2:02:26] faith lord
[2:02:28] and but i'm just asking lord please
[2:02:30] strengthen me give me
[2:02:32] faith and god will certainly give you
[2:02:34] the faith

[2:02:38] you know
[2:02:41] you know if you if you just have faith
[2:02:44] you know god god will give you god will
[2:02:46] give you whatever you need
[2:02:48] you know sometimes it might take longer
[2:02:49] than you expect you know usually it
[2:02:51] takes longer than we expect
[2:02:53] you know sometimes you might have the
[2:02:54] result the same day
[2:02:56] but you just have faith you know the
[2:02:58] same thing you know as god says that you
[2:03:01] know
[2:03:01] never a child can go to his father and
[2:03:03] ask for a food and then the father give
[2:03:05] him a snake
[2:03:06] you know that's the same thing with god
[2:03:08] you know we can now
[2:03:09] ask for something good and then god
[2:03:11] gives us something bad

[2:09:03] let's grace dear heavenly father
[2:09:08] lord we thank you father god for the
[2:09:10] time
[2:09:13] lord you know it was hard for me father
[2:09:16] god to express
[2:09:17] whatever father god you have put in my
[2:09:19] mouth lord jesus
[2:09:22] though sometimes looking for the right
[2:09:24] word of father god to say the right
[2:09:25] thing
[2:09:27] the symptoms of father god my lord and
[2:09:30] saying
[2:09:30] two words at the same time so father god
[2:09:33] complicating the readings
[2:09:35] but lord you saw us through all
[2:09:38] jesus and lord jesus you wanted father
[2:09:41] god whatever that was saying the father
[2:09:43] got to be saved
[2:09:45] because there was a person or somebody
[2:09:47] wanted to listen to the same word
[2:09:50] lord here we are father god as your
[2:09:52] children o lord
[2:09:53] lord as the song says that our faith
[2:09:55] looks up to you
[2:09:57] lord we have asked you so father god so
[2:10:00] many things are father
[2:10:01] multiple things the lord thinks that
[2:10:04] sometimes we think that it's impossible
[2:10:06] father god to have
[2:10:07] but lord we believe in god who always
[2:10:10] works the impossibilities
[2:10:12] though we pray oh father god that you
[2:10:14] give us whatever we desire
[2:10:16] we pray our father god that you go with
[2:10:18] us so father lord
[2:10:19] that you bless us to father god through
[2:10:21] the week the wick of father god
[2:10:24] and let us so father god be lord the
[2:10:26] light of the world
[2:10:28] though to show your light or father god
[2:10:30] and then when we'll come back with
[2:10:31] father god we may come back with
[2:10:33] testimonies of father
[2:10:34] saying that i ask this thing to the lord
[2:10:37] and here's the result
[2:10:38] and the lord has given me and lord how
[2:10:41] long it takes so father god we already
[2:10:43] father god to take that road
[2:10:45] but lord we just want to keep the faith
[2:10:47] though we know
[2:10:48] for sure that lord it won't be easy
[2:10:50] father god lord the devil will always
[2:10:52] come to our mind or father
[2:10:54] putting negative thoughts on father lord
[2:10:56] but we want to
[2:10:57] every time that those thoughts will come
[2:10:59] that your word
[2:11:00] may be standing against it oh father god
[2:11:02] and your word always overcome
[2:11:04] though we thank you father god we give
[2:11:06] you all the glory
[2:11:08] in jesus christ amen
[2:11:22] amen
[2:11:24] [Music]
[2:11:36] amen so everything is in that name amen
[2:11:39] so let's just sing that saying that
