something I'm about to burn up up here I am so hot I tried operating it earlier I might have messed it [Music] up we're going to come from Psalms the eth chapter or eth division of Psalms the first verse Exodus 15 and 3 real simple message but I trust it'll be a blessing to you we we really in order to go higher we we need to know what we're going high higher into we must understand that um Paul described it as this he said my uh my life is hid in Christ Jesus so our greatest aim is to make sure that our lives are in [Music] Christ amen amen Psalms 8 and 1 he says oh Lord our Lord how excellent is thy name in all the Earth who have set thy Glory above the heavens you shook the earth and the saints that slept in the ground come out you blacken the sun in the night no don't no I'm I'm reading the quote now I'm sorry you blacken the sun in the night as the darkness of of the night showing that you were once God but you seem to be silent so long amen amen Exodus 15 and3 the Lord is a man of war the Lord is his name amen God is good to us let us pray father God we come before you as humbly as we know how we thank you for go your goodness we thank you for your grace we thank you for your Supernatural influences that you have on our lives our lives are is your life and your life is our life and father I pray that you give us Revelation understanding of our position in you and we'll be careful to give you the praise Glory and Honor in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated my subject tonight Jesus the name of the almighty God we know that the name Jesus also means Jehovah savior it is also the same name as Joshua some people say yesu but we must understand why it's important to understand the person of Jesus Christ because if we know the word we understand he is the alpha as well as the Omega Jesus stressed or God stressed to Israel and important fact he said know ye Israel the Lord he is God and he also said the Lord thy God is one it's very important in this day idolatry is flourishing people are worshiping everything even themselves but we must recognize that there is a place of hiding the psalmist said the name of the Lord is a strong towel and the righteous run in and they are safe [Music] but this same invisible God thought within himself to become man and this was a great event because we realized that throughout all of the ages God shadowed and typed himself and but they come that was to come a day that God was going to do a miraculous thing it in itself proves that God can do whatever he wants to do let's turn to Matthew 1 remember we're not talking about a second God we're not talking about the third one we're talking about the God the almighty God remember even after the resurrection of Jesus the Bible said all power in heaven and in Earth was given to him am hallelujah hallelujah and if all power in Heaven and Earth was given to him where does it leave the other gods the mystery of God is a revelation when you read the Bible sometimes you'll see two and sometimes you'll see three that's when you're looking in your natural eyes but in the spiritual if you fully understand the revelation of God you understand that he's one now you better you better listen to what I'm saying every Christian ought to be able to explain to the nonbeliever and the unbeliever and those who think they believe the position of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah matthew2 to2 but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take on the the Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and look how he says it and she shall bring forth a son and thou shall call him Jesus remember Jesus mean Jehovah Savior for he shall save his people from their sins now all of this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted God With Us hallelujah hallelujah this is very important because as I said if you don't see the Oneness of God you never see how you become one with God hallelujah God in flesh Luke 134 through3 is important cuz you'll see and understand it wasn't a second man or second person that died for you it was God in human flesh God became the [Music] sacrifice then said Mary unto the angel how shall this thing be seeing I know not a man you and I I grew up believing that Jesus was part Jew believing that Mary had something to do with it [Music] but we understand if Mary had had had had anything to do with it the blood would have been contaminated it would not have been pure enough to save nobody not even me hallelujah hallelujah so God created the egg and the life jour everything that was in Mary it was God building a house building a body that he might occupy it live within it this was a great statement when when when Jesus was at the Jordan being baptized by John and the spirit of the Lord descended mind you everybody didn't see the spirit everybody didn't see the dove the only person who saw the dove was Jesus and John Hallelujah and the Bible said the Holy Spirit descended like a dove and sat upon him and then there was a voice saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased Towell now it looks it looks like two the father or three to some people the do and the son Hallelujah but you got to realize the dove was there for John as a sign Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying and then the voice in itself was the same voice amen that said on mou Transfiguration Hallelujah Jesus only hear ye him so when you see these things you say how can it be God can do whatever he wants to do but I know people use that to say well it's Trinity or two or two some people believe two was in John St John 10:30 Jesus said my father and I we are one figure that one out the point is Jesus was the house of God but God was the one dwelling in the house hallelujah hallelujah yall understand me I live at 292 12 Southwest White birs Drive 21 12 Southwest White birs drivewest Drive hallelujah hallelujah that's the house I live in but the house is not me hallelujah hallelujah I live in this house but this house is not me oh come on somebody all you got to do is close your eyes and you'll be able to see you you are made of spirit Hallelujah and you live within this house how many of y'all view viewed brother Keith you can see that he was not at home hallelujah hallelujah he had left his house to live in another house that we call Theon Hallelujah that's why Paul said if this Earthly Tabernacle be designed I have a building I've got another house that I'm going to Hallelujah Hallelujah like the prophet of God said you've never seen me Hallelujah you've seen my house but you never seen me Hallelujah I've never seen you but I've seen your house and I know who lives there Hallelujah glory to God is that all right this go should be he should be called The Son of God Isaiah 96 is important because we must know what we're becoming the Bible said we are new creation and that's exactly what it means it is a new [Applause] creation going where's the new creation in the inside of this damnable flesh y'all hear what what's happening on the inside of me has nothing to do with this thing you understand me because God has given me a rebirth the old man the world knew about him but the new man they know nothing about but the new man is born after the Creator flesh of his flesh bone of his bone y y'all hear what I'm saying I'm talk telling you now Jesus is the name of the almighty [Music] God Isaiah 96 For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace hallelujah hallelujah but his name shall be called but his real his full name is there's a difference between being called something and actually the name is my children can call me Daddy but my name is Isaiah Brooks Hallelujah we call him wonderful but his name is Jesus Christ we call him our counselor but his name is Jesus Christ we call call him the Mighty God but his name is Jesus Christ hello we call him the Everlasting father but his name is Jesus Christ we call him the Prince of Peace but his name is Jesus Christ y'all hear what I'm saying so when he said go ye therefore into all nations and baptize him in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost what's God's name don't be afraid to say it because I look every when they said name everybody thought that he was saying the name was father and the name was son and the name was Holy Ghost the name that represents the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah and that name is Lord is the father Jesus who is the son Holy Ghost who is the spirit in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost well y'all getting quiet St John 1 10 through3 I'm trying to get through this cuz I'm not even where I want to [Music] be 10th verse he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not when was God in the world Amen he's always been here but when was he fully recognized through Jesus Christ he came into his own his own received and not who this it was Jesus who went to the Jews and the Jews rejected him he came unto his own and his own received a not I thought God created the world the Bible said he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not so if Jesus Christ created the world then where is the other God hallelujah hallelujah but as many has received him to them gave he the power to become the sons of God Jesus said after which the Holy Ghost has come upon you you shall receive power and the prophet of God said that power is Authority Hallelujah he told Nicodemus you must be born again not of the water but of the spirit which is flesh is flesh and that which is spirit is Spirit hallelujah oh wait a minute you say what are you saying brother Brooks this is the part I like Hallelujah he said even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood not of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God hey what are you saying even as Jesus God's Will made it happen when you receive the Holy Ghost it's not because you pleaded all night or you begged him all night no no no no no because in his mind before the foundation of the world not only did he justifi you he Sanctified you he called you he knew your name and he knew at the very moment he was going to give you the Holy Ghost Hallelujah but think about it you would have never been able to receive the Holy Ghost if it had not been for Calvary Hallelujah and whether people want to believe it or not the Holy Ghost is God there's only one Holy Spirit there's not one two or three there's only one that's right amen prise God turn in your worship see when you realize who he is somebody asked me I heard on the radio sometime ago on one of those Christian radios I don't really listen to that stuff but years ago somebody asked them when we get to heaven who we who are we going to see first the Father the Son of the Holy Spirit well I'll tell you what that sponsor couldn't answer it answer it they they jumped the subject and I was I was on the other end like let me let me let me Hallelujah the one you going to see is the one on the throne and go to your book in The Book of Revelation the said Jesus is the Alpha and Omega it starts off with the revelation of Jesus Christ not the revelation of the Trinity or the revelation of two Gods but the revelation of Jesus Christ he's the alpha the Omega the beginning the end the first and the last Hallelujah that's who he is oh my God that's who he is amen yes hallah thank you Lord and the Bible says only one sat on the throne amen when we get to heaven who we going to be seeing when you die who you going to see sir am hallelujah hallelujah all power in Heaven and Earth was given unto him amen well you sure what Jesus said I couldn't do nothing except my father show me that was the man Jesus you can't do nothing I can't do nothing except the father show me well who is the father the Holy Ghost and who is the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah the Bible said in word and In Deed do all in the name of Jesus Christ everything if you pray you got to pray in Jesus name if you sing you got to sing in Jesus name if you live you got to live in Jesus name Hallelujah everything to do it in the name of Jesus why why do we do it because at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that Jesus is Lord to the glory of the father hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Revelations 5 12 through 14 he's God and we're being formed and shaped into His Image that's what the Bible said we're born of God we're born of God when you get the Holy Ghost you get the Holy Ghost in Jesus name when you get baptized you get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus you got to do it all in the name of Jesus Revelation 51 12-4 Hallelujah saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing let me let me say it like this you can never put God in a box God is a spirit and in order for us to see God God had to cond sin I Marvel at him like I said I was in a plane not long ago and I'm looking down and I can't even see a man as we as we descend I saw caus and trucks before I could see a man and I said oh my God forgive our ignorance forgive our foolishness when we think we're great hallelujah hallelujah we're not even big as an Adam compared to the y'all hear what I'm saying hallelujah yet my God and your God can see you in spite of everything he hears what you can what you think he sees what you see Hallelujah the Bible said he knows your thoughts are far off I'm talking my God God hallelujah and that same God has put him self in you and said let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus who thought it not robbery to be equal with God hallelujah glory to God do yall understand what I'm saying this is a scientifically if I knew how to describe this God has made you basically each and every one of us a universe glory amen hallelujah hallelujah within you is dynamite there's such a power in you that even the prophet said you have the ability to create world and go live on it now I don't know about you but when I think about those kind of thoughts I know it it can only be Jesus Hallelujah he's the only one that can create he's the only one that I know created everything and then came and lived on it hallelujah what a mighty God we serve hallelujah oh Jesus there hallelujah hallelujah there's no name like the mighty name of Jesus Hallelujah revelation 5 Hallelujah 13th verse every creature which is in heaven and on Earth and under the Earth as such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I saying blessed and honor glory and power be unto him that sth upon the throne Hallelujah and unto the lamb forever and ever hallelujah what are you talking about brother Brooks I'm talking about the name of the Lord ought to be praised Hallelujah the name of the Lord need to be lifted up he said if my name be lifted up I will draw all men unto me I'm I'm going to show you something I had never seen before and the four Beast said amen and the four and 20 Elders fell down and worshiped him that live forever and ever wa now you can't worship no other God but you mean the uh the the Jews the Patriarchs of the Jews the 12 12 lead leadership leaders of the Jewish Tri 12 tribes and then the 12 apostles the 24 Elders fell down and worshiped him Hallelujah he must be God he has to be God this this worship wasn't going on in Earth this was going on in heaven Hallelujah glory to God y'all better hear what I'm saying we need to we need to know our position see we serve a Kingdom that cannot be cursed Hallelujah you understand what I'm saying that means you can not be cursed who God has blessed is blessed hallelujah hallelujah and nothing can remove that blessing from you Hallelujah listen Colossians 3:16-17 hallelujah hallelujah Colossians 3:16-17 let the word of Christ dwell in you richly and all wisd teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns in spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts toward the lord toward the lord toward the lord and whatsoever you do in word or deed do all In The Name Of The Lord Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him what are you saying you recognize who he is he is the god he is the father but his name is the Lord Jesus Christ so when you recognize Father Son and Holy Ghost you're recognizing Jesus the Lord Jesus Christ how you want to say it but when you say the Lord let me tell you something that's why the devil don't mind if you say God Satan don't get upset when you say God is good but when you start calling on the name of Jesus when you mention that name it shake hell up Hallelujah you better hear what I'm saying at the name of Jesus Christ the Bible said that the demons tremble like like I heard that brother say the other day when you are sick and you don't know what else to do you need to give God a good praise call on the name of Jesus at the name of Jes you you just need a good worship service because the Holy Spirit God inhabits the praise of his people if you just give the devil trembles at the name he don't want you to worship God but when you worship God call on the name of Jesus Hallelujah something has to happen Hallelujah yes sir Philippians 2 9 through1 glory to God wherefore God also have highly exalted [Music] him and giving him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow of things in heaven of things in Earth and things on the earth Hallelujah and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father what are you talking about even the Devil Himself has to confess that Jesus is the Lord you say Pro that to me when Jesus was crossing over the river Hallelujah uh gathering over Gathering amen but anyhow the man who had a thousand demons Hallelujah he said what what did you why did you come here Jesus have you come to to torment us before our time the Lord hadn't even opened his mouth Hallelujah but one thing about Darkness they know when you're carrying the light hallelujah hallelujah y'all remember the the sons OFA he was a a Pharisee hallelujah hallelujah and here he was those sons of skas were seven and they tried to cast out devils and they tried to cast out Devils by the way Paul preached Hallelujah but let me say this to you when you got the Holy Ghost the devil got about Hallelujah but if you don't have the Holy Ghost you better know what you're doing Hallelujah because those Devils didn't care about their daddy being a Pharisee he didn't care about them knowing the scripture come out about by the way that the the god that Paul preaches that won't work Hallelujah they only come by the out by the God you know you got to know him and he's got to know you Hallelujah and when God knows you all hell know you y'all better hear what I'm saying the news get around like I heard the brother say the devil done got nervous because I woke up this [Applause] morning hallelujah hallelujah you ought to make the dev Nish every time you wake up glory to God hallelujah hallelujah the resurrection is preached in Jesus name is that right hallelujah hallelujah Act 4 just follow me through this now you love the Lord oh my it's going home time again at the first verse of the fourth verse fourth chapter excuse me and as they spake unto the people the priest and the captains of the temple and the Sadducees Came Upon them being grieved that they taught the people and preach through Jesus the resurrection from the dead did you hear he said here they were preaching Jesus teaching teaching the people and preach through Jesus you understand what was happening they were telling about Jesus resurrection Hallelujah and that through that Resurrection all hell was conquered Hallelujah and though you be dead yet shall you live see they didn't want to hear that the Pharisees wanted their laws and their rules and their regulations but here with these people preaching the resurrection let me tell you something you can't even preach the gospel without preaching the resurrection hallelujah hallelujah and brother brand said that's the greatest message you can preach is the gospel amen cuz until you born again you don't even understand what he's saying any Hallelujah surely the disciples remember I'm surely the disciples remember what Jesus preached at the tomb of Lazarus I am the resurrection and I am the life Hallelujah come on if he's the resurrection and the life how many lives is there there's only one life and that life is eternal life and that life is God's life hallelujah hallelujah and they laid hands on them and put them in hold until the next day for it was now even time how be it many of them which heard the word believed and the number of men was about 5,000 and it came to pass on tomorrow that their rulers and elders and scribes and Anna the high priest and caias and John and Alexander as many as were of the Kindred of the high priest were gathered together at Jerusalem and when they had had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have you done this Hallelujah and then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and Elders of Israel if we this day be examon of the good deed done to the impotent man by what mean he is made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified who God raised from the dead even by him does this man stand here before you whole hallel no other way Hallelujah no other way this is the stone which was set at not of the builders which has become the head of the corner Hallelujah here it is neither is there salvation in any other oh hallelujah hallelujah for there is no other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved Hallelujah is that all right now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and men they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they have been with who Jesus and beholding a man which was healed standing with them they they could say nothing against it now I'm saying all of this is because once the revelation of who the the Christians when they received their revelation of who they were they never backed up they never backed where the Christians fall today is because we remember what we used to be and every time you turn back looking at what you used to be you lost your Authority you lost your power hallelujah hallelujah and you need to be repenting and asking to restore back to you who you really are now I got a quote for it so I hold on cuz I'm coming and behold the man see I want to see God and we don't see him because we're still fighting with our identity hallelujah hallelujah if God is in you what you worried about it's not you that does do the works it's Christ in you that's doing the work but he needs you to remember who he is he's the almighty God hallelujah he's all powerful in you that's why he said ask anything in my name and believe it hallelujah hallelujah hear what I'm saying when we fail to realize who we are we forget our position in Christ Hallelujah when God has given us the authority but the devil is always there accusing you oh I got a word for you tonight he's always there accusing you but the devil is a liar you cannot be a sinner and a Sint at the same time you choose this day which you going to be are you going to be a sinner or you're going to be a saint and if you're going to be a saint you need to know what makes you a saint hallelujah hallelujah you need to know what makes you a saint it ain't your good works oh I didn't do wrong today that don't make you a samee Hallelujah Jesus Paid the price that's what makes you a saint That's What Makes You holy hallelujah hallelujah that's where the devil catches us we don't we don't deserve the blessings but tell me when did God curse you God blessed you and he never tried to curse you you're bless going blessed coming in your blessed going out you just blessed God knows you hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but as the prophet of God say God ain't looking at you once you gave your heart to the Lord all he can see is the blood of Jesus Hallelujah Hall that makes you invincible don't worry about the flesh the flesh is going to always be the flesh until God makes your change but God has promised you the chain you just be what you're supposed to be let the inner man rule the outer man Hallelujah glory to God and beholding the man which was heal standing with them they could say nothing against it but when they had commanded them to go side out of the council they conferred among themselves saying what shall we do to these men I like to see that stirring I'd like to see somebody get upset with me because of the name of Jesus Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying I'm waiting on it what shall we do with these men for that indeed a noble Miracle have been done by them is Manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem we cannot deny it that's what I'm saying we need those miraculous things happening Among Us that cannot be denied yall understand me it's the same God [Music] doing the same [Music] thing you got to believe who you are though you know Peter them understood Peter understood Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I the they knew what they possessed they did not allow Satan to take their experience away Hallelujah don't let the devil take your experience let him make you forget when God has brought you from hallelujah hallelujah but that is spread no further among the people let let us straight way threaten them that they may speak his for no more in the in this name see you got to understand the devil don't call care about what name you call but when you call on the name of Jesus he doesn't like that Hallelujah and they they and they call they and they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus but Peter and John answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God judge ye that's right for we cannot but speak the things we have seen and heard hallelujah oh it's true I've had people say when you preach so much in the name of Jesus you haven't mentioned anything brother bam said that is true that is so that's true ignorance brother brandham preached the word he preached what Jesus preached he preached what Paul preached there's no other urum Hallelujah but people are so ignorant hallelujah hallelujah you ain't even preached a message yet what is the message the message is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he's a God that changes not hallelujah hallelujah the prophet didn't preach himself he preached Jesus Christ he didn't point us to him he pointed us to Jesus Christ Hallelujah and you see that picture over there he said that's my Lord amen amen yes sir Hallelujah that's not doing the way with William brandham you that's not doing the way with William brandom you can't do away with William brandham you can't do away with Moses you can't do away with Noah Hallelujah you about to tell the whole story Hallelujah so when they had her further threaten them who going to stop me I don't mean no harm you can put me out your church I'm just saying not here but I'm just saying it doesn't matter what people think about me no more because I know where the power lay Hallelujah who's coming for you at the quick at the when when the dead is raised who we going to look for nobody but Jesus Christ Our Lord hallelujah y'all better hear what I'm saying he's the Lover of My Soul he's the lover of your soul Hallelujah that's it you love God so when they heard so when they had a further threatened them excuse me they let them go finding nothing how they punish them because of the People Too Many people yeah you're not going to whip them people they got they they got too many followers now for all men glorified God for that which was done for the man was about 40 years old of whom this miracle of healing was showed Hallelujah just let me hurry up and I'm okay and being let go they went to their own company and reported all the chief priest and Elders had said unto them and when they heard that this is where the praise go when they heard that they lifted up their voice to God with one Accord and said Lord Thou Art God which have made Heaven and Earth and the sea and all that in them is who are they worshiping they were worshiping the Lord Jesus they said Lord You Are God you made the heavens you made the Earth you made the sea and everything that's in it I don't know about you but how can the god that made everything in this little piece of dirt I don't know how but it is so Hallelujah and God is telling us I I I don't even know how to say it but this is not the end this is the beginning of something new come on somebody this is the beginning of something new we can't even imagine what is ahead of us hallelujah oh even if Keith could come back for a minute he not talk about how like brother he ain't going to talk about the fishing trips or whatever we went on all he could do was what brother br's wife said to him you you preached it but you have no idea what it's like and she said whatever you do you keep preaching that Holy Ghost you keep preaching that Holy Ghost Hallelujah is that right see Satan don't want you to know that he is defeated Hallelujah he's already defeated and he don't want you to know that you have actually been set free not partially completely don't let the devil cheat you you have you have the right to a full Resurrection Hallelujah don't let the devil cheat you Hallelujah because when God changes you he changes you hallelujah hallelujah that day on Calvary paragraph 75 hallelujah hallelujah he was a very lamb that Abel had in his mind and when he seen the promised seed of the woman he was a lamb that Daniel saw that was heun out of a mountain without hands he was a wheel in the middle of the wheel for the prophets all for they fora was met on that day what day that day at Calvary hallelujah hallelujah so when they saw the whe and the whe that was Christ when they saw a rock he out of the mountain that was Christ y'all better hear what I'm saying all of the shadows and types was shadowing typing the real object and the real object was Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah and on that day I don't think the devil knew what he what hit him Hallelujah because he had seen a defeated man Jesus died like a loser Hallelujah he died on a cursed tree Hallelujah but when he descended hallelujah amen in to Hell the devil found out who he was hallelujah amen we understand Jesus just snatched those keys of death hell of the Grave out of his hand and kicked him back into his old prison house somebody helped me then he he raised from the dead he he passed through Paradise he opened the doors of Paradise he walked in and he Ed out paradise somebody help me here Moses was in there Jacob was in there Sarah was in there rebec was in there everybody that died believing the word but had not received the promise when Jesus walk when Jesus rose they

wound is hallelujah stop it where the WB is hallelujah he's afraid of you don't be afraid of him Hallelujah hallelu listen coming from that day on Calvary par 59 there was many many sign posts that point to that that pointed to that day many great foreshadows it had been foreshadowed by the Lamb by the Bullock by the to and all these things but yet it could not speak break it it could not break that death hole where Satan had the earth oh when I saw this I I got really excited he said the very rocks that he was walked up and down talk on the earth burning Brimstone Lucifer was the son of the morning and he walked on the earth when he was burning volcanic that same rock that had cooled off when Jesus died Calvary B it forth out of the earth see the price that was paid and the bondage of Satan was Broken Hallelujah God put back into the hands of man a way back to what he was looking for I don't know about you but I'm looking for Perfection now I have the way back to Perfection Hallelujah is that all right oh glory to God he had to weep no more hit when he broke the back of Satan there at Calvary the backbone of sin of sickness it brings every Mortal being on the earth back into the presence of God with sin forgiven hallelujah our sins are forgiven no more can Satan block us off from God hallelujah he cannot block you he cannot stop you Hallelujah and it's all because of what Jesus did Cal Hallelujah my blood sacrifice your blood sacrifice have set us totally free he whom the son is set free is free indeed but you got to remember you got to remember your position because if Satan can beat you down Hallelujah if he can crush your thoughts and make you feel like you've not changed Hallelujah maybe I haven't changed as much one thing I know I've changed y'all

at us at time Hallelujah making us feel defeated but you can never be defeated Hallelujah you cannot be defeated why because your life is hid in Christ as long as your life is hi in Christ you are a Victor Hallelujah you might make a mistake you might die a drunk but if you got the Holy Ghost Hallelujah you're going to raise up with a saint y'all hear what I'm saying God will never forget you

and earth is named after him and what that what that name is Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah oh my there was something else I wanted to read here before let me just jump down to the eth ver verse then we are free from sin therefore no sin shall hanging on us at all huh what no no sin shackles hanging on us at all God just like we had never Sinn the perfect sacrifice made us perfect for Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father's in heaven is perfect then there's no more to be done but we are made perfect in the presence of God y yall understand me so we we work so hard trying to be perfect when we already are in the eyes of God he said there's nothing else to be done but the devil makes us feel like we're losers you can never be a loser in Jesus Christ never hallelujah hallelujah I know this might sound but look at look at look at the rich man look at Lazarus Lazarus was poor trying to get fed be be fed by the crumbs of that fell from the rich man table he looked he looked like a loser but look at the rich man he didn't want to give up everything but when death came he lost everything Hallelujah but when the when Lazarus died he didn't have a Pity to his name Hallelujah but he became the rich man you better hear what I'm saying God took him to Heaven he was in the bosom of Abraham while the rich man was in hell don't you worry you might have to suffer and you might have to go through some things but God got your number excuse me your name your address and like them old folks say and he knows where you live Hallelujah glory to God listen you got to recognize I am in Christ amen look here he says the 82nd verse on closing now there's where we lose our position if we don't watch we try to look back to what we were and as long long as we look back to what we was the sacrifice means nothing to us oh can't you see a church he said I would know I would not try the job I can't neither can you there's no need of trying you're lost to begin with as long as you look to what you've done but don't look to what you to don't look what excuse me as long as you look to what you've done but don't look to what you've done look what the day of Calvary did to you it paid your price it settled the question your sin be a Scarlet they as white as snow red like Crimson white like wool then you have no sin you are perfectly sinless no matter what you've done
