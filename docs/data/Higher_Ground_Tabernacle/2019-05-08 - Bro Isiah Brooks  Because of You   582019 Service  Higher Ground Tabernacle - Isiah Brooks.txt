I'm sure he's a minister as well trusting that God blessed so now we're gonna have a special service on this coming Wednesday yeah double healer and so brother Isaac will be coming up from Iowa City he spoke to me about it sometime a little while ago and he just want to get it out and uh I'm happy about that and by the grace of God brother so let's come with prayer in our minds and consecration support these brothers by the basic God I'm happy because I know that we're revival stops and I so appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ for them but have my brother Matt again even he's all the way from Dallas gregarious Church down there amen he's gone through several times so we appreciate him coming to being with us today now prolong the time let's say in the blood of Christ I love this song [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] he came back I started my message planned out and I did something I don't know but Jesus is the first chapter we're going to read the 26th and the 27th first Genesis 26 I'm sorry Genesis 1:26 Jews is one trustus is such a Bible thing for us today we find ourselves battling and garden things but we Genesis 1:26 to the 27th verse and image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so God created man in his own image and in his image of God's maybe male and female created he them and God bless and God said to them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth one more scripture we go to revelation 7:3 revelation 7 we read the first verse 1 through 4 and these things are holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree and I saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the Living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to her the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the surgery the number of bill which were sealed and there were sealed 144,000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel let us pray father God we come before you Lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for keeping us and guiding us and strengthening us we thank you for this wonderful day that you have given to us father if there be anything we have said and done the Lord is not even in that side forgive us Lord cleanse us from all unrighteousness and father will be coming to give you the praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray you may be seated I like to entitle this message because of you coming from the message amen adoption for the velum sinners God before the foundation of the world as we took him down through the lessons young people how we seen God was self existent how that India was loved and him was to be God there he was by himself nothing if God is not saying to preach the gospel I have an inheritance and inheritance of eternal life that God's it to make Jesus give me God sent Jesus to make that inheritance real to me because there was nothing I could do God just all the time Jesus the Lamb to be well what inheritance the sonship to be a son of God no I'm just saying this now because you remember I just ministered on because he is the creator [Music] and now this may just choke you to death but did you know that me then are sons of God are amateur gods and how many ever know that how many know Jesus saying the Bible said Jesus said did not your law say itself that you are God's you called them God's because they were [Music] he he he we are when the up to the top [Music] of God that is true that was the son of God then he made man that little God he said if they call those the Word of God came to the prophets if they called them gods who the Word of God came to and God said to himself that they were gods he told Moses I'll make you a god and make Aaron [Music] [Music] he he he said he said you can have is because okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] Jesus was a man and he agreed to God he agreed to be sacrificed because we're living in the worst of all but by my spirit saith the Lord is that right is that right Roma zation who what who shall separate me from the love of God who that can separate you from the love of God why because God shield you as a prophet of God said before the foundation of the world he called you he liked you he sealed you hallelujah and he wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life be encouraged tonight everything you going through will work for your good that rie the Bible says so but the donors he doesn't want us to really think about God and what he's done for us why because he realized if we really consider and meditate with God like God has done for us he's a he's a he's a sick folk a dead dead dead devil that's right he has no power over us none whatsoever and why is because God held up before wins for you brother Bela means besides the servants but I want to say let's look me in between before the servants come there's a mighty drama that's going on now the Jews know nothing about it hallelujah but there's a choosing of a bride hallelujah you said what do you mean brothers let's go on you know what what what God's ways of past finding out is that right if I said who's gonna give him counsel his easiest his ways is way before far above whatever we can think of look what God did he gives a boy by the name of Joseph dreams hallelujah and Joseph is a prophet and he gets to dream these dreams and he begins to tell his brothers about these dreams why God what the soin type what the future hold what the future would hold for the true believer is that right oh yes he goes on and he's working with Israel now and he shows and then the Joseph who represented Jesus Christ is that right he was a Charlaine type of Jesus Christ and we find out that God comes alone through Joseph and Joseph is mistreated hello you say what do you mean that spirit came in our day brother also had the spirit of Joseph the ministry that Joseph Amon was able to go into Pharaoh's Kingdom and become the second man in other words he came into a place it meant that he stored the food for time of famine did not the prophet of God preached messages so that they would be restored in book form on take fall hallelujah because he knew that was coming a famine in the night and even Pharaohs people went down to detention to the granary to use some of the the food that jaws of Cristal story that's what the preachers are doing the day they are taking some of the food that Joseph's stories start up preaching it when not telling anybody where they're getting it from hallelujah come on somebody but look like God knew that Joseph was going to go through these things because he understood that Jesus Christ had to go through the same thing jaws were jet rejected of his brothers Jesus rejected of his brothers Pharisees Sadducees whatever they didn't like him is that right amen and Joseph was thrown into the ditch Jesus was thrown into the grave hallelujah but he was resurrected is that right and when he was resurrected where did he was resurrected to he was resurrected aiming to the right hand of father and with jaws it was resurrected where was he resurrected on the right hand of Pharaoh so you and I must understand this was done and look God allowed his brethren to mistreat him and to betray him hallelujah is that right and when Joseph was ready to present himself Oh somebody help me the Bible said it again - he wanted to present himself to his brethren he dismissed his wife which is the Gentile bride which means she was raptured before Joseph identify himself to the Jews somebody help me now watch this you're not we know these things but Charles who says to his brothers because they were afraid once they did see him they were afraid that Joseph was going to kill him and so when Jesus revealed himself through Moses and Elijah the Jews will think that God has come to kill them and they said well where did we get though where did you get those scars did you say to Jesus where did you get those scars he said in the house of my friends it would be then the Jews are recognized then they crucified the Messiah now what all of this was done for what to preserve chosen said listen don't be mad with yourself God did this he worked a wonder on the devil he was the one - oh the devil somebody help me here and he dug jaws up he took Benjamin and put them right in on the devil's territory hallelujah and time went on and through that line guess what God brings the deliverer Moses raised up in Pharaoh's house Pharaoh's daughter fed him taught him all these things hallelujah you understand me all these things were done that the Jews would be alive today you see Jesus does things in such a way that it we can't comprehend it you know I think sometime he does it in the way he does it because sometimes we don't have control of our lips we talk too much so it keeps us in a wonder you give the plan away hallelujah so he keeps us in that thing says trust me I'm the leader here you the Lambs you just trust me I'm doing everything everything that I'm doing right now is for you whew hard times I'm gonna trust you that's what Paul said he said I've learned it meant to be obeys I've learned a mentor to keep myself to keep my job to be happy in every situation he didn't say it automatically came he said I have learned and every trial and test we go through is a learning experience and that experience is to bring us to a greater trust in God all for you is that all right now you you let's turn the Romans quickly I quote it a little bit but let's turn turn there you love the Lord my voice had not even been horse all day somebody gonna be a blessed somebody's being blessed he's gonna come and take my voice and everything but it's alright because I realize one thing no weapon formed against us can prosper none I don't care what it looks like it might look Oh sometimes the devil comes and his financial problems seem to be overwhelming don't let it all the way of you stand still trust God and here divided up for you he will he'll open that she and you say oh my god I'm in the promised land now you understand me it's not that God is not Brian he like he's blind he doesn't know your financial needs God knows them and he's easier if he supplied the needs for the his disciples go find the fish catch one and the first fish you catch your taxes and everything isn't gonna be in there enough for me y'all understand me that's the God we serve but he puts us in tests see to see if we really trust him and depend on him absolutely some of these things are uncomfortable to the flesh but you know what when you die and you die to yourself and live unto Him you can always say like Paul I glory in everything Paul said I don't care what come my way I'm going I'm glory I might look a little crazy but I'm gonna grow if I got what I'm gonna glow if I God rollers ain't pleased you love the Lord you know God is God is so good to us let's start by God's grace at the they started to do that alright so you call I want you to understand ain't no demon I don't care what you've done when you are under the blood you you're free you absolutely you know people are afraid of that because the devil always showing us our flesh you know showing us our failures but you know you make mistakes sometimes we do but God says gonna lay in the charge today y'all understand me either you're free I don't care oh I remember you don't it doesn't make any difference to me whether you remember my failures are not in the eyes of God I could never be a failure you hear what I'm saying in the eyes of God you can never be a failure because the Bible said who God justified he also glorified hello he didn't even say sanctified he said glorified he justified you did he glorifies you cuz he know you will be sanctified and filled that goes to be in on the Alpha and the Omega so you and I must understand by God's grace and then what God has done what for you you know Satan so mad at you Satan is really upset he made one mistake and he got kicked out of heaven the hummers mistakes you've made huh and God said but see this is my son this is my daughter who's going to lead the charge to them because Satan if it wasn't for you they would have never made us mistake is that right brother BAM said all our sins go back to the accuser Oh somebody help me here Oh everything I ever done the devil is in trouble understand me I'm not in trouble here who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifies who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who's given you is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us now watch this now jesus prayed in the seventeenth chapter of Saint John he's his father I would they be one even as we are one now understand Jesus prayers can never go back come back void it's a certainty whatever he has he said father I know that you always here with me did he say that at the tomb of Lazarus as lord I know you hears me now I'm praying not for me but for their sake hallelujah so even now he's praying for our saying that we would know he's already praying for us and so therefore we've already overcome by his plan I didn't say your prayers by his prayer because you're not I read that quote last week whenever you pray in the name of Jesus Christ it is no longer your prayer it is transferred over to Jesus and it's like Jesus praying for you and he answers his own prayer God answers his own prayer but he prays to you when you say in the name of Jesus is no longer your prayer is his prayer and God answers those prayers somebody help me here remember that now when you sign it in the name of that right that's the check that he gave you so therefore when you sign it it has to be cashed because it has the right name on it and that's Jesus Christ all you got to do is wait our biggest problem is just waiting trusting is that right you get in trouble not you know you get in trouble by not trusting like so when Sam you said I'll be back you wait till I get back so right and the pews come on come on we need to do the sacrifice we need to do the sacrifice Sam he coming back he ain't coming y'all know him second and they you know people will get you into a bad situation if you listen to people that put an anxiety on you is that right oh it's the truth these people call you oh this kind of money and if you don't pay I'm like forget it my god it controls you my god controls you that's right am I in the right line when here at told Jesus don't you know I can take your love easy you can't take my life you don't even have any power and the power that you give I have is what my God has given you no police and nobody else got power God has the power and if God willing to see me go through something he gave you that so I can go through something otherwise you just you're just wasting your time now is that right it's the truth you know that just like I gave that testimony of our sister when the doctor says uh you know you notice this cancer whatever she has say you don't have long to live and you're gonna die and she said did Jesus tell you that oh really what doctor can tell you when you go die he's looking at science and we're looking at faith we've got a promise if we accept his diagnosis you gonna die but if you accept what Jesus says hallelujah you go on with your life is that right Oh somebody help me here mr. truth he goes and who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or Nick nurse of pearls or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay and all things we are more than conquerors through him that thus for I am persuaded that neither death now you come on now I'm persuaded that means there's no space no room for doubt I'm feeling up with persuasion well somebody helped me here cuz you and I must understand Pauline this is north he's literally telling you something these words they're not just for him it's for you and me that's Christ preaching or speaking to the Prophet right Paul yeah it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long as we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all of these things we are more than what conquerors through him that loved us women conquerors to you know through him you gotta believe God your father if you believe God is your father you can get some things done but if there's just an inkling of a doubt it won't work faith is pure faith cannot be happy without it is so pure it becomes so real to you you can't even explain it it's true just a little bit of doubt message the whole program up is that right listen here Jesus trying to teach his disciples that they came from him cuz he had already told him I knew you and you were with me before the foundation of the world but now we're in this dimension I'm gonna teach you how to be gods whatsoever you say and believing it is yours if you say to this mountain is yours you saw how I cursed that tree is yours by the spoken word hallelujah you saw how I created the bread I did that for you so that you can see by faith you can do the same thing why because I called you brethren and when I call you brethren that means you are made of the same material we came from the same parent hallelujah and you can do the same thing is that right he said these signs shall follow them that believe in my name that cast out Devils that's right there trailed upon serpents if they should dare drink any deadly thing he said it shall not harm them is that the way Paul knows about it when that serpent bit Paul Paul remember the word that he had yeah he shook the shepherd in the fire and guess what all those who saw says we have a God you understand me that's the kind of life we are to live everybody looking at William Branham William Branham came to us and Jesus Christ through him showed us what kind of people we ought to be it wasn't just for the one man he was the beginning of this somebody help me here and we are here and listen let me tell you something until we come to a place where we can love him like the Prophet loved him he surrendered everything and you'll never see God in the way that you want to see God until you surrender everything an empty shell you must surrender to God you must love him that that is that that is a propelling force or you know that that's the force that drives you to surrender is your love for him hmm somebody help me here y'all understand me brother Ben didn't come here to establish another Church God didn't send him to here for that it was to produce a bride one day when Adam woke up and saw Eve she was born of his bone and flesh of his flesh before she fell she was just like him and you and I must be just like Christ this ain't no religion y'all understand me it's this is life or death life or death and that's why the Prophet God even preached the mark of the beast that's why I got the scripture revelation 7 he preaches the mark of the beast you go to either get the mark of the beast or you go to get the mark of Christ which is your sealing of the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost he says hmm is this ok so you and I must understand preachers are preaching everything but that I remember I told you and Peter last week Paul says keep this in remembrance don't you forget this right he says add to your faith virtue of knowledge temple ease they go all the way up he said if you want perfection this is it because this is the divine nature of God is that right and the Prophet God says listen every virtue is a victory you just God don't just pull you through I'll pull you up I'll pull you out you've got to press into the kingdom it is a press it is a dying out and that's why we don't see the power of God because people don't want to die out we stop we stop somewhere some of us don't have the tempers that we should have some of us don't have the godliness that we should have but you've got God that little sheet has been quickened but you got to mature and nobody's highly preaching it anymore why because we can believe that God can open the blinded eyes we can believe that God can raise the day we can believe that God can heal the crippled but we're having problems believing that God can change your character we've been so long the way we are we find it so difficult to really believe that God can change me hallelujah if he can change your woman that was a prostitute on the other side of the blood changed her hallelujah and over the branagh yes he did that but look at the people he changed he said what I don't know who Stephen was before he got saved but I know one thing when he died he died with a testimony then he had the Christ on the inside so much so his face was transformed and illuminated like an angel that's the only ghost I'm talking about there ain't no religion and the devil you know that's what is it his business his he wants us to be so busy and we all are anybody in here is not busy we're busy with something right but you see the thing the devil doesn't understand is that the word is going out and it can't come back boy hallelujah you see he gets us thinking Oh Lord oh Lord now you understand what I'm saying about virtue see because you can't establish that the only thing you can do is ask for it and he said you have not because you ask not if you don't pray and ask for these things on a daily basis you see them saying you got the call we've come before God says Lord I want to be a door out adorned because the garment in which we are to be adorned is this which is the divine nature of God hallelujah religion is everywhere that's why preachers fighting one another they need it it's the truth you know you find brothers breaking churches up is that right do say they had the appearance of a brother they look like a brother because they were not a real brother we'll never break up a church Lucifer was the first breaker upper you understand me so you and I must realize amen that when it comes him into the guard take to the Lord Jesus Christ we are all about unity o Peter denied him she said leave him he couldn't let you just take her you know he denied me three times hidden Oh Peter Peter denied leave him tell me what he said he said no Oh Peters a part of this body when I broke the bread I gave him a piece to show him where I came from where he was and where he came from I'm the bread of life I gave him a piece of me yah ha ha ha hallelujah so you can understand why would he said no we need Peter Oh Thomas how can you doubt me he didn't say that did he no he said Thomas here you want the evidence I'm gonna give you I'm gonna give you that's what he said Thomas said I need some evidence now if you are believer and you're like Thomas say God I want some evidence God will give you evidence is that right remember the lady amen brother Brown said she had the Holy Ghost but she couldn't believe it because she did not hadn't had never spoken in tongues and the probably God says Lord bless her that she could speak in tongues he didn't criticize her let us see if that's gonna seal it for her give it to her sometimes people need evidence and God didn't say Thomas you're not a part of me all these said was blessed is the man who believed who and have not seen say Thomas you believe because you saw right listen what I'm trying to say it's all done all the Scriptures laid out there for you and me so we can look in this and hey somebody was like me I'm having the same struggle here Lord of you did it with them you can do it for me it's in there huh so you what you saying brother which I'm saying the love of God he is so powerful you saw I know what I'm talking about because I see God changing me from glory to glory I see it and the thing about it is when you crowd the God lonely not God will answer I'm a clothes a little bit lemony he said I'm saying but it's ok the book is inside so you and I must understand listen pulses nothing nothing nothing should separate did I tell you about that that testimony I had it got quickly to me one time years ago I was coming to church and this person was driving me driving me right there all 486 that exit coming up on 86 from 80 or 35 where that is you know about by the coffee shop and anyhow if the lady that the man was driving him like no no no I'm gonna speed through that light and just the shoes I stopped cuz I was thinking I was having a battle am I gonna let him push me out the way what I'm gonna do and just as sure as I stopped a car went he would have told me up and no doubt I would have been dead you know what the man in the back of me did he ain't stop to say I'm sorry he just threw up his hands you hear what I'm saying who did that God stopped me from going forward you understand me y'all got to understand everything every little thing that happens to you it's ordained by God but somebody mistreat you don't get mad at them God told him to do it that's what David did so don't get mad with him God told him do that is that right he's all what do you mean brother you know sometimes we feel like we're overwhelmed with the days of the day but I understand every little thing that comes your way has already been placed put in place for you and guess what you are to conquer it you must conquer it that's why he's testing you so you can conquer it right you're gonna either concrete with patience or knowledge or temperance or godliness you gonna conquer whatever it is that virtue of God is there to be seen Oh somebody help me here I'm almost done but my point is when I think that God held up everything now you think about I love this little portion of the scripture where God made Israel wander in the wilderness for 40 years that gets me because had they come like brother Brown said they could have crossed over in seven days Rahab would have been a child hello you know she was no old woman out there and she got married to a well a captain so she must have been a beautiful lady you understand me so God did all of that he held it up you understand me there you go brother this rapture could have taken place in the time of William Branham they were ready those people was riding there with Elijah they believe they followed him it could have happened but there in the book in heaven there were names that had not yet come to manifestation yet and God has held this thing up for you and me all for you and me you understand me so we should be diligent as much as possible to make house come up how can I say diligent to his word as much as possible so that God can bring us to perfection not only that but we must ask God give us a spirit of I could say like Ezekiel a burden for the souls of people because he said he's this angel will only seal those who saw and cry because of the abomination that is done in the city you understand me what city come on Jerusalem he was talking about Jerusalem in other words bring it back your plain language the abomination is done in this message among your people the world is dead they already counted out right remember I told you as long as the church was in order the death angels wouldn't come in Ezekiel says Lord but where do you start he's a star at the house start at the church start with the elders and go all the way down don't even spare the children but as lower they wear the salt of the earth is stayed God's wrath hmm and that's everywhere if you want to see Des Moines continue to prosper as long as we keep ourselves as the salt of the earth God would bless them in order to bless us but when we go bad everything go bad y'all understand that's how God is always work he told Israel you were the salt of the earth you were the preserver the bride is the preserver therefore when God takes us out there is nothing to preserve us we have a role we're doing things amen in the spiritual realm we are not even aware of we are staying the wrath of God somebody help me that's why it's important that we stay right before God if we lose our Savior that's what the Bible said Whitworth it'll be trampled on do you love the Lord people this is beautiful I didn't even touch what but nevertheless God said he what he wanted to say and I'm gonna tell you something by the grace of God when you think about everything you know you think about this iPad a lot of people don't like it but this was made for me I don't have the memory like a lot of people have hello and you know what you know I remember the time I had to write everything out what happens when it gets wet from my sweat yeah tell me there were some setbacks there too but at least I know when this goes all I got to just plug it back in and to come back up to his original self my point is the Bible said in the voice in the days of the voice the tape recorder was made so that voice could be recorded think about it all of that all of these inventions were done for you and me can you imagine how long it would take for us to you know how brother and I drove from one part yeah you know they were built out of different material then we can't do that right think about it how far it would take if we didn't have an airplane we would have to take a boat or something to cross over seas but the gospel had to travel so God allowed and anointed people to invent things that will make things go faster and quicker for the Gospels sake so you must understand that everything that you see around Amen that you know you if it used wisely you can prosper by it because all these things were done for you think about it y'all remember I remember I do I complain about the cellphone but you know what I remember what what the cell phone look like it looked like a phone booth on your back yeah everybody thought they was cool brother there big ol box like that oh lord help us Jesus and so now God don't put it in such a little small thing right but think about all of the research and everything if you use it wisely how it accomplished and how you how it perfect and bring things into clearer focus you and I study the message right on this thing here now we get a thought we could just boom we're not to read every message you know when I find good quotes they all good but I found a good one I play the whole thing I play the whole thing so it encouraged me now I'm saying all of this so that you and I may know that God has it all under control you got a bit you got to trust him that way because that's how Israel got in trouble you brought us out here I can't get over it they talking to God Moses you brothers are you in a parish it would have been better if we had been over there eating garlic's and leeks and stuff and none of that stuff sounds exciting to me you know but they said we could have remained there and they're so blind to the fact that God is leading them they're so blind here and God hear all of that nonsense that back that back talking to him and the same time he's blessing him their shoes are not wearing out their clothes are not wearing out he's feeding them with manna for 40 years he drop him he dropping quail don't even have to go hunting nothing and he's giving them all of that and it was never enough and that was the problem with Lucifer all that he had was not enough don't ever that's what about the contentment godliness with contentment is great gain you must be content with just being godly right so what if you your clothes are angry but I got God you understand me oh you see that's where Israel messed up that's where the devil unknowns you when you can't find contentment and where God has placed you be contented glorify God in every situation because there's always somebody worse thank you let's pray father God we come
