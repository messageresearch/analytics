TRANSCRIPT
========================================
second Timothy 3:1 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come Matthew 24:12 and because there excuse me and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wa pray father God we thank you for your gra thank you for your love thank you for being us You' been better to us Lord than we've been to ourselves father we just pray that you have your perfect will tonight Lord give us Grace Lord to instruct your people in the way that you would have them be instructed Lord as we submit ourselves to your SE Amen on last week uh Sunday we uh ministered on the thought the Lord is God and we we we showed by the grace of God that our shelter is in he is our shelter in time of need and I think our main uh thought uh or or theme if I was to say it like that would be breaking from under the pressure I showed you by the grace of God how that everything that is born has to come through pressure Born Under Pressure that right and uh we're going to show you by the grace of God that God always do things so unusual we're just going to take our time uh tonight because I really want you to get the thought on what we're saying um you know uh a brother called me the other day and he was giving me a thought real good thought and I thought oh that sound good but I'm not going to preach it but I will give you a taste of it just how often we say I don't care I don't care and you know I never saw how bad that statement or that uh uh is but you see he he took it from Genesis and he showed how and where that came from here was amen two brothers in the same church one brother killed the other one and then when Jesus or when God came to the brother said where is your brother he said I don't know and I don't care that was the spirit of uh my My Brother's Keeper and it begins to tell a story how that there was a a little mouse uh that was in this particular Farmhouse and uh this uh uh owner and his wife uh kept seeing the mouse uh uh and the mouse became a nuisance so the owner aen uh went out and bought a a mouse trrap and uh you know the mouse got a little excited ran out to the chicken and said chicken chicken help me help me the the M uh the Master of the House has bought a a a mouse trap she can said I know I'm part of the church here but I'm on the outside here you know that's not my problem what do I care and so he ran from the uh chickeny went over to the pig and said Pig I need you to help me here because the owner now has brought a mouth we got to do something about it and and the peach said you know I mean why do I care it ain't none of my problem amen I'm liking this and then so he he goes on and and he runs to the cow says God C come on you got to help me here because I know what this mean if we don't do something about this mouth trap I'll probably be the one that ends up in this predic can you help me because it move I'm out here in the field that is not concerning me why should I care well the saddest thing about the whole story is that one night the mouse trap was WR and and the wife of this man goes on and he he comes and and she comes and she not seeing it was in the dark but what had happened was a taale of a serpent sprung the Trap so when the woman went down to see the mouse in the Trap the serpent raised up and bitter well the farmer came by and he found out his wife was in critical condition and at that time when they found out other people the word went out so people came by and and and they said oh he said my himself you know with all these people I was expecting him to come I I might as well go prepare a chicken so he goes out and prepares the chicken and me for those that did come by and don't doubt amen the others the cow and the and the pig perhaps were still going about their business what do I care not knowing that the wife was going to die now the wife dies amen so now a bigger crowd comes by and the man think what I'm going to do with all these people let me go and prepare me a pig so he goes and he kills the pig right amen and so it it looked like it was all all said and done amen they have the funeral and now more people comes in the B say you know what I've got got to go Fe and prepare me a cow so he cooks the he kills a cow excuse me he kills the cow and then the the the thought behind it was this none of them would have lost their lives if they had only gone to help the mouse but often times people don't care and they fail to see whatever affects the body in a small way will eventually affect the body as a whole hello somebody that is why so many churches are there the spirit of God is grieved away because people saying in their spirit is not with their mouth what do I can't you see that the Antichrist Spirit behind it the same spirit that we say that that that we allow ourselves listen all of us should care yes not one of us amen should get to a place where you would let your brother or your sister just literally die without doing something about it even if it's just praying hear what I'm saying because that time people are in places you can't do nothing about it but one thing for certain the Church of the Living God can always pray amen yes you should always care your heart should always go out for individual come on somebody amen because the truth of the matter is you never know when you're going to be in that position right we'll let each other go through things in and out of things without even thinking about prayer comes up nobody thinks about calling it stops right here hello y'all hear what I'm saying you know and I'm sorry I meant to bring a prayer request for sister Andie at home not feeling well she text me and said pray for her I told her I bring before the church she's got to go to CH uh work tomorrow to open up she's the only one that's available so pray I pray you pray with me that God deliver her from that Spirit that's trying to affect her now let us move on by the grace of God I just wanted to give you some thoughts none of us should not care for each other amen Yes Y'all hear what I'm saying trth amen all always praying even if you can't contact get in contact with each other you should always try to remember each other in prayer it doesn't matter whether a person is walking right with God or not walking with right with God we're still Brothers yes we're still sisters come on somebody now let me move on by the grace of God I thought i' thw that with in because that was so good to me I had been you know a lot of times you don't say well I don't care what it is to me amen but I I know many many of us have used that term or that statement before but I want you to really think about it the next time you say that you know what I'm saying somebody I'm going to do what I want why should I care what they think about me I've been guilty but you should care cuz the Bible said a good name is better than gold hello y'all a got quiet on now but we are born under pressure there's no other way God can get to your go yes out of you and I but we must remember he is God Amen and I showed you by the grace of God in then in the scripture where it says that many love shall wax cold because iniquity shall abound iniquity is when they continually see people doing wrong and their love began to go cold yes but that individual and for others you why can they get away with it Hallelujah come on somebody but the point is amen it's not about that I said it like this a lot of times things offends us or things get to us and we don't make it right and all that is is the breath of the devil I said that last week it's the breath of Satan you don't have to confess it right now you don't have to you know let them know how you feel y'all hear I'm saying you don't have to forgive come on and the whole time he's cooling you off because that's what it said it means to cool as to breathe or to blow cool by blowing the breath of Satan is cooling you off and you wonder where your experiences has gone is because you have allow things to enter into your spirit Lord amen without making it right yes hello somebody now let me move on by the grace of God because Amen brother B goes on and talks about how Moses was born under pressure and under persecution just as they were killing all the babies in the time of Moses Jesus when he came they were killing all the babies to get them get him is that right now think about it the Royal seed was all has always been born under pressure amen hello so that means amen you and I we see a Jesus Christ really manifest itself through us when the pressure really comes now we're feeling some birth pain but it says amen when the devil went out to kill him kill Moses was killing children you see and what we fail to see is that the sque me tell us a lot of things but no doubt there'll be a lot of foolish in bad shap and bad trouble at the same time the Bride of Jesus Christ amen is standing strong amen yes Amen in Lamentations 55 says our Nets are under persecution we labor and have no rest what was it the reason why they were in Babylon the reason why Jeremiah could WR these things is because they were there because of their Disobedience yes amen y'all hear what I'm saying yes amen and listen people of God Amen if there's no rest in you every day is just confusion every day is just trials every day you almost out of your mind and then you need to go to the Rock yes there is a resting the Bible says to S me in the glass of the Rock Amen to the to the wrath of God is pass there is a place of Refuge 27 says hide me in that secret place underneath the stairs hide me in your provision for you excuse me is that right now listen there's something about the ride there's something about a true Christian because he realize he must go under the pressure he must go through trials he must suffer amen oh come on if you don't know that you going to be you suffer you you confused amen because first of all Jesus Christ said in order to to be his disciples you must first pick up your cross and follow me this is not a walk of ease and as Christians you and I must fight every day anybody in here to skip days to fight it's every day all day thank you Lord amen God might give you a little breather in there somewhere but for the most part you are fighting the enemy is that right the said Watch and Pray right you watch and pray God tells us he said there was a time when he first started going out hunting he went with this well-known Indian chief he was the tour the the guy and and brother Brandon was just always in a rush he said he was in a rush in a rush and a rush and the Indians said to him why are you such in a rush those animals was born there they'll be there when you get there is that right he said be wise take your time he said one step look nine times take another step look nine times Hallelujah come on somebody am because once you get up there you won't be all turned outen and he said by his way of rushing he scared all he will scar all the game away but in our patience possess ye our wow that's right walk one step look nine times right you see the dev real that right wow amen so I want you to understand will people this is the most glorious time ever in in in in the history of man like I said we ought to be the most happiest people in the world Amen but we allow Satan to low on our candle brother B said it like this he said if God likes a candle no man can put it hallelujah amen that's why Romans 8:35 said who shall separate us from the love of Christ tribulation of persecution of famine or nakedness of pearl of sword and is it written for thy sake we are killed all the day long am we are counted as sheep for the slaughter name in all these things we are more than a coner through him that loved us am right not not by him but through him Hallelujah it is he that is doing the work God bringing us from glory to glory from Victory to Victory Hallelujah to prove to us that he is God yes Hallelujah that's what I want to see all of that amen amen amen that's right second Corinthians 4 he says now thanks be to God be unto God who which always C I love this scripture always causes us to Triumph yes right and I gave that I'm trying to hurry now I gave that illustration amen last week how that coach gets down amen and that man he almost don't have no more strength in himself and that coach get down his in his ear say but you can make it you can make it I know can I I confidence in the move move and somewhere somehow that individual musters up something and it keeps moving why because God knows what's in you amen the only way he can get it out of you is to bring the fire yesall it's got to be tough it's not going to be easy amen thank you Lord am and so we look at this thing and I thought oh my this is what Psalm says Psalm 47 And1 oh clap you your hands all the people sh to God with the voice of Triumph yes see that's what God he in the serice yes not not oh Lord if you don't do something I'm going to perish you know I hear so many gospel songs I'm H and fail and oh my I'm just really making almost threw my hand up no sir you almost throwing my hand up you see what I'm saying that ain't the gospel Jesus preing it's trial yes it's the gospel amen that gives you Victory amen every song have Victory amen yes son she's a Victorious bride amen she's shouting the sound of Triumph even when the devil got it come on you know you know a lot of time the devil might trip you or you might fall and you might falter but that ain't the end of it the end already made it hallelujah amen y'all hear what I'm saying now we look at this thing because I want you to understand man the worst thing said Easy Living is our our greatest enemy we find out that is true you know what I'm talking about you got it so good if you're not careful amen you you your prayer becomes a ritual prayer should never be a ritual right it should be a real anointing always something amen that's real fresh to you come up like you've been to the rivers of Life Hallelujah come on but when prayer has got to the place that you can only do three to four minutes amen it's a ritual it'sing God's that's right amen he said if there's anything that makes Christian lazy is when they're on a FL bed of East it's a sometimes God can't get us to until we have a hard time that's right but the whole point is he's trying to prove to you and remember a lot of time that's our own choosing but when we can come to a place am that we can walk with God and go through it listen I'll be honest with you you think about Dani he was so in the presence of the Lord he said let them say what they got to say but ain't nobody stopping me from praying he said prove that I am who I am I know who I am I'm going to roll my windows up bring the curtain I want to see me pray am to my God a man Hallelujah in like that you know what I think about I often think about this where was everybody else when Daniel was going through his persecution where was the three Hebrew boys Hallelujah come on somebody you got to realize out of the whole of Israel God work out only for men that wouldn't bow everybody else was over that what about us are we bowing under the pressure are we going to let the world know who Jesus is wow amen hallelujah all you God the voice of Triumph Hallelujah God God is that right is that all right oh my God he said God will put you under pressure just to get you riled up just to stir you up so that you can see what the real man is come on you need to see what the real is and if the real man standing on God's side here's the altar amen amen come on somebody oh it's the truth it's the truth he said you put them under pressure once and God will put all his children under test to see whether there there's any flaws in them you think God trying to kill you the whole time he's searching you out make sure there are no flaws come on it's the way you look at it it's all right to have the flaws because we got the FL the man who can fix the flaw amen but you want to make sure all the flaws are fixed amen yes before God calls for his church is that all right amen think about it now we done lived in this body here so many years way before we got saved and don't even think about all of the generational stuff that was piled and packed into you and then then you had your own private Branch growing out of that tree as well amen and think about it amen that here it is the Holy Ghost in you listen your flesh ain't saved Redemption of your flesh comes at the Rapture yes hallelujah hallelujah come on somebody so now You' got a saved man on the inside a unsaved man on the outside always Waring against the man on the inside yes and God is saying to you but you're greater than the man on the outside Hallelujah he said I am the god of all s do it amen bring it under your control so God comes along and he TR he tries you to see how well you governing your flesh that's good brother amen hello this way governing your garden yes Hallelujah cuz whatever sees are planed in this is going to show up somewhere down the road yes hello but if ain't never a genuine Holy Ghost SE in here H that got to lay dead on the ground amen is that all right hallelujah oh yes amen and we have seen the St that yes God always do those things that are unusual he said listen how what God did here it is he said and listen he said these things are pre-arranged your life every event in your life has been prearranged my life your life your life my life re ar oh God so hard why through this you going through it I don't have to hallelujah amen right am come on somebody you going through not one thing that we've gone through God didn't see before it happened he knew your failures he knew your strength he knows your weaknesses he prearranged somebody got to look bad yes huh listen none of us would live above the life that Jesus Christ Liv yall hear what I'm saying he was the perfect man come on somebody oh my but he did something let me ask you a question if you ever thought about amen what they did there amen uh Mary now Mary any woman you had a baby I'm sure you know what I'm talking about it is not a good thing how many miles they had to travel was it 60 70 whatever it was it was a good bit on a donkey due date now y'all hear what I'm saying a do and she's Wi on a donkey all the heels through the FY rolls whatever they had to go through they been collecting the dust from the camels and the hes and whatever more anim that they were traveling slowly but God though she be the incubator of the word God didn't spare her see say God didn't spare Mar he's not going to spare you you may be the carrier of the world or you may be the but God could even spare his own unusual if God would choose such a young lady and put her through all of that trouble amen yes he what I'm saying these troubles that we go through is not always ordained by the devil a lot of trouble we go through God put them there but guess what he knows at the end of the road you and I come out like he trying to say don't quit what Mar say hold up J I can't make it to uh Bethlehem let's just pull up on the side here and we going to have this baby she would have been out of the word hallelujah and God wasn't going to let iten see I'm saying there such that God will not allow to happen in your life the journey that Jesus ordain you to take you will complete it amen oh come on somebody it is what it is he will make sure you complete it amen oh I hope somebody get see what I'm talking about but listen listen what he said am man amen we have seen the St he said listen he said man he can't EMB better himself you can't do it I'm so sad or sorry to disappoint you you cannot EMB better yourself if he gets any better treatment it's got to come from some other source he doesn't build himself a better house he doesn't make himself fry his meat where he used to eat it raw see it was to be done because there's nothing to him to give him a soul an animal doesn't have a soul but a man has a soul and therefore that soul is a part of God and even in his Fallen state yet is the most greatest species of all the species on the earth is the man and then get him in connection with his master Hallelujah he becomes a Superman almost because he is a Son of God Amen he becomes acquainted with his master with the creator of all things and then when the man there acquainted with his master become a part of his maker becomes back into the fellowship with his maker every here it is every Divine word becomes a living reality to him and he believes it no wonder people can't believe in Divine Healing today they haven't got nothing to believe with now let me move on here because I wanted to show you something I heard on the news because let me tell you something you and I we know that this Prophet is right right amen the only reason why we know because we seen Jesus Christ manifested through his life is that all right amen uh that brings me back to just the other other week or whatever I said he was a covenant brother was Angel actually Jesus Christ really is the Covenant Angel right not a man the god behind the man amen amen so I appreciate that you know but but I want you to realize amen that you can never be a Son of God without God in you amen that's right right but the glory don't go to you me the glory goes to God praise is to amen so I realize amen that I heard something on the news and this man see because I'm working I'm getting ready to come into this part of my Ministry this part of this service tonight about a Superman cuz you know we almost become we almost a Superman this is a super AG so God had to bring a super people right but the only way you become a super people you must have a super God on the inside but you know brother you know this message is so perfect he told us amen over 50 years ago amen that the church the modern day church will be worshiping God under the uh umbrella of Rocking R now you go to these churches and then they got the smoke coming down they got the rock bands a lot of the singers look like rock stars come on somebody hey then the women are stripped naked he told us all these things over 50 something years ago now how could he do that except God told him to same amen that was prophecy they can't have the pill CL so they make their own right that's what they do and so you and I must realize now we see this thing in in BL view he told us 50 something years ago I have a l was America would turn away from the Jews and lean toward the Arabs isn't happening he said that was what that would be the greatest of all curses when we turn our back on Israel have we done it oh yeah it's coming to it's coming and then you can see the whole world shaking because of it you know one of the things that we let slip and I was looking at something the other day when those uh that that that meteor and that whatever it was es whatever that was that struck over there in Russia one on this side and other on listen we let that thing listen that was judgment yeah amen God was stking the Earth with a stone search the scripture when anything was Stone it was a sign of being cursed and the Bible said the stars are fall from come on and every sing listen things have been picking up amen amen to diss are everywhere in your face amen amen thank you Lord just on the on the on the on on on the computer I was just looking at something honey come up in here go I was looking at some disas things that TR inform you about

that be like in Egypt the same things are happening just like it is and was in EG we're here people this is the thing you might not be able to see I'm you can see this afterwards you know what that little picture is right there it is the pope and a man did a miral and he's got it the super po never in history have you ever seen or heard of a super po you know why they had to do it brother said they're going to get this super and he's got himself listen I got to hear that he got himself fixed with his fist and then fing through the a amen he's got a red and blue castle look like coming out of a bag and that bag means uhen that it's supposed to mean U let me see what I wrote down here so I get right values a hole in the bag with a red and blue sock coming out I said that's more to it he's dressed in white and and and the sock whatever that is coming out of the bag is blue and red red white and blue H maybe I bre to it but let me put it this way amen he knows he's got us in the bag and all he's doing is showing the world a sticking a little blue out and R out like I got it now oh come on somebody am a super po thank you Lord a giant mural of Pope Paul Francis painted like a version of Superman he's going to fix it and so you looking for that intellectual di you going to get it and the Bible said he will win the world with what flatter yes as a p on the wall in Rome near the Vatican shows the PO holding a briefcase em emone with the word thees which means that vales what values what values brother what they looking for a Superman somebody that beinged that let them hold the name Christianity and still live any kind of way they want to he said that's what they looking for he said that's what they going to get Hallelujah come on somebody when the real Superman here hallelujah but had this uh uh United States am been accepted the message would have been a millennium right now say we wouldn't have need amen no no no walls of Defense he said the Holy Ghost would have been our is that right he said God would have told a prophet everything that the enemy was doing like he did Elijah Hallelujah come on somebody and here we are today Amen in a age where everything is super I don't know why I hear these things I'm ready up amen I'm listen to things not crazy stuff but you know anyway this one lady was giv out was being given out on award like a gry award amen for a child's book that made a squirrel think about it next thing you know they have a b or be being super remember what the brother said as long as he can make things super he can make Jesus come as long as he can super for everything else he'll make Jesus common what's so super about Mary when we have Super Woman y'all hear what I'm saying and when you and I look at these things everything is becoming so remember now in the Book of Esther it was the age of man just like it is now God is being taken out of everything it was man's Prosperity it was man's achievement what all man did but in the midst of that chaos there was a lter there was a star that God was getting ready to up thank you Lord now look at this he said that's what it is he they they love those kind of prophets amen and preachers that can just do things randomly he said but isn't that funny that's not the way uh the the Old Testament uh prophets did or even the saints of God he said Jesus even said I can't do nothing except my father show me amen he said well what is it that these preachers can just do things so randomly not even hearing from God but do it in the name of the Lord wow and people accept it wow yeah y hear what I'm saying yes but we're living in the age of super is that right now listen what he goes on the say he said it's not me that doth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me he doth The Works is that correct he did what did he do and he use the word possess he said with the power he said or endure he said I'm not saying how ex I didn't mean to say possessed but he was endured with the power from God that he saw visions and he told his disciples and all of them who question him now listen he said the father worketh and the son work TR now if that was the order of Jesus don't you know that must be our order to amen we must wait on God in order to do anything amen and when God gives us to say so and he de with us individually in a different way and every true son and daughter God knows what he's talking Hallelujah and when he talks you moov amen if he don't talk you don't move amen is that all right amen he said no Prophet at any time ever did do anything without first God telling him to do it amen oh help us Lord is this okay amen because I I want you to realize amen that we are we we so busy the only way I I I said like this just like I said last week when you and I want something from McDonald's Burger King whatever restaurant you go to guess what you go to that restaurant to get what you need right you know unless they got you know Home Service they going to come like a pieza place but for the norm we go to that place now when you want something from God why you come to me an example right I'm just using me for an example now we are to pray for one another but when you really need something from God you go to the man that gives it amen you got to talk to the Lord Jesus he's the one that gives it amen amen Oh My My My see if the Living God can get a hold of us you know what what we'll be we'll be invincible amen oh it's true he said that's what does with every born again Christian a Superman a superwoman a super child turns his back on sin and the things of the world and walk with peace with God Amen a Superman that's what make you super when you can turn your back to sin that's what makes you super when you can turn your back to the world yes it ain't all these miracles signs and wonders which is wonderful to have but there's a group of people out there who can do miracles signs and wonders and still ain't living it but you super in this age when you can live what I'm that's what makes you super everything is super now is that right cars are super roads are super amen it's true amen there's a time you know

and everybody thinks it's okay that's s we're insane I'm I'm saying we I'm in America I'm not included that we but y understand what I'm saying people are insane recogniz or it's true was tell me had 60° weather out there where he was I said was something running out in he yeah he man yeah I mean I I'm thinking you I love to run but there ain't no way it's 0 deges and I'm going to dress up and run

you even though I didn't see it it was 30 somebody was out there running I didn't have to see him running in shorts I saw him walking oh my God help us Lord come on it's a spirit it's a spirit but my point is I'm trying to get out of your head and your mind that it's going to be easy how many yall think it's easy oh my God and you know what the more you know about God you know the more difficult things that you didn't know with trouble God now you know now you watching every movie amen you something mind that's you don't try to SW a be you SW a be he come back you SW be the best thing is don't try to swat it you ignore the devil you resist the devil cuz if you SW him he coming back that's how the devil is because you don't SW a be unless you're afraid of it so when you swall at the Devil you know what you're telling him you afraid of him so he's coming back resist the devil and he fle from you oh come on somebody come on it's the truth oh my you know I was walking in for today me just Friday my wife Coming getting off from work and this man saw me coming and just left he just come the Christian bookstore you know I'm thinking oh my my mind my that devil was on my mind he was he said you ought to say you just come out of the Christian bookstore and you shut that door in my face twice come on somebody it is a constant battle in this mind and you got to submit to the mind of God otherwise you bring fruits of the enemies taking you bringing for fruits of righteous who told that man to do that door like that God did the devil knew that would get next to me cuz I'm always holding the door for people you know when I open the go of people and they don't say thank you the devil want me to say something every time but I don't Lord help me Jesus come on somebody now I know thing so Brothers why are you saying this let us turn amen 2 Thessalonians 2:1 you know why we looking at this thing the way we're looking at it because if you don't hold fast this message guess what's going to happen to you God is going to give you a strong delusion and you cannot move into a strong delusion until you reject the truth second Thessalonians 2:1 and that's what's wrong

was a prophet to the false word the super B did I just show you the pope was the prophet to the false word and that made him a false prophet the third third stage is a Beast a man that's crowned in the last days with every Power that Pagan Rome ever had because the seven headed beast dragon was cast out of heaven and come incarnated in the false prophet now that's why of signs Andy wonders is you can do this you got to have come on somebody that's what TR toost when together to speak in tongues so we must be one they get the same Holy Ghost oh my God there's no way you can have the true Holy Ghost and call it on Mary the Holy Ghost won't let you do it the Holy Ghost will never let you worship no other man outside of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost come on somebody is the truth why amen here he is he had seven clowns and he had cast out and thr into the Earth and the Sea all right what was we saying who is the rider this horse rider you know what he is it's Satan's super man you can't tell me God ain't on time God ain't on time he's on time amen what meant to me it would it almost be uh what's that word um oh I can't think of the word but almost blaspheming the pop to do this to him and he's so holy it's like calling Jesus Christ JC don't you know people do that call him JC remember brother said he said in the 60s they used to call him daddy outus disrespect that you would call the Lord Jesus JC oh come on somebody y I don't know what's wrong with you T night but I'm happy that's all I can tell you I got some Joy on the inside I've had a battle all day amen you know what I don't I don't I don't go at the end of the day as a loser no sir when I close my eyes I'm Victorious cuz I'm I'm making sure that what I close my eyes I'm up Amen Hallelujah Lord have mercy Mercy Mercy s Superman is who he is now you got say what what what what he said could you imagine a man filled with the Holy Ghost under such an illusion as that and claim to be when this Bible that says who the Antichrist is and you hear all the PO is okay oh he's good oh he's all right oh oh I just love him oh my goodness think about millions millions of people even among denominational people who really believe that the pope is all right now I don't mean no har but if he is in his heart a she he going to come up off that throne and believe this message amen he going to have to hum himself to real Jesus come on I know y'all think oh he's soly we all clo ain't doing nothing but making it worse I do you realize not that nothing it's a Hallelujah now I'm telling you what it is and yet these people say oh my God help us listen all is and why are you saying these things because you don't realize the Catholicism is growing stronger why protestan ism is getting weaker and you better believe by the grace of God that this America is in this condition because of her robing Us blind and we don't even see it she was smart she educated our people and put them in time positions and they took this country like a servant oh come on somebody now I'm not talking about those if they're true Christian in their hearts they going to have to come out of that Hallelujah come on somebody and I'm saying if you are a true Christian you got to tell somebody and you got to go forward listen those those people in the old test the new test they over tell nothing going to hurt my feelings no if you care you will why I Jesus God so he gave his own and and he walked in every opposition then walk everybody was opposing him Herod and all these people that were there but he still stay true to the father's will even when he was put under question th the king are you king th sa and for this purpose I came into the world Hallelujah are you the BL for this purpose we came into the that men who are in darkness might see the you got to tell them let them C you out somebody need put a fish in your face but that's okay okay you got to realize if they can do that and not fall dead God allow it it's true it's true it's true it's true I'm almost done people I know a long time I'm almost done your Trials come to mold you that's why the Lord said the love thinking not strange concerning five trials which is to try you as though some strange thing happening to you like I said you were the one first Peter 4:12 you are the ones that accepted God God's invitation didn't you he said come in this last Ag and be like gold tried in the fire you said yes Lord I'm coming but you see you took the invitation amen you said yes Lord I come God said but don't you know it's like go try and fight in other words he say it's not going to be easy on it's going to be hard on you come on somebody oh it's it's hard enough to talk about Jesus Christ but to tell them that God s a message to tell them that God in a prophet in such the age as this and they don't want to believe in prophets but they believe in the PO nobody says anything about the F even I got some some Protestant friends don't even want to believe what the f is now I'm thinking why would God let this man be called out of all the popes of History a pope could have been called in in brother Brown day super Pope why this is this the one y hear what I'm saying is this man the one because listen he is the most popular Pope ever and that's what they saying there's never been a PO that's been so popular ever where the Catholic and Protestants love this man is this the man and if it is when to see we know who he is where he's coming from everybody say he's coming from AF he's coming from this country and I read something in there where they said what I don't believe is the pop even I don't think he speak King I don't think the anti com don't what you think the Bible says it what you think and my part is if this man is we know mean he's not Crown fully with all the power yet but watch this because when that anointing comes to take his bride a never one rain amen ain't nothing but one rain when that ano come to take this B it will be at that time hello yes when God takes us up the power of the Beast comes in on that he's already the Antichrist but he sweet talking he's Antichrist but when he becomes the Beast he's a beast killing and everything else he was old going to happen oh folks let us wake up and smell the coffee amen the holy C would had been that long ago amen what they did over there ID had been that long ago the wall between Theus and the ho ain't been long ago yall know what I'm talking about murder mass murder what China has done has been long ago and people right now this generation we're

be no dying no cursing and saring I don't know this I never heard it will not you do that you'll be left behind right am y'all hear what I'm saying thinking not strange fiery Tri what kind of fiery Tri he said the fire that's drawn from a refiner is fire Calamity is a trial that test the character I'm going tell them a piece in my mind I heard that so many times I said whenever somebody tell you that that's all they got is a piece they don't have a hold I'm going tell you a piece of my that's all you got because if you had the mind of God you have a whole mind I'm almost this my last F

I still got fight would it be wonderful if after you pray he just leave you Al you know I saw something on the T not I have computer and I was looking at this thing and you know what it said all kind of radiation comes from the Sun and would normally destroy everything on the Earth has if it had not a force field around it has a protection and I forgot what this radiation these things that literally amen stops it from penetrating completely but it says when a rocket goes up or anything man made goes up what it does it breaks it brings a breach and that's why amen all of these radiation things didn't find a way through to the Earth and it says then the next system which is the storm system literally finds those radi rad uh those things coming out of space into Earth fights them off kills them and brings it down to the he says that's why you see light see because that that energy comes down it strikes the Earth but what you don't see is the energy that goes up y'all hear what I'm saying so we got the same kind of system if we didn't have the Holy Ghost if we didn't have a force field around us if we didn't have a fire because it look just like fire if we didn't have a fire about us every demon would be hitting us and robbing us every day why you think you don't have all these sicknesses that the world get thank you Lord there's something protecting you from it amen oh it's true anyhow amen when you look and see how blessed you are sir you got to fight y'all hear what I'm saying you said well how can I fight first of all amen this is this is what we must do never

break every little thing you ever did during the day whether you thought it or whether you did it and at that time he says Lord was yes Amen on Hallelujah before they can cross over amen into the promis land why would they have to be Sanctified when they get ready to go to war it going get dirty anyhow God said we just going over like you are no because in order for God to defend you and fight with you and for you you got to be clean yes he's a holy God yes it's only when we let trash and dirt in our lives we he can't fight with us and fight for us I'm making yes he Sanctified he sanctify the children San the all them and we going to cross over this Jordan when they crossed over Jordan they were F they whoop the enemy until it can got a little trash in his life then everybody start D you heard me say this and I'm close you heard me say this so many times me you every one of us amen have a responsibility of keeping our spirit and our flesh yes so that God can work wonders in his yes all of us when we fall short want not allow the church the whole church to be somebody sh Hall I think I effective I don't know whether you're dreaming Day Dreaming or just staring I don't know which one that is but nevertheless they all all yall look but we love you we love you anyhow by the grace of God y'all love the Lord hallelujah Amen Let Tri amen yes I know some of us tired we

a phone or or something I'm talking to myself I'm not talking you don't want to do that you know I got to be a better hello you know and what the devil does he keep us so busy with ourselves we forget everybody else yes that is what he does he's doing a great job with it but we got to stop him in his track know we got to stop that amen for making him think he's getting the best of us we're his God Amen he's not ours we're his God when you your me to oby that's Serv are so he's supposed to be our Serv we're not supposed to be here you love the Lord father good to us you been better to us to ourselves yes the battles are raising but just like Paul said who shall separate me from the love of God not not tribulation Lord nothing nothing nothing in this Earth above this Earth underneath this Earth can separate us from the love of God those of us who are in Christ Jesus father we thank you right now for this night to know in our soul in our heart that you are God and every way every way we have gone no matter how many times we come short no times Lord Lord you orain those thank you Father God in your name Jesus we worship you praise we give you glory in Jesus Christ name I want to say something to you that might sound a little strange but y'all we read about David all the time and we see the life of David was David life perfect was Abraham's life perfect you see I'm saying they made plenty of mistakes but it was all ordained of God now do you think God by mistake knew that Solomon was going to come from B Shea and he knew did you think God oh my I got to do something different regenerate something here now I'm not saying God made them do it but God knew what they were going to do by for knowledge and he could have easily stop David said David I'm making you King but up the road there going to be a Woman by the name of BBA don't go that way he could have done it but in seeing that God still had a purpose for that she Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying I mean you look at Solomon and there was no greater King than Solomon even God he calls himself the son of David which was Solomon is that right and Solomon messed up so bad and not only that he ended up going into idolatry and everything some you know Solomon Solomon just lost where could never be lost no more than you could be lost amen if you were in the mind of God sa amen God uses his uses you for his own purpose that's why so many people will be in heaven who you thought wouldn't makeen cuz you didn't know amen that God purpose for that to be you said can't be brother let me tell you something one of the things that really caught my mind was Lazarus the poor man Lazarus the poor man he looked like he was deserted by God begging at the rich man table come on how many y'all would St say serve God and you had to stand on the corner with a cup but this man amen looked like he would have been out of the whe of God and the rich man probably looked like he was in the will of God but here was this poor man I see that's one of my favorite I can't hardly wait to get there and ask him all about his troubles how did you go through all of that and still love God the way you did I want to know y'all hear what I'm saying I want to know L I want to know that you love him so much never complain not one time did you complain not one time there's a place there where Lazarus complain to God see so a lot of us we we fail to see you know we go through these strange ordal and these strange ways of of God doing things in our lives we think we all out of the will of God tell me when and my point is this the Bible said God all things work together for the good of them that love God and those who are called his purp God will make it work for you amen yes you do it every time amen that's why you got to stand fast you got a push I'm telling you maybe I'm the only one but it's a pushing amen like I said that baby is right there the head is at the crown you got to push you said Oh Oh Brother Bruce you know I'm climbing up the L I've got a little virtue I've got a little you know listen but I'm going tell you something Divine love you going to push for that yes in this age you going to push you got to come up them laders the lad this this jacob you come all the way up your brotherly kindness you probably got but when it come to Divine you and I going have to push for that yes that's worth fighting for Hallelujah fighting so I to I say like this amen yes heart oh know out of that help us right now bring them out of that system give them Grace to see that you their lord and we ask these things to be [Music] [Music] likees all [Music] [Music] glor to be like Jes [Music] Earth [Applause] [Music] all glor only [Music]
