[44:47] Genesis Man chapter
[44:51] 27 we'll read the verse 18 to verse 19
[45:05] Genesis 27:
[45:16] 18 the Bible says and he came to his
[45:20] father and
[45:21] said my father and he said here I who
[45:26] are thou my
[45:28] son and Jacob said unto his father I am

[45:46] my ven that my uh that thy soul may

[46:12] 27 amen it's still talking about
[46:16] Jacob amen the Bible says in verse 27
[46:21] of and he said unto him what is that
[46:24] name and he said
[46:34] Jacob let's bow
[46:36] ahead father God thank you for your

[47:26] we thank you for
[47:28] everything in Jesus Christ name we
[47:32] pray amen this morning we have a little
[47:34] subject that we wanted to
[47:38] share amen that we entitled the
[47:40] importance of an
[47:45] identity amen the importance of an
[47:47] identity in
[47:49] prayer don't amen we we we read uh
[47:53] Genesis 27 verse
[47:57] Verse 18 to verse
[48:01] 19 amen here's you see the a story of
[48:05] Jacob amen the bible say that and he
[48:07] came unto his father and said my
[48:11] father and the father said who are thou
[48:15] my
[48:15] son amen here's Jacob they ask him a
[48:18] question to
[48:22] introduce amen by in verse 19 instead of
[48:25] saying that I am
[48:28] Jacob it says that I am is th
[48:33] first amen because the
[48:36] identity amen I looked on Google what's
[48:39] the true meaning of an
[48:43] identity amen Google says that identity
[48:45] refers to our sense of who we are as as
[48:54] individual
[48:57] as members of a social of of of social
[49:02] groups it also refers to our sense of
[49:06] how Others May perceive or label
[49:10] [Music]
[49:12] us amen so our names are idty our names
[49:16] is a part of our
[49:18] identity amen the way we smell is a part
[49:21] of our
[49:23] identity am the way we talk is a part of
[49:26] our
[49:28] identity amen The Way We Walk is a part
[49:31] of our
[49:32] identity amen the way we behave
[49:34] ourselves is a part of our
[49:37] identity amen identity is who you
[49:40] are amen so it is very important for us
[49:43] to know who we are when we go to
[49:47] God Amen it is very important to us to
[49:50] know who we are when we asking God for
[49:54] something
[49:56] amen so here in Genesis chapter
[49:59] 27 amen Jacob amen Isaac promise is a
[50:06] blessing amen because it was a custom in
[50:09] the Old Testament the first born was
[50:10] supposed to receive a blessing from his
[50:16] father amen so in order in order for
[50:19] them to have that in order for is Isaac
[50:22] was
[50:23] blind Amen in order for the son son to
[50:25] receive a
[50:27] blessing amen that son had to identify
[50:31] himself Amen to help his father
[50:33] recognize who he
[50:35] is amen so blind
[50:38] people amen when they're blind God
[50:41] increas some some some some senses of
[50:43] their
[50:47] lives amen some will know when they
[50:50] touch God will increase their
[50:54] touch amen some God will increase their
[50:58] smell amen some some God will increase
[51:01] their sense of
[51:03] hearing amen because that will help them
[51:06] guide that will be their
[51:09] guide amen so here in the Bible amen we
[51:13] see that Isaac was trusting his hands
[51:15] and his
[51:18] nose amen and his ear to identify who
[51:21] was was in front of
[51:23] him amen so now here Jacob
[51:27] comes and Isaac ask him a
[51:30] question who are thou my
[51:33] son amen he said that I am Esau that
[51:37] first amen if we continue in verse 20 of
[51:39] the same
[51:41] chapter amen and the Bible says that and
[51:44] Isaac said unto his
[51:46] son how is it that thou has found it so
[51:52] quickly and he said because the Lord thy
[51:54] God brought brought it to
[51:59] me and Isaac said unto
[52:01] Jacob come near I pray
[52:06] thee that I may feel
[52:09] thee whether thou be very th thou be my
[52:13] very son Esau or
[52:16] not and Jacob went near unto
[52:20] Isaac and he felt him and he said the
[52:24] voice is Jacob
[52:27] but the hands are the hands
[52:29] of Amen Jacob tried to fool his
[52:34] [Music]
[52:37] father going to his father with the
[52:39] false
[52:42] identity amen his name was
[52:45] Jacob he talked like
[52:47] Jacob amen but he tried to fake his
[52:53] smell to fake his his
[52:57] smell amen and then the the how his body
[53:00] was
[53:03] feeling amen but he was
[53:07] Jacob my mom used to tell us stories
[53:09] when we were growing
[53:13] up amen cuz my grandfather was
[53:17] blind and the way he was recognizing his
[53:21] children it was by the
[53:24] smell and he had 10
[53:26] kids and he knew every the smell of
[53:29] every one of
[53:31] them amen even if they're outside of the
[53:34] room amen he would know exactly who was
[53:38] coming amen sometimes you know one of
[53:41] them will
[53:43] come and they'll say you'll say that oh
[53:45] this uh uh you know so and so is
[53:48] coming man his kids will be like but Dad
[53:51] you you're blind how can you even
[53:54] tell a few seconds after they see him
[53:58] walking there's a story that one that's
[54:00] one story that intrigued
[54:03] me my mom said that uh their you know
[54:07] her oldest brother I
[54:11] believe went to Europe for a long time
[54:14] for
[54:16] years and he came to he came back to
[54:20] con and no nobody knew that he came he
[54:22] wasn't like
[54:24] surprised
[54:25] so when he was when he was down in the
[54:27] street
[54:29] coming my grandfather looked at his his
[54:32] wife was next next to next to
[54:36] her and he said the name of that son his
[54:39] name is poor he's
[54:43] coming said but Dad he's in France right
[54:45] now so but how is he going to
[54:49] call he said you guys just wait he's
[54:51] coming he's about
[54:53] walk why because because he knew how he
[54:56] was
[54:58] smell amen he had an
[55:01] identity amen so when we come to God we
[55:03] have to have an
[55:05] identity am we have to know who we are
[55:09] amen so you see now here after verse
[55:13] 27 amen Jacob came to God with the false
[55:17] identity amen Isaac bless
[55:20] you amen but that did not stop troubles
[55:23] from coming to
[55:28] even though Jacob was blessed by his
[55:31] father but Jacob did not feel as if he
[55:34] was changed or something happened in his
[55:38] life amen that blessing did not really
[55:40] help
[55:41] him amen he was blessed because
[55:44] technically he became the first
[55:49] son amen but that blessing did not
[55:52] change his
[55:54] life because he came with a false
[55:57] identity so now let's go to uh Genesis
[56:00] chapter
[56:02] 32 verse 24-
[56:08] 28 amen the Bible says here and Jacob
[56:11] was left
[56:13] alone and there wrestle a man with him
[56:16] until the breaking of the
[56:19] day and when he saw that he prevailed
[56:22] not against him he touched the hollow of
[56:25] of his Ty and the hollow of Jacob's Ty
[56:28] was out joined as he wrestled with
[56:40] him and he said let me and he said let
[56:42] me go for the for the day breaket and he
[56:45] said I will not let thee go except thou
[56:53] bless
[56:55] amen amen so now notice to verse
[56:58] 27 amen and he said unto him that angel
[57:02] said unto
[57:04] him what is thy
[57:06] name and he said
[57:09] Jacob and he said thy name shall be
[57:12] called No More Jacob but
[57:17] Israel for as a prince has D power with
[57:20] God and with man and has
[57:23] prevailed
[57:26] amen look at here you'll see that the
[57:28] same questions were asked to
[57:32] Jacob who are you but different answers
[57:37] had different
[57:42] effect amen the first time when Isaac
[57:45] asked him who are
[57:49] you he said my name is
[57:52] Esau amen he was blessed but that did
[57:55] not change his
[57:57] life that blessing did not bring a
[57:59] change in his
[58:01] life as a matter of fact that brought
[58:03] more
[58:05] trouble amen Esau his brother wanted to
[58:08] kill
[58:09] him amen everywhere he was going he had
[58:12] troubles and
[58:14] trou amen but now he came when he when
[58:17] he was wrestling with the
[58:19] angel amen the angel ask him again who
[58:22] who are
[58:23] you amen he gave him another Second
[58:27] Chance am to claim his
[58:30] identity he says that my name is
[58:33] Jacob and after that Jacob's life was
[58:37] changed amen he was he became
[58:41] Israel amen the
[58:44] identity amen it's who you are amen it
[58:47] shows that you being honest when you're
[58:49] talking to
[58:51] God amen amen it's like the the uh the
[58:54] th on the
[58:56] cross amen one knew who he
[58:59] was amen he showed his identity to
[59:02] Christ it says Christ I am worthy of
[59:06] this
[59:08] death amen but you're not amen I am a
[59:12] sinner amen I know what I have done amen
[59:16] I know that my way wasn't the right
[59:19] way amen I know that I did some some
[59:22] Very Bad Things amen I know that I am
[59:26] supposed to be
[59:27] crucified amen he recognized his
[59:31] identity amen he was sincere with God
[59:34] and after that a promise was given
[59:37] to that you will be with
[59:40] me amen because he knew who he was amen
[59:44] he knew the importance of his ID amen so
[59:48] when we come to God Amen we don't have
[59:51] to fake who we
[59:53] are amen if you are a sinner you tell
[59:55] him that I'm a
[59:58] sinner amen if you don't have faith you
[1:00:00] tell him God I don't have
[1:00:03] fa man if you're struggling with
[1:00:05] something you tell him that God I'm
[1:00:06] struggling with
[1:00:08] something because you're going to a God
[1:00:10] who knows who you
[1:00:13] are amen you knowing to you're going to
[1:00:15] someone who knows who knows who you
[1:00:18] are amen he knows who you are better
[1:00:20] than
[1:00:22] yourself amen he even knows what your
[1:00:24] your deepest desires
[1:00:26] are the Bible says that he knows what we
[1:00:29] before we ask something to God God has
[1:00:31] already heard
[1:00:33] it amen so what's the purpose of hiding
[1:00:36] who we
[1:00:38] are amen what's the purpose of of hiding
[1:00:41] our
[1:00:42] identities amen we have to know who we
[1:00:44] are amen and tell it
[1:00:48] as amen the prophet says in the message
[1:00:53] identification amen paragraph
[1:00:57] 58 it says that you cannot no way ever
[1:01:00] produce a character like
[1:01:04] that only accepting that character in
[1:01:08] you a church cannot do
[1:01:11] that a Creed cannot do that a
[1:01:14] denomination cannot do that an education
[1:01:18] cannot do that amen it must be a
[1:01:22] birth amen it's got to be a dying
[1:01:26] out and let God
[1:01:29] in by the grace of
[1:01:31] Christ mold this type of character in
[1:01:35] you amen that you become
[1:01:38] him in your life and and your life and
[1:01:42] he in the same and his is the
[1:01:46] same and your life and his life is the
[1:01:50] same then you are sons and daughters
[1:01:55] amen that character comes from a
[1:01:57] birth amen a dying
[1:02:00] out amen you have to die and let him
[1:02:03] in amen it's what Jacob said amen I am
[1:02:08] Jacob I am a liar amen I'm not an honest
[1:02:13] person amen he said who he was amen he
[1:02:17] died to
[1:02:18] himself amen so that he can birth into a
[1:02:21] new
[1:02:22] person amen so that he can become
[1:02:26] Israel amen so we have to die in
[1:02:29] ourselves and let God
[1:02:32] in die in
[1:02:34] yourself amen the prophet again
[1:02:38] say it says that
[1:02:40] now the only thing that we have to
[1:02:44] do is to have faith in what we
[1:02:47] are in what you
[1:02:49] are have faith in what the word says you
[1:02:53] are
[1:02:56] and Jesus had faith in the word of
[1:02:59] God that said what he
[1:03:01] was it is written of me did David say in
[1:03:05] the Psalms and the
[1:03:08] prophets and all of them that speak of
[1:03:12] him I am the bread of life that came
[1:03:14] from God out of out
[1:03:17] the amen I am that tree of life from the
[1:03:21] Garden of
[1:03:23] Eden I'm all these
[1:03:26] things I am that I
[1:03:28] am and he knew with that perfect
[1:03:32] faith that he was the anointed
[1:03:36] Messiah that the spirit of God was upon
[1:03:39] him he said now in myself do
[1:03:43] nothing but it's my faith in God and God
[1:03:48] was in him the word was manifest was
[1:03:51] made manif and when the word of God
[1:03:55] comes in
[1:03:56] you it's made
[1:03:59] manifest for you are a
[1:04:02] Believer see an un
[1:04:05] believer is the Fai the faith of God
[1:04:08] that moves in
[1:04:10] you amen Jesus knew who walk amen I
[1:04:14] believe I preached on this
[1:04:17] earlier if not
[1:04:19] here amen who are you that was my
[1:04:22] child amen I this vers I read the
[1:04:27] scripture the prophet says
[1:04:29] that the thing that we have to
[1:04:32] do is to have faith in what you
[1:04:37] are amen have faith in what the word
[1:04:43] says have faith in what you
[1:04:46] are and have faith in what the word
[1:04:50] says you have to know what the word says
[1:04:53] you
[1:04:57] amen because sometimes you know the
[1:04:59] devil when things are not working
[1:05:02] right the devil will come to your mind
[1:05:05] and show you how a bad Christian you
[1:05:09] are the devil will come to your mind and
[1:05:12] show you how you did
[1:05:16] wrong amen he will tell you said that
[1:05:18] you should have waited on God but you
[1:05:19] did not
[1:05:22] wait amen he tell you that you should
[1:05:24] have done this and you didn't do
[1:05:27] it you should have respected the entire
[1:05:31] Ten Commandments
[1:05:35] but yesterday you li to your
[1:05:38] neighbor yesterday you were watching
[1:05:40] something that you
[1:05:43] not you went with the wrong
[1:05:47] crowd those are the tricks of the
[1:05:52] devil he will try to take take that
[1:05:54] confidence you have
[1:05:57] in try to take that faith that you have
[1:06:01] in but the prophet say that you have to
[1:06:04] know what the word
[1:06:08] says that's the way to to fight the
[1:06:12] devil it's not when he came to
[1:06:15] Jesus he came to Jesus with the
[1:06:18] word he came with him with a twisted
[1:06:22] word trying to showes Jus you know
[1:06:24] trying to said I will give you all
[1:06:29] those but remember Jesus did not just
[1:06:32] speak the word to speak any kind of
[1:06:36] word Jesus was speaking a word of what
[1:06:39] the Bible said he
[1:06:42] was amen he says that you will not tempt
[1:06:45] the Lord thy
[1:06:47] God Amen that was what the Bible said of
[1:06:51] him amen so that's why we need to have
[1:06:53] faith faith in what the Bible
[1:06:56] says amen we need to have faith in what
[1:06:59] the Bible says we
[1:07:02] are amen so now the question
[1:07:06] is what is the Bible say say about
[1:07:11] us amen what is the Bible saying about
[1:07:15] us let's turn in John 15
[1:07:20] ver the Bible says that if you abide in
[1:07:23] me and my words
[1:07:27] you you shall
[1:07:30] ask what you
[1:07:32] will and it shall be done unto
[1:07:38] you if you abide
[1:07:41] me and my word
[1:07:44] AB the prophet said in the message
[1:07:49] witness it say that if you know
[1:07:52] positionally who you was and what you
[1:07:55] are
[1:08:00] tonight who you was and what you
[1:08:04] are there wouldn't be a feble person in
[1:08:07] here in the next 5
[1:08:12] minutes that's right the thing of it
[1:08:17] is you're looking off into a millennium
[1:08:20] for something to
[1:08:22] happen
[1:08:25] when it's already
[1:08:27] here now we are sons of
[1:08:30] God now we will
[1:08:33] be but we are right
[1:08:36] now the prophet
[1:08:39] when and he said this night amen so if I
[1:08:43] ask the question
[1:08:45] when this
[1:08:48] morning we are Sons and Daughters
[1:08:50] of it's not something we have to wait
[1:08:53] until
[1:08:56] it's not something that we have to wait
[1:08:57] until the
[1:08:59] service amen but right now we are Sons
[1:09:02] and Daughters
[1:09:03] of Amen right now this
[1:09:06] minute we're seated together in
[1:09:13] Heavenly am if you only recognize
[1:09:17] that and the supreme authority that
[1:09:19] Jesus Christ
[1:09:22] has amen anything you have desire
[1:09:26] of am anything that you need

[1:17:22] up
[1:17:23] Abraham amen he was called a friend of
[1:17:27] God but still that wasn't exactly what
[1:17:30] God
[1:17:32] was amen then then amen then came Isaac
[1:17:36] and
[1:17:37] Jacob wasn't what God was
[1:17:41] looking then after that he came up
[1:17:43] Isaiah and all
[1:17:46] the David God even called him a man
[1:17:49] according
[1:17:51] to but still that wasn't what God was
[1:17:54] still looking
[1:17:55] for something was
[1:17:57] missing even though they were
[1:18:00] prophets even though they followed God
[1:18:02] in every all the
[1:18:04] words even though they gave God their
[1:18:07] hearts but still something
[1:18:10] will God wanted to create something in

[1:18:56] own amen we saw it with our
[1:18:59] own it was that
[1:19:03] Masterpiece Jesus

[1:19:18] satisfi have only
[1:19:21] one he wanted to do amen he wanted to
[1:19:25] create many

[1:20:34] God the word was
[1:20:39] manifest and dwelt Among Us that word
[1:20:42] was broken
[1:20:43] down into small pieces amen but that did
[1:20:47] not change the
[1:20:50] nature that was still the word
[1:20:53] in different
[1:20:55] quantities with the same quality am so
[1:20:59] that word now is living
[1:21:02] in then the verse continues and
[1:21:05] say then ask what
[1:21:08] you and it shall be
[1:21:11] done why because the

[1:21:35] supposed
[1:21:36] to but still God was not
[1:21:39] satis something was

[1:21:45] Christ it was God
[1:21:47] himself amen God looked at
[1:21:50] it he said I want more
[1:21:54] so the only way to have

[1:34:22] else paid the debt for
[1:34:25] you amen so you like a new
[1:34:28] person so who can lay any
[1:34:32] charge of God's
[1:34:35] elect it's God that
[1:34:38] justifies amen the Bible said that and
[1:34:41] he maketh
[1:34:43] intercession so in other words
[1:34:46] God Christ is our prayer
[1:34:50] Warrior
[1:34:55] is our prayer
[1:34:57] Warrior amen so he prays for us amen he
[1:35:03] intercedes amen there are some times
[1:35:06] amen you can't express
[1:35:10] watching sometimes in your life things
[1:35:12] happens that you don't
[1:35:15] know amen that you can't tell how and
[1:35:18] why things
[1:35:20] happen amen but know one
[1:35:24] thing you have a God who
[1:35:28] constantly prays for

[1:35:48] through amen he knows what your problem
[1:35:52] is he knows what your desire
[1:35:55] is amen because he knows your

[1:36:17] God Amen protect them amen protect them
[1:36:23] I know the world will be
[1:36:25] against amen but I pray that you keep
[1:36:29] them
[1:36:30] United amen then later on in that
[1:36:32] chapter I believe it's in
[1:36:34] John he said that I'm not only praying
[1:36:37] for them that are
[1:36:39] here amen but I'm praying for even for
[1:36:42] those
[1:36:43] who amen meaning that in that prayer of
[1:36:47] Jesus Amen you are
[1:36:49] included amen you are
[1:36:52] included amen he knew that times a rough
[1:36:55] time will
[1:36:56] come he knew that everything will not
[1:36:59] always be on your
[1:37:01] favor he knew that sometimes you will
[1:37:04] feel like you about to
[1:37:07] forsake he knew that sometimes in your
[1:37:10] life it'll feel like you at the
[1:37:14] End Amen everywhere you want to go
[1:37:17] there's a wall standing
[1:37:20] there every solution that you want to
[1:37:22] take there's something always not
[1:37:25] working he knew
[1:37:27] all and he prayed God to keep you so
[1:37:31] that you can have
[1:37:33] faith prayed God the father he said
[1:37:36] father I pray for those that you have
[1:37:40] given amen the same way you were in
[1:37:43] me I was one with you so I want to be
[1:37:47] one with them amen I want to dwell in
[1:37:50] them
[1:37:52] amen he prayed for you amen and he's
[1:37:55] keep on praying
[1:37:57] for amen Revelation chapter 1 verse
[1:38:03] 6en he says that and he has made us
[1:38:06] Kings and
[1:38:10] priest unto God and his father to him be
[1:38:14] glory and
[1:38:16] Dominion amen he has made us
[1:38:20] Kings
[1:38:23] amen the highest those are the highest
[1:38:26] order in the
[1:38:29] kingdom and in a
[1:38:31] church amen a king has a supreme
[1:38:35] authority so above above a king there is
[1:38:38] no one
[1:38:39] else amen his word is like the
[1:38:44] Lord amen and a
[1:38:46] priest amen he's the one that
[1:38:50] goes amen with this with the
[1:38:53] prayers amen of the entire city of the
[1:38:57] entire the entire of the people of
[1:39:00] church he goes he goes with us prayer
[1:39:06] to amen and the bible say that he has
[1:39:08] made
[1:39:10] you Kings and
[1:39:13] Prien notice the Bible did not say that
[1:39:15] he will
[1:39:18] make amen but he said
[1:39:22] so right now amen you are King amen so
[1:39:26] right now you are priest amen he has
[1:39:30] made you Kings and
[1:39:32] PR of your domain amen so you have the
[1:39:36] authority Amen to cast The Devil out
[1:39:40] amen because it is your
[1:39:42] domain because it is your
[1:39:45] kingdom amen and the Devil he's supposed
[1:39:47] to obey you amen he's supposed to
[1:39:50] respect
[1:39:52] am because you are a king am when a king
[1:39:56] speaks amen that's it that's it that's
[1:40:00] amen and a kingdom am it's not a
[1:40:04] democracy amen there's dictatorship in
[1:40:06] the
[1:40:11] Kingdom the kingdom wants what he
[1:40:14] wants amen whatever the king
[1:40:17] wants amen that's what is going to have
[1:40:20] amen if you have a baby and the King
[1:40:23] said that this will be my
[1:40:25] child there is nothing that you will
[1:40:27] have to do you will have to obey because
[1:40:30] the king
[1:40:31] say and he called you a king so whatever
[1:40:35] you
[1:40:36] say has to happen amen so whatever you
[1:40:40] say amen God will back it
[1:40:43] up because you are a king amen what you
[1:40:48] want is what you will do that's why when
[1:40:51] he gave his
[1:40:53] promise he did not say ask whatever God
[1:40:58] said he did not say that ask whatever
[1:41:01] God want you to
[1:41:03] ask no but he said ask whatever you
[1:41:06] will ask whatever you want amen because
[1:41:10] you are a king amen and you and you are
[1:41:13] as you are a
[1:41:15] king your desire is to be granted to
[1:41:19] you ask whatever you

[1:41:25] of
[1:41:27] things ask whatever you
[1:41:29] want and it shall be given to you amen
[1:41:34] going to the end the prophet
[1:41:36] says
[1:41:38] see people try to
[1:41:41] think well I'm a
[1:41:44] Christian I guess I have to be dugged
[1:41:49] around
[1:41:54] no you
[1:41:57] don't you are
[1:42:00] Christian that's you're Son of
[1:42:03] God our Father is
[1:42:08] King and our father being
[1:42:13] King and we are his
[1:42:15] sons we are prince and
[1:42:19] princess amen a king see the highest
[1:42:23] there
[1:42:25] is highest can
[1:42:28] be the very Spirit of our
[1:42:32] God is in us that's it amen he say that
[1:42:37] the highest there
[1:42:39] is the very spirit of God of
[1:42:43] our is in
[1:42:45] us if that same
[1:42:48] spirit that Quicken chist from the
[1:42:53] dead and that same Spirit dwells in
[1:42:57] you amen he will change your mortal
[1:43:01] body amen it will Quicken that mortal
[1:43:05] body amen he will give you the new
[1:43:08] life amen it will bring you back to
[1:43:11] life amen if that same
[1:43:16] spirit that same spirit that was
[1:43:19] Jesus amen that was Jesus that was with
[1:43:23] Jesus amen when Jesus died on the
[1:43:27] cross amen the Bible says that water and
[1:43:29] blood came
[1:43:31] out Amen to make to wash you and to make
[1:43:34] you
[1:43:36] clean amen then after that there was a
[1:43:39] division amen God divided Jesus in
[1:43:43] two amen he took the
[1:43:46] body and he gave his send the spirit on
[1:43:49] Earth
[1:43:51] amen amen
[1:43:53] because amen when the resurrection will
[1:43:56] happen amen it's the spirit that has to
[1:44:00] go into a
[1:44:02] body amen and the resurrection will
[1:44:04] happen in
[1:44:06] Christ amen it's the one who will be
[1:44:10] resurrected so that's the reason why you
[1:44:12] have the holy
[1:44:14] spirit amen because as the resurrection
[1:44:16] will be in
[1:44:18] Christ meaning that that spirit that is
[1:44:20] in
[1:44:21] you amen that's the thing that will
[1:44:23] bring you
[1:44:25] up go that
[1:44:28] body to give you that perfect
[1:44:31] body amen if that spirit that was in
[1:44:34] Christ that raised him up from the dead
[1:44:38] it's only God's spirit it's only
[1:44:39] Christ's
[1:44:41] spirit that is's able to raise you up
[1:44:43] from the
[1:44:45] dead amen if that Spirit dwells in
[1:44:48] you it will Quicken your morning
[1:44:52] it will bring a
[1:44:53] change am like
[1:44:56] Jacob amen he said to his father I'm
[1:45:00] es amen but when death was was
[1:45:03] coming amen his brother was coming to
[1:45:06] kill
[1:45:08] himen Jacob said
[1:45:11] himself this is not a time to be
[1:45:14] joking amen this is a time where I have
[1:45:16] to be honest with
[1:45:18] myself amen I told my father that I was
[1:45:23] es nothing
[1:45:25] worked amen nothing worked but now I
[1:45:29] have a second
[1:45:30] chance amen that same question is been
[1:45:34] asked so now I have to
[1:45:37] tell amen I have to tell him
[1:45:40] exactly amen I have to be
[1:45:42] honest amen because honesty is something
[1:45:45] that God
[1:45:48] Valu amen God values the sinc your
[1:45:52] heart amen that's why he told Brother
[1:45:55] Bren he said that if you are
[1:45:58] sincere amen nothing will stand
[1:46:01] against amen he told him that if you are
[1:46:04] sincere amen if you are
[1:46:07] honest amen nothing will stand against
[1:46:09] you amen when he told that line amen he
[1:46:13] tried to go pray for him for that
[1:46:16] King amen he knew that at that time he
[1:46:19] wasn't who he was supposed to
[1:46:22] amen so if you pray for that that kid
[1:46:24] would would
[1:46:26] die amen he had to go fix it
[1:46:29] first amen he had to go repent
[1:46:33] first amen being honest to
[1:46:36] go amen changing
[1:46:39] Mask doesn't change who you
[1:46:42] are amen changing
[1:46:44] mask amen doesn't change who you
[1:46:48] are God throughout the time
[1:46:53] amen he changed his
[1:46:55] mask amen from
[1:46:57] Jehovah amen to all the seven compound
[1:47:00] name of
[1:47:02] je amen but even though his name was
[1:47:05] being
[1:47:06] changed his nature never
[1:47:09] changed he was still the same
[1:47:12] God that's why the brother bam said that
[1:47:15] that a Jehovah from the Old
[1:47:18] Testament is a Jesus of the newest
[1:47:21] even though he was changing
[1:47:23] mask his name his nature still the
[1:47:27] same still the same so even though Jacob
[1:47:32] changed his
[1:47:33] name he changed his
[1:47:36] clothes his nature is still the
[1:47:38] same Amen in closing I just want to you
[1:47:42] show explain show up
[1:47:46] something
[1:47:49] please so this is exactly what Jacob
[1:47:56] did
[1:47:59] hopefully so he
[1:48:01] took the he took the clothes of his
[1:48:05] [Music]
[1:48:06] brother he
[1:48:09] came if people who know you know they
[1:48:12] care too much about the
[1:48:17] smell they care too much about the smell
[1:48:19] the people who care too
[1:48:22] much and they remember people
[1:48:25] smell amen they will know how is
[1:48:30] smells because I've been using that same
[1:48:32] col for years
[1:48:34] now so I have a certain type of
[1:48:37] smell so wearing my brother's
[1:48:42] suit even though I smell like him right
[1:48:46] now you're smelling good by the way even
[1:48:49] though I smell like him right
[1:48:51] now amen I have I wear the suit this
[1:48:54] amen it doesn't change who I
[1:48:58] am amen I am still
[1:49:01] Isaac amen I have a new
[1:49:04] clothes if you saw me coming
[1:49:07] chch amen I had a burgund
[1:49:10] suit amen but now I'm wearing a blue
[1:49:13] suit amen but still that doesn't change
[1:49:16] who I am
[1:49:18] inside amen I am still the same
[1:49:22] Isaac so if I go to
[1:49:24] God I'm not going to say that Lord I am
[1:49:28] John even if I'm wearing John's
[1:49:31] clothes I'm not going to say that Lord
[1:49:33] this is
[1:49:35] John because I smell like John because
[1:49:38] I'm wearing
[1:49:40] like amen I can't even try to speak
[1:49:42] English as the as he
[1:49:44] do that does that will not change me
[1:49:48] amen neither it will change him he's
[1:49:50] wearing my suit amen this is even though
[1:49:53] it's Isaac
[1:49:54] suit amen but inside of him
[1:49:57] is amen so when we come to God Amen we
[1:50:01] have to come to him amen knowing what we
[1:50:05] are
[1:50:07] inside don't let this body amen dictate
[1:50:10] who you
[1:50:13] are amen you have to come to God Amen
[1:50:17] knowing what is inside of you
[1:50:20] amen knowing that you are a son of
[1:50:23] God even though you make
[1:50:25] mistakes am even though you make mes
[1:50:29] that will never take you out of the
[1:50:32] picture even though you lied
[1:50:35] yesterday that will never take you out
[1:50:37] of the
[1:50:38] be you are still the Son of God because
[1:50:42] there is his seed inside of Amen you all
[1:50:45] still the daughter of God because of
[1:50:48] what is inside of you
[1:50:51] God looks at what is
[1:50:53] inside this cover amen this will never
[1:50:57] dictate our
[1:50:58] Liv we make
[1:51:00] mistakes we fall every day amen we tell
[1:51:04] lies every day but still within us we
[1:51:08] have that that desire am of becoming
[1:51:11] true God of becoming sons of God Amen we
[1:51:15] have that desire amen of serving God
[1:51:19] Amen we have
[1:51:20] desire of becoming perfect and that's
[1:51:24] what God looks at that's what God looks
[1:51:27] at because there is a quote that the
[1:51:29] prophet he said that the mistake that
[1:51:32] the The Devil
[1:51:34] Makes is to let you come into this
[1:51:38] room to let you come into this
[1:51:41] church because he knows exactly what you
[1:51:44] did
[1:51:45] before he knows exactly what the kind of
[1:51:48] sins that you have made
[1:51:51] amen but God looks
[1:51:53] beyond amen he looks beond the
[1:51:56] ve he looks what's inside
[1:51:59] of this is my son amen he has in him the
[1:52:03] desire of
[1:52:05] serving still is not strong
[1:52:07] enough so I'm going to give him a
[1:52:10] word I will strengthen him I'm going to
[1:52:14] give him something that will help him
[1:52:16] out it's like Peter when said when he
[1:52:20] said bid me to B me
[1:52:23] come Peter started walking on the water
[1:52:27] amen God knew the desire of
[1:52:29] Peter God knew what Peter wanted but
[1:52:33] even if Peter started to
[1:52:35] sink that did not change what God was
[1:52:39] seeing
[1:52:42] when amen God just to reach
[1:52:45] out and pulled him
[1:52:47] out even if you were a sinner
[1:52:50] you've done some bad stuff amen that
[1:52:53] people cannot even cannot even
[1:52:56] imagine amen that does not change who
[1:52:58] you
[1:52:59] are Amen in God you are his
[1:53:02] son before the foundation you are his
[1:53:06] son so you that will not
[1:53:09] change that will not change the
[1:53:13] thought Just Keep On

[1:53:18] Believing amen if it doesn't come
[1:53:21] today just keep on believ because you
[1:53:24] are his son amen you are his daughter he
[1:53:28] called you his son he called you his
[1:53:32] friend he's the one who called you you
[1:53:35] did not called yourself God's friend
[1:53:38] he's the one who chose you he you did
[1:53:41] not choose
[1:53:43] him chose you he chose to love you he
[1:53:47] knew exactly who you were before
[1:53:52] amen so that will not
[1:53:54] change amen Just Keep On Believing keep
[1:53:57] on beli Amen that suit that you
[1:54:00] wearing amen doesn't change who you are
[1:54:04] amen God is looking inside
[1:54:06] of Jacob tried to change his
[1:54:08] clothes amen Jacob tried to change his
[1:54:11] smell amen Jacob tried to change the way
[1:54:14] he was
[1:54:16] talking amen but still that that did not
[1:54:18] change who he was
[1:54:20] amen he was still Jacob and God knew him
[1:54:23] of who he was amen so that's the reason
[1:54:26] why God sent that
[1:54:28] angel Amen to give him that opportunity
[1:54:31] again recognize who he was amen so you
[1:54:35] are sons of God you are a daughter of
[1:54:38] God Amen that's who you are amen that's
