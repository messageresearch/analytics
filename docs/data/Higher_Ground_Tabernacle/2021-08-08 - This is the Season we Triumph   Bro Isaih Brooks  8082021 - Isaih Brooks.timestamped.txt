[28:31] revelations the third chapter
[28:36] and we're going to read the
[28:40] fifth chapter apocalypse
[28:47] and then we're going to back it up to
[28:48] the
[28:50] at the fifth chapter the tenth verse
[28:54] then we'll go to revelations eight and
[28:56] one
[29:04] in our last scripture matthew 24 24.
[29:09] trust that god will allow us
[29:12] to speak for him this morning
[29:16] revelations uh 5 and 13.
[29:21] and every creature
[29:23] which is in heaven
[29:25] and on earth
[29:27] and under the earth
[29:28] and such as are in the sea
[29:31] and all that are in them
[29:33] heard i saying
[29:35] blessing and honor and glory and power
[29:39] be unto him that sitteth upon the throne
[29:42] and unto the lamb forever and ever
[30:05] and has made us unto our god
[30:08] king and priest
[30:10] and we shall reign on earth
[30:20] it is
[30:27] we're now asked to turn with us to
[30:30] revelations eight one
[30:36] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[30:39] there was silence in heaven
[30:41] about the space of a half hour
[30:44] continue
[30:48] on two more scriptures revelations 22
[30:52] 16.
[31:04] i jesus
[31:07] have sent mine angel to testify unto you
[31:11] these things in the churches
[31:13] i am the root and offspring of david
[31:17] in the bright and morning star
[31:28] one more scripture and then you can be
[31:29] seated
[31:43] matthew 24 24 matrix
[31:47] for there shall rise false christ
[31:50] and false prophets
[31:52] and shall show great signs and wonders
[31:55] in so much
[31:56] that if it were possible
[31:59] they shall deceive
[32:00] the very elect
[32:10] hallelujah let us pray
[32:12] father god we come before you
[32:15] thank you for your amazing grace
[32:18] we thank you for being so good to us
[32:21] father we ask that you give us the grace
[32:23] this morning
[32:25] completely out of your way
[32:52] we are at a time where we must come to
[32:55] see
[32:57] that we basically are
[33:00] getting ready to
[33:02] engage into a more intense
[33:12] but i thank god because the lord has
[33:16] equipped us
[33:21] to do so the
[33:24] we know by god's grace
[33:28] that god has given us uh
[33:31] his greatest weapon tree jude
[33:35] sonama
[33:36] the number one weapon tree is his word
[33:42] and of course the second is prayer
[33:46] because we realize that prayer
[33:48] changes things
[33:52] amen
[33:54] i believe that this is the season
[33:58] that the bride of jesus christ shall try
[34:01] out
[34:04] we have watched
[34:07] seasons come and go this season
[34:10] but i believe this is the season measure
[34:12] quakers say that god has allotted to the
[34:15] bride of jesus christ could you accord
[34:18] to make sure she's ready
[34:23] when we talk about trial
[34:26] we must realize uh it is to celebrate a
[34:30] victory
[34:32] celebrate
[34:41] or someone great in the roman empire
[34:58] and they would have a great celebration
[35:00] of triumph
[35:12] and so basically that's where that word
[35:14] triumph come from
[35:19] and you know i know you say that one day
[35:22] we'll see that same type of marching in
[35:26] conjunction
[35:28] because brother branham tells us
[35:31] that when jesus conquered death hell in
[35:34] the grave
[35:39] that the old testament saints
[35:41] lisander nonsense
[35:55] that in the preview of the bride
[35:58] la vision
[35:59] she was marching
[36:02] at the tune
[36:04] on with christian soldiers
[36:06] [Music]
[36:08] she had triumphed
[36:11] and she was marching upward
[36:15] but in this march they don't sit man
[36:17] there were a few that were getting out
[36:19] of step yeah
[36:22] and the prophet of god
[36:24] screams in line
[36:28] stay in line
[36:31] and at that time
[36:33] he woke up
[36:35] from the vision
[36:38] now we're living in a time where satan
[36:41] job is to distract you
[36:45] hallelujah
[36:47] and so therefore
[36:49] we must come to know our purpose
[37:00] to the greatest of all animals just just
[37:02] completely undetermined know their
[37:04] purpose
[37:05] is
[37:06] objective trees know their purpose
[37:08] lizard is connects their objective right
[37:12] and
[37:12] once a tree is quicker it lost an
[37:15] application and brought to life it
[37:17] killed on you this stays within its
[37:19] purpose
[37:45] i want to say to everybody here this
[37:48] morning
[38:02] hallelujah
[38:15] to become a true christian
[38:28] it is amazing
[38:37] whether we realize it or not
[38:40] but those of us may see who are true
[38:43] seed of god it's
[38:46] you were born into this world
[38:49] victorious victoria
[38:52] hallelujah
[38:53] and how'd that happen
[38:56] is that christ paid
[38:59] be the debt
[39:00] because we were all born sinners that's
[39:03] considered to sneak out christ paid the
[39:05] debts
[39:07] he gave us the liberty
[39:11] to find that purpose
[39:24] [Music]
[39:39] they would be offended
[39:42] hallelujah
[39:44] and what they failed to see
[39:46] monk devoir is that there is no way
[39:49] you could come behind yourself
[39:53] hallelujah because throughout all of the
[39:56] years i've lived
[39:59] before becoming a christian avon
[40:03] i did not even know
[40:05] who myself was
[40:09] hallelujah
[40:10] and that is the way it is it's it comes
[40:12] to life without jesus christ son jesus
[40:15] you will never come to know who you are
[40:20] hallelujah you love the lord
[40:22] i'm taking
[40:34] the scripture is it true
[40:37] what jesus says
[40:39] i am the root just
[40:42] an offspring
[40:45] it gives us
[40:47] understanding
[40:50] who we really are the kingdom some
[40:52] exactly because remember
[40:54] in the parables about the seed
[40:58] there was one seed
[41:01] that had no roots
[41:04] and
[41:17] but because jesus is the tree of life
[41:23] and he declares that he is the root
[41:27] of the beginning
[41:29] and he's also the offspring of it
[41:46] is that right
[42:28] we know the word of god
[42:31] that age had to die
[42:35] in order to bring forth of its kind
[42:41] in the process of this tree maturing
[42:45] to a place
[42:47] we call it the pentecostal place
[42:51] and they thought they were the seed
[42:55] and they were not the seeds
[43:10] a messenger
[43:12] that came to define given
[43:15] us
[43:17] who we are
[43:19] and why we are different
[43:22] from all the rest
[43:23] hallelujah
[43:25] and we could never
[43:27] ever say
[43:29] that we are the same to some remember
[43:31] hallelujah we came by the same life
[43:35] but we have come to a place
[43:38] where c
[43:52] because when we were planted
[43:55] we were planted by the good sower
[43:59] is that right
[44:00] the bible says there was a good sower
[44:06] from
[44:08] [Applause]
[45:29] which means one just defeat a messenger
[45:32] that would come from god
[45:34] that would separate the wheat from the
[45:36] test
[45:38] this message
[45:40] is the very thing
[45:42] separates us
[45:44] from the wheat and
[45:58] because
[46:12] it is
[46:52] [Music]
[46:55] so when we do fail
[46:57] hallelujah he triumphs
[47:00] y'all understand me because the bible
[47:02] says
[47:03] that not only does we triumph in him
[47:07] he comforts
[47:19] he knows what you're going through
[47:37] jesus hallelujah
[47:39] you love the lord amen
[47:41] second corinthians
[47:45] the second chapter
[47:47] in the 14th verse
[47:57] not really no
[48:00] you just think this is a hard time
[48:04] because
[48:18] then
[48:31] i want to say so i have to say it you
[48:33] you
[48:34] you ask a woman
[48:38] when she's going through
[48:41] having a baby
[48:44] when the when the when the pains first
[48:46] start
[49:00] every woman is different some people
[49:01] feel more pain than others
[49:05] but you know i was with my wife when she
[49:07] was in labor
[49:09] with my family
[49:10] and there was no way i could comprehend
[49:12] her pain
[49:14] hallelujah
[49:15] but one thing i i could tell my intro is
[49:18] that when the when the labor pain got
[49:21] harder
[49:24] yes
[49:25] i can remember
[49:26] souvenirs when she was shaking her
[49:28] head like this is a theater
[49:30] and it was basically she was saying i
[49:32] can't take it no more
[49:36] y'all understand me now i'm not trying
[49:38] to scare my sisters
[49:42] god was
[49:55] you were going to die
[50:22] see when the seventh seal was opened
[50:24] let's
[50:26] that was our victory seal
[50:29] that was our completion
[50:32] that was our victory seal
[50:34] that was powerful completion
[50:37] hallelujah
[50:38] and and
[50:39] and brother branham said
[50:41] he saw it he love you but he couldn't
[50:44] interpret it
[50:46] up with hallelujah but one thing i know
[50:48] about god
[50:50] the prophet said that god will interpret
[50:53] the scripture himself
[50:56] and you and i must understand
[50:59] we are the interpretations
[51:04] of brother how can that be
[51:06] because the prophecy
[51:45] hallelujah when god begins to reveal to
[51:48] you those questions
[52:00] christ was on the scene
[52:16] disciples
[52:19] the son of man i'm good hallelujah
[52:23] what are you saying occasionally
[52:25] only the true bride of christ
[52:28] i understand who malachi 4 is
[52:45] hallelujah
[52:46] by way of who you are
[52:49] is that right you must come to know by
[52:53] revelation
[52:54] you are the bride of jesus christ
[52:58] hallelujah
[53:02] the 14th verse look at those embassy now
[53:05] thanks be to god
[53:07] which always causes us
[53:10] to triumph in
[53:12] christ and maketh manifest the savior of
[53:16] his knowledge
[53:17] by us in every place
[53:26] for we are unto god a sweet savior of
[53:30] christ
[53:31] in them that are saved and in them that
[53:35] perish
[53:54] as trophies of christ's victory
[53:58] and through a spreads
[54:02] and make evidence
[54:05] the fragrance of the knowledge of god
[54:08] everywhere
[54:30] hallelujah because that bread
[54:33] would get old
[54:36] but in the holy of holies
[54:40] that bread super
[54:42] never grew old
[54:43] jesus it was always fresh
[54:46] why because it would represent it
[54:49] the eternal life of god
[54:52] it represented the eternal body of god
[54:57] oh my god help us here
[54:59] so what are you saying
[55:01] god leads us
[55:04] into
[55:08] is that right
[55:09] even when you feel like you don't know
[55:12] which way to go
[55:17] that's the footsteps of a righteous man
[55:20] by god
[55:22] is that right
[55:24] amen you take for example
[55:27] when gideon was really perplexed
[55:30] and we ministered on this a little bit
[55:32] the other day
[55:34] but gideon was really
[55:36] uh upset
[55:38] he could not understand
[55:41] why he was suffering so much
[55:45] understand
[56:14] the very altar of god
[56:17] because they couldn't do it
[56:19] hallelujah because they had nothing to
[56:21] sacrifice
[56:23] hallelujah
[56:24] it got so bad
[56:26] the enemy was taking everything away
[56:28] from them
[56:31] everything but they're like the very
[56:33] life uh that they possessed
[56:36] hallelujah and gideon's saying
[56:40] where be this god
[56:42] i
[56:51] hallelujah is that right
[56:53] and when he spoke those words
[57:08] you see gideon at that
[57:10] time did not know his purpose
[57:14] but his purpose
[57:16] was not only to conquer his enemies
[57:19] but to prove that god was living with
[57:21] him
[57:23] this is the bride's portion
[57:26] we did not come to be a denomination
[57:29] we did not come to be an organization
[57:32] we did not even come to be a group
[57:35] hallelujah but we are a one-man army
[57:48] jesus christ is still the same
[57:51] christians
[57:52] today
[58:20] and we
[58:35] just like the methodists just come limit
[58:37] to these just like all of the other ages
[58:39] become listed they miss the move of god
[58:43] because of their doctrines
[58:48] and all of these isms
[58:50] hallelujah but let me say it like this
[58:52] this one the message was brought to us
[58:59] i'ma say that again
[59:01] the message was brought to us
[59:06] not to fight with our brothers
[59:11] you can't change what is there
[59:15] more tear is
[59:26] pray for those that despitefully use us
[59:30] quiet now
[59:58] we understand
[1:00:26] amen you see because brother branham
[1:00:28] said it like this
[1:00:30] you see that power without character la
[1:00:32] poisson character satanic is satanic
[1:00:35] hallelujah and we've had that for a long
[1:00:37] time
[1:00:39] can produce that kind of a thing
[1:00:43] is that right
[1:00:45] i know a brother
[1:00:47] whose mother was a hindu
[1:00:50] and even in her ministry
[1:00:54] people were healed
[1:00:59] so you see
[1:01:00] it ain't about
[1:01:01] healing only
[1:01:04] it's not about casting out devils
[1:01:08] it's not about speaking in tongues
[1:01:11] because the tales can do all of that
[1:01:13] it is the same
[1:01:15] thing
[1:01:16] that falls on the table
[1:01:18] and also it falls on the way
[1:01:21] hallelujah but the difference between
[1:01:24] the tear and the weak
[1:01:26] is where the terror come from
[1:01:30] and where the weak come from
[1:01:33] you understand what i'm saying
[1:01:35] you and i must understand
[1:02:04] that spirit of causing people pain
[1:02:09] because it gives you pleasure
[1:02:12] that is not of god
[1:02:15] um
[1:02:18] coming from the papa's vision
[1:02:20] department paragraph 151
[1:02:23] brother benjamin said when the first
[1:02:25] church age started
[1:02:28] it was ephesus
[1:02:30] and paul
[1:02:31] paul the angel of that church launcher
[1:02:33] city one of the stars
[1:02:37] there were seven stars
[1:02:39] which means seven angels
[1:02:41] even seven messengers uh
[1:02:45] and now we know what paul said
[1:02:48] paul said except a man preached the
[1:02:50] gospel
[1:02:58] the difference between christ
[1:03:00] and the antichrist christopher because
[1:03:03] the antichrist
[1:03:04] will always get away but from the
[1:03:07] original word
[1:03:10] hallelujah and so it wasn't like paul
[1:03:12] was cursing them as a pacquiao
[1:03:46] and of course you know jesus uh was the
[1:03:48] lion of the tribe of judah
[1:03:53] you know i loved that every time i said
[1:03:55] the lion of the tribe of judah something
[1:03:58] just kind of leaps on the inside of my
[1:03:59] heart
[1:04:01] which is christ
[1:04:03] hallelujah now i'm gonna go
[1:04:05] go to matthew 13 just a moment
[1:04:10] do everybody get what i'm trying to say
[1:04:13] let me say it as directly as i possibly
[1:04:15] can
[1:04:17] when you are wheat
[1:04:21] uh uh uh you were predestinated to be
[1:04:24] that is it
[1:04:35] and some of us can see
[1:04:37] things that others can't
[1:05:00] let me say this like somebody told me
[1:05:02] the other day they just wanted to come
[1:05:03] get them
[1:05:04] say the turtle
[1:05:06] a turtle can stretch his neck
[1:05:13] but there's another animal that can
[1:05:15] stretch their neck too
[1:05:18] and that's the giraffe you see
[1:05:20] the giraffe
[1:05:35] and you know the one thing about a
[1:05:36] giraffe
[1:05:38] he has to keep his head up
[1:05:42] because when he lets his uh uh head go
[1:05:45] down
[1:05:47] it cuts off his circulation
[1:05:51] blood circulation
[1:05:53] and if he keeps it down there long
[1:05:54] enough he'll faint
[1:05:55] [Music]
[1:05:58] hallelujah it can remind me of some of
[1:06:00] us
[1:06:16] god has somebody else to eat the bottom
[1:06:20] we have been ordained to eat the top in
[1:06:22] some aldonee and as long as we keep our
[1:06:25] hands up
[1:06:27] not only will we be able to feed
[1:06:29] ourselves
[1:06:57] hallelujah
[1:07:02] faith is a revelation the fortunes you
[1:07:04] know and and you know i'm going to say
[1:07:06] this because and i don't say this to be
[1:07:08] a prideful person
[1:07:10] but when i was in high school
[1:07:14] you know i took the air force
[1:07:16] uh rotc program philly program the air
[1:07:19] force and in that program
[1:07:22] i became the lieutenant colonel
[1:07:26] that's when i had a little something
[1:07:30] and then when i graduated from high
[1:07:32] school
[1:07:35] i graduated the highest honor
[1:07:38] it may not seem like that now because
[1:07:40] i've gone through some hard times
[1:07:45] and i made history in columbia south
[1:07:47] carolina
[1:07:50] they had me on the television set
[1:07:54] this was a time uh before getting my
[1:07:57] results back
[1:08:00] they were asking us a question
[1:08:02] you know if you make it to the air force
[1:08:04] academy
[1:08:05] academy
[1:08:06] um
[1:08:08] would you really be happy about it
[1:08:12] and i said no it's not if i make it
[1:08:16] i will be accepted
[1:08:19] and my friends thought i was really
[1:08:21] stupid
[1:08:22] mr
[1:08:36] out of that group there's a group that
[1:08:38] was accepted
[1:08:42] it was a faith
[1:08:44] it was a revelation
[1:08:46] i didn't know how
[1:08:47] i just knew it was going to happen
[1:08:50] and it did it
[1:08:52] and i'm not going to go through the rest
[1:08:53] of the story is really rested but the
[1:08:55] point is i did get there
[1:09:00] that's how faith is is
[1:09:02] when you confess it just confess
[1:09:18] you can have
[1:09:20] hallelujah
[1:09:22] and that's what satan do uh that's what
[1:09:23] god does it's good jeremy gives you some
[1:09:26] kind of vision in your mind
[1:09:28] where you know it's real
[1:09:30] it's going to happen you love the lord
[1:09:32] let me move
[1:09:46] temptations
[1:09:48] knowing that
[1:09:50] of your faith
[1:09:54] you say god i want to be just like you
[1:09:56] listen
[1:09:57] take your hands off
[1:10:00] get out of his way
[1:10:03] let god perfect you listen
[1:10:06] go through what you've got to go through
[1:10:10] all thank give thanks
[1:10:14] he is
[1:10:29] virtue does not come by la la virtue
[1:10:33] easy facile
[1:10:35] it's not something given to you easily
[1:10:39] you've got to fight for it
[1:10:42] but
[1:10:56] go listen to it
[1:10:59] and i'm going to tell you
[1:11:01] you've got to be really careful
[1:11:04] with your attitude toward the world
[1:11:07] because you have no idea
[1:11:09] when you project the wrong attitude
[1:11:13] at a time when god says
[1:11:15] that's enough
[1:11:17] you've got to be really careful
[1:11:20] hallelujah
[1:11:22] because god is not in the begging
[1:11:24] business
[1:11:38] another power will put forth he for uh
[1:11:41] uh another power will put he forth unto
[1:11:44] them saying
[1:11:46] the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a
[1:11:48] man which soweth good seed in his field
[1:12:19] which was a type of the nature of god
[1:12:23] and then the other seed i'm sorry
[1:12:29] then the other seed
[1:12:32] hallelujah had the nature of the devil
[1:12:37] hallelujah
[1:12:38] now you must understand
[1:12:41] both of these seeds were in the same
[1:12:44] field
[1:12:46] they went to the same church
[1:12:48] they heard the
[1:12:54] [Music]
[1:13:01] you understand me uh you say well
[1:13:05] brother books what's the difference they
[1:13:07] were all anointed
[1:13:10] by the same anointing
[1:13:14] hallelujah
[1:13:15] is that right
[1:13:16] you say well brother books what is going
[1:13:18] on
[1:13:20] we've had a lot of people following this
[1:13:22] message
[1:13:24] the back slide is one thing
[1:13:27] to denounce it
[1:13:29] is another thing you know
[1:13:45] another one at the end time
[1:13:47] paragraph 233
[1:13:49] he said no
[1:13:51] you go back and then and try to live
[1:13:53] again
[1:13:56] they leave it and they go back and try
[1:13:58] to live again
[1:14:12] you left
[1:14:39] it never does
[1:14:42] it is impossible
[1:14:44] for those which were enlightened
[1:14:47] and didn't move on
[1:14:50] the word
[1:14:51] as it came to pass
[1:14:53] he said they are
[1:14:54] dead they're gone
[1:14:57] and the thorns and the thistles
[1:15:01] which is nigh unto rejection
[1:15:04] who's in is to be burned
[1:15:07] don't laugh
[1:15:20] you ought to thank god
[1:15:24] hallelujah because all of these things
[1:15:27] must happen
[1:15:30] hallelujah the separation must happen
[1:15:33] hallelujah what causes you to be
[1:15:36] magnetized to the word
[1:15:40] um
[1:15:43] hallelujah you see what i'm trying to
[1:15:45] get you to see is that excuses
[1:15:49] you need to be about your father's
[1:15:51] business
[1:15:53] you need to define your purpose
[1:15:55] and your purpose is to prove i say it
[1:15:57] again
[1:15:58] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:16:01] the day and forever
[1:16:03] hallelujah the very mind of christ
[1:16:06] must be formed in you
[1:16:08] for me and that is something that you
[1:16:10] can't do
[1:16:14] hallelujah
[1:16:15] he's got to do it
[1:16:18] but he can only do that when he
[1:16:20] personally fell to the wheat
[1:16:22] oblay
[1:16:24] what season you're in he said
[1:16:27] that's the point we're trying to get
[1:16:28] over to you
[1:16:29] point
[1:16:42] you know
[1:16:44] we look at this thing and uh
[1:16:46] we must understand that this thing is uh
[1:16:49] oh we sing that song everything is
[1:16:50] moving by the power of god
[1:16:54] and i can't help but to think about
[1:16:55] brother branham in that
[1:16:57] region of the laws
[1:17:14] a burning
[1:17:36] and we look at this thing it says well
[1:17:38] god sent a prophet
[1:17:42] it's
[1:17:56] foreign
[1:18:10] not because of your goodness
[1:18:13] not because you was a nice person
[1:18:16] not because you did not bear the image
[1:18:19] of the children of the wrath
[1:18:23] because you had representation
[1:18:47] [Music]
[1:19:05] i will remain god's business
[1:19:09] see we go to uh uh a pray on this law i
[1:19:12] was just teaching on that the other day
[1:19:14] we go to pray
[1:19:16] and we've got all of these voices
[1:19:18] running through our minds
[1:19:47] a lot of times we pray and because we've
[1:19:50] got memories it comes along i mean well
[1:19:53] he did me this way oh yeah
[1:19:55] she did me that in my face well with
[1:19:57] that kind of thought

[1:20:05] [Music]
[1:20:16] is
[1:20:59] he came before god he lived in the event
[1:21:01] he was a sinner
[1:21:02] who had never been forgiven before in
[1:21:05] his life
[1:21:08] that's not the bride

[1:21:13] jesus christ
[1:21:21] you understand me you say well what do
[1:21:23] you mean
[1:21:24] because when jesus on the
[1:21:26] cross father forgive them

[1:21:32] hallelujah that was placed into his dna
[1:21:36] you hear what i'm saying
[1:21:37] and if you're born of the same seeds
[1:21:55] hallelujah but he says lord
[1:21:58] oh not these things to their church
[1:22:02] that was not amazing
[1:22:04] that was christ in the man
[1:22:07] that's the way the bride operates it
[1:22:09] comes like you're liposuction
[1:22:12] hallelujah
[1:22:14] you gotta shut the devil down
[1:22:16] whenever he comes to your mind shut him
[1:22:18] down
[1:22:22] in your mind
[1:22:24] shut him down don't vote
[1:22:26] if you can't use the word
[1:22:28] bring a song to victory
[1:22:31] hallelujah power power wonder working
[1:22:33] power
[1:22:34] in the blood
[1:22:35] hallelujah give the devil a headache
[1:22:39] hallelujah migraine headache hallelujah
[1:22:42] you need to shout out loud
[1:22:45] and um let god let the devil know
[1:22:49] you are on the battlefield
[1:23:01] you know it's like when jesus said law
[1:23:03] in the word of god it says lead
[1:23:21] no the word of god is saying
[1:23:24] lord whenever i'm placed
[1:23:27] in a position where there's temptation
[1:23:30] give me strength to overcome
[1:23:37] amen now jesus was led into the
[1:23:40] wilderness jesus
[1:23:42] said
[1:23:43] the devil
[1:23:44] god didn't lead him into temptation
[1:24:00] those can know when he falls
[1:24:04] by his own lust
[1:24:06] hallelujah he's tempted by his own loss
[1:24:10] hallelujah if you don't have nothing
[1:24:12] inside to lust
[1:24:27] yes
[1:24:29] second corinthians 10. and we hear these
[1:24:31] scriptures all the time
[1:24:35] give me five more minutes
[1:24:38] we started a little late uh we were
[1:24:39] having problems there with the system
[1:24:41] there

[1:25:08] go to the restroom
[1:25:25] for the weapon of our warfare are not
[1:25:28] carnal
[1:25:29] but mighty through god to the pulling
[1:25:32] down of the strong holes
[1:25:42] casting down imaginations
[1:25:45] every high thing that exalts itself
[1:25:47] against the knowledge of god to the
[1:25:50] pulling down of the strongholds no
[1:26:00] and having in a readiness to revenge
[1:26:04] all disobedience when your disor your
[1:26:07] obedience is fulfilled
[1:26:14] you love the lord
[1:26:17] there's a quote i'm trying to find and
[1:26:19] it's a real good one just give me a
[1:26:21] minute do you want me let me let me read
[1:26:24] it here uh just wanted to leave you see
[1:26:27] brother bram says
[1:26:29] hey uh
[1:26:32] can you read my writing
[1:26:37] amen
[1:26:39] no man
[1:26:40] can come to me
[1:26:42] except my father draws him.
[1:26:48] and all the father has given me
[1:26:52] then brother adam says
[1:26:53] in the root
[1:26:56] you're in the root
[1:26:59] you were in the root
[1:27:01] those are the ones that his father has
[1:27:03] given him
[1:27:06] and the root will come to me
[1:27:08] [Music]
[1:27:10] see you get it
[1:27:12] oh how we should love him
[1:27:17] praise him
[1:27:19] to see the fruit of the spirit divinely
[1:27:22] in the last days
[1:27:24] and the bright tree elaborate
[1:27:26] brightening
[1:27:28] in the time
[1:27:30] he says what listen he says what is the
[1:27:33] fruit did you say
[1:27:36] he said the word la pagoda for fruit for
[1:27:40] the season
[1:27:44] that's what
[1:27:58] denomination
[1:28:13] far more advanced than i am
[1:28:18] brother brother been gone ever since
[1:28:20] 1965.
[1:28:24] but before he left
[1:28:40] up
[1:28:53] amen that still was yet to be placed
[1:28:57] and then he came with the capstone
[1:28:59] message
[1:29:01] and this message is different from
[1:29:03] pentecost
[1:29:07] yes we agree
[1:29:10] [Music]
[1:29:19] [Music]
[1:29:21] was composed of mostly
[1:29:36] the pentecostal everybody
[1:29:39] move with the pill of fire
[1:29:42] they were left behind
[1:29:45] you said well what do you mean brother
[1:29:46] brooks
[1:29:47] that's why their message can never
[1:29:49] perfect
[1:29:50] us hallelujah they had a message
[1:29:55] they could literally go down into the
[1:29:56] spirit realm
[1:30:00] they had those who had uh
[1:30:05] and healing of them even went into this
[1:30:07] uh different kinds of discernments
[1:30:10] so it's not like malachi 4.
[1:30:13] you know they would say somebody's in
[1:30:14] the audience is sick
[1:30:18] somebody in the audience got a headache
[1:30:21] they always generalized it
[1:30:24] but god
[1:30:26] pinpointed
[1:30:28] hallelujah
[1:30:29] and that was god
[1:30:31] he was the only one that could do it
[1:30:33] hallelujah it wasn't william branham
[1:30:36] it was god in the man
[1:30:39] hallelujah now all of us will agree
[1:30:42] on that that god used him
[1:30:45] hallelujah to show himself
[1:31:09] and you know they these kind i've got
[1:31:12] i i know they have exclusive success
[1:31:39] now i know y'all gonna run and get some
[1:31:40] peaches
[1:31:42] but the point is
[1:31:44] that peach was just exactly what i
[1:31:47] expected it to be said exactly it didn't
[1:31:50] taste like
[1:31:51] salad it didn't taste like coconut
[1:31:53] orange
[1:31:56] um
[1:31:58] [Music]
[1:32:25] because that seed had to be perfect
[1:32:27] words
[1:32:28] understand me but why why paul's church
[1:32:32] could not take a rapture because it was
[1:32:35] not the sea it was not the rapture times
[1:32:51] [Applause]
[1:32:58] hallelujah
[1:32:59] lord of god
[1:33:01] hallelujah
[1:33:05] oh lord in this last quote
[1:33:10] coming from the seed of discrepancies
[1:33:14] uh paragraph 21
[1:33:16] he says now he said
[1:33:18] the seed of god that's the most the word
[1:33:48] that they're living in you understand me
[1:33:52] even when it came to luther
[1:33:55] it was still the word of god
[1:33:58] wesleyans were the word of god
[1:34:00] pentecostals were the word of god
[1:34:02] and they all manifested
[1:34:04] exactly what the words say they would
[1:34:06] manipulate exactly
[1:34:08] hallelujah
[1:34:09] but this bride
[1:34:11] is supposed to be an invincible
[1:34:13] bride
[1:34:44] mountains
[1:34:58] this does not come
[1:35:00] by religion
[1:35:02] it doesn't come by joining the church
[1:35:05] by being a member of somebody else's
[1:35:07] family
[1:35:08] hallelujah but it does come back
[1:35:11] by being a part of christ
[1:35:18] the problem that god says
[1:35:19] there's only going to be a few to make
[1:35:21] it
[1:35:24] hallelujah
[1:35:28] now if the christian you may not see the
[1:35:30] of the kingdom has become
[1:35:32] the seed of god that's the most then
[1:35:34] there must be the word of god
[1:35:36] the word of god manifested
[1:35:38] in the age that they're living in
[1:35:41] kill you for the promised seed of that
[1:35:43] age
[1:35:46] was promised
[1:35:48] you are promised
[1:35:50] you were the promised seed
[1:35:52] that god's promise would come you're
[1:35:53] judging me i understand what i'm saying
[1:36:08] so because i've got to make sure i've
[1:36:10] got the character that he's looking for
[1:36:13] hallelujah he's coming you know i've got
[1:36:15] him yeah i'm ready
[1:36:17] whatever i gotta go through let me go
[1:36:20] through it let's see what i gotta suffer
[1:36:35] but when he
[1:36:36] comes i want to be a i want him to say
[1:36:39] well done
[1:36:40] well done
[1:36:42] hallelujah you understand me
[1:36:44] we gotta focus
[1:36:47] satan has us so distracted
[1:36:51] hallelujah
[1:36:52] don't you know your life is not even
[1:36:54] promised right now
[1:36:58] just right now
[1:37:04] are you ready because listen there's
[1:37:06] nothing you can say
[1:37:08] or do you
[1:37:09] want this this death strikes you
[1:37:13] oh you're not ready are you ready
[1:37:16] see that's the part satan hides from us
[1:37:30] there in south africa
[1:37:57] you understand me
[1:37:58] and these men were no two not so much
[1:38:00] older than i am
[1:38:05] of age
[1:38:07] believe us
[1:38:09] in the message
[1:38:11] as we say
[1:38:13] all we can do is trust
[1:38:15] that the character of christ
[1:38:20] on earth during the time of
[1:38:22] space
[1:38:26] they were here
[1:38:27] okay i'm closing i'm saying
[1:38:31] the word of god manifested in the age
[1:38:33] that they're living in for the promised
[1:38:35] seed of that age
[1:38:38] god
[1:38:38] gave his word
[1:38:41] at the beginning
[1:38:57] came that's good on the scene
[1:38:59] and he was the seed of god yes the jew
[1:39:01] the word of god
[1:39:04] for that age
[1:39:06] hallelujah do you understand what's
[1:39:08] happening now let's go for components
[1:39:09] it's not only that if they don't hear
[1:39:11] what brother branham says
[1:39:14] but the transition is if they don't hear
[1:39:16] what you say
[1:39:20] because now you're the voice of god
[1:39:24] you're the ones that's crying out to the
[1:39:26] nations
[1:39:28] if there is such thing as preaching to
[1:39:30] the souls that are imprisoned now
[1:39:36] you're the one
[1:39:37] you understand me
[1:39:39] so in closing
[1:39:43] if we're not
[1:39:45] sighing and crying
[1:39:48] for the abominations done in the city
[1:39:52] i'm just going
[1:40:05] you know we don't even sign cry after
[1:40:07] our kinfolk like we ought to
[1:40:11] see
[1:40:13] you
[1:40:13] get it
[1:40:15] brother says
[1:40:17] those are the only kind
[1:40:20] that's going to
[1:40:34] or you
[1:40:42] [Music]
[1:41:17] understand your position
[1:41:19] about position you understand stan if i
[1:41:21] don't
[1:41:22] like esther if i don't cry
[1:41:27] behind this decision
[1:41:30] many souls
[1:41:46] because we failed to tell them
[1:41:50] amen
[1:42:05] god is rich in mercy
[1:42:10] i
[1:42:13] trust that what was said
[1:42:17] has penetrated
[1:42:20] your hearts
[1:42:22] in some way on mania
[1:42:26] like i made the statement earlier
[1:42:29] in the service we come to be changed
[1:42:34] people we don't heard so many good
[1:42:36] things of uh in types and shadows
[1:42:43] and we've had i mean
[1:42:46] times that
[1:42:49] was just
[1:42:50] memorable
[1:42:54] i still remember
[1:42:57] uh
[1:42:58] our new year's service
[1:43:02] i felt like i was 16.
[1:43:06] i had a good time
[1:43:13] i think about how much how much was i
[1:43:16] changed
[1:43:19] the bible said would change from glory
[1:43:20] to glory
[1:43:22] consumption
[1:43:45] but we come because we want god to do
[1:43:48] something in the heart
[1:43:51] [Music]
[1:44:04] i fear god zhu sanju
[1:44:08] even as a preacher you can't you don't
[1:44:10] predicate you have no idea how
[1:44:13] what i go through
[1:44:16] because i know that i'm i will have to
[1:44:19] give an account
[1:44:21] for everything i say
[1:44:23] from this pope
[1:44:27] and i always want to be right
[1:44:30] correct
[1:44:32] because i do not want to say
[1:44:34] anything
[1:44:36] that would cause anyone here to falter
[1:44:39] or to fail
[1:44:43] but so understand what i'm trying to get
[1:44:46] us to see if we could just leave out
[1:44:49] with this
[1:44:51] sort of
[1:44:52] there is a place
[1:44:54] that we must obtain
[1:44:58] and the only way we're going to get
[1:45:00] there
[1:45:27] and i know the habits that we've allowed
[1:45:30] him to
[1:45:31] to bring to us
[1:45:36] easy
[1:45:38] to get away from
[1:45:41] but how many of us believe that god is
[1:45:43] god recommended
[1:45:45] i believe with all of my heart
[1:45:48] can break and destroy every yoke of the
[1:45:51] enemy
[1:45:54] i don't know what you're going through
[1:46:09] it sometimes drains us spiritually
[1:46:12] silent
[1:46:12] [Music]
[1:46:14] we're going to pray to this evening and
[1:46:16] i want everybody to bow
[1:46:20] and i want you to lay on the altar
[1:46:22] whatever it is that you're going through
[1:46:32] don't think about what you've done in
[1:46:33] the past the possibility of your faith
[1:46:36] don't think about anything that's
[1:46:37] negative right now
[1:47:05] these are your people
[1:47:15] the world has
[1:47:17] placed a hook in us
[1:47:20] seem to
[1:47:48] knowing that we
