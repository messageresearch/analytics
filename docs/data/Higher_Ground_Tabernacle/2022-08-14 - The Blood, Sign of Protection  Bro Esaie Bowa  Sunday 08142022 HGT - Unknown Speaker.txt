lord spoke unto moses and aaron in the land of egypt saying this month shall be under you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of year of the year for you to you parley speak unto the congregation of israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their father's lamb foreign and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make you account for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish the male of the first year you shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats and you shall keep it up until the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side post and the and on the upper door posts of the houses wherein they shall eat it that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs for i will pass through the land of egypt that night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt both men and beasts and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment i am the lord and the blood shall be to you for talking upon the house is where you are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt may the lord bless the reading of his word you can be seated like i was saying we're so happy to see you again and i bless the lord who gave us this this opportunity and i also thank the pastor brooks paul la confiance with the scripture that we just read in exodus chapter 12 our title for this morning will be senior de protection the blood the sign of protection a convul and as you heard it this morning israel egypt israel was slave in egypt and it was according to the promise that god made to abraham he said that your seed after you will dwell in a stranger delivery and after 400 years myself god i will come down and deliver my people and they will come out with my my stronger hand israel found themselves in egypt a and moses was the right hand of the lord who supposed to take israel because god said that i would deliver my people with my stronger was supposed to take egypt and israel was a type of the church that we are today israel vandalism israel was enslaved because the promise of god had to fulfill hey so as pharaoh was uh standing there pharaoh refused so that the promise of god uncommon that's why the plagues of god were hitting egypt yes my brothers and sisters israel israel were under protection protection where they were honored was the blood was the sign of the lord egypt god was seeing themselves he had to keep those who were under the blood because the blood was the blood of the land the blood was on the uh lentil yes sunday i knew the blood the blood of the lamb of one hero and we saw jesus says [Applause] that's the angel of god had to kill you here all the firstborn of yourself yes my brothers the problem wasn't to be in ghosts the problem wasn't it's not when i'm when i'm preaching this genevieve is a person i'm not preaching it to one person only or i'm not attacking one person don't say that as i'm talking i'm talking to one person or i'm talking about it but know the brother please when we come to church ourselves i'm coming to church to better myself [Music] [Applause] first time we ever had a messenger uh to all the churches to his name ever end in h am abraham abraham has seven letters six men but graham is six letters [Applause] it's the first time we ever had uh a messenger uh uh uh but we haven't had a man that his name is is end with uh abraham and abraham has seven letters graham facility if you count the letters in graham you'll find out it's six eight numbers and six is it's a men's number man was created on the sixth day they said early number of the truth but seven is god's number now come over seven and ten do you see now as you heard it still in your second form i just wanted to underline where the problem is that the church is in the mess there is no way to distinguish the world and the devil avocados do said they more with all his demons and all the flesh has corrupted the voice of this last days as in the time of noah o'brien [Applause] so the god is also redoubling the most soft devil and you stand in the way yes in the time of nowhere you turned in a way now let's let's let's let's hear what the bible is saying what happened in genesis chapter 6 verse 11 to verse 13. this says see the bible says this the earth also was created before it take place and the earth was filled with violence and god looked and behold i'll destroy them with the earth amen amen because the blood was on that was on the cross was only about five liters my brother says it's it's been 2 000 years old the christian don't don't don't need uh the chemical blood we should need the life that was in the blood yes and your life is coming back the chemical blood today people went astray from their prayers they're pretending as if they're not their words speaks more louder than their words it's a high priest uh uh prayer for us his people jesus was praying and saying bear father i gave them your word and the word the world hated them from the world as me because there's nothing that's there's something that's not around the gun because the world is supposed to hate us but if we walk with him there's something wrong he says you didn't say nastiness somebody but to keep them from evil innocent month they're not from this in the super demon like i'm not of this world you say something sanctify them through the truth your word is the truth we may first have said yes my brothers and sisters we're not from this world jesus is not of the world cosmos because uh the world means cosmos and when jesus is the even though we have good president system but the system says satan it's it's the devil amen it's satan who's leading the poor that is the intellectual understanding of who god is intellectually believe god intellectuals give the word intellectually but there is another phrase that's the word before separation and you don't force it it's it's a life living in public that you've been passed you've been privatized it's just the same life of god personal of control nobody to control you or too the first view is two faces of christianity many of us are still in that intellectual faith i don't want to hurt your feelings it's what the lord has put in my heart today of satan foundation justice is based on injustice under mercy in uh uh depravity the the prevention the mercy that's the thing he will control you by the perversion of morals uh great nations economic uh economics economic they usually have the impression of helping those little countries third so i want to get out of politics i don't want to get in trouble they say that were you in the religious staff for public want to show to you injustice how the devil is doing things today and we see how morals now are bad today you can see a woman keeper salmonella who uh she's walking naked it's not new things these things that you see along the way so there is no sense in people because an animal can be there without the clothing it's fine stored in austin in texas they're in australia they so that to appreciate my masterpiece you have to go in naked being naked men and women men and women taking off their clothes just to appreciate that masterpiece is here in the u.s we have and we're living in the way of falling dancing there is everything that you know is bad christians are those little everything to the children all of that is to show that before dancing living in a certain kingdom is governing and we have to know where we're standing with god amen now listen to what the prophet says in the message marriage and divorce say that if the word is beautiful it's july um and if the world is beautiful of god has to have a good character amen where my father yes my brothers and sisters now when i was talking about uh the

class in this time teleporter i have this program and it's not so song you gotta meet with other men you go meet with other women it's because they presented them a social gospel where preachers stand

have a god satan has multiplied his power to the now the devil is imposing us seen as the as the actual life certainly is doing his best become a normal life and predicate [Music] he's fighting
