for my sins but not just a man but a God man man Andrew armor Hallelujah Romans 4 Romans where we from there Romans 4 20-25 and then we'll go to John 18. 37-38 this is not a continuation of last week something that I thought I throw in as you think next week I mean Sunday we will try to pick up what we left off the dimensions by the grace of God um God is so good to us everybody have that scripture Romans 4 20 to 25. he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God foreign and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform convictions listen to these words therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness because he never doubt it now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe in him that raised up Jesus our lord from the dead here is the punchline who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification is I like to entitle this message is my defense let us pray father we thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy thank you for all that you do for us I pray this evening Lord As We Lift Your Name cleanse us from all unrighteousness there be anything in my life that will hinder your move tonight maybe there's something we missed uh didn't see no father we know that our hearts desires to do your perfect will say service in a special way in Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated I have a subtopico it's called blameless We Know by the grace of God that man was so under sin could sowed and because of it yeah he do all kinds of things that are not according to the word of God the prophet of God said that man is under sin the prophetic but there is a way out he may commit adultery or he stole or broke the Sabbath Commandments but in the days of the law in order to be free he had to get a lamb and this lamb had to be without spots Hallelujah then he had to get a lamb hello and he had to bring the lamb unto the elders and they had to look this lamb over it is the Lamb had to be blameless had to be without a flaw on it Hallelujah so that you can understand the importance of the Lamb being without spots because it had to be a perfect lamb to bring a people to a Perfection that if he had had a blemish that could be your sin and then that lamb would not be able to substitute for you but God made sure that every sin every Act of sin because the lamb had to be blameless he had to be without a flaw on it the prophet God says look at the significance here [Music] you must recognize that all of your sins are gone hallelujah amen amen amen you see every time we make a mistake God is Not sprinkling blood the Bible said die for us once and foreign [Music] [Music] and to this end was I born for this cause it just came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth and everyone you keep going y'all hear this we see everyone that is of the truth here is my voice come on somebody hallelujah amen that means everybody can't hear the voice but everybody that is of the truth here is my voice said unto him what is truth you understand me he wasn't just a Lambs [Music] [Music] everything about that [Music] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah blameless Hallelujah what is blameless people are those who cannot be accused those who cannot be accused wrong before people oh God Hallelujah [Music] and those who accuse you bring you to judge me you would judge them Hallelujah blameless and we we must understand but when you get changed God gives you the holy ghosts in the eyes of God that's why the Bible says now no God damn days blood still prevails [Music] help me here this is what we forget as Christians we have been set free news [Music] amen nothing can stop the Bride of Jesus because in the eyes of God she's blameless he became our sins that we might become the righteousness of God the devil don't like it is [Music] Hallelujah when the Devil comes to charge you show them your sacrifice Hallelujah hey devil you right but I made it right all of that if I'm under the blood hallelujah hallelujah that's all God not on the outside hallelujah amen and if the lamb is blameless glory to God you love the Lord first Thessalonians 5 22-24. Hallelujah the devil has already lost the battle Hallelujah right that's why the word of God says you got a wrestle with this Angel Hallelujah it doesn't come easy but you gotta wrestle with him like Jacob wrestle with the angels Hallelujah and when he felt that anointed no Jacob says I'm not going to let you go till you bless me that's good to me that's how it is in this message that's what it is about the bride she can't stay down foreign Hallelujah the devil can't stand it Jesus he can't stand it like this morning even under the law when they will bring that lamb to the Elder Allah you literally transfer all of your sins all of your thoughts all of your shortcomings and that lamb is dying for you he's dying for you this is what we must understand if you truly Sons and Daughters of God matter of facts get the hell for me Hallelujah be with me Hallelujah he didn't ask for nothing else [Music] first Thessalonians the Bible says the beauty abstain from the appearance of evil absolutely and the Very God of Peace sanctify you Holyfield and I pray God your whole spirit and souls you see that was the blood that's what it is supposed to come from it's not the clothes is that the church Hallelujah he says now ye are the light [Music] try to try foreign amen takes away every state the bleach of the blood pressure takes it back to where it came from and you know but you know where it goes himself so you say oh I didn't do that you did it Hallelujah is that right right amen how you doing brother Isaac thank you Hallelujah God is good to us amen coming from the Rapture message it's part of the 80th chapter and then when the bride is being called out how you going to put it out it's the revelations manifestation the word nothing can tear you from it because you see the revelations is true it's true hallelujah amen and we're living in that day praise be to God the revelation of the mystery of himself Hallelujah the Rapture that that we're talking about it's only for the bride remember the Bible said could I give you the rest of the dead lives not 4 000 years what are we going to do what age are we living in what promise do we have there's going to be a Rapture [Music] be only to the elected the elected lady that pulled out the church foreign [Music] huh glory to God I've been told that my God I confess my sins he can't even remember this so if he can't remember Hallelujah the very word the very Word Church means called out of Happily order as Moses called you calling bride out of a church out of a church members from every denomination it's in the tape a bride coming out and that's the one that the broad tree that's the one that the Broad Street the the bride is the one that's going to be in the Rapture the elected ones so you got to understand this holy ghost that we're talking about that is the real Gene of God Hallelujah [Music] you love the Lord those who are found under the blood Hallelujah why because the lamb lamb stands Justified um Hallelujah coming from the message foreign he separated his sonship because he's under the hands and Dominion of Satan every man that's born of a woman is under the Dominion of Satan is when you don't get saved Hallelujah you can't claim God is your father oh come on somebody Hallelujah and God could sacrifice chemical of the blood of bulls did not divorce sin and only covers Hallelujah if I got a red spot on my hands the red spot is still there that's why I said this message [Music] [Applause] thank God for the mercy Hallelujah but God sent down from heaven a bleach for sin Hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] somebody's got to pay for it at the beginning Hallelujah what happens to the sun he becomes in perfect fellowship with the father again standing on the other side of the castle with no remembrance of sin against him there is no more please that's why Jesus said well because he whom the son says it's free indeed Hallelujah amen we you have been truly set free like Abraham [Music] believe the promises [Music] y'all hear what I'm saying it's not our intellect we don't know how he's doing it praise God he's doing it I don't believe foreign [Music]

noise and the works that are therein shall be burned seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved in all holy conversation and godliness until the coming of the day of God we're in the heavens being on fire and the elements shall melt with the fervent heat I'll say it like this climate change I call it judgment Hallelujah and it's going to get worse the shadows of his wings hey but God says
