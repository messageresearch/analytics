heart amen um brother back there on the sound the the piano here is there a speaker to bring this in just a little bit more of the piano it's real soft here it's hard to hear it just to get the tune of it in our ears and uh if sam wasn't as good as she is she couldn't be able to follow that a little bit more just bring it up just a bit more ah there we go now that sounds pretty [Music] young or i'm too old i can't sing nor preach and no titles do i know what can i do [Music] for i want to do my part and i want to help with all of my heart until the walls come down that's something i can [Applause] my do place calling on your name that's something i can do [Music] my family shows my interests my child they've gone so far and though i tried my best to reach them their hearts seem so hard what can i do to help for my family's lost and dying and my words they don't get the room that i can pray until the walls come down till there's healing all around that's something i can do i can parade in my secret place calling on your name that's something i can do [Music] i can't [Music] [Applause] [Music] now my friend you may not be a singer you may not be a preacher you may not be looked at as someone great in your local community people may look at you and say ah just a regular old job they may not look at you as being some great success in this world but i can promise you this much if you are baptized with the holy ghost the lord jesus said in his word while you were yet praying i've already heard it i already know what the answer is and while you're asking i've already made preparation for what's gonna happen and all you've got to do is raise your voice raise your hands and raise your heart yes sir if you've got the baptism of the holy ghost you can pray and he said i will hear your prayer if you believe it shout a can man until the walls come down [Music] can pray in my secret place calling on your name that's something i can do [Music] i can't pray [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i can play [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] praise the lord ah praise this holy name praise his holy name amen can you say amen to that amen how good he is to us amen if you have your bible this evening we're going to get right into the preaching of the word of the lord would you stand with me one more time and uh by god's grace i want to try my best if the lord will help us to hear what the lord jesus i'm going to try to get my self out of the way to hear what he wants to speak to us tonight and by the way i wasn't supposed to be able to sing until about next year sometime way on down the road they told me they said in september there they said well it'll probably be somewhere in the neighborhood of oh they said maybe may june july august you'll get your breath back and you'll be able to preach and talk and do some things well whenever the lord jesus got it all done and got it all solved amen i i was back in october amen and my big mouth was still singing like it sings now and and i appreciate god's grace but amen it goes to prove what what kind of a person the lord jesus is amen amen so we want to thank the lord today for all of the grace and mercy that he gives us now the lord helping us tonight i want to speak to you i want to try to bring a thought if god will help me i want to try to speak to you tonight upon the bride's equipment if you have your bible let's turn to the book of ephesians for just a moment i don't know what this amen and i'm gonna i had it on but it turned itself off i've got to cut my internet on briefly give me just one moment here let me get this thing fired up everyone said holy amen all right praise the lord roger technology three of the knowledge of good and evil in it ephesians chapter 1 13. ephesians all right there it is i see it now all right by the way i love what you've done with the church here this is jesus i love this right here it's just just gorgeous amen and once again i want to say thank you to brother isaiah in the church it is a blessing to be here and whom also uh whom you also trusted excuse me after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise that of our salvation of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory jesus amen now the word use is here for earnest a greek word that simply means a down payment or a pledge now let's turn to second corinthians chapter one verse 21. i'll see you in the 1 21. praise the lord jesus christ amen he's certainly good to us amen appreciate god's grace 2nd corinthians 1 and 21. now he which establishes uth with us with you in christ and hath anointed us is god saluting christ who have also sealed us and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts now the word that paul uses here for earnest paul uh same english word earnest and earnest um but the first one means a down payment or a pledge with the necessary powers for its administration necessary amen let's pray together for the word lord jesus we stand here in the need of prayer god we need you now more than we've ever needed you lord forgive us oh god our father any of the old sins and things that we might have done the wrongs that may stand before us we might either make them right or be cleansed of them all together and sanctify the lips that speak tonight the prophets have spoken and received from thy words the true anointing will bring us into the revelation in the name of jesus christ amen and amen amen amen and the church said amen and praise the lord you may be truthful amen do you love the lord again amen we should have said that a little bit louder do you love the lord i like how brother brooks had prayed over the musicians i liked something he said a moment ago not even an angel in heaven but it's all about jesus that my friends is the purpose of the message the purpose of translation that is [Music] he lives inside of my heart and i want to tell you something what i want to speak tonight just a little bit i think we're living in a time and if you think about this the prophet went off the scene in 1965 he died in his 50s and right now the message has lived longer than brother branham lived on this earth we know that at the last day there will be an acceleration of growth seemingly nothing will be happening didn't come came everything the creation of what it was on in the coming days if god created me to be an overcomer then the things that i'll have to overcome many of these today you died that was laying in the original seed god almighty flesh throughout him remember he could not be a savior until something was lost [Music] to the negative side negative that's why everything in your life that comes in the negative side it was designed by the creator of purpose it was part of your equipment i want you to think six thousand years has come similar humanity it has fallen down through all the races all of the generations colors and creeds from foreign [Music] that's why they'll shake your hand when this is over with well you come out of ladies what a great thing it'll be obviously even the battery is designed with a positive header negative we was coming over the hill over here sam pulled up in front of this fine bmw i know i don't care what it looks like on the outside i want you to think he had to create something exactly everything hiding in god listen to me now he did not make the devil equal in creation but [Music] is a perfect balance [Music] balance you know what a scale looks like the balance you put some uh nuggets or gold or something in one side well the prophet said the devil on the prophet balance of god so to speak eating balance all right now listen god deposited the devil the negative now let's come to you romans chapter 7. paul said i found the law and that law was within me evil is so the evil that was built into you it's a perfect balance perfection of the good that is placed in you as well was designed to express how you who [Music] hey man am i preaching that fast are you translating that slow which one amen hallelujah and hallelujah amen now if i get too quick on you just just just put put your hand on me and slow down but listen pentecost happening amen amen it's happened and i don't know how to pull it back hallelujah amen now now here's what i want to show you the word earnest money here means a down payment you're baptism of the holy ghost paul said after you trusted me and after you heard the word of truth after you believe you were then sealed with the holy spirit of promise yes i believe but god does not believe your testimony until he it's not when you receive the holy ghost that is when the holy ghost amen not when i receive it and he receives me [Music] oh glory to god i believe the messenger they don't a bit more believe this message not in the world [Music] do you know how we know because if they truly believed it god would confirm that you confirm he would confirm their faith i've given them the holy ghost oh people can say all kinds of things people believe in the easter bunny this is not quite uh the easter bunny but your cookies and your milk and wait up declares that jesus if i said to my brother i'm going to give you 50 after church i shake his hand he said god bless you thank you for that i'm pleasing myself to my brother i am pledging to you you are my child you are my son you are my daughter is that my feelings and i will be responsible for you responsible and he took that veil and laid it across his shoulders oh that you are oh it's now my responsibility all the things that are in store for you and i do this only we could grab a hold of it notice the words paul uses here and whom also you trusted uh the one thing you'll find about people all of them are wanting to do some kind of creative work praise the dead i wish they'd just learned to raise their hands in church just [Music] miracles they'll trust when they're on the mountain for [Music] yes jesus loves me this high now remember now listen in the book of corinthians there they don't live now paul is not going to say something different but now he's walking to another side of the mountain and paul is looking at a different side of the mountain now regardless and it tells us that the earnest is the anointing now here's where it's going to get a little sticky for us i believe that people have misunderstood what is the true anointing you can feel the anointing feel the holy ghost you can feel the power of god moving in your life but that's only the rain and that rain falls on the just in the unjust the rain will of what you really are this proof of that exactly comes from the seed life yeah by the holy ghost i run into people around the country their idea i believe in a lot of these things that we see but not only here but around the world never where this may go i want to make this remark is [Music] the anointing is what gave me the ability to capacity to live right in a world that refuses to live godly the vivoc oh hallelujah hallelujah and as it drinks more than his portion it begins to press out david said i'm like a tree [Music] is jesus was [Music] it was about the design of what the seed was in the beginning if it was a tear since no matter how much water it took everything [Applause] the more conventions she is the true seed of god the rain only brings you to the maturity in other words the foolish virgin can sit right here i don't believe that well that's all right you believe what you want to do but i believe there's a group sitting in the message foolish virgin type people come on well if i can't make it as bright i'll just be foolish version i'm sorry but you don't even qualify you just told me you didn't believe in the holy ghost the foolish virgin could you be that when they cry for it day and night the rain will bring you to that place [Music] they'll even hint that this is the bride's revival but brother the bride's revival and the true anointing is nothing more and nothing less than a relationship with jesus christ i don't need a certain man to lay his hands on me to get it done convention preacher to get me there we run from my head watch out i get too happy shake my head amen and all of that holy ghost just starts pouring out amen i learned a long time ago shake the ketchup bottle you want to get something out of it amen amen and hallelujah amen the holy ghost is an anointing that holds you when you don't feel holy ghost [Music] when there's nothing to be joyous yeah amen amen it was the thing that equipped jesus with the necessary powers for his administration in other words it was a down payment god gave to us what we needed to get us out of here that's why hungry little seeds of god are always crying for more well you listen to me you are only going to get what god what you need to get you out of here [Music] i may not understand all of the mysteries of god get me out of here in other words if you had a water bottle up here for example when we say that we mean the water come from the bottle into something else we know that it was not just a down payment for him because he received the full inheritance with because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor you see that's one of the problems some of the problems some of our big message preachers have got today easy the spirit of god was on him yes the spirit was on him but it wasn't the spirit that fell on him that kept him right the equipping and the furnishings could have saw where peter cut that ear off crucified him next to jesus but when jesus put that ear back on amen that's what him said when i forgive you of your sins i forgive you as though you never died in the first place not even a scar left over right the anointing now jesus uses our apartment luke uses a word here the word in the greek the okay and this particular word is where the true anointing falls upon a person it is the same word that paul uses for earnest god gave him all the equipment he needed to listen to the job that he had to do while he was here you're sitting here thinking to yourself hey man she's always going to be short you know her and i have never seen eye to eye [Laughter] hallelujah i'm tall and she ate once again amen but in every part of our mind we think we'll never achieve what we're supposed to do i've got one question for the prophet said it this way i am called to preach it's the same as moses was but the prophet said he hadn't activated that faith [Music] god put that seed of life in this flesh right here my genetics were not designed to have that seed life inside my bloodstream but it needed to be activated the potentials for what i would be was already there to be activated and that might be the reason some people have never come to that place just yet it activates that part of you actively and the anointing is not just something i feel the resurrection they didn't have equipment they had no true anointing a little witch run around these men are men of god these men are men of god paul said i rebuke you satan this little lady ran around saying these men are men of god these men are men of god she wasn't lying she wasn't telling a false but she had no oh that's a spiritual brother over there that's why some people can sit in the very same service and shout the glory of god no equipment on the inside listen another scripture in saint john chapter 2 verse 19. jesus said destroy this temple in three days i will raise it up again i don't believe that but look at the way that he said in the uh in his uh uh uh his face-to-face confrontation with what was it was it martha i think maybe when he come to lazarus tomb is martha wasn't it didn't even maybe the situation because some people's heads are so hard look around me how bad everything is to activate that word that even though that cold lifeless form was laying in the ground the mcc laying in the grave equipment to call it back up [Music] it can be all kinds of things some people may laugh at your trial yeah i don't understand what your problem is that's not a big deal but you see to them to give you the down payment stand with me if you will in the name of jesus christ amen and amen amen let's bow our heads for prayer our gracious father is [Music] those that are here visible in the audience [Music] later on may they recognize what they got on the inside of it in jesus name [Music] let's worship the lord anybody need prayer come if you'd like [Music] peace [Music] [Laughter] [Music] of jesus christ overcomers in this [Music] through the blood of jesus conquerors oh peace jesus [Music] hallelujah um [Music] god will make this trial a blessing though my tears flow like a river yet in him there's sweet relief there's no need to get discouraged there's no need to talk defeat god will make this [Music] though he sends you to your knees [Music] there's no need [Music] [Music] though my tears flow like a river [Music] there's no need [Music] i've just come into a valley one like i've never been before i keep searching for a way out seems like padlocks are on the doors oh there must be another sunrise [Music] that's the love he has for me [Music] [Music] though my tears flow like a river [Music] [Music] there's no need [Music] is [Music] there's no need to get discouraged god will make this [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] god will make you [Music] let's just give the lord [Music] bless his holy name amen thank you my lord thank you my lord oh how good he is [Music] somebody said to me one time are you trusting in yourself [Music] any good thing about me is because it's good about him [Music] oh yes [Music] is [Music] oh yes [Music] [Music] praise god [Music] [Music] and lonely with [Music] in [Music] i know that i'm a child of the kings [Music] praise god praise god praise [Music] with [Music] me [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh yes oh yes oh yes i'm a child is [Music] praise god praise god praise god [Music] i'm a child of [Music] oh [Music] oh praise god praise god oh crazy is [Music] but we thank god for the word of god [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] himself was identifying himself [Music] about this message [Music] to [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] but i know it was for me just six [Music] falling in love with [Music] was jesus best [Music] with jesus [Music] was the best thing i've ever ever done arms in his arms [Music] arms [Music] oh [Music] no [Music] there's no place i'd rather rather be [Music] i'm falling falling in love with jesus every day oh i'm falling in love with jesus [Music] oh
