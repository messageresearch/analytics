[32:10] amen
[32:12] amen you may have your seat then God
[32:14] bless
[32:17] you your beloved brother
[32:25] Joshua I came with a little inspiration
[32:28] like a
[32:31] greeting it's for the first time for me
[32:34] to be
[32:37] here I know that before the foundation
[32:39] of the world we were all
[32:43] together God saw us in this glorious
[32:47] message preached by
[32:50] brother he knew that we would find
[32:53] oursel
[32:54] tonight and so there is no
[32:58] and there is no
[33:01] surprise my
[33:03] inspiration is that you
[33:06] are you are the
[33:09] Perfection of the evolution of God
[33:16] Amen David asked himself a question what
[33:19] is who is
[33:20] man so that God could think of
[33:24] him he created the the ocean
[33:27] he created the
[33:30] animals he created the gold he created
[33:33] diams he created everything that we know
[33:37] the Sun the
[33:39] moon but he takes all of
[33:42] that and he put it under the feet of man
[33:46] and he tells man have dominion upon
[33:49] those
[33:51] things he makes man master of of his
[33:55] creation so now who is
[33:58] David asked himself this question but
[34:01] glory be to God that in the end time God
[34:05] has promised us that I will send you
[34:08] Elijah the
[34:10] prophet and he will take the Bible he
[34:13] will open the
[34:14] Bible and he will reveal the
[34:16] Bible and we will know all those
[34:19] things that's why the prophet will tell
[34:22] us
[34:23] tonight that man is not a bi logical
[34:28] accident you're not an
[34:31] accident you're not just made like
[34:35] that you are exactly a
[34:38] program a program that started in the
[34:41] thoughts of
[34:42] God when he was
[34:45] eloh you were a little Elohim in
[34:48] him when he was the Fountain of
[34:51] Life you are also a Fountain of Life
[34:54] in and when he changed his form
[34:58] he became the word you also became the
[35:01] word when he became
[35:03] the you also became that
[35:06] little in that in that big
[35:09] logos that's why the prophet will answer
[35:11] to
[35:13] us even though Moses already gave the
[35:16] answer when you read Genesis first
[35:19] chapter verse 26 says it says make let
[35:23] let us make man in our image
[35:29] in the image of
[35:31] God and in our
[35:36] likeness that means that this man must
[35:39] have dominion upon the creation of
[35:44] God listen to to our Prophet
[35:47] does it makes me feel
[35:52] good thank you for this opportunity it
[35:54] makes me feel
[35:55] good
[35:57] in the sermon uh the
[35:59] countdown the
[36:03] countdown preach in 19 1962
[36:09] March in paragraph
[36:21] 32
[36:24] okay it
[36:28] go
[36:31] ahead I want I want him to read with me
[36:34] so I can learn English as as him
[36:37] too
[36:39] okay and I pray that
[36:42] God so that next time I come here I will
[36:45] also preach in
[36:48] English
[36:50] Okay that's that's what it is now listen
[36:54] he
[36:55] says and I believe that in there that
[36:58] that when God created
[37:01] man he started reflecting the little
[37:05] things like
[37:09] animals and what he created afterward
[37:12] made something
[37:14] different and that's how he did
[37:18] it according to what the Bible
[37:21] says he created the the
[37:24] the and and and the life
[37:28] and then he made
[37:31] man and then the last thing that ever
[37:33] come from
[37:35] Earth in the form of creation was a
[37:42] man nothing higher ever
[37:46] come in all the
[37:49] creation there has never been anything
[37:51] higher than
[37:54] that so that the Way You Are nothing can
[37:58] bu your value is the value of
[38:02] God when Lucifer
[38:04] fell God did not
[38:07] move but when man
[38:10] fell the Lord did not stay stand
[38:15] still why it's because man is the
[38:18] perfect part
[38:20] of man is what makes God
[38:24] God so that that's why
[38:28] he took everything he
[38:30] created and he put it under the feet
[38:33] of he knows the value of
[38:37] man God knows your
[38:40] value don't ever underestimate
[38:44] yourself don't ever neglect
[38:47] yourself don't ever find yourself
[38:51] useless because I'll tell you
[38:53] tonight that you are the true one
[38:57] you are the
[38:59] authentic you are the
[39:02] original God will never
[39:06] repace because there will never be
[39:08] anybody like
[39:10] you there will never be two persons like
[39:14] you you are
[39:17] unique you are the true
[39:19] one the only you is
[39:24] you no one will ever take you your place
[39:27] hallelujah
[39:28] hallelujah so when God created
[39:33] man he saw that there was nothing higher
[39:35] than
[39:37] that now the prophet says because
[39:41] why it was a perfect
[39:46] reflection of the highest in
[39:50] heaven which God is a
[39:53] [Applause]
[39:54] man so when God created man when he
[39:58] created
[39:59] you and when he saw man God stopped
[40:04] there because
[40:06] man was the
[40:08] reflection perfect
[40:11] reflection of what was the
[40:14] highest so God is a
[40:17] man when you go in
[40:20] heaven you find the most exellent thing
[40:22] is God when you come down the thing the
[40:27] most thing is
[40:30] man so that means that you are so
[40:33] important important in this
[40:36] earth that nothing can ever take your
[40:39] [Applause]
[40:42] place the prophet will tell
[40:45] you that you are intelligent like
[40:49] God so you can never
[40:53] fail you have the ability in you to
[40:55] never fail
[40:59] because you are exactly like God
[41:04] is
[41:05] said so speaks everybody pays attention
[41:11] he says and God is a
[41:14] man
[41:16] see God is a
[41:18] man so therefore it proves
[41:22] it and when God came down to dwell Among
[41:25] Us
[41:27] he was a
[41:29] man it was not an
[41:32] angel because God is a
[41:34] man
[41:37] see
[41:38] a
[41:41] a so it shows
[41:44] that the
[41:46] Perfection of
[41:49] evolution was
[41:51] God which is a
[41:55] man I got my
[41:58] inspiration so the Perfection of the
[42:01] evolution is a
[42:03] man and that man is a
[42:06] God so that means god
[42:09] evolved he started with the
[42:11] animals he looks at the lion then he
[42:14] says no it's not like
[42:16] that then he levels
[42:19] up he brings the
[42:22] trees he looks at the beauty of the
[42:24] trees in
[42:25] he then he levels
[42:27] his he evolves he
[42:30] creates the Sun and no that's not what
[42:33] I'm looking
[42:34] for God was also
[42:37] evolving in his EV so one
[42:41] day the sixth day he
[42:45] said let us make mad in our image and
[42:48] when he looks at
[42:50] man God said I got I will stop right
[42:55] here the thing I was looking
[42:58] for so after the creation of God never
[43:02] created again why because
[43:07] man
[43:10] was was the final knowledge of
[43:14] God you are the final knowledge of
[43:17] God there is nothing greater than
[43:21] you so that
[43:24] when God was
[43:27] obligated to redeem
[43:29] man when man
[43:32] fa God was
[43:34] obligated now
[43:36] imagine when
[43:39] man
[43:41] says that Gabriel came down he could he
[43:45] told he could have told let me come down
[43:49] let me go down to
[43:51] F now God said this for this
[43:54] matter that's it's not it's not
[43:58] your look at that man really
[44:01] well how is he
[44:04] created it was the
[44:06] deity it was God in in
[44:09] the now to save him he had to be
[44:13] God so that's why God created
[44:18] himself in the image of
[44:20] man to save
[44:22] man because man a man is a God
[44:26] you are a little
[44:29] God tell your
[44:32] neighbor tell your neighbor you are the
[44:34] Perfection tell your neighbor you are
[44:37] the
[44:39] Perfection of the evolution of
[44:42] [Applause]
[44:44] God yes
[44:46] hallu you're you're not just
[44:49] anybody when you walk on
[44:52] earth you're boosting your chest
[44:57] don't look at your condition or your
[44:58] social condition
[45:00] no even God in the
[45:04] human there was a time where he didn't
[45:06] have a place to
[45:11] sleep of the heavens and earth in a
[45:14] man there was a
[45:16] time there will be a time where the in
[45:19] you will take its
[45:21] place and that at that time you'll see
[45:24] who you really are so don't ever
[45:27] neglect because just because of just
[45:30] because of who you are amen
[45:35] amen you are the
[45:37] Perfection of the evolution of
[45:40] [Music]
[45:43] God you are the final knowledge of
[45:49] God everything you
[45:52] see for you
[45:54] who
[45:56] you see the the the evolution of science
[45:58] who's doing it they're not
[46:02] Angels Humans Beings who human beings
[46:05] were doing
[46:08] this if men don't do anything nothing's
[46:11] going to be
[46:12] [Applause]
[46:13] done because man is the
[46:17] master even in his Fallen
[46:21] State still the master of
[46:24] everything
[46:26] someone who's filled with the Holy
[46:30] Ghost now at that time you
[46:35] become you can face any situation at
[46:37] that
[46:38] time hallelujah
[46:42] hallelujah now
[46:45] listen sermon the power of
[46:51] transformation preach October 31st

[46:59] paragraph
[47:08] 57 that's the way God did about the
[47:12] world he worked it was in his
[47:16] mind and if you
[47:20] notice it come like by
[47:24] evolution
[47:26] like he was learning more all the
[47:29] time making something greater and
[47:33] greater let the fish
[47:36] be then he looks at the fish he's
[47:40] like I have to evolve
[47:45] again now he was doing things as if as
[47:48] if he was
[47:49] learning he he wanted something
[47:51] hallelujah
[47:53] hallelujah he was going greater and
[47:56] greater
[47:58] see he was above it
[48:02] all just let
[48:05] it evolute up to that you
[48:10] see everything he begin to bring upon
[48:12] the Earth from boty
[48:15] life and
[48:17] fish and so
[48:19] forth it come on into Birds and the
[48:23] animals and then something
[48:26] and then
[48:28] something in his own
[48:30] image a
[48:34] man and stop there
[48:38] see because it was up to his
[48:42] Perfection what he wanted hallelujah
[48:46] hallelujah whether you're whether you be
[48:49] tall
[48:53] whether that's what he wanted
[48:58] don't ever imitate
[49:00] somebody don't ever change the
[49:02] color be who you
[49:05] are you are the flower that God
[49:08] want that's how he wanted to see
[49:11] you he loves you
[49:14] like will never be to like you if
[49:21] you're to
[49:23] see he's happy
[49:27] this is why how I wanted it
[49:30] to because you are his
[49:33] Perfection amen
[49:36] amen he never regrets
[49:39] anything what he makes of
[49:41] you that's what he saw as the best thing
[49:44] that he could hallelujah
[49:47] hallelujah because
[49:49] after he never created
[49:52] [Applause]
[49:53] again God came to to
[49:57] save he will never take anybody else to
[50:01] put him in your place it's always
[50:05] you that he will
[50:07] transform because you are the one wh
[50:10] whom he hallelujah
[50:12] hallelujah the man is that
[50:15] Perfection now the problem is here the
[50:20] problem that's where science troubled us
[50:23] now listen to what brother R say
[50:28] resurrection of Lazarus paragraph
[50:32] 35 preach in
[50:35] uh paragraph
[50:38] 35 July 29th 1956 yeah
[50:44] okay go ahead
[50:47] don't 35
[50:49] yeah
[50:51] okay mhm
[50:54] exact
[50:57] and there's where science gets mixed up
[51:00] they don't understand anything they say
[51:04] no man is not
[51:07] Perfection they said man is not
[51:11] God they said man is not the final
[51:14] knowledge of God
[51:17] why might give him a hand like a
[51:24] monkey a person who has a hand like a
[51:27] monkey can
[51:32] say he might give him a face like a
[51:38] chimpanzees he might give him a foot
[51:40] like a
[51:43] bear so sometimes when they look at you
[51:45] they might say you don't have a
[51:49] form but God put a soul in a man
[51:53] hallelujah hallelujah
[51:56] this white
[51:59] cloud
[52:03] deity came down not in in the
[52:06] animal but in the
[52:09] man that thing that
[52:13] has like
[52:17] a
[52:19] like be careful with that person inside
[52:23] that person there is a sword
[52:26] that
[52:27] soul is a
[52:30] white is the de
[52:33] that it's it's a it's a it's a hall of
[52:37] fire so that man
[52:40] is do things like God
[52:44] did he can speak things into
[52:49] existence he can declare things and
[52:52] things will
[52:53] happen because inside of him
[52:56] there is
[52:57] something God
[53:02] himself now if they want to go back and
[53:04] dig up some of some old bones let them
[53:06] dig up as many as they want
[53:08] to all the that doesn't have a thing to
[53:12] do on bearing of the word of
[53:14] God then there is
[53:17] here and now the man
[53:21] sin and when he took the
[53:24] creat
[53:27] he put him into a form that that that
[53:29] that gets science mixed up but now that
[53:32] that
[53:33] Divine in this body that get science
[53:36] mixed up that man
[53:38] fell and when he
[53:41] sinned and
[53:43] fell now listen my
[53:46] beloved then that little clown in
[53:49] there became
[53:52] mared and became black
[53:57] that cloud did not live
[54:01] man but it was it was
[54:04] damaged it was
[54:08] darkened so now that deity is still in
[54:11] man but it was darkened by
[54:15] sin
[54:19] So Adam fell as a
[54:22] God and he never changed into a
[54:28] demon despite that he was still a Son of
[54:32] God he has never been a
[54:36] demon god never baptized him with
[54:39] another
[54:40] name but when Lucifer fell and when
[54:44] God they gave him a new
[54:47] name they gave him
[54:49] the the
[54:51] dragon but when man
[54:54] fa know how God called him he called him
[54:57] Adam Adam where are
[55:00] you it was the same
[55:03] name no matter your
[55:05] failes no matter
[55:07] your God knows who you
[55:10] are he will work to redeem
[55:13] you he will work to bring you
[55:17] back someone clap clap his hands for the
[55:23] Lord s
[55:26] that cloud was
[55:27] mared but was never taken
[55:30] away it was
[55:34] darkened the darkness came and covered
[55:37] the
[55:39] deity so the god of now says what am I
[55:42] going to
[55:45] do no one can take his
[55:49] place no one can redeem this
[55:52] man because he's higher than anything
[55:58] if I Even If I multiply the sun Mo and
[56:01] everything it will never measure up to
[56:05] him because he's the master of all
[56:09] that so to save man you need someone
[56:12] bigger
[56:15] than that's why God looked he couldn't
[56:17] even find the
[56:19] prophet no prophets
[56:22] could Adam himself could not even
[56:27] while he was created
[56:29] with but he couldn't save
[56:32] himself saw the other ones that came
[56:34] through
[56:36] a no one until brother bre amen
[56:40] amen so when God
[56:43] looked time from the beginning to the
[56:46] end there was no one then he take he
[56:49] makes I
[56:51] will because he's my image because he's
[56:55] God so I God I will
[56:59] go so two God made up in the mountain in
[57:04] the mountain of c one was down here one
[57:08] was on the
[57:10] mountain hallelujah
[57:13] hallelujah so you have value you are
[57:17] valuable you are valuable don't neglect
[57:21] yourself no one could save you not even
[57:24] Moses
[57:25] not
[57:28] even not even
[57:32] brother upop all the angels and no one
[57:34] could save
[57:36] you your value is the value of
[57:40] God God looked at Jesus
[57:42] Christ who was his own body God looked
[57:46] at you then he
[57:48] says I'm going to leave Jesus Christ I'm
[57:52] going to get you because he knew
[57:55] that Jesus Christ had the power to give
[57:58] his life and to take it
[58:01] back so even if he go to he can get out
[58:05] so he went to hell so you could get up
[58:09] so that
[58:11] he and you will live together
[58:15] eternally you are
[58:17] valuable
[58:20] hey your value is even the blood of God
[58:25] don't ever underestimate
[58:27] yourself because of
[58:30] you God made a new
[58:38] creation despite saying that everything
[58:41] was of our falling God made a new
[58:45] creation what value do you
[58:49] have amen
[58:51] amen now listen he says
[58:55] and and then the
[58:59] logos came
[59:01] down and was made
[59:04] flesh and dwelt among us to redeem us or
[59:09] to redeem this man back to the love of
[59:12] the
[59:13] father and when we're talking about this
[59:15] man that's you it's
[59:20] me and he came he came in by the baptism
[59:23] of the Holy Spirit
[59:25] and chased sin out of
[59:29] the and brings men back again in in
[59:32] fellowship with God so he
[59:36] died so that the the the the baptism of
[59:40] fire come down and break down this
[59:44] Darkness so that the soul of man that
[59:47] was the light that was the
[59:51] man that was the the that was the White
[59:56] Cloud the soul of that was the
[59:59] deity got into
[1:00:02] action so if God gives you the Holy
[1:00:05] Ghost I will tell you one thing you
[1:00:09] become you are that little
[1:00:11] creature you can speak like
[1:00:14] him and in the same

[1:00:30] walk
[1:00:32] you you
[1:00:33] walk you walk upon you walk upon nothing
[1:00:38] can stop because in this
[1:00:41] time God has
[1:00:43] proved that everything is possible and
[1:00:46] that everything
[1:00:49] is where there is no solution there is a
[1:00:51] solution where there is no way there is
[1:00:53] a way
[1:00:55] when it's finished is not
[1:00:57] finished when it finished it
[1:00:59] begins when it's blocked it
[1:01:02] opens where finished it
[1:01:06] start we have the
[1:01:09] omnipotence because the
[1:01:12] miraculous came to take the
[1:01:14] control of his
[1:01:19] little manifest his grace amen

[1:02:32] same but we know who we
[1:02:35] are we're not just
[1:02:39] anybody we don't we don't plead God to
[1:02:41] be saved no no we didn't look for
[1:02:47] it he searched for
[1:02:49] us because he knew who we
[1:02:52] are without us because he's

[1:03:03] son and daughters of
[1:03:06] God you are you have in your
[1:03:09] hands now

[1:04:24] they call
[1:04:26] him when he
[1:04:28] starting but when he
[1:04:30] grows he becomes
[1:04:34] a is a little
[1:04:37] duck and the the small version of a
[1:04:41] God is
[1:04:43] God if we
[1:04:46] become de
[1:04:50] dwells then you talk about blind eyes
[1:04:52] being open
[1:04:57] they said nothing impossible to
[1:04:59] God so that's what people
[1:05:01] say nothing is impossible to
[1:05:04] God God
[1:05:07] said nothing
[1:05:09] impossible with
[1:05:10] you if you

[1:08:06] 1960 paragraph
[1:08:09] 33 blessed be the name of the
[1:08:17] Lord as my brother's looking I'm going
[1:08:19] to drink a little bit of
[1:08:22] water this is the thing here is the
[1:08:27] thing man in the
[1:08:31] beginning when God made
[1:08:35] him he didn't make
[1:08:38] him to be
[1:08:45] doctored that's
[1:08:48] you so the doctors have to stop eating
[1:08:51] up your
[1:08:52] money now every time you go to the
[1:08:55] hospital that's not a good
[1:09:01] position he didn't create him to be
[1:09:06] doctored he had his own doctoring in
[1:09:12] him everything was in
[1:09:15] him he was
[1:09:19] equipped he was a unit of his
[1:09:22] own man is Hospital himself so when you
[1:09:27] walk in
[1:09:28] you there is there
[1:09:31] is there is there is All Med there is do
[1:09:36] the medicines there's all those
[1:09:38] medicines in
[1:09:39] you so you can regenerate
[1:09:43] yourself that's who you
[1:09:46] [Music]
[1:09:48] are then healing does not come from any
[1:09:51] outside
[1:09:52] resource it has to come from
[1:09:55] the so that's why there is no preacher
[1:09:58] that
[1:09:59] heals there is no prophets that
[1:10:02] heals not even God
[1:10:04] himself because Jesus saying your
[1:10:08] faith your faith has healed your faith
[1:10:12] has
[1:10:12] healed because it's in
[1:10:15] man when you go to prer because you
[1:10:19] believe that if he speak you're going to
[1:10:21] be
[1:10:22] healed but that's is in
[1:10:27] you we're just like the
[1:10:31] charger the elements that charge the
[1:10:34] battery is in the B when you're
[1:10:37] weak they charge you up with the
[1:10:40] preaching but the
[1:10:42] blessings healing is in you deliv is
[1:10:46] in your house is in your wife is in you
[1:10:51] your children are in you your goodness
[1:10:55] is you are the prophets of your own
[1:10:59] life that's why Jesus
[1:11:03] said
[1:11:08] is our
[1:11:11] confession the power of life and of
[1:11:14] death is where in the
[1:11:17] tongue you want to have life start
[1:11:21] confessing it you want to have good
[1:11:24] speak of
[1:11:26] good you want to have
[1:11:31] intell confess it every
[1:11:34] day the atmosphere will and the thing
[1:11:38] will
[1:11:39] happen because you are a God hallelujah
[1:11:44] [Music]
[1:11:48] hallelujah paragraph

[1:11:52] same man in the
[1:11:54] beginning when he was made a man is

[1:12:49] right you don't have the right

[1:20:17] this I was going to swallow that but let
[1:20:21] me just say this is
[1:20:23] brand because what he's going to say is
[1:20:25] like a
[1:20:26] bomb
[1:20:28] man is an
[1:20:35] omnipotent I thought you were going to
[1:20:37] say Amen because that's you you are that
[1:20:41] man you confess you become what you
[1:20:45] confess man is
[1:20:48] omn he says you don't believe

[1:20:56] is a man fully surrendered to God
[1:21:01] is did not he said in
[1:21:04] Mark

[1:21:09] they'll come to
[1:21:11] pass you can have what
[1:21:16] said now this is where it makes
[1:21:19] me this is where it creates a miracle in
[1:21:22] human life
[1:21:23] what
[1:21:25] happens when two omn
[1:21:28] poent
[1:21:30] meet when
[1:21:33] God comes
[1:21:35] together in the
[1:21:39] two something got to
[1:21:42] shake that's why in this end
[1:21:46] time a prophet preached
[1:21:49] this he preached the invisible
[1:21:53] of the
[1:21:54] the and of the
[1:21:57] Earthly so it's the meeting the
[1:22:01] meeting the head that comes down that
[1:22:05] comes to attach to the
[1:22:07] body and when the two meet
[1:22:11] up something must
[1:22:14] happen Don't Be Afraid something is
[1:22:17] going something will happen in your
[1:22:20] life that God will give it
[1:22:25] whatever you ask with this
[1:22:27] power the creative power
[1:22:31] of knowing that he's promised
[1:22:34] it and he said it in his
[1:22:37] words creates a
[1:22:40] power that goes out
[1:22:43] y bring things to have to
[1:22:46] pass things that is
[1:22:49] not and makes them as though they are
[1:22:54] because two
[1:22:56] omnipotent
[1:22:58] have because Powers
[1:23:03] have that's his
[1:23:06] their oh isn't
[1:23:09] it that's your position
