[24:27] Avianca story scar
[24:32] I was sitting over there listening to
[25:32] brother Marshall have y'all seen the
[25:36] great improvement
[25:38] [Laughter]
[25:39] you're getting better brother you
[25:42] getting better now we appreciate you
[25:44] thank God for His grace amen
[25:47] it's so amazing God is so good to us
[25:52] I appreciate brother Marshall for his
[25:54] faithfulness God is so good to us as we
[26:04] stand let us go right into the Word of
[26:06] God
[26:13] the Lord Jesus where would we be we're
[26:18] going to start right at Jeremiah 15 5
[26:21] through 7 want to finish up at the Lord
[26:28] tarry if not were gone but you know we
[26:31] look we're living in such a time that
[26:33] that I I know the Word of God is trying
[26:37] to get our attention I love what brother
[26:41] Troy has said to me in the office he
[26:43] said they wouldn't listen to Jeremiah
[26:46] but God gave him an audience anyway he
[26:50] didn't say that like that but I thought
[26:52] about us there's somebody that's going
[26:54] to hear the word and there's somebody
[26:57] that's going to always be a doer of the
[26:59] word and you know what we can't do it
[27:03] without him just can't do it
[27:09] they couldn't perform the law and
[27:12] neither can we perform God's will under
[27:15] grace without His grace without him
[27:20] being here but I really believe that God
[27:26] has a word for us and I come
[27:32] poke out in my prayer I wish everybody
[27:36] could feel the pain that our brother
[27:38] Keith was speaking of when we were
[27:39] praying but there are so many of us
[27:42] who've never gone to Calvary we don't
[27:45] even know what the pain was alike
[27:47] we can't moan with him we can't groan
[27:49] with him we can't enter into his
[27:51] suffering like like like Paul said I
[27:55] want to enter into his suffering I want
[27:58] to know him in the power of his
[27:59] resurrection but there are so many
[28:01] people who have never gone the Kabri
[28:03] they've never really sat down or kneel
[28:05] down and says lord I surrender my life
[28:07] to you they have not even come to the
[28:09] point of a sinner's prayer because
[28:11] everybody jumps that and goes to believe
[28:15] God's in a prophet and you see that's
[28:20] where the in danger that's where Satan
[28:22] has crept in because people have never
[28:25] done Romans 9 remembers 10 you know if
[28:29] you confess the Lord Jesus Christ with
[28:30] your mouth and believe in your heart you
[28:33] see that confession is brought into
[28:34] salvation and many people have not even
[28:36] gone there so your heart your heart my
[28:41] heart is quite heavy right now it's just
[28:43] really heavy because I believe that
[28:46] we're closer to God's coming then most
[28:49] people can see the world is truly
[28:53] falling apart I mean it's just things
[28:58] happening now that just you know
[29:00] sinkholes fires floods and they just
[29:04] constantly talking about this saying
[29:06] andreas fault and how it could happen
[29:09] anytime we see the the the spirit of
[29:13] destruction on our world you know among
[29:16] our leaders you know now now the guy
[29:21] over there in France done jumped into it
[29:23] and when you when you think about how
[29:26] God has placed this spirit of war and
[29:29] destruction on them you know that's the
[29:31] scripture being fulfilled and the only
[29:35] people who will be able to overcome or
[29:38] make a raft as those who can number
[29:40] overcome this age Jeremiah 15 5 through
[29:45] 7
[29:46] I know many people may even think we're
[29:49] brother books
[29:50] he's not even preaching the message but
[29:52] I tell you the truth I am preaching the
[29:55] message God knows I'm preaching the
[29:58] message but we've had it so sweet for so
[30:02] many years and no matter how much
[30:04] kindness God has given toward us because
[30:07] you know the Bible said the kindness of
[30:08] God should lead men bring us to
[30:13] repentance but oftentimes when God gives
[30:17] us so much the Bible tells us we act
[30:20] like Israel God says when I found you I
[30:22] found you in your blood you were still
[30:25] connected to your mother the neighbor
[30:27] cord had not even been cut but said I
[30:30] blessed you and I grew you up and I
[30:31] brought you into my own house and once
[30:34] you became wealthy and rich
[30:36] you kicked against me and I think that's
[30:39] what happening to a lot of the people in
[30:41] our day beginning at the fifth verse for
[30:46] who shall have pity upon the Oh
[30:47] Jerusalem or who shall be mouldy or who
[30:51] shall go aside to ask how thou doest
[30:55] thou has forsaken me said the Lord thou
[30:58] art going backward therefore will I
[31:00] stretch out my hand against thee and
[31:03] destroyed thee I am weary with repenting
[31:07] that's God speaking and our fan be with
[31:11] a fan in the gates of the land and I
[31:13] will be read them of children I will
[31:16] destroy my people since they returned
[31:18] not from their ways let us pray father
[31:23] we thank you for your grace and your
[31:25] mercy we thank you for being so good to
[31:28] us
[31:28] you've been better to us and we have
[31:30] been to ourselves and lord I pray this
[31:33] evening that you let your grace and
[31:35] mercy continue with us Lord we realize
[31:38] that we cannot make this journey of
[31:40] ourselves we need you we want you and
[31:43] Lord we want to live this life
[31:46] o God that you have appointed us to live
[31:48] so let your perfect will be done in our
[31:50] lives in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[31:53] amen
[31:53] you may be seated I also wanted to
[31:56] correct something I want to say by God's
[32:00] race that you know when brother Branham
[32:01] was here on the earth he was definitely
[32:04] the prophet of God Malachi 4 but you
[32:09] know our brother brother Lu thought
[32:12] brother Skaggs when he was here about
[32:15] the woman who battled glass fiend if
[32:20] anybody blaspheming the Holy Ghost I
[32:22] don't care how great a preacher he is
[32:24] there's no way a prophet can forgive you
[32:28] the Word of God said if you speak one
[32:31] word against the Holy Ghost
[32:34] it cannot be forgiven
[32:36] now you can blaspheme the prophet
[32:39] without blaspheming the Holy Ghost just
[32:42] like you can blaspheme me without
[32:45] blaspheming the Holy Ghost but once you
[32:48] blaspheme the Holy Ghost it's done no
[32:53] prophet can forgive you that's not even
[32:56] in the scripture so I just want to say
[32:59] that I just want to also say by God's
[33:01] grace that all is well sometimes we get
[33:05] it a little mixed up a little bit and I
[33:08] want to say by God's grace that we we
[33:12] love our brother Skaggs I'm not saying
[33:13] this to down him I just know that we'll
[33:16] have him again I'll make mistakes as
[33:19] well so we want to say by God's grace to
[33:23] that you and I must understand that if
[33:28] he said to the woman you have not or you
[33:30] did not blaspheme that was the Holy
[33:33] Ghost speaking
[33:34] otherwise the baby would not have been
[33:36] healed so that you understand that's
[33:40] let's keep our word the word in
[33:42] perspective so that will will will
[33:45] please God amen this is so we look at a
[33:49] time and we feel that we are in a time
[33:53] of we are where we ought to be more
[33:55] cautious cautious amen because the
[34:02] probably God preached a message flashing
[34:07] red lights of his coming we
[34:12] oh that even in the traffic lights when
[34:14] we have a yellow light that means
[34:15] cautious but when it's red it's
[34:18] dangerous it means to stop and if you
[34:22] ignore that red light is a possibility a
[34:26] great possibility that you will come to
[34:30] a collision that collision may even be
[34:34] fatal because you fail to stop red light
[34:39] doesn't necessarily means yield unless
[34:42] it is flashing sometimes you have to
[34:44] stop and look
[34:46] but then continue to go we are in a time
[34:51] where we see that everything is falling
[34:54] apart you're spiritually blind if you
[34:57] can't see this everything nobody knows
[35:01] the direction where to go those who call
[35:07] them are themselves our leaders of
[35:11] fussing and fighting the houses are
[35:13] divided every nation everywhere you go
[35:16] they're divided Satan is trying his best
[35:20] to divide the church divide the people
[35:26] divide families and all of this believe
[35:31] it or not is the judgment of the Lord
[35:33] sometimes we feel like the judgment of
[35:36] the Lord is when a tornado comes or
[35:38] hurricane come or bomb drop but the
[35:44] judgment of the Lord also can be in the
[35:47] form of division confusion it can be in
[35:53] the form of sickness famine floods you
[36:00] name it because you you must realize
[36:04] that God is not the one who devised the
[36:08] house now Jesus tell us that when he
[36:12] should come houses will be divided but
[36:15] understand he's not bringing the
[36:16] division it is Satan who's bringing
[36:19] division mother against daughter
[36:22] father's are get sons and
[36:25] see that happening right now even among
[36:27] ourselves we see Satan coming in and out
[36:33] at will because we have let down the
[36:38] bars we no longer focus on what we have
[36:43] been called to do when I was preaching
[36:46] this morning it was not just about you
[36:48] it was about me to the Word of God comes
[36:52] and it goes both ways but thank God that
[36:56] we have a solution to the problem we're
[37:00] not in a place where we are in a state
[37:02] of confusion we we are not children of
[37:05] the darkness
[37:06] we're children of the light and because
[37:09] we have a prophet we can see the
[37:13] adversary and his next move the Word of
[37:16] God is sure and I believe that we are
[37:20] called Lady Grace now being called Lady
[37:24] Grace doesn't mean you merited anything
[37:27] it means that God had faith on you you
[37:32] look at this thing and you said well all
[37:33] Brotherhood's what are you saying
[37:35] I say it like this if Joshua went down
[37:43] to Jericho and if he had given rehab
[37:47] instructions in which he did if Rahab
[37:51] and her household had not followed the
[37:55] instructions that Joshua gave she would
[38:01] have been counted among those that were
[38:04] slaughtered even those spies says if you
[38:08] don't put the scarlet ribbon on the
[38:11] outside we are not responsible hello and
[38:16] God is saying the same thing if the
[38:19] token is not on display then I am NOT
[38:23] responsible but because I gave you the
[38:27] instructions in this mess
[38:33] touken he said what we see the great in
[38:38] times the flashing red lights everywhere
[38:42] upon nature we see nature flashing the
[38:46] light the time is at hand we see it upon
[38:49] the church flashing the light she is
[38:52] condemned the time is at hand she is in
[38:56] the world we see it upon the skies upon
[39:00] the sea upon the nations upon everything
[39:03] in the Sun Moon Stars signs so we see
[39:09] all of these things we see among the
[39:13] message as I said how people are
[39:16] becoming so starchy now look how God
[39:20] moved this morning
[39:21] and yet look who all returned maybe some
[39:27] have legitimate excuses but I know some
[39:31] do not quite because the many did not
[39:36] hear him even though God was here this
[39:38] morning
[39:40] God's program can never change and God
[39:44] is not gonna be in this word for you and
[39:46] me God's Word is God's Word and we all
[39:51] will be judged by that word who was
[39:53] Jesus Christ himself God doesn't call
[39:57] man to judgment without first warning
[40:01] him God never seen never even brings
[40:05] judgment upon the earth without first
[40:08] giving the people a warning god never
[40:10] does nothing without declaring it first
[40:14] what he's going to do i will we aware
[40:18] that God could have just destroyed the
[40:20] world he could have just allowed a flood
[40:22] amen to come in but God had a warning he
[40:26] had a flashing red light he had a time
[40:30] when he was saying enough is enough and
[40:35] God and as individuals God will deal
[40:38] with us the same way I don't know about
[40:40] you but I can remember the time when I
[40:43] first got saved the Holy Spirit told me
[40:45] this
[40:46] is your last time I didn't know where
[40:51] the last time was but somehow I
[40:53] understood he wasn't gonna call me to be
[40:56] a Christian anymore
[40:58] and I repented and became a Christian so
[41:04] even with me God had a last time but I
[41:11] heard his cry and I say this by the
[41:16] grace of God God has no respect a person
[41:20] and because we declare ourselves bride
[41:24] doesn't make us bride what makes us
[41:28] bride is God
[41:29] vindication it's when God vindicates who
[41:34] you are that right even when Jesus came
[41:38] they wanted to know who he was but you
[41:41] see those who were looking for him knew
[41:44] who he was
[41:45] God vindicates right there at the well
[41:48] when the woman met him and he told her
[41:52] go get your husband she says I have none
[41:55] oh yes you do say you got five and the
[41:58] one that you with is not yours
[42:00] he said all she said to him we know when
[42:04] the Messiah should come he should tell
[42:07] us these things that was just one of the
[42:10] vindications now the vindication when
[42:14] Nicodemus came to him and says rabbi we
[42:18] know that you are teacher from God
[42:20] coz no man can do these things except
[42:23] God be with him that was another
[42:26] vindication of who he was hallelujah
[42:29] a man when he saw Philip underneath the
[42:33] tree and Philip says he said talk about
[42:37] a man without godliness Lord how do you
[42:40] know me
[42:41] say I saw you when you were under the
[42:44] sycamore tree hallelujah
[42:46] so you see that's another vindication he
[42:49] was a messiah any years today that's
[42:53] what we must have in our lives
[42:56] vindication that the Christ that died
[42:59] 2000
[43:00] ago and raised from the dead is now
[43:03] living in you and me it's not enough
[43:12] invested oh I'm a Christian because they
[43:13] can shout oh I'm a pretty Christian
[43:15] because they can speak in tongues I've
[43:17] seen people bombed here makeup and
[43:19] everything else pants all kind of stuff
[43:21] and you mean to tell me you've got all
[43:22] that Holy Ghost and he won't even tell
[43:24] you that what you're doing is wrong when
[43:29] God would take some naked a Africa's
[43:33] Holy Ghost failed and what did they do
[43:35] they ran and got him clothing him that
[43:39] was the real Holy Ghost because the real
[43:42] Holy Ghost will teach you when no man is
[43:47] around he'll teach you and guide you
[43:49] into all truth
[43:51] hallelujah so you and I must realize
[43:55] amen God could never bring that
[43:58] judgement without first warning of
[44:00] people and he'll give people a choice
[44:06] you can do wrong or you can do right
[44:09] God can never change his nature his
[44:12] program can never change from what he
[44:15] started with because he's infinite in
[44:17] his program and his ideas are all
[44:20] perfect so if he would change it that
[44:24] would show that he has had learned more
[44:28] so being evident he cannot learn more
[44:32] his first decision is always perfect and
[44:35] there's nothing can ever change its
[44:38] hallelujah so you say what do you mean
[44:41] God cannot change the statue of a
[44:43] perfect man not for you nor for me God
[44:47] can he's not giving some kind of curve
[44:50] where you going to make a hundred
[44:52] percent you've got to make a hundred
[44:55] percent but he's willing to help us make
[45:01] it
[45:06] fail to see and what people this morning
[45:08] failed to see is that God is in this
[45:10] room
[45:12] you said prove it there are television
[45:17] waves gone through this room right now
[45:19] can you see them but they're here
[45:23] they're radio waves going through this
[45:26] room right now can you hear them no were
[45:31] they going right through this room is
[45:34] that Alright
[45:35] amen let me put it with God scripture
[45:38] God says he's in all above all and
[45:41] through all that means God flows right
[45:45] through you
[45:47] he's everywhere whether you see him or
[45:51] not he's here the promise described is
[45:57] like this in harvest he said there'll be
[46:00] times that colors will flow right
[46:02] through the air is here right now
[46:05] and they turn on a little button and
[46:07] around the world you'll see people
[46:09] moving and things right on the scene oh
[46:12] I got a good message for this community
[46:15] but I want to say by God's grace you and
[46:18] I must understand whether we can feel
[46:21] taste see hear or smell him he's here
[46:26] and there is no way of getting around
[46:29] him he sees your thoughts he hears your
[46:33] thoughts he understand your moves he
[46:35] knows what you're thinking he knows
[46:38] what's in your heart and every one even
[46:40] this morning where they judged it to be
[46:42] brother Brooks or judged it to be
[46:44] brother God I mean God amen God saw that
[46:47] I really believe that the most messages
[46:52] that are we've been preaching for the
[46:54] Skaggs brother toy myself and others has
[47:00] been direct from the throne of God and
[47:03] if you really believe that God has been
[47:06] talking then we need to hear what he's
[47:08] saying
[47:08] and repent how are we going to do this
[47:15] thing if we don't get God in how
[47:20] if the Holy Ghost doesn't come in this
[47:22] place how are we going to do it even the
[47:27] first disciples could not produce
[47:30] Pentecost without the Holy Ghost they
[47:34] had been with him three and a half years
[47:36] casting out Devils preaching the gospel
[47:39] but now God has a greater move coming
[47:42] and he said go ye there and tarry in
[47:45] Jerusalem the brother Balaam said when
[47:47] they were in the upper room they were
[47:48] scared they were afraid they didn't have
[47:52] the power as of yet and they were afraid
[47:56] because here Jesus was crucified
[47:58] y'all don't believe it Oster truth Peter
[48:01] was afraid when they crucified Him and
[48:03] there was fear mobsters who wanted to
[48:06] kill Christians they went into the upper
[48:11] room and hid there and God met him in
[48:14] their hiding place he just told him to
[48:17] go to Jerusalem he didn't say go to the
[48:19] upper room they went to the upper room
[48:21] and God met him there but it was
[48:24] intentional God knew exactly where they
[48:26] were going but how we're gonna do it
[48:32] when God says going to all the world and
[48:34] preach the gospel and these signs shall
[48:37] follow them but then says how can they
[48:40] do it with Christ absence from them how
[48:45] are you gonna do it if Christ is not
[48:48] there how can they do it when God gives
[48:51] them the promise but look God promise of
[48:55] Pentecost and when the Holy Ghost in
[48:57] person came down and took over mortal
[49:01] man's body after they had been cleared
[49:04] by the atoning of the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:06] Hey after they had been cleansed whew by
[49:14] the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:17] and the Holy Ghost took the person into
[49:20] his own control and sent him forth with
[49:24] signs and wonders and miracles of
[49:26] following God provided away they
[49:30] couldn't do it in themselves they were
[49:33] being like you and I how could they do
[49:35] it they couldn't but God provided a way
[49:39] of escape even as we preach no doubt the
[49:45] Word of God convicted us this morning
[49:47] but how can we do it without the Holy
[49:51] Ghost
[49:51] you can't good without him Israel
[49:55] couldn't do it without him you can't do
[49:57] it without him
[49:58] neither can I for the Branham couldn't
[50:00] do it without him even though he was
[50:03] born a prophet he had to have the Holy
[50:06] Ghost God had to give him the Holy Ghost
[50:10] in order for him to perform the word
[50:13] that was written of him
[50:15] Jesus had to have the Holy Ghost before
[50:20] he could do what was written of him the
[50:23] problem is not the message the problem
[50:26] is the Holy Ghost getting the Holy Ghost
[50:30] because if we get it like the Bible says
[50:33] and like the Prophet is explained to us
[50:35] to get it oh my god Oh we'll shake this
[50:40] place out
[50:42] we'll do what God wants us to do the
[50:47] thing that I love about it is I don't
[50:50] have to go out into the desert to get it
[50:52] I don't have to go nowhere I could be
[50:57] right here and God would give it to me
[51:03] he said don't they say he's out in the
[51:06] desert don't you go they said if you
[51:11] don't come out here you lost you not
[51:13] part of the bride don't you believe that
[51:16] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah is this
[51:20] okay
[51:21] see my thing is you know you know when
[51:24] if you're gonna bring somebody to a
[51:25] place where they they feel like there's
[51:27] no way out you got to find a way out for
[51:29] them now let this morning was a place
[51:32] where you could find a way out almost
[51:34] now I'm trying to tell you how to get
[51:35] out of it as you heard me say this
[51:38] morning you have to really really listen
[51:42] to those messages it's more than one
[51:44] God's provided way
[51:47] that literally tells you the way and I
[51:51] can truly say there are so many messes
[51:54] preachers who have taken us away from
[51:57] the dynamics of receiving the Holy Ghost
[52:01] everybody don't get it like everybody
[52:04] but at some point in time you got to
[52:08] connect with God is that all right
[52:13] brother Adam said is this and there's
[52:15] only one way for a baby to talk to you
[52:18] he said I I'm going everywhere and I've
[52:20] heard different dogs talking the same
[52:22] language whether they be German Shepherd
[52:26] French poodles or English Terriers they
[52:29] all speak the same language he said we
[52:33] are the only ones that's confused
[52:34] because we're falling he said babies cry
[52:38] in the same language whether their
[52:41] parents are French whether their parents
[52:43] are Africans Americans whatever they may
[52:46] be Chinese or German whatever don't make
[52:48] no difference you'll never hear a baby
[52:50] crying German they cry and they all cry
[52:54] in the same language and they get all
[52:57] all get the same response easy because
[53:00] that's God's provided way he said a
[53:03] chicken when it's coming out of a
[53:05] chicken egg he said you can't help them
[53:08] if you help I know some time y'all we
[53:11] won't eat some of us but ain't nobody to
[53:14] help you you got a crack to share
[53:16] yourself you got a breakthrough yourself
[53:20] when you break through your heart is
[53:22] strong enough to live right because if
[53:26] we help you you die and that's what we
[53:32] must understand every man must break
[53:35] through for him or herself even though
[53:39] we have great services those services
[53:43] are there to create the atmosphere for
[53:46] you that's why we can't put those babies
[53:49] in the starchy situation you can't the
[53:53] temperatures too low we had to bring the
[53:55] temperature up here we've got to bring
[53:58] in an atmosphere that's going to bring
[54:00] forth eaglets that's the word when he
[54:08] went into the upper room they thought
[54:09] the people would make fun of them they
[54:11] thought they would be this that or the
[54:14] other they had the winners all closed
[54:16] and the doors locked
[54:17] how could they do it they were they were
[54:20] cowards they had no backbone
[54:22] they had a chicken wishbone and now the
[54:25] real Holy Ghost backbone they had the
[54:27] doors lock they was afraid there was a
[54:30] shame to walk out and face the public
[54:32] how could they do it but God sent the
[54:36] Pentecost the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[54:39] they flung the windows and the doors
[54:41] open and in the street they win God
[54:44] provided it when God provides God will
[54:47] keep his word he'll make a way of escape
[54:49] he never suffer you to be tempted above
[54:52] anything that he won't make a way to
[54:55] escape for you he'll do it here we are
[54:58] we lived through the day of a disabled a
[55:01] cloudy rainy the church is half way in
[55:04] and half way out they wonder how can
[55:06] they do this and how can they do this
[55:08] they had no light but the Prophet said
[55:12] there'll be light in the evening you see
[55:15] what this message is about hey we could
[55:18] just be like everybody else think if we
[55:20] shadow we dance and obey it is alive
[55:23] we're looking for like that baby in your
[55:27] mother's womb when that baby come forth
[55:30] he's looking for a life that's going to
[55:34] sustain him in this world and we're
[55:36] looking for a life that's going to
[55:38] sustain us in the world to come we're
[55:41] not born we've already been born of this
[55:42] world but this new birth this new birth
[55:45] that
[55:46] comes with God is born into another
[55:48] world did y'all know that when you get
[55:52] the Holy Ghost you're now living in
[55:54] another world that's why all things all
[55:57] things are passed away and behold all
[56:00] things have become new
[56:01] you're living in another world
[56:04] hallelujah oh is that okay so you must
[56:08] understand we're living in a time where
[56:10] we're now battling what we call the
[56:12] Antichrist I'm not gonna be long but
[56:14] we're battling the Antichrist not out
[56:18] there the Antichrist in here people
[56:24] don't even understand sometimes they are
[56:26] when they are under the influence of the
[56:27] Antichrist and they sit right here being
[56:31] influenced by the Antichrist and then
[56:33] with Christ come they don't even
[56:35] recognize him and they don't understand
[56:39] by God's grace that you and I must come
[56:41] to a place like the prophet of God we
[56:43] must come to a place that we must be
[56:46] able to discern the difference between
[56:48] the two if God is trying to get you to
[56:52] worship and you said Oh something says
[56:55] don't worship that's Antichrist if God
[56:58] is trying to get you to say Amen and you
[57:00] don't say Amen that's Antichrist you're
[57:05] working against the anointing when God
[57:08] say surrender and you don't surrender
[57:10] that's Antichrist you understand me it's
[57:16] two spirits that works within the
[57:18] framework of the church and you're
[57:21] working with the Antichrist where cause
[57:23] of just become starchy is it know that
[57:28] you have an effect in this world and
[57:31] that world and when you and I don't come
[57:37] on one Accord like the scripture says
[57:40] hearing our said the Bible say contend
[57:42] for the faith that means you're supposed
[57:44] to come here you fight for you fight for
[57:47] the worship he's rather to be praised
[57:49] he's worthy he's honorable you and I
[57:51] need to know how
[57:53] he'll God we sing this oh he'll hairline
[57:59] of Judah
[58:00] you know when you know help me to
[58:02] recognize pronounce it shout it honor it
[58:11] yes
[58:13] tribute to the line of Judah and when we
[58:20] come not understanding that when we are
[58:23] here amen and let me tell you something
[58:25] if I'm not careful I can contribute to
[58:29] that Antichrist spirit many times a
[58:33] minute times I've come in here not
[58:35] feeling like preaching not feeling like
[58:37] worshiping not feeling like nothing and
[58:39] y'all see me act like a madman that
[58:41] means I'm pushing I'm fighting through
[58:46] it yeah because he's worthy to be
[58:50] praised yes I come in here like that
[58:54] sometime but when it seems like I'm
[58:56] overdoing it you know I'm not overdoing
[58:58] it I'm making a way for everybody else
[59:00] cuz usually got coming here and
[59:02] everything all cold I get up here and
[59:04] I'm fight for you and I expecting you to
[59:06] join me like they did David I just
[59:08] killed Goliath y'all come on John this
[59:11] thing and we must do it we must do it
[59:19] amen don't be ashame of him folks
[59:22] those people out in the club they do
[59:24] whatever they want to do they worship
[59:27] that devil
[59:28] they worship him so much they they can't
[59:31] produce no other signs so they tattoo
[59:32] themselves yes I'm not saying everything
[59:37] that's on the skin looked bad but most
[59:40] of that see the devil said God said
[59:41] don't do it
[59:42] so when they do it that's not Christ
[59:44] that Antichrist I don't care if they got
[59:47] a cross on I don't care if they got the
[59:48] face of Jesus it's wrong now everybody
[59:56] tattoo tattooed all over their faces I'm
[1:00:00] talking about in that world we're in a
[1:00:02] different world
[1:00:04] when I say thank we're in a different
[1:00:06] word weighing in that world we're in a
[1:00:08] different world I'm gonna preach on that
[1:00:11] so you and I must understand by God's
[1:00:14] grace because we are in a different
[1:00:15] world we must act differently
[1:00:18] everybody that comes to this church is
[1:00:20] not in the same kingdom
[1:00:24] hello everybody that goes to everybody
[1:00:27] else's church is not in the same kingdom
[1:00:29] there are three kinds of believers may
[1:00:32] believers believers and unbelievers the
[1:00:35] unbeliever is in his world
[1:00:37] the maple Eber is in his world and the
[1:00:40] believer is in God's world when you are
[1:00:45] believer that means you got the believer
[1:00:47] on the inside right is that what he said
[1:00:51] he told that man that man said oh if I
[1:00:53] saw you raise a man from the dead I
[1:00:55] wouldn't believe it he said because it's
[1:00:56] not given to you it's given to the
[1:00:58] believers so those who can believe God
[1:01:02] it's from a different place oh lord help
[1:01:09] me Jesus
[1:01:13] you cannot get to God except by the
[1:01:18] spirit that's what he said you cannot
[1:01:23] get to God except by the spirit there's
[1:01:26] only one way that a man can come to God
[1:01:29] and it's through the Holy Spirit jesus
[1:01:32] said no man can come to me except my
[1:01:35] father draws him and who is the father
[1:01:38] by the spirit all right you you might
[1:01:42] think Amen that it is your will
[1:01:44] no no no no no I'll tell you what your
[1:01:46] will is your will as a kind of man it's
[1:01:49] a heart like Adam no man comes to God
[1:01:54] except God draws him God draws you God
[1:01:58] drew us right and he that comes to God
[1:02:01] must believe that he is God what the man
[1:02:06] the God who created all the moon the
[1:02:09] Stars the world's and
[1:02:10] they else and he's so great but he can
[1:02:13] take himself and place him into place
[1:02:16] himself into a pinpoint place in my
[1:02:19] heart
[1:02:22] think about it the God of all universe
[1:02:25] he's living in there in a little bitty
[1:02:27] place he don't need a mansion as such
[1:02:36] but he takes a little place and oh what
[1:02:40] a mighty God we serve think about it
[1:02:45] being able to see the Antichrist being
[1:02:49] able to see men who puff themselves up
[1:02:52] see when you got the Holy Ghost you
[1:02:54] don't get bigger you get smaller
[1:02:57] you don't become great you become small
[1:03:00] God becomes everything hallelujah is
[1:03:05] that all right the greater a person
[1:03:07] become in God the smaller he or she
[1:03:10] become her character must be like his
[1:03:17] what do you mean Peter
[1:03:19] except you want let me wash your feet he
[1:03:24] went to wash Peters feet he said don't
[1:03:28] you know our Lord but take it understand
[1:03:32] what Lord is doing
[1:03:33] I'm humbling myself I'm becoming smaller
[1:03:37] than you I'm becoming you Frankie you
[1:03:41] understand me I'm washing your feet and
[1:03:48] you and I'm
[1:03:49] understand this is a battle and you're
[1:03:53] not must oh I got a quote you and I must
[1:03:56] love Provenza if we don't love uh one
[1:03:59] another he said you don't he said you
[1:04:01] still lost the only love going to heaven
[1:04:07] you don't have to love people's deeds
[1:04:11] but you got to love them was that right
[1:04:18] even Jesus said I hate the deed of the
[1:04:21] Nicolaitans he didn't even say I hate
[1:04:23] the Nicolaitans he said I hate the deeds
[1:04:28] will help us Jesus
[1:04:30] how about God joining himself -
[1:04:33] something like that
[1:04:35] irregular denominations a prostitute you
[1:04:38] think we would do it have a form of
[1:04:40] godliness but denying the power thereof
[1:04:42] and we do it
[1:04:45] whenever you think God cannot perform a
[1:04:48] miracle in your life you are denying the
[1:04:51] power when you think that God cannot
[1:04:54] heal you you are denying the power hello
[1:04:57] let me tell you something I don't care
[1:04:59] if you go by way of the doctor it's
[1:05:02] still God that heals somewhere you got
[1:05:05] to conclude God healed me if God can
[1:05:10] heal you without using the doctors he
[1:05:12] will do so you understand me you can't
[1:05:17] deny the power Oh Lord I can't seem to
[1:05:19] overcome what are you talking about if
[1:05:22] the God that created all things you mean
[1:05:25] to tell me he came overcome you can't
[1:05:27] overcome demons in your life he is the
[1:05:32] overcomer the problem is we don't go to
[1:05:34] God in prayer we go but we go and hope
[1:05:38] we gotta go and say we got to believe
[1:05:42] that he's God God is able more than able
[1:05:48] God can do it listen people of God we're
[1:05:52] getting ready to fight we getting ready
[1:05:55] to come into a squeeze and you gotta
[1:05:57] know who God is you can't come into this
[1:06:00] battle ain't men thinking that there's a
[1:06:03] there's a potential a loss or something
[1:06:06] no God is a winner
[1:06:08] God is viktoria Paul said we are more
[1:06:12] than conquerors
[1:06:13] nothing's gonna conquer me in this life
[1:06:15] nothing
[1:06:16] impulsive I will not be subject to
[1:06:19] nothing
[1:06:20] no sir if I got a problem that problem
[1:06:23] gotta go any kind of demon in my life
[1:06:27] it's got to go I might out the fight I
[1:06:29] might have to tile i'ma have to struggle
[1:06:31] some time but I'm not ELISA and you are
[1:06:35] not either and we're not going to quit
[1:06:37] until perfection is in us we are the
[1:06:40] bride of Jesus we're gonna see God
[1:06:43] workers working us we're not concerned
[1:06:45] we can't help about what other people
[1:06:48] are doing but in this fellowship if
[1:06:49] there's only three four five Amen that's
[1:06:52] gonna go into perfection we're gonna do
[1:06:54] it God is gonna hear us because we have
[1:06:58] a heart and mind to repent God we want
[1:07:01] to be right we want to do right Lord
[1:07:05] oh oh you there's so many out there
[1:07:07] among this message that I can't give an
[1:07:10] account for them but I do know that God
[1:07:13] sent me here and I believe with all my
[1:07:15] heart God has put fighting me I got some
[1:07:20] fire we gonna win we're the winners
[1:07:28] we're the winners hallelujah see we
[1:07:33] realize one thing that we must be just
[1:07:35] like him how are we gonna do without the
[1:07:40] Holy Ghost for the bandwidth of the
[1:07:43] seals he said that token message was the
[1:07:45] greatest of all his message yes hmm
[1:07:48] because that was the life of Christ
[1:07:50] remember last week I said the greatest
[1:07:53] gift that God can give you is life
[1:07:54] eternal life it's not being a lawyer
[1:07:58] teacher preacher intellectual something
[1:08:01] whatever those things are good but those
[1:08:04] things only last in this world but when
[1:08:06] God gives eternal life that's forever
[1:08:10] that's a life that you can't pay for
[1:08:14] our eye I want you to think about this
[1:08:16] for a moment the Word of God tells us
[1:08:19] according to James that our life is like
[1:08:20] a vapor it's here for a moment and it's
[1:08:25] gone I can remember when I was like that
[1:08:30] young boy young man over there we didn't
[1:08:34] know how good we had it you can have two
[1:08:39] yeah Holly had - wahala had ever put the
[1:08:42] lotion on your face right this game was
[1:08:44] so perfect you know strong you wake up
[1:08:47] in the morning you're ready to hit the
[1:08:48] road anything like a speech to call you
[1:08:53] want to want to come out where you want
[1:08:55] to come out - driveway squealing and all
[1:08:59] of a sudden that car transformed into
[1:09:02] one of them old T model Fords you know
[1:09:06] ain't nothing you can do about it is
[1:09:09] that right
[1:09:11] but you and I must realize one thing is
[1:09:15] that when God is in favor for you you
[1:09:19] still young God can make you outrun a
[1:09:25] horse or chariot y'all know what I'm
[1:09:29] going right oh man he said it's gonna
[1:09:37] rain he outran the check they don't have
[1:09:43] that in the movies do hey man paint it's
[1:09:47] a phenomenal ride it's a paradox but God
[1:09:50] did it you see so even if even even if
[1:09:54] the squeeze come on and and you you you
[1:09:56] know you and I can't run like we used to
[1:09:58] run we don't have to worry about it cuz
[1:10:02] we'll be able to step from one dimension
[1:10:03] to the other y'all believe that I
[1:10:05] believe it I believe when Jesus stepped
[1:10:08] through that door he was accepting not
[1:10:10] through the door only but from one
[1:10:11] dimension to another well try again if
[1:10:18] you don't believe is a it's a
[1:10:20] dimensional thing try walking through
[1:10:23] that wall
[1:10:26] it is what it is right so you and I we
[1:10:30] that's why the Bible says fear not but
[1:10:34] you see the only way you can have that
[1:10:36] fear not is with perfect love comes in
[1:10:39] and casts out fear
[1:10:41] see when the Holy Ghost comes in it
[1:10:44] casts out fear perfect love casts out
[1:10:48] fear we don't have to fear nothing we
[1:10:52] don't have to fear about being lost we
[1:10:54] don't have to feel about that fear the
[1:10:55] devil overcoming us we don't have to
[1:10:57] fear none of the tricks of the devil
[1:10:59] because once God's approval is approved
[1:11:03] by sealing you with the Holy Ghost
[1:11:05] Satan's work is finished ain't a thing
[1:11:09] he can do we're headed for our
[1:11:11] destination
[1:11:12] he can't even stop it but it's what
[1:11:16] really gets me is because there are so
[1:11:19] many other people who'd be think who
[1:11:23] think it because they believe God sent a
[1:11:26] prophet they even know his name like
[1:11:28] those who know new Moses name that don't
[1:11:32] get you you got to know the god of Moses
[1:11:37] once you come to know the god of Moses
[1:11:39] you're like Caleb and Joshua amen you
[1:11:43] can see the difference is that right oh
[1:11:45] it's the truth no matter what the
[1:11:47] congregation did Joshua and Caleb stayed
[1:11:50] true see the way they lived wasn't
[1:11:55] wasn't wasn't hinging upon millions and
[1:11:59] how they behaved they stayed true to the
[1:12:02] word that's how you know you got it it's
[1:12:06] when you can stay true to the word oh
[1:12:09] don't get me wrong you gonna have
[1:12:11] problems in this flesh but when you do
[1:12:14] you say Lord forgive me Father forgive
[1:12:17] me cleanse me Lord there's there's
[1:12:20] repentance there
[1:12:28] took that one gonna be long he says now
[1:12:30] remember this Christ in the to church is
[1:12:36] a continuation of the book of Acts
[1:12:41] continuation didn't say a pause it says
[1:12:46] continue continue means not to stop but
[1:12:53] the book of Revelation shows how that
[1:12:55] the Antichrist spirit would come into
[1:12:57] the church and defile it now let me say
[1:13:00] it like this did what did you hear what
[1:13:02] he said the Antichrist spirit would come
[1:13:05] into the church and defile it now let me
[1:13:08] let me tell you something don't you know
[1:13:10] God is not dealing with Laodicea he's
[1:13:15] not who was Delayer to see the
[1:13:16] Pentecostal churches God is smitten
[1:13:19] outside they put him out you said well
[1:13:22] who is there in there for the venom said
[1:13:24] it says no it's an imposter it's an
[1:13:29] imposter all that's shouting all that
[1:13:32] dancing all that speaking in tongues and
[1:13:34] then you show them the message and they
[1:13:35] can't see it it's because they have an
[1:13:37] impostor I know this sounds wrong he
[1:13:41] said you wait this you wait till they
[1:13:43] see that all that worship was
[1:13:46] worshipping the devil that's what he
[1:13:48] said I know that's rough but you got to
[1:13:53] realize what God is doing for you he's
[1:13:56] revealed to you the true and living God
[1:13:58] the day for your day you that's why the
[1:14:02] Bible said they were blind that's why so
[1:14:05] many millions billions of people receive
[1:14:08] the mark of the beast they didn't
[1:14:09] willfully say here put a mark in my head
[1:14:12] put a mark um I know they were deceived
[1:14:14] into it just like he was it doesn't mean
[1:14:20] let me tell you something the only ones
[1:14:22] that will escape that system is those
[1:14:25] whom God elected to do it
[1:14:29] somebody has to fulfill the scripture
[1:14:32] and you say I want to be brother but
[1:14:34] they're so sweet they're so kind hell is
[1:14:37] full of them
[1:14:42] true religious people follow them but
[1:14:46] the Bible said the Lord knoweth them
[1:14:49] that are his having this seal but seal
[1:14:53] the seal of God and those who are God
[1:14:58] will escape before I knew this message
[1:15:04] the Lord told me I had to leave my
[1:15:06] organization didn't know where I was
[1:15:10] going didn't know what I was going to do
[1:15:12] and when God placed that in my heart and
[1:15:16] I knew I had to leave that's when the
[1:15:18] message came to me see you don't tell me
[1:15:24] God doesn't work on both ends you got a
[1:15:27] lot of people right now who are tired of
[1:15:30] all of these systems they're moving
[1:15:33] right into their houses having to house
[1:15:35] churches because they don't know where
[1:15:37] to go and we're not doing our job
[1:15:44] people who are desperate wanting
[1:15:47] something and how you gonna bring them
[1:15:48] to a message that's supposed to be
[1:15:50] living and it's a dead among the people
[1:15:54] hmm it's true he messes people in I'm
[1:15:59] part of that group but most of us can't
[1:16:01] even
[1:16:03] we don't cared enough people can stay
[1:16:05] away from charts month after month
[1:16:07] nobody calls nobody checks on him where
[1:16:10] is the love of God I'm talking about us
[1:16:12] now and everybody expect the pastor to
[1:16:16] do it all the pastor came do it all
[1:16:17] y'all got eyes to see don't worry about
[1:16:20] me getting jealous about you calling
[1:16:22] somebody and checking up on them no
[1:16:24] that's what we're supposed to be doing
[1:16:26] oh god help us Jesus you got people in
[1:16:35] there like I said all these fights going
[1:16:37] on in people's homes and houses and all
[1:16:40] kind of crazy stuff and this is the
[1:16:42] message no no no no the message is life
[1:16:47] the messages believers taking things
[1:16:49] under control you know hear me somehow
[1:16:53] if we could believe that God can
[1:16:56] straighten our house
[1:16:57] don't you know he will if you believe
[1:17:00] that God can restore don't you know he
[1:17:02] will
[1:17:03] I believe it and I'm all my knees
[1:17:07] praying that God would I don't look at a
[1:17:10] defeat I don't look at the devil coming
[1:17:12] into my house or coming upon my children
[1:17:14] or coming upon me as a my body my fresh
[1:17:17] last night The Devil's trying to give me
[1:17:19] the flu something sneezing and coughing
[1:17:21] all night he meant I couldn't say oh I
[1:17:23] got the flu but I know better than that
[1:17:25] I don't have it if y'all see me sneeze
[1:17:29] and cough cuz the devil is a liar and I
[1:17:34] reshare accept what he got to offer I
[1:17:36] will have it
[1:17:37] I won't with God God God got healing God
[1:17:48] got deliverance huh
[1:17:54] but the book of Revelation shows how
[1:17:56] that Antichrist spirit would come in to
[1:17:59] the church and defile it you know he
[1:18:02] wasn't talking about laying asiye
[1:18:04] she was so defiled a long time ago she's
[1:18:07] considering a
[1:18:08] so any he ain't talking about her the
[1:18:11] real Church the true Bride of Christ and
[1:18:17] in order for us to become an invisible
[1:18:20] army we must know that everybody that
[1:18:23] puts up this picture or that picture
[1:18:26] doesn't mean they're bribed and
[1:18:29] everybody that quotes out of a message
[1:18:31] book it's not bribed you shall know them
[1:18:34] by their fruits if you can't love your
[1:18:42] brother because you believe he's coming
[1:18:44] on a cloud and he come in the other one
[1:18:46] believes that he's coming on a white
[1:18:48] horse you can't love your brother you
[1:18:50] still need the Holy Ghost you're not
[1:18:55] saved by doctrine I know how some people
[1:18:57] preach it but you're saved by the Holy
[1:19:00] Spirit by one spirit are you baptized
[1:19:03] into one body that's the
[1:19:09] trying to get us he said some Methodist
[1:19:11] Baptist but their brethren Wow because
[1:19:14] they have the Holy Ghost but listen God
[1:19:23] don't let you like he did Israel done
[1:19:25] justified you and then sanctified you
[1:19:27] and all of a sudden got the blood on you
[1:19:29] everywhere you go until you cross the
[1:19:31] Red Sea and then God trying to bring you
[1:19:33] to a higher height and a deeper depth
[1:19:35] and you like Koren date them then you
[1:19:37] have blasphemy
[1:19:38] you're not going any further because God
[1:19:42] is progressive and here we are God I try
[1:19:45] to try to tell my brothers and sisters
[1:19:47] do you think God brought us here for you
[1:19:49] me to preach to you everything that you
[1:19:51] already heard and things that you are to
[1:19:53] already know y'all understanding God
[1:19:57] brought me here that we can go further
[1:20:00] and the only way we can go farther is to
[1:20:04] clean up this make sure that this
[1:20:07] matches that that's what I'm here for
[1:20:10] that we may look and see that we've got
[1:20:14] to die we got a lot every day to achieve
[1:20:18] heaven cuz God will never have another
[1:20:23] Lucifer throughout eternity there'll
[1:20:26] never be an angel that will uprise have
[1:20:30] an uprise in heaven there'll never be
[1:20:33] another angel that's gonna think
[1:20:35] contrary to God
[1:20:37] that's why the Bible said let this mind
[1:20:40] be in you
[1:20:46] hmm God don't bring division men bring
[1:20:50] division that's what he said in God
[1:20:54] provided wait he tells us you see all
[1:20:57] these people call themselves bringing
[1:20:59] division down ain't God all of us gonna
[1:21:03] be different we're brothers
[1:21:07] but in our natural look nothing alike
[1:21:10] you said that too quick
[1:21:19] that wasn't too bad
[1:21:23] but you and I must realize it's in the
[1:21:26] Holy Spirit have you walked up to
[1:21:29] somebody they don't even know nothing
[1:21:31] about Jesus yet but you know their
[1:21:33] brother you know somehow they coming in
[1:21:37] right it's like when God when brother
[1:21:39] Branham met brother Neville he said I
[1:21:41] claim him for the kingdom one day I'm a
[1:21:43] baptized that old Methodist man in the
[1:21:46] name of Jesus Christ see my point is
[1:21:49] this you cannot allow a person to stay
[1:21:53] where they are if you know more truth
[1:21:55] you are against the word cuz Paul when
[1:21:59] he met those disciples of John it was
[1:22:04] given to him to expound to them a more
[1:22:08] excellent way and when you and I come
[1:22:11] listen I have everybody that I've
[1:22:13] witness to everybody that have come here
[1:22:15] that I brought here by God's grace I
[1:22:18] tried to expound to them on board
[1:22:21] excellent way now if they reject it the
[1:22:24] blood is off me but if I don't tell them
[1:22:28] their blood is on my hand now they can
[1:22:31] reject it and if they don't see it
[1:22:33] leave them don't push them into
[1:22:35] blaspheming just leave them because
[1:22:37] maybe that's all God has given them it
[1:22:39] doesn't mean they're out of the economy
[1:22:41] of God God has a place for everybody
[1:22:47] that calls on the name of Jesus I don't
[1:22:51] know where it is but God has it God
[1:22:54] can't go against his word but a man
[1:22:57] confess with his mouth bleed right but
[1:22:59] don't try to push him to believe or see
[1:23:01] something that that he can't see if the
[1:23:04] God doesn't ordained it it ain't for him
[1:23:06] to see and you don't want him to speak
[1:23:09] evil against that which is truth you
[1:23:11] understand me
[1:23:14] brother president walk with all those
[1:23:16] denominational people when they couldn't
[1:23:19] see it he's still calling brother it was
[1:23:22] God who determined which way they go
[1:23:27] did you know that eighty Bisco amen
[1:23:30] never did get baptized in the name of
[1:23:31] the Lord Jesus Christ until after
[1:23:33] brother Branham had died he didn't see
[1:23:37] it until then so God has his own timing
[1:23:41] about everything we don't be
[1:23:47] crystallized people letting that guard
[1:23:51] go let go and let God have his way
[1:23:53] I got brothers right now who's come and
[1:23:56] they don't see it I still fellowship
[1:23:58] with him whenever I can you know what
[1:24:00] and it's always around the word
[1:24:02] sometimes I get on things they'd only
[1:24:04] hear it no more and they jump to
[1:24:05] something else but that's okay I'm not
[1:24:13] here to say who's lost and who's not
[1:24:15] that's not my business but my business
[1:24:18] is to bring us up to a higher calling in
[1:24:20] Christ let me finish this quote so I can
[1:24:22] let you go a lot of people don't even
[1:24:27] believe this because this was out of the
[1:24:28] church age book yes that one of the best
[1:24:34] books I've ever read in my life in her
[1:24:38] name brother branham sanction it and we
[1:24:40] got all these spiritual preachers who
[1:24:41] don't believe it's of God and I'm like
[1:24:44] oh my god that stuff is it's so full of
[1:24:47] me it's so full of woo Thank You Laura
[1:24:49] and you know your Holy Spirit bear
[1:24:51] witness to it
[1:24:53] you love the Lord you know a man got the
[1:24:58] Holy Ghost and he doesn't see this
[1:24:59] that's only ascending him and God but
[1:25:02] the book of Revelation shows how that
[1:25:04] the Antichrist spirit would come into
[1:25:07] the church and defile it making it
[1:25:09] lukewarm formal powerless and it exposes
[1:25:13] Satan revealing his work attempting
[1:25:16] destruction of God's people and the
[1:25:20] discrediting of God's Word you see what
[1:25:22] he's doing he's trying to make the Word
[1:25:25] of God of none effect when he comes in
[1:25:28] here because though you know you know
[1:25:30] what I'm saying
[1:25:31] like I read this morning brother I said
[1:25:33] you go to a missionary field a man could
[1:25:35] maybe making 10 cent or whatever a week
[1:25:37] and he barely can't feed himself and
[1:25:41] he's you know wearing clothes and little
[1:25:43] clothes
[1:25:44] I ain't got hardly nothing but when he's
[1:25:46] got the Holy Ghost when you meet him he
[1:25:47] he's so happy and full of joy like he's
[1:25:49] riding down the road in a in a limousine
[1:25:52] that God we need some of that we need
[1:25:56] some of that why because the least the
[1:25:59] thing that goes wrong financially we
[1:26:01] want to give up on God and Oh God why me
[1:26:04] come let me ask you what about Lazarus I
[1:26:10] want to talk to him so bad when I get
[1:26:12] that he'll be one of the first ones I
[1:26:14] want to see the one who laid at the
[1:26:16] Richmond table I want to talk to him
[1:26:21] he was in the position like the brother
[1:26:23] said right there in a position to where
[1:26:25] he could be seen and no doubt the
[1:26:27] scripture prize running in his head
[1:26:29] never I've seen the righteous forsaken
[1:26:31] nor his seed begging bread but look at
[1:26:33] you the devil would say but that's okay
[1:26:36] I'm in my right position
[1:26:39] I'm ordained to be here see people don't
[1:26:43] understand in the mind of God God can do
[1:26:46] whatever he wants to do God can put a
[1:26:49] person in the place look like they'd
[1:26:50] break in the scripture and they're doing
[1:26:54] just what God wanted to do oh you know
[1:26:57] I've heard people say crazy things about
[1:26:59] Solomon they make no sense that man had
[1:27:01] a problem marring all those women and he
[1:27:04] was right in the will of God but to the
[1:27:10] world he had a real problem on his hand
[1:27:15] but he was right in the will of God hmm
[1:27:19] totally think you I want you to go over
[1:27:21] there I want you to make some cakes for
[1:27:23] me make it out a human doll you know God
[1:27:27] didn't tell you that God did and
[1:27:31] easy.you was so convincing with God he
[1:27:33] said hopefully he can I just do it out
[1:27:36] of the the horses huh see though you
[1:27:40] can't put God in a box and it doesn't
[1:27:44] matter how much we want somebody saved
[1:27:46] not one of us can save him I can't save
[1:27:51] my children more or less I can save
[1:27:53] myself I can't say God saved me
[1:27:57] he finishes it exposes Satan revealing
[1:28:02] his works attempted destruction of God
[1:28:04] people and the discrediting of God's
[1:28:06] Word right down to the time he is cast
[1:28:09] into the lake of fire
[1:28:10] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[1:28:13] knows that if the people get the true
[1:28:15] revelation of the true church and what
[1:28:18] it is and what she stands for and that
[1:28:22] she can do the greater works she will be
[1:28:25] an invincible how many times we've heard
[1:28:29] this read maybe it's time for us to
[1:28:31] measure up and we can't do it without
[1:28:35] God we can't do it without the Holy
[1:28:38] Ghost
[1:28:38] we can't please God without the Holy
[1:28:41] Ghost and so what would mean what we
[1:28:44] must do
[1:28:45] Crowl for more if you say old brother
[1:28:48] Brooks I got it no I ain't never had
[1:28:50] enough I want more and more and more and
[1:28:55] when he comes I won't know whatever that
[1:29:00] is but I always need more of him why
[1:29:05] the tests are getting harder you ain't
[1:29:12] never had mind battles like you have
[1:29:14] them now and all I mean in your mind
[1:29:16] some reality
[1:29:21] y'all knows the truth but this solution
[1:29:25] to every one of our problems is the yoke
[1:29:33] breaker the anointing that destroys the
[1:29:38] yokes it is the anointing and the only
[1:29:42] way you're gonna want to get that is
[1:29:44] down on your knees in a repenting in a
[1:29:50] crying out and God giving wrong you in a
[1:29:55] desperation it's what we need it's how
[1:29:58] we gonna get more of God
[1:30:00] we must fight against the spirit of
[1:30:03] Laodicea later see is lukewarm
[1:30:07] oxidase you know we've got a fight you
[1:30:11] know
[1:30:11] don't want to remain lukewarm you and I
[1:30:14] need to be on fire all of us I want to
[1:30:21] be on fire
[1:30:22] I want my fire so hot you know catch
[1:30:26] somebody else on fire merciful father as
[1:30:30] we come to you Lord we thank you for
[1:30:33] your amazing grace we thank you for
[1:30:36] being so good to us Lord you've been
[1:30:39] better to us than we've been to
[1:30:40] ourselves father what can we say Lord
[1:30:43] Jesus other than thank you God for being
[1:30:47] so good to us be merciful to us Lord in
[1:30:51] your name Jesus Christ we pray I want to
[1:30:57] encourage everybody as often as possible
[1:31:01] listen to a message if you don't like
[1:31:05] listen read your books that is so
[1:31:08] important right now how would you know
[1:31:11] the will of God if you don't eat the
[1:31:13] whole book eat it people take it in so
[1:31:18] that you can develop the Christ in you
[1:31:21] we're not here to criticize or the judge
[1:31:24] to say who's going to heaven and who's
[1:31:26] going to hell but I want to say this to
[1:31:29] you sometime God ordained people to be
[1:31:31] your friend
[1:31:31] that they might inherit InTown title and
[1:31:34] eternal life because they were good to
[1:31:37] the bride so it's imperative it's
[1:31:42] important that you and I take a stand
[1:31:45] and stand stand as the bride of Jesus
[1:31:48] Christ not in a prideful way but a
[1:31:51] humble way that people might see Jesus
[1:31:54] in us that's all I live for I've had so
[1:31:57] many people compliment me and I said no
[1:31:59] it ain't me it's God sometimes they
[1:32:01] compliment me when in times that I don't
[1:32:03] even feel like I should have been
[1:32:04] complimented because I don't do it to be
[1:32:06] complimented but they see Jesus
[1:32:10] I had a denominational brother said to
[1:32:12] me he said if I could just love God like
[1:32:14] you love him and do like you do he said
[1:32:16] I'll be alright
[1:32:17] but then when I brought him to the word
[1:32:19] he sometimes people don't know what
[1:32:21] they're asking for
[1:32:24] m.a.c this has come for a lot of
[1:32:26] sacrifice and you don't get a lot of
[1:32:28] anointing without suffering hello
[1:32:32] you gonna suffer the closer you get to
[1:32:34] God the more you're gonna suffer you
[1:32:37] don't want it I'll take it let me suffer
[1:32:40] now that I might reign with him later
[1:32:43] let's stand just keep on praying for the
[1:33:01] Lord is nigh say this before I forget my
[1:33:25] wife brought a thought to me and I
[1:33:26] thought it was excellent we won't be
[1:33:29] able to do it now because we're
[1:33:30] approaching Thanksgiving but what we're
[1:33:33] going to do is start having more
[1:33:36] potlucks or getting together with each
[1:33:39] other we haven't lost something in this
[1:33:43] fellowship and that is connection with
[1:33:46] each other understand that even Jesus
[1:33:49] never wanted to lose connection with his
[1:33:51] disciples and their times he would have
[1:33:53] bread and wine a supper so I think we
[1:33:59] need to start doing that again
[1:34:00] even if if they won't invite somebody to
[1:34:03] come that's fine but I think we need to
[1:34:06] start buying in the breach bridging the
[1:34:09] gaps because none of us has sat down
[1:34:12] with each other and really fellowship
[1:34:13] with each other in years and we're the
[1:34:16] bride of Jesus Christ we're gonna wish
[1:34:19] we had one of these old days and I think
[1:34:22] a lot of times will come God would be
[1:34:23] pleased with that I know he will I
[1:34:25] remember the time when when I first came
[1:34:27] to the church I was telling my wife and
[1:34:29] someone else I think brother Keith of
[1:34:31] brother which I'm not sure which of a
[1:34:32] baby both when we we used to just go out
[1:34:36] for dinner just
[1:34:37] and my that was such a wonderful time
[1:34:40] for me cause though I had not moved up
[1:34:42] here yet I'm just wondering did y'all do
[1:34:45] that to bait me or what but anyway after
[1:34:48] I got up here look like everybody
[1:34:49] scattered all right but y'all remember
[1:34:52] those little times we even went to
[1:34:54] restaurants we didn't even like but we
[1:34:57] did it for y'all remember because that's
[1:35:01] what love will do you know law was
[1:35:09] sacrifice for one another and I think
[1:35:12] that's what we need to do we go our
[1:35:13] separate ways people it's not good it's
[1:35:17] not good we need to find time for one
[1:35:20] another again and let the devil see that
[1:35:23] we're not defeated we're not gonna give
[1:35:26] up on each other
[1:35:27] y'all understand me but we're gonna go
[1:35:30] forward amen in the in the in the name
[1:35:32] of the Lord and I think if we start in
[1:35:35] just that way gada began to add a lot
[1:35:39] more to our fellowship and our services
[1:35:42] I hope you all are agreeable if not for
[1:35:45] those who are available we'll see y'all
[1:35:47] in a few weeks around the table even you
[1:35:52] love the Lord I really appreciate
[1:35:54] everybody that comes here on Sunday
[1:35:56] evening I know everybody can't make it
[1:35:57] because of jobs and situations but those
[1:36:00] things that you sacrifice for the name
[1:36:02] of the Lord Jesus Christ God will always
[1:36:04] reward you I love the Lord your loving
[1:36:09] tonight
[1:36:09] thank you for your patience just keep on
[1:36:13] praying
