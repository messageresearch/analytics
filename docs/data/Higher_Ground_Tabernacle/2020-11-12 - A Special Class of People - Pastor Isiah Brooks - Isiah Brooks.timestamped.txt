[9:05] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may
[9:08] be okay let us read the scripture I
[9:10] going to say you may be seated my
[9:14] apology you love the
[9:17] Lord we're going to be reading
[9:19] Revelations 21
[9:22] 9-11 then we'll go from there to First
[9:25] Peter 2 and9
[9:30] and then one more scripture 1 John
[9:34] 44-6 you and I we realize that we're
[9:36] living in the last days and I believe by
[9:38] God's grace that God has something
[9:41] special for us and um we know and
[9:45] believe with our hearts that the Lord is
[9:47] soon to come uh the Bible tells us we
[9:50] don't know the day nor the hour but we
[9:52] we definitely can see that we're now
[9:54] living in the seizing of a
[9:57] translation I don't know about you but
[9:59] I'm making
[10:00] ready I'm preparing to be ready when he
[10:03] comes not by power not by might but by
[10:07] my spirit say the Lord and I believe
[10:09] with all of our hearts that all of us
[10:11] realize that tonight because many of the
[10:13] things that we might want to change in
[10:15] our hearts change in our lives we we
[10:17] know that we can't do it without the
[10:19] help of the Lord Revelations 21
[10:22] 9-11 and there came unto me one of the
[10:24] Seven Angels which had the seven
[10:29] [Music]
[10:32] let's begin that
[10:38] again I don't know do you have a
[10:41] different mic I could use huh this is
[10:44] okay okay and there came unto me one of
[10:46] the Seven Angels which had the seven
[10:48] vows full of seven last plagues and
[10:51] talked with me saying come here the I
[10:53] will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife
[10:56] and he carried me away in the spirit to
[10:59] a great and high mountain and showed me
[11:02] that great City the holy Jerusalem
[11:05] descending Out of Heaven from God having
[11:08] the glory of God and her light was like
[11:11] unto a stone most precious even like a
[11:15] jasper stone clear as Crystal 1
[11:20] Peter 2
[11:26] and9 but ye are are chosen
[11:30] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[11:33] nation A peculiar people that you should
[11:36] show forth the Praises of him who have
[11:38] called you out of Darkness into his his
[11:42] his Marvelous Light His Marvelous Light
[11:46] which in time past were not a people but
[11:49] are now the people of God which had not
[11:52] obtained Mercy but now have obtained
[11:57] mercy first first John 4 we begin at the
[12:01] fourth verse of that particular uh
[12:06] book 1 John the 4th
[12:09] chapter beginning at the fourth
[12:12] verse ye are of God little children and
[12:15] have overcome them because greater is he
[12:18] that is in you that he than he that is
[12:20] in the world they are of the world
[12:23] therefore speak they of the world and
[12:25] the world heareth them but we are of God
[12:29] he that knoweth God heareth us he that
[12:32] is not of God heareth not us hereby know
[12:36] we the spirit of truth and the spirit of
[12:39] error let us pray our heavenly father we
[12:43] come before you Lord Jesus as humbly as
[12:45] we know how we thank you for being so
[12:48] good to us Lord we thank you for all
[12:51] that you have done for us you have been
[12:53] better to us Lord Jesus than we've been
[12:55] to ourselves father we give you thanks
[12:57] we give you glory we pray father God
[13:00] tonight that you would give us Grace and
[13:01] move out completely out of your way and
[13:04] we ask oh God that you would just please
[13:06] anoint us anoint your people give us the
[13:09] words Lord that you would speak or speak
[13:12] through our lips the words that you
[13:13] would want to speak Lord in Jesus
[13:16] Christ's name we pray amen you may be
[13:26] seated thank God for the uh song service
[13:29] we had beautiful songs by God's grace we
[13:33] appreciate
[13:34] that I I just uh have had
[13:38] to
[13:39] U entitled this a special class of
[13:43] people H if I had a subtopic this would
[13:47] it would be this this is what I call
[13:50] Glory when we talk about a special class
[13:53] of people you and I must realize that
[13:56] the class of people that we are are
[13:58] those whom God has
[14:00] chosen we know because of brother
[14:02] brandom tells telling us that we were
[14:05] chosen from the foundation of the world
[14:06] of course that is the scripture but he
[14:09] better explained it to us he illuminated
[14:11] that scripture so that we could better
[14:14] understand what it was all about many
[14:16] times I would read that scripture and
[14:18] not understand what it was saying
[14:19] because I know that God uh way he does
[14:23] things um it's quite different from the
[14:25] way we think he would do but we know
[14:28] that he election is something that God
[14:30] does and he alone and the Bible tells us
[14:33] that he's Sovereign and tells us that
[14:35] he's the only
[14:37] potentate he's the only he's the final
[14:40] authority of over all things right he is
[14:43] the maker and creator of all things and
[14:46] the Bible according to St John said
[14:49] nothing was made that is made without
[14:51] him brother random in the seven Church
[14:54] ages I believe uh the book of excuse me
[14:56] the revelation of Jesus Christ he began
[14:59] to talk about some things and I'm going
[15:01] to read this just to give it a little
[15:03] background on where we headed tonight
[15:06] now you know we've been dealing with The
[15:08] Arc of the Covenant we talked about the
[15:11] table
[15:13] uh according to um Psalms 23rd you know
[15:18] face to face um showing that in this
[15:21] hour in this day that's the kind of
[15:23] communication that God wants he wants an
[15:25] intimate relationship with you and this
[15:28] is why uh according to Revelations 10 he
[15:30] came down as the mighty Angel uh we saw
[15:34] and have seen uh the face of God Seven
[15:37] Angels amen
[15:39] actually came down and thundered out a
[15:42] message that was only meant for a
[15:46] special class of people the world in
[15:48] itself uh at this point in time has no
[15:52] idea of what's taking place uh because
[15:55] of their interpretations of the word
[15:57] that they have received d uh in their in
[16:01] their theology many people think that
[16:04] God is going to come down uh and
[16:07] thousands of people are going to be
[16:08] raptured and planes are going to wreck
[16:11] uh trains are going to crash boats are
[16:14] going to sink uh they just believe that
[16:18] at at that kind of drama that's the kind
[16:21] of drama that uh will take place at the
[16:24] Rapture and to be honest with you you
[16:26] won't find any Scripture to back that up
[16:31] that's right matter of fact the Bible
[16:32] tells us that it will be uh uh catching
[16:35] away and it's and it's a secret catching
[16:39] away uh so much so the Bible says no man
[16:41] know the day nor the hour and according
[16:44] to the prophet of Malachi 4 we
[16:47] understand that it will be such a small
[16:49] number of people that most of the people
[16:53] in the world won't even know that the
[16:55] Rapture has taken place but I'm began to
[16:59] read this because I really believe that
[17:01] something is taking place even right now
[17:05] and U I believe I'm in the Rapture I
[17:07] believe that God is Not only called me
[17:10] but he's transforming me even as we
[17:14] speak he says amen we know that if the
[17:18] people get the true
[17:20] revelation of the true church and what
[17:23] she is and what she stands for and that
[17:27] she can do the Greater Works she will be
[17:31] an in Invincible Army now remember
[17:34] brother ROM tells us about Greater Works
[17:37] he he talks about it's not like more of
[17:40] but he said here he used an an analysis
[17:44] and he used Jesus uh of yesterday and
[17:47] how Jesus turned the water into wine and
[17:50] how he fed thousands with a few fish and
[17:53] loaves of bread and he said in Jesus day
[17:57] even though he was God In the Flesh he
[18:00] took something and made something but in
[18:04] our day the same Jesus using the body of
[18:08] William brandom literally created
[18:12] squirrels out of nothing he stopped a
[18:17] storm he created things he gave a little
[18:20] fish life out of nothing and that was
[18:24] Jesus Christ in the son of man revealing
[18:28] himself self to this generation so we
[18:32] understand what the Greater Works in
[18:34] other words we we're God as he was in
[18:36] the beginning he took something he did
[18:39] he did something from nothing all right
[18:42] there was not something already there
[18:44] that God used it was by the spoken word
[18:47] that God created
[18:48] everything and so that's what we call
[18:52] Greater work she will be an invincible
[18:56] Army understand that this is prophecy
[19:00] if they get a true revelation of the two
[19:02] true Spirits within the framework of the
[19:04] Christian church and by God Spirit
[19:07] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[19:10] Spirit what is that Antichrist spirit
[19:13] that spirit that literally denies that
[19:16] Jesus has come in the flesh not just
[19:18] only in a prophet but in your flesh all
[19:22] right Satan will be powerless before her
[19:25] he will be as definitely dwart today
[19:29] as when Christ with
[19:31] stod uh uh with stod his ever effort to
[19:35] gain power over him in the desert yes
[19:39] Satan hates Revelation but we love it
[19:43] with true Revelation in our lives the
[19:46] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us
[19:50] but we will prevail over them now
[19:54] remember he starts out in this paragraph
[19:58] with the bride or the church coming into
[20:01] a true revelation of who she is that's
[20:04] right and then he comes along and says
[20:07] if we could just get that Revelation in
[20:10] our lives the Gates of Hell cannot
[20:14] Prevail against us but we will prevail
[20:19] over them he said you will recall that I
[20:22] mentioned at the beginning of this
[20:23] message that this book we are studying
[20:26] is the actual revelation of Jesus Christ
[20:30] himself in the church and his work is in
[20:34] the future ages now he says in the
[20:37] church he's not talking about a building
[20:39] he's talking about human beings in the
[20:42] church and he goes on to say Amen that
[20:45] it is the actual revelation of Jesus
[20:48] Christ himself in the church and his
[20:50] work in the future ages then I mentioned
[20:53] that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[20:55] Revelation or we will fail to get it
[20:59] bringing these two thoughts together you
[21:01] will see that it won't take just
[21:03] ordinary study and thinking to make this
[21:06] book real it is going to take the
[21:09] operation of the Holy Ghost that means
[21:13] this book can't be revealed to anyone
[21:16] but a special class of people that's
[21:19] where I got my thought from a people
[21:21] that is filled with the Holy Ghost like
[21:24] I said this this this is I if I I put
[21:28] this way
[21:31] this word is like unbaked bread Half
[21:35] Baked you get a little bit of something
[21:37] and understanding from it but with but
[21:40] you get the full Loaf the revelation of
[21:44] the full word if the shakina of Glory
[21:47] comes down right see you need the
[21:50] anointing to anoint the letter of the
[21:53] word it must come to life and it cannot
[21:55] come to life without the Holy Ghost
[21:59] this is why we have doctrines of
[22:00] divinity that still struggles with the
[22:03] godheads still struggle with the coming
[22:05] of the Lord they they they they they
[22:07] premen millenniums and post millenniums
[22:10] and whatever they they they just because
[22:13] because the Bible says that the Conor
[22:15] mind cannot understand those things
[22:18] which are
[22:20] spiritual all right it will take amen uh
[22:24] one with prophetic Insight it will
[22:27] require the ability to to hear from God
[22:30] it will require a supernatural
[22:32] instruction not a student comparing
[22:34] verses with verses though that is good
[22:37] but a mystery a mystery requires the
[22:39] teaching of the spirit or it'll never
[22:42] becomes clear how we need to hear from
[22:45] God and lay ourselves open and become
[22:49] yielded to the spirit to hear and to
[22:52] know he he's always coming back to the
[22:54] spirit because it's not by power it's
[22:57] not by might but it's by his own Holy
[22:59] Spirit you the kind of mind this is why
[23:02] Christians we we we can't just read this
[23:05] Bible without
[23:06] prayer you the the anointing must flow
[23:10] in order for God to open up this word to
[23:13] you right as I have already said this
[23:17] book Revelation is the consummation of
[23:20] the Scripture it is even placed exactly
[23:24] right with the cannon of the scripture
[23:26] at the end now you can know why it says
[23:30] that Anyone who reads or even hear it is
[23:34] blessed it is the revelation of God that
[23:37] would give you authority over the devil
[23:41] and you can see why they who would add
[23:44] or take from it would be cursed it would
[23:47] have to be so for who can add or take
[23:51] away from the perfect revelation of God
[23:54] and overcome the enemy you can't
[23:58] you
[24:00] can't you have to have a perfect
[24:02] revelation of God in order to overcome
[24:05] the enemy it is that simple there is
[24:08] nothing of such prevailing power as the
[24:11] revelation of the word see in verse
[24:15] three a blessing is pronounced on the
[24:18] this uh uh blessing is pronounced on
[24:21] those who give special attention to this
[24:23] book I think this refers to the Old
[24:26] Testament customs of the PRI reading the
[24:29] word to the congregation in the morning
[24:31] and you see many could not read uh so
[24:34] that the priest had to read to them as
[24:36] long as it was a word the blessings was
[24:39] there it didn't matter if it was heard
[24:43] read or heard amen so it's important
[24:47] that when you come to church you're
[24:48] literally being blessed when it's read
[24:51] you're being blessed when his preach is
[24:54] being blessed
[24:56] amen but the reason why I was kind of
[24:59] working in this area because I kind of
[25:01] worked uh the other day with the shoe
[25:03] bread and and I talked about the you
[25:05] know uh moving into this holies of
[25:07] holies and and I showed you by the grace
[25:10] of God that the only way that you'll
[25:11] know that the life of God is in you that
[25:15] because your spirit man will witness to
[25:19] the Inner Man and the holies of holies
[25:22] because there's no feelings in your soul
[25:24] the only thing that's in your soul is
[25:26] Faith or doubt and when faith is there
[25:30] it will show itself in the spiritual
[25:33] realm amen it's somehow you you come to
[25:37] a place and say I know that I know that
[25:40] I know that kind of a thing that I've
[25:42] been born again right all right so we
[25:46] understand by God's grace we are a a
[25:48] special kind of people and the reason
[25:51] being is because we have ears to hear is
[25:54] that right the Bible tells us that Jesus
[25:57] said amen that that there his sheep
[26:01] heareth his voice and a stranger they
[26:04] will not follow and we love this we love
[26:07] this message because we realize that we
[26:09] did not just become Sons and Daughters
[26:12] of God but even when we did not know him
[26:17] we were a son amen by way of his
[26:20] attributes it may have taking us a long
[26:23] while to come into the acknowledgment of
[26:27] Christ and Jesus Jesus Christ uh being
[26:30] our savior our Lord and our father but
[26:33] but but because of
[26:35] predestination you and I could not miss
[26:39] amen our
[26:41] appointment now I was uh want to read
[26:45] some uh another scripture let us read uh
[26:48] Genesis 49 and I'm not going to be long
[26:50] tonight hopefully I I just want
[26:53] to go here and because something is
[26:56] taking place and and God God has done a
[26:59] thing like I said e e even in the uh Arc
[27:02] of the Covenant uh you had uh I'm going
[27:06] to preach on the golden candlesticks
[27:07] tonight that's where I'm headed but but
[27:09] here this is just a little replica it's
[27:12] not it's nothing imperfection it's
[27:14] nothing what it really looks like
[27:15] because it's got a lot more designs and
[27:17] things on it uh but I just wanted you to
[27:20] know how that it actually was and and of
[27:23] course um all these uh arms and stuff uh
[27:27] basically pointed to this one because
[27:30] this is the main one of all the other
[27:33] six uh and I'll try to explain that
[27:35] tonight because I want you to understand
[27:38] that that this golden Candlestick
[27:41] doesn't represent seven people it
[27:44] represents one
[27:46] person and I'll read that to you in just
[27:49] a minute so you can understand
[27:53] that God is a tree too and he had
[27:57] branches but let's move on Jacob for uh
[28:00] excuse me Genesis 49
[28:03] And1 it caught my attention even today
[28:06] uh here in the in the 49th chapter of
[28:09] Genesis the Bible said and Jacob called
[28:11] unto his sons and said Gather yourselves
[28:15] together that I may tell you that which
[28:19] befalls you in the last days now here's
[28:23] a prophecy hundreds of years ago
[28:31] given by Jacob who we know as Israel to
[28:34] his sons and he began to tell his sons
[28:38] what was going to take place in the
[28:40] latter day now it is it amazes me how
[28:45] people want to say that this Bible is
[28:46] not right but if it's not right why do
[28:49] you hate it why do you want to get rid
[28:52] of it uh the reason being because it is
[28:56] a love letter to the Bride of Jesus
[28:57] Christ chist and even though many people
[29:02] millions and millions of people will
[29:04] never come to understanded the Bride of
[29:07] Jesus Christ
[29:09] will and he says Amen in he and and so
[29:12] we know and and if you read uh here uh
[29:15] in in Genesis the 49th chapter he goes
[29:18] through all of his sons and blesses them
[29:20] and blesses them and blesses them and I
[29:22] don't really have time for all of that
[29:23] reading but tonight I want us to jump
[29:25] down to the eth verse because there's
[29:27] something that I have in mind to to
[29:29] bring forth by God's grace in the eth
[29:32] verse he says
[29:34] Judah Thou Art he whom thy Brethren
[29:39] shall praise thy hand shall be in the
[29:42] neck of thine enemies thy father's
[29:45] children shall bow down before thee
[29:48] Judah is a lion's WEP from the prey my
[29:52] son Thou Art gone up he stoop down he
[29:56] couches as a lion and as an old lion who
[30:00] shall Rouse him up the scepter shall not
[30:04] depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from
[30:09] between his feet until Shiloh come and
[30:13] unto him shall the Gathering of the
[30:16] people be and this is a major prophet
[30:20] and this a major prophecy excuse me that
[30:22] God has given to Judah and we know that
[30:24] Jesus Christ was of the line uh tribe of
[30:27] Judah and so so was David he came out of
[30:31] the tribe of Judah and of course Judah
[30:33] means praise or confession amen because
[30:37] remember during the time when David was
[30:39] in trouble Judah was one of those tribes
[30:42] uh that literally stayed with him and uh
[30:46] protected him fought for him and
[30:48] encouraged others to come and join him
[30:50] Judah played a great part now Judah
[30:53] wasn't even Judah wasn't even a part of
[30:54] the priesthood right but here we we know
[30:58] when it came to Aaron and Levi that was
[31:01] what God used in the priesthood but then
[31:04] God jumps over here and chooses Judah to
[31:08] bring Christ from who is the high priest
[31:12] of all things and understand by God's
[31:14] grace this is this is quite important
[31:17] that we might know that what God is
[31:19] doing in these last days amen he's
[31:21] pulling a priesthood together a people
[31:24] that will be under the anointing of of
[31:28] Judah that will stay with Christ
[31:30] regardless to what comes our way no
[31:33] matter how the battle is we're going to
[31:35] stick and stay because we are of the
[31:38] same tribe the same blood Hallelujah we
[31:42] are his people that's right all right so
[31:46] we realize amen that something is
[31:48] happening and and like I said you know
[31:50] we may know some of us may know all of
[31:51] the things that I'm getting ready to say
[31:52] today but I wanted to say these things
[31:54] because I'm I'm working with the the the
[31:59] you know I haven't taken everything in
[32:01] in the ark but I I'm just taking little
[32:04] things as we go and you know I want
[32:07] everybody to see that here we are in a
[32:10] place where God is preparing the table
[32:13] before our enemy and in this time and in
[32:16] this season we must know who we are
[32:20] where we came from and where we're going
[32:23] and the Bible tells us every bit of it
[32:26] and I wanted to take the golden Cath
[32:27] candlesticks tonight because a lot of us
[32:30] don't understand that the golden
[32:31] candlesticks were just not something
[32:34] that lit up the holy place but it was in
[32:37] shadowing type of something that was
[32:39] really great and in that shadowing
[32:42] typing Israel did not even see it
[32:45] themselves you know they saw all of the
[32:48] golden instruments and things that they
[32:49] had to make and form according to the
[32:51] way Moses did see it but to have a
[32:54] revelation of it they did not uh if they
[32:57] had only uh revelation of who that and
[33:01] their rituals was all about they never
[33:03] would have followed other gods and you
[33:05] see because that's the only thing
[33:07] that'll make you follow something else
[33:09] is when you don't have a true revelation
[33:12] of what you're following
[33:14] presently right because if the people
[33:16] understood that this message was not of
[33:19] a man but it was of God for ordained of
[33:22] God and and and only a special kind of
[33:25] people can hear it uh you know they
[33:27] would have never left because they would
[33:28] have seen that they were part of that
[33:30] special kind of people amen so I brought
[33:34] that up to say now listen here was the
[33:36] here was the thing the Bible said that
[33:38] the septer shall not depart from Judah
[33:40] nor a lawgiver from between his feet
[33:44] until Shiloh come and when Shiloh come
[33:47] which is Christ he is Christ and unto
[33:50] him shall the Gathering of the people be
[33:53] in other words there's a gathering when
[33:55] he comes not of just the G Iles but of
[33:58] the Jews as well and we understand that
[34:01] this message that's what brother brandom
[34:03] said he said this very same message that
[34:06] is calling the bride will be preached to
[34:09] the
[34:10] Jews 144,000 will have to hear the very
[34:14] message that you and I have heard amen
[34:17] that's right Moses and L would preach
[34:19] the same
[34:21] message excuse me let's go to Exodus
[34:24] 25:31 let's start there you love the
[34:27] Lord
[34:34] Lord Exodus
[34:36] 25:31 and thou shalt make a a
[34:39] Candlestick of pure gold I want you to
[34:41] notice the description of this of this
[34:44] pure goal beaten work shall the
[34:47] candlesticks be made his shaft and his
[34:51] branches his bows his knobs and his
[34:54] flowers shall be of the same
[34:58] excuse
[34:59] me in other words let for instance what
[35:03] he did what they what he did he says I'm
[35:05] going to give
[35:06] you a certain amount of
[35:09] gold you understand that it it's a
[35:12] limited amount of
[35:14] gold not that that's what God did I'm
[35:17] going give you a limited amount of gold
[35:19] and out of this gold I want you to
[35:22] form all of these
[35:26] pieces he couldn't give give them
[35:28] more than enough because it would have
[35:31] been an excess and he couldn't give them
[35:34] less because something would have come
[35:37] short and everything had to balance and
[35:41] be equal I mean whatever he formed in
[35:44] other words these uh uh all of the the
[35:48] you know we always say golden we said um
[35:52] candle sticks but the Bible doesn't say
[35:55] candle sticks it say say candle stick
[36:00] one golden candle
[36:03] stick six branches shall come out of the
[36:06] side of it three
[36:08] branches of the Candlestick out of the
[36:11] one side and three
[36:13] branches of the counter stick out of the
[36:15] other side and of course three bowls
[36:19] made like unto almonds with a knop and a
[36:22] flower in one branch and three bowls uh
[36:27] made like almonds in the other Branch
[36:29] with a knot and a flow so the six
[36:32] branches that come out of the
[36:34] Candlestick see and in the Candlestick
[36:37] shall be four bowls made like under
[36:39] almonds with their knops and their
[36:42] flowers and there shall be a knp unto
[36:45] under you know what a knp is you see
[36:47] that little piece that little little
[36:49] knot there that's basically what it is
[36:51] and of course these it was more than in
[36:53] just that one place but anyway I wish I
[36:56] had a better
[36:58] vision of this so you can B see what
[37:00] we're working with and there shall be a
[37:02] knp under the branches of the same and a
[37:04] knp under the branches of the same and a
[37:07] KN under the two branches of the same
[37:09] according to the six branches that
[37:11] proceeded out of the Candlestick in
[37:13] other words Jesus Christ is the same
[37:15] yesterday today and forever no matter
[37:18] how and what ages these candle these uh
[37:21] branches represented uh they had to be
[37:25] the same because remember the gold was
[37:28] of one piece and all of these Ministries
[37:32] was made out of one piece of gold one
[37:36] body we you understand me and so
[37:40] everything had to be equal everything
[37:42] had to me be measured correctly and when
[37:45] it all came up to this no matter how
[37:48] long how long or short amen everything
[37:51] had to be right in the exact way that
[37:56] Moses saw it
[37:59] this is a powerful
[38:02] Revelation and and so we we know in the
[38:04] 36th verse it says their knops and their
[38:07] branches shall be of the same all it
[38:10] shall be of one beaten work of pure gold
[38:14] and thou shalt make the seven lamps
[38:17] thereof and they shall uhh light the
[38:19] lamps thereof that they may give light
[38:22] over against it and the tongues thereof
[38:26] and the uh um snuff dish thereof shall
[38:30] be a pure gold of a talent of pure gold
[38:33] shall he make it with all these vessels
[38:37] in other words that's all he gave him a
[38:38] talent of pure gold amen and I think
[38:42] that may
[38:43] weigh perhaps what a what a what a what
[38:46] a a uh five or six year old person may
[38:50] weigh of a talent of gold shall be M
[38:53] make it and with all these vessels and
[38:56] look that thou make them after their
[38:59] pattern which was showed thee in the
[39:02] mount now I'm going to go back here
[39:03] because something is being read here and
[39:06] and I want to make sure it's according
[39:07] to uh the way I have it in my
[39:10] Bible because there's really something I
[39:12] really want to bring out by God's
[39:16] grace that's why I don't I don't like
[39:19] revised stuff
[39:32] you love the Lord so anyway we'll just
[39:35] go ahead on we we see by God's grace
[39:38] that everything had to be made according
[39:40] to the pattern nothing could could uh uh
[39:44] take away uh from this and and we we're
[39:48] going to read by God's grace where this
[39:51] uh Candlestick was referred to as his
[39:56] his a is masculine so it had nothing to
[40:00] do with the feminine but it was his
[40:03] design and so uh you said what is a
[40:07] vision and and we know about what
[40:09] brother bam tells us that a vision is
[40:11] given to us amen it's it's symbolic some
[40:14] things like like like in the Book of
[40:16] Revelation all uh The Book of Revelation
[40:19] practically is given in in a symbolic
[40:22] way in other words in order to
[40:24] understand it there's a powerful
[40:26] Revelation behind find it but only God
[40:30] can give you that Revelation how many of
[40:32] y'all remember the time I think this
[40:34] individual had cancer and brother
[40:36] brandham was praying for the person and
[40:39] all of a sudden a a a rotten apple
[40:42] appeared in in the m a mid the middle of
[40:45] the air and he didn't know what it was
[40:47] and and and that that that uh uh Apple
[40:50] represented the the sickness of that
[40:52] person and you know he prayed and then
[40:56] all of a sudden the that was rotten
[40:58] became holy and that that gave victory
[41:00] over the the particular sin I mean the
[41:02] particular sickness so you and I must
[41:04] understand by God's grace that every
[41:06] time God show you something most of the
[41:09] time it's something that needs to be
[41:12] revealed you understand me now when we
[41:14] talk about the vision of the golden
[41:17] candlesticks or the vision of the
[41:20] lampstand we we'll go to Zachariah let's
[41:23] go to Zechariah so Zachariah seeing the
[41:26] same vision amen that uh that was given
[41:30] to Moses but he's seing this in his own
[41:33] time in his own
[41:35] day the very same vision and why was
[41:38] this golden Candlestick what what made
[41:41] this why was this not put into the
[41:43] holies of
[41:46] holies see because this represent Christ
[41:50] or I could
[41:52] say Christ in
[41:56] humanity that that's what this represent
[41:58] Christ in humanity where God used men to
[42:03] reflect his light and we know that the
[42:07] oil and the light and the lamps they
[42:09] always had to be
[42:10] lit right so we say oh what do you mean
[42:13] well when you find out amen that in the
[42:16] book of St Matthew the 25th chapter when
[42:19] the foolish virgins lamp went
[42:22] out it was it was symbolic that
[42:25] somewhere the oil was gone that's right
[42:28] and the oil represents the Holy
[42:31] Spirit everything was gold golden oil
[42:34] golden lamp gold and everything was gold
[42:37] and understand it was beaten gold wasn't
[42:40] something that was just you know
[42:42] manufactured no no no no it was go try
[42:45] like the Bible says come in Revelation
[42:48] 3rd Chapter receive this word you'll be
[42:51] like gold tried in the fire beaten WTH
[42:55] gold that's what God uses he takes deity
[42:59] that's that's full of dirt and he beats
[43:01] the dirt out of you and that's what God
[43:04] has done for us because of these human
[43:07] bodies starting with uh Zechariah the
[43:10] 4th chapter beginning the first verse
[43:12] and the angel that talked with me came
[43:14] again and waked me as a man that was
[43:18] waken out of sleep and said unto me what
[43:21] seeth thou and I said I looked and
[43:25] behold a candlestick
[43:27] all of gold with a bowl upon the top of
[43:31] it and see what I'm saying and his seven
[43:34] lamps thereof thereon and seven pipes to
[43:39] the seven lamps which are upon the top
[43:43] thereof and two olive trees by it one
[43:47] upon the right side of the bowl and the
[43:50] other upon the left side of the bowl and
[43:53] you said well who are these olive trees
[43:56] well what is this all about it's all
[43:59] about the ministry of Christ from
[44:02] Genesis to Revelation it's about what
[44:05] Jesus Christ was going to do and here he
[44:08] had this golden Candlestick representing
[44:11] himself and basically telling us what he
[44:14] was going to do but without a prophet
[44:17] you wouldn't know you wouldn't
[44:20] understand it and so God goes to
[44:22] Zechariah and says he gives him a vision
[44:24] and he sees it now understand Zachariah
[44:28] is a Jew he've seen the golden
[44:32] Candlestick was part of perhaps part of
[44:34] the
[44:35] service he may not have been able to
[44:38] handle it because of the the the
[44:40] priesthood but my point is he's seen it
[44:43] all the Jews know what the Candlestick
[44:45] look like you know we call it the manure
[44:48] but the point is God is saying I want to
[44:50] draw your attention to this so that you
[44:54] can understand what this is is all
[44:59] about all
[45:03] right and he
[45:05] says uh it goes on it says and the two
[45:07] olive trees by it one upon the right
[45:10] side of the bowl and the other upon the
[45:12] left side thereof so I answered and
[45:15] spake to the angel that talked with me
[45:17] saying what are these Lord since you're
[45:21] bringing this to my attention tell me
[45:23] what they are cuz I have no idea and
[45:26] that's the way it is with Israel they
[45:28] they had the rituals uh they they they
[45:30] didn't understand what it was all about
[45:33] if the Jews would have known that these
[45:36] animals that were being slain and killed
[45:40] and their blood was being shed uh was
[45:43] for the remission of their sins if they
[45:45] fully understood that they would have
[45:47] never given God lamed animals for
[45:51] sacrifice and Israel throughout history
[45:54] got to the place they tried to
[45:55] commercialize God
[45:57] uh Salvation And when they
[46:00] commercialized it they lost all the
[46:02] feeling there was nothing there that's
[46:04] why God said with your mouth you praise
[46:07] me you give me thanks with your mouth
[46:09] but your heart is far from me because
[46:13] they be it became such a religion they
[46:16] lost touch with God right there's a time
[46:19] when the shikina glory would come down
[46:21] and they would be so you know excited
[46:24] about it but you did you ever notice for
[46:27] for hundreds of years the shakina glory
[46:30] didn't show up and it didn't bother
[46:33] Israel you understand me it didn't
[46:36] bother them they went on with their
[46:38] religion and see when the Holy Ghost
[46:40] doesn't come in your service you ought
[46:43] to be
[46:44] concerned when the Shaka doesn't come
[46:46] down that means something ain't quite
[46:48] right the sacrifice something's out of
[46:51] order something's out of place and and
[46:53] because God is not sitting down and
[46:54] dropping his fire but find out even in
[46:57] the message we get to a place well it's
[47:00] okay it's we we like it's religion you
[47:02] know we got it I'm I'm message I'm right
[47:05] but you see that's the wrong attitude
[47:08] God don't want your feelings just like
[47:10] how can I say it like this he when it
[47:12] comes to Samson in the Book of Judges
[47:15] brother bandam say Samson gave God his
[47:18] strength God but God wanted his heart
[47:23] God don't need oh I can be this I can be
[47:25] that in the church oh I can move chairs
[47:27] I could be the all of that's good but
[47:30] God that
[47:32] doesn't what God wants us to do is give
[47:34] his heart even if you're not doing
[47:37] anything give God your heart never ever
[47:42] let this message become common to you
[47:45] that's right when it becomes common you
[47:48] become
[47:49] lukewarm and God is now in a position to
[47:53] spew you out of his
[47:55] mouth mhm
[47:57] H so I answered and spake of to the
[48:00] angel that talked to me saying what are
[48:03] these my Lord then the angel that talked
[48:06] with me answered and said unto me
[48:09] knowest thou not what these be and I
[48:12] said no my Lord you understand me here
[48:16] was Zachariah who should have known amen
[48:20] what they meant somebody was lacking in
[48:22] their spiritual Revelation somebody was
[48:25] lacking in their standing because that's
[48:28] the way the angel was answered to him as
[48:30] if he should have known what that was
[48:33] all about excuse
[48:35] me what that was all about and he did
[48:38] not then he answered and spake unto him
[48:41] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[48:44] zerubabel saying not by might not by
[48:48] power but by my spirit sayth the Lord
[48:53] hallelujah why because you must
[48:56] understand that this was the main
[48:59] source of all of the others and even
[49:03] though they ministered one to another
[49:05] this is why it was built this way to
[49:07] show that these were
[49:10] connected so much so that Revelation
[49:13] says that he had them in the palm of
[49:15] their hand his hands seven
[49:19] Messengers
[49:21] amen but one
[49:24] body inspired by what one Holy Spirit
[49:30] and to show you that this really tied
[49:32] all the way into the Old Testament
[49:34] brother R tells us he said Moses was
[49:37] Christ David was Christ all of those who
[49:40] did Mighty Works were Christ they were
[49:43] representatives of
[49:45] Zabo and zorub means Amen to to to to
[49:50] disperse right and and and listen what
[49:54] was this whole thing about even though
[49:56] you were born in bondage because the
[49:59] theu also means a stranger in Babylon is
[50:03] that right and remember Israel was a
[50:05] stranger in Babylon why because they had
[50:09] fallen to the wickedness of of the world
[50:12] and God judged them for it but it didn't
[50:16] matter whether they were born there or
[50:18] not God still raised up people like
[50:20] Shadrach me and abedo David I mean
[50:24] excuse me um and the rest of them Daniel
[50:27] and all what was it God you know he was
[50:30] showing
[50:31] listen oh that there might be a great
[50:34] Mountain standing before you but he says
[50:37] listen I'll make that mountain a plain
[50:40] see that's what God is saying to the
[50:41] real seat of God it doesn't matter
[50:44] zerubu is here amen Jesus Christ is here
[50:48] the almighty God had already set it out
[50:50] in a in a plan and nothing can come
[50:53] short of what he purposed it to be
[50:59] nothing right then he answer and SP to
[51:02] him he said this is the word of the Lord
[51:03] of to not by my power not well whose
[51:07] power who is it from what what but by my
[51:09] spirit not by your theology not by your
[51:12] church not by your strength nothing you
[51:14] can produce that's going to make this
[51:16] thing happen the only way it's going to
[51:19] happen is by my spirit amen absolutely
[51:23] he said Thou Art who art thou oh great
[51:26] Mountain before zerubu thou shall become
[51:29] a plain and he shall bring forth The
[51:32] Headstone thereof with shouting Grace
[51:35] Grace unto it what was it two comings of
[51:37] Christ God is bringing Grace to us he
[51:41] brought Grace in The Becoming when he
[51:43] first came and he brings Grace when he
[51:46] comes down again Hallelujah now you say
[51:48] well what do you mean the two coming of
[51:49] Christ remember when you say you see the
[51:51] scripture says with shouting that means
[51:54] amen God had a forerunner he always had
[51:57] a forerunner he had Elijah he had John
[52:00] the Baptist in the first Forerunner
[52:02] right right he said the Bible said
[52:04] crying one crying in the wilderness that
[52:06] was John the Baptist is that right and
[52:09] the second coming he had another crying
[52:11] another shouting crying what Grace Grace
[52:14] who was it William brandham he comes
[52:16] along and he's the second but he's
[52:18] Elijah he's Elijah The Same Spirit who
[52:23] you said well what do you mean that's
[52:24] what the Bible says now who was the two
[52:26] all branches who are they who are they
[52:30] remember Moses and Elijah that's who
[52:32] they are amen Moses amen was a how can I
[52:36] say
[52:37] it a represented Christ in other words
[52:40] it he was so connected to even when
[52:43] Jesus came they were saying did Moses
[52:46] say this yall understand me and then who
[52:49] was the other
[52:51] Elijah right Moses and Elijah amen from
[52:54] the beginning to the ending amen was the
[52:57] representatives of Christ until Jesus
[52:59] Christ came himself you said I don't
[53:02] believe that didn't follow me to Mount
[53:04] Transfiguration Amen on Mount
[53:07] Transfiguration amen what was it it was
[53:09] Moses and Elijah standing there by the
[53:13] Candlestick Hallelujah and Jesus showed
[53:16] that the power of the Candlestick did
[53:18] not come from Moses it did not come from
[53:21] Elijah but the Bible said when that
[53:23] Peter James and John looked up all they
[53:27] did see was Jesus only see he is the
[53:33] Candlestick hallelujah what is it what
[53:36] was it Moses was a lawgiver is that
[53:39] right he represented the dead in Christ
[53:43] in other words Moses and Elijah
[53:45] represented the full ministry of Jesus
[53:48] Christ himself in his he came the Bible
[53:52] said he the dead in Christ shall rise is
[53:55] that right and those that remain they
[53:58] shall be what
[53:59] quickened so Moses represented the dead
[54:02] in Christ his ministry he was a lawgiver
[54:06] is that right and and that's what it was
[54:08] because he died something happened to
[54:10] him but he rose again even so much so
[54:13] that the devil looked for his body and
[54:14] could not find him Hallelujah but when
[54:18] it came to Elijah he was a quickening
[54:21] huh is that right amen he rose on the
[54:24] Char of fire right he took a Rapture
[54:27] Hallelujah without death see so they two
[54:31] were standing there by Jesus
[54:34] himself Hallelujah so what happens when
[54:37] Jesus come for his bride and quickens us
[54:40] and take us up he still leaves the
[54:43] representative of
[54:45] himself Moses and Elijah and I got back
[54:47] I don't got ahead of
[54:49] myself oh my is that right moreover the
[54:53] word of the Lord came to me saying the
[54:56] hand of zerubabel have laid the
[54:57] foundation of his house his hand shall
[55:00] also finish it is that right so
[55:03] zerubabel is a type and a representative
[55:05] of Jesus Christ himself he is the
[55:08] Builder he is the maker he said I go to
[55:10] prepare a place for you that where I am
[55:13] there you might be also and he that
[55:15] begun the good work in you is faithful
[55:18] to complete it only
[55:20] one only one not two not three just one
[55:25] who's creating and is that right the
[55:27] Bible says we are created in
[55:30] him
[55:32] Hallelujah right the hand of zba have
[55:35] laid the foundation of this house his
[55:37] hand shall also finish it and thou shalt
[55:39] know that the Lord of hosts have sent me
[55:42] unto you right so zerubu represents
[55:46] everyone who helped build this house
[55:50] from Genesis to
[55:52] Revelation right and zerubba as I said
[55:55] means a stranger at Bon it also means to
[55:57] disperse confusion and that's exactly
[56:00] what Elijah did especially when it came
[56:03] to Jezebel right he stood there on Mount
[56:06] carel And he says all for the Lord he
[56:08] said I want you to build an altar and
[56:10] I'll build an altar and they all had the
[56:12] same kind of stuff he said but one was
[56:14] claiming to be of God and and one the
[56:16] other one's claiming to be of God he
[56:17] says I tell you what let the god that
[56:19] answer by fire Hallelujah let him be God
[56:23] and that's the what the prophet of God
[56:25] is saying right now now amen the go
[56:28] those who are right before God God will
[56:30] answer them by fire he can't change
[56:34] Hallelujah it doesn't matter what
[56:36] everybody else is claiming to be but
[56:38] Mount Zion Showdown is the one the fire
[56:41] falls on Hallelujah glory to God right
[56:46] so what happens brother ROM comes and he
[56:49] disperses all the
[56:51] confusion godhead marriage and divorce
[56:55] cre ation everybody think you you you
[56:58] came from a monkey or something no there
[57:00] was no Evolution as such we know when we
[57:02] came by by the spoken word of God all
[57:05] right so you know all of those kind of
[57:07] things that that we we didn't understand
[57:09] how the church got in such a fix how you
[57:12] know because in the earlier days they
[57:14] thought the white Hearts writer was
[57:17] Jesus Hallelujah and we find out through
[57:19] the opening of the word the white horse
[57:21] rider was not
[57:23] Jesus it was the Antichrist he was a guy
[57:26] disguising himself because it's turned
[57:29] from white to Red Hallelujah from red to
[57:33] Black then from all those colors came
[57:36] mixing what was it when that horse
[57:38] finished riding his name changed and now
[57:41] he was called death and so we understand
[57:44] what was it it was a spiritual
[57:46] Antichrist coming in now what you what
[57:49] are you
[57:50] saying this
[57:53] candelabra I'll put it this way this
[57:55] Manor
[57:57] right one of the things that it was used
[57:59] for it sheded light not only in just the
[58:02] holy place but it gave light to the
[58:05] entrance to the holies of
[58:08] holies and without this you couldn't see
[58:11] nothing right and understand that that
[58:14] seven Church age messenger Hallelujah
[58:17] was the light there shall be light in
[58:20] the evening time it wasn't him it was
[58:22] the Life of Christ shining through him
[58:26] one oil ain't there no changeing no you
[58:29] know seven different kind of Holy Ghost
[58:30] ain't number one Holy Ghost and all that
[58:34] oil has to be all in this same oil I
[58:38] can't get a different holy ghost in the
[58:39] man before me no sir no
[58:43] sir see so what was it you and I were
[58:46] born into Babylon born in captivity but
[58:50] God brought us out Hallelujah and guess
[58:53] what he's going to finish the building
[58:55] for who have despised the day of small
[58:57] things for they shall rejoice and shall
[59:00] see the plummet in the hand of zerubba
[59:03] with those seven eyes they are the eyes
[59:05] of the Lord which run to and fro from
[59:07] the whole earth and we know what that is
[59:09] the seven spirits of God the seven
[59:11] Church age Messengers and you know all
[59:13] that God has done throughout the age
[59:16] ages amen it was still the eye of God
[59:19] watching the allseeing eye watching and
[59:22] seeing everything now what thing that I
[59:24] love about uh uh uh Elijah is that
[59:28] because Elijah had the spirit of
[59:30] judging and he judged Jezebel and he
[59:33] told Jezebel what was going to happen to
[59:36] her the dog is going to lick your blood
[59:40] right and we know who Jezebel is right
[59:43] right we know Ahab was was the
[59:45] Pentecostals and Jezebel was the
[59:47] Catholics right now what's happening now
[59:50] they're moving in such a way and guess
[59:52] what they coming after
[59:53] us right and you remember the the time
[59:56] when je uh the mount Karma showed down
[59:59] how that uh Elijah was just powerful
[1:00:01] powerful as soon as he come down amen he
[1:00:04] heard that Jezebel was coming after him
[1:00:07] Jezebel gonna kill you boy what happened
[1:00:09] he ran he was afraid why because the
[1:00:13] anointing had left him see we ain't
[1:00:15] nothing without the anointing nothing
[1:00:18] nothing no matter how powerful you think
[1:00:19] you are you're nothing and let me tell
[1:00:22] you something no one Church nothing will
[1:00:25] be able to stop the Catholic Church in
[1:00:26] his move except Jesus Christ himself
[1:00:30] that's your
[1:00:31] Bible yeah now I'm going get in trouble
[1:00:34] with this after a while because it's
[1:00:35] getting pretty close to his coming and
[1:00:38] and the closer he gets the more
[1:00:39] dangerous these words become but it's
[1:00:42] still truth is truth what you going to
[1:00:43] do about it we're not against people
[1:00:46] it's the system right it's not the
[1:00:49] people there's wonderful people in those
[1:00:50] churches I've got friends like that but
[1:00:52] you see what you it's not listen the
[1:00:56] Protestant churches are worse than the
[1:00:58] Catholic
[1:00:59] now oh what they do Catholics wouldn't
[1:01:02] dare
[1:01:04] do not in
[1:01:06] church but anyway let's move on so we
[1:01:09] understand the daughters is like the
[1:01:10] mother right so we find out amen that
[1:01:13] what happened is we see those seven eyes
[1:01:16] where the which which which the the word
[1:01:19] of God came the seven Thunders the Seven
[1:01:21] Seals all those things were part of that
[1:01:24] grand revelation of Jesus
[1:01:26] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:01:31] forever then answered I and said unto
[1:01:34] him what are these two olive trees upon
[1:01:37] the right side of the candlesticks and
[1:01:39] upon the left side and I just told you
[1:01:41] and he answered again and said unto him
[1:01:43] what be these two Olive branches which
[1:01:46] through the two uh two golden pipes
[1:01:48] empty uh the the golden oil out of
[1:01:51] themselves and so what was it he was
[1:01:53] saying they they so remember brother
[1:01:55] Rand was that kind that literally
[1:01:57] emptied himself out especially when the
[1:02:00] discernment came they had to pick him up
[1:02:03] they had to carry him out he says it
[1:02:05] ain't me it's him but whatever was in
[1:02:08] him he gave it all to the people and
[1:02:10] what was it he was pouring out the oil
[1:02:12] amen and that oil as as God uh
[1:02:15] replenished it he was pouring it out and
[1:02:18] there was such a relationship between
[1:02:20] Elijah and Jesus Christ that can I put
[1:02:23] it this way no wedge could come between
[1:02:28] them and there were times amen when the
[1:02:31] prophecies went out Moses and Elijah is
[1:02:33] in the
[1:02:35] building I'm sure everybody was looking
[1:02:37] around but there was a revelation behind
[1:02:40] that because Christ was Moses and Elijah
[1:02:44] that's right Hallelujah so let's move
[1:02:47] on you love the Lord then he goes on and
[1:02:51] said in the 13th verse and he answered
[1:02:52] me and said knoweth thou not what these
[1:02:56] be and I said no my Lord then he then
[1:02:59] said he these are the two anointed ones
[1:03:02] that stand by the lord of the whole
[1:03:05] earth so who was the one in the
[1:03:09] middle stood in the middle even
[1:03:11] according to Revelations he was in the
[1:03:14] midst of the golden
[1:03:15] candlesticks it was
[1:03:17] him he was the one Jesus Christ the same
[1:03:21] yesterday today and forever that's why
[1:03:23] when the prophet of God God gave him the
[1:03:25] reation that Jesus Christ of the new uh
[1:03:28] Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus
[1:03:30] Christ of the new y'all get what I'm
[1:03:33] saying you know when did God lose his
[1:03:35] power when did God lose his authority
[1:03:38] when did God forget where you are and
[1:03:40] what you're doing where when did God
[1:03:43] Amen blink and and and and didn't didn't
[1:03:45] see what you were doing in other words
[1:03:47] he's all and in all amen and the same
[1:03:51] anointing that flow through these seven
[1:03:54] golden candles St must flow through us
[1:04:00] right Hallelujah prophecy right that's
[1:04:04] what this this was all about was The
[1:04:06] Prophecy of the Messiah and his working
[1:04:09] it was the completion of the ministry of
[1:04:11] Jesus Christ and we didn't know that but
[1:04:14] in when God worked with Zachariah
[1:04:17] because now he's showing Zachariah is
[1:04:19] more to the manora than you think it's
[1:04:22] not just you going in there or priest
[1:04:24] going in there and light n you know
[1:04:26] making sure that there's this thing
[1:04:28] never goes out it was more to it and he
[1:04:32] showed that this represented Jesus
[1:04:34] Christ gold beaten gold
[1:04:39] fashion and and and and and all you know
[1:04:42] it was a it was a certain amount of
[1:04:45] gold which was a talent that He had to
[1:04:48] make not only this but all of the others
[1:04:52] pieces so you say what how can it be I
[1:04:55] don't know the figures I don't know the
[1:04:57] mathematics but it does show one thing
[1:05:01] that everything that was made from that
[1:05:03] go was symbolic that everything came
[1:05:05] from
[1:05:06] God everything came from God it was
[1:05:10] deity in the beginning and his deity in
[1:05:12] the end see amen Zachariah was the what
[1:05:16] was the Fulfillment of Zachariah that's
[1:05:18] that was Mount uh Matthew 17 and I'm on
[1:05:20] one
[1:05:22] time even though Zachariah Saw s
[1:05:25] symbolically what was going on the
[1:05:27] Fulfillment of his vision was on Mount
[1:05:31] Transfiguration let's read
[1:05:33] it beginning 17 Matthew 17 1-5 and then
[1:05:37] I'll be pretty much
[1:05:44] done and this is the part that we ought
[1:05:46] to really like and after six days Jesus
[1:05:50] Take Peter James and John his brother
[1:05:53] right faith hope and charity
[1:05:56] right right faith hope and charity and
[1:05:59] bring them up into a high mountain apart
[1:06:02] and that's what brother R talk about
[1:06:04] adoption right he talks about us
[1:06:06] receiving adoption and when he after six
[1:06:09] days is where we are now after six days
[1:06:12] this is where we are after six
[1:06:16] days right justification sanctification
[1:06:20] and then what baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:26] and was transfigured before them and his
[1:06:29] face did shine as the sun and his
[1:06:31] reignment was white as the light what
[1:06:33] was happening it was a
[1:06:35] manifestation of God or Christ theophany
[1:06:39] glorified what with the light
[1:06:41] Illuminating what was he trying to show
[1:06:43] Peter James and John this is
[1:06:46] you right if if all they saw was Jesus
[1:06:51] and Jesus was illuminated and you're the
[1:06:53] body of Christ he was RI lit showing
[1:06:57] what this Calvary was
[1:07:00] producing trying to give them light and
[1:07:02] understanding I'm I'm not here just to
[1:07:04] be another one of your Jewish Brethren I
[1:07:07] came here for a work and you must
[1:07:11] understand that this work will bring you
[1:07:13] back to your glorified state right and
[1:07:16] it wasn't done in a in a valley it was
[1:07:19] done on a
[1:07:20] mountain and that's exactly where Mount
[1:07:23] Zion will be on a mountain
[1:07:27] Hallelujah and was transfigured before
[1:07:30] them and his face did shine as the sun
[1:07:33] and his reignment was white as the light
[1:07:35] and behold there appeared unto him what
[1:07:37] who Moses and Elijah now here it is the
[1:07:40] two candlesticks the two uh uh olive
[1:07:43] trees and remember olive trees Olive
[1:07:46] represents Jewish Jews right so you see
[1:07:50] these same olive trees will be seen I
[1:07:52] think it's in Revelation uh 21
[1:07:56] amen and um uh and and in Revelation 21
[1:07:59] it it tells us how these olive trees
[1:08:01] come to being and then you know one had
[1:08:04] the power of Moses and one had the
[1:08:06] authority of Elijah right the world
[1:08:10] hated them because they brought such
[1:08:12] judgment on the oil and such judgment on
[1:08:14] the world that they wanted them dead and
[1:08:17] the Bible says they literally came to a
[1:08:20] place where they killed
[1:08:21] him let me tell you
[1:08:23] something they might think overpowered
[1:08:26] God but they thought they overpowered
[1:08:28] God when Jesus was crucified too and
[1:08:32] what was happening Jesus gave them right
[1:08:35] to do it that was their job to submit to
[1:08:38] death and so it is with Moses and Elijah
[1:08:41] to submit to death and then after a
[1:08:43] while in three days what happened three
[1:08:45] and a half I believe it is they raise
[1:08:47] up you know I was so shocked because
[1:08:50] you'll find that even in the last of the
[1:08:51] scripture some of the the people that
[1:08:53] was there actually uh sound like they
[1:08:56] was trying to
[1:08:59] repent amazing but before they threw a
[1:09:02] party did you know that when Moses and
[1:09:04] Elijah was killed land in the street
[1:09:07] that show how quick Wicked and cold the
[1:09:09] world has would will
[1:09:12] be that they would throw a world party
[1:09:16] Glory oh my mind it's
[1:09:18] terrible right
[1:09:26] and behold they appeared unto Moses and
[1:09:28] elij Elias talking with him and then
[1:09:30] answered Peter and said unto to Jesus
[1:09:33] Lord is is good for us to be here if
[1:09:35] thou wi let us make here three
[1:09:37] Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses
[1:09:40] and one for Elijah and see how conal we
[1:09:42] are even under that inspiration let me
[1:09:44] tell you something there was there would
[1:09:46] be no way that you could be in the
[1:09:47] presence of God and not feel the
[1:09:50] anointing and yet you come out with such
[1:09:52] a carnal thought that's your show you
[1:09:55] how frail we are you know we come to a
[1:09:58] place where we need God at all times
[1:10:02] amen and while he yet spake Behold a
[1:10:05] bright Cloud overshadowed them and
[1:10:07] behold a voice out of the cloud which
[1:10:09] said this is my beloved Son in whom I am
[1:10:11] well pleased hear ye him what was he
[1:10:15] saying he is
[1:10:17] God hear ye
[1:10:19] him he's the final Authority hear ye him
[1:10:24] is that right that's that's why Jesus
[1:10:25] said all power in Heaven and Earth is
[1:10:28] given unto me what the golden
[1:10:31] Candlestick
[1:10:34] his woo and when the disciples heard it
[1:10:38] they fell on their
[1:10:40] faces and were so afraid and Jesus came
[1:10:43] and touched them and says arise and be
[1:10:45] not afraid and when they had lifted up
[1:10:48] their eyes they saw no man save Jesus
[1:10:51] only what was it the anointing of Moses
[1:10:55] and Elijah flow through Christ through
[1:10:57] the whole time or excuse me the
[1:11:00] anointing and uh God's Christ anointing
[1:11:03] excuse me flow through Moses and Elijah
[1:11:05] they were
[1:11:07] connected the Forerunner of their their
[1:11:09] day they were the forerunners amen
[1:11:12] that's why Moses was God he say I'm
[1:11:14] going to make you God into Pharaoh I'm
[1:11:15] going to make you God un Egypt and Moses
[1:11:18] was the one under the anointing of
[1:11:20] Christ the bible say that was Christ in
[1:11:22] the wilderness amen that Del deliver the
[1:11:25] children and that's where he came to
[1:11:27] deliver us out of Egypt Amen to deliver
[1:11:30] us out of bondage to deliver us out of
[1:11:33] the Grave
[1:11:34] Hallelujah the forun of their day see
[1:11:37] they were and all all of the the the
[1:11:40] representative of Christ was the same
[1:11:42] and we're just going to read this last
[1:11:43] scripture and let you go Revelation 11
[1:11:47] 3-6 and I will give power unto the two
[1:11:50] witnesses and they shall prophesy
[1:11:54] 1,23 score days clothed in in sa cloth
[1:11:57] and these are the two olive trees and
[1:11:59] the two candlesticks standing before God
[1:12:02] on the earth and if any man will hurt
[1:12:04] them the fire proceeded out of their
[1:12:06] mouth and devour their enemies who where
[1:12:09] what what where the fire come from
[1:12:11] Elijah law said Elijah said Lord Let the
[1:12:13] Fire Fall right right so what happens
[1:12:17] and if any man will hurt them he must in
[1:12:21] this manner be killed these having power
[1:12:24] to shut heaven that it rain not in the
[1:12:26] days of the prophecy and have power over
[1:12:29] Waters to turn to blood that's Moses and
[1:12:31] to Smite the Earth with plagues as often
[1:12:34] as they will as often as what they will
[1:12:37] Gods right and when they shall have
[1:12:40] finished their testimony the Beast that
[1:12:42] ascended out of the bottomless pit shall
[1:12:45] make war against them and shall overcome
[1:12:48] them and kill them so I say all of this
[1:12:50] to say when we talk about the Arc of the
[1:12:52] Covenant we talk about the outer Court
[1:12:54] the inner Court all of this is about
[1:12:56] worship all of it worship who Jesus
[1:13:00] Christ right all power in Heaven and
[1:13:03] Earth is given unto me and what happens
[1:13:06] now you go behind the veil all you see
[1:13:08] is what just a shakina of
[1:13:11] Glory you see the swept the angels with
[1:13:14] the swept back Wings the law the of the
[1:13:16] testimony and you know and and what is
[1:13:19] it is the word anointed and that's where
[1:13:21] we are now we must become the word
[1:13:24] anointed anointed you keep you know all
[1:13:26] of this is praise but God won't worship
[1:13:30] they that worship me must worship me in
[1:13:33] spirit and in truth and you can't
[1:13:35] worship God in spirit and truth without
[1:13:37] a
[1:13:38] prophet and it takes a prophet because
[1:13:41] that's who the word of the Lord comes to
[1:13:43] and when he speaks he's speaking this
[1:13:45] Bible he a he's not changing it he's
[1:13:48] giving you the sh kind of Glory
[1:13:50] revelation of
[1:13:51] it that's what he's doing and it takes
[1:13:54] people don't understand they refused
[1:13:57] when they refused him they refused
[1:14:01] Heaven every Everybody ref refused Moses
[1:14:04] everybody refused Noah everybody that
[1:14:07] refused Jesus everybody that refused
[1:14:09] Paul all of them they were connected and
[1:14:12] they didn't have a word of their own the
[1:14:14] word in which they spoke was a word that
[1:14:17] was given to them by shakina it was
[1:14:19] shakina that illuminated this Bible that
[1:14:23] Luther said oh my goodness the just
[1:14:25] shall live by faith that was always in
[1:14:28] the
[1:14:29] Bible why did everybody before him see
[1:14:31] it it wasn't the
[1:14:34] time now we we was at a junction and God
[1:14:37] was going to do some great things and he
[1:14:39] did it right now we're at another
[1:14:42] Junction where people don't even they
[1:14:44] they can't they can't even get excited I
[1:14:47] had a brother talk to me today and I was
[1:14:48] talking to him really you know he said I
[1:14:50] need God he says brother brother books
[1:14:52] is like this he said if I was in the
[1:14:53] road and a car was coming and somebody
[1:14:56] said hey better get out of the road a
[1:14:59] car is coming he said what do you think
[1:15:01] I'm going to do he said it all depends
[1:15:04] on the way I judge it in other words if
[1:15:07] I feel like that car is far away I might
[1:15:09] just take my time to cross the street or
[1:15:12] might even stand there for a bit before
[1:15:13] I do it he said but if I could see that
[1:15:16] car close up I'm going to run and get
[1:15:18] out of that street see and that's the
[1:15:20] way people see it they know the car
[1:15:23] coming but in their minds they giving it
[1:15:25] a distance when it's so close now when
[1:15:29] it's really close and you don't see the
[1:15:31] distance that's what animals do they
[1:15:32] don't see the distance of the automobile
[1:15:34] and they run into the street cuz
[1:15:37] something blinding their their
[1:15:39] comprehension of what's happening and
[1:15:41] that's what happening to to the people
[1:15:42] in the message right now they see the
[1:15:44] distance they think it's a long way down
[1:15:46] the road and so they're not moving as
[1:15:48] fast as they should and a lot of them
[1:15:49] going to get hit by the
[1:15:52] car but those of us who see it you get
[1:15:55] out of the street and you and wait till
[1:15:56] the car pass
[1:15:57] you right you're not going to be D doing
[1:16:00] and ducking it right cuz you've already
[1:16:02] gotten out of the street and that's what
[1:16:04] we're trying to get the people to see
[1:16:05] get out of the street the car is coming
[1:16:09] we see this thing moving and is moving
[1:16:11] at a fast pace and if you don't know who
[1:16:13] you are these things that we're we're
[1:16:15] working with right now they you know
[1:16:17] they may not I'm not trying to excite
[1:16:19] you I'm trying to place you I'm trying
[1:16:21] to let you see where you're standing and
[1:16:24] what this thing is all about how God
[1:16:26] went through all these uh works and
[1:16:28] things to bring you to a place where the
[1:16:30] holies of holies you getting a
[1:16:32] revelation of yourself because that's
[1:16:34] the greatest Revelation you can get amen
[1:16:37] it's good to know about Paul and the
[1:16:39] rest of them but brother brandom in that
[1:16:40] quote says when the Bride Comes to know
[1:16:42] who she
[1:16:45] is when she comes to know who she is and
[1:16:48] who is she she is the real Queen of
[1:16:50] Heaven she is the word the the the uh of
[1:16:55] Christ let's stand she is you got to
[1:16:58] come to know that all of these things
[1:16:59] have been done for you I've been seeing
[1:17:01] things like this for a long time you
[1:17:03] know every time I would see the Ark of
[1:17:05] the Covenant I could see the bride
[1:17:07] sitting on her throne that's what I
[1:17:10] saw that's what I saw when I saw those
[1:17:13] uh Angels am Meen those uh with the uh
[1:17:16] those wings covering you know the Ark of
[1:17:19] the Covenant and and and you know
[1:17:20] coverting the mercy seat and all that
[1:17:22] and I kept The Mercy Seat where was the
[1:17:25] blood on the mercy
[1:17:27] seat right and then you see that bread
[1:17:31] sitting on a
[1:17:32] table and on that table amen it the lid
[1:17:36] of the table is gold and why when you
[1:17:39] sit bread on a on a on a piece of gold
[1:17:42] it was showing that the deity of it it
[1:17:45] literally took the gold was something to
[1:17:48] attract you to the bread and that bread
[1:17:50] represented Christ it it is you you part
[1:17:53] of the bread that's why he says I'm
[1:17:54] breaking this and I'm giving you this
[1:17:56] I'm giving you this I'm giving you this
[1:17:57] but you know what it's just come to a
[1:17:59] place where if Christ can't excite you
[1:18:01] nothing
[1:18:02] can it has to be God in you you know it
[1:18:06] has to be this is not a a a thing oh
[1:18:08] well I've heard that before whatever you
[1:18:10] might be thinking I don't know but I'm
[1:18:11] telling you now amen it's a reason why
