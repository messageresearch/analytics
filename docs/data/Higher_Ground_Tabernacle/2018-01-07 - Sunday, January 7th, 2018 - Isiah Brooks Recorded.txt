the gates trying to press his way in to get a yield to this or yield to that we're always watching and waiting amen to yield only to the Lord Jesus Christ amen Isaiah chapter 56 we read the first and second verse and it says here verse 1 thus saith the Lord keep a judgment and do justice for my salvation is near to come and my righteousness to be revealed blessed is the man that do with this and the son son of man delay it hold on it that keepeth the Sabbath from and keepeth his hand from doing any evil amen let's just power heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just want to thank you

some made us in your own image father or a place where your word could come forth Lord Lord where is praying Lord for that this morning father to happen Lord the you lordy you said through your prophet Lord that you would keep every single appointment father Lord that you would make an appointment with us Lord where two or three are gathered together there are you will be right in the midst

then we'll be satisfied when we awake to see you and your image father in us in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you can be seated amen as reading this isaiah 50:6 a few weeks ago and something about just kind of grabbed ahold of me and I wrote some things down I said someday I'm going to preach on this said no wasn't me so soon and by this there's these two verses I just I really enjoy I went through them word by word both of these verses here verse 1 and verse 2 and I just I'd like to speak kind of just go through slowly verse 1 begins with thus saith the Lord I think everybody here is listened to enough of the messages I don't think there's really any strangers amongst us this morning we've all heard the message we've heard what brother Branham and said we know what the voice is said in this day we've we've heard enough to know what we ought to do a man we've seen what what the commandment of the day is we've seen the warning for this day we've know what the warning is we know that what we are to look out for were we know what Mystery Babylon is trying to do we know the Satan is going about like a roaring lion we know where the world is headed we also know the mysteries have been revealed to us and the best mysteries have been revealed through the seven seals and and how we are to conduct our lives how we were to be filled with the Holy Ghost I would be baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ how we are to stand in the power of His Holy Ghost and how weird having done all that we can do to stand a man to stand in the power of the resurrected Messiah not to stand and in the religion of this world not to stand and the ideas of man not to stand in our own ideas but to stand throughly in what the Lord Jesus Christ has revealed unto us and whatever the Lord has revealed to us through the baptism of the Holy Ghost through the communion of face-to-face with him to stand within that revelation right there and whatever he says to do to do it wherever is thus saith the LORD to make sure that we stand with that and to do it when we see a thus saith Loris to revere that to watch over to keep it when when God speaks out thus saith Lord and no man can say thus saith Lord unless the Lord has said thus Amen you know men can go on our impressions and maybe you speak out in tongues and do this or do that but no man can say thus saith Lord unless the Lord has explicitly said this Amen and no man can take that upon himself unless the Lord has anointed that man and given him that office Amen but when a man comes forth saying thus saith Lord and every Christian I sit up and take heed and notice and watch and bless it is the generation that has enough saith Lord aleena Amen you know and and you own I think about this message and how things are balanced and how man can go too far one way or too far another way and some men will will go one way and then they'll neglect the one thing other people go the other way and neglect the other thing and then there but down right through the middle there is a right way you know and some men you know will will say well you're putting too much in a man or you're doing too much of this but we got to respect this thing we've been given a message we've been given a message through brother Branham brother bran was the prophet of our age we got to respect that and we got to respect the message that came through him when you see thus sayeth the Lord and we have to latch on to that we have to take our lives and and take that less say Florence say Lord what shall I do with this Lord how can i order my life around through this Lord lead me this way leave me that way Lord I want to be in obedience to what you have to say when we listen to the tapes we want to say and all sudden you see the Prophet saying something on the tapes and you look at your life and something your life is contrary to what is said on the tapes that we got to have respect to what the tapes say and we gotta have respect to do according to what that is why because we want to be in line with what the vision was for this day if there's a vision for how the bride is going to be when the great rapture is coming and the great rapture is coming amen the Lord is coming to take his bride away and the Lord Jesus Christ had a vision and he had a vision of what the bride what position she would be in when he comes back and then then so then he sends out a prophet with us say the Lord choose to give out the word just like he sounded thus saith the Lord let there be light and there was life there was a lot less say Florida heavens an earth was created there was a thus saith Lord where he spoke to the earth bring out all the trees and all the plants and sure enough the earth brought forth the trees and the plants there was a lot less say flora then went to the ocean once and said bring forth fishes and and although all these animals and of the sea and and sure enough the the sea brought forth fishes and swimming creatures one time with us say Florida went out to the air and all sudden there was birds flying through the air and one day the Lord said let us and God spoke to himself he said let us create man after our own image and man was created after the very image of God and that is what God is looking for when he comes God is looking for men and women when he comes back there created after the very image of the Lord Jesus Christ amen we are created in His image because we have been filled with this spirit a man we have submitted ourselves underneath the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we have been created from glory unto glory raising up into his image loving like he loved amen being godly like you is godly amen and going forth being led as Jesus said I do only that which pleases to the father whatever I see the father do that I do amen and that leadership is for every one that will submit themselves underneath the leadership of the Holy Ghost Savior amen if you do not have this leadership it's not very far off from you amen if you are lacking the leadership of the Holy Ghost it is not very far off from you this is not a this is not a strange thing this is not something that you have to go to college to learn this is not something that you have to go and and smite yourself for for years and years and think oh when will I get this thing know the baptism of the Holy Ghost is for you today as many has heard has believed as many as as me we're entering into that church that day as Peter preached the word the Holy Ghost fell on them amen when the disciples went forth laying hands on him and the Holy Spirit fell upon them as they were as the gospel is preached and as the elder is laid upon their hands why because the Holy Ghost was for them amen and now in this day the Holy Ghost is for you and let me speak to the children here as as me as the children here have come to this church and have lists into the gospel has been preached and has listened to how we preached the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I know some of our children have been baptized now in the name of Lord Jesus Christ I know some of our children right now are thinking about being baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ every person has been baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ has a promise and inheritance to enter into they've been given an inheritance thus saith the Lord thus saith the scripture there you repent and you are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you go down into the water you are dead to your old ways dead to the sins of this world dead to the things that are wrong and you are alive now unto the Lord Jesus Christ the one that created the heavens and the earth the one that created us in his own image we are alive unto Him and when we are alive unto Him he says I will give you my own spirit it's a promise it's an inheritance it's thus sayeth the Lord I will give you of my spirit I will take out your stony heart of flesh I open it a new heart that will agree with me and I will take that heart and I will fill it with my spirit and you will go forth being led by the holy ghost and and the works of your father you'll do amen the works of the Lord the one same one that created the heavens in the earth the word his works you will do Amen why because you were led by the Holy Ghost amen and let me tell you of all I'm all my life you know as I get closer to 40 I think Lord my life's almost half oh if the Lord tarry you know the nature of man going to 80 years or whatever it is and I think Laura do my life's half over has this half of my life been pleasing to you I think Lord and all the things I wish I hadn't done all the foolish things lord I pray that those things will be smitten away as far as the East is from the West and lord I ask that there be eternal things that's every way every ways goal that that there will be eternal things that they have done where the Lord led them I want you to go here and do this I want you to go here and do that I want you to go here and do this things that they did in obedience to the scripture things they did in obedience to the leadership of the Lord things they did in obedience to the faithful pastor they preached and all these things that they did they did it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and those things will never be taken from me those things will never be taken from it those are eternal things even Jesus himself said if you give a couple of drink of cold water to someone to a servant of the Lord that man will never lose his reward just giving a cup of cold water that male will never lose his reward and we were as we read here in this verse it says thus saith Lord keep you judgment and do justice keep you judgment and do justice well what is judgment what is judgment first off when it says keep ye judgment we're keep you there means to attend to to guard to protect we have a judgment here we have to keep it we have to guard it he's saying thus saith Lord keep this guard this protect this he says keep e judgment the judgment there I want you to decide judgment is to make a verdict judgment is to make a decision when something is judged something is weighed in the balances and when something is judged its it's a verdict the decision that has been weighed in the balances the decision has been made the verdict has been passed either this is right or this is wrong and Jesus said thus saith Lord I want you to keep judgment I want you to do justice I want you to weigh the things in the balances once you decide is this right or hit now tell me how can a man ever decide whether something is right or something is wrong because we know that our own mind is faulting our own human mind can be can be swayed one way or the other way but the only way a man can really be keep judgment and to do justice the only way and era can weigh things in the balances as they take things to the Lord in prayer and whenever a man says Lord what should I do here what should I do there and you're taking things and you say Lord and you all sudden like say say you do something all sudden the Holy Spirit comes upon your heart what you did was wrong and you feel that conviction of the Lord and you say O Lord and you decide in your heart I either I'm gonna be in an agreement with the Holy Ghost or I'm going to be in disagreement with the Holy Ghost that's how we keep judgment when we are always watching what the Holy Spirit is is that does the Holy Spirit like this or does the Holy Spirit not like this when you're in constant communion with the Lord I think everybody knows what it feels like 8 any Holy Spirit fill believer knows what it feels like to grieve the Holy Ghost because that's that's what we do in our training ground that's what we do when we first get filled with the Holy Ghost you're in that training ground and you're and you're going about your daily life and also need to do something you've always done but all of a sudden you just oh I can't do that your last something I've always done my whole life but now all of a sudden now the leadership the Holy Ghost is checking me I feel this check in my heart and you're like oh that thing I always used to do now sudden I can't do that anymore what you're weighing things and the balance is you're judging them by the Holy Ghost by the conviction by the by the chimp the Holy Spirit by the communion of Christ I'll say you saying oh I can't do that anymore oh I don't want to grieve the Holy Spirit why because you treasure his presence because you treasure his communion you don't want to do anything that would grieve him you don't want to do anything that would hamper the communion between you and him you want to keep the way clean why because we got to keep the pathway between us in Christ clear why because we always want him to be able to come and to miss room he's going to come to you know that's the thing about it is that God is gonna come to his altar every day God is gonna come to his temple every morning his mercies are new every morning he's gonna come with the blood every morning he's going to come with a sanctification every morning he's going to come in with his righteousness every morning he's going to come every morning but but when the flus are all clogged up when you have the when you have something that's making desolation on the inside when you have something that's that's blocking then how can the Holy Spirit get there how can you ever get to the communion place how can he ever get to the meeting place but when you keep judgment when you're always weighing things in the balance by the baptism the Holy Ghost waiting thing is balanced with a with the with the with the pleadings of the Holy Spirit on the inside when he's pleading with you oh don't do this or go here and do this don't do this over there but do this over here and you're weighing things you're judging them by the leadership with the Holy Ghost amen thus saith Lord keep you judgment and do justice justice is righteousness it's the thing that is right so when you do judge whether things are right or wrong then you go and thus saith Lord you do the thing that is right why do we do it here it says in verse 1 he says because my salvation is near to come and my righteousness to be revealed Amen now when we think about that scripture there in Isaiah you only think about the day when when Christ came there as long as AEA's prophesies had to do with with the coming of Christ but but Christ comes every morning His mercies are new every morning he brings us salvation to us he brings the blood a new he he washes you clean he constantly daily daily he's coming to his temple where is this temple its temples right here he's coming every morning to his temple why his praises are sung there his word is kept there his his word is revered there and as simple and he comes to to commune with you there that's where his name this place that's where that's where that's where he longs to dwell is in his temple amen says so keep he judgment and do justice for my salvation as near to come my righteousness to be revealed amen his righteousness ought to be revealed in you amen we are to be the House of Prayer for All Nations we are the one to be the witness we are to be the ones that show righteousness to the world when the whole world is going wrong we are going right when the whole world is darkness we are the light how are we the light by the baptism of the Holy Ghost by his leadership down on the inside why because we have judged the things that are wrong and we have done the things that are right amen we've weighed the things in our life that are oh it wasn't it keeps the ways clean and clear Amen why so there could be a communion there let me tell you is attractive amen Christ is attractive amen when you when when when Christ was walking down through the earth here and the 2000 years ago he was attractive the things that he did were lovely the hid the sick were healed amen people were the unlovable were loved amen now he's he think wow how beautiful it was and you know every denomination you know they I think about how great the Messiah was but but here's the thing is can it be read can't be revealed again today a man can Christ be made the same today and he made the same he made the same yesterday today and forever amen Paul prophesied that Jesus Christ to be the same this day in January 2018 that Jesus Christ to be the same in January this is Paul prophesied this 2,000 years ago that Jesus Christ would be the same in January of 2018 as he was back then when hero when Paul wrote that scripture there underneath the leadership the Holy Ghost he was anointed right Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen and here we are in this in this day knowing that any day that is called today Jesus Christ is the same a man what is today today is today amen therefore Jesus Christ is still the same he's bringing his righteousness he's bringing his purity he's bringing his pardon amen who here has prepared the way this morning for him to bring his righteousness is cured in his part amen how do you do it why by keeping me judgment and doing the thing that has wrecked amen let's go down to verse 2 there that we read actually before we do that before word you asked her the book of Zephaniah the book of Zephaniah there's a third to last book in the Old Testament Zephaniah chapter 3 I don't want to dwell too much on the negative this morning but we're going to just go through this year for a moment Zephaniah chapter 3 verse 1 says woe to her that is filthy and polluted to the oppressing city she obeyed not the voice she received not correction she trusted not in the Lord she drew not near to God let's go down to the fifth verse though just Lord is in the midst thereof he will not do iniquity every morning does he bring his judgment to life he fail us not but the unjust knoweth no shame and I look at that fifth verse there the just Lord is in the midst thereof he's in the midst of the city who is Jerusalem today Amen that's us the just Lord the righteous Lord is in the midst thereof from the missile city he will not do iniquity every morning does he bring his judgment to light the Lord will decide what is right and what is wrong he fails not but the unjust knoweth no shame Amen why should they be ashamed because the Lord has brought his judgment in the morning the unjust the Lord and brings his judgment every morning but the unjust were not prepared to hear from the Lord they know no shame when the correction was brought they note knew no shame when correction was brought to the unjust they didn't know enough to repent and turn they did know enough they knew new assange so therefore how can they receive God's blessings every morning amen woe to her this filthy and polluted to the oppressing why is it a woe to her because she had a chance to be righteous she had everything was given to her to do that which was right and instead she did that which was wrong how so what was this what became of that she became polluted and filthy she became the oppressing City not only did she oppressed man she oppressed the Holy Ghost and that's every man that will not bow bow down and to leadership the Holy Ghost she the Holy Spirit she like Roy Brown says how can you how can you say revival in our day when the regular revival giver is bound you bound her by your traditions he said amen solo pressing city she didn't just oppress man but she oppressed the Holy Spirit she grieved the Holy Ghost how could the Holy Ghost came every morning to bring the judgement but because the oppressing city oppressed the Holy Spirit boy spirit could not bring judgment and justice to life hey man what I look at the look at the the four things that she did she she would not obey the voice remember thus saith Lord the Lord said to him buss saith Lord she didn't obey the voice and then she received not the correction the correction came to tell her don't do this do that but she would not receive that and she went on doing what she wanted to do anyhow and she trusted not in the Lord so so there whenever you receive not correction all sudden things begin going wrong amen there will be little hiccups along the road and then little hiccups become big hiccups and they get bigger and little sins become big sins and then all sudden you think Oh what should I do and you have a choice now as sin gives birth to or as as doubt gives birth to sin sing his birth to death amen and and then what do you do at each step of that warning sign you're supposed to turn and trust on the Lord but she did not do that she didn't receive correction so she trusted not into the Lord and the final thing she drew not near to her God as God brought the judgment to her his God brought the justice to her she had an opportunity to repent but she would not draw nigh to her under the law amen amen amen let's turn over to Deuteronomy chapter 16 I think everybody you know I looked back to my life the things that I enjoy most most of my life is serving the Lord of all the things I've done in my life of all the things that give me pleasure all the things I look back in my years and I think oh they bring me joy life and sometimes why I was able to follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost and serve the Lord amen the the biggest burdens upon my life are the things I look back in my life and where Lord said to do this instead I went the other way the biggest disappointments I have in my life are the times I fail to do with the Lord asked me to do amen and and therefore and we are that we are all exam on those things because when we come down to the end of the road we have our we as we make our choices every day we get to decide how we want to leave this earth we're going to leave our earth this earth and disappointment or you want to leave or this earth and joy that we did the things that please the Lord amen Deuteronomy chapter 16 read from the 18th verse and it says judges and officers shalt thou make in all thy gates which the Lord giveth thee throughout thy tribes and they shall judge the people with just judgment thou shall not rest judgment thou shalt not thou shall not respect persons neither take a gift for a gift of the blind the eyes of the wise and pervert the words of the righteous that which is all together just shalt thou follow that thou mayest live and inherit the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee amen think about the judges and officers shalt thou make in all thy gates every entrance into the city set a point of judgment what is a judge it's a wise man that knows how to decide between right and wrong amen every point every entrance into your spirit every entrance into your mind at every every at all of it you're at all of your senses of your of your sight your hearing of your of your of your touch all of your senses and your reasoning your affections of your conscience your memories set a judge right there decide is this thing right or is this thing wrong and what is that judge what does he draw from how does he get his judgment he gets it from thus saith the Lord he gives it from the leadership of the Holy Ghost when he's submitted under Christ you bring the things when you you set the judge at all the gates what's gonna come into my body and we sing that song Oh be careful little eyes what you see Oh be careful little eyes what you see for the father up above is looking down and love Oh be careful little eyes what you see Oh be careful little ears what you hear Oh be careful little ears what you hear for the father up above is looking down and look Oh be careful little ears what you hear we sung these songs as a child and in Sunday school but they're true we're supposed to set the judge at the gate no wicked thing was set before my eyes why so I can be ready too when the Lord comes upon the scene I'll be ready to do that what she asked me to do amen set the Sun set the judge up on the gates thou shalt not have respective fur person's either take a gift really a gift of blind the eyes of the wise and pervert the words of the righteous a man yo and when Satan who always likes to bring his little gift he likes to bring a little pleasure along your life something that feels good or looks good that's a that's a gift from the devil we bring something to you and you want it what does it do it perverts your judgment it perverts your decision-making when you say oh I'm going to do this because it feels right because and without seeking that and without judging it by the baptism of the Holy Ghost by the leadership of Holy Ghost when you take those things in you and you feel your flesh wanting to go towards the gift that Satan's bringing you wanting to go the direction because Satan has a lot of pleasures he'll bring across your path and he wants to yes a gift he's he's bringing she's putting something before you and trying to bring a gift before you and your flesh wants to set that direction but instantly because you have a judge at the gate there you decide you say Lord is this thing right or is this thing wrong is this thing going to hinder my communion with Lord is this thing gonna grieve the whole spirit of living God is this gonna be is this gonna bring pleasure to my lord or not bring pleasure to my lord amen and when you decide you set the judge at the gate brother Keith sets the judges of his gates brother Isaac sets the judges at his gates brother Troy brother Mike aye brother Samuel we all set our judges at the gates that there are interests as to our cities because we are one body Amen we take communion declaring the we're one body we are on one Accord we come here together into the service that the boy spirit might come down into this place and we are watching every day watching the things that go on in our body why so that we wouldn't bring something down to drag down the body of Christ amen so the body of Christ might be made whole we set the judges at the gates because we were careful to what enters into the gates of the body of Christ amen amen jesus said I judge everything that I see and I hear by the will of God and that's John John 5:30 a men a man when we read there and we read there in in Isaiah 56 verse 2 is said blessed is the man that doeth this blessed is the man that do things blessed is the man that listens to us say floored blessed is the man that keeps that judgment does justice because his salvation is ready to come his righteousness to reveal he said in verse 2 blesses the man that doeth this and the son of man the lathe hold on that keepeth the Sabbath's from polluting it they keepeth his hand from doing evil how do we keep the Sabbath in this day how do we keep the Sabbath in this day when we rest from our works and we lean on the works of Jesus Christ when we follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost that's how we keep the Sabbath and you cannot keep the Sabbath in this day unless you're filled with the Holy Ghost no man can keep the Sabbath in this day by being fitme by three fill with the baptism of the Holy Ghost how does he keep the Sabbath he keeps the Sabbath by doing that which the Lord leads to him a man was he do he keeps his hand from doing any evil he judges it is this thing gonna lead me closer to Christ is this thing of the Lord or is this thing not of the Lord is this thing the Satan's starting to bring my path to get me to go this way or is this something Christ is bringing to my path amen I was thinking about a this morning about a seared conscience you know once a conscience has been seared it's it's branded it's it's sealed off it's it's lost a sense of touch its loss of sense of feeling it's no longer sensitive the whole the Holy Spirit when a conscious when a man's conscience is seared he is no longer since if he has disobeyed for so long in one particular spot that his conscience gets seared and he can no longer feel that when the Lord comes to him to prick him there he can no longer sense it when when the Holy Spirit comes and say oh that's wrong his conscious is here that you can't feel it anymore you can't sense the boys spirit boys spirits trying to enter in to tell you what you're doing wrong but because you have ignored the Holy Spirit for so long and all of a sudden your conscience has been seared as a hot iron Nelson you cannot do that which is right we can't even tell what spirit is trying to correct you because you have ignored the Holy Spirit for so long that you cannot do that which is right you don't even that's a bad place to be amen no Christian ought to be in that place if any Christian you know here in this room has gotten to that place the only the only way to get out of that there is only one way to get that and that is down on your knees crying out unto the Lord asking him that maybe for a chance that he just might forgive you and heal your spirit in essence otherwise you'll keep doing grieving and grieving and grieving and grieving and grieving the Holy Spirit over and over again one of these days you might do that for the last time amen and we don't want to get to that when yours conscious monsier by a hot iron the only the only way to do to cure the there is only one cure and that is pleading at the Lord at the altar of Mercy you know if you have never if you it's been long time since you've been broken before the Lord it's been a long time since you've cried out before God and you know if the sins of your flesh build up and build up and build up and they get to a point to where you haven't been broken before the Lord and then your conscience is seared somewhere and you have to get back to the altar someway somehow say Lord I've allowed my flesh to rise up it's I haven't been back to the circumcision I haven't died daily for a long time and my conscious has become seared in this area Lord I'm crying out to you I need to come back to the way things used to be I need to come back to where I first saw you I come back to step one here Lord Lord I'm crying out for repentance Lord that you would grant me godly repentance I'm crying out Lord that you would forgive me of my sins wash me make me do give me a soft heart all over again amen how can we go out and witness to the lost how can we have a feeling for a lost soul how can we have a feeling or I don't have compassion on those that are sick or those that need Christ when our own hearts are seared by the sins that we've allowed in the flesh amen we cannot do it amen we're about we're here to be a witness of Lord Jesus Christ but but when we've sinned and sin and keep sin upon sin how can we have compassion upon the Lost when we our own selves need help amen amen woe unto the oppressing city that has oppressed the Holy Ghost it has grieves the Holy Spirit amen she didn't obey the voice she wouldn't receive correction she trusted not in the Lord she drew 9-year on Georgia a man believed and said the greatest battle ever finds the battle in the mind amen amen but we don't have to be like that a man as we read I bring my voice as I bring my judgment every morning I'm bringing my justice every morning he said my mercies are new every morning why'd he say that every morning every morning the lamb was slain in the morning and the evening every day there was a fresh sacrifice every day there was a fresh sacrifice every day there supposed to be a fresh experience a fresh Lord I'm dying out to the things of yesterday Laura I'm alive to the things today Laura I'm reaching back I'm placing my hands upon my baptism where I testified Lord Laura I testified down in the water Lord that I'd be dead to the things of the world that I'd be alive to the things of Christ and Here I am now in a fresh day Lord where you were the same yesterday today and forever and here in this day in January where you said you would be the same today Lord I'm asking you to be the same my life Lord I'm asking for a fresh refilling of your Holy Ghost well Lord I'm asking you Lord Lord deliver me once more amen amen let's turn over to Isaiah chapter 62 a male I read about Beulah land amen how I enjoyed that song maybe that's not a time I don't hear it that I don't enjoy Beulah long I'm longing for you amen Isaiah 62 okay man we want to do those things that are pleasing to the side Isaiah 62 verse 4 it says thou shalt no more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land be anymore term desolate but thou shalt be called Hepzibah and I'll ambulance in thee and thy land shall be married amen they meant verse five there says for as a young man marries a virgin socialize sons marry thee and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride so shall thy God rejoice over the hue aging God rejoicing over you as this thing become real to you a man and you realize that the same God that created the heavens and the earth the same God that we have gathered in this room to be in his presence this morning that same God has desire to rejoice over you as a man does his bride amen what can what place that we're in where are we standing this morning where are we at this morning that the God of heaven would tell us that I desire to rejoice over you like a man would rejoice over his bride I desire for a Joy's over you that much Amen I was looking at that word forsaken he says I will not call you forsaken any more I was looking at that word forsaken and I was looking at the dictionary you on the dictionary they got things that are called antonyms and they have things are called synonyms let me give you a little English lesson this morning and we homeschool our kids let me let me give you a little English lesson this morning an antonym is the opposite of any word so you take the meaning of this word and there's another word that is opposite of the word that has opposite meanings and there's another word there's another type of words called sin on him a synonym is an English word that is these there's two words there are a lot like each other and that the means of the one are complementary to the meanings of the other so if you took a sentence that has this word in it and you take this synonym over here and take that word out and put this word in it would mean basically the same thing but just give another little flavor to it they give another little vanilla so you can get a three-dimensional aspect of what it looks like so I was looking at the antonyms and the synonyms of these words here so the word forsaken they're the synonyms of or the the synonyms the similar words to forsaken are left behind departed from abandoned neglected not cared for not considered not heeded not even used you're neglected you're forsaken you're not used but God said you will no longer be called neglected you will no longer be called forsaken you will be used you're you're going to be considered you're going to be cared for you're not going to be called departed from you're not gonna be called abandoned you're not going to be called left behind you're how he likes that this morning we're looking for a rapture right now you're not gonna be left behind you're not going to be forsaken this is not what you're looking for and he says neither is your land gonna be called desolate nor desolate the synonyms for desolate are devastated there's nothing left together everything is blown apart things you see pieces you see things that are supposed to be together blown to pieces it's desolate it's it's not was supposed to be like is there's no life there it's been it's been taken apart life has been destroyed he says your land won't be called that you're away at land what we called the desolate land your lane won't be called the devastated land your land won't be called the ruined land your land won't be called the land that doesn't have any life in it that doesn't have any fruits in it your land won't be like that land because I have desired to look upon you like a man looks towards his wife and a wife and a man isn't gonna let his wife be desolate a man isn't gonna be less life before se caen he's not gonna let his bride be left behind he's not going to depart from his wife God is going to cherish his wife he's going to love her and care for her amen but he says instead you're I will call you I won't be call you forsake by Oh we'll call you Hepzibah and Hepzibah means my delight is in earth Amen you my love you my love you my cherished one you my bride are the one that I am that might put my delight in there's other things I could haven't delight in but I have chosen to place my delight right here solely upon you you're the one that I'm looking for I'm not looking to the right I'm not looking to the left but the Lord Jesus Christ has looked upon us today and says I'm not gonna call you forsaken anymore but I have chosen you from before the foundation of the world I have paid the price for all of your sins and I am looking upon you and I am NOT and I am calling you my delight is in you and I am gonna take you and I'm going to place you in a land and I'm gonna call the land I'm placing you in married and the so the word the word hepzibah there my delight the synonyms of delight there my delight is in her the delight could also it also could be continued satisfied with Christ satisfy with his bride amen at peace with his bride at peace one with the other this is a this is the way our marriage relationship ought to be think of the most beautiful marriage relationship you've ever seen this is more than that this is a thousand times more than that because his delight is in her there's serenity there's ecstasy there's there's bliss complete euphoria my delight is in her amen extreme happiness and delight rapture satisfaction as Jesus says this is my son in whom I am well pleased to dwell in Amen Jesus Christ this is my bride and who I am well pleased to dwell in Amen my delight is in her and I will call her land I won't call her land desolate or unfruitful I'll call her land married a man she will be the one and her land will be called Mary Beulah land amen she'll be that my land is it's joined with something it's a fruitful land it bears the fruits of the gospel a man bears the fruits of the spirit all the land I am taking you out of the land as desolate I'm placing you in the land of Zion and place you Elaine where you will bear fruit amen I am a well watered land a man who bears its fruit in its season that's what I have done for you amen amen he says thou shalt not be no no this is a promise this is a promise of wheat this is an inheritance to us this is something that we enter into how do we enter into this by following thus saith the LORD by following the saith the scripture it gives us a right to this inheritance amen when you follow the gospel pattern you get gospel results and when you look at your life you say I have repented of my sins I have I have I have gone down to the altar I've sought the Lord in my closet I have sought judgment and mercy and grace I have weighed things in the balances by the by the leadership of the Holy Ghost and when the Lord convicts me all of the lawyers convicted me Lord I have chosen I have thrown away that which was wrong and I have accepted that which is right and then and then I've gone down into baptism in the name of Lord Jesus Christ and I publicly announced that I am the Lord Jesus Christ he is mine now I am in love with my husband the Lord Jesus Christ he is mine and all and I have given them out the announcement to the world I am NOT about the things of the world anymore I am about the things of Christ and his things and when you have announced that then you have thrown your lot and you have announced that I am now on the side of Christ and you've rejected the things of the world you've received the seal of Christ on your foreheads you've gone down to the water even baptized you have an inheritance to look forward to you can take every single one of these words in these scriptures here that we just read and you can claim them as an inheritance this is my inheritance and Lord I'm looking at my land right here now Lord and you said to my land we fruitful you said my land we marry you said that your delight was in me and Lord I am calling out I'm calling you out Lord on your on your promise and you can take you this you can open up your Bible right here to Isaiah chapter 62 you can lay your hand upon the scripture you can late raise your hand up in the air say Lord you gave me this as an inheritance Lord you gave me this as inheritance for me and Lord I am crying out this morning that these scriptures will be fulfilled for me in my life that you are the same yesterday today and forever and as I as upon the authority as a member of the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ as a on the authority of being a member of that bride that I ought to be fruitful that I ought to have fruit being born in my life the idea about my father's business that the Holy Spirit I'll be leading me day by day Lord upon the authority that you gave me as being a member of the Briar Christ what must we do this day Lord appraises here my lord send me we're no longer looking and saying oh woe is me oh woe is me I am a man of unclean lips we're not saying that anymore we're now we're here we're saying Lord hear my lord send me amen now now we're getting somewhere all the things of the past are done and gone we don't have to we don't have to worry about our sins they're all in the past they're all under the blood we don't have to worry about our foolishness we don't have to worry about our although all of our bad habits we don't have to worry about this or worry about that we've placed them down underneath the blood we've died to ourself once more today is a new day His mercy is new every morning amen his mercy as he comes he's bringing his judgment fresh in the morning I cried out to the Lord for my seared conscience the Lord gave me a fresh heart and he made my heart and newly gave me a fresh and a clean heart so I could accept him this morning and Lord hear my lord by the by the virtue of being a member of the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ and I'm crying out Lord here on my father send me to the nations Lord hear my Lord send me to my work send me wherever I'm going to go Lord where is where is those that are heavy laden where are those that are imprisoned father where are those that are bound by the devil where are the evil spirits that are dwelling that weird as we were supposed to these signs will follow them to belief and my name they shall cast out Devils a my name they shall do many mighty works why because I the Lord will be in them from this day to the end of the world amen and on the authority of those scriptures we can rise every morning judging the things that are wrong placing them under the blood and accepting the righteousness of Jesus Christ there's new every morning and saying Lord here am I send me amen this is why we are on this journey and when we come to the end of our days we will the only things that we will have joy in are the things that the Lord has done the way the Lord has done in our life when we come before the Lord everything must be judged every action in this on it for the last 6,000 years every action must be judged it has to go to the judgment seat let our actions be though the judgment seat now all our actions must go the judgment seat now so they can be placed underneath the blood while there is still mercy under the mercy seat so we don't get to the judgment seat at the white throne judgment so because we don't want our judgment to be there amen but we have an opportunity here right now take everything we've ever done that was wrong the place is upon the altar of judgment and count those things that are wrong say Lord here my lord forgive me and to place those things upon every because every action must be judged has to go the judgment but glory unto those that that judged their actions now by the leadership of the Holy Ghost oh woe unto those that have a seared conscience and refused to allow themselves to be judged amen they will go to the white throne judgment a man won't or should do not year unto her Lord amen amen Amen he the lack of these things his blind has no revelation there's no faith as forgiveness he's forgotten the use version was a sense amen let's just stand I want to read here just in closing amen first Peter chapter 5 here I'll read two verses here one first Peter 1 second Peter the tenth verse it says first Peter 5:10 it says but the God of all Grace who has called us unto his eternal glory by Jesus Christ after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen settle you to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever but the God of all Grace and every day again the God of all Grace who has called us has anybody ever been called this morning a man what did he call you unto you he called you unto his eternal glory is that off in the future no that's right now Christ has a glory we've been called to enter into that glory too but the God of all Grace who had mercy and grace plants who has called us from before the foundation of the world has called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after the Eve suffered four little eyes who made it who here has suffered a little while amen amen he's gonna what he's gonna make you perfect amen that were we going through all his sufferings for he's making us perfect Saints a maze raisins up into a statue of a perfect man he's raised us from glory and the glory into glory he's gonna what's he doing he's establishing us I mean who here can say that you are more established now than you used to be a man who here has a greater faith now than you used to a man who has greater faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and you used to have a man what's he doing he's strengthening you and what happens when your faith gets greater you begin to get stronger hey man you take the sword and you can cut deeper a man you can push harder you can push back the devil harder and what it was to do it settles you a man when you get settled what happens you can go and you there is no fear there is no you're there think of a soldier going down to through the streets to through the arm he think of a one-man invasion think of a one-man old invasion a soldier of the Cross he has he's like Moses going down to Egypt he knows where he stands he knows what he has he's been strengthened he been settled his faith he knows that the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ is behind him he knows that the all the power of heavens behind what he does a man why why because the God of all grace has called him to that a man now there's a companion verse to that let's go over to the second Peter verse 11 1 verse 11 you know how because it goes there 1st Peter 5 it goes through all the virtues add your faith virtue knowledge temperance temperance patience godliness both of the kindness and all these things he says for if you do these things you know you shall never fall he says but if these things in about me and you and abound in you they make you they shouldn't they either be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ think about this man he's standing there with a sword he's got his faith he's been strengthened he's been settled he's going about here my lord send me not whoa is me but send me and then he keeps going down he says uh-uh he gets down he says in verse 11 it says for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you an entrance what are we entering into think about this soldier now he's ready he's been strengthened he's been settled he has a sword in his hand all the sins are under the blood his faith is now way the way up here is not just his faith he has the supernatural faith now whereas it's not a faith that's being given by man or been creating his own mind but he's got that supernatural faith he's standing there he's got the virtues he's growing up into Christ the verse shoes are being added to 1 upon glory upon glory upon glory what's he going he's going up higher and higher and all sudden he looks up and Austin this road appears before the red carpet is rolled out he's stepping up the Kings Highway he's not just have you ever been and bias somewhere and then you weren't welcomed and you wonder why you were there it's not so with this it's not so in this scripture right here now an entrance is ministered unto you it's not just that God is gonna invite you up into heaven because he's having pity on you it's not just he's saying well I'll let you all ow you to come into my heaven but he's no he's rolling out the red carpet he's saying a mint and entrance is being ministered unto you unto who under this soldier of the cross he's come up hither come up hither sit in heavenly places sit upon my sit with me a my throne amen and he says and so an interest shall be ministered unto you abundantly even have you ever been somewhere where someone invites you into your house and made you feel so welcome that you felt embarrassed by the Welcome that they gave you a man I've been in those places where they they just go over the top and they just embarrass you with what they give this is the entrance this can be ministered unto us oh we don't deserve this much oh we don't Lord we don't even need this much basis but my delight is in her amen and your land is called marriage we're joined one to the other and you're living amongst all the fruits of the my field amen this and for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen those that went through the wilderness back in Moses day they are looking forward to a promised land but when they got to that promised land after a few days there began to be graveyards and that promised land and they began dying off they enjoyed it for a while but then they would pass away Amen but it's not so with this promised land and Atrix is being minister on us where we shall live there for all of eternity a man like I said you know I said you know I'm getting closer to 40 now you know and my life is getting close to what you'd say is half over but I shall never die Amen I'm never gonna close my eyes for a thousand years one of these days I will close my eyes here I'll open them up there a man has sown entrances being ministered unto me and it won't be just that the Lord sitting on me it's not just that the Lord say well I will allow you to come into my they says no my delight is in you come here and enter it come here I'm gonna grab you by the coat I'm going to bring come up into here spend the eternity with me a man why because my delight isn't you you must come I chose you before the foundation of the world I want you to come I am NOT just I'm not just taking pity upon you but I want you to come and spend time with me that's what our Lord Jesus Christ is saying amen and we have the opportunity to enter into his gates with Thanksgiving to enter into his courts with praise why because of the entrance that we ministered unto us amen that's what has been given unto us and don't lose sight of Amen because now was our salvation closer than when it first appeared think about it he wants us to be there he wants to grab us and take us there he says after you suffer here for a little while an
