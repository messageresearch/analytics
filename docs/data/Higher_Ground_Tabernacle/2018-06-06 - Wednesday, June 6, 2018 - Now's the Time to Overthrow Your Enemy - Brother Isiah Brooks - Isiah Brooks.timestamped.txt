[13:56] here in the lair let us pray father God

[14:02] grace we thank you for being so good to
[14:06] us we pray Lord God that you would bless
[14:09] the service in a special way forgive us
[14:12] for anything we may have said or done
[14:14] Lord forgive us Lord God for any actions
[14:18] we may have done and have not been
[14:20] pleasing in our sight
[14:21] Lord we think of for bringing us through
[14:23] this day we thank you for your amazing
[14:26] grace and your blood that cleanses us
[14:28] from all unrighteousness and father we
[14:30] pray this evening that your perfect will
[14:32] be done in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[14:35] amen
[14:36] you may be seated you know I I realized
[14:41] by God's grace that we have been talking
[14:43] about wars we've been talking about
[14:46] battles and the things that we must go
[14:48] through we go through these trials and
[14:50] tests every day but at some point in
[14:53] time our battles must change we're not
[14:58] to have the same battle - Jesus calm if
[15:01] you watch the children of Israel when
[15:04] they came through the land they had
[15:07] different tribes I believe it was about
[15:09] seven or eight of them and they had
[15:12] commissioned that God commissioned him
[15:14] to destroy all of them and God says now
[15:19] if you don't destroy them they will
[15:21] become a thorn in your flesh so we
[15:24] realized by God's grace God commissioned
[15:26] him to overthrow the people of the land
[15:30] even though God had provided them the
[15:32] victory told Joshua wherever you plant
[15:34] your feet I have blessed it it's yours
[15:37] but just like the prophet of God tells
[15:39] us that we must fight for all everything
[15:42] God has promised us we must fight and we
[15:46] realize by God's grace that now our warp
[15:49] warp
[15:49] excuse me weapon tree and our warfare is
[15:53] not counted but the Bible said our
[15:55] warfare is spiritual right pulling down
[15:58] every thrown strong whole everything
[16:01] that exalts itself against the Word of
[16:03] God we supposed to bring it down under
[16:05] our feet we realize by God's grace that
[16:09] Israel fought and
[16:10] killed a lot of people and they
[16:12] destroyed a lot of people and and like
[16:14] we was talking with a brother today you
[16:16] know just how when one man was anointed
[16:19] how he can destroy so many and I believe
[16:23] by God's grace that the same God that
[16:25] they served we serve two because you and
[16:29] I must understand that they were serving
[16:32] God with them God was with them as we
[16:35] read I'll be with you wherever you go
[16:37] I'll be there I'll go before you I will
[16:39] be fought they find you even the Bible
[16:42] says you know no fire nothing shall
[16:44] destroy thee the word tells us them when
[16:50] even you cast into the fire I will be
[16:52] there with you
[16:54] but we realize Amen that Israel didn't
[16:57] always obey God and because of that they
[17:00] were overthrown my message tonight is
[17:03] now it's a time to overthrow your enemy
[17:10] brother Balaam said it in like terms if
[17:13] you don't kill the demon or destroy the
[17:14] demon that demon will destroy you we are
[17:18] in a warfare I wish we could say by
[17:21] God's grace that we we are now having
[17:24] this heavenly experience but that comes
[17:28] down the road you and I Amen by God's
[17:31] grace are in a warfare when you go to
[17:35] bed it's war when you wake up in the
[17:38] morning is war throughout today is war
[17:42] you're fighting Satan every day all day
[17:45] sometimes Satan attack you from places
[17:49] you didn't even know he was coming here
[17:50] he loves to ambush you sometimes when we
[17:54] are ambushed you know it takes us by
[17:56] surprise and we don't know how to act
[17:59] but you know you find out that when
[18:02] Israel was ambushed they called on the
[18:05] name of Jehovah when they did not know
[18:08] what to do the prophets and different
[18:10] ones they were put forth an altar which
[18:13] represented prayer they will literally
[18:15] take a goat or a bull or some kind of
[18:20] sacrifice and
[18:22] and literally burn it unto the Lord
[18:25] before and after and you and I because
[18:29] you know you got to realize Amen that's
[18:31] how prayer is in order to win this
[18:34] battle you got to pray before the battle
[18:36] starts and after the battle is finished
[18:39] think about it Israel was overthrown in
[18:41] the wilderness because they wouldn't
[18:43] stay with the angel everything that
[18:46] Moses tried to tell them to do you
[18:48] always had somebody with a creed or
[18:51] dollar something to overthrow the truth
[18:54] that's what the enemy is all about now
[18:56] it is about the Word of God and you and
[19:00] I must be watching that word carefully
[19:01] that we will not allow somebody's creed
[19:05] or Dogma amen to come and overthrow him
[19:09] in what we know it's true the reason why
[19:12] we don't see all the great miracles and
[19:14] all the great signs and all the great
[19:15] wonders is because somewhere there is
[19:19] some Creed's of men that is ruling over
[19:23] the word hello right so you and I must
[19:28] understand I better explain that in just
[19:30] a moment
[19:31] Jericho was shut in and God told Joshua
[19:36] you go over there and overthrow Jericho
[19:39] you know when you talk about
[19:41] overthrowing something it means to
[19:43] dispose as from a position of power to
[19:47] overcome defeat vanquish hallelujah to
[19:53] put an end to by force you understand me
[19:58] through throw our knock down to overturn
[20:01] topple right it means to knock down in
[20:05] to demolish overthrow is a wonderful
[20:08] word because when we overthrow Satan we
[20:11] supposed to finish him you understand me
[20:15] put him into a place where he can't come
[20:17] back hallelujah
[20:18] is that right remember when God through
[20:21] our overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah God
[20:23] said it'll never be again hallelujah and
[20:27] still to this day hallelujah
[20:29] there is no Sodom and Gomorrah it is but
[20:32] they are under the Red Sea under the
[20:34] Dead Sea is that Alright
[20:35] so we
[20:36] by God's grace even when we come to
[20:39] overthrow we come to overthrow we come
[20:42] to make this kingdom the kingdom of our
[20:46] Lord Jesus Christ so in order for us to
[20:49] do that we must overthrow the man who's
[20:52] sitting on this so-called throne
[20:54] Satan hallelujah
[20:57] proverbs 21 31 says the horse is
[21:01] prepared against the day of battle but
[21:04] safety is of the Lord in other words we
[21:08] cannot trust in anything else other than
[21:11] the Word of God in order to defeat this
[21:14] devil of this day hallelujah your
[21:16] emotions your feelings your thoughts
[21:18] your desires none of that can defeat
[21:21] Satan the only thing that can defeat
[21:24] Satan is the Word of God
[21:26] and brother madam said that was a great
[21:28] weapon tree that God gave us two things
[21:31] that defeat him and God gave us best the
[21:33] best of his of his weapon tree and that
[21:36] is the word and prayer hallelujah now we
[21:40] realize by God's grace amen God he does
[21:44] the things and he puts you in a place
[21:46] where it seems as if the enemy has the
[21:49] advantage of you and that's what makes
[21:51] us threat sometime that's what makes us
[21:53] nervous that's what makes us doubt
[21:55] hallelujah that God is able but God is
[21:59] more than able hallelujah He is God
[22:02] hallelujah do you believe the word
[22:04] sometimes we fail to see that God ain't
[22:07] gonna just overthrow your enemy all at
[22:09] one time
[22:10] hallelujah but the Bible said little and
[22:14] little will I Drive them out hallelujah
[22:17] y'all noise the truth of God did it like
[22:19] that Amen we'd be lifted up as if we did
[22:22] something hallelujah you should all know
[22:25] I wouldn't be lifted up rail remember
[22:28] when David went out and killed ten
[22:31] thousand Saul got jealous as if he was
[22:36] the one who killed a thousand and when
[22:39] they began to sing that song David
[22:41] killed ten thousand is Saul a thousand
[22:45] he became jealous he Hey
[22:49] David for no cause if he had seen that
[22:53] there was no way that David could have
[22:55] killed ten thousand that that was the
[22:58] same God that called Saul to kill a
[23:01] thousand hallelujah sheep but at that
[23:05] time amen day I saw had along some kind
[23:09] of creed I'm the king I'm supposed to
[23:13] kill more see and preachers do the same
[23:16] thing some time with somebody witnesses
[23:18] somebody and bring them all in the
[23:20] church like they do preachers get
[23:22] nervous they get scared and they don't
[23:24] understand that's the hand of God why
[23:28] should I get jealous if you God gives
[23:30] you souls the whole purpose behind you
[23:33] is in it for scenario folks you know
[23:36] it's just it's just that sometimes we
[23:38] get jealous about things that we
[23:40] shouldn't get jealous of it because Amen
[23:42] all the doings is of the Lord hallelujah
[23:45] is that right you couldn't win one soul
[23:48] to the Lord without God in it hallelujah
[23:53] now Samuel he says listen you know in
[23:58] 1st Samuel 17 47 and David is talking to
[24:01] Goliath because Goliath has threatened
[24:04] Israel and now David he's had experience
[24:09] with the bear he's had the experience
[24:11] with the lion and now he's dealing with
[24:13] Goliath but he wanted Goliath to know
[24:15] something he said an awl disassembly
[24:18] she'll know that the Lord sayeth not
[24:22] with sword and spear for the battle is
[24:26] the Lord and He will give you into our
[24:29] hands y'all understand me
[24:32] God don't care about you getting upset
[24:34] and being in a fight naturally he
[24:36] doesn't work that way if you think
[24:39] you're gonna beat the devil out of
[24:40] somebody he doesn't work that way God
[24:43] does not handle situation in such a way
[24:47] hallelujah
[24:48] God is spirit hallelujah and you and I
[24:51] must realize they meant that you and I
[24:53] if we're going to overthrow the devil we
[24:55] must do it in a spiritual way hallelujah
[24:59] is that right see that's the only way
[25:01] you
[25:02] throw him is by God's Way and God's Way
[25:05] only hallelujah that's okay
[25:11] David understood one thing and in Psalm
[25:15] 27:1 through 8 I love it he said listen
[25:18] the Lord is my light and my salvation
[25:22] whom shall I fear you and I have no
[25:27] business
[25:28] fearing the devil or no man who shall I
[25:34] fear we care about all these things you
[25:38] saying you know what Jesus told Pilate
[25:41] when he says I can put you to death he
[25:44] said no you can't he said and the power
[25:48] that you have is what my father's given
[25:51] you you can't do a thing your boss can't
[25:54] do a thing no one can do a thing without
[25:58] God allowing it it's all in God's hands
[26:03] hallelujah
[26:05] whom shall I fear you're not gonna have
[26:07] me in a way that I'm not gonna be able
[26:09] to sleep at night hmm the Lord is the
[26:14] strength of my life of whom shall I be
[26:16] afraid
[26:18] y'all believe the word with the enemy
[26:21] when the wicked even my enemies and foe
[26:25] came upon me to eat up my flesh they
[26:29] stumbled and fell hallelujah is that
[26:33] right even when Jesus when they came to
[26:35] get him at the time of his crucifixion
[26:37] they want to just grab him and tear him
[26:40] apart and they all fell back was that
[26:43] there hallelujah don't host and camp
[26:47] about me my heart shall not fear the
[26:50] wall should rise against me in this will
[26:53] I have come home my love how I'm not
[26:56] going to shake I'm not going to tremble
[26:57] I'm gonna have confidence in this word
[27:00] hallelujah
[27:01] one thing I've desired of the Lord that
[27:04] will I see after that I may dwell in the
[27:07] house of the Lord all the days of my
[27:08] life to be all the beauty of the Lord
[27:11] and to enquire in his temple hallelujah
[27:15] this is what I
[27:16] for in a time of trouble he shall hide
[27:19] me in his provision he not all I'm
[27:23] hoping in a time of trouble
[27:25] he says listen at the time when is it
[27:27] when the rapture comes at hand God's
[27:30] gonna hide me when God get ready to to
[27:33] destroy this earth he will hide me
[27:39] hallelujah I don't have to worry about
[27:41] it I'm trusting him and so what the
[27:45] battle is of the Lord I can't win no
[27:48] battle brother man said I can't heal
[27:51] nobody I don't happen he I came here but
[27:56] the healer is here hallelujah I can't
[27:59] win one battle but the one who wins the
[28:01] battle is here hallelujah it is time to
[28:05] overthrow your enemy instead allowing
[28:08] your enemy to always overthrow you the
[28:12] problem is we ain't playing like we are
[28:14] - and in your prayer you gotta press God
[28:17] with faith you can't come to God and
[28:19] hold God I just hope you do you work
[28:22] this situation out no sir the Bible said
[28:24] we supposed to go before his throne
[28:26] boldly hallelujah we supposed to bring
[28:29] forth our petition with God hallelujah
[28:32] who believe me when I lead the altar is
[28:38] finished I don't have to see it I don't
[28:42] have to smell it I don't have to taste
[28:44] it I don't have to feel it I don't need
[28:47] none of these senses here that you see I
[28:49] don't need to hear it I have a sixth
[28:52] sense and that sixth sense it's a faith
[28:54] in God it's God's faith that's able to
[28:58] call those things that be not as though
[29:00] they were see the devil don't want you
[29:01] to do that because you can prophesy and
[29:04] tell Adele no this is mine this is mine
[29:06] this is mine and all of this is mine
[29:09] hallelujah and you won't get one thing
[29:12] is that right Moses said I ain't gonna
[29:14] leave one hoof behind
[29:16] did he leave one hoof behind absolutely
[29:18] not one right why because he knew he
[29:23] came god he use him to overthrow ejup
[29:27] think about it
[29:30] man with the stick in his hand went down
[29:34] to Egypt as one-man invasion see we read
[29:38] about it but do we believe it
[29:39] just like I told somebody I said if you
[29:41] really believe north built an ark and
[29:44] there was a flood you have you got more
[29:45] faith than you know you have hallelujah
[29:48] none of us saw Jesus crucified but if
[29:51] you really believe that he is the savior
[29:53] of the word world you got more faith
[29:55] than you know hallelujah
[29:58] see faith is something that flexes
[30:00] itself all the time when he wants to
[30:02] faith is so simple you don't have to
[30:07] fast 40 days and get faith you don't
[30:11] have to you know well you know cry all
[30:13] night long to get faith hallelujah why
[30:17] are you sitting at the Hebrew boys they
[30:20] prayed all night long and at the end of
[30:23] the test God didn't even show up
[30:25] hallelujah but they say whether he he
[30:28] deliver us or not that's faith we're got
[30:31] not going to bow down to your image in
[30:35] other words I am going to trust his
[30:38] solution and whatever he's desiring for
[30:41] me I am going to trust him and nothing
[30:45] can deter me from trusting him
[30:47] hallelujah oh god help us here really
[30:51] remember it meant coming from Daniel 7
[30:55] in which he says I believe back there
[30:57] before the interlude and instruction
[30:59] back in the days of Job and so forth
[31:01] that they kept the time by the stars and
[31:04] we understand Stuart listen the prophet
[31:07] of God goes on and say you know what
[31:08] calls the problem with this whole world
[31:12] being destroyed because Satan overthrew
[31:17] mankind
[31:19] this was his as well when he conquered
[31:22] Adam in the Garden of Eden he overthrew
[31:25] Adam and he became the god of this world
[31:29] hallelujah see when you is like a coup
[31:33] you you gather your people of interest
[31:35] and you go in and you thoughts and they
[31:37] take over and when you do that you
[31:41] literally taking over so that you can
[31:43] be in control hallelujah that's what we
[31:47] need to do with the devil because we are
[31:49] in control we are the ones exactly right
[31:54] and you and I must understand that God

[34:36] the Bible says in second Timothy 2 this
[34:39] know also that in the last days perilous
[34:41] times shall come for me and shall be
[34:43] lovers of their own selves covetous
[34:45] boasters proud blasphemers disobedient
[34:48] to parents that truth unthankful God
[34:52] knows that truth unholy without natural
[34:54] affection God knows that truth truth
[34:57] breakers false accusers incontinent
[34:58] fierce despisers of those that are good
[35:01] church people traitors heady highminded
[35:06] lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
[35:08] God charge people having a form of
[35:12] godliness but denying the power thereof
[35:14] from such turn away hallelujah what are
[35:17] you saying everybody that names the name
[35:20] of Jesus Christ supposed to depart from
[35:22] iniquity everybody Amen that that claims
[35:26] the name of Jesus Christ supposed to
[35:28] have power in their lives these signs
[35:31] shall follow them that believe not him
[35:34] damn hallelujah
[35:37] is that all I turn away from the man who
[35:41] don't believe in miracles turn away from
[35:44] the men who don't believe in healings
[35:45] and all of the miraculous things of God
[35:47] turn away from that nonsense what are
[35:50] you saying that's what has overthrown a
[35:52] lot of people in the message because
[35:54] they call it Pentecost we're beyond
[35:58] Pentecost so we don't need speaking in
[36:01] tongues we need it one brother asked me
[36:05] say brother before you speak I said not
[36:07] only do I speak in tongues I got a gift
[36:08] for tongues I said but you know what
[36:11] if the atmosphere in right and ain't
[36:13] nobody calling for God to do nothing it
[36:15] ain't gonna work cuz I can't do it on my
[36:17] own I can jabber I can speak in tongues
[36:20] but I don't know what I'm sayin
[36:22] and why would I do that if I don't know
[36:24] what I'm sayin mmm there are time that
[36:27] God has given me interpretations mmm
[36:30] but that's God I can't do that on my own
[36:34] and I will not do it that but the
[36:36] saddest thing is if I'm that way who
[36:39] else is that way
[36:41] who else is suffering from somebody's
[36:45] Creed you know what they did say okay we
[36:49] put those gifts in the back room and I
[36:50] ain't never seen a back room yet
[36:52] name on top of it for the gifts
[36:56] hallelujah and you know what's so bad
[36:59] about that they look at brother Brandon
[37:01] said well you know he did that well but
[37:04] his gifts were mature there's a time he
[37:08] allowed all those things that take place
[37:09] in his service hallelujah but when he
[37:12] felt like they was ever but you and
[37:14] level that's when he said okay y'all do
[37:17] this before the service but to find out
[37:19] that the devil crept in and said we're
[37:22] not gonna do that because brother
[37:23] Branham put her in the closet or
[37:25] wherever he put him let me say it like
[37:27] this but we must have the wisdom that
[37:30] the prophet of God had you can't put a
[37:34] gift you know in a back room or whatever
[37:37] Amen without seeing it growing mature
[37:43] and ain't no use in speaking in tongues
[37:45] and ain't nobody there to interpret now
[37:47] you can get excited and speak in tongues
[37:50] and that's okay I know the difference I
[37:56] know when a man or woman is rejoicing in
[37:58] the spirit and I know when there's a
[38:00] message whoo hallelujah but you see you
[38:08] know I must understand by God's grace I
[38:10] mean you saw went to a Pentecostal
[38:12] church everybody spoke in tongues now
[38:14] one non person to interpret for speaking
[38:17] in tongues would what we supposed to do
[38:20] and that don't get me
[38:22] [Laughter]
[38:27] you understand me
[38:29] we must overthrow this Creed we must
[38:36] pray God restore the gifts but not only
[38:40] that we must say the Lord restore the
[38:43] life of the people cuz we don't want the
[38:46] gifts if the life is not here hmm we
[38:52] need a life change in this place not
[38:55] just in this place all over the message
[38:57] and because people who are so so awkward
[39:01] brother Bannerman this was I don't care
[39:03] about that it's what they're preaching
[39:06] because if Jesus Christ is the same
[39:09] yesterday today and forever what they
[39:11] did then we supposed to be doing now did
[39:18] all everything stopped when he left but
[39:21] he knew most of it would go come to a
[39:23] season or in because people's faith is
[39:26] no longer the way it used to be God is
[39:29] not there number one God must become our
[39:33] number one that's the differ between us
[39:36] in Azusa Street God was their number one
[39:40] hallelujah
[39:42] what are you talking about creeds I mean
[39:44] any system or doctrine or formula or
[39:46] religious belief and we got it let me
[39:50] say it like that brother I've said it
[39:52] many talk about Amen song service being
[39:55] a half hour or 45 minutes don't you know
[39:58] if the Holy Ghost comes in here who
[40:01] gonna stop him he said God won't do that
[40:06] yes he will
[40:07] it was in the scripture Amen that that
[40:10] that's why they call that's why they
[40:12] have a saying among the Jews Jesus was a
[40:14] thief because he went and ate the man's
[40:16] corn on the Sabbath day that way is gone
[40:20] he healed on the Sabbath day
[40:22] he said Sabbath amen was it demand was
[40:26] to lord over the Sabbath not the Sabbath
[40:28] over the law over the man we had the
[40:31] Lord over these things we're free
[40:35] folks we are free there are no laws but
[40:39] love that's but reasonable to be free
[40:45] enough to understand when God is moving
[40:47] I've seen people interrupt the Holy
[40:49] Ghost and stop this and stop that and
[40:52] they don't know what they were doing
[40:54] even when I was in South Africa the Holy
[40:57] Ghost was moving we had a tent full of
[40:59] people in the nomination of people more
[41:00] than anybody and and then people were
[41:02] coming to the altar and everything else
[41:04] and this preacher who was a pastor a man
[41:06] came and he interrupted and stopped it
[41:08] me and the brother that was there amen
[41:11] uh-uh we cried we cried we prayed almost
[41:14] all night we talked about it hallelujah
[41:16] less than a year that man is dead so you
[41:20] don't interrupt God like that because of
[41:23] your own personal feelings jealousies
[41:26] and that's what it was he was jealous to
[41:29] see God move like that and he stopped it
[41:31] he tried to do the same thing in Durban
[41:33] and God wouldn't allow him so he left
[41:36] and guess what came out of that meeting
[41:39] a preacher who's now a pastor there in
[41:42] Durban Zulu Church hallelujah you
[41:46] understand me see when God is moving
[41:49] Amen is God
[41:50] overthrowing and when you tried to stop
[41:53] God from overthrowing the enemy you
[41:56] become God's enemy that's why he tell
[42:01] Peter said Peters he said say to get
[42:03] behind me why cuz you telling me you
[42:07] saying something that's not in the world
[42:09] it came to you that's the devil talking
[42:12] right now so he arrested that devil he
[42:18] overthrew him in a moment's time
[42:21] hallelujah is that all right
[42:24] you and I must understand Amen this if
[42:27] we're gonna if we're gonna be what God
[42:29] wants us to be in this message we cannot
[42:31] follow what other people are doing we
[42:33] must stay with what brother Branham said
[42:35] and follow the scriptures right to the
[42:37] end if Jesus Christ is the same
[42:40] yesterday today and forever that's who
[42:42] he is
[42:43] hallelujah oh we're in the bride with
[42:46] we're beyond all that and most of those
[42:48] people can't even
[42:49] right hallelujah I'd rather have a
[42:53] pillow cause to fly in here with
[42:55] everybody shouting in katsudon speaking
[42:57] in tongues and interpreting tongues and
[42:59] healings and whatever they call
[43:01] Pentecost I'd rather see that happening
[43:03] here
[43:04] Amen than anything then what they're
[43:07] following some intellectual stuff and
[43:11] I'll tell you what they put it together
[43:12] and it sounds good
[43:14] but how much how many times you left out
[43:16] feeling like you were Samson oh how many
[43:21] times you feel felt like when you left
[43:23] out of that service you felt like it was
[43:24] really changed see that the word comes
[43:29] to change you it comes to cause people
[43:34] to repent get on that altar and ask God
[43:36] to help them and cleanse them or
[43:37] whatever the case may be it comes to
[43:39] enlighten you to where you are and where
[43:41] you should be
[43:45] it's okay he said listen this is a good
[43:49] quote this is good call coming from
[43:52] Easter seal he's about that Creed that's
[43:55] always been right and wrong wrong trying
[43:59] to overthrow the right it started in
[44:02] Eden and it has because it come down
[44:04] through the ages it comes down to the
[44:07] enter into the national affair it comes
[44:10] down into the church affairs it comes
[44:12] down into the home life Creed trying to
[44:16] rule over rule or ruling ruin trying to
[44:20] overpower push out and we see that
[44:23] things working everywhere and it has had
[44:26] it always has the same thing trying to
[44:30] overrule or overrun when I came to this
[44:34] message there were gifts and power of
[44:35] God people everywhere Michigan you name
[44:39] it times when prep preachers was gonna
[44:43] go somewhere and and all of a sudden a
[44:45] town came forth and the interpretation
[44:47] comes as no it's not the will of the
[44:49] Lord for you to go now it happened and
[44:52] then when the preacher overrode that say
[44:54] he fell I'm a witness the hound through
[45:00] the sea you see him God is just real
[45:03] God talks back to you down through the
[45:08] Old Testament God in the days of the
[45:10] prophets back I got several of them
[45:12] written down there that I will not have
[45:15] time to get to but God in the days of
[45:18] the old prophets in the midst of
[45:20] everything like he did in the Garden of
[45:22] Eden when the true voice of God and the
[45:25] true worship of God was condemned and
[45:27] sent out and killed in the Garden of
[45:30] Eden and the voice of God hushed by the
[45:32] Creed's and jealousies has been that way
[45:35] in the church ever since trying to hush
[45:37] the true voice of God but if you
[45:39] hallelujah
[45:40] but if you notice as soon as the voice
[45:43] of Abel was silent in death God raised
[45:45] up self to take his place which was
[45:48] nothing but a pre Easter a pre
[45:50] resurrection or replacement until
[45:51] reservation came that's when that went
[45:55] for a while down to the Old Testament we
[45:57] find it going the prophets God kept his
[45:59] voice alive with the prophets they spoke
[46:02] the Word of God and they stoned them and
[46:05] as soon as they were stoned one and put
[46:07] him away God would rise up another one
[46:10] and they would've thrown that one and
[46:12] put away and God would raise up another
[46:14] one he always kept his witness alive
[46:17] down through the ages he kept his voice
[46:20] alive before the people and all the way
[46:23] from Eden huh
[46:25] see that's what I'm saying what if and I
[46:28] believe it what if God has called this
[46:31] little assembly that keep his voice
[46:33] alive that means we can't allow
[46:36] hallelujah foolishness and look around
[46:39] all but this is the way they do it and
[46:41] this is the way they do it and therefore
[46:42] we supposed to do it like we some kind
[46:44] of organization or some system it is a
[46:47] Creed I never forget it when I lived in
[46:55] Lima me excuse me Columbia South
[46:57] Carolina and we had a brother Amen all
[46:59] the way from Trinidad and he came in our
[47:02] church and he said what this don't look
[47:03] like a message Church I don't forget
[47:05] that one unless is Church supposed to
[47:07] look like it is
[47:12] you know these pitches on the wall makes
[47:13] a message church that's a clean that's
[47:16] nonsense
[47:19] God don't favor this church because we
[47:22] got paintings on the wall I don't care
[47:28] nothing about all that on the wall God
[47:30] cares about your heart what about those
[47:34] old saints of God they had to hide in
[47:36] caves you think they had the picture of
[47:38] Paul on the wall hallelujah
[47:47] y'all knows the truth but people that
[47:50] get offended if you want if they walked
[47:52] in here and then see a painting or
[47:53] something on the wall they say what this
[47:55] don't look like a mess his church
[47:57] nonsense
[47:58] that's a Creed until we overcome this
[48:02] nonsense we ain't going nowhere you and
[48:05] I got a die-in right like I read that
[48:12] quote unless anything dies in rot this
[48:16] is number the truth and I know they're
[48:17] gonna hear me if they listen to it here
[48:19] we are down there in Iowa City and we
[48:22] got all these things up on the on the
[48:24] glass and it's net and and the lady
[48:26] didn't see a cross she says it's just a
[48:29] Christian Church oh my god yeah it's a
[48:32] Christian Church
[48:33] she said well where's the cross is he
[48:37] because even a Christian Church should
[48:40] have a cross if you gonna have anything
[48:42] have a cross Oh y'all get it y'all
[48:49] understand what I'm saying
[48:50] there was nothing she could identify
[48:52] with by what all she saw she could not
[48:55] identify God with an ego she could not
[48:57] identify God with the picture with the
[48:59] vilifies she couldn't identify but she
[49:01] could identify the cross and I told that
[49:04] brother we need a cross up here
[49:10] help us Jesus I want to see God real
[49:13] people I'm not interested in you know
[49:16] being accepted I've been there already
[49:19] and everybody ain't gonna accept you
[49:21] people don't talk about you anyhow no
[49:24] matter how close you walk with God
[49:26] they're gonna talk about you why you
[49:29] have been ordained for persecution the
[49:33] Bible said those who live godly in
[49:35] Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution
[49:44] hallelujah it's just okay he taught he
[49:49] could do it right let me let me let me
[49:52] let me move back up because he did it
[49:54] himself
[49:54] imma Moses he took it upon himself to do
[49:58] it and anytime you take things upon
[50:01] yourself and leave God out then you're
[50:03] going to be a failure like Moses was
[50:05] yeah and he thought he could do it and
[50:09] that's what's wrong with a lot of
[50:11] preachers they think they can change and
[50:12] transform the people themselves you
[50:14] can't do a thing if the word don't
[50:16] transform them nothing will you can use
[50:19] all your rules and all your regulations
[50:21] and all your law and ain't nothing gonna
[50:24] change them until God change them the
[50:26] only thing we can do is preach the word
[50:29] hoping and trusting that the word will
[50:31] take a place in their hearts but that's
[50:34] what Moses taught right you seen you
[50:37] remember David counted the people in God
[50:39] told David don't number the people why
[50:41] because David that thought by numbing
[50:44] the people amen that he had power to do
[50:47] what he was doing
[50:47] it never was David's power it never was
[50:50] the people it was God the battle is the
[50:54] Lord did not God say that anything about
[50:58] all our good deeds or anything like that
[51:00] it is God finding favor with God went
[51:08] out over and had married a wife and he
[51:10] got him a job herding sheep mmm any
[51:14] merit I just throw the priest a minute
[51:16] in he married his daughter and there was
[51:18] two children born to him and he got a
[51:20] common laborer job and a sheep herder
[51:22] and had
[51:22] herding sheep for 40 years because he
[51:25] failed to put God first 40 years he
[51:29] suffered and went through all of that 40
[51:31] years because he failed to do God's will
[51:34] or put God first I think that's what
[51:38] happened that's the matter with the
[51:40] church's brother when it gets to a place
[51:42] that we put our church first instead of
[51:44] Christ we're going to right we're going
[51:47] right straight down you put them as an
[51:50] individual put your church first your
[51:53] social life first instead of your
[51:55] spiritual life you going to fail hmm you
[52:01] and I we got a right to this thing
[52:03] hallelujah we think we're crazy because
[52:05] we go to turn hallelujah I get jealous
[52:08] over Catholics 6 o'clock in the morning
[52:11] you find there y'all pack
[52:13] oh we cause people going to Mass don't
[52:18] tell me they do don't do it cuz I used
[52:20] to go to Mass 6 o'clock in the morning
[52:22] 12 o'clock at noon hallelujah and I mean
[52:26] it's just full of folks and then you got
[52:28] what we call the truth the message and
[52:31] hardly nobody shows up what's that
[52:37] what's that one thing for certain if
[52:40] going to church was savory they would be
[52:42] smaller than saved than us hey maybe we
[52:49] need to change houses 6:00 in the
[52:50] morning don't even try hallelujah you
[53:00] see what I'm saying what we don't
[53:03] understand is that the devil has
[53:04] overthrown a lot of us and people don't
[53:07] even notice it we almost like Labor's
[53:10] here we think we you know we rich we
[53:12] increase with good and we have meat or
[53:14] nothing oh how with the church once a
[53:16] week and I with the church amen where's
[53:18] the I with the church amen
[53:20] as if you paying God some dues it's all
[53:24] wrong I don't know I was gonna be
[53:30] preaching like this I wish I had a
[53:31] church fool hallelujah right
[53:36] he said unless a man die and rot in his
[53:39] own thoughts Christ can't get into his
[53:43] heart when you're trying to think for
[53:46] yourself now if I walk up to the altar
[53:48] and say I'm a fine fella I take you I
[53:51] pay my tithe I'll do this you got to
[53:54] dine right there right there to your
[53:56] thoughts
[53:57] now you can't flatter God and God knows
[54:02] that most of our promises ain't that
[54:04] belies as soon as he give us a break we
[54:08] return from it y'all know it's the truth
[54:11] that's why the Bible said it best not to
[54:13] even promise him that don't swear cuz
[54:17] you ain't gonna keep it use it for what
[54:21] the glow you saw a Lord God out of what
[54:23] do i what what do I have
[54:25] have you heard that message what's in
[54:27] your hand David only had a sling but he
[54:32] used it he used it and brother Graham
[54:38] said is just as real today and he's just
[54:41] that fanatically in the side of the
[54:43] world not only the world but on a lot of
[54:46] church members just as phonetic you see
[54:49] that's the thing when you really get
[54:50] serious about God even your own people
[54:52] thank you fanatical you're charged
[54:54] people all that ain't necessary
[54:57] mm-hmm Ike I don't heard that so many
[54:59] times it is necessary
[55:05] somebody said let me tell you something
[55:07] I think about those are Sarah films in
[55:11] and how they they crying holy holy holy
[55:15] Oh all day all day all day don't even
[55:18] get tired it probably said after they
[55:22] finished I'll come to almost whatever I
[55:24] don't know where there's a finisher but
[55:25] after a little oh let me say it one more
[55:26] time oh can I say it again oh you
[55:31] understand me because his holiness is so
[55:34] beyond what we can think of or fathom or
[55:38] or imagine to all you can say is that's
[55:40] the holiest of Holies
[55:43] I my income in my comprehension he's
[55:46] only but he it this there's a place he's
[55:48] holier than the holiness he said we
[55:55] might not even have a stick maybe you
[55:58] only sing a song you can testify
[56:01] something whatever you got do it use it
[56:05] for the glory of God no matter what it
[56:07] is if you can't sing you can't whistle
[56:12] can't testify just pass out tracts do
[56:16] something else let's get going ever
[56:20] what's in your hand use it for the glory
[56:23] of God God always had men who stick by
[56:27] him all the new young you see what I'm
[56:30] saying Israel army all backed up they
[56:32] got away from God that's the only reason
[56:35] why we all feel what he can do to us cuz
[56:38] we done got away from God hallelujah
[56:41] but David he was with him he he he said
[56:44] the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not
[56:47] want
[56:47] hallelujah see David understood amen I
[56:50] by God's help I will overthrow this
[56:54] position that Goliath says he's God
[56:57] right and David was so confident you
[57:00] know what he said he said listen I think
[57:05] Goliath said it but he took backed him
[57:06] up he says listen if my men if I win
[57:09] then you're you're gonna serve north as
[57:12] Dave you gonna serve my god but if you
[57:14] win then you can serve our God however
[57:16] they are basically saying whoever win
[57:19] must serve the will of God and David was
[57:23] confident oh Lord I don't know where
[57:26] they look no sure he knew it so much so
[57:29] he began to prophesy he said listen man
[57:31] imma tell you you're uncircumcised
[57:34] philistine you don't even have the Holy
[57:36] Ghost and I know what I got
[57:37] hallelujah and because I know I've been
[57:40] circumcised he said I am gonna take your
[57:43] sword and I'm gonna cut your head off
[57:45] with it and guess what David did after
[57:50] that he ran toward the devil he didn't
[57:53] run behind him he didn't turn his back
[57:54] hallelujah he ran
[57:56] and toward the devil and see that's what
[57:58] I'm saying you and I need to start
[58:00] running towards Satan within in our
[58:03] prayers don't run from him because
[58:06] you've got to understand devil has no
[58:08] power over us
[58:09] none the only power Satan has over us is
[58:13] what we give him he has none he was
[58:17] defeated at Calvary he lost his
[58:20] authority hallelujah and almost all his
[58:23] teeth he's just a lion with no teeth
[58:27] hallelujah a bee with no stinger has
[58:32] nothing over us and you and I must
[58:34] realize they meant that we do have the
[58:36] power if you have to say that to
[58:38] yourself every day I have the power and
[58:40] the authority over the devil I have the
[58:42] power and authority of the devil
[58:44] eventually you're gonna believe and once
[58:48] you believe it you'll become a David
[58:51] teach me Lord teach me that way or Lord
[58:54] lead me in the path plane path because
[58:58] of my enemies deliver me not all over
[59:00] unto other will of mine enemies for
[59:03] false witnesses I risen up against me
[59:05] and such as breathe out cruelty you know
[59:09] what I had read that many times but I'm
[59:12] gonna tell you something nothing hurts
[59:13] as much as a bold-faced lie told against
[59:18] you when a lie and you know it's a lie
[59:22] and there is no way you can defend
[59:24] yourself
[59:25] I've been there a lie bad lie it's still
[59:33] going on among some people you can't
[59:35] stop them
[59:36] cuz some people love lies you didn't
[59:39] know that
[59:40] oh yeah watch them crazy magazines they
[59:43] got out there a Martian came in visit
[59:46] President Trump stuff like that people
[59:49] loved him they grabbed it they'd love to
[59:53] read crazy stuff they found an you have
[59:58] o in the desert oh my see people love
[1:00:02] that they see that Mexico I got to read
[1:00:04] this but give them the truth they won't
[1:00:07] have nothing to do with it
[1:00:11] so when allies told about you you know
[1:00:14] what you got to have a lot of people
[1:00:16] that's going to believe it and there's
[1:00:17] nothing you can do to change that you
[1:00:20] say that's not true it is true they
[1:00:22] believed all those lies about Jesus
[1:00:24] didn't it
[1:00:25] hallelujah see you don't have to worry
[1:00:30] wait on the Lord and be of good courage
[1:00:32] and he shall strengthen what dying heart
[1:00:35] wait I say on the Lord is that right
[1:00:38] listen that's what that's what David
[1:00:40] said he said I had fainted unless I had
[1:00:43] believed to see the goodness of the Lord
[1:00:45] in the land of the living
[1:00:47] I had a hope I got my eyes focused
[1:00:51] hallelujah is that right
[1:00:54] Lord beloved behold what manner of love
[1:00:56] the father has bestowed upon us that we
[1:00:58] should be called the sons of God and
[1:01:00] that's what God wants you to be sons of
[1:01:02] God not just call he won't action
[1:01:06] therefore the world North us not because
[1:01:09] it knew him not beloved now are we the
[1:01:11] sons of God and that's what we must
[1:01:13] understand that in that church in the
[1:01:16] beginning you had a false vine and a
[1:01:18] true vine and in this message you got a
[1:01:21] false vine and a true vine hallelujah
[1:01:25] that true vine will always believe in
[1:01:27] the power of the blood hallelujah he
[1:01:30] that true vine knows I don't care what
[1:01:32] Jesus my God said I am if it ain't so
[1:01:36] until the blood has been applied
[1:01:39] hallelujah amen
[1:01:41] you and I must understand this thing
[1:01:43] means something that we can work with
[1:01:44] our play with it's a real a reality
[1:01:49] because Jesus will talk back to you he
[1:01:55] said if you open your heart to Christ he
[1:01:58] will talk to you yes uh that's a quote
[1:02:02] coming from what is in your hand I'm a
[1:02:05] closed with this one
[1:02:06] second chronicles 34 one through seven
[1:02:09] I'm gonna read it and said Josiah was
[1:02:12] eight years old when he began to reign I
[1:02:15] ate your boy now and he reigned in
[1:02:17] Jerusalem one and third thirty years and
[1:02:20] he did what that which was right in the
[1:02:24] of God and walked in the ways of David
[1:02:27] his father and declined
[1:02:29] neither to the right hand nor to the
[1:02:31] left for in the eighth year of his reign
[1:02:34] while he was yet young he began to seek
[1:02:37] after the God of David his father and in
[1:02:40] the twelfth year he began to prayer
[1:02:43] Judah and Jerusalem from the high places
[1:02:46] and the groves and the carved image and
[1:02:48] the mountain images and they bit and
[1:02:51] they break down the ultra Balaam in in
[1:02:54] his presence and the images and what
[1:02:56] were on high above a man he cut down and
[1:02:59] the groves and the carved images and in
[1:03:02] the mountain images he breaking pieces
[1:03:05] and made dust of them and strode it upon
[1:03:07] the graves of them that had sacrificed
[1:03:09] unto them and he burnt the bones of the
[1:03:12] priests upon their altar and cleansed
[1:03:14] Judah and Jerusalem hallelujah that's
[1:03:17] what we need to do burn some of them
[1:03:19] priests on the altars Oh merci they need
[1:03:28] a real or God help me so Lord and so did
[1:03:31] he in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim
[1:03:33] you know if you preach their days even
[1:03:35] in messages you got started getting into
[1:03:37] people's lives preachers they don't you
[1:03:39] they're gonna call your wife beater or
[1:03:42] what was brother Branham mm-hmm
[1:03:46] they don't want white beat us hmm
[1:03:50] we don't we don't will we don't beat
[1:03:53] wives a real righteous person would love
[1:03:55] correction and so did he that city of
[1:03:58] Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon even
[1:04:01] unto naphtha live with their Matt talks
[1:04:04] around about them now you got to
[1:04:05] understand the flesh do not like being
[1:04:07] corrected but the soul does hallelujah
[1:04:12] when you being corrected that there's a
[1:04:15] grievous moment but then you look at the
[1:04:17] fruit it produces afterwards and when he
[1:04:20] had broken down the altar and the groves
[1:04:22] and he had beaten it the graven image
[1:04:24] into powder and cut down all the idols
[1:04:26] throughout all the land of Israel he
[1:04:28] returned to Jerusalem and I'm gonna
[1:04:30] leave it right there
[1:04:31] my point is amen we are over throwers
[1:04:35] and we're not here to be Oh
[1:04:38] thrown it has been we are ordained to
[1:04:41] complete the mission of God and
[1:04:43] somewhere somehow we're gonna have to
[1:04:46] break through we're gonna have to get
[1:04:49] out of this this this this thing and
[1:04:52] when I say that you know I don't mean
[1:04:55] that we've got to attack anybody else
[1:04:57] I'm just saying we must get out of this
[1:05:00] little schism thing that we we we gotta
[1:05:03] be we get becoming too formal we
[1:05:06] becoming starchy we need to let the Holy
[1:05:10] Ghost come up in here and my point is
[1:05:12] this we don't we don't have to be
[1:05:14] beautiful singers let's give God all we
[1:05:17] got with whatever we got y'all
[1:05:19] understand me if you really want God to
[1:05:21] come on the scene you you join with me
[1:05:24] John let us join together and focus not
[1:05:27] focusing on the rapture the coming of
[1:05:30] the Lord and start thinking about what
[1:05:32] we must do to get back in line right
[1:05:36] because that bride got out of line and
[1:05:39] we need to get back in line
[1:05:41] hallelujah that we may see a catching
[1:05:44] away of the body of Christ I believe
[1:05:47] that with all my heart
[1:05:48] we must overthrow the devil in our lives
[1:05:51] whatever it may be I cannot do your job
[1:05:54] you can't do mine but I know the Bible
[1:05:57] say the prayer of a righteous man
[1:05:58] availeth much hallelujah and if we just
[1:06:01] get down the praise that's what the song
[1:06:03] say when the people get down to pray huh
[1:06:06] they which are called by my name if they
[1:06:09] would humble themselves and pray and
[1:06:11] seek my face and turn from their wicked
[1:06:14] ways he said then there hear from heaven
[1:06:17] and I will heal no man that's what we
[1:06:21] want that's what I want
[1:06:23] hallelujah less tan
[1:06:36] in the press
[1:06:38] Oh Jehovah God Almighty
