[46:36] the anointed word
[46:40] ofac we appreciate Lord Jesus Christ we
[46:43] still have something to say and uh we'll
[46:46] just get right into the word because of
[46:48] the lateness of the hour we're going to
[46:50] ask that you turn with us to judges the
[46:52] 13th chapter
[46:57] we appreciate you all um staying around
[47:01] and uh we had no idea was going to take
[47:04] us this long to get
[47:05] back we had two in one
[47:09] Service uh but it all turned out really
[47:12] well at least I left there feeling that
[47:14] way so we'll praise the Lord for that
[47:16] and
[47:18] uh so uh I'm just going to reiterate
[47:22] some of the things that I did say uh
[47:24] this morning in Iowa City just to just
[47:28] to get us all on one
[47:30] Accord um as I said turn with us to uh
[47:33] judges the 13th chapter there's a lot to
[47:36] be said in this chapter uh understand by
[47:39] God's grace that I I constantly say that
[47:42] we're living in the last days
[47:45] and maybe I'm beside myself but I I like
[47:48] being this way because it keeps me
[47:50] watching and praying so we're going to
[47:54] read
[47:59] I had no idea it was Charles's birthday
[48:01] did y'all know
[48:03] that
[48:05] okay
[48:07] okay but they desired to come and I I
[48:09] don't know whether it's because I stayed
[48:10] in church so long till their parents
[48:12] decided that they couldn't come because
[48:15] they didn't want them coming back at
[48:16] night so had I known that I would have
[48:18] done a little better but I I just what
[48:21] didn't know so anyway uh they did want
[48:23] to come but the parent says no so it's
[48:26] okay
[48:28] I begin to read and the children of
[48:30] Israel did Evil again in the sight of
[48:33] the Lord and the Lord delivered them
[48:36] into the hands of the Philistines 40
[48:38] years and there was a certain man of zor
[48:42] of the family of the danites whose name
[48:45] was manoah and his wife was baren and
[48:49] bared not and the angel of the Lord
[48:52] appeared unto the woman and said unto
[48:54] her behold now Thou Art baren and
[48:58] beareth not but Thou shalt conceive and
[49:01] bear a son now therefore beware I pray
[49:05] thee and drink not wine nor strong drink
[49:09] and eat not any unclean thing for Lo
[49:13] Thou shalt conceive and bear a son and
[49:16] no razor shall come upon his head for
[49:19] the child shall be a Nazarite unto God
[49:22] from the womb and he shall begin to
[49:25] deliver Israel out of the hands of the
[49:29] Philistines then the woman came and told
[49:31] her husband and saying a man of God came
[49:34] unto me and his continent was like the
[49:37] countenance of an angel of God very
[49:40] terrible but I asked him not whence he
[49:43] was neither told he me his name but he
[49:48] said unto me behold Thou shalt conceive
[49:50] and bear a son and and uh and now drink
[49:54] no wine nor strong drink neither eat any
[49:57] unclean thing for the child shall be a
[50:00] Nazarite to God whom the womb from the
[50:03] womb to the day of his death then manoah
[50:07] intreated the Lord and said oh my Lord
[50:11] let the man of God which thou did Sin
[50:14] come again unto us and teach us what we
[50:16] shall do unto the child that shall be
[50:20] born and God hearkened to the voice of
[50:23] manoah and the angel of God came unto
[50:26] the woman woman as she sat in the field
[50:30] but no but manoah her husband was not
[50:33] with her and the woman made haste and
[50:36] ran and showed her husband and said unto
[50:39] him behold the man have appeared unto me
[50:42] that came unto me the other day and
[50:46] manoah arose and went after his wife and
[50:49] came to the man and he said unto him art
[50:51] thou the man that speaketh unto the
[50:54] woman he said I am and Mano said now let
[50:57] thy words come to pass how shall we
[51:00] order uh the child and how shall we do
[51:04] unto him and the angel of the Lord said
[51:06] unto manoah of all that I have said unto
[51:09] you to the woman let her beware she may
[51:13] not eat of anything that come cometh of
[51:16] the thine neither let her drink wine or
[51:20] strong drink nor eat of any unclean
[51:23] thing all that I command her let her
[51:26] observe and manoah said unto the angel
[51:29] of the Lord I pray thee let us detain
[51:31] thee until we have made ready a kid for
[51:34] thee and the angel of the Lord said unto
[51:36] manoah though thou detain me I will not
[51:40] eat of excuse
[51:42] me thy bread and if thou Wilt offer a
[51:46] burnt offering thou must offer it unto
[51:48] the Lord for vano knew not that he was
[51:51] an angel of the Lord that's very
[51:53] important and manoah said unto the angel
[51:56] of the Lord what is thy name and when he
[51:59] when thy uh excuse me and when thy
[52:02] saying come to pass we may do these
[52:05] honor and the angel of the Lord said
[52:07] unto him why ask thou thus after my name
[52:12] seeing it is a
[52:14] secret let's just stop there father God
[52:17] we come before you Lord we thank you for
[52:19] your grace we thank you for your mercy
[52:22] we thank you for all that you have done
[52:24] for us and everything that you are doing
[52:26] doing for us we pray this evening that
[52:29] you would bless oh God uh our eyes that
[52:33] we may see let thy perfect will be done
[52:36] in our lives Lord in Jesus Christ's name
[52:39] we pray pray amen you may be
[52:46] seated we went deer hunting yesterday
[52:48] and didn't get
[52:50] one but as the deer was coming my way it
[52:54] decided to change its mind and go the
[52:56] other way
[52:57] and my neighbor ended up getting the
[53:00] deer so at least we got
[53:03] something but I thank God for the
[53:05] experience and uh I appreciate God for
[53:07] being so good to me because I've always
[53:09] wanted to Dear
[53:11] hunt eyes to see remember I was going to
[53:14] work with that uh the last
[53:17] service having eyes to
[53:20] see is important and as young people as
[53:23] young men we want you to understand that
[53:26] this particular uh scripture reading was
[53:28] read once again in the message I believe
[53:31] once more oh Lord once more was the one
[53:33] done after the seals were open and you
[53:38] know a lot of times I coming up in the
[53:40] message we thought the message oh Lord
[53:42] once more was given basically to those
[53:44] who were of the denomination wanting a
[53:47] refilling wed a new experience with God
[53:50] but after the seals we know that the
[53:52] door has already brother brandom had
[53:54] already been thrown out of the system
[53:56] they were no longer having much to do
[53:58] with him and now he was now focusing on
[54:01] a bride because his ministry had change
[54:04] it was no longer just to the
[54:06] denomination but it was it was actually
[54:09] to the bride remember brother brandom
[54:10] said the move is on for the bride and
[54:13] God had now taken a church out of a
[54:15] church right so we got to understand too
[54:19] that none of us at that time or any of
[54:21] them at that time because I wasn't
[54:23] living they did not know that brother
[54:25] Brandon was going to pass they didn't
[54:28] know that he was going to change but he
[54:30] kept trying to tell them as like John
[54:33] did I must decrease and he must increase
[54:36] when I'm talking uh working with judges
[54:39] I I want you to understand that that God
[54:43] took an imperfect
[54:45] man and made him a man of a a man who
[54:49] was full of false like you and I we are
[54:53] full of false we we have to confess
[54:55] every day
[54:57] but understand that this man was chosen
[55:01] to be something that in his own power he
[55:04] could never be God called him to be a
[55:08] Nazarite he could he was not to drink
[55:11] wine he was not to run with women he was
[55:14] not to uh uh engage himself in any
[55:17] unkind in any unclean living he was
[55:21] never Amen to drink or eat anything that
[55:24] was unclean and it just seemed like
[55:26] Samson never got the message cuz he did
[55:30] everything but that and understand this
[55:33] is why I'm I'm talking tonight or today
[55:37] with you young men and I really
[55:38] appreciate the Lord what he's done I
[55:40] appreciate your Zeal uh and and and your
[55:43] desire to serve the Lord you you don't
[55:45] know what staying here meant has me is
[55:49] meaning to me you know the impact that
[55:51] you uh have have placed in my life today
[55:54] because even the Ministry needs an
[55:57] encouragement encouraging they need to
[55:59] be encouraged and your being here has
[56:01] encouraged me so just so that you
[56:04] understand that you being young you know
[56:07] one of the things that uh uh Paul wrote
[56:11] to Timothy to to flee useful lust
[56:14] because he knew that being young as he
[56:17] is he was going to have a
[56:20] battle understand also that when it
[56:23] comes to Samson
[56:26] Samson didn't create himself God created
[56:28] Samson but there's a thing about DNA
[56:31] that follows
[56:33] you whatever in your DNA is there and
[56:37] the only thing that can decode you is
[56:40] God himself he's the only thing that can
[56:42] cancel out all of those things that have
[56:45] traveled for thousands of years and now
[56:48] that are not occupying you in the form
[56:51] of DNA you say well brother I I I think
[56:54] I know I'm safe but let me tell you this
[56:58] Adam had a problem and his problem was
[57:01] that he took his
[57:03] wife without the permission of
[57:07] God and that fall brought in everything
[57:11] else that's right amen and we can cut it
[57:14] short and show you how that after the
[57:16] fall polygamy was introduced because
[57:20] there was that Gene there that had been
[57:22] hybrid it just was mixed with the real
[57:25] thing
[57:27] and without being
[57:29] converted those genes of your fathers
[57:32] your forefathers and all that come
[57:34] before you has potential to live
[57:38] again for 400
[57:40] years it can live again and if somebody
[57:44] else break it and break it and break it
[57:47] and break it it almost become
[57:50] Everlasting your problems what's in your
[57:54] flesh the thing that makes you feel like
[57:56] you're about to lose your mind in this
[57:58] day the thing that Roars every day that
[58:02] that torments you that comes at you in a
[58:04] way that you wonder sometime am I really
[58:08] say
[58:10] but to encourage
[58:13] you that is the
[58:18] normal it is what the fall brought to
[58:21] you right but we understand that if we
[58:25] could just you know brother talked about
[58:26] he talked about getting that young man
[58:28] or that young woman to Jesus Christ
[58:30] before they reach that age of
[58:32] puberty because if the Holy Ghost if he
[58:35] can get that Holy Ghost in him that Holy
[58:37] Ghost has a power to press it down to
[58:39] keep it keep it keep it
[58:42] dead in Samson's life think about it do
[58:46] you think that God didn't know what
[58:48] Samson was going to do brother random
[58:51] preaches a message perfect strength and
[58:53] perfect weakness so he he
[58:57] knew he knew in this day the weakness of
[59:00] the Bride he understood what she was
[59:03] going to go through she he understood
[59:05] The Temptations and many times he saw
[59:07] the corruption of the world and he
[59:09] prayed oh God for his own children
[59:12] Rebecca and Joseph and the rest of them
[59:14] because he knew what they were going to
[59:16] face he understood and he said amen
[59:19] without the Holy Ghost what happens rock
[59:22] and roll going to get that person you
[59:25] see you have no power over this
[59:26] particular Gene in your life without God
[59:30] that's right David who was a
[59:32] king he passed the genetics he passed
[59:35] that corrupted gene on to his own son
[59:38] right David had a problem with women and
[59:41] then now you see over here you see
[59:43] Solomon having the same problem but just
[59:47] worse it doesn't get better and with the
[59:51] uh hybrid foods and everything that
[59:53] we're eating now it somehow it seemed to
[59:57] heightened you know the desires of the
[59:59] world that's in us and this is why Jesus
[1:00:04] told Nicodemus no matter what man you
[1:00:06] must be born again and like I tell
[1:00:09] people I said the problem is we don't
[1:00:12] want to die and we don't want to
[1:00:16] rot and that is where we must come to it
[1:00:19] is what we must come to you know I'm
[1:00:22] Different in the sense that I hate
[1:00:24] religion I hate sister
[1:00:26] I hate everything that makes it look
[1:00:28] make make uh pretend to be God that's
[1:00:31] what I'm saying I don't like that
[1:00:33] because that's where Deception comes in
[1:00:36] I don't want to be deceived you know
[1:00:38] give me the real or give me nothing at
[1:00:40] all right I don't want a substitute or a
[1:00:44] counterfeit holy ghost that works for me
[1:00:47] sometimes I need the Holy Ghost to work
[1:00:49] for me all the time amen and this is
[1:00:52] what I'm trying to tell the people I
[1:00:54] told the people there even in City I
[1:00:56] said don't you understand you and I have
[1:00:59] the potential of becoming the
[1:01:01] manifestation of the prophet's Vision
[1:01:04] right a bribe without spot wrinkle or
[1:01:07] blemish but you got to want
[1:01:10] it right you got to want it it's
[1:01:13] something that you've got to believe
[1:01:14] it's true in spite of everything that
[1:01:17] people are saying it is not you must
[1:01:19] believe that it is true you got to you
[1:01:23] got to believe that what brother Brandon
[1:01:24] preached is truth amen and it was not
[1:01:28] something of his imagination but it was
[1:01:30] something that God revealed to him and I
[1:01:33] believe it with all of my heart amen
[1:01:36] that that we're going to be that I
[1:01:39] cannot accept anything else I can't I
[1:01:43] got a sometimes I feel like in my own
[1:01:45] mind I'm about to lose my mind because I
[1:01:47] so love and thirst God thirst for God
[1:01:50] and at the same time I see all my
[1:01:52] failures anybody know what I'm talking
[1:01:54] about but here was here was uh H uh H H
[1:01:59] Samson who was ordained and he knew his
[1:02:03] parents when Noah and his wife was
[1:02:08] told that you was a proper child and you
[1:02:10] was ordained like many of us born into
[1:02:14] this message you an elected one you've
[1:02:17] been chosen of God and you know these
[1:02:21] things but you still have that Devil's
[1:02:24] desire to do
[1:02:27] evil Hello it is it's there no matter
[1:02:30] how we dress it up it's
[1:02:33] there Hallelujah and you've got to be
[1:02:35] born again you can't allow yourself to
[1:02:38] think that your covering of religion is
[1:02:41] going to make it right it will not
[1:02:44] religion only magnifies your
[1:02:48] problems and so I was telling them you
[1:02:50] know a lot of time we don't want to cry
[1:02:53] out we don't we don't break down enough
[1:02:58] for God to come on the scene because you
[1:02:59] got to understand if we break
[1:03:03] down ourselves like the dead on the day
[1:03:07] of
[1:03:08] Pentecost even after that when those
[1:03:11] people got the Holy Ghost on theza
[1:03:13] street if we break down like brother
[1:03:16] brandham did he was a prophet but you
[1:03:19] know he had to break down he had to
[1:03:22] dissolve all of his thoughts and desires
[1:03:25] he had to come down to say God I am
[1:03:28] nothing I'm
[1:03:30] worthless and until you break down and
[1:03:33] you know re re
[1:03:37] release everything that you think you
[1:03:39] know about God until you come to that
[1:03:42] place you're not going to go anywhere
[1:03:44] because think about it what is
[1:03:49] truth and almost every message Church
[1:03:52] like in the days of
[1:03:53] Judges is Right In Their Own
[1:03:59] eyes the prophet is going off to seeing
[1:04:02] Moses the holy spirit is lifting anybody
[1:04:05] know that yes sir that's why you can't
[1:04:07] get people to do nothing they don't even
[1:04:08] want to worship God they want to but
[1:04:11] they don't have the strength or the
[1:04:12] power I don't know how it all works but
[1:04:15] we're living in a day like the day of
[1:04:17] Judges where everybody every preacher
[1:04:19] everybody think they're right we can't
[1:04:21] all be right there's only one right and
[1:04:25] that just the the word of God Amen but
[1:04:28] you got to understand if that be true
[1:04:30] then I'm like
[1:04:33] Samson I can still cry
[1:04:36] out but Samson failed God so much right
[1:04:42] he was a laughter he was a laughter he
[1:04:45] was the joke of the
[1:04:47] Philistines seen the miracles of god
[1:04:50] seen what God had done picked up the
[1:04:52] gates of Gaza all of these great things
[1:04:54] and brother B said that's just the way
[1:04:56] the Pentecostal Church used to
[1:04:59] be they had power in the
[1:05:01] church but something
[1:05:04] happened cuz I want you to understand
[1:05:07] the coming of the
[1:05:08] Lord because when the angel first
[1:05:11] appeared unto mon Noah's wife it's am
[1:05:14] amazing how she's such a
[1:05:17] mystery and he appears to her and with
[1:05:21] no name but she knew there was something
[1:05:25] special about this man you know kind of
[1:05:28] like the woman at the
[1:05:30] well talk with him just a little bit and
[1:05:33] your deser and kick in this is not an
[1:05:35] ordinary man he may not have looked like
[1:05:38] a cherub he may not have looked like
[1:05:41] a some great Angelic being but he he
[1:05:45] appeared like he was a man don't you see
[1:05:47] what I'm saying that was brother bram's
[1:05:50] ministry right there in the scripture
[1:05:51] part of
[1:05:53] it didn't look like an Angel but they
[1:05:57] say once you got in his
[1:05:59] presence you could feel that love you
[1:06:01] knew something was different about this
[1:06:05] man and one thing I love about brother
[1:06:07] bandam he was not interested in you
[1:06:11] knowing his
[1:06:13] name he wanted you to know something
[1:06:16] greater than
[1:06:17] that so the first appearing of this
[1:06:20] Angel comes to manoah's wife and she
[1:06:23] types out the church B
[1:06:26] AR
[1:06:28] right and she goes to her husband and
[1:06:31] tells her husband of this visitation she
[1:06:34] said but you know he's more than a
[1:06:37] man there's something about this man and
[1:06:40] I can't explain it
[1:06:43] but I believe he was sent by
[1:06:47] God so listen this is amazes me because
[1:06:50] manoah goes and pray and says God if if
[1:06:53] this you be you come again the first
[1:06:57] coming or the first appearing was him
[1:07:00] coming to mano's wife but the second
[1:07:03] appearing amen he comes to Manor's wife
[1:07:06] again why because she's the one that's
[1:07:09] going to bring forth the child the
[1:07:12] promise is given to her think about it
[1:07:15] what scripture you know of where God by
[1:07:19] passes the
[1:07:21] man and then when Mano preaches I mean
[1:07:24] speak prays
[1:07:26] God bypasses Mano again and comes to
[1:07:28] this
[1:07:30] woman and this time the woman has to go
[1:07:32] to
[1:07:33] mano and say hey the angel is
[1:07:37] here now here come Mano now he's coming
[1:07:41] in and he sees this
[1:07:43] man and he's perceiving and see that's
[1:07:46] that that that's the way I love this
[1:07:49] because the true seed of God has a way
[1:07:51] of
[1:07:52] perceiving right and that's what the
[1:07:55] woman at the well as wicked as she was
[1:07:57] she was just like a an example of what
[1:07:59] Samson was no telling what she was or
[1:08:01] should have been but she said I perceive
[1:08:04] that thou art a prophet see when you get
[1:08:06] into the presence of a real godly man or
[1:08:08] a man of God you ought to have a
[1:08:10] perception that he is that's right and
[1:08:14] so what happens amen man Noah began PR
[1:08:17] say say I'm going to detain you we're
[1:08:19] going to make an offering and the angel
[1:08:21] said that's okay you can detain me I'll
[1:08:23] stay here for a while but understand I'm
[1:08:26] not going to eat what you're
[1:08:28] preparing give it unto the Lord what was
[1:08:32] he saying I don't want your praise the
[1:08:36] praise don't belong to me you see where
[1:08:38] I'm at I'm right there where John fell
[1:08:41] at the feet of the Angel and he says
[1:08:43] uhuh uhuh get up worship God and him
[1:08:47] only the same anointing the same kind of
[1:08:50] Angel amen is now in the presence of
[1:08:54] mano
[1:08:56] and his
[1:08:57] wife a mystery is unfolding unto them
[1:09:01] and all of a sudden they do the
[1:09:03] sacrifice and this Angel goes up in the
[1:09:07] fire think about that and then the Bible
[1:09:10] says that Manor perceived that this was
[1:09:14] the angel of the
[1:09:16] Lord such a mystery but you know
[1:09:19] everybody don't understand that the
[1:09:21] message did not come by a man it came by
[1:09:25] the angel of the Lord that's right and
[1:09:28] in all of this you can see seals and
[1:09:31] everything everything's
[1:09:32] unfolding here was Samson now growing up
[1:09:36] now he's he know he's supposed to be
[1:09:38] faithful but it was God's perfect will
[1:09:41] he was like a he was like a a uh how can
[1:09:44] I say a secret
[1:09:45] weapon because God had ordained him to
[1:09:48] destroy the Philistines and don't you
[1:09:50] understand that's what's happening we're
[1:09:52] going to have a Mount Zion Showdown
[1:09:56] that's it we've been ordained like
[1:09:58] Samson has been ordained and this is why
[1:10:00] I love judges because in the judges is
[1:10:03] nobody's perfect everybody that God
[1:10:07] uses have
[1:10:09] false
[1:10:11] Hallelujah messed
[1:10:13] up if we was to judge it we' say oh how
[1:10:16] can God ever use Samson look at him he's
[1:10:19] so backl ain't no good thing can come
[1:10:21] out of him but what they did not
[1:10:24] understand what they do not not
[1:10:25] understand we may may not be in full
[1:10:28] power right now Hallelujah but we have
[1:10:31] been
[1:10:32] ordained Hallelujah to shut the mouths
[1:10:35] of the the gainsayers we and young
[1:10:38] people this is what if if we could get
[1:10:40] you to see the message is 100% right yes
[1:10:43] it is if we can get you to see that you
[1:10:45] don't have to fear you don't have to
[1:10:47] doubt no matter how your problems how
[1:10:50] many you have that has nothing to do
[1:10:53] with God's choosing you and electing you
[1:10:56] oh God had a
[1:10:59] season and at Samson's darkest
[1:11:04] hour that's when God put him on display
[1:11:08] amen
[1:11:10] huh when God had put Samson in a place
[1:11:15] where Samson didn't even have eyes to
[1:11:17] see
[1:11:20] himself he didn't see a prophet he
[1:11:22] didn't see a man called from God he
[1:11:24] didn't see nothing and the only thing
[1:11:27] his blindness could get him to do was to
[1:11:30] look
[1:11:32] up Hallelujah he was blind in his
[1:11:35] natural but in his spiritual he knew he
[1:11:38] was ordained amen y'all understand what
[1:11:41] I'm saying amen he was ordained people
[1:11:44] I'm trying to tell you it it's not by
[1:11:46] power it's not by might but it's by
[1:11:50] God's spirit that we're going to conquer
[1:11:53] this enemy amen Hallelujah and Samson
[1:11:59] trials gain him victory over
[1:12:04] himself hello that's what Trials Come
[1:12:08] Trials come to make you strong that's
[1:12:12] right because God knows that every trial
[1:12:15] you go through at the end of The Journey
[1:12:18] you're going to be stronger in faith and
[1:12:21] in
[1:12:22] trust Hallelujah when you know God has
[1:12:26] brought you from a mighty long way I
[1:12:29] love the most s you don't know like I
[1:12:32] know what God has done for me amen and
[1:12:35] you can't tell it like I can tell
[1:12:38] it see it it's because that individual
[1:12:42] whoever they may be have gone through
[1:12:44] the trials some through the wat some
[1:12:46] through the flood some through God great
[1:12:48] trials but all through the blood see
[1:12:50] that is the the the the Walk of a true
[1:12:54] Christian and we're not afraid to suffer
[1:12:56] we're not afraid to go through trials
[1:12:58] We're Not Afraid this is what we come
[1:13:00] for we come to show Satan in his own
[1:13:04] Eden that God does not to give God don't
[1:13:07] have to give me a lollipop for me to
[1:13:09] serve him I'm not a child amen I'm a Man
[1:13:13] in Christ right and we can handle the
[1:13:17] things that God has given us because
[1:13:18] greater is he that is in us than he that
[1:13:21] is in the world here was Samson now
[1:13:24] going on around the same circles anybody
[1:13:26] know what I'm talking about you wonder
[1:13:29] when God going to ever deliver
[1:13:32] you you go around that same old Circle
[1:13:35] you know treading the corn treading the
[1:13:38] corn and you wish you could get free but
[1:13:40] you can't cuz you're
[1:13:42] bound God binds you to that
[1:13:45] trial he binds you to it Lord deliver me
[1:13:49] not yet keep on
[1:13:51] grinding keep on grinding not yet
[1:13:56] Hallelujah but understand God had a day
[1:14:00] a day for your Victory amen hallelujah
[1:14:04] is that right so is it now don't get
[1:14:07] discouraged with God because you keep
[1:14:09] falling and falling just get up just get
[1:14:11] up just get up keep on grinding because
[1:14:15] God has already ordained your day of
[1:14:19] Deliverance Hallelujah and during that
[1:14:22] time of Deliverance guess what you come
[1:14:24] out of is a victory you might be beat Up
[1:14:27] all In the
[1:14:29] Flesh you may not be the handsome man
[1:14:31] that you thought you was or used to be
[1:14:33] but guess what at the end of the day you
[1:14:36] know what God does he take that man who
[1:14:39] would who brought this the gospel to
[1:14:41] disgrace and hang him up in the Hall of
[1:14:43] Fame amen amen look how bad Samson was
[1:14:47] but when you think of Samson you don't
[1:14:48] think of about Delilah you don't think
[1:14:51] about all the the the the sin he did you
[1:14:53] think about Samson the strong man amen
[1:14:56] the Sams de the delil and every yeah
[1:15:00] that's what you're looking
[1:15:01] at don't get
[1:15:04] discourage God's Eye Is on the
[1:15:07] Sparrow and he watches
[1:15:09] us you know you you look at
[1:15:13] Samson this is the important part that I
[1:15:15] want to bring you because understand
[1:15:17] that unconverted seed unconverted seed
[1:15:22] carries the DNA or the germ or the
[1:15:26] gene of of of
[1:15:29] betrayal you understand me here was
[1:15:32] Samson this is why you've got to be you
[1:15:34] have to be converted this is why he gave
[1:15:38] Peter an encouragement Peter when thou
[1:15:40] art converted strengthen your brother
[1:15:43] because he knew Peter before the the
[1:15:47] crucifixion was not converted that's
[1:15:49] right and he knew Peter was going to
[1:15:52] deny him he told him you're going to not
[1:15:54] deny me you're going to betray me three
[1:15:56] times you understand me so don't ever
[1:15:59] say well I ain't going to do this that
[1:16:01] if you're not converted you still have
[1:16:03] that Gene it's passed on to you whether
[1:16:07] you like it or not is that the truth
[1:16:10] Abraham who was a true seed of God
[1:16:15] lied that was betraying the word he knew
[1:16:18] that knew better than
[1:16:19] that and it passed on to his son Isaac
[1:16:23] Isaac did the same thing Abraham did see
[1:16:27] it moves on and this is what what God is
[1:16:29] showing you that law those laws that
[1:16:32] work that there but the only thing that
[1:16:34] can kill that law is the grace of God
[1:16:38] you understand me the Holy Ghost in you
[1:16:41] you got to die you got to rot whatever
[1:16:44] it is you say well I don't know how to
[1:16:45] die I don't know how to rot he knows
[1:16:48] it's not the seed that determines the
[1:16:50] rottening of itself it's the sun it's
[1:16:53] the condition that the Sun and the
[1:16:55] weather and everything else bring upon
[1:16:57] that seed that make it die and rot and
[1:17:00] then that life come forth you got to
[1:17:03] pray that no matter how painful
[1:17:05] everybody say well I I don't you know
[1:17:07] you know I don't want patience you know
[1:17:09] I want to pray I want patience but I
[1:17:10] don't want to pray for it because
[1:17:11] tribulation bringeth patience hello
[1:17:14] that's the way God works
[1:17:17] it can't get out of it you either get it
[1:17:20] or you don't but the point is you got to
[1:17:23] realize by God's grace that god listen
[1:17:25] let me tell y'all something you may
[1:17:27] think you have problems that nobody can
[1:17:30] understand what they are because nobody
[1:17:31] goes through it like I I go through
[1:17:35] it and to you know the Bible doesn't go
[1:17:38] into detail but it does say that Jesus
[1:17:42] was tempted in every
[1:17:45] way that's right so you ain't got
[1:17:47] nothing over on
[1:17:49] Jesus he was tempted in every way but
[1:17:53] without sin
[1:17:55] he can't understand me yes he
[1:17:58] can I don't care how dark how dark your
[1:18:02] situation may be he understands that's
[1:18:05] why he came right amen he's the
[1:18:09] comforter he came to understand what you
[1:18:12] suffer in the flesh so he can comfort
[1:18:16] you he's never left us alone and he
[1:18:20] never
[1:18:22] will I feel like sh this going better
[1:18:24] than the
[1:18:25] morning but my whole point is this I'm
[1:18:28] trying to encourage you young men you
[1:18:30] don't know what you got you possess
[1:18:32] strength you possess energy you possess
[1:18:35] God you you got just what God can
[1:18:39] use you really do but you know what you
[1:18:43] got to die to
[1:18:45] yourself not my will but thine be done
[1:18:48] and you know what only that comes
[1:18:50] through
[1:18:51] prayer you know you can't collectively
[1:18:54] groupy go down on your knees and get
[1:18:56] like what you really want you got to get
[1:18:59] in your secret
[1:19:01] place well I don't feel like praying
[1:19:03] your flesh ain't going to never feel
[1:19:05] like praying cuz your flesh knows that
[1:19:08] you're praying to destroy
[1:19:11] it it's going to make you sleepy it's
[1:19:15] going to let thoughts run through your
[1:19:17] mind but you need the Holy Ghost to shut
[1:19:20] him
[1:19:21] down right Lord shut these thoughts down
[1:19:24] how y'all know what I'm talking about
[1:19:26] you can't get on get down on your knees
[1:19:28] and your phone is on forget it it's
[1:19:31] going to ring every time you get close
[1:19:33] to getting into something your phone
[1:19:35] going to ding or ring right that's what
[1:19:37] it
[1:19:38] does and from that point on your
[1:19:40] concentration is done cuz you're
[1:19:43] wondering who's calling me you can't do
[1:19:45] it you got to shut the world off every
[1:19:48] phone you can't even tell people some
[1:19:50] I'm telling you you tell somebody where
[1:19:52] you going the in before you done right
[1:19:54] in the midst of your prayer they're
[1:19:56] going to knock on your door or
[1:20:00] something it's the way the devil Works
[1:20:03] break all that all that you don't don't
[1:20:06] achieve you y'all know what it what I'm
[1:20:08] talking about do you know how difficult
[1:20:10] it is to get into that channel of prayer
[1:20:13] nowadays oh it's very
[1:20:17] difficult that's why you got to get to a
[1:20:19] place where you can't be disturbed a lot
[1:20:21] of people think you don't need it all I
[1:20:23] need to do is believe well brother
[1:20:25] Brandon preached a message desperation
[1:20:27] after he open after the opening of the
[1:20:29] seals and he says that's what we need
[1:20:32] that's right this is an hour of ever
[1:20:34] before this is a day of desperation and
[1:20:36] that's what happened to Samson but let
[1:20:38] me go on in showing that this thing also
[1:20:41] was like a type of the seals because
[1:20:43] here was Samson he's he kills a lion a
[1:20:46] roaring lion which is a type of the
[1:20:48] devil it wasn't God he killed a lion
[1:20:51] then he comes back to the lion and he
[1:20:53] finds amen that that the lion amen has a
[1:20:56] sweet a honeycomb with bees and all that
[1:21:00] and Samson looked at it and and he kind
[1:21:03] of open the seal up and he get a little
[1:21:06] bit of that
[1:21:07] honey right the bitter part was that he
[1:21:10] had to kill the enemy the sweet part was
[1:21:13] that he enjoyed the
[1:21:15] victory right and so now he had a
[1:21:18] mystery and who he tells who does he
[1:21:21] tell he tells his wife
[1:21:25] and then after that he has a what you
[1:21:27] call a bachelor party I think it was 60
[1:21:29] or 70
[1:21:31] men and in in the midst of this B this
[1:21:34] Bast party now this is denominational
[1:21:36] now messing with Samson's
[1:21:41] wife I want the mystery of
[1:21:44] it see Samson wasn't the only one that
[1:21:46] told something that he shouldn't have
[1:21:49] but there was something rolled up there
[1:21:51] that he says listen if you can give me
[1:21:53] you know the answer to this what they
[1:21:56] call those things
[1:21:58] riddles he said uh this is what going to
[1:22:01] happen I can read all of that but the
[1:22:03] point is the secret was with the
[1:22:07] wife and those men kept flirting with
[1:22:10] the lia and all that is that right until
[1:22:13] she finally told the
[1:22:17] secret and Samson when they told him the
[1:22:21] mystery of it because he knew nobody
[1:22:23] else could know what that was you see
[1:22:25] what I'm saying that is
[1:22:28] the that is the
[1:22:32] uh
[1:22:35] danger of take casting your pearls
[1:22:38] be among this the swine that's the
[1:22:41] danger of it everybody is not it's not
[1:22:44] given to everybody to know the Mysteries
[1:22:47] it's given to
[1:22:49] you you understand what I'm saying so it
[1:22:52] literally angered Sam son and what did
[1:22:56] he
[1:22:57] do 70 Church agents however you want to
[1:23:00] work it the whole point is Samson says
[1:23:03] I'm gonna get
[1:23:05] you cuz you've been flirting with my
[1:23:08] wife and y'all know that's true there's
[1:23:11] so many people in the outside of this
[1:23:14] message who knows some of this message
[1:23:17] because they've been flirting with the
[1:23:19] message that's
[1:23:21] right they preaching it out there but
[1:23:24] they're not telling them where they got
[1:23:25] it from Samson say uhuh this is Harvest
[1:23:28] Time and I'm going to show you what I'm
[1:23:30] going to do with you he got about how
[1:23:33] many foxes was it tied there seven foxes
[1:23:36] I believe seven Church agents tied their
[1:23:38] tails together and set it on fire they
[1:23:41] went through the wheat field and
[1:23:43] destroyed all of the Harvest and God
[1:23:46] says I'm going to destroy all of the
[1:23:50] Harvest y'all understand what I'm saying
[1:23:53] and he actually killed
[1:23:56] Delilah and her husband was destroyed
[1:23:59] excuse me and her daddy was destroyed by
[1:24:03] fire
[1:24:06] because Delilah's
[1:24:09] Daddy had given her to another man you
[1:24:13] say how can that be
[1:24:17] remember demon
[1:24:21] sharan who gave the Pentecost
[1:24:26] over to another
[1:24:29] man and all those
[1:24:31] Pentecostals who followed demon sh car
[1:24:34] because he was called father
[1:24:37] Pentecost and he took the United
[1:24:40] Pentecostals and all those who should
[1:24:42] have been the
[1:24:44] bride under this message of Malachi 4
[1:24:48] took it
[1:24:50] away and God says I'm going to destroy
[1:24:52] you and her
[1:24:55] because brother Bram says now demons
[1:24:57] should know better I taught
[1:25:00] demons that the Catholic
[1:25:03] church was the mark of the beast I
[1:25:06] taught him and he led all of those
[1:25:09] people right now the Assembly of God the
[1:25:12] Church of God and all these people who
[1:25:14] followed brother brand you know brother
[1:25:15] brandom filled those people churches up
[1:25:19] the Revival was because of him and God
[1:25:22] working through him he one time he
[1:25:25] called all of the upcs and everybody my
[1:25:28] children because they came to Christ
[1:25:31] through his ministry you understand me
[1:25:34] but you see what I'm saying even in
[1:25:36] those victories amen they still denied
[1:25:39] and married
[1:25:42] another God said I'm going to destroy
[1:25:45] now I'm I'm coming to my
[1:25:47] point so you can understand in all that
[1:25:50] Samson did and I ain't going to be long
[1:25:53] because of we spent the time but I want
[1:25:56] to give you a
[1:25:59] thought always
[1:26:02] believe there's a
[1:26:05] possibility never lose your
[1:26:07] possibility I don't care how bad you've
[1:26:10] Fallen I don't care how many times Satan
[1:26:13] that body slammed you however you want
[1:26:15] to say it never give up your
[1:26:18] possibility never give up your hope now
[1:26:21] this is where hope comes in you lose
[1:26:24] hope you lose everything cuz you don't
[1:26:26] have hope you can't have
[1:26:29] faith never give it up you know well I'm
[1:26:32] lost and I can't be saved never never
[1:26:36] amen never I can't be bride never don't
[1:26:40] ever give that up because it's not based
[1:26:42] on your
[1:26:44] righteousness just like in Samson's life
[1:26:46] it wasn't based as righteousness don't
[1:26:48] you know the Bible said that he was a
[1:26:50] Nazarite even unto his death w somebody
[1:26:54] help me here but what happened to all of
[1:26:56] the sin and he did in
[1:27:00] between huh God saw him as a Nazarite
[1:27:05] from the beginning to the end
[1:27:07] amen and he messed up
[1:27:10] tremendously but you know what is
[1:27:12] amazing that God never emphasizes that
[1:27:15] part he tells us how great Samson was am
[1:27:20] and that's the story this is what I want
[1:27:23] you to see you're young you may make
[1:27:26] mistakes you come up short you know the
[1:27:28] point
[1:27:30] is if the Lord has Justified
[1:27:33] you you're Justified as though you've
[1:27:35] never sin in the first place God can
[1:27:38] never take his blessings away from you
[1:27:41] you understand me I'm not trying to tell
[1:27:43] you just go out and be like
[1:27:45] Samson Solomon said listen I done tried

[1:27:58] everything and he said at the end of the
[1:28:00] day I'm going to give you the right
[1:28:02] solution fear
[1:28:04] God and keep his Commandments in other
[1:28:07] words I have been an example let my life
[1:28:10] be an example for you you'll never find
[1:28:13] peace nowhere else that's right other
[1:28:16] than in
[1:28:18] God I trust that you have eyes to see
[1:28:21] that your living is not in vain don't
[1:28:24] let your youth go to waste do something
[1:28:27] with God and for God y'all understand me
[1:28:30] I don't care if all of the old people
[1:28:31] still come to church late you come you
[1:28:34] come on time and that's what I told him
[1:28:37] I was I was a little late this morning
[1:28:39] you know what I mean and I'm thinking
[1:28:40] the church is already in
[1:28:43] session there was no angel
[1:28:46] singing
[1:28:47] nothing I come in and everybody else
[1:28:50] come in after me there was just a few
[1:28:51] people and just like I told them this
[1:28:53] morning
[1:28:54] I told him these you know I didn't say
[1:28:57] it in this manner but this what I
[1:28:59] intended to say if these congales people
[1:29:02] came in early they test testify against
[1:29:08] you there's a group came in early they
[1:29:11] were there waiting they testify against
[1:29:14] you and like I did tell them this I said
[1:29:17] you know what we punch the clock we go
[1:29:20] to work and we go there 15 minutes early
[1:29:23] hoping we get a little extra time
[1:29:25] overtime and then when we come to God we
[1:29:28] drag in and I told him I said now I'm
[1:29:30] going to show you and I'm telling y'all
[1:29:32] too you can always tell which court
[1:29:34] you're in if you're in the outer Court
[1:29:37] you're still a Christian but that means
[1:29:39] whatever change is come in your life you
[1:29:42] going to sway with it happy today sad
[1:29:44] tomorrow down up and down that's where
[1:29:47] you are you're not even Sanctified
[1:29:50] yet you understand me in the inner Court
[1:29:54] right because in the Inc Court you
[1:29:57] passed through that already but you hear
[1:29:59] in the Inc court but understand you
[1:30:00] still can have mood
[1:30:02] swings cuz if you let those lights goes
[1:30:05] out the Bible said if one of those
[1:30:07] characteristics are not in you you're
[1:30:09] blind and you don't even know you've
[1:30:10] been saved hello y'all hear what I'm
[1:30:14] saying but that's not your goal you want
[1:30:16] to get into the holies of holies amen
[1:30:18] where the eternal life is where the the
[1:30:22] union of of God and man is where God
[1:30:25] brings the light God brings the changes

[1:30:38] people of God be an individual when it

[1:30:44] but be an individual be
[1:30:46] determined to make it amen to to to to
[1:30:50] because you can see I haven't crossed a
[1:30:53] finish line yet

[1:30:56] told him many times I I've not I'll
[1:30:58] never be satisfied until I see the full
