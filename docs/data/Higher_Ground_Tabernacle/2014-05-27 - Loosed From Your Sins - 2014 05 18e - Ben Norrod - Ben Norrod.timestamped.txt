[12:12] way amen I remember many years ago and I
[12:14] say many years it's been many years for
[12:16] me I used to watch brother Brooks in the
[12:19] pull pit and I used to thank God if
[12:21] you'd ever be gracious enough to me a
[12:23] dummy to allow me to work side by side
[12:26] with that brother I would just I would
[12:28] never ask you for nothing else ever
[12:30] again and I'm going to tell you I I I
[12:32] just have to say how thankful I am to
[12:35] the Lord that God's allowed me to have a
[12:38] friendship with your pastor it means the
[12:40] world to me and I can't begin to tell
[12:43] you how honored I I love him and God
[12:46] knows I wouldn't be the man I am today
[12:47] without isaah Brooks that's the truth
[12:50] and God knows that um you know you
[12:53] probably feel the same way about the man
[12:55] you know you thank God for the vessels
[12:57] that God sends into the place and
[12:59] men that are willing amen men that are
[13:03] willing
[13:05] amen thank God for
[13:07] them I said thank God for them amen
[13:10] thank God for them amen if we don't have
[13:13] men like this in this message people
[13:14] that are willing to speak up and tell
[13:16] the truth and preach and so for like
[13:18] that brother we're going to be in a real
[13:19] big mess for this day is over with but
[13:21] thank God we've got men of God on this
[13:23] Earth today that are willing to say
[13:25] what's right amen and tell the truth
[13:28] amen you may baby SE once again if you
[13:30] can I know it gets in your legs and you
[13:32] got to stand stand that's all right too

[13:36] can put that baby down I don't know
[13:38] she's holding on awful tight and uh
[13:40] maybe have her come sing if she would
[13:42] this morning or this uh evening rather
[13:44] um I was thinking maybe try to sing a
[13:46] little bit better than what she did this
[13:47] morning I thought she was laying right
[13:49] with it this morning pretty
[13:52] good but I know there's more in there
[13:54] she just holding
[13:57] back he man appreciate you all very much
[14:00] and thank you for the opportunity to get
[14:02] to come and be with you like this and I
[14:04] I hate that it's just in and out seemed
[14:06] like and just such a quick spot of
[14:08] things but you know that's that's just
[14:10] kind of evangelism brother BR said you
[14:11] run into a city set it on fire and run
[14:13] back out so that's that's kind of the
[14:15] way of it sometimes and you don't really
[14:17] get the opportunity to really shake
[14:18] hands a whole lot even sometime but I
[14:20] was grateful to the Lord I had the
[14:22] opportunity to be able to greet some of
[14:24] y'all people here this afternoon and see
[14:26] you and so forth and and uh you know I
[14:28] love you don't youen amen I I know I was

[14:43] them he's you calling me that way well I
[14:46] I I was but I I wasn't saying it to be
[14:48] mean I was just telling the truth
[14:55] amen but when it's out of love you know
[14:57] and and uh and so well I think people
[14:59] can feel that too you know they they
[15:01] know that it's not trying to be hateful
[15:03] or mean to them and really in a way the
[15:05] only way you can describe how to get
[15:07] into the better part is you got to talk
[15:08] about this other part a little bit and
[15:10] uh folk don't like that they don't want
[15:12] you getting in their Tater Patch and all
[15:13] that kind of stuff like that but I I'm

[15:28] the kind of people people that are going
[15:29] to be babied around and you know kind of
[15:32] somebody pacify them and preach it the
[15:34] way that they like it but if we're ever
[15:36] going to get out of here you just keep
[15:37] it in your heart you're going to have to
[15:39] take some hard preaching sometimes amen
[15:42] and somebody's going to have to tell you
[15:44] the truth and you're going to have to
[15:46] receive what is truth Man without it

[23:54] title loosed from our sins

[24:04] the Baptist

[24:08] from your sins it looked like it' been a
[24:10] little bit better than that now letu
[24:12] let's try that one more time shall we
[24:14] loosed from your
[24:16] sins yeah that's much more like it
[24:19] that's it right there I understand I
[24:22] didn't emphasize it right I just said
[24:24] your sins I get it amen amen revelation
[24:28] in chapter 1 let's look at verse 4 verse
[24:31] 5 amen are you thankful to be a
[24:34] Christian I tell you the way the Lord
[24:36] moved for us this morning I'm just
[24:38] looking for a triple portion of
[24:40] that Revelation 1 verse4 and verse 5
[24:44] John to the seven churches which are in
[24:45] Asia Grace be unto you and peace from
[24:48] him which is and which was and which is
[24:51] to come and from the seven spirits which
[24:53] are before his throne and from Jesus
[24:56] Christ who is the faithful Witness
[24:58] and the first begotten of the dead and
[25:01] the prince of the kings of the earth
[25:04] unto him that loved
[25:10] us I'm looking for those that have that
[25:12] Revelation
[25:14] tonight unto him that loved
[25:17] us and washed
[25:22] us from our sins and his very own blood
[25:25] now want you to listen to this in the
[25:27] church age book page 30 34 brother man
[25:29] reads the scripture he says the word
[25:31] washed is actually loosed loosed us from
[25:37] our sins in his own blood isn't that
[25:42] wonderful praise the
[25:45] Lord yes brother brandom it
[25:49] is but are you spiritual minded did you
[25:52] catch it it was his own blood that
[25:55] loosed us completely from our sins
[25:59] it was not human
[26:02] blood no not at all it was the blood of
[26:06] God Amen Peter called it the blood of
[26:09] Christ Paul called it the blood of the
[26:11] Lord and the blood of Jesus not three
[26:14] persons but one person amen let's pray
[26:21] together Heavenly Father how we thank
[26:23] you
[26:24] Lord Lord in an atmosphere like this I
[26:27] almost hold my breath before I pray just
[26:30] scared that I'll somehow do the wrong
[26:33] thing and move that great eternal spirit
[26:37] into a a different spot we're so careful
[26:41] Lord to hold on to you while you're here
[26:44] we want to grab a hold of every fiber
[26:47] every every little substance every
[26:50] molecule that you are oh God let our
[26:53] hearts be so set of flame tonight with
[26:57] the revelation of thy presence Lord
[26:59] Jesus we'll feel you in a more special
[27:02] way than we've ever felt you before in
[27:04] our life I look down at your word today
[27:07] and I recognize that any man with a
[27:10] human ability can take the Bible open up
[27:13] the pages of the Bible and by definition
[27:15] that man or woman has opened the Bible
[27:18] but I recognize that the only true
[27:21] opener of the word is not myself not any
[27:24] other preacher any other man or woman
[27:26] but it is the author himself
[27:28] I pray today Lord take your word and
[27:31] open it up to our hearts please won't
[27:33] you won't you take this tonight sir and
[27:36] speak to our hearts in a very Reverend
[27:38] and real way God give us the joy and the
[27:41] power that accompanies the Revelation
[27:44] help us Lord to see ourselves in a much
[27:47] different way than we've ever seen us
[27:49] Lord help us to recognize your presence
[27:51] in a way we've never recognized it and
[27:54] father help us to be able to uncover
[27:56] every area that might be hindering our
[27:59] walk with God tonight May the Holy
[28:02] Spirit Expose and oh God may you take us
[28:05] into thy hands and speak to us Lord both
[28:08] speaker and hearer for I submit both to
[28:11] you on this platform for the glory of
[28:13] God and the name of Jesus Christ amen
[28:16] and amen and all the saints of God said
[28:19] amen you may be seated may the Lord
[28:21] bless you you know friends the presence
[28:23] of the Lord is such a wonderful thing
[28:25] that when a man or woman gets a hold of
[28:27] it they don't really want to let it go
[28:30] as well they shouldn't because the true
[28:33] uh spirit of God or the true power of
[28:35] God in the heart of a Believer is more
[28:38] than just the ability to shout or to
[28:40] jump or to Rejoice which we believe in
[28:42] all of that as you heard me preach this
[28:43] morning I believe those things are true
[28:46] but it is also a loosing power is a
[28:49] power that when a man or woman is bound
[28:50] up by the law of of death or the law of
[28:54] sin or the law of transgression as we've
[28:57] been uh handed down this great grab bag
[29:00] of life that's just a terrible thing
[29:01] that uh your genetics and my genetics
[29:04] isn't really much to speak of but yet in
[29:06] that Holy Spirit there is a loosing
[29:09] power that gives us authority over this
[29:11] this body here so your daddy may have
[29:14] been high tempered your grandma may have
[29:15] been impatient and all that but once a
[29:17] man or woman receives the Holy Ghost it
[29:19] gives them authority over this body here
[29:22] you believe that now we realize that
[29:24] when John is writing this book here that
[29:27] the the the very revelation of this now
[29:29] if you just allow me a moment just to
[29:31] kind of lay a foundation it may not
[29:32] sound like I'm going where I might be
[29:34] going but uh you'll see how it ties
[29:36] together in just a moment but you you
[29:38] take this book of Revelation and this
[29:40] particular book is a special book to you
[29:42] and I the reason that it is indeed a
[29:45] special book is because God if you will
[29:47] kept a padlock or we know seven padlocks
[29:50] on This Book of Revelation that it could
[29:53] not be revealed until a certain time now
[29:55] if sitting around the table in
[29:57] Fellowship you had John the Baptist and
[29:59] uh John the Revelator and you had Isaiah
[30:02] and you had Jeremiah and you had uh all
[30:04] these different prophets you had Luther
[30:06] you had Wesley and you was to go around
[30:08] the room even the Apostle Paul Simon
[30:10] Peter and you was to say uh before the
[30:13] time of this book to be revealed uh now
[30:15] now brother John uh you're the one that
[30:17] had the vision do you understand what it
[30:19] means John would have to say no I I
[30:21] don't understand brother being what it
[30:22] means I see the symbols I had the vision
[30:25] everything was laid out but I don't
[30:27] understand it now if you wants to go and
[30:28] move to Paul will say the man who had
[30:30] the message of the day and Paul being
[30:33] the one that you would think would have
[30:35] the mystery of God that was contained in
[30:37] this book and say now Paul you're God's
[30:39] Great Apostle uh the Lord you know he's
[30:41] magnified your office he's G you such an
[30:43] authority that if you yourself came back
[30:46] and tried to correct it or an angel come
[30:48] from Heaven to correct that word then of
[30:51] course that person would have to be a
[30:52] curse that's the kind of message Paul
[30:54] had now now Paul surely surely you
[30:57] understand what this Book of Revelation
[30:58] is Paul have to say brother Ben honestly
[31:01] I I don't know what it means if you was
[31:03] to move to Simon Peter and say Simon
[31:05] Peter now you've got the keys to the
[31:07] kingdom you opened up the door for the
[31:09] Jew opened up the door for the Gentile
[31:10] through water baptism remission of sin
[31:12] and so forth surely Peter you've got the
[31:15] understanding of what this book of
[31:16] Revelation means and he would have to
[31:18] say honestly brother Ben I just don't
[31:20] know what it means now it doesn't mean
[31:22] that it's not the word of God and it
[31:23] doesn't mean just because somebody
[31:25] doesn't understand it doesn't mean that
[31:27] there's important values in it but what
[31:30] it shows us is that God kept a seven
[31:32] sealed padlock on this Revelation until
[31:35] the time that it was to Break Forth now
[31:38] we realize that where they couldn't
[31:40] raise their hand and say I I I'm In This
[31:42] Crowd and I understand it and let me
[31:44] tell you what it means where they
[31:45] couldn't raise their hand you and I can
[31:47] raise our hands tonight and say I Now
[31:50] understand what they didn't understand
[31:53] now we look in This Book of Revelation
[31:54] we realize that it is the mystery of God
[31:57] of the fullness of God everything God
[31:59] was historically present in the future
[32:01] it's all wrapped up in this book of
[32:03] Revelation and we realize that every
[32:05] book has what they call an Apostolic
[32:07] salutation or a greeting and so this
[32:10] Apostolic greeting or this salutation
[32:13] was common amongst many of the disciples
[32:15] uh you'd hear Paul for example say uh
[32:17] now to the church in Ephesus uh to the
[32:19] Saints uh Paul me an apostle I greet you
[32:22] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ now
[32:24] what he was doing was not just finding
[32:26] words to to fill in pages and to make it
[32:29] sound nice or to sound pretty so it
[32:31] could be read poetically but it was
[32:33] actually putting in the mind of the
[32:34] reader that which they needed to think
[32:37] of as they read the rest of the letter
[32:39] so as Paul would go into the Ephesian
[32:40] age and he'd say I'm an apostle I
[32:42] magnify my office then the Saints could
[32:44] say oh I get it he's an apostle so he's
[32:46] not acting in the way of evangelism this
[32:49] is not an Evangelistic letter but he's
[32:51] an apostle or an order Setter so he's
[32:53] going to set forth the order of the
[32:55] church in Ephesus and coloss and Corin
[32:57] thians in these different ways so the
[32:59] apostolic greeting would tell you what
[33:02] the man had in his mind before he wrote
[33:04] the letter glory to God hallelujah see
[33:07] I'm already starting to shout because I
[33:09] know something you don't
[33:10] know now you realize when you come to
[33:13] all of these books James and Titus and
[33:15] fimon and Hebrews and all these
[33:16] different books that the Book of
[33:18] Revelation is set apart in one way from
[33:21] the rest of these books because it is
[33:23] the only book that was reserved to the
[33:25] ending of the church ages it is the only
[33:28] book The only letter that God ever wrote
[33:30] that he literally padlocked that
[33:32] Revelation to keep it from being
[33:34] revealed until the time of the end now
[33:37] you realize there's two books that the
[33:38] devil hates the most Genesis and
[33:41] Revelation and this particular book
[33:43] holds an answer to us in how we're
[33:46] supposed to live how we're supposed to
[33:48] serve God the type of ways we things we
[33:50] do to please the Lord onor on and off so
[33:52] as Jesus is going to give his Revelation
[33:55] or give his his you know his his
[33:57] unfolding what he is to John on the
[33:59] aisle of patmas he starts out with a
[34:01] greeting and he wants you to know what
[34:03] is in his mind when he goes to greet his
[34:05] children glory to God so he says now
[34:08] from he which is which was and which is
[34:11] to come Hallelujah from the very
[34:14] beginning of the very letter he wants
[34:16] you to know I am the same yesterday
[34:19] today and
[34:20] forever oh my Hallelujah notice and from
[34:24] him which is and which was and which is
[34:27] to come now notice in verse 5 this is
[34:29] where you really get the meat and
[34:30] potatoes if you will of the greeting he
[34:32] says and from Jesus Christ so this is
[34:35] not from John amen no this is not from
[34:38] John this is not John's letter to the
[34:40] elected of God this is the letter of
[34:43] Jesus Christ the revelation of Jesus
[34:46] Christ personally unto you wrote unto
[34:48] you in this letter now you'll notice
[34:50] it's from Jesus Christ and he says now
[34:52] children I want you to recognize I am a
[34:55] faithful witness oh brother there's been
[34:58] many people down through time that ain't
[34:59] been very faithful to me I've had
[35:01] friends that ain't been faithful I've
[35:02] had all kinds of deals at work it ain't
[35:04] been faithful but there's one person
[35:06] brother sister that will always be
[35:08] faithful to you and I and that is the
[35:11] Lord Jesus Christ
[35:14] himself amen you'll notice this now he
[35:16] is the first begotten would you mind
[35:18] bringing this up a little I'm going to
[35:20] be horse if I don't quit this way notice
[35:23] he is the first begotten of the Dead
[35:25] thank you now you'll notice that he
[35:27] wants to show you not only am I the
[35:30] Eternal one but I have Resurrection Life
[35:34] resurrection power and I am the first
[35:37] begotten of he which was dead and I am
[35:41] alive forever more glory to God now
[35:44] notice he is the first begotten of the
[35:46] dead he is the prince of the kings of
[35:48] the earth and it is unto him now notice
[35:52] now unto him that loved us so just in
[35:56] his hello just in his greeting he wants
[35:59] you to know I love
[36:02] you Hallelujah friends I wonder
[36:04] sometimes what people think the real
[36:06] theme of this message is you know what
[36:08] I'm saying I wonder sometimes what
[36:10] people really think the theme of this
[36:13] entire message really is the theme of
[36:15] this message is not how deep and how
[36:17] revelated you get come on somebody I'm
[36:20] not saying that it's wrong to have deep
[36:22] Revelations of God you ought to be
[36:23] studying this word day and night to know
[36:25] where you stand to know what Christ is
[36:27] the devil is you need to study to show
[36:29] yourself approved but but but
[36:31] understanding my mentally alone will
[36:33] never bring you to this oh it'll never
[36:36] bring you to that Revelation that Jesus
[36:38] Christ loved you before the foundation
[36:41] of the world or do you realize that if a
[36:44] man or woman knows that he loves them
[36:46] and you realize that God don't love
[36:48] everybody the Bible tells us in the Book
[36:50] of Romans he said Jacob have I loved
[36:53] Esau have I hated amen so if the very
[36:56] revelation of pre destination is he
[36:58] loved you you ought to be the happiest
[37:00] person amen That Ever Walked the face of
[37:03] this
[37:04] planet
[37:07] huah so he's saying unto him that loved
[37:10] us so already predestination is in
[37:13] view cuz there's some that God don't
[37:15] love amen praise the Lord amen there are
[37:18] some that God does not love at all amen
[37:21] oh you say that's nonsense for God so
[37:24] loved the world he gave his only
[37:25] begotten son don't think of it the way
[37:27] way you're thinking love moved God and
[37:30] love himself moved God for a sinful
[37:33] Humanity but God's love is only shared
[37:36] with those that are willing to
[37:38] reciprocate that love brother the devil
[37:41] won't get God's love amen inside of Hell
[37:44] won't get God's loveen come on y'all
[37:46] going to preach at me or stare at me
[37:48] come on these out here ain't going to
[37:49] get God's love but you and I can get a
[37:51] dose and a double portion of God's
[37:54] eternal love for you and
[37:56] I
[37:57] amen let me say it in street terms God
[38:00] ain't no
[38:01] dummy huh he knows who loves him and who
[38:04] don't love him he knows who's going to
[38:06] give back to him and who ain't going to
[38:07] give he know the end from the beginning
[38:09] he knows who's going to love him and who
[38:10] ain't going to love him I want to love
[38:12] him with all of my heart praise the Lord
[38:15] now notice unto him that loved us and
[38:20] and that is always a conjunction so if
[38:24] he loved you there's a second part that
[38:26] comes with that love amen he looses you
[38:30] from your sins in his very own blood
[38:33] amen
[38:35] Oh Glory to God glory to God so those
[38:39] who God's love who God loves those are
[38:41] the ones that will be recipients of
[38:43] God's loosing power
[38:45] amen how on Earth some of you all are
[38:47] sitting still right now I can't even
[38:49] figure it out oh my than of this now so
[38:52] the word that he uses for wash is
[38:55] actually loose so while I'm being washed
[38:57] I'm being loosed amen when I'm being
[38:58] loosed I'm being washed that works out
[39:00] pretty good don't it that's the reason
[39:02] you come to the house of God so the word
[39:04] can begin to communicate to your heart
[39:07] that you need to be washed look brother
[39:10] when you come to the house of God you
[39:11] don't come clean you don't come
[39:13] everything just so so but the Holy
[39:15] Spirit takes his word and he must wash
[39:18] you over and over and over again to br
[39:21] oh Hallelujah to show forth what the
[39:24] loosing power of Jesus Christ amen you
[39:27] just didn't get loose the day you got
[39:29] saved but every time you come to church
[39:31] you're being washed loosed loosed washed
[39:34] loosed wash loose over and over again
[39:37] he's loosing even tonight he's taking
[39:40] the chains off some of
[39:43] us praise the Lord now notice now it was
[39:47] his own blood St John chapter 6 verse 54
[39:51] now we we touched on this just a little
[39:52] bit this morning but I want to go a
[39:53] little bit deeper in this St John
[39:55] chapter 6 verse 54 now notice Jesus says
[39:59] who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[40:03] blood hath eternal life and I will raise
[40:07] him up at the last day now I want you to
[40:10] notice here that Jesus himself is the
[40:13] word you just have to take my word for
[40:16] it I ain't got enough time to work it up
[40:17] and prove it to you you just going have
[40:18] to believe it so Jesus being the word
[40:21] him who being the Eternal one became
[40:24] flesh so the word in the beginning was
[40:26] the word the word was was with God the
[40:27] Word was God and the word became flesh
[40:29] so Jesus is not telling them I want you
[40:32] to know on my arm I want you to eat my
[40:34] finger off and eat my eyeball and and
[40:36] eat my foot and cannibalize my body
[40:38] after I'm gone and drink of my blood but
[40:40] he's saying I want you to partake of the
[40:44] revelation of who I
[40:46] am oh think of it so in the very opening
[40:50] of John's letter he is showing them what
[40:52] he told him in St John 6 this is the
[40:54] revelation of My Flesh and my
[40:58] blood let me ask you a question when you
[41:01] would take Adam and Eve and stand them
[41:03] side by side if Eve came from Adam's
[41:06] Body and she had his bones and she had
[41:09] his flesh tell me whose blood she
[41:16] had praise the
[41:18] Lord if you done a DNA test on Eve it
[41:22] would have showed up Adam Adam Adam Adam
[41:25] amen praise the Lord
[41:28] Lord so you take this bride Who is the
[41:31] very is
[41:34] partaking whose blood does she have
[41:37] Hallelujah whose blood does she have she
[41:39] don't have the blood of a Jew she don't
[41:41] have the blood of a gentile no she has
[41:44] the blood of her husband the second man
[41:50] Adam so Jesus says who so eats my flesh
[41:54] and drinks my blood so if the revelation
[41:56] of who he is is is what we're supposed
[41:58] to partake of if Adam and Eve had the
[42:01] same blood so when I eat his flesh and
[42:03] drink his blood I get the same
[42:04] Revelation about me that I get about him
[42:08] if he is eternal I am
[42:12] Eternal come on somebody now notice
[42:15] Jesus doesn't stop there no no he says
[42:17] and I will raise him up the very same
[42:22] words that he says in the Book of
[42:23] Revelation I am the first begotten of
[42:26] the
[42:28] don't you understand what that means it
[42:29] means when you partake of the revelation
[42:32] of Jesus Christ and he loves you he
[42:35] reveals himself to you he looses you
[42:37] from your sins not only does he give you
[42:40] the power to be free from sin but that
[42:42] very same revelation will also resurrect
[42:46] this body amen your flesh your cells
[42:49] will be rearranged all together
[42:53] am oh my now you know that we're
[42:58] forgiven we're also
[43:00] Justified but we're not just
[43:05] saved there is a difference in being
[43:08] saved and being redeemed yeah
[43:14] Hallelujah yeah glory to
[43:16] God Buckle in your Baptist seat belt I'm
[43:19] about to blow you
[43:21] out now if I was to walk out on this
[43:23] street out here out in the church
[43:25] parking lot will say and I find a cell
[43:26] phone and I take that cell phone I stick
[43:29] it in my pocket bring it back give one
[43:30] of the brothers I have saved that cell
[43:32] phone amen saved it from getting stepped
[43:34] on Sav it from getting run over I've
[43:36] saved it save that cell phone but if
[43:39] that cell phone was mine I didn't save
[43:42] it I redeemed
[43:45] it hallu you say why because it was mine
[43:50] in the first place Hallelujah Glory
[43:54] Hallelujah now there are those on this
[43:57] Earth that are going to be saved people
[43:59] at the end there'll be those that live
[44:01] outside the city the foolish virgin they
[44:03] will be saved but there is a difference
[44:06] between saved and Born Again Hallelujah
[44:10] I am not just saved but I am
[44:15] redeemed Redeemed by the blood and the
[44:18] grace of Almighty
[44:22] godall Oh Glory to God now notice save
[44:26] people
[44:28] they have a lot to worry about when they
[44:29] come up before the Throne of God because
[44:32] if one thing is laying in there that
[44:34] ain't right with God he'll see it now
[44:37] turn me now to Hebrews chapter
[44:39] 4:12 now let's let's just take a few
[44:41] scriptures tonight let's just look at
[44:43] how the bride stands before him now you
[44:46] realize all of us have the opportunity
[44:48] to stand before Christ's throne in
[44:50] prayer and so forth like that but now
[44:51] notice now Hebrews
[44:55] 4:12 for the word of God God is
[44:58] quick didn't say
[45:03] slow that's way some people are in
[45:06] church takes them 45 minutes to finally
[45:09] get their hand up in
[45:11] there but the word of God ain't slow
[45:14] it's
[45:16] quick hey that's why I preach so fast
[45:18] brother Isaiah it's that word in me
[45:20] making me go that fast the word of God
[45:23] is quick
[45:25] and it's not weak is
[45:27] so the word should never be delivered in
[45:29] a weak way should always come forth
[45:31] powerful any word of God is powerful
[45:35] amen notice and sharper than any
[45:37] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[45:40] dividing of su of Soul and Spirit and of
[45:42] the joints and Marrow and is a discerner
[45:45] of the thoughts and the intents of the
[45:48] heart now notice not only is your
[45:51] thoughts discernable but your intention
[45:53] is discernable too amen do you realize
[45:56] friends a lot of times when preachers go
[45:58] to preaching on things there may not be
[46:00] one person guilty of the actual act or
[46:02] whatever it may be that the that the the
[46:04] man's preaching about but do you realize
[46:06] that the Holy Ghost can see your
[46:08] intention of what you want to do do you
[46:10] realize that many of our sermons in this
[46:12] message are preach more from the Avenue
[46:14] of intention rather than action there
[46:17] are people that is sitting their heart
[46:19] and intend to backslide and intend to
[46:21] quit God and intend to be bitter and
[46:23] angry against this one that one so the
[46:25] man of God by the anoint of the the holy
[46:27] spirit will go right down that Avenue of
[46:29] intention and unearth those intentions
[46:32] and then people sit there and get mad as
[46:34] a devil and blow up like a bullfrog
[46:35] eating buck shot you know why you
[46:37] revealed their intention what they
[46:39] intend to do you remember the prophet of
[46:41] God when when he was standing there
[46:42] having that vision of standing in the
[46:43] trash heat remember the Holy Ghost gives
[46:46] brother bandam a vision of something
[46:48] that will never happen in his lifetime
[46:51] here he is standing there he's a bum
[46:52] he's out there in this trash Heap and he
[46:54] stands there and somebody says to him
[46:56] now brother bradam he said think of it
[46:58] at one time I was the leader of the
[47:00] Bride of Jesus Christ now why did the
[47:03] Holy Ghost show him that because brother
[47:05] Bam's intention was leave the field so
[47:08] God was not revealing his action he was
[47:10] revealing his intention that's
[47:13] good praise the Lord I tell you I
[47:16] guarantee one thing the parts of the
[47:18] service that I get more in trouble for
[47:20] than anything else is when I go to
[47:21] preaching on folks
[47:24] intention praise the Lord somebody amen
[47:26] when I go to preaching on what they
[47:28] intend to do and they'll say somebody
[47:30] told him that somebody revealed no no
[47:32] the Holy Spirit knows the intent of our
[47:37] heart now notice this verse 13 neither
[47:40] is there any creature that is not
[47:42] manifest in his sight but all
[47:46] things all
[47:48] things are naked and open in the eyes of
[47:53] him with whom we have to do now you'll
[47:55] find these same two words naked and open
[47:58] in Genesis 3:7 and the eyes of them both
[48:01] were opened and they knew that they were
[48:04] naked so God is looking down upon you
[48:07] and I and there's not one thought
[48:10] there's not one intention that you and I
[48:13] can hide from
[48:14] [Music]
[48:15] him now listen carefully because if you
[48:17] miss this next part you're going to miss
[48:19] the whole theme of what I'm hitting at
[48:21] but if you don't know then as you stand
[48:23] before the Lord that everything you are
[48:26] I don't mean partially I don't mean a
[48:27] third of the way everything you are is
[48:30] standing open in the eyes of God amen
[48:35] amen now okay how are you going to stand
[48:39] before his presence and walk up boldly
[48:41] as Paul will tell you in a few minutes
[48:43] boldly before the throne of grace and
[48:45] say Jesus I'm here to ask for this and
[48:48] Jesus I'm standing here to ask for that
[48:51] how you going to do it if you approach
[48:53] his throne in the way of I'm a sinner
[48:56] God sees me as a sinner I'm just saved
[48:59] I'm just forgiven I I just got little
[49:01] things on my life you know that ain't
[49:03] right and oh God I just don't want you
[49:05] to kill me and have mercy no wonder
[49:07] people approach him in that way because
[49:09] they know that their sins in their lives
[49:12] are naked their conscience tells them
[49:14] with Isaiah they know that they're naked
[49:16] and open in the eyes of him with whom
[49:18] they have to do or him they have to
[49:20] reckon so rather than stand there boldly
[49:22] they stand there like a sinner wonder
[49:25] what makes the difference well I'm glad
[49:27] you asked me I'm going to tell you
[49:28] tonight amen notice here in in moffit's
[49:31] Translation this just a different
[49:33] translation for the logos of God is a
[49:36] living thing
[49:40] amen active and more cutting than any
[49:44] sword with double edge yeah penetrating
[49:47] to the very division of Soul and Spirit
[49:50] joints and Marrow scrutinizing the very
[49:53] thoughts and conceptions of the heart
[49:57] amen and no created thing is hidden from
[49:59] him all things lie open and
[50:03] exposed before the eyes of him with whom
[50:06] we have to
[50:08] reckon now how you supposed to stand
[50:10] boldly when you stand like that how how
[50:14] are you supposed to stand there boldly
[50:16] and say God I want my kids I want my joy
[50:19] I want my peace if everything's naked
[50:21] and open yeah boy you're going to be in
[50:23] a mess standing there cuz you won't be
[50:25] able to hide one thing amen
[50:27] unless of course there's a remedy where
[50:29] God can't see it yes sir Hallelujah
[50:35] Glory praise the Lord amen hallelujah I
[50:39] let the kitty out of the bag a little
[50:40] bit too early but it was good anyhow
[50:43] notice this I had to say something y'all
[50:45] was about to pass out on me notice this
[50:47] in Way's translation I like a shadow
[50:49] when I read this listen this translation
[50:51] to Hebrews 4:12 for God's message is
[50:55] full of life and Power
[50:57] [Applause]
[50:59] power I said that's the way the message
[51:01] ought to
[51:02] read this message God's message is not
[51:04] given to us to make us intellectual no
[51:07] it's given because it's full of life and
[51:11] power amen it is Keener than the
[51:14] sharpest two-edged sword it pierces even
[51:17] to the severance of soul from Spirit and
[51:19] penetrates between the joints and the
[51:21] marrow and can discern the secret
[51:24] thoughts and purposes of the
[51:27] heart and no created thing is able to
[51:30] escape its
[51:31] scrutiny but everything lies bare and
[51:34] completely exposed before the eyes of
[51:38] him with whom we have to do Young's
[51:41] literal translation said that all things
[51:43] are naked and open to his
[51:45] eyes so tell me then how are you going
[51:48] to stand there and stand before his
[51:51] presence if you're just
[51:54] saved cuz just being saved means you're
[51:56] just
[51:57] forgiven but it doesn't mean the thing
[52:00] that caused you to sin the first place
[52:01] has been eradicated the little snake
[52:03] still lays inside the heart of a saved
[52:05] person so there's no way that you or I
[52:08] could stand before him and ask boldly
[52:10] ask boldly there's no way brother said
[52:13] we could ask boldly if inside our heart
[52:15] we're just
[52:18] saved
[52:20] amen can I tell it yet I'm about to blow
[52:24] up little bit further okay I'll hold him
[52:26] off in just don't let them blow up
[52:29] notice page 34 man said now would you
[52:31] like an Old Testament type of redemption
[52:33] let us go back to the Garden of Eden he
[52:36] said when the news first came from Glory
[52:38] that his son Adam had been lost did God
[52:41] send an angel you answer me did God send
[52:44] a son did God send another one likened
[52:48] unto us no but he came himself amen let
[52:54] me tell you Jesus's blood was not a not
[52:56] a mixture of Joseph and the holy ghost
[52:59] or or the Holy Ghost and Mary or Mary
[53:02] and the third of the Holy Ghost and 10th
[53:04] of Jose no it was all God God was his
[53:07] mother God was his father every cell in
[53:10] his body was created by the Lamb of God
[53:13] Amen to be the Lamb of God and created
[53:16] by the hand of his father the Lord
[53:18] amen so what blood is it that saved us
[53:23] is it the chemistry of the blood is it
[53:25] just a charge if I had a charger full of
[53:27] his blood up here could that save you no
[53:31] but faith in the revelation of what it
[53:34] really is that'll bring about redemption
[53:37] in the life of a child of
[53:40] God oh oh listen at this he said no he
[53:44] came himself to redeem redeem redeem
[53:48] that lost son he said
[53:52] Hallelujah God did not entrust his Plan
[53:54] of Salvation to another he trusted only
[53:59] himself notice God was made flesh the
[54:03] Eternal God indwelt a mortal body in
[54:06] order to take away sin he became the
[54:09] Lamb of God in order to shed his blood
[54:12] and enter into the veil with it Paul
[54:16] says let us therefore come
[54:22] boldly
[54:23] [Music]
[54:25] Hallelujah so how am I going to stand
[54:27] there boldly if I'm just a
[54:28] sinner saved by
[54:31] grace if I'm just a sinner we say that
[54:33] all the time I'm just an old sinner been
[54:37] saved by grace don't you lay that tag
[54:38] off on me that's right I am no longer a
[54:41] [Applause]
[54:43] sinner once the blood of Christ has
[54:46] loosed me amen I am no longer a sinner
[54:49] in his eyes but I am
[54:53] redeemed hallelujah oh do you realize
[54:55] that's why the message justification
[54:57] means so much to you and I we are not
[55:00] just saved we are not just forgiven but
[55:03] we are Justified amen what does it mean
[55:07] to be
[55:08] justified it means that you are forgiven
[55:11] as though it never took place in the
[55:13] beginning
[55:17] am listen this page 34 brother says
[55:20] consider this since it is the blood of
[55:22] God it is perfect
[55:25] blood amen you don't have it I don't
[55:29] have it I am not perfect I do not have
[55:32] perfect blood and neither do you but
[55:35] God's blood in Jesus was perfect amen
[55:39] perfect perfect there was not an ounce
[55:41] of sin there was not an ounce of
[55:44] degeneration there was not an ounce of
[55:46] that even the Bible said he made himself
[55:49] subject to the law of sin and
[55:53] death do you realize there was enough
[55:55] power the Lord Jesus that if he didn't
[55:57] want to die he could have made death
[56:00] hold off for a thousand years if you
[56:05] amen oh my praise the Lord I know y'all
[56:09] are worried about how horse my voice is
[56:11] but I can preach seven more services
[56:12] just sign like this don't worry about it
[56:15] I'll be all right you wor I want you to
[56:17] worry about this word don't worry about
[56:18] me now notice this now he said the power
[56:21] then of the loosing he said if it is the
[56:24] perfect blood if the perfect blood is lo
[56:26] loosing us from the power of bondage and
[56:28] the defilement of sin he said then the
[56:30] loosing is also perfect and
[56:36] complete oh my god do you understand
[56:40] that once he set you free once he takes
[56:43] the chains off of you you are free
[56:47] indeed it's a perfect loosing Hallelujah
[56:50] God don't halfway loose his children no
[56:53] sir he don't a third of the way loose
[56:55] his children you you are all the way
[56:59] loose how in the world could he stand
[57:01] there and Shake you before the devil if
[57:03] you're not perfectly free but you have
[57:06] perfect Freedom amen you've got perfect
[57:10] loosing by the grace of almighty

[57:17] hallelujah oh my listen there is there
[57:21] now no condemnation it to them which are
[57:24] in Christ Jesus Romans 83334 there it is
[57:27] his death gave us the blood he said it
[57:30] is God that justifieth who shall lay
[57:34] anything to the charge of God's elect
[57:39] amen Oh Glory to God thank you Jesus he
[57:43] said it is God that justifies who is he
[57:46] that condemneth it's Christ that
[57:50] died brother sister I'm convinced that
[57:53] if the devil would have known what that
[57:54] blood would have done for you and I he
[57:56] would have had a so a stitch and SE
[57:58] party at Calvary to keep that blood from
[57:59] coming out he would have done everything
[58:02] that he possibly could to keep that
[58:04] blood from falling on the ground and
[58:06] from loosing you and
[58:08] I oh my there it is the death gave us
[58:12] his blood the blood has loosed us
[58:16] amen there is therefore no
[58:19] condemnation amen because the blood has
[58:22] loosed us brother B says we are free
[58:25] amen we are Guiltless yes amen thank you
[58:30] Lord praise your name amen okay Glory so

[59:13] comes to pray so what are you going to
[59:15] do about it Jesus nothing I'm going to
[59:17] wait till he finishes and when he gets
[59:19] done maybe the revelation will strike
[59:21] him one day that all that trash he's
[59:23] talking I don't even see it
[59:26] amen amen praise the Lord I'm not giving
[59:30] you a license to go do what you want to
[59:31] do no if you got that in your heart

[59:35] place but a real child of God full of
[59:37] the Holy Ghost when they step boldly do
[59:40] you realize the reason we step boldly
[59:41] Before the Throne of God is because God
[59:44] don't have one not one
[59:47] record not
[59:50] one amen hallelujah let's look at him K
[59:54] he goes up into that throne room of God
[59:57] and starts praying Lord Jesus I I tell
[1:00:01] you God I don't know why in the world

[1:00:21] their sins with me if you'd like to read
[1:00:23] from my book I'd like to tell you about
[1:00:26] all they've ever done and how they've
[1:00:28] done it after the devil gets done
[1:00:30] running his long tongue and J jaming his
[1:00:32] yammering his Jaws on for about 30
[1:00:34] minutes the Holy Ghost just stops and
[1:00:36] says um excuse me I I like you know the
[1:00:40] fact that you think your book means
[1:00:41] something but my book supersede your
[1:00:44] booken so if you excuse me just a moment
[1:00:47] I need to make a search of my own glory
[1:00:51] to God so God calls out Angel 437 go get
[1:00:56] the book of Isaiah Brooks so the angel
[1:00:59] goes and gets the book out of God's
[1:01:01] compendium a predestinated
[1:01:04] seed amen remember the prophet of God
[1:01:07] said God put your picture in a file
[1:01:10] cabinet before the foundation of the
[1:01:13] world Amen in a roll ofex of
[1:01:16] predestination my name was already wrote
[1:01:19] down in his
[1:01:20] book amen before I had a chance to S
[1:01:24] before I ever done anything anything
[1:01:26] wrong my name was already on his
[1:01:34] book so the angel comes to the book and
[1:01:37] says here you go God here you go thank
[1:01:41] you Satan let's challenge your book with
[1:01:45] my book Hallelujah you see your book
[1:01:48] only has a record of from the time they
[1:01:49] took the Breath of Life till now but my
[1:01:52] book goes a little farther than that
[1:01:57] Hallelujah I'm going to go back before
[1:01:59] they sucked
[1:02:03] wind God opens up the book and he says H
[1:02:07] what'd you find God what'd you find
[1:02:09] nothing it's all covered in
[1:02:11] [Applause]
[1:02:14] [Music]
[1:02:18] blood everywhere I
[1:02:20] look if they had any sin I can't see
[1:02:24] it if they had downfalls I don't know it
[1:02:28] my book says they're completely and
[1:02:31] perfectly Loose by this Blood that's on
[1:02:35] this book oh do you realize children the
[1:02:37] prophet of God said that when your name
[1:02:39] went on the Lamb's Book of Life he said
[1:02:41] the name of the Lord Jesus went on there
[1:02:43] the same night and he said Jesus himself
[1:02:46] he said wrote your name and his name on
[1:02:49] the book with his very own
[1:02:51] blood you say where did he get blood
[1:02:54] John tells us John tells us for he was
[1:02:57] the lamb slain from the foundation of
[1:03:00] the
[1:03:02] world so in the mind of God there was
[1:03:05] already a sacrifice before you sucked
[1:03:09] Wind come on
[1:03:11] somebody come on somebody before you
[1:03:15] ever took the breath of life before you
[1:03:17] ever done a wrong before you ever done
[1:03:20] any sining at all your name was already
[1:03:22] bleached in the Clorox of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:27] Amen brother B says we are free we are
[1:03:31] Guiltless
[1:03:39] amen don't listen to
[1:03:42] man
[1:03:43] amen amen I wonder why brother bam would
[1:03:46] take time to say that wonder why he'
[1:03:49] tell us we Guiltless and then remind us
[1:03:51] not to listen to man because sometimes
[1:03:54] man man
[1:03:56] man come on now man does a lot of
[1:03:59] talking and that man always reminds you
[1:04:02] of everything you've ever done but God
[1:04:05] ain't looking at the
[1:04:08] man amen he's looking at the
[1:04:11] blood he's looking at the name he's
[1:04:14] looking at your
[1:04:18] representation this is why the prophet
[1:04:20] said when you pray your voice goes up
[1:04:23] and mingles with the Lamb of God
[1:04:26] and when he said he turns to hear you
[1:04:28] pray he said he doesn't see you he sees
[1:04:32] Jesus
[1:04:33] speaking the blood speaks on your behalf
[1:04:36] the blood speaks for you no wonder the
[1:04:38] bride can be the living Voice come on
[1:04:40] somebody no wonder the bride can be the
[1:04:43] living voice because it's not her
[1:04:45] speaking it's the voice of the
[1:04:53] Bride Oh Glory to God don't listen to
[1:04:56] man listen to the word you are loosed by
[1:05:00] the blood Colossians chapter 1 ver2
[1:05:04] Colossians chapter 1
[1:05:06] verse2 notice what what Paul says
[1:05:10] here giving thanks unto the
[1:05:13] father wow so I guess Paul believed in
[1:05:16] worshiping God in church too
[1:05:20] amen amen where in the world some of
[1:05:23] these dry hides get that idea I'm
[1:05:24] worshiping God in spirit and Truth
[1:05:26] well many of the letters that Paul
[1:05:28] writes he starts out by
[1:05:31] shouting praise the Lord blessed be the
[1:05:34] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:36] do you think Paul was sitting there in
[1:05:37] that jail C going Blessed
[1:05:40] Be I kind of have a feeling that him and
[1:05:42] Silas if they would have sang the
[1:05:43] Baptist version they wouldn't have got
[1:05:45] to that jail cell but see they were
[1:05:48] Pentecostal folk original
[1:05:50] Pentecost so I imagine Paul might have
[1:05:52] had to take many of his letters and go
[1:05:55] mess that one up again and throw it
[1:05:56] behind him you know why cuz when he
[1:05:58] started saying blessed he got about b l
[1:06:00] e glory to God hallelujah praise the
[1:06:03] Lord praise the
[1:06:06] Lord oh man I messed it up
[1:06:12] again
[1:06:14] amen why because when he got to thinking
[1:06:16] about what Jesus done for a blind man
[1:06:20] Hallelujah he couldn't hardly help but
[1:06:22] just get excited about what he was
[1:06:24] hearing
[1:06:29] people think that Paul is sitting there
[1:06:30] with his glasses on the end of his nose
[1:06:32] and he's writing scholarly you know you
[1:06:35] know a big Fountain pin calligraphy type
[1:06:37] style like that I imagine Paul would
[1:06:39] write a while set it down and Shout a
[1:06:42] while go back and ride a while sit down
[1:06:45] and Shout a
[1:06:47] while could you imagine the very
[1:06:49] Revelation that you and I enjoy breaking
[1:06:51] to this man fresh fresh fresh I don't
[1:06:54] mean that's secondhand or 30 or 40 times
[1:06:56] after a sermon but could you imagine
[1:06:59] this breaking fresh and him sitting in
[1:07:01] that jail cell going uh now what was
[1:07:03] that God was that a them a they and us
[1:07:06] uh who uh how what is it a pronoun an
[1:07:09] adverb or what is it I imagine by the
[1:07:11] time Paul got done getting caught up in
[1:07:13] the spirit after the Holy Ghost is
[1:07:15] breaking in Revelations he probably had
[1:07:17] to go back and check the language make
[1:07:18] sure he didn't change the
[1:07:20] language oh
[1:07:22] Hallelujah glory to God glory to God
[1:07:25] glory to God cuz as he got to WR he
[1:07:28] might have changed ad
[1:07:31] verbs oh glory amen
[1:07:36] amen the Revelation breaking this man
[1:07:39] listen which hath made
[1:07:41] us meet to be
[1:07:45] partakers with the
[1:07:47] inheritance of the Saints and light I
[1:07:50] want you to listen to me I am not a
[1:07:52] prodical son
[1:07:56] I am not a subordinate in God's kingdom
[1:07:59] I am not a subject in God's kingdom the
[1:08:02] baker is a subordinate the butler is a
[1:08:06] subject every little uh uh gopher as we
[1:08:10] call them here in the world every goer
[1:08:12] in the Kingdom there
[1:08:13] subordinates but I am not a goer amen
[1:08:18] amen but I am
[1:08:21] co-equal with the King
[1:08:23] [Music]
[1:08:25] I am a joint joint
[1:08:31] [Music]
[1:08:36] air but see why we don't like that
[1:08:38] sometimes is because we've got Pig pin
[1:08:40] mentality yeah we're like the prodical
[1:08:42] son we feel like the only way God loves
[1:08:44] us is if we got to get out in a big mess
[1:08:45] and do all this in the world and live
[1:08:47] like a bunch of devils and then come
[1:08:48] scraping back to God we feel that's the
[1:08:51] only way he's ever going to love us the
[1:08:52] only way he's going to have mercy on us
[1:08:53] is if somehow he takes p on us scum of
[1:08:56] the
[1:08:58] earth could you imagine a queen sitting
[1:09:00] up here in the castle and somebody
[1:09:02] walking up and saying I want a cake by
[1:09:05] midnight I imagine that king would speak
[1:09:07] up and say we have subjects for such
[1:09:10] work you don't speak to the queen in
[1:09:13] such a manner amen don't you understand
[1:09:16] why Jesus our daddy our King our our
[1:09:18] headship our husband don't you
[1:09:20] understand why he gets so mad when the
[1:09:22] devil talks to you the way he does amen
[1:09:24] amen do you think the devil is yammering
[1:09:27] on and Jesus ain't taking exception to
[1:09:29] it he's writing a book down of
[1:09:31] everything that long tongue says every
[1:09:34] word every accusation every Temptation
[1:09:37] everything he's ever said to you and
[1:09:39] don't kid yourself Jesus Takes exception
[1:09:41] to the devil talking to his Queen the
[1:09:43] way he does am oh
[1:09:46] Hallelujah Lord he'll let him Yammer on
[1:09:49] Yammer on Yammer on for so long and then
[1:09:52] after a while the Bible said that during
[1:09:54] the why years of the millennial Reign
[1:09:57] the Bible said God puts him in a pit and
[1:09:59] shuts him
[1:10:02] up Oh Glory let me tell you let him talk
[1:10:06] on but one day Jesus will shut him
[1:10:10] up

[1:13:31] right we approach him like oh God I am
[1:13:35] the worm I am the scum I am the good for
[1:13:39] nothing oh holy Ancient of Days don't
[1:13:42] destroy me could you imagine how Jesus
[1:13:45] sometimes listens to us pray and punches
[1:13:47] the Angels next to him and says when are
[1:13:50] they going to get
[1:13:51] it did they not realize my whole program
[1:13:55] is vested in them if I thought they were

[1:14:19] and is to come
[1:14:22] Shalom the revelation of Jesus
[1:14:27] Christ do you understand friends we're
[1:14:29] not subordinates we don't go to his
[1:14:31] presence and bow and scrape and seek to
[1:14:34] find favor with God we don't have to do
[1:14:37] that if God has ever filled you with the
[1:14:39] Holy Ghost you already have his favor
[1:14:42] amen all right I'm G to say something
[1:14:44] you might get mad at me but I'm going to
[1:14:45] say it anyways you know why we do a lot
[1:14:47] of that nonsense because we're trying to
[1:14:48] please our dead daddy or grandma or mama
[1:14:52] or somebody in our life or some husband
[1:14:54] or some wife wife or something like that
[1:14:56] and our subconscious is storing that
[1:14:58] scar down inside of our heart so we
[1:15:00] approach God the way we'd approach our
[1:15:03] daddy that never loved us
[1:15:07] right well praise the Lord the word amen
[1:15:11] in case you
[1:15:12] forgot say it I'm going to say it again
[1:15:16] say it again ain't going to hurt you say
[1:15:17] it
[1:15:20] again oh Jesus Lord I know that I've
[1:15:23] never made you proud your daddy or
[1:15:26] Jesus which one we talking about huh
[1:15:30] mama or Jesus which one are you trying
[1:15:32] to impress
[1:15:34] anyhow cuz when I read the Bible it says
[1:15:36] we've already found favor with him huh
[1:15:39] he loved us before we came while we were
[1:15:41] yet
[1:15:43] sinners praise the Lord while we were
[1:15:46] yet in sin and iniquity and
[1:15:48] transgression but Isaiah he already
[1:15:51] loved us
[1:15:55] so why do we scrape and Claw trying to
[1:15:58] find favor with a god we've already
[1:16:00] found favor with you know why cu the
[1:16:04] Revelation ain't struck you yet that
[1:16:06] Jesus ain't your daddy and Jesus ain't
[1:16:09] your grandpa and Jesus ain't your mama
[1:16:11] and Jesus ain't Obama and Jesus ain't
[1:16:14] llama and Jesus ain't other
[1:16:16] arm it is the holy ghost that found
[1:16:19] favor with you and you have found favor
[1:16:22] amen with almighty God you don't have to
[1:16:24] seek for it's already
[1:16:28] here thank you Lord oh but brother Ben
[1:16:30] if I don't come humbly and I humble is
[1:16:33] one thing showing him respect that's one
[1:16:36] thing but quit thinking of yourself as a
[1:16:39] servant quit approaching Jesus as though
[1:16:42] you have to approach him in
[1:16:44] servitude oh God I I'll give to you my
[1:16:46] life if you'll making a deal with God
[1:16:49] are we a little trade so you be a good
[1:16:52] boy and Jesus give you the good stuff
[1:16:54] huh when you're a bad boy he doesn't
[1:16:56] give you the good stuff you're bad so
[1:16:57] he's got to huh come on now that's our
[1:17:01] mentality of the Lord Jesus and you
[1:17:03] wonder why people aren't calling on him
[1:17:05] for boldness amen
[1:17:08] amen well praise the lord we sure had a
[1:17:12] good service this morning I'll tell you
[1:17:14] just this morning was wonderful this
[1:17:17] morning was just such a good
[1:17:22] service amen preach it brother Ben I
[1:17:26] think I will in spite of how quiet they
[1:17:30] get notice this Ephesians chapter 1
[1:17:33] verse
[1:17:34] 7 now notice the Apostle Paul takes this
[1:17:36] same word and uses it again now watch in
[1:17:39] whom we
[1:17:42] have
[1:17:45] Redemption through his
[1:17:47] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[1:17:50] to the riches of his grace so I don't
[1:17:52] just have God's pardoning Grace of my
[1:17:55] life to be saved but I have Redemption
[1:17:59] through his blood so the purpose of the
[1:18:01] blood was it spoke of redemption do you
[1:18:05] understand when Cain stood there and had
[1:18:06] no blood he was testifying he had no
[1:18:10] Redemption do you realize his very
[1:18:13] offering testified that he had no
[1:18:15] Redemptive value in the eyes of God Amen
[1:18:18] but when Abel slay that lamb and the
[1:18:20] blood went spilling down he was
[1:18:23] testifying I I have redeeming value in
[1:18:26] the eyes of God
[1:18:28] Amen I have redeeming value oh don't you
[1:18:31] know when Jesus shed his blood for you
[1:18:34] and I that's exactly what the Son of God
[1:18:36] was saying about you and I that we had
[1:18:39] redeeming
[1:18:43] value
[1:18:48] amen
[1:18:50] oh let me go a bit further and I'll try
[1:18:52] to close try try to close Hebrews
[1:18:57] chapter
[1:18:58] 9:12 neither by the blood of goats and
[1:19:01] Cales but by his own
[1:19:04] blood he entered in once into the holy
[1:19:13] place I'm gonna let this come up before
[1:19:15] I read any further I want you to see it
[1:19:16] for yourself before I read
[1:19:19] it look at the next
[1:19:23] part having obtained
[1:19:27] Eternal
[1:19:28] Redemption for
[1:19:30] us there are no takebackspace
[1:19:54] and there can be no more Mercy for them
[1:19:57] I believe there's a spot the bride can
[1:19:59] cross over judgment where there is no
[1:20:02] more judgment against her but she is
[1:20:05] sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise
[1:20:07] until the day of
[1:20:10] her Eternal
[1:20:13] [Music]
[1:20:17] Redemption so how how are you going to

[1:21:00] blood of bulls and goats and Ashes of
[1:21:02] heer sprinkling the unclean sanctify to

[1:22:17] were born with he would have been born
[1:22:18] in the same muck and the same mire as
[1:22:21] you and I because why because God made
[1:22:23] out of the ground every tree to grow and
[1:22:26] every tree can produce fruit and man had
[1:22:29] a fruit and so did the serpent amen amen
[1:22:33] so in order for God to recreate that

[1:27:44] faithfulness you'll erase every little
[1:27:46] thing that you've ever done in his

[1:29:02] do is go back to that big old
[1:29:06] washtub than
[1:29:12] Lord oh
[1:29:14] oh I'm G to tell you if we was really
[1:29:16] Pentecostals we get with it here tonight

[1:29:21] really was Pentecostal through and
[1:29:23] through I tell you we'd really to get
[1:29:24] with every one of us and get with it in
[1:29:25] the right way you know why we just don't
[1:29:27] seem to hit that spot of satisfaction
[1:29:29] when we're talking about this because
[1:29:30] we're scared to death that when we get
[1:29:32] out there on the street and make some
[1:29:34] kind of a mistake at work or whatever it
[1:29:36] might be we are scared to death that God
[1:29:38] is going to throw us back in hell but
[1:29:40] listen I am not preaching to you
[1:29:42] something that will be here today and
[1:29:44] gone tomorrow I am only identifying what
[1:29:47] already exist hallelujah praise the Lord

[1:29:59] Lord oh listen this brother says stand
[1:30:03] right up over the tub squeeze it down
[1:30:05] and then look into the tub and find it
[1:30:08] that's why I like to tell the devil
[1:30:09] sometimes if you want to know what I
[1:30:11] done wrong I I challenge you to look
[1:30:14] into the blood of Christ and try to find
[1:30:16] my
[1:30:20] sin because if Satan's going to find it
[1:30:22] there's only one place my can go either

[1:32:48] said the coloring of sin goes back
[1:32:50] through those mediators and on down
[1:32:51] throughout the time until it hits the
[1:32:54] accuser
[1:32:59] Satan and it lays on him until
[1:33:07] [Music]
[1:33:08] [Applause]
[1:33:15] judgment so everything he's ever caused
[1:33:18] me to do every rotten good for nothing
[1:33:21] underhanded thing I've ever pulled in my
[1:33:23] life time and I'm sure I'm just like you
[1:33:25] there's a whole list you could put un
[1:33:26] next to your name everything Satan's
[1:33:29] everever tried to talk me into and
[1:33:30] things that I fell to all I have to do
[1:33:33] is
[1:33:37] repent tell Jesus I'm sorry
[1:33:42] amen and God says
[1:33:49] okay no wonder the devil hates you so
[1:33:52] bad he spends your entire life to trap
[1:33:56] you into something he thinks will be the
[1:33:57] end of you and at the very last moment
[1:34:00] you repent or make it right or whatever
[1:34:01] you do and Jesus Takes all that he
[1:34:03] worked to get against you and puts it
[1:34:11] back I don't get credit he
[1:34:20] does glory

[1:34:26] twice as
[1:34:29] loud thank you Lamb of God thank you
[1:34:31] Lord Jesus brother says what happens to
[1:34:34] that son he becomes in perfect
[1:34:36] fellowship with the father he is
[1:34:38] standing on the other side of the chasm
[1:34:41] with no remembrance of sin against
[1:34:45] him when confess sin is dipped into the
[1:34:49] blood of Jesus Christ it kills all
[1:34:52] symptoms every molecule of sin goes back
[1:34:56] to the devil and lays on him to the day
[1:34:59] of
[1:35:02] judgment I love this statement listen to
[1:35:04] this I'll close brother says in Luke 63
[1:35:06] he says when a man confesses his sin
[1:35:07] gets right with God God drops the sin of
[1:35:09] this confession in the blood of his own
[1:35:11] blood and forgives that sin and he
[1:35:14] replaces in that man the original spirit
[1:35:18] that should have been there wow
[1:35:21] Hallelujah beautiful
[1:35:24] amen his own Spirit making him a Son of
[1:35:27] God do you realize when Adam fell that
[1:35:31] what I should have come to the Earth
[1:35:32] what you should have come to the Earth
[1:35:33] with when we first came to this world we
[1:35:35] should have had the Holy Ghost when we
[1:35:37] came yes amen we should have been placed
[1:35:40] in this life with an infilling and
[1:35:42] indwelling of the Holy Ghost and Adam
[1:35:46] lost that infilling of the Holy Ghost so
[1:35:50] when I get the Holy Ghost God is only
[1:35:52] giving me what I I should have
[1:35:54] originally had
[1:35:57] already
[1:36:02] hallu oh my oh

[1:37:35] indicate that there was a part of his
[1:37:36] Sheepfold in the beginning they wasn't
