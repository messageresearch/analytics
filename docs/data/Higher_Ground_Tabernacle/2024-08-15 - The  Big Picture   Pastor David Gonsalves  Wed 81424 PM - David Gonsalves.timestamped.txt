[40:06] USA and it's such an honor for me to be

[40:12] tonight amen with sense of like Precious
[40:17] Faith but more so to be uh hosted by
[40:20] Pastor Z
[40:23] Brooks we've been all been uh fans of
[40:26] his over the years
[40:27] [Music]
[40:30] he's been such a blessing to the bride
[40:35] universally and especially to the bride
[40:37] in South
[40:38] Africa I know he's really
[40:42] appreciated so I bring greetings from
[40:44] different
[40:47] pastors anden there's one Pastor brother
[40:50] Brooks stayed in his
[40:54] home but a man of his stat eruption
[40:57] shoulders with so many
[40:59] people so it's understandable that he
[41:01] won't remember all of
[41:05] it amen so uh this often this evening uh
[41:09] uh I I've come along with my with my
[41:14] wife sister
[41:16] Felicia my wife of almost 50
[41:20] years and then also uh we hooked up with
[41:24] some fellow Saints also from South
[41:26] Africa in

[41:31] area so we thought we'll look
[41:34] up and then just do a little they had a
[41:36] desire to go to Bram Tabernacle in a few
[41:39] places in
[41:42] Indiana and they
[41:44] requested be their
[41:47] guide so I why any opportunity to go you
[41:52] know see some saints of like Precious f
[41:53] is always a
[41:56] pleasure but I believe that the
[41:58] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[41:59] of the
[42:01] Lord uh nothing happens by
[42:04] accident amen we are here for amen
[42:07] because of God saw it before the

[43:03] reaching and he yet so
[43:06] humble but he made such an impact on the
[43:08] country of
[43:10] Zimbabwe and he had such an incredible
[43:17] ability you know outside of
[43:19] Congo I think in the Zimbabwe you get
[43:21] the biggest crowds of
[43:26] believers you would go to special
[43:28] meetings and there would be two 2,000
[43:30] 3,000 4,000 5,000 Believers in one
[43:38] venue and one incident I recall very
[43:40] clearly uh I think the laain were
[43:44] there and there was about 120 ministers
[43:47] sitting on the one
[43:50] side and Pastor chesta knew each and
[43:53] everyone by name where they came from
[43:55] the country they were from
[44:00] it was just
[44:03] mindblowing and I believe brother Samuel
[44:05] is such a blessing here as
[44:08] well oh man like they say you know he's
[44:10] a chip of the old
[44:14] block mean whenever we were went to the
[44:17] arari area I mean we always hosted by
[44:19] his
[44:22] dad amen so it's such a honor for me
[44:25] tonight to be here
[44:28] uh just to be uh we had to break the
[44:32] word of God you break bread with
[44:36] Saints and my desire is that I will say
[44:38] something that will benefit
[44:42] you
[44:49] coming plan for for this trip was
[44:51] actually to go to Canada is to go to
[44:53] Canada
[44:57] that's the purpose of our our trip to
[44:59] this part of the
[45:02] world so the first connecting flight was
[45:07] cancelled and then the uh then the bags
[45:10] were were
[45:13] missing and when these things start
[45:15] happening you know we in for a
[45:20] blessing you see we not always aware of
[45:23] the big
[45:24] picture but all things are
[45:27] control hallelujah hallelujah amen so if
[45:30] you have your Bibles let's stand to our
[45:31] feet amen as
[45:34] we uh navigate to scripture in I believe
[45:38] it's a end time
[45:41] scripture I mean it's Luke
[45:46] 2426 just after the
[45:50] resurrection ien Jesus uh uh meets two
[45:54] men on the way to EMAs
[46:04] and they seemed to be a bit
[46:08] disturbed and uh Jesus says why are you
[46:12] looking so
[46:14] sad why are you a stranger don't you
[46:16] know what
[46:20] happened you know we you know our Lord
[46:22] Jesus Christ was crucified and we
[46:24] thought he's the one that's going to
[46:25] deliver us and set us
[46:30] free and many times we have the wrong
[46:36] impression you know sometimes thinks
[46:37] that Jesus Christ was a a Liberation
[46:41] fighter he said my kingdom was of this
[46:45] world I would have called 10,000 angels
[46:48] change the scene
[46:49] immediately Hallelujah but we amen as
[46:52] Abram seed we are just pilgrims and
[46:55] strangers we looking to
[46:59] building makers
[47:02] God Amen so Luke chapter 24 and
[47:07] I'll I think let me read just maybe from
[47:10] about
[47:13] 20 uh verse 21 says but we trusted that
[47:17] it had been he which should have
[47:19] redeemed Israel and besides all this
[47:22] today is the third day since these
[47:23] things were done
[47:26] [Music]
[47:31] yeah and certain women also of our
[47:33] company made us astonished which were
[47:35] early at the
[47:42] Seer I mean they found not his body they
[47:44] came saying that they had not seen uh
[47:47] they had also seen a vision of angels
[47:49] which said that he was alive
[47:53] [Music]
[47:57] and certain of them which were with us
[47:58] went to the
[48:02] [Music]
[48:03] Seer and found it even as so so as the
[48:06] women had said but him they saw
[48:12] not then said he unto them oh fools and
[48:16] slow of heart to believe all that the
[48:18] prophets had
[48:24] spoken ought not Christ to have suffered
[48:27] these things and to enter into his
[48:33] glory and beginning at Moses and all the
[48:36] prophets he expounded unto them in all
[48:40] the scriptures the things concerning
[48:48] himself amen I like that part amen it
[48:51] reminds me of the time he went to the
[48:53] the the the synagogue the Bible says
[48:56] the synagogue as was his
[48:59] custom so Jesus went to
[49:02] church and and they gave him the
[49:04] Scrolls and he found the place where it
[49:07] was
[49:08] written the spirit of the Lord is upon
[49:10] me he's anointed me to preach Good
[49:13] Tidings Liberty the captives to preach
[49:16] the acceptable year of the
[49:20] Lord the scripture is
[49:23] fulfilled how many he found himself in
[49:25] the word
[49:27] he knew he was hallelujah amen amen and
[49:31] it's time that we as the
[49:33] Bride come to a place where we know who
[49:36] we
[49:37] are find yourself in the volume of the
[49:40] book hallelujah praise the Lord and the
[49:43] Bible says amen and verse says and ought
[49:47] not Christ to have suffered these
[49:50] things and to enter into His
[49:53] Glory Hallelujah so suffering precedes
[49:56] Glory
[49:59] many times people think when you join
[50:02] Church going to be a flowy bed of
[50:06] EAS but every Sun that comes has to be
[50:09] tried has to be
[50:13] tested amen amen amen so this evening if

[50:47] it for
[50:48] us he'll hear your hearts
[50:50] cry there was a woman with a blood

[56:50] Iron until the time that his word came
[56:57] the word of the Lord Tried

[57:02] Time brother and
[57:04] sister while we are waiting for our word
[57:06] to

[57:12] there will be some
[57:14] molding there will be some
[57:16] shaping you know brother says in one
[57:19] place he says in the old
[57:21] days when they were purifying
[57:24] gold amen the beater would place a piece
[57:27] of gold there and he would beat it and
[57:30] turn it and beat it and turn it and beat
[57:33] it until you would see his own image his
[57:37] own reflection in that piece of gold so
[57:41] when you are going through your trials
[57:43] when you going through your test God is
[57:46] beating you God is turning you because
[57:49] he wants to see him reflected in

[58:38] colors but his bre hated him you see he
[58:41] couldn't help it that he saw
[58:44] Visions or that he could dream
[58:48] dreams amen so they even plotted to kill
[58:51] him at least Reuben had some senses as
[58:54] our brother let's not kill him
[58:57] let's rather sell him and make a
[59:01] profit Hallelujah typical Jew amen let's
[59:03] make a prophet out of it

[59:17] hand and the Bible says while he was
[59:19] around amen the the everything that
[59:21] Joseph touched
[59:25] prospered I'm sure over that time the
[59:27] the netwood of ptif
[59:31] SW because there was a faithful
[59:35] Steward
[59:37] until P's wife had some eyes on

[59:44] servant he's a slave he's away from his
[59:49] people there's no Deacon there's no
[59:52] Pastor watching him he could have said

[59:57] but he says I will not sin against my
[1:00:00] God how My Mind Is Made Up hallelujah

[1:00:08] uh gments come into the into
[1:00:11] play we all know about his coat of many

[1:01:45] Away amen the says one place he says you
[1:01:48] know sometimes we feel that after God
[1:01:49] had created us he has no more interest
[1:01:52] in his creation
[1:01:57] says that's wrong
[1:01:59] thinking that's why he says I will never
[1:02:02] leave you I will be with you hallelujah
[1:02:07] amen we may be aware of what's
[1:02:09] happening but God is in
[1:02:12] control amen one time there was elishah

[1:12:01] of that's why David had such
[1:12:05] confidence that he knew that God was
[1:12:08] with
[1:12:09] him you know many times uh in the in the
[1:12:12] Bible people are defined by certain
[1:12:17] scripture like Abram is a friend of God
[1:12:21] hallelujah John the disciple Jesus loved
[1:12:26] when we talk about Abram the father of
[1:12:29] Faith so you need to find yourself a
[1:12:32] scripture that defines you Hallelujah so
[1:12:36] when the enemy comes like a flood when
[1:12:38] the devil tries to preach to you you can

[1:13:12] shepherd He was not a Hing
[1:13:16] Shepherd he's not in it for the
[1:13:20] pay so he's looking after the

[1:13:26] and he stands his ground takes out his
[1:13:29] slingshot doesn't look at the the lion
[1:13:33] is the
[1:13:33] Lion a bear
[1:13:36] comes he slays the bear how because you
[1:13:39] know no I'm about my father's person I
[1:13:42] must protect
[1:13:44] the true shepher know in the East a
[1:13:48] Shepherd they would build a little crawl
[1:13:50] or a little uh
[1:13:53] enclosure and
[1:13:55] lay in the in the
[1:13:58] opening so no evil can come
[1:14:02] in except it has to cross the
[1:14:05] shepherd none of the sheep can go out
[1:14:08] hallelujah oh praise the Lord amen and
[1:14:12] that's why when David got to the camp
[1:14:13] the one
[1:14:14] day taking some bread for his

[1:14:20] church and there a oh to the the

[1:26:59] legitim illegitimate child not a son or
[1:27:02] a daughter of
[1:27:04] God certainly not but the spiritual

[1:28:31] Christ was perfected by
[1:28:38] suffering and according to Paul he has
[1:28:41] left his church a measure of
[1:28:44] suffering that they too by their faith
[1:28:47] in God while

[1:31:07] special touch for I perceive that virtue
[1:31:10] had left
[1:31:12] me Hallelujah tonight you can touch him
[1:31:15] such way bring him to a stand and he'll
[1:31:18] say I felt that virtue had left
[1:31:21] me amen amen
[1:31:24] Hallelujah you know she reminds me of
[1:31:26] that woman that Mexican
[1:31:29] woman she had heard from a neighbor she
[1:31:31] was a Catholic by the way she heard that
[1:31:35] there was some dead people that was
[1:31:37] raised and some blind people Fai coming
[1:31:40] by hearing not Rumors heing by the word
[1:31:43] of
[1:31:44] God and saw a little child had
[1:31:47] died oh but on the inside there was
[1:31:50] something that stirred
[1:31:52] hallelujah amen if God can do it for
[1:31:54] them God can do it for me oh my she took
[1:31:58] that baby in the rain wrapped that child
[1:32:02] Walken when she got to to the the
[1:32:05] meeting it was crowded there was a line
[1:32:08] of uh deacons and Ashes can't get you
[1:32:13] she reminded me in our country we play a
[1:32:15] game called rugby it's almost
[1:32:18] like Hallelujah I can see where that
[1:32:20] baby she wanted to go yet they blocking
[1:32:23] there but ah Hallelujah she C such a
[1:32:26] stir that the news got to brother what's
[1:32:29] happening down there oh there's a woman
[1:32:31] with a child H praise the Lord amen amen
[1:32:35] and we know the story amen the baby was
[1:32:38] healed you see but it needed some
[1:32:42] desperation it needed some action it
[1:32:44] needed to believe that there is a
[1:32:47] possibility hallelujah amen many people
[1:32:50] oh maybe when she gets to back to the
[1:32:52] the village with her baby oh my baby
[1:32:54] healed uh uh oh praise the Lord but they
[1:32:56] don't know what you went
[1:32:58] through through the through the
[1:33:03] C pumped by the but she was
[1:33:07] persistent you left some challenges but
[1:33:09] go all the
[1:33:12] way
[1:33:14] amen amen says in the churches
[1:33:18] book unless we suffer with
[1:33:22] him we cannot reign with
[1:33:24] him you have to suffer to
[1:33:27] rain what a
[1:33:29] paradox you have to suffer to rain the
[1:33:33] reason for this is that character simply
[1:33:34] is never made without
[1:33:37] suffering character is a
[1:33:40] victory not a gift Hallelujah a man
[1:33:44] without character can't
[1:33:47] rain because character apart from Power
[1:33:50] without character is satanic
[1:33:54] but Power with character to
[1:34:00] rule and since he wants to share even
[1:34:03] his throne on the same basis that he
[1:34:08] overcame and sit down on the father's
[1:34:12] Throne then we have to overcome to sit
[1:34:15] with
[1:34:16] him and the little temporary sufferings
[1:34:20] we go through now
[1:34:23] worthy to be
[1:34:25] compared with the tremendous
[1:34:29] Glory that will be revealed in
[1:34:32] us when he comes oh brother sister the
[1:34:36] th the test the rejection the T death
[1:34:39] brother sister oh god brother sister is
[1:34:42] first wanting you to overcome so you can
[1:34:44] sit with
[1:34:46] him what are laid up for those who are
[1:34:50] willing to enter into his kingdom
[1:34:53] through
[1:34:57] tribulation Hallelujah is this thinking
[1:35:00] not strange concerning the firey
[1:35:03] trials that are to try you that is what
[1:35:06] Peter
[1:35:07] said is it strange that God wants us to
[1:35:10] develop a Christlike
[1:35:16] character that comes through
[1:35:18] suffering amen it's you know it's it's
[1:35:21] an oxymoron
[1:35:24] amen
[1:35:25] suffering but there's glory on there
[1:35:28] it's a
[1:35:30] contradiction it's a paradox it's how
[1:35:33] you know one minister in our church once
[1:35:36] preached a message the image of the
[1:35:39] invisible
[1:35:40] God that doesn't make
[1:35:43] sense image invisible
[1:35:47] the and I you know I thought about that
[1:35:51] and then the penny dropped I said that's
[1:35:53] how God operat
[1:35:54] [Music]
[1:35:55] I can imagine the day when Isaiah was
[1:35:57] told pick up your
[1:35:59] [Music]
[1:36:02] pen a virgin shall
[1:36:07] conceive uh excuse me excuse me
[1:36:11] Lord a virgin
[1:36:13] sh I don't think the prophet doubted
[1:36:17] anything no you see prophets realize
[1:36:20] it's their job to write down
[1:36:24] it's God's job to perform
[1:36:27] it don't try and help
[1:36:30] God hallelujah hallelujah amen God's
[1:36:33] word will not return unto him void it
[1:36:35] will accomplish the purpose it was sent
[1:36:40] for hallelujah oh my look at this he
[1:36:43] says now a Christlike character comes to
[1:36:45] suffering he says no sir we all have
[1:36:48] Tri we are alled Chas
[1:36:53] one but goes through
[1:36:56] that the church is not
[1:37:00] suffering and is not being
[1:37:05] tried hasn't got it isn't of
[1:37:09] [Music]
[1:37:11] God W that's
[1:37:13] profound that God wants you to suffer
[1:37:16] that God wants you to be
[1:37:19] challenged oh but he says when the enemy
[1:37:21] comes like a flood
[1:37:23] he will raise a
[1:37:26] standard oh praise God
[1:37:28] hallelujah amen amen it says for to you
[1:37:32] Philippians 1: he says for for to you it
[1:37:35] has been granted on behalf of Christ not
[1:37:38] only to believe in him but also for to
[1:37:40] suffer for his
[1:37:44] sick and so many of us hasn't heard all
[1:37:46] these scriptures you know I I when I uh
[1:37:49] uh when we get new
[1:37:51] candidates for baptism people they
[1:37:54] decide they want to follow Jesus they
[1:37:55] give give their heart to the
[1:37:57] Lord so I tell them you know you know
[1:38:00] what you're letting yourself
[1:38:03] Ino This Is
[1:38:06] War that's why Paul says put on the
[1:38:08] whole armor of
[1:38:09] God hallelujah amen says This Is War
[1:38:14] amen be challenging it's not a flowy bed
[1:38:17] of e so you got to know go in here with
[1:38:20] a A sound mind
[1:38:23] you
[1:38:25] see so
[1:38:27] unfortunately uh especially among the uh
[1:38:30] Prosperity Gospel
[1:38:35] crowd we are told God is a good
[1:38:39] God God wants to bless you and I have no
[1:38:43] problem with it God wants to bless us
[1:38:46] you know if you come to our church
[1:38:48] you'll get a new
[1:38:51] milk you may get a husband that you
[1:38:54] desire might get promotion at work and I
[1:38:58] always tell our
[1:39:00] church seek first the kingdom of
[1:39:03] God and his
[1:39:05] righteousness all the other things will
[1:39:07] be added unto
[1:39:09] you be faithful in the
[1:39:12] little and then God uh put you in line
[1:39:16] for the fringe
[1:39:18] benefits so these other things are are
[1:39:20] the addir on but but seek first the
[1:39:22] kingdom of God
[1:39:25] Hallelujah there's nothing wrong with
[1:39:26] God there God has
[1:39:28] blessed our sister with a lovely car and
[1:39:31] God has blessed a good job and all of
[1:39:33] those things are part of our
[1:39:36] work but I believe also God says you
[1:39:39] know uh we have to be faithful
[1:39:41] stewards and God gives each one of
[1:39:46] us according to our several
[1:39:49] ability God knows our capacity
[1:39:54] and he gives one one
[1:39:56] Talent other want two talents other want
[1:39:59] three
[1:40:00] talents don't be upset with
[1:40:03] God only give me two gives him five no
[1:40:07] no no no no don't or maybe you from the
[1:40:11] outside you watch out oh he's got
[1:40:13] 10 but he was faithful with the five
[1:40:16] maybe he started with with with one and
[1:40:19] the one became two and the two became
[1:40:21] four and he got the one from the the
[1:40:23] lazy
[1:40:24] one and the five became 10 you see his
[1:40:28] glory but you don't know his
[1:40:30] story many times people look at the
[1:40:33] church and the church is
[1:40:35] flourishing hallelujah it's back
[1:40:38] beautiful
[1:40:40] buing that's why God is not interested
[1:40:42] in caral
[1:40:43] comparisons you don't know what went in
[1:40:46] the sweat and the tears and the
[1:40:49] sacrifices you know in the initial
[1:40:52] stages aart puts in more than what he
[1:40:55] gets out so this is not a financial
[1:40:58] thing that you transaction trying to see
[1:41:01] there a good return on
[1:41:05] investment you know working for the lord
[1:41:08] it's long
[1:41:10] hours but the retirement benefit is out
[1:41:13] of this
[1:41:15] world
[1:41:17] hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord
[1:41:20] amen God Amen uh Timothy says two
[1:41:24] if we
[1:41:25] suffer we shall also reign with
[1:41:29] him amen if we deny he will also deny

[1:41:37] rain suffer
[1:41:39] while amen amen Matthew tells us uh 25
[1:41:44] and the Lord said unto him well done now

[1:41:48] Faithful over few things I will make the
[1:41:50] ruler over many things
[1:41:53] into the joy of the
[1:41:59] Lord and if you watch that Parable uh
[1:42:02] all of them got the same reward except
[1:42:04] the the The Lazy
[1:42:08] oneish enter into the joys that has been
[1:42:10] prepared for

[1:42:28] Joseph and showed him
[1:42:30] mercy and gave gave him favor in the

[1:43:13] at the promises of God through
[1:43:15] unbelief was strong giving God the
[1:43:17] praise he looked beyond

[1:50:57] me but God oh my oh my God but God made
[1:51:02] it un
[1:51:04] good to bring to pass as it is this day
[1:51:06] to save much people
[1:51:10] alive so God is using us he's molding us
[1:51:15] he's trying us because he's got a plan
[1:51:18] and a
[1:51:19] purpose Hallelujah to bring much people
[1:51:24] alive Hallelujah you know the Bible says
[1:51:26] the whole creation is groing in is
[1:51:29] waiting you know when you walk past the
[1:51:33] tree saying how long how long get tuned
[1:51:38] into the right uh Channel
[1:51:41] amen because the Bible says the whole
[1:51:43] creation is growing we see Earth we
[1:51:46] see
[1:51:51] Volcan these things have been happening
[1:51:52] but the the severity and the intensity
[1:51:55] is just getting to another
[1:52:04] level you know over the last year if you
[1:52:07] look at the the Quakes in in in
[1:52:13] California you know what was so profound
[1:52:15] for me I think was the beginning of last
[1:52:18] year in January last year on the
[1:52:21] anniversary of the picture of of the PO
[1:52:23] of fire the very same
[1:52:26] day you know speaks about 3 minutes
[1:52:33] midnight this the D clock it was mve
[1:52:38] from 30 seconds I mean from 3 minutes to
[1:52:41] 90
[1:52:43] seconds the closest it has ever been and
[1:52:46] on the same day that this was uh the
[1:52:49] anniversary of the picture is when they
[1:52:53] announced that because it was the war in
[1:52:55] Ukraine it was all the different
[1:52:58] conflict so how late is the
[1:53:01] hour oh my brothers the prophet is at
[1:53:04] one stage I can almost see that angel
[1:53:05] standing there saying time shall be no
[1:53:10] more Hallelujah so Brothers it's it's
[1:53:14] later than what we think I me the bride
[1:53:16] has got to get itself ready you know
[1:53:19] things can happen
[1:53:20] overnight remember how many uh
[1:53:23] prophecies were fulfilled in those last
[1:53:25] few hours on on the Lord on
[1:53:28] the amen multiple prophecies in matter
