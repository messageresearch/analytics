[32:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Surely God is good to us tonight. Amen.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; We're just going to get right into the
[32:52] word of the Lord.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; Ask that you turn with us to Romans the
[32:58] 8th chapter.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We're going to start reading at
[33:06] the 33rd verse.
[33:12] We'll read extensively to the verses
[33:16] 39th verse.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; And
[33:25] yeah, we'll just leave it there.
[33:31] Who shall lay anything to the charge of
[33:34] God's elect?
[33:36] It is God that justifith.
[33:42] Who is he that condemnth?
[33:46] It is Christ that died, gave rather,
[33:48] that is risen again, who is even at the
[33:51] right hand of God, who also maketh
[33:54] intercessions for us.
[34:02] Who shall separate us from the love of
[34:04] Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or
[34:08] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[34:11] pearl or sword?
[34:23] As it is written, for thy sake we are
[34:26] killed all the day long.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; We are counted as sheep for the
[34:31] slaughter.
[34:42] through him that loveth us.
[34:48] For I am persuaded that neither death
[34:51] nor life, nor angels, nor principality,
[34:55] nor power, nor pres nor things presence,
[34:58] nor things to come,
[35:07] &gt;&gt; nor height, nor depth, nor any other
[35:10] creature shall be able to separate us
[35:13] from the love of God which is in Christ
[35:15] Jesus. our Lord.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us pray. Dear heavenly father,
[35:30] we come before you, Lord Jesus.
[35:32] As humbly as we know how. We thank you
[35:35] for this lovely time of day. Forgive us
[35:38] for anything we may have said or done
[35:42] that may not been pleasing to your
[35:43] sight. Bless the service this evening.
[35:47] Let your grace abound in our lives,
[35:49] Lord, and we'll be careful to give you
[35:51] the praise, glory, and honor.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; We just want to thank the Lord God for
[36:11] his grace and his mercy.
[36:14] We thank you for your prayers uh during
[36:17] our
[36:19] time of absence here.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; Uh the funeral service of brother Bobby
[36:27] WZ
[36:30] &gt;&gt; on Thursday what went well. I was in
[36:34] Minnesota
[36:36] &gt;&gt; and then my wife and I flew out
[36:40] &gt;&gt; on Friday
[36:43] down to South Carolina
[36:46] &gt;&gt; to uh our pastor's wife funeral.
[36:50] It It was amazing.
[36:53] It truly was a homegoing.
[36:57] It truly was a celebration.
[37:02] And it so many people spoke so highly of
[37:05] her.
[37:09] Another thing that was really wonderful.
[37:12] It was more like a reunion
[37:18] got to see people whom I had never
[37:21] hadn't seen in a long time.
[37:24] Even some even some denominational
[37:27] friends and brethren.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; It was a beautiful situation.
[37:32] And so we thank you for your prayers.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; We did get a chance to see my
[37:38] sister-in-law
[37:41] &gt;&gt; is struggling or I don't know how to say
[37:44] it.
[37:45] Uh because the time prior to that our
[37:49] visitation it seems as though she only
[37:52] had a short time to live.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; And then when we return this time
[38:02] God had touched her body and she was
[38:05] still in the bed, but she had so much
[38:07] strength. She was talking. She was
[38:10] laughing. And it was a glorious time
[38:12] with my brother as well as with his
[38:14] wife.
[38:16] Her name is Adrian.
[38:18] So, if you can remember her in prayer,
[38:22] she is truly a woman of faith.
[38:26] So, we appreciate everything.
[38:29] This is going to sound like a strange
[38:33] subject for a message,
[38:40] &gt;&gt; but by the grace of God,
[38:44] &gt;&gt; I feel like I was really inspired
[38:48] in such a strange way. And I'm not sure
[38:51] if I'm going to bring this message the
[38:53] way God gave it to me.
[38:58] Sometimes God talk to me in my dreams
[39:02] &gt;&gt; and in my dreams. Sometimes I don't get
[39:05] up like I should
[39:08] to write things down like I should,
[39:12] but I pray by the grace of God that that
[39:15] I did get the most of what he wanted to
[39:18] say.
[39:21] And it dealt with rainbows.
[39:28] the rainbow.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; And um it was beautiful.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; Everything I saw was beautiful.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; But something I saw in the dream I had
[39:40] never seen.
[39:45] And the rainbow was not outside of me,
[39:50] but the rainbow was inside of me.
[39:54] Amen.
[39:55] But before I go any further,
[39:59] &gt;&gt; it wasn't colors.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; It was character.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; And I I was just amazed. I'm still
[40:10] amazed at what I saw
[40:12] and what I was able to comprehend.
[40:16] So my subject tonight is the living
[40:18] colors of the rainbow.
[40:26] And so that you understand all of these
[40:28] things, I trust I'll be able to tie in
[40:34] &gt;&gt; because there's another thing that
[40:36] produces the colors of a rainbow
[40:40] outside of water droplets and climate.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; The diamond
[40:49] &gt;&gt; the diamond also
[40:51] produces the color of the rainbow.
[40:56] And brother Brandham said that the there
[40:59] is a great diamond
[41:03] &gt;&gt; and that diamond is the diamond of God
[41:07] who is Jesus Christ.
[41:10] This diamond had to be cut.
[41:14] It had to be shipped.
[41:17] And brother Random said the pieces of
[41:21] or the chips of the of that diamond
[41:25] was given to you and I
[41:30] &gt;&gt; as gifts.
[41:33] So if I had a sub a sub a subtopic
[41:37] I would call it the covenant people.
[41:43] I read the scripture in Romans
[41:46] because when I read that scripture,
[41:50] I think to myself,
[41:52] &gt;&gt; there's no way
[41:55] a true believer
[41:58] can ever be lost.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:03] It it's so amazing to me
[42:07] how we have struggled so many years
[42:12] with ourselves
[42:15] with doctrines.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; And when it comes to your salvation,
[42:22] doctrine has nothing to do with it
[42:26] because you're not saved by your
[42:27] doctrine.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; You're saved by grace.
[42:33] Hallelujah.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Remember when brother Brandham
[42:39] &gt;&gt; saw those three powerful rainbows?
[42:45] I think he said they grew up to about 30
[42:47] foot tall.
[42:54] And then then he took his hat off
[42:58] &gt;&gt; and he spoke to those rainbows
[43:02] and said, "God, what would you have of
[43:04] your servant?"
[43:06] Out of the rainbow,
[43:09] the spirit of the Lord spoke
[43:13] in the message of grace.
[43:16] Paragraph 26.
[43:18] Brother said, "Just then
[43:21] the spirit of the Lord came in and said
[43:26] Jesus of the New Testament
[43:30] &gt;&gt; is Jehovah of the Old."
[43:33] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Came by me.
[43:37] He said came in
[43:40] and said Jesus of the New Testament
[43:44] is Jehovah of the Old.
[43:48] He only changes mask
[43:51] from spirit to man
[43:55] that was confirming of course
[43:59] my message of him.
[44:02] letting me know assured
[44:05] that these 31 years
[44:09] hasn't been in vain.
[44:13] Now, perhaps that doesn't mean much to
[44:15] you,
[44:17] but to just ordinary preacher,
[44:21] we like to be right on the word.
[44:27] But when God comes and vindicates it
[44:31] and speak to you directly
[44:35] that your message have been correct
[44:39] for 31 years
[44:42] and I think about this is in 1961.
[44:47] Give him two more years in 1963
[44:52] right at the age of what? Jesus Christ
[44:56] leaving the earth right at a time of
[45:00] transition.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; The seals were open.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; 2,000 years later,
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Christ comes in such a secret way
[45:15] that the world could not catch it.
[45:20] They couldn't understand it.
[45:23] And here was this man talking about
[45:26] things like John the Baptist would talk
[45:28] about.
[45:31] He came talking about squirrels and
[45:34] you know and eagles and things of the
[45:37] wilderness where he learned God through
[45:40] nature.
[45:43] Hallelujah. Amen.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; But you see, by the grace of God,
[45:48] &gt;&gt; even in brother Brandham's uh days,
[45:52] &gt;&gt; he had to come to see what true grace
[45:56] was.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; He was a man just like we are.
[46:02] And he had to take the journey just like
[46:04] we all did, right?
[46:07] But when you come to know that the grace
[46:09] of God is sovereign,
[46:13] &gt;&gt; that means he doesn't need anybody
[46:15] else's pos uh permission.
[46:18] God will do whatever he wants to do.
[46:22] That's why we can't just judge each
[46:24] other any kind of way.
[46:29] And brother Brandham talks about it like
[46:30] this.
[46:32] He said, "As long as a man
[46:35] has a pull in his life
[46:38] or desire to have more God,
[46:42] &gt;&gt; no matter how bad they are,
[46:45] God is not finished with that man.
[46:49] So we have no right to write anybody off
[46:53] regardless to how it appears to us
[46:58] because we don't know what God is doing.
[47:02] Hallelujah.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Remember the time
[47:05] &gt;&gt; when brother Brandham saw the woman
[47:08] &gt;&gt; with purple hair, purple nails, tattoos.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; I mean, she had everything
[47:16] that a harlot would wear.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But behind all of that,
[47:24] &gt;&gt; she was a daughter of God.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And in brother Brandham's
[47:30] judgment,
[47:32] judging as a man,
[47:34] he said, "God, how can you put up with
[47:36] such a thing?
[47:39] Why don't you just wipe it off the
[47:41] earth?"
[47:43] And God said, "Let's have a conference.
[47:47] Come on behind the door."
[47:50] And behind that door, God told showed
[47:52] brother Brandham,
[47:54] &gt;&gt; not somebody else's sin.
[47:57] He showed brother Brandham his own sin.
[48:02] But one thing he did show brother
[48:03] Brandham
[48:05] is that the whole world
[48:08] was covered by the blood of Jesus.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:13] So that blood,
[48:15] &gt;&gt; that veil
[48:17] &gt;&gt; gives the the most vile sinner
[48:22] &gt;&gt; a chance to repent
[48:25] a chance to say be saved.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; And then the Lord told uh showed brother
[48:32] Bham
[48:34] who this woman was.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; She was just a backslider.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Did y'all hear what I said?
[48:42] I said a backslider.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; She once was God.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; And so you understand when you once was
[48:49] God,
[48:51] &gt;&gt; you will always be God
[48:54] no matter your condition.
[48:57] So we find out.
[49:00] Amen. The prophet of God
[49:02] &gt;&gt; nailed kneelled with that woman
[49:06] &gt;&gt; in that restaurant
[49:08] that looked like a juke joint joint. U
[49:13] how could I say it? Look like a potty
[49:15] house
[49:17] and led her back to Christ.
[49:20] Guess what?
[49:22] You will see her there.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Let me read a quote.
[49:30] coming from the message of grace,
[49:33] &gt;&gt; paragraph
[49:35] &gt;&gt; 130, I believe,
[49:37] &gt;&gt; it says, "Soverevereign grace
[49:40] can only be given by one that's
[49:42] sovereign,
[49:44] &gt;&gt; and God is sovereign."
[49:47] &gt;&gt; So, he can give sovereign grace.
[49:51] Therefore, being sovereign,
[49:54] &gt;&gt; grace don't have to ask anybody.
[49:59] It don't have it don't have to.
[50:03] It does it want does what it wants to.
[50:09] Isn't that wonderful?
[50:11] It don't have to ask.
[50:14] Can I do this or shall I do this? Can I?
[50:20] Must I will I? Nothing to it. It does it
[50:26] itself.
[50:28] Grace is sovereign.
[50:30] Therefore, he can save the violence.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; He can save the worst.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; He can save the impurist.
[50:39] He can save the immoralist.
[50:41] He can heal the sick. Hallelujah.
[50:45] He can save a wretch like me.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; AND HE DID.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; What is it?
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Grace.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; William Brandham.
[50:56] a drunker's son.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; That don't make any difference.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; The grace of God saved me.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Excuse me. Me,
[51:06] &gt;&gt; I'm a I'm a woman's daughter.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; That was no good. Don't make any
[51:14] difference.
[51:16] The grace of God saved you.
[51:19] It's sovereign.
[51:21] Has to ask nobody nothing. Amen. And I'm
[51:26] so glad of of that.
[51:29] Yes, sir. Can take the violent sinner
[51:33] &gt;&gt; and make him white as snow. Hallelujah.
[51:36] Don't has to ask anybody about it. OH,
[51:40] IF I can do it because it's sovereign.
[51:45] Listen quickly now. That was proved at
[51:48] the cross
[51:49] when there was a violent thief.
[51:52] He deserved to die. God had never God
[51:56] had never come across his mind.
[51:59] He never thought nothing OF IT. THERE
[52:02] WAS there on the cross when though those
[52:07] bloody through those bloody lips
[52:11] in between the groans there came a
[52:13] sound.
[52:15] [Music]
[52:18] be merciful to me.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; I love that deep call to the deer.
[52:23] Hallelujah. And there came another one
[52:26] back through blood.
[52:28] Tears
[52:30] agony.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Grace took a hold and said,
[52:34] &gt;&gt; "Today,
[52:36] SHALT THOU BE WITH ME in paradise."
[52:40] GRACE DID THAT.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; HOW COULD THAT thief help himself?
[52:46] No more than Adam could help himself.
[52:49] No more than Eve could help himself.
[52:53] No more than you can help yourself.
[52:56] No more than I can HELP MYSELF
[53:00] WITH. No more. We could jerk ourselves
[53:02] up to the Milky White way
[53:04] &gt;&gt; with our bootstraps.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Excuse me.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; We couldn't do it.
[53:14] But the grace of God
[53:16] &gt;&gt; can do something about it.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Excuse me.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; But the grace of God can do something
[53:29] about it.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; And it does it.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; The grace of God.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; The sovereignty of the grace of God.
[53:38] Come to that dying thief.
[53:41] today thou shalt be with me IN PARADISE.
[53:45] OH, THINK OF IT. That's wonderful.
[53:49] Hallelujah.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; So, I want you to understand.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That
[53:55] &gt;&gt; a rainbow just can't be formed.
[54:00] It takes certain conditions.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that right?
[54:08] But with it all,
[54:10] we understand that love and grace are
[54:12] twin sisters.
[54:16] If you say you have grace
[54:18] and you can't love,
[54:21] then you don't have you don't have grace
[54:24] because grace and love comes together.
[54:28] Hallelujah.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; They are the same according to the
[54:31] prophet.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; You can't have one without the other.
[54:37] Love is grace.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; You can have you can't you can have any
[54:44] and every gift cannot be saved.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; You are saved
[54:51] by grace alone.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Turn with me to Revelations 10, please.
[55:10] Why are you preaching this?
[55:12] &gt;&gt; We worry too much.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; We make some mistakes
[55:19] &gt;&gt; and we think we're hellbound.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Not if God's grace has captured you.
[55:28] Do you understand
[55:32] &gt;&gt; to actually hear this message
[55:35] &gt;&gt; is the grace of God.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Let me define this. Let me say it clear.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; You are pieces of the diamond.
[55:47] You came from God
[55:49] and you go back to God.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; All diamonds are not the same.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; You got black diamonds. You got white
[55:59] diamonds.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; You got emeralds.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Just various diamonds. It all depends on
[56:06] how the light strikes it.
[56:09] Hallelujah.
[56:11] I love this. One of the things I love
[56:13] about music.
[56:16] It takes a chord
[56:19] to make a beautiful sound.
[56:23] One note by itself is it just don't make
[56:26] it.
[56:28] But you put certain notes together
[56:30] and get a little chord going,
[56:33] &gt;&gt; then we call it music.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; That's how it is. The body of Christ.
[56:39] You're not here just for yourself.
[56:42] YOU'RE here to make certain sounds so
[56:45] God can put it all together and we can
[56:48] bring some music in here.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; A rainbow is not OF ONE COLOR.
[56:58] SEVEN DIFFERENT colors
[57:01] and it's beautiful,
[57:03] right? And when you see it, guess what
[57:07] you think? Oh, praise the Lord.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Isn't that A BLESSING? IT'S SOMETHING
[57:12] ABOUT a rainbow
[57:15] that literally spells bound you,
[57:18] especially when you see a double one.
[57:21] Hallelujah. Now, I don't know about you,
[57:23] but I've had two I've had it more than
[57:25] once. double rainbows over my house.
[57:30] I can see it in the back and I can see
[57:32] it from the front.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; And when I see those rainbows, you know
[57:39] what I think? He's alpha and omega.
[57:43] Hallelujah.
[57:45] Revelations 10
[57:47] beginning at the first verse.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; We can't help what this perverted
[57:53] generation has done with the rainbow.
[57:58] But we can't be ashamed of ours either.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[58:06] &gt;&gt; And right now sometimes you're so afraid
[58:08] to wear certain colors
[58:13] because you think somebody going to
[58:14] think you
[58:16] something wrong.
[58:21] But you must understand
[58:24] &gt;&gt; everything is given to you.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; All yours.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; When God created all those colors.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, wait a minute,
[58:37] brother." Well, let me tell you like
[58:39] this. The beauty of the peacock
[58:46] &gt;&gt; bird is the male.
[58:51] I'm just saying
[58:54] &gt;&gt; we're the ones that been brought in a
[58:56] perverted way.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; You hear what I'm saying?
[59:00] &gt;&gt; But I don't want to get into that. Let's
[59:02] move on. And I saw another mighty angel
[59:05] come down from heaven
[59:08] clothed with a cloud,
[59:11] and a rainbow was upon his head,
[59:14] and his face was as it were the sun.
[59:18] and his feet as pillars of fire.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Now, when I saw this,
[59:25] &gt;&gt; I thought about
[59:28] how it was a clothed with a cloud
[59:31] and a rainbow.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[59:38] &gt;&gt; So, we realized by the grace of God
[59:41] that God identify himself with the
[59:43] rainbow,
[59:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:47] and even in the stature of a perfect
[59:49] man.
[59:51] Now, those colors ain't quite right,
[59:54] but we have a rainbow.
[59:58] But what I did not know
[1:00:01] is that when all those colors blend
[1:00:04] together,
[1:00:07] they produce a white light.
[1:00:10] [Music]
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'M SAYING?
[1:00:17] AMEN.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY JESUS SAYS, "Yeah are the
[1:00:20] light of the world."
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Because you are now carrying
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; the virtue
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; and the rainbow OF GOD
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; ON THE INSIDE.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY?
[1:00:36] BECAUSE HE sits on YOUR THRONE.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; And on the throne
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; WAS A CLOUD.
[1:00:46] COME ON, SOMEBODY. LET ME SAY WHY WASN'T
[1:00:49] it just a pillar of fire?
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Because the cloud came by day
[1:00:56] and the pillar of fire came by night.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; And there in heaven there'll be no
[1:01:04] night.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; OH, come on, somebody.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; IT'LL BE THE GLORY OF GOD.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; LIGHT.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THE BIBLE SAID THERE
[1:01:15] WOULD BE NO NEED FOR THE SUN.
[1:01:19] WHY? Because the LAMB IS THE LIGHT.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; AND WHERE DOES THE lamb sit?
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; On the top of the pyramid.
[1:01:31] Come on, somebody.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, brothers, what are you
[1:01:37] saying?"
[1:01:39] When we saw the pillar of fire
[1:01:43] come down,
[1:01:45] the Bible said there shall be light in
[1:01:48] the evening time.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; And so we realize by the grace of God
[1:01:59] how many times brother Bam have said it
[1:02:02] while he was preaching. The cloud came
[1:02:05] down and he said it's so milky in this
[1:02:08] place.
[1:02:11] What was it? IT WAS THE GLORY OF GOD.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT was the CLOUD OF GOD
[1:02:18] FILLING the room.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This this message is real.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; It's real.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; And uh it doesn't matter what anybody
[1:02:30] says.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; I was telling the brother today, I I
[1:02:35] know he he believes differently from me.
[1:02:39] But I wasn't trying to, you know, I was
[1:02:40] just telling him, I'm free.
[1:02:44] I can go wherever I want to.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; And nobody's doctrine going to bother me
[1:02:50] because I know what I got.
[1:02:53] I know what I have.
[1:02:56] You see what I'm saying? Even if they
[1:02:58] disagree with me
[1:03:00] or I disagree with them, I can still
[1:03:03] love them
[1:03:05] without HAVING AN ATTITUDE.
[1:03:07] [Music]
[1:03:09] EVERYBODY DOES IT DIFFERENTLY.
[1:03:13] Sad to say, but brother Bradom said not
[1:03:15] even two men can agree.
[1:03:20] The more preachers you got, the more
[1:03:22] division you got.
[1:03:24] That's why he said if we can get
[1:03:27] 10 believers or one accord,
[1:03:31] he said the rapture take place.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; You hear what I'm saying?
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; So we realize by the grace of God, I say
[1:03:43] all the time, everything's moving by the
[1:03:46] power of God.
[1:03:50] And what you may have your opinion about
[1:03:52] somebody
[1:03:54] will never change God's mind about that
[1:03:56] person.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They didn't even like John
[1:04:01] the Baptist.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; But God loved him.
[1:04:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? You
[1:04:09] might look at somebody says, "Man,
[1:04:12] that sister boy, she ain't nothing but a
[1:04:14] hypocrite."
[1:04:16] And that may be true at in in her life
[1:04:19] at that point,
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; but she's here for some reason.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; She's serving a purpose.
[1:04:28] Y'all hear what I'm saying? EVEN IN THIS
[1:04:30] CHURCH, EVERYBODY HAS A PURPOSE.
[1:04:35] It has to be this way
[1:04:38] in order for God TO GAIN GLORY.
[1:04:41] NOTHING'S OUT OF ORDER.
[1:04:46] BUT YOU MUST THANK GOD THAT YOU SEE THE
[1:04:48] GRACE OF GOD
[1:04:50] AND GOD HAS KEPT YOU
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; FROM MAKING HIS grace disgrace.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; You heard I said I said you ought to
[1:05:00] thank God
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; because God has made you
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; to see and to know the difference
[1:05:08] between grace and disgrace.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's move on.
[1:05:14] And he had in his hand,
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; let me explain that a bit.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; You mean you mean you remember David
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; and Basheba?
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; And David
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; judged his his himself.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; He didn't even realize it.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; And he said, "The man who did this thing
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; is worthy of death.
[1:05:44] And then the prophet said,
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; "But you're the man."
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. He desire he deserved, brother
[1:05:53] said, "He deserved to die."
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; BUT GRACE,
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; grace stepped in.
[1:06:04] DID HE SUFFER? HE SUFFERED. HE WENT
[1:06:07] THROUGH BATTLES THAT HE WOULD NEVER HAVE
[1:06:09] GONE THROUGH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:12] BUT HE NEVER LOST HIS SOUL.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; AND GOD STILL HONORED HIM.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; SEE, you you what you think about people
[1:06:25] don't mean a hill of beans.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; It's all about what God thinks about.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, now, now move on. And
[1:06:36] he had in his hand a little book open.
[1:06:40] And he set his right foot upon the sea,
[1:06:43] and his left foot on the earth. And he
[1:06:46] cried with a loud voice as when a lion
[1:06:49] roared. And when he had cried, even
[1:06:52] seven thunders uttered their voices.
[1:06:56] And when the seven thunders uttered
[1:06:58] their voices, I was about to write. And
[1:07:01] I heard a voice from heaven saying unto
[1:07:03] me, "Seal up those things which the
[1:07:06] seven thunders uttered, and write them
[1:07:09] not." And the angel with their salt
[1:07:11] stand upon the sea and upon the earth,
[1:07:14] lifted up his hand toward heaven,
[1:07:17] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[1:07:20] ever, who created heaven, and the things
[1:07:23] that there are in are. And the earth,
[1:07:27] and the things that therein are, and the
[1:07:30] sea, and the things which are therein,
[1:07:33] that there should be time NO LONGER.
[1:07:36] BUT in the day of the voice of the
[1:07:39] seventh angel when he shall begin TO
[1:07:42] SOUND THE MYSTERY of God a lot of time
[1:07:46] we say mysteries it doesn't say that it
[1:07:50] SAYS THE MYSTERY
[1:07:53] one mystery
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; that's why I said the God of
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Jehovah of the Old Testament
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; is Jesus Christ of the
[1:08:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; And Hebrews 13:8 says
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is saying yesterday, today,
[1:08:14] and forever.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; He's a God that changes not.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; He may change his mask,
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; but he never changes his character.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; The mystery of God should be finished.
[1:08:30] Have he declared to his servants the
[1:08:32] prophets?
[1:08:34] And the voice which I heard from heaven
[1:08:36] spake unto me again
[1:08:38] and say, "Go and take the little book
[1:08:41] which is which is open in the hand of
[1:08:44] the angel which standeth upon the sea
[1:08:46] and upon the earth." And I went unto the
[1:08:49] angel, and he said unto him, "Give me
[1:08:52] the little book."
[1:08:54] And he said unto me, "Take it, eat it
[1:08:57] up,
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; and it shall be bitter. Amen. It
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; It shall make thy belly bitter,
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[1:09:05] honey.
[1:09:06] And I took the little book out of the
[1:09:08] angel
[1:09:10] and ate it up, and it was it was in my
[1:09:13] mouth sweet as honey, but as soon as I
[1:09:16] had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And
[1:09:20] he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy
[1:09:22] again
[1:09:24] before many people and nations and
[1:09:27] tongues and kings."
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; So just understand
[1:09:33] as the prophet God said, this message
[1:09:36] wasn't done in a corner.
[1:09:39] Hallelujah.
[1:09:41] We're living in we're living in an evil
[1:09:44] time.
[1:09:46] And many people have come to America
[1:09:48] and they say, "Well, what is it that
[1:09:51] people don't even um know brother
[1:09:53] Brandham?"
[1:09:56] The Bible says a a prophet is without
[1:09:59] honor
[1:10:01] in his own country. Hallelujah. And if
[1:10:05] you don't believe it, go to Jerusalem
[1:10:08] and find out who how many people know
[1:10:10] Jesus there.
[1:10:13] Y'all understand me? So we realize by
[1:10:16] the grace of God that God did a a thing
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; in our day.
[1:10:24] Amen
[1:10:26] so simple.
[1:10:28] Majority of the people missed it.
[1:10:31] Now I can't preach on every point in
[1:10:33] this particular scriptures. So just just
[1:10:35] bear with me. Revelations 4
[1:10:47] Revelations 4.
[1:10:53] After this, I looked,
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; and behold, a door was open in heaven.
[1:10:59] And the first voice which I heard was as
[1:11:01] it were a a trumpet talking with me,
[1:11:08] which said, "Come up hither, and I will
[1:11:10] show you these things which must be
[1:11:13] hereafter."
[1:11:15] And immediately I was in the spirit.
[1:11:17] Behold, a throne was set,
[1:11:22] and one sat on the throne,
[1:11:26] and he that sat
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; was to look upon like jasper and sodas.
[1:11:33] There was a rainbow round about the
[1:11:35] throne
[1:11:37] in sight like an emerald.
[1:11:42] Now when we look at this remember
[1:11:44] brother Adam says the book of revelation
[1:11:48] is a book of symbols.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; So understand whenever you see things or
[1:11:53] read things
[1:11:55] it has a different application
[1:11:59] right? So you must understand
[1:12:03] that it who represented the sing stone.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because we talking about the
[1:12:12] children of Israel too because remember
[1:12:14] the seven church ages
[1:12:17] also included the Jewish people as well.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Even though God was dealing
[1:12:22] with the Gentiles,
[1:12:25] the seven candlesticks
[1:12:30] was of the Jew first.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then we find out
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; that Jesus Christ walked
[1:12:40] in the midst of the golden candlesticks.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; And in the midst of the golden
[1:12:46] candlesticks,
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; he had a rainbow
[1:12:49] above his head.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; It was a covenant,
[1:12:54] unconditional covenant.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; What are you saying? When God promised
[1:13:00] uh Noah it wasn't going to rain anymore.
[1:13:04] Noah did nothing
[1:13:07] to gain the covenant that God gave him.
[1:13:13] That was grace.
[1:13:15] It'll never flood again. Noah, but the
[1:13:17] next time it would be fire.
[1:13:21] Hallelujah.
[1:13:23] So what was he saying to Noah?
[1:13:27] your uh your uh how could the world in
[1:13:29] itself
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; was destroyed
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; temporarily.
[1:13:36] Amen.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; But this time,
[1:13:39] I'm going to cleanse it
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; and purge it forever
[1:13:45] by fire. Y'all hear what I'm saying? We
[1:13:49] come through justification,
[1:13:51] sanctification,
[1:13:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost, right? And
[1:13:56] then the prophet OF GOD TELLS US NOBODY
[1:13:58] ELSE HAS THIS.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T YOU DON'T HEAR THIS among
[1:14:02] denominationals
[1:14:05] that we've got to grow immature
[1:14:08] into Christ.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU DON'T HEAR THESE THINGS
[1:14:12] ABOUT being a diamond
[1:14:16] that has to be cut and shaped.
[1:14:19] We don't hear these things. We hear WE
[1:14:22] WE UNDERSTAND OUR TRIALS.
[1:14:26] WE UNDERSTAND OUR TEMPTATIONS.
[1:14:29] WE UNDERSTAND THAT SCRIPTURE THAT ALL
[1:14:32] THINGS WORK TOGETHER FOR THE GOOD OF
[1:14:34] THEM THAT LOVE THE LORD. WE UNDERSTAND
[1:14:36] THAT.
[1:14:38] HALLELUJAH. AND BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND
[1:14:41] that we see AND WE UNDERSTAND
[1:14:46] THAT NO WEAPON
[1:14:48] FORMED AGAINST US CAN PROSPER. IT
[1:14:51] DOESN'T PROSPER.
[1:14:54] IS WHAT YOU HAVE ON THE INSIDE THAT WAS
[1:14:58] GIVEN TO YOU BEFORE YOU EVEN CAME HERE.
[1:15:05] And if God LOVED YOU THEN, HE LOVE YOU
[1:15:08] NOW,
[1:15:10] EVEN THE BIBLE SAYS IN THAT WHILE WE
[1:15:13] WERE YET SINNERS,
[1:15:15] CHRIST died for us.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; What a mighty God.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; What a covenant.
[1:15:24] Hallelujah.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; So let let's move on. Immediately I was
[1:15:30] in the spirit and behold a throne the
[1:15:32] second verse
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; was set in heaven and one sat on the
[1:15:38] throne.
[1:15:41] And he that sat was to look upon as
[1:15:43] Jasper inside his feet.
[1:15:46] Brother said that was Reuben and
[1:15:48] Benjamin.
[1:15:52] Reuben and Benjamin,
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; the alpha and the omega
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; was able to produce that light above his
[1:15:58] head,
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; the emerald.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; And what did that include?
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Everything in between.
[1:16:09] HALLELUJAH.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO GOD KNOWS EXACTLY what
[1:16:13] he's doing.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Why wouldn't he know?
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; He's God.
[1:16:20] And around about the throne were four
[1:16:22] and 20 seats.
[1:16:26] Upon the seats I saw four and 20 elders
[1:16:29] sitting
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; clothed in white raignment. And they had
[1:16:33] on their heads crowns of what?
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; And out of the throne proceeded
[1:16:41] lightnings and thunderings and voices.
[1:16:45] And there were seven lamps of fire
[1:16:47] burning before the throne, which was the
[1:16:50] seven spirits of God.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Now, we were taught that the seven
[1:16:56] spirits,
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; it's the same spirit
[1:17:00] just used
[1:17:02] in seven ways.
[1:17:05] Starting with Paul,
[1:17:08] the seven church ages, seven ministries,
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; by the same SPIRIT
[1:17:15] IS THAT RIGHT? ONE BODY, MANY MEMBERS,
[1:17:19] MANY FUNCTIONS, one spirit. HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:23] BUT IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT, you think
[1:17:26] that God has seven spirits.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE'S ONLY ONE DIAMOND
[1:17:35] THAT REFLECTS SEVEN COLORS.
[1:17:38] AMEN.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; But what I didn't understand in my study
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; is that in the rainbow
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; there are millions of different colors
[1:17:51] in between. That's right.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But we see only the seven
[1:17:58] major with everything coming together.
[1:18:01] Hallelujah. IT PRODUCES THE SEVEN.
[1:18:06] WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, BROTHER BROOKS?
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; IT MAKES SENSE.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAID THERE WAS NO
[1:18:12] NO NUMBER. NOBODY COULD NUMBER IT.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE YOU GOT TO REALIZE
[1:18:19] THAT ALL OF US IS PART OF THE RAINBOW.
[1:18:27] You say, "Wait a minute, brother. I
[1:18:28] don't know about that." So, I'mma jump a
[1:18:30] little bit.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; I'mma jump a little bit.
[1:18:34] Guess what happened to Joseph?
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; His daddy gave him a co a coat
[1:18:40] of many colors.
[1:18:43] And guess what he did with it? He wore
[1:18:46] it.
[1:18:49] [Laughter]
[1:18:51] That's why brother B said you got to see
[1:18:53] the token.
[1:18:55] See these attributes in you.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; They must must reflect itself outward.
[1:19:02] Hallelujah.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; You understand me? It must be a RAINBOW
[1:19:08] OF CHARACTER,
[1:19:10] flowing through you that other men's may
[1:19:14] see
[1:19:15] you
[1:19:17] or see him and glorify God. You hear
[1:19:20] what I'm saying?
[1:19:22] When you see a rainbow, what do you do?
[1:19:25] You glorify God.
[1:19:29] Amen. Right.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; I love this.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Let me let me uh So, Joseph,
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; we know how it was with Joseph,
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; his brothers hated him and everything
[1:19:45] when when they took the coat from him,
[1:19:48] you know, and you know, killed the
[1:19:50] little goat or whatever it was, put the
[1:19:51] blood on it, the coat went back to the
[1:19:53] father.
[1:19:57] But on the day of Pentecost,
[1:20:00] He dropped the coat back.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; It was like an Elijah and Alicia,
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; right? I got to wear the same mantel
[1:20:11] that Elijah wore, we must wear.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; THE SAME ROBE THAT Jesus wore, we must
[1:20:21] wear.
[1:20:23] AMEN.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. NOW YOU HAVE BECOME
[1:20:27] PART of his what?
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; DIVINE NATURE.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; That was his robe.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; His divine nature
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; was his robe.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; That's what brother Bham came to do. He
[1:20:44] said, "I I I TRUST THE LORD HAS GIVEN ME
[1:20:47] THE GRACE
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; TO DO WHAT? DRESS THE BRIDE."
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND HOW DID HE DRESS THE
[1:20:55] BRIDE?
[1:20:57] BY TELLING US AND EXPLAINING TO US WHAT
[1:21:01] PETER WAS SAYING, HELLO,
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; right the divine NATURE OF GOD.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; AND HERE PETER SAYS, IF ALL THESE THINGS
[1:21:12] be in you, you shall not fall,
[1:21:16] neither will you be barren.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; And you what you're saying? What is
[1:21:24] that?
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Y'all got to understand
[1:21:30] Enoch.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; He built the pyramid.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; He didn't put the capstone on it.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; He wasn't, "Oh my goodness, they're not
[1:21:40] going to accept the word."
[1:21:43] He knew Noah.
[1:21:45] He knew that Noah was going to only have
[1:21:48] a few people.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; ENOCH. HAD TO HAVE PREACHED JESUS.
[1:21:58] In order FOR THEM TO REJECT HIM,
[1:22:01] ENOCH had to have a message.
[1:22:06] THINK ABOUT IT. HE PUT THE THE pyramid
[1:22:11] and there was no headstone.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; AND ALL NOAH COULD DO
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; IS PREACH AND SAY, "COME IN THE ARK."
[1:22:22] BUT ENOCH'S MESSAGE WAS DIFFERENT.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; IF YOU WALK WITH GOD,
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; YOU'LL BE TRANSLATED.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; You just have to read through between
[1:22:36] the lines.
[1:22:37] That's right. Hallelujah.
[1:22:41] Because when Noah came, all he had was
[1:22:43] his eight,
[1:22:46] his family and himself,
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; And Enoch was one,
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; showing there was only going to be a
[1:22:55] fewer
[1:22:58] saved.
[1:23:00] Let's put it this way.
[1:23:03] Red is the strongest color of the
[1:23:05] rainbow
[1:23:07] and it's number one.
[1:23:10] And it has the longest vibration
[1:23:14] wavelength.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Because it represents the blood.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; But the last one
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; is what we call purple
[1:23:27] or violet.
[1:23:29] It's the shortest.
[1:23:33] Hallelujah. Oh Lord have mercy. This is
[1:23:35] good to me.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; It's the shortest.
[1:23:39] because it types out the bride
[1:23:42] royalty.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. THAT'S WHY WE KNOW
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; IT'S going to be a few.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S ALL IN THAT.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; God is so perfect.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm gonna jump a little bit
[1:24:07] because I can't do it all. But while you
[1:24:09] turn with me to Zechariah,
[1:24:12] I'm going to read St. John 15 16- 17.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:19] Ye have not chosen me,
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; but I have chosen you
[1:24:24] and ordain you that you should go and
[1:24:28] bring forth fruit, and that your fruit
[1:24:31] should remain,
[1:24:33] that whatsoever you shall ask of the
[1:24:36] Father in my name, he shall give it you.
[1:24:40] These things I command you,
[1:24:43] hello, that ye love one another. NOW HE
[1:24:47] TIES ALL OF THAT
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; into loving one another. I command you.
[1:24:54] This is a commandment.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; IT'S LOVE BECAUSE LOVE and grace
[1:25:02] are twins.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Zechariah.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; I know some of y'all know this.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Zechariah the 4th chapter.
[1:25:16] beginning at the fifth verse.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Then the angel that talked with me
[1:25:23] answered and said unto me,
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Knowest thou not what thou these be?
[1:25:30] And I said, no, my Lord. Then he
[1:25:32] answered and spake unto me, saying,
[1:25:35] This is the word of the Lord unto
[1:25:37] Zerubbabel.
[1:25:40] saying, "Not by might,
[1:25:43] not by power, but by my spirit, said the
[1:25:46] Lord of hosts."
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Now, we we've seen that, brother talk
[1:25:51] about not by denomination, not by
[1:25:53] organization, but only by the Holy
[1:25:56] Spirit.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who art thou, oh great
[1:26:02] mountain before Zerubah? Thou shall
[1:26:04] become a plain,
[1:26:06] and he shall bring forth the headstone
[1:26:10] therewith, shouting, crying,
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; grace,
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; grace unto it.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Have you noticed one grace is
[1:26:23] capitalized
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; and the other grace is not?
[1:26:30] is a deep call.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; He's crying grace
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; and the bride is responding grace
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; unto it. Moreover, the word of the Lord
[1:26:48] came unto me, saying,
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; the hands of Zerubable have laid the
[1:26:53] foundation of this house.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And I'd looked up
[1:26:59] Zerubabel
[1:27:01] and some people say he should not have
[1:27:03] existed.
[1:27:05] I forgot the name of the king which
[1:27:07] would have been his grandfather or his
[1:27:09] father
[1:27:11] that messed up so bad.
[1:27:14] The God said, "I'm finished with the
[1:27:15] house of David."
[1:27:19] And if you know the story, Zeruma helped
[1:27:22] build the temple.
[1:27:24] He helped build the altar.
[1:27:26] He was literally acting like a king and
[1:27:28] a priest.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then all of a sudden, he
[1:27:33] disappeared.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; And nobody really know where he's coming
[1:27:37] from.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; His whole movement, everything he did,
[1:27:44] but understand where he showed up at
[1:27:47] when they were exiting Babylon.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; WHEN THEY WERE COMING out of Babylon,
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Zerubbabel showed up
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; and you know, I've read where Zerubable
[1:28:04] mean born in in in in Babylon.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; But years ago, I looked it up. It meant
[1:28:11] it in wherever. I tried to find it. It
[1:28:15] meant to be disperse all confusion,
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; but I couldn't find that definition
[1:28:20] anymore. You know, they changed things.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; So, anyway,
[1:28:25] Zerubable.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; And I I forgot how many years it took.
[1:28:29] What? 15 years they held him up.
[1:28:33] Held up the building and the of the wall
[1:28:35] and everything. 15 years. But Zerubable
[1:28:38] never gave up.
[1:28:42] Hallelujah. Is that right? Listen. It
[1:28:44] says, "The hands of Zerubable have laid
[1:28:47] the foundation of this house."
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; And one author says,
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; one author says, Jeruba was a true type
[1:28:56] of Christ. Jesus.
[1:28:59] Hallelujah. Because Jesus was the laid
[1:29:02] the foundation.
[1:29:04] He was the cornerstone.
[1:29:07] And Jeruba said, "Not only will I lay
[1:29:09] it, but I'm going to finish it."
[1:29:14] And we know that the CORNERSTONE
[1:29:17] BECAME the headstone,
[1:29:19] which we CALL IT THE CAPSTONE.
[1:29:22] AND HE IS THE ONE THAT FINISH IT.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAID that the WORK THAT
[1:29:29] JESUS STARTED IN YOU, HE IS FAITHFUL TO
[1:29:33] COMPLETE IT.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; LIKE ZERUBBABEL, HE WAS THERE TO BUILD A
[1:29:39] SECOND TEMPLE.
[1:29:41] BUT JESUS HIMSELF
[1:29:44] CAME TO BUILD A THIRD TEMPLE
[1:29:48] WHICH YOU AND I ARE. WE ARE THE TEMPLE
[1:29:51] OF GOD.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAID NO MAN CAN ADD A
[1:29:58] CUBID TO HIS STATUE.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT JESUS WHO IS THE MASTER
[1:30:04] BUILDER. COME ON SOMEBODY. THAT'S WHY IN
[1:30:07] THE STATUE OF A PERFECT MAN, BROTHER
[1:30:10] BRANDHAM SAID YOU DON'T ADD TO IT.
[1:30:13] IT WILL ADD TO YOU. HALLELUJAH. SO YOUR
[1:30:17] PERFECTION IS NOT EVEN IN YOUR HANDS. IT
[1:30:21] IS GOD WHO PERFECTS YOU.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE IS THE GREAT SHEPHERD.
[1:30:27] HE'S THE ONE THAT LEADS AND GUIDES YOU.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. JUST FOLLOW AS THE PROPHET
[1:30:34] said the pillar of fire.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; And thou shalt know that the Lord of
[1:30:42] hosts
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; have sent me unto you.
[1:30:46] For who have despised the day of small
[1:30:48] things,
[1:30:51] for they shall rejoice
[1:30:53] and see the plummet of uh in the hand of
[1:30:56] Zub
[1:30:57] with those seven eyes.
[1:31:00] Is that right?
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; All of Brother Bon's messages,
[1:31:03] everything that God gave him, I'm
[1:31:06] jumping had to be tied in
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; with all the others to make a complete
[1:31:12] seven.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; All the way from from from from from
[1:31:18] Paul
[1:31:20] up to the last day of Malachi 4.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and said they are the eyes
[1:31:28] of the Lord which run to and fro through
[1:31:32] the whole earth.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Let me read this to you.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; One day
[1:31:39] on that day, said the Lord of hosts,
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; I will take you Zerubel of Sheiel, my
[1:31:46] son. Sir,
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; and wear you like a signate.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; You know what a signate is? It's a ring
[1:31:55] of a king.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; It was like Joseph
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; when when the king gave Joseph the
[1:32:03] signate.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; The only thing that was greater than
[1:32:06] Joseph was the king himself.
[1:32:10] So here was here was here was Zerubo
[1:32:13] with the signant. Oh come on somebody.
[1:32:16] In other word he had the authority of
[1:32:18] God.
[1:32:22] the authority of the king.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; For it was you whom I have chosen.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; And this is the word of the Lord of
[1:32:33] hosts. And you can find that in Hi 2:23.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me read a few things.
[1:32:42] Y'all bear with me to you on Zerubo.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Jerubo was the restoration and hope.
[1:32:51] Jerusalem led the Jews in rebuilding the
[1:32:54] second temple after their exile in
[1:32:57] Babylon,
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; signifying a return to worship
[1:33:04] and restoration of God's presence
[1:33:07] at the period of judgment.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you got to understand
[1:33:12] that's what God did
[1:33:14] in our day.
[1:33:16] God's power over human human might.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; And this is what the prophet was telling
[1:33:21] us. It ain't you.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; You can speak in tongues.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; You can be a preacher.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; You can be a musician. You can shout.
[1:33:32] You can do all the things. And that
[1:33:34] doesn't mean you're saved.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Because salvation is of the Lord.
[1:33:43] All right. The prophet Zachchariah
[1:33:46] messages Zerubu.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Not by power nor by might but by my
[1:33:53] spirit. Hallelujah. Emphasizing
[1:33:57] that God work is accomplished
[1:34:00] through divine power and not human
[1:34:03] strength or might. Y'all hear what I'm
[1:34:07] saying? That's why you got to stay right
[1:34:10] there on it.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. The more the the moment you
[1:34:15] switch to the law,
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; you have you have excommunicated
[1:34:20] yourself from grace.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; WE DO NOT live the way we LIVE
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE'RE AFRAID TO go to hell.
[1:34:31] We live THE WAY WE LIVE
[1:34:34] BECAUSE IT'S OUR NATURE
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; to live it.
[1:34:40] Hallelujah.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; AND OUR NATURE
[1:34:43] COMPELS US TO LOVE GOD.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; And Zerubbabel
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; was a a messianic over foreshadowing.
[1:35:03] of David.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Zerubable leadership of the temple
[1:35:07] rebuilding
[1:35:09] was seen as a fulfillment of Messiah
[1:35:12] prophecy.
[1:35:14] He did everything
[1:35:16] that the Messiah was to do.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What did Jesus do when he
[1:35:23] first saw the temple
[1:35:25] and saw them trading and selling?
[1:35:29] In his indignation,
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; he got he whipped him out of the temple
[1:35:35] and he said, "My house shall be called
[1:35:36] the house of prayer,
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; but you have made it a den of thieves."
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Excuse me.
[1:35:45] By the grace of God,
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; we need that whipping to come back
[1:35:49] through.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; God is good.
[1:36:00] And I showed you about the signant ring.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; It symbolizes authority, honor, and
[1:36:07] value in God's eyes.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that all right?
[1:36:12] Understand the faithfulness
[1:36:14] with leadership.
[1:36:16] The rubable story encourages believers
[1:36:20] to trust God's plan and have faith that
[1:36:23] can can be accomplished
[1:36:26] what God has called them to do through
[1:36:29] his spirit.
[1:36:31] Hallelujah.
[1:36:33] Even when faith, even when faced with
[1:36:36] challenges.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Now, there's no way I'mma finish
[1:36:39] everything, but I do want to read a few
[1:36:42] things
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; coming from the message.
[1:36:46] Children of Israel,
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; paragraph 31,
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; paragraph,
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; excuse me. Wow. They're going down in
[1:36:57] there,
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; how perfect it was with the scripture.
[1:37:03] How Joseph,
[1:37:05] the younger son,
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; rejected of his brethren.
[1:37:09] Christ rejected of his brethren. He wore
[1:37:12] a coat of seven colors. Joseph and the
[1:37:17] seven colors of course represented seven
[1:37:19] colors in the rainbow which was a
[1:37:22] covenant and God always has his covenant
[1:37:27] people.
[1:37:29] You hear that? He always has his
[1:37:31] covenant people.
[1:37:34] And then this one, young Joseph, was
[1:37:37] killed supposedly
[1:37:40] by his brethren, and his coat was to be
[1:37:43] returned to his father.
[1:37:47] I want to see another thing
[1:37:50] that he was thrown into the ditch
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; and was supposedly be dead,
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; but he was taken up from the ditch
[1:37:58] and was taken into the greatest
[1:38:00] commercial city of the world
[1:38:03] and was made the right hand man that no
[1:38:07] man could either enter into the gate or
[1:38:10] come into the courts without first
[1:38:13] coming through Joseph. a perfect type of
[1:38:16] Christ.
[1:38:17] They thought they had killed him and
[1:38:20] throwed him in the grave,
[1:38:22] but God raised him up.
[1:38:25] And today he sits at the right hand of
[1:38:27] medicine and no man can come to God
[1:38:32] except he come through Christ.
[1:38:35] Is that right?
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Now, let me move on. I'm almost done.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So the seven colors of the
[1:38:45] rainbow
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; in order is red,
[1:38:50] orange,
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; yellow,
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; green,
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; blue,
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; indigo,
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; and violet.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'mma read these things so
[1:39:02] you can understand.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; They tie right into the virtues.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Red symbolizes sacrifice and redemption.
[1:39:12] sacrifice,
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; right? And I said that was the first.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; So that's that's faith. Faith in the
[1:39:20] blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Often associated with the
[1:39:25] blood of Christ.
[1:39:27] Orange assoc associated with endurance,
[1:39:31] strength and fire of God,
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; virtue.
[1:39:36] Yellow represents the glory of God and
[1:39:39] his presence as well as joy and faith
[1:39:44] and that comes under knowledge,
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; right? Faith is knowledge because once
[1:39:50] you have knowledge who he who he is, you
[1:39:53] can't help but glorify God and
[1:39:56] represents joy with faith.
[1:39:59] Green civilizes life, renewal and
[1:40:03] growth, often connected to eternal life
[1:40:07] through Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; I could keep going, but let me get to
[1:40:13] Violet
[1:40:15] associated with royalty,
[1:40:17] priesthood,
[1:40:19] majesty, and the sovereignty of God,
[1:40:23] which is grace.
[1:40:25] And so you see by the grace of God,
[1:40:28] Amen. We are a royal priesthood.
[1:40:32] Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the last color of the rainbow
[1:40:36] is violet. This color is associated with
[1:40:40] royalty,
[1:40:41] priesthood,
[1:40:43] majesty.
[1:40:45] Hallelujah. And sovereignty of God.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[1:40:55] Glory to God.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; So, let me say something to you.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Moving on.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; The only compass we need is the word.
[1:41:10] The wise men, they didn't have a
[1:41:12] compass.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; They followed the star.
[1:41:16] And everybody couldn't see the star.
[1:41:19] Only those who were elected to see the
[1:41:21] star
[1:41:22] saw the star.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Did you know that light over brother
[1:41:26] Brandham's head
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; is considered a star?
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Everybody can't see it. But the point is
[1:41:38] when you reject the light of God,
[1:41:41] you are plunged into complete darkness.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm trying to get to a
[1:41:47] particular quote.
[1:42:03] Let's read this. Uh, coming from the
[1:42:05] message of grace,
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; paragraph 56.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; I'm going shorten this because of the
[1:42:11] time.
[1:42:13] But did you not know
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; that brother Brandham's ministry
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; was a type of Zubable?
[1:42:22] Amen.
[1:42:27] And what people don't understand
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; is that God gave him that signal
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; because he told him
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; even if you can get all the people to
[1:42:38] believe
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; they could have what they will.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; And there were times
[1:42:48] when brother Baron said, "I give you
[1:42:49] your healing.
[1:42:52] I give you this. I give you that."
[1:42:54] Why? Because he had the signant.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; He had the power of the almighty God.
[1:43:01] Hallelujah.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to say this to you.
[1:43:04] Brother Brandham said, God slipped his
[1:43:06] wedding band
[1:43:08] on our finger
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[1:43:14] So, what you don't understand is that
[1:43:16] you have the same kind of authority
[1:43:19] of a queen.
[1:43:22] Amen.
[1:43:27] But now according to the prophecy,
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; there will come the headstone.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Listen what he says. I want you to
[1:43:36] notice that.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; When the headstone comes,
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; the prince that's going to cry out the
[1:43:43] message will cry grace. Grace,
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; he said the prince.
[1:43:50] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:43:54] For it's by grace are you saved. That's
[1:43:58] not works, lest any man should boast.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; And the message of grace
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; has been tramped under the feet of men
[1:44:08] until it becomes a disgrace.
[1:44:11] Some of them run out into eternal
[1:44:14] security,
[1:44:17] some out into everything.
[1:44:20] But the true message of grace remains
[1:44:23] the same.
[1:44:25] And there's where Satan tries
[1:44:28] to knock it out from the church.
[1:44:31] But the grace of God that we are all
[1:44:36] saved by. But it's the grace of God that
[1:44:40] we are all saved by.
[1:44:42] So in the deity of Jesus Christ,
[1:44:46] if the Lord God could come there and
[1:44:49] confirm
[1:44:51] that this is truth,
[1:44:53] not only that, but by his word he
[1:44:56] confirms it's the truth and by signs and
[1:45:01] wonders he confirmed it's the truth.
[1:45:05] Then also grace is the truth.
[1:45:08] Then why could anyone criticize and say
[1:45:12] that grace is wrong?
[1:45:14] That we're saved by works. We are saved
[1:45:17] by grace that through faith, not of
[1:45:22] works. Works shows that you have been
[1:45:25] saved.
[1:45:27] But what grace gives what? But what what
[1:45:30] saves you is the grace of God.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Grace saves you. Grace is God. Grace is
[1:45:37] what God what Grace is what God does for
[1:45:40] you.
[1:45:42] Works is what you do for God
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; to show appreciation
[1:45:49] of what God did for you. By grace you
[1:45:52] are saved.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; We're just going to stop right there.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; We'll finish this. We'll finish this the
[1:46:03] next time we see.
[1:46:08] I don't know what that heat, homeboy,
[1:46:09] but I'm high.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; God is good.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; So, let's stand.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Our gracious Father God,
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; we thank you for your grace and your
[1:46:22] mercy.
[1:46:24] We thank you for your beautiful way of
[1:46:26] salvation. Surely the natural man could
[1:46:30] never have seen this.
[1:46:34] But we so thankful
[1:46:36] that by your grace and your revelation,
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; you have shown to us
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; the power of Calvary,
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; you have shown to us the power of your
[1:46:47] love.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; We can't even fathom it, Lord.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; But we truly thank you, Lord. And we
[1:46:56] ask, oh God,
[1:46:58] that you give us a love
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; for you
[1:47:02] like you love us.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; By doing so,
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; I know that I could love my brethren. I
[1:47:10] can love my sisters and Lord, give you
[1:47:12] glory in doing so. Grant it, Lord. Let
[1:47:17] the virtues of God reflect through us
[1:47:20] like a rainbow in the sky that all men
[1:47:23] will be able to see it and glorify you,
[1:47:26] Lord.
[1:47:27] Let the virtues of Christ, the divine
[1:47:30] nature of God,
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; fill this temple that when they see it,
[1:47:36] they'll see the white light which is
[1:47:38] you, Lord,
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; and they'll glorify you.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; In your name, Jesus Christ, we pray.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, brother.
[1:47:53] [Music]

[1:48:47] I see.
[1:48:52] It was grace

[1:48:58] my heart
[1:49:01] to fear
[1:49:04] and grace
[1:49:06] my fear.

[1:49:39] dangerous
[1:49:42] doors.
